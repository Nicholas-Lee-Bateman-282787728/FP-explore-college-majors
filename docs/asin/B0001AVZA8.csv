798003,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001AVZA8,,"[4, 4]","Diane Keaton gives the performance of her career in ""Something's Gotta Give,"" writer/director Nancy Meyers' smart and savvy take on middle-age romance.  Keaton plays Erica Barry, a 50-something playwright living on her own in a swanky beach house in the Hamptons.  Although she has achieved enormous success in her career, her personal life leaves much to be desired.  Erica, though brilliant and attractive, has pretty much shut herself off from the dating scene since her divorce a number of years ago.  Erica's life runs like a well-oiled machine, with each element - both personal and professional - fitted neatly into place, with no room left over for spontaneity or passion.  One fateful day, Erica stumbles upon a strange man rummaging through her refrigerator, a 63 year-old professional bachelor named Harry Sanborn who, Erica discovers to her horror, is dating her 30 year-old daughter, Marin (Harry is, actually, a notorious bachelor, having been profiled as such in a number of tony New York magazines).  Even though Erica is disgusted by the situation, she is forced to take care of Harry after he suffers a heart attack while staying at her place.  Despite their diametrically opposed outlooks on love and romance, Erica and Harry spend quality time together, discover their ultimate compatibility, and eventually fall in love.Meyers has written a witty, sophisticated screenplay that offers insights into any number of ""battle of the sexes"" issues.  She has outrageous fun exploring the phenomenon of middle-aged men cavorting with women half their age.  Jack Nicholson, known in real life for doing just that, has a great time poking fun at his own public image while, at the same time, providing a richly textured portrait of a man who may not be quite as shallow as his persona would suggest.  When he so unexpectedly finds his head turned by a vibrant, attractive and intelligent woman in her 50's, Harry, a middle-aged Lothario who finds he needs Viagra to help him keep pace with his youthful ""conquests,"" is forced to re-evaluate what has hitherto been the defining philosophy of his personality and lifestyle.  Nicholson is magnificent at showing us the profound confusion his character undergoes as he takes those much belated but faltering steps into adult maturity.Nicholson is, however, only one half of this extraordinary couple.  As the other half, Keaton, having been handed what is clearly the role of a lifetime, has never seemed so natural and self-assured on screen.  She makes of the character a capable, no-nonsense woman who has allowed her passions to lie dormant far too long.  Though, on the surface, she appears confident and in control of her life, Erica is, underneath it all, a woman wounded by past experience and intimidated by a culture that expects women to be put out to pasture the moment they reach middle age.  It is this combination of strength and vulnerability that makes Erica such a complex, recognizable individual - and it is the very quality that Keaton captures so exquisitely in her performance.  The chemistry generated between Keaton and Nicholson in this film is so glowing and palpable one wonders why no filmmaker ever saw the potential of this dynamic duo until now.In addition to these two outstanding performers, the film boasts excellent supporting work from Frances McDormand as Erica's pragmatic, clear-headed sister; Amanda Peet as Erica's level-headed daughter; and Keanu Reeves as Harry's handsome young doctor who finds himself smitten by Erica's mature beauty and charm.""Something's Gotta Give"" is that rare romantic comedy that not only acknowledges the romantic inclinations of people over forty, but also recognizes the emotional complexities of their relationships.  Because both Erica and Harry have been around the block a few times, they bring a lifetime of baggage to their burgeoning attachment.  Thus, unlike in the vast majority of romantic comedies, which are clearly geared to the younger generation, the lovers here have a depth not often encountered when the focus is on two inexperienced neophytes.  It takes the experience that comes from living to make a person interesting, after all.Thanks to the quality of the writing and the performances, ""Something's Gotta Give"" takes its place among the great romantic comedy/dramas like ""Two For the Road,"" ""Annie Hall,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""The American President.""

798004,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B0001AVZA8,,"[4, 4]","I really like the aging Diane Keaton ever so much more than I did the Annie Hall-ish, squirley younger Keaton with her annoying mannerisms. She is at her best in this laugh out loud (and sob out loud, as well) film. In fact, ""Something's Gotta Give"" is also a superb vehicle for the talent of Jack Nicholson. Were Keaton and Nicholson ever a real-life couple? I ask because there is such chemistry at work between the two!Real life--yes, that area where older men--wrinkled, weightier, and richer, date young women who still have dew on their skins. As Amanda Peet's character reminds him: ""You don't date women over 30."" The older (and larger) he is, the sillier he looks with these women. And intimacy? Do those young women really--well, you know.Am I saying that older men are repugnant? No, of course not, but the movie itself makes my point. Where is the comfort level for a couple in a relationship? Where is a real sharing of life? With the couple of similar ages, similar life styles, similar experiences, or the relationship in which one is trying to stay young and the other is seeking what?--riches, a good time, what?Jack's character Harry has never been in love and finds himself in a dither concerning what it might mean for his life. Give up those under-30's? For a woman his age? The initial idea of kissing Erica's (Keaton) less dewy mouth makes his face screw all up. Enter Keanu Reeves, a doctor who treats Jack's heart attack and becomes part of the triangle. The doctor has long admired Erica's talent as a very successful playwright, thoroughly familiar with her work. He is smitten.Reversing the older man/younger woman scenario to older woman/younger man is quite interesting. Keaton plays it for all it's worth. Reeve is an excellent casting choice here in making this combination work. (But Demi and Ashton have already shown us that.)When Harry meets Erica at her house on the shore (outside New York), he is there with her daughter, one of those dewy younger women, for their first-time experience. A heart attack stops the action, setting up a scenario for him to get to know a woman his age. Their sex scene (which reveals very little) is one of the two funniest sex scenes I've ever seen. (The other was Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson trying to imitate early television scenes in which one foot is always on the floor.) The scene is also poignant.When Harry returns to the city, Keaton believes they actually have something. When she sees him out with one of the dew creatures, she is heart-broken. I sobbed with her for the next few scenes (and every time I watch the movie again). Enter the doctor to mend her broken heart.Paris is the scene of reconciliation. Ah, Paris, that city of romance. The one false note of the film is Keanu's reaction to Harry and Erica.""Something's Gotta Give"" is an excellent film which addresses issues of an aging population seeking love. Romance? You bet! Reconciliation? Oh yes!

They live in one of the nicest beach houses you could possibly imagine, that looks down on the sandy beach.Jack has this heart issue and when he's overactive or having sex, it tends to act up. Amanda and Diane are at his side at the hospital when he has a heart attack but then he recovers.Diane and Jack are soul mates but they don't even know it till the very end.

798010,A5S3BAWLNT10P,B0001AVZA8,Amazon Customer,"[14, 24]","Where ""Lost in Translation"" showed us a complex giving relationship between an older man and a younger woman, ""Something's Gotta Give"" is unrepentantly nasty about such relationships, which it sees as inevitably a character flaw in the older man.At the same time it wants to have its cake and eat it by making no such criticisms of relationships between older woman and younger men.It's not hard to see that the audience demographic for this movie is baby boom women who don't much like the idea that many men of their generation are now dating younger ones, but heartily applaud Cher and Demi Moore for their May/December romances.In ""Something's Gotta Give"" Jack Nicholson's Harry Langer gets criticised for his interest in younger women. Frances McDormand as a woman's studies teacher laments that older men can date younger women but that older single women can't get dates at all. A former husband, played by Paul Michael Glaser, is criticised for wanting to remarry - inevitably - a younger woman.Yet despite that, not only does Nicholson's character finally fall for older female playwright Erica Barry, played by Diane Keaton, so does Harry's young doctor Julian, played by Keanu Reeves. (And Keanu Reeves as a doctor, and an enthusiastic and astute intellectual judge of plays, is perhaps the film's biggest single bad joke.)But even the better actors are disappointing. Jack Nicholson just does his Nicholson as bad boy schtick, a far remove from his superb performance in ""Schmidt"". Oscar nominated or not, Keaton gasps a lot.It's an awful audience-pandering film, and one that will enjoyed pretty much only by precisely that sector of the female audience to which it is pandering. And it's set in a bizarre fantasy world. Doesn't writer and director Nancy Meyers know that Broadway is a highly competitive place these days, and that plays like the stuff Keaton's character writes wouldn't even get an off-Broadway venue? And yet we're to believe that Erica has got filthy rich from doing this kind of stuff.And then there's the movie's double standard which merely reverses old sexist attitudes and replaces them with new ones.  Older men and younger women bad. Older women and younger men fine.In the end though the film dissatisfies even those who uphold this new double standard. It's even more conservative than that. Date within five years of your own age people. Even some women critics, to whom you might expect this movie to appeal, have said they don't believe the final scene for a second. Neither do I.In the nineteen-fifties Douglas Sirk directed the wonderful ""All that Heaven Allows"", in which a middle-aged Jane Wyman fell for a young Rock Hudson. It was a plea for openness in judging the relationships of others, and it's sometimes depressing to realise that in some ways, and particularly in some PC ways, Hollywood is more conservative now than it was in those days, merely replacing the prejudices of one era with those of another.Like many others, I lament the fact that Hollywood puts many fine actresses out to seed too early.

It doesn't matter that Keaton's antics can be completely unrealistic, or that Nicholson's `all too familiar' character development can verge on lazy; all that matters is that together they are undeniably entertaining.  You can't help but get sucked into their chemistry, which just oozes onto every frame of this film.`Something's Gotta Give' is one of those films that shouldn't work, and when dissected it really doesn't work, but manages of actually WORK thanks to a combination of smart dialog, funny performances and total chemistry.Erica Barry is a playwright past her bloom who has fooled herself into thinking that she is happy being alone.  Her daughter, Marin, is dating Harry Sanborn, a music producer who is so full of himself he comes across more pathetic than confident.  Harry is the same age (or at least closer in age) as Erica.  When a series of events forces Harry under the care of Erica, love starts to bloom in an unexpected area.  Soon Harry and Erica are finding that they enjoy one another and soon they are giving themselves to each other in ways they never imagined possible; but, is this relationship really meant to work?Nancy Meyers script starts off wonderfully, but it does start to drag in the third act; getting a little tiresome.  I have found this to be a problem with Meyers work.  She understands how to create something fresh and exciting in this genre (romantic comedy) that is so tired and clich&eacute;d, but she doesn't know how to edit very well.  I actually liked the plot twist with the younger doctor falling for Erica, and I actually felt that the usually stiff and monotonous Reeves nailed his performance, but it does drag on for too long and starts to verge on unnecessary, which is sad since the plot point in its initial stages feels very nicely crafted.  In fact, my only real complaints with this film fall in the scripts final stages.Everything else seems to blend together beautifully.Even though this film is riddles with quirks and flaws and moments that just feel SO WRONG, they work so well with one another.  That's why I said that this is a film that works even though it technically shouldn't.  Keaton and Nicholson thrive off one another and really give the audience their moneys worth.  I wish that Nicholson didn't have to constantly fall back on this variation of his persona, but at least he does it well (unlike actors like Pacino who have played variations of themselves for years yet fail to be anything more than an annoying caricature).This film is fun, and I applaud it for embracing an age bracket that is often dismissed in films, especially of this nature (how many senior romantic comedies are out there people?).",4,This film is truly something...,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,2837,"['something', 'pairing', 'over-the-top', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'arrogant', 'sarcastic', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'just', 'time', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Keaton', 'antics', 'can', 'be', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'Nicholson', 'too', 'familiar', 'character', 'development', 'can', 'verge', 'lazy', 'matters', 'together', 'are', 'undeniably', 'entertaining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'sucked', 'chemistry', 'just', 'frame', 'film.', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'one', 'films', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'when', 'dissected', 'really', ""n't"", 'work', 'manages', 'actually', 'WORK', 'thanks', 'combination', 'smart', 'dialog', 'funny', 'performances', 'total', 'chemistry.Erica', 'Barry', 'playwright', 'past', 'bloom', 'who', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'happy', 'being', 'alone', 'daughter', 'Marin', 'dating', 'Harry', 'Sanborn', 'music', 'producer', 'who', 'so', 'full', 'more', 'pathetic', 'confident', 'Harry', 'same', 'age', 'least', 'closer', 'age', 'Erica', 'When', 'series', 'events', 'forces', 'Harry', 'care', 'Erica', 'love', 'starts', 'bloom', 'unexpected', 'area', 'Soon', 'Harry', 'Erica', 'are', 'finding', 'enjoy', 'one', 'soon', 'are', 'giving', 'other', 'ways', 'never', 'imagined', 'possible', 'relationship', 'really', 'meant', 'work', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'script', 'wonderfully', 'start', 'drag', 'third', 'act', 'getting', 'little', 'tiresome', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'problem', 'Meyers', 'work', 'how', 'create', 'something', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'genre', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'so', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'edit', 'very', 'well', 'actually', 'liked', 'plot', 'twist', 'younger', 'doctor', 'falling', 'Erica', 'actually', 'felt', 'usually', 'stiff', 'monotonous', 'Reeves', 'nailed', 'performance', 'drag', 'too', 'long', 'verge', 'unnecessary', 'sad', 'plot', 'point', 'initial', 'stages', 'feels', 'very', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'fact', 'only', 'real', 'complaints', 'film', 'fall', 'scripts', 'final', 'stages.Everything', 'else', 'blend', 'together', 'beautifully.Even', 'film', 'riddles', 'quirks', 'flaws', 'moments', 'just', 'feel', 'SO', 'WRONG', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'one', 'why', 'said', 'film', 'even', 'technically', 'should', ""n't"", 'Keaton', 'Nicholson', 'thrive', 'off', 'one', 'really', 'give', 'audience', 'moneys', 'wish', 'Nicholson', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'constantly', 'fall', 'back', 'variation', 'persona', 'least', 'well', 'actors', 'Pacino', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'variations', 'years', 'yet', 'fail', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'annoying', 'caricature', '.This', 'film', 'fun', 'applaud', 'embracing', 'age', 'bracket', 'often', 'dismissed', 'films', 'especially', 'nature', 'how', 'many', 'senior', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'there', 'people']",N/A

You'll rent it with your girlfriend(s) because you are a fan of Keanu, Jack and/or Diane, because it's a feel-good movie movie and because you have no idea what else to get at the video store.  You will pass a mild evening on the couch with a few giggles and popcorn.Diane Keaton plays accomplished 50 something woman Erica Barry whose grown daughter Marin (Amanda Peet) is dating notorious 60 something bachelor Harry Sandborn (Jack Nicholson).  After a rocky introduction at the family's beach house, Erica and Harry are in a continual state of hostility that in the movies can only mean sexual tension.  Erica is of course idealistically outraged that such an older man is dating her daughter.  The two of them trade snipes and pot shots.  Inevitably, the odd couple are thrown together alone for a few days while Harry recovers from a heart attack.  Harry is impressed with Erica's spirit and intelligence while Erica grudgingly notices that Harry has moments of irrepressible charm.  But now it seems that a love triangle is being set up as his doctor (Keanu Reeves) has ironically started to fall for the much-older Erica.  How will this mess get ironed out?  Hmmmmm.If you're thinking the plot sounds a bit predictable, you'd be right.  The pacing is also a bit slow, the dvd had flaws in its color consistency and there was a general lack of things that would appeal to men in this movie.  Jack and Diane hammed it up a little too much at times.  At the end, I said to myself, ""that was nice"", but promptly forgot about it; not a sign of provocative, cutting edge screenswriting to be sure.I do have to give this movie its props; not many have ever tried to tackle the May/December romance syndrome that is everywhere in Hollywood (which is a particular pet peeve of mine, I might add).  Also, while the performances by the leads were over the top, these stars did make a nice pair with a good chemistry.  There were also some very girly giggly moments.

Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves handle their supporting roles quite well, though the storyline for their characters is not as well written, and Frances McDormand and Jon Favreau are terrific in their small parts but are, unfortunately, underused.The true pleasure of the film lies in the interactions between Keaton and Nicholson, who make you appreciate what good acting is all about, even as they make it look easy.  They are terrific onscreen together.  The film holds together just fine until the last half hour, when the action moves to New York and becomes less intimate, and the ending is much too trite and tidy.

People of a certain age falling in love with someone of or around the right age. The older guy/younger woman thing is turned on it's ear in this film, which was written by Nancy Meyers, she who previously gave us, with her ex-husband Charles, ""What Women Want"", ""Baby Boom"", and both of the ""Father Of Th Bride"" films. Jack Nicholson stars as Harry Sanborn, a 63 year old a socialite who owns ten companies and the second biggest hip hop label. He is famous for being a bachelor, a man who seems to not date women over 30. His latest conquest is Marin, played by Amanda Peet. The two plan on a weekend getaway at her mom's beach house in the Hamptons. Lo and behold, mom, Erica, comes home and everything turns topsy turvy when Harry suffers a heart attack and ends up stayig with Erica while he gets better. What happens is a man coming to realize that he can love, and be attracted to, an older woman. Diane Keaton, who is radiant in this film, is just a treasure. At 57, although it is never made clear of her character's age, since it is only mentioned that she is over 50, she is who she is and is happy with it. She is so wonderful in this film, and she lights up every moment she is in. Thankfully, she is in almost every frame. She has also never looked better. I am young, and I can see where someone younger like Keanu's character(who is a lot older than me)would fall for someone older like Keaton. She gives out such an adorable charm and strong personality, that it would be easy to see why she would be the target of two men. Complicating matters is Keanu Reeves, who plays Harry's young doctor who has designs on Ms. Keaton himself. Amanda Peet, and Frances McDormand, who plays Keaton's sister, do well, but they(especially McDormand)fall out of the loop not long into the film. Nicholson is Nicholson. He is a master and he does what he does with the charm and finesse we would expect. Our two leads are what make this film work. It is solidly written with an intelligent hand and our two stars make it rise to another level that it would never of achieved if it were into someone elses' hands. The dialogue is sharp and the banter between the two is top of the line. The movie does get a little overdone once it starts to reach the 2 hour mark. It is a tad long and could of easily of wrapped up sooner than it did. Still, it does not mar what it is a warm and hilarious and romantic film. The movie is beautifully shot.

Don't let yourself be fooled by the movie's stars, either: Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton's performances are perfect, but there's only so much an actor can do with a one-dimensional character.The beginning, with Nicholson and Diane Keaton's daughter is unengaging, as neither of the characters are compelling, and the situation isn't at all interesting.Cue, then, Diane Keaton, who, boring and unrealistic as she is, is only as uninteresting as her sister--the man-hater--who shows up with her.At this point, you're watching a movie about four characters living together, and you--I, at least--don't like any one of them.Then Keanu Reeves shows up. Keanu Reeves is the worst character in the movie. He plays the rich, smart, congenial doctor (you might think these are ""spoilers,"" but they hardly ruin the movie) who's attracted to Keaton, despite her age, because he loves the way she writes.

But no way did I believe a young woman in her twenties would go out with Jack Nicholson's character because of his personality. Date him because of his fame and wealth, sure, but I'm over forty, and he's too old and jaded for me! In this story, he's a leering louse with women all his life, yet the viewer is required to believe he will change at age 63. And that he will be attractive to the mother of the young woman he has wooed -- when the mother is probably a decade younger than heart attack-prone Jack. Once I suspended disbelief as required by the plot, I did enjoy the ride that this movie took me on. The dialog was good, some of the lines were witty or so true that they brought a wry smile. Diane Keaton is charming and still very attactive as a woman and actor so it was fun to see her onscreen and root for her to be happy. (Loved the scene where she checks Jack's blood pressure.) Jack's comic timing was very good (loved his reaction when he hears about the hazards of taking Viagra, and when he has to tinkle in the hospital). All the supporting characters are fine. The music and scenery are lovely.  I confess that -- for the first time --I found Keanu Reeves romantically appealing. I think that if such a handsome doctor strongly pursued an older woman in real life, she'd likely do just what Mary Tyler Moore did: marry him! He also was just a nicer person than Jack from the beginning of the story. So it was hard for me to accept Diane dumping Keanu for Jack.

I won't give a synopsis since other reviewers have done this adequately, but I'll address the emotional aspects of the film. They pack a wallop.Essentially this is the ultimate chick flick and I doubt many men under 50 (over even over 50), would emphathize or connect here. But for everyone in between, the movie is marvelous, especially in the scenes between Nicholson and Keaton. The supporting characters are unimportant, vague and scarcely worth noting. This includes Keanu Reaves who is attractive but can't hold a candle in sexyness to the overweight and impossibly charming Nicholson. Is there any discerning woman who would choose the hapless Reaves over Jack? Keaton doesn't and we know why. Smart move, Diane. In any case, the supporting cast is a notable weakness in the movie., we well as the superfluous Broadway scenes. If Keaton or Nicholson aren't on screen, head for the popcorn, bathroom or paint your kitchen because you won't be missing anything.The soul of the film is the interplay between Jack and Diane. The sex scene is hilarious, true to life and somehow very touching. The famous pancake scene between the two characters is brilliant stuff, with dialogue that is believable and poignant at the same time.I've always adored Jack but heartily disliked Keaton throughout her ""la de da"" years with Woody Allen. But this film garnered my respect because she holds her own against the towering Nicholson. They might lack sexual chemistry on screen but there's something indefinably sexy about these two together. Go figure!For everyone who has had a great love in their life (or who strives for one), this is a home run.

Jack is fine.  He pretty much plays a 60-something version of himself.  Diane pretty much plays a 50-something version of herself (or is it Annie Hall?).  Only this time she was self-conscious in a way that Annie Hall was not (though Annie Hall was a self-conscious character).  At first I couldn't get over her overly manicured appearance.  That constantly reminded me that this was a fluffy Hollywood movie.  I was waiting for that to pass, hoping things would get better.  I thought they might, because there is a scene when Jack thinks she's crazy for wearing turtlenecks in the summer.  Well, that didn't help things much.  Diane constantly came off as too much of a *character*.  They even gave her a big, schmaltzy dramatic scene that seemed really forced (it was obviously geared for the big Oscar clip, which it did become).The movie had a few decent moments (like when they were instant messaging each other), with a few good lines, but boy did it meander.  And that Amanda Peet was just annoying as the daughter--I couldn't stand her!  (But my complaint there was that she was rather realistic, which is why I couldn't stand her.  The beautiful girl in New York with average intelligence who thinks she's smarter and classier than she really is.  I can't bear another one of those.)  The best piece of casting was Frances McDormand.  She has a rare trait of being not only a great supporting character actress (as she is here), but a great lead actress as well.Perhaps the most annoying thing of all is that this movie, more than any other I can think of, really rubs in your face the double standard we have set for men and women when it comes to looks.  Jack is in his 60s and chubby, yet Diane is in her 50s and rail-thin.  Jack's face is weathered but Diane's face looks surgically enhanced.  Its unintended message seems to be that if the girls want to get work in their 50s, they better look like that.  Meanwhile, they tell the guys not to worry about it.  Because even when they are in their 60s, they'll be fine as long as they stay cool.

It's different than the love of youth, and better, I think: The romance is just as sweet, but richer, with a lifetime of experience swirled around in it.This is a thoughtful and--not a word I'd usually use, but perfect in this case--delightful movie. Jack is indeed his own type, as the movie makes note, which makes this a role seemingly written for him, playing a legendary Lothario forced to consider what he's missed and missing in such a life. A gutsy role for Nicholson, if you think about it, but because he's Jack, you don't. (Well, until later, obviously.)Diane Keaton's always been a background actress for me, someone who's always done good to great work, but whose films and roles have never resonated in memory for me. This one I'll remember. For me it's her best. Her candor onscreen is so real at times it's startling; she seems less to be acting than being caught on film.In the supporting roles, Amanda Peet continues to get better--check out Igby Goes Down for more evidence--and, because I'm a guy, prettier as well. The only false note, not surprisingly, is Keanu Reeves, whose casting is an absolute mystery to me. And as a doctor no less; Joey's Drake Remoray on Friends seems more real. I just don't get how with so many actually good (and more handsome, for that matter) actors available--Ted? The fact that he continues to be cast in roles that require him to emote just further convinces me he's a modern Rasputin.It's a small price to pay, though. This one's worth evening price.

I loved it then and I love it even more now.The plot focuses on Harry (Jack Nicholson), a very cool sixty-something New York bachelor, who serially dates women between the ages of 25 and 30. He does not apologize for his behavior; he simply is this type of person. Or so he thinks.The movie opens with Harry traveling to the Hamptons with yet another piece of eye candy, Marin (Amanda Peet), for a fun, no-strings-attached weekend at her mother's house. The assumption was her mother was staying in the city. But no, before Harry and Marin can consummate their relationship, they stumble upon her mother, the famed playwright Erica Barry (Diane Keaton), and her sister (Frances McDormand). Awkwardness ensues...and even more awkwardness when Harry has a heart attack and Erica is left taking care of him after everyone departs for the city. To complicate matters further, Harry's young stud of a doctor (Keanu Reeves), has fallen for Erica. And so Erica ends up in a romantic triangle with Harry and the doctor.Many wonderful small moments occur in this movie. The supporting characters--Amanda Peet, Frances McDormand, and surprisingly Keanu Reeves--are outstanding. Nancy Meyers, the screenwriter and director, makes sure that everyone realizes that despite their glossy coats, these characters have depth. Harry was at one time engaged to Diane Swayer; Amanda Peet's character is an auctioneer at Christie's; Keanu Reeves is not just a boy toy but a doctor.The lead performance by Keaton and Nicholson are memorable. Diane Keaton shows you humor, intelligence and pain all at the same time. Nicholson allows this character to have depth and to grow beyond his shallow beginnings.The DVD extras are well worth the price. Usually I understand after a viewing, why a deleted scene was cut. However this dvd includes a deleted scene with Nicholson singing &quot;La Vie Rose&quot; at a karaoke bar. He would have been nominated for an Oscar if it had been kept on. Likewise, the two tracks are treasures. On the first track, the director Nancy Meyers (with a little help from Keaton) explores the premise of the movie and the various difficulties during shooting. On the second track, Meyers and Nicholson examine his various acting choices throughout the film. You realize how hard he works and that he's not just being Jack.I would recommend this movie to fans of romantic comedy and of Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson.

In actuality, it's more of a brilliant facade.First of all, the movie could have been pulled off in half the time that it was. I am not usually a person to get restless while watching movies, and after a half hour, I was thinking, 'Is it done yet?' It seemed to drag on and on and on, even though it was just barely over two hours.Secondly, the plot is painfully cliche and utterly predictable. I knew what was going to happen far before it did. The ending would have been much better and much less cliche if Nicholson did not go to Paris (who does that sort of thing?!) and just got over Keaton. I don't know. It was a little too sappy for me.And finally, I could have done without the weird sex scene.

798049,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B0001AVZA8,David Anderson,"[2, 3]","&quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot;, starring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, is a great comedy release of 2003.  Its plot of a playright whose daughter falls in love with an older man, then later develops a relationship of her own with him, is great.  It has many creative hilarious scenes that keep audiences interested.  It gives new meaning of romance after age fifty.  The other added details, namely the characters' past, gives it the additional unique flavor.  Such interesting chain of events keep audience watching closely, always wondering what will happen next, especially through the numerous surprises.  Though a few scenes are unnecessarily repetative, audiences will never forget this.  Diane Keaton's Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated performance is outstanding.  Her presence alone gives the film the added viewing pleasure.  Her own sense of drama and humor is clearly pleasant.  Jack Nicholson is outstanding as he always is.  He proves that he plays the best characters the audiences love to hate.  This film is no exception.  All other actors, especially Amanda Peet, Frances McDormand, and Keanu Reeves, also offer quality performance.  &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; is a great romantic comedy for all ages to enjoy.

Nicholson is a gigantic talent who is totally wasted here, and who I hope profoundly regrets taking the role. The bad boy skirtchasing thing is getting so, so tired. Diane Keaton proves that a woman of advancing years can still be quite stunning and sensual, but she's crippled by a deadly script. The scene everyone talks about (prompted by a studio campaign that centered on it) where Nicholson accidentally sees Keaton nude could, I'm not kidding you, qualify for Worst Acted Scene of the Decade, in which both actors present their characters as if they had their big toes caught in an electrical outlet. Frances McDormand is also on hand, but her work must surely be sitting on a cutting room floor someplace as she's totally irrelevant to the film and if you blink you miss her.

Along comes Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson, 66) in his PJ's or underwear-I forget which--to be discovered behind the opened door of her refrigerator (""Boy Meets Girl--Cute,"" as they say in Hollywood).  Turns out he is dating her twenysomething daughter Marin.  Well, gee, what a guy.However daughter and man about town have not yet consummated their relationship; indeed when they try, Viagra Harry has a heart attack.  And now the plot thickens.  Enter handsome, dashing, young and very eligible Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) who tells Harry that he can't go anywhere yet because they need to keep a close watch on his heart.  So Erica ends up babysitting him.  Ah, yes we can see where this one is going.  Playboy of the Western World finally but finally gives up the young stuff, meets the love of his life (Erica), and falls clumsily, but hopelessly in love with her.For Erica, who hasn't felt a man's touch for lo these many years, it's like electrifying.  Ah, but here's the rub.  The old bachelor can't comprehend his feelings.  After all he has never but never dated anyone over thirty before, and the prospect of COMMITMENT is way scary.  So he demurs, shall we say.  Meanwhile, the dashing young doctor reveals his romantic and clearly carnal interest in--no, NOT the beautiful young daughter!  How prosaic would that be?  No, he reveals he has quite a yen for the great playwright herself, and age does not matter in the slightest!Okay, at this point if I were a woman of any age I would say that my cup doth runneth over.

Apart from the fact that  67 year-old Jack is a little healthier than the heart-attack prone 63 year old lead character in this movie, it could almost be written for him. Perhaps it's not so surprising that the more consistent Diane Keaton gives a good performance, although it's strange to see her playing an older character. That said, the person she plays is an intelligent, vivacious playwright who has (like Keaton herself, but more like writer and director Nancy Myers) aged gracefully into her fifties. The storyline attempts to address the Hollywood clich&eacute; of the older leading man with the younger starlet, something that is seen as much in the private lives of film stars as it is in the movies they appear in. Like many people, I am a little tired of the Conneries, Nicholsons, and even now the Bill Murrays ending up with girlfriends twenty or even thirty years their junior. It stretches credibility and is more than a little sexist. This film addresses this question with a woman who is not only prepared to challenge the status quo, but who almost in spite of herself ends up reversing it. With her younger lover played by a relaxed Keanu Reeves (no doubt relieved to be free of the technical demands of filming the Matrix series), Keaton is believable and sympathetic, even to the extent that we almost want her to end up with Reeves rather than Nicholson.The dialogue is clever, seeming at times like a play, rather than a movie, and this gives the film an economic look which makes you concentrate on the characters. I should say a few words in favour of Amanda Peet, who plays Keaton's daughter. It's a good performance, and she's beautiful, but ultimately, she is just there for plot purposes and you are left feeling that she is a cipher rather than a person.The DVD extras are OK, benefiting from two commentaries, both with Meyers, one also featuring Jack and the other Diane. The studio has put a little more imagination into the extras though, and it is particularly nice to see and hear Jack Nicholson sing. Overall, it's a thought provoking film, but ultimately entertaining, interesting, and quite funny.

And it floated on and on and on and on. . .There's nothing redeeming about Jack Nicholson's character, and the actor plays the role in his usual creepy and disgusting manner.

It illuminates because of the drama and comedy. Diane Keaton's got a nod for Best Actress, quite deservingly so but she gets overdramatic and animated at times. Jack Nicholson doesn't act anymore, he just is the way he is. Well, this role isn't quite as different as his roles in About Scmidth and As Good As It Gets, though he really does it well with that smirk look when his eyes follow Amanda Peet's rear.The plot isn't rocket science though I must say I am more interested in seeing the Keaton-Reeves romance blossom. Reeves lands his most likeable and accomplished role as a doctor who falls for the older woman in the movie. Well, who would have thought he could handle something like this? He's really good as an admirer of Keaton's character. The best scene must be when both younger and older men saw in awe Keaton's character come out of the room in a stunning black dress. Another overlooked performance must be that of Oscar winner Frances McDormand. Her performance in the first 15 minutes already lends much support to Diane Keaton's neurtoic older woman role. She's about as quirky and witty as she can get but then the movie isn't on her. She just shows a nice contrast opposite Keaton.Overall, it's a cloying feel-good movie that will go down with most.

Diane Keaton portrayed Erica Barry, a famous playwright who has been divorced for a few years and never thought she would be involved with another man again.Sanborn is dating much younger Marin Barry (Amanda Peet), Erica's daughter, and the two opt for two days of nooky at her mother's house in The Hamptons.  When Erica and her other daughter stumble upon Sanborn in his boxers raiding the fridge, they're surprised to learn that this much older guy is Marin's boyfriend.  Thus begins the adventure.After Harry and Marin go into the bedroom for a little fun, Harry suffers a heart attack.  He's ordered to take it easy for a while and his doctor, Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) orders him to stay in the vicinity of the hospital in order to keep tabs on him.  Erica's house just so happens to be in the vicinity.While Marin enjoys the nightlife, Harry recoups at her mother's house and, while sitting around, has nothing better to do than strike up conversation with Erica.  They discover they are curious to know more about the other but just won't admit to it.  The daughter sees the chemistry and gets out of the way (although she realizes that Harry broke up with her and not the other way around).In the meantime, much younger Dr. Mercer takes an interest in Erica and she goes from a lonely divorcee to an older woman in the middle of two mens' affection (and I think Reeves was charming in his role).Like another reviewer, I was thrown for a loop when it seemed that Harry and Erica were getting along great and then, boom, she's all of a sudden pissed at him because she sees him in a restaurant with another woman (whom he, typically, refers to as a ""friend"").He admits that he's not a good ""boyfriend"" and Erica is devastated.  She channels her hurt by sobbing uncontrollably and completing her autobiographical play, basing it on her experiences with Harry - which he doesn't find out about until a (young) actress he's wining and dining explains the premise.  Feeling insulted, he confronts Erica, explaining that ""...schmucks are people, too"" and she wants to go forward as friends.Fast forward: Harry retires to the Caribbean for a whole 2 weeks and seeks out his former girlfriends who inform him what kind of a jerk he's been to them.  He travels the farthest to Paris to see Erica (remembering her favorite resturant there) and just when you think they might end up together, in comes Dr. Mercer who proposes.  Erica accepts and one thinks that they may end up together and leave Harry in the cold.  Not so.How Dr. Mercer got out of the way was a little too easy (more conflict?) but Harry and Erica wound up together (and married) after all.And Diane Keaton parle franais tr&egrave;s bien (and from what I could hear on my TV, Jack ain't too shabby himself).Refreshing premise that proves women aren't obliged to sit at home and roll up into a ball for the remainder of eternity just because they're over 25.",5,Refreshing to see the guy feel inadequate for a change,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,3080,"['Jack', 'Nicholson', 'portrayed', '63', 'year-old', 'Harry', 'Sanborn', 'owner', 'rap', 'record', 'company', 'who', 'only', 'younger', 'women', 'yes', 'fiction', 'can', 'mirror', 'truth', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'portrayed', 'Erica', 'Barry', 'famous', 'playwright', 'who', 'been', 'divorced', 'few', 'years', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'involved', 'man', 'again.Sanborn', 'dating', 'much', 'younger', 'Marin', 'Barry', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Erica', 'daughter', 'two', 'opt', 'two', 'days', 'nooky', 'mother', 'house', 'Hamptons', 'When', 'Erica', 'other', 'daughter', 'stumble', 'Sanborn', 'boxers', 'raiding', 'fridge', ""'re"", 'surprised', 'learn', 'much', 'older', 'guy', 'Marin', 'boyfriend', 'Thus', 'adventure.After', 'Harry', 'Marin', 'go', 'bedroom', 'little', 'fun', 'Harry', 'heart', 'attack', 'ordered', 'take', 'easy', 'while', 'doctor', 'Dr.', 'Julian', 'Mercer', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'orders', 'stay', 'vicinity', 'hospital', 'order', 'keep', 'tabs', 'Erica', 'house', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'vicinity.While', 'Marin', 'nightlife', 'Harry', 'recoups', 'mother', 'house', 'sitting', 'around', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'Erica', 'discover', 'are', 'curious', 'know', 'more', 'other', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', 'daughter', 'chemistry', 'way', 'Harry', 'broke', 'up', 'not', 'other', 'way', '.In', 'meantime', 'much', 'younger', 'Dr.', 'Mercer', 'interest', 'Erica', 'lonely', 'divorcee', 'older', 'woman', 'middle', 'two', 'mens', 'affection', 'think', 'Reeves', 'was', 'charming', 'role', 'reviewer', 'was', 'thrown', 'loop', 'when', 'seemed', 'Harry', 'Erica', 'were', 'getting', 'along', 'great', 'then', 'boom', 'sudden', 'pissed', 'restaurant', 'woman', 'whom', 'typically', 'refers', 'friend', '.He', 'admits', 'not', 'good', 'boyfriend', 'Erica', 'devastated', 'channels', 'hurt', 'sobbing', 'uncontrollably', 'completing', 'autobiographical', 'play', 'basing', 'experiences', 'Harry', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'about', 'young', 'wining', 'dining', 'premise', 'Feeling', 'insulted', 'Erica', 'explaining', 'schmucks', 'are', 'people', 'too', 'go', 'forward', 'friends.Fast', 'forward', 'Harry', 'Caribbean', 'whole', '2', 'weeks', 'out', 'former', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'inform', 'what', 'kind', 'jerk', 'been', 'farthest', 'Paris', 'see', 'Erica', 'remembering', 'favorite', 'resturant', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'Dr.', 'Mercer', 'who', 'Erica', 'one', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'leave', 'Harry', 'cold', 'Not', 'so.How', 'Dr.', 'Mercer', 'got', 'way', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'more', 'conflict', 'Harry', 'Erica', 'wound', 'up', 'together', 'married', 'all.And', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'franais', 'tr', 'egrave', 's', 'bien', 'what', 'could', 'hear', 'TV', 'Jack', 'ai', ""n't"", 'too', 'shabby', '.Refreshing', 'premise', 'women', 'are', ""n't"", 'obliged', 'sit', 'home', 'roll', 'up', 'ball', 'remainder', 'eternity', 'just', ""'re"", '25']",N/A

He hs a wonderful sense of humour, great charm, wit and repartee plus charisma and Mr. Midnight which is what he calls his manhood. Harry is every old playboy's dream incarnate. Yes, it is true, ladies don't just fall head over heels in love with a guy for only his macho muscles. The character must have been based in part on Hugh Hefner.Enter Marin, a young, nubile, sexy, juicy woman hearing 30 who just happens to be an auctioneer at Christies' New York. They go off for a romantic weekend to her Mom's house in the Hamptons, Southampton to be exact. All the people in this movie are rich and famous, you see. Suddenly, before thay get to make love, Mom in the person of Diane Keaton as Erica appears with her cynical sister Zoe. Zoe pulls a knife on Harry (Nicholson) in his boxer shorts and Erica threatens to have him arrested. Lo and behold, enter the fair Marin in a black bikini that almost gave me a heart attack. I had to calm myself with a glass of Chateauneuf-du-Pape 2000. Yes, they look after you well in Business Class of Air France. They all calm down after Erica gets over the shock of seeing her daughter in love with an older man, and all 4 spend the weekend in the huge luxurious house. Erica is a divorced, lonely, neurotic, sexually repressed famous writer and playwright.... and abruptly while they hear the sensual sounds of Marvin Gaye music and the oohs and aahs of Harry and Marin fooling around...Marin screams in panic,""Mom!!!"" This is where the fun begins as Harry has had a heart attack while trying to smooch Marin. I don't blame him. The great scene which had me laughing in stitches is where Erica wants to give Harry mouth to mouth resuscitaion and he gesticulates NO NO! She does it anyway and saves his life.Eternal triangles abound in this movie. Keanu Reeves as handsome Dr. Julian has a thing for older women like Erica and falls in love with her while inevitably, the hate-hate relationship between Harry and Erica becomes Love-hate and then Love-Love. The scene where they discuss the birds and the bees in the bedroom is hilariously sexy as Harry gets to remove her white polo neck with her gold scissors on her command, no less. The orgasm scene is so terrifically hilarious too and yet strangely true to life. Erica says much much later, ""I loove S____"" and Harry, totally exhausted exclaims, ""You certainly do!"" The lines and dialogue are so witty and funny, and they are really smooth, slick actors with perfect timing and super confident delivery of their lines. The final scene in Paris is so romantic. I love Paris in the springtime and most any time, and the scenes of Paris and the lovely river Seine are superb. The food scenes in the restuarant Le Colbert behind the Palais Royale are so perfectly filmed especially where the birthday cake arrives for Erica's birthday in February in Paris. I know a lot about restaurants as I'm The Travelling Gourmet and I write and broadcast on Food, Travel and Wine all over the world. The crying or rather howling scenes where Erica goes hysterical and into a nervous breakdown when she realises that Harry doen't want a long term relationship but just a quick roll in the hay, are sad yet funny, which is incredibly entertaining. She becomes inspired to write a hit Broadway play where she lampoons and lambasts Harry and their relationship to great effect. The scene where her tear drops on to the keyboard of her laptop while she types furiously is very touching. It brought tears to my eyes too.The ending is really cute and I love the cute baby. A superb movie with a great story and wonderful acting. Filmed on location in New York, Paris and Southhampton, I liked this movie very much and watching it made the long flight so much shorter. Go see it soon and leave the movie theater Happy!

798074,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0001AVZA8,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[6, 7]","""Something's Gotta Give"" was directed by Nancy Meyers, who gave us ""What Women Want."" The common factor between the two films are that they are both about how men treat women. In this case, it is how an older man would treat a younger women, or vice versa. Or, that is how I thought of it as. Jack Nicolson and Diane Keaton star, and Keaton has a performace that is Oscar worthy all the way. I felt that way even before the nominations came out, and I still feel that way. I saw the film twice already, and have decided to voice my mind over it now.Jack Nicolson stars as Harry Sandborn, the owner of a successful hip hop label, and a person who dates women under 30. The only thing is, he is 63. His newest girlfriend is Marin, and the two go off to her mothers beach house for the weekend. It is supposed to be empty, so the two are surprised when Marin's mother Erika, and her sister Zoe show up. Erika is a playwright who wants to come for the peace and quiet so that she could write. She instantly doesn't approve of her daughter's relationship with Harry. The four decide to stay at the house, untill Harry has a sudden heart attack. The doctor helping him, Julian Mercer, is a big fan of Erika's work. But when releasing Harry, he falls onto the ground, causing Julian to not let him travel for a couple of days. The only place for him to stay is the beach house, and that does not sit well with Erika. When Marin returns to work, Erika and Harry find themselves alone with each other, and complete opposites. But as they are alone, they relize that they have much more in common than they thought. And when Marin and Harry break up, romantic feelings begin to develop between Harry and Erika, but problems arise when it becomes clear that Julian wants to become involved with Erika, and Harry does not want to switch his lifestyle when it comes to women.The only reason that I gave ""Something's Gotta Give"" four stars was because of the last few scenes. I don't want to ruin what happens, but I don't feel that it should have ended the way it did. It started as a great, orignal, hilarious comedy, and then by the end just became another one of those predictable comedies that stick with a formula. That's why I liked the beginning. It wasn't formula. But the end was. Although it only got four stars, I do consider ""Something's Gotta Give"" one of the most notable films of last year, and it was a good enough movie to see in the theatres, and see more then once. I really did like it, and Keaton should get an Oscar.

798075,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0001AVZA8,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 5]","There's a great scene on the beach between Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, which seems almost improvised, where they talk about his reputation for non-commitment and her supposed non-date with his doctor. Ironically it feels like a scene from ""Annie Hall"", and this mostly charming movie could have done with more seemingly spontaneous moments like this. But director/screenwriter Nancy Meyers (""What Women Want"", the ""Parent Trap"" remake) is borne out of the packaged Hollywood filmmaking that finds double-takes and double-entendres suitable replacements for insightful wit in a formulaic romantic comedy. Luckily, as embodied by the two veteran actors, the characters do not come off as menopausal stereotypes like some pre-""Golden Pond"", sunset-gazing couple. True, there are some serious sitcom lapses in Meyers' script, and it does lack the uniquely quirky perspective of a James Brooks in the similar feeling ""As Good As it Gets"". For the most part, however, this is quite a step up for Meyers, a refreshing look at the emotional complications that come with love among the more mature set. What is particularly nice is how sex is treated as an emotional release rather than just an act of pure passion.Nicholson plays womanizing record producer Harry Sanborn like most of his late-career roles, i.e., with a sense of eye-rolling panache that somehow gets dismantled when his character reveals too much of his vulnerability. It's probably the unsurprising aspect of his acting that allows Keaton to steal the movie from him. Looking svelte and unapologetic for her age, she brings a lovely sense of gravity to her role of successful playwright Erica Barry, a familiar type who lives in a Pottery Barn-furnished world and has rationalized love out of her life. Keaton has a great honest moment when her character reveals her true feelings outside the restaurant where she catches him on a date after their own tryst. The film somehow loses footing after this scene, as this last portion feels like the story is marking time until the plot strands eventually sort themselves out to the inevitable ending.The film looks good in a ""Metropolitan Home"" sort of way, and the supporting cast is quite capable and serviceable. Keanu Reeves is surprisingly believable as the lovelorn doctor smitten with Keaton's character, but he is given short shrift by the script and comes off ultimately as a plot device. On the other hand, Amanda Peet comes across as alternately bright and flighty, a fetching combination, as Erica's daughter. Sadly underutilized as usual, Frances McDormand steals all her scenes as Erica's sister. Someday she will hopefully repeat her success with ""Fargo"" and get a meatier role deserving of her smart talent and saucy sense of humor. And even more hopefully, perhaps this movie will provide a springboard for other older-skewed romantic comedies given our country's aging demographics...but who am I kidding?",4,Love Among the Ruins...Hardly,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,2933,"['great', 'scene', 'beach', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'almost', 'improvised', 'where', 'talk', 'reputation', 'non-commitment', 'supposed', 'non-date', 'doctor', 'Ironically', 'scene', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'mostly', 'charming', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'seemingly', 'spontaneous', 'moments', 'director/screenwriter', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'remake', 'borne', 'packaged', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking', 'double-takes', 'double-entendres', 'suitable', 'replacements', 'insightful', 'wit', 'formulaic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Luckily', 'embodied', 'two', 'veteran', 'actors', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'menopausal', 'stereotypes', 'pre-', 'Golden', 'Pond', 'sunset-gazing', 'couple', 'True', 'are', 'serious', 'sitcom', 'lapses', 'Meyers', 'script', 'lack', 'uniquely', 'quirky', 'perspective', 'James', 'Brooks', 'similar', 'feeling', 'As', 'Good', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'quite', 'step', 'up', 'Meyers', 'refreshing', 'look', 'emotional', 'complications', 'come', 'love', 'more', 'mature', 'set', 'What', 'particularly', 'nice', 'how', 'sex', 'treated', 'emotional', 'release', 'rather', 'just', 'act', 'pure', 'passion.Nicholson', 'womanizing', 'record', 'producer', 'Harry', 'Sanborn', 'most', 'late-career', 'roles', 'i.e.', 'sense', 'eye-rolling', 'panache', 'somehow', 'dismantled', 'when', 'character', 'reveals', 'too', 'much', 'vulnerability', 'probably', 'unsurprising', 'aspect', 'acting', 'Keaton', 'steal', 'movie', 'Looking', 'svelte', 'unapologetic', 'age', 'lovely', 'sense', 'gravity', 'role', 'successful', 'playwright', 'Erica', 'Barry', 'familiar', 'type', 'who', 'Pottery', 'Barn-furnished', 'world', 'rationalized', 'life', 'Keaton', 'great', 'honest', 'moment', 'when', 'character', 'true', 'feelings', 'restaurant', 'where', 'date', 'own', 'tryst', 'film', 'somehow', 'footing', 'scene', 'last', 'portion', 'feels', 'story', 'marking', 'time', 'plot', 'eventually', 'sort', 'out', 'inevitable', 'ending.The', 'film', 'good', 'Metropolitan', 'Home', 'sort', 'way', 'supporting', 'cast', 'quite', 'capable', 'serviceable', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'surprisingly', 'believable', 'lovelorn', 'doctor', 'smitten', 'Keaton', 'character', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'script', 'off', 'ultimately', 'plot', 'device', 'other', 'hand', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'alternately', 'bright', 'flighty', 'fetching', 'combination', 'Erica', 'daughter', 'Sadly', 'underutilized', 'usual', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'scenes', 'Erica', 'sister', 'Someday', 'will', 'hopefully', 'repeat', 'success', 'Fargo', 'get', 'meatier', 'role', 'deserving', 'smart', 'talent', 'saucy', 'sense', 'humor', 'even', 'more', 'hopefully', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'will', 'provide', 'springboard', 'other', 'older-skewed', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'given', 'country', 'aging', 'demographics', 'who', 'am', 'kidding']",N/A

798078,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B0001AVZA8,Emily Todd,"[1, 1]","""Something's Gotta Give"" is one of the sweetest, funniest, and most romantic films of the year.  Boasting a to-die-for cast of Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, Keanu Reeves, Frances McDormand, and Amanda Peet, director/script writer Nancy Meyers makes good use of her cast.  The screenplay is witty, funny (with plenty of laugh out loud moments), touching, romantic, and very entertaining.  ""Something's Gotta Give"" also reaffirms Diane Keaton's status as one of the most charming and beautiful ""mature"" actress working in Hollywood right now.Jack Nicholson plays Harry Langer, an aged music industry executive with a preference for younger women.  In fact, he has yet to date a woman even 15 years younger than him. Marin (Peet) is his latest trophy of a girlfriend and is young, bouncy, and lively.  Harry feels that the only way he can stay young is to date younger women.  As this is a social issue nowadays, I found it especially interesting when this was heatedly debated at the beginning of the film.Getting back to the plot, Harry is staying with Marin at her mother's (Keaton) beach house for the weekend in the Hamptons.  Thinking that her mother, Erica, will be away, Harry and Marin start getting a little, err, playful.  Things get a little awkward when it turns out that Erica is home and will be staying with them the whole weekend.  As any good mother should, she disapproves of her daughter's relationship with Harry, a man who is her own age!Things get even more uncomfortable when Harry suffers a heart attack and is left in the care of Erica and his doctor (Reeves).  To make things even more interesting, the much younger doctor, Julian, has a thing for Erica.  You an only imagine what happens next.Let me just say I was pleasantly surprised with the wit of this film.  I was not expecting to find myself gasping for air during one of the funniest scenes in the movie; when Harry is stumbling around the hospital in nothing but a hospital gown and we see a little more of him than we would have liked...The only thing holding ""Something's Gotta Give"" back from being a 5-star movie is the rather slow-moving final act.  I understand that it is difficult to maintain the momentum towards the end of a romantic comedy and that there has to be some agonizing soul searching/romance at the end, but it does slow the film down.

When you have fine actors, pretty locations, and a romantic fantasy you overlook the insubstantial story and unbelievable ending.  Something's Gotta Give with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton is pleasant, but not as good as As Good as It Gets, where Nicholson and Helen Hunt play sometimes unpleasant people with real problems who make a way out of loneliness for themselves.  In Something's Gotta Give the way out falls into their laps without either having to make a hard choice.  As another of Keaton's directors said, it's a &quot;Hollywood Ending.&quot;Jack Nicholson is Harry, a rich sixty-three-year-old who dates only young women and takes Viagra to help Mr. Midnight get ready.  When Harry's latest young thing brings him to her mother's house in the Hamptons,  Harry (1) has a heart attack, (2) finds he can love someone older and not need Viagra, and (3) has to decide whether to change his life.  Just as Harry realizes the good things about older women, Erica (Keaton) discovers the joys of younger men.  Harry's doctor (Keanu Reeves) falls for Erica's body and her mind.The music is great, from hip-hop to Marvin Gaye.  Frances McDormand singing and moving to &quot;Let's Get It On&quot; (which could have been the title of the movie) is one of the highlights of the film.

FINALLY we're getting movies about women who are not only beautiful but are intelligent and definite candidates for the roles of desirable leading ladies.  Diane Keaton is a joy to watch - not only because she is beautiful but also because she is such an enormously gifted actor.  Yes, the director could have put the reigns on her 'post-transformation' crying at the loss of love; that does get tiresome.  But watch the way Keaton responds as a mother to Amanda Peet, as a sister to the always superb Frances McDormand, as a gradual paramour of an aging (well cast and well performed) Jack Nicholson, and as an incredulous recipient of the honest attractions of the younger Keanu Reeves.  In each mode of her role she is not only credible, she takes us with her on a wise (and wise-cracking) journey into new territory.The openness of dealing with issues of the 'over 50 crowd' in career changes, love lost and love gained, and frank sexuality is such a relief from the norm and it is to the credit of Nancy Meyers that she continues to explore this realm (see ""What Women Want"").  Meyers manages to tell her tales of older romantic episodes without showing prejudice to either men or women.This is a well written (at least for the first 3/4s of the film) and well directed (ditto) funny yet tender comedy that shows off the talents of the five leads very well indeed.

She is an Athena woman , gifted with sparkling intelligence , dear prudence and necessary wisdom . But it seems to reach that vertex is not enough . It can not be  .

He represents the mirror male image of Aphrodite . He is a refined man and above all a  powerful personality with charm and discretion he conquers all the possible women . The modern version of the Casanova : the yuppie version of Don Giovanni .In the third corner we have to Amanda Pet an inhibited girl of these times .

He hasn't got a stable relationship in his social circle . so he watches in Keaton the blind side of Nicholson . He observes in Keaton the happy blending of the experience and the passion .

A very smart script , pleasant dialogues and fine humour with a lovely homage to Casablanca : We will always have Paris .Curiously Diane Keaton made the whole cycle .

798097,AYBBGS1NYXG8B,B0001AVZA8,"jadedromantic ""jadedromantic""","[2, 3]","Diane Keaton is one of the best actors working.  She's very much a throwback to Hollywood's Golden Era, in that her style and look and talent are her own.  She's sort of a Katharine Hepburn/Claudette Colbert mix -- sweet, funny, and very much her own woman.  I had the honor, when I lived in Los Angeles, of running into her at Book Soup on Sunset Boulevard, and she's also a very nice, gracious lady.She was the main reason I saw ""Something's Gotta Give"" -- although I am a Jack Nicholson fan, as well -- and is the main reason I gave the film 4 stars here.  Diane Keaton plays Erica Barry, a successful Broadway playwright who seemingly has it all:  wealth, beauty, career success, a charming home in the country, and a beautiful daughter named Marin (Amanda Peet).  She's even managed to maintain a decent working relationship with her ex-husband (welcome back Paul Michael Glaser!), a director who works with her on her plays.In fact, the one thing Erica doesn't seem to have is a man.  And she's okay with this, until a getaway to the country with her sister Zoe (the under-utilized Frances McDormand) finds Erica sharing her beach house with her daughter Marin -- and Marin's new boyfriend, 63-year-old music mogul Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson).  When Harry has a mild heart attack and has to recuperate at the beach house, he sets about making Erica NUTS with his attitudes about women (he only dates young ones -- ONLY), and in general disrupts her peaceful, bland existence when she finds herself attracted to him, as well.Add to this the fact that Harry's doctor (played by the bland-as-butter Keanu Reeves, who's supposed to be 36 years old here - ??) has the super-mega-hots for Erica, having seen all her plays, and you have the beginnings of a romantic triangle that (on some levels) is kind of hard to believe, yet somehow works.The performances in this film are good all the way 'round, with Keaton and Nicholson standing out, and it's FANTASTIC to see a romantic comedy that features main players who are middle-aged, instead of Hollywood's usual demographic of having characters only in their 20's or 30's.  Whenever Keaton and Nicholson are together on the screen the movie is DYNAMITE -- these two have great chemistry -- and even Amanda Peet holds her own well in her scenes with each of the stars (especially Nicholson).I just feel the movie sort of faded out in its second half.  Keanu Reeves got on my nerves; that whole younger-man subplot would have been MUCH more believable with a better actor in the role.  And though Keaton's ""sobbing"" was a bit much for me after awhile, I understood it; unlike another reviewer here who blasted it as unreal after her charater only went through a ""one-night stand,"" I understood that Eric didn't see it as a one-night stand -- and Harry had been living in her home for over a week when it happened, so it was NOT a one-night stand, just sex that happened only one time between two people who had come to know each other a little.The ending was a bit too cutesy, but overall I loved the movie, just for the performances.  Somehow, I wish Frances McDormand had been given more to do -- and Keanu Reeves less to do -- but the film was a very real look at the age-old curiosity that older men dating young women is okay ... while older women dating young men is still seen as a bit more ""dirty"" --and it's played with class by all, particularly Keaton and Nicholson, who need to do another film together; their chemistry is THAT strong.",4,"Ms. Keaton, as usual, my hat's off to you ...",1082764800,"04 24, 2004",2004,3498,"['Diane', 'Keaton', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'very', 'much', 'throwback', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Era', 'style', 'look', 'talent', 'are', 'own', 'sort', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn/Claudette', 'Colbert', 'mix', 'sweet', 'funny', 'very', 'much', 'own', 'woman', 'had', 'honor', 'when', 'lived', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'running', 'Book', 'Soup', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'gracious', 'lady.She', 'was', 'main', 'reason', 'saw', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'am', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'reason', 'gave', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'here', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Erica', 'Barry', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'playwright', 'who', 'seemingly', 'wealth', 'beauty', 'career', 'success', 'charming', 'home', 'country', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'named', 'Marin', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'even', 'managed', 'maintain', 'decent', 'working', 'relationship', 'ex-husband', 'welcome', 'back', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Glaser', 'director', 'who', 'plays.In', 'fact', 'one', 'thing', 'Erica', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'man', 'okay', 'getaway', 'country', 'sister', 'Zoe', 'under-utilized', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Erica', 'sharing', 'beach', 'house', 'daughter', 'Marin', 'Marin', 'new', 'boyfriend', '63-year-old', 'music', 'mogul', 'Harry', 'Sanborn', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'When', 'Harry', 'mild', 'heart', 'attack', 'recuperate', 'beach', 'house', 'making', 'Erica', 'NUTS', 'attitudes', 'women', 'only', 'young', 'ones', 'ONLY', 'general', 'disrupts', 'peaceful', 'bland', 'existence', 'when', 'attracted', 'well.Add', 'fact', 'Harry', 'doctor', 'played', 'bland-as-butter', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', '36', 'years', 'old', 'here', 'super-mega-hots', 'Erica', 'having', 'seen', 'plays', 'have', 'beginnings', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'levels', 'kind', 'hard', 'believe', 'yet', 'somehow', 'works.The', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'good', 'way', 'Keaton', 'Nicholson', 'standing', 'out', 'FANTASTIC', 'see', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'main', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'middle-aged', 'instead', 'Hollywood', 'usual', 'demographic', 'having', 'characters', 'only', '20', '30', 'Whenever', 'Keaton', 'Nicholson', 'are', 'together', 'screen', 'movie', 'DYNAMITE', 'two', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'even', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'own', 'well', 'scenes', 'stars', 'especially', 'Nicholson', '.I', 'just', 'feel', 'movie', 'sort', 'faded', 'out', 'second', 'half', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'got', 'nerves', 'whole', 'younger-man', 'subplot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'MUCH', 'more', 'believable', 'better', 'actor', 'role', 'Keaton', 'sobbing', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'awhile', 'understood', 'reviewer', 'here', 'who', 'blasted', 'unreal', 'charater', 'only', 'went', 'one-night', 'stand', 'understood', 'Eric', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one-night', 'stand', 'Harry', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'home', 'week', 'when', 'happened', 'was', 'NOT', 'one-night', 'stand', 'just', 'sex', 'happened', 'only', 'one', 'time', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'know', 'other', 'little.The', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'cutesy', 'overall', 'loved', 'movie', 'just', 'performances', 'Somehow', 'wish', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'do', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'less', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'look', 'age-old', 'curiosity', 'older', 'men', 'dating', 'young', 'women', 'okay', 'older', 'women', 'dating', 'young', 'men', 'still', 'seen', 'bit', 'more', 'dirty', 'played', 'class', 'particularly', 'Keaton', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'need', 'do', 'film', 'together', 'chemistry', 'strong']",N/A

I thought Diane Keaton looked great, and one can never get enough of Jack Nicholson misbehaving.  However, Keaton's character is the typical older woman who is bitter and resentful of men her age who show interest only in the younger woman. Her character never shows any such resentment towards those younger women themselves, nor does she acknowledge that she has actually raised a daughter who has turned into one of those younger women dating an older man. That sort of irony seems to be lost on Keaton's character. Perhaps she might admit, also, that if she had made better decisions about men when she was younger then she wouldn't be alone when she was older. Or perhaps the movie should just preach a tad bit less about how men are evil for liking younger women but how there's not a single thing wrong with younger women liking older men. These types of romantic comedies, and by type I mean totally unrealistic, idealistic misrepresentations, do more harm than good because they further exacerbate the already hugely problematic and offensive belief that anything wrong that's ever been done has been done so by a man.

Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, a superb supporting cast and writer-director Nancy Meyers have provided entertainment at its best with &quot;Something's Gotta Give.&quot; (I hate the movie's title, though. Surely someone could have come up with something more apt and original).Harry Sanborn, (Nicholson), a 63 year-old music industry mogul, is a renowned bachelor who prefers his women under 30 and gorgeous. He is allergic to commitment - the word is not even in his vocabulary. Erica Barry is a 50-something divorcee and a super successful playwright. Her daughter, 20-something Marin, (lovely Amanda Peet), brings her latest lover (Sanborn), to their Hamptons summer home for the weekend and  - Surprise(!) - finds Mommy home too. The interaction and verbal sparring between the 4, (including Aunt Zoe, played by Frances McDormand as Keaton's feminist sister), is a riot. Unfortunately Harry's hard living catches up with him during this, of all weekends, and he has a heart attack. Keaton saves him with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. And hunky Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) forces him to remain at the Barry home to recuperate. Then the fun really begins.The combination of Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson is an absolute joyous one. Two great actors, with plenty of chemistry between them, are at their best - they sizzle! As do Keanu Reeves and Keaton. She gets all the great guys...deservedly so. The script is witty, the dialogue is acerbic...and tender at times. The characters have depth and room to grow - which they certainly do. There may be some weak moments - the ending is slightly schmaltzy, but I loved it anyway and wouldn't have wanted it any other way.So, if you're in the mood for a good flick that will make you laugh and touch your heart - this is the one.

798112,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0001AVZA8,Joe Sherry,"[1, 1]","A film by Nancy MeyersThere is a film stereotype where there is an older man who has a relationship with a much younger woman.  In the majority of the cases with an age discrepancy, it is the man with a younger woman and not the other way around.  There are exceptions, of course, but this is accurate as a general rule.  ""Something's Gotta Give"" messes with that stereotype a little bit (and, unfortunately, only a little).  Harry (Jack Nicholson) is the older man.  He is a top executive at a record company and he is legendary for his propensity to date younger women.  He is also legendary for never having been married.  His current fling is with Marin (Amanda Peet).  She is the ""younger woman"".  Harry and Marin plan on spending a weekend together at Marin's mother's home.  The mother is supposed to be away for the weekend working on her new play.This means, of course, that Marin's mother will show up and complicate the weekend.  That is exactly what happens.  Marin's mother Erica (Diane Keaton) and her aunt Zoe (Frances McDormand) show up just as Harry is downstairs in the kitchen (wearing only a shirt and underpants) getting something to eat.  Naturally, the women freak out and are about to call the police on Harry when he is finally able to explain, with the help of Marin, who he is and why he is there.  They all decide to act like rational adults and all spend the weekend at the house, but to keep out of each other's business.  It wouldn't be much of a movie if that happened.  When Harry and Marin are starting to get frisky one night, Harry has a heart attack (he is a 63 year old man, after all).  They all rush to the hospital and his doctor, Julian (Keanu Reeves), helps save Harry.  Julian also insists that Harry cannot return to the city and will only let him leave the hospital if he has somewhere to stay.  Where might that be?  Erica's house.  Just as this happens, Marin and Zoe both leave and Erica is left to care for Harry, and she didn't even approve of him in the first place.This is the movie.  Erica and Harry begin as two people who do not really like each other and are certainly not interested in each other.  Erica finds Harry to be disgusting and Harry has never been attracted to a woman his own age (at least not since he was in his 20's).  Julian, on the other hand, is familiar with Erica's work as a playwright and he is attracted to Erica.  In this instance, we have a younger man falling for an older woman.  But...the movie is about Harry and his journey, so we know that Harry must get over his obsession with younger women and we know that he is going to start to become attracted to a woman his own age.On one hand, it is nice to see an older man begin to be attracted to an older woman, especially when he is giving up a younger woman (in this case, the older woman's daughter), but I started to care more about Erica's journey because we knew exactly where Harry was going to end up and I wanted something different.  This was a very standard (if well acted) movie that could very easily have given a twist to make ""Something's Gotta Give"" special.  Let's be honest, and I'll ask the women who are reading this: Ladies, would you rather have Jack or Keanu?  This movie could have been a whole lot more and could have really played with the convention and expectation that this movie was bringing, but it didn't.  At nearly every moment, we know how this film is going to play out, and I was hoping for more.  With that said, ""Something's Gotta Give"" is well acted, and well produced, but it is nothing out of the ordinary, either.-Joe Sherry",4,"well acted, but a very standard, ordinary movie",1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,3603,"['film', 'Nancy', 'MeyersThere', 'film', 'stereotype', 'where', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'relationship', 'much', 'younger', 'woman', 'majority', 'cases', 'age', 'discrepancy', 'man', 'younger', 'woman', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'are', 'exceptions', 'course', 'accurate', 'general', 'rule', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'little', 'bit', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'little', 'Harry', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'older', 'man', 'top', 'executive', 'record', 'company', 'legendary', 'propensity', 'date', 'younger', 'women', 'also', 'legendary', 'never', 'having', 'been', 'married', 'current', 'fling', 'Marin', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'younger', 'woman', 'Harry', 'Marin', 'plan', 'spending', 'weekend', 'together', 'Marin', 'mother', 'home', 'mother', 'supposed', 'be', 'away', 'weekend', 'working', 'new', 'play.This', 'course', 'Marin', 'mother', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'complicate', 'weekend', 'exactly', 'what', 'Marin', 'mother', 'Erica', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'aunt', 'Zoe', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'show', 'up', 'just', 'Harry', 'downstairs', 'kitchen', 'wearing', 'only', 'shirt', 'underpants', 'getting', 'something', 'eat', 'Naturally', 'women', 'freak', 'are', 'call', 'police', 'Harry', 'when', 'finally', 'able', 'explain', 'help', 'Marin', 'who', 'why', 'there', 'decide', 'act', 'rational', 'adults', 'spend', 'weekend', 'house', 'keep', 'other', 'business', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'movie', 'happened', 'When', 'Harry', 'Marin', 'are', 'starting', 'get', 'frisky', 'one', 'night', 'Harry', 'heart', 'attack', '63', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'rush', 'hospital', 'doctor', 'Julian', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'save', 'Harry', 'Julian', 'also', 'Harry', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'city', 'will', 'only', 'let', 'leave', 'hospital', 'somewhere', 'stay', 'Where', 'might', 'be', 'Erica', 'house', 'Just', 'Marin', 'Zoe', 'leave', 'Erica', 'left', 'care', 'Harry', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'approve', 'first', 'place.This', 'movie', 'Erica', 'Harry', 'begin', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'other', 'are', 'certainly', 'not', 'interested', 'other', 'Erica', 'Harry', 'be', 'disgusting', 'Harry', 'never', 'been', 'attracted', 'woman', 'own', 'age', 'least', 'not', 'was', '20', 'Julian', 'other', 'hand', 'familiar', 'Erica', 'work', 'playwright', 'attracted', 'Erica', 'instance', 'have', 'younger', 'man', 'falling', 'older', 'woman', 'movie', 'Harry', 'journey', 'know', 'Harry', 'must', 'get', 'obsession', 'younger', 'women', 'know', 'going', 'start', 'become', 'attracted', 'woman', 'own', 'age.On', 'one', 'hand', 'nice', 'see', 'older', 'man', 'begin', 'be', 'attracted', 'older', 'woman', 'especially', 'when', 'giving', 'up', 'younger', 'woman', 'case', 'older', 'woman', 'daughter', 'started', 'care', 'more', 'Erica', 'journey', 'knew', 'exactly', 'where', 'Harry', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'wanted', 'something', 'different', 'was', 'very', 'standard', 'well', 'acted', 'movie', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'have', 'given', 'twist', 'make', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'special', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', ""'ll"", 'ask', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'reading', 'Ladies', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'Jack', 'Keanu', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'played', 'convention', 'expectation', 'movie', 'was', 'bringing', 'did', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'moment', 'know', 'how', 'film', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'said', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'produced', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'either.-Joe', 'Sherry']",N/A

Harry's Lust of the Moment is for Marin Barry (Amanda Peet), who invites her Lothario out to her mother's (presumably unoccupied) beach house in the Hamptons for some hanky-panky. In the midst of the foreplay, however, Mom (Diane Keaton as Erica Barry) shows up with her sister Zoe (Frances McDormand). After an initial period of tension, which includes a threatened call to the police and the brandishing of a butcher knife, all decide, being adults after all, to spend the weekend under the same roof. Sanborn subsequently has a heart attack. On release from the hospital, Marin goes back to New York and Harry is left to recuperate alone at Erica's home with its 56-year old owner, a noted playwright who's trying desperately to concentrate on writing her next script. A love-hate relationship develops, and the fun begins.Some of the biggest laughs hinge on nudity. A couple of times, the audience sees Harry's bare butt through the back of a hospital gown, and it's not a pretty sight. On the other hand, Erica has a full-frontal nude shot so brief that, if you blink at the wrong instant, you may miss it. However, if you rent the film when it comes out on DVD and pause it at the right instant, I suggest you'll see that Diane Keaton is still Lookin' Mighty Good. I was impressed. Harry is stunned, but not like you'd think.SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE is an enormously engaging romantic comedy as two veteran pros go through their paces. It's biggest flaw is that, at over two hours run time, it's too long by 30-40 minutes and one cardiac episode. (There should be a law prohibiting examples of the genre more than 90 minutes in length.) Moreover, there's an amusing but completely superfluous sidebar involving Harry's 36-year old physician (Keanu Reeves), who falls for an older woman. Guess who? On the other hand, Frances McDormand hasn't enough screen time. (To be perfectly honest, I wish she'd been cast in Keaton's part. Frances is, I think, a much better actress and could have given Erica depth beyond Diane's ability.)SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE is effervescent entertainment for the 2003 holiday season. It's not likely to be nominated for any Oscars, but it's great fun and likely to boost Viagra sales.

This was finally her perfect role.  Jack Nicholson was cast in a part that could have been written especially for him.  Erica Barry (Keaton) a successful middle-aged playwright who has emotionally and sexually closed herself off after divorcing her husband of 22 years (Paul Michael Glaser, still looking pretty good himself), meets the older man in her young daughter Marin's (Amanda Peet) life.  This meeting marked by sudden, unexpected attack of the heart exposes her to successful entrepreneur and playboy Harry Sanborn (Nicholson).  Sanborn has 'played at life' all of his 63 years before finally starting to get down to 'living his life' after facing the reality that he might have come close to the end of his life.  Proving it never rains but it pours, Barry unexpectedly simultaneously claims the attention of Sanborn's young doctor (Keanu Reeves), some 20 years her junior, who finds her beauty and intelligence magnetically attractive.During a real rain storm, the genuine romance of the film begins to bloom.  The charm of the movie is in looking on as two emotionally-challenged characters experience love, perhaps for the very first time, with all its pitfalls, peaks, comical and embarrassing moments, and the magic, tender, endearing episodes that make true love the roller coaster it always is.Keaton beautifully handles the over-the-top emotions of falling in love, portraying the highs and the lows, with equal brilliance.  Nicholson, who as always portrays every mental spark that is a thought and every feeling that is an emotion on that amazing face; always a portrait in motion that can be as easily read as words on a page.There are a lot of laughs in this film and there are a lot of truths in the tale.  Some reviewers have called this a menopause chick-flick.  The audience when I attended was about equal male/female, including some male viewers without dates.  The laughter seemed equally distributed along gender lines, telling me that the guys 'get it' as well as the females.Timeless romance with a sterling cast.

Also, I've always enjoyed watching Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson on screen. They generally have charisma and charm.But I was disappointed by this one, which came so close to being a great movie, but fell flat. Why did this have to be yet another fluffy romance without depth, intelligence and real heart?Keaton plays a middle-aged woman who is uptight and nervous about sexuality (symbolised by the turtlenecks she wears, summer or winter). Unfortunately, she also feels compelled to overact every nuance of emotion (joy, hysteria, sadness) and is far too sensitive about everything she encounters. She cries at the drop of a hat (if they had weep meters, this one would be off the charts).I didn't believe for a moment that she'd be THAT upset when Nicholson surprised her coming out of the shower or that she'd cry hysterically after seeing him in a restaurant with a pretty young thing. It is even less believable when you consider the fact that she seems competent and happy in most other aspects of her life, with a beautiful home, good friends and a great life overall.I give the filmmakers credit for trying to make a film aimed at those over 40.

798133,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001AVZA8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 7]","&quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; is far and away Diane Keaton's best performance and I think that the fact she already had a Best Actress Oscar is probably just as much a factor in why she did not win for this role as the fact that the majority of Academy voters are now probably closer to Charlize Theron in age.  Just the idea that anybody could consistently upstage Jack Nicholson in scene after scene is very impressive and that is without tossing in the rather superfluous but celebrated nude scene (I mean, the scene is funny just thinking that Keaton's character is naked without having to actually see her nude).Nicholson is Harry Sanborn, a notorious womanizer who tastes run exclusively to young woman.  This week that means Marin Barry (Amanda Peet) and so they head off to her family home in the Hamptons.  But before anything can happen her mother, Erica (Keaton), a famous playwright, and Aunt Zoe (Frances McDormand), a Woman Studies college professor, show up.  The initial awkwardness over the situation just moves to different levels of uneasiness as the four try to co-exist in the same house for the weekend.  Harry gets dissected by the two older women but at least gets to look forward to spending some romantic moments with Marin.  Then he has a heart attack and everything changes for not only Harry but also everybody else.The point is to have Harry stay at Erica's house while he recuperates so that the two of them can be alone.  Harry's heart attack has him looking at the world and his life with different eyes, and for the first time in a long time he finds himself drawn to a woman his own age.  She deserves such attention, but Harry is not alone in his growing affection.  Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves), the doctor who treats Harry, is immediately smitten by Erica.  He has seen all of her plays, thinks she is brilliant, and has no interest in doing the math on the difference between their ages.  Erica has gone from being alone for five years to suddenly having two men vying for her attention.One aspect of writer-director Nancy Meyers' script that I especially liked is that the supporting cast really stays out of the way of the two protagonists.  If anything, they make a point of staying out of the way, and none of the trite obstacles that such characters tend to throw in the way of the two potential lovers show up in this 2003 film.  When Marin gets an idea that maybe her mom and Harry are making a connection, she rushes off to break up with him.  You keep thinking Zoe is going to have something to say about all of this, but her efforts are almost exclusively non-verbal.  Harry and young Dr. Mercer never explicitly acknowledge that they are going after the same woman; the best we get are looks that speak to deeper thoughts.  Myers also avoids overplaying the idea that Erica is a playwright, although in the end the play she is writing plays a key role in the last stage of the film.My only major complaint with &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; is how Meyers plays out the end game.  I really was expecting something a lot better to connect the final set of dots in this plot line.  The movie also runs over 2 hours in length and was starting to drag on in a way that tried to persuade me that maybe it was not what I thought it was going to be about and was heading towards a different ending.  Even the idea that the others were staying out of the way of Harry and Erica ends up going too far at the end of the movie as the film pretty much jumps ahead to the ending all of a sudden.Nicholson is ostensibly playing himself, but that does not mean the performance is devoid of any sort of nuance or depth.  If we are getting glimpses of the &quot;real&quot; Nicholson, that is certainly worth enjoying.  McDormand is underutilized, which is usually the case when she appears in a movie, but here character is the most interesting of the bunch and you would think there are some choice moments for her on the cutting room floor but the DVD is without deleted scenes.  Reeves seem relieved to be free from the burden of being the One while Peet represents the sweet bird of youth.  But it is Keaton who provides the most memorable sequences, the best of which has to be the aria of crying she delivers as she writes her new play.  Sometimes milking something for everything it is worth is a good thing.  It will be interesting to see where Keaton goes from here, because it is going to be impossible for her to top this one.",4,Who would not fall in love with Diane Keaton in this film?,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,4479,"['quot', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'quot', 'far', 'away', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'best', 'performance', 'think', 'fact', 'already', 'had', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'factor', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'role', 'fact', 'majority', 'Academy', 'voters', 'are', 'now', 'probably', 'closer', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'age', 'Just', 'idea', 'anybody', 'could', 'consistently', 'upstage', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'scene', 'scene', 'very', 'impressive', 'tossing', 'rather', 'superfluous', 'celebrated', 'nude', 'scene', 'mean', 'scene', 'funny', 'just', 'thinking', 'Keaton', 'character', 'naked', 'having', 'actually', 'see', 'nude', '.Nicholson', 'Harry', 'Sanborn', 'notorious', 'womanizer', 'who', 'run', 'exclusively', 'young', 'woman', 'week', 'Marin', 'Barry', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'so', 'head', 'family', 'home', 'Hamptons', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'mother', 'Erica', 'Keaton', 'famous', 'playwright', 'Aunt', 'Zoe', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Woman', 'Studies', 'college', 'professor', 'show', 'up', 'initial', 'awkwardness', 'situation', 'just', 'different', 'levels', 'uneasiness', 'four', 'try', 'co-exist', 'same', 'house', 'weekend', 'Harry', 'dissected', 'two', 'older', 'women', 'least', 'look', 'forward', 'spending', 'romantic', 'moments', 'Marin', 'Then', 'heart', 'attack', 'everything', 'changes', 'not', 'only', 'Harry', 'also', 'everybody', 'else.The', 'point', 'have', 'Harry', 'stay', 'Erica', 'house', 'so', 'two', 'can', 'be', 'alone', 'Harry', 'heart', 'attack', 'looking', 'world', 'life', 'different', 'eyes', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'drawn', 'woman', 'own', 'age', 'such', 'attention', 'Harry', 'not', 'alone', 'growing', 'affection', 'Julian', 'Mercer', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'doctor', 'who', 'Harry', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'Erica', 'seen', 'plays', 'brilliant', 'interest', 'doing', 'math', 'difference', 'ages', 'Erica', 'gone', 'being', 'alone', 'five', 'years', 'suddenly', 'having', 'two', 'men', 'vying', 'attention.One', 'aspect', 'writer-director', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'script', 'especially', 'liked', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'way', 'two', 'protagonists', 'anything', 'make', 'point', 'staying', 'way', 'none', 'trite', 'obstacles', 'such', 'characters', 'tend', 'throw', 'way', 'two', 'potential', 'lovers', 'show', 'up', '2003', 'film', 'When', 'Marin', 'idea', 'maybe', 'mom', 'Harry', 'are', 'making', 'connection', 'break', 'up', 'keep', 'thinking', 'Zoe', 'going', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'efforts', 'are', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'non-verbal', 'Harry', 'young', 'Dr.', 'Mercer', 'never', 'explicitly', 'acknowledge', 'are', 'going', 'same', 'woman', 'best', 'get', 'are', 'speak', 'deeper', 'thoughts', 'Myers', 'also', 'avoids', 'overplaying', 'idea', 'Erica', 'playwright', 'end', 'play', 'writing', 'plays', 'key', 'role', 'last', 'stage', 'film.My', 'only', 'major', 'complaint', 'quot', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'quot', 'how', 'Meyers', 'out', 'end', 'game', 'really', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'lot', 'better', 'connect', 'final', 'set', 'dots', 'plot', 'line', 'movie', 'also', '2', 'hours', 'length', 'was', 'starting', 'drag', 'way', 'tried', 'persuade', 'maybe', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'about', 'was', 'heading', 'different', 'ending', 'Even', 'idea', 'others', 'were', 'staying', 'way', 'Harry', 'Erica', 'up', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'end', 'movie', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'jumps', 'ahead', 'ending', 'sudden.Nicholson', 'ostensibly', 'playing', 'not', 'mean', 'performance', 'devoid', 'sort', 'nuance', 'depth', 'are', 'getting', 'glimpses', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'Nicholson', 'certainly', 'worth', 'enjoying', 'McDormand', 'underutilized', 'usually', 'case', 'when', 'movie', 'here', 'character', 'most', 'interesting', 'bunch', 'would', 'think', 'are', 'choice', 'moments', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Reeves', 'seem', 'relieved', 'be', 'free', 'burden', 'being', 'One', 'Peet', 'sweet', 'bird', 'youth', 'Keaton', 'who', 'most', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'best', 'be', 'aria', 'crying', 'delivers', 'new', 'play', 'Sometimes', 'milking', 'something', 'everything', 'worth', 'good', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'where', 'Keaton', 'here', 'going', 'be', 'impossible', 'top', 'one']",N/A

Add to this Keanu Reeves, as Nicholson's dashing doctor who also is smitten by Keaton.The film's plot is wafer-thin, and the supporting cast is a bit bland. Peet, while attractive, is not match for her older costars, and Francis McDormand as Keaton's feminist sister is completely wasted (though she looks fabulous). Keanu Reeves manages to be charming, though when in the presence of Keaton or Nicholson, he shrinks away in their shadows.While Nicholson, who is wonderful, looks pretty good for his age, it's Keaton who shocks audiences with her stunning figure.

798150,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0001AVZA8,Matthew Horner,"[4, 4]","I admit that ""Something's Gotta Give"" [not a great title!] was not on my must-see list. Now, having seem it, it is my must own DVD list. While its stars, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, are two of my all-time favorites, most recent romantic comedies have not been original, funny or, for that matter, particularly romantic. While the only thing in the least original about the movie is the fact that the leads are practically senior citizens, it is outrageously funny and extraordinarily romantic.Harry [Nicholson] is a dedicated playboy who always dates young women. The sad thing is that he is now 63, perilously close to being old enough to be some of his girlfriends' grandfather. One summer day his latest flame, Marin [Amanda Peet], takes him on a weekend outing to her mother's beach house in The Hamptons. The couple is surprised to find that Erica [Keaton], the mom, is also visiting. Erica is a famous playwright. She writes romantic comedies, but, being 57 and divorced, she long ago gave up on falling in love again herself. Suddenly, Harry has a heart attack. The attending physician, Dr. Meyer [Keanu Reeves], suggests that Harry stay at Erica's house for awhile until he is strong enough to go back to New York. It turns out that Meyer has a thing for older women, and he begins to pursue Erica. Meanwhile, Harry's brush with death is causing him to rethink his life [maybe older ain't so bad], while Meyer is forcing Erica to rethink hers [maybe younger is the answer]. The ultimate solution to this love triangle is predictable, but the getting there is great fun.Director/writer Nancy Meyers, herself 54, has written a mature, witty, sophisticated screenplay, but I think she herself knows that it is the magnetism of Keaton and Nicholson that makes the movie such a great success. [Interesting note: In real life the two once were lovers] The supporting cast is excellent and includes Amanda Peet Jon Favreau  and Frances McDormand.]If there is a problem with the movie, it is that it may be somewhat too sophisticated for today's mainstream audiences and critics.

But if you're over 40... or better, over 50... this is a hilarious, joyful romantic comedy that captures the best of some of the classic romantic film duos, like Tracy and Hepburn.In fact, this film will remind you of a dozen films, some classics, that you've seen before. It starts out like a French farce and quickly turns into All That Jazz, and then The Man Who Came To Dinner, and then You've Got Mail. And so on, yet it manages to continually do so with freshness and originality. There may be a few cliches- it's hard to do a love story without falling into a few- but it still manages to suprise you and keep you interested from beginning to end.Nicholson does a nice turnabout and plays something other than the stock manic character he's taken to parodying in so many films. If anything, he's parodying his own life here. And Keaton's performance has just a touch of parody of her most famous role, that of Annie Hall, but with much more depth and humor and sophistication. And it's great to see mature people playing mature people relating to other mature people, lines and all. The charatcters ring true as middle aged, neither prettied up nor turned into doddering parodies of age.A wonderfully warm movie that celebrates love that lives on beyond youth, not to mention a great date film that both men and owmen will love.

Moore,"[0, 0]","Nancy Meyers has often been accused of writing oversweetened comedies about overprivileged people, and that criticism comes closest to being true in ""Something's Gotta Give."" Because Meyers keeps such a tight focus on the late-blooming romance of record mogul Harry Seaborn (Jack Nicholson) and superstar playwright Erica Berry (Diane Keaton), the audience gets to linger on the Vanderbilt-like luxury of their lives. Twenty-room beach house in the Hamptons? Check. Vintage Bordeaux at dinner every night? Check. Corner tables at Le Bernardin and the Four Seasons? Check. Nancy Meyers may well live like this (and it's a cinch Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton do), but the fairy-tale aspect of this Champagne Dreams & Caviar Wishes lifestyle becomes almost oppressive after a while.I say ""almost,"" because, let's face it, it's lovely to spend time in a Hamptons beach house we'll never get to enter unless we're delivering flowers. It's nice to be there even when we're not particularly interested in the people who live there. For most of the running time of ""Something's Gotta Give,"" I couldn't have cared less whether Harry could overcome his addiction to dating women young enough to be his granddaughters and admit his love for Erica, the mother of one of his young conquests. Although I acknowledge that Jack Nicholson is a fine actor, I've never been a big fan of his; his too-cool-for-school attitude annoys me. On the other hand, I would gladly watch Diane Keaton even if she were playing Harry, and for most of the film's running time I felt Erica could do a lot better than Harry. There was even a better option right at hand: the handsome, obliging young doctor played by Keanu Reeves.""Something's Gotta Give"" annoyed me in many ways, not least because it gives extremely short shrift to its gifted supporting cast. (What a waste of Frances McDormand, one of the world's greatest living actresses.) Yet, in its last ten minutes, ""Something's Gotta Give"" redeems itself, largely because Nicholson redeems himself. Harry finally drops hisattitude, and real emotion, real sorrow, comes through. So powerfully, in fact, that it brought tears to my eyes. In those few minutes, Nicholson proves he deserves every word of praise ever written about him, and it transforms the movie. Maybe he doesn't raise the film to four-star status, but maybe three-and-a-half.

But their plans go awry when Marin's mother Erica (Diane Keaton) and her aunt Zoe (Frances McDormand) show up unexpectedly. The couple is further foiled when Harry has a heart attack in Marin's arms. As Harry is unfit to travel, Erica reluctantly allows him to stay in her home while he recuperates.  Erica, who is an accomplished playwright and 50-something divorcee, and Harry, an aging confirmed bachelor who has always confined his romantic aspirations to women half Erica's age, find themselves both attracted to and repulsed by one another. And the friction between them may ignite an unexpected spark.Let me first say that ""Something's Gotta Give"" elicited more laughs in the movie theater than any film in my memory. It's a good time at the movies. It's too bad that the movie runs too long and doesn't maintain its charm through the third act. It would be nice if the audience could leave the theater in as good a mood as they experienced for the first two-thirds of the movie. At about 2 hours long, ""Something's Gotta Give"" is too long for a romantic comedy. It has a few subplots and a few acts too many. The film is charming enough and paced well enough to overcome it, but a tighter script would have done wonders. And although most of the film is hilarious, it loses a lot of its charm and humor after the action moves from the Hamptons to New York city.The comedy and romance in ""Something's Gotta Give"" are, of course, derived from the notion that women of a certain age have a terrible time finding suitable men because the desirable men in that demographic date much-younger women. That's funny stuff, but it often seems like writer/director Nancy Meyers is trying to do more than entertain. She waves the older-women-can't-get-dates and older-men-who-date-younger-women-are-scum flags a little too high. And the repeated assertion that both old and young women are somehow victims of these aging Casanovas is insulting and, dare I say, inaccurate. This is a comedy; why not simply see the humor in the situation? It would be fine if the film said nothing. But mixed messages are a nuisance. Harry is chided for constantly cavorting with younger women, while Erica is congratulated when she does approximately the same thing.  And why are these people so preoccupied with the age of their mates anyway? It's tiresome.""Something's Gotta Give"" is undeniably funny but far from perfect. Erica's neuroses wear thin after a while. Harry is lovable when he's  lecherous, but trying when he's earnest. The film is too long. I didn't for a moment believe that Harry and Erica were actually compatible, but romantic comedies are contrived by definition. But ultimately a comedy is required only to be funny in order to succeed. And two thirds of ""Something's Gotta Give"" is laugh-out-loud funny. Jack Nicholson deserves a lot of credit for being willing to look like a fool -and an old fool at that. There's some terrific physical comedy. I like the decision to use brief nudity  for comic effect. And Keanu Reeves does a nice job as a very handsome doctor who pursues Erica. It would have been better if some of the clutter had been cleared out, but smart writing and no-holds-barred performances make ""Something's Gotta Give"" a funny and enjoyable film for just about everyone.",4,"Cluttered & Too Long, but Charming & Hilarious Nonetheless.",1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,3437,"['Harry', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'much', 'younger', 'girlfriend', 'Marin', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'plan', 'spend', 'romantic', 'weekend', 'Marin', 'family', 'home', 'Hamptons', 'plans', 'go', 'awry', 'when', 'Marin', 'mother', 'Erica', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'aunt', 'Zoe', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'show', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'couple', 'further', 'foiled', 'when', 'Harry', 'heart', 'attack', 'Marin', 'arms', 'Harry', 'unfit', 'travel', 'Erica', 'reluctantly', 'stay', 'home', 'Erica', 'who', 'accomplished', 'playwright', '50-something', 'divorcee', 'Harry', 'aging', 'confirmed', 'bachelor', 'who', 'always', 'confined', 'romantic', 'aspirations', 'women', 'Erica', 'age', 'find', 'attracted', 'repulsed', 'one', 'friction', 'may', 'ignite', 'unexpected', 'spark.Let', 'first', 'say', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'elicited', 'more', 'laughs', 'movie', 'theater', 'film', 'memory', 'good', 'time', 'movies', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'too', 'long', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'charm', 'third', 'act', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'audience', 'could', 'leave', 'theater', 'as', 'good', 'mood', 'experienced', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'too', 'long', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'few', 'subplots', 'few', 'acts', 'too', 'many', 'film', 'charming', 'enough', 'paced', 'well', 'enough', 'overcome', 'tighter', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'wonders', 'most', 'film', 'hilarious', 'lot', 'charm', 'humor', 'action', 'Hamptons', 'New', 'York', 'city.The', 'comedy', 'romance', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'are', 'course', 'derived', 'notion', 'women', 'certain', 'age', 'have', 'terrible', 'time', 'finding', 'suitable', 'men', 'desirable', 'men', 'demographic', 'date', 'much-younger', 'women', 'funny', 'stuff', 'often', 'writer/director', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'trying', 'do', 'more', 'entertain', ""older-women-can't-get-dates"", 'older-men-who-date-younger-women-are-scum', 'flags', 'little', 'too', 'high', 'repeated', 'assertion', 'old', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'somehow', 'victims', 'aging', 'Casanovas', 'insulting', 'dare', 'say', 'inaccurate', 'comedy', 'why', 'not', 'simply', 'see', 'humor', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'film', 'said', 'nothing', 'mixed', 'messages', 'are', 'nuisance', 'Harry', 'chided', 'constantly', 'cavorting', 'younger', 'women', 'Erica', 'congratulated', 'when', 'approximately', 'same', 'thing', 'why', 'are', 'people', 'so', 'preoccupied', 'age', 'mates', 'anyway', 'tiresome', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'undeniably', 'funny', 'far', 'perfect', 'Erica', 'neuroses', 'wear', 'thin', 'while', 'Harry', 'lovable', 'when', 'lecherous', 'trying', 'when', 'earnest', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'moment', 'believe', 'Harry', 'Erica', 'were', 'actually', 'compatible', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'contrived', 'definition', 'ultimately', 'comedy', 'required', 'only', 'be', 'funny', 'order', 'succeed', 'two', 'thirds', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'lot', 'credit', 'being', 'willing', 'look', 'fool', '-and', 'old', 'fool', 'terrific', 'physical', 'comedy', 'like', 'decision', 'use', 'brief', 'nudity', 'comic', 'effect', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'nice', 'job', 'very', 'handsome', 'doctor', 'who', 'Erica', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'clutter', 'had', 'been', 'cleared', 'out', 'smart', 'writing', 'no-holds-barred', 'performances', 'make', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'just', 'everyone']",N/A

798165,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B0001AVZA8,"""mobby_uk""","[5, 7]","I love Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton..Without too much explanations, they are simply two of the best actors/actresses of all time.But watching Something's Gotta Give, I can not but feel sheer disappointment at the result that could have been far better with a tighter script and better director.First of all the problem with the film is its length, over two hours long..I never minded long films, (I sat through Bertoluccis's Novencetto more times that I can remember without being aware or bothering too much with its length)..But to sit through two hours of an overstretched story that is drenched in sugary sentimentality was tiring.Moreover, the problem with the film is too many unnecessary characters. For instance the characters of Frances McDormand and Paul Michael Glazer, although credited as stars, were too shallow, appearing in a couple of scenes at most and added nothing to the plot.Amanda's Peet character was also very badly written: we see here at first falling for the rich older guy without sleeping with him, inexplicably telling him when they arrived at her mother's house: are you glad we waited?? !!! Then towards the end of the film and in a space of six months,( movie time), we see her the image of domesticity, married and  three months pregnant!!Keanu Reeves also inexplicably falls head over heels with Keaton's character, and their short romance is probably the lamest and most confusing I have seen in a film.Now I have to mention few words about the acting of Nicholson and Keaton:Nancy Meyers manages to get so much over the top acting from them, and fails miserably to get the right performances.The scenes I cringed in the most are the ones we see them crying, probably intended to add some bittersweet humor, but it became overbearingly annoying.When Nicholson cried at the very end of About Schmidt, I connected totally with him, and it was genuinely bittersweet because his tears reflected his whole story, his loneliness, frustration and tinge of hope for the future, in short they had deep meaning. In Something's Gotta Give, even for a comedy, it was totally pointless.Yet I must say that there were few laughs in the first half of the movie, and some promise of a sweet romantic movie, unfortunately lost in the second half, ruining the whole film.Having said all that, the only aspect of the film which I liked, was how refreshing to see people above sixty, falling in love and having sex..not many films have shown that.I now must mention, maybe two trivial observations,that did not help this negative review.The first is the issue of smoking..We see Keaton as an anti smoking healthy woman, but at the end she lights up!! Probably intended to reflect how she has lightened up..but it was a very wrong message to give (and this is coming from a smoker!!) it is time filmmakers take some responsibility in this very sensitive issue.The other observation revolves around a scene when just before making love, Nicholson asks Keaton about birth control pills, and she naturally answers,no menopause!! Although it is kind of a funny dialog, she should have asked him instead whether he had a condom or not!! him being as it has been over emphasized,a sexually promiscuous man..again this would have been a good message to send at a time when sexual transmitted diseases and especially AIDS are still very much with us, and more so with straight people..So Something's Gotta Give is a missed opportunity to take advantage of the wealth of talent involved, and a proof that excellent actors are not enough to make a good movie.",2,Something's Gotta Give.....My Patience!,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,3568,"['love', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Diane', 'Keaton..Without', 'too', 'much', 'explanations', 'are', 'simply', 'two', 'best', 'actors/actresses', 'time.But', 'watching', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'sheer', 'disappointment', 'result', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'tighter', 'script', 'better', 'director.First', 'problem', 'film', 'length', 'two', 'hours', 'long..I', 'never', 'minded', 'long', 'films', 'sat', 'Bertoluccis', 'Novencetto', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'remember', 'being', 'aware', 'bothering', 'too', 'much', 'length', '..But', 'sit', 'two', 'hours', 'overstretched', 'story', 'drenched', 'sugary', 'sentimentality', 'was', 'tiring.Moreover', 'problem', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'instance', 'characters', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Glazer', 'credited', 'stars', 'were', 'too', 'shallow', 'appearing', 'couple', 'scenes', 'most', 'added', 'nothing', 'plot.Amanda', 'Peet', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'badly', 'written', 'see', 'here', 'first', 'falling', 'rich', 'older', 'guy', 'sleeping', 'inexplicably', 'telling', 'when', 'arrived', 'mother', 'house', 'are', 'waited', 'Then', 'end', 'film', 'space', 'six', 'months', 'movie', 'time', 'see', 'image', 'domesticity', 'married', 'three', 'months', 'pregnant', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'also', 'inexplicably', 'head', 'heels', 'Keaton', 'character', 'short', 'romance', 'probably', 'lamest', 'most', 'confusing', 'have', 'seen', 'film.Now', 'have', 'mention', 'few', 'words', 'acting', 'Nicholson', 'Keaton', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'top', 'acting', 'miserably', 'get', 'right', 'performances.The', 'scenes', 'cringed', 'most', 'are', 'ones', 'see', 'crying', 'probably', 'intended', 'add', 'bittersweet', 'humor', 'became', 'overbearingly', 'annoying.When', 'Nicholson', 'cried', 'very', 'end', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'connected', 'totally', 'was', 'genuinely', 'bittersweet', 'tears', 'reflected', 'whole', 'story', 'loneliness', 'frustration', 'tinge', 'hope', 'future', 'short', 'had', 'deep', 'meaning', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'even', 'comedy', 'was', 'totally', 'pointless.Yet', 'must', 'say', 'were', 'few', 'laughs', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'promise', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'lost', 'second', 'half', 'ruining', 'whole', 'film.Having', 'said', 'only', 'aspect', 'film', 'liked', 'was', 'how', 'refreshing', 'see', 'people', 'sixty', 'falling', 'love', 'having', 'sex..not', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'shown', 'that.I', 'now', 'must', 'mention', 'maybe', 'two', 'trivial', 'observations', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'negative', 'review.The', 'first', 'issue', 'smoking..We', 'see', 'Keaton', 'anti', 'smoking', 'healthy', 'woman', 'end', 'up', 'Probably', 'intended', 'reflect', 'how', 'lightened', 'was', 'very', 'wrong', 'message', 'give', 'coming', 'smoker', 'time', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'responsibility', 'very', 'sensitive', 'issue.The', 'other', 'observation', 'revolves', 'scene', 'when', 'just', 'making', 'love', 'Nicholson', 'Keaton', 'birth', 'control', 'pills', 'naturally', 'answers', 'menopause', 'kind', 'funny', 'dialog', 'should', 'have', 'asked', 'instead', 'had', 'condom', 'not', 'being', 'been', 'emphasized', 'sexually', 'promiscuous', 'man..again', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'message', 'send', 'time', 'when', 'sexual', 'transmitted', 'diseases', 'especially', 'AIDS', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'straight', 'people..So', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'take', 'advantage', 'wealth', 'talent', 'involved', 'proof', 'excellent', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

I thought it was a wonderful satire of contemporary society, which consistently values youth over age. I have to admire Jack Nicholson for taking on a role that reminds the viewer of the actor's own very public relationships with much younger women. And Nicholson did an excellent turn as a man reluctant, at age 60+, to grow up and assume the adult role. Diane Keaton as 'Erica' was outstanding -- she did not indulge in most of her trademark mannerisms &amp; because of that her character seemed very real and vivid, much more so than that of her daughter (played by the competent Amanda Peet). As to the May-September romance between 'Erica' and the much younger doctor (played by Keanu Reeves), which bothered many viewers: I did not feel comfortable with it either...it seemed perhaps to be too much of a wish-fullfillment..as a light flirtation or a fling I could see it, but I think it was unrealistic that 'Erica' would even consider marriage to the much younger doctor, let alone become engaged to him.For me, the highlight of the movie was the speech that Frances McDormand made early in the movie, relating how women in their 50s were &quot;the most %$#@%^ generation of America women ever.&quot; Since I didn't see it in the theatre, I can only imagine the cheers that went up when she was finished! And speaking of Ms McDormand, I would loved to have seen more of her character -- she just disappeared from the movie without any reason given, which was IMO a waste of her talent.As to the DVD, I wish there were more bonus materials -- I rarely listen to audio commentary, and,other than that, there isn't much more than a deleted scene and a tour of the house where much of the movie took place.

Okay, here goes...I just watched this film, and perhaps it caught me at the right moment because it made me cry... twice. There are many reviews out there, so I won't waste your time repeating the good things (I have no bad thoughts about this film, so I won't go there either).I didn't think this film was anything special when I began to watch it (well, it is a chick flick). Then the relationship between Harry and Erica began to develop and I was being drawn in. Before I knew it I had a tear running down my cheek. Sometimes movies, like people, just click with you. It was unexpected and fun. A message I think the movie tries to portray; that sometimes the best moments in life are unexpected.One negative reviewer said, ""Erica makes a strange decision to choose a man who has been a jerk to her over one who has treated her with total kindness.

Frances MacDormand had a small part but added to the fine cast.Diane Keaton plays,Erica Barry, a divorced mother of an adult child who is a very successful playwright and lives in upscale Hampton.Jack Nicholson plays,Harry Sanborn, the owner of a hip hop label called ""Drive By"". He enjoys dating much younger women and was dating Erica Barry's daughter, Marin, previously. He has a hard time committing to any relationship and suffers from multiple ""heart attacks"".Amanda Peet plays, Marin, Erica Barry's 30 year old daughter who also suffers from committing in a relationship. She was previously dating Harry and brings him to her mother's Hampton beach house for a little romp when Harry suffers from a near fatal heart attack.Keanu Reeves plays, Dr. Julian Mercer, who is the emergency doctor who cares for Harry after his heart attack. It is at this time that he meets and falls in love with Erica Barry with whom he has a relationship with before she dumps him for Harry, a more age appropriate companion for her.Frances MacDormand plays,Zoe, Erica's sister who encourages the relationship between her sister and Julian.Erica writes a play based on her relationship with Harry which ends with the two of them (along with Julian) in Paris. It was the French music and the scenes of Paris that helped make this romantic movie so endearing.I enjoyed seeing a movie about two mature adults falling in love.

798186,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B0001AVZA8,Paul McGrath,"[53, 89]","Every once in a while you come across a movie that hits you right where you live.  A movie that so accurately reflects your life and your life experience that you almost feel gaseous with recognition.  A movie that explodes in your guts like a rotten pineapple.  A movie that twists and squirms in your brain like a live amphibian.  This grand film assuredly belongs in that class.Take the first scene.  Amanda Peet is a beautiful young woman with an education, a fascinating job, and a wealthy, famous mother.  So naturally--it just makes so much sense--she throws herself at the ancient, witless, overweight buffoon, Jack Nicholson.  She can hardly wait to drag him back to her mother's fabulous beach resort for a weekend of physical frivolity.This was the film's first brilliant point, and exactly mirrors the problem that many of us in middle have begun to encounter.  So you know, I'm a 52 year-old balding insurance salesman--admittedly not as old as the Jack Nicholson character--and I can't stick my nose in a restaurant, bar, theatre or bookstore without some lithe 24 year-old, bikini'd bimbo trying to drag me to the back room for a couple of minutes of frisky frolic.  What is with these girls?  Why can't they find somebody their own age?  The movie hammered this home:  of COURSE I empathize with the Jack Nicholson character.  It's about time a film addressed this very critical societal issue, a problem all men my age must face.Now the potential flaw to this theme is that the Nicholson character is at least several decades older than me, but the film overcomes this possible stumbling block by inundating us with the famous Nicholson charm.  No, not a charm based on wit and humor, as you might expect, but a far more effective one:  by having him gasp and wheeze and weakly speak his every line in feeble befuddlement, the filmmakers cleverly show how pitiful he is.  Clearly, no nubile, youthful, gorgeous female on earth could keep her hands off him.But the brilliant points of this film have only just begun.  For the Nicholson character is then attracted to the mother.  Of course!  Just like me, he prefers the company of women his own age.  But the problem is this:  like him, every time I find a skinny, hermetic, wrinkled-up old broad I'd like to hang around with, sure enough, a young, rich, handsome doctor-type comes along and sweeps her off her feet.  It is an unbelievably frustrating and common problem to all of us 52 year-old, balding insurance salesmen, and it is to the film's great credit that it has the undaunted courage to finally address this major societal controversy.There are so many other things to say about the artistic magnificence displayed in this film.  Even I, wise and experienced as I am, can not pretend to know everything.  For example, I've never been to a gangster-rap, hip-hop type party, and have always been fascinated to see what one might be like.  The film portrays this brilliantly.  How interesting to see that get-togethers like this are mostly populated by aging white people sipping cocktails, and that the background music resembles nothing like hip-hop or rap at all!  This is daring, risky moviemaking, and succeeds in foiling our expectations brilliantly.But it is the ending which almost defies description, and brings these divergent parts to an artistic whole.  For Mr. Nicholson, after a searing, tragic, heart-breaking journey of self-discovery, decides to reclaim his aging, prune-faced amour in Paris.  She has gone there, unbeknownst to him, with the young doctor, and for an idyllic week of wine, dining and romance.  To the film's great, daring credit, the young doctor, with his loved one and his dreams in the City of Light, immediately abandons her, boldly conceding that he cannot hope to compete with the weight, the age, the experience, and the overall unshaved ineptitude of Nicholson's drooling stinkpot of a character.It is a wonder to behold.",1,As Bad as it Gets,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,3939,"['once', 'while', 'come', 'movie', 'right', 'where', 'live', 'movie', 'so', 'accurately', 'life', 'life', 'experience', 'almost', 'feel', 'gaseous', 'recognition', 'movie', 'guts', 'rotten', 'pineapple', 'movie', 'squirms', 'brain', 'live', 'amphibian', 'grand', 'film', 'assuredly', 'class.Take', 'first', 'scene', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'education', 'fascinating', 'job', 'wealthy', 'famous', 'mother', 'So', 'naturally', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'sense', 'ancient', 'witless', 'overweight', 'buffoon', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'drag', 'back', 'mother', 'fabulous', 'beach', 'resort', 'weekend', 'physical', 'frivolity.This', 'was', 'film', 'first', 'brilliant', 'point', 'exactly', 'mirrors', 'problem', 'many', 'middle', 'have', 'begun', 'encounter', 'know', ""'m"", '52', 'year-old', 'balding', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'admittedly', 'not', 'as', 'old', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stick', 'nose', 'restaurant', 'bar', 'theatre', 'bookstore', 'lithe', '24', 'year-old', 'bikini', ""'d"", 'bimbo', 'trying', 'drag', 'back', 'room', 'couple', 'minutes', 'frisky', 'frolic', 'What', 'girls', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'somebody', 'own', 'age', 'movie', 'hammered', 'home', 'COURSE', 'empathize', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'time', 'film', 'addressed', 'very', 'critical', 'societal', 'issue', 'problem', 'men', 'age', 'must', 'face.Now', 'potential', 'flaw', 'theme', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'least', 'several', 'decades', 'older', 'film', 'possible', 'stumbling', 'block', 'inundating', 'famous', 'Nicholson', 'charm', 'No', 'not', 'charm', 'based', 'wit', 'humor', 'might', 'expect', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'one', 'having', 'gasp', 'wheeze', 'weakly', 'speak', 'line', 'feeble', 'befuddlement', 'filmmakers', 'cleverly', 'show', 'how', 'pitiful', 'Clearly', 'nubile', 'youthful', 'gorgeous', 'female', 'earth', 'could', 'keep', 'hands', 'brilliant', 'points', 'film', 'have', 'only', 'just', 'begun', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'then', 'attracted', 'mother', 'course', 'Just', 'company', 'women', 'own', 'age', 'problem', 'time', 'find', 'skinny', 'hermetic', 'wrinkled-up', 'old', 'broad', ""'d"", 'like', 'hang', 'sure', 'enough', 'young', 'rich', 'handsome', 'doctor-type', 'along', 'off', 'feet', 'unbelievably', 'frustrating', 'common', 'problem', '52', 'year-old', 'balding', 'insurance', 'salesmen', 'film', 'great', 'credit', 'undaunted', 'courage', 'finally', 'address', 'major', 'societal', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'say', 'artistic', 'magnificence', 'displayed', 'film', 'Even', 'wise', 'experienced', 'am', 'can', 'not', 'pretend', 'know', 'everything', 'example', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'gangster-rap', 'hip-hop', 'type', 'party', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'see', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'How', 'interesting', 'see', 'get-togethers', 'are', 'mostly', 'populated', 'aging', 'white', 'people', 'sipping', 'cocktails', 'background', 'music', 'nothing', 'hip-hop', 'rap', 'daring', 'risky', 'moviemaking', 'foiling', 'expectations', 'ending', 'almost', 'description', 'divergent', 'parts', 'artistic', 'whole', 'Mr.', 'Nicholson', 'searing', 'tragic', 'heart-breaking', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'reclaim', 'aging', 'prune-faced', 'amour', 'Paris', 'gone', 'there', 'unbeknownst', 'young', 'doctor', 'idyllic', 'week', 'wine', 'dining', 'romance', 'film', 'great', 'daring', 'credit', 'young', 'doctor', 'loved', 'one', 'dreams', 'City', 'Light', 'immediately', 'boldly', 'conceding', 'can', 'not', 'hope', 'compete', 'weight', 'age', 'experience', 'overall', 'unshaved', 'ineptitude', 'Nicholson', 'drooling', 'stinkpot', 'character.It', 'wonder', 'behold']",N/A

His  fluid facial expressions  and theatrical features are unmatched by any other  player in Hollywood. I  thoroughly enjoyed this movie, set mainly in Long Island, which is classified in the ""melodrama"" section of my film library. The movie allows Jack to  act  himself  to the maximum as the clown of tragic  comedy.  The effect was a little tarnished by the traditional, ""They all lived happily ever after"" ending, but it was still pure entertainment, a film tailor-made for the aging baby boomers. Even had it had the more philosophical end I was expecting, it would have  not been  depressing , unlike About Schmidt  or The Crossing Guard.  This movie is more akin to As Good as it Gets, which I believe  is Nicholson's finest as well as been an excellent  little melodrama. Yet between these two fine movies something's gotta give between the two, indeed not in quality of cinematography and acting which are equally good but the script of this movie is inferior to that of As Good as it Gets (which for Nicholson's acting is, indeed, as good as it gets). Nevertheless, Something's  Gotta Give  has its own fine merits. The theme  is good, Jack Nicholson has been lucky in playing with good co-stars in both films, Helen Hunt  and Diane Keaton respectively,  as well as an outstanding supporting cast in each case. The highlight, or turning point of the movie, as it occurs nearly halfway,  takes  place in  a comfortable double bed  during  a very wet afternoon. I recommend that if any  DVD viewer has  a partner that you really love, spend it in such  a bed in such an afternoon, while partly  watching the movie. You miss a bit, so what? That's what  fast return buttons on the remote  and scene selections are for.  Just  snuggle up cosy, share  some  fresh hot (but unbuttered)  popcorn  (and don't spill the crumbs) if you will,  and watch this movie. I doesn't require the same degree of concentration to appreciate  as in As  Good as it Gets, but you will both  enjoy it.

A heart attack lands him in the seaside home of the mother of one of those young women. This 'mother' turns out to be Diane Keaton, a playwright of some fame. An interesting little triangle develops. Keanu Reeves, the cardiologist, falls hard for Keaton, who is always one sexy dame. Nicholson falls for her, too. Keaton is in the enviable position of having 2 men, who have maybe a 25 year age gap between them, salivating over her.The scenes of the developing relationship, including a nude scene for Keaton and a bare-butt scene for Nicholson, are marvelous fun and quite believable.The there are detractions. Frances McDormand's talents are wasted in a role as Keaton's sister, a role that is far too small for her. Reeves' role is understated, gentlemanly - and ultimately unbelievable. Not unbelievable in terms of a man falling for a woman 15+ years his senior, but unbelievable in terms of the minimal emotional range he brings to his performance.But the best part by far is the fact that this romantic comedy doesn't deal with the foibles of 20-30yo actors; it focuses with truth and affection on the foibles of a 'mature couple.'Great theater.",4,"Not as great as it could have been, but still great",1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,1259,"['Romantic', 'comedy', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'aging', 'Lothario', 'chasing', 'younger', 'women', 'heart', 'attack', 'seaside', 'home', 'mother', 'one', 'young', 'women', ""'mother"", 'turns', 'out', 'be', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'playwright', 'fame', 'interesting', 'little', 'triangle', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'cardiologist', 'hard', 'Keaton', 'who', 'always', 'one', 'sexy', 'dame', 'Nicholson', 'too', 'Keaton', 'enviable', 'position', 'having', '2', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'maybe', '25', 'year', 'age', 'gap', 'salivating', 'her.The', 'scenes', 'developing', 'relationship', 'including', 'nude', 'scene', 'Keaton', 'bare-butt', 'scene', 'Nicholson', 'are', 'marvelous', 'fun', 'quite', 'believable.The', 'are', 'detractions', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'talents', 'are', 'wasted', 'role', 'Keaton', 'sister', 'role', 'far', 'too', 'small', 'Reeves', 'role', 'understated', 'gentlemanly', 'ultimately', 'unbelievable', 'Not', 'unbelievable', 'terms', 'man', 'falling', 'woman', '15+', 'years', 'senior', 'unbelievable', 'terms', 'minimal', 'emotional', 'range', 'performance.But', 'best', 'part', 'far', 'fact', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'deal', 'foibles', '20-30yo', 'actors', 'truth', 'affection', 'foibles', ""'mature"", 'couple', ""'Great"", 'theater']",N/A

If you are a fan of ""When Harry Met Sally"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"", then, you probably know what to expect on this one.  To make a subtle comedy romantic movie isn't easy because the storyline has got to be good, the cast needs to have chemistry, their comic timing has got to be impeccable, and the scripts need to be tight. I have to say that other than minor glitches, this movie simply breezes through.  What other reviewers said about underutilising Frances McDormand, Keanu Reeves, Amanda Peet is true but what bothers me more is that whilst all efforts are made to ensure that Jack's and Diane's characters are as wholesome as possible, Keanu's character seems to be a cookie cutter character with a rather two dimension perspective.  Whilst the ending is what all dreamers like you and I are wanting, right in the snowy night in Paris, and that they all live happily ever after, I find it too formulaic and too good to be true.  Still, the journey heading to the final destination is such a joy to watch.  There are elements in this movie that reminds me fondly of ""The Producers"" which is now to be converted into a movie medium.  I find the DVD great with two versions of commentary, one with the main cast and the other with the Director and Producer who are covering the dryer and technical aspect of the movie.  The commentary of the cast commenting upon some of their funnier moments in the making of the movie is hillarious and funny for its own sake.  Well, don't miss this one like I did.

The film is a romantic comedy about Harry Sanborn (Mr. Nicholson), a 63-year-old playboy who is infamous for never having been married.  Harry has a penchant for women half his age and the film opens with him driving to the Hamptons home of 30-year-old Marin (Amanda Peet).  Marin's mother is a famous playwright, Erica Barry (Ms. Keaton) who is not supposed home.  While Harry is in the kitchen, Erica &amp; her sister Zoe (Frances McDormand) come into the house and mistake him for an intruder.  When Erica finds out he is dating her daughter, she immediately dislikes Harry.  While engaged in some foreplay with Marin, Harry suffers a mild heart attack and is rushed to hospital.  The scene of Harry being taken in on a gurney will be repeated several times throughout the film.  The attending physician, Dr. Julian Mercer, turns out to be a big fan of Erica's and asks her out to dinner.  Harry is forced to recuperate at Erica's house and sparks fly between the two and they end up sleeping together.  The romance doesn't last as Harry is not the commitment type and Erica is heartbroken.  The play Erica is writing ends up to be about the their relationship and it is a smash hit and Erica ends up with Julian.  Harry has second thoughts about the relationship and eventually tracks Erica down to Paris where she is with Julian.  In the end, Erica &amp; Harry end up together with Marin being married and having a baby.  Ms. Keaton won a great deal of praise for her role including winning a Golden Globe and garnering an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.  While Ms. Keaton is good in her role, her character seems a bit too whiny.  The premise of the movie is supposed to be that middle-aged woman are desirable as they have strength, smarts and looks even though middle-aged men overlook them for younger women.  Ms. Keaton comes off as flighty and emotionally high strung that puts her against the premises.  Her relationship with the much younger doctor is the retort to Harry's dalliances with younger women, but it doesn't seem to be a believable relationship.  Mr. Nicholson is perfect in his role, as he is essentially playing a character he has played numerous times.  Ms. Peet is also quite good as is Ms. McDormand in a under utilized part.",3,Something Between Nicholson &amp; Keaton,1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,2394,"['Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'amp', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'first', 'time', '1981', 'Reds', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Harry', 'Sanborn', 'Mr.', 'Nicholson', '63-year-old', 'playboy', 'who', 'infamous', 'never', 'having', 'been', 'married', 'Harry', 'penchant', 'women', 'age', 'film', 'driving', 'Hamptons', 'home', '30-year-old', 'Marin', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Marin', 'mother', 'famous', 'playwright', 'Erica', 'Barry', 'Ms.', 'Keaton', 'who', 'not', 'supposed', 'home', 'Harry', 'kitchen', 'Erica', 'amp', 'sister', 'Zoe', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'come', 'house', 'mistake', 'intruder', 'When', 'Erica', 'out', 'dating', 'daughter', 'immediately', 'Harry', 'engaged', 'foreplay', 'Marin', 'Harry', 'mild', 'heart', 'attack', 'rushed', 'hospital', 'scene', 'Harry', 'being', 'taken', 'gurney', 'will', 'be', 'repeated', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'attending', 'physician', 'Dr.', 'Julian', 'Mercer', 'out', 'be', 'big', 'fan', 'Erica', 'out', 'dinner', 'Harry', 'forced', 'recuperate', 'Erica', 'house', 'fly', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'sleeping', 'together', 'romance', ""n't"", 'last', 'Harry', 'not', 'commitment', 'type', 'Erica', 'heartbroken', 'play', 'Erica', 'writing', 'up', 'be', 'relationship', 'smash', 'hit', 'Erica', 'up', 'Julian', 'Harry', 'second', 'thoughts', 'relationship', 'eventually', 'tracks', 'Erica', 'down', 'Paris', 'where', 'Julian', 'end', 'Erica', 'amp', 'Harry', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'Marin', 'being', 'married', 'having', 'baby', 'Ms.', 'Keaton', 'won', 'great', 'deal', 'praise', 'role', 'including', 'winning', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'garnering', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Ms.', 'Keaton', 'good', 'role', 'character', 'bit', 'too', 'whiny', 'premise', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'are', 'desirable', 'have', 'strength', 'smarts', 'even', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'overlook', 'younger', 'women', 'Ms.', 'Keaton', 'off', 'flighty', 'emotionally', 'high', 'strung', 'premises', 'relationship', 'much', 'younger', 'doctor', 'retort', 'Harry', 'dalliances', 'younger', 'women', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'believable', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Nicholson', 'perfect', 'role', 'essentially', 'playing', 'character', 'played', 'numerous', 'times', 'Ms.', 'Peet', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Ms.', 'McDormand', 'utilized', 'part']",N/A

With absolute greats like Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton as well as a great supporting cast ""Somethings Gotta Give"" is a beautiful film to watch and enjoy.  Sure the premise of the film - that a sixty-something bachelor could keep hooking up with young sexy twenty-somethings may seem a bit out of line but I am sure that there are plenty of twenty-somethings that find rich powerful and older men attractive.  But either way one must suspend their disbelief in order to properly enjoy comedy.  The film brings together a pair of middle aged adults that complement each other beautifully but don't realize it until the very end.  I don't want to further tell of the plot in the case that you fall into the 1% of people who haven't seen this one but do yourself a favor and check this one out.Using beautiful locations like the Hamptons, New York City and Paris the films is spectacular and with an equally sumptuous soundtrack the film could be great even without the dialogue.  Then add in some great writing and its magic.  The only drawback is Keanu Reeves who's acting ability never seems to be convincing.  If they had cast Collin Farrell (or even Will Farrell) the film could have been better but overall this is a really enjoyable film that is suitable for nearly all audiences. While it may not be demographically engineered toward young audiences that doesnt detract and when our film industry provides so much content toward them and adult romantic comedy is totally welcome.

As ably directed by Nancy Meyers whose previous work in What Women Want is also first-rate, the cast is excellent and  Diane Keaton's Academy Award nomination for best actress (as Erica Barry) in a leading role was well-deserved. I also expected a nomination for Jack Nicholson as Harry Sanborn. The supporting cast is also fine, notably Frances McDormand (Zoe Barry) and Keanu Reeves (Julian Mercer). The core situation is that the wealthy and charming Harry is dating (at least for the moment) Erica's daughter Marin (Amanda Peet) and accompanies her for a weekend in the Hamptons where her divorcee mother (a successful playwright) has a lovely oceanside home. Of course, Erica and her sister Zoe appear unexpectedly.As a result of his hedonistic lifestyle, Harry suffers a heart attack unrelated to Erica. After emergency care by Julian, he is released but must reside nearby during the recovery period. Guess where? Of course, he and Erica fall in love. Meanwhile, prior to Harry's appearance in his life, Julian had become strongly attracted to Erica...not to her daughter. Apparently she has had no romance in her life since the divorce and is currently hard at work on a new play which is not going very well. Harry eventually becomes well enough to return to Manhattan. And then....Eventually, both Harry and Erica must make very difficult choices. It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen this film to explain what those decisions prove to be. However, I feel free to say that the decisions are juxtaposed very effectively with various humorous incidents, a few of which are featured in the trailer shown in theaters. Yes, this is a comedy but it also has some attitude. On occasion, an edge. There are implications to the lives which the two seniors have led, prior to their meeting. The resolutions of various conflicts (both major and minor) are entirely plausible, except -- in my opinion -- for one which involves Erica and Julian. See this entertaining, sometimes serious film and then reach your own conclusions.The special features provided with the DVD include a ""Commentary"" by director Nancy Meyers, producer Bruce Brock, and actress Diane Keaton, another ""Commentary"" by director Nancy Meyers and actor Jack Nicholson, a ""Hamptons House Set Tour"" with Amanda Peet, and ""Harry Sings Karaoke to Erica"" (a deleted scene).

Nicholson, for example, plays the same sort of hate-to-love-him misfit who redeems himself before the credits that he played in the more originalAs Good As It Gets. Having said that, the quality of the acting and directing make this as good as formula gets; which is to say, quite enjoyable.The characterizations, and the choices the characters make, are sure to ruffle the feathers of those with an ideological axe to grind. But ideological commitments are hardly the basis for a romance, or a successful relationship. Reeves is charming as the earnest, smart younger man who does everything right. The dilemma for Keaton's character is that he doesn't understand her the way that Nicholson's character does.My biggest disappointment is not with the choice Keaton's character makes--the movie would work either way. What's disappointing is that a character who has been portrayed as an intelligent, mature adult ultimately has her choice made for her.

Nancy Meyers' follow-up to &quot;What Women Want&quot; is better suited to the elder crowd, though Meyers panders to youth's twin peaks of materialism and beauty worship by casting Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves.Nicholson is Harry, a music mogul who's into chasing the short skirt, preferably one half his age, with bangs and perky expression - like Marin (Peet), art auctioneer. The two head to Marin's mother's ocean house in The Hamptons where, predictably, Harry is discovered, in his boxers, by Marin's mother, Erica (Keaton), an acclaimed playwright although, when we see her dialogue later, it's not exactly Arthur Miller.Erica objects to Marin's choice, Harry tosses off a few salvos and grins at dinner, and before Harry and Marin can consummate their courtship, Harry keels and has heart attack.Harry's prescription: He has to recover in Erica's house. And the doctor who ordered that prescription, played by Reeves, is a fan - and maybe more - of Erica. The heart attack offers a glimpse of mortality to Harry. He decides, at long last - he needs someone in his own decade with whom to share.Meyers trades in dissecting fears of the alpha male - &quot;What Women Want&quot; and &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; - and the career woman - &quot;Baby Boom.&quot; In &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; she tries to pull those two personas into a relationship and makes two errors: Working with Keaton for a fourth time and saddling her with Reeves, hilariously cast as a hunk doctor who brings baskets of peaches by in the morning.Keaton is borderline creepy, certainly a drag. And, well, playwrights can be. But Keaton never burns off the frigidness of her first scenes. It is &quot;Annie Hall?&quot; Not quite. It's closer to her performance in Woodys Allen's masterwork, &quot;Manhattan.&quot; You know, the one where she gets left in the end. Either way, she's no match or spark for Jack. Frances McDormand, who plays Erica's sister, Zoe, in a cameo, was the right actress. Surprisingly enough, Peet is quite good as the sweet, plucky Marin. You'd much rather spend a day with her than her mother.And unlike &quot;What Women Want,&quot; which genuinely concerned itself with advertising, Harry and Erica's careers mostly run along the stream of romantic hijinks, like dogs. Being powerful and wealthy would partially explain Harry's interest in women who are okay with short-term flings; the mogul business doesn't suit itself to spouses for very long.",3,Jack's back but Keaton ain't quite his match,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,2851,"['quot', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'quot', 'proved', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'could', 'still', 'disappear', 'character', 'knock', 'park', 'quot', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'quot', 'can', 'well', 'turn', 'back', 'Jack.Nicholson', 'grins', 'preens', 'struts', 'way', 'movie', 'gentleman', 'diva', 'trying', 'rescue', 'overloaded', 'plot', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'rather', 'stale', 'performance', 'awarded', 'was', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'follow-up', 'quot', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'quot', 'better', 'suited', 'elder', 'crowd', 'Meyers', 'panders', 'youth', 'twin', 'peaks', 'materialism', 'beauty', 'worship', 'casting', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Keanu', 'Reeves.Nicholson', 'Harry', 'music', 'mogul', 'who', 'chasing', 'short', 'skirt', 'preferably', 'one', 'half', 'age', 'bangs', 'perky', 'expression', 'Marin', 'Peet', 'art', 'auctioneer', 'two', 'head', 'Marin', 'mother', 'ocean', 'house', 'Hamptons', 'where', 'predictably', 'Harry', 'discovered', 'boxers', 'Marin', 'mother', 'Erica', 'Keaton', 'acclaimed', 'playwright', 'when', 'see', 'dialogue', 'later', 'not', 'exactly', 'Arthur', 'Miller.Erica', 'Marin', 'choice', 'Harry', 'few', 'salvos', 'grins', 'dinner', 'Harry', 'Marin', 'can', 'consummate', 'courtship', 'Harry', 'keels', 'heart', 'attack.Harry', 'prescription', 'recover', 'Erica', 'house', 'doctor', 'who', 'ordered', 'prescription', 'played', 'Reeves', 'fan', 'maybe', 'more', 'Erica', 'heart', 'attack', 'glimpse', 'mortality', 'Harry', 'long', 'last', 'someone', 'own', 'decade', 'whom', 'share.Meyers', 'trades', 'dissecting', 'fears', 'alpha', 'male', 'quot', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'quot', 'quot', 'Father', 'Bride', 'quot', 'career', 'woman', 'quot', 'Baby', 'Boom.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'quot', 'pull', 'two', 'personas', 'relationship', 'two', 'errors', 'Working', 'Keaton', 'fourth', 'time', 'saddling', 'Reeves', 'hilariously', 'cast', 'hunk', 'doctor', 'who', 'baskets', 'peaches', 'morning.Keaton', 'borderline', 'creepy', 'certainly', 'drag', 'well', 'playwrights', 'can', 'be', 'Keaton', 'never', 'off', 'frigidness', 'first', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'Not', 'quite', 'closer', 'performance', 'Woodys', 'Allen', 'masterwork', 'quot', 'Manhattan.', 'quot', 'know', 'one', 'where', 'left', 'end', 'way', 'match', 'spark', 'Jack', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'who', 'Erica', 'sister', 'Zoe', 'cameo', 'was', 'right', 'actress', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'Peet', 'quite', 'good', 'sweet', 'plucky', 'Marin', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'spend', 'day', 'mother.And', 'quot', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'quot', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'advertising', 'Harry', 'Erica', 'careers', 'mostly', 'run', 'along', 'stream', 'romantic', 'hijinks', 'dogs', 'Being', 'powerful', 'wealthy', 'would', 'partially', 'explain', 'Harry', 'interest', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'okay', 'short-term', 'flings', 'mogul', 'business', ""n't"", 'suit', 'spouses', 'very', 'long']",N/A

Erica (Diane Keaton), a playwright and the girlfriend's mother, comes to the house unexpectedly, meets Jack, and we're off.The first section of the film feels like a manifesto, as the pros and cons of older men dating younger women is debated. When Harry has a heart attack and is forced to stay at Keaton's house things perk up a bit. The movie calms down and the two stars get a chance to shine. Keaton is very good as a woman coming back to life,and Nicholson, though asked to do less, has some good moments coming to grips with his age for the first time. The large cast also includes a loose Keanu Reeves as a doctor who falls for Erica and Frances McDormand,wry, as Erica's sister.The last third of the movie is a bit of a ramble, writer/director Nancy Meyers can't tie it up as neatly as it should be. Throughout much of the film, the idea of older people being intimate is seen as weird, and indeed Nicholson and Keaton's sex scene is played very broadly.

You have Diane Keeton who plays Ericka a play write, who is pretty bitter about older men who seem to go for younger women.  Yet her own daughter who is in her early 30's is dating a man (Jack) who happens to be 63 years old!!  Harry is older, and is pretty commitment phobic, so he believes in dating and having fun.  Harry is also prone to lots of hospital visits due to his heart problems.  So Ericka's daughter decides to end her relationship with Harry because she spotted the chemistry between her mom and Harry.  Now knowing that Harry is such a commit phobe, you would think that Ericka would ignore Harry and enjoy the attention she is getting from Julian (Keanu's character) who is totally smitten with her.  No, she sleeps with Harry, it means a lot more to her, then it meant to him, and when he admits he only wants to be friends she spends a good deal of the movie crying.  Now the crying was okay the first few minutes, it was funny at first.  Then it got on my nerves !!!  Her heartbreak helps her complete her play she is writing, and Harry is the subject of her new play that becomes a hit.  Ericka's daughter is all upset her father is going to marry a woman who is only a few years older then her.  Do you see the irony?  Ericka goes to Paris, and Harry finally realizing he is in love with her goes to surprise her.  However, the surprise is on him when he realizes that Julian is with her.  The chemistry once again is evident, and Ericka goes after Harry.  I'm sorry, but Julian is so much cuter!!!!I also have a feeling my age may have had something to do with why I did not enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would.  I'm 36 and the thought of dating someone 63 does not appeal to me.  If I were older, I would not be upset that men older prefer younger men. The other issue I had with the movie was this.  During the scene when Ericka and Harry was about to have sex, they mention birth control, but when she mentioned ""menopause"" all the sudden everything was GREAT.  Now I know this is a movie, but what about using a condom so you don't have to worry about the spread of STD's or HIV?

798217,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B0001AVZA8,S. Schell,"[0, 0]","To quote John Mellencamp, this ""little ditty `bout Jack and Diane"" called ""Something's Gotta Give"" is somewhat of a sleeper comedy nowadays but still managed to give Diane Keaton a Golden Globe for Best Actress (as well as an Academy Award nomination) in 2004.  Co-star Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Golden Globe as well for his performance and these are two of the best reasons to watch the film.Keaton is Erica Barry, a divorcee and accomplished playwright who decides to spend some time at her beach house in the summer with her sister Zoe (McDormand).  When she arrives, she is shocked to find a man digging around in her fridge, clothed only in his oxford shirt, boxers and dress socks.  With Erica threatening to phone the police, the man quickly introduces himself as Harry Sanborn (Nicholson) and explains that he is there with her daughter Marin (Peete) for the weekend.  Embarrassed that he has been caught in his skivvies, he insists that he will leave but Zoe pipes in, suggesting that all four of them spend some quality time.  This is where the fun begins.Over dinner that evening, Erica quickly learns that Harry is a chauvinistic playboy, Marin another notch on the belt of his quest to desperately cling to his youth.  Harry senses Erica's disdain not only for his capricious behavior but also her disapproval of his relationship with Marin and reciprocates the hostility, quite certain that they will not get along no matter what happens.  What neither of them bank on is keeping up the venomous front for several weeks while Harry recovers from a heart attack he suffers that night.At the urging of his doctor Julian Mercer (Reeves), Harry recuperates close to the hospital, Erica reluctantly providing hospice.  Born out of what is at first an irksome period is a surprising camaraderie and eventual love affair, one that turns Erica's world upside down.  Aside from her exhilarating dalliances with Harry, she is simultaneously squired by the handsome Julian, a man nearly half her age.  Erica's once ho-hum life is thrown into an emotional upheaval, her heart quickly set aflame and just as quickly extinguished by the wayward Harry.  Not one to let a broken heart disrupt her life completely, she uses her romantic foibles as the primary tool for penning another successful play, one which more or less tells the entire story of her brief romance.Screenwriter and director Nancy Meyers wrote the parts of Erica and Harry with Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson specifically in mind to play them and they are smart casting choices indeed.  The best pairing since Nicholson himself and Shirley MacLaine in 1983's ""Terms of Endearment"", Erica and Harry are that couple least likely to succeed but when they fall for one another they fall harder than one would care to predict, despite their vastly different personalities and ideals.  Keaton prevails with the comedic timing she possesses in spades whilst Nicholson is the wry and strangely sexy older man that he's so fond of playing.  Reeves, normally armed with the dramatic prowess of knotty pine, is surprisingly looser and warmer here, the most natural and enjoyable performance I've ever seen; for such a minor role, it's without a doubt his best so far.Bottom line: It's obvious at first glance what the film's strong suits are (screenplay and lead actors) and both are in top form here.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a reason not to see two film veterans at the top of their game in one of the better romantic comedies of 2003.",4,One For The Pros,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3509,"['quote', 'John', 'Mellencamp', 'little', 'ditty', 'bout', 'Jack', 'Diane', 'called', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'somewhat', 'sleeper', 'comedy', 'nowadays', 'still', 'managed', 'give', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Actress', 'as', 'well', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', '2004', 'Co-star', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'as', 'well', 'performance', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'reasons', 'watch', 'film.Keaton', 'Erica', 'Barry', 'divorcee', 'accomplished', 'playwright', 'who', 'spend', 'time', 'beach', 'house', 'summer', 'sister', 'Zoe', 'McDormand', 'When', 'shocked', 'find', 'man', 'digging', 'around', 'fridge', 'clothed', 'only', 'oxford', 'shirt', 'boxers', 'dress', 'socks', 'Erica', 'threatening', 'phone', 'police', 'man', 'quickly', 'Harry', 'Sanborn', 'Nicholson', 'there', 'daughter', 'Marin', 'Peete', 'weekend', 'Embarrassed', 'been', 'caught', 'skivvies', 'will', 'leave', 'Zoe', 'pipes', 'suggesting', 'four', 'spend', 'quality', 'time', 'where', 'fun', 'begins.Over', 'dinner', 'evening', 'Erica', 'quickly', 'Harry', 'chauvinistic', 'playboy', 'Marin', 'notch', 'belt', 'quest', 'desperately', 'cling', 'youth', 'Harry', 'Erica', 'disdain', 'not', 'only', 'capricious', 'behavior', 'also', 'disapproval', 'relationship', 'Marin', 'hostility', 'quite', 'certain', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'matter', 'what', 'What', 'bank', 'keeping', 'up', 'venomous', 'front', 'several', 'weeks', 'Harry', 'recovers', 'heart', 'attack', 'urging', 'doctor', 'Julian', 'Mercer', 'Reeves', 'Harry', 'close', 'hospital', 'Erica', 'reluctantly', 'providing', 'hospice', 'Born', 'what', 'first', 'irksome', 'period', 'surprising', 'camaraderie', 'eventual', 'love', 'affair', 'one', 'Erica', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'Aside', 'exhilarating', 'dalliances', 'Harry', 'simultaneously', 'squired', 'handsome', 'Julian', 'man', 'nearly', 'half', 'age', 'Erica', 'once', 'ho-hum', 'life', 'thrown', 'emotional', 'upheaval', 'heart', 'quickly', 'set', 'aflame', 'just', 'quickly', 'extinguished', 'wayward', 'Harry', 'Not', 'one', 'let', 'broken', 'heart', 'disrupt', 'life', 'completely', 'romantic', 'foibles', 'primary', 'tool', 'penning', 'successful', 'play', 'one', 'more', 'less', 'entire', 'story', 'brief', 'romance.Screenwriter', 'director', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'wrote', 'parts', 'Erica', 'Harry', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'specifically', 'mind', 'play', 'are', 'smart', 'casting', 'choices', 'indeed', 'best', 'pairing', 'Nicholson', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', '1983', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'Erica', 'Harry', 'are', 'couple', 'least', 'likely', 'succeed', 'when', 'fall', 'one', 'fall', 'harder', 'one', 'would', 'care', 'predict', 'vastly', 'different', 'personalities', 'ideals', 'Keaton', 'comedic', 'timing', 'spades', 'whilst', 'Nicholson', 'wry', 'strangely', 'sexy', 'older', 'man', 'so', 'fond', 'playing', 'Reeves', 'normally', 'armed', 'dramatic', 'prowess', 'knotty', 'pine', 'surprisingly', 'looser', 'warmer', 'here', 'most', 'natural', 'enjoyable', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'minor', 'role', 'doubt', 'best', 'so', 'far.Bottom', 'line', 'obvious', 'first', 'glance', 'what', 'film', 'strong', 'suits', 'are', 'screenplay', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'here', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'reason', 'not', 'see', 'two', 'film', 'veterans', 'top', 'game', 'one', 'better', 'romantic', 'comedies', '2003']",N/A

I'm not talking 60+ Harrison Ford with anorexic 30-something ""Alley McBeal"" sexually active, but two people over 50 sexually active with each other.  In fact, both, I think, are actually in their sixties.  Hollywood is obssessed with either youth or the older man/younger woman relationship.  We rarely see young men with older women or two 50+ individuals in a romantic relationship.It's also wonderful to see mature women not embarrassed or ashamed of how they've aged.  Diane Keaton looked radiant in the film; I don't care what age she is.  There are many other actresses these days who have aged very gracefully and are still a pleasure to see on the silver screen.

You expect someone that has been around as long as Diane Keaton to be good, but she was on the edge of annoying.In summary, Jack Nicholson and his girlfriend (Amanda Peet) are set to spend a weekend at her mother's summer house. He is a lifelong bachelor with a thing for much younger women. After a heart attack that sidelines him, a reluctant romance blossoms between him and Diane Keaton, who plays Amanda Peet's mother. She is stuffy and wears a lot of turtlenecks, and without saying a whole lot more to give it away, this predictable and lighthearted comedy-romance is severely flawed by several factors.Keanu Reeves playing a doctor. While he did not ruin the part in playing it, and actually turned out a solid performance on his part, he is not terribly believable, and his character's obssession with Diane Keaton could not be believable if a really great actor played him. In this case, it was not his fault, but the fault of the person that wrote the story.Diane Keaton may have been cute when she was younger and overacting, but now, it's just annoying. I never realized how silly she was as an actress until I saw this movie, and she was a huge disappointment. She makes faces, gets hysterical, and her drawn out crying jag isn't funny, it makes a person want to grab her by the hair and smack her.The movie has its moments.

798229,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B0001AVZA8,The Cool Guy,"[0, 6]","I was surprised that this was rated PG-13. When you see some mommy-bags, normally that indicates an R rating. But then again, it was pretty brief. So I guess it would count more as a flashing. Basically, we got flashed by Diane Keaton. The only thing that would have made that scene better would be if she had been wearing a trenchcoat.Getting serious now, the movie was not bad. Although it seemed pretty obvious to me that it was written by a woman. Yes, women DO get the shaft when it comes to age. When a guy gets older, people usually consider him to be more distinguished-looking. When it happens to a woman, its botox time. This is definitely a double-standard in our society, but it's just that guys really don't spend a heck of a lot of time worrying about it.Another good indication that it was written by a woman was the whole thing about a woman getting revenge on her ex-boyfriend by writing a play that totally trashes him. I know it is just a movie, but I would say that that is a pretty crappy thing to do to ANYBODY - womanizer or not.And the final indicator was the whole thing about the young, rich, single doctor chasing the upper-middle aged woman. How many times does that happen in real life? Pretty seldom, which puts this safely in the realm of female fantasy rather than romantic comedy.The fact that it was obviously written by a woman is not in itself necessarily a problem. The problem is that the female writer has turned this movie into her own personal fantasy, which is something that I as a guy am not all that interested in.Don't get me wrong. As a guy, I can appreciate a good romantic comedy every now and then. A ""Chick Flick"", so to speak. But I don't like it when romantic movies so obviously play towards only a certain sexes' point of view. That makes the movie more of a female romantic fantasy than anything else. There's nothing wrong with that for people who like to watch that sort of thing. But that pretty much puts the movie in the ""Romantic Comedy Made By Women for Women"" category.All that philosophizing aside, the movie had some pretty good moments. My favorite was the scenes with the email exchanges, with little subtle flirts going back and forth. Yeah, it was kind of corny, but I thought it was pretty realistic as far as how normal people interact. And the realistic things are what make a movie funny and good sometimes.One of the best moments was when Jack's character started to type, ""I Miss Y-"" and then couldn't go on. That part was really well-written.Probably the worst casting in this movie was Keanu Reeves. I mean, I love the guy in ""The Matrix"". I even like him in ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure."" But in this movie, the chemistry just was not there. I kept trying to see him with Diane Keaton and no matter how I looked at it, it just did not fit. Keanu's acting wasn't bad or anything. And it's not just the age problem. It just did not work. Maybe it's because Keanu Reeves still looks like a 20-year-old in my mind, and that is just TOO young. I think somebody else would have made a much better pick to play the young doctor, though I don't know who.There is one thing though that irks me about this movie more than anything else, and Hollywood is notorious for it. What is Hollywood's fetish with always showing divorced people still hanging out together as ""just friends."" HELLO? That is about the most unrealistic thing I know.Here is THE REAL WORLD: When people get divorced, 99.9% of the time the husband and wife can't stand each other and don't want to see each other ever again. If they are coworkers, one of them quits and goes to a new job just to get away from that sorry SOB. They DO NOT invite each other to each other's house ""just to hang."" They DO NOT continue working closely with each other. And most importantly, they DO NOT go on dinner dates with each other!I just honestly do not understand this thing that Hollywood has with just showing people sleep together, move in together, have a kid, get married, then get divorced, then still stay good ""Friends."" What the heck? That NEVER works in real life.Maybe they show it that way because of the high divorce rate in Hollywood; people get married and divorced there all the time. It's no big deal there - kind of like ordering your meal. If you didn't like what you got, you just send it back and get something else. It's not that way in the rest of America, and I get pretty sick and tired of having that twisted morality shoved down my throat.Aside from that particular soapbox rant, I'd say that it is a decent movie. Not one I'd probably want to see again, but a Chick Flick worth renting at least. And I'm talking to you guys who have made your wives sit through too many Stallone movies with you. You need to give something back every now and then, fellas!",4,Pretty Good,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,4814,"['was', 'surprised', 'was', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'When', 'see', 'mommy-bags', 'normally',

So I expected a generic Hollywood love story, and was given a generic Hollywood love story, so nothing new. But the film does have a strong cast with Jack Nocholson, Diane Keaton, Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet, and the acting is good throughout, Jack plays himself as always (best Jack Nicholson film is As Good As It Gets), after a surprising performance in About Schmidt. Diane Keaton does well and so do the two supporting roles.The film is mainly based on a man who dates a model and falls in love with her mother, you can probably guess who plays the parts. So, a dull plot, but that's ok, dull plots don't always kill a film. But dragging it on for an extra hour does. There is simply not enough plot for a two plus hour film, I felt like I was watching Lord of The Rings with old lovers. The film looked like it was going to end, then....no, we have to see ANOTHER SCENE, then it's going to end maybe.....no, maybe....no, maybe.....no. This does not make for good viewing unless you are very patient, VERY patient.

Jack Nicholson plays the elderly letch and Diane Keaton the woman who is able to cure Jack of his inability to grow up. To further emphasize  the fact that age should not be a problem for women there is a side plot in which a much younger Keanu Reeves also falls for Keaton.The problem with the film is that it is simply not engaging. The initial scene is really pretty revolting. Nicholson has been able to chat up a young woman by a commercial favour. She is an auctioneer and he has bought a lot of the goods she is selling. They head off for a dirty weekend at her mothers beech house and shock horror the mother discovers them. The premise of the movie depends on Keaton finding the Nicholson character both interesting and attrative.One would have thought that the initial reaction of a mother to an elderly letch who tried to buy the affection of her daughter would be revulsion. However everyone is very calm about it all. Later a health scare throws Nicholson and Keating together. However the dialogue is sparse and it beggars belief that the two main characters could find anthing interesting in the other. Keaton is meant to be a succesful playright. However she never discusses anything from an interlectual perspective in the film. She plays the same role that she used to in Woodie Alan movies, that of a daffy sort of cute woman. One would have thought that a real life playwright would have at least some gravitas.A larger problem is that the film depends on Nicholson being attractive. However he is given no lines that suggest that he is witty intelligent or has much of an insight into life. In reality his one attraction is that he is rich a record producer.The film has one or two mildly funny scences but in reality it is simply not funny or witty enough to engage the audience. It depends on the audience starting with feelings of a posative nature towards Keaton and Nicholson as the script cannot really generate it.The script deals with an interesting issue, that is that young women are not the all in sexual attraction but the other values of the film, money in itself is attrative for one, overwhelm the viewer and make him/her slightly repulsed by the whole excercise.",1,Pretty average,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,2317,"['premise', '60', 'year', 'old', 'womanizer', 'who', 'only', 'dated', 'women', '30', 'falls', '50', 'mother', 'one', 'dates', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'elderly', 'letch', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'woman', 'who', 'able', 'cure', 'Jack', 'inability', 'grow', 'up', 'further', 'emphasize', 'fact', 'age', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'problem', 'women', 'side', 'plot', 'much', 'younger', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'also', 'Keaton.The', 'problem', 'film', 'simply', 'not', 'engaging', 'initial', 'scene', 'really', 'pretty', 'revolting', 'Nicholson', 'been', 'able', 'chat', 'up', 'young', 'woman', 'commercial', 'favour', 'auctioneer', 'bought', 'lot', 'goods', 'selling', 'head', 'dirty', 'weekend', 'mothers', 'beech', 'house', 'shock', 'horror', 'mother', 'premise', 'movie', 'Keaton', 'finding', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'interesting', 'attrative.One', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'initial', 'reaction', 'mother', 'elderly', 'letch', 'who', 'tried', 'buy', 'affection', 'daughter', 'would', 'be', 'revulsion', 'However', 'everyone', 'very', 'calm', 'Later', 'health', 'scare', 'Nicholson', 'Keating', 'together', 'However', 'dialogue', 'sparse', 'belief', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'could', 'find', 'anthing', 'interesting', 'other', 'Keaton', 'meant', 'be', 'succesful', 'playright', 'However', 'never', 'anything', 'interlectual', 'perspective', 'film', 'same', 'role', 'used', 'Woodie', 'Alan', 'movies', 'daffy', 'sort', 'cute', 'woman', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'real', 'life', 'playwright', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'gravitas.A', 'larger', 'problem', 'film', 'Nicholson', 'being', 'attractive', 'However', 'given', 'lines', 'suggest', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'much', 'insight', 'life', 'reality', 'one', 'attraction', 'rich', 'record', 'producer.The', 'film', 'one', 'two', 'mildly', 'funny', 'scences', 'reality', 'simply', 'not', 'funny', 'witty', 'enough', 'engage', 'audience', 'audience', 'starting', 'feelings', 'posative', 'nature', 'towards', 'Keaton', 'Nicholson', 'script', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'generate', 'it.The', 'script', 'deals', 'interesting', 'issue', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'other', 'values', 'film', 'money', 'attrative', 'one', 'viewer', 'make', 'him/her', 'slightly', 'repulsed', 'whole', 'excercise']",N/A

The story is not a surprising one, because it is a romantic comedy, of which ending we all know before the film starts.  But the point is, it is an enjoyable, and in a sense, quite a unique film thanks to the two great leads -- Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson.  And greatness in that order.Jack Nicholson's chracter Harry is a successful businessman who made his fortune in music industry.  He is 63 years old, but makes it a rule to date only a girl below a certain age, like, 20.  And now, he is happily having a fun with beautiful Marin played by Amanda Peet.But now, in a quiet seaside house, he meets someone who might or might not make him bend the golden rule of dating.  Interestingly, it is the last person Harry himself expected to fall in love with ... Erika, who happens to be Marin's mother.The comlication goes on when Keanu Reeves's character as a dosctor steps in, but &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; belongs strictly to these experienced veterans who know how to infuse the life into the formulaic characters written by director Nancy Meyers.  In spite of the predictable nature of the story, she knows the way to induce the stars to deliver the best as in &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; or &quot;What Women Wants,&quot; and it is a pure delight to see the talented actors doing what they can.In fact, Diane Keaton, even about 25 years after her Annie Hall, shows the natural charms that would convince us that a mature woman like her can easily enchant guys like Jack Nicholson, and some would be amazed at her decision to let the film include (brief) nudity.  Speaking of nudity, Jack also reveals some part of his body in a hospital, in a quite hilarious (or to some, embarrassing) way.  Still, he is thesame Jack Nicholson, which means he lost none of his charisma even in his 60s.The supports include Frances McDormand and Jon Favreau, but unfortunately, their characters are virtually forgotten in the second half of the film, as if cut from the final version to make room for Keaton and Nicolson.  It is quite regrettable that we miss the conversations between Diane and Frances as sisters, which would be another fun to hear.Like &quot;What Women Want,&quot; this romantic comedy is sustained by the leading actors' pleasing and deft performance.

798234,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0001AVZA8,Tucker Andersen,"[7, 9]","SEE THIS FILM IF YOU LIKE TRULY FUNNY ROMANTIC COMEDIES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A MEANINGFUL STORYLINE. My wife was a little reluctant to see this movie given her lack of appreciation for the sort of roles in which Jack Nicholson often stars, but the favorable reviews, potentially appealing subject matter and my desire to see this film overcame her objections and we both enjoyed it immensely. (This was definitely his best performance since AS GOOD AS IT GETS.) Usually I have no trouble finding some meaningless moments during a movie to get the free soda and popcorn refills or take a bathroom break, but the action here was so constant that I was afraid that I would miss something meaningful to the storyline if I left the theater for a few minutes.The plot is really simple. Erica Barry is a famous playwright in her midfifties who has reacted to her divorce by rededicating herself to her work and efforts at self improvement and settled into a routine that doesn't leave time to contemplate the absence of a male in her life. Marin (Amanda Peet) is her daughter (early thirties) who unbeknownst to Erica has just initiated a relationship with Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson), a very successful sixty-three year old businessman and famous bachelor/womanizer. When Harry and Erica unexpectedly meet at Erica's retreat in the Hamptons, an atmosphere of hostility between them develops almost instantly. That evening, Erica saves Harry's life following his heart attack and meets an admirer in Harry's ER physician, Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves), who has seen every play that she has ever written. In the interests of symmetry, Julian is thirty-four years old, so we have the potential for two May/November affairs and all the potential situations that could arise. Just to make it more interesting, Frances McDormand does a wonderful job of providing commentary as Zoe, Erica's sister and a women's studies professor at Columbia University. But don't jump to conclusions, when Erica is forced to housesit with the convalescing Harry, they both discover that maybe their preconceptions about each other need to be revised.This is a great movie because Director Nancy Meyers gets the best out of the script and the cast. The timing is near perfect. You laugh when they are crying, and shed tears when things go well for them. In fact, the longer a crying jag of Erica's lasted, the more the audience where we attended laughed hysterically. Everything is clich&eacute;d, but these are clich&eacute;s because they are so true to life and so recognizable, not because they are old and tired. Love vs. lust, the passion of youth vs. the experience and tenderness of age, commitment vs. freedom, order vs. spontaneity, they are all part of this story and examined with true feeling and insight.And while the outcome seems predictable, there are enough twists of the plot to keep your interest. This is the sort of humor not dependent on the shock value of profanity, and while the movie is much longer (two hours ) than usual for a romantic comedy, the time passes quickly. And while the denouement was certainly predictable, it managed to be a little bittersweet rather than having the saccharine quality of so many films of this genre.Tucker Andersen",5,A Delightful Film Desperately In Search of a Better Title,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,3249,"['SEE', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'IF', 'YOU', 'LIKE', 'TRULY', 'FUNNY', 'ROMANTIC', 'COMEDIES', 'THAT', 'ACTUALLY', 'HAVE', 'A', 'MEANINGFUL', 'STORYLINE', 'wife', 'was', 'little', 'reluctant', 'see', 'movie', 'given', 'lack', 'appreciation', 'sort', 'roles', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'often', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'potentially', 'appealing', 'subject', 'matter', 'desire', 'see', 'film', 'objections', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'was', 'definitely', 'best', 'performance', 'AS', 'GOOD', 'IT', 'GETS', 'Usually', 'have', 'trouble', 'finding', 'meaningless', 'moments', 'movie', 'get', 'free', 'soda', 'popcorn', 'refills', 'take', 'bathroom', 'break', 'action', 'here', 'was', 'so', 'constant', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'miss', 'something', 'meaningful', 'storyline', 'left', 'theater', 'few', 'minutes.The', 'plot', 'really', 'simple', 'Erica', 'Barry', 'famous', 'playwright', 'midfifties', 'who', 'reacted', 'divorce', 'rededicating', 'work', 'efforts', 'self', 'improvement', 'settled', 'routine', ""n't"", 'leave', 'time', 'contemplate', 'absence', 'male', 'life', 'Marin', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'daughter', 'early', 'thirties', 'who', 'unbeknownst', 'Erica', 'just', 'initiated', 'relationship', 'Harry', 'Sanborn', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'very', 'successful', 'sixty-three', 'year', 'old', 'businessman', 'famous', 'bachelor/womanizer', 'When', 'Harry', 'Erica', 'unexpectedly', 'meet', 'Erica', 'retreat', 'Hamptons', 'atmosphere', 'hostility', 'almost', 'instantly', 'evening', 'Erica', 'Harry', 'life', 'following', 'heart', 'attack', 'admirer', 'Harry', 'ER', 'physician', 'Dr.', 'Julian', 'Mercer', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'who', 'seen', 'play', 'ever', 'written', 'interests', 'symmetry', 'Julian', 'thirty-four', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'potential', 'two', 'May/November', 'affairs', 'potential', 'situations', 'could', 'arise', 'Just', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'wonderful', 'job', 'providing', 'commentary', 'Zoe', 'Erica', 'sister', 'women', 'studies', 'professor', 'Columbia', 'University', 'do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'conclusions', 'when', 'Erica', 'forced', 'housesit', 'convalescing', 'Harry', 'discover', 'maybe', 'preconceptions', 'other', 'need', 'be', 'revised.This', 'great', 'movie', 'Director', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'best', 'script', 'cast', 'timing', 'perfect', 'laugh', 'when', 'are', 'crying', 'shed', 'tears', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'well', 'fact', 'longer', 'crying', 'jag', 'Erica', 'lasted', 'more', 'audience', 'where', 'attended', 'laughed', 'hysterically', 'Everything', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'so', 'true', 'life', 'so', 'recognizable', 'not', 'are', 'old', 'tired', 'Love', 'vs.', 'lust', 'passion', 'youth', 'experience', 'tenderness', 'age', 'commitment', 'vs.', 'freedom', 'order', 'vs.', 'spontaneity', 'are', 'part', 'story', 'examined', 'true', 'feeling', 'insight.And', 'outcome', 'predictable', 'are', 'enough', 'twists', 'plot', 'keep', 'interest', 'sort', 'humor', 'not', 'dependent', 'shock', 'value', 'profanity', 'movie', 'much', 'longer', 'two', 'hours', 'usual', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'time', 'quickly', 'denouement', 'was', 'certainly', 'predictable', 'managed', 'be', 'little', 'bittersweet', 'rather', 'having', 'saccharine', 'quality', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'genre.Tucker', 'Andersen']",N/A

They have a captive audience. 2. This audience would rather look at a tiny screen in the dark than see the Rocky Mountains. 3. People that fly in airplanes are stupid and in menopause (note that, unlike this movie, I am drawing a distinction between these two groups).This movie is nothing more grandiose than a low-grade soft-porn flick for old people. That neither the director nor the target audience realize this only further emphasizes the need for a serious re-evaluation of the voting privelages of the elderly. Personally, I would feel safer if our leaders were selected by 10-year-olds than by the ogling herds of fading Baby Boomers in elastic waisted pants that make up this movie's target audience.Despite what the movie suggests, a man of Jack Nickelson's personal appearance and manner and age would only get a stupid young woman to eagerly wriggle out of her low-rise jeans if he was waving a couple of hundred dollars at her. (Note that the director eagerly waved a good bit more than a couple hundred at the actresses in this movie). Despite the fact that Jack once was young - he is not anymore - much like Joan Collins and Bill Clinton. He is an elderly, liver-spotted fool, and the movie only reminds us of this. I personally find this comforting, since it suggests that, one day, all of the Jack Nickelsons in the world will be dead - and we will thus be rid of them.Of course Diane Keaton is just as laughable. Looking like she's had enough facelifts to safely tuck her chin(s) behind her ears (Diane to her private Surgeon: ""COME ON! PULL IT TIGHTER! MY NEXT MOVIE IS SUPPOSED DEMONSTRATE THAT WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE JUDGED BY THEIR AGE AND LOOKS!""), she has all the emotional clarity that can imaginably be associated with a particularly ugly menopause. Diane is as likely to steal the heart of Keanu Reeves as she is to steal the heart of Alfonso the sea lion. Wait - scratch that - Sea lions are both overly amorous and near-sighted. Someone please tell Diane to steer clear of public aquaria!In an effort to pile one insulting plot-twist on top of another, we are not only forced to watch Jack Nickelson and Diane Keaton hoot and hump all over the screen like a pair of manure-smeared orangutans, but they are unfortunately also given lines. We are thus faced not only with the impossible demand of picturing these miserable old fools constantly scoring young movie stars, but we are also asked to believe that they're clever and witty while doing it. I can only assume that they believe their audience is excessively gullible, lulled by the hormonal imbalances and extreme wishful thinking of a generation that thought JFK was an upright citizen. Then again, I was entrusting my life to a large chunk of machinery that was hurtling through the air 7 miles above the earth while I watched this movie. Who am I to talk about gullibility?This movie demonstrates that, for the ideal retired person of today, the flower of old age - wisdom - has been traded in for a second go at the orangutan pen. If you're one of these old fools - by all means, watch this movie. If there's any dignity and decency left in your balding, liver-spotted skulls, it will awake screaming at the full-frontal assault this movie subjects it to. If this doesn't happen - may I suggest the SkyMall catalogue and a miniature bag of pretzels?",1,Tip: Don't buy the in-flight headset - nap instead,1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,3465,"['Apparently', 'when', 'airlines', 'plan', 'in-flight', 'entertainment', 'cross-country', 'flights', 'go', 'three', 'assumptions', '1', 'have', 'captive', 'audience', '2', 'audience', 'would', 'rather', 'look', 'tiny', 'screen', 'dark', 'see', 'Rocky', 'Mountains', '3', 'People', 'fly', 'airplanes', 'are', 'stupid', 'menopause', 'note', 'movie', 'am', 'drawing', 'distinction', 'two', 'groups', '.This', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'grandiose', 'low-grade', 'soft-porn', 'flick', 'old', 'people', 'director', 'target', 'audience', 'realize', 'only', 'further', 'need', 'serious', 're-evaluation', 'voting', 'privelages', 'elderly', 'Personally', 'would', 'feel', 'safer', 'leaders', 'were', 'selected', '10-year-olds', 'ogling', 'herds', 'fading', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'elastic', 'waisted', 'pants', 'make', 'up', 'movie', 'target', 'audience.Despite', 'what', 'movie', 'man', 'Jack', 'Nickelson', 'personal', 'appearance', 'manner', 'age', 'would', 'only', 'get', 'stupid', 'young', 'woman', 'eagerly', 'wriggle', 'low-rise', 'jeans', 'was', 'waving', 'couple', 'hundred', 'dollars', 'Note', 'director', 'eagerly', 'waved', 'good', 'bit', 'more', 'couple', 'hundred', 'actresses', 'movie', 'fact', 'Jack', 'once', 'was', 'young', 'not', 'anymore', 'much', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'elderly', 'liver-spotted', 'fool', 'movie', 'only', 'personally', 'find', 'comforting', 'one', 'day', 'Jack', 'Nickelsons', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'will', 'thus', 'be', 'rid', 'them.Of', 'course', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'just', 'laughable', 'Looking', 'had', 'enough', 'facelifts', 'safely', 'tuck', 'chin', 's', 'ears', 'Diane', 'private', 'Surgeon', 'COME', 'ON', 'PULL', 'IT', 'TIGHTER', 'MY', 'NEXT', 'MOVIE', 'IS', 'SUPPOSED', 'DEMONSTRATE', 'THAT', 'WOMEN', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'BE', 'JUDGED', 'BY', 'THEIR', 'AGE', 'AND', 'LOOKS', 'emotional', 'clarity', 'can', 'imaginably', 'be', 'associated', 'particularly', 'ugly', 'menopause', 'Diane', 'as', 'likely', 'steal', 'heart', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'steal', 'heart', 'Alfonso', 'sea', 'lion', 'Wait', 'scratch', 'Sea', 'lions', 'are', 'overly', 'amorous', 'near-sighted', 'Someone', 'please', 'tell', 'Diane', 'steer', 'clear', 'public', 'aquaria', 'effort', 'pile', 'one', 'insulting', 'plot-twist', 'top', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'forced', 'watch', 'Jack', 'Nickelson', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'hoot', 'hump', 'screen', 'pair', 'manure-smeared', 'orangutans', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'given', 'lines', 'are', 'thus', 'faced', 'not', 'only', 'impossible', 'demand', 'picturing', 'miserable', 'old', 'fools', 'constantly', 'scoring', 'young', 'movie', 'stars', 'are', 'also', 'asked', 'believe', ""'re"", 'clever', 'witty', 'doing', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'believe', 'audience', 'excessively', 'gullible', 'lulled', 'hormonal', 'imbalances', 'extreme', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'generation', 'thought', 'JFK', 'was', 'upright', 'citizen', 'Then', 'again', 'was', 'entrusting', 'life', 'large', 'chunk', 'machinery', 'was', 'hurtling', 'air', '7', 'miles', 'earth', 'watched', 'movie', 'Who', 'am', 'talk', 'gullibility', 'movie', 'ideal', 'retired', 'person', 'today', 'flower', 'old', 'age', 'wisdom', 'been', 'traded', 'second', 'go', 'orangutan', 'pen', ""'re"", 'one', 'old', 'fools', 'means', 'watch', 'movie', 'dignity', 'decency', 'left', 'balding', 'liver-spotted', 'skulls', 'will', 'awake', 'screaming', 'full-frontal', 'assault', 'movie', ""n't"", 'happen', 'may', 'suggest', 'SkyMall', 'catalogue', 'miniature', 'bag', 'pretzels']",N/A

798238,A38TC59GM2WW1X,B0001AVZA8,"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts""","[3, 3]","Firstly, let me just say that I have never been a fan of Jack the sleazy, old, smug, bald, wifebeating, young-girl chasing (a la Woody Allen) Nicholson.  And after this movie, I'm still not.  Hollywood seems to love him (the man's won numerous oscars), and I just don't get it.  Maybe I'm not meant to.  That said, ""Something's Gotta Give"" was a good movie; well-conceived, clever, and well-directed.  Kudos for Nicholson willing to poke fun at his own age and the incredulity of him dating women young enough to be his daughter (dare I mention, ""As Good As it Gets""?).  But he's still the oily sleazebag who thinks he's all that.  I don't think it's gonna change.The main conflict of the movie revolves around aging playboy Nicholson and young doctor Keanu Reeves both falling for, and competing for the love of Diane Keaton's character.  Keaton is absolutely radiant in this film, seething with feminine charm, with a beauty that seems to defy her age (unlike Nicholson).  Her eyes have never been more expressive, and I think in her younger days she would have played a perfect Elizabeth Bennet from ""Pride and Prejudice"".  Keaton continues to amaze me as the most beautiful and charming woman over 50; in other words, way too good for Nicholson.Keanu Reeves, on break after playing the Messiah Neo, makes a welcomed supporting appearance in this movie.  Reeves plays a handsome, young doctor every bit as suave as Nicholson, just minus the sleaze and dislikeability.  He's instantly smitten with Keaton's character and does his darndest to win her heart.I did not spoil the movie's ending for you:  you already knew the ending, and I already knew the ending.  This movie is about Nicholson and Keaton, so of course they end up together at the end; the only mystery is how the plot ends up there.  Nevertheless, I gotta say the ending left me unsatisfied.  Incredulous to me that Keanu Reeves would loose to...that.  There was no doubt in my heart that Reeves' character would have made a far superior match with Keaton.A professional reviewer from a newspaper claimed that Nicholson and Keaton had real chemistry and a believeable romance going, whereas Keaton's relationship with Reeves was farfetched.  I beg to differ.  To me, the Keaton-Reeves relationship was far more real and believeable.  The writers could have either made Reeves' character so minor that he served only as a plot device that no one cared about, or they could have let him ""get the girl"".  Instead they chose to flesh out his character just enough for us to care about him, and then leave him out in the cold at the very end.  I bet Reeves' character is wishing he never invited Nicholson to sit down at the table at that Paris restaurant.Oh well, I had a good time.  As I said, it was a well-conceived and well-made movie.  Even Nicholson did a good job with his role; I just don't have like him for it.",4,Keanu Reeves lost to THAT?,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,2883,"['Firstly', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Jack', 'sleazy', 'old', 'smug', 'bald', 'wifebeating', 'young-girl', 'chasing', 'la', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Nicholson', 'movie', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'love', 'man', 'won', 'numerous', 'oscars', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'not', 'meant', 'said', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'well-conceived', 'clever', 'well-directed', 'Kudos', 'Nicholson', 'willing', 'poke', 'fun', 'own', 'age', 'incredulity', 'dating', 'women', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'daughter', 'dare', 'mention', 'As', 'Good', 'still', 'oily', 'sleazebag', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'gon', 'change.The', 'main', 'conflict', 'movie', 'aging', 'playboy', 'Nicholson', 'young', 'doctor', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'falling', 'competing', 'love', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'character', 'Keaton', 'absolutely', 'radiant', 'film', 'seething', 'feminine', 'charm', 'beauty', 'defy', 'age', 'Nicholson', 'eyes', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'expressive', 'think', 'younger', 'days', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'perfect', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Keaton', 'amaze', 'most', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'woman', '50', 'other', 'words', 'way', 'too', 'good', 'Nicholson.Keanu', 'Reeves', 'break', 'playing', 'Messiah', 'Neo', 'welcomed', 'supporting', 'appearance', 'movie', 'handsome', 'young', 'doctor', 'bit', 'as', 'suave', 'Nicholson', 'just', 'sleaze', 'dislikeability', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'Keaton', 'character', 'darndest', 'win', 'heart.I', 'did', 'not', 'spoil', 'movie', 'ending', 'already', 'knew', 'ending', 'already', 'knew', 'ending', 'movie', 'Nicholson', 'Keaton', 'course', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'end', 'only', 'mystery', 'how', 'plot', 'up', 'there', 'Nevertheless', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'ending', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'Incredulous', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'would', 'loose', 'was', 'doubt', 'heart', 'Reeves', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'far', 'superior', 'match', 'Keaton.A', 'professional', 'reviewer', 'newspaper', 'claimed', 'Nicholson', 'Keaton', 'had', 'real', 'chemistry', 'believeable', 'romance', 'going', 'Keaton', 'relationship', 'Reeves', 'was', 'farfetched', 'beg', 'differ', 'Keaton-Reeves', 'relationship', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'real', 'believeable', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Reeves', 'character', 'so', 'minor', 'served', 'only', 'plot', 'device', 'one', 'cared', 'could', 'have', 'let', 'get', 'girl', 'Instead', 'chose', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'just', 'enough', 'care', 'then', 'leave', 'out', 'cold', 'very', 'end', 'bet', 'Reeves', 'character', 'wishing', 'never', 'invited', 'Nicholson', 'sit', 'down', 'table', 'Paris', 'restaurant.Oh', 'well', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'said', 'was', 'well-conceived', 'well-made', 'movie', 'Even', 'Nicholson', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have']",N/A

When Jack goes thru his usual histrionics and responses, it is way funnier than thing any offered on sitcom TeeVee. This ugly satyr always gets the object of his desire...except, if he has a nasty chest pain or a heart attack or two. Which then makes him come face to face with his mortality. Or, in this case, the unrobed mistress of the house. To me, it is somehow fitting that Keaton is in both movies starring exLotharios Nicholson and Warren Beatty (Town and Country). However, in Town and Country she is the woman as wife to the adulterer. Here, they flipped the script a bit and play her as the woman to be desired and the filmakers do her justice by showing her beauty, wrinkles and all.You will be stunned as Keaton walks thru the door, dressed to go out to dinner with the younger Reeves. (There were audible gasps in the theatre my wife and I attended.)Unfortunately, however, you can see where the film is going to end up a mile away. But before that happens you will see two of Hollywoods best--at the top of their games, sparring one another.
