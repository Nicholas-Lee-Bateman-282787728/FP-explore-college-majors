562539,A319SKSB556033,B00005094M,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[12, 12]","FATAL FURYThe Fatal Fury franchise is full of promises and this first animated feature takes the characters beyond the video game boundaries. It's cool how the fighters (Terry Bogard especially) are written as being normal and sensitive rather than always butch, evil and trying to start a fight. The characters in the Street Fighter series were too much like this but Terry Bogard always appears innocent and his adult form still looks like the child he was at the beginning.But my fave character in Fatal Fury was always Geese Howard. He is such a cool bad guy and live action bad guys should be more like him. Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi are amusing supporting characters and make great sidekicks for Terry.The ending is a little too quick but when you consider that there is a follow up and a great animated movie it ain't so bad. If you like this one then the others should give you a good fix.FATAL FURY 2Not a revolutionary animated movie by any means but this sequel to Fatal Fury has a reasonably good story and interesting characters. The color scheme is bright and easy on the eye and the animation style is better than most Japanese anime in which everyone looks like Asian/American to appeal to both audiences.I thought that Krauser was a cool bad guy and, for once, one that I doubted the hero (Terry Bogard) couldn't defeat so easily. His costume was a bit excessive and it is hard to believe that he could be so agile under such a suit but one can overlook such a flaw easily.Terry's brother Andy returns and so does Joe Higashi but it's the 2 new characters that are the best thing about this movie. Kim is a teenage boy who idolizes Terry and considers him to be a real role model. But he is gutted when he discovers that Terry is just a burnt out drunk and will do anything for him until he gets back on his feet. The other new character is Mai and she is a very ""bouncy"" character if you know what I mean.The fight scenes are very well thought out and vivid. Every punch and kick looks painful and the other heavies look pretty mean too. But we all know that in the end Terry is gonna beat the crap out of them. Just like the video game says...Terry Bogard is the King of Fighters.But at 68 minutes you feel a little cheated. But with such a short running time there is no room for fat.The DVD is in 1.33:1 with a nice picture transfer with brilliant colors and the Dolby Stereo soundtracks are adequate but not impressive. Many trailers are available and there are some cool motion menus.",5,If you're a Fatal Fury fan you'll love this!,1004054400,"10 26, 2001",2001,2509,"['FATAL', 'FURYThe', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'franchise', 'full', 'promises', 'first', 'animated', 'feature', 'characters', 'video', 'game', 'boundaries', 'cool', 'how', 'fighters', 'Terry', 'Bogard', 'especially', 'are', 'written', 'being', 'normal', 'sensitive', 'rather', 'always', 'butch', 'evil', 'trying', 'start', 'fight', 'characters', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'series', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'Terry', 'Bogard', 'always', 'innocent', 'adult', 'form', 'still', 'child', 'was', 'beginning.But', 'fave', 'character', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'was', 'always', 'Geese', 'Howard', 'such', 'cool', 'bad', 'guy', 'live', 'action', 'bad', 'guys', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'Andy', 'Bogard', 'Joe', 'Higashi', 'are', 'amusing', 'supporting', 'characters', 'make', 'great', 'sidekicks', 'Terry.The', 'ending', 'little', 'too', 'quick', 'when', 'consider', 'follow', 'up', 'great', 'animated', 'movie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'like', 'one', 'then', 'others', 'should', 'give', 'good', 'fix.FATAL', 'FURY', '2Not', 'revolutionary', 'animated', 'movie', 'means', 'sequel', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'reasonably', 'good', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'color', 'scheme', 'bright', 'easy', 'eye', 'animation', 'style', 'better', 'most', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'everyone', 'Asian/American', 'appeal', 'audiences.I', 'thought', 'Krauser', 'was', 'cool', 'bad', 'guy', 'once', 'one', 'doubted', 'hero', 'Terry', 'Bogard', 'could', ""n't"", 'defeat', 'so', 'easily', 'costume', 'was', 'bit', 'excessive', 'hard', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'agile', 'suit', 'one', 'can', 'overlook', 'such', 'flaw', 'easily.Terry', 'brother', 'Andy', 'returns', 'so', 'Joe', 'Higashi', '2', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'Kim', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'Terry', 'considers', 'be', 'real', 'role', 'model', 'gutted', 'when', 'Terry', 'just', 'burnt', 'drunk', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'back', 'feet', 'other', 'new', 'character', 'Mai', 'very', 'bouncy', 'character', 'know', 'what', 'mean.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'vivid', 'Every', 'punch', 'kick', 'painful', 'other', 'heavies', 'look', 'pretty', 'mean', 'too', 'know', 'end', 'Terry', 'gon', 'beat', 'crap', 'Just', 'video', 'game', 'Terry', 'Bogard', 'King', 'Fighters.But', '68', 'minutes', 'feel', 'little', 'cheated', 'such', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'room', 'fat.The', 'DVD', '1.33:1', 'nice', 'picture', 'transfer', 'brilliant', 'colors', 'Dolby', 'Stereo', 'soundtracks', 'are', 'adequate', 'not', 'impressive', 'Many', 'trailers', 'are', 'available', 'are', 'cool', 'motion', 'menus']",Fatal Fury OVA - Double Impact
562540,A69LRNNBOR352,B00005094M,Junette Oscar,"[2, 5]","The first Fatal Fury was very cheesy and the animation was off.  It did not hold true to the characters in terms of looks and character (except Terry, of course).Now, the second Fatal Fury was downright awesome.  Terry, Tony, Andy, and Joe all are developed so beautifully and in such a great plot.  I don't know who they got to do Krauser's character, but by gone, they did an excellent job.  I love it that he was not so easily beat; it demonstrated how powerful he really was ('cause he was such a cheater in the game!)If you can find the second one on DVD by itself, go ahead and get it; it is my personal opinion that the first one is not worth the money because of how poorly it its developed.",4,"First &gt;_&lt;, Second @_@",1087257600,"06 15, 2004",2004,699,"['first', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'was', 'very', 'cheesy', 'animation', 'was', 'off', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'true', 'characters', 'terms', 'looks', 'character', 'Terry', 'course', '.Now', 'second', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'was', 'downright', 'awesome', 'Terry', 'Tony', 'Andy', 'Joe', 'are', 'developed', 'so', 'beautifully', 'such', 'great', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'got', 'do', 'Krauser', 'character', 'gone', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'love', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'beat', 'demonstrated', 'how', 'powerful', 'really', 'was', 'was', 'such', 'cheater', 'game', 'can', 'find', 'second', 'one', 'DVD', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'personal', 'opinion', 'first', 'one', 'not', 'worth', 'money', 'how', 'poorly', 'developed']",Fatal Fury OVA - Double Impact

Of course there's the dual language option, and also a character sketch portfolio. One thing about the subtitles is that they're not very accurate.
