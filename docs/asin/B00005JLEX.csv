The key to the genius of this show, I've always thought, is that there are no serious episodes - nothing but comedy from start to finish. So many other sitcoms became unbearable or just crashed and burned because for some crazy reason they decided to develop some kind of serious theme that served as a distraction away from the comedy element. Seinfeld never even came close to doing this and will live on forever as one of the greatest sitcoms ever because of it.",5,More than a decade later it's still hilarious,1109116800,"02 23, 2005",2005,606,"['Seinfeld', 'was', 'such', 'masterpiece', 'sitcom', 'television', 'even', '10+', 'years', 'later', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'entertainment', 'key', 'genius', 'show', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'are', 'serious', 'episodes', 'nothing', 'comedy', 'start', 'finish', 'So', 'many', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'became', 'unbearable', 'just', 'crashed', 'burned', 'crazy', 'reason', 'decided', 'develop', 'kind', 'serious', 'theme', 'served', 'distraction', 'away', 'comedy', 'element', 'Seinfeld', 'never', 'even', 'came', 'close', 'doing', 'will', 'live', 'forever', 'one', 'greatest', 'sitcoms', 'ever']",Seinfeld - Seasons One & Two

598949,A3BHHSORGTDW8K,B00005JLEX,A customer,"[4, 4]","(Season One 2 stars, Season Two 4 stars).While over the course of the series it is hard to give Seinfeld anything but 5 stars, it is difficult to watch the first season without a grimace. Even though it's set in the same apartment and the characters all essentially look the same (well, not Jerry's dad or Kramer), it's almost like you're watching an entirely different TV show. Based on one season we are all fortunate that the series did not get cancelled before it went on to be one of the best series of all time.Things don't start to really come together until the second season, although many of these episodes can also still be somewhat clumsy.  A good example is the ""The Chinese Restaurant"", where you had many novel things taking place in terms of plot set-up and camera work.  There were lots of funny lines that eventually became part of the Seinfeld lexicon (""Cartwright, four!""), and many consider it to be the springboard for becoming ""the show about nothing"". The entire episode revolves chiefly around waiting for a table at a restaurant when you're really hungry. Who would have thought that could be funny? Well yes, in season two that turned out to be the case. In season one, not so much. There was a reason we hadn't seen this approach done too much in the United States before, but the rough edges start to get worked off.Many fans give these early episodes somewhat of a pass because they were innovative and ultimately hey, who now doesn't like Seinfeld?  But interestingly there is nothing new under the sun, and for those looking for proof that such comedies ""about nothing"" have been taking place for decades they should check out the 1950s era movieGood Morning (The Criterion Collection).No, its not Seinfeld per se, and everyone who likes Seinfeld may not care for it (it's rooted in Japanese humor and subtitled for one).  But the movie is essenially nothing more than a movie-length sitcom about nothing. Most of the film features meaningless dialogue taking place in a small Japanese 1950's era suburb and pub that would not seem too far out of place from a certain New York city apartment complex and diner. The cramped asian housing quarters force you to get to know everyone whether you want to or not (they all open doors without knocking like Kramer and just walk right in). Other neighbors also include unpleasant ""Newmans"" that like to gossip and cause trouble, counter-culture bohemians, nosy neighbors that borrow things, and frequently unemployed hanger-on ""Georges"" that are mostly friendly (but selfish enough to take advantage if they need to). The closest thing to a plot here is about two self centered yet somehow still endearing kids who get upset that their parents won't by them a TV set (As George would say, ""that's an episode""). We were about 15 minutes into this and my spouse said ""What is this, Japanese Seinfeld?"".Overall, the good episodes here easily outweigh the bad, and for many fans even a bad Seinfeld is better than most other shows. It is also fun to see some of show's ""firsts"", like Elaine pushing Jerry or watching Kramer's early hair style and knowing where it will go (or ""go out"" in the case of George, who had more hair at the beginning of all this then I remembered). Additional characters like Newman start to make it more of a true ensemble cast that really has only been matched in modern times by the Phil Hartman era seasons ofNewsRadio - The Complete First & Second Seasons.If you are like me, the last season of Seinfeld was also a disappointment (especially the final episode), and it was obvious that the series had run its full course. Still, inbetween the bookends of bad seasons 1 and the grande finale is some of the best sitcom TV of all time. Season 2 is still worthwhile, and would be closer to four stars if it were offered on its own.Considering the inexpensive price of this two season package now in 2012 it's easily worth picking up in my mind for everyone and not just the Seinfeld completist.  If you would rather dabble first, I would start out with season four.",3,Early Japanese Comedy (honest!),1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,4063,"['Season', 'One', '2', 'stars', 'Season', 'Two', '4', 'stars', '.While', 'course', 'series', 'hard', 'give', 'Seinfeld', 'anything', '5', 'stars', 'difficult', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'grimace', 'Even', 'set', 'same', 'apartment', 'characters', 'essentially', 'look', 'same', 'well', 'not', 'Jerry', 'dad', 'Kramer', 'almost', ""'re"", 'watching', 'entirely', 'different', 'TV', 'show', 'Based', 'one', 'season', 'are', 'fortunate', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'cancelled', 'went', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'time.Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'really', 'come', 'together', 'second', 'season', 'many', 'episodes', 'can', 'also', 'still', 'be', 'somewhat', 'clumsy', 'good', 'example', 'Chinese', 'Restaurant', 'where', 'had', 'many', 'novel', 'things', 'taking', 'place', 'terms', 'plot', 'set-up', 'camera', 'work', 'were', 'lots', 'funny', 'lines', 'eventually', 'became', 'part', 'Seinfeld', 'lexicon', 'Cartwright', 'four', 'many', 'consider', 'be', 'springboard', 'becoming', 'show', 'nothing', 'entire', 'episode', 'revolves', 'chiefly', 'waiting', 'table', 'restaurant', 'when', ""'re"", 'really', 'hungry', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'funny', 'Well', 'yes', 'season', 'two', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'season', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'reason', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'approach', 'done', 'too', 'much', 'United', 'States', 'rough', 'edges', 'start', 'get', 'worked', 'off.Many', 'fans', 'give', 'early', 'episodes', 'somewhat', 'pass', 'were', 'innovative', 'ultimately', 'hey', 'who', 'now', ""n't"", 'like', 'Seinfeld', 'interestingly', 'nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'looking', 'proof', 'such', 'comedies', 'nothing', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'place', 'decades', 'should', 'check', 'out', '1950s', 'era', 'movieGood', 'Morning', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '.No', 'not', 'Seinfeld', 'se', 'everyone', 'who', 'Seinfeld', 'may', 'not', 'care', 'rooted', 'Japanese', 'humor', 'subtitled', 'one', 'movie', 'essenially', 'nothing', 'more', 'movie-length', 'sitcom', 'nothing', 'Most', 'film', 'meaningless', 'dialogue', 'taking', 'place', 'small', 'Japanese', '1950', 'era', 'suburb', 'pub', 'would', 'not', 'seem', 'too', 'far', 'place', 'certain', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'apartment', 'complex', 'diner', 'cramped', 'asian', 'housing', 'quarters', 'force', 'get', 'know', 'everyone', 'want', 'not', 'open', 'doors', 'knocking', 'Kramer', 'just', 'walk', 'right', 'Other', 'neighbors', 'also', 'include', 'unpleasant', 'Newmans', 'gossip', 'cause', 'trouble', 'counter-culture', 'bohemians', 'nosy', 'neighbors', 'borrow', 'things', 'frequently', 'unemployed', 'hanger-on', 'Georges', 'are', 'mostly', 'friendly', 'selfish', 'enough', 'take', 'advantage', 'need', 'closest', 'thing', 'plot', 'here', 'two', 'self', 'centered', 'yet', 'somehow', 'still', 'endearing', 'kids', 'who', 'get', 'upset', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'TV', 'set', 'George', 'would', 'say', 'episode', 'were', 'about', '15', 'minutes', 'spouse', 'said', 'What', 'Japanese', 'Seinfeld', '.Overall', 'good', 'episodes', 'here', 'easily', 'outweigh', 'bad', 'many', 'fans', 'even', 'bad', 'Seinfeld', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'also', 'fun', 'see', 'show', 'firsts', 'Elaine', 'pushing', 'Jerry', 'watching', 'Kramer', 'early', 'hair', 'style', 'knowing', 'where', 'will', 'go', 'go', 'out', 'case', 'George', 'who', 'had', 'more', 'hair', 'beginning', 'then', 'remembered', 'Additional', 'characters', 'Newman', 'start', 'make', 'more', 'true', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'really', 'only', 'been', 'matched', 'modern', 'times', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'era', 'seasons', 'ofNewsRadio', 'Complete', 'First', 'Second', 'Seasons.If', 'are', 'last', 'season', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'also', 'disappointment', 'especially', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'obvious', 'series', 'had', 'run', 'full', 'course', 'Still', 'inbetween', 'bookends', 'bad', 'seasons', '1', 'grande', 'finale', 'best', 'sitcom', 'TV', 'time', 'Season', '2', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'would', 'be', 'closer', 'four', 'stars', 'were', 'offered', 'own.Considering', 'inexpensive', 'price', 'two', 'season', 'package', 'now', '2012', 'easily', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'mind', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'Seinfeld', 'completist', 'would', 'rather', 'dabble', 'first', 'would', 'start', 'out', 'season', 'four']",Seinfeld - Seasons One & Two

Heck, they put the cult Planet of the Apes series on DVD. The fact is that the rights to the series are complicated. Fox owns the network rights to the sitcom and TBS has recently bought the Cable rights. Even though the series has been off the air for half a decade the reruns still bring in better viewership than some of their networks' primetime programming. Also, running reruns requires little overhead, it is a cost-effective arrangement, more so than producing an original series. As a result, if the DVDs were released, it would stand to reason that less people would tune in to their respective networks for the reruns, lowering the price of advertising and ultimately lowering profits. I am sure that these networks will eventually see the (monetary) wisdom of giving the people what they want, but they are stonewalling for now, and until a deal can be struck, we will just have to wait for the DVDs and watch the reruns on the stations.",5,Here's why it isn't out...,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,1067,"['Seinfeld', ""n't"", 'already', 'out', 'there', ""n't"", 'demand', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'profitable', 'produce', 'Heck', 'put', 'cult', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'series', 'DVD', 'fact', 'rights', 'series', 'are', 'complicated', 'Fox', 'network', 'rights', 'sitcom', 'TBS', 'recently', 'bought', 'Cable', 'rights', 'Even', 'series', 'been', 'off', 'air', 'decade', 'reruns', 'still', 'bring', 'better', 'viewership', 'networks', 'primetime', 'programming', 'Also', 'running', 'reruns', 'little', 'overhead', 'cost-effective', 'arrangement', 'more', 'so', 'producing', 'original', 'series', 'result', 'DVDs', 'were', 'released', 'would', 'stand', 'reason', 'less', 'people', 'would', 'tune', 'respective', 'networks', 'reruns', 'lowering', 'price', 'advertising', 'ultimately', 'lowering', 'profits', 'am', 'sure', 'networks', 'will', 'eventually', 'see', 'monetary', 'wisdom', 'giving', 'people', 'what', 'want', 'are', 'stonewalling', 'now', 'deal', 'can', 'be', 'struck', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'DVDs', 'watch', 'reruns', 'stations']",Seinfeld - Seasons One & Two

Having seen most, if not all of the episodes on reruns I am pleased to see the upcoming DVD release, finally being made available. What I am looking forward to most of all however, is the original episode length - most reruns are trimmed to allow for the aforementioned commercials on non network stations, and even episodes you may have seen countless times, feel more complete. Comparing the original network shows with reruns is almost like a ""directors cut"" I noticed little nuances and subtle scenes that made what were previously often disjointed episodes, make more sense - often with hilarious portions trimmed. The ""show about nothing"" as it was billed was hugely succesful, and like others I concur with some criticisms levelled toward the more fantastical plots (especially after season 3). All that said, if you are a fan, this will be an essential purchase. The DVD set is billed as being loaded with extra's from commercials to featurettes, and the all round package represents pretty good value. I am looking forward to getting the set, but will say that as much as I like Seinfelds wry observaional comedy, I think watching the whole first seasons back to back would be a bit numbing.

598960,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B00005JLEX,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[1, 1]","I am a newcomer to Seinfeld. I knew the basic concept of the show but never watched episodes. Not only is the show impressive, so is this DVD set. Seinfeld really is ""the show about nothing"", if you're looking for sophisticated humor this isn't it. If that's your type of thing, you should definitely watch Frasier. Even though this DVD set includes season one and season two, there are only eighteen episodes. But the DVD makes up for that with very informative extras which I'll discuss later in my review. I love how the simplest problem could become bigger and bigger as the episode goes on. It's just so entertaining and the cast do an excellent job in my opinion. One of my favorite episodes was from season one entitled ""the Baby Shower."" But it's hard to describe my favorite part because there are three subplots for Jerry, Elaine and George. And that's another thing, many times the whole episode feels like a subplot but each subplot is combined together brilliantly which makes for fantastic viewing.The bonus features are some of the best I've seen for a show on DVD, there are just so many. But fortunately it doesn't get confusing finding the one you want. When you select what episode you want to watch on the episode menu, another menu pops up which also lets you select the bonus feature you want to watch that's made for that episode. But if you just want to watch all the extras at once, there is an extras menu which has them all listed there as well. Speaking of extras, here are what the usual extras are for this set. There are audio commentaries with the cast, writers, and creator Larry David, also included with each episode are production notes which will pop up every once in a while, there informative but they can get distracting after a while. There also is a five minute segment featured for most of the episodes called the ""Inside Look"", which just briefly discusses the episodes plot, and filming it, these are very interesting. The rest are bloopers, promos, some old, hard to find Jerry Seinfeld stand-up footage and an hour long documentary on how Seinfeld was created. In all, just a ton of fantastic interesting bonus features that I'm sure you'll enjoy.Each disc is placed in a separate slim case and the discs episode descriptions and extras are featured on the back. Down below I'll list season one and two's episode descriptions. Just saying, on the DVD the episodes are listed by production number, I'm listing them by their original airdate. ""The Stranded"" (Included on this set) was first aired in season three.The Seinfeld Chronicles (Pilot) - Airdate: 7/5/1989 - Jerry is excited that a woman he met on the road is coming to visit him in New York.

Through the years, they're joined by loveable cast of characters that includes Newman, Uncle Leo, the Soup Nazi, Frank and Estelle Costanza, the Bubble Boy, and countless others.The first and second season DVD offers the very first glimpse into the world Jerry, starting with The Pilot (episode 1) which was originally titled The Seinfeld Chronicles. The first scene involves Jerry commenting to George about a button on his shirt (the same conversation later takes place in the last scene of the series finale). These opening episodes provide insight into the development of the four main characters with conversations that range from George's initial admission that he'd like to be an architect (episode 2) to Kramer's propensity for get rich quick schemes like a make-your-own-pizza pizzeria (episode 4).

598966,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00005JLEX,calvinnme,"[3, 4]","If these 17 episodes were all that existed of this show, it probably would not be such worthwhile viewing. However, considering that it developed by its third season into perhaps the funniest sitcom ever made and stayed that way to its end, it is fascinating. Elaine isn't even a castmember in the pilot, and overall the characters are trying to find their moorings. However, Jason Alexander has the character of George down from the very beginning. His over-analysis of the phone calls or physical actions to figure out a woman's exact motives were really classic George. The next episode, ""The Stakeout"", is the first with Elaine. It's also the first time we hear the name of the imaginary character used as a mythical prop throughout the series - ""Art Vanderlay"". In this case, he is the made-up reason George and Jerry are staking out the building in which a girl works so that Jerry can ""accidentally"" run into her and get to know her better. You see, all he knows about the girl is the name of the law firm where she works.Season two gets much better, with such classics as ""The Chinese Restaurant"" in which Jerry, George, and Elaine all go out to eat at a Chinese restaurant before going to see ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", but are forced to wait an incredibly long time for a table. This simple concept with which we all have experience, waiting for a table, was turned into comic genius in this wonderfully crafted episode. Everything about this episode clicked from Elaine's desperation, to George's frenetic anticipation, to Jerry's levelheadedness. The only thing hard to relate to in the age of the cell phone is George trying to find a telephone.""The Deal"" in which Elaine and Jerry try to maintain their current friendship and restart the past sexual side of their relationship - which Jerry calls ""this and that"" - is funny and very spot on as to the relationship between men and women. However, the show must have decided to abandon the concept, because in all later episodes Jerry and Elaine act like this particular show never happened. ""The Phone Message"" is an underrated classic in my opinion, and epitomized the extreme awkwardness of George's situations that would be re-visited many times in Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm. In this episode, George has left progressively nasty messages on his girlfriend's answering machine. He enlists Jerry's help to switch the tape before his girlfriend returns home and hears the messages. Like many Seinfeld episodes, the grand plan of one of the characters (in this case, George) comes to an end in an unexpected manner, but this episode actually had things work out for George in the end, which is something that wouldn't be seen very often afterwards as the series progressed.The only bad thing about the first two seasons is that you don't see as much of Kramer as you do in subsequent seasons. Plus, there is a bit of rewriting that takes place involving Kramer's financial situation. In these first two seasons early on it is mentioned that Kramer makes more money than Jerry. In later seasons much is made of Kramer's spotty employment history, including the fact that he has been on strike from working in a bagel shop for several years over wages, and he returns to work after the strike is settled only because the minimum wage is finally raised to the wage his union was demanding.I recommend these first two seasons, mainly for the point of seeing all of the character development that takes place getting everything ready for the truly great season three.",5,Worthwhile to see Seinfeld's evolution from the beginning,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,3533,"['17', 'episodes', 'were', 'existed', 'show', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', 'However', 'considering', 'developed', 'third', 'season', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'sitcom', 'ever', 'made', 'stayed', 'way', 'end', 'fascinating', 'Elaine', ""n't"", 'even', 'castmember', 'pilot', 'characters', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'moorings', 'However', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'character', 'George', 'down', 'very', 'beginning', 'over-analysis', 'phone', 'physical', 'actions', 'figure', 'out', 'woman', 'exact', 'motives', 'were', 'really', 'classic', 'George', 'next', 'episode', 'Stakeout', 'first', 'Elaine', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'hear', 'name', 'imaginary', 'character', 'used', 'mythical', 'prop', 'series', 'Art', 'Vanderlay', 'case', 'made-up', 'reason', 'George', 'Jerry', 'are', 'staking', 'out', 'building', 'girl', 'so', 'Jerry', 'can', 'accidentally', 'run', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'see', 'girl', 'name', 'law', 'firm', 'where', 'works.Season', 'two', 'much', 'better', 'such', 'classics', 'Chinese', 'Restaurant', 'Jerry', 'George', 'Elaine', 'go', 'out', 'eat', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'going', 'see', 'Plan', '9', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', 'are', 'forced', 'wait', 'incredibly', 'long', 'time', 'table', 'simple', 'concept', 'have', 'experience', 'waiting', 'table', 'was', 'turned', 'comic', 'genius', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'episode', 'Everything', 'episode', 'clicked', 'Elaine', 'desperation', 'George', 'frenetic', 'anticipation', 'Jerry', 'levelheadedness', 'only', 'thing', 'hard', 'relate', 'age', 'cell', 'phone', 'George', 'trying', 'find', 'telephone', 'Deal', 'Elaine', 'Jerry', 'try', 'maintain', 'current', 'friendship', 'restart', 'past', 'sexual', 'side', 'relationship', 'Jerry', 'funny', 'very', 'spot', 'relationship', 'men', 'women', 'However', 'show', 'must', 'have', 'decided', 'abandon', 'concept', 'later', 'episodes', 'Jerry', 'Elaine', 'act', 'particular', 'show', 'never', 'happened', 'Phone', 'Message', 'underrated', 'classic', 'opinion', 'epitomized', 'extreme', 'awkwardness', 'George', 'situations', 'would', 'be', 're-visited', 'many', 'times', 'Larry', 'David', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'episode', 'George', 'left', 'progressively', 'nasty', 'messages', 'girlfriend', 'answering', 'machine', 'Jerry', 'help', 'switch', 'tape', 'girlfriend', 'home', 'messages', 'many', 'Seinfeld', 'episodes', 'grand', 'plan', 'one', 'characters', 'case', 'George', 'end', 'unexpected', 'manner', 'episode', 'actually', 'had', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'George', 'end', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'very', 'often', 'series', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'much', 'Kramer', 'do', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'bit', 'rewriting', 'place', 'involving', 'Kramer', 'financial', 'situation', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'early', 'mentioned', 'Kramer', 'more', 'money', 'Jerry', 'later', 'seasons', 'much', 'made', 'Kramer', 'spotty', 'employment', 'history', 'including', 'fact', 'been', 'strike', 'working', 'bagel', 'shop', 'several', 'years', 'wages', 'work', 'strike', 'settled', 'only', 'minimum', 'wage', 'finally', 'raised', 'wage', 'union', 'was', 'demanding.I', 'recommend', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'mainly', 'point', 'seeing', 'character', 'development', 'place', 'getting', 'everything', 'ready', 'truly', 'great', 'season', 'three']",Seinfeld - Seasons One & Two

For even though the show is often very funny, and groundbreaking, I just can't get past that I really don't like any of the characters. They are neurotic, selfabsorbed, and small-minded. The problems which occupy them are microscopic ones: It is a huge issue when somebody sees you (apparently) picking your nose. They ""handle"" all those problems mainly by lying and avoidance. They never seem to learn that it does not work.It is clear that this comes from Larry David, and his personality is even more clear in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", a show I just gave up on. It is openly acknowledged that a lot from both shows comes directly from his experiences and personality (George mostly). Rob Reiner in an interview calls Larry David ""curmudgeonly, misanthropic, and dyspeptic"".

It's interesting from a character development study over time for hardcore fans but somebody watching fresh for the first time may be surprised at why this series eventually became so popular.There's not much to the first season - only five episodes. The pilot (the actual series pilot - not the episode the Pilot from season 4) and episode 2 are simply just bad from an acting standpoint. George is the strength of the show and he is probably what saved it from cancellation. But Jerry, Kramer, and Elaine really stumble out of the gate. There's some apparent ad-libs between Jerry and Elaine that fall completely flat and never should have made the final cut. There's some funny scenes in Episodes 3 and 4 and the acting gets a little better. Episode 5 is the first all-around good episode of the series.Season 2 improves a lot. This is where we see the show starting to take shape. The Pony Remark contains perhaps the funniest single stand-alone scene in the history of the series when Jerry ruins the family get together with his dinner table remark and spends five minutes trying to rationalize his way out of it while his relatives stare at him in contempt. Most of the other season 2 episodes are good with some classics (The Jacket, The Statue, The Heart Attack) and a couple clunkers (The Chinese Restaurant -critics praise it as innovative but the comedy is mediocre - and the season finale The Deal).The extras are fanstastic and really provide a lot of insight and trivia for long-time Seinfeld fans.",4,Generally good but inconsistent,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,1591,"['early', 'episodes', 'must', 'be', 'painful', 'watch', 'stars', 'interesting', 'character', 'development', 'study', 'time', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'somebody', 'watching', 'fresh', 'first', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'why', 'series', 'eventually', 'became', 'so', 'popular.There', 'not', 'much', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'five', 'episodes', 'pilot', 'actual', 'series', 'pilot', 'not', 'episode', 'Pilot', 'season', '4', '2', 'are', 'simply', 'just', 'bad', 'acting', 'standpoint', 'George', 'strength', 'show', 'probably', 'what', 'saved', 'cancellation', 'Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'really', 'stumble', 'gate', 'apparent', 'ad-libs', 'Jerry', 'Elaine', 'fall', 'completely', 'flat', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Episodes', '3', '4', 'acting', 'little', 'better', 'Episode', '5', 'first', 'all-around', 'good', 'episode', 'series.Season', '2', 'lot', 'where', 'see', 'show', 'starting', 'take', 'shape', 'Pony', 'Remark', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'single', 'stand-alone', 'scene', 'history', 'series', 'when', 'Jerry', 'family', 'get', 'together', 'dinner', 'table', 'remark', 'five', 'minutes', 'trying', 'rationalize', 'way', 'relatives', 'stare', 'contempt', 'Most', 'other', 'season', '2', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'classics', 'Jacket', 'Statue', 'Heart', 'Attack', 'couple', 'clunkers', 'Chinese', 'Restaurant', '-critics', 'praise', 'innovative', 'comedy', 'mediocre', 'season', 'finale', 'Deal', '.The', 'extras', 'are', 'fanstastic', 'really', 'provide', 'lot', 'insight', 'trivia', 'long-time', 'Seinfeld', 'fans']",Seinfeld - Seasons One & Two

598986,A1MAG8BDOVJHTT,B00005JLEX,"G. Swift ""97jedi""","[24, 31]","Maybe it's just me, but I really hate DVD sets that have hidden features.  When I shell out money for something, just give it to me, don't make it like a video game that has characters to unlock.  The discs in this set have some features that can be viewed only by playing with the various menus to find the other options.  I get annoyed by this.Now that that is out of my system, I loved Seinfeld over its entire run, watching the premiere when it first aired and then watching the series till it ended.  The episodes are presented in the order they were filmed rather than the order they aired, which actually makes the continuity better for this set.The Notes About Nothing, an option that displays trivia about the cast, crew, and storyline as the episodes play, are OK, but at times they scroll by three lines at a time too fast to read without pausing the disc, and I read fast.  Had that been remedied before sending these out, I would be much happier with the feature.The best part of the set, to me, is the outtakes.  When this cast gets to laughing I just lose it, and you can tell from most of the episodes that there were lots of smiles and laughing that went on, from the expressions on the actors' faces and how they are often shot from behind in certain scenes.  I would have liked more outtakes, but for a fifteen year old show they might not have any more than these.  Still great viewing, though.The behind-the-scenes stuff is OK, if a bit dry and somewhat padded in length by clips from the shows themselves.  The audio commentaries that can be run are pretty disappointing.  There are none with all four cast members, which would have rocked, but some have three (all but Seinfeld), likely due to the money issues that delayed this set so long in the first place.All in all, I am happy with the purchase, even if the features are not so great, mainly because I love the show and can now watch whichever episodes I like whenever I want.",4,"Not a bad DVD set, but the special features are lacking",1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,1955,"['Maybe', 'just', 'really', 'hate', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'hidden', 'features', 'When', 'shell', 'out', 'money', 'something', 'just', 'give', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'video', 'game', 'characters', 'unlock', 'discs', 'set', 'have', 'features', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'only', 'playing', 'various', 'menus', 'find', 'other', 'options', 'get', 'annoyed', 'this.Now', 'system', 'loved', 'Seinfeld', 'entire', 'run', 'watching', 'premiere', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'then', 'watching', 'series', 'till', 'ended', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'order', 'were', 'filmed', 'rather', 'order', 'aired', 'actually', 'continuity', 'better', 'set.The', 'Notes', 'Nothing', 'option', 'trivia', 'cast', 'crew', 'storyline', 'episodes', 'play', 'are', 'OK', 'times', 'scroll', 'three', 'lines', 'time', 'too', 'fast', 'read', 'pausing', 'disc', 'read', 'fast', 'Had', 'been', 'remedied', 'sending', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'happier', 'feature.The', 'best', 'part', 'set', 'outtakes', 'When', 'cast', 'laughing', 'just', 'lose', 'can', 'tell', 'most', 'episodes', 'were', 'lots', 'smiles', 'laughing', 'went', 'expressions', 'actors', 'how', 'are', 'often', 'shot', 'certain', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'outtakes', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'show', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'more', 'Still', 'great', 'viewing', 'though.The', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'OK', 'bit', 'dry', 'somewhat', 'padded', 'length', 'clips', 'shows', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'can', 'be', 'run', 'are', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'are', 'none', 'four', 'cast', 'members', 'would', 'have', 'rocked', 'have', 'three', 'Seinfeld', 'likely', 'due', 'money', 'issues', 'delayed', 'set', 'so', 'long', 'first', 'place.All', 'am', 'happy', 'purchase', 'even', 'features', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'mainly', 'love', 'show', 'can', 'now', 'watch', 'whichever', 'like', 'whenever', 'want']",Seinfeld - Seasons One & Two

Notice the change in Jerry Seinfeld's accent and swiftness.Second Season,The Pony Remark (Jerry kills his aunt by a comment)The Busboy ( makes me smile with paranoid George)The Baby Shower (A definite classic with the Russain cables guys and cosmo Kramer)The Jacket (The best episode in both the dvds.

It seems like a 35 minute comedy with all the action)The Statue (Incredibly funny, interesting new characters)The Revenge (a classic Seinfeld...v.v.v.funny too)I think the second DVD contains a lot of episodes they never aired on the cable telivision.Owning these,I feel like a kid who just learnt what 5 bucks can do and later realises he has 200 bucks.The absolute star of Season 2 are Kramer and Jerry and their association which is quite funny.I own the third season too but haven't given it a watch.George remains my favourite character owing to his (negative)humanity in general.Just so you know the following episodes are on the respective DVDS-First Season - The Seinfeld Chronicles,The Stakeout,The Robbery,Male Unbonding,The Stock TipSecond Season - The Ex-girlfriend,The pony remark,The Busboy,The baby shower,The Jacket,The Chinese Restaurant,The Phone Message, The Apartment,The Stranded,The Statue,The Heart Attack,The Revenge,The DealPlease note- The Stranded is hilarious too.Enjoy Seinfeld.",5,The Two Best Dvds my money bought...,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,2297,"['love', 'Seinfeld', 'think', 'education', 'people', 'Often', 'relate', 'lives', 'cheesy', 'cosy', 'feel', 'good', 'show', 'where', 'everything', 'reason', 'most', 'things', 'end', 'good', 'Seinfeld', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'most', 'effective', 'influencive', 'stand', 'up', 'comedians', 'almost', 'crack', 'up', 'time', 'looking', 'dressing', 'sense', 'then', 'understand', '90', 'observational', 'skill', 'second', 'none', 'soft', 'corner', 'Elayne', 'Julia', 'Dryfus', 'who', 'trademark', 'Get', 'here', 'leave', 'laughing.This', 'show', 'made', 'couch', 'show', 'watch', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'Imagine', 'Seinfeld', 'adverts', 'umlimited', 're-runs', 'perusal.Some', 'favourite', 'episodes', 'two', 'dvds', 'are', '-First', 'Season', 'Stock', 'Tip', 'recall', 'Kramer', 'grin', 'Jerry', 'Loss', 'Male', 'Unbonding', 'So', 'stupid', 'simple', 'made', 'Please', 'note', '5', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'have', 'something', 'unique', 'Notice', 'change', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'accent', 'swiftness.Second', 'Season', 'Pony', 'Remark', 'Jerry', 'aunt', 'comment', 'Busboy', 'smile', 'paranoid', 'George', 'Baby', 'Shower', 'A', 'definite', 'classic', 'Russain', 'cables', 'guys', 'cosmo', 'Kramer', 'Jacket', 'best', 'episode', 'dvds', 'one', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'cried', '35', 'minute', 'comedy', 'action', 'Statue', 'Incredibly', 'funny', 'interesting', 'new', 'characters', 'Revenge', 'classic', 'Seinfeld', 'v.v.v.funny', 'too', 'think', 'second', 'DVD', 'lot', 'episodes', 'never', 'aired', 'cable', 'telivision.Owning', 'feel', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'learnt', 'what', '5', 'bucks', 'can', 'do', 'later', 'realises', '200', 'bucks.The', 'absolute', 'star', 'Season', '2', 'are', 'Kramer', 'Jerry', 'association', 'quite', 'funny.I', 'third', 'season', 'too', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'watch.George', 'favourite', 'character', 'owing', 'negative', 'humanity', 'general.Just', 'so', 'know', 'following', 'episodes', 'are', 'respective', 'DVDS-First', 'Season', 'Seinfeld', 'Chronicles', 'Stakeout', 'Robbery', 'Male', 'Unbonding', 'Stock', 'TipSecond', 'Season', 'Ex-girlfriend', 'pony', 'remark', 'Busboy', 'baby', 'shower', 'Jacket', 'Chinese', 'Restaurant', 'Phone', 'Message', 'Apartment', 'Stranded', 'Statue', 'Heart', 'Attack', 'Revenge', 'DealPlease', 'note-', 'Stranded', 'hilarious', 'too.Enjoy', 'Seinfeld']",Seinfeld - Seasons One & Two

598995,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B00005JLEX,J. Hill,"[0, 0]","There's much more to appreciate about the first two seasons of Seinfeld in retrospect.  The show didn't get much acclaim in its infancy, but later success allowed the staff to become much bolder with ideas and characters.  But looking back on the episodes now, it's impressive how early on Seinfeld himself had realized the personalities of George, Elaine, and Kramer, as well as the show's niche of being about ""nothing.""  For audiences seeing the first episodes back in 1989, it was funny, but a bit confusing.  The show's star was also the show's main character, who happened to be a comedian (both in real life and on the show), with snippets of his stand-up loosely connecting seemingly random events in his life.  His three best friends are his ex-girlfriend, a hyperactive neurotic, and a one-named shut-in (it took a few more episodes for Kramer to evolve than the other characters).  A lot of people just didn't get it yet.  So even though the writing did strengthen later (as a direct result of being able to take more liberties thanks to the show's building momentum) the early episodes have some hilarious moments and are great fun to look back on now knowing all of the characters much better.  Favorites include The Stake Out, The Robbery, The Pony Remark, The Busboy, The Baby Shower, The Jacket, The Chinese Restaurant, The Phone Message, The Apartment, The Stranded, The Statue, The Heart Attack, The Revenge, and The Deal.  So that's 14 of the 18 total Season One and Two episodes that I count as favorites, so needless to say, I think this is five stars, even though not quite as strong a five as the later seasons.  Additionally, the special features make all of the Seinfeld sets better than most shows.  Hours and hours of commentaries, documentaries, outtakes, commercials...just about everything a fan could think of that they'd want to see is here.

Other than that it's great.  You can watch each episode of the first two seasons of Seinfeld and also listen to and watch commentary about each episode.  You can turn on the Notes about Nothing feature before you watch an episode and notes about the show or the actors will come up throughout the episodes.  There is commentary from the producers and actors about most of the shows and also how they were hired.  You can also see Jerry's first time on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in the Special Features section along with a clip of Michael Richards on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

599001,A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,B00005JLEX,John Alapick,"[3, 5]","Seinfeld - Seasons 1 & 2 shows the cast and the writers getting their feet wet. Disc 1 covers the series' first five episodes which spanned from 1989-1990. The writing as well as the camaraderie between the cast doesn't leave a lasting impression as ""The Robbery"" is the best episode of an otherwise forgettable disc. Based on these episodes, you would think the series would have fallen off the face of the earth. However, by Season 2, which is featured on Discs 2 though 4, you slowly see the writing as well as the cast's rapport begin to gel. Episodes such as ""The Pony Remark"" and ""The Jacket"" from Disc 2, ""The Chinese Restaurant"" and ""The Statue"" from Disc 3, and ""The Deal"" and ""The Revenge"" from Disc 4, are all very good, with ""The Revenge"" being an early classic. By contrast to their glory days, the characters have yet to find themselves as much emphasis is placed on Jerry's on and off relationship with Elaine. George bounces from intelligent to neurotic throughout the season while Kramer is more of a bit player although he has very memorable scenes on the final disc. As with all of the Seinfeld volumes released on DVD, it's the special features such as deleted scenes, inside looks, bloopers, and exclusive stand-up material, which make them a real bargain. The short documentary on the show's creation on Disc 4 is also a must see. Finally, The Notes About Nothing are very informative as they give you behind the scenes looks, blurbs about nearly every actor who made an appearance on the show, and other little tidbits such as The Kramer Entrance Counter and the boyfriend/girlfriend counters. All told, while the episodes here pale in comparison to those featured on future volumes, Seinfeld - Seasons 1 & 2 show hints of the greatness they would achieve starting in Season 3.",4,Seinfeld's humble beginnings,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,1800,"['Seinfeld', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'cast', 'writers', 'getting', 'feet', 'wet', 'Disc', '1', 'series', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'spanned', '1989-1990', 'writing', 'as', 'well', 'camaraderie', 'cast', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Robbery', 'best', 'episode', 'otherwise', 'forgettable', 'disc', 'Based', 'episodes', 'would', 'think', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'off', 'face', 'earth', 'However', 'Season', '2', 'featured', 'Discs', '2', '4', 'slowly', 'see', 'writing', 'as', 'well', 'cast', 'rapport', 'begin', 'gel', 'Episodes', 'such', 'Pony', 'Remark', 'Jacket', 'Disc', '2', 'Chinese', 'Restaurant', 'Statue', 'Disc', '3', 'Deal', 'Revenge', 'Disc', '4', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Revenge', 'being', 'early', 'classic', 'contrast', 'glory', 'days', 'characters', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'as', 'much', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'Jerry', 'relationship', 'Elaine', 'George', 'bounces', 'intelligent', 'neurotic', 'season', 'Kramer', 'more', 'bit', 'player', 'very', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'final', 'disc', 'Seinfeld', 'volumes', 'released', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'looks', 'bloopers', 'exclusive', 'stand-up', 'material', 'make', 'real', 'bargain', 'short', 'documentary', 'show', 'creation', 'Disc', '4', 'also', 'must', 'see', 'Finally', 'Notes', 'Nothing', 'are', 'very', 'informative', 'give', 'scenes', 'blurbs', 'nearly', 'actor', 'who', 'made', 'appearance', 'show', 'other', 'little', 'tidbits', 'such', 'Kramer', 'Entrance', 'Counter', 'boyfriend/girlfriend', 'counters', 'told', 'episodes', 'here', 'pale', 'comparison', 'featured', 'future', 'volumes', 'Seinfeld', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'show', 'hints', 'greatness', 'would', 'achieve', 'starting', 'Season', '3']",Seinfeld - Seasons One & Two

""The Seinfeld gang"" is, to me, one of the quirkiest phrases imaginable.  Is the Seinfeld gang like the crips or the bloods?  Well, no.  In fact, the most enduring trait and root of great comedy comes from their relentless self-absorption and lack of empathy.Larry David lends himself to the show in incredible ways.Oddly enough, I stopped watching Seinfeld after the original ""chronicles"" morphed into the much more familiar sitcom rhythm.  I felt cheated.  It was almost as though the integrity of the first creative concept had been sacrificed to commercialism.Five years later, when the only thing people around the water cooler could talk about was last night's Seinfeld, I realized that I was right:  it had ""gone commercial"" but, in the process, become a part of our culture and had brought pleasure to many, many people.

The scenes that were cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality DVD versions. I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television. I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005. She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents. We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day. We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom. On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 1970's.The DVD sets include great special features from ""How It Began"" to ""Making a Seinfeld Episode"", deleted scenes, behind the scenes commentary from cast and creators, never-before-seen standup footage of Jerry, original NBC promotional ads and trailers, outtakes and bloopers, and much, much more. It's obvious that a lot of thought and work went into producing the DVD sets and I can't wait until the remaining seasons come out for sale at Amazon.

599012,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B00005JLEX,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[2, 3]","When the first three seasons of Seinfeld were released in November of 2004, it was quite possibly one of the most anticipated television on DVD releases ever. The four stars had all come to terms to be a part of the DVD production and fans were excited about seeing one of the funniest sitcoms of all time on DVD after a long wait.I for one, was not at all disappointed.I wasn't quite old enough to appreciate Seinfeld in the first few years but grew to love the show as I went off to college and beyond. The normal everyday life that these people lived showed just how funny things can be, even what seem to be mundane things.I found the first two seasons (five episodes in season one, 13 in season two) to be quite entertaining. The four characters were just beginning to find their chemistry, but you could tell it would be something that would come together relatively quickly.I found it interesting that the pilot episode was so much different than the rest of the show. To start with, there was no Elaine. The female character was a waitress named Claire, played by Lee Garlington, who has had small roles in many different shows including Everwood and Friends. In addition, Kramer wasn't Kramer, but was Kessler. And he had a dog, which was never seen again. In the 'Inside Look' section, it is mentioned why the dog appeared. The story is kind of interesting.Probably my favorite episode of the first two seasons was 'The Chinese Restaurant.' I don't think a show had ever done anything like that, with three characters just standing around waiting for a table. It was unique, but certainly something that almost everybody does and can relate to. The only bad part about the episode was that Kramer wasn't a part of it.While the episodes enough would have been plenty of incentive for me to purchase the DVD set, the extras on this set are fantastic. The bonus features include  'notes about nothing' which are production notes and behind the scenes notes, the aforementioned 'Inside Look' where viewers can take a look inside many of the episodes through the characters, creator, writers or others involved in the production. There are also commentaries from Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards, creator Larry David and even from one of the writers. These provide a lot of great information. There are also deleted scenes and a piece on the creation of the show.It is hard to believe that this show, which went on to be one of the top-rated shows on television, almost didn't survive the first year. Low ratings were to blame, but NBC held on and gave it another shot and reaped the benefits for years to come.

Seinfeld really hit its full stride after a few years went by, so this set is fun, entertaining, but not as consistently ""on"" as the episodes from later in the history of the show.

599014,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B00005JLEX,kaduzy,"[9, 9]","I was one of those naysayers who never ""got"" Seinfeld's popularity.  I'd seen bits and pieces of a few episodes here and there, and what I saw always left me marveling that so many people thought it was the be-all and end-all of television sitcoms.  (But I had learned to keep this opinion to myself when outside the bosom of family.  I nearly got mobbed in a cafeteria once by a bunch of ravenous Seinfeld fans for saying this out loud, so I keep mum for the most part.)Finally, I borrowed the first three season DVDs from a friend to give the show one last shot at showing me what it was all about.  I figured the least I could do was watch an episode or two in full before writing it off COMPLETELY.  But lo and behold . . . I  actually *enjoyed* the show.  It's HILARIOUS.  And futhermore, I finally understand why watching it in bits is useless if you've never seen the episode you're watching.  The key to Seinfeld's humor is that the jokes BUILD throughout each episode.  Something will be idly mentioned early on, such as the proper way to respond if someone sneezes, and it'll be ""hee hee"" funny . . . then it'll come up again two acts later, at precisely the perfect time, and be *absolutely hilarious*.  If you miss the beginning set-up, then you'll have no idea why everyone else is laughing.  Its humor also depends so heavily on character that watching it in bits will never convey to you how funny George is when he's forced to pay for something unless you know how cheap he is, or how funny seeing Kramer find yet another new way to enter the room is, unless you've seen a bunch of others before.  The writing is what keeps the show funny, but the characters and the acting performances are what make it truly shine.I never realized how different from other sitcoms Seinfeld was until I watched the extras.  There are tons of them here, and the ""Inside Look""s are the best.  Ranging from two to five minutes in length, these segments discuss the episode in question and offer tidbits on them.  An episode like ""The Chinese Restaurant"" seems ordinary by today's standards, but Seinfeld SET those standards -- and back then having an episode take place in real time on one set was so revolutionary that the network didn't want them to do it!My one complaint is a biggie, and it's the main reason I'm taking off a star.  The extras, myriad though they may be, are VERY repetitive and often pointless.  If you use the ""Notes about Nothing"" feature, you're treated to everything from behind-the-scenes info to the ""Kramer Entrance Counter"" (Which is cool -- there's also a counter for sightings of Kramer's stand-in.) to historical factoids about random things mentioned on the show.  Some of the notes are interesting, while others seem to have been written for the mentally challenged.  And if you use the notes AND listen to the commentary (try it simultaneously for a clearer example) you find that they sometimes give the same information at the same time.  The ""How It Began"" featurette is even more repetitive and actually uses a lot of the same footage they used in the individual Inside Looks, so I recommend watching that first in order to avoid boredom.Another reason I took a star off is because the show had yet to truly hit its stride.  Season 3 was a lot funnier and I'm sure that once I get around to watching seasons 4-9, it will only get better.  I'm looking forward to it!  This is a great show, and I can't believe I'm even saying that after so many years of turning my nose up.  Well my nose is down now, and I'm finally saying what everyone else has known for years -- this is one of the funniest shows that was ever on television.PS: Another great benefit of seeing this is that now I am deadly determined to get ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" on DVD.  Seeing Larry David on this show, hearing about him losing his temper and watching the episodes he wrote -- hell, just listening to him TALK -- have convinced me that ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" must be like Seinfeld on steroids, with no crazy network censorship and no filtering of David's words through someone else's mouth.  I don't expect to be disappointed by that one either, and I look forward to logging many hours of couch time enjoying both it and Seinfeld.It's a pleasure to be recruited, even this late in the game.",4,Now I get it.,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,4300,"['was', 'one', 'naysayers', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'Seinfeld', 'popularity', ""'d"", 'seen', 'bits', 'pieces', 'few', 'episodes', 'here', 'there', 'what', 'saw', 'always', 'left', 'marveling', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'be-all', 'end-all', 'television', 'sitcoms', 'had', 'learned', 'keep', 'opinion', 'myself', 'when', 'bosom', 'family', 'nearly', 'got', 'mobbed', 'cafeteria', 'once', 'bunch', 'ravenous', 'Seinfeld', 'fans', 'saying', 'out', 'loud', 'keep', 'mum', 'most', 'part', 'Finally', 'borrowed', 'first', 'three', 'season', 'DVDs', 'friend', 'give', 'show', 'one', 'last', 'shot', 'showing', 'what', 'was', 'figured', 'least', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'watch', 'episode', 'two', 'full', 'writing', 'off', 'COMPLETELY', 'lo', 'behold', 'actually', '*enjoyed*', 'show', 'HILARIOUS', 'futhermore', 'finally', 'understand', 'why', 'watching', 'bits', 'useless', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'episode', ""'re"", 'watching', 'key', 'Seinfeld', 'humor', 'jokes', 'BUILD', 'episode', 'Something', 'will', 'be', 'idly', 'mentioned', 'early', 'such', 'proper', 'way', 'respond', 'someone', 'sneezes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hee', 'hee', 'funny', 'then', ""'ll"", 'come', 'up', 'again', 'two', 'acts', 'later', 'precisely', 'perfect', 'time', 'be', '*absolutely', 'hilarious*', 'miss', 'beginning', 'set-up', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'everyone', 'else', 'laughing', 'humor', 'also', 'so', 'heavily', 'character', 'watching', 'bits', 'will', 'never', 'convey', 'how', 'funny', 'George', 'when', 'forced', 'pay', 'something', 'know', 'how', 'cheap', 'how', 'funny', 'seeing', 'Kramer', 'find', 'yet', 'new', 'way', 'enter', 'room', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bunch', 'others', 'writing', 'what', 'show', 'funny', 'characters', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'truly', 'shine.I', 'never', 'realized', 'how', 'different', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'watched', 'extras', 'are', 'tons', 'here', 'Inside', 'Look', 's', 'are', 'best', 'Ranging', 'two', 'five', 'minutes', 'length', 'segments', 'discuss', 'episode', 'question', 'offer', 'tidbits', 'episode', 'Chinese', 'Restaurant', 'ordinary', 'today', 'standards', 'Seinfeld', 'SET', 'standards', 'back', 'then', 'having', 'episode', 'take', 'place', 'real', 'time', 'one', 'set', 'was', 'so', 'revolutionary', 'network', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'My', 'one', 'complaint', 'biggie', 'main', 'reason', ""'m"", 'taking', 'off', 'star', 'extras', 'may', 'be', 'are', 'VERY', 'repetitive', 'often', 'pointless', 'use', 'Notes', 'Nothing', 'feature', ""'re"", 'treated', 'everything', 'behind-the-scenes', 'info', 'Kramer', 'Entrance', 'Counter', 'Which', 'cool', 'also', 'counter', 'sightings', 'Kramer', 'stand-in', 'historical', 'factoids', 'random', 'things', 'mentioned', 'show', 'notes', 'are', 'interesting', 'others', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'use', 'notes', 'listen', 'commentary', 'try', 'simultaneously', 'clearer', 'example', 'find', 'sometimes', 'give', 'same', 'information', 'same', 'time', 'How', 'Began', 'featurette', 'even', 'more', 'repetitive', 'actually', 'lot', 'same', 'footage', 'used', 'individual', 'Inside', 'Looks', 'so', 'recommend', 'watching', 'first', 'order', 'avoid', 'reason', 'took', 'star', 'off', 'show', 'had', 'yet', 'truly', 'hit', 'stride', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'lot', 'funnier', ""'m"", 'sure', 'once', 'get', 'watching', 'seasons', '4-9', 'will', 'only', 'get', 'better', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'great', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'even', 'saying', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'turning', 'nose', 'up', 'Well', 'nose', 'down', 'now', ""'m"", 'finally', 'saying', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'known', 'years', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'was', 'ever', 'television.PS', 'great', 'benefit', 'seeing', 'now', 'am', 'deadly', 'determined', 'get', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'DVD', 'Seeing', 'Larry', 'David', 'show', 'hearing', 'losing', 'temper', 'watching', 'episodes', 'wrote', 'hell', 'just', 'listening', 'TALK', 'have', 'convinced', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'must', 'be', 'Seinfeld', 'steroids', 'crazy', 'network', 'censorship', 'filtering', 'David', 'words', 'someone', 'else', 'mouth', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'disappointed', 'one', 'look', 'forward', 'logging', 'many', 'hours', 'couch', 'time', 'enjoying', 'Seinfeld.It', 'pleasure', 'be', 'recruited', 'even', 'late', 'game']",Seinfeld - Seasons One & Two

While ""Seinfeld"" may have been cutting edge when it aired, the first two seasons and particularly the first eight episodes look very 1980s and lack punch. Perhaps that is because shows like ""Friends"" and ""Sex and the City"" picked up where ""Seinfeld"" left off and pushed the envelope even further.

The Chinese Restaurant, The Revenge, The Stranded.  The episodes are little more subtle than later seasons.  The characters are still being developed especially Kramer.  You can sense there is some tension between Jerry and Kramer early on and they don't seem especially close.  You gradually begin to see Georges neurotic side especially in The Message and The Heart Attack.  You begin to see Elaines dark side during season 2.  Theres also some cool extras such as the ""Pop-Up Video"" style ""Notes About Nothing"" that you can turn off and on.  Kind of hard to follow the episodes when watching but if you're familiar with the episode and have the notes on it's pretty cool because you get a lot of background information on what went during the filming of the episode and little tidbits regarding some of the references the characters make in the show.

The first two seasons were very ""stagy"", very self-conscious, in the ""please love us"" syndrome. I think Michael Richards was the real ""glue"", shall we say. Jason Alexander is the new Woody Allen; Jerry's acting is generally atrocius. Writing..mediocre. Editing often bad, especially cutaways to gaga audience members in the thankfully thrown away prefacing bit - Jerry on staqe; to Elaine, the ex-girlfriend still dazzled by his wit.Male Unbonding, The Deal, The Pony Remark, The Heart Attack...all have 1-2 memorable lines but are very weak.For the deep fan, a ***; for the casual fan a **; a great compensator is the extras - definitely the most entertaining feature.I want to add that for those middle of the road fans, who just like to wait for the classics, and there are countless in that category starting in 1994 and going to the next to last season, this is completely unnecessary, unless the commentary, etc., is of value.

599041,A2Y870S7P44V4C,B00005JLEX,"R.S. ""highlandbob""","[13, 17]","Man, how does one go about reviewing one of the greatest t.v. shows ever?  In a few hundred words, no less!There has been a lot of talk about the 'genius' of ""Seinfeld"".  The show was built on one simple philosophy: real life is the best comedy.  I once heard a comedian expound by saying that the funniest man can sit around and make up hilarious jokes all day long, but nothing will hit a homerun like something that has happened in your everyday life that other ordinary people can relate to.  (This is why ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is so big, and it goes back to Lucy.)  Seinfeld took normal events and spun them into oddly-familiar but wacky plots.  Similarly, each [main] character was someone we could identify with -- although hopefully not completely.I think that's genius point A: to take reality (a.k.a., ""nothing"") and tweak it into something to laugh to until it hurt.Genius point B is thus:  every show featured a ""woven together"" theme.  Each character's individual storyline eventually somehow managed to end up interacting with the other respective pieces.  Two episodes step into mind straight off:  1) when George started doing the opposite of his instinct and went ""up"" while misfortune befell Elaine and she went ""down"" and Jerry ended up ""even"" in-between them; 2) when George lost his keys in the pothole and had to jackhammer them out, meanwhile Elaine pretended to be a janitor - and at one point they pass on the street and nod knowingly about their fake jobs.  This was beautifully illustrated in the final episode when it all came back around and their selfishness kicked them in the collective butt.Of course they were greedy, selfish and sometimes downright nasty... that's why they were funny.  They were everyday people carried to the extreme.  They were the personified exhibitions of many of the fears and thoughts that we bury in the real world.That leads into genius point C:  the characters were amazingly well-crafted, individually and as an ensemble.  To illustrate this, look beyond the obvious top 4.  How many shows can you name more than a couple supporting characters for?  ""Seinfeld"" has the parents, J. Peterman, Puddy, Jackie Chiles, Newman, the Soup Nazi, Joe Mayo and so on for a mile.  They played at varying levels of importance -- some recurring, some in 1 or 2 episodes -- but we remember each vividly.  That is amazing.""Seinfeld"" certainly was not the first great comedy and it will not be the last, but it will forever hold a firm place as one of the big ones.  Not everyone will agree on that, naturally, but the majority sure does and credit should be given to all involved for that gift.  And now that we have the DVDs we can watch them ad nauseum, which will in turn make us fan[atics] profoundly happy, which will mean ""Seinfeld"" is doing something quite unexpected... benefiting the world!",5,"Yeah, I agree Seinfeld sucks!

599046,A1DANN3R216NBI,B00005JLEX,"Snorre Smari Mathiesen ""Snorri Smari""","[1, 1]","Let me get straight to the point, for once. Not counting dvd's, I'm not much of a TV watcher. In fact, I don't think there's a single show on the tube I watch even occasionally. I guess the news is enough of a show to me. Do I sound like a bore? To some, I suppose. However, I am glad I'm not quite boring enough to not recognize the magic of SEINFIELD once it has stuck me in the face. I'd only watched a few episodes several years ago and found it mildly amusing when a friend of mine recently asked me to check it out a tad further. He loaned me the two first seasons. After a couple of episodes, I got addicted; and unlike if it was another show in question, I didn't feel bad about it. On the contrary.I used the word ""magic"" to describe the, uh, magic of SEINFIELD, as snappy as I could do. But what is actually the magic of it all? Well, to be honest there is no magic at all. Just a few guys and one gal hanging around and throwing punch-lines at one another. That's the surface of it. If you climb down just a step underneath, however, you'll probably learn quite a few things about yourself. And if you don't, at least you'll recognize your friend. And how you relate to him.What makes SEINFIELD great to me is that the crisp writing and frank insight into human relations and reactions is excecuted through characters which, while simply constructed, each attribute something unique into the comedy. We may not identify ourselves with the all-around loser George (thank you), but I'd be a liar if I said I've never experienced some of the humiliations he has to suffer. Eccentric Kramer adds the well-adjusted slapstick element between the dialogue, while Elaine provides the feminine touch although she always remains ""one of the guys."" Jerry Seinfield himself is more of an observer; after all, he is a comedian, and a damn good one at that.These two first seasons of the show are, of course, somewhat experimental as it had not yet quite established itself. Still, many of the episodes are as hilarious as the later ones. How can anybody sit through THE PHONE MESSAGE, THE RESTURANT or THE REVENGE and not laugh? I don't know. But I know I did laugh.

599053,A1TJJ7W8SF75D,B00005JLEX,Timothy T. Ward,"[1, 1]","Watching Seinfeld through the countless network and cable channels offered these days is redundant to say the least. But watching this now classic sitcom come to life again in it's original and uncut format via DVD maintains the show's quality. This package offers the earliest days of Seinfeld and it feels too unreal that this show started some 17 years ago, but even then one can recognize Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David putting forth a creative front in comedy television. The two were creating a sitcom that was both funny and ground-breaking with the simple formula to tell tales of everday living. Sure, The Chinese Restaurant episode turned into a classic and I wouldn't snub that episode by any means, but even better(as you watch them again)are The Stock Tip, The Phony Remark, The Busboy, The Baby Shower, and The Statue, just to name a few.

Well, it seems someone at Amazon likes it, like millions of people on this planet (and who knows where elese :)X-Files, Star Trek, Friends, Fawlty Towers, 24, Malcolm and even Space 1999 tv series are now available on DVD. Why not the Seinfeld 180 episodes?The only reason I can think of is corporate greed. The show is still shown on tv, in the US it is broadcast at least once a day (in my area - even three times now - Fall 2002. Nielsen ratings are not publicy available for non-prime time tv so we do not know how many people are watching, but certainly quite a lot. thus attracting advertisers. What is bad in this, some shows are repeated very often (e.g. Contest or Car Dealership) while others are never or very rarely repeated (e.g. Mom and Pop Store, Puerto Rican Day). Fortunately dvd burners are so cheap now that some individuals offer home made episode collections, but not on ebay, which restricts it and chases for copyright violation. What can we do?

This show was the lone wolf of television sitcoms. Nothing was like it then, and nothing is like it now. I called it the ""lone wolf"" sitcom, because it was out there. Uncoventional? Yes, most definitely. ""Seinfeld"" broke all the barriers for all the other television sitcoms that followed. I mean come on. Name one show from 1989 and back that got away with what Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David wrote.Anyway, this DVD collection contains all original episodes from seasons 1 and 2. Uncut, remastered, and oh, so awesome. The special features on these discs are fantastic. All jammed pack with an hour or so long documentary, which for those who didn't watch Thanksgiving night was the special that aired that night except this is the unedited version of the documentary. Each discs also contains an ""Inside Look"" into the story of certain episodes and has interviews with all the casts members and writers with whom share their experience of that particular episode with us.Well....there is alot here to talk about, but I'm just going to say that if you do not own this DVD set, then I urge you to pick it up.

599056,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JLEX,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[8, 8]","Back in the summer of 1990 a little show aired during the summer entitled THE SEINFELD CHRONICLES. For a summer filler show, it did alright in the ratings and was eventually picked up for a full half season. Eventually the name was shorten to simply SEINFELD and thus began one of the funniest and most inventive comedies of the last quarter of the twentieth-century. The elite and the ignorant alike refer to SEINFELD as being the first television show about nothing. Well, SEINFELD really is about something--it's about everyday life. In some ways, because of how personal Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld made the series, it is in some ways one of the most realistic comedies about life every produced.  The show was and always will be pure genius.Volume 1 off the SEINFELD series offers the 1st and 2nd season of the show.  Including the pilot episode, the 1st season only included 5 episodes. However, even in a few of these early episodes, the genius of the show can be seen. In ""The Stake Out"" George makes the first reference to his dream of being an architect and in ""The Robbery"" Kramer makes his first big impression when he leaves Jerry's apartment door open while Jerry is on a trip and is robbed.The 2nd season includes 13 episodes--a full half-season. In ""The Chinese Restaurant"" Jerry, George, and Elaine spend thirty minutes waiting for a table at a Chinese Restaurant (this is the show the coined the series as being a show ""about nothing""). In ""The Phone Message"" George begins to truly blossom as he leaves a series of nasty phone messages on his new girlfriend's machine because she hasn't returned his calls, only to discover that she has been out of town. In ""The Statue"" Kramer truly comes into his own as he steals back a statue that a cleaning guy stole from his apartment.  In ""The Revenge"" George is fired for the first time and decides to take revenge on his former employer, while Jerry & Kramer plan to get revenge on the laundry guy for stealing some money.  The volume is closed out by ""The Deal""--an episode that was originally intended to be the final show in the series.The DVDs include a plethora of extras. Each disc includes 1 or 2 audio commentaries. These are entitled Yada, Yada, Yada. Unfortunately, I found most of these commentaries rather boring. They don't provide any real new information or insight about the series and really serve as filler and not much more.Each episode can be played with a feature called Notes About Nothing. This is kind of like a pop-up video feature that pops up various information about the episode throughout he viewing. There's a ton of info there, but at times it's hard to keep up and is almost too much.About half of all the episodes feature Inside Looks. These are a series of interviews with the cast & crew about a particular episode. I enjoyed these the most of all the extras because they are short and informative.Other extras include a special introductions to ""The Stake Out"" and ""The Stranded"", deleted scenes, special Stand-Up material, bloopers, photo galleries, NBC promos & trailers, a few selected spots from ""The Tonight Show"", and a documentary entitled ""How It Began.""  Outside of the Inside Looks, I found the documentary and ""The Tonight Show"" segments to be the best extra features in this set.Volume 1 of SEINFELD might not be the best episodes of the series, but it is where & how the show began.

599057,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JLEX,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[62, 73]","Get Out! ""Seinfeld"" on DVD? He's already the Master of His Domain why would it need to be released it on DVD? Because the fans demanded it and justice can only be served if one of the most popular and best sitcoms can be viewed, uncut and with lots and lots of background material on this groundbreaking show. Just a warning this review is for the gift set which includes the salt shakers, playing cards and a copy of one of Larry David's scripts. That's the main difference between this gift set (that and the fact that it includes the two boxed sets including the first three ""seasons""). The first season consisted of five episodes (including the pilot)while the second consisted of 13 episodes as the network decided to commit to the show when the show received solid ratings. The third season consists of 22 episodes. All the episodes are the uncut original episodes that aired on NBC (most of the episodes in syndication are usually trimmed by a minute or two). The boxed set has a slipover case. Inside the inside slipcase each disc is nicely housed in individual slim DVD holders. 15 commentary tracks (if I'm counting correctly)for both sets. Deleted scenes, unused stand up bits, promos, featurettes make this a generous set particulary when compared to the bare bones releases for other similar (although not as funny) series.When ""The Seinfeld Chronicles"" (the original title) first aired as a limited series no one suspected it would be the next big thing. Seinfeld and his collaborator/co-creator/co-producer and frequent co-writer Larry David pushed TV comedy to its boundaries and then demolished them. They'd then establish new boundaries and demolish those. That's groundbreaking, important television. It's also what made ""Seinfeld"" unique. Sure, ""Who's The Boss?"" could be funny but it had to be about something where someone learned something in every episode. Seinfeld's and David's mantra ""learn nothing and be about nothing"" proved that TV touching on the absurdity of real life could be funnier than TV where the characters learned valuable lessons and became better people. In truth, that rarely happens in the real world and the fact that Seinfeld made fun of and played with that convention made it important. It helped that it was damn funny as well.An exceptionally sharp looking high definition transfer makes this one of the best looking transfer I've seen in awhile. The pilot episode doesn't look quite as sharp. It's clear that it's drawn from a second generation videotaped master. The colors bleed a bit but and the image isn't quite as sharp as the rest of the series.The hour long documentary has interesting, revealing tidbits including a shocker from Julia Louis- Dreyfus-she never saw the original pilot episode. In fact, she didn't see it until she prepped for the commentary tracks and interview for this boxed set. Larry David's acerbic dry fatalistic sense of humor (which informs his terrific show ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" on HBO) along with the witty, informed but ultimately wacky observations of the rest of the cast and crew make this a marvelous documentary. Unlike the featurettes or documentaries on a lot of TV shows (any of the ""Sex and the City"" ones for example), to invert a famous quip by a famous writer, ""there's there there"". Substance for a show about nothing what an ironic twist but in reality ""Senfield"" was about something. It was about the absurd little moments that populate our lives but a little more twisted.We also get a trivia filled ""Notes About Nothing"" that can be viewed while watching the various episodes. Sometimes it's about...well nothing but most of the time there's fascinating bits of trivia in this text commentary. ""In the Vault"" includes deleted scenes from season 1 & 2. Finally, we get commentaries from Jerry, Larry David, writer Larry Charles and Jason, Julia & Michael on 6 classic episodes. There's also two versions of the pilot with interesting differences included (not the least of which is the weak opening music which doesn't compare to the final theme).So...yada, yada yada buy this today....yada, yada, yada.",5,Something about nothing,1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,4109,"['Get', 'Out', 'Seinfeld', 'DVD', 'already', 'Master', 'Domain', 'why', 'would', 'need', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'fans', 'demanded', 'justice', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'served', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'best', 'sitcoms', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'uncut', 'lots', 'lots', 'background', 'material', 'groundbreaking', 'show', 'Just', 'warning', 'review', 'gift', 'set', 'salt', 'shakers', 'playing', 'cards', 'copy', 'one', 'Larry', 'David', 'scripts', 'main', 'difference', 'gift', 'set', 'fact', 'two', 'boxed', 'sets', 'including', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'consisted', 'five', 'episodes', 'including', 'pilot', 'second', 'consisted', '13', 'episodes', 'network', 'decided', 'commit', 'show', 'when', 'show', 'received', 'solid', 'ratings', 'third', 'season', '22', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'are', 'uncut', 'original', 'episodes', 'aired', 'NBC', 'most', 'episodes', 'syndication', 'are', 'usually', 'trimmed', 'minute', 'two', 'boxed', 'set', 'slipover', 'case', 'inside', 'slipcase', 'disc', 'nicely', 'housed', 'individual', 'slim', 'DVD', 'holders', '15', 'commentary', 'tracks', ""'m"", 'counting', 'correctly', 'sets', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'unused', 'stand', 'up', 'bits', 'promos', 'featurettes', 'make', 'generous', 'set', 'particulary', 'when', 'compared', 'bare', 'releases', 'other', 'similar', 'not', 'funny', 'series.When', 'Seinfeld', 'Chronicles', 'original', 'title', 'first', 'aired', 'limited', 'series', 'one', 'suspected', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'Seinfeld', 'collaborator/co-creator/co-producer', 'frequent', 'co-writer', 'Larry', 'David', 'pushed', 'TV', 'comedy', 'boundaries', 'then', 'demolished', ""'d"", 'then', 'establish', 'new', 'boundaries', 'demolish', 'groundbreaking', 'important', 'television', 'also', 'what', 'made', 'Seinfeld', 'unique', 'Sure', 'Who', 'Boss', 'could', 'be', 'funny', 'had', 'be', 'something', 'where', 'someone', 'learned', 'something', 'episode', 'Seinfeld', 'David', 'mantra', 'learn', 'nothing', 'be', 'nothing', 'proved', 'TV', 'touching', 'absurdity', 'real', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'funnier', 'TV', 'where', 'characters', 'learned', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'became', 'better', 'people', 'truth', 'rarely', 'real', 'world', 'fact', 'Seinfeld', 'made', 'fun', 'played', 'convention', 'made', 'important', 'helped', 'was', 'damn', 'funny', 'well.An', 'exceptionally', 'sharp', 'looking', 'high', 'definition', 'transfer', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'transfer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'pilot', 'episode', ""n't"", 'look', 'quite', 'sharp', 'clear', 'drawn', 'second', 'generation', 'videotaped', 'master', 'colors', 'bleed', 'bit', 'image', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'sharp', 'rest', 'series.The', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'revealing', 'tidbits', 'including', 'shocker', 'Julia', 'Louis-', 'Dreyfus-she', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'pilot', 'episode', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'prepped', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'interview', 'boxed', 'set', 'Larry', 'David', 'acerbic', 'dry', 'fatalistic', 'sense', 'humor', 'terrific', 'show', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'HBO', 'witty', 'informed', 'ultimately', 'wacky', 'observations', 'rest', 'cast', 'crew', 'make', 'marvelous', 'documentary', 'featurettes', 'documentaries', 'lot', 'TV', 'shows', 'Sex', 'City', 'ones', 'example', 'invert', 'famous', 'quip', 'famous', 'writer', 'there', 'Substance', 'show', 'nothing', 'what', 'ironic', 'twist', 'reality', 'Senfield', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'absurd', 'little', 'moments', 'populate', 'lives', 'little', 'more', 'twisted.We', 'also', 'get', 'trivia', 'filled', 'Notes', 'Nothing', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'watching', 'various', 'episodes', 'well', 'nothing', 'most', 'time', 'fascinating', 'bits', 'trivia', 'text', 'commentary', 'Vault', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'season', '1', '2', 'Finally', 'get', 'commentaries', 'Jerry', 'Larry', 'David', 'writer', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'Jason', 'Julia', 'Michael', '6', 'classic', 'episodes', 'also', 'two', 'versions', 'pilot', 'interesting', 'differences', 'included', 'not', 'least', 'weak', 'opening', 'music', ""n't"", 'compare', 'final', 'theme', '.So', 'yada', 'yada', 'yada', 'buy', 'today', '.yada', 'yada', 'yada']",Seinfeld - Seasons One & Two

In this collection, we get the entire first and second season, alongside hours of extra features. Although I personally felt that they defined themselves by the third season, the first two contain some great episodes, as well.""Male Unbonding"" takes the hilarious true-to-life concept of having a ""friend"" that's obsessed with Jerry, yet Jerry doesn't want to be with him, so he makes up excuses that become more and more ridiculous. It also holds the honor of being the only episode that doesn't begin with ""The"".""The Statue"" contains the first scene that really defines Kramer's character, where he goes undercover as a cop in order to get Jerry's statue back. (""Keep makin' love to that wall, pervert!"")""The Heart Attack"" features George at his funniest, as they go to a holistic healer who, judging by his persona and house, is somebody only Kramer could know! The episode includes a hysterically funny ambulence scene towards the end, definitely one to watch.""The Chinese Restaurant"" is a classic example of making an entire show out of practically nothing; in this case, waiting around for a seat at a Chinese restaurant. This is a first-rate example of how Seinfeld was always good at taking a minimalistic idea and stretching it into something interesting.""The Busboy"" is an interesting episode because it ends with the two stories meeting up at the end, something that would be done in plenty of future episodes. It was also quite funny to see Kramer as clumsy as he was in the busboy's apartment, that's our Kramer!For those who don't own this but want a dosage of Seinfeld, this comes very highly recommended, equally so for those wanting to get into the Seinfeld series. With over 20 episodes, over 13 hours of extra features, including deleted scenes and inside looks on the episodes (something I really love) and a few hidden ""Easter Egg"" special features, this collection is sure to satisfy!
