Neve Campbell shows a broad talent, and is much more than just a bimbo to look at, embracing the character with a believable maturity not seen in her earlier films. This is a sort of arthouse rendering of Indecent Proposal meets last Tango in Paris that asks more questions of it's own script than it answers. The acting is pretty good all round, and although the sex scenes are far from the steamy impression given on the DVD sleeve, they aren't gratutitous or seedy. All that said, boy oh boy is this dull, and you know it's a bad sign when a movie with a running time of only 81 minutes, catches you clock watching. There is a real attempt to portray intimate drama, power plays and the use of sex as a means to an end, as Ms Campbell bounces between boyfriend and millionaire, but you always feel like you were dropped in the middle of a dissertation, and are missing the back story, or relevance to what's on screen. Not an easy flick to catagorize, but certainly not a movie for those seeking tittillation, and those reviewers who have condemned it for lacking in adult material should seek diversion elsewhere. I hate to see a good idea dragged around in such a protracted fashion, and tried to enjoy this movie.

The movie belongs to her. If the plot of the film -presented when the film settles down from its really long first act to show us the story - were as complicated as Campbell's character Vera is, then this would be a great film.As it is, it's a good movie with a great performance in it, which makes it worth watching.The film features a con in it, I suppose, but it is not your typical, twisted con movie. But WHEN WILL I BE LOVED is more interested in conversation and character, thankfully. Vera is a great character, and others in the film just revolve around her. She overshadows everyone else, so I didn't end up as invested in the plot.Additionally, the opening act of the film, which follows four or five separate points of view and features cameos from Mike Tyson and Lori Singer, doesn't prepare you at all for the mood the rest of the film is going to take on.When it does get to the plot, it becomes a great, interesting movie about three characters.

What I enjoyed about the film was the character that Neve Campbell played. To the very end you never really figure her out and I found that exciting. Is she young and loves life and experimenting with her sexuality or is she a sociopath who uses people to satisfy the fact that basically most of life bores her? I couldn't decide whether Fred Weller was just a bad actor or whether his role was never fully developed. At some times he seems like a bad pimp or hustler and then out of nowhere he would start talking like someone who is well educated but misplaced in life. I thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue of the film but found the musical score overwhelming in many scenes, so much so that I could not hear the actors speaking. I am not a fan of director James Toback and he came across as a director who wanted to give himself a cool role as a scholar of Black Studies just because he could and not because it added anything to the film. I liked seeing the cameo appearances in the film yet, in the end, they seemed pointless. I would recommend this film with a warning that you may be disappointed if you have too high expectations.

The blacks are crushed; there is practically no image detail in the darker portions of a scene. The travesty is that the accompanying trailer has been beautifully transferred, looking brighter, with accurate colors and lovely skin tones and it emphasizes just how deplorable the main feature looks.

However, it is STILL Neve Campbell we're talking about here.Also, while Campbell is beautiful, she does not exactly possess a swimsuit model's body.  Seeing her nude was therefore not quite as exciting as I thought it would be.  But, nevertheless, it IS Neve Campbell.  It's especially nice to see her as I recall her saying after making WILD THINGS that she would never do a nude scene that showed anything.

There seems to be a message in there somewhere, but I'm not sure what it is.

When it works, it works very well: when it strays away from the central story line it steps into the vapid role.Vera (Neve Campbell in her finest role to date) is a sensually beautiful young rich girl whose life is lived in an expensive loft in New York where she dabbles in painting and in classical music recordings.  Her current boyfriend is a smarmy young hustler Ford (Frederick Weller in a completely believable portrayal) who is always finding ways to make easy money and in doing so encounters Count Lupo (Dominic Chianese), the 'wealthiest man in Italy' who has seen Vera and desires her. Ford arranges a consignation, talks Vera into having sex with  him for money, Vera consents, the young Vera and the older Count have their encounter in Vera's loft and she is paid 1 million dollars.  Her distaste for Ford's ruthless manipulation results in the surprising climax of the story and we see Vera returning to her life of searching for love.All this plays well.  The incidentals include the director casting himself as a teacher of African studies with whom Vera is interviewing for a job while she flirts with every handsome lad on the street as they walk.  The two encounter Lori Singer, Damon Dash, and Mike Tyson in vignettes that are totally superfluous and amateurishly forgettable.  The other problem with this otherwise moody film is the superimposition of Rap music (played loudly whenever Ford is hustling) and the works of Beethoven, Bach and Brahms played equally loudly during Vera's times alone and with partners (one of whom includes a lesbian whose prolonged foray with Vera is shielded by gauze drapery).Given all of these sidebars of distraction, WHEN WILL I BE LOVED  remains a valid view of the sensual sexual but empty encounters that pass as love substitutes in our shallow society today.

BdJS is characterized by: pretentiousness; lack of a plot; sneering at middle-class values; aimlessness; stilted dialogue; nihilism; poor writing; false titillation.  An epiphenomenon of BdJS is classification of the movie by critics as ""minimalist,"" which is a fancy way of saying empty, moralistic and with low production values.The first major American movie to suffer from BdJS was 1977's ""Looking For Mr. Goodbar.""  By 1977 there wasn't much shock and outrage left in pop culture to be mined out by the ""forbidden"" thrills of examining a generally sleazy lifestyle, but at least Diane Keaton gave it her best shot.  By 1993's BdJS-infused ""Indecent Proposal,"" no shock or outrage remained at all.  By 2004, when this movie was made, the idea of sleazy ""forbidden"" liaisons was -- and is -- pass&eacute; to the point of obnoxiousness.Why is it that no one ever seems to think past the title ""erotic thriller""?

At one point Ms Campbell states to her Italian suitor: ""I'm not impressed, either.  I'm intrigued.""  I'll do you one better.  I was neither.The false titillation.  When I saw ""In the Cut,"" another BdJS movie, I was both enervated and repulsed by just about everything except Ms Ryan, because at least that movie actually showed Ms Ryan's body.  Not the case with ""When Will I Be Loved?""  The vaunted shower scenes actually reveal quite little, and what they do reveal is over in a flash.  The same-sex love scene was performed behind a gauzy curtain, and was remarkably chaste, much to the chagrin of my prurient and adolescent mind.  I couldn't even tell if it was really Ms Campbell or a body double.After watching movies like these I always recite to myself a line from Full Metal Jacket.  ""I think you've been cheated!""

Munson,"[0, 2]","Neve Campbell (Vera), Fred Weller (Ford), and Dominic Chianese (Count Tommaso Lupo) star in this steamy and erotic thriller about con men (and women), sex, and money.Campbell stars as Vera, a young woman who isn't entirely sure what she wants to do with her life.  One thing is for sure,however; it must include money.  Vera comes from a well-to-do family who have set her up in a high-rise studio apartment, while she dreams of being a professor's assistant at a local university.  Kind of silly, right?Meanwhile, Ford, a somewhat amateuristic com-man, is hustling business on the street, trying to convince potential clients that he has a stable of women who can do anything from act to sing to rap.  So far, his business has been pretty slow.Later on, it is revealed that Ford and Vera are actually a couple, but it is Vera who ""wears the pants"".  Meanwhile, Ford has targeted Count Tommaso Lupo as his next con victim.  Ford knows that Lupo has seen Vera a couple of times, and he also knows that Lupo is infatuated with her, so he makes Lupo an offer;sex with his girlfriend for $100,000.  Sounds like ""Indecent Proposal"" to me.Intrigued, Lupo accepts the offer, and heads over to Vera's apartment.  The two engage in a very long and lively discussion which ends up in Vera swindling not $100,000, but $1 million from  Lupo.  The bad part for Lupo is Vera tells Ford that she never received any money from Lupo, even though she put it in a safe deposit box.  Frustrated, Ford goes looking for Lupo.  The two arrive back at Vera's, where Lupo swears he gave Vera the million, while she denies everything.  A struggle breaks out between Lupo and Ford, Ford punches Lupo, who falls over, dead.Vera calls 911, but she tells the operator she wants to report a homicide, which really freaks out Ford, who is arrested for  murder.  Finally, Vera watches as Ford is hauled away.I thought this movie was a little slow at the start, but it picked up as it went along.  Neve Campbell, who's come a long way since her ""Party of Five"" days,  does a pretty good job as Vera, and her shower scenes are a high point.  There's even a Mike Tyson cameo, and, true to his real-life form, he's hollering and swearing at a woman.  I think people would enjoy this movie.  The story is pretty good, and the plot has some good twists involved.

868200,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0006HC00U,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[6, 7]","This was one weird and rather pretentious movie, but it held my interest. It did feel like writer/director Toback forgot to write a third act. Neve Campbell plays a manipulative sexpot whose boyfriend (Fred Weller) prostitutes her to some rich older Italian guy (Dominic Chianese). The situation is pretty much ripped off from ""Indecent Proposal."" Toback's film is interesting outside of the plot, especially in the introductory sequence, which cuts back and forth between Campbell and Weller without telling us how they're connected. Through out this film we have some odd cameos thrown in by real people not really playing themselves, including Mike Tyson, Lori Singer, rapper Damon Dash, let alone writer/director James Toback himself playing the name-dropping Professor Hassan al-Ibrahim ben Rabinowitz.I believe Neve Campbell could have done better than this soft-core porn. In this story her character seemed to have it all, but yet still wanted to rebel and test the boundaries, and she needed the million dollars like a hole in the head, since the doting parents were already giving her everything she needed. I won't say how it ended, but it could have been done differently instead of it ending abruptly and unsatisfactorily.I agree with the some reviewers who said that the music was overdone and too loud. I think that was probably done on purpose, to cover up all the lame scenes that would have been horrifically boring otherwise without some sort of distraction. The only really watchable scene that caught my interest was with her and Dominic Chianese. The dialogue and acting during their scene was really interesting.Of course, if you've heard about this movie at all - and most have not, I think - it's because of Neve's naked body. She did the sex thing, and even the lesbian thing, way back in ""Wild Things."" That was just barely a step above pornography. The year before that, Neve worked with Robert Altman, in a project which she herself initiated. I guess with ""When Will I Be Loved,"" she decided that, now that she's becoming a respectful actress, she had to do an art movie where she gets naked and makes out with a girl. In reality, this is about a step and a half above porn.Other than that it's an interesting little film that has a good performance by Campbell and while this is not exactly riveting in terms of drama it does give fans of Toback another chance to view his unique talent.",3,The movie might have accomplished just as much by using cardboard cut-outs.,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,2418,"['was', 'one', 'weird', 'rather', 'pretentious', 'movie', 'held', 'interest', 'did', 'feel', 'writer/director', 'Toback', 'forgot', 'write', 'third', 'act', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'manipulative', 'sexpot', 'boyfriend', 'Fred', 'Weller', 'rich', 'older', 'Italian', 'guy', 'Dominic', 'Chianese', 'situation', 'pretty', 'much', 'ripped', 'off', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'Toback', 'film', 'interesting', 'plot', 'especially', 'introductory', 'sequence', 'back', 'forth', 'Campbell', 'Weller', 'telling', 'how', ""'re"", 'connected', 'film', 'have', 'odd', 'cameos', 'thrown', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'really', 'playing', 'including', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'rapper', 'Damon', 'Dash', 'let', 'alone', 'writer/director', 'James', 'Toback', 'playing', 'name-dropping', 'Professor', 'Hassan', 'al-Ibrahim', 'ben', 'Rabinowitz.I', 'believe', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'story', 'character', 'seemed', 'have', 'yet', 'still', 'wanted', 'rebel', 'test', 'boundaries', 'needed', 'million', 'dollars', 'hole', 'head', 'doting', 'parents', 'were', 'already', 'giving', 'everything', 'needed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'ended', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'instead', 'ending', 'abruptly', 'unsatisfactorily.I', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'music', 'was', 'overdone', 'too', 'loud', 'think', 'was', 'probably', 'done', 'purpose', 'cover', 'up', 'lame', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'horrifically', 'boring', 'otherwise', 'sort', 'distraction', 'only', 'really', 'watchable', 'scene', 'caught', 'interest', 'was', 'Dominic', 'Chianese', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'scene', 'was', 'really', 'interesting.Of', 'course', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'movie', 'most', 'have', 'not', 'think', 'Neve', 'naked', 'body', 'did', 'sex', 'thing', 'even', 'lesbian', 'thing', 'way', 'back', 'Wild', 'Things', 'was', 'just', 'barely', 'step', 'pornography', 'year', 'Neve', 'worked', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'project', 'initiated', 'guess', 'When', 'Will', 'Be', 'Loved', 'decided', 'now', 'becoming', 'respectful', 'actress', 'had', 'do', 'art', 'movie', 'where', 'naked', 'out', 'girl', 'reality', 'step', 'half', 'porn.Other', 'interesting', 'little', 'film', 'good', 'performance', 'Campbell', 'not', 'exactly', 'riveting', 'terms', 'drama', 'give', 'fans', 'Toback', 'chance', 'view', 'unique', 'talent']",N/A

In the first, Neve Campbell seems to be a young woman who is looking for a relationship and job, trying to find her way in New York. She seems to be sexually adventurous but nave. In the second, we see young hustler scheming to make a variety of cons. He is a shifty character who is easy to dislike. Only the second part is correct.The woman is exploring her sexuality but she is anything but innocent. The hustler is her boyfriend who not only appreciates her beauty but appreciates that she is independently wealthy. He wants to use her in every sense of the word. He finds himself used instead.The girl uses her sexuality as a weapon and it is not merely a defensive weapon. She uses it to get want she wants and sometimes what she wants is just to stick it to someone else. It is a potent weapon she wields with skill. The path of destruction she leaves is awesome in its thoroughness and casual attitude towards right and wrong. Some of the victims are deserving. The hustler comes to mind. Others are less so; the Italian billionaire is merely smitten and has too much money but does not deserve his fate. Other victims are just that: victims. The parents who think their daughter is a nice girl come most readily to mind but so does anyone else who mistakenly crosses her path.This is a good example of artful moviemaking but I did not enjoy it overly much.

Bernabo,"[103, 117]","If you are watching a naked woman taking a shower and what is communicated is not only sexuality but also power and confidence, then the performance of the actress certainly has to be credited.  But writer-director James Toback also knows how to film Neve Campbell in the opening scene of ""When Will I Be Loved,"" giving her character the time and space to make even the most juvenile minded viewers realize that there is much more than a naked body in a really great looking shower area being displayed for their gratification, whether they want to admit as much or not.Juxtaposed with Campbell's Vera taking a shower are scenes of Fred Weller's Ford on the streets of New York, using his cell phone to hustle some deals.  This montage suggests a connection and we discover Ford is Vera's boyfriend.  The relationship seems one of fire and ice, for Ford is always in motion, always trying to work and con, and Vera is calm, cool, and collected.  It is not until we see them making love that we have any real idea of what she gets out of the relationship, because Vera comes from money and does not need Ford to take care of her.  But the idea that Vera is smarter than Ford is key to what happens in this film, as is the idea that she is as much of a con man as he is, just more subtle and decidedly more effective.Ford's latest target is Count Tomasso Lupo (Dominic Chianese), an Italian millionaire media mogul, but all of the hustler's overtures are rebuffed until the Count sees Vera.  The count is a creature of instinct and after seeing Vera a couple of times he makes Ford a counteroffer: $100,000 to sleep with Vera.  At this point we are all thinking ""Indecent Proposal"" and the parallels are so obvious that the characters talk about that film as a reference point.  But this time around we are in the realm of film noire and the rich guy is not the predator.The DVD features ""Scene Sexplorations: Vera's Sexcapades,"" in which the director and actress talk specifically about the four sex scenes in the film: ""A Nice Hot Shower,"" ""Girlfriends,"" ""Ford's Big Score,"" and ""A Tryst With a Twist.""  What is interesting is how they analyze all of the erotica in terms of Campbell's character, while still acknowledging the irony your first scene in a film being show naked taking a shower and, ah, having fun.  My initial thought was that these scenes were more erotic than they were sexual, and I am still leaning that way, but Toback and Campbell are correct.  Ultimately all four of these scenes are key moments of insight into Vera's character, each a piece of the puzzle that explains why the end game in ""When Will I Be Loved"" plays out the way that it does.Do not be distracted by some of what Toback throws in the way.  You can make Lori Singer's appearance fit, but you might strip a few gears trying to make sense of Mike Tyson claiming he is not Mike Tyson in this one.  ""Vera's Sexcapades"" really are the best parts of the film because they are at the center of the film.  The best scene is the verbal dance that Vera and Tomasso have when they are finally alone together in her apartment.  You can make the argument that the Count is also a con-man, but with an elegance that Ford would never appreciate.  Vera not only appreciates that level, she can play there, and when she learns what Ford has not told her about the situation she decides to play her own game.I like the idea that Vera basically changes direction on the fly, but if the ending of ""When Will I Be Loved"" is not contrived it is certainly extremely convenient.  But this film comes down to Vera's character and Campbell's performance (although her nudity probably got more press).  Vera remains a woman of mystery at the end, but if we never understand why she wants to be the assistant to Hassan al-Ibrahim ben Rabinowitz, professor of African-American studies, we know why she puts Ford and Tamasso through the wringer, and that is more important to the plot.  Hopefully Campbell's performance will help her move beyond the Scream Queen stage, because she has several nice moments in this 2004 film and when I say her best moments are often when she is not talking I am still talking about her performance, no matter what the adolescent boys of America might think.",4,Neve Campbell does a lot more than shower in this one,1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,4252,"['are', 'watching', 'naked', 'woman', 'taking', 'shower', 'what', 'communicated', 'not', 'only', 'sexuality', 'also', 'power', 'confidence', 'then', 'performance', 'actress', 'certainly', 'be', 'credited', 'writer-director', 'James', 'Toback', 'also', 'how', 'film', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'opening', 'scene', 'When', 'Will', 'Be', 'Loved', 'giving', 'character', 'time', 'space', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'juvenile', 'minded', 'viewers', 'realize', 'much', 'more', 'naked', 'body', 'really', 'great', 'looking', 'shower', 'area', 'being', 'displayed', 'gratification', 'want', 'admit', 'much', 'not.Juxtaposed', 'Campbell', 'Vera', 'taking', 'shower', 'are', 'scenes', 'Fred', 'Weller', 'Ford', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'using', 'cell', 'phone', 'hustle', 'deals', 'montage', 'connection', 'discover', 'Ford', 'Vera', 'boyfriend', 'relationship', 'one', 'fire', 'ice', 'Ford', 'always', 'motion', 'always', 'trying', 'work', 'con', 'Vera', 'calm', 'cool', 'collected', 'not', 'see', 'making', 'love', 'have', 'real', 'idea', 'what', 'relationship', 'Vera', 'money', 'not', 'need', 'Ford', 'take', 'care', 'idea', 'Vera', 'smarter', 'Ford', 'key', 'what', 'film', 'idea', 'as', 'much', 'con', 'man', 'just', 'more', 'subtle', 'decidedly', 'more', 'effective.Ford', 'latest', 'target', 'Count', 'Tomasso', 'Lupo', 'Dominic', 'Chianese', 'Italian', 'millionaire', 'media', 'mogul', 'hustler', 'overtures', 'are', 'rebuffed', 'Count', 'Vera', 'count', 'creature', 'instinct', 'seeing', 'Vera', 'couple', 'times', 'Ford', 'counteroffer', '100,000', 'sleep', 'Vera', 'point', 'are', 'thinking', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'parallels', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'characters', 'talk', 'film', 'reference', 'point', 'time', 'are', 'realm', 'film', 'noire', 'rich', 'guy', 'not', 'predator.The', 'DVD', 'Scene', 'Sexplorations', 'Vera', 'Sexcapades', 'director', 'actress', 'talk', 'specifically', 'four', 'sex', 'scenes', 'film', 'Nice', 'Hot', 'Shower', 'Girlfriends', 'Ford', 'Big', 'Score', 'Tryst', 'Twist', 'What', 'interesting', 'how', 'analyze', 'erotica', 'terms', 'Campbell', 'character', 'still', 'acknowledging', 'irony', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'being', 'show', 'naked', 'taking', 'shower', 'ah', 'having', 'fun', 'initial', 'thought', 'was', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'erotic', 'were', 'sexual', 'am', 'still', 'leaning', 'way', 'Toback', 'Campbell', 'are', 'correct', 'Ultimately', 'four', 'scenes', 'are', 'key', 'moments', 'insight', 'Vera', 'character', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'why', 'end', 'game', 'When', 'Will', 'Be', 'Loved', 'out', 'way', 'not', 'be', 'distracted', 'what', 'Toback', 'way', 'can', 'make', 'Lori', 'Singer', 'appearance', 'fit', 'might', 'strip', 'few', 'gears', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'claiming', 'not', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'one', 'Vera', 'Sexcapades', 'really', 'are', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'center', 'film', 'best', 'scene', 'verbal', 'dance', 'Vera', 'Tomasso', 'have', 'when', 'are', 'finally', 'alone', 'together', 'apartment', 'can', 'make', 'argument', 'Count', 'also', 'con-man', 'elegance', 'Ford', 'would', 'never', 'appreciate', 'Vera', 'not', 'only', 'level', 'can', 'play', 'there', 'when', 'what', 'Ford', 'not', 'told', 'situation', 'play', 'own', 'game.I', 'idea', 'Vera', 'basically', 'direction', 'fly', 'ending', 'When', 'Will', 'Be', 'Loved', 'not', 'contrived', 'certainly', 'extremely', 'convenient', 'film', 'down', 'Vera', 'character', 'Campbell', 'performance', 'nudity', 'probably', 'got', 'more', 'press', 'Vera', 'woman', 'mystery', 'end', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'be', 'assistant', 'Hassan', 'al-Ibrahim', 'ben', 'Rabinowitz', 'professor', 'African-American', 'studies', 'know', 'why', 'Ford', 'Tamasso', 'wringer', 'more', 'important', 'plot', 'Hopefully', 'Campbell', 'performance', 'will', 'help', 'move', 'Scream', 'Queen', 'stage', 'several', 'nice', 'moments', '2004', 'film', 'when', 'say', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'often', 'when', 'not', 'talking', 'am', 'still', 'talking', 'performance', 'matter', 'what', 'adolescent', 'boys', 'America', 'might', 'think']",N/A

The fast talking hustler, the self important intellectual, the rich and irresponsible girl with the world at her fingertips.  It all seems so real and familiar.The title of this movie implies that we will see something profound, a young woman seeking a true connection with love.  Yet the movie is not about this at all.  It's really just about two timing hustlers trying to hustle each other because they have way too much time and money on their hands.  In the end, this title should have been reserved for a much better script.The Story and the ScriptThe main problem with this movie is the lack of a truly strong story line.  Ford's character is manipulative and clearly obsessed with seeming more important and connected than he is.  Yet Neve Cambbell plays a girl that is hardly interesting and manipulative in more subtle ways.  We see her randomly jump from scene to scene of banal social interaction and sexual exploration.  And we see him walking from scene to scene trying to have pointless meetings and looking for the next sucker to take advantage of.When a wealthy man, Dominic Chianese ofThe Sopranos, wants to sleep with Neve at all costs, one is never really convinced of the most important part of that: Why???  Somebody with unlimited money would probably have set their glance on a much more interesting woman.All of the plot elements seem forced.  People have encounters with famous people, seemingly just so that they can have cameos in this movie.  WhileBlack & Whiteemployed this technique with a little more purpose, here it is used as an old stand by and seems to actually interfere with the story.  And the climax of the movie is neither believable nor is it impactful.  It just makes you wonder, was this the original script or the result of too many cooks in the kitchen?There are some great actors working in this movie, as well as some good ones.  The handheld camera work is effective for the city scenes, even if it is overused.  And the art direction and sound work on the movie were also very good. But none of the positives can redeem a story with no connection to its title and no believable or compelling elements.ConclusionThis movie should be avoided at all costs.  No matter how much you may like gratuitous nudity and sex in films, even the short length of this movie may be too long to bear.

868214,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0006HC00U,mirasreviews,"[41, 50]","""When Will I Be Loved?"" is a psychosexual snippet written and directed by James Toback. It doesn't seem like a complete story, but a vague character study of a sexually adventurous young woman named Vera (Neve Campbell) who has a way of knowing what she wants and getting it from just about everyone she meets. She allows her lover, Ford (Frederick Weller), a fast-talking hustler always out to make a buck, to introduce her to a wealthy Italian media mogul (Dominic Chianese) who desires her passionately, in exchange for payment in cash.Vera is interesting, because she knows exactly what she wants and where the source of her power lies. It's not surprising that she succeeds given those conditions. But Vera is so narcissistic that she is thoroughly unlikable. And the character study fails in that her motives are often inscrutable. She seems to know what she wants and perhaps even why she wants it. But we don't. Vera has money. She has power. She may be looking for love, although she has an odd way of going about it. She certainly wants revenge.  But that's not the whole story. The film does make the audience wonder about Vera, but we also wonder what the point of it all is. A lot of men want to help Vera discover herself through them. They see her as they want her to be. And she takes advantage. But that's not news. And what advantage she sees in it isn't clear.Neve Campbell and Frederick Weller contribute good performances. The first third of the film is spent establishing the characters by cross-cutting between them, soundtrack blaring. That's too long and too loud. ""When Will I Be Loved?"" may be of some interest if you're a fan of psychosexual intrigue. But if I had to describe the film in one word, it would be ""inconclusive"", both narratively and thematically.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by director James Toback, a theatrical trailer, and ""Scene Sexplorations"", which Neve Campbell and James Toback discuss 4 of the film's most sexual scenes. In the audio commentary, James Toback talks about directorial decisions, story, characters, and filming (which only took 12 days). It's a nice commentary if the movie intrigues you.

A hustler prostitutes his girlfriend to a billionaire, but she decides to manipulate the situation to harm them both.  There's nothing wrong here; plenty of good movies have been made with even less.  The flaws - and they are immense - is in the execution.This movie aspires to be art film, one of those films that seem to transcend conventional film making to present a thought-provoking statement on the human condition.  You can tell this movie wants to be an art film because of the excessive use of classical music.  Whether it is or isn't art is subjective, but I can't help but notice that in its attempt at artiness, we get tediousness and pointlessness instead.  Characters appear and disappear and contribute nothing; an example is Mike Tyson's cameo, which adds nothing to the story and tells us nothing about any of the main characters.This is a movie that some will find good because they'd think that no movie could be this bad intentionally; the viewer might think that he or she is just missing something.

Campbell plays Vera; a pampered, sexually charged young woman living in a beautiful loft paid by her parents, who begins to feel underappreciated by her hustler boyfriend Ford (Fred Weller) and lashes out in one of the few ways she knows how to.  Along for the ride is a wealthy, Italian, media mogul (Dominic ""Uncle Junior Soprano"" Chianese), who desires to spend a night with Vera, and makes an offer that neither Vera nor Ford may be able to refuse.  While When Will I Be Loved offers some wonderfully filmed steamy scenes, the film is a sadly shallow, often floundering take on Indecent Proposal.  Campbell is as gorgeous as ever, but her character is also the only one in the film that is the least bit interesting as well, not to mention the only one that comes anywhere close to being likeable.  With appearances by Mike Tyson, Damon Dash, and Lori Singer (all of which portray themselves) that come out of nowhere, Where Will I Be Loved just falters.

The ending is like aRussian gymnast landing a ""10"" on the high beam.What I didn't like is somewhat minor.  The classicmusic as a background is totally distracting.

I thought some of the street conversations were a little off and didn't feel right, but I was impressed over all.  I was writing a review for 'The Company' and was trying to figure out why I kept thinking there was something wrong with the picture.  It was this film, actually.  The Blockbuster rental was very dark and overly saturated for NTSC.  However, I remember adjusting my NEC studio monitor just for this DVD and being quite shaken with how much dynamic range they'd squeezed into it...more than is usually possible for NTSC.  The picture mastering seemed to be geared more for playback on pro equipment, rather than to be neutral in one's home.  Either they didn't use an NTSC-calibrated monitor, or something like a general gamma value was botched before the master was sent for duplication...maybe just a moved decimal point.  It was a hassle to compensate for this at the playback end, but in an odd way almost worth it to have such a film-like curve that probably wouldn't be possible otherwise.

I had also heard about Neve's shower scene. I wasn't disappointed!This is a very talky film and is definitely one of those where you can't check your brain at the door when you go in to see it. It is not a mindless action flick ... there's barely any serious action in it at all. It does contain violence though and it comes quickly and shockingly. You know something bad will happen but you don't know what it will be.This movie is sort of a more hardcore version of ""Indecent Proposal"" and that particular film is actually mentioned in it by Campbell's boyfriend Ford. He uses it to introduce her to the idea of being with the billionaire so he can get the money.This is without a doubt the best role I've ever seen Neve Campbell in. She is so graceful & elegant, you can hardly take your eyes off her.Many times when she smiled in the movie, I found myself smiling with her. For us guys, we get a great first shot in the movie of Neve totally nude in the shower but that is a pretty much a bonus. The real treat is just looking at her face, watching her mannerisms and observing how she lays the trap for both of these men to fall in.Ebert was right in stating that not many actresses could have played her character effectively.I was quickly drawn in by the excellent character development in the first half of the film which is done so well, you can easily believe the events that unfold at the end. The music for the film starts out with various hip-hop then changes to a equal mix of violin music and then to piano. It fits the film very well.The running time is a bit short though. The movie started at 9:40 pm and when the end credits rolled, I checked my watch to see that it was 10:58 pm. Official specs state that the film is only 81 minutes long.I highly recommend this film!

It's very different from most of her other movies, more daring than Wild Things, and the opposite of The Company. In this slow-paced and dioalogue driven, and minimal plot film, Campbell is the focal point, and eveything else just doesn't seem to work as a thriller.At first, we see Campbell(Vera) taking a shower in a fancy bathroom in an expensive loft her parents bought for her in NY. Meanwhile, her boyfriend/pimp(Ford/Frederic Weller) still busy on the phone trying to arrange a gig, and his latest target is the Italian billionaire(Dominic Chianese). Ford ran into one of his ex, and she wanted to him to pay him back the big chunk of money that he owed her. So he's very desperate to make some money. Vera is rich, and she doesn't have to make a living like Ford, and she does things for fun in a way. She pretty much uses Ford as a sex object, and it was obvious that she doesn't love him. Love is not what she cares about. Vera was offered a hundred thousand for to sleep with Chianese, but she demanded one million, and he gave her the money in cash. Afterwards, she lied to her boyfriend that she was not paid a cent, and that Chianese was a fraud.
