I saw the movie before I read the book. There are some differences with the movie and book which is understandable. Ethan is hardly in the book but he's in most of the movie is one difference. I thought Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson were perfectly cast as Rachel and Darcy. Rachel is a supposed good girl who ends sleeping with her best friend's man. Darcy is a selfish, self-centered party girl who bosses Rachel around. In the book, Rachel and Darcy's friendship is kind of already splintered but in the movie, the two friends are very close which makes Rachel's betrayal even more heartbreaking.

I loved this movie because I love all happy endings and Colin Egglesfield is mucho yummy looking.  I hated this movie for more reasons:1) cheating in relationships2) lying in relationships3) being a doormat in relationships and friendships4) hate the impression it gives to other women that it's ok to wait around for a guy who's in a relationship and that it's ok to cheat.Ginnifer Goodwin drove me crazy.  Her unrealistic eternal optimism about her relationship with Dex (Colin Egglesfield) is stupid, stupid, stupid.  Colin's Egglesfield character is quite possibly the weakest man (in every sense) in any rom-com's I've ever watched.  Can you say wishy-washy?  Oh and Kate Hudson's character was just hateful.  Her character in the movie was just malicious.  Then again, the characters were a trifecta of stupid.  Ethan (John Krasinski) was the only character that made any sense.

1403085,A3QNER0M9CJ22N,B004EPZ070,"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw""","[10, 12]","The movie is about two friends (or as most people have a friend that uses you) Darcy and Rachel. Rachel is the normal one and in law school she met and fell in love with Dex.  Dex, who just happened to be rich and handsome, fell for her. But Rachel was too insecure and young to really get / deal with it. Colin Eggelefield sold me here. He plays it totally like he is in love with Rachel. Darcy comes in and takes Dex, kind of by force, and Rachel runs away feeling she was silly to think Dex wanted her. Of course, the reality is, he did. Dex feeling that Rachel didn't want him and vice versa... tolerates Darcy until years later and the verge of marriage. Look, if you don't know a couple like this in reality... you don't get out enough. I know several really good looking guys that are with women because they are *there*. Many great women just won't push like the Darcy's of the world.On Rachel's 30th birthday Dex and Rachel end up alone with a few drinks to loosen them up and Rachel, confident that things are all over and Dex loves Darcy, just tells him what she felt. Well of course, now they both realize what has happened and Dex just goes for it. They embark on an affair. In the meantime he totally stays with Darcy and I know this is where a lot of people have problems with the move. But it is hard for any man to extricate himself from a situation like that. About to be married, family and friends excited for him and not sure what he is feeling... cold feet? He does make solid attempts to leave Darcy.On the sidelines is Rachel's friend and confidant Ethan. He is rather the voice of the audience acting as someone helping Rachel go for what she wants and providing much of the comedy. As the movie goes on Rachel, Darcy, Dex, and Ethan and some supporting characters all rent a Hampton share and the affair spans the summer. Some of it is funny, some isn't.The movie is sold as a Rom com but mostly is a drama with some comedic elements.

1403086,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B004EPZ070,Anthony Pittore,"[7, 15]","'Something Borrowed' is based on the novel of the same name by Emily Griffin which I've never heard of. It concerns a group of thirtysomethings as they struggle through a love rectangle or trapezoid or whatever shape is made up by Kate Hudson ('How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'), Ginnifer Goodwin ('Big Love'), John Krasinski ('The Office'), and the unfortunately named Colin Egglesfield ('Melrose Place').  It's also occasionally a love pentagon or hexagon if you count Ashley WIlliams & Steve Howey.  As are typical in stories about differently shaped loves, there's lots of betrayal amongst of friends, panicking of unfaithfuls, heartfelt conversations covered in rain, and unnecessary stupidity of everyone involved. . . but, that last bit is expected in any romance, cinematic or real.One major problem with a film about infidelity is that it's impossible to really like anyone involved with the scandal.  Here, we only have the Rachel, the woman who betrays her friend (Goodwin); Dex, the fianc&eacute; who betrays his love (Egglesfield); and, Darcy, the woman betrayed by both (Hudson).  Typically, you can associate with those cheated on solely through sympathy, but that was made difficult for two reasons: 1) Darcy's a secondary character who seems to always act like that girl who always gets too drunk at college parties; and, 2) The movie constantly acts as if it's going to reveal something negative about her past (spoiler: it does).  Granted, no one deserves to be hurt this way for being annoying, but she's still not an enjoyable character to watch.  Maybe things would be different if Darcy and Rachel's roles were swapped, but we all know of hindsight's perfection.  Left alone behind all this despicable behaviour is the typical nice guy Ethan (Krasinski) who, along only with Dex's dad, acts as a voice of reason in the film.  Unfortunately, he's like an umbrella in a hurricane, unable to rescue this mess of humanity from themselves.Now, I suppose this is a film that's not meant to be enjoyed on the level of a typical romantic comedy; but, with this cast and a sugary, generic title like 'Something Borrowed,' a viewer should not be forced to withstand the cringe-inducing behaviour like that of Dex & Rachel.  Never have I so wanted the leads of a romance to be hit by a New York cabbie.  Then again, I also wished that fate upon myself for a while to alleviate the misery of watching these monsters.  Clearly, writer Jennie Snyder & director Luke Greenfield, who have both successfully worked in romance before this film, have talent that should carry them through their futures, but a film this unlikable was not their best step forward to that future.  A romance hasn't been this depressing since last year's 'Blue Valentine,' but at least that film succeeded because of its sad nature and didn't have to battle against it.Final Verdict: 4/10.-AP3-",2,"Simply an unlikable & cringe-inducing ""romance""",1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,2875,"[""'Something"", 'Borrowed', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Emily', 'Griffin', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'group', 'thirtysomethings', 'struggle', 'love', 'rectangle', 'trapezoid', 'shape', 'made', 'up', 'Kate', 'Hudson', ""'How"", 'Lose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Love', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'Office', 'unfortunately', 'named', 'Colin', 'Egglesfield', ""'Melrose"", 'Place', 'also', 'occasionally', 'love', 'pentagon', 'hexagon', 'count', 'Ashley', 'WIlliams', 'Steve', 'Howey', 'are', 'typical', 'stories', 'differently', 'shaped', 'loves', 'lots', 'betrayal', 'amongst', 'friends', 'panicking', 'unfaithfuls', 'heartfelt', 'conversations', 'covered', 'rain', 'unnecessary', 'stupidity', 'everyone', 'involved', 'last', 'bit', 'expected', 'romance', 'cinematic', 'real.One', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'infidelity', 'impossible', 'really', 'like', 'anyone', 'involved', 'scandal', 'Here', 'only', 'have', 'Rachel', 'woman', 'who', 'friend', 'Goodwin', 'Dex', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'who', 'love', 'Egglesfield', 'Darcy', 'woman', 'betrayed', 'Hudson', 'Typically', 'can', 'associate', 'cheated', 'solely', 'sympathy', 'was', 'made', 'difficult', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'Darcy', 'secondary', 'character', 'who', 'always', 'act', 'girl', 'who', 'always', 'too', 'drunk', 'college', 'parties', '2', 'movie', 'constantly', 'going', 'reveal', 'something', 'negative', 'past', 'spoiler', 'Granted', 'one', 'be', 'hurt', 'way', 'being', 'annoying', 'still', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'watch', 'Maybe', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'Darcy', 'Rachel', 'roles', 'were', 'swapped', 'know', 'hindsight', 'perfection', 'Left', 'alone', 'despicable', 'behaviour', 'typical', 'nice', 'guy', 'Ethan', 'Krasinski', 'who', 'only', 'Dex', 'dad', 'voice', 'reason', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'umbrella', 'hurricane', 'unable', 'rescue', 'mess', 'humanity', 'themselves.Now', 'suppose', 'film', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'level', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'cast', 'sugary', 'generic', 'title', ""'Something"", 'Borrowed', 'viewer', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forced', 'withstand', 'cringe-inducing', 'behaviour', 'Dex', 'Rachel', 'Never', 'have', 'so', 'wanted', 'leads', 'romance', 'be', 'hit', 'New', 'York', 'cabbie', 'Then', 'again', 'also', 'wished', 'fate', 'while', 'alleviate', 'misery', 'watching', 'monsters', 'Clearly', 'writer', 'Jennie', 'Snyder', 'director', 'Luke', 'Greenfield', 'who', 'have', 'successfully', 'worked', 'romance', 'film', 'have', 'talent', 'should', 'carry', 'futures', 'film', 'unlikable', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'step', 'forward', 'future', 'romance', ""n't"", 'been', 'depressing', 'last', 'year', ""'Blue"", 'Valentine', 'least', 'film', 'succeeded', 'sad', 'nature', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'battle', 'it.Final', 'Verdict', '4/10.-AP3-']",Something Borrowed

I'm so ashamed of myself!  A grown 30-year old man shouldn't like a comedy like this!  Oh well, haha.It's about Ginnifer Goodwin's character playing the role of a best friend to Kate Hudson, and... one night during a party (a BORING party in the beginning that's 5 minutes of uselessness- you've been warned!) she actually BETRAYS her best friend by sleeping with Kate's fiance.The storyline is that Ginnifer hides this little bit of information from her best friend for the entire movie.  Will Kate ever find out?  You'll have to watch it and see!A lot of the laughs are actually funny though.  Ginnifer Goodwin steals the show, and like always with these type of comedies, the boyfriend/fiance acts like filler who pretends to be funny and romantic but from my point of view (a guys) he's anything but!  He just stands around and...

Romantic comedies almost always get bashed by critiques, but I usually find something entertaining in their cliched, predictable stories. SOMETHING BORROWED is no different, receiving about a 14% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, this movie fails to offer any character to root for, any character that behaves rationally, or any situation that deserves laughter or praise.Kate Hudson's Darcy is marrying Tom Cruise look-alike Dex (Collin Egglesfield), but best friend Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) sleeps with Dex as the movie opens. That's the major conflict. Does Rachel really love Dex? How does Dex feel about Rachel. Can either of them break the news to Darcy? The plot is decent enough, except there is more, including the incredibly pointless Ethan (John Krasinski). Why he is in this movie? Oh, this movie is based on a book, and his character probably had a reason for existing in the book, but not in the movie.There really isn't any reason to watch the romantic comedy released in the summer.

Let me start with some critiques.(spoiler alert)No matter how beautifully it is portrayed, betrayal in any shape or form is not positively received.  In the movie, the very good girl and the very good guy go behind someone's back in pursuit of their 'true desires.'  I guess as the movie was trying to stay true to the plot of the book, that storyline may have been necessary, but in my personal opinion, the main girl and main guy needs to be liked by the audience for the romance to be heartedly received.  I think the only time when disloyalty is allowed by the main characters is when there is a genuine purpose for that plotline.  So, that was a great disappointment.  Another unnecessary plot was the little surprise with John Krasinski's character towards the end.  There should have been 'some' indication throughout the movie, or the character should've stayed constant until the end.  I realize that life doesn't happen that way, but most of the time, movies happen that way.  The little curve ball with Krasinski was not happily received (by me) and completely redundant to the main plotline.But here are the reasons the movie receives a few stars.  Great cast!  I now would like to declare myself a fan of the actress Ginnifer Goodwin (spelling???)  The adorable, vulnerable, indecisive character of Rachel was very very well portrayed by Ginnifer Goodwin.  She is adorable and sweet and although she is not perceived as beautiful or as perky as Kate Hudson, she has no problems carrying a film.  The actor who plays Dex (his name escapes me) has never been in my radar but did a very convincing job of playing Dex.  Some reviewers have dismissed him to be a bad actor but if they're referring to his awkwardness, I kinda think that was necessary to the character he played.  Kate Hudson - need I say anything else?  She was absolutely perfect for the role and was just way too much fun to watch.  And last but not least, John Krasinski.  He added a nice comedic splash to the film and was absolutely lovely.  I critiqued the twist to the Krasinski's character's plotline but he really made it believable.  I think he is definitely an actor to watch out for.Another plus to the movie is that it is really not your typical romantic comedy.  Although, the sneaking behind the back leaves a bit of sour taste in your mouth, I think that there is enough depth and dimension to the movie that will make it worth your Friday night-in to give this movie a go.",3,Trying to be Different,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,2605,"['So..I', 'understand', 'originally', 'book', ""'d"", 'be', 'very', 'curious', 'know', 'how', 'close', 'book', 'movie', 'review', 'Let', 'start', 'critiques', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'matter', 'how', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'betrayal', 'shape', 'form', 'not', 'positively', 'received', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'girl', 'very', 'good', 'guy', 'go', 'someone', 'back', 'pursuit', ""'true"", 'desires', 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'stay', 'true', 'plot', 'book', 'storyline', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'personal', 'opinion', 'main', 'girl', 'main', 'guy', 'needs', 'be', 'liked', 'audience', 'romance', 'be', 'heartedly', 'received', 'think', 'only', 'time', 'when', 'disloyalty', 'allowed', 'main', 'characters', 'when', 'genuine', 'purpose', 'plotline', 'So', 'was', 'great', 'disappointment', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'was', 'little', 'surprise', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'character', 'end', 'should', 'have', 'been', ""'some"", 'indication', 'movie', 'character', 'should', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'constant', 'end', 'realize', 'life', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', 'most', 'time', 'movies', 'happen', 'way', 'little', 'curve', 'ball', 'Krasinski', 'was', 'not', 'happily', 'received', 'completely', 'redundant', 'main', 'plotline.But', 'here', 'are', 'reasons', 'movie', 'few', 'stars', 'Great', 'cast', 'now', 'would', 'like', 'declare', 'fan', 'actress', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'spelling', 'adorable', 'vulnerable', 'indecisive', 'character', 'Rachel', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'adorable', 'sweet', 'not', 'perceived', 'beautiful', 'as', 'perky', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'problems', 'carrying', 'film', 'actor', 'who', 'Dex', 'name', 'never', 'been', 'radar', 'did', 'very', 'convincing', 'job', 'playing', 'Dex', 'reviewers', 'have', 'dismissed', 'be', 'bad', 'actor', ""'re"", 'referring', 'awkwardness', 'kinda', 'think', 'was', 'necessary', 'character', 'played', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'need', 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'was', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'role', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'added', 'nice', 'comedic', 'splash', 'film', 'was', 'absolutely', 'lovely', 'critiqued', 'twist', 'Krasinski', 'character', 'plotline', 'really', 'made', 'believable', 'think', 'definitely', 'actor', 'watch', 'out', 'for.Another', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sneaking', 'back', 'bit', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'think', 'enough', 'depth', 'dimension', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'Friday', 'night-in', 'give', 'movie', 'go']",Something Borrowed

I dont' buy any movies at all, but this one goes on the shelf!Colin egglesfield played a good leading role as the somewhat shy sensible, smart, and practical one who does learn to follow the path to burning embers of heart-filled love on his own path to life. Steve howey is brilliant in the ghoulish funny guy he brings to life as Ginnifer goodwin put it ""take something gross or perverse and make it charming.""I want to say I gave this movie 5 stars because the cast, crew and directors earned it, not because i was laughing the whole time, was not bored but instead interested in the storyline so much to be laughing one minute, and crying either tears of joy or emotions of despair the next. It also was not the fact that the 2 leading ladies are so fabulously brilliant , gorgeous, and at the top of their game as female actors but because the movie flows smoothly without any awkardness revealing a love tale of 2 fresh college students who find their way into each other's hearts by friendship and also real love but get sidetracked by others who don't wait for life to happen.

Such was my experience watching SOMETHING BORROWED, a quirky (sort of) rom-com about BFF Rachel and Darcy (Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson), who've more or less been inseparable all their lives, with Rachel having some self-esteem issues while Darcy always gets her way (and would be fabulously fun to party with).  Thus Darcy is engaged to wimpy Dex (Colin Egglesfield), a dude Rachel has secretly been pining over since law school, and with the wedding rapidly approaching Dex suddenly reveals to Rachel that he, too, is smitten with Rachel, not Darcy.  Accordingly Rachel must decide whether to be happy with spineless Dex (who definitely needs a strong serving of testosterone), or remain bosom buds with Darcy.  Oh, what a dilemma!  And the movie swooshes to its predictable ending--although I'm darned if I remember what it is.And all of the above begs one pertinent question:  Why is John Krasinski in this flick?For all I know I baked a cake and knitted a sweater while watching SOMETHING BORROWED; I was that indifferent.  The only time the film had my undivided attention was when Goodwin and Hudson had a sweet little dance together.

Not a chance. This film would have been dreary no matter when it was released simply because director Luke Greenfield and first-time screenwriter Jennie Snyder regale in the tired clich&eacute;s that permeate what passes for a story of a female friendship that unravels over the noncommittal man that comes between them. Based on Emily Giffin's2005 chick-lit novel, the movie focuses on the ethical compromises women make when they hit their thirties and find themselves enduring the pressure of getting married. Such is the case with Rachel White, a rising attorney who gets herself drunk enough at her thirtieth birthday party to sleep with Dex Thaler, the fianc&eacute; of her best friend Darcy Rhone. What Rachel thinks is an unfortunate one-night stand becomes something deeper since Rachel has had a crush on Dex since they attended NYU law school together.Once their unrequited love for each other becomes exposed, the inevitable complications ensue. However, the complications are less about ethics and more about setting the stage in typical by-the-numbers fashion for the final pay-off. To make the affair between Rachel and Dex seem less illicit, Darcy is, of course, portrayed as a self-absorbed narcissist none the wiser for the deception that the illicit lovers are perpetuating. The only one who knows what's going on is Rachel's conveniently platonic friend Ethan, who naturally encourages her to tell the truth to Darcy. Meanwhile, Darcy is trying to pair Rachel off with a moronic player named Marcus, which shows just how little she thinks of her friend. Endlessly perplexed as to what he should do, Dex continually succumbs to family pressure and turns Rachel away. The back-and-forth shenanigans grow tired quickly, and the film becomes an exercise in patience and sheer boredom. My sympathies go out mainly to Ginnifer Goodwin and Colin Egglesfield who have to play Rachel and Dex in a constant state of frustrated yearning. Goodwin, in particular, has charm to spare, but her efforts are wasted here.No stranger to stupid rom-coms, the indefatigable Kate Hudson appears to be playing the same role she played in the similarly bird-brainedBride Wars, but the enervated air of indifference that informs her performance here is the only reason I find her tolerable. However, leave it to John Krasinski (Away We Go) to steal the picture as Ethan, a warm-hearted lug of a confidante who would have been gay in any other formulaic film and provides the only link to reality for the viewer. His is the one voice of reason for Rachel, but all the while, I kept thinking how this likeable actor really needs to fire his agent and get a role worthy of his comic talents. Steve Howey as Marcus and Ashley Williams as a horsey girl obsessed with Ethan play their repellent stock roles predictably. The movie bounces between Manhattan and the Hamptons in a superficial manner befitting the shallow characters. At the end of it all (...and it felt quite long at 112 minutes), you couldn't help but think to yourself that they all deserve each other.

1403124,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B004EPZ070,Elisabeth,"[0, 0]","**This review contains spoilers**We're given many reasons to dislike Darcy.  She's loud, obnoxious, shallow, and self-absorbed.  However, although the rest of the characters aren't loud like Darcy, they aren't likeable either.First there's Rachel, Darcy's supposed best friend, who cheats with Darcy's fianc&eacute; Dex.  At the end, she says she doesn't regret the affair but only that Darcy got hurt...as if those are separate events.  Although this sentiment gives the appearance that Rachel cares for Darcy, the truth is, she had no respect for Darcy.When she agrees to ""see what this is first"" with Dex, she's showing a disrespect for Darcy's exclusive relationship.She helps Dex break his loyalty to Darcy but when he does the same to her, she pouts, revealing she's just as self-absorbed as Darcy.  Only with low self-esteem, since she's surprised a guy like Dex would desire someone like her.I'm not sure why Rachel craves Dex's approval so badly, though, since he's just as cowardly as she is.  Rachel is a coward for not confessing her affair after sobering up.  Dex is a coward for not standing up to his parents and for only dating Darcy because he thought Rachel wanted him to.  Can't the man think for himself?He's also a hypocrite like Rachel, too.  He acts disgusted when Darcy flakes on Rachel when meanwhile, he's cheating on Darcy, which is worse!  He's a user, too.  He knew Rachel was getting drunk, so he gets her even more drunk so she'll sleep with him...an act he later admits was intentional.Ethan is the guy some reviewers wanted Rachel to end up with, but he's no catch either.  Ethan is hypocrite for being disgusted that Dex runs away from his problems when he spends most of the movie running away from a woman interested in him.  Instead of dealing with his problems head on, he hides and even lies about being gay.  So he's a coward and a liar.When he finds out Rachel has been cheating, he tells her he's impressed and quickly follows by saying good people do bad things.  So he admits she did a bad thing...and he's impressed by that?He rationalizes her cheating saying no one is married yet, which means that like Rachel, he, too, doesn't respect the boundaries of exclusive relationships.So there's no one in this movie to root for, not even Ethan.  There's no victims here either.  Rachel and Dex act like Darcy's their oppressor keeping them caged in their misery when it's really their own passivity that keeps them caged.  Their cheating, therefore, isn't justified even though Darcy cheated, too.  Two wrongs don't make a right.Romantic comedies have hit a new low if backstabbing wimps are portrayed as heroes.  As for the title, I know it's a play on a marriage ritual, but to borrow means to ask first.  Since the affair was behind Darcy's back, Rachel didn't borrow.

Adapted from Emily Griffin's novel by the same name by Jennie Snyder and directed by Luke Greenfield, it rolls our a story of misbegotten romance and circumstances, adds a conscience commentator, throws in a far too desperate man chaser, adds an obnoxious but harmless nerd, and plows along a romance twist that seems to run on too long.Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin, in a role far above her first job as an actress as the chubby girl in 'Mona Lisa Smile') is a lawyer who in law school had a crush on a fellow law student Dex (Colin Egglesfield) but happened to introduce him to her lifelong best friend Darcy (Kate Hudson) who promptly snapped him up and is now a few years later planning her wedding to him. Rachel's best male friend is writer Ethan (John Krasinski) and is the one in whom Rachel confides the fact that she still is in love with Dex.  At a bar party (and there are MANY of these in the film) Rachel and Dex collide and discover their private longings for each other.  In back and forth flashbacks of their pasts we see a strong unspoken love between these two and when it finally consummates before the wedding of Dex to Darcy, problems arise. There are trips to the Hamptons with a lot more drinking and misbehavior and the introduction of nerdy Marcus (Steve Howey) and man-hungry Claire (Ashley Williams) and the seemingly ever-present smart Ethan doling out unheard advice: his lines offer the only sane and realistic opinions about the random silliness of contemporary 'relationships' and Krasinski does this very well.  Things work out just as you would expect them to - irresponsible behavior on most everyone's part, enough potty mouth to keep the script up to current standards, no surprises, but there is some charm. We learn about loyalties and we learn about love.  And that is probably enough for a film of this nature.Kate Hudson is once again in the role of a loud mouthed shallow character (an she has that role polished to a fare-thee-well), Ginnifer Goodwin proves she can manage a lead role, John Krasinki gives one of the best all around performances int he film, and Colin Egglesfield is more than just eye candy.  The movie is not deep, but then it doesn't pretend to be.  it may be predictable but the actors make it better than it is on paper.

Demographics for this genre also marginally exist in LA and elsewhere of course but the inspiration can know only one source - the cloistered nor'easterner.(2.) It was going to be another in a long line dating back to the '20s and put out every four years because human memory of blandness is short and so another chick flick (and a few guys I'm sure) NY centric romantic comedy survives to infect again.(3.)

No, I didn't love it. This flick was a waste of my time. It reminded me a little of the Meryl Streep movie IT'S COMPLICATED. It had all of the cheating of COMPLICATED, but none of that movie's wit, or sympathetic characters. Not that the filmmakers don't attempt to create some (heavy-handed) sympathy for these one-dimensional people. But alas, NO ONE is likable. By the end of the movie, when everything inevitably works out well for all (well, almost all) involved, I just didn't care. In fact, the ending was so forced, so sappy, so pat...frankly, I was angry.We've all come to expect nothing but duds from Kate Hudson. Oh Kate...remember ALMOST FAMOUS? That was a great movie. This one? Not so much.Jim from The Office is TOTALLY WASTED in this movie (and I'm sure he looks back on this movie and WISHES he was wasted). His character exists only to nag and yell at Ginnifer (hey lady, you spelled 'Jennifer' wrong) Goodwin.And the guy playing 'the love interest' Dex? Yawn. I mean, he's pretty and all, but I don't see why these gals would fall for him. The filmmakers should have just called the character Dexter, and then hired Michael C. Hall for the roll. Then Dexter could have wrapped all the characters up in Saran Wrap, tied them to a table, and murdered the hell out of them. VOILA! Season 9 of Showtime's beloved DEXTER.

I was most excited about John Krasinski, and when I saw that he was one of the main characters, I knew the $6.99 Video On Demand rental fee would be worth it.After watching the movie, I noticed on IMDB that Something Borrowed got poor ratings.  It may not have received critical acclaim, but I still enjoyed the movie.  I don't know if I'd ever want to watch it again (primarily because I just don't like Kate Hudson), but I did enjoy it and thought it was a good adaptation of an excellent book.Now let's talk casting for a minute.  I think that Ginnifer Goodwin was a perfect Rachel.  Kate Hudson embodied the selfish, flighty Darcy well, even though Darcy is a brunette in the book.  For some reason, that really bothered me...I felt like they should have darkened her hair for the movie.  Which makes me wonder, have you ever seen Kate Hudson as anything other than a blonde?  I haven't.  Colin Egglesfield was the perfect Dex.  He looks exactly how I pictured Dex as I read the book.  John Krasinski did a great job as Ethan and I think he was the best actor out of the group.One of my favorite things about book to movie adaptations is noticing differences between the book and the movie.  In fact, my husband recently had to ask me to please stop saying, &#34;That's NOT in the books&#34; when watching True Blood.  This was not a problem with Something Borrowed for two reasons: it stayed fairly true to the book (yay!) and I watched it alone.  My husband came home from work about halfway through, watched about 30 seconds of the movie, and hightailed it out of the room, saying he couldn't stomach any more.  There were definitely elements in the movie that were not in the book, but the main themes were the same and the ending was the same.  I have a really hard time when the ending is totally different between the two versions.Overall, I would recommend Something Borrowed to fans of chick flicks and fans of the book.  The book was definitely better than the movie, but the movie was still good.  If you do watch the movie, make sure to watch the credits all the way through.  There's a great little surprise scene at the end that sets up a &#34;To Be Continued...&#34;.",4,I don't agree with the casting but enjoyed the movie,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2327,"['3.5', 'starsI', 'loved', 'Emily', 'Giffin', 'Something', 'Borrowed', 'read', 'review', 'here', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'was', 'most', 'excited', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'knew', '6.99', 'Video', 'Demand', 'rental', 'fee', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'it.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'noticed', 'IMDB', 'Something', 'Borrowed', 'got', 'poor', 'ratings', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'received', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'ever', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'primarily', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'did', 'enjoy', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'adaptation', 'excellent', 'book.Now', 'let', 'talk', 'casting', 'minute', 'think', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'was', 'perfect', 'Rachel', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'embodied', 'selfish', 'flighty', 'Darcy', 'well', 'even', 'Darcy', 'brunette', 'book', 'reason', 'really', 'bothered', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'darkened', 'hair', 'movie', 'Which', 'wonder', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'anything', 'other', 'blonde', 'have', ""n't"", 'Colin', 'Egglesfield', 'was', 'perfect', 'Dex', 'exactly', 'how', 'pictured', 'Dex', 'read', 'book', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Ethan', 'think', 'was', 'best', 'actor', 'group.One', 'favorite', 'things', 'book', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'noticing', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'fact', 'husband', 'recently', 'had', 'ask', 'please', 'stop', 'saying', '34', 'NOT', 'books', '34', 'when', 'watching', 'True', 'Blood', 'was', 'not', 'problem', 'Something', 'Borrowed', 'two', 'reasons', 'stayed', 'fairly', 'true', 'book', 'yay', 'watched', 'alone', 'husband', 'came', 'home', 'work', 'halfway', 'watched', '30', 'seconds', 'movie', 'hightailed', 'room', 'saying', 'could', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'more', 'were', 'definitely', 'elements', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'book', 'main', 'themes', 'were', 'same', 'ending', 'was', 'same', 'have', 'really', 'hard', 'time', 'when', 'ending', 'totally', 'different', 'two', 'versions.Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'Something', 'Borrowed', 'fans', 'chick', 'flicks', 'fans', 'book', 'book', 'was', 'definitely', 'better', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'do', 'watch', 'movie', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'credits', 'way', 'great', 'little', 'surprise', 'scene', 'end', 'up', '34', 'Be', 'Continued', '34']",Something Borrowed

They're just not really something I enjoy, but I love Kate Hudson (How to Lose a guy in 10 days is the only romantic comedy I've ever liked) and Ginnifer Goodwin, so I gave this a chance. Bad idea.The actors in this are great...I had no problems with any of the actors (though Hudson was a bit over the top for my taste) my dislike for this movie stems soley from the writing and the plot.Darcy has NO redeaming qualities. She's self-centered, spoiled, loud, brash, drunk all the time, mean, an attention seeker, cruel and stupid. While Rachel is shown to be a doormat of sorts, I still don't think anyone would put up with Darcy for YEARS. And why would Dex, protrayed as a do-gooder, simple guy who's main issue is a need to please his parents, fall for her (the 'he's never met anyone like me/I'm so hot' reason provided is ridiculous) AND marry her? Why would his rich, stuck up parents approve of her in the first place?The character I really liked, Ethan, totally gets the shaft in this movie. SPOILERS: HE'S the one Rachel should end up with, but after confessing his feelings in a truly humble and believeable way, she essentially pats him on the head and he fades into the background never to be heard from again. He deserved more and was thrown away.But the biggest issue with this movie? The complete lack of a moral code by ANY of the characters. Darcy and Dex are engaged. Rachel is Darcy's best friend who has had a thing for Dex since they met (before Darcy and Dex met). Supposedly Dex has had feelings for Rachel since that point, too, but just decided to get with Darcy anyway (WHAT??). Anyway, Rachel and Dex end up having sex then having a drawn out affair. This is SO wrong! I don't care that Darcy is a total tart with no redeaming qualities...you don't sleep with your best friend's fiance! Yet neither Dex nor Rachel seem to have an issue with this (they say they feel bad about it but still continue). You get the impression that Rachel feels it's OK for her to do this because Darcy has 'taken everything in life that Rachel wanted'. Sorry, but no. You owe it to your self-proclaimed best friend to stay away from her fiance (or make him break up with her first or something!). The whole thing was just wrong.SPOILERS: Darcy later reveals that she has also had an affair in recent months (why she does this is never really explained other than that Dex hasn't had sex with her in awhile and she has a 'connection' to this other guy). Darcy eventually finds out about Rachel and Dex, screams that she hates Rachel (over-dramatic considering Darcy had just said she was 'happy' with the affair guy) and storms away. Two months later, each girl is 'happy' with life. WRONG. You don't get to live happily ever after after you destroy your best friend's relationship by sleeping with her finace! NO. This isn't romantic, it's terrible.I ended up hating most of the characters and sitting in disbelief as the ending was presented as happy despite the horrible way the story had played out. I hate that this film promotes cheating as a way to get what you want. As if the morals of this country weren't bad enough (I don't want to be preachy...I hate those kinds of movies, too, but this was so ridiculous) you give people the idea that fidelity is over-rated.Overall I think the actors did a great job with what they had to work with, but all of them should have passed on this film.

The story came off as too disjointed, and some of the characterizations just didn't work. It's partly the fault of the complicated material - it centers on two best girl friends, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson. Hudson's character is a diva, and about to marry a good friend of Goodwin's (Colin Egglesifled) - who Goodwin still has feelings for, and eventually ends up in an affair with. The story centers around the affair, and Hudson's and Goodwin's friendship.While the film takes a decent stab at exploring infidelity and the complications of true-life romance, the characters end up too unlikable. I just ended up frustrated with everyone - Hudson's character seems too self-centered for anyone to like, Goodwin's too passive, and Egglesfield too dull to be inspiring all this passion and indecision. The film isn't overly tortured about the immorality of all the cheating and lying going on either. And then to top it off, John Krasinski (The Office), whom I'm a big fan of, is misused and underused, as a friend of Goodwin's.So overall, had some interesting moments, enough for 3 stars, but just didn't work at a level beyond that.",3,"Just So-So, A Bit Disconnected and Some Unlikable Characters Hard to Get Past",1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,1310,"['generally', 'chick-lit', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'am', 'forgiving', 'genre', 'had', 'good', 'moments', 'overall', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', '3', 'stars', 'story', 'came', 'off', 'too', 'disjointed', 'characterizations', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'partly', 'fault', 'complicated', 'material', 'two', 'best', 'girl', 'friends', 'played', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Hudson', 'character', 'diva', 'marry', 'good', 'friend', 'Goodwin', 'Colin', 'Egglesifled', 'who', 'Goodwin', 'still', 'feelings', 'eventually', 'up', 'affair', 'story', 'centers', 'affair', 'Hudson', 'Goodwin', 'friendship.While', 'film', 'decent', 'stab', 'exploring', 'infidelity', 'complications', 'true-life', 'romance', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'too', 'unlikable', 'just', 'ended', 'up', 'frustrated', 'everyone', 'Hudson', 'character', 'too', 'self-centered', 'anyone', 'like', 'Goodwin', 'too', 'passive', 'Egglesfield', 'too', 'be', 'inspiring', 'passion', 'indecision', 'film', ""n't"", 'overly', 'tortured', 'immorality', 'cheating', 'lying', 'going', 'then', 'top', 'off', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'Office', 'whom', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'misused', 'underused', 'friend', ""Goodwin's.So"", 'overall', 'had', 'interesting', 'moments', 'enough', '3', 'stars', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'level']",Something Borrowed

However, I can't quite say that for ""Something Borrowed"". It's not that this was a bad movie, because it wasn't. Everybody gave a good performance, and the characters were welcomingly flawed and damaged, yet, ""Something Borrowed"" has a fondness for formula and cliches that ultimately hurts the end result.The story follows Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin), a woman who's never gotten what she's wanted. She had a big crush on Dex (Colin Eggelesfield), ever since law school. One night, on a semi-date with him, he meets Darcy (Kate Hudson), who he falls in love with immediately. Fast forward some time, Dex and Darcy are engaged, and Rachel is turning thirty. Due to drunken behavior, and not-quite-healed wounds, Rachel and Dex have a fling, and the film is about the downfall from that.Ginnifer Goodwin isn't a particularly good actress, yet I like her. She has a kind of cutesy flawed type-A personality that brings this kind of character to life. I liked her in ""He's Just Not That Into You"", an ensemble romantic comedy which I felt that she kind of held together. In this one, she's the heroine you're supposed to root for, and yet it isn't easy to. She sacrifices so much of her potential happiness on her jackass of a best friend. She lies, cheats and betrays everyone, yet, in the end, she owns up to her own issues, which I liked.Kate Hudson was the best thing in this one, for me. Her antagonist Darcy was much better thought-out and realized than the rest of the characters. She plays the bitch awfully well in this one. Soap opera alum Colin Egglesfield is a welcome addition to this soap opera of a story. He does a nice job, he's pretty to look at, and...that's all he really has to be. ""The Office""`s John Krasinski was very good, being the voice of reason among all of the mess going on.What kills this one for me is that it ended almost exactly the way I expected it to. A lot of the characters are reduced to stereotypes, and they never quite come to life. If these characters had more room to work with, and with a better writer, this could have been a fantastic movie. It feels chaotic, yet at the same time, it has a slow pace. It has soap-opera feel, with sitcom-y jokes thrown in. It has a few good moments that almost make it a good movie, but in the end, it falls flat.Apparently, this was a best-selling novel by someone named Emily Giffin. Also, there was apparently a follow-up novel, telling this same story from Darcy's perspective. I can't help but think that would have made a better movie.Grade: C",3,Something Borrowed: Not something great.,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,2665,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'life', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'great', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'saw', 'couple', 'especially', 'good', 'ones', 'year', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'say', 'Something', 'Borrowed', 'not', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'Everybody', 'gave', 'good', 'performance', 'characters', 'were', 'welcomingly', 'flawed', 'damaged', 'yet', 'Something', 'Borrowed', 'fondness', 'formula', 'cliches', 'ultimately', 'end', 'result.The', 'story', 'Rachel', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'gotten', 'what', 'wanted', 'had', 'big', 'crush', 'Dex', 'Colin', 'Eggelesfield', 'ever', 'law', 'school', 'One', 'night', 'semi-date', 'Darcy', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'who', 'love', 'immediately', 'Fast', 'forward', 'time', 'Dex', 'Darcy', 'are', 'engaged', 'Rachel', 'turning', 'thirty', 'Due', 'drunken', 'behavior', 'not-quite-healed', 'wounds', 'Rachel', 'Dex', 'have', 'fling', 'film', 'downfall', 'that.Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'actress', 'yet', 'kind', 'cutesy', 'flawed', 'type-A', 'personality', 'kind', 'character', 'life', 'liked', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'ensemble', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'felt', 'kind', 'held', 'together', 'one', 'heroine', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'root', 'yet', ""n't"", 'easy', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'happiness', 'jackass', 'best', 'friend', 'cheats', 'betrays', 'everyone', 'yet', 'end', 'up', 'own', 'issues', 'liked.Kate', 'Hudson', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'one', 'antagonist', 'Darcy', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'thought-out', 'realized', 'rest', 'characters', 'bitch', 'awfully', 'well', 'one', 'Soap', 'opera', 'alum', 'Colin', 'Egglesfield', 'welcome', 'addition', 'soap', 'opera', 'story', 'nice', 'job', 'pretty', 'look', 'really', 'be', 'Office', 's', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'being', 'voice', 'reason', 'mess', 'going', 'on.What', 'one', 'ended', 'almost', 'exactly', 'way', 'expected', 'lot', 'characters', 'are', 'reduced', 'stereotypes', 'never', 'quite', 'come', 'life', 'characters', 'had', 'more', 'room', 'work', 'better', 'writer', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'chaotic', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'slow', 'pace', 'soap-opera', 'feel', 'sitcom-y', 'jokes', 'thrown', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'almost', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'end', 'flat.Apparently', 'was', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'someone', 'named', 'Emily', 'Giffin', 'Also', 'was', 'apparently', 'follow-up', 'novel', 'telling', 'same', 'story', 'Darcy', 'perspective', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'movie.Grade', 'C']",Something Borrowed

I was not impressed. The acting is great! The cast has awesome chemistry and John Krasinski is a scream as always. What I didn't like is the story. I will say I have not read the book this is based on so I can't comment on whether or not it follows the actual story or not but I found this movie actually kinda depressing.The gist is this: Girl has crush on guy. Guy is engaged to girl's best friend. Guy and girl fall in love and cheat on best friend. Best friend is also cheating on guy. Guy 2 loves girl but doesn't tell her until the end. Then finally it all comes out and everyone lives happily ever after.Really? I'm sorry, but that when I watch a romance or a romcom I want it to end up with the characters getting what or who they deserved. In reality, Dex should've ended up with Claire since he didn't deserve any of the female characters in this role. I liked the twist with Marcus and Darcy...that was kinda cute. Rachel and Ethan should've ended up together, though.

Kate Hudson who hasn't made a good film since Almost Famous plays Darcy, Rachael's lifelong best friend who is engaged to her law school friend Dex played by Colin Egglesfield.

Mr. Egglesfield is pretty wooden as Dex.  He is supposed to be the smart, sensitive type.  Based on what his character is supposed to be, you again can't understand why he would ever want to marry Darcy or be best friends with a shallow womanizer Marcus (Steve Howey) who uses a variation on an injured chipmunk story to bed women.

Kate Hudson was hilarious in one of my favorite films, ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" Ginnifer Michelle Goodwin entertained me in ""He's Just Not That Into You."" I'm a huge ""The Office: Season Seven"" fan so it's always good to see John Krasinski. And my favorite parts of watching the television show ""Reba: Season 6"" were more than likely due to Steve Howey. I know sometimes when you get a film with a lot of good actors in it, it's either going to be really good or have too many cooks in the kitchen and be really bad. This film was the first one. Is there anything unique about it? No, not especially. The film reminds me of a movie-length episode of ""Friends: The Complete Tenth Season"" with an uncomfortable amount of friends having crushes on each other but with a couple more sex buddies. In this film though, the friend who likes the groom-to-be isn't flying to Europe. This one is her very best friend who indirectly blocked a relationship to be. Is Darcy (played by Kate Hudson) wrong for flirting with her best friend Rachel's classmate (Dex, played by Colin Egglesfield), knowing full well Rachel had a crush on Dex? Is Dex wrong for hiding his feelings for Rachel and instead going for Darcy, who later became his fiancee? Or, are neither of them wrong since Rachel didn't really fight for Dex at the time he's single? And what's up with Ethan--is he just a friend or something more with his childhood friends Rachel and Darcy?Although there is plenty of comedy, Marcus is the comic relief we absolutely need when the scenes potentially get a bit too serious or just aren't funny enough.

Ginnifer Goodwin and Colin Egglesfield play the lovers with plenty of unconvincing looks of wanting and feet of clay. The third wheel is Kate Hudson, who once again plays a cliched materialistic party girl (hey, her mom made a career of playing stock characters, so why not?) and John Krasinkski is fairly wasted as the long-suffering best friend. Now, let the games begin.As I referenced earlier, it's nearly two hours and far too long to dangle the will-she/he or won't she/he carrot on the stick in front of the audience. Furthermore, it leaves some loose ends that should've either never been introduced or better resolved. Lastly, it gives us few if any characters to truly care about. No one is honest with themselves or the objects of their desire, and the longer it goes on the less we care about anyone.I'm sure plenty will enjoy it but I found it a hole that sucked the remains of my weekend.

I don't see why it was labeled a chick flick.  There were a lot of males in the movie as well and if the fact that it is a romantic story makes it for females doesn't say much for men. I know many men who would watch this movie, but they are over 30.I was actually surprised when Ginnifer's character ended up with the one she wanted. She had let her best friend who was flashy, take the guy she wanted away. She wouldn't stand up for herself.

It's charming and I would recommend the movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie with a happy ending and a lot of laughs.",5,Funny slightly unpredictable romantic comedy,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,1138,"['absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'genre', 'are', 'generally', 'scifi', 'horror', 'saw', 'nothing', 'predictable', 'film', 'also', 'saw', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'dialogue', 'thought', 'acted', 'naturally', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'set', 'stage', 'characterization', 'individuals', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'was', 'labeled', 'chick', 'flick', 'were', 'lot', 'males', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'romantic', 'story', 'females', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'men', 'know', 'many', 'men', 'who', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', '30.I', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'when', 'Ginnifer', 'character', 'ended', 'up', 'one', 'wanted', 'had', 'let', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'flashy', 'take', 'guy', 'wanted', 'away', 'would', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'herself', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'portraying', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'have', 'been', 'know', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'quite', 'same', 'scenario', 'similar', 'ending', 'credits', 'only', 'thing', 'threw', 'off', 'charming', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'lot', 'laughs']",Something Borrowed

I think I was expecting something different from this film and I guess I got what I expected.  It was different.  2 women, best friends forever, lots of cheating and lying going on, broken hearts, more cheating and in the end, it's all a-okay. I was disappointed.  Kate Hudson gets excited in the end to have a baby with a total spaced out grown up who acts like a teenager.  Really?  It just didn't fit.
