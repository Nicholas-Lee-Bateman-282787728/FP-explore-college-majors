I bought the video hoping to give the two little kitties something to do while I was gone during the day. I put the TV down on the floor, not far from their food and water. I played the video, and watched from a distance to see their reaction. Total indifference! They paid absolutely no attention to it whatsoever. I have tried turning up the sound, playing each segment continuously--nothing works. My cats are far more interested in sitting on the window seat and watching the street, which has no squirrels or bugs or birds.

1113942,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B000XC0E6K,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[26, 28]","All I can say is, ""Oh my God"".  I have two Bengals cats that are one-year old and they love the Discovery Channel, often running around the back of the flat screen to see where the hawks or the birds went.  So naturally, I thought they would love this DVD.  I put it on and they simply walked out of the room.  They literally LEFT the THEATER!  This DVD is simply one person with a handheld video camera walking around the woods with birds chirping in the background between scenes.  The specific scenes are of bright birds in the branches of trees chirping for ten to fifteen minutes and then another stroll through the woods until the next scene.  These include an old lazy cat being tossed a little red string (the cat was bored), ducks floating in a pond, scenes of a fish tank with tropical fish floating around, more lazy cat on the porch scenes - all with simple piano ""Charlie Brown"" type music in the background or some slightly ethereal music for enhancement.  The music was distracting.  There was even a scene where a fluffy ball on the end of a stick was bouncing around the screen to attract the cats.  It was utter nonsense.  The best I can say is that it does loop after one hour to begin all over again.Silence and real animal noises are what cats want.  I would like to see a professional DVD with wild animal noises and vivid bird and animal scenes that a cat would go crazy for.  My cats would love to see an African lion go after a zebra!  This video is amateurish and lacking any attraction - for my cats anyway.  I dislike one-star or negative reviews, but if it saves you some money, then it's worth it.

I'd heard about DVDs for pets and decided to try this one, based on the reviews, and it's been a hit with Spunk from the beginning.  He loves the ducks, but the chickens got him up and standing on his hind legs with his paws on the screen--a real tribute from a cat who lives at the edge of a forest and gets to play outside all day!  I don't know if this would make your cat a viewer, but if you know you already have a cat that's interested in tv, I can almost guarantee you'll both love this video.p.s.
