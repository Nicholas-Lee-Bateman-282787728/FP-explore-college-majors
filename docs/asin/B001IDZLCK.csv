The cinematography and score were beautiful, though at times i felt that the composer had stolen some basic ideas from clint mansell's score to ""the fountain"". The acting was alright with some good chemistry between our two leads, however i think kristen stewart had some entirely painful dramatic scenes that she just couldn't pull off. On the other hand, in stewart's defense, the poor dramatic sequences that were painful to watch had really bad dialogue making it difficult to empathise.

1203663,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B001IDZLCK,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[9, 18]","Every time I hear people talk about Twilight these days, I wish to vomit in disgust. When it comes to vampire films, most of them suck epically. The only vampire films I really enjoyed were the first two Underworld movies and 30 Days of Night. The Underworld films were great for their high-octane action, the interesting and unique storyline, the slick and deadly sexyness of the lead female character, and the great actors. 30 Days of Night was great because it was a refreshing and daring horror film that gave a realistic view of vampires as nasty, vicious, ugly creatures who give you more than just a chew on the neck. Those were great vampire films.Twilight on the other hand is a terrible film that is littered with flaws and oozes with failure. There is no doubt in my mind that this was the worst film I saw in 2008. Not only does it fail as a vampire film, it also fails as a romance film. This film fails every key aspect, which leaves me questioning how anyone actually enjoys this film, though I have come up with two possible reasons. 1. It has the word 'Twilight' on the cover which to these fan girls must mean the movie is automatically good and deserves great reviews! Brilliant! 2. The filmmakers picked a handsome, long-forgotten Harry Potter actor to play the role of Edward, who now seems to be etched into the fantasies of these fan girls. Whatever the reason for their misguided opinions, here is my opinion as to why this film such garbage.STORYLINE: A girl named Isabela (Bela for short) moves to a town called Forks in Washington state with her father who is a police officer after her mother and step father decide to travel cross country. After a short amount of time, Bela eventually adapts and makes new friends at her new high school fairly quickly. She meets a boy named Edward who seems resistant and unwilling to even speak to her. After awhile however, they eventually develop a close relationship after he saves her from being crushed by a van and she learns that he is actually a vampire. During this same time, the town is experiencing a series of deaths resembling animal attacks that no one can explain. From this point on, Bela is pulled into a dangerous world she could have never imagined....YAWN. The storyline for this film is dreadfully convoluted, incoherent, and downright stupid. The relationship and character development is so badly done, the best it can possibly be is laughably bad, due to the sheer level of utter ineptitude.MUSIC: The musical score in Twilight is among the absolute I have ever heard from a film. To think they had the audacity to release such a horrible soundtrack is sickening. The score is so bad I'm surprised my ears didn't bleed from its awfulness.ACTION: The action scenes were very dull and uninspired, loaded with stunningly bad CGI effects. There are a few good scenes, but finding those good moments was extremely difficult because most of this film nothing more than a worthless cesspool. One question: Why were so many of the scenes involving Bela and Edward in slow-motion? And why were there so many bad camera angles? The romance scenes were incredibly boring and the character development is butchered by the hackneyed script, leaving us only cardboard characters with little personality.DIALOGUE: The dialogue is an atrocious mess of nasty cliches. You can literally predict what the characters are going to say next because it's been done hundreds of times before by better films.ACTING: The actors were terrible, and watching them perform their roles was like witnessing a train wreck. It's so awful you can't believe it's happening, yet you can't look away.OVERALL: This film is nothing more than flaming awfulness that intends to steal money and leave a bad taste in your mouth. As for the fact the vampires sparkle in sunlight, WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP. Don't even give this movie a glancing stare.THE GOOD: Some scenes and when this atrocious film ends.THE BAD: Everything not mentioned in the good section.",1,ONE OF THE WORST VAMPIRE FILMS IN CINEMATIC HISTORY  3 OUT OF 10,1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,4000,"['time', 'hear', 'people', 'talk', 'Twilight', 'days', 'wish', 'vomit', 'disgust', 'When', 'vampire', 'films', 'most', 'suck', 'epically', 'only', 'vampire', 'films', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'first', 'two', 'Underworld', 'movies', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'Underworld', 'films', 'were', 'great', 'high-octane', 'action', 'interesting', 'unique', 'storyline', 'slick', 'deadly', 'sexyness', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'great', 'actors', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'refreshing', 'daring', 'horror', 'film', 'gave', 'realistic', 'view', 'vampires', 'nasty', 'vicious', 'ugly', 'creatures', 'who', 'give', 'more', 'just', 'chew', 'neck', 'were', 'great', 'vampire', 'films.Twilight', 'other', 'hand', 'terrible', 'film', 'littered', 'flaws', 'failure', 'doubt', 'mind', 'was', 'worst', 'film', 'saw', '2008', 'Not', 'only', 'fail', 'vampire', 'film', 'also', 'romance', 'film', 'film', 'key', 'aspect', 'questioning', 'how', 'anyone', 'actually', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'two', 'possible', 'reasons', '1', 'word', ""'Twilight"", 'cover', 'fan', 'girls', 'must', 'mean', 'movie', 'automatically', 'good', 'great', 'reviews', 'Brilliant', '2', 'filmmakers', 'picked', 'handsome', 'long-forgotten', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'Edward', 'who', 'now', 'be', 'etched', 'fantasies', 'fan', 'girls', 'reason', 'misguided', 'opinions', 'here', 'opinion', 'why', 'film', 'such', 'garbage.STORYLINE', 'girl', 'named', 'Isabela', 'Bela', 'short', 'town', 'called', 'Forks', 'Washington', 'state', 'father', 'who', 'police', 'officer', 'mother', 'step', 'father', 'decide', 'travel', 'cross', 'country', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'Bela', 'eventually', 'new', 'friends', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'boy', 'named', 'Edward', 'who', 'resistant', 'unwilling', 'even', 'speak', 'awhile', 'however', 'eventually', 'develop', 'close', 'relationship', 'being', 'crushed', 'van', 'actually', 'vampire', 'same', 'time', 'town', 'experiencing', 'series', 'deaths', 'resembling', 'animal', 'attacks', 'one', 'can', 'explain', 'point', 'Bela', 'pulled', 'dangerous', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'imagined', '.YAWN', 'storyline', 'film', 'dreadfully', 'convoluted', 'incoherent', 'downright', 'stupid', 'relationship', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'badly', 'done', 'best', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'laughably', 'bad', 'due', 'sheer', 'level', 'utter', 'ineptitude.MUSIC', 'musical', 'score', 'Twilight', 'absolute', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'film', 'think', 'had', 'audacity', 'release', 'horrible', 'soundtrack', 'sickening', 'score', 'so', 'bad', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'ears', 'did', ""n't"", 'bleed', 'awfulness.ACTION', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'dull', 'uninspired', 'loaded', 'stunningly', 'bad', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'finding', 'good', 'moments', 'was', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'most', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'worthless', 'cesspool', 'One', 'question', 'Why', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Bela', 'Edward', 'slow-motion', 'why', 'were', 'there', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'camera', 'angles', 'romance', 'scenes', 'were', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'character', 'development', 'butchered', 'hackneyed', 'script', 'leaving', 'only', 'characters', 'little', 'personality.DIALOGUE', 'dialogue', 'atrocious', 'mess', 'nasty', 'cliches', 'can', 'literally', 'predict', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'say', 'next', 'been', 'done', 'hundreds', 'times', 'better', 'films.ACTING', 'actors', 'were', 'terrible', 'watching', 'perform', 'roles', 'was', 'witnessing', 'train', 'wreck', 'so', 'awful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'happening', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away.OVERALL', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'flaming', 'awfulness', 'steal', 'money', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'fact', 'vampires', 'sparkle', 'sunlight', 'WHAT', 'LOAD', 'OF', 'CRAP', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'movie', 'glancing', 'stare.THE', 'GOOD', 'scenes', 'when', 'atrocious', 'film', 'ends.THE', 'BAD', 'Everything', 'not', 'mentioned', 'good', 'section']",N/A

Twilight is about as awkward and goofy a production as anything I've ever seen.

Robert Pattison I believe to have actual talent behind all that white powder on his face, but he phoned in his lines here. Or at least it was on purpose for us to believe he was faking it all along. I'm not sure how interesting it could be really. Twilight is essentially a story about a bad relationship.Ah I'm giving it far to much credit already. in the end it's completely harmless.

It consists of some action, and  few scenes, particularly with leaping and superspeed running, that was almost had me laughing with how ridiculous it looked on screen, however I did enjoy it, for what it is.I never read the book, but after seeing this movie, I immediately decided to buy the series via amazon to read during my leisure. It was not so much the fact that the story, in general, was that amazing. However, consistently throughout the movie, it seemed to hint at a much more complete character setup for each of the characters. The movie only teased us with all of these deep, meaningful characters and ideas, yet many of these characters only seemed to have a couple lines in the movie, which just did not fit the depth that the movie suggested these characters had. Had the movie been lord of the rings long, it might have had more time to fill in the gaps I am missing from the character development. However, these teasers are enough to encourage me to want to read the books to determine more about the characters and to continue the storyline where it leaves off.Overall, the movie was a bit cheesy, and while its ""romanticism"" might be enough for teenage girls, there were many points in it where I had to roll my eyes and go ""oh geese"". The story felt incomplete, which leaves me wondering how much was left out from the book that would add to the intriguing story. I felt some of the special effects were not done well, and seemed almost comical when placed on screen in the manner that they were. I also felt that in the beginning, the sense of time was really off. It was very hard to tell when days, weeks, or months have gone by in the movie at any given part.  The movie did manage to get you to really like the collin family, and care about the characters and their development. I think this was done well, particularly the baseball scene.So a decent movie, if you are willing to forgive that it has a lot of depth it simply can't place into a movie from a book without making it impossibly long. If you are someone who can't forgive that fact, then this movie may seem confusing to you if haven't read the book, or a disappointment if you have.",4,Not a bad book translation,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2235,"['following', 'movie', 'girl', 'vampire', 'love', 'flick', 'action', 'few', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'leaping', 'superspeed', 'running', 'was', 'almost', 'had', 'laughing', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'looked', 'screen', 'however', 'did', 'enjoy', 'what', 'is.I', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'immediately', 'decided', 'buy', 'series', 'amazon', 'read', 'leisure', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'story', 'general', 'was', 'amazing', 'However', 'consistently', 'movie', 'seemed', 'hint', 'much', 'more', 'complete', 'character', 'setup', 'characters', 'movie', 'only', 'teased', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'characters', 'ideas', 'yet', 'many', 'characters', 'only', 'seemed', 'have', 'couple', 'lines', 'movie', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'depth', 'movie', 'suggested', 'characters', 'had', 'Had', 'movie', 'been', 'lord', 'rings', 'long', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'fill', 'gaps', 'am', 'missing', 'character', 'development', 'However', 'teasers', 'are', 'enough', 'encourage', 'want', 'read', 'books', 'determine', 'more', 'characters', 'continue', 'storyline', 'where', 'off.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'romanticism', 'might', 'be', 'enough', 'teenage', 'girls', 'were', 'many', 'points', 'where', 'had', 'roll', 'eyes', 'go', 'oh', 'geese', 'story', 'felt', 'incomplete', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'book', 'would', 'add', 'intriguing', 'story', 'felt', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'not', 'done', 'well', 'seemed', 'almost', 'comical', 'when', 'placed', 'screen', 'manner', 'were', 'also', 'felt', 'beginning', 'sense', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'off', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'tell', 'when', 'days', 'weeks', 'months', 'have', 'gone', 'movie', 'given', 'part', 'movie', 'did', 'manage', 'get', 'really', 'like', 'collin', 'family', 'care', 'characters', 'development', 'think', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'particularly', 'baseball', 'decent', 'movie', 'are', 'willing', 'forgive', 'lot', 'depth', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'place', 'movie', 'book', 'making', 'impossibly', 'long', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'fact', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'confusing', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'disappointment', 'have']",N/A

It looks as though it were made for an afterschool TV special (but even then, I've seen ones that were better done than THIS!)Kristen Stewart was cast as the female lead, Bella. She has absolutely no emotion and is incredibly boring (though Bella in the books often comes across that way, too) Stewart is pretty enough to be Bella, but that's all. Unfortunately, for a film, being pretty is not all it takes to make it a GOOD movie. Stewart has one facial expression (whether she is talking, having a romantic scene with Edward, or being tortured by a vampire) and blink so much one would think she had some sort of eye disorder. She also stutters to much in this movie. Robert Pattinson, sorry, fangirls, but he's really not very attractive. He looks nothing like the ""godlike creature"" as described in the books. He tries too hard to look like a tortured soul that the effect is that he looks constipated. His makeup looks odd. Parts of his skin are pale and other parts look like regular skin. And he looks as though he is wearing too much lipstick to make his lips look red (""Maybe it's Maybelleine) Although the actor that plays Jasper isn't in it for very long, he, too, looks constipated and looks like his having a bad hair day. The other actors portraying the rest of the Cullens were good, however, the pale makeup on some of them looked strange (Carlisle, for example, did not look good at all with blonde hair and very white skin.) Taylor Lautner is a pretty good actor overall, so at least they picked one good actor.The dialogue was horrible as well.

Twilight, as a film, is almost so badly shot and choreographed that most movie aficionado will dislike it immediately; it almost qualifies as an ""awesomely bad"" film. Awesomely bad because there were quite a few laughable moments. I believe that in order to truly appreciate this film, as an adult, the literature needs to be read. When you watch the film after becoming well verse in the literature, it seems like a surprisingly good film(only because it maintains the spirit of the novels). I put off watching it, because mainly I am an adult and many reviews had named it sophomoric. There are so many popular vampire franchises out, that anything in that genre needs to be compared. Since Twilight, True Blood, and Vampires have at least three main components in common, I would like to point out the one in which Twilight exceeds by miles; it remains true to it's canon.Twilight has succeeded in bringing Mrs. Meyers work into a different medium without ruining its core. The main flaw is the way some of the actors portrayed their characters, mainly that Edward was constantly smiling instead of not showing emotions( I blame this on the director, not the actor). Another flaw within the film has to do with pace; the film did not flow as smoothly as it could. There was far too much camera focus on the main characters staring at each other or off into space. There were quite a few important scenes from the book that should have been included; they should have actually showed him asking Bella a million questions instead of alluding to it. Movie watchers may find it hard to believe they could fall in love that quickly.

1203688,A6PQ7RFSU38WR,B001IDZLCK,Amazon Customer,"[3, 4]","I am a fan of vampires, werewolves and gothic stuff. I was a little leery about Twilight when it first came out, but I decided to not be close-minded and give it a shot. Anne Rice did some pretty good stuff with vampires, so who knows what could come of it. I'm going to list my problems.1. Kristen Stewart. I'm not sure about her character. Does she even CARE about Edward, or Jacob, or is she just on a quest to be a vampire and she needs these two to get what she wants.Also, it doesn't make sense to me that--when she's not that pretty, compared to all the other women in the cast--every guy is just bat-shit insane over her. It's just so weird that she's so moody and anti-social and everyone is just killing themselves to make her the queen of the world. Maybe they should've cast Megan Fox to play Bella (sure, her acting is terrible, but at least people would understand why she's in here, cause she's hot). At best, Kristen Stewart is plain.2. Jacob. What is his motivation? Is he actually in love with Bella, or is he only after her, because he figures if he gets her he can piss off the vampires? The reason I ask is, in the first movie, he doesn't seem particularly interested in her, romantically, until she's already with Edward. So, does he really want her, or is it just part of the feud with the vampires?3. I think I've been watching too many Dracula movies, or something, but I can't help but feel that five movies about werewolves and vampires trying really hard to NOT be werewolves and vampires is a little...boring.If you put Anna Kendrick as Bella and have her used to wearing revealing outfits, that would make it a lot better for the male audience. It makes me laugh, but I heard someone refer to Twilight as 'feminist porn'.Twilight is now a part of vampire mythology, whether people like it, or not.

But, as usual, the idolatrous masses have jumped the common sense ship and raved about this movie with the argument that ""it must be brilliant, because it's Twilight"".Forget the hype for just a second and hear me out before you pan this review. I sat down to watch this with my 21 year old daughter 122 minutes later I was amazed, truly amazed. A wafer thin plot surrounding a mortal/vampire love affair with more padding than a stiff sofa. The acting, locations and effects (as cheap as they are) are all OK, and the movie is NOT awful or anything, but come on! More plot holes than Swiss cheese,I'm expected to believe that Bella takes a few days to figure it all out (after no other person has a clue) falls head over crucifix for bad boy Edward, and then his family of ""nice"" vampires help save her from the marauding ""bad"" vampire James?Throw in divorced parents, a stand off Daddy, who's also a Sheriff and, a ton of High School angst and fitting in, and that's about it really.I also (I'm sure I'm not the first) couldn't help thinking about the excellent HBO series True Blood.In that series, a mind reading mortal falls for a vampire who's mind she cannot read, in this a mind reading Vampire, falls for a girl who's mind he cannot read? Funny eh?There's also a ton of other similarities, but that's by the by really.The bottom line is that Vampires are sexy, scary and always make a good story. Screen adaption wise, this movie does nothing that Buffy the Vampire Slayer didn't do infinitely better in the past.The bottom line - I gave it 3 stars, it's OK, it's certainly NOT great, but will undoubtedly be a great franchise of movies for the film company and the author, who will ride the squealing teen masses wave.

The only thing wrong was the action to it wasn't good nor played out in an interesting way.  The movie almost seemed pointless.  It's basically about a family of vampires who try to fit into the ordinary human life and they do it remarkably so.  One vampire eventually falls for a girl that he meets in High School and from there the movie revolves around that but it just seemed so simple that it wasn't really worth getting into.  Maybe it's because I've seen so many romance related movies and this one just seemed like the most basic one you could ever watch.  There was one fight scene vampire vs. vampire but again, it was minor, nothing interesting, and it ended quick. This movie could've used some better scenes instead of just watching vampires playing baseball as one scene showed.  Some scenes were good but the rest were mostly dull and I lost interest.

1203700,A21XZF5ZHKK5EM,B001IDZLCK,"Antoinette Johnson ""Pooky""","[2, 6]","First off let me say I never read the books and I'm not interested in the books which I will explain in this review. Now... Twilight...Where wil I begin.Things I hated:Story: Basically a girl whos in love with a vampire...thats it! Wheres the plot you ask? Well there is no plot! This whole movie is basically about this detestable Mary Sue Bella who falls in love with a vampire in less than a week! Nothing deep, nothing exciting, just nothing! Another thing I don't get is that in the book (from what I've seen on the internet) and movie she sets up the fact Edward is a vampire as a twist. Problem is on the back of the book she gives that away. This story is also terrible.Characters: Out of all characters I garentee you Bella is the one you'll hate the most. From the moment she arrives everyone  at school want to be her friend, boys want to date her, and all she knows is the towns dull and Edward. For the entire movie shes obsessed with Edward. Even when he reveals hes a vampire she takes it in a way thats just baffling. She also wants to be a vampire! That quick! Do she show any emotion or shock? No! The fact that Kirsten Stewart can't act makes it even worse. This might not seem like much now, but you'll see more on why i hate her  so much when you see her actions in the following movies. Somehow this chick is the center of all the wars and battles in this series.Now Edward. This fool is abusive and bipolar. Why fangirls love him so much I don't know. The scariest part is that girls actually wish boys were more like him. To that I say BullS***. If I had a guy like Edward who gets smart at me and change moods like hes PMSing I would kick his *** to the curb. Just like Bella his actions in later movies will make you hate him even more. Hes also constantly telling Bella they shouldn't be together or she should stay away yet he keep coming back! Dude you're a hypocrypt!The only character I sort of liked was Charlie and maybe Jacob. What Bella says to Charlie near the end of the movie made me want to b****slap her.Action: WHAT ACTION! Nothing happens in 90% of the movie! When something does happen its not only stupid but last only about a minute. The whole vampire baseball scene was also really stupid because it makes no sense. If thier so strong that hitting a ball sound like thunder than the bat should completely shatter. Plus that scene was boring.Romance: I can't believe girls think this is Romantic. What are somethings that make every romance interesting? Conflict, chemistry, and character development. Its nonexistant in this story. The only chemistry that they have is that Bella wants him because hes a vampire and he wants her because she smell good...Thats it! No personality! In the entire series theres really no conflict in thier relationship. Jacob was a potential conflict. That is untl Breaking Dawn where Myer does one of the dumbest things i ever seen in modern history. The enemy vamps aren't even a true conflict because really they don't do ****. Now character development...nonexistant. All the characters are the same by the end of New Moon. I also don't find watching a girl in her sleep at night romantic. That is just disturbing on so many levels! Plus to have that girl not be bothered like any normal girl would!Look and sound: This movie look so cheep! I hate the blue look it has. It just adds to the boredom. The music did nothing for me. It honestly looked like a PBS show like lost or something.Sparkles: These aren't vampires! I know peaple alter vampires all the time, but they at least keep important traits that show they are still bloodsucking monsters! Twilight vamps have none of these traits. Whats funny is that in that sparkle scene they made it look like we were going to see something monstrous and plausible for why they can't walk in daylight. What did we get...Sparkling! Vampires don't have to burn in sunlight, but we need a good reason like thier powers drain,they show too much of thier abnormalities, or anything but Sparkling! She couldn't come up with anything shocking or mildly interesting.Relating: How can anyone honestly say they relate to Bella?! How?! She takes women back 200 years when she is constantly getting in trouble and have to be saved!

Sheepfielder,"[8, 12]","What do you get when you combine Lifetime Original Movie acting with laughable special effects and a cringe-inducing string of ""brooding teen"" cliches (i.e., the script)? Answer: ""Titanic!"" However, if you swap the boat and all that water for some vampires and a not-so-subtle undercurrent of ""abstinence-only"" education, you get ""Twilight."" (Hey, at least they knocked golashes in ""Titanic""). Taken together, both films prove two things: (1) teenage girls are idiots, and (2) with very little effort, anyone can make a billion dollars by pandering to them.All genre-mocking aside, ""Twilight"" is just a poorly made movie from beginning to end. The special effects are shamelessly bad. It's almost as if the producers knew they were going to be swimming in profits like Scrooge McDuck no matter what kind of movie they squatted down and pushed out of their hinterland orifices, so why waste cash on a decent production budget?Poor FX might be forgiven in an ostensibly character-driven tale such as this, but the dialogue is clunky and unintentionally hilarious, especially when the brooding, star-crossed teen lovers are expressing their frustrated ""dry"" love. Remember rolling your eyes and groaning during ""Attack of the Clones"" when Anakin tells his gal-pal that he likes her 'cause she's not like sand? Yeah, it's that bad. Of course, it doesn't help that such awful lines are delivered by actors who seem to think that squinting and talking like they're perpetually out of breath projects genuine emotion.If you're a teen vampire lover, and you're not an idiot, there are much better youthfully themed bloodsucker movies out there to satisfy your lust for the sanguine juice.

But this was the chosen movie for 'movie rental night'at my place, so I watched it, prepared to hate every moment.At first, my fears seemed supported--the movie opens with that completely superfluous prologue from the novel, delivered as a voiceover by Kristen Stewart.  The impact is greatly lessened when it's repeated almost word-for-word, later in the film.The movie didn't have a big budget, and it shows.  The 'sparkle' effect is such that you hear it more than you see it--a crystalline chiming sound effect comes up when the vampires are exposed to sunlight, but the visual effect is very minimal. But the scenery is absolutely gorgeous, and adds a great deal to the atmosphere and mood, unfiltered by book-Bella's sullen perception.The plot is improved by introducing James & Co. much earlier and giving them a real aura of menace.  I had no trouble believing that those three were a real threat to Forks and any other human they came across.  These vampires don't have fangs, so the hissing/growling scenes looked a little silly, especially during the baseball game.  The CGI effects for the eyes might be called subtle by some, but I only caught them by direct mention during the commentary.There are improvements to characters as well.  Charlie is *greatly* improved, he acts much more like a father *and* a police chief than he ever did in the book, but sadly, the main plot *requires* that he act very stupidly and carelessly at a key moment.  (What decent father allows his very upset teenage daughter to start a nearly 1,200 mile car trip *at night*?)  The interaction between Billy and Charlie is hilarious.  The scenes at La Push are greatly improved by simply letting Bella and Jacob be awkward teenagers instead of the laughable attempted seduction in the book.  The teenagers act more like real teenagers instead of catty rivals/dense clods that exist only to bring trial to Bella's life. Some of the initial performances are forced, but these characters weren't exactly well-developed to begin with, leaving the script writer and the actors with very little material to work with.  And the biology teacher was a great source of comic relief.The relationship between Bella and Edward is a bit forced, but it is in the book as well.  In the commentary, the director says that several people made notes in their scripts that the couple 'fell in love too fast'.  It's very difficult to judge the passing of time in this movie, it all seems to happen with a week, as opposed to months.  Kirsten Stewart's performance made me actually not despise Bella, which is as hard as pleasing some of the die-hard fans.  Robert Pattinson made a decent Edward.  The character is built up to an almost impossible degree in the book, constantly described as 'angelic' an 'Adonis', and perfect.  Not much for an actor to work with there, really.The soundtrack has a few gems also:  Robert Pattinson's contribution, the Black Ghost song, Muse, and Linkin Park all make appearances.  ""Decode"" while catchy, doesn't really make a lot of sense, and I tend to roll my eyes at songs that appear only during the end credits unless I *really* like ther performer.  Iron & Wine is a great band, but ""Flightless Bird, American Mouth"" is not one of their better songs.The last part of the movie is as winceworthy as the book, but ends on a great note, courtesy of the actress who plays Victoria.All in all, I would hardly call this a romantic classic, or consider it a grand love story, but it makes for an enjoyable rental/weekend movie.  It's pretty, the music is pretty good, and the story mostly holds together.  Enjoy the movie as a movie, not as visual representation of the book--even if, unlike me, you're a huge fan of the written text.

Unfortunately, despite the fact that I went into this movie open minded, I didn't really like it that much. I have not read the books so I understand that that might have been my problem. While others had a strong foundation and understanding of the Edward/Bella relationship, the movie made it seem like super puppy love as opposed to the undying forever love that I imagined this story was trying to establish,To be fair, I kept comparing the romance to Buffy and Angel from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There was so much development to their love (granted it was a tv show so they had more time to create their romance) but I really felt that during this movie, Edward and Bella seemed to fall in love over night... and that may be how love is in high school, but I expected more and deeper interaction. This was also upsetting in light of all the many airy non-dialogue scenes of them looking at each other or holding each other. I thought that time could have been used better.Edward came off as kinda of weird. Very attractive but WEIRD. The whole storming out of class thing looked more like he had to go to the bathroom than like he was terrified of Bella's unreadability. His awkwardness was especially strange in light of the fact that he turned into a super cool guy when they started going out-- taking her to dinner after saving her from those brutes and walking into school and prom with his arm around her. I can see how people like Jacob better. Despite going through high school so many times, Edward does not seem well-adjusted whereas Jacob seems like a nice cool guy.I was more interested in the background characters than anything else.  Edward's family seems fantastic. The baseball scene was really fun and cute. The fact that they tried to cook for her also seemed so wonderful. Also, Bella's dad seems great. I hope the story develops their relationship more.I will probably watch the second movie but if that one still lacks substance rather only devoted to Edward and Bella's longing glances at each other, that will be it for me.

1203714,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B001IDZLCK,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Well, I couldn't help seeing Cedric Diggory, but other than that, this movie was pretty good. I liked it better than I expected to. In fact, the only part I really disliked was when the good vampires fought the bad vampire.Does sound strange that way, doesn't it?Also, I have to admit I don't know enough about 21st century high schools to know whether the one these kids went to was fairly typical or rather idealized. It seems a bit too PC, if you know what I mean. Not only multi-ethnic, but very unselfconscious about it. And the teacher actually sounded like a reasonably decent guy. Well, it is a small town, after all; I suspect things are a little better there.Anyway, Bella, a nice young lady who reminds me of someone, but I'm still trying to figure who, moves to Fork, Washington, to live with her father, the police chief of Fork, while her mother and her new husband go off adventuring. She likes her mother and her step-father, but she doesn't want to just travel with them when they seem to not quite know what they are doing.Fork is a very small town indeed, and right by a reservation. So the chief of police is friends with what is apparently a chief of the local tribe. Or at least a salty old dog in a wheelchair who seems to take everything with just that sort of humor I remember from the Native Americans I got to know when I was in Michigan. You know, you're never sure whether they are laughing at themselves, or at you, or at life in general.Also living nearby is a Dr. Cullen and his rather odd collection of adopted teens. They stick together, don't have much to do with the other kids, and are all very pale. When the sun is out, they take off school on their father's excuse. Edward Cullen (played by Robert Pattinson, who also played Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter series, and with much the same charm) reacts very oddly to Bella, especially since she shares his biology lab table as it is the only open space when she arrives mid-term. Does he like her or dislike her, and why is he so strange?Well, since the publicity on the film has already told us, it is no secret that he is a vampire, and frankly, they could have gotten to that point a little sooner and moved the story along a little faster. Bella, being a bright girl, picks up on a few clues and ""googles"" her questions, including one about a tribal legend one of the native boys told her, while obviously wishing she were far more interested in him and far less interested in Edward.Meanwhile, Edward has grown very protective of Bella, and in fact risks revealing his super-human strength and his ability to read minds (no, not all vampires can do that; just him, he states rather wryly) to save her life a couple of times. Finally, he introduces her to his family, and they accept her as best they can. Then the bad vampires show up. The really blood-thirsty one (literally), who hunts for sport, refers to her as ""a snack"" and makes a grab for her. Things get pretty hectic after that.Just in case there are one or two people who don't already know the story, that's as far as I will go. I enjoyed it, and I can see how if I was 40 or 50 years younger, I would have enjoyed it even more. I will say I'm looking forward to the sequel.

What better way to cash in on the recent Vampire craze due to first the Anne Rice novels and then the HBO series ""True Blood.""  The next logical step was to create a series for teenage girls (and a few effeminate teenage guys) who consider this to be great literature and who probably also enjoy American Idol and other such mind-numbing foolishness.  I finally put myself through the hour and 45 minutes during a bed-laden Saturday.  I laughed all the way through it.  The script could easily have been written by 4th graders.  There isn't much point in my complaining further because if the script sucks, the movie can't be saved.  Hats off though...

I am however going to tell you what I think about the special features.This 2 disk Special edition includes a ton of goodies guaranteed to please any Twilight fan. And I have to say this was the first time watching that I didn't compare the movie to the book. And I found that it stands very well on its own. Even if you've never heard of Twilight (what planet have you been on?) you will enjoy this.I had also forgotten how awesome Charlie is (scene stealer) and I did notice that the special effects don't look quite as cheesy on the small screen as they did in the theatre.Disk 1 (122 minutes)Extended scenes: (5 of them) With director's introduction. Too bad they couldn't have left these in.Audio commentary:  With director Catherine Hardwicke, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart.Music videos: Muse-Black hole (Stephanie Meyer briefly introduces video), Paramore-Decode, Linkin Park- Leave out all the rest.( very cool, live performance)Disk 2 (78 minutes)7 Part Documentary: (55 minutes)The journey from page to screen. My favourite extra on the disk. Really interesting behind the scenes look at the making of the film.Deleted Scenes: (5 of them) Again, too bad they couldn't have been left in especially the finger biting meadow scene.Comic Con Phenomenon: (8minutes) Where the screaming began. 6000 fans have a Q&A; with Rob, Kristen, Taylor, Edi, Michelle, Cam, Catherine and Stephanie MeyerTheatrical Campaign: Teaser trailers, Sneak peaks (5 in all)Highly recommended, This is a very good movie even if you've never heard of Twilight and if you're a fan than this is what you've been waiting for.

1203752,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B001IDZLCK,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[7, 8]","I did not expect to like this movie.  For one, I think vampire love stories have been overdone to death.  Coppola's DRACULA, starring Gary Oldman, is one of my all time favorite movies and I really didn't need any pretenders to that throne.  This was before I saw Edward as played by actor Robert Pattinson.  In a nutshell, anyone who was ever a teenage girl will instantly grasp the appeal of this movie.  There you are leading the typical angst ridden teenage life when in walks this gorgeous supernatural being who is totally in love with you.  He lifts you out of your ordinary existence into an extraordinary one.  He woos you in extraordinary ways too, even flying you around your Pacific Northwest territory and watching you sleep with adoration on his face.  He never sleeps, of course.  I would be surprised if men liked this movie.  I think a guy would only watch it if his girlfriend insisted. He also has the considerable after viewing problem of measuring up to Edward/Pattinson, which will be pretty depressing.  The special effects are nicely done.  The female lead does a good job.  The plot is good vampires vs bad vampires, aside from the love story that is.  Absolutely no one would watch this movie though without  Edward/Pattinson.  I saw a recent poll on VANITY FAIR about the sexiest, most beautiful man in movies today.  Robert Pattinson just routed every other man of any age in movies today in that poll.  Everyone voted for him.  Since every woman was once a teenage girl, that is all you need to be to fall in love with this movie.  The last time I saw a video which had this kind of effect was when Colin Firth played Darcy in PRIDE & PREJUDICE.  I am absolutely unsurprised TWILIGHT was directed by a woman, Catherine Hardwicke.  Being a woman who was once a teenage girl, I am sure she knew exactly how to proceed with this material.  I am tempted to give this less than 5 stars because I am rather ashamed I liked it this much.  It is a big guilty pleasure movie for me.  However, I then think, ""Hey, I'm not a movie critic.  I can really, really enjoy something without being all torn up over artistic merit.""  So the five stars stays.

What do you get when you get when mix bad acting, bad FX, bad OK production quality, the tin plot of a tween novel, and shove them into the over used genre of vampires? A pretty good guilty pleasure movie.The thin unbelievable plot: Bella our heroine played by the most unattractive 16 year old actress the studio could find moves from her mother (Sarah Clark AKA Nina Meyers) in Arizona to Fork Washington (Get it?) to live with her father (Billy Burke another former `24' cast member.) who's also the local yokel sheriff. This is due to an unexplained highly public tragedy involving drunk driving.At her new school she befriends the token Asian math club and the token Amerid kids from a tribe of wolves. (Why did the casters find the ugliest teen actors ever? Doesn't this defeat the purpose of a teen movie?)Bella also meets the Cullens. A family of five foster kids. They are whiter than Michael Jackson, dress in black, don't eat meals, have weird eyes, and don't come to school on sunny days. Get it?No, the other characters are too stupid to realize the obvious even after the Cullens display supernatural powers!Romance spring between Edward Cullen (finally someone more flaming than Lestat) and Bella the virgin. Therefore we must spend the first hour going through the claques' of Edward warning, ""Stay away from me. Your life will be in danger."" while not following his own advice and spending as much time with her as possible.Herro Yuy and Relena Dorland  did this better in `Gundam Wing' in the classic scene where Herro rips up a coveted invitation to Relena's sweet sixteen party saying, ""I'll kill you."" or ""I'll destroy you."" if you watched the afternoon airing.The shy girl is supposed to pursue the dangerous dark stranger. Not the other way around. Edward pursuing Bella can be attributed to mere teen horniness.Edward reveals that the Cullens are ""vegetarian vampires"" only eating live animals. They live a typical suburban secret life in a normal house. The master parents work as doctors, while their supplicants go to high school. Their favorite pastime is baseball. So if the Cullens live or exist like the Cleavers, doesn't this defeat the coolness of vampires?What happened to the party all night sleep all day, hang out in an abandoned hotel, biker gang of the `Lost Boys?'It is also never explained why Master Cullen converted these 5 teens or why they deliberately live the most boring lives imaginable.After 90 minutes there's finally some action when another clan of vampires responsible for Sheriff Taylor's unexplained cannibalistic murders, declare war on the Cullens. PG-13 violence ensues. Even the profanity is edited out (badly) by simply muting the sound while the mouth still pronounces, ""fuuuu caaa.""So if `Twilight' intentionally nixes everything about the vampire genre we love and keeps everything we hate, why is it worth seeing? It just is. Despite all its flaws it still has some charm.This has not persuaded me to read the neutered vampire novels by Stephanie Meyer attempting to be the next VC Andrews and Anne Rice.

So I was more than thrilled to learn that a movie was being adapted out of them. Always one of the mind that ""book is always better than the movie,"" I didn't have huge expectations given the budget and director. Even my lowered expectations were not prepared for the monstrocity that appeared on the screen. For 120 minutes, I watched a wooden cast run through the motions of the script. Kristen Stewart could not have been worse. Bella is a warm and charmingly clumsy young woman. Although in the books, she appears aloof at times, she loves fiercely and with all her heart. Ms. Stewart never even came close to any of those emotions except the aloofness. Her stilted portrayal of Bella was heart-breaking to watch. Even when she was being tortured by James, she barely managed a facial expression.Robert Patterson was a ""passable"" Edward. He maintains Edward's stoic and agonized behavior after meeting Bella. However, Edward of the novels is a larger-than-life presence with a restrained passion that is always teetering on the brink. Patterson falls short in his portrayal, leaving the viewer with a feeling that Edward is really nothing but a jerk. And the chemistry between Patterson and Stewart is...wait, there was none. I got the impression that they didn't even LIKE each other a majority of the time.As for the other actors, they were fairly true to the novel. Carlisle and Esme gave decent performances as loving and doting ""parents."" Rosalie's snide and pretentious behavior was right on the mark; Alice's sweetness, Jasper's restraint, even Emmett's teddy bear/jackal persona were all very believable. BUT THEY WERE ONLY IN THE MOVIE FOR TEN MINUTES TOTAL!!!Another disappointment was the holes that the movie left in the story. One of the key pieces in the first novel was the desire the high school boys felt for Bella. In hindsight I understand why the director chose to leave most of it out. NO ONE would believe that these boys would hone in on Ms. Stewart's lethargic and non-effectual Bella. On the plus side, the scenery was beautiful and the soundtrack was pretty decent. I can only hope that with the change of director, and the fact that the studio has seen how popular the movies COULD be, they increase the budget and buy a new CGI team and get their lead actors some ACTING lessons.Finally, a note to Stephanie Meyer.

There she meets Edward, a 17-year old high school student who has been 17 for approximately 100 years. Bella and Edward are drawn together, even after Bella figures out that Edward is a vampire. Though they cannot touch for fear that it will release Edward's blood frenzy, their relationship grows. But there are other vampires in the area, ones that aren't ""vegetarians"" like Edward and his family, who eat only animal blood. The human bloodsuckers are making it difficult for Edward and his family to stay, as they fear their secret will be revealed. Can Edward and Bella's love survive the challenges of a human-vampire relationship?In considering this movie, it's important to remember that it is a movie for tweens and young teenagers. The horrors of being a vampire are softened greatly, as is the violence inherent in feasting on the living. Given this perspective, Twilight plays better than you might think. The relationship between Bella and Edward is developed slowly and richly, and the problems they face create an internally consistent world that is interesting and well-thought out. Edward's fear of being a monster and breaking into a blood frenzy and hurting Bella seems genuine. Still, the romantic Edward might not seem so romantic if he were shown regularly sucking the blood of deer and squirrels. Being a demon is never easy, and it's a little too easy in Twilight.The vampire pallor is expertly done, making Edward's family look different but still human enough to blend in; it does seem too convenient that they are so beautiful, however. The draw of a vampire is supposedly so great that no physical beauty is needed, and movies like Nosferatu and Bram Stoker's Dracula, even Interview with the Vampire seem more realistic in creating a physical difference between vampire and human. The attempts at showing how fast and strong Edward is are less well done, and clearly stand out as special effects.But this is soft horror, and as soft horror, intended for a 13-year-old audience, it's not bad at all.

Seems to me that TWILIGHT is just a ripoff of the ideas fleshed out with BtVS and moved from Cali to Seattle.Secondly, the scripting is deplorable. The movie is overwhelmed with the ""your a vampire"" storyline, that everybody already knows anyway and eventually the writers decided that people were going to get bored if they didn't get to some Evil Vampire stuff, and of course they were right. So when James (Cam Gigandet) goes on the attack, there is no basis for it. It just comes out of the blue while the Vampires are playing some Vampire baseball in the woods. Run. Hide. Get the human, Bella (Kristen Stewart) out of here because he'll kill her.TWILIGHT, on the surface, is a creation of somebody who watched a lot of BtVS and wanted some of that action.

But I will review it anyway for anyone who is contemplating buying it with out first watching or reading it (I haven't read it).The movie is... okay. I guess.It's very slow moving, I did find some of the cinematography to be semi interesting and quite fitting.. but again it was nothing new (washed out colors). The dialogue is poor to say the least. I suppose I should read the books. There were quite a few characters that I just didn't understand their placement. I do comprehend it is a series but regardless when you turn something in to film to have a major portion of the cast have absolutely nothing to say about themselves and no others telling their pasts or motivations it gets confusing and semi frustrating.I used to be a huge Buffy fan and I will admit that's what drew me in- in retrospect they are incomparable. Buffy as a series had a sense of self; it was clever and able to poke fun of it's own genre and in a lot of cases managed to deal with a lot of teen girl issues in the process.Twilight seems oblivious to the fact it's laughable.Not the worst movie ever-- by far not the best.I know this drew no real conclusion.I suppose the movies general apathy got a hold of me.Which it is.It's too long (for its lack of interesting visuals and/or script), the acting leaves something to be desired...other notes...for parents:the movie has no nudity (there is a very brief scene were you see the female lead in her panties and a t shirt while in bed- but there is nothing sexual pertaining to the scene), the actors are all surprisingly modestly dressed, the violence is relatively minimum for what it is, basically no swearing.sorry for that I'm not a parent nor do I want to be one nor do I particularly care about any of those things (come on Snatch is one of my favorite movies) but lately I've found myself paying attentions to aspects like that in films created for a younger audience",2,it is what it is I suppose...

1203774,AG0NH4KD36H2,B001IDZLCK,C. L. Greer,"[3, 4]","Let me start off by saying I have read all of the Twilight books, and for the most part, I do enjoy them. I teeter with my thoughts on this movie. While I really liked the physical casting of the actors (Kristen Stewart really looks like how I imaagined Bella, Ashley Greene for Alice, Rob Pattinson for Edward etc.), as for their talent as actors I am not so sure. I loved the Cullen cast, Nikki Reed, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, Jackson Rathborne, Peter Facinelli, and Elizabeth Reaser all did an excellent job with the few lines they had. The movie really stayed true to the book as far as how often these characters were in the movie. I do wish, however, that they would have kept the hotel discussion between Bella and Alica explaining how becoming a vampire works. It really added a lot to the book and could have explained the ending better.As for Kristen Stewart, I am highly disappointed. She lacked any sort of emotion whatsoever in the film, and can we say stutter much? What is with that? Bella, in the book, while shy is still very certain of herself, of her words in particular. She thinks things through before stating them vocally. Kristen portrayed Bella as some insecure teenager. The book even states that Bella is much more mature for her age because of caring for her mom, while this was stated in the film, it was definitely not portrayed by the actress.Rob Pattinson didn't disappoint, for me. While I think he should work on his American accent a little, I thought he did a fairly good job of portraying the Edward from the book. I have read some reviews stating that he should have been more masculine, but I disagree. I thought he did an excellent job balancing his physical power as a vampire and his love and gentleness with Bella.I loved Billy Burke as Charlie. Excellent. That's all I can say. While the book is pretty humorless, Billy added that dry, sarcastic humor to his lines that gave the movie that little added spunk. I would even go as far to say that he was my favorite actor in the film.Now, onto the movie itself. The script, in several parts, was awful. The scene in the woods when Bella tells Edward she knows drives me nuts. I wish I could just fast-forward through that part. ""Say it, out loud"" is by far the worst line in the entire movie (and second to that is ""spider monkey""--WHAT?!?!?). I feel they should have definitely stayed true to the book as far as when the revealing occured, in the car, on the way home from Port Angeles. I also really wished they would have kept the Blood Lab scene, however I can understand why it was taken out, I guess I just had a soft spot for that scene in the book. It really showed the affection Edward had for Bella, the movie makes it just seem like Edward loves Bella because her blood smells so good.Overall, it's an ok movie. It's fun to watch only if the books are read. I would think if I saw this movie without the books to back it up, I would have hated it. I think I will still buy it when it is released, the movie still puts a smile on my face, despite technicalities that I dislike.",3,Mediocre,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,3081,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'have', 'read', 'Twilight', 'books', 'most', 'part', 'do', 'enjoy', 'teeter', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'physical', 'casting', 'actors', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'really', 'how', 'imaagined', 'Bella', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'Alice', 'Rob', 'Pattinson', 'Edward', 'etc', 'talent', 'actors', 'am', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'loved', 'Cullen', 'cast', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'Kellan', 'Lutz', 'Jackson', 'Rathborne', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'all', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'few', 'lines', 'had', 'movie', 'really', 'stayed', 'true', 'book', 'as', 'far', 'how', 'often', 'characters', 'were', 'movie', 'do', 'wish', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'hotel', 'discussion', 'Bella', 'Alica', 'explaining', 'how', 'becoming', 'vampire', 'really', 'added', 'lot', 'book', 'could', 'have', 'explained', 'ending', 'better.As', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'am', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'lacked', 'sort', 'emotion', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'stutter', 'much', 'What', 'Bella', 'book', 'shy', 'still', 'very', 'certain', 'words', 'particular', 'things', 'stating', 'vocally', 'Kristen', 'portrayed', 'Bella', 'insecure', 'teenager', 'book', 'even', 'Bella', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'age', 'caring', 'mom', 'was', 'stated', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'portrayed', 'actress.Rob', 'Pattinson', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'think', 'should', 'work', 'American', 'accent', 'little', 'thought', 'did', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'Edward', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'stating', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'masculine', 'disagree', 'thought', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'balancing', 'physical', 'power', 'vampire', 'love', 'gentleness', 'Bella.I', 'loved', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'Charlie', 'Excellent', 'can', 'say', 'book', 'pretty', 'humorless', 'Billy', 'added', 'dry', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'lines', 'gave', 'movie', 'little', 'added', 'spunk', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'far', 'say', 'was', 'favorite', 'actor', 'film.Now', 'movie', 'script', 'several', 'parts', 'was', 'awful', 'scene', 'woods', 'when', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'drives', 'nuts', 'wish', 'could', 'just', 'fast-forward', 'part', 'Say', 'out', 'loud', 'far', 'worst', 'line', 'entire', 'movie', 'second', 'spider', 'monkey', 'WHAT', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'definitely', 'stayed', 'true', 'book', 'as', 'far', 'when', 'revealing', 'occured', 'car', 'way', 'home', 'Port', 'Angeles', 'also', 'really', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'Blood', 'Lab', 'scene', 'however', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'taken', 'out', 'guess', 'just', 'had', 'soft', 'spot', 'scene', 'book', 'really', 'showed', 'affection', 'Edward', 'had', 'Bella', 'movie', 'just', 'seem', 'like', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'blood', 'smells', 'so', 'good.Overall', 'ok', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'only', 'books', 'are', 'read', 'would', 'think', 'saw', 'movie', 'books', 'back', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'hated', 'think', 'will', 'still', 'buy', 'when', 'released', 'movie', 'still', 'smile', 'face', 'technicalities', 'dislike']",N/A

It was so well writen you felt as though you were part of the forks community and knew Bella & Edward as friends.We needed to turn the page just to see what happens to each of our friends. We had an emotional investment in the characters.I don't know what happened to the movie. Now I know they have to make ajustments and rewrite parts to make a script workable......but how many rewrites did they have to do? I didn't feel anything for the characters on the screen. What happened ? It was choppy, many scenes were cut out others were added.There was no true character development....I thought that Kristen  was a bit wooden for Bella.The scene where Bella & Edward were outside in the open sun....he was suppose to sparkle like diamonds, it looked more like sweat.( FX not so good )When Bella was in town walking down an alleytrying to meet up with her friends 3 thugs were following her getting ready to attack her....all of a sudden Edward shows up to save the day. ( for those that read the book we knew he could read the minds of the thugs and not Bellas ) it wasn't explained in the movie and a lot of people were confused by this.There were so many scenes that were off it would to long to go through it all. However, there were some bright spots...The baseball scene was true to the books. Inside the Cullens home was interesting ( love all the graduation caps framed on the wall )not in the book , but interesting.

1203792,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B001IDZLCK,Danny G.,"[1, 1]","Why can't Hollywood make more movies like Twilight? A fantasy love story that more than satisfies the adult mind and heart! Without a doubt, this is the best vampire film ever made! I can't praise this story highly enough! It is, also, by far, one of the best movies of the year! Wow! I didn't want it to end!!What makes Twilight such a hit? First, it turns the Vampire myth on it's head. Vampires do have choices! They don't have to be evil! In fact, they can form cooperative families to protect themselves from being discovered and from fellow malevolent vampires. Vampires also can love just as deeply as a any human being! In other words, vampires can feel tenderness, appropriately adapt to their surrounding environment and follow a demanding ethical code!Beside the delightful love story, there's superb acting and mind-boggling cinematography. I've never been to the American Northwest before, but seeing this amazing part of the world up close and personal - it's now on the top of my places to vacation list!Even though all the sequels stink, I'm grateful for this original and very moving film!Postscript 11-19-12:  Twilight is back on track!

I thought vampires died when they stepped into the sun? Even if its a cloudy day, isn't the sun technically still out? Nope, guess I was wrong! That just proves the ""genius"" of this ""masterpiece""!Seriously though, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life! How dare this random woman from nowhere totally rewrite the laws of vampirism! Forget wooden stakes, crucifixes, garlic and definately don't wait for the sun! Just rip apart the vampire and then burn the remains, an easy task. It's not like us mere mortals can do it. We just wait around for an invulnerable character to kill another invulnerable character! I know they're strong but when can a vampire be as strong as Superman, have speeds that rival the Flash, a nose like a bloodhound and random superpowers that appear when the plot calls for it? I know hypnosis is supposed to be one of them but I guess that was too farfetched for them. And since when did all the victims of a vampire attack suddenly just die? Isn't this a disease that gets passed on and the victims just turn into vampires? Guess not. And I know they're supposed to be attractive and alluring, but when did vampires become pretty poster boys? Christopher Lee and Bela Lugosi had twice the on-screen charm and charisma than this little boy could muster in his entire being! Even the animated Dracula in The Batman looked more charming and threatening. And that was a CARTOON!!! They're supposed to be dark and mysterious, not out and about attending school and playing, of all things, BASEBALL!!! Ladies and gentlemen, I present the All-American Vampires. Sounds like the extended side of the family of Lily Munster doesn't it?In all my years of film research (and from watching alot too) I have never in my life seen a more disturbing romance in a movie. And I thought Titanic had a horrible romance story!I've seen good romances:Mamma Mia!- Pierce Brosnan and Meryl StreepThe Dark Knight- Christian Bale and Maggie GyllenhalThe Mummy (1, 2 & 3)- Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz/Maria Bello (deal with it)And I've seen bad:Batman Begins- Christian Bale and Katie HolmesBatman Forever- Val Kilmer and Nicole KidmanBewitched- Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrel (he's just bad in general)But this is the creepiest romance I've ever seen! The female lead Bella doesn't like the fact that he's a vampire at first but when she finds out that he sneaks into her room at night and watches her, it makes it all OK. Right. All there is is a lot of staring between Edward and Bella. I guess that's the romantic thing to do these days, stare at each other, mouth agape. And get this, this is the best part, the only way they can be together is if Edward bites her! Just as long as they're happy. And Bella conforms to her new ""family"" so she can fit in and not be an individual. Did Samantha from the original Bewitched, knowing that she'd stay young and live forever, make Darrin a warlock just so they could live together? In Superman II, did he remain a mortal just to be with Lois while the whole world was kneeling before Zod! Are any of these older movie references gonna make sense to the tween/teen scene that'll just give this a bad mark just because I'm making fun of their movie? Probably not. If the older scene that likes these books/movies get those references, they'll still give me bad marks for my opinion!Honestly, every book series that gets turned into a movie is being treated like its gonna be the next Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter/James Bond. It's not gonna happen because those books/films have a broader audience than a bunch of teen or grown up (because I know I'll get comments for that) girls and guys (I'm covering my tracks with this one). If you want a real vampire movie, watch the original Dracula, any vampire movie with Christopher Lee and the animated ""The Batman vs. Dracula"" (it may be animated, but you get to see actual people [even a little girl] turn into vampires!

1203796,A2SRT262WG2WH6,B001IDZLCK,Dave,"[0, 0]","I was a lukewarm fan of Stephanie Meyer's book Twilight, and after reading that book, felt that the movie adaptation would be better by default.  I was not wrong.  The problem with the book is that it is written from Bella's limited perspective, and the movie is never 'told' from a perspective, but shown, which is always a larger experience in the visual world.While SM's book is filled with flat boring dialogue, the movie's script is full of catchy catch phrases and very highschool feeling actors.  While SM's book TELLS us a lot of uninteresting information, the movie SHOWS us what is going on.  This allows the whole highschool setting to pervade the overall tone of the movie, and it is a lot more immersive.SM's plot takes a few jolts in the right direction, by creating suspense by creating conflict early on in the story, as opposed to right at the end in the actual book.  This makes the entire story more captivating.  The movie also adds more true highschool moments, and asks more interesting questions like should she become a vampire or shouldn't she, and it has Edward asking this question himself.The only downside (according to my wife and which I agree) is that Edward wasn't cast with too much similarity to the book.  His features are much more sunken, classic vampire looks, rather than the greek statue my wife was expecting.  He just isn't THAT good looking.  His paleness was also not too convincing, as was the case for the rest of the cast.Overall, it was a good movie.

Does Catherine Hardwicke and her designers truly feel that the follicly foolish Cullen's they've created are anyone's idea of hip, cool kids?  That they're somehow aspirational?  Maybe I'm just an old fart (a definite possibility), but I couldn't help chuckling to myself at how clueless these vampire's seem; for wanting to blend in, they've done an awful lot to stand out.  Perhaps the point is that they've overcompensated, that they've gone too far to adapt to what they think the new style is; after all, constantly changing one's fashions over hundreds of years has to be a royal pain in the butt.  If so, this shows a subtlety and cleverness that Hardwicke and her team are lacking in all other aspects of this cheesy, overwrought epic.  To be fair, the leads have been cast very, very well (and some of the supporting characters too -- Hardwicke's BBF Nikki Reed being a notable exception), and they do most of the heavy lifting, admirably so.  But as the film goes on, this seems to be more luck than anything else.  Stewart has a meltdown towards the end that's an embarrassing mess, and one realizes that there's no-one behind the camera to help her get it right.  No wonder Hardwicke was replaced for the second film (by Chris Weitz, who did a glorious job of bringing ""The Golden Compass"" to life.)To be honest, I'm not a fan of the book, so wasn't expecting much.  But I can't believe that a better film maker (one who wasn't gearing her product exclusively to giddy fourteen-year-old girls -- which I'm decidedly not) couldn't have drawn me in with some pacing, atmosphere, tension and/or suspense.  OK, there's not much anyone could have done with vampire baseball (a ridiculous concept that's unbelievably awful in execution), but a gutsier, more imaginative director might have cut the sequence.

1203800,A1CK4J7YRAUQ53,B001IDZLCK,"David Foughty ""DLF""","[1, 2]","To preface this review, I read all four Twilight books in one weekend (last weekend, actually) when I picked the first one up at the airport, and could not put it down. I zipped through the other three and went to the midnight screening on opening day. To say the least, I was captivated by Twilight (and I'm in my 20s...).I was anxious to see the movie because, like so many other people, I felt really invested in Bella and Edward's story. Not only that, but I love the vampire premise - it just never gets old, especially when you put a new spin on it, as Meyer did in her books. The events of each book really ran together for me, so in a way, I felt like a non-Twilighter coming into this film. I really didn't care if the movie deviated from the book - in fact, I was kind of hoping it would, since you can't expect a book to translate directly to the screen. I heard a lot of serious Twilight teens complaining about ""major things"" missing when I left the theater, but I honestly didn't notice any major omissions.Overall, the film was better than I expected (based on previews, I expected it to be extremely cheesy, low-budget, and awkwardly filmed). It definitely grew on me as it went on, especially Pattinson's performance. His introduction was extremely awkward - not sure if that was Hardwicke's fault or Pattinson's acting. In any case, as soon as he settled into his character, he was absolutely captivating. Stewart plays a great brooder, and she certainly did that here. I loved the scenes with her father; in my opinion, these were some of the gems of the movie.The romance between Edward and Bella, which was obviously the crux of the film, was fueled by their chemistry, but not much else. Where was the development?! I really wish Hardwicke or the screenwriter or somebody had taken more time to delve into the roots of their relationship. It all just happened way too fast. I feel like this happened because of the James story, which to me was almost completely unnecessary (yeah, I know, it's a big part of the book and obviously needs to be here). But even so, the film would have been a more moving romance, and probably a more poignant, emotional film, if that cheesy, goofy subplot hadn't existed.Hardwicke dealt exceptionally well with teen angst, which was evident in the high school shots. Unfortunately, she really struggled with the vampire side of things. I have to put most of the blame on the director because the characters were all spot-on, very well-acted and well-cast. I also think a higher budget would have done wonders for this movie, and I'm hoping that becomes a reality for the sequel. The special effects were embarrassingly bad, and nearly ruined the movie.Overall, I enjoyed ""Twilight"" for what it was - a romance that probed the timeless dilemma of wanting what you can't have (and despite Meyer's Mormon beliefs, this whole series is basically a metaphor for sex). It makes for an interesting, compelling story, and I expect more from the sequels, because the potential is certainly there.",5,Really Grew on Me...,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,3040,"['preface', 'review', 'read', 'four', 'Twilight', 'books', 'one', 'weekend', 'last', 'weekend', 'actually', 'when', 'picked', 'first', 'one', 'up', 'airport', 'could', 'not', 'put', 'down', 'zipped', 'other', 'three', 'went', 'midnight', 'screening', 'opening', 'day', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'captivated', 'Twilight', ""'m"", '20s', '.I', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'felt', 'really', 'invested', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'story', 'Not', 'only', 'love', 'vampire', 'premise', 'just', 'never', 'old', 'especially', 'when', 'put', 'new', 'spin', 'Meyer', 'did', 'books', 'events', 'book', 'really', 'ran', 'together', 'so', 'way', 'felt', 'non-Twilighter', 'coming', 'film', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'deviated', 'book', 'fact', 'was', 'kind', 'hoping', 'would', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'book', 'translate', 'directly', 'screen', 'heard', 'lot', 'serious', 'Twilight', 'teens', 'complaining', 'major', 'things', 'missing', 'when', 'left', 'theater', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'major', 'omissions.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'based', 'previews', 'expected', 'be', 'extremely', 'cheesy', 'low-budget', 'awkwardly', 'filmed', 'definitely', 'grew', 'went', 'especially', 'Pattinson', 'performance', 'introduction', 'was', 'extremely', 'awkward', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'Hardwicke', 'fault', 'Pattinson', 'acting', 'case', 'as', 'soon', 'settled', 'character', 'was', 'absolutely', 'captivating', 'Stewart', 'great', 'brooder', 'certainly', 'did', 'here', 'loved', 'scenes', 'father', 'opinion', 'were', 'gems', 'movie.The', 'romance', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'was', 'obviously', 'crux', 'film', 'was', 'fueled', 'chemistry', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Where', 'was', 'development', 'really', 'wish', 'Hardwicke', 'screenwriter', 'somebody', 'had', 'taken', 'more', 'time', 'delve', 'roots', 'relationship', 'just', 'happened', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'feel', 'happened', 'James', 'story', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'yeah', 'know', 'big', 'part', 'book', 'obviously', 'be', 'here', 'even', 'so', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'moving', 'romance', 'probably', 'more', 'poignant', 'emotional', 'film', 'cheesy', 'goofy', 'subplot', 'had', ""n't"", 'existed.Hardwicke', 'dealt', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'teen', 'angst', 'was', 'evident', 'high', 'school', 'shots', 'Unfortunately', 'really', 'struggled', 'vampire', 'side', 'things', 'have', 'put', 'most', 'blame', 'director', 'characters', 'were', 'spot-on', 'very', 'well-acted', 'well-cast', 'also', 'think', 'higher', 'budget', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'wonders', 'movie', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'reality', 'sequel', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'nearly', 'ruined', 'movie.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'Twilight', 'what', 'was', 'romance', 'probed', 'timeless', 'dilemma', 'wanting', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Meyer', 'Mormon', 'beliefs', 'whole', 'series', 'basically', 'metaphor', 'sex', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'story', 'expect', 'more', 'sequels', 'potential', 'certainly', 'there']",N/A

The special effects & make-up were cool, espcially for a smaller budget film. Smaller movie budgets to me arn't bad things because it forces filmakers to get creative.The film had a good plot to work with & was simple adaptation of the book. It gave me a pretty good idea of what the books were like - because i liked the film i became interested in the books and have now read all of them & I am now an offical Twilight fan.BEST OF THE FILM: After reading the books, I loved the fact that the film's climax actually shows the audience a fight between Edward and James rather than Bella getting hit on the head and the scene cuts to her waking up after the fight. But I wished the director would have expanded the part where bella runs away from Alice & Jasper - it was a suspensful part of the book and had more adreinaline. It's also one of my favorite scenes or chapters of the book.WHY SO FUNNY: the occassional campy lines had me and my sister (who came w/ me to the Theater) rolling with laughter. Some of my personal favorites are: ""You're my personal brand of heroin"" and ""Say it! Out loud! Say it!"" and ""You'd better hang on Spider Monkey"" - i'm going to get a T-shirt of this last quote.aslo i cant help but giggle at the famous ""meadow"" scene with the famous quote ""And so the lion fell in love with the Lamb"": it was too funny as i watched Bella inch closer to Edward telling him she trusts hims: I imagined her to be more like a baby back rib dancing in front of his face and then snuggling close to him and saying ""I WUV you!""",3,curious new comer becomes a fan after the film,1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,2203,"['am', 'not', 'teenager', ""'m"", 'not', 'books', 'i', 'knew', 'nothing', 'Twilight', 'prior', 'film', 'other', 'bus', 'stop', 'poster', 'ads', 'briefly', 'overherd', 'radio', 'was', 'vampires', '2', 'days', 'i', 'saw', 'was', 'surprised', 'information', 'immediately', 'became', 'intrigued', 'prayed', 'God', 'supernatural', 'flick', 'would', 'NOT', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'Covenant', 'stupid', 'movie', 'teen', 'wizards', 'who', 'shoot', 'vicious', 'water', 'balloons', 'other', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'waaaaay', 'better', 'Covenant', 'infact', 'i', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'hilarious', '-I', 'fact', 'wasnt', 'too', 'dramatic', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'were', 'cool', 'espcially', 'smaller', 'budget', 'film', 'Smaller', 'movie', 'budgets', 'ar', ""n't"", 'bad', 'things', 'filmakers', 'get', 'creative.The', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'plot', 'work', 'was', 'simple', 'adaptation', 'book', 'gave', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'books', 'were', 'i', 'liked', 'film', 'i', 'became', 'interested', 'books', 'have', 'now', 'read', 'am', 'now', 'offical', 'Twilight', 'fan.BEST', 'THE', 'FILM', 'reading', 'books', 'loved', 'fact', 'film', 'climax', 'actually', 'audience', 'fight', 'Edward', 'James', 'rather', 'Bella', 'getting', 'hit', 'head', 'scene', 'cuts', 'waking', 'up', 'fight', 'wished', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'expanded', 'part', 'where', 'bella', 'away', 'Alice', 'Jasper', 'was', 'suspensful', 'part', 'book', 'had', 'more', 'adreinaline', 'also', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'chapters', 'book.WHY', 'SO', 'FUNNY', 'occassional', 'campy', 'lines', 'had', 'sister', 'who', 'came', 'w/', 'Theater', 'rolling', 'laughter', 'personal', 'favorites', 'are', ""'re"", 'personal', 'brand', 'heroin', 'Say', 'loud', 'Say', ""'d"", 'better', 'hang', 'Spider', 'Monkey', 'i', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'T-shirt', 'last', 'quote.aslo', 'i', 'cant', 'help', 'giggle', 'famous', 'meadow', 'scene', 'famous', 'quote', 'so', 'lion', 'fell', 'love', 'Lamb', 'was', 'too', 'funny', 'i', 'watched', 'Bella', 'inch', 'closer', 'Edward', 'telling', 'hims', 'imagined', 'be', 'more', 'baby', 'back', 'rib', 'dancing', 'front', 'face', 'then', 'snuggling', 'close', 'saying', 'WUV']",N/A

1203811,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001IDZLCK,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 3]","""Twilight"", since its release as a novel in 2005 by Stephanie Meyer, the novel would become a New York Times Best Seller and even Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year.Having released four novels, Summit Entertainment adapted the popular novel to a film and in 2008, was released to critical acclaim, grossing $35.7 million on its opening day and over $376 million worldwide, not including the $83+ million the film has made through DVD and Blu-ray sales.With that being said, I knew nothing about the novels.  In fact, part of my reason for reviewing this blu-ray disc a little late is because I wanted the hype and fanfare to die down, not having to hear it from friends, associates and literally, experience the film for myself and wonder why people are so passionate about ""Twilight"".The first positive for me was to find out that Catherine Hardwicke would direct the film.  Catherine is one of the new wave of directors that has a stylish and cool way of doing things.  From her years as a production designer and art director for many films, what made me appreciate her work is what she did with the film ""Lords of Dogtown"".  When she's passionate for a storyline, she goes all out.And joining with screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg (known for her TV writing work for ""The O.C."", ""Dexter"", etc.), I feel that both women could really do awesome work adapting Meyer's work to film.VIDEO & AUDIO:One thing that came to mind when I started watching ""Twilight"" is seeing the town of Fork, images of the popular ""Twin Peaks"" show came to mind.  With its green vegetation, small town atmosphere and cloudy but rural type of terrain.  But one thing that I enjoyed about ""Twilight"" is its blue tint.The high definition 1080p transfer (2:35:1 aspect ratio) is quite beautiful but the slight hint of blue gives us this mysterious feeling.  How the characters such as the Cullen family with their white and pale look to the close ups of the characters and being able to catch the hint of blood and grime on the fingertips of the nomadic vampires to the skin wrinkles and pores of the characters.  Outdoors, shots are absolutely beautiful and gorgeous mountains that surround the town.Definitely like the use of blacks and one thing that it's important to point out that with the many low light conditions captured on film, the film doesn't exhibit excessive grain.  Overall, the picture quality of ""Twilight"" is absolute beautiful.As for the audio, It was great to have this DTS-HD Master Audio track because of the amount of dialogue, music and overall ambiance of special effects to the sounds of nature, you hear it nicely.Although the film showcases dialogue as its priority, the music is nicely balanced and the special effects and various sounds from Edward preventing the van and hearing the metal squeeze and crunch was quite nice.Audio is front heavy for dialogue but you can expect to see the low levels of your subwoofer being utilized.  So, I was absolutely happy that this Blu-ray had such an awesome, lossless and not overpowering soundtrack.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Twilight"" has a good number of special features, fun commentary and an informative documentary but with a popular film such as ""Twilight"", I can't help but think that there will be another release (perhaps around the time of the second film) that would be jam packed with bonus features.This Blu-ray disc comes with the following:* AUDIO COMMENTARY by Director Catherine Hardwicke, Kristen Stewart and Richard Pattinson - An interesting and fun commentary, as you have Catherine Hardwicke with her laid back style of speaking, Pattinson often joking around and talking about crazy things during the filming and Steward who also have something interesting and fun to say.  If anything, less talk about filmmaking (in a technical sense) but moreso on experiences of the talent and behind-the-scenes information of the film and the different scenes.* MUSIC VIDEOS - The ""Twilight"" soundtrack is one of the most successful film soundtracks and nearly seven months since the film came out in theaters, the soundtrack continues to dominate the Billboard charts.  For this segment, people can watch live concert videos of ""Supermassive Black Hole"" by Muse, ""Decode"" by Paramore and ""Leave Out all the Rest"" by Linkin Park.  This segment is featured in 1080i.* The Adventure Begins: The Journey form Page to Screen - (54:29) If you have a Blu-ray profile 1.1 player, you can rewatch the film and have a picture-in-picture documentary or watch it separately if your Blu-ray player doesn't have PiP capability.  In this documentary, ""Twilight"" creator Stephanie Meyer giving us information on how the novel was adapted to film.  How things started out with a dream and then going into pre-production, casting, how CG was utilized, creating the overall atmosphere and world of the Cullen's and much more.  Overall, a very entertaining and informative documentary featured in 1080p.  Here are the various selections that can be viewed:- the beginning- the partnership: a look at pre-production- the vampires- capturing the action: a look at production- vampire baseball- the final word on the final battle- putting it all together: the magic of post-production* The Comic-Con Phenomenon - (7:58) A very fun featurette with the fans going crazy at the San Diego Comic-Con and clips from the press conference.  It was fun to see everyone together and discuss what they enjoyed about the novel but also to hear the girls going crazy over Robert Pattinson.  The featurette is featured in standard 480p.* EXTENDED SCENES - (9:36) There are five extended scenes with introduction by Director Katherine Hardwicke.  All are featured in 1080p.  Included are:- are people talking about the cullen's again?- james, let's not play with our food.- you don't know how it's tortured me.- a hundred years worth of journals.- don't read charlie's mind.* DELETED SCENES - (5:54) There are five deleted scenes featuring an intro by Director Catherine Hardwicke.  All are featured in 1080p.  Included are:- edward, she's not one of us- that's the first time i dreamt of edward cullen.- bella, your number was up the first day i met you.- she brought him to life.- i love it when men chase me.* THEATRICAL CAMPAIGN - This segment features teaser trailers, trailers and sneak peaks, all in 1080p.  Included are:- sneak peek as seen on `Penelope' dvd- comic-con new york sneak peek- teaser trailer #1- teaster trailer #2- final trailerJUDGMENT CALL:I'm glad that I took the time to wait and watch ""Twilight"".  When it comes to vampire and human relationships, I've always been a stickler for ol' Buffy and Angel.  But I have to admit that I really enjoyed the whole theme of the film.Kristen Stewart has this quirkiness to her character that makes her so believable in her role.  Although, having watched her being interviewed several times, I'm guessing that she's just a person that has her brain working overtime or maybe she's uncomfortably shy or something.  But she brought a uniqueness to the role of Bella and I look forward to seeing more of her.As for Robert Pattinson, obviously the girl magnet.  The cool guy and like Kristen Stewart, I feel that he was well cast for his role as Edward.After watching the film, I just enjoyed the overall setting of the film.  Beautiful lush and green but with that hint of fog or low clouds in the mountainside adds to the whimsical beauty of the film.I also enjoyed the characters.  Sure, it has an essence of some teenage films but when combined with the vampire storyline and overall cool look of the Cullen family which have a degree of coolness with each character, you can't help but be mesmerized and curious of these characters.Katherine Hardwicke has a good eye on action but most of all character development and pacing has always been her strong point and overall, screenplay, cinematography and its musical score are just well-done.Overall, I can help but give this Blu-ray a high recommendation.  Sure, it's not all-out-action or a bloody, gory vampire film.  Nor is it Scooby Doo-ish, Vampire turns on girlfriend ala ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" either.It's a good ol' romantic love story with a dark vampire edge to it.  Well-written, well-directed, well-acted, well-cast and overall gripping and modernly stylish.  The Blu-ray features beautiful visuals and the audio is well done with its DTS-HD MA soundtrack.  There's nothing bad I could say about this release.I highly recommend this film and look forward to the sequel!",5,"The Blu-ray release boasts beautiful visuals, crystal clear audio and enjoyable special features.

1203812,A2IHIKHWCDB0FG,B001IDZLCK,Dexter Manning,"[10, 18]","Fangs. A set of long, sharp ones is almost invariably the first characteristic that comes to mind when we think of vampires -- that and the fact, of course, that they bite. So, it is understandable that a viewer would think similar thoughts when watching ""Twilight,"" a film about those famous blood-suckers. Yet, it turns out that neither the main vampire nor any of the others in this film has those trademark fangs, nor does he really bite. Worse still, the movie itself, in which he is the center of attention, has no metaphorical fangs either, much less anything close to a bite.The picture, a strictly-by-the-book adaptation from Stephenie Meyer's bestselling novel of the same name, is perhaps what it might be like to watch an episode of the television series True Blood tragically reincarnated as a torpid afterschool special. (To be sure, that's by no means a criticism of True Blood, which is tremendously enjoyable first-rate TV.) I have not read any of the original stories myself but, to judge from their wild success and the palpable anticipation of this movie, they must have struck the legions of their captivated fans with heavy doses of suspense, fear, horror, lust, intrigue... You know, the same feelings any vampire tale worth its fangs would evoke. The same ones that, here, are largely missing except for the very briefest of moments.The plot concerns teenage Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) who has just moved from Phoenix to Forks, Washington, a small town perpetually cloaked in clouds of gray. She doesn't fit with her other classmates in her high school at first --driving that big pickup truck of hers doesn't help -- though she soon falls in with a group who soon become her friends. Among other activities, like surfing (under those perpetually gray skies), they enjoy making fun of a particular clan students. Perhaps the clan is such an easy target because of their pale skin. Maybe it's their eccentricity or the fact that they are extremely insular, never traveling or socializing outside their own group. Or, more likely, it could be the fact they're far and away the best-looking, kids in town (and the sexiest, judging from the screams, moans, and whoops of the teenage girls in the theater at the showing I attended).So, it comes as a surprise to Bella that her assigned seat in science class -- of course it would be science class -- is right next to the one of the clan, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), with whom she soon finds herself not only observing class projects together but gradually falling in love, though she doesn't realize at first that he is a 100-year-old vampire. It seems to take her another century to finally learn that fact, and the revelation comes only after Edward answers her questions, responding only after long being evasive about his speed, strength, and really cold skin. A fairly predictable course follows: mutual infatuation; surprised, envious classmates; concerned parents; exotic revelations (Edward never sleeps, but enjoys secretly watching Bella doze; in sunlight, his skin sparkles as if he spent the day rolling in a pool of party glitter); Bella's awkward first meeting with the rest the Cullen clan; breathtaking seduction; and a fight with evil vampires while Bella is in peril. Again, most of this feels too familiar and as if its' been done much better in many other places.The film's most imaginative and genuinely enchanting scene is a baseball game Bella plays with Edward and the Cullens in a clearing in the woods, under a thunderous, lightning-filled sky, the ball -- and the ball players -- moving at surreal speeds. Another spurt of imagination comes when Edward gives Bella a tour of his home, not a dilapidated old mansion from the 19th century, but an impeccable, ultramodern architectural extravagance, with walls of glass, high in the wooded hills.By the time we've started into the final thirty minutes of the two-hour-long endeavor, the movie has long lost the viewer's interest. I doubt, however,  that this film could be saved by merely trimming the running time (or adding a few fangs). There are too many other issues with it. The tone of the film is funnier and more ridiculous than apparently intended due in no small measure to the stilted script by Melissa Rosenberg, Catherine Hardwicke's misguided direction and, most of all, the wooden, emotionless acting of everyone in front of the camera, including all the pretty boys and girls. The special effects are average, less than the exhilerating experience they're meant to be. Earlier in the film, infatuated stares between Bella and Edward occur so frequently and last so long they become more comical than engrossing.Ultimately, the film may be of some mild, passing interest to fans of the novel  but almost certainly not to most others who are unfamiliar with it. It seems existing fans, too, would be let down by this bland reincarnation which, if it truly is as faithful to the book as it is reputed to be, sheds a light on that book that is unflattering indeed. Despite the natural assumption that it would be difficult for a film of this subgenre to achieve such a dubious distinction, this one does: it's a true bore.",1,Twilight: A Review. 1-1/2

1203816,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001IDZLCK,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[21, 26]","Director Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen,"" ""Lords of Dogtown (Unrated Extended Cut),"" and ""The Nativity Story"") has a special affinity with the subject of most of her films; she captures the inner angst of the adolescent from seemingly a personal vantage point that puts each member of her audience right smack in the cauldron of raging hormones, inferiority complexes and the necessity of rebellion that makes up the teen universe no matter what the generation. In her 2008 film ""Twilight"" she departs from her usual sexually explicit world of pubescent temptation and explores a good old-fashioned romance replete with the repressed love imaginings conjured up to perfection by Mormon mother-turned-author in her four young adult vampire novels that have achieved global success. Despite a screenplay that whittles the 500+ page novel to play in a 121 minute format, Hardwicke successfully recreates those special moments of first love that we have all experienced and allows us to remember with fondness that wicked mind-blowing intensity no matter what our age or how long ago.Novel purists may debate the casting of the Cullen vampire family, and the two main characters vehemently, suggesting that the ensemble starring in ""Twilight"" did not exactly meet with personal expectations that have been mind-visualized with fan-fanatic intensification since the debut of the first book in 2005. Nevertheless as a newbie who read ""Twilight"" after viewing the film, I give the two leads a vigorous thumbs-up. As Bella Swan, Kristen Stewart updates the Every-girl teen wannabe-queen who typically transforms herself from awkward nerd hiding behind glasses undiscovered to triumphant mini-skirted magnificence a la ""The Princess Diaries (Full Screen Edition)."" Stewart's Bella knows and accepts her clumsy relative `ugly duckling' status; as a transplant from sunnier Phoenix climes she views her new home with an edgy guardedness that coincides well with the northwest backdrop and her complete lack of regard for grooming herself to become the graceful animal her name suggests. Instead Hardwicke's Bella is defined by realism. Yes, she waxes romantic over Edward's perfection, but she presents herself as a grounded unsmiling girl-woman that epitomizes most of today's teenagers.And if she spends much of her time mooning over mega-hunk Edward Cullen, who in their right minds would blame her? What a combination of male beauty and vulnerability! Robert Pattinson, as the object of her desires, smolders with all the energy of James Dean albeit with a too white layer of pancake make-up, glossed lips and a six-inch high coif that suggests way too much hair gel and morning mirror time. Although we are not privy to all of Bella's internal longings for Edward (as we are with the first person narrative in the novel) the audience quickly grasps the intense chemistry between the two lovers and marvels at their ability to convey a realistic relationship between a 100-year old vampire in the body of a seventeen year old boy and a world weary 21st century girl who doesn't quite understand why such a specimen of male perfection would go wild for her after just one whiff.Combined with the grunge/alternative soundtrack and throbbing half romantic/half sinister score by Carter BurwellTwilight - The Score: Music from the Motion Picture, the scenes between Stewart and Pattinson are well worth the price of admission. Not just for teenagers--I had one sixty-something year old woman exclaim to me, ""Wow! I have never had a man love me like that--that was so romantic it had the hair standing on the back of my neck""--""Twilight"" delivers what women want: Victorian honesty and honor without the game-playing. Hardwicke sashays her characters around passion that sizzles between the two like electric current, rendering the obligatory sexual culmination unnecessary and unwelcome. For once the vertical dance outplays and obliterates the horizontal, making the film a lovely interlude for its intended PG-13 audience and those of us who want something beyond the superficial.Presenting a vampire family without being campy most likely was the most difficult aspect to pull off in this film without making it seem too Harry Potter. Unfortunately, in this regard, Hardwicke (and Stephanie Meyers in the novel) doesn't quite manage to maintain the gravity of the vampire/human interaction during Bella's first time at the old homestead and then again at the over-the-top vampire ballgame. With their Liberace-like glamour and cornball quips, Carlyle and Company are just too easy to spot as being a breed apart. Ah well, the camp succeeds to a degree to dampen the intensity and interject a little humor before the all intensive chase and climatic scenes that lead to the film's conclusion.Bottom line: Catherine Hardwicke's film ""Twilight"" depicts teen love in a modern day ""Rebel Without a Cause (Two-Disc Special Edition)"" with a bite that doesn't quite break the skin and doesn't have too. Pre-teen friendly, this 2 hour story gives teenagers what they want without annoying their parents with a show of too much skin and mature themes that are always unnecessary in a movie geared for the minor set. Despite its vampire theme, the film depicts teen concerns realistically without the usual display of irreverence, superficial materialism and lack of morality that make up the cornerstones of most high school dramas. Thankfully, there are no Disney touches here, only romance of the Heathcliff/CatherineWuthering Heights (Penguin Popular Classics)genre. Can't wait for the next installment.

Though I enjoy romances and vampire stories, I did not think I would enjoy the book (I audiobooked it), and the movie as much as I did. Summit has achieved a marketing monster of astronomical proportions, which is a great accomplishment in and of itself.The PQ and AQ were satisfactory, especially for a small studio. Summit should be commended for deciding to include DTS sound-it works well, especially during the baseball scene. The special features of the disc are worthwhile as well-there were a lot of explanations on how certain scenes were shot, as well as conversations with the author, director, and music selections.Though the acting has been criticized (and it is a bit mechanical in parts), it's necessary to realize that these are relatively unknown actors, attempting to bring to life, an international sensation. Despite a small budget, the atmosphere is effective, and the characters are believable.If you can suspend disbelief and transport yourself back to your teenage years (if you are older), then this is a fun, and exciting ride, which challenges vampire lore, and takes a different approach to the historically ""evil"" characters that vampires typically portray. Worth a look if you're a fan of the genre.

A Drag Queen who does not emit sparkly fabulousness from the core of their being is a very sad thing and should be given a hug.2) David Bowie. Need I say more?Someone needs to explain the why's and wherefore's of this whole ""sparkly vampire"" business to me. I really don't understand it at all. Going out in daylight... OK, Dracula could do it if he were well fed, so why not? But sparkles?Anyway on to the meat of this review... (which will likely get thoroughly ignored as there seems to be so much hype over this flick)As far as I can tell, Twilight has no plot. At all. There aren't any conflicts until the last 20 minutes or so. There isn't any drama. This is a vampire movie with no conflict among the main characters, only teen angst and Bella and Edward mooning over each other. The dialog between Edward and Bella would be better if it were done with semaphore flags. Thank goodness I had rifftrax going during those awkward silences. The really sad part is that neither of them really seems to have any real reason to angst over their boring lives. Nothing's really keeping them apart. The few glimpses of indistinguishable backup high schoolers didn't have anyone telling Bella what a horrible person she was and no one went to torment ""the new girl.""Anything that could be remotely called interesting would have been centered around Bella's sheriff dad and the ""maulings"" (read: vampire attacks) he's investigating. But the script instead goes to focus on Bella and Edward's wangsting.Anyone who thinks of Bella as a Mary Sue, I agree. This is perhaps the worst case of published marysueitis I have ever run across. Everyone likes her. She always gets her way. People drop everything to save her even if they have utterly no interest to do so. To make things worse, I found her to be a horrible character in general. There's one scene where one of the indistinguishable backup high schoolers is asking her out to the prom and she isn't paying the poor bit character the slightest whit of attention, preferring to gaze longingly at Edward in the distance. I'm sorry, but that's just rude and under most circumstances would probably make someone a bit miffed. I don't care if the poor guy is a bit character, I'd rather a small look at any of the their small dramas, because I could at least see that they had things going on in their lives from the tiny glimpses shown in the film.Speaking of small bit characters, the best one is some poor construction or engineering guy in a hard hat who finds himself hunted by the ""OMG bad vampires."" I'll give the redshirt credit, the shadowplay on the screen says that he gave them a fight and with an iota more depth, he would have fought them off. :) Go redshirt, go! I'm told that scene was not in the books. It makes me lose all desire to ever read them.As seems to be the trend for this movie, the villains aren't developed at all. They are clearly ""OMG EVOL!!!1!!"" because they act like, well, normal vampires and because they see Bella as an interesting snack. Were they given more depth or a motive at all, I probably would have started to root for them. As it was, I was bored silly.Aesthetically speaking, the film wasn't terrible, although I could have done with less cool toned lighting. Kirsten Stewart is a pale deadpan enough without the camera making it even more obvious. Also, the soundtrack has a rather pretty piano piece in the middle, supposedly composed by Robert Pattinson. I hope he manages to get himself fired from the sequels before his entire career goes down the drain. He played a good Cedric in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.I wouldn't recommend Twilight to anyone.

1203834,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B001IDZLCK,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 1]","Like Harry Potter and ""Eragon"" and other such younger-reader literary phenomena, Stephanie Meyers' bestselling vampire romance ""Twilight"" has gotten the big-screen treatment.Will its countless fans love it? Undoubtedly. Will the rest of the world love it? Ehhhhhhh... probably not.Basically liking ""Twilight"" all depends on whether the idea of teenage vampire/mortal romances with no sex and lots of longing looks appeal to you. It's essentially a teenage fantasy about finding the Perfect Hot Immortal Coverboy Who Longs For You Alone, and as such, it's neither amazingly good nor hilariously bad -- just sort of blah.On her first day at her new school, klutzy Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is struck by the ash-pale, vaguely incestuous Cullen family -- an especially by the Hawt and Brooding Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Edward doesn't seem to like her much -- but when Bella is nearly killed by a runaway car, he somehow manages to zip across the parking lot and knock away the car.Bella does some speculation about how Edward did this particular trick, throwing off some Superman/Spiderman comparisons. ""But what if I'm not the hero? What if I am the bad guy?"" he asks. Of course Bella believes he could never be, because he's hot. Er, because she trusts him because he's hot. Umm... never mind. Anyway, Bella eventually figures out that he's a vampire-- a ""vegetarian vampire"" with the power to read thoughts... except hers.Despite his fears that he'll hurt her, their smoldering chemistry (and Bella's ""heroin"" smell) draws them into a relationship... at which point, since the plot has had zero non-teenybopper tension, three two-dimensionally evil vampires enter the scene, intent on hunting Bella. The Cullens whisk her away to keep her safe from this trio -- but they have more than one way to find her.The book ""Twilight"" is essentially the eroticized fantasies of a teenage girl, purple of prose and taking itself hilariously seriously. Director Catherine Hardwicke and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg thankfully remove most of the sentimental drippiness and damselly distress, but Hardwicke's ""Twilight"" focuses more on the stars' pretty faces than on their personalities. Or the plot.Hardwicke paints the whole movie in dreary shades of misty grey and blue, which has a certain appropiate visual prettiness. Too bad about the choppy, jerky fight scenes and appalling CGI, including a unintentionally silly ""vampire baseball"" scene. Think supersonic pitching. Add that to some oatmeal-bland dialogue (""This kind of stuff just doesn't exist!"" ""It does in my world""), and you don't exactly have a winner.The biggest problem is the plot: it goes nowhere fast. ""Twilight"" is your basic teenage romance -- angst, whining and OMG-does-he-like-me-does-he-hate-me? -- except that the Hawt Guy is a vampire, and the only real obstacle to their Eternal Luv is that he can't make up his mind about whether to date her or not. This is not terribly riveting as a story, especially since it's glaringly obvious whether they'll get together or not.To make matters worse, the main source of tension is the cliche sex = bloodsucking formula, where Edward is constantly shying away from Bella's virginal neck (what does that imply about sucking blood from animals?). Hardwicke wrings a few pretty moments from the movie -- such as Edward and Bella in the Northwestern pine treetops -- but her skills seem to be stifled. You can only wring so much interest from ""Meet the Vampire Family.""The talented Pattinson is undeniably a beautiful guy, and he has the bad boy thing down to a fine art. Unfortunately Edward doesn't call for much more -- Pattinson broods, smolders and stalks Bella as a sign of how he loves her. Stewart does a flat job as the flat Bella Swan (whose main ambition in life seems to be eternal undeadhood with Eddie-boy), and it's hard to forget that that she's basically playing a self-insert for the masses.Those who adore the works of Stephanie Meyer and dream of eternal love with an Immortal Hottie may find ""Twilight"" a delight, but it's no more than a thin, flat guilty pleasure at best.",2,Sparkly vampires,1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,4110,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Eragon', 'other', 'such', 'younger-reader', 'literary', 'phenomena', 'Stephanie', 'Meyers', 'bestselling', 'vampire', 'romance', 'Twilight', 'gotten', 'big-screen', 'treatment.Will', 'countless', 'fans', 'love', 'Undoubtedly', 'Will', 'rest', 'world', 'love', 'Ehhhhhhh', 'probably', 'not.Basically', 'liking', 'Twilight', 'idea', 'teenage', 'vampire/mortal', 'romances', 'sex', 'lots', 'longing', 'looks', 'appeal', 'essentially', 'teenage', 'fantasy', 'finding', 'Perfect', 'Hot', 'Immortal', 'Coverboy', 'Who', 'Longs', 'Alone', 'such', 'amazingly', 'good', 'hilariously', 'bad', 'just', 'sort', 'blah.On', 'first', 'day', 'new', 'school', 'klutzy', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'struck', 'ash-pale', 'vaguely', 'incestuous', 'Cullen', 'family', 'especially', 'Hawt', 'Brooding', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Edward', ""n't"", 'seem', 'like', 'much', 'when', 'Bella', 'nearly', 'killed', 'runaway', 'car', 'somehow', 'zip', 'parking', 'lot', 'knock', 'away', 'car.Bella', 'speculation', 'how', 'Edward', 'did', 'particular', 'trick', 'throwing', 'off', 'Superman/Spiderman', 'comparisons', 'what', ""'m"", 'not', 'hero', 'What', 'am', 'bad', 'guy', 'course', 'Bella', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'hot', 'Er', 'hot', 'Umm', 'never', 'mind', 'Anyway', 'Bella', 'eventually', 'out', 'vampire', 'vegetarian', 'vampire', 'power', 'read', 'thoughts', 'fears', ""'ll"", 'hurt', 'smoldering', 'chemistry', 'Bella', 'heroin', 'smell', 'relationship', 'point', 'plot', 'had', 'zero', 'non-teenybopper', 'tension', 'three', 'two-dimensionally', 'evil', 'vampires', 'enter', 'scene', 'intent', 'hunting', 'Bella', 'Cullens', 'whisk', 'away', 'keep', 'safe', 'trio', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'find', 'her.The', 'book', 'Twilight', 'essentially', 'eroticized', 'fantasies', 'teenage', 'girl', 'purple', 'prose', 'taking', 'hilariously', 'seriously', 'Director', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'screenwriter', 'Melissa', 'Rosenberg', 'thankfully', 'most', 'sentimental', 'drippiness', 'damselly', 'distress', 'Hardwicke', 'Twilight', 'more', 'stars', 'pretty', 'personalities', 'plot.Hardwicke', 'paints', 'whole', 'movie', 'dreary', 'shades', 'misty', 'grey', 'blue', 'certain', 'appropiate', 'visual', 'prettiness', 'Too', 'bad', 'choppy', 'jerky', 'fight', 'scenes', 'appalling', 'CGI', 'including', 'unintentionally', 'silly', 'vampire', 'baseball', 'scene', 'Think', 'supersonic', 'pitching', 'Add', 'oatmeal-bland', 'dialogue', 'kind', 'stuff', 'just', ""n't"", 'exist', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'winner.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'plot', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'Twilight', 'basic', 'teenage', 'romance', 'angst', 'whining', 'OMG-does-he-like-me-does-he-hate-me', 'Hawt', 'Guy', 'vampire', 'only', 'real', 'obstacle', 'Eternal', 'Luv', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'date', 'not', 'not', 'terribly', 'riveting', 'story', 'especially', 'glaringly', 'obvious', ""'ll"", 'get', 'together', 'not.To', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'main', 'source', 'tension', 'cliche', 'sex', '=', 'bloodsucking', 'formula', 'where', 'Edward', 'constantly', 'shying', 'away', 'Bella', 'virginal', 'neck', 'what', 'imply', 'sucking', 'blood', 'animals', 'Hardwicke', 'few', 'pretty', 'moments', 'movie', 'such', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'Northwestern', 'pine', 'treetops', 'skills', 'seem', 'be', 'stifled', 'can', 'only', 'wring', 'so', 'much', 'interest', 'Meet', 'Vampire', 'Family', 'talented', 'Pattinson', 'undeniably', 'beautiful', 'guy', 'bad', 'boy', 'thing', 'down', 'fine', 'art', 'Unfortunately', 'Edward', ""n't"", 'call', 'much', 'more', 'Pattinson', 'broods', 'smolders', 'stalks', 'Bella', 'sign', 'how', 'Stewart', 'flat', 'job', 'flat', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'main', 'ambition', 'life', 'be', 'eternal', 'undeadhood', 'Eddie-boy', 'hard', 'forget', 'basically', 'playing', 'self-insert', 'masses.Those', 'who', 'adore', 'works', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'dream', 'eternal', 'love', 'Immortal', 'Hottie', 'may', 'find', 'Twilight', 'delight', 'more', 'thin', 'flat', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'best']",N/A

Yet when you see her onscreen, she somehow transforms into this incredibly gorgeous picture of lush innocence and irresistibly vulnerable, natural femininity.  It's impossible to tear your eyes off of her, especially the shots of her in profile and semi-darkness...true here and in ""Adventureland"" (a far less cheesy movie).Well, as far as made-for-pubescent-girls cheesy movies go, ""Twilight"" has many redeeming qualities.  First, we have Kristen Stewart's onscreen gorgeousness.  Second, we have Kristen Stewart's very natural and graceful acting skills---she's no Meryl Streep (not yet) but she's definitely not some boring mediocrity like Sandra Bullock or Katie Holmes.  Third, we have a decent director, cinematographer and film editor who keep the film visually beautiful and well-paced enough to retain viewer interest despite the inherent cheesiness.  Fourth, the rest of the cast is fairly decent, though one or two members of the vampire family really reminded me of the minor-league actors from some cheesy syndicated-cable-TV shows like ""Charmed.""There are a fair number of unintentionally hilarious moments and lines of dialogue in this movie that had me laughing out loud, but they passed quickly and were quite tolerable, since I came in with such low expectations to begin with.

Quickly she learns he's a vampire, lives with a clan that feels the blood of humans is wrong to ingest (vegetarian vampires?!!?), and soon we go through their hopeless romance with some of the worst written and spoken words of romance I've heard since Star Wars Episode Two. At times it's almost unbearable to watch these two have this puppy-love thing going on, flying through trees like Spider-Man and trying to compare which one of them have the least tanned skin. Eventually a subplot of another clan of vampires who are killling locals for their blood creeps in, but sorry folks...they're wimps too. And that's what this movie felt like to me, no bark AND no bite. This is truly like a cartoon aimed at the younger ""tween"" generation with no appeal for the parents who got it for them in the first place. Sets itself up for a ton of possible sequels (blatantly too), but it's best to leave the kids with it in the other room and the rest of us go tune into HBO's True Blood and see the same material done much better.(RedSabbath Rating:5.5/10)",2,One Lost Boy & One Lost Girl Equals One Bone Dry Movie...,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,1870,"['hub-bub', 'latest', 'youth', 'oriented', 'book', 'hitting', 'theatres', 'earlier', 'year', 'had', 'see', 'had', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'hands', 'Unfortunately', 'think', 'do', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'Playing', 'out', 'weak', 'cross', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'CW', 'teenage', 'line-up', 'typical', '00', 'take', 'sensitive', 'vampire', 'who', 'mortal', 'dreams', 'However', 'movies', 'two', 'hour', 'teenage', 'angst', 'lovefest', 'feels', 'eternity', 'said', 'goodbye', 'seventeen', 'years', 'ago', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'who', 'patented', 'constant', 'daze', 'eyes', 'look', 'actually', 'fitting', 'here', 'Bella', 'new', 'girl', 'small', 'town', 'Forks', 'Washington', 'who', 'up', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Edward', 'who', 'own', 'glazed', 'rebel', 'clue', 'stare', 'even', 'away', 'Quickly', 'vampire', 'clan', 'blood', 'humans', 'wrong', 'ingest', 'vegetarian', 'vampires', 'soon', 'go', 'hopeless', 'romance', 'worst', 'written', 'spoken', 'words', 'romance', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'Two', 'times', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'two', 'have', 'puppy-love', 'thing', 'going', 'flying', 'trees', 'Spider-Man', 'trying', 'compare', 'one', 'have', 'least', 'tanned', 'skin', 'Eventually', 'subplot', 'clan', 'vampires', 'who', 'are', 'killling', 'locals', 'blood', 'creeps', 'sorry', 'folks', ""'re"", 'wimps', 'too', 'what', 'movie', 'felt', 'bark', 'bite', 'truly', 'cartoon', 'aimed', 'younger', 'tween', 'generation', 'appeal', 'parents', 'who', 'got', 'first', 'place', 'Sets', 'up', 'ton', 'possible', 'sequels', 'blatantly', 'too', 'best', 'leave', 'kids', 'other', 'room', 'rest', 'go', 'tune', 'HBO', 'True', 'Blood', 'see', 'same', 'material', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'RedSabbath', 'Rating:5.5/10']",N/A

1203859,A2IQGJFF7BBMJV,B001IDZLCK,Geaux Lightly,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***OK, count me in the number that could stand to never see the whole Twilight franchise again. It's everywhere: web ads, bookstores, fricken Nordstrom. It's been very hard to avoid everything Twilight. So it was on Showtime On Demand, it was snowing (Blizzard 2010), and I decided to finally watch.First off, Kristen Stewart's Bella was incredibly deficient in the personality department. Did she have a lobotomy? I mean, granted, it's been 8 yrs since my teen stage (I'm 26), but good grief, her perpetually depressed and moody face bugged me. We had Emo kids in my high school, but even they could crack a joke every now and then. She literally had no presence. In my high school, she would have been the new kid for a day, but nobody would have talked to her bc she looked so depressing. It was hard to believe that there were guys already crushing on her. Why? She wasn't all that nice to anyone, she barely talked, the friends she had, the relationships seemed more one-sided than anything.Next Edward. I will say that RP is a nice looking guy, but all the fangirl (not just teen girls, either) swooning is a real turnoff. Anyway, when Edward first came on screen, I had high hopes, but when he actually spoke, I was like ""um, is he slow?"" It was as if he had a speech impediment. I had to rewind it to hear it again, and then proceed to laugh. Edward was also a bit of a stalker. I guess if I were 14, I would be turned on by his behavior, but being an adult, I'd be concerned about why he was following me places. And don't get me started on how he admitted he likes watching her sleep.Which brings me to another point. I get that the author wrote the novel based on a (obviously Fabio-esquire)dream she had, but she played way fast and loose with the vampire details. Perhaps the fact that the guy in her dream was a vampire was secondary. I literally asked my friend ""OK, are they vampires or some type of animals?"" The pale faces weren't enough. I could not believe that it wasn't clear that they were vamps. Then when I saw they didn't have fangs...WTF!! And they must be the only set of ""vamps"" that don't combust when out in the daylight. The sparkle was SO CHEESY. I know I'm giving spoilers, but 1.I marked the review w/the spoiler tag and 2.if you like vampire-based stories, you will be sorely disappointed. Back to my point, when Bella discovers what Edward is, he gets all serious and they focus on his face, but he reveals no fangs!! WTF! Fangs are so basic to vampires. Then I read a reviewer that says they don't have them? Is this for real? The baseball game...come on. What fun is it if you can just fly and catch the ball. Cheesy. BTW, the whole family structure was a tad creepy. The conflict lasted probably 15 minutes and was over so fast. It's less of a vampire story and more of a teen angst/Degrassi-style movie.And don't get me started on Bella wanting to be turned after her association with Edward nearly gets her killed and she's only known him a couple weeks!!Someone else had it right: they seemed less like vamps and more like supernatural creatures. If they could walk into anywhere uninvited, didn't burst into flames, can't be staked, etc etc, then what makes them scary? Since when are vampires nice? Even back on Buffy, Angel became Angelus and Spike w/his chip still had his bad boy tendencies. More recently, Damon on Vampire Diaries is straight up evil and doesn't make excuses for himself. Stefan, his brother, is also part of this neutered dog trend (like Edward) which is quite ridiculous if they are supposed to be vamps.So watch the film (for free on TV) but keep your expectations low. Just think of it as a teen flick NOT a vampire flick, and you should survive.Before I forget, that bluish-tinted filter that Twilight was filmed in was awful. Just awful. It almost hurt my eyes. Sometimes that adds effect to the film/show, but not when it's that noticeable. It was almost as if it was done to make all the characters seem even more pale and emo.

The first half hour or so of the film plays out much like a mystery, with Bella collecting evidence and putting it together in order to figure out Edward's secret, and it really got me in. After Bella figures out that Edward is a vampire, however, the story loses focus somewhat. The next hour or so of the film is all about Bella learning about what vampires can do, falling in love with Edward and meeting Edward's family. Presumably, all of the material in this section is taken straight from the book (which I haven't read), but there seems to be far too much of it for a movie and it seems to have no real purpose to it. Because there is no apparent direction to this material, the final half hour of the film feels contrived in order to give rise to a showdown at the end of the story. It doesn't naturally flow on from what has gone before it. It is entertaining enough material, and some of the scenes involving the vampires, in particular a scene in which they play baseball, are incredible to watch.

And that is what we get with TWILIGHT - a movie created by screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg from Meyer's novel and directed by Catherine Hardwick that stays pretty much in the 'twilight' tones of the Washington state overcast atmosphere.  The actors are for the most part young newcomers (with the exception of some like Billy Burke as the father of the teenage star) and since they are given little to say or do other than wander around the school or blend into the shadows of the woods it is difficult to ascertain the quality of acting.Kristen Stewart is the monotoned Bella, confused yet lusting after the 'don't come out in the daylight' vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) who is equally attracted to but fearful of revealing his true identity to Bella.  There are of course, in addition to the usual fellow students concentrating on the Prom, two vampire groups (one eats animal flesh, the other the more traditional human blood) and then there are the 'native American Indians who have secrets of ancestry of their own.  We do get to meet the very young lead for the next episode - Taylor Lautner as an interesting variation on the werewolf type, and there are some interesting minor roles for Peter Facinelli and Elizabeth Reaser of TV fame.  This is not a bad film at all and for those who are avoiding it because of all the money spent on PR hoopla, it is an entertaining diversion.  Keep expectations low and you'll probably be surprised.

If you've ever listened to Pres. Bush speak you soon discover that his script writers had to limit his ""monologues"" to simple one line monosyllabic phrases probably to compensate for a lack of retention & capacity. This movie cast the Bush image upon me along with the image of the script writer and director filming this one boring line at a time then splicing the movie together. May also explain why the movie does not flow effortlessly but jumps about like a car on a pot holed road.(2.) Production quality was cheap at best. For example, the pointless and numerous green screen fly-by-wire scenes, amongst the trees in particular, added nothing toward advancing the story or understanding the characters and were performed worse than a cheap Hong Kong martial arts movie. Or, the confrontation scenes between the two vampire groups were obviously copied from similar action movies such as, the much better, Blade series. Oh, the fake snarling on the first meeting between the groups would make a Chihuahua cry.(3.) Acting, to keep it short, was about as charismatic as fog.(4.) What image from the movie do you still retain of the Quileute people? How much of the culture and language can you still recall? You'll probably say a beat-up pickup.

1203869,A1IFCQ7CC2TMFC,B001IDZLCK,gunngirl,"[5, 6]","First I must admit I actually own the 3 disc edition that I bought exclusively at Target that came with a Digital download of the movie. That is a better deal, and for everything included it garners a 5 star rating from me. This review is really a second opinion of the movie and the DVD itself. Upon rewatching I was a bit horrified to notice so much of the incredibly bad acting that I didn't really notice the first time. Granted it was bad, but the initial meeting of Bella and Edward was atrocious. Pattison wasn't ""Wooden"" as people have said, just over acted and awkward. The fact that he is resisting his killing urges and in physical pain is not played well on screen as it is in the book and sadly, we had more meetings in the book to show just how long she had to endure him before they actually talked. Honestly, there is nothing from Edward that should have her infatuated early on, as he goes back and forth from conversing with her to flat out being rude and hostile. Special effects are a JOKE and I hope Myers gets a better budget for ""New Moon"" They look like something from an SNL sketch. I still believe casting was spot on (ESPECIALLY the Cullens), even down to weird, wide eyed Jasper--until we get to James. The most atrocious thing in the movie. I also didn't like the choice of Eric or Mike either, but the soon grow on you.  Everyone else was spot on, especially Charlie. And I adore Alice. Who wouldn't?The extras are the icing on the cake. Commentary is great and funny, and thankfully includes Pattison and Stewart and the 3 disc includes music from the soundtrack. There are loads of stuff from interviews, productions (very good!) deleted scenes (a few that should have been in the movie) and more, most are decent in length (up to an hour) and should comfort any uber Twilight fan. I'm no superfan, but I like vampires and vampire love stories and I want to like Bella and Edward. Both the books and this movie have hits and misses. This is a guilty pleasure and for particular tastes, even hardcore vampire fans may turn away. It has neither strong violence or dark themes or undertones. There are no real character studies to be had; (even if we do know how tortured Edward is at being a ""monster"") no redemption seeking, no saving of the world. If Bella wasn't hellbent on being turned I'd say it'd be a tragic love story, but it's almost not that either. It's just a love story between a vampire and a human.Translation from page to screen was almost like it went through the shredder first and they used what came out the other side. There is potential (I think) for the writing and acting to get better as this series continues to movies. I'd like to see Pattison and Stewart get stronger and better and bring the chemistry! It wasn't at first, but by the end I think they managed to make a good connection with each other, and make a believable couple. Afterall,  these are supposed to be two lovers with destinies, who may not have a happy ending. While the books and stories have already been written, that doesn't mean the movies still don't have a chance. This movie suffered from bad acting and some bad writing--but was saved by the growing sexiness of Bella and Edward and much of them together.

I recall she mentioned something about this being love story first. First off I will watch most any vampire flick, the more action, blood and gore the better.This is not even a vampire movie at all, just a sappy teen romance flick about two characters that clearly can't seem to breathe without each other. Although, as a capitalist I will have to give props to the author of these books, as she (these books HAVE to have been created and written by a woman) clearly found a huge female teen audience. That being said, it's amazing how you can dangle trash like this in front of kids and they come running to it like moths to a flame.When I saw this movie and watched the way the two primary characters looked at each other I could not figure out what the deal was. The leading man looked like he had just eaten bad sushi or something and the way the leading lady looked at the guy was nearly as bad. She looked at him like he was last cheeseburger she was going to get the chance to inhale before she took a forced 100 year journey into deep outer space.So I patiently waited for some fangs, blood, violence or anything that was remotely interesting and juicy but nothing really happened except the two lead actors perpetually looking at and longing for each other (described in the prior paragraph). I almost forgot to mention that there theater was fully loaded with teenage girls who just kept saying things like ""there he is"" and ""om my god he is so beautiful"" and ""I can't believe how perfect he is"" etc...I gave this movie two stars only for the reason that the experience in going to the movies to see this kooky flick with a bunch of teeny bopping 'Twilighters' just made me appreciate my home vampire movie collection that much more. This movie is good for two things: 1) Watching this will surely remind real vampire movie fans how thankful they are that movies like Horror of Dracula, Blade, Underworld etc... actually got made. I could see how this trash could absolutely supplant real vampire movies just by the sheer box office sensation this whole Twilight craze created. 2) Any bad DVD can serve as a coaster in a pinch.As for me, I could pick out my 10th favorite Hammer vampire flick made 40 years ago and know that it is a million times better than Twilight.",2,Two stars only because it's like a train wreck you can't turn away from...,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,2442,"['went', 'see', 'movie', 'X-GF', 'warned', 'hubbub', 'books', 'teen', 'crowd', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'regular', 'vampire', 'story', 'recall', 'mentioned', 'something', 'being', 'love', 'story', 'first', 'First', 'will', 'watch', 'most', 'vampire', 'flick', 'more', 'action', 'blood', 'gore', 'better.This', 'not', 'even', 'vampire', 'movie', 'just', 'sappy', 'teen', 'romance', 'flick', 'two', 'characters', 'clearly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'breathe', 'other', 'capitalist', 'will', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'author', 'books', 'books', 'HAVE', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'written', 'woman', 'clearly', 'found', 'huge', 'female', 'teen', 'audience', 'being', 'said', 'amazing', 'how', 'can', 'dangle', 'trash', 'front', 'kids', 'come', 'running', 'moths', 'flame.When', 'saw', 'movie', 'watched', 'way', 'two', 'primary', 'characters', 'looked', 'other', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'deal', 'was', 'leading', 'man', 'looked', 'had', 'just', 'eaten', 'bad', 'sushi', 'something', 'way', 'leading', 'lady', 'looked', 'guy', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'looked', 'was', 'last', 'cheeseburger', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'chance', 'inhale', 'took', 'forced', '100', 'year', 'journey', 'deep', 'outer', 'space.So', 'patiently', 'waited', 'fangs', 'blood', 'violence', 'anything', 'was', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'juicy', 'nothing', 'really', 'happened', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'perpetually', 'looking', 'longing', 'other', 'described', 'prior', 'paragraph', 'almost', 'forgot', 'mention', 'theater', 'was', 'fully', 'loaded', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'just', 'kept', 'saying', 'things', 'om', 'god', 'so', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'perfect', 'etc', 'gave', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'only', 'reason', 'experience', 'going', 'movies', 'see', 'kooky', 'flick', 'bunch', 'teeny', 'bopping', ""'Twilighters"", 'just', 'made', 'appreciate', 'home', 'vampire', 'movie', 'collection', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'good', 'two', 'things', '1', 'Watching', 'will', 'surely', 'remind', 'real', 'vampire', 'movie', 'how', 'thankful', 'are', 'movies', 'Horror', 'Dracula', 'Blade', 'Underworld', 'etc', 'actually', 'got', 'made', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'trash', 'could', 'absolutely', 'supplant', 'real', 'vampire', 'movies', 'just', 'sheer', 'box', 'office', 'sensation', 'whole', 'Twilight', 'craze', 'created', '2', 'bad', 'DVD', 'can', 'serve', 'coaster', 'pinch.As', 'could', 'pick', 'out', '10th', 'favorite', 'Hammer', 'vampire', 'flick', 'made', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'know', 'million', 'times', 'better', 'Twilight']",N/A

I began by reading the book... or, attempting to. I ended up flipping through it, putting it aside, and watching the movie instead.This movie sucks all intelligence out of you, drains your faith in modern acting, and yet makes you want to watch it all because it's ""so bad, it's good"". The monotonous delivery of Bella's lines can make one crack up at even the most dramatic scenes; Edward resembles a manic-depressive pedophile whenever he's anywhere near Bella; and Taylor Lautner's Jacob, as little as he appears, is one of the only good performances in the film (along with, occasionally, Charlie). Still, the badness of it all makes it enjoyable to watch, although it doesn't get much more than a two-star rating from me.One of the worst parts, however, was when Edward steps out into the sunlight. Not only does he glitter as if he were wearing too much sparkly lotion, there are SOUND EFFECTS accompanying this. As if the image weren't bad enough, now sparkles have noises.Then, suddenly, even though Edward is rude, condescending, brooding, and moping ninety percent of the time, Bella falls ""in love"" with him. No build-up, no exposition, just one moment he's threatening her and backing her against a rock wall, and the next she's crazy about him. The only thing I can think is that this girl has serious issues, because after the first five or six times of being glared at and threatened, I'd have been GONE.Did I mention that this film has no plot? It feels disjointed. Pretty scenery and shots of moping, pale-skinned boys do not a coherent story make.In conclusion, the film is truly ""so bad, it's good"" and a good way to waste two hours of your life.

If you only want to watch the movie itself and you are not into extras, of course this would not be for you.  For all of you who do like having, owning, seeing every aspect of these films, it is far worth paying the extra to own this, even if you own the 2 disc that was more readily available when the DVD first came out, it is worth the money to get this 3 disc edition.Not only are there plenty of extra interview materials, but there are extra scenes not included with the 2 disc.  Remember the infamous Biology scene where Edward seems repulsed by Bella?  Imagine if he suddenly attacked her from behind and drug her from her seat, biting her and doing what he so desperately wanted to do.  Well, that was an alternate idea for that scene, and you'll get to see it on the 3rd disc.Maybe most importantly, we feel it was a horrible idea to change directors, feeling Catherine Hardwicke had done her homework and by far had the best grasp on the romance of the books and film and the subsequent directors have done a horrible job, getting away from the romance and changing the films into an action series.  Like Titanic, it's a romance series at heart.  While the boat sinking was a big part of Titanic, it would not have been nearly the hit it was without the well told romance between the main characters.  Since changing directors, the series has greatly gone down hill due to forgetting that the romance is the true basis of the series.Having realized we were not going to enjoy the subsequent films as much as the original, we have made a point to collect as much as possible from the original film.

Lemme tell ya! MOST of the love stories we're subjected to these days consist of some cheap floosie getting stuck to somebody's mouth and hopping in their pants ASAP before the characters know each others' names good. That's most of the male dominated moviedom. THIS movie, ""Twilight""; written by a woman; screenplay by a woman; and directed by a woman is a refreshing exception. Taking it that the readers of this review will or may have already seen this movie, just notice that Edward COURTS her (Bella). He takes her into the treetops and on his back out into woods...but doesn't do anything to her. He plays the piano for her and they just talk and enjoy each other's company. BOOORRRRIIINNNG, if you're a man, I know. But OOO LA LA  and ""Yeeessss!"" for US who are women! And just near the last third of the movie...HE kisses HER. Lightly. It's not HER who can't wait to suck slurp out of his face and lick out of his mouth like a call girl as is what we're normally subjected to. It's nice. And if you keep with the series it isn't until movie No. 3, ""Twilight Eclipse"" that they do a tad bit of smooching. Oh - the REST of the movie. Yes, mild to mid excitement as Bella has to be rescued from James the Tracker vampire. Every single rating of this movie on the station networks always give the Twilight movies only Two Stars. But there is something at the core of this the first ""Twilight"" that reaches into the soul of us female viewers, giving us something we've long since not been exposed to since the films of the '40's and so on. This Twilight  imprints something on us, you could say ""Jacob-style""! that satisfies a portion of our hearts no longer acknowledged.  Plus the fact that there is the excitement from the tension in that Edward IS a vampire who's told Bella he's killed people before. And she simply tells him while they are alone, ""I'm not afraid of you. I trust you."" Bella's character reminds me a lot of Dorothy Gale of Kansas, looks a little like her too. Here you have an innocent young girl who makes the acquaintence of and becomes fast friends with these supernatural / fantastic creatures...""And you know some of them aren't very nice - but most of them are GREAT!"" The studios have learned that despite whatever techniques or so are utilized however they may be - there is a core audience, a niche out there that apparently has ITS hunger and yearning satisfied by this ""Twilight"" movie and the following series.

1203896,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001IDZLCK,Jason,"[2, 7]","Teenage girl, Bella (Stewart), moves to a small town in the Washington wilderness.  Along with the trees, the town has stereotypical American Indians and a group of odd, incestuous, chalky white teenagers.  Naturally, Bella has a ""connection"" with the most morbidly translucent of the outcasts, big haired Edward (Pattinson) - think poor man's Jason Priestley with milky jaundice.  In a real high school, this kid with the complexion of a rabbit carrying a paper plate in a snowstorm would have been perpetually sent to the nurse's office.  At the very least a responsible teacher would have suspected anemia, maybe even a possible kidney disease, and he would have never met Bella.  I digress.Essentially, this is an attempted tale of teenage love.  It's not like the allure a vampire possesses is really the cause of the relationship between Bella and Edward - it's because this dude is a predator, and I'm not talking about the vampire thing; I'm talkingTo Catch a Predator.  The simple fact is that one of the teenagers is a vampire, and over 400 years old; therefore, he's not a teenager.  In most states that's illegal, but in this movie it's sweeping romance.  Whatever.As for the discovery of a vampire, it's childish at best.  Somehow Bella dons her Nancy Drew hat and uncovers what others can inexplicably not see: Edward is a vampire.  Congrats.  You took off Clark Kent's glasses.Unfortunate for all involved in this movie's creation, the romance is non-existent and the chemistry fails.  The complete absence of character development is probably the cause.  If this is going to be a teenage romance vampire flick (in that order), then the romance part needs to have substance.  Flying through the trees and a few extended muted montages do not constitute a romance.The bad acting, especially by Stewart, and the incessant blank stares between Bella and Edward are the definition of ennui.  The most shocking aspect of this movie, however, is the outright slap in the face delivered to both the fans and genre of vampire movies.  To summarize:-Vampires definitely don't sparkle when in the sun.-Vampires' toxin can't be sucked back out.-Vampires should have fangs.-Vampires don't change colors and get darker as a movie progresses.-A human can't sneak away from vampires in the next room - especially one who can see the future - when considering their heightened hearing, as well as the ability to smell a human's blood from across a field in the rain (as made clear in the preposterous baseball scene).-If vampire eyes do change color it's a new one on me, but I'm willing to give it a pass.  Please explain why, or leave it out of the inane dialogue.Admittedly, I'm definitely not the target audience for Twilight.  The majority of fans are raving 13-year old, emotional girls.  I'm not saying you have to be one to enjoy the books or the movies, but to truly enjoy this movie, it sure helps.",2,Staring Contest...GO!,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2907,"['Teenage', 'girl', 'Bella', 'Stewart', 'small', 'town', 'Washington', 'wilderness', 'trees', 'town', 'stereotypical', 'American', 'Indians', 'group', 'odd', 'incestuous', 'chalky', 'white', 'teenagers', 'Naturally', 'Bella', 'connection', 'most', 'morbidly', 'translucent', 'outcasts', 'big', 'haired', 'Edward', 'Pattinson', 'think', 'poor', 'man', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'milky', 'jaundice', 'real', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'complexion', 'rabbit', 'carrying', 'paper', 'plate', 'snowstorm', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perpetually', 'sent', 'nurse', 'office', 'very', 'least', 'responsible', 'teacher', 'would', 'have', 'suspected', 'anemia', 'maybe', 'even', 'possible', 'kidney', 'disease', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'Bella', 'digress.Essentially', 'attempted', 'tale', 'teenage', 'love', 'not', 'allure', 'vampire', 'really', 'cause', 'relationship', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'dude', 'predator', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'vampire', 'thing', ""'m"", 'talkingTo', 'Catch', 'Predator', 'simple', 'fact', 'one', 'teenagers', 'vampire', '400', 'years', 'old', 'therefore', 'not', 'teenager', 'most', 'states', 'illegal', 'movie', 'sweeping', 'romance', 'Whatever.As', 'discovery', 'vampire', 'childish', 'best', 'Somehow', 'Bella', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'hat', 'uncovers', 'what', 'others', 'can', 'inexplicably', 'not', 'see', 'Edward', 'vampire', 'Congrats', 'took', 'off', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'glasses.Unfortunate', 'involved', 'movie', 'creation', 'romance', 'non-existent', 'chemistry', 'complete', 'absence', 'character', 'development', 'probably', 'cause', 'going', 'be', 'teenage', 'romance', 'vampire', 'flick', 'order', 'then', 'romance', 'part', 'have', 'substance', 'Flying', 'trees', 'few', 'extended', 'muted', 'montages', 'do', 'not', 'constitute', 'romance.The', 'bad', 'acting', 'especially', 'Stewart', 'incessant', 'blank', 'stares', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'are', 'definition', 'ennui', 'most', 'shocking', 'aspect', 'movie', 'however', 'outright', 'slap', 'face', 'delivered', 'fans', 'genre', 'vampire', 'movies', 'summarize', '-Vampires', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'sparkle', 'when', 'sun.-Vampires', 'toxin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sucked', 'back', 'out.-Vampires', 'should', 'have', 'fangs.-Vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'colors', 'get', 'darker', 'movie', 'progresses.-A', 'human', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sneak', 'away', 'vampires', 'next', 'room', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'when', 'considering', 'heightened', 'hearing', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'smell', 'human', 'blood', 'field', 'rain', 'made', 'clear', 'preposterous', 'baseball', 'scene', '.-If', 'vampire', 'eyes', 'do', 'change', 'color', 'new', 'one', ""'m"", 'willing', 'give', 'pass', 'Please', 'explain', 'why', 'leave', 'inane', 'dialogue.Admittedly', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'not', 'target', 'audience', 'Twilight', 'majority', 'fans', 'are', 'raving', '13-year', 'old', 'emotional', 'girls', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'have', 'be', 'one', 'enjoy', 'books', 'movies', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'sure']",N/A

There's The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Rocky, Patton, Star Wars, The Magnificent Seven, Indiana Jones... And Twilight.  There it sits.  Being adored by hundreds of thousands of teenagers all over the world, and for what?  The acting is certainly sub-par, the directing sucks and the script is even worse.  Yet people gush over it the minute you bring it up.  WHY?!The only redeemable value I found in this movie is the soundtrack and the score.  Though the fact that it's 1 down and only 3 more to go until the hysteria is over doesn't exactly hurt either...  I guess the movie would have been better had the director not taken out half of what made the book halfway decent (I emphasize HALFWAY!); which she did, stupidly.  Another thing that would be nice is if Robert would learn how to open his damn mouth when he speaks!  Half of the time, you can't understand what on earth he is saying.  And Kristen needs to learn to shut her mouth instead of leaving it gaping open all of the time.  Maybe she's trying to make up for the fact that Robert never seems to open his, who knows.I guess my review boils down to this: Exceptionally bad movie, bad acting, bad script-writing, bad plot, bad directing, and a bad book.

1203900,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B001IDZLCK,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 1]","I have never seen a movie geared more toward girls of the age between 15 and 20 Something.  This is a ridiculously glamorized vampire story, one with a plot that is not very unfamiliar.  The problem is that everyone wants their own little twist on vampires, but there are some lines that shouldn't be crossed.In Twilight a young teenage girl named Bella moves to a small Washington state town to live with her father because her mother wants to travel the country with her stepfather who is a minor league baseball player.  When she gets there the stereotypical interactions happen but with different results.  She has a quiet relationship with her father, but is not disrespectful.  She is the new girl at school but everyone is very welcoming to her.  She meets Edward, who comes off as strange and rude, but eventually starts to win her over.  When Bella is saved by Edward from being crushed between cars in an accident, she realizes there has to be more to him.  Taking a few other cues from rumor and observation, she discovers he is a vampire and confronts him with it.Now this is where it gets weird, and any fan of vampire themed shows and movies will be scratching their head.  When Bella tells Edward she knows he's a vampire, he doesn't threaten her, but instead opens up to her.  He states that he and his family are like vegetarian vampires, because they don't feed on humans, they only drink animal blood.  What?  Ok, creative license, I can deal with that.  Then he proceeds to tell her that she needs to see him in the sunlight.  Whisking her up to the top of a hill, he steps into the sun.  I was expecting him to sizzle like an egg in summer on the black pavement of an Arizona highway.  But no.  He glistened.  That's right; GLISTENED!  At this point the movie lost me.  Creative license is one thing, but to change the mythos of vampires to make them look prettier is just getting ridiculous.  They don't even try to state any alternative to the legend that vampires burst into flames when stepping into the sun.As I trudged through the rest of the movie my wife stated there was a lot of sexual tension between Bella and Edward.  I didn't see it.  So that's when I realized that this movie was for the female gender so they can take their boyfriends to something that seems cool at first, but in the end will be unsatisfactory for them.  Trust me, they would rather see Blade or Lost Boys.I believe the young (female) author of the book this movie is based on was probably living out some fantasy of her own in that publication.

But then as soon as I saw the actors they picked for the movie I knew it was going to suck. But I held out a shred of hope that these actors would surprise me. But unfortunately no they did not. Stephenie Meyer was supposed to protect her work and she definitely did not do that.First of all the acting sucked big time. It was all very dramatic and dark. Bella may not be the perkiest character in the world but I did not envision her as the whiny little brat she is portrayed as. And Edward, although he is attractive he is also a jerk through the first half of the movie. The acting is very forced and way to teen drama for me. I was 23 when I read Twilight and I still loved it. But it was more like a made for tv movie then a feature film. The rest of the cast is forgettable which is unfortunate. Jacob could be good if he had been giving more then five or six lines.Second, they rushed so much of the story that someone who has not read the novel probably would have no idea how certain things came about. For example how does Bella fall in love with Edward so fast after him being such a jerk for so long? They never truly explain why his eyes change color. Then they added all the killings from Laurent, Victoria and James. Those were never mentioned in the book. Also the climbing of the trees never occurred. Just theatrical special effects that really did nothing to add to the story. They may as well have thrown some fangs on the vamps. Then the line towards the end where Edward says he left Bella alone for a few moments and the wolves descend. Ha ha ha. Also they left out the science lab scene where Bella nearly faints. I think that was a pretty informative scene that they should not have left out. Then all the time they spent talking during lunch was cut down dramatically. I realize it's a movie and they can't include everything but if they had left out some of the new crap they would have had time to include more of the original story.I am just so disappointed in this film. I really had hoped that it would be great. I hate the actors they  picked, I hated the acting, the script. The only really good thing about the film was the scenery. Washington is a beautiful state and they showed that nicely. But other then that I would not recommend seeing this movie. And definitely do not buy it without seeing it first.

This film occupies a prominent place on my list of Crappy Movies You Can't Stop Watching, right up there with Avatar.In fact, Twilight and Avatar share come characteristics in common: gorgeous scenery, vomitous dialogue, mediocre acting and a ridiculous story line. Sparkly vampires, give me a break.  Twilight is supposed to be a romance between a human (Bella Swan, played by Kristen Stewart) and a vampire who wishes he wasn't (Edward Cullen, played by Robert Pattinson) and it's one of the silliest films ever to come out of Hollywood.  But dammit, it's fun.  There are several things I actually liked about it:1) Edward and the Cullens.  Socialized vampires, yeah, right.  Bram Stoker would be turning back-flips in his grave.  But the Cullens, especially Dr. Cullen and perky little Alice, are curiously appealing.  They're a family.  They have feelings, hopes, failings, just like anyone else.  And Robert Pattinson, whom I fell head over heels in love with as Cedric Diggory in the fourth Harry Potter movie, is an impossibly gorgeous hunk.  Never mind that his acting skills are uncertain at best, I could watch this guy all day.  And unlike so many Hollywood hunks, he's never stuck on his own good looks, which is what makes him so charming to watch.2) Billy Burke as Bella's single dad, trying to be a good dad to a teenage girl and not having a clue as to how to go about doing that.  He steals every single scene he is in.3) The development of the relationship between Bella and Edward is actually done  very well, and their first meeting in a bio class is priceless.  He is intoxicated by her human scent and reacts with a wave of nausea that sends him bolting out of the classroom as if he had to make it to the loo in time to unload his lunch.  Thoroughly perplexed, she sniffs at her sweater as if she is wondering if she forgot to put on her Rite Guard that morning.  But as hard as he tries, he can't stay away from her.  They fall hopelessly in love, even while he fears he won't be able to control his lust for her blood and even though she realizes that she may end up as his next meal.  It's love and it snares them both until it's impossible for either to escape.The biggest jarring note in ""Twilight"", besides the whole ridiculous premise, is Kristen Stewart as Bella; I kept wondering what in the world Edward saw in her in the first place.  She's just blah.  But the movie has its own irresistible charm that catches us up in it and makes you want to watch it over and over.  It's campy, cheesy fun and doesn't pretend to be anything else.

I haven't read any of the books but most certainly will after watching this movie.  Teen love is so real and teen love hurts like no other.  Bella is a strong girl and is so in love with one of the Cullen vampires.  Cullen tried to stay away from her because he knew how he would complicate her life but Bella had other plans for their relationship.  Bella's relationship with the Cullens will only put her life in danger and possibly damage the relationship with her best friend.  Is it worth it?  You bet.  Bella isn't going anywhere for now but I can see decisions having to be made soon.  I can't wait to read the books and watch the next movie to be released in November. I strongly suggest watching the movie first because movies have a tendancy to not hold up to a book's reputation.

She meets some new friends including secret werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner)and Jasper (Jackson Rathborn) as she is getting use to her new home away from her mother. One day she spots a handsome 17 year old male named Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison) who she falls for as well as he falls for her, he even introduces her to his bizarre pale white like Michael Jackson family called The Cullens (Ashley Greene, Peter Facinellim, Elizabeth Reasner Kellan Lutz) where they act strange. Later on she realizes that he's a vampire for real but a different one as he belongs to a race of bloodsuckers that are part vegetarian when human but when vampire they drink blood of animals and humans, they also shine in the sun without burning due to their hard diamond skin and have eyes that make them look different in people. It seems three rival vampires named Laurent (Edo Gathegi), James (Cam Gianadet) and sexy Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre) want to make a meal of Bella but not for long.Highly entertaining supernatural horror love story fantasy flick based on the widely popular ""Twilight"" books from Stephanie Meyers. This is one of those love them, like them or hate them movies as well as the books are in that category but i would consider this a pure guilty pleasure from start since i like both being a straight 27 year old male. Some say this is aimed at teenagers and women but i don't think so, this works quite well in mixing horror with fantasy and adolescent love all rolled into one. It's a very interesting take on vampire mythology though it does have some flaws like probably one of the dumbest as a vampire can sparkle during the sunlight, i mean OK we get it! their skin are as hard as diamonds, no need to have it literal that they came out of a diamond mining facility. There is some foxy female vampires for the guys out there like Rachelle Lefevre who is just a babe as she can drain my bloody anytime and some action in places with an imaginative baseball playing sequence to show how strong a vampire could be. It's nowhere near as great as ""Titanic"" or ""Ghost"" when it comes to big screen love stories but it's worth watching.This Blu-Ray shows the film in a fantastic presentation of quality sound and theatrical clear quality picture.

This movie is unintentionally funny.  I found myself laughing most of the movie.  This movie is an insult to classic vampire stories, their authors, and classic vampire movies as a whole.

Everyone (not just the vampires) looked like they were about to die from some sort of plague.Add to that that the main theme of the movie was that a girl falls in love with someone who could lose control and kill her at any second.  So, she meets the guy's family and finds herself in the midst of a whole bunch of people who could lose control and kill her at any second.  And then, while she's hanging out with them, a bunch of other vampires show up who are more than happy to lose control and kill her.  So the killers she prefers to hang out with now have to fight back their own desires to kill her as well as a whole bunch of other killers as well.  Hey Ophelia, buy a bunch of garlic and find yourself a new boyfriend.I was laughing OUT LOUD during some of the most serious scenes of the movie.  Why is this movie famous?  Why are people watching it?For the record, that's just the critique on the quality of the movie.  How about a critique of it's morality?The young girl placed herself in an extremely dangerous set of circumstances and the one thing that she should have done (talk about it with her parents) is the one thing that she decided was the logical thing to NOT do.

Her books have such well developed characters, an extremely interesting history of the vampires and great stories.  Unfortunately you will find none of this in the movie ""Twilight.""In this movie a vampire (Edward) and a human (Bella) fall in love while a group of nomadic vampires kill people in Washington State.  The story just slowly drags along developing this love story where the two go from friendly greetings to falling for each other in about a day.  Plus it's not clear whether they are really in love or if Bella is just attracted to Edward's scent.  Then it finally picks up the pace when Edward and his family have a confrontation with the other vampires.  After that there's a fight scene between Jason and Edward, Jason is killed and the movie ends shortly after.I can see how this movie can appeal to teenage girls who think the two leads are attractive.

1203929,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001IDZLCK,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 8]","The Twilight Saga is unavoidable in both film and book form. The books, which I've never read, were bestsellers and the recent release of ""New Moon,"" the film is breaking records. Teenage girls are absolutely gaga for the star Robert Pattinson and it finally intrigued me enough to watch this film. I do have a slightly biased opinion as the entire premise of the film seemed ludicrous to me, but I found a glimmer of hope in the film's director Catherine Hardwicke, who was responsible for the very honest look at teenagers with the film ""Thirteen.""What really surprised me about this film is that it doesn't have much of a plot. Kristen Stewart plays Isabella ""Bella"" Swan, who moves from Arizona to Forks, Washington to stay with her father (Billy Burke). Bella inexplicably begins school moments after arriving in Forks and discovers The Cullen's, a group of mysterious foster kids from Alaska. Even more mysterious and intriguing, to her and the rest of the student body, is Edward Cullen (Pattinson), a quiet, pale, reserved 17-year-old. Bella starts to notice the Cullen's are more than just a little different and when Edward stops a van from running her over, she realizes that he may not even be human...99% of the world knows that he's a vampire, but not a vampire of the typical, blood-sucking variety. The Cullen's are ""vegetarian"" vampires who only snack on the blood of animals. There's a story here, obviously but nothing really happens in it.Almost everything here is underwritten, characters and plot included. The characterization is particularly hollow and calling the characters ""characters,"" is inaccurate; these are names with pretty faces attached to them. We're talking about a film here with an uneventful plot and characters completely void of depth. Twilight is supposed to be a supernatural love story geared towards a teenage demographic, but where's the emotion or poignancy that a love story needs in order to work as one? It's certainly not here. The dialogue in this movie is so melodramatic, I almost felt nauseous. The conversations between Bella and Edward are particularly embarrassing to watch. This does not sound like the ""Romeo & Juliet"" of the 21st Century, but the banter of two prepubescent children.  A quick example; ""Beautiful? This is the skin of a killer, Bella.""As for the performances, no one seems to be putting any effort into them. Pattinson looks uncomfortable and his facial expressions, as well as his delivery of the film's dialogue sound pain fully forced. I do believe Hardwicke is a talented director, but she made a lot of poor creative choices here starting with her decision to direct such a poorly written script in the first place. One of her most annoying directorial decisions was her overuse of the slow-motion to illustrate the anxiety of a character. I can say only one positive thing about the film's production value and that is the somber, gray color palette utilized by the film's cinematographer...It could've been really effective if the tone of the overall film had been altered. Anyone who doesn't agree with what I'm saying about the film's poor quality need look no further than the baseball scene. How horribly executed can a scene be? The acting, the dialogue, the choice of music, Pattinson's snarl, and the cinematography are so bad it's embarrassing. Finally, this scene has no relevance to the plot of the film. It's muddled, meandering filler slipped into the film as an excuse to bring the character's to a different conflict in the story. If I was not aware of the inescapable Twilight frenzy, I would swear this film was a direct-to-DVD release; no one with a knowledge or appreciation of American cinema would call Twilight a good movie.Quite frankly, watching Twilight was like watching a high-school play written by a socially inept teenager. Obviously, my opinion isn't going to affect the success of the series. Twilight is one of those things that strikes some chord with young American audiences and has become a record-breaking smash success. I guarantee that Twilight will not remain a part of the American moviegoer's consciousness for any prolonged amount of time and just like hugely successful boy bands, this is a phase that will fade away in time.Twilight left me shaking my head so many times in the two hours I was watching it. I was not fascinated, intrigued, or stimulated about anything going on in the film and the only way I can imagine someone being those things is if they were not educated. That last part is sarcasm, but quite honestly this is a film that people will look back on ten years from now and think ""how did I possibly think that was any good.""GRADE: D",2,"An Honest, Neutral

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[0, 0]","When fifth grade came into the library the other day for their time-slot, they started jabbering about ""Twilight"" the movie. ""Oh, it's the best movie I ever saw."" ""I've watched it two dozen times."" ""I'm reading all the books."" Blah-be-blah-be-blah.So like Harry Potter before it, I resigned myself to watching this movie just to know what these kids are talking about. (I did become a Potter fan!!)Casual, one-time viewing comments:1. How on earth did Kristen Stewart land this juicy role? Her acting skills leave a lot to be desired. In fact, what does Edward see in this character at all? She is not in the least interesting. He can't read her thoughts. Is that it? She's intriguing because her mind is blank?2. Not so with Robert Pattinson. A real creepy swooner. I could see his attractiveness in a pale-face sort of way, dare I say it--vampire looks. I guess if you live in a place where it rains every day, then pale skin is not so noticeable. But hey, a whole family of these beings? Yeah, they stand out all right-- as much as exotic birds would on the streets.3. Back to Bella: When Edward allows her to question him, she sounds so childish and he looks so old to her little girl appearance. The mis-casting really threw me off.4. The locale is perfect for the story: erie, exotic, mysterious, romantic in a way. The best part of the movie. There is something ancient about settings with the immediacy of a sky always heavy with mist or rain. One feels anything can happen in a place like that.5. The Native American legend of the Cold Ones lends authenticity to the story (whether the legend is true or not).6. Speaking of Google, have you ever noticed how the laptops are nearly always Macs in movies? Bella has a Mac.I can understand how tweens and young teens love this movie. It's about love, sort of. These young people don't know about love yet, so they like the eerie, mysterious attraction of a human and a vampire. Or as a 10-year-old told me: ""These vampires swore off human blood and only eat animals."" Then another added, ""Yeah, but you should see what they did to a  blood-sucking vampire...."" and she told me. And it really happens the way she described.Is any of this real to kids? Not at all. They understand that this is a movie of fictitious characters, but characters way larger than life. I think they like ""larger than life."" Their parents are normal. Their friends are normal. They are normal (whatever normal means).This is a movie to transport them to a different place, a place of imagination and fantasy with enough realism to make the two-hour experience fun and exciting and fodder for conversation for days and days.If they read the books, they are expanding their reading skills--have you seen the thickness of these books?I'm still withholding judgment until I read at least the first book. But if the books are like the movie, I'm OK with them. There are much better books to read, of course, but the fad that is sucking kids in at the moment (oh, oops, pardon the pun) is the Twilight series. It will eventually play out just like Harry Potter.

Generally speaking, the screenwriters, directors, and actors giving new life to these adaptations do their level best to also ensure that those members of the audience that are perhaps unfamiliar with the story will not be lost in the shuffle or feel that the film is lacking in some way. In this respect, I feel that ""Twilight"" failed to impress, at least in this viewer's opinion.The screenplay as written by Melissa Rosenberg (""Step Up""), and based on the New York Times best-selling novel from Stephanie Meyer, appears to take the basic elements contained within the novel and adds very little effort in transferring them over to the big screen. By this I mean it felt to me (speaking as one who has not read any of the novels) like the writer assumed that certain aspects of the characters relationships, personal quirks, or plot points in general would be understood with very little exposition being given, because the audience would be predominantly made up of fans of the books. This was an ill-conceived notion in my estimation, and one that caused me several moments of confusion throughout the story where events or a character's actions didn't seem to really add up. Over time it began to dawn on me, plus the fact that my wife explained it to me, that whenever an aspect of the story wasn't making as much sense to me, it made perfect sense to her because she knew of the explanation that was contained within the novel. To me if a movie is to be adapted from a book, comic book or otherwise, it needs to take the necessary amount of time to fully explain certain inexplicable actions, events, or whatever the case may be to those not in the know. But I digress.In regards to the rest of the screenplay, barring all of the under-developed aspects, I thought the entire film was poorly written and at times borderline cringe-inducing. The love story aspect, which one person had informed me was barely evident in the film (this was not the case), was extremely heavy-handed, and lacking in any sense of subtlety. Not to mention the fact that the dialogue surrounding this aspect of the story was almost as insufferable as watching any given episode of a soap opera or any of the plethora of teenage romantic dramas one can find on the CW network. Also, if an actor's or actress's character's name wasn't Edward or Bella, then very little time if any was devoted to developing them beyond one or two personality quirks brought over from the books and a few moments of screen time. I understand that this film is all about Edward and Bella and their blossoming relationship; however, the supporting characters, whether good or bad, should be given more to do than just pop-up here and there, offering little to the overall story.Now, don't get me wrong, I do fully understand that this film, and the series of books on which these films are to be based, are intended for teenagers, primarily females. However, I would have thought that even then the writing would be much more refined and developed than what I found in this film. According to my wife, and several others I've talked to, the books are well-written, fast-moving pieces of fiction. In that case, I can only come to the conclusion that the screenwriter was to blame for the horrible nature of the story, and if that is true, I hold out very little hope for the future installments if Melissa Rosenberg remains the sole screenwriter.As for the actors and actresses portraying these coveted characters the performances were universally underwhelming, with not a single stand-out amongst the group. In the lead roles, Kristen Stewart (""The Messengers"") and Robert Pattinson (""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"") appeared bored and wooden, respectively. For a young starlet in such a high-profile role, I would have thought that Kristen would have attempted to bring some semblance of emotional range or at least an interest in the role; however, all I ever felt when watching her portrayal was that she would rather be anywhere except in the movie. Then there is Robert Pattinson whose performance gives even the much maligned Hayden Christensen a run for the money in terms of stiffness and general lack of anything resembling an acting talent. Personally I wondered how either of the two leads in this movie managed to make it through the casting process given their end results on the screen. However, based on the box office numbers and fan hysteria surrounding the film, I would say my opinion on the matter falls somewhere in the minority.The supporting cast members as I stated a moment ago were generally uninspiring in their performances as well. Portraying the leader of the evil vampires is actor Cam Gigandet (""Never Back Down""). Unfortunately for Cam, and the other two members of his posse in the film, with characters as thinly developed and underutilized as these, you'll be lucky to enjoy an enduring career in a business as fickle as the movies. For these characters the fact that they are bad is established through a couple of moments of stalking, a minor altercation or two with some of the town's folk, and just an overall creepy demeanor. Their characters served as another prime example in how this film's screenplay lacked in any form of subtlety.Rounding out the primary players of note (if one can consider them that) are actors Billy Burke (""Untraceable"") and Peter Facinelli (""Hollow Man 2""). Both of these actors are decent enough, and have appeared in several television shows and movies, generally in smaller roles, but they can be relied upon to deliver a solid performance nonetheless. In this film, Billy Burke's character of Bella's father appears sporadically throughout the story, and aside from providing the necessary plot device enabling Bella's presence in this town, he serves no other real purpose. As for Peter Facinelli who portrays the surrogate father to all the ""good"" vampires living in the sleepy little town, he isn't given much more to do than offer a few tidbits of common sense that the characters should have already known or sage advice on surviving altercations with the evil vampires.Lastly, the direction of this film, as handled by Catherine Hardwicke (""Lords of Dogtown""), was merely average at best. The direction wasn't without its fair share of problems though, and Catherine's lack of experience with visual effects and more fantastical elements was very apparent. Due to her disadvantage in this area, I feel that she settled on some shots that looked horrid rather than working the problem to better improve them, especially shots involving the vampires using their strength and speed. For the majority of the time when a vampire was moving very quickly the effect employed (kind of a blurring of the actor or something similar to that) would look extremely odd, and instead of making the character appear to move faster they looked slower. Basically, the effects sequences used in the film were detrimental to the end result almost every single time. Of course, Catherine's very straight-forward, nothing too fancy or flashy camera style didn't benefit this movie either. With a film like this you expect more grandiose camera maneuvers or tricks; instead she shot it more like a small budget indie film. Which isn't surprising given that independent film is the world of cinema that she hails from; however, I believe that it's not a good fit for a movie of this size.In the end, I found very little to praise in this film, and when one only enjoys approximately 20 minutes out of a nearly two hour running time, it's to be expected. I know ""Twilight"" did excellent at the box office, and has struck a chord with many moviegoers, but for me the laughable script, stilted acting, dull sense of direction, and poorly chosen visual effects made this one movie experience that I do not want to endure again.""Twilight"" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.",2,Avoid These Bloodsuckers...,1244246400,"06 6,

I went to the San Diego ComicCon festival and I was able to see the cast and the author and the director and I was truly not impressed. So I had little hope for this movie. I was thinking it would be a dud. What I found was a sleeper of a movie - for mainstream people who have not read the book.Excellent acting. Excellent cinematography. Excellent Casting. Excellent Adaptation of the book. Excellent Music. Excellent plot. Excellent over all. Highly enjoyable and very entertaining.This movie has it all and it was very enjoyable. What I appreciated the most was that Stephanie Meyer's has done is re-adapted the plays of Shakespeare into modern day affairs. Twilight is the retelling of Romeo and Juliet.I loved this movie. A good movie keep you revisiting moment throughout its entirety.I enjoyed that it struggles with choices in life and that you see a group of people overcome their affliction and choose to live above it. However another group choose to embrace it and embrace the evilness of their curse.It is a great adaptation of the vampire. A reinventing. This movie is grand and I can't wait for the continuation.As for my Harry Potter comment. Stephanie Meyer's oversaw the entire movie.

1203943,A2OD8XUHGTKWZO,B001IDZLCK,Karen Hertzberg,"[0, 1]","Twilight author Stephanie Meyer has certainly found a way to speak to teenage readers (especially female teenage readers). But unless you're a female teenager Meyer's writing style is likely to leave you cold. Or, more to the point, you're likely to be put off by having to rattle around inside the point of view of a teenage girl hopelessly in love with a teenage vampire throughout an entire, lengthy book. Meyer's Bella Swan, our heroine, doesn't seem to have an ounce of cool, although the uncool are likely to love her for her klutzy antics and questionable decisions. Bella's counterpart, the vampire Edward Cullen, is far cooler (of course! He's a vampire). He's every girl's fantasy.The movie, while still in Bella's point of view, gets us out of her head where we no longer have to hear her mooning endlessly over Edward. This alone makes it better than the books in my opinion. While the book makes Bella out to be innately danger-prone and clumsy, the movie makes her klutziness look more like happenstance. Somehow, the movie, and particularly the beautiful Kristen Stewart, bring the cool back to Bella Swan. Robert Pattinson makes a stunningly handsome Edward, as well. In fact, the movie is well-cast in general.Is Twilight a bit campy? Yeah. Does it counter camp with a tendency to take itself a little too seriously? Guilty as charged. But I found that it brought some entertainment value to a series of books that I've shelved as ""teen only."" If you liked the books, you'll likely enjoy the movie, which is pretty faithful to Stephanie Meyer's story.

1203944,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B001IDZLCK,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[34, 48]","I'll just say it - TWILIGHT is a dreadful movie. I'm not giving anything away by telling you it's about teen vampires. But these vampires all stepped out of Abercrombie and Fitch commercials. Apart from that - and the part about drinking blood - they are just brooding, boring, angst-ridden teenagers. If you want a not-meant-to-be-scary vampire movie, Lost Boys is way better.  But, of course, Lost Boys didn't have inter-species teen love. (Question: if one of the teens is really hundreds of years old, is it still teen love?) Even that part - which is supposed to send little girls swooning - is just boring. That part of the show goes on the list with Blue Lagoon and Endless Love. Somewhere near the bottom of that list. I watched TWILIGHT with my tweenaged daughter. She knew the lines and the plot and professed to hate every second of it. Her criticisms were spot on, too. She found it to be boring, silly, and melodramatic. I just sat there wondering why the kid who got killed in Harry Potter wouldn't look at the girl from Zathura. They didn't even seem to like each other, let alone love each other.

I sure didn't! That knowledge would have come in handy just last weekend!I could go on but I really don't want to relive this stinker.

After being urged to read Stephanie Meyer's Trilogy of Vampires...I bought the books at Barnes and Noble. Could NOT complete more than a few chapters in the book, because IMHO, it is written for a more youthful mind...and i gifted the set to my niece, who enjoyed them immensely.So...I decided to see if the movie might engage me, even though Ms. Meyer's writing style was unable to capture this reader. Cowabunga, I was more than pleasantly surprised because the movie avoided the overly crafted pause and punctuations of high school drama...it had a fluid, intriguing pace and the fresh ideas of Ms. Meyer's vampiric clans.This was a dramatic love story, complete with precarious situations, unforeseen events, compelling action scenes, engaging special effects and great musical score. The direction, casting and final product is very appealing. This vampire series deviates from most previous bloodsucker films, with their unflinching compunction to follow the lead of Dracula fables. The vampires in the Twilight series evolved over time, which is way cool...and they seem quite believable. Robert Pattinson (""Edward Cullen"" the young vampire)has received rave reviews on his performance and magnetism, and is popular in the media. My attention goes to Kristen Stewart (""Bella Swan"" on film), as she is reminiscent of the young Neve Campbell, compelling and beautiful, mysterious and capable...Stewart carries her character well.

1203952,A1AKQ1YUS4BT82,B001IDZLCK,"Katie Babs ""Katiebabs""","[1, 2]","I did not have great expectations about this movie because I have heard so many opinions of those who had the chance to go see it before I did. I have read many mixed reviews, and I had my own biases about the movie, and the actors selected, mainly that of Robert Pattinson a.k.k rat nest hair boy who would play Edward. I think anyone who is a big fan of a book or series of books that are brought to the big scene has their reservations on whether the movie can deliver the tone of the book it is derived from. Since my expectations were so low, you will be surprised to find out that I really did enjoy Twilight.The only reason I went to see Twilight is because I am a die hard fan of the Twilight series. If I had not read the first book, Twilight, I would have probably waited till the movie came out on dvd, rather then go to the theater to see it. Perhaps I am cheap that way, because the last movie I actually saw in the theater was The Dark Knight. The reason my movie going experience was such a good one, was because I went with a group of wonderful ladies who are fans of the series as I am. We had a ball, especially laughing at certain parts where there should be no laughter.For those who don't know what Twilight is, the basic plot is about a young teenage girl who leaves her mother and stepfather in Arizona to go live with her police chief father in The Forks of Washington State. Bella Swan is a bit of a loner and outcast even though she is welcomed a bit too much so by the kids in her high school. She is the new cool kid on the block. There she meets a seductive and mysterious student, Edward Cullen. Something between them grows to the point of obsession, especially on the part of Edward, and we come to find out he is a one-hundred plus year old vampire who wants Bella so badly, mainly for her blood. Twilight tells of the perils and tribulations of their growing love. Edward is the proverbial lion and Bella is his lamb. As much as he loves her, he wants to stuck her dry, and that is the major problem in the relationship. There is also a sadistic vampire on a loose that Edward must protect Bella from.Since I have a background in film from my college days, I went to view the movie from that standpoint of a film major as well as a fan of the book. Overall, I was impressed by how the movie was told. The tone of Twilight the movie was much like Twilight the book. The movie was shot beautifully and the effects weren't as cheesy as I thought they would be. George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic did the effects, the same company that did Star Wars. The best part of the movie were the group scenes. Some of these scenes consisted of Bella and her friends at high school, her interactions with her childhood friend Jacob and his father, as well as her father. But the scenes I really did enjoy most of all was when Bella was welcomed by Edward's family, the Cullens.The acting was also very good. I loved how Kristen Stewart, who played Bella interacted with her father Charlie, played by Billy Burke. The way Billy played Charlie was near perfect and the way I would envision Charlie to be. Jacob, who is played by Taylor Lautner was adorable. The first time he came on the screen, I called out Jacob's name with great joy. He really added to the movie in the minimal scenes he was in. When the sequel, New Moon comes out, he is going to give Edward a run for his money, just like his character does in the books. I can see more people being on Team Jacob than Team Edward. Also, the actors who played the Cullens were also enjoyable to watch, especially Carlisle, played by Peter Facinelli. But I have to say that Jasper, Edward's brother was a bit too freaky looking for my tastes.The villains, especially that of James, played by O.C. alum, Cam Gigandet, was one of the best characters in the movie, beside Jacob. He has a great presence on screen, and I am not just talking about his gorgeous body. He really embodied the role of this predator and I can see great things for him in his acting future. Is it bad to say, I enjoyed, and lusted for the villain more than the hero? James's evil vampire girlfriend, Victoria, played by Rachelle Leferve becomes one of the driving forces for everything that will happen to Bella in the future.You are all probably wondering about Robert Pattinson who plays Edward. Sorry, folks, I think Robert is the wrong actor to play Edward. Most of the laughing throughout the movie was because of him. I felt his portrayal of Edward was so off and he seemed very uncomfortable in the role. Edward and Bella's chemistry was very lacking and I really couldn't see what it was about this Edward that drew Bella to him and wanted to be with him for all eternity. Perhaps it was his overly bush eyebrows, rat nest hair and too brightly colored lips? Robert was the only one in this movie that didn't seem at ease in the role. He was too angsty and brooding, and not in that sexy good way. The first time Edward and Bella actually are introduced to each other in their Chemistry class was ridiculous. Edward has to leave because he is so overcome with hunger, and I guess desire for Bella because of her blood. Robert overacts a bit too much during this scene, that I couldn't decide if he needed to throw up or he was constipated.Edward did grow on me, but my least favorite scenes in the movie was when Bella and Edward are alone. This is a bit sad, since the whole landscape of Twilight relies on the believability of Bella and Edward's love. From what I saw in Twilight, I just can't see these two riding off in the sunset together, and that is mainly because of Robert's Edward. Simply put, Robert Pattinson is so ill suited as Edward. That was a major fail on the director's part as well as the casting director.With that in mind, if I didn't have those problems with Robert Pattinson, Twilight would deserve a solid B rating, but because Edward is such an intricate part of this world and the story, I have to lower my grade. Overall, Twilight was fun to watch and didn't disappoint too much. There were some small things that annoyed such as the overuse of makeup to make the Cullens' look very pale as well as the almost comical entrance of these vampires. There were too many annoying stares that went a bit overboard between Edward and Bella. The way Twilight ended has an interesting twist not in the book and I can certainly say I will be on board to go see New Moon. If only they had found a better actor to play Edward.Katiebabs",3,Okay Version of Book but NO to Robert Pattinson (C+ Grade),1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,6512,"['did', 'not', 'have', 'great',

Not in love, not necessarily recommending it, but absorbed. I've not read the books. Not that I don't want to, I do. But I've been told that I'll need to set aside time because once I start I won't want to stop.I've seen a few vampire movies. As far as Twilight in the vampire department...the gore is minimal as is the horror. Its there, bubbling under the surface and busting out during some scary moments. So, I'd say the story includes vampires but doesn't live out all vampire all the time. I appreciated the lack of rank language and sex, too. Pretty innocent overall. Not necessarily good and healthy relationships between Bella and her parents (a little sneaking, a little what they don't know won't hurt them, a little meeting with the vampire in the bedroom.) Bella and Edward don't have the healthiest of relationships either...more drama than substance.The key plot is the budding relationship between Bella and Edward. And that may have been my least favorite part of the movie. Some cheesy dialogue and scenes annoyed me, some more than others. And Edward and Bella have been done before...teen misunderstood bad boy (okay, with a twist) and girl who just wants to be loved and cherished meet and connect. But Edward's mood swings and Bella's persistent crush almost don't make sense because they go a bit over-the-top. Some of the special effects were jarring as well.The legends and the underlying mystery...oh, those were the absorbing things.

1203968,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B001IDZLCK,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 1]","Bella Swan can only hope that her boyfriend can keep from draining her of her blood.  That might sound a bit goofy, but in Bella's ""Twilight"" world, it's just another day.""Twilight"" is based on the enormously popular book series by Stephenie Meyer.  It is a book series which I have yet to read, so I will only offer my review of the film as is and not against the book.In the film, Bella (Kristen Stewart) has just moved to little Forks, WA, to be with her father while her mom hits the road with a new love.  Despite reuniting with a childhood friend and getting a used truck from her dad, Bella misses her old home in Phoenix, AZ.  She misses it, that is, until she sees the Cullen clan of foster kids.  This ""family"" includes what appears to be two couples and one loner, Edward (Robert Pattinson).  Bella is instantly drawn to Edward, but the signals he sends her are from all over the relationship spectrum.As the duo gets to know one another, Bella concludes that Edward is more than just a brooding, moody teen.  She thinks that he is a vampire.  Eventually a romance blossoms between them, and they both meet their respective families.Unfortunately for Bella, meeting Edward's family can lead to a dangerous situation for her and them as well.  Even though they don't drink human blood, it still calls to them like a drug.  Some of Edward's relatives, such as the family patriarch, Dr. Cullen, have very little problems with resisting the urge to feed on humans.  Others, like Edward's brother, Jasper, find it to be a tougher ordeal.Throw in the fact that a trio of traveling vampires have been on a killing spree that's leading them straight to Forks, and Bella has found herself in quite a situation.Can forbidden romance between vampire and human succeed?  Can Edward protect Bella from the dangerous vampires on their way to Forks?  Will the Cullen clan be able to resist the urge to take life?  You'll have to watch ""Twilight"" in order to find out.The acting in this film is hit and miss.  Some of the kids at Bella's school come across as a bit too nice to the new kid, but others are dead on for their respective stereotypical role.  The nerdy girl is definitely a nerd, with a strong sense of self hidden beneath her glasses.  The school snob has faking respect and friendship down to an art.  Then there's Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a Quilete teen who used to play with Bella when she'd visit her dad as a child.  Lautner comes across as very protective of Bella in his limited role.  I was actually surprised that he did so well considering I felt that he was one of the weakest performers in one of his previous films, ""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl.""The Cullen family all take very respectable turns in their roles, with Jackson Rathbone (Jasper) and Ashley Greene (Alice) standing out from the pack.  The trio of baddies also did a pretty good job, but they were on screen for such a brief time that the viewer didn't get much of a chance to see them fleshed out.Stewart does well with the role of Bella, but I felt that she lost direction at times with the emotional roller coaster her character was going through with Edward.  Pattinson fares better as Edward, managing to make his character likable, hateful and romantic all at the same time.The special effects hamper the film at times, especially when Edward takes Bella for a run through the forest.  It takes what otherwise is a romantic setup and makes it a bit hokey.  The effects also make a rather fun baseball outing look goofy when the outfield players chase the ball.Catherine Hardwicke's direction of the movie is beautiful at times, highlighting the natural surroundings in Washington and Oregon and framing shots perfectly in order to provoke certain emotions from the viewer or set the perfect tone.  At other times, however, Hardwicke's cameras seem to be trying to appeal to the youthful audience with ""cool"" quick cuts and steadicam shots.Speaking of the audience, the key demographic is nailed here.  Young women in their teens and older women longing for that old perfect boyfriend have everything they could ask for in Edward.  The romantic aspect of the story might be just strong enough to make the primary audience forgive the hiccups in direction and effects, but those outside of key demographic will pick up on these errors more quickly.The DVD is nice, with a clean transfer.  The commentary on disc one is very enjoyable, especially the antics of Pattinson.  Music videos are also included on this disc, with Muse's live performance of ""Supermassive Blackhole"" being the highlight.  Disc two includes a seven-part documentary, deleted scenes and other interesting tidbits.Overall, ""Twilight"" has more going for it than against.  The love story works on many levels and even had this thirty-something husband and father pulling for the kids.  The Cullen family is likable and I wish that those characters (as well as the villains) had been fleshed out more.  Still, I was intrigued enough by the film to read the book.  My wife has read all of the books that have been released, and loves them a lot more than the film.Recommended to teens (especially females) and women as well.  Teen boys will probably not like this film, but older men will find this film quite enjoyable.  I've personally watched the film three times and plan to watch it again.  Heck, I've even picked out my favorite vampire.  Reading the book is next on my list.

This is how the story goes, of course: Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother re-marries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen, a boy unlike any she's ever met. Edward is a vampire, but he doesn't have fangs and his family is unique in that they choose not to drink human blood. Intelligent and witty, Edward sees straight into Bella's soul. Soon, they are swept up in a passionate, thrilling and unorthodox romance. To Edward, Bella is what he has waited 90 years for -- a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. But what will Edward & Bella do when a clan of new vampires -- James, Laurent and Victoria -- come to town and threaten to disrupt their way of life?The cast led by Kristen Stewart (as Bella) & Rob Pattinson (as Edward) is great!

She and her girlfriends went at 11:30 PM on the 20th, to the bookstore and waited till midnight to get it.  They then came home and watched it three times!  It's now three days later and she's on her seventh time.  But what can I say; I've now watched it, twice and want to see it again.Of course it's not as good as the book.  I seem to like it more each time I see it.  I think the first time I was comparing it too much to the book.  I do think that if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have gotten a lot of it.  The movie didn't really bring out the love and devotion between Bella and Edward, the way the book did.There were two deleted scenes in the special addition DVD we got, and I don't understand how they could have left them out.  To me, they were vital parts, with information that will sorely be missed by the reader.But all in all, I think just because the book was so incredible, you just have to watch it over and over again.  Yikes, I'm turning into a Twilight freak, like my 12 year oldThis is my review of the book:Well, my daughter finally got me to read, Twilight. She'd been hounding me for months. I am so not into vampire junk, and told her I just couldn't do it, especially since it was such a large book with three others to follow. An avid reader, I didn't want to invest that much time into something I wasn't interested in.So, I'd just finished a book and was lying down on my bed to rest a bit. My daughter comes into my room and asked if I'd started another. I told her, no, which was unusual because I usually don't waste a minute selecting my next read. But I was feeling tired and decided to lie down for a bit before making a decision. Well, she turned and left, just to return a few seconds later...with TWILIGHT in hand!I was too tired to fight her, so to appease her, to tell her to read to me. She read the first fifteen pages before we had to stop, and I had to admit, it sounded good.

I know there are a lot of different opinions out there, but I am just so thankful to get the chance to see the characters from my favorite books come to life that I'm well satisfied with the movie version of the story. I HIGHLY recommend the books & movie(s) to everyone.That being said, I just recieved the Twilight Ultimate Collector's Set in Blu-ray in the mail today and I wanted to write a review because I noticed that most of the reviews on here are just for the movie itself. I gave this collector's set only 3 stars. I was satisfied with the product well enough to not return it, but I wasn't completely thrilled about it. I am mainly keeping it because I have an extensive Twilight collection that I wanted to add to.The blu-ray case (which was pretty important to me, because I already have the regular DVD version and wanted this for the looks) came with a small scratch along the ""spine"" and on the front. Although, I'm aware these are minor things to pick at and some people will not mind. It all depends on preferences of the owner. Also, there might not be any scratches on most of the other dvd's in the sets.The Soundtrack CD came in perfect condition and is the same edition thats available by itself for $11.99.The jewelry box seems to have been made possibly from cardboard, the inside of it is definitely cardboard (the mirror/picture of Edward is made of cardboard and plastic) and the exterior has been sort of glossed up and stenciled to give it a better finish. It is also sturdier than cardboard but it doesn't have the sturdiness you would get from wood.The watch is just as I expected it would be, its like a kid's watch... plastic wristband. But I'm not complaining because I was aware of that when I purchased it. It comes packaged with a protective plastic cover so the frame doesn't get scratched, which is good. There is a little dangly Cullen crest hanging from it and I thought that was a cute touch.The charm bracelet was adorable. I love the charms and I am definitely happy to add it to my collection of Twilight memorabilia. However, I do not recommend wearing it out a lot because it doesn't weigh much and I have a feeling it would be easily broken.The 6 ""glossy"" photo cards are NOT GLOSSY AT ALL. Its more of a matte finish, and even though there are a few spots on the cards, the quality of the pictures themselves are nice and aren't blurry. The colors aren't as rich as they could be, they're a little bit washed out.The bookmark is just what its supposed to be: a cardboard strip with the word Twilight on it.And lastly, the certificate of authenticity... The paper its printed on favors poster board and I thought it was a nice touch.So there you go. In my opinion, for $80 they could've made the quality of the Collector's Set a lot better... but it passes by just enough that dedicated fans with extra money to spend will probably still buy it.",3,"Review on the Ultimate Blu-ray collector's set, not just the movie alone.",1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,2934,"['Twilight', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'know', 'are', 'lot', 'different', 'opinions', 'there', 'am', 'just', 'so', 'thankful', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'characters', 'favorite', 'books', 'come', 'life', ""'m"", 'well', 'satisfied', 'movie', 'version', 'story', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'books', 'movie', 'everyone.That', 'being', 'said', 'just', 'recieved', 'Twilight', 'Ultimate', 'Collector', 'Set', 'Blu-ray', 'mail', 'today', 'wanted', 'write', 'review', 'noticed', 'most', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'movie', 'gave', 'collector', 'set', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'was', 'satisfied', 'product', 'well', 'enough', 'not', 'return', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'thrilled', 'am', 'mainly', 'keeping', 'have', 'extensive', 'Twilight', 'collection', 'wanted', 'add', 'to.The', 'blu-ray', 'case', 'was', 'pretty', 'important', 'already', 'have', 'regular', 'DVD', 'version', 'wanted', 'looks', 'came', 'small', 'scratch', 'spine', 'front', ""'m"", 'aware', 'are', 'minor', 'things', 'pick', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'mind', 'preferences', 'owner', 'Also', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'scratches', 'most', 'other', 'dvd', 'sets.The', 'Soundtrack', 'CD', 'came', 'perfect', 'condition', 'same', 'edition', 'thats', 'available', '11.99.The', 'jewelry', 'box', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'possibly', 'cardboard', 'inside', 'definitely', 'cardboard', 'mirror/picture', 'Edward', 'made', 'cardboard', 'plastic', 'exterior', 'been', 'sort', 'glossed', 'up', 'stenciled', 'give', 'better', 'finish', 'also', 'sturdier', 'cardboard', ""n't"", 'have', 'sturdiness', 'would', 'get', 'wood.The', 'watch', 'just', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'kid', 'watch', 'plastic', 'wristband', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'was', 'aware', 'when', 'purchased', 'packaged', 'protective', 'plastic', 'cover', 'frame', ""n't"", 'get', 'scratched', 'good', 'little', 'dangly', 'Cullen', 'crest', 'hanging', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'touch.The', 'charm', 'bracelet', 'was', 'adorable', 'love', 'charms', 'am', 'definitely', 'happy', 'add', 'collection', 'Twilight', 'memorabilia', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'wearing', 'out', 'lot', ""n't"", 'weigh', 'much', 'have', 'feeling', 'would', 'be', 'easily', '6', 'glossy', 'photo', 'cards', 'are', 'NOT', 'GLOSSY', 'AT', 'ALL', 'more', 'matte', 'finish', 'even', 'are', 'few', 'spots', 'cards', 'quality', 'pictures', 'are', 'nice', 'are', ""n't"", 'blurry', 'colors', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'rich', 'could', 'be', ""'re"", 'little', 'bit', 'washed', 'out.The', 'bookmark', 'just', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'cardboard', 'strip', 'word', 'Twilight', 'it.And', 'lastly', 'certificate', 'authenticity', 'paper', 'printed', 'favors', 'poster', 'board', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'touch.So', 'go', 'opinion', '80', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'quality', 'Collector', 'Set', 'lot', 'better', 'just', 'enough', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'extra', 'money', 'spend', 'will', 'probably', 'still', 'buy']",N/A

I think of them as being targeted to teenagers.  And I'm much too sophisticated for them.  However, last night the film ""Twilight"" was playing on my cable network. And I  was curious about this phenomenon which seems to be a theme that is just not going away.Twilight is the first in a series of films which introduce Bella, the teenage girl who goes to live with her father in Seattle.  She's new in school, having to come in the middle of her junior year.  Soon enough she meets Edward.  There's chemistry between them.  But it turns out he's a vampire.  What follows is a fast paced plot that held my interest throughout.  The writing was tight, the story line interesting, the special effects wonderful and the casting superb.  Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattison are these would be lovers and I actually felt real emotion for them as they dealt with their plight.The ending was ambiguous and left me with wanting more.  And I can certainly see why this series of films is doing so well.

I generally don't like paranormal stories, but I took the chance and went to see this because it seemed like a love story/romance, and I was not disappointed, as a matter of fact I enjoyed it despite the paranormal stuff in it. This is a love story that has a Romeo and Juliet feel to it and an edge. For those who like formula vampire films look elsewhere, this is a movie for those of us who don't like formula vampire movies or formula vampires.The movie however needed a better budget, especially for the special effects and makeup, and also because it felt rushed. At least 20 min. more should have been added to better flesh out the Cullens who were all very interesting characters. But overall this was a good movie that is very entertaining, and romantic! I finally gave in and read the book, and I liked it.Now about the technical aspects of this dvd, this is definitely one of the better two disc special edition movies out there. The special features are entertaining especially all the deleted scenes and all the extended scenes. I wished that they would have included two versions of the movie on this, one ""theatrical version"" and the other ""extended version, with all or most of the extended scenes and some of the deleted scenes"". Anyways the special features are as follows:1st disk: has the movie and extended scenes, plus audio commentary by the director and the two leads. Plus three music videos: Paramore decode (3/5 stars), Muse and Linkin Park (4/5 stars), these ratings are coming from someone who doesn't like hard rock music, but I was really pleased that the Linkin park song was more like soft rock, and not filled with all that screaming.2nd disk: a detailed seven part documentary about the making of Twilight which was kind of entertaining. Plus deleted scenes (very interesting and entertaining), there is also an 8 minute feature from the Comic Con (I think they should have extended that, it's really fun to watch).So this two disc special edition dvd is definitely worth it and the price is great. This is an entertaining story that has heart.These vegetarian vampires really captured my interest and I look forward to the continuing saga with Edward and Bella.",4,"Beautiful, Atmospheric, and Romantic",1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2268,"['First', 'want', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'teen', 'am', 'twenties', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'paranormal', 'stories', 'took', 'chance', 'went', 'see', 'seemed', 'love', 'story/romance', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'matter', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'paranormal', 'stuff', 'love', 'story', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'feel', 'edge', 'who', 'like', 'formula', 'vampire', 'films', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'movie', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'formula', 'vampire', 'movies', 'formula', 'vampires.The', 'movie', 'however', 'needed', 'better', 'budget', 'especially', 'special', 'effects', 'makeup', 'also', 'felt', 'rushed', 'least', '20', 'min', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'better', 'flesh', 'out', 'Cullens', 'who', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'characters', 'overall', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'romantic', 'finally', 'gave', 'read', 'book', 'liked', 'it.Now', 'technical', 'aspects', 'dvd', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extended', 'scenes', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'two', 'versions', 'movie', 'one', 'theatrical', 'version', 'other', 'extended', 'version', 'most', 'extended', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'follows:1st', 'disk', 'movie', 'extended', 'scenes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'two', 'leads', 'three', 'music', 'videos', 'Paramore', 'decode', '3/5', 'stars', 'Muse', 'Linkin', 'Park', '4/5', 'stars', 'ratings', 'are', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'hard', 'rock', 'music', 'was', 'really', 'pleased', 'Linkin', 'park', 'song', 'was', 'more', 'soft', 'rock', 'not', 'filled', 'screaming.2nd', 'disk', 'detailed', 'seven', 'part', 'documentary', 'making', 'Twilight', 'was', 'kind', 'entertaining', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'very', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'also', '8', 'minute', 'feature', 'Comic', 'Con', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'extended', 'really', 'fun', 'watch', '.So', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'dvd', 'definitely', 'worth', 'price', 'great', 'entertaining', 'story', 'heart.These', 'vegetarian', 'vampires', 'really', 'captured', 'interest', 'look', 'forward', 'continuing', 'saga', 'Edward', 'Bella']",N/A

Let me give you some sage advice--Chill Out!!! Many reviews and comments I've read about the movie in particular seem to be missing the central theme--the ""Twilight Saga"" is a love story between two unlikely soulmates, one of whom happens to be a vampire, and the journey they embark on together & obstacles they face in order to be together. Please tell me I'm not the only one who ""gets"" that central point. So, why would you expect a ghoulish horror fest of a film? The dominant theme of the film is Edward & Bella's meeting and developing love story and that's EXACTLY what the film should be about. Stewart does a great job as logical, pragmatic Bella--who finds herself swept up in an unlikely situation when her soulmate, Edward, turns out to be a member of the undead. Pattinson does a fine job as the romantic vampire, who steals Bella's heart & complicates both their lives by falling in love with a mortal.In a rare occurrence, this movie is what got me into the Stephanie Meyer books. I truly believe the ""Twilight Saga"" is the next Harry Potter phenomenon. The movie was terrific, RP & KS are terrific together and exude incredible chemistry, the tension is real, raw, & passionate, and you root for Edward & Bella all the way. I'm looking forward to seeing Stewart & Pattinson continue to bring this saga and Bella & Edward's destined love story to life on film to its completion.",5,It's A Love Story....Not A Vampire Flick!!,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,1513,"[""'m"", 'teen', 'tween', 'grade', 'school', 'twilighter', 'Instead', 'am', 'probably', 'one', 'oldest', 'commentators', 'here', 'Let', 'give', 'sage', 'advice', 'Chill', 'Many', 'reviews', 'comments', ""'ve"", 'read', 'movie', 'particular', 'seem', 'be', 'missing', 'central', 'theme', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'unlikely', 'soulmates', 'one', 'whom', 'be', 'vampire', 'journey', 'embark', 'together', 'obstacles', 'face', 'order', 'be', 'together', 'Please', 'tell', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'central', 'point', 'So', 'why', 'would', 'expect', 'ghoulish', 'horror', 'fest', 'film', 'dominant', 'theme', 'film', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'meeting', 'developing', 'love', 'story', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'Stewart', 'great', 'job', 'logical', 'pragmatic', 'Bella', 'who', 'swept', 'up', 'unlikely', 'situation', 'when', 'soulmate', 'Edward', 'out', 'be', 'member', 'undead', 'Pattinson', 'fine', 'job', 'romantic', 'vampire', 'who', 'Bella', 'heart', 'complicates', 'lives', 'falling', 'love', 'mortal.In', 'rare', 'occurrence', 'movie', 'what', 'got', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'books', 'truly', 'believe', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'next', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'phenomenon', 'movie', 'was', 'terrific', 'RP', 'KS', 'are', 'terrific', 'together', 'exude', 'incredible', 'chemistry', 'tension', 'real', 'raw', 'passionate', 'root', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'way', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Stewart', 'Pattinson', 'continue', 'bring', 'saga', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'destined', 'love', 'story', 'life', 'film', 'completion']",N/A
1204022,ASN36IA89EBD6,B001IDZLCK,Marco,"[5, 7]","I'll start by saying I haven't read the original book, and I'm definitely not in the book and movie's demographic (ie teenage girls). I saw this movie for the first time tonight, only because I was curious about all the hoo-har that's surrounded both book and movie for years now. As I haven't read the book, this review will be based on the movie alone, and as someone who doesn't fit the demographic at all, I feel I can give a mature, objective review of the movie, free from any kind of adoration of the Twilight franchise.To be fair, this isn't a badly made movie. In fact its very well made, the production is first class, and the locations are well chosen and very atmospheric. I'm rating it 2 stars rather than 1 only for the locations and cinematography in the Pacific North-west forests, which look beautiful on screen, and the Cullen's dream house in the woods. What a stunning house!Well, that's the good bits out of the way. Now for what I felt was wrong with it.Most of the plot points are incredibly bland and ridiculous. I'm not referring to the vampire thing, I can cope with fantasy movies. Sure, make them vampires, that's cool. But make a movie's plot believable once you've established some basic concepts. Here's my list of what I thought was rubbish about it -- Bella arrives at a new school, halfway through the semester. She's quiet, shy, dull and just wants to be left alone. She's even quite rude to the kids in her class. (When told she's going to be on the front page of the school paper, she nips that idea in the bud with a nasty ""NO!"" and some nasty pouting.) But instantly, from the moment she steps out of her old, cool but bomby truck, boys want to date her and girls are fighting each other to be her best friend. This becomes her life at her new school. She's little Miss Popularity for no justification at all. If a timid, quiet but rude, little mouse-like girl showed up at a real school half-way through the semester, she'd be bullied, heckled, friendless, lonely and her life would be constant misery.- The entire love story is so bad its laughable. Bella is always a pouty, miserable little thing, and Edward is just plain horrible and abusive to her every time he sees her. But they must have read the script and thought ""We have to fall in love, because it says we have to in the script"" and what do you know? They instantly go from abusing each other to falling so madly in love that they just can't live without each other. Nothing .... absolutely NOTHING ... that has happened in the movie's first half gives any reason why they should fall so madly in love with each other. Its completely ridiculous. I'm sure there are chapters and chapters in the book explaining why they fall in love, but those chapters have been cut from the movie.- The script is pretty dreadful. You really do cringe at some of the idiotic lines that come out of their mouths. (When Edward shows off his glittery skin under sunlight, Bella says ""Oh, you're so beautiful!"" I laughed so loud the neighbours must have heard me.) I guess the dialogue is better in the book. But maybe not.- The first 45 minutes is just Bella being pouty and miserable and figuring out (very slowly) that Edward is a vampire. That's a long time to show something we already know, even those like myself who have never read the book. We know where all this is leading to, just get on with it. For the first half of the movie there's no tension, no drama, and its all very B-O-R-I-N-G because we know where its leading to. I guess that's better explained in the book.- Why do the Cullen kids spend eternity going to High School? Is that vampire Hell? They'd be so well educated that they could run a family business or something. They could hide away in the warehouse where nobody would see them never grow old. And why do they move to a tiny town where everyone would know each other, and know everything about everyone? Wouldn't moving to a huge city (New York, say) make them more inconspicuous? They'd just blend in with 14 million other people. I guess its all explained in the book.- Why did Bella fall so in love with Edward when Jacob was there first? They knew each other as kids; if they played mud pies together when little, there must be something there. They must have liked each other. Jacob fixed her cool, old, bomby truck for her that made her so popular at school. And Jacob is such a nice boy, all huge smile, long hair, happy chit-chat and Native American hunkness! Why did she go with the sullen, miserable, angst-ridden weirdo who spent the first half of the movie abusing her? I guess that's also explained in the book.- Finally, the entire story of Edward wanting to keep Bella alive ""because that's the right thing to do"" is just plain stupid. Mate, if they're SO in love, just bite her, make her immortal and live happily ever after, for all eternity. What's going to happen when Bella turns 40, is all wrinkly and grey, but Edward is still a gorgeous 17 year old Abercrombie & Fitch model? Well, he's going to run off with the next 17 year girl who will fall madly in love with him. But once again maybe its explained better in the book. In the movie it was a very silly plot point just to keep the series going for a few more movies, and completely unbelievable.I guess everything is better explained in the book. But as a movie, this is one of the stupidest storylines I've ever sat through. The great love story just doesn't make any sense, and Bella is a really annoying character. Hey everyone, just leave her alone, let her sulk in the corner and ignore her. She's a really unlikeable girl. And Edward - who would fall so madly in love with such a creepy piece of baggage-ridden angst?I suppose this movie satisfies a need; the book's legions of fans get to see their literary idols brought to life on the wide screen. I think that's the only use this movie fulfills.",2,Worse than I expected it to be.,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,5897,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'original', 'book',

1204023,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B001IDZLCK,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[185, 232]","I came into the Twilight series not expecting much. The books were, after all, marketed to the teen crowd, so I originally dismissed it.  I didn't expect much from the film.  I wanted to see it not for the story, but because I knew Robert Pattinson from ""Harry Potter"" and enjoy the vampire book/movie genre.4 books and 7 viewings later, I am happy to report that I am now a happily obsessed ""Twilighter.""Going into the movie, I found myself hooked within the first 10 minutes. As soon as the Cullen siblings walked through the cafeteria door, I knew I was in for the ride. And by the time Edward and Bella were sitting together at the restaurant in Port Angeles, I was smitten. The love story, the beautiful vampires, and the amazing chemistry between leads Rob Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, made this film - for me - utterly irresistible. I knew I wanted to see it again as soon as it was over, and the female relatives that I went to see it with couldn't agree more.7 viewings later, I am still obsessed.  Like ""Titanic"" and all the wonderful Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell tv/movie adaptations before it, I was enthralled by the love story of Edward and Bella. Edward Cullen, a 108 year old vampire trapped in the body of a 17 year old, falls in love for the first time...to a human - a young unsuspecting girl named Isabella Swan.  Bella becomes equally fascinated by Edward, and this mutual fascination soon grows into yearning and love.  Theirs is a Romeo & Juliet like love story but this time it's not a family feud that keeps them apart, but the fact that Edward is a vampire and Bella is a human - the predator and the prey fall in love (or as Edward puts it, ""...and so the lion falls in love with the lamb"").  Within the story are some other conflicts, as Edward and his family's true nature must remain a secret, and as other vampires threaten Bella's life.Author Stephenie Meyer has crafted an irresistible tale, and screenwriter Rosenberg Melissa Rosenberg does a fine job of staying faithful with the novel. Some scenes and plotlines are changed around or omitted in order to make it work on film, but the essentials are there.  Director Catherine Hardwicke does a superb job of bringing all the elements together and guiding her young cast through the journey, so I was saddened to hear that she will not be helming the sequel.The major breakthroughs in this film, however, are the young and talented leads - Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. What started out as a small independent film has now become a worldwide phenomenon and has catapulted Rob and Kristen to the brink of superstardom.  And this is no accident.  The charismatic and versatile Robert Pattinson is brilliant as Edward. He properly conveys the internal conflict that rages within Edward and brings it out in full force.  When he's onscreen, you couldn't take your eyes off him.  His Edward can be gentle, loving and tender, but also fearsome and dangerous.  Kristen Stewart brings a beautiful and nuanced performance.  She is exactly how I pictured Bella and she does an excellent job of bringing the character to life.  The supporting cast is also wonderful.  Of the supporting roles, Billy Burke (Charlie Swan), Ashley Greene (Alice Cullen), Kellan Lutz (Emmett Cullen) and Peter Facinelli (Carlisle Cullen) are standouts. I think everyone - with the exception of Nikki Reed's Rosalie Hale/Cullen (who I feel just doesn`t fit Rosalie physically) - are perfectly cast.I am also a fan of the soundtrack and Carter Burwell's amazing score, and I highly recommend purchasing these as a companion to the dvd.  I am thrilled that the dvd is finally coming, and I although the final specs are not yet available, I hope that Summit Entertainment will release a dvd version filled with extras, deleted/extended scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.  I'm a huge fan of the books and I feel that the cast and crew of Twilight has done an amazing job of bringing one of my favorite books to life.  I'm looking forward to New Moon, and I hope that it will be as good as, if not better than, the first film.  This film is a gem and one of my favorite love stories ever.

While the movie strips away the horror aspect of the series, the movie presents the Vampire mythos in a unique way.While the series seems to concentrate more on the romantic angel of the series, there's enough drama ini the series to be of interest to most fans.I approached the series much in the same way that everyone else did, that it was more of a vampire romance series created for teenage girls. But, I found the series much more than that. While there does seem to be something missing from this first film in the series, there were some good aspects of this movie. The baseball scene where Bella joins the vampire family, the Cullens, in the middle of a thunderstorm reminds me of the Quidditch match in Harry Potter. It's one of the best scenes in the movie.However, if you're not into romance films, you might want to avoid this movie.

Not so for Bella Swan, an attractive high school junior, leaving her newly remarried mother's home in sunny Arizona to live with her father in rainy Washington State.  She is easily accepted by a bunch of nice kids and is likely to become the love interest of several young men.  The only problem is that the one boy she's interested in happens to be a vampire.  As if teenage romances weren't dramatic enough.Bella's boyfriend is an object of interest, but this is not your typical vampire movie.  It's more of a romance, and a slow moving one at that.  Unlike many teenagers rushing into sex, this guy is very considerate as he is deeply concerned about going all the way - that is going too far and sucking the life out of his girlfriend's neck.You see, there are all types of vampires, and he and his acquired family happen to be among the ones who care about the human race and mysteriously assume their roles among them.  Then when they risk being ""found out"" they pack up and head for a new town, like the families of all those kids who were in your school one year, moved the next, and were never heard from again. - Hmmm?  But not all vampires have such manners, and not all are ""vegetarians"" -- that is not out for human blood.I appreciated this little twist; however, the film was rather dull and took too long for the pace to quicken.  It lacked suspense as it was no shock to learn this kid was a vampire, as he was white as a sheet and projected an eeriness about him.

I wasn't sure about Robert Pattinson in this film as I wasn't a fan after his appearance in Harry Potter; however I thought he was an excellent Edward Cullin.  I was hooked on this movie after the first 5 min.  I think the one scene in this movie that I truly loved was when Edward saves Bella from the guys in town.  My biggest issue with the book and this movie is the fact that I never once saw fangs or read about fangs.  Seems strange, vampires with no fangs and not harmed by sunlight.  I don't think any of this was bad acting, I felt Kristen Stewart played Bella quite well; she was everything I pictured Bella to be as I read the book.  Unlike most books-to-movies I've seen, this is one of the better ones, right up there with Harry Potter.  Nothing like Eragon where the movie was a total joke compared to the book.

I am in my early fifties, am not especially fond of vampire stuff, an educated professional, and had no real interest in the Twilight stuff.  Out of boredom, and because it was so popular, I finally decided one day to rent this movie.  Full Moon was already out on DVD by then also, to give you an idea of how long it took me.It's all true.  Some of the acting is stiff.  The dialouge could be better.  The plot is thin.  But you will probably become addicted.  At the heart of this movie is the notion of ""True Love"".  The kind that is instant and everlasting.  It is a female fantasy to have a man so completely enraptured with her, so protective, so devoted.  And the high school setting brings back all those youthful fantasies.I now have the three movies, the four books, some of the fan movie books, one soundtrack and in the process of getting the books on tape because I drive a lot for my job and can listen to the story that way.  I will say that I am very glad I watched the movies first, because there are large deviations from the books that can be bothersome to those really invested in the books.  (I went through that with the Harry Potter series.)  After watching Twilight about 15 times however, there were things that really bothered me that the book helped clear up.

And this one is no exception , it is a pg rated romance/slash horror movie.  The teen romance aspect is in the forfront and it even has a nice clan of vampires who never kill people. This is very safe for the non horror fans and kids out there.  It does have the horror aspect of the evil vampires who hunt down humans and their killing is done off camera in order to preserve the pg rating. Some horror fans will reject this soft horror approach but not all horror movies are the same and you get a big budget flick here.  It would have been more enjoyable for me if when in the sun the handsome edward vampire character looked monstrous instead of golden skinned and the lead character still would have said: ""oh you are a monster! but I love you anyways""  ok that wouldn't fit into the girl fantasy story of the powerful handsome protector figure who loves only you but it would have added pathos.  But then this story comes from a line of romance horror novels and that is in line with them evidently. I welcome this movie though as a introduction to the many levels of horror movies out there from grade a to grade z shlock flicks. As a horror buff I'd classify this as a teen aimed romance movie with a horror backdrop and that's perfectly acceptable entertainment even if it's a modern pg flick within the horror genre.

What happened to the vampires that meant evil, blood sucking, sleeping in coffin, Transylvanian accented, demons of hell that they original where portrayed as? Now they sparkle and show off their vampire abilities like a scene in this movie where the dork vampire is saying ""You should fear me, now look what I can do, I'm over here, now im over here, peek a boo, i see you, i can run up hills really fast, I'm spethshall""... gimme a break, it has LAME written all over it.So Jokeb, i mean, the ""dork that sparkles"" meets a girl in high school and.... wait a minute... this guy is 100's of years old and is still going to school? LAME... so he is interested in a chick, but shes human. He gets involved with her while telling his family not to eat her while a bunch of terribly acted Werewolves hunt them, or fight them, or whatever it was, I don't care.And the excuse people give by saying ""it's a love story"", yeah it's much a fascinating love story to watch as the fairy tale romance of love between Anikan Skywalker and Panda Bear in... whatever Star Wars 2/5 was? It's always so lovely when you stalk girls you haven't even said ""boo"" to and watch them sleep for months before you start acting nicer to them. Sigh... young love, it's always the way to go, sneak into the girls room, watch her sleep, stalk her for a while, then ask her out... all great things to tell the grand-kids about how the two of you met.Why did they bother to set this around vampires? Especially ones that SPARKLE, YEY!!!!! Not one of the main actors played by boys (notice i don't use the word MEN) plays a role that could convince me any one of them even has a sexual attraction to anyone of the opposite sex. And did I mention how bad the acting is? It's effing terrible!Seriously, the people who love these films are obsessed with their crush on the actors, not the acting itself, because not one of them could act their way out of a paper bag. This movie is as lame as that last catchphrase I just used. Honestly ladies, what would you do with a vampire if they did exist?

The viewer could easily relate to the feeling of a young, attractive female whose heart was broken by separation from her dream soul. Her feeling of loss and despair were well displayed, with every thing a movie could offer. Her nights were battles of terror. Her days were empty and detached. She leaned on every stray of hope in order to gain any sort of tranquility.The movie zooms on the intricate mindset of the stage of role-identification of adolescence, which diverts many youths away from achieving their goals in life up to their potential. In this scenario, the adolescent lover was paralyzed by her loss, captivated in her own mental prison, her mind split with the unreachable and unknown fate of her lost soul and the realities of conscious world around her.Her irreconcilable feeling of loss deprived her from making judicious choices on life threatening situations. She escaped death miraculously every time she attempted to gain tranquility by testing the boundaries of reality. Her single-parent family setup, her rural residence, and her empty life all played on her fragmented mind.The characters of the movie were all exceptional. The main male lover conveys a total sense of supernatural creature than a real living human. His odd facial contours and pale skin color added unusual power to his imaginary influence. The main female lover also conveys great sense of helplessness and despair. Her father's struggle to cope with his daughter's loss will capture the heart of the viewer by his awareness of the growing up issues of his young daughter.The producer's genius is also well demonstrated in depicting the cult culture that captivated its followers. The filming of the cult rituals in their secluded estates reminded me with the mass suicide of the 39 computer-experts of a Californian cult during Clinton's years. The rural emptiness, the costal rocky cliffs, and the raw forest, were contrasted by an estate crowded with cult followers, performing strange rituals, and occupying very modernized structures.As such, the movie enriches the mind of the viewer with the struggle confronting a young girl with the harshness of wilderness and the oddity of superstitiousness. Her twilight presence engulfed her from the reality of her own world, which was dominated by angry yet friendly behemoth wolves, appearing as vampires, and protecting her from the shadowy ghosts returning from her past.The twilight existence of a hopeless adolescent ended up by a marriage proposal with the soul of a shadow of a bygone lover from the past. As such, the painful transition of adolescence only matured with time, at its own pace, and left its sufferer to hope for a chance of luck of breaking through the objective realm of adulthood.",5,Brilliant depiction of a twilight state of mind,1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,2851,"['movie', 'viewer', 'material', 'world', 'universal', 'state', 'mind', 'youthful', 'romance', 'viewer', 'could', 'easily', 'relate', 'feeling', 'young', 'attractive', 'female', 'heart', 'was', 'broken', 'separation', 'dream', 'soul', 'feeling', 'loss', 'despair', 'were', 'well', 'displayed', 'thing', 'movie', 'could', 'offer', 'nights', 'were', 'battles', 'terror', 'days', 'were', 'empty', 'detached', 'leaned', 'stray', 'hope', 'order', 'gain', 'sort', 'tranquility.The', 'movie', 'zooms', 'intricate', 'mindset', 'stage', 'role-identification', 'adolescence', 'many', 'youths', 'away', 'achieving', 'goals', 'life', 'up', 'potential', 'scenario', 'adolescent', 'lover', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'loss', 'captivated', 'own', 'mental', 'prison', 'mind', 'split', 'unreachable', 'unknown', 'fate', 'lost', 'soul', 'realities', 'conscious', 'world', 'her.Her', 'irreconcilable', 'feeling', 'loss', 'deprived', 'making', 'judicious', 'choices', 'life', 'threatening', 'situations', 'escaped', 'death', 'miraculously', 'time', 'attempted', 'gain', 'tranquility', 'testing', 'boundaries', 'reality', 'single-parent', 'family', 'setup', 'rural', 'residence', 'empty', 'life', 'played', 'fragmented', 'mind.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'exceptional', 'main', 'male', 'lover', 'total', 'sense', 'supernatural', 'creature', 'real', 'living', 'human', 'odd', 'facial', 'contours', 'pale', 'skin', 'color', 'added', 'unusual', 'power', 'imaginary', 'influence', 'main', 'female', 'lover', 'also', 'great', 'sense', 'helplessness', 'despair', 'father', 'struggle', 'cope', 'daughter', 'loss', 'will', 'capture', 'heart', 'viewer', 'awareness', 'growing', 'up', 'issues', 'young', 'daughter.The', 'producer', 'genius', 'also', 'well', 'demonstrated', 'depicting', 'cult', 'culture', 'captivated', 'followers', 'filming', 'cult', 'rituals', 'secluded', 'estates', 'reminded', 'mass', 'suicide', '39', 'computer-experts', 'Californian', 'cult', 'Clinton', 'years', 'rural', 'emptiness', 'costal', 'rocky', 'cliffs', 'raw', 'forest', 'were', 'contrasted', 'estate', 'crowded', 'cult', 'followers', 'performing', 'strange', 'rituals', 'occupying', 'very', 'modernized', 'structures.As', 'such', 'movie', 'mind', 'viewer', 'struggle', 'confronting', 'young', 'girl', 'harshness', 'wilderness', 'oddity', 'superstitiousness', 'twilight', 'presence', 'engulfed', 'reality', 'own', 'world', 'was', 'dominated', 'angry', 'yet', 'friendly', 'behemoth', 'wolves', 'appearing', 'vampires', 'protecting', 'shadowy', 'ghosts', 'returning', 'past.The', 'twilight', 'existence', 'hopeless', 'adolescent', 'ended', 'up', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'soul', 'shadow', 'bygone', 'lover', 'past', 'such', 'painful', 'transition', 'adolescence', 'only', 'matured', 'time', 'own', 'pace', 'left', 'sufferer', 'hope', 'chance', 'luck', 'breaking', 'objective', 'realm', 'adulthood']",N/A
1204058,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B001IDZLCK,Monty Moonlight,"[3, 3]","Okay, by now, we've all heard of ""Twilight"", right? It's a series of films based on a series of books, something that is wildly popular with Hollywood studios these days because of the success of Harry Potter, though a lot of times promising series get started and don't go beyond 1 or 2 films because they are not as successful as Potter has been (I wouldn't mind seeing more of the Vampire's Assistant, among others). Anyway, the one other that leaps to mind as being consistently successful is this Twilight saga, yet many of us have not heard such great things. For example, I heard from most that they were awful films, full of teen angst and simply using the vampire aspect as a hook. This led me to think I probably wouldn't like the films. After all, while I LOVE vampire and werewolf films, I tend to prefer the Hammer Horror kind of vampires to the kind we've been getting since ""Interview with the Vampire"" came out (not that Interview itself wasn't awesome).  However, I still wanted to give it a chance. I like to give everything a chance, and I have two online friends who are also straight guys and yet absolutely love the saga, so here I go... and no, I haven't read any of the books yet (haven't read the Potter books yet either, but I'm a huge fan of the movies, and only 60%  of that is due to Emma Watson *drool*).Well, one of the friends I mentioned sent me the first two Twilight films on Blu-Ray, and after relocating to Austin recently and unpacking everything, I have finally gotten around to watching the first. For those who don't know, here's the plot: A gorgeous teenage girl named Bella Swan (yeah, the name is a little corny) moves in with her dad near the Washington coast. She's a bit of a shy loner, even though everyone instantly wants to be her friend (I guess `cause she's so hot, or people are just ridiculously friendly in this town; I still prefer Emma Watson though). Bella soon meets a strange guy from a strange family of foster kids that are all inter-dating, except for him. His name is Edward Cullen, and he's a vampire. Edward saves Bella from a deadly accident one day, and this causes her to discover his secret. The two are irresistibly drawn to each other and very quickly fall in love. This is the bulk of the story of the first film, and to hear others talk about it, you'd think that was all there was to it, but turns out that's not the case. There's also a pack of werewolves that don't like the vampires, and there's a group of killer vampires that eventually set their sights on Bella. Thanks to these two threats, I actually found the first Twilight film to be... really not bad at all. It's hard to say it was fantastic. Even though I like romance in films, there's a lot of over the top teenage mush in this, no doubt. I also don't care for female narration, as it usually sounds awkward and narration in general is only rarely a good idea. Nevertheless, this film has some good things going for it. The werewolf storyline is barely touched upon here, but it is still intriguing. However, we do get into the villainous vampires somewhat, and I always love to ogle Rachel Leferve who was great as the female baddy here. Just as easy on the eyes as Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella, and Ashley Greene, who plays Alice Cullen, is pretty cute too, among others in the film. I mention this because one of my friends' selling points was the hotties, and these are the ones that caught my attention the most.Yes, overall, I liked this film fairly well. I'm not in love with it or anything, but I'm interested to see what happens next, and hopefully some of the cheesier stuff will be lessened next time around, or at least balanced out with more of the good stuff: hotties and supernatural confrontation. Not that I require those things in a movie, but they are what saved this one.The Blu-Ray release is a good one. In addition to the film, you get deleted and extended scenes, music videos, featurettes, and a rather enjoyable commentary by the two lovebird stars and the director, my fellow McAllen, Texas native, Catherine Hardwicke. The stars are actually more likeable in the commentary than in the film, ha, but they're tolerable in the film too. So, basically, good Blu-Ray and a movie worth giving a chance. You may like it or you may not, but I thought it was better than I had heard from most people I know. I look forward to the next one,... still wary though.",4,One Guy's Review,1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,4426,"['Okay', 'now', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Twilight', 'right', 'series', 'films', 'based', 'series', 'books', 'something', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'days', 'success', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'lot', 'times', 'promising', 'series', 'get', 'started', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', '1', '2', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'successful', 'Potter', 'been', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'more', 'Vampire', 'Assistant', 'others', 'Anyway', 'one', 'other', 'mind', 'being', 'consistently', 'successful', 'Twilight', 'saga', 'yet', 'many', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'such', 'great', 'things', 'example', 'heard', 'most', 'were', 'awful', 'films', 'full', 'teen', 'angst', 'simply', 'using', 'vampire', 'aspect', 'hook', 'led', 'think', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'LOVE', 'vampire', 'werewolf', 'films', 'tend', 'prefer', 'Hammer', 'Horror', 'kind', 'vampires', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'came', 'out', 'not', 'Interview', 'was', ""n't"", 'awesome', 'However', 'still', 'wanted', 'give', 'chance', 'like', 'give', 'everything', 'chance', 'have', 'two', 'online', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'straight', 'guys', 'yet', 'absolutely', 'love', 'saga', 'here', 'go', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'yet', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Potter', 'books', 'yet', 'either', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'movies', 'only', '60', '%', 'due', 'Emma', 'Watson', '*drool*', '.Well', 'one', 'friends', 'mentioned', 'sent', 'first', 'two', 'Twilight', 'films', 'Blu-Ray', 'relocating', 'Austin', 'recently', 'unpacking', 'everything', 'have', 'finally', 'gotten', 'watching', 'first', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'here', 'plot', 'gorgeous', 'teenage', 'girl', 'named', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'yeah', 'name', 'little', 'corny', 'dad', 'Washington', 'coast', 'bit', 'shy', 'loner', 'even', 'everyone', 'instantly', 'be', 'friend', 'guess', 'cause', 'so', 'hot', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'ridiculously', 'friendly', 'town', 'still', 'prefer', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Bella', 'soon', 'strange', 'guy', 'strange', 'family', 'foster', 'kids', 'are', 'inter-dating', 'name', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'vampire', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'deadly', 'accident', 'one', 'day', 'discover', 'secret', 'two', 'are', 'irresistibly', 'drawn', 'other', 'very', 'quickly', 'fall', 'love', 'bulk', 'story', 'first', 'film', 'hear', 'others', 'talk', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'out', 'not', 'case', 'also', 'pack', 'werewolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'vampires', 'group', 'killer', 'vampires', 'eventually', 'set', 'sights', 'Bella', 'Thanks', 'two', 'threats', 'actually', 'found', 'first', 'Twilight', 'film', 'be', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'hard', 'say', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Even', 'like', 'romance', 'films', 'lot', 'top', 'teenage', 'mush', 'doubt', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'female', 'narration', 'usually', 'awkward', 'narration', 'general', 'only', 'rarely', 'good', 'idea', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'werewolf', 'storyline', 'barely', 'touched', 'here', 'still', 'intriguing', 'However', 'do', 'get', 'villainous', 'vampires', 'somewhat', 'always', 'love', 'ogle', 'Rachel', 'Leferve', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'female', 'baddy', 'here', 'Just', 'easy', 'eyes', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'who', 'Bella', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'who', 'Alice', 'Cullen', 'pretty', 'cute', 'too', 'others', 'film', 'mention', 'one', 'friends', 'selling', 'points', 'was', 'hotties', 'are', 'ones', 'caught', 'attention', 'most.Yes', 'overall', 'liked', 'film', 'fairly', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'love', 'anything', ""'m"", 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'hopefully', 'cheesier', 'stuff', 'will', 'be', 'lessened', 'next', 'time', 'around', 'least', 'balanced', 'out', 'more', 'good', 'stuff', 'hotties', 'supernatural', 'confrontation', 'Not', 'require', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'what', 'saved', 'one.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'good', 'one', 'addition', 'film', 'get', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'music', 'videos', 'featurettes', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'commentary', 'two', 'lovebird', 'stars', 'director', 'fellow', 'McAllen', 'Texas', 'native', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'stars', 'are', 'actually', 'more', 'likeable', 'commentary', 'film', 'ha', ""'re"", 'tolerable', 'film', 'too', 'So', 'basically', 'good', 'Blu-Ray', 'movie', 'worth', 'giving', 'chance', 'may', 'like', 'may', 'not', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'had', 'heard', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'one', 'still', 'wary']",N/A

1204060,A3ZMC6NFTXEKO,B001IDZLCK,"M. R. Griffin ""griffinfinity""","[5, 7]","Many elements of 'Twilight' have been explored in other vampire movies. One might gather that this film has little to offer. Not so. There are also several old rules that get tossed out the window here, and that makes for an interesting film. The objective is not fright and blood. It is certainly not ritual (unless you include baseball). And the only relation to `Lost Boys' is found in the `new kid on the block' story line. So on to the good and the bad (no ugly in `Twilight'). It is definitely a film with Barbie, Ken and their teenage daughters in mind. But fans of the genre might just be entertained.Since it was based on a novel, there was plenty of obligatory set-up work to be handled. Director Catherine Hardwicke does so while maintaining a smart pace. She is able to move onto, well, just the potatoes I'm afraid, without dragging her feet. The story is set mainly in the Pacific Northwest. This allows for a nice compromise between the old day/night conflicts of most vampire adventures.Some of what is found in `Twilight' is a cross between a series on the WB and `The Bold and the Beautiful'. The vampires contained within `Twilight' are for the most part quite affable. And as odd as it may seem, the notion of a vampire maintaining a strictly vegetarian diet is not a new one. But it does tend to water things down.

Minor change...most movie adaptations from books have them. My problem isn't that these vampires aren't like Dracula or don't have fangs...I believe any author can write a vampire how they see fit. My problem is the lack of total passion between Bella and Edward in the film. The book has your heart racing over the pure love they feel for each other. It's there, and no one mistakes it. In the film...I couldn't tell they loved each other at all! Part of the problem I think is Bella's total lack of emotion the entire film.

1204067,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B001IDZLCK,Muzzlehatch,"[3, 7]","I'm not exactly the target demographic for the TWILIGHT films - or books (which I haven't read) - I'm the wrong gender, and just a wee bit too old.  And, unlike the 100+ year old vampires that make up half the main characters in this film, I do on occasion act my age.  But I loved ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", and I love ""Harry Potter"" (the books much more than the films), so I guess the friend who gave this to me thought I might actually like it.  Or it was a gag.  Haven't figured that out yet, and kind of scared to ask.Anyway, I don't see much need to go into the plot here - you've got 1000+ other reviews to look at, and how many people looking at reviews for this film don't know at all what it's about anyway?  So I'll just say that basically, I don't get it.  I like to believe that my inner child, and inner adolescent, is still pretty strong - there's plenty of other stuff aimed at teens besides the things I mentioned in the first paragraph that I love.  But I didn't get the appeal here.  Bella and Edward are two of the most boring, whiny, and lame protaganists I've ever seen in any film.  I guess it's not hard to see why they would get together - even though neither of them is really attractive as a person in any way (apart from physically - and even there it strikes me that the beauty of both actors is de-emphasized unless pasty skin and sullen expressions turn you on) - they're the two least-interesting people at school, so why not?  They're both morose and self-hating most of the time, and though I at first thought Bella was making a pretty giant leap when she figured out that Edward was a vampire pretty quickly - really, it makes sense.  In the world of ""Twilight"", vamps are super-powerful and not apparently prey to any of the vampire weaknesses from legend - so of course Bella, who seems to be the center of the universe in this film for no reason at all that I can determine, would become the object of desire for a superhero, whose only downside is the blood-drinking, but hey they can deal with just sucking animals so it's all good.This is wish-fulfillment romance at it's most blatant and cringe-inducing, when it comes right down to it.  Boring nothing of a girl just happens to have everybody around her want her - all the boys at school latch onto her, the girls like her too (and never seem jealous), the hottest vampire guy loves her, and she even makes some serious enemies who are after her and only her.  I guess in that sense, I do understand the adolescent attraction to this stuff - everybody wants to be the center of attention, even if he or she is stupid, or ugly, or fat, or dull - whatever.  Bella is beautiful, but that's about it.  I guess that's enough, for tens of millions of followers of this stuff, but for me it just led to tedium and irritation for the most part.  There's only so much whiny angsty pseudo-love I can take without SOMETHING else going on, and nothing really happens here until the last third of the film, by which point I'd nearly given up.But it's not a complete and total loss, and I do think some of those who have trashed it as the worst thing since the death of Kurt Cobain are being a little hyperbolic.  Some of the scenery is well-shot, and some of the acting isn't bad.  I liked Billy Burke, as Bella's dad, quite a bit, and their relationship didn't come off nearly as stereotypically as many of the other connections in the film.  Anna Kendrick is a lot of fun as Bella's best friend, and Taylor Lautner isn't too bad as the eventual wolf-boy rival, at least he's got some charisma and seems to be having fun.  But Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart both seem like they're sleepwalking here, and as they have to carry the film, that's a bit of a problem.  How much of that problem lies in their acting, how much in Catherine Hardwicke's generally uninteresting and obvious direction (ooh, bad guys approaching in slow-mo with electric guitar twanging, I guess we know this is IT), and how much in the original material by Stephenie Meyer, I couldn't say.  But these are profoundly dull people as far as I was concerned, and I guess I would say - in particular to adults trying to figure out what all the fuss is about - if you're not interested in watching angsty emo kids emote for two hours, with very little in the way of story or anything that makes much sense in terms of plot development, this is not the film for you.I have the standard DVD, which looks and sounds fine, and has a few extras - I've listened to a bit of the commentary just to see if it's funny, but it's really fairly straightforward and boring with only Pattinson seeming particularly lively in it; the music videos I haven't checked out yet, nor have I looked at the extended scenes - I'm not sure I can take any more!",2,Vampires?

However, after I read Twilight - I ran out to the store and bought this DVD because I thought that I would love it and it would be something that I would watch over and over again.I absolutely loved the book so I think that I had really high expectations before watching the movie.  I felt that the first half of the movie was rushed and missed out on so much of the essence of the book.  I almost felt like I was watching Clif Notes with a quick recap of the book.  A lot of the scenes felt ackward to me and it was almost painful to watch because in my mind - Bella and Edward are so much better than this in the book.  They also made some changes with the story line - which didn't bother me as much.  It just bothered me that they rushed the love story and didn't take more from the book to make this movie Great.While I thought the first half of the movie fell short, I really enjoyed the last half.  I felt that Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson had really great chemistry once they were together.  The love story takes over and I felt drawn in for the last 45 minutes or so.I am happy that I purchased this movie and I have watched it more than once - but everytime I watch it, I fast forward through a lot of the scenes that I think are downright TERRIBLE.If you are a fan of Twilight - I think you should watch this movie, just beware that if falls short of the book.",3,Mixed feelings...,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,1487,"['do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'ever', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'rare', 'exceptions', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'However', 'read', 'Twilight', 'ran', 'out', 'store', 'bought', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'would', 'watch', 'again.I', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'book', 'so', 'think', 'had', 'really', 'high', 'expectations', 'watching', 'movie', 'felt', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'rushed', 'missed', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'essence', 'book', 'almost', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Clif', 'Notes', 'quick', 'recap', 'book', 'lot', 'scenes', 'felt', 'ackward', 'was', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'mind', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'book', 'also', 'made', 'changes', 'story', 'line', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'just', 'bothered', 'rushed', 'love', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'book', 'make', 'movie', 'Great.While', 'thought', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'fell', 'short', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'last', 'half', 'felt', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Rob', 'Pattinson', 'had', 'really', 'great', 'chemistry', 'were', 'together', 'love', 'story', 'felt', 'drawn', 'last', '45', 'minutes', 'so.I', 'am', 'happy', 'purchased', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'everytime', 'watch', 'fast', 'forward', 'lot', 'scenes', 'think', 'are', 'downright', 'TERRIBLE.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Twilight', 'think', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'just', 'beware', 'falls', 'short', 'book']",N/A

Stewart, I believe performed well, but Pattinson simply brought his good looks.  In much of the scenes he looks more like an actor struggling with a career choice than a vampire in turmoil.

1204079,A12FLZREV32JOP,B001IDZLCK,Noelle Eiram,"[0, 0]","As a disclaimer, I have not read any of the 'Twilight' books, though I have been told much about them. When I mention Twilight, I am referring to the movie, not the book.I was initially surprised by the subtlety in 'Twilight.' From the lovely Arizona sun to the rain drenched Forks, Washington, the evocative landscape adds to an eerie, romantic mood. Dark evergreens and mist make a perfect setting for a vampire love story.The relationship between the sacrificial Bella, played by a naturalistic Kristen Stewart, and her estranged father Charlie (an excellent Billy Burke), was surprisingly tender. After Bella moves to the tiny town of Forks to live with her father, she meets a variety of very friendly students. In fact, these students are suspiciously kind. I was grateful that the audience was spared catty teenage stereotypes, but cute boy after cute boy pursue the laconic Bella, displaying what a female fantasy this story is.Of course, Bella shows no interest in normal friends, male or female, but is intrigued by the creepy Edward (Robert Pattinson) and his rich, gorgeous family. Edward stares incessantly at Bella and then vacillates between awkward interest and rudeness. Instead of assuming that he has a mental illness, Bella is intrigued. After a display of inhuman power, Bella is even more enchanted, especially when she discovers that he is a vampire. He tells her that he is a killing machine who wants to kill her and drink her blood. She doesn't care and falls madly in love with him. Luckily, he and his family only drink unsatisfying animal blood.Their relationship is bizarre at best. Edward apparently is a sort of romantic fantasy, dangerous but not, a knight in shining armor (because there is no way Bella can stay safe without him), strong, smart, and more than 100 years old. The age difference odd, as is its terrifying suggestion that a boyfriend who displays signs of stalking and abuse (Edward sneaks into Bella's room to watch her sleep) is secretly good and safe.Regarding acting, Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson realistically stutter and stare, but their attraction still baffles me. They both look good, but neither is a particularly interesting character. As mentioned, Billy Burke is moving as the most consistent character, Charlie, Bella's kind but slightly awkward father. Taylor Lautner is charming in a small role as Bella's childhood friend, Jacob, and Anna Kendrick and Justin Chon stand out as hilariously believable high-schoolers. Likewise, Edward's vampire family is lots of fun, including the gentle Carlisle (Peter Facinelli), his welcoming wife Esme (Elizabeth Reaser), feisty Rosalie (Nikki Reed), her beefy boyfriend Emmett (Kellan Lutz), the sprightly Alice (Ashley Greene), and the humorously intense and repressed Jasper (Jackson Rathbone). (Perhaps their family was supposed to come across more benignly than serial-killers anonymous because Bella is in no way concerned that they desire her blood.)There are other, less chaste vampires, who are ludicrously over the top. As cheesy as these villains are, another disturbing aspect of this film is the violence one of them wreaks at the end. Actually, reviews claiming that there is no violence whatsoever in the film is more troubling than the violence itself. Certainly no one gets beheaded, but severe physical abuse of a high school girl should count as alarming violence. Anyway, this statement is meant more as a critique of the films reception than the film itself.With all my reservations about the movie 'Twilight,' I have seen it several times. The music rocks, and the world is weirdly intriguing. The film is both better and stranger than I predicted.",3,"Well done, but cheesy and creepy",1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,3681,"['disclaimer', 'have', 'not', 'read', ""'Twilight"", 'books', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'much', 'When', 'mention', 'Twilight', 'am', 'referring', 'movie', 'not', 'book.I', 'was', 'initially', 'surprised', 'subtlety', ""'Twilight"", 'lovely', 'Arizona', 'sun', 'rain', 'drenched', 'Forks', 'Washington', 'evocative', 'landscape', 'eerie', 'romantic', 'mood', 'Dark', 'evergreens', 'mist', 'make', 'perfect', 'setting', 'vampire', 'story.The', 'relationship', 'sacrificial', 'Bella', 'played', 'naturalistic', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'estranged', 'father', 'Charlie', 'excellent', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'tender', 'Bella', 'tiny', 'town', 'Forks', 'live', 'father', 'variety', 'very', 'friendly', 'students', 'fact', 'students', 'are', 'suspiciously', 'kind', 'was', 'grateful', 'audience', 'was', 'spared', 'catty', 'teenage', 'stereotypes', 'cute', 'boy', 'cute', 'boy', 'pursue', 'laconic', 'Bella', 'displaying', 'what', 'female', 'fantasy', 'story', 'is.Of', 'course', 'Bella', 'interest', 'normal', 'friends', 'male', 'female', 'intrigued', 'creepy', 'Edward', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'rich', 'gorgeous', 'family', 'Edward', 'incessantly', 'Bella', 'then', 'vacillates', 'awkward', 'interest', 'rudeness', 'Instead', 'assuming', 'mental', 'illness', 'Bella', 'intrigued', 'display', 'inhuman', 'power', 'Bella', 'even', 'more', 'enchanted', 'especially', 'when', 'vampire', 'killing', 'machine', 'who', 'kill', 'drink', 'blood', ""n't"", 'care', 'madly', 'love', 'Luckily', 'family', 'only', 'unsatisfying', 'animal', 'blood.Their', 'relationship', 'bizarre', 'best', 'Edward', 'apparently', 'sort', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'dangerous', 'not', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'way', 'Bella', 'can', 'stay', 'safe', 'strong', 'smart', 'more', '100', 'years', 'old', 'age', 'difference', 'odd', 'terrifying', 'suggestion', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'signs', 'stalking', 'abuse', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'room', 'watch', 'sleep', 'secretly', 'good', 'safe.Regarding', 'acting', 'Kirsten', 'Stewart', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'realistically', 'stutter', 'stare', 'attraction', 'still', 'look', 'good', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'character', 'mentioned', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'moving', 'most', 'consistent', 'character', 'Charlie', 'Bella', 'kind', 'slightly', 'awkward', 'father', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'charming', 'small', 'role', 'Bella', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Jacob', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'Justin', 'Chon', 'stand', 'out', 'hilariously', 'believable', 'high-schoolers', 'Likewise', 'Edward', 'vampire', 'family', 'lots', 'fun', 'including', 'gentle', 'Carlisle', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', 'welcoming', 'wife', 'Esme', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'feisty', 'Rosalie', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'beefy', 'boyfriend', 'Emmett', 'Kellan', 'Lutz', 'sprightly', 'Alice', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'humorously', 'intense', 'repressed', 'Jasper', 'Jackson', 'Rathbone', 'Perhaps', 'family', 'was', 'supposed', 'come', 'more', 'benignly', 'serial-killers', 'anonymous', 'Bella', 'way', 'concerned', 'desire', 'blood', 'are', 'other', 'less', 'chaste', 'vampires', 'who', 'are', 'ludicrously', 'top', 'As', 'cheesy', 'villains', 'are', 'disturbing', 'aspect', 'film', 'violence', 'one', 'wreaks', 'end', 'Actually', 'claiming', 'violence', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'more', 'troubling', 'violence', 'Certainly', 'one', 'beheaded', 'severe', 'physical', 'abuse', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'should', 'count', 'alarming', 'violence', 'Anyway', 'statement', 'meant', 'more', 'critique', 'films', 'reception', 'film', 'itself.With', 'reservations', 'movie', ""'Twilight"", 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'music', 'rocks', 'world', 'weirdly', 'intriguing', 'film', 'better', 'stranger', 'predicted']",N/A

Basically, the first two thirds of the movie are as stupid as everyone says, and yeah, the watching Bella sleep is creepy as hell.  But we've heard it all before and I wasn't really bothered by what I was seeing until the chase with James started ramping up--which by the way, was completely manufactured tension because he had no motivation for obsessing over Bella other than supposedly being some crazy hunter.  Anyway, all of a sudden this James guy, whose actor is trying his very best to be a convincing psychopathic villain, is making a video of himself torturing our ""heroine"" so he can send it to her boyfriend... dude.  Dude.  There is no way I wanted to see something like that in a movie like Twilight.I've finally discovered what Kristen Stewart can do as an actress... she's surprisingly good at gasping in pain while she pulls glass out of her thigh and scrabbles across the floor with a broken leg.  Jesus.  I felt like I had stumbled into a slasher movie, and Twilight just doesn't have the je ne sais quoi to pull off scenes of violence with any sensitivity or class.  You need a good director, a good script, to not make that sort of thing seem totally out of place and exploitative.  It's not the overblown, campy sort of violence that anyone can get away with because it's impossible to take it seriously.  It's like CSI trying to turn rape and bludgeoning deaths into primetime entertainment.So basically, Twilight is wrong on way more levels than I was even aware of having read about the stalker thing.

1204101,AZN6WMC71MGWJ,B001IDZLCK,Phip,"[9, 11]","I have such mixed feelings about this movie. It's almost like I'm being seducted by a sadistic vampire. One that tourtures me with bad acting, apalling scripting, and special effects so cheesy me 14-yr-old brother could pull off better. I honestly cannot figure out what is making this series such a huge hit, but sometimes a phenomena like this can't be logically explained. All I know is that for every practical reason, I should hate this movie. It is abrasive to my senses to watch. But for some reason, I'm hooked.Being a voracious reader, I couldn't stand by and watch the world be swept away by this ""Twilight Fever"" and not know anything about it, so I grabbed a copy. I actually liked it at first, but as I read more of the books I realized how terribly they were written and had to stop before driving myself crazy with Bella and Edwards obsessive, controlling, drama-ridden relationship. I'll admit Meyer did capture teenage romance pretty accurately.Unfortuately, the movie mirrored the book except for the fact that there is even less character developement in the movie than in the book. Bella is played by the boring, monotone, one-dimentional Kristin Stewart who  drives me crazy with her poor delivery. She pauses mid-sentence and studders dramaticaly through the entire movie. My favorite part is at the end when Edward tells her she has to go to Florida so he can't hurt her anymore. (""What?..you..you want me to leave?..I..I..NO!..I just...no..I can't..I don't.. even know what you're saying...no..I..I.."") Aaaaghh!! See how annoying it can get? And all the other actors are almost as bad. Although I think Bella's friends from high school did a pretty good job. Edward wasn't actually that bad. Though he could have done better, he managed to display some inner turmoil that I thought accurately portrayed a tortured vampire soul.But even though their relationship is so maniacally obsessive, the worst part is the levity with which it is accepted by Bella. If the person I was infatuated with told me they were a vampire who wanted nothing more than to kill me and drink my blood, I think I'd have a slightly different response than, oh say, ""I don't care. I trust you."" Okay, the guy is a freakin' VAMPIRE! A creature from the underworld, which really aren't actually supposed to exist in real life. But she's cool with that. You know, just another day in the life of Bella. She's only known him, what, a few weeks and she's ready to give up her life for him? It just doesn't make sense. Okay, sorry, that was a rant.As I said before, the script and screenplay is awful. The touching parts end up contrived, the funny parts end up corny, the action parts end up ridiculous thanks to the special effects department, and the dramatic parts wind up seeming like a high school theater production.Yet with all these downfalls, I still bought it and have seen it almost ten times. Every time it's on, I'm drawn in. Maybe it's entertaining, maybe it's seductive, maybe I'm a bit masochistic, or maybe I just enjoy making fun of it like Mystery Science Theater or something. I'm disappointed in it (and chances are, unless you're a teenage girl in love with Rob Pattinson, you will be too), but I own it and I'm not ashamed to like it. It's just too bad they didn't do a better job of it. It could have been a knock-your-socks-off movie.

1204102,A1QYOWY8H6MT16,B001IDZLCK,Phoenix Child,"[211, 285]","I consider myself a Twilight fan. I love the books and since reading the first one have bought the other three the day they came out. I was extremely excited about the movie, and went to see it opening night. My first thought by the halfway point of the movie was: WHY DID I SPEND MONEY ON THIS?!!!!!!!!Twilight: The Movie is a horrible, campy, tacky, CHEAP vampire story that swallows almost all of the power of the novels. The vampire special effects are even WORSE than ""Queen of the Damned"" (which is hard to achieve), and the ""action"" scenes were scripted, confusing, and in some cases pointless and lame.The acting was off and it was awful. Kristin Stewart was weak and ineffectual as Bella. She portrays none of Bella's strengths and instead presents her as, essentially, a weakling, a coward and a whiner. Rob Pattinson's Edward is kind of creepy, kind of tacky, and completely unromantic; in fact, he's kind of off-putting. None of the Cullens act like they're supposed to except Rosalie and Alice, so of course they only got about five lines each in the entire movie.The worst acting choice was whoever played Charlie -- he's a dead fish in the entire movie. He never displays ANY emotion. Now, in the books Charlie IS kind of closed-off, but he DOES get upset -- like when Bella says she's running away, for instance. In the movie, he's quiet and unmoved and seems to say nothing but ""Oh, my daughter's running away. Don't go, Bella. Please stay, Bella. Wonder what's on TV?""However, first and foremost, the love story element was RUINED by the script. Bella and Edward are awkward as can be together, and at one point Edward makes the cryptic comment ""It would be better for you if we weren't friends."" Now, at this point in the movie, he's been nothing but a supreme jerk to Bella at every turn. If I were Bella, my response would have been: 'What?! We AREN'T friends! You're a creeper and you need to go before I call the cops! Stranger danger! [Makes sign of the cross]'By the time they're 'together' as a couple it feels so rushed and unnatural that you have to gag at some of Bella's more romantic thoughts, which make perfect sense in the book. One of the worst mistakes they made was combining about five different important scenes and shortening them into one confusing scene: the meadow scene, combined with the first running scene, combined with the skipping class scene, combined with three other minor scenes. It was rushed, confusing, creepy, unromantic, weird, badly acted, badly shot, and badly directed.The dynamic of Bella and Edward was ruined -- Edward is supposed to be so supremely larger than life to Bella; for instance, in the book when he runs (he's supposed to look like a blur, which the movie of course killed off right away) with Bella the first time she's violently ill and can't stand for a moment. In the movie she just hops off his back as if to say 'Alright, I do this all the time.'In the book, James, the villain, is actually rather terrifying. In the movie...okay, the actor is admittedly very attractive. But -- have you ever seen the movie ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (NOT the show, because the show was amazing; the movie was awful)? You know, where Rutger Hauer played the most CAMPY, RIDICULOUS vampire EVER? Well, James almost TOPS his performance in ""Buffy"" -- again, VERY hard to achieve.Another point of unintended comedy? Bella and Edward spend half the friggin' movie in a TREE. Why? NO ONE KNOWS. He calls her ""spider monkey,"" for the love of GOD. It's SILLY! And then when the Cullens jump at the 'bad vampires'? It looks like they're about to perform the song and dance ""fight"" in the first scene of ""West Side Story!""

Early in the movie I was thinking, ""Gee, kids in my schools were never this nice and welcoming!""  Even now, I thought the movie was quite good, and a compelling story in its own right.  The peripheral characters are in many ways more likeable and more interesting than the two stars, but hopefully they will come more into the forefront in future installments.  I had to get past only one really glaring flaw for a complete suspension of disbelief: while I can see why Bella would have been fascinated with Edward (again thinking back on my own adolescent experience, and the appeal of the ""dangerously mysterious loner""), I remain puzzled as to what Edward saw in Bella, why he would fall in love with her so fast and so completely (""You are my life now"").  Was it because her mind, and her mind alone, was closed to his telepathic probing?  It was somewhat implied that this is what intrigued him, but it wasn't entirely clear. Perhaps it's more obvious in the book, which I have not read.

I waited a long time, in fact New Moon was already in theaters before I got around to renting this one.  I was hooked in the first few minutes of watching it, and with Bella narrating what she was doing, and what she was thinking, it just captured my full attention.  I loved almost everything about it,  couldn't wait to go see New Moon to see what happened next, and then in a little over a week after that, I had read all four books to fill in all the details that a movie just can't cover.  It has a misty, mysterious look to it, and along with the music, made me feel like being in a peaceful dream.  It took a little getting used to the idea of a vegetarian vampire who sparkles rather than burns in the sunlight, but this is a love story, and Edward being a vampire is just the obstacle. The fact that he is good is why almost every woman I know (including myself), falls in love with him. The scenes from the tree tops are beautiful, and the baseball scene, and fight scene at the end were very well done.  I think whether you are a teenager, the mother, or the grandmother of one, you can enjoy this movie.Just a note about the dvd's: If you want to buy Twilight or New Moon, and are interested in the Bonus Features, they have been split up between different retailers.

1204112,A2W1GT509PD228,B001IDZLCK,"Randy ""An Idealistic Realist""","[3, 4]","I went into watching this movie with common preconceptions such as Twilight being aimed towards teenage girls with little depth and entertainment value. While I agree that the former is a bit true, this film was quite entertaining overall.I think that the strongest parts of this movie were Bella Swan (Kristin Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). While I do not think that Stewart and Pattinson are the best actors ever, they were quite competent in their roles in my view. Stewart played a nave girl in love with a bad boy and Pattinson played the brooding vampire quite well. The story itself is a seemingly cut-out representation of teen love stories and vampire tales with some twists. An innocent girl is drawn to a dangerous-type boy and by overcoming misconceptions and the like, a love story ensues.However, I think that the weakest aspect of this film is the dialogue. It is a bit too cheesy to say the least. Conversations such as Swan telling Cullen that she never wants to be apart from him made me roll my eyes more than once. It is if the dialogue were taken directly from a Harlequin romance novel. And since this movie is about vampires, one would think that more biting and blood would be shown. It is rated PG-13 after all. Lastly, the action scenes were a bit overdone. While the baseball scene with Cullen and his family was interesting, the constant slowmo shots of him and his family flying everywhere was a little distracting and unnecessary. It's fun to watch I suppose, especially with Muse's ""Supermassive Black Hole"" playing in the background.Twilight was a good popcorn flick, but that's pretty much it. I for one tend to watch profound dramas that relate to life in some way without being melodramatic, and this film did not quite meet that ideal. It's a good film but is far from being a masterpiece. And who knows? Perhaps the producers realize this and just have fun exploiting that over-the-top aspect that makes up the majority of this film.

1204113,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B001IDZLCK,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[0, 0]","I had seen & heard all the hype surrounding this film, and at the behest of a friend, I went to see the movie. I was not disappointed! Although the main draw of this film--aimed at teens--are the vampire elements, it is, foremost, a love story...albeit an unusual one.Like the hugely successful ""Titanic"" a decade earlier, this is a deeply affecting romance, frought with teen angst, vampire lore, and dashes of humor. Of the latter, I don't know if the sprinkles of humor were all deliberate (it seemed CGI effects & character reactions caused the audience to snicker at times), ""Twilight"" overcomes these moments with sweeping (if brooding) emotion from its two lovers, Bella & Edward, as well as sweeping romantic moments of grandeur (much like ""Titanic""). We're somehow with Bella & Edward as his secret is uncovered by her, and they venture into a seemingly impossible romance, questioning their own sanity.As far as the performances of its two stars (Stewart & Pattinson), I've heard it all: ""He lacked intensity & seemed absurd"" or ""She's the worst actress"". My opinion: For young actors at the start of their careers, they handled their roles quite well. I've also heard the inevitable comparisons between book & film: ""The film's not as good"". No comment from me, because I've never read the book! I just know what I've seen, and I really enjoyed it (case in point: they're already working on the sequel).As with many a vampire saga, ""Twilight"" tries & succeeds in redefining what we know--or rather, seen--in preceding films. And since its targeted mainly at the teen crowd, the story reeks of the ""Now"" generation in camerawork, fashion & music.When I got the DVD, I watched it four times that week, mostly to catch all the little details in the story.

1204114,A9PRJA8LIZL9S,B001IDZLCK,Rantings Of a Girl,"[1, 3]","Overall, a movie that had a good cast but it lacked the ability to utilize that cast or create a visually provocative story, based I assume on bad directing and a badly written script.  And it had no edge, not in the writing, or the visual portrayal, which may go back to the author of the book.This movie was not as good as I expected it to be, based on all the media hype.  If you're expecting a ""Interview with the Vampire""or the TV series ""Vampire Diaries"", think again.  This one is more like ""Teen Beat"" magazine goes vampire.  Another reviewer used the word, cheesy, and I agree.First, I haven't read the book, so I can't compare it to the book.  Based on the movie, I would be curious to read if the book is any better.The story follows a young teenage girl as she moves to a new town, to live with her father, while her Mom is on a road trip with her new man who plays baseball.  Oh, and the father happens to be the local law in town.  So she starts a new school and has to try and fit in, when she notices the dark mysterious guy (aka the vampire) who appears to a such a jerk every time she's around him in class.  One thing leads to another, and they strike up a relationship, when he accidentally reveals that he is far from just another teenage boy.The things I didn't like, so much so I found them distracting, I thought the sparkling thing, was a tad, naive of the author of the book (maybe she is naive though).  In the movie, I thought the make-up for the vampire actors, was overboard.  They were stand out, white, which I attribute to bad make-up, like a bad clown job.  In poor taste whomever was responsible for going in that direction.  I also thought the floating thing, when they walked in a room, a bit overly dramatic.  I wasn't hooked on the characters, I wasn't drawn into wanting to get to know their world, which is either bad writing and or bad directing or both.  I didn't like Bella or Robert's character, really. And the bad guy characters, didn't strike me as really evil (could go back to the author on that one).  Nor was the spicy scenes, moving at all.  The movie felt forced and staged to me.The things I liked.  I really liked the Dad character, and the actor who played the dad was the most interesting character.  I like Taylor's character a lot too, though they make him somewhat a dweeb in this installment (not sure if that was on purpose or not).  I would see the next movie, just to see the Dad, and Taylor's character.Not a movie I would buy for my movie collection.",2,"Tea: It looks nice, but I find the flavor lacking..",1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,2517,"['Overall', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'cast', 'lacked', 'ability', 'utilize', 'cast', 'create', 'visually', 'provocative', 'story', 'based', 'assume', 'bad', 'directing', 'badly', 'written', 'script', 'had', 'edge', 'not', 'writing', 'visual', 'portrayal', 'may', 'go', 'back', 'author', 'book.This', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'expected', 'be', 'based', 'media', 'hype', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'TV', 'series', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'think', 'again', 'one', 'more', 'Teen', 'Beat', 'magazine', 'vampire', 'reviewer', 'used', 'word', 'cheesy', 'agree.First', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'book', 'Based', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'curious', 'read', 'book', 'better.The', 'story', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'new', 'town', 'live', 'father', 'Mom', 'road', 'trip', 'new', 'man', 'who', 'baseball', 'Oh', 'father', 'be', 'local', 'law', 'town', 'new', 'school', 'try', 'fit', 'when', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'guy', 'vampire', 'who', 'such', 'jerk', 'time', 'class', 'One', 'thing', 'strike', 'up', 'relationship', 'when', 'accidentally', 'far', 'just', 'teenage', 'boy.The', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'much', 'found', 'distracting', 'thought', 'sparkling', 'thing', 'was', 'tad', 'naive', 'author', 'book', 'maybe', 'naive', 'movie', 'thought', 'make-up', 'vampire', 'actors', 'was', 'overboard', 'were', 'stand', 'out', 'white', 'attribute', 'bad', 'make-up', 'bad', 'clown', 'job', 'poor', 'taste', 'whomever', 'was', 'responsible', 'going', 'direction', 'also', 'thought', 'floating', 'thing', 'when', 'walked', 'room', 'bit', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'was', ""n't"", 'hooked', 'characters', 'was', ""n't"", 'drawn', 'wanting', 'get', 'know', 'world', 'either', 'bad', 'writing', 'bad', 'directing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Bella', 'Robert', 'character', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'really', 'evil', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'author', 'one', 'was', 'spicy', 'scenes', 'moving', 'movie', 'felt', 'forced', 'staged', 'me.The', 'things', 'liked', 'really', 'liked', 'Dad', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'dad', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'like', 'Taylor', 'character', 'lot', 'too', 'make', 'somewhat', 'dweeb', 'installment', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'purpose', 'not', 'would', 'see', 'next', 'movie', 'just', 'see', 'Dad', 'Taylor', 'character.Not', 'movie', 'would', 'buy', 'movie', 'collection']",N/A

Girl still loves boy5. Audience suffers from a two hour cliche overloadThis is not a movie. It is a two hour moving photo shoot for Robert Pattinson. Now yes I have read the book and I thought it was decent- for what it was. It was cute, but it was incredibly flawed. Like for example, I am not a huge fan of the fact that she was all like ""BUT OMG! HE'S SO GORGEOUS! I WILL DATE HIM RIGHT NOW!"" A proper vampire romance would follow the rules and go ""Oh, I don't like you"" and then later ""I didn't know I'd love you this much"". It wasn't a bad book, it was pretty good. But then New Moon wasn't very good. Granted, it had some good parts, but had too much angsting. And Eclipse and Breaking Dawn just plain sucked.But anyways, this movie is so bad it makes the book look golden. Not only did they only adapt 20 minutes of the book, but also they screwed up the characters. And not to mention it was shot mostly in greys- making your eyes hurt the whole movie.Edward had gone from a charming and mysterious character who would make your spine tingle with fear to an emo boy with fangs. And Robert Pattinson's performance was so bad, it was Razzie worthy. His laughable covering up of his English accent was so obvious, in fact his English accent even slipped a few times. And Bella? I always imagined Bella as a shy and ordinary girl. But no, here, Stewart (actress who played her) goes through the motions as if she needs money desperately.The source material is pooed all over here in the worst sense. The meadow scene is the most important scene in the book because they both declare they love each other. And it takes up half a chapter too. Here, It's like 5 seconds long and them staring at each other. And the effects were so bad, they were laughable.Granted, the fight scene at the end is great, but other than that this is a waste of money.

1204129,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001IDZLCK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 7]","Twilight(Catherine Hardwicke, 2008)Having read Stephenie Meyer's insanely popular novel Twilight, I didn't really feel the need to see the movie, which I was reasonably sure that the film adaptation of it was going to be one of the worst movies of 2008. (Sure enough, it showed up on a smattering of the ten worst movies of 2008 lists.) I figured I didn't need to actually watch the silly thing to use it as a benchmark for the mediocrity of American film at the beginning of the new century. My wife, on the other hand, kept telling me that I wasn't allowed to attack the movie until I had actually seen it. As usual, my wife was right and I was wrong, so last night, I sat down and watched Twilight. Despite my initial, knee-jerk reaction when the adaptation was announced that it was going to be a bad movie, I'm having a hard time grasping just how much I underestimated the clawing, sucking awfulness that is the movie version of Twilight.In case you've been living on a Hittite commune for the past five years, here's a quick plot synopsis: Bella (The Safety of Objects' Kristen Stewart) leaves her mother's home in Phoenix, Arizona to go spend time with her father Charlie (Untraceable's Billy Burke) in Forks, Washington, distinguished by being the cloudiest, rainiest town in the continental United States (as one of the characters points out). The local school is small, and on her first day, everyone already knows who she is; she finds herself afflicted with a popularity she doesn't necessarily want, but falls in with a relatively harmless group. Until, that is, she looks up at lunch and catches the eye of Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson, from the more recent Harry Potter movies). Cue violins. (No, seriously, cue violins. The soundtrack is not subtle.) Problem is, Edward and his family are vampires, and the whole idea of a vampire and a human falling is love is taboo on so very many levels. And yet still, they must find a way to persevere, even after a rogue band of vampires (the evil vampires, as opposed to the good vampires, I guess) latch onto Bella as, seemingly, a particularly delectable morsel who would be perfect for an after-dinner mint.The movie's biggest problem is that it manages to take every existing flaw the book has and magnify it, while dampening the few things that book actually did right. Stephenie Meyer, while incapable of writing characters who have more than two dimensions (in fact, I think Twilight is the first time I considered writing about one-dimensional characters), is pretty darned good at plotting, and writes in such a way that no matter how much you despise the book's flaws, you keep turning the pages simply to find out what happens. She does this by skillfully interweaving a number of plots. Here, everything except the main plot--Bella and Edward's relationship, which segues into the mini-vampire-war--gets exceptionally short shrift. The tension that results, in the novel, from Bella's pursuit by a human suitor, Mike Newton (Michael Welch, from the recent Day of the Dead remake), is almost entirely absent; the only remnant of it we see is a snide comment from Newton in a scene that advances the Bella-Edward relationship. And Bella's relationship with Jacob (Cheaper by the Dozen 2's Taylor Lautner)? Well, you wouldn't know Jacob is one of Bella's oldest friends unless it had been mentioned in the opening moments. He pops up in four or five scenes, only one of which gives him enough lines to actually show that this kid can act.For that matter, with a few exceptions, the acting here is competent. Unfortunately, two of those exceptions are Stewart and Pattinson, but having seen Stewart in a few movies before, I know she's normally pretty good at this acting gig (The Safety of Objects is one of those movies that few people saw and everyone should have). I think a lot of the problem derives from the script (I don't need to address that again, do I?), and the rest of it from the motivations of these characters. While thousands upon thousands of words have been written about this topic already by much better-known and more articulate critics than me, I can't just ignore it. The character of Bella is, on many levels, offensive in today's climate. While this is kind of glossed-over in Twilight, it comes to the forefront in New Moon (the film adaptation of which is scheduled for release later this year); from the second Bella and Edward's eyes meet across that crowded room, Bella exists only for Edward. She immediately loses any sense of herself as an individual, and as a result, the audience also loses any sense of her as an individual. Great role model for modern girls! (I should also note that had this character been written by a man, there's a good possibility that the author would have been castigated, if not crucified, for portraying a woman, especially a minor, in such a negative light.) But back to my original conceit in this paragraph, which has to do with the acting. The other actor I normally find enjoyable who really drops the ball in this flick is Peter Facinelli, who plays Edward's foster father Carlisle. I've seen marmosets with more acting chops than Facinelli displays in this movie, and once again, I'm kind of confused; even in terrible movies, Facinelli usually brings enough to the table to stop them from being entirely unwatchable. Here, he's just pale and two-dimensional, and once again I guess I have to put it down to the script.So I guess it's time to castigate Melissa Rosenberg, who adapted Meyer's novel. She normally does TV work; in fact, this is only her second feature script. The first was Step Up, which should probably tell you everything you need to know. (But, really, she also writes for Dexter? I'm confused.) This was a hatchet job par excellence. If you're going to do something bad, make it remarkably bad, and Rosenberg rose to the occasion. From Rosenberg onto director Catherine Hardwicke, who started her career as a production designer under such luminaries Penelope Spheeris (subUrbia), Bill Fishman (Tapeheads), Mario van Peebles (Posse), and John Herzfeld (2 Days in the Valley). What on Earth happened? She stepped into the director's chair and lost any indie feeling that had to have rubbed off from working with such folks, and has since cranked out the overwrought and overrated Thirteen, Lords of Dogtown (for which I do not have enough expletives), and now this. One of the good decisions made when adapting New Moon was switching directors, though if you have to go from frying pan into fire, why not choose Chris Weitz, who destroyed the film adaptation of The Golden Compass? It doesn't matter how much my wife makes fun of me, there's no way I'm even going to consider watching that turkey unless I find myself stuck in a week when I haven't had a chance to write an awful review.My initial reaction was to give the movie zero stars, but I only do that when it was either so bad I abandoned it halfway through (which I have done with less than ten movies in my entire life) or when it is, in some way, patently offensive. Had Twilight been a fantastic book that got this bad an adaptation, it would have qualified on the latter criterion. But Twilight was not a fantastic book, it was a mediocre one, and so no matter how bad an adaptation it was, there's really not that much worse one could have made it. Sp when I give the movie half a star, don't think I'm doing so for any redeeming qualities. It's like leaving a one-cent tip for a particularly awful waiter. I cannot urge you enough, if you have suffered through this monstrosity, to go rent Let the Right One In, released in America at the same time as Twilight, covering much the same ground, and doing it orders of magnitude better. For months, I've been telling people that Let the Right One In is ""Twilight, but good."" Now I can say that with the authority of having watched Twilight. But I want those two hours of my life back.

She shivers and hugs herself in the cold damp air. She hears the faint fluttering of wings above her and two big gobs of white appear on the shoulder of her thread bare coat. ""Pigeons!"" she thinks.  Bella may be the purest maiden in town but not the brightest. Pigeons don't fly at night.

To be honest, once I finally sat down with her to watch it (she has many times already), it didn't do a heckuvalot for me.  There is an outcast girl, starting in a new high school after switching divorcee homes.  Stewart is very good at portraying the vulnerability of even starkly beautiful girls when they enter that arena of social predators.  Of course, she meets this unbearably handsome yet mysterious boy, with whom she shares the kind of affinity that appears only in youth, with first love.  There is no question that this resonates emotionally, against the backdrop of grissly murders that are being investigated by her father, a local cop.Of course, she discovers that the boy in a vampire, living with a group immortals who have decided they do not wish to prey on humans, though they are tempted.  Call them vegetarian vamps?  For all their super-human abilities and ethics, they feel bad about who they are, though they welcome the girl into their ""family"", which endangers her both because of their temptation to feed on her and the way that other, less nice vampires might want to take her.  A melee ensues, which makes the latter part of the film in an action movie.Where the story goes wrong, in my opinion, is that it tries to be deeper than a teen melodrama.  Beyond aching adolescent yearnings, it is a formula film, put together by a marketing committee rather than an auteur.  OK, I know that might sound pretentious, but why not hope for something more?  For myself, I could not help but compare it unfavorably to Interview with a Vampire (the novel, not the film) - Anne Rice's neurotic vampires are far more complex as characters and her evocation of historical context is second to none.  This is slanted to the teen market.The acting is also uneven.  Visually, everyone in the film is magazine-cover beautiful.  That's why my daughter has posters of them on her wall.  But they cannot occupy anything more than that two-dimensional space.  Beyond her pretty face, Stewart may have more than comicbook talent.  Pattison's character is weak, either because of his scripted part or his acting, I don't know; he does not quite succeed at creating an entire environment around himself, as great actors can do.REcommended for teens.

Constant crying and lame acting by a bunch of pale vamps that there only effort in the movie was to look as good as they can look! The love story was overdone and boring and the score was the worst iv'e heard in years for this kind of movie, and of course the ever so terrible special effects that really took this movie to an all time low considering what year this is and the amazing technology that we have these days. I seriously wasted my time with this one, i took a chance with the second movie and frankly i thought it was a tad bit better than this one effects were a little better if you're ok with cgi video game movies which is what it looks like, and of course some better actors involved and better story.

1204135,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001IDZLCK,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","***1/2The extent to which you'll enjoy ""Twilight"" may well depend on just how much romantic melodrama and teenage angst you can put up with in a two-hour period.Based on the insanely popular novel by Stephanie Meyer, this first in a series of tales dedicated to vampires and the-humans-who-love-them overdoses a bit on pasty faces and soulful ogling, but it still manages to revamp the genre in some unique and interesting ways.  For instance, these bloodsuckers can apparently move around and function in daylight, or at least subdued daylight, which is pretty easy to find in the perpetually overcast Pacific Northwest where the movie takes place.  Moreover, these vampires do not sleep in coffins and are able to thrive as well on animal blood as on human - it's just a matter of seeing the moral imperative to do so.Bella (Kristen Stewart) is a moody, seventeen-year-old high school student who comes to live with her police chief father (Billy Burke) after her mom (""24""'s Sarah Clarke) and step dad take off on an extended road trip across the country.  Almost immediately, Bella discovers that there's something not quite right about Edward (Robert Pattinson), the mysterious and darkly brooding boy who seems to have taken a more than casual liking to her.  As the feeling is mutual, Bella takes it upon herself to find out everything she can about the enigmatic lad, eventually discovering, with a little help from Google, that Edward is indeed one of the undead, albeit a dreamy one for a girl with a matching pallor who's already a bit emo herself.The self-loathing vampire, tormented by what he is and what he has to do to survive, has been a staple of the genre ever since Barnabas Collins hit the scene in the 1960s, and Edward certainly follows in that tradition.  The other thread the story pulls from is the doomed-teenage-romance theme a la ""Romeo and Juliet,"" only in this case the young lovers are separated not by warring families but by the fact that they hail from different species.  This brings the added complication to their relationship that if Edward becomes too uncontrolled in his passion for Bella, he might just wind up quite literally devouring her.  This sex-equals-death theme has always been a major and recurring subtext running right through vampire folklore, and the story does a nice job bringing it to the surface.The romantic moments are, for the most part, handled with tenderness and delicacy, and the scenes with Edward's ""family"" - who have all sworn off human blood and are trying to live at peace with their human neighbors - are some of the cleverest in the movie.  Moreover, the film generates a good deal of energy and suspense in its latter half, though it does tend to sag a bit in its closing moments.Written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by Catherine Hardwicke, ""Twilight"" isn't as sophisticated or imaginative as the similarly-themed ""True Blood,"" but for a tweenie romance with a supernatural twist, this ain't half bad.",3,enough new twists on the genre to overcome its inherent weaknesses,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,2982,"['***1/2The', 'extent', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Twilight', 'may', 'well', 'depend', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'romantic', 'melodrama', 'teenage', 'angst', 'can', 'put', 'up', 'two-hour', 'period.Based', 'insanely', 'popular', 'novel', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'first', 'series', 'tales', 'dedicated', 'vampires', 'the-humans-who-love-them', 'overdoses', 'bit', 'pasty', 'soulful', 'ogling', 'still', 'revamp', 'genre', 'unique', 'interesting', 'ways', 'instance', 'bloodsuckers', 'can', 'apparently', 'move', 'around', 'function', 'daylight', 'least', 'subdued', 'daylight', 'pretty', 'easy', 'find', 'perpetually', 'overcast', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'where', 'movie', 'place', 'Moreover', 'vampires', 'do', 'not', 'sleep', 'coffins', 'are', 'able', 'thrive', 'as', 'well', 'animal', 'blood', 'human', 'just', 'matter', 'seeing', 'moral', 'imperative', 'do', 'so.Bella', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'moody', 'seventeen-year-old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'live', 'police', 'chief', 'father', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'mom', '24', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'step', 'dad', 'take', 'off', 'extended', 'road', 'trip', 'country', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'Bella', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'Edward', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'mysterious', 'darkly', 'brooding', 'boy', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'casual', 'liking', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'Bella', 'find', 'out', 'everything', 'can', 'enigmatic', 'lad', 'eventually', 'discovering', 'little', 'help', 'Google', 'Edward', 'indeed', 'one', 'undead', 'dreamy', 'one', 'girl', 'matching', 'pallor', 'who', 'already', 'bit', 'emo', 'herself.The', 'self-loathing', 'vampire', 'tormented', 'what', 'what', 'do', 'survive', 'been', 'staple', 'genre', 'ever', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'hit', 'scene', '1960s', 'Edward', 'certainly', 'tradition', 'other', 'thread', 'story', 'pulls', 'doomed-teenage-romance', 'theme', 'la', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'only', 'case', 'young', 'lovers', 'are', 'separated', 'not', 'warring', 'families', 'fact', 'hail', 'different', 'species', 'added', 'complication', 'relationship', 'Edward', 'too', 'uncontrolled', 'passion', 'Bella', 'might', 'just', 'wind', 'up', 'quite', 'literally', 'devouring', 'sex-equals-death', 'theme', 'always', 'been', 'major', 'recurring', 'subtext', 'running', 'right', 'vampire', 'folklore', 'story', 'nice', 'job', 'bringing', 'surface.The', 'romantic', 'moments', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'handled', 'tenderness', 'delicacy', 'scenes', 'Edward', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'sworn', 'off', 'human', 'blood', 'are', 'trying', 'live', 'peace', 'human', 'neighbors', 'are', 'cleverest', 'movie', 'Moreover', 'film', 'good', 'deal', 'energy', 'suspense', 'latter', 'half', 'tend', 'sag', 'bit', 'closing', 'moments.Written', 'Melissa', 'Rosenberg', 'directed', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'Twilight', ""n't"", 'as', 'sophisticated', 'imaginative', 'similarly-themed', 'True', 'Blood', 'tweenie', 'romance', 'supernatural', 'twist', 'ai', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad']",N/A

Its like a less sophisticated Romeo and Juliet love story that pulls you in by your loins and won't let go. I feel stupid even admitting what I said above but it is the truth.Unfortunately this movie barely captured any of what made Twilight so amazing to read. The connection between Edward and Bella is lacking. In the book she burns for him and there is conflict in her emotions but on screen Bella is really monotone. I think this monotone, lack of connection throws the actor playing Edward off in certain scenes. Hopefully with the new director they can help the actress playing Bella delve deeper into the character for New Moon.To rap up as a movie or even living up to the book, casting was terrible in most places, wardrobe obviously hadn't read the book, and they could have done so much more with the script. In no way did they capture the essence of Twilight which made it a disappointment for me having read the series and for someone who hasn't read the books it would be just done right annoying to waste the money on a bad movie.There is hope for the 2nd movie in form of a new director.

Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have undeniable chemistry, smoldering and nearly explosive at first, but intense throughout.  There are some lyrical moments of dangerous romance threaded through the narrative, which include flights of fancy and tenderness.  But the movie's most hypnotic quality is its mashing up of two disparate elements: real life, as seen through the slighty grungy, rainy, real-life look and feel of the Pacific Northwest; the high school's generic, realistic interiors; the sad-sweet relationship Bella shares with her family - and the surreal, darkly horrific undead, who walk freely within this world.  As our protagonist, Kristen Stewart is the perfect blend of pretty, smart, melancholy and achingly romantic - she brings it all together, and causes your heart to ache.

1204158,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B001IDZLCK,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[8, 10]","As a proud Twilight Mom, I joined the Twilight Saga obsession in February of 2008, where I gleefully followed the Twilight Mom forum's detailed posts and pics on Twilight set visits, interviews with the film's stars, and behind-the-scenes gossip.  When Summit Entertainment began shooting, they had no idea of the rabid fanbase that was about to crash down on them; for further proof, watch the Comic-Con bonus footage. I was well familiar with Twilight, having read all the novels in the series, and was eager to see Edward and Bella's story brought to life on the big screen. I was a little nervous; Summit was a small company with a smallish budget (the original Twilight budget was $28 million), and the film's young stars (Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Ashley Greene, Nikki Reed, Kellan Lutz, Taylor Lautner) were largely unknown at the time.As I read the behind-the-scenes stories of filming, I felt little prickles of unease at the early makeup photos (yes, the horrible white pancake makeup looks just as bad in the final cut), the underwhelming special effects (lots of wirework that looks cartoonish), and the costuming choices (none of the chic, expensive designer clothes from the original novel, and the cars were changed as well). The film's teaser trailers did little to quell my unease; the early scenes felt awkward and were missing the magic of the original novel.I held out on viewing Twilight  until its release on DVD. After renting it, I can safely say that Twilight is unfortunately mediocre; it fails to reach out to Twihards and will confuse those who haven't read the novel, as the screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg  omitted key scenes in favor of poor substitutes. The film condenses several hundred pages into a two-hour film, so it's understandable that some scenes from the book were cut. What I couldn't fathom was the decision to remove key scenes in favor of strange substitutes; scenes that cemented Bella and Edward's blossoming relationship such as the blood typing scene were swapped for a boring field trip on composting, or instead of having Bella cook for her father Charlie, they eat at a local diner several times a day (which enabled Stephenie Meyer to a brief cameo as a diner patron; she's sitting at the bar).The film gets more wrong than it gets right; Kristen Stewart comes off as aloof and standoffish as Bella, and when she's not shrugging people off, she looks like she's in pain.  Book Bella was clumsy and awkward, but she tried to be good to her friends and family. Movie Bella is an ice queen. Robert Pattinson certainly makes for nice eye candy as Edward, but again, there's a sense of awkwardness in many key scenes. One of the worst was Bella and Edward's fateful introduction in Biology; in the book, Edward is absolutely rigid with fury; he radiates hatred towards Bella in his body language. Movie Edward looks more like he has food poisoning; physically nauseated but not a man struggling with his inner demons. Patttison's facial expressions feel forced in many scenes. His accent is the least of his problems; he managed to smooth over his native British accent with a bland, generic ""American"" one.The supporting actors in the Cullen family were shamefully underutilized; Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) in particular looks constipated throughout the film. In the book version, Jasper is tormented by being the newest vampire in the family, and the most likely to lose control, hence his tension around humans. But there's no explanation of that, or his gift of being able to control emotions of those around him.So many important scenes were cut or otherwise modified that the story doesn't make any sense. We're not treated to the gradual day-by-day development of Bella and Edward's relationship; Edward is shooting daggers at Bella one moment, then they're engaging in some hot kissing the next. Pardon? For those that haven't read the book, this fast-forward relationship makes little sense. There's no reason for Bella to like Edward in the film; he's rude, cold and standoffish. One of the more unforgivable sins is the changing of the pivotal meadow scene where Edward reveals his secret to Bella. In the book, it's a beautiful scene full of discovery and romance, but the cheap ""sparkle"" special effects and the screenplay's dark, twisted take on the scene make it tense and uncomfortable instead of wondrous.The handheld camera was dizzying at times, with MTV editing that made my head spin. Some of the scenes really clicked, like the baseball scene, which was a great blend of action and special effects. But most of the time, the angst-ridden soundtrack blared much too loudly over the dialogue and was used unnecessarily to convey emotion where solid screenwriting would have sufficed.I can only hope that the addition of a new director, Chris Weitz, takes the sequel New Moon in a more positive direction. Pattinson and Stewart might really have a chance to shine with better direction, and the film's larger budget may smooth out the glaring cheapness of the special effects. I really wanted to like Twilight, and it's not a bad little film, but it feels far too indie and cheap to satisfy the millions of devoted Twilight fans that were counting on it to be true to the book.Note: I watched this as a Video On Demand download. The picture quality was decent, but the download was huge (2.2 GB) and took over eight hours to download.

The acting is just so-so, the story is a little convoluted and to top it all off the friggin vampires sparkle in the sunlight. All that being said, you really can't help being drawn into this world and these characters. The movies may lack a little when it comes to vampire lore, but the whole package somehow just works. The high-def transfers look really good, and my only complaint about the discs is that the dialogue always seems overpowered by the score, even when run through a home theater system.",4,Guilty pleasure,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,850,"['wife', 'had', 'been', 'hinting', 'while', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'latest', 'movie', 'Twilight', 'saga', 'theater', 'basic', 'notion', 'being', 'vampires', 'had', 'idea', 'backstory', 'So', 'Amazon', 'went', 'picked', 'up', 'Blu-Ray', 'releases', 'thus', 'far', 'hate', 'admit', 'movies', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'acting', 'just', 'so-so', 'story', 'little', 'convoluted', 'top', 'friggin', 'sparkle', 'sunlight', 'being', 'said', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'drawn', 'world', 'characters', 'movies', 'may', 'lack', 'little', 'when', 'vampire', 'lore', 'whole', 'package', 'somehow', 'just', 'works', 'high-def', 'transfers', 'look', 'really', 'good', 'only', 'complaint', 'discs', 'dialogue', 'always', 'overpowered', 'score', 'even', 'when', 'run', 'home', 'theater', 'system']",N/A

She's a social nerd with no coordination and an inability to make friends.  So far, just like the book.The movie jumps quickly from scene to scene.  The characters she meets in school are wooden, lifeless.  The director does not have us care about any of them.  One kid asks Bella to the prom.  Do we care she ignores him as she stares at Edward?  Nope.And even when Edward talks with her, little eye contact, lots of innendo and insults.  And that's just the first 20 minutes!There are a few unexplained scenes of one guy getting killed and a deer being jumped on, but the viewer hopes these will be explained later.Actually the high school kids look way more fun.  Why do we have to engage with the depressed, inept Bella?I guess this movie will appeal to socially inept teenage girls who don't have a clue about how to survive high school.Horror fans, stay clear.  I'm cancelling my Tiger Beat subscription now.The only positive points:  The Indian reservation with the Indian guys and friends, they were the most interesting of the characters.  The rival pack of vampires was somewhat conflicting and gave some meat to the storyline.The townsfolk being hunted and killed by rogue vampires was not in the book but was a welcome addition since the book was for the most part the worst, sappy teenage slop I've ever read.Some romance -- she's the coldest fish and he loves to stare with those droopy puppy dog eyes.  Yuk.Feels like a college film school project than an actual romantic horror film.The Cullens on the other hand had enough white pancake on their face to make Paris Hilton jealous.From the Baseball Scene, follows the book fairly faithfully -- except no airport scene -- the mirror scene was pretty good.  Despite almost getting killed by vampires, she wants to be a vampire herself, throw her life away and live for eternity with Edward, whom she'll probably break up with before she's 18.Not recommended.",1,Twilight Zoned -- Ann Rice Lite!,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,2029,"['Twilight', 'ZonedBella', 'away', 'Phoenix', 'be', 'dad', 'Forks', 'WA', 'place', 'clearly', 'social', 'nerd', 'coordination', 'inability', 'make', 'friends', 'So', 'far', 'just', 'book.The', 'movie', 'jumps', 'quickly', 'scene', 'scene', 'characters', 'school', 'are', 'wooden', 'lifeless', 'director', 'not', 'have', 'care', 'One', 'kid', 'Bella', 'prom', 'Do', 'care', 'Edward', 'Nope.And', 'even', 'when', 'Edward', 'little', 'eye', 'contact', 'lots', 'innendo', 'insults', 'just', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'few', 'unexplained', 'scenes', 'one', 'guy', 'getting', 'killed', 'deer', 'being', 'jumped', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'explained', 'later.Actually', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'look', 'way', 'more', 'fun', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'engage', 'depressed', 'inept', 'Bella', 'guess', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'socially', 'inept', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'survive', 'high', 'school.Horror', 'fans', 'stay', 'clear', ""'m"", 'cancelling', 'Tiger', 'Beat', 'subscription', 'only', 'positive', 'points', 'Indian', 'reservation', 'Indian', 'guys', 'friends', 'were', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'rival', 'pack', 'vampires', 'was', 'somewhat', 'conflicting', 'gave', 'meat', 'storyline.The', 'townsfolk', 'being', 'hunted', 'killed', 'rogue', 'vampires', 'was', 'not', 'book', 'was', 'welcome', 'addition', 'book', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'worst', 'sappy', 'teenage', 'slop', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read.Some', 'romance', 'coldest', 'fish', 'stare', 'droopy', 'puppy', 'dog', 'eyes', 'Yuk.Feels', 'college', 'film', 'school', 'project', 'actual', 'romantic', 'horror', 'film.The', 'Cullens', 'other', 'hand', 'had', 'enough', 'white', 'pancake', 'face', 'make', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Baseball', 'Scene', 'book', 'fairly', 'faithfully', 'airport', 'scene', 'mirror', 'scene', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'almost', 'getting', 'killed', 'vampires', 'be', 'vampire', 'throw', 'life', 'away', 'live', 'eternity', 'Edward', 'whom', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'break', 'up', '18.Not', 'recommended']",N/A

I haven't read the ""Twilight"" books; I'm guessing they have to be better than this movie was. Vampires have always been my favorite genre in horror - and honestly, this movie sucks - no pun intended. It doesn't have any of the traditional vampire thrills - the fangs, the coffins, the crosses, and they have reflections and walk freely in the daylight. Other than knowing they drink blood - this really isn't a vampire movie...at least in the traditional sense.A high school girl (Kristen Stewart) falls in love with a vampire boy, etc. ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (the series) already did that theme...and did it better. Robert Pattison is a horrible actor and pitiful vampire character. His white face paint is so overdone and appears to end at his jaw line - in some scenes he looks like he's wearing a mask. And then there is the uncontrolled bed head hair that adds to his clown-like appearance.The special effects had us laughing too - especially the scene when Pattison piggy backs Kristen Stewart up a steep mountain path in hyper speed. Then there is the vampire baseball game. And we can't leave out the ""dinner party"" that Pattison's vampire family prepared for his mortal girlfriend on their first meeting.

1204166,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B001IDZLCK,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 5]","Unlike many, I have not read the ""Twilight"" novels by Stephanie Meyer.  Perhaps I'm cowardly, but I fear the derisive smirks of my fellow Portlanders as I walk down the city streets carrying what has been extensively marketed as a Teenage Girl Novel, which just isn't my demographic as a Man of a Certain Age.But I am tempted as I feel a strong connection to her books - I grew up in Port Angeles, Washington and spent much of my childhood exploring the Olympic Peninsula, which means that I am very familiar with the tiny burg of Forks.  My childhood best friend moved there, and during visits we explored the rain forest, La Push, and other areas highlighted in the movie.  Indeed, when I returned to P.A. for my high school reunion this summer, my family and I had dinner in the restaurant where Bella ate dinner with Edward after her big scare, and the party was held in a building with a ""Twilight"" memorabilia store in it.For someone who has grown up on the drizzly, isolated Olympic Peninsula, words cannot express the thrill I have that the nation is captivated by a story from our gorgeous neck of the rain forest.  And ""Twilight"" gets it right.  Too many films shot in Seattle (""Wargames,"" ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" ""Disclosure"") choose to film only from July though October 1 so they can be guaranteed sunny days, causing many to wonder about our legendary rainfall.  ""Twilight,"" for obvious reasons, shows the Pacific Northwest in all its dripping green glory, although it must be said that much of what passes for Forks is actually shot in the Columbia Gorge not too far from Hood River (about 45 miles from Portland).  Shooting in rain and clouds is trickier than shooting in sunshine - the lighting is harder, but the filmmakers do magnificent work here.  Although I have to admit that the scenes that allegedly take place in Port Angeles must have been filmed elsewhere, as these scenes show a village much more charming than my blue-collar, ramshackle hometown.Why do I spend so much time on geography?  Because the geography is at the heart of this movie.  Bella (Kristen Stewart) starts the movie in Arizona but returns to her divorced dad's humble pad in Forks.  The shift from sun to gray is striking.  As an outsider in a tiny town, Bella is an instant celebrity in her high school (a social dynamic I remember all too well when new kids moved to P.A.).  But Bella is a pale damsel - one of her friends asks her why she isn't gloriously tan like everyone else in Arizona.  Indeed, Bella looks so washed out and stressed that you think she's one step removed from the loony bin.But she looks positively radiant compared to the Cullens, a mysterious band of teens who keep to themselves despite their obvious charisma, wealth, and good looks.  And Bella swoons for Edward (Robert Pattinson), who seems oddly repulsed by her at first, but then . . .Well, this well-known plot needs no summary here.  I will only say that the film gets teen angst just right as they did with atmosphere.  Bella and Edward will never reach the rhetorical and poetic heights of Romeo and Juliet - they are realistically tongue-tied in the face of their overwhelming mutual attraction.  Like most teens, they cannot put their feelings into words (although we might expect a little better from Edward, given the amount of time he's been 17).  Instead, the attraction is communicated through yearning, that soul-crushing awareness of someone else's hold on your heart.  In this department Stewart and Pattinson have excellent chemistry and hit most of the notes just right.The movie, as I said before, looks magnificent.  The Pacific Northwest cannot be topped for rugged beauty, but I must admit that it can be a forbidding place.  The film captures that beauty while using the rain and clouds to generate the necessary sense of foreboding.  We are, after all, talking about vampires here.Kudos to all involved - what could have been a pedestrian teen romance with a vampire angle is instead an enjoyable, atmospheric movie about (potentially) star-crossed lovers.

For a novel that was so emotionally gripping they somehow managed to suck absolutely any and all feeling out of it with their cardboard facial expressions and placid voices, every line sounds exactly the same as the line before it; how are we supposed to believe them in love when they react the same to lunch as they do to one another?Stepping back from the lack of any romantic feelings whatsoever (which is actually made pointedly worse by the fact that the two leads are dating in real life; acting like a couple in love *should* have been a no-brainer right?)The rest of the movie drags on in awkward silence, stilted cuts and angles. The awkward lack of background music and/or soundtrack is separated only by a single song from Muse that really does nothing to save the otherwise drab and frankly boring movie.Truthfully, after this movie came out I couldn't bear to even look at the books again because Stephanie Meyer not only allowed this movie to happen, but then she praised it.

My suspicions were right when I got to watch it yesterday: it sucked! What's all the zoom-in close-ups of the lead actor and actress? Whatever hyped up expectations of the marketing agencies, I guess they must have made misplaced fantasies come true for this movie.For those of you who have yet to watch this Part 1 of the ""saga"", it's about a lonely human teenage girl who moves into a small town of over 3000 people where she meets a lonely teenage male vampire at school. The kind of fantasy that most female fantasy writers like to muse over when they have too much to escape from in everyday mundane reality of our modern world. Guys, if you want to know how dirty minded women are, just read all their trashy ""romance"" novels and their ""fantasy"" novels.In this movie, a lonely human girl falls in love with a male vampire who turns out somewhat to be a ""vegetarian"" vampire and can't resist the girl. Male saves female from accident and gradually introduces her to his vampire family. According to him, he is ""too weak to resist"" her. He can't read her mind like he can with other humans. He stalks her but she doesn't see it as stalking because she falls for him. She gets corners one night in a deserted area by a bunch of human male perverts. Male vampire springs from his stalking mode to savior mode, saves the girl, takes her to dinner, becomes her instant hero and her automatic boyfriend! (Wow! A stalker now becomes her boyfriend in a blink of an eye! Is that why/how human girls get themselves into so much trouble these days?!) In a vampire family baseball game, other more blood-thirsty competing vampires, one in particular, stumbles upon the human girl, sniffs her out and hunts her down. Protective vampire male tries to save human female again, and finds her in time. His family members appear and take care of the attacking blood-thirsty vampire. Case closed, or so we may think. Yada, yada, yada, you know how these fantasy tales end. If you're an avid reader of fantasy novels, they all have the same theme and similar sounding escapades. Nothing new or spectacular, very predictable genre.If not the seemingly humble Kristen Stewart, this movie doesn't even deserve a single star rating! This is one Kristen Stewart movie I won't want to remember! Sorry, Kristen, you fared better in ""The Messengers"". If you want to explore your dark side, come chat with me, not with this Robert guy.Can someone please tell me what is so attractive about the lead actor, Robert?Why are so many teenage girls swooning over him these days? Is it the guy Robert himself, his faint British accent, what about his looks that is so attractive to girls who make up his fan base and give this movie 5 stars? Would Brad Pitt of ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" fame have gotten the same attention if he played vampire in this movie, instead of that Robert guy? Or, do 21st century teenage human girls just love ""any actor"" who paints his skin white and plays a Hollywood movie vampire? Seriously, I'm curious! Maybe I could star in the next vampire movie series! LOL!I'd rather read a good novel anytime as opposed to watching a movie. I suggest you do the same. Most of the time, the novels speak of tales more vividly than a movie that tries to imitate it. Compare Stephen King's book ""Carrie"" to the movie of that same name. The novel is much more enjoyable.Viewers! If I can think of a good romance fantasy movie involving vampires and stuff, I'll let you know! Do you guys like foreign language movies? I don't think you can find them on Amazon.com.If you're still trying to recover from the ""Twilight"" fever, please watch ""Vampires Suck"" (a spoof of the ""Twilight"" series) and all seasons of ""Vampire Diaries"", they so much superior in production compared to the Hollywood mogul-financed ""Twilight"" deception.Recommended reading/viewing:CarrieCarrie (Special Edition)Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)The Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity)Vampires SuckThe Vampire Diaries: The Complete First SeasonThe Vampire Diaries: The Complete Second SeasonThe Vampire Diaries: The Complete Third Season",1,"Agonizing watch!

If they would have added it, the movie would have rivaled ""The Lord of the Rings"" in duration. Face it in our day and age not many of us are willing to sit through 4 plus hours. So I feel that they kept very true to the spirit of the story, they did leave out some small things but, hey I can go back and read it in the books again.While I wouldn't have cast the two main characters they did with that actress and actor, they did a great job and stayed true to their characters.

About 75 percent of the time, it's the director and the author talking, which is okay the first time around. But I wanted to see far more Jacob and Edward, and Jacob is barely shown. Edward (Robert Pattinson) has small snippets, but he mainly runs his finger through his hair and talks about how he can't hear because of all the screaming. It was cool to see the vampires from out of town and watch the baseball scene though. But this isn't something I'd want to watch twice. I wasn't really interested in watching the chummy relationship between the director and the author. More Jacob. More Edward. More of the cast from the movie.The Movie: Initially I couldn't get into ""Twilight"" because I watched ""Eclipse"" first. I'd never heard of ""Twilight"" books or movies until the third one came out, and after I saw the third movie because nothing else was playing, I became a fan. However, watching the movies out of order may have worked against me. Because the special effects in ""Eclipse"" were so much better, the ones in ""Twilight"" looked too fake. Even with the wiring, it looked like someone was just pressing the fast forward button, not natural quick movements. The main issue was Edward going around the car. Nothing about that looked realistic.I don't remember Tyler kissing Bella in the book so that part caught my attention, but the movie wasn't a complete copycat of the book so I let it slide. If I missed that part in the book, let me know. The guy who played Tyler was entertaining to say the least. I kept laughing whenever he was around because he seemed to be having the most fun at all times. Kristen did a great job of playing Bella, but in interviews she looks this uncomfortable so I'm wondering is it acting or is this just her. Either way, she played her part. Although I am Team Jacob and didn't see too much of Jacob in this film, I enjoyed watching Taylor run down the backstory of how werewolves and vampires reached a treaty. Robert Pattinson clearly was the best person to play the role of Edward, and he played that to a tea. He's fascinating during interviews though because he doesn't seem to have anything in common with Edward, so it was nice to see him go into a role unfamiliar to him.The first time I saw the movie, I didn't like it much. But I gave it another shot and enjoyed it much more. I like the ""Twilight"" book better than the movie, but the movie was pretty good, too. I think ""New Moon"" and ""Eclipse"" were better though. We got to see more dynamics from the characters.

I love how Stephanie Meyers did the point of view in the first film/book. Seems to me that she could have put four books into three at the most. I understand her putting Jacob as the main feature in the second book. I do not like how she incorporated Jacob's point of view though. She could have done that differently and perhaps better.  She never incorporates Edwards except through what he says. Which is fine but wrong in this instance given that she did for Jacob. This is a triangle relationship that changes. All or nothing sweety.The film: oi! HOW DOES a camera manage to make an actor's face look flat? And the scene in the forest where Belle first confronts Edwards, could have been done better. The piano playing scene... very nice! The shots of the environment were awesome. The scene where Belle is about to be schmucked by a run away van on ice... very nice. There's a certain flavor in the way most of the film was done that was good. The make up person... fire him/her now. Edward should not look like he's wearing lipstick. And Rosalie's make up needs some work too. Alice Green's/Alice's make up was good. Sorry for the nitpicking but these really stood out in the film.Where Edward growls at the miscreants going after Belle... not much of a growl or menace there.. at least until he got into the car and then yes! The fighting scene towards the end... VERY NICE! And finally... the very last scene.. very good.For the most part there was more good or bad. Unfortunately, some parts did stand out for me that kind of detracted from it.I'm hoping that Chris fixes some of that in the next film. High approval in his choice for Martin Sheen in playing Aro. Not so much approval for Dakota Fanning being in it.

The movies for the Potter book were entertaining for anyone who went and saw it, not just the kids who the books were for.  The first half of Twilight is straight up ""after school special"" quality.  Its embarrassing.  Moreover, the actors in Twilight make Harry Potter's actors seem vastly more skilled and professional in comparison.

The Bella of the book is incredibly dull, and spurns healthy relationships in favour of an unhealthy one. Action is an occasional irrelevance and humour non existant. The brilliance of this film is that the screen writers have managed to move the rather slow story along at a somewhat better pace. The boring middle of the story almost vanishes, and the cinematography shows the bauty of the Pacific North West nicely. I almost enjoyed this movie, but not quite.What Twilight lacks is comic relief. The old phrase ""you laughed, you cried"" could be half true with Twilight if you really get into the characters. Alternatively the tears could be shed at the missed opportunity. Ultimately though if you want Vampire love stories that are fast, funny and intrguing, then you really want Buffy or Angel. Twilight is a poor second best to either of these.If you want a gritty vampire story, that will stir you up and keep you rivetted to your seat, then I think The Lost Boys is better.If you want a tear jerker, then there are so many better stories.

However, after watching it, I find that its for everybody from various age groups. I think this is why this movie and the books has done so well because it stretched beyond teenagers to various age groups. I also think the books as well as movies has a good storyline to it. I feel all young and old females can learn a lesson from these books. We as woman deserve to be treated like we are Queens. What is so appealing about this movie is Edwards treatment of Bella, he loves her more than himself, he would die to protect her. His love is selfless and pure. This is how men should  treat woman. This is how marriage and everlasting love and commitment should be. In todays world of divorce, abuse and relationship drama, this is a great example of love! I am however a little disappointed. Even though I loved the movie. Loved the actors that portray Bella and Edward. I felt that the movie did not do the book justice. This is a beautiful love story and some of the most important chapters that should have been in the movie was not.

Her first day of school goes well due to friendly classmates but then she encounters a young man, Edward, who glares at her with feral scorn--his black eyes sparkle with offense when she is near. She determines to confront his rudeness. But the next time she sees him he is oddly courteous and sincere. As they get to know one another Bella discovers that Edward has super strength and can even read minds. But when she is shocked by the icy cold of his hand she knows the truth. He is a vampire.Edward's mystery, beauty and old-fashioned manners are irresistible to Bella. He makes a chivalrous attempt to stay away from Bella to protect her from the vampire world, but it is too late for both of them because are deeply in love. Bella and Edward have a forbidden love. They belong to warring families. Like Romeo and Juliet their passion is intensified by transgression against norms of their heritage.  Bella is relieved to learn that the family of vampires Edward is a part of is unusual; they are ""vegetarian"" vampires, meaning they only drink the blood of animals.Edward and Bella spend idyllic hours romancing in the mossy green redwood forests. Physical touching is almost impossible because Edward must continually fight against his fierce instinct to drink her human blood. But their hearts touch through their eyes. Edward's tender yet ardent courtship of Bella is poignant and tantalizing. Then Bella is threatened by becoming the target of a rogue predatory vampire. This predatory vampire is tantalized by the challenge of a battle of wits and skill against Edward and his family, who unite to protect Bella.Meyer's brilliant Twilight series introduced a fresh new vampire world into the genre. And in the movie the freshness continues. Filmed in gorgeous redwood forests, it is startling to see vampires in the sunlit meadows yet seeing them in light does not make them less mysterious or menacing. The young actors in this film are well cast; beautiful but unusual. Their characters are not shallow teens; these are complex young adults that care deeply about their lives, friends and family. Bella, played with intensity and verisimilitude by lovely Kristen Stewart, is a worthy and courageous hero who does not hesitate to put her own life in danger to protect her mother and her father. Despite the fact that she is just a frail human she fights back against supernatural and human predators. Edward is equally interesting as he is physically seventeen but is much older in years. Yet Bella is his first love and he is terribly concerned that he will cause her harm. Oddly handsome Robert Pattinson plays Edward with magnetism and aching vulnerability.  Kudos to the rest of the actors, particularly kind-faced Peter Facinelli as Carlyle, sensitive Billy Burke as Bella's father, captivating Justin Chon as Erik Yorkie, piquant Christian Serratos as Angela Weber, striking Gil Birmingham as Billy Black--I could go on and on the casting was excellent.Brilliant director Catherine Hardwicke matched the beauty of the ancient forests with the emotional tone of the scenes with authority and confidence. Though I have not seen this director's other films I look forward to seeing her work.Twilight the movie has had to make choices to adapt Meyer's huge novel to the screen yet no sacrifice of quality has been made. The movie sensitively portrays the thoughtful and passionate characters created by Meyer while it enthralls and entertains with its contemplative beauty. Vampires symbolize the primal drives in all of us but in Twilight we are introduced to vampires who choose to put aside these urgent desires to avoid harm. Tender love and care are portrayed as the greatest power of them all.Seen it twice and can't wait to see it again.

It includes the two-disc Special Edition plus a bonus disc with over 45 minutes of additional never-before-seen content.Before seeing the movie ""Twilight"" I had haphazardly read someone's criticism of it, that particular viewer describing the proceedings as ""cheese, cheese and more cheese"".  After viewing the film for myself, I feel put upon to clarify things by introducing the Cheese Scale (listed in low-end to high-end):Swiss - nutty and bittersweet but has delicate flavorLimburger -unappetizing at first exposure but leaves a good taste in your mouth in the endCheddar - rich and strong, sometimes overwhelming everything elseVelveeta - Thick and overbearing with a lingering aftertasteCheez Whiz - So processed it should never be consumed by anyone""Twilight"" is mid-way on the Cheese Scale with a ""Cheddar"" rating, sometimes bordering on ""Velveeta"".  Teens will gobble up this high-fat, high-calorie block of romance with crackers while adults will be cringing from its pungency.  There are vampire movies that have been done far better (""Interview With The Vampire"" is a stellar example) but this is something of author Stephenie Meyer's creation and caters to the young adult crowd, hence the melodrama and maudlin delivery of its main actors.Bella (Stewart), a withdrawn teenager, is moving to Forks, WA to live with her dad after her mother remarries a minor-league ballplayer.  On her first day attending a new high school a boy named Edward Cullen (Pattinson) immediately intrigues her but he is unusually repulsed by her.  After a weeklong absence he returns to school and Bella confronts him, only to encounter a much friendlier person than she expected.  Incredibly handsome but secretive, Edward warns her to stay away from him but Bella is only further intrigued and a dangerous romance blossoms between the two even after she discovers that he is a preternatural being, a ""cold one"" - a vampire.  Their relationship is met with friction from both sides, Edward's extended ""family"" both alarmed and curious about their coupling and family friends Jacob (Lautner) and Billy Black (Birmingham) strangely adverse.  The tension mounts when a vampire named James (Gigandet) arrives with two other companions and decides to make Bella the thrill of the hunt after catching her intoxicating scent.  Can Edward fend off the demented James while resisting his own thirst for Bella's blood?More than half of Twilight's cast underacts or overacts their parts and I don't know whether this is the fault of the screenplay (Rosenberg, who has written for several television shows) or the director.  Catherine Hardwicke (who made her directorial debut in 2003 with the angsty coming-of-age film ""Thirteen"") worked closely with Meyer in bringing the story to the screen and what results is lovely artistic vision with trite theatrics.  Kristen Stewart is tiresome as Bella, giving less when she should be giving more and mumbling over half her lines.  A shy, clumsy introvert in the book, Stewart does nothing to imbue Bella with any personality (she has more personality in the behind-the-scenes interviews, I'm sorry to say) and continues to keep people guessing why in the world Edward is so interested in her.  Pattinson's portrayal of Edward is irksome as well - he broods, leers and breathes a great deal of dialogue instead of just speaking it.  This is not at all the Edward I read about and there is not near enough of his playful, sarcastic and dangerous side shown.  It's also not a good example of Pattinson's talent so do take care to overlook this performance and seek his other - and better - work.  Supporting players range from ho-hum to pretty good; Cam Gigandet makes a convincing villain as James, Lautner is perfectly buoyant as Jacob, Birmingham makes a small role memorable as Billy Black and Facinelli is down-to-earth as Carlisle. Meyer herself makes a cameo appearance in a diner (no lines - she didn't want to ""screw up"" the movie), coincidentally working on ""Breaking Dawn"" as she sits in front of her laptop computer perched atop the bar.The film does have one incontestably beautiful thing going for it, aside from its attractive cast.  The cinematography is stunning, showing off the best and most scenic parts of Washington (Mount St. Helens, Columbia River Gorge, Washougal) and Oregon (Cannon Beach, Sandy River Gorge).  Cold and gray beaches with briny surf, towering pine forests and rocky crags dappled with brilliant green moss litter the screen and are breathtaking.  The locales are complimented by superbly subtle visual effects that add semi-darkness, cloud cover, rain and mist as well as minor adjustments and/or additions to scenery (Hardwicke swears there were absolutely no ""green screens"" used).  The meadow scene is particularly gorgeous and there is a reason that it appears so utopian - it mimics the very dream Meyer had that inspired her to write the novel.The special effects for the vampires aren't so great, however.  There is lots of sped-up footage to create the illusion of super-speed as well as harnesses to emulate a Superman-like ability to leap tall trees in a single bound and climb like Spiderman.  Visual effects of this nature can be hard to do with live actors and therefore generate a lot of criticism due to the lack of fluidity and the inability to suspend disbelief.  I also think they are overused a bit - restraint would've been very helpful in this department.The film does have a few memorable touches, one of which is a nice homage to the book's ""forbidden fruit"" cover in a cafeteria scene.  The other is Bella's first drive through Forks, the scenery a nice set up for just how small and quaint a seaside town it really is.For someone who likes a DVD jam-packed with extras, this three-disc deluxe edition is well worth the money.  Sporting numerous featurettes, a seven-part behind-the-scenes documentary, extended and deleted scenes, music videos and an elucidating sit-down with author Stephenie Meyer, what more could a Twilight fan ask for?Bottom line: If you are a Target shopper and are mulling over buying this 3-disc edition, do so for the myriad of satisfying extras - the film itself is more a companion than a primary.",3,Read The Book.

I'm a thirty-year-old mother of two, so I was pretty skeptical about reading these books. I have always been a huge fan of horror, and one of my all time favorite books is Bram Stoker's, Dracula; so I didn't consider a bunch of books about teenage vampires as being in the same league as some of the other vampire books that I like, but much to my surprise, I really enjoyed reading the these and finished them all within a week. By the time I read all the books, the movie was getting ready to be released on DVD. I just rented this a couple of days ago and I must say I was very disappointed.This is a poorly made movie, period. I know there are a lot of die hard Twilight fans out there who are so eager to see their favorite characters on the screen that they are willing to look past all the flaws in this movie, but come on people, surely you all can tell a well made movie from a bad one. This movie is like SPAM - it thinks it's meat, and you want it to be meat, but in the end it's not and it just leaves you hungry for the real stuff. Regardless of how much you want this movie to be good, there is no excuse for a movie this poorly made and directed.Catherine Hardwicke has directed a total of THREE movies prior to making this film; and it sorely shows. Hardwicke is inexperienced, sloppy, lacks creativity and originality, and is better off making cheesy movies for the Scifi channel, and should leave the motion pictures up to people who actually know what they're doing. She butchered this movie when it had the potential to be so much more.

O'Blenis,"[0, 2]","Twilight stands, in my opinion, as one of the greatest movie romances of all time, with enough elements of fantasy, horror, and magical mystery to establish it as part of a small elite of genre-blending movies likeThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series),Ghost (Special Collector's Edition)andThe Invisible(this last one, in particular, is one Twilight fans should take note of) that should have appeal to movie fans of all stripes and tastes.  It's the story of a high school girl named Bella (Kristen Stewart fromThe Messengers) who moves to Oregon to live with her father, and ends up meeting a member of a small clan of vampires who pass theselves off as human, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson).  The vampires have sworn off human blood, living off the blood of forest animals, and walk a tight line between isolation in their estate off the outskirts of the small town, and walking in the everyday human world.  Being around humans stirs the bloodlust the family-like unit strives so hard to control, and so their struggle to live and blend in with humans is basically limited to as little time as necessary - they live much of their lives among humans but can never become really close to any of them.  This is all thrown into chaos upon the first meetings between Bella and Edward, who are instantly and irrevocably drawn to one another.It's not a 'Romeo And Juliet'-type tale where the protagonists are kept apart by their warring families: Bella's family is unaware of the true nature of the Cullens, and Edward's family is welcoming of Bella.  It's other factors that come into play - the string of murders in the general area of the Oregon coast, the emergence of a second, more aggressive clan of vampires, and the strange connection some of the area's human residents seem to have to wolves.The movie is brilliantly made, with exceptional performances throughout, especially by Stewart and Pattinson.  The creative use of striking visual imagery - like in one of the early classroom scenes between the two, where Edward is staring at Bella and he happens to be seated in front of some kind of statue or classroom model; from the viewer's perspective only the wings can be seen behind him, and they could look like either the wings of an angel or a demon depending on one's frame of mind - are top-of-the-line, and the backdrop of the forested mountains of Oregon provide further visual effect.  The music is another definate plus - I find a lot of times, when a movie is packed with songs by currently 'hot' artists for the sake of the soundtrack album, the song's placement within the movie itself doesn't really fit, but in Twilight every single piece compliments its scene perfectly.There are really no significant negatives to Twilight.

The BD is exclusive to BB until Saturday morning so I had to stick with doing this 2-disc set.It has been playing in the store this weekend and it has amazingly been a hit with kids of all ages, from 6 to 16. Adults have had more of a lukewarm reaction, but virtually everyone has heard about the hype around this $200 million juggernaut.The DVD quality is quite adequate, admittedly the color palette is used very little, but the clarity of the landscapes in the 2.40:1 has been rewarding. Have been playing it on a BD player to a 40"" LCD, so I have not had the chance to test it on the bigger screen plasmas I usually do for all of my reviews, but these damn exclusive contracts put a wrench in reviewing. The extras give this an extra star though to a 3-star film.The music videos and extended scenes (10 minutes total) will be a watch for any fan of the movie, but that 2nd disc will likely satiate even the most discerning fan. The 7-part documentary covers a large variety of background and production material for all interested.

When he walked away from Bella, in one scene after he first starts to interact with her, his shoulders are hunched and he stomps off like he has lead feet. A runway model he is not....he pretty much looked uncomfortable from start to finish...The only actress I though that approximated pretty much to her character in the book was Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen...You didn't see her much but she had a quirky charm that is undeniable.The actor who played Bella's father Charlie was okay to.I would like to think that changing the director from the first movie to the sucessive follow-ups would improve the quality and performances but from what I hear from the buzz around the office(in relation to New Moon) they are relying on tactics that would do credit to a daytime soap opera with pace and performances to match...Note to producers...ripping of your shirt every ten minutes or so does not make a movie good or improve performance...The movie going public isn't quite that stupid",3,Not much depth,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,2475,"['Having', 'read', 'frenzy', 'surrounding', 'books', 'decided', 'purchase', 'read', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'must', 'admit', 'liked', 'first', 'book', 'interest', 'waned', 'end', 'novel', '.Bella', 'was', 'irritating', 'indecisive', 'regards', 'Edward', 'Jacob', 'plots', 'seemed', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 're-heated', 'rehashed', 'sucessive', 'novel', '.poor', 'Bella', 'was', 'such', 'contant', 'danger', 'one', 'source', 'wanted', 'put', 'misery', 'myself', 'Clearly', 'think', 'author', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'two', 'decent', 'books', 'rather', 'dragging', 'things', 'out', 'one', 'good', 'one', 'three', 'pretty', 'repeative', 'follow-upsHowever', 'review', 'movie', 'One', 'things', 'liked', 'first', 'book', 'was', 'Bella', 'fiestiness', 'Edward', 'sardonic', 'dark', 'humor.They', 'sparked', 'other', 'quite', 'nicely', 'unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'looked', 'so', 'pained', 'most', 'time', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'were', 'constipated.Kristen', 'Stewart', 'spent', 'most', 'movie', 'pouting', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'sullen', 'characterisation', 'Bella', 'was', 'so', 'passive', 'one', 'dimentional', 'would', 'wonder', 'why', 'would', 'inspire', 'sort', 'passion', 'Edward', 'pretty', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'insipid', 'mind', 'dialogue', 'was', 'hardly', 'helpful', 'sometime', 'was', 'drawn', 'straight', 'book', 'trunkated', 'so', 'much', 'hardly', 'made', 'sence.Robert', 'Pattison', 'looked', 'part', 'had', 'none', 'humor', 'certainly', 'none', 'grace', 'elegance', 'Edward', 'When', 'walked', 'away', 'Bella', 'one', 'scene', 'first', 'interact', 'shoulders', 'are', 'hunched', 'stomps', 'off', 'lead', 'feet', 'runway', 'model', 'not', '.he', 'pretty', 'much', 'looked', 'uncomfortable', 'start', 'finish', 'only', 'actress', 'approximated', 'pretty', 'much', 'character', 'book', 'was', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'Alice', 'Cullen', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'had', 'quirky', 'charm', 'undeniable.The', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Bella', 'father', 'Charlie', 'was', 'okay', 'to.I', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'changing', 'director', 'first', 'movie', 'sucessive', 'follow-ups', 'would', 'improve', 'quality', 'performances', 'what', 'hear', 'buzz', 'office', 'relation', 'New', 'Moon', 'are', 'relying', 'tactics', 'would', 'do', 'credit', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera', 'pace', 'performances', 'match', 'Note', 'producers', 'ripping', 'shirt', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'good', 'improve', 'performance', 'movie', 'going', 'public', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stupid']",N/A

I am also not a diehard Twilight fan. Anyway, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I first saw this on DVD. I never saw it in theatres. I had heard mixed reviews about it. I pre-ordered it here on amazon back in January because I knew that I wanted to see it. I have since seen it twice. I thought that it started out kind of slow, but after about the first 15 minutes or so, it started to pick up the pace a bit. Since this is such a popular film, I will refrain from going into too much detail about the background of the story. After I saw it, I heard some people around me say that Kristen Stewart, the leading actress, is not a good actress but her looks make up for her lack of acting skills. I have to admit that I don't think she is a terrific actress; she did do a great job in the most pivotal scene. She can deliver her lines, but there's just nothing special about her. I am in no way trying to put her down as an actress. Robert Pattinson did a pretty decent job in his role. At first, I was going to say that he had a somewhat wooden performance, but then I thought about it some more and realized that it really worked for the character that he was playing. I liked this movie so much that it has now become my new favorite movie of all times. It was so different from any other movie I've seen. It had a dark/romantic theme and feel to it. It's hard for me to objectively say the kind of person that would like this movie.

1204236,AWBGHDHH7E51F,B001IDZLCK,"Trend ""jewelry nut""","[2, 2]","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The book didn't do it for me. In the movie, all that redundant chatter is eliminated.  Unlike the book, vampire fight scenes were included. The cast was well picked, with the exception of Rosalie. I didn't find her to be drop dead gorgeous.  The atmosphere of this small, rainy town was captured. For me, the characters came to life in this movie. You, finally, get a visualization and the feeling of being drawn into the characters of Edward and Bella. You can understand Bella's fascination and determination to unravel the mystery of Edward, after he saved her life. You understand, Edward is a ""vampire"".He acts differently. He talks differently. His looks are different. I think a lot of the book reviewers thought of him as a human male and found his behavior distasteful. The character is a vampire and he's alluring...period.  He wasn't 17. He was old and you picked that up, right away. He has old eyes. Bella didn't have a chance.  As a matter of fact, if she had shunned him, he would have ""turned"" her. All of Bella's begging to become like him would have been eliminated. He meant to have her. As it stood, he didn't need to turn her...he had her and she was willing.  In the movie, the character of Edward was as hypnotic and mesmerizing as any of the vampires of old. Bella wasn't a wimp. The girl was hypnotized with a ""light touch"" and she wasn't fighting it. I would have enjoyed more action  scenes. A tastefully done sex scene would have been a welcome addition. I understand Meyers is a Mormon.  Can't write about premarital sex, but the occult is okay? Interesting.Also, there were moments of beauty and excitement in the ""Twilight"" movie. The nature scenes were beautifully shot. Actually, I found the book became a little boring. If you didn't care for Meyer's writing style, you may like the way it was adapted for the screen. I sure did.It was a mystery to me why Meyer's books are so popular because her writing in Twilight sucks...it's just the truth. I'm truly a reader. I couldn't force myself to read anymore of that series, but I was still enchanted by the premise of Twilight, while wishing another author had written it for her. I had to ponder why her books are so vastly popular.My take: Her books are modeled (rather closely) after great literary works, written by great authors, whose works have stood the test of time....""Romeo and Juliet""; ""Wuthering Heights""; ""MidSummer's Night Dream"", etc..I really think that is one major attraction to her books. They resonate. They strike a familiar cord within us. Her characters actually give a ""fresh spin"" to these, well loved,  great works of literature,  and in the case of Romeo and Juliet; we get the happy ending we longed for.  In the movie, ""New Moon"", my favorite scene was the angst Bella experienced, while trying to reach Edward in time to save his life and then succeeding.  In those star crossed lovers, I was given the ending, I wished for Romeo and Juliet.Heathcliff and Catherine love each other. Heathcliff(ie, Bella) felt Catherine didn't deem him ""good enough"" for her, but Catherine truly loved him. They separate in misunderstanding. Both suffer immensely. Meyers gives us the ending we wanted for Heathcliff and Catherine...to reunite in their love, while alive. Combine that with the long standing intrigue of vampires and a ordinary, self absorbed girl that ""makes good"". Stehenie Meyers may not ever become a great author or even a good one, but she's smart. Meyers rewrote the endings of some great literary works and has left us clamouring for more. She may be brilliant. For sure, it's left her rich.

Ok and....This movie is targeted to teenage girls since the main character is a moody, mumbling, inarticulate, rebellious-for-no-apparent-reason teenage girl, Bela, who appears to fall in love at first sight with a moody, inarticulate teenage boy, Edward, who is supposed to be drop dead gorgeous -- maybe in your dreams?At first I thought Bela could be a vampire given her translucent white skin, and her depressed, languid demeanor.  I would not call her a beauty so ""bela"" is a stretch.Actually, Edward's ""father"", his ""sister"" who can see the future, and his rebellious ""brother"" were much more interesting and attractive, but I guess that is another story.The movie seems to count on its special effects which can be impressive (except the supposed shimmering of a vampire in sunlight did not quite dazzle), but not enough to carry the movie or be worth the price of the two-disc DVD set.I am told that the first two books were good, but the last two were disappointments.

I read the books and wasn't totally disappointed, but the casting in this movie is so terrible that it made me die a little inside. I find Kristen Stewart to be a horrendous actress and a terrible cast for Bella. Isn't Bella supposed to be attractive considering she's in Forks? In this movie, not only is she way unattractive, but she is also ridiculously stoic. Besides her impeccable ability to bite her lip in every scene, I can't see any acting ability. Robert does a fair job as Edward and I can't complain about the rest of the cast. The dialog, however, is vapid and leaves a lot to be desired. I get that the movie had a built in fan base that would refuse to be disappointed by whatever this movie turned out to be, but I still expected more. Sure, not much happens in the first book, but the pacing seemed off still. For a teenage love story, Twilight was emotionally empty and dull. The camera work was the highlight, if that helps put things into perspective. Given all this, the movie has an undefinable pull that wouldn't allow me to stop watching and, in fact, somehow got me to watch the next three.

1204239,A5CWLQF6QO3CN,B001IDZLCK,"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","[1, 2]","Twilight, based on the hugely popular teenage girl series written by Stephenie Meyer, was in the end very teenage girly.First came to know the Twilight series when I was in States and the fourth book just came out and the media was reporting how teenage girls were lining up outside books. So bought the first book and couldn't finish it - because it is too teenage girly. However, the premise was very nice so when I heard that its movie is coming out, and with a pretty decent trailer, I decided that this is the movie I want to see in the holidays.Saw it, and I must say the experience was bitter and sweet. Sweet in a way that the story was so much faster (although still a bit slow from the movie medium standard) and there were some more actions in it. The story characters are now crisper than more than just a silhouette you got from the description of Bella in the book. There are more actions and suspense in the movie although quite predictable, it gives the movie an extra dimension. Bitter is that it is still pretty much a teenage girl movie with a spice of vampire lust. If you are in for a vampire horror, thriller or even suspense, you will be disappointed.The premise of the movie is basically about a girl called Bella from Texas moved to a small depressed and rainy town called Fork in the State of Washington. There entered the mysterious Cullen family at the school. They kept to themselves but everyone of them is stunningly good looking (so you became good looking when you become a vampire, or only good looking people are selected to become vampires?) And surprisingly Bella got more and more interested in one of the good looking boys called Edward, because, surprisingly, she thought that he didn't like her. So in very teenage girl style, she embarked herself on a journey to find out more about the boy, got the boy attention and fell in love with the boy even she knew that he was a vampire . A love with not point of return. A jackpot formula and plot for teenage girls.The whole cast delivered a fair performance although some characters don't quite look like how you imagined them in the book. Robert Pattinson (from the Harry Potter: Goblet of Fire fame) did a great job as Edward although a bit more dimensional would be great, but that was that much you can work with from the book. Although I heard that Stephenie Meyer did give me a crash course on back story to make it more a character than the ""description of a character"" in the book. Kristen Stewart was quite boring as Bella Swan. Then again, I found the character extremely boring in the book anyway, so maybe that's a good job she did. Frankly, none of her classmates are quite up to what you imagined in the book. Although the character Jacob was quite well played. The vampire family look more interesting in the movie and the race between the Cullen family and the Hunters was great but all too short. But then again, this is about Romance not Thriller.Twilight is a movie you will love if you love the books, but if you are beyond the age of teenage girls and want more substance out of the movie, you may be disappointed.

Sorry to sat this, but after watching ""Twilight,"" it would be very hard for me to imagine why the original books by Stephenie Meyer have attracted so many devoted fans all over the world. There must be something missing in the film, but what is it?The film has right actors and right photography. The ever-cloudy town of Forks where newly-moved high school student Bella Swan lives with her father is perfectly shot. The two leads Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are perfectly cast. Some may disagree, but I think there is chemistry evident between two characters they play. Frankly I didn't find Kristen Stewart's character Bella Swan very interesting, though, partly because I wanted her to show her emotions more, but her acting itself is good. Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen, a handsome and mysterious vampire, is also very good. His presence alone would explain why ""Twilight"" has become a huge hit in America.The only wrong choice is the director Catherine Hardwicke. She just doesn't know how to handle the great material at hand. Cheesy special effects (like the character zipping through the woods) completely ruins the romantic mood the two leads created. The awkwardly filmed fight sequence (and the several chapters prior to that), which should be more thrilling, only demonstrates the director's ineptitude as a storyteller. Several interesting characters like Alice (Ashley Greene) - well, actually I found the entire Cullen family more interesting than Bella - are wasted among the badly edited conclusion.""Twilight"" is a great missed opportunity. It has a great story and interesting characters we care. I hope that its sequel is directed by someone who knows better how to tell this story. (But Chris Weitz? Of ""The Golden Compass""?

The Comic Book film, The 1980's Cartoon Film and of course the infamous Fantasy Novel Saga.  The newest sensation is the modern day vampire love story called `Twilight'.Once again the mythology of the vampire has been picked to be re-invented for a whole new generation to call their own. Twilight definitely has changed the image of the vampire. Suddenly they shine light diamonds in the sunlight and have lost their fangs. Heck in this version we are introduced to the ""Vegetarian"" vampire. That is a vampire that feeds off the blood of animals as opposed to humans. The story is about of course a human girl that finds out the boy she has a huge crush on is a Vampire. The Vampire is plagued by her beauty knowing he should not kill her, but can he even bare to love her back afraid he would fall into madness.I have heard so many things about this story. Mostly my girls who are madly in love with the Shakespearian like romance between the two main characters, so of course being one of the highest grossing movies of 2008, I was intrigued. After I saw this movie I wanted to hop into the bathtub with a razor blade. I am so sorry, but I thought this movie so depressing and just pitiful. The real name of this movie should have been EMO: The Motion Picture. Everyone in this film was so mopey is made me laugh. I would seriously give Kristen Stewart 1000 bucks if she would show a naturally happy smile. Not to exaggerate, but I actually had to watch this movie a second time just to see if I possibly missed something and maybe my thoughts were just too harsh. Nope, they didn't change. The only thing that kept me going was all the good looking Vampiers (girl bloodsuckers). All the characters looked like they just stepped out of a CW TV teen drama.Yes, I know the saying never judge a book by its movie. But, I truthfully never intended on reading the books anyway. I just expect the movies that I see to be entertaining whether based on novels or not. This was a pathetic excuse of a movie, it would have been better off as a made into a TV drama, the special effects were pretty much up to small screen par. I know there is no way to prevent the final 3 films from being released. Will I see them...sure if I don't have to pay for it and if I am in need of a good laugh over a beer with some buddies.

1204259,A2W2E6BPPYZO0T,B001IDZLCK,YA book lover,"[0, 1]","I watched this movie twice so far. Once before reading the books and second time - after. I believe this experience gives me an opportunity to have a somewhat objective opinion about the movie.After hearing all the buzz and comparisons to Harry Potter franchise, my husband and I decided to watch Twilight. To be honest, I rated this movie C afterwards. First of all, it was a totally ""girly"" movie. I could not understand all the staring, and love story didn't seem to be all that convincing - a girl fell in love with a (hot) vampire boy for no good reason and wanted to ""be with him forever.""Although I wasn't that impressed by the movie,I decided to give books a chance. There was soooo much buzz about them. I opened Twilight, and was and still is lost in this fantasy. The writing itself is flawed, language is poor, but the story is so compelling, it is hard to put the books down. Yesterday I watched the movie again and, oh boy, it was a completely different experience!!! I could barely stop myself from screaming like a small girl how hot Edward was! He was exactly like I dreamed of him. Yes, some story lines were cut, special effects were laughable (especially running) but chemistry between Bella and Edward was sooo there, no doubt about that. Only I know all the back story now and know how their relationship developed.So what does it say about the movie?Movie definetely works for the books' fans, but the story is such that it is almost impossible for movie makers to capture additional audience (especially male).P.S.

1204261,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001IDZLCK,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","Just for the record, I am a 38-year-old woman and mom, and have been a fan of the Twilight series since the first book hit the market. Though I personally liked the first three books better than the fourth, the series as a whole was very engaging [and FYI, my literary tastes are eclectic, ranging from the classics to contemporary literary fiction and the supernatural]. It has been heartening to see the overwhelming interest in this series if only because like Harry Potter before it, the Twilight series has succeeded in getting young people interested in reading and discussing the books, and as a former educator I'm impressed by that.Ok, as for the movie - I loved it. ""Twilight"" the movie covers the first book in the series, which sees Bella Swan, a junior move to the rainy town of Folks, Washington. She goes to live with her father, police chief Charlie, after her mother remarries and decides to move around with her new husband. Initially, Bella resents the move, but her attitude soon changes after seeing Edward Cullen, the brooding junior with pale skin and mesmerizing eyes who seems to hypnotize Bella with his stare. Bella is played by Kristen Stewart, and I felt Kristen did her role justice - with the right amount of teen angst and aloofness, without being too condescending. Her looks are more au naturel in this movie - i.e. sans make-up, and she looks naturally beautiful. In the book, Bella is no great beauty, but has an indefinable quality that attracts boys to her. Kristen has that special quality too - without coming across as too alluring, she nonetheless has this X-factor thing going for her, and I for one found her characterization credible.As for Robert Pattinson, he personifies the Edward Cullen of the book - this is one aloof yet hot vampire, and though his eyebrows were a tad distracting, I thought he did a good job portraying the handsome vampire who falls head over heels with the mortal Bella, despite his misgivings. There's a scene in the biology lab, where Bella is first assigned to sit next to Edward - he flinches and appears to be in torment, but to Bella this comes across as offensive [she thinks he's repulsed by her] - in reality, Edward's physical reaction is driven by his thirst for Bella's blood, something he has been able to control around other mortals, but not with Bella.Their love story moves altogether quickly in this movie, and that is possibly due to time constraints [which is partly why I only gave it 4 *]. The book takes its time to develop the love story between Bella and Edward, but despite this flaw, Kristen and Robert share a credible on-screen chemistry that enables viewers to accept the lightning quick development of their romance. Even their make-out sessions have an otherworldly quality - be it lying about in a lush meadow, or when Edward tells Bella ""Be still"" as he proceeds to kiss her, not because he wants to dominate her, but because he doesn't want to hurt her. A chivalrous vampire if you will.In terms of plot development, the movie basically adheres to the book for the most part, and as Bella and Edward's romance develops, they find that love between a mortal and immortal is not altogether without its complications - Edward has to exercise superhuman [duh! he's a vampire after all] restraint to keep from 'devouring' Bella, literally. Bella on the other hand, can't seem to keep her hands off Edward. Typical teens, except for the fact that crossing the line for these two could literally spell death for mortal Bella. The pair's romance also means having to deal with Edward's coven, led by the charismatic foster father, Carlisle, mom Esme, and 'siblings' Rosalie [who is the most antagonistic towards Bella], Jasper, Emmett, and Alice [the one who likes Bella the most]. There is also the threat of recent 'animal' attacks on humans in the surrounding areas which have resulted in gruesome deaths. Rogue vampires are also a factor here.All in all, ""Twilight"" the movie keeps viewers engaged and interested, and is a refreshing take on the mortal-vampire love story. The cast performance is on the whole quite credible, except perhaps for the portrayal of Jacob which I thought was rather weak, but his character doesn't really gain significance until the second book.The cinematography is gorgeous, depicting stormy skies, mist-capped mountains and romantic waterfalls, and of course the constant rain. The score is well-chosen, ably conveying the romantic themes underlying the movie. Final verdict - highly watchable vampire-romance that engages and thrills all at once. I'd recommend reading the book before watching the movie [if only to better appreciate the finer subtleties lost in translation], but it's not a must.",4,An immortal love story for the ages,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,4733,"['Just', 'record', 'am', '38-year-old', 'woman', 'mom', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Twilight', 'series', 'first', 'book', 'hit', 'market', 'personally', 'liked', 'first', 'three', 'books', 'better', 'fourth', 'series', 'whole', 'was', 'very', 'engaging', '[', 'FYI', 'literary', 'tastes', 'are', 'eclectic', 'ranging', 'classics', 'contemporary', 'literary', 'fiction', 'supernatural', ']', 'been', 'heartening', 'see', 'overwhelming', 'interest', 'series', 'only', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Twilight', 'series', 'succeeded', 'getting', 'young', 'people', 'interested', 'reading', 'discussing', 'books', 'former', 'educator', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'that.Ok', 'movie', 'loved', 'Twilight', 'movie', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'junior', 'move', 'rainy', 'town', 'Folks', 'Washington', 'live', 'father', 'police', 'chief', 'Charlie', 'mother', 'remarries', 'decides', 'move', 'around', 'new', 'husband', 'Initially', 'Bella', 'move', 'attitude', 'soon', 'changes', 'seeing', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'brooding', 'junior', 'pale', 'skin', 'mesmerizing', 'eyes', 'who', 'hypnotize', 'Bella', 'stare', 'Bella', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'felt', 'Kristen', 'did', 'role', 'justice', 'right', 'amount', 'teen', 'angst', 'aloofness', 'being', 'too', 'condescending', 'looks', 'are', 'more', 'au', 'naturel', 'movie', 'i.e', 'make-up', 'naturally', 'beautiful', 'book', 'Bella', 'great', 'beauty', 'indefinable', 'quality', 'Kristen', 'special', 'quality', 'too', 'coming', 'too', 'alluring', 'nonetheless', 'X-factor', 'thing', 'going', 'one', 'found', 'characterization', 'credible.As', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'book', 'one', 'aloof', 'yet', 'hot', 'vampire', 'eyebrows', 'were', 'tad', 'distracting', 'thought', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'handsome', 'vampire', 'who', 'head', 'heels', 'mortal', 'Bella', 'misgivings', 'scene', 'biology', 'lab', 'where', 'Bella', 'first', 'assigned', 'sit', 'next', 'Edward', 'be', 'torment', 'Bella', 'across', 'offensive', '[', 'repulsed', ']', 'reality', 'Edward', 'physical', 'reaction', 'driven', 'thirst', 'Bella', 'blood', 'something', 'been', 'able', 'control', 'other', 'mortals', 'not', 'Bella.Their', 'love', 'story', 'moves', 'altogether', 'quickly', 'movie', 'possibly', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', '[', 'partly', 'why', 'only', 'gave', '4', '*', ']', 'book', 'time', 'develop', 'love', 'story', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'flaw', 'Kristen', 'Robert', 'share', 'credible', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'viewers', 'accept', 'lightning', 'quick', 'development', 'romance', 'Even', 'make-out', 'sessions', 'have', 'otherworldly', 'quality', 'be', 'lying', 'about', 'lush', 'meadow', 'when', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'Be', 'still', 'kiss', 'not', 'dominate', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'chivalrous', 'vampire', 'will.In', 'terms', 'plot', 'development', 'movie', 'basically', 'book', 'most', 'part', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'romance', 'find', 'love', 'mortal', 'immortal', 'not', 'altogether', 'complications', 'Edward', 'exercise', 'superhuman', '[', 'duh', 'vampire', ']', 'restraint', 'keep', ""'devouring"", 'Bella', 'literally', 'Bella', 'other', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'hands', 'off', 'Edward', 'Typical', 'teens', 'fact', 'crossing', 'line', 'two', 'could', 'literally', 'spell', 'death', 'mortal', 'Bella', 'pair', 'romance', 'also', 'having', 'deal', 'Edward', 'coven', 'led', 'charismatic', 'foster', 'father', 'Carlisle', 'mom', 'Esme', ""'siblings"", 'Rosalie', '[', 'who', 'most', 'antagonistic', 'towards', 'Bella', ']', 'Jasper', 'Emmett', 'Alice', '[', 'one', 'who', 'Bella', 'most', ']', 'also', 'threat', 'recent', ""'animal"", 'attacks', 'humans', 'surrounding', 'areas', 'have', 'resulted', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'Rogue', 'vampires', 'are', 'also', 'factor', 'here.All', 'Twilight', 'movie', 'viewers', 'engaged', 'interested', 'refreshing', 'take', 'mortal-vampire', 'love', 'story', 'cast', 'performance', 'whole', 'quite', 'credible', 'perhaps', 'portrayal', 'Jacob', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'weak', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'gain', 'significance', 'second', 'book.The', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'depicting', 'stormy', 'skies', 'mist-capped', 'mountains', 'romantic', 'waterfalls', 'course', 'constant', 'rain', 'score', 'well-chosen', 'ably', 'conveying', 'romantic', 'themes', 'underlying', 'movie', 'Final', 'verdict', 'highly', 'watchable', 'vampire-romance', 'once', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'reading', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', '[', 'only', 'better', 'appreciate', 'finer', 'lost', 'translation', ']', 'not', 'must']",N/A
