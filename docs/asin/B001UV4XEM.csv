1239658,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001UV4XEM,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 8]","I know that it has gotten a lot of flack for being `overrated', but seriously, this movie is ridiculously hilarious.  I avoided it, thinking that it was just going to be an overuse of gross out humor, but it really isn't.  Sure, it is offensive, but it is done in a VERY humorous way that makes this one never-ending laugh riot.  It had NO BUSINESS winning all those comedy awards over the far more refreshing `(500) Days of Summer', but that is no reason to pan this film as unworthy of our attention.  The jokes are all different and all hit with reckless abandon.  The performances are fleshed out beautifully, and all of the actors really have great interaction with one another, which creates a natural chemistry even in the midst of highly unnatural circumstances.  Bradley Cooper is dapper and charming, Ed Helms is hilariously unnerved and Zach Galifianakis is a comedic goldmine here.  His performance is one of the best comedic performances of the decade.  He really understands how NOT to overdue it while making sure that he is completely over the line.  I never stopped laughing.  The plot itself may have its fair share of holes and it may not all make sense (it's a slapstick buddy comedy, so it really isn't supposed to) but that doesn't matter because the screenplay is so rich with comedic engagement that you forget all about the fact that its one of the most improbably comedies in recent years.

I know, I know, you're going to start hammering me with the negative check marks saying this review wasn't helpful. But before you do that KNOW that I really wanted to love this movie, so much so that I bought the blu-ray of this movie to give it another chance. I had my wife watch it with me this time and we laughed a lot and I liked it even better than before. However, as the credits rolled the same nagging issue hampered my totally loving this movie. The Rohypnol pictures seemed like the makings of a much funnier movie. I plan on watching this movie again, probably more than a few times, and maybe my opinion will change but for the moment it's a solid movie that didn't push it over the top.

1239672,AG0TA24LI0XV7,B001UV4XEM,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[2, 4]","This was the kind of comedy movie where I was laughing because I felt obligated to; most of the scenarios, characters, and dialogue seemed like they were supposed to elicit laughs. They were not innately funny. I like a comedy where I laugh completely by instinct, not out of pity or obligation. Now, there is some occasional funny stuff to be found in ""The Hangover""; it's largely hit or miss. But for the most part this film is not the riotous, awesome experience that many people have claimed it to be. It's amusing. But nothing to get excited about.Part of the reason I saw this film was Roger Ebert's glowing, 3.5 out of 4 stars review. Not so thrilled with that now that I've seen the flick. He practically made it out to be another ""Animal House"" or ""The Blues Brothers"", the way he described it. And to be honest, a generous chunk of his review was plot synopsis. I can get that elsewhere. But I digress.In ""The Hangover"", I didn't care about the characters. The three guys were all flawed (which is necessary in comedy) but none of them was likeable. The weirdo with the beard (Zach Galifianakis as Alan Garner... this has been called a 'stand-out' or 'breakout' performance, for some reason) was very odd and deadpan, but he did not have the makings of a great comedy character. And actually, it was established early on that he's a pedophile.There are silly things in the film, but there are also things that I didn't find amusing: harming a baby for a laugh doesn't work for me. Plus, I felt that many things seen in this film had been done before. And there was even a ""Rain Man"" homage. I guess that's supposed to be cute. Whatever.The nice 'n tidy, happy-ever-after, tacked-on ending of this movie made me want to heave. Why does America always need happy or nice endings all the time? Couldn't a comedy film end on a sour note once in a while? It's almost bizarre to have a movie like this-- where there is an impending sense of doom running through it-- end on a pleasant note.This is worth checking out for a couple of giggles, if you want to satisfy curiosity. Most of us can relate to a night of overt decadence and some next-morning forgetfulness. (This must have have been one long night these guys spent in their drugged stupor.) But I won't be seeking this film out for a second viewing; not a chance. If I want to laugh I will stick with Mel Brooks films, early Woody Allen movies, Monty Python, The Marx Brothers, or the Christopher Guest mockumentaries. For my money, ""The Hangover"" belongs with other highly overrated comedy movies like ""Meet the Parents"", ""American Pie"", and ""There's Something About Mary"".",3,"Entertaining, but by no means a comedy gem",1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,2636,"['was', 'kind', 'comedy', 'movie', 'where', 'was', 'laughing', 'felt', 'obligated', 'most', 'scenarios', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'seemed', 'were', 'supposed', 'elicit', 'laughs', 'were', 'not', 'innately', 'funny', 'like', 'comedy', 'where', 'laugh', 'completely', 'instinct', 'not', 'pity', 'obligation', 'Now', 'occasional', 'funny', 'stuff', 'be', 'found', 'Hangover', 'largely', 'hit', 'miss', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'not', 'riotous', 'awesome', 'experience', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'claimed', 'be', 'amusing', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'about.Part', 'reason', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'glowing', '3.5', '4', 'stars', 'review', 'Not', 'so', 'thrilled', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'flick', 'practically', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'Animal', 'House', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'way', 'described', 'be', 'honest', 'generous', 'chunk', 'review', 'was', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'can', 'get', 'elsewhere', 'digress.In', 'Hangover', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'three', 'guys', 'were', 'flawed', 'necessary', 'comedy', 'none', 'was', 'likeable', 'weirdo', 'beard', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'Alan', 'Garner', 'been', 'called', ""'stand-out"", 'performance', 'reason', 'was', 'very', 'odd', 'deadpan', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'makings', 'great', 'comedy', 'character', 'actually', 'was', 'established', 'early', 'pedophile.There', 'are', 'silly', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'amusing', 'harming', 'baby', 'laugh', ""n't"", 'work', 'felt', 'many', 'things', 'seen', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'was', 'even', 'Rain', 'Man', 'homage', 'guess', 'supposed', 'be', 'cute', 'Whatever.The', 'nice', 'n', 'tidy', 'happy-ever-after', 'tacked-on', 'ending', 'movie', 'made', 'want', 'heave', 'Why', 'America', 'always', 'need', 'happy', 'nice', 'endings', 'time', 'Could', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'film', 'end', 'sour', 'note', 'once', 'while', 'almost', 'bizarre', 'have', 'movie', 'where', 'impending', 'sense', 'doom', 'running', 'end', 'pleasant', 'note.This', 'checking', 'out', 'couple', 'giggles', 'want', 'satisfy', 'curiosity', 'Most', 'can', 'relate', 'night', 'overt', 'decadence', 'next-morning', 'forgetfulness', 'must', 'have', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'long', 'night', 'guys', 'spent', 'drugged', 'stupor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeking', 'film', 'out', 'second', 'viewing', 'not', 'chance', 'want', 'laugh', 'will', 'stick', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'films', 'early', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'mockumentaries', 'money', 'Hangover', 'belongs', 'other', 'highly', 'overrated', 'comedy', 'movies', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'American', 'Pie', 'Something', 'Mary']",The Hangover - UNRATED

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 2]","***CONTAINS SPOILERS***A surprising combination of outlandishness, childishness, and drunkenness move along at a funny pace in this year's comedic offering, THE HANGOVER. What really helps the film, too, is the complete contradictions that is each scenario surrounding four men who head to Las Vegas for a bachelor party.Doug the bachelor (Justin Bartha,National Treasure) heads to the city of sin with friends Phil (Bradley Cooper,Failure to Launch), Stu (Ed Helms,Walk Hard) and future brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis,Into the Wild). All of them, as stated earlier, are complete contradictions. And these contradictions seep out of the film like nausea creeping up on you the day after heavy drinking. Doug, the bachelor, we don't see much of because his buddies lose him their first night in Vegas ...and I mean they literally LOSE him. Doug is the responsible one who obviously lets go a bit too much as we later watch him -- on a video surveillance tape --  dry-hump a tiger they steal from Mike Tyson's home. Yes, THAT Mike Tyson. Phil, the carefree one, has to become the responsible adult and find Doug amidst the chaos that is Alan and Stu. Stu, we quickly learn, has lost more than his marbles but also a tooth (did I mention that Stu is a dentist?). And Alan -- who's ""not allowed within a hundred yards of a school"" -- ends up carrying a baby on his chest; a baby that they have no idea where it came from. But let's back up a second...Our friends toast on top of a fancy hotel, drink their first round of drinks under the stars, and then remember nothing much after that. What the devil happened? Were they slipped a Mickey somehow? Regardless, the morning after, they awaken in their hotel room with quite a few surprises. First thing they notice is that their room is completely destroyed. The next is that they have a live Bengal Tiger in their bathroom. Then a baby in the closet. A missing tooth in Stu's head. Missing pants for Alan. And all of them have misplaced their memories of the previous night.From here the story takes on a the role of a comedic mystery, trying to solve the prior night's mishaps, shenanigans, and debauchery. The main theme, though, is to find out where Doug the bachelor might be. Stolen police cars, kidnapped and naked orientals, and an unknown wedding all lead our three buddies to their goal.Making it back to the wedding (late, of course) the comedy takes a more serious twist as we find out what Doug has learned about his life, his future wife, and his friends (standing at the alter, we hear him become a responsible husband). But finding a camera after the wedding and viewing it with Stu, Alan, and Phil will end the film in a most shocking manner as the credits roll with bizarre screen shots.This film will most certainly not be for everyone. It isn't, in anyway, similar to the 1984 Tom Hanks filmBachelor Party. The Hangover is more gritty, more modern, and definitely more visual (in both a sexual and crude manner). It assaults the senses, which is why it works.",4,"A Gritty, Comedic, Bachelor Movie Surrounded By A Mystery...",1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,3032,"['***CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS***A', 'surprising', 'combination', 'outlandishness', 'childishness', 'drunkenness', 'move', 'along', 'funny', 'pace', 'year', 'comedic', 'offering', 'HANGOVER', 'What', 'really', 'film', 'too', 'complete', 'contradictions', 'scenario', 'surrounding', 'four', 'men', 'who', 'head', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'bachelor', 'bachelor', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'National', 'Treasure', 'city', 'sin', 'friends', 'Phil', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'Stu', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Walk', 'Hard', 'future', 'brother-in-law', 'Alan', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'Into', 'Wild', 'stated', 'earlier', 'are', 'complete', 'contradictions', 'contradictions', 'seep', 'film', 'nausea', 'creeping', 'up', 'day', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'Doug', 'bachelor', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'buddies', 'lose', 'first', 'night', 'Vegas', 'mean', 'literally', 'LOSE', 'Doug', 'responsible', 'one', 'who', 'obviously', 'go', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'later', 'watch', 'video', 'surveillance', 'tape', 'dry-hump', 'tiger', 'steal', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'home', 'Yes', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'Phil', 'carefree', 'one', 'become', 'responsible', 'adult', 'find', 'Doug', 'chaos', 'Alan', 'Stu', 'Stu', 'quickly', 'learn', 'lost', 'more', 'marbles', 'also', 'tooth', 'did', 'mention', 'Stu', 'dentist', 'Alan', 'who', 'not', 'allowed', 'hundred', 'yards', 'school', 'up', 'carrying', 'baby', 'chest', 'baby', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'came', 'let', 'back', 'up', 'second', 'friends', 'toast', 'top', 'fancy', 'hotel', 'drink', 'first', 'round', 'drinks', 'stars', 'then', 'remember', 'nothing', 'much', 'What', 'devil', 'happened', 'Were', 'slipped', 'Mickey', 'somehow', 'Regardless', 'morning', 'awaken', 'hotel', 'room', 'few', 'surprises', 'First', 'thing', 'notice', 'room', 'completely', 'destroyed', 'next', 'have', 'live', 'Bengal', 'Tiger', 'bathroom', 'Then', 'baby', 'closet', 'missing', 'tooth', 'Stu', 'head', 'Missing', 'pants', 'Alan', 'have', 'misplaced', 'memories', 'previous', 'night.From', 'here', 'story', 'role', 'comedic', 'mystery', 'trying', 'solve', 'prior', 'night', 'mishaps', 'shenanigans', 'debauchery', 'main', 'theme', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'Doug', 'bachelor', 'might', 'be', 'Stolen', 'police', 'cars', 'kidnapped', 'naked', 'orientals', 'unknown', 'wedding', 'lead', 'three', 'buddies', 'goal.Making', 'back', 'wedding', 'late', 'course', 'comedy', 'more', 'serious', 'twist', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Doug', 'learned', 'life', 'future', 'wife', 'friends', 'standing', 'alter', 'hear', 'become', 'responsible', 'husband', 'finding', 'camera', 'wedding', 'viewing', 'Stu', 'Alan', 'Phil', 'will', 'end', 'film', 'most', 'shocking', 'manner', 'credits', 'roll', 'bizarre', 'screen', 'shots.This', 'film', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'anyway', 'similar', '1984', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'filmBachelor', 'Party', 'Hangover', 'more', 'gritty', 'more', 'modern', 'definitely', 'more', 'visual', 'sexual', 'crude', 'manner', 'assaults', 'senses', 'why']",The Hangover - UNRATED

1239691,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B001UV4XEM,Brian C.,"[1, 1]","I should be upfront and say I do not think I am the intended demographic for a movie like this. I had to give up alcohol and other controlled substances before I ever reached the blackout Vegas party stage of my life. I have never woken up in a motel room unable to remember what I did the night before. That does not mean I am incapable of appreciating some of the humor in this movie. There were genuinely funny moments in the film. I gave the film three stars for reasons I will elaborate on in a moment but, I will say, if you are among the target audience for this movie, or you are just looking for a wild and raunchy comedy, I feel quite certain you will enjoy this film, and will consider it worthy of at least four stars.So, I like to begin with the positive. I really like the way the movie was structured. Rather than just a linear chronicle of the night's events we see the characters wake up in the morning and they have to try to piece together what happened the night before while searching for their friend. I enjoyed that structure as each reveal became crazier than the last. I am not sure all the explanations made that much sense (how did they get the cop car? how did they get into Mike Tyson's house? why was Mr. Chow naked?, and the chicken was never explained) but you cannot demand too much realism from a movie like this. In terms of acting I am definitely a fan of Zach Galifianakis. He is an exceptional comic actor (as well as standup comedian). Zach's character Alan was, for me, the most consistently funny of the group. The other actors are all excellent actors as well, of course.Now, for the things I did not like about the movie. I was not overly thrilled with the characters. Phil did not seem like a very likable character to me. Perhaps he was not supposed to be. I feel like the movie walked sort of a middle path. They could have gone all the way with it and made the characters genuinely unlikable. Then it would have been fun to watch them get their comeuppance. There are two recent, brilliant, television shows that have followed that route:It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: Seasons 1 & 2, andArrested Development: Seasons 1-3. On the other hand, they could have made the characters likable and had all their woes be the result of circumstance. This movie did not seem to me to choose either option. The characters were not all that likable or unlikable. I think I would have preferred if they had gone one way or the other.I think it also stretched believability a bit to think that the four main characters would be friends with each other in real life. They seemed to have very little in common. I realize you need contrast. You need the guy who is pushing everyone along to have a crazy time (Phil) and the person who is constantly worrying about his girlfriend back home (Stu). It just is hard for me to imagine that Stu and Phil would really be friends in real life. It is hard to imagine Alan being friends with anyone but they explained his presence fairly well in the beginning of the movie. I also feel like the overly domineering girlfriend (Melissa) is sort of a well worn trope by now.In terms of humor, I actually thought the funniest moments were a result of Alan's stupidity. A lot of the humor of the movie was simply a result of the inherent humor of male nudity. There is the early scene where Alan is in a jock strap, there is the doctor's visit with the old man who has to drop his pants, and there is Mr. Chow who, for some inexplicable reason, is naked when he jumps out of the trunk. That is sort of the same gag over and over and it seems a little repetitive. I am also not sure it is all that funny to begin with. I was certainly smiling through most of the movie but I rarely laughed out loud. Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high. I waited a long time to finally watch this: after it had become a virtual franchise and achieved its reputation as the highest grossing R-rated comedy ever. So, perhaps I was expecting too much.

The movie was, frankly, plain boring but once we find the guys waking up in their suite the night after, then it starts to rock.There are plenty of great twists even to what you think is a linear plot. Throw in a gratuitous expose breast of Heather Graham, gratuitous Mike Tyson, a tiger, a baby, a missing tooth and stolen police car, and you have a movie.It does fall into that typical Hollywood movie stereotypes. You get the stripper with a heart of gold, the bitchy live-in girlfriend, a Rain Man-like winning streak at the tables and plenty of car crashes.With better film editing this thing could have been off the charts funny. As it is it's a good laugh but nothing like Doug Liman's Go in its ability to capture Vegas today (and even that movie was smart in using Vegas for only a third of its movie).Lastly, there are zero extras on this DVD release.

The only part of it that I recall seemed realistic was when that one character was going to the bathroom, and instead of just turning his head, he turned his entire body while still taking care of business at the toilet.

1239712,A16ZCVDIFWONW,B001UV4XEM,C. Loescher,"[0, 0]","The Hangover is a compelling anomaly of a comedy, one that easily could have been just another movie where a group of thirtysomething dudes get drunk and into all sorts of trouble.  The method in which its story is told, however, sets it apart from its comedic kin and makes it all the more hilarious and brilliant.A small group of friends, pretty boy Phil (Bradley Cooper), lady-whipped Stu (The Office's ""Andy,"" Ed Helms), socially inept Alan (awesome newcomer Zach Galifianakis), and groom-to-be Doug (Justin Bartha), decide to go to Las Vegas for a final free-roaming, binge-drinking evening away from their normal lives, two days before Doug's nuptials are set to take place.  Predictably, the drinking begins early upon their arrival, and not surprisingly, the antics begin.  The best departure about The Hangover, however, is the intelligent structure of the story from there on out.  The bachelors awake the next morning to discover that not only do they not remember a single thing from the night before, but also that their man of the hour, Doug, is missing and nowhere to be found.  It turns out that, for reasons the film so elegantly reveals, that the men had been drugged.  Their hotel room is in shambles, a baby is found in the closet, and a tiger has set up shop in the bathroom.  The three friends are in similarly puzzling positions:  Phil finds a hospital bracelet around his wrist, Stu is missing a front tooth, and Alan yet again finds it difficult to locate a pair of pants.From that point, as the viewer, you're taken on a journey throughout Vegas with the film's three main antagonists, to determine what happened to them and their ride home, Doug.  You find out just as much as the three friends do, and at the exact same time, about their night out, which drives up the anticipation of whatever following humorous event the friends discover.  The interaction and comedic chemistry between Phil, Stu, and Alan is amazing; the casting couldn't have been done any better.  The Hangover also contains cameo appearances from several unexpected characters, including Mike Tyson and several actors who starred in 2003's Old School (one of director Todd Phillips's fantastic previous works).  The dialogue and language is crude and offensive, yet appropriate and rip-roaringly funny, and there's even bits of karmic plot points that round out the movie as an extemely well-accomplished work of raucous, constant humor.Up until this point, Old School only had a small handful of competitive equals, but The Hangover is so confidently funny that it eclipses many of said competitors with ease.  Even if somehow you don't begin to enjoy the movie from its opening moments, you'll be unable to stop being washed into the swirling miasma of curiosity and humor that The Hangover possesses.  Chock-full of one-liners and hilarious moments, The Hangover is a treat, and unlike hangovers we've all had, will be one you'll be more than pleased to undertake a second time.",5,The Opposite of a Headache,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",2009,2981,"['Hangover', 'compelling', 'anomaly', 'comedy', 'one', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'movie', 'where', 'group', 'thirtysomething', 'dudes', 'get', 'drunk', 'sorts', 'trouble', 'method', 'story', 'told', 'however', 'apart', 'comedic', 'kin', 'more', 'hilarious', 'brilliant.A', 'small', 'group', 'friends', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Phil', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'lady-whipped', 'Stu', 'Office', 'Andy', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'socially', 'inept', 'Alan', 'awesome', 'newcomer', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'groom-to-be', 'Doug', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'decide', 'go', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'final', 'free-roaming', 'binge-drinking', 'evening', 'away', 'normal', 'lives', 'two', 'days', 'Doug', 'nuptials', 'are', 'set', 'take', 'place', 'Predictably', 'drinking', 'early', 'arrival', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'antics', 'begin', 'best', 'departure', 'Hangover', 'however', 'intelligent', 'structure', 'story', 'there', 'out', 'bachelors', 'awake', 'next', 'morning', 'discover', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'single', 'thing', 'night', 'also', 'man', 'hour', 'Doug', 'missing', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'elegantly', 'reveals', 'men', 'had', 'been', 'drugged', 'hotel', 'room', 'shambles', 'baby', 'found', 'closet', 'tiger', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'bathroom', 'three', 'friends', 'are', 'similarly', 'puzzling', 'positions', 'Phil', 'hospital', 'bracelet', 'wrist', 'Stu', 'missing', 'front', 'tooth', 'Alan', 'yet', 'again', 'difficult', 'locate', 'pair', 'pants.From', 'point', 'viewer', ""'re"", 'taken', 'journey', 'Vegas', 'film', 'three', 'main', 'antagonists', 'determine', 'what', 'happened', 'ride', 'home', 'Doug', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'three', 'friends', 'do', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'night', 'up', 'anticipation', 'following', 'humorous', 'event', 'friends', 'discover', 'interaction', 'comedic', 'chemistry', 'Phil', 'Stu', 'Alan', 'amazing', 'casting', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'Hangover', 'also', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'several', 'unexpected', 'characters', 'including', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'several', 'actors', 'who', 'starred', '2003', 'Old', 'School', 'one', 'director', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'fantastic', 'previous', 'works', 'dialogue', 'language', 'crude', 'offensive', 'yet', 'appropriate', 'rip-roaringly', 'funny', 'even', 'bits', 'karmic', 'plot', 'points', 'round', 'movie', 'extemely', 'well-accomplished', 'work', 'raucous', 'constant', 'humor.Up', 'point', 'Old', 'School', 'only', 'had', 'small', 'handful', 'competitive', 'equals', 'Hangover', 'so', 'confidently', 'funny', 'many', 'said', 'competitors', 'ease', 'Even', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'begin', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'opening', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'be', 'unable', 'stop', 'being', 'washed', 'swirling', 'miasma', 'curiosity', 'humor', 'Hangover', 'possesses', 'Chock-full', 'one-liners', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'Hangover', 'treat', 'hangovers', ""'ve"", 'had', 'will', 'be', 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'pleased', 'undertake', 'second', 'time']",The Hangover - UNRATED

But it's the unique and vivid style in which it's delivered to us, that makes The Hangover not only the funniest comedy of 2009, but also the best comedy of the last few years.Going in, I expected it to be exactly what it could have very easily been: the movie described in the previous paragraph. However, we don't even see the bachelor party.The film opens with Phil (Bradley Cooper) and his two pals on the side of the road in the desert. Between them they have a busted lip, a missing tooth, a hospital bracelet and filthy clothes. Phil makes a dreadful phone call informing a would-be bride, that they are unable to locate her groom. When she reminds him that they are to be married in a few short hours, he apathetically replies, ""Yeah... that's not gonna happen.""We jump back to before they left for Vegas and meet the characters. Phil is a school teacher who sees nothing wrong with lying to the kids about a made-up field trip, and using the money they hand over, to fund the bachelor party. Stu (Ed Helms) is a dentist who calls himself a doctor, and has his entire life ran for him by his moody and severely overly strict girlfriend. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is beyond strange and is only invited to come along as a favor to the bride, as he is her brother. And we meet Doug (the groom), played by Justin Bartha.We follow them on the road to Vegas, where they check into an insanely expensive room and everything seems to be going a-ok. Then they toast to the first drink and... wake up the next day, seriously hung-over and used and abused by God knows what happened. When Stu asks ""Why can't we remember anything from last night?""; Phil delivers one of my favorite lines in the film by responding, ""Obviously because we had a great f***ing time.""The room is absolutely destroyed; a bowling ball stuck in the middle of the wall, a tiger in the bathroom, and a chicken walking around aimlessly. Oh, and did I mention the infant they find in the closet? And of course, Doug is no-where to be found.From there they begin to use what little clues they have, to help point them in the right direction as to where Doug might be. It's wildly entertaining and devilishly funny. The movie never misses a laugh or skips a beat. Having recently seen The Hangover for a second time; I can tell you it only gets funnier with additional viewings.The amazing Todd Phillips directs this comedic masterpiece as brilliantly as he has done with his treasures of the past, to include: Road Trip, Old School, Starsky & Hutch and School for Scoundrels. There is an excellent soundtrack, and the cinematography is top-notch, to boot.The film is dirty at times but it is never tasteless or witless. It's beautifully and cleverly written and contains at least a dozen one-liners that will live on forever. It may have several clich&eacute; elements found in numerous similar films of this genre, but it does marvelous things with them.For instance: the scene where Doug is given the keys to his future father-in-law's prized car, to take to Vegas. You know it's gonna be all smashed to hell or blown up by the end of the movie, but what they do with it here was genius. Or how about the fact that Stu lied to his insane girlfriend about going to Vegas. Think she might find out? Who cares - everything ties together all the way from the first act to the third, and we appreciate the effort the writers put forth. If they are half as talented at writing action / sci-fi as they are at comedy, Michael Bay should hire them for the third Transformers film.The casting was perfected to a T. Everyone nails their character dead-on. Bradley Cooper is sincere as a guy who just wants to have a good time and can keep his cool when things don't go as planned. Ed Helms makes an excellent worrier when nothing goes as planned. And Zach Galifianakis was born to be the guy to cause everything to not go as planned.The Hangover will undoubtedly do for Galifianakis' career, what Tommy Boy did for Chris Farley. The man is already practically a comedic icon. He plays Alan exactly as Stu describes Alan's character, ""Don't let the beard fool you. He's a child."" Alan doesn't swear, he goes out for a night of partying in Vegas wearing a T-shirt with a painting of a wolf and he explains to the guys he won't be able to hang with them when they get back, because the Jonas brothers will be in town. We believe that Alan would behave the way he does and say the strange and sometimes moronic things he does, in every scene. Perhaps the best example of this would be when Stu tells him that his grandmother's holocaust ring is missing and Alan replies, ""I didn't know they gave out rings at the holocaust.""That's just one of many, folks. See it. After all, The Hangover has made cinematic history by becoming the highest grossing R-Rated comedy of all time.",5,The Hangover Review,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,5359,"['HANGOVERSTARRING',

But a friend of mine went to see it...then wanted to go see it again.  I've never known this guy to pay for a movie twice, so I was intrigued.  Could it be that could?It was.  The Hangover is perhaps the funniest film of 2009; arguably the funniest since Tropic Thunder.  The film follows four guys--Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, and Zack Galifianakis--as they take their buddy on a road trip before his wedding...then promptly lose him one drunken night.  They wake up the next morning, their lives in a mess, their car missing, and a tiger in the bathroom.  What follows is comedic gold.All three leads are phenomenal, with near-perfect comedic timing.  Supporting roles from contemporary farce mainstays Ken Jeong and Rob Riggle help round things out, while Mike Tyson's cameo is pitch-perfect.  Todd Phillips, the director, also helmed Old School...which, while a funny movie, really shouldn't be compared to The Hangover.  I haven't see a comedy like this in ages.

I'm not sure this film is worth watching more than once. But it is great to talk about with friends. Oh, and this is definitely a guy movie. On the other hand, I watched this tonight on my portable DVD player, and the flight attendant told me that she is constantly quoting this funny movie to her boy friend. So it might not be just a guy movie.I was very surprised to see intelligent use of the timeline to make this film much more interesting. The story is simple, we know from the outset that four guys go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party and the bachelor ends up missing. The fun of the film is seeing how that ending actually happens. What happened to destroy the Mercedes convertible, how did all three of these guys get beat up, and how did they end up in the desert? It is well worthwhile to watch the credits of the movie, something wonderfully funny happen.The film is most definitely for mature audiences. The R or Unrated versions are not for younger viewers. The humor is crude, the language is strong, there is full frontal male nudity (one of the funniest scenes is with Mr. Chow and the crow bar), and oddly there is very little female nudity (you would expect that on a trip to Las Vegas).Production values are surprisingly good in this film. There is virtually no shakycam. Sound is well recorded. The bonus features are really worth watching - the rather lengthy and complicated navigation for the map of disaster shows really good footage behind the scenes. The bonus features are dense and very good.This movie is crude guy humor. It is a much better road picture than I imagined. The trailers and descriptions do not do this film justice.

The groom-to-be disappears.  The rest of the movie is spent following the remaining three guys around Vegas while they try to figure out what happened.  Lots of slapstick comedy, lots of F*bombs, lots of guys mooning each other, one [...] shot of a stripper (Heather Graham)getting set to breast feed the baby that's in the movie poster, and then some final still photos at the end of one of the guys getting [...] from a really ugly woman.And oh, this isn't a Three Men and a Baby tale - the baby was only a very temporary prop for a couple of slapstick gags and that one gratuitous breastfeeding scene.  Then it mercifully disappeared from the story.Hardly a family-friendly movie, needless to say.What dreck.  What an utter waste of 100 minutes of life.  If there are chick flicks, this must be a ""stupid guy flick"".Addendum:  So many nice, thoughtful people have left such deep and thoughtful comments on my review of this rather trivial movie that I thought I should clarify a couple of earlier points I made.First of all, about that ""hardly family friendly"" comment.  The promotional photo/poster and the movie trailers did strongly imply a ""Three Men and a Baby"" sort of family-oriented, if R-rated, comedy movie (definitely some false advertising there).  So it was a bit of a shock to see that photo at the end of the movie of the ugly woman fellating Zach Galifianakis.  I was sitting next to my two teenagers at the time and they were shocked.  I have no qualms about letting my kids watch R-rated movies, and have for many years.  In the past, depictions of [...] automatically got a film a minimum of an NC-17 rating.  I do not take my kids to NC-17 rated films, or to [...] flicks.  How this movie escaped an NC-17 rating is a question for the MPAA.  Nobody ever watches NC-17 rated movies anymore (too much free porn kicking around I guess), and so obviously the producers of this movie must have greased somebody's palms to escape this rating.Second, I wasn't sure when I first wrote this review that there was such a thing as a ""stupid guy flick"". I kind of threw that term out there as a test.  So thanks everybody for leaving all of your comments!  You passed this test with flying colors!  Now I know for sure there is such a thing as a ""stupid guy flick""!Addendum 2:  Hmmm... did some more research to try to understand the obsessive, semi-psychotic fandom for this movie, which is beginning to surpass ""Trekkie"" geek levels.  Here's a few facts:It was recently reported that 40% of households in America now have a female in the household (""the breadwinner"") who earns as much or more than anybody else in the household.  For a number of years now, far more females have attended 4-year college than males - statistically females outnumber males by 2-to-1 in many universities.  Several years ago, females began to outnumber the number of males entering medical school.No, Toto, we are not in Kansas anymore, back in the days when men were men, women were women, etc.  Something has definitely happened to the males of America, turned  them from the responsible heads of households and father figures of olde, into... the sort of men depicted in this movie!So, everybody, keep on posting those comments!

1239733,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B001UV4XEM,Davewise,"[1, 2]","After all the hype and critical praise for this movie, I expected to laugh through much of this movie. I didn't. There were some funny scenes and lines, but it was seldom more than enough to make me chuckle. I didn't really sympathize with the main characters much. While I sometimes enjoy sophomoric humor, such as ""American Pie"", I really didn't find much of the sophomoric humor here to be truly funny. The ""gag reel"" included as an extra made me laugh harder than the movie itself.Doug is about to be married so he goes on a road trip to Las Vegas with his soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan and best friends Phil and Stu. Alan is described as everything from weird to dumb by his family and strangers alike; I found him to be the only really entertaining character in the bunch. Phil is a teacher with a wife and kid who hates his life and is looking to let it all out on the road trip. After seeing his wife and son later in the movie, I didn't understand why he would be so unhappy. Stu is a dentist who's about to propose his girlfriend despite the fact she doesn't seem to know the real him, tries to control his life, and cheated on him.The boys plan for one wild night in Vegas and get more than they planned for. Alan, Phil, and Stu wake up in their expensive hotel suite to find Doug is missing, Stu is missing a tooth, and there's a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet. In order to find Doug in time for the wedding the following day, they try to retrace their steps during the night none of them can remember. Soon they discover one of them got married to a stripper, who is played by Heather Graham and who seems to be a better character than most of the others. In the end, they get involved with the police, an Asian mafia-type after some money, and Mike Tyson.Somehow it sounds funnier than it actually ends up being. Yes, there were some funny lines, but there was also more than a fair share of jokes and insults more suitable to a high school. I've never been the type who wanted to spend a raucous night in Vegas like they did, so I can't sympathize much. The characters come across mostly as stupid and immature, deserving of what happens to them. At the same time, I didn't get all that much pleasure out of seeing what was done to them.

Trailer was funny but nothing spectacular, plot seems so ""many times seen"" (several guys go to Vegas for bachelor party and crazy things will happen) and main cast were relatively unknowns there's nothing to suggest anything promising. But those who have seen it can testify that it's a real comedy jewel and it was not surprise it become one of the most successful comedies.Todd Phillips as director managed to surpass his previous hits as Road Trip, Old School and Starsky and Hutch by merit of providing regular and consistent laughs amidst backdrop of a frenetic and unrelenting morning after.The problems with most comedies they have to put all their best laughs in the trailer, so by the time the movie comes around the funniest parts lose their impact and the rest of the movie is disappointing in comparison. The Hangover sidesteps this problem masterfully. We know guys will wake up with no memory of what went night before but these moments, although hilarious, aren't all what make the movie so good. The heart of the movie is in the chemistry between the three main actors - Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) - likable and identifiable enough for an audience to go along with events that could quite easily in another context seem ridiculous.This success mostly can be credited to casting in unfamiliar faces (when the movie was made) and the actors themselves deserve huge credit. That would mostly consider Cooper who back then was slightly familiar and now is big star.Movie director has no qualms when he puts his characters through so many problems, there's one shocking revelation after another as the people, animals and events they encountered the night before come back to them during the search for Doug. As the audience knows as little as the characters do, the reactions are completely true, they suspend disbelief as colossally silly events are only matched in magnitude by the sound of laughs in the theatre.The Hangover never quite lets up, the laughs even continue way into the credits, so it is not wonder that two sequels were made to this successful movie.Speaking about extras what you get is:- Picture In Picture commentary featuring three main actors and director- Cursing Mash Up - funny compilation of all the cursing in the movie- Iron Mike Online Teaser - the Champ's rendition of ""In The Air Tonight""- More pictures from The Missing Camera - 100+ added photos from the camera, pics you would screen out before you share with your friends- Map Of Destruction - 15 spots where movie was made on a selectable icon map that takes you to a brief clip regarding making-of info- The Madness Of Ken Jeong - brief movie shots of Ken Jeong, not so funny- Action Mash-Up - a brief action mix, not so good- Three Best Friends Song - looks funny in a movie, not so much in a longer version because they are not singers- The Dan Band! - clean version of the Fame song.- Gag Reel - funny, couple of minutes longGood edition with ok extras, but nothing special.Hangover has brilliant chemistry between actors and its plot make it better than you could possibly be expecting going in.

Centered around a bachelor trip to Vegas gone awry, this movie is not only hysterical, it's well-crafted and delivered by an extraordinary ensemble of actors.  There are no weak links here.Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha all bring their own unique talents to their roles as four pals celebrating one last guys' night out before one of them (Bartha) gets hitched on Sunday.  Of course, their first night on the town goes astray once their drinks are laced with Rohypnol; they all wake up on Saturday morn with no memory of what took place the night before, and worse still, they've lost the groom-to-be.  Their subsequent ""quest"" to find their pal drives the engine of this comedy, as their wacky adventures have them crossing paths with the likes of a delightfully insane Ken Jeong to Mike Tyson (playing himself).

1239759,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001UV4XEM,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","I would have never considered seeing this 2009 bro-mantic comedy were it not for the fact that it has been garnering such strong critical reviews. My curiosity was piqued since on the surface, the film represents a sophomoric genre that targets a more juvenile, male-oriented audience. However, director Todd Philips (Old School) infuses what could have been a tired premise with a no-holds-barred comedic sense which is refreshingly consistent and surprisingly human. The pacing is so frenetically furious that the filmmakers give a viewer little time to question the credibility of the often ridiculous plot turns. Written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the story revolves around a typical Vegas bachelor party where three close buddies get together for one last night of drink and debauchery. The trio of prospective groom Doug, straitlaced dentist Stu (who is engaged to a controlling harpy), and cynical schoolteacher Phil is joined by the bride's brother, Alan, a bearded, beer-bellied and socially awkward geek who turns out to be a little too desperate to be a natural member of this fraternal clan.The newly established quartet drives from LA to Vegas and ends up staying in a palatial $4,200-a-night suite at Caesar's Palace. After a rooftop J&auml;germeister toast, we flash forward to the morning after with their room completely trashed. Inflatable sex dolls in the hot tub, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in a closet, a hospital band on Phil's wrist, and Stu's missing front incisor are the only clues they have to figure out what happened the night before. Even worse, Doug is missing, and they have approximately 24 hours to find him for the wedding. What Philips does cleverly is turn his comic hi-jinks story into a detective story without sacrificing any of the raucous comedy. In fact, the subsequent plot draws broader and broader circles of implausibility with each development reinforcing the absurdist tone with sharp precision. Not too surprisingly, as the movie provides greater clarity on what exactly happened, the movie starts to lose momentum and becomes rather predictable with the inevitable climax of a high-speed scene. Nonetheless, some of the sight gags and set pieces are unapologetically hilarious, for instance, a stun-gun demo for a classroom of grade school children, a naked gangster pouncing from a car trunk, and a highly inappropriate rendition of 50 Cents'Candy Shopat the wedding reception.Much of the film's success has to do with the easy rapport that the four principals have with each other. The absence of a dominating comedy figure like Will Ferrell or Steve Carell actually helps this time around. As Phil, Bradley Cooper (He's Just Not That Into You) somehow manages to make the standard role of the cocksure alpha male into a genuinely likeable character. Ed Helms (Andy in the US version ofThe Office) appears to be channeling a bit of Stephen Colbert in bringing out Stu's neurotic, self-protective tendencies. However, most of the laughs are supplied by stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis, who makes Alan not only the model social outcast but also a subconscious manifestation of all the well-intentioned actions that get us in trouble. Justin Bartha has little to do as Doug, as does Heather Graham as an obliging stripper/hooker who finds herself married to Stu.

This movie deserves 4/5 stars for its lessons, depictions, and incredibly funny suspense.The Hangover is a comedy about four friends who go on a bachelor party in Las Vegas. One of them accidently gives them ruphies. They wake up the next morning knowing nothing. Even worse, they lost their friend. Then they go all around Las Vegas trying to find him.I bought the movie in 2010 because everyone told me it was so funny. I didn't believe them but watching the film made me a believer.The Hangover tells a good lesson on what not to do when you go to Las Vegas. The terrible things that happen to them tell you not to do it.The movie shows a great depiction of the city of Las Vegas. It shows how beautiful the city is and what all you can do there. The film shows Ceasar's Palace and the many casinos there.Finally, The Hangover has incredibly funny suspense. The things they go through to find their friend will make you laugh.The only downside to the movie that I have found is that it is rated R so children cannot see it.

Everyone enjoyed it and laughed a lot. I liked it both times, the second time as much as the first one, and this is not usually my kind of comedies. I prefer my comedy more sophisticated, subtle, witty, but Hangover somehow won me over. It started and ended fairly predictable, but in the middle - the night that four friends spent conquering Las Vegas and throwing the bachelor party to end all bachelor parties, of which they have no recollection the following morning, -this part of the movie was very funny. Just to picture once again in my mind the battle field that their posh hotel suite in the Cesar's Palace has became, with the Bengal tiger occupied the bathroom and meeting every visitor with the scary roar, with the lonely chicken walking on the floor, and with the baby-by in the closet, makes me laugh again. And I did not mention that one of the friends is missing his front tooth, another is wearing the hospital wrist band, and the groom has disappeared in the thin air. Did the tiger eat him or did he turn into the chicken or became a baby?  When Mike Tyson appears in the middle of the film as a visitor of three friends who were desperately looking for their friend and tried to figure out what exactly did happen last night, I knew that I liked the movie. Tyson singing in unison with Phil Collins and demanding that his pet-tiger who was stolen from his mansion must be delivered back to him or else, was a stroke of genius. Don Luis Bunuel would have loved that scene, I am sure.We were watching uncut full version. Many of the jokes were far below the waist but the performers seem amused at what they were doing on the screen, and when this happens, then the audience laugh. Not for sensitive viewers, who easily blush and get insulted.The Hangover may be described in two sentences,  what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas and with the opening line from Mr. Doolittlle song in My Fair Lady,""Just get me to the church in time"". We all have seen many movies about bachelor parties, Vegas, hangover, and male bonding. Hangover does not tell anything new but thanks to the clever writing and the real chemistry among Bradley Cooper (Phil, the schoolteacher), Ed Helms (Stu, the dentist), and Zach Galiifanakis (nerdy, socially akward brother-in-low to be homage to the Rainman), the film keeps the viewers interest and provides more than few laughs.

1239782,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001UV4XEM,Grady Harp,"[3, 10]","THE HANGOVER apparently swept the country, touted as the funniest film ever made. And indeed the proof of its success lies in the fact that THE HANGOVER 2 is in post-production.  So there is more on the way.  The question arises, 'more what?'  Apparently resting on the information gathered from television sitcoms and other raunchy potty mouth movies like 'Borat' etc.,  there is an audience for films that pose middle aged men as men in their 20s performing acts that are more like boys in their misbegotten teens.  It is amazing that these films that put down African Americans (like the manipulation of Mike Tyson and the dumb drug dealer character 'Black Doug'  portrayed by Mike Epps) and Asian Americans (like the foolish over-the-top fop of 'Mr Chow' by Jen Keong, etc etc etc are not confronted.  But then it may appear that all is fair in cinema 'comedy'.The premise is that four friends go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party before the wedding of the most mild of them all.  Bradley Cooper (a teacher), Ed Helms (a dentist), Zach Galifianakis (the obese mentally disturbed brother of the bride) and Justin Bartha (the groom to be) spend one lost night of doped drunken misadventures and wake up in an hotel suite with a chicken, a tiger,  a mess, hangovers and amnesia, and a missing groom.  The remainder of the film is simple the antics of these broken down individuals attempting to find the groom and to right some infractions of behavior. Is that funny?  Well, apparently to the vast number of people who see this film it is. So here comes the next installment in what will likely be a long line of gross-out sequels. Meanwhile the beautiful adult movies languish in oblivion.  To this we've come?

But it isn't terrible, and it's not the gross out comedy that many have said it is.  It's a mediocre film at best that has some funny moments, and has some moments that make you wonder who could write such a bad script.Many times in the film you see a situation (like when the boys wake up and find a tiger in the bathroom), and the characters in the film constantly say ""oh my god, there's a tiger in the bathroom.  How the f*** did that tiger get in the bathroom?  Man, I can't remember how that tiger got in the bathroom"" and so on and so on.  This type of situation happens a lot during the film (especially the first half), and it's really poor scripting.  The first half drags because of this poor scripting.  I almost shut the DVD off, but luckily, the film picks up in the 2nd half.  It's almost like the filmmakers realised that they had to finish the film, and decided to wrap things up very, very quickly.Bradley Cooper's character is a very smarmy guy and not very sympathetic.  The dentist is actually a decent sort saddled with a ferociously bitchy girlfriend (played by Rachel Harris), and Zach G plays a guy who is supposed to be nerdy and funny, but quite often he comes across as weird and creepy, not funny.  But there are some good moments in the film, especially the scene where the 3 guys are in the police station, and one of the officers (played by Rob Riggle) calls Zach G ""fat Jesus"".  Then the 3 guys get tazed by the cops and an audience of kids touring the police station.  It's the funniest scene in the film.  The black drug dealer (called Black Doug in the film) is also a good character and the performance is very funny.While this film is overhyped, it is not the most overrated comedy I've ever seen (that honor still belongs to Knocked Up), and I didn't feel like I was cheated after watching the movie.  Aside from Bradley Cooper's character, the overall tone of the film isn't smug.  It's just light.  So, watch the movie if you like this type of humour.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","Man, I know there's nothing at all funny about a car door accidentally slamming into a baby's face... except I couldn't help laughing, anyway. I say THE HANGOVER deserves all the good buzz it's generated. There were so many crazy and laugh-out-loud moments in this film, I was non-stop cracking up. The film's premise sets you up for a compelling mystery, turns your head with its hints of what must have been one hell of a forgotten wild night in Vegas.Three hung-over friends wake up in a sorely trashed suite in Caesars Palace, and with no memory of the night before. In rapid order they find, among other peculiar things, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, a chicken clucking around, and that one of them has lost a tooth. And also that the fourth guy in their group has gone missing. Much of THE HANGOVER details the guys' piecing together various clues, retracing their steps, trying to find out what the hell happened the night before and just where is their missing friend... who's due to be married the next day.You assume, going in, that you know what to expect. Crude humor. Maybe some silly slapstick. A healthy serving of raunchiness. And, mind you, this is the same director that did OLD SCHOOL and ROAD TRIP. And, yeah, we do visit the same landscape, all of the above stuff mentioned. Except better. I don't know if I can pin-point it exactly. THE HANGOVER doesn't have the heart of KNOCKED UP or KNOCKED UP's sweet unlikely romance, and I do think that Heather Graham should've been given more scenes. But I think the screenplay is really good. Then there's the smart execution. The dialogue is outrageous and wicked funny and there is a minefield of memorable one-liners. The core players, while not exactly given deeply explored character arcs, have sharply delineated personalities and these guys certainly play off each other effectively. The leads are each saddled with his personal albatross. Stu the straight-laced dentist is living in relationship hell, constantly bullied by his overbearing girlfriend. Phil the school teacher is larcenous and immature and an unrepentant instigator. And oh dear God, Alan... Alan is overweight and a man-child and weird as [...]-all. Doug, well, Doug's gone missing.A sweet-natured hooker, a simpering Asian crime lord, a singing Mike Tyson, and more. One improbable thing after another keeps piling on, and you can't help but get suckered in if only to see how everything fits. And while not everything does get explained away - like, what exactly was up with the chicken? - you'll find that enough light is shed on the unrecollected crazy that went down. It's advised that you stick around for the end credits, as even more 'splainin' unfolds.THE HANGOVER has no pretense about what it is. It aims for low brow laughs, and it hits the target more so than it misses. I frankly don't think it misses that often. It for sure doesn't try to impart life lessons, except that you maybe do learn one thing: nothing good can ever come from bachelor parties in Vegas.

It has its very funny moments--quite a few--but what stays with me is how it's basically a '50s movie done with contemporary sexual and language license. That's to say, its social attitudes are incredibly retrograde, even reactionary.First, it's really racist. The premise involves four White guys who were good buds in high school...of course they're all White! All American high schools are racially segregated, we know that! They have a (very) wild weekend in Vegas, and the wildness is largely embodied in Freaky Colored People: a small, deranged, probably gay Chinese-American gangster; a no-more-odd-than-usual Mike Tyson, in an important cameo bit; a not-bright African-American drug dealer; and a hyper, super-super-friendly Middle-Eastern pimp/quickie-wedding chapel hustler. Come to think of it, virtually nobody they meet in Vegas is White (except of course the gorgeous, really-a-good-soul hooker).The clear point is that these Colored Folks are Other: part of the weird, exotic world of Vegas, the adult White people's dirty Disneyland. The assumption is that White (and upper middle class) is the real world, and everybody else is comic relief. ""The Hangover"" is totally pitched to a White audience, and to enjoy it, you have to be comfortable self-identifying that way: ""I'm a White person! I live in White world! I don't have to worry about any of my friends ""of color"" being offended by this movie--because I don't have any!""Besides the creepily taken-for-granted racism, it goes without saying that the women back home are either annoying whiners or ball-breakers; in Vegas, prostitutes. The guy who's getting married is marrying a rich girl; her father generously offers the four his beloved old silver Mercedes sedan for the road trip--and we're obviously supposed to be impressed by both car and rich Dad. A Mercedes! Not a Lambo, not a Jag, not even a 'Vette...but a vintage diplomat's car!

1239809,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B001UV4XEM,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","My husband and I found this movie to be very hilarious. What I like about its basically one movie that goes from one crazy event to another. Yet it doesn't loose it's focus on its main plot and also knows to find the time to work on its characters as well. The characters are all being handled and build-up well into the movie. It's the same type of comedy approach Director Phillips used earlier for movies such as ""Road Trip"" and ""Old School"". Todd Phillips knows how to bring teenage lame humor as something hilarious and also convincing.The movie relies heavily on its main concept. It feels like though that the entire story got based around the writers thoughts of having a couple of guys wake up in a wrecked hotel room and things are missing and other things suddenly are in their room and most importantly one of their buddies who is about to get married is missing. It's like they first come up with this idea and then decided to write and base the entire story around this. This has as a result though that not all things reach a satisfying closure. It also has as a result that things get raveled at times, as can best been seen during its end credits when gets revealed what happened all during their long night, they remembered nothing about the next morning.So well, no, the movie isn't perfect but still it's one of the more enjoyable ones of recent years, along with ""Tropic Thunder"". The movie is throughout funny and even during its weaker moments it knows to entertain, which is also due to its characters. The movie has a sort of adventurous feeling over it, since the movie jumps from the one extreme event into the other one. It's a comedy-odyssey.The movie doesn't really feature any well known comedy actors in it for its main parts. This works well though for the story I feel, since in cases when movies have big comedy-stars in it, the movie and its humor mostly rely on the performances from those stars and puts most of the emphasis one them. In this case it can rely more on its story, situations and the characters as individuals. The movie still features some well known actors in it though, mostly in some cameo-roles. There are not too many though, which is a good thing, so it doesn't ever get distracting.

1239811,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B001UV4XEM,J from NY,"[0, 2]","Director Todd Phillips has done that rarest of things with this film--made an actually hilarious comedy, not one that is a corny embarrassment to both oneself and the people around them.  Example:(Hot Tub Time Machine.Four guys--Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Ed Helms (Stu Price), Zach Galifianakis (Alan Garner in an eccentric turn of brilliance as a sage-like manchild), and soon-to-be-married Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) decide to hit Vegas and have a wild time before their friend gets hitched. Not before encountering a very angry Mike Tyson, a sociopathic gay Chinese gangster, and a bunch of Indian guys who run a compromised church for intoxicated men looking to get ""married"".Nearly every turn of dialogue in this movie is an exercise in self or-other deprecating black humor punctuated by strange moments of compassion.

My main problem with this film was not the stupid and repetitive humor but the uninteresting characters that we have to route for and hope they find their best friend Doug. Who cares about Doug or their journey to find out how he got kidnapped? The humor relies heavily upon random, bizarre, and illogical bursts of different characters, infliction of pain, random celebrity cameo's (Mike Tyson) and just bad dialogue. I usually don't mind this type of humor when it is executed properly and in a timely fashion.This film, on the other hand, is just a poor excuse for another college humor comedy. The sad part is that these hero's were supposed to be routing for are like in their 30's with wives and kids, pathetic. Now we don't have to scratch our heads and realize why male adults act like their still in college and milk their party years till their 50.

1239826,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001UV4XEM,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","The Hangover is the wildly successful, 2009 buddy-comedy directed by Todd Phillips that has become a cultural phenomenon and has a sequel being released in the next couple of months. When I first saw the trailer, it revealed a comedy that took place in Vegas, had a couple moments worthy of smirking about, and a cameo by Mike Tyson. It didn't appear to be anything special and I expected it to be moderate box-office success, mildly funny, but unmemorable. I was wrong...The Hangover is not without its generic moments, but it's a fresh, hilarious comedy that is still funny even after seeing it several times.Phillips opens his film in the middle of the story with Phil (Bradley Cooper) telling a woman over the telephone that he can't find Doug and she won't be getting married in the next few hours. Hours earlier, Doug (Justin Bartha) left for Las Vegas with Phil, Stu (Ed Helms), and his soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis) for his bachelor party. While the night starts off well, the next morning everyone awakens in their destroyed hotel suite to find that not only is Doug missing...But there's a tiger in the bathroom. Of course, the rest of the film is about the three hung-over friends trying to find Doug before his wedding and the ridiculous (yet hilarious) situations they find themselves in.What immediately separates this movie from the typical idiotic comedy is the characters, particularly the three leads. These are not generic, stock-characters; they have their own established personalities and are all likeable for their own reason. Phil is a school-teacher, married with a child, looking forward to getting away from his boring life; Stu is a dentist, whose over-bearing girlfriend beats him; Alan is an awkward, inept man-child. The chemistry of these three actors, whose varied styles of humor complement each other and make for an even funnier film, is the main reason why this film works, while credit must also must be given to the writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (as well as Todd Phillips and Jeremy Garelick, who are uncredited). The actors are given material to work with that has some of the contrivances of other, less memorable comedies but has better characterization, a little more originality, and never seems to strain for laughs. Even the Mike Tyson-cameo, which I expected to just be a typical unnecessary celebrity cameo, is actually pretty funny.There's hardly a minute of this film that isn't hilarious and it's filled with memorable, quotable dialogue. While it's almost a clich&eacute; to mention now, try keeping a straight-face during Alan's ""wolf-pack"" speech. The hilarity doesn't end when the credits begin to roll either, as you'll see. I've seen The Hangover four times and what has impressed me even more about this film is how it's gotten better and funnier on each viewing, while I expected the opposite. The Hangover is a surprising success in more ways than one and while it's reached a level of success that has caused many people to shout ""it's overrated,"" you will likely embrace this movie the way most of the world has. If you're looking for an all-out, laugh-a-minute comedy you shouldn't be disappointed by this. Despite its enduring popularity, I can't say for sure if this film will go down in comedy history, but I didn't expect it to become the highest grossing R-rated comedy in United States box-office history either.GRADE: A-",5,Just As Funny As You've Heard,1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,3415,"['Hangover', 'wildly', 'successful', '2009', 'buddy-comedy', 'directed', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'become', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'sequel', 'being', 'released', 'next', 'couple', 'months', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'revealed', 'comedy', 'took', 'place', 'Vegas', 'had', 'couple', 'moments', 'worthy', 'smirking', 'cameo', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'anything', 'special', 'expected', 'be', 'moderate', 'box-office', 'success', 'mildly', 'funny', 'unmemorable', 'was', 'wrong', 'Hangover', 'not', 'generic', 'moments', 'fresh', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'still', 'funny', 'even', 'seeing', 'several', 'times.Phillips', 'film', 'middle', 'story', 'Phil', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'telling', 'woman', 'telephone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'Doug', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'married', 'next', 'few', 'hours', 'Hours', 'earlier', 'Doug', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'left', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Phil', 'Stu', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'soon-to-be', 'brother-in-law', 'Alan', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'bachelor', 'party', 'night', 'off', 'well', 'next', 'morning', 'everyone', 'destroyed', 'hotel', 'suite', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'Doug', 'missing', 'tiger', 'bathroom', 'course', 'rest', 'film', 'three', 'hung-over', 'friends', 'trying', 'find', 'Doug', 'wedding', 'ridiculous', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'find', 'in.What', 'immediately', 'movie', 'typical', 'idiotic', 'comedy', 'characters', 'particularly', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'not', 'generic', 'stock-characters', 'have', 'own', 'established', 'personalities', 'are', 'likeable', 'own', 'reason', 'Phil', 'school-teacher', 'married', 'child', 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'away', 'boring', 'life', 'Stu', 'dentist', 'over-bearing', 'girlfriend', 'Alan', 'awkward', 'inept', 'man-child', 'chemistry', 'three', 'actors', 'varied', 'styles', 'humor', 'complement', 'other', 'make', 'even', 'funnier', 'film', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'credit', 'must', 'also', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'writers', 'Jon', 'Lucas', 'Scott', 'Moore', 'as', 'well', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'Jeremy', 'Garelick', 'who', 'are', 'uncredited', 'actors', 'are', 'given', 'material', 'work', 'contrivances', 'other', 'less', 'memorable', 'comedies', 'better', 'characterization', 'little', 'more', 'originality', 'never', 'strain', 'laughs', 'Even', 'Mike', 'Tyson-cameo', 'expected', 'just', 'be', 'typical', 'unnecessary', 'celebrity', 'cameo', 'actually', 'pretty', 'hardly', 'minute', 'film', ""n't"", 'hilarious', 'filled', 'memorable', 'quotable', 'dialogue', 'almost', 'clich', 'eacute', 'mention', 'now', 'try', 'keeping', 'straight-face', 'Alan', 'wolf-pack', 'speech', 'hilarity', ""n't"", 'end', 'when', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', 'either', ""'ll"", 'see', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Hangover', 'four', 'times', 'impressed', 'even', 'more', 'film', 'how', 'gotten', 'better', 'funnier', 'viewing', 'expected', 'opposite', 'Hangover', 'surprising', 'success', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'reached', 'level', 'success', 'caused', 'many', 'people', 'shout', 'overrated', 'will', 'likely', 'embrace', 'movie', 'way', 'most', 'world', ""'re"", 'looking', 'all-out', 'laugh-a-minute', 'comedy', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'enduring', 'popularity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'sure', 'film', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'comedy', 'history', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'become', 'highest', 'grossing', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'United', 'States', 'box-office', 'history', 'either.GRADE', 'A-']",The Hangover - UNRATED

Some say of all time.I think going into it thinking it was going to be funny spoiled it for us.  If it had just been advertised as an action film or a mystery film we would have enjoyed it more.  It is rather like a mystery: you all know the basic set-up how three of the guys wake up hungover in a trashed luxury suite at Caesar's Palace with various odd things in place that shouldn't have been there (baby, tiger, chicken), and things are missing (Ed Helms' front tooth, the groom), and the plot is trying to figure out not ""what's wrong with this picture"" but basically how to make it right again.  I kept hoping that the groom would be dead, and that one of the groomsmen would snap to and remember he had killed him.  But that is partially because I dislike the actor Justin Bartha, I'm not saying the story would have been better.Yet in a way the movie was sort of like CRAZY HEART turned inside out.  CRAZY HEART had the same sort of basic plot (except it was just one guy waking up from a massive hangover that had lasted his whole life) attempting to mend things by going to AA and making amends to the child he has nearly lost.This story was more elaborate and had a few more laughs, but I have to say, Ed Helms is better in The Office, Bradley Cooper was better in Alias, and Zach G much better in Bored to Death on HBO.  As for Heather Graham, well, the movie doesn't seem to have done much for her career (while people laughed at Lindsay Lohan for turning it down), but maybe it's because Heather G. looks so strange here: oh, the miseries of bad plastic surgeons and playing a stripper slash escort while breastfeeding.

With no clue as to what transpired and little time to spare, the trio must retrace their hazy steps and all their bad decisions in order to figure out where things went wrong and hopefully get Doug back to L.A. in time to walk down the aisle.The cast led by Bradley Cooper (as Phil), Ed Helms (as Stu), Zach Galifianakis (as Alan) & Justin Bartha (as Doug) is great!

The audience I witnessed this with were rolling in the aisles, perceiving perhaps tons more than I possibly did - but the stark reality is that this is a motion picture that intends to shock and awe with its' series of gratuitous inappropriate gags, and for a large part these gags just do not work.The seemingly hilarious script seems contrived and ineffective, and the performances are decidedly one-note. That said, ""The Hangover"" represents a new low for cinema in general, only because the five star reviews from critics for this particular motion picture, are both unwarranted and misguided. Lead actor Bradley Cooper and Heather Graham have some of the most ludicrous situations to work with, but there isn't really any 'acting' going on, so to speak.Any scenes that involve humor directed upon and toward infants (in this case of a sexually suggestive nature) and seem to glorify and patronize infant violence is absolutely intolerable. Even with the ethical elements removed, these scenes weren't even that funny. Zach Galifianakis, who did exceptional work on `Tru Calling' is reduced to a slab of ridiculousness, and the celebrity guest roles do nothing for the enterprise.This was more like a collection of vignettes than an actual feature film. As both a commercial and critical venture, this is very far removed from what a comedy ought to be, and this is disappointing.

Sadly, when an underdog goes from word of mouth hit to hype machine, there's a potential for disappointment.  Luckily, even with the hype I was very happy with the hangover.  I'd like to go through a retelling of the funniest parts in providing this review, but I don't want to ruin anything for those who haven't seen it. Rather, I will say that this comedy's humor revolves around the crazy, and unpredictable antics of three buddies who awake after a night of partying, unable to recall the night before.  Simply finding out what happened would be funny enough, but the fact that one of their friends is missing, and their sleuthing to retrace their night, adds an extra level of fun, in trying to solve the mystery with them.Getting past the hype, the critics, the box office, the hangover is a very funny, and very clever movie, that will entertain you.  While it happens to be an R-Rated comedy, they do not go out of their way to use the rating as an excuse for gross gags (though there are a few).

The next thing they know they are waking up in their suite the next day which has been trashed and has both a live tiger in the bathroom and a baby (see the poster) in it and their friend to be married has disappeared.The rest of the movie has them trying to piece together what happened the previous night and to locate their missing friend.

After they go to Vegas and have a toast to a night that they'll never forget, Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up the next morning without Doug and completely unaware of what it is they did the night before.  The three men put together their exploits which saw them cross paths with an escort/stripper with a heart of gold (Heather Graham), a crazy yet effeminate mobster (Ken Jeong), and even Mike Tyson (himself) in a night full of improbabilities.  Will the men be able to find their missing friend Doug?  Will Doug make it back in town for his wedding?  And will the guys eventually figure out everything that happened the night before?I thought this film was one of the best comedies I've seen in a while.  Judging by the amount of negative reviews, I will be inclined to acknowledge that this movie is definitely not suitable for minors (largely due to the image of a street hooker performing unsimulated fellatio on a prosthetic penis worn by Galifianakis) or for people who are very sensitive to the gross-out humor found in the film (though I don't think a film would be allowed to be released if the ""baby masturbation"" joke would have constituted sexual abuse.)  Make no mistake though, anyone who's afforded the opportunity to go to Vegas or even much less have had one of ""those"" nights that they couldn't remember will find an abundance of entertainment through out the film.In the end, it was the cast and the director that did it for me.  I wouldn't consider any of the lead actors to be big-money players (though this movie unquestionably raised Galifianakis's stock).  Yet since they had different elements of comedy that they brought to the screen, the chemistry was undeniably strong and made the film that much more believable.  Director Todd Phillips has honed his craft for comedy with other films such asOld SchoolandStarsky & Hutchbut was able to execute a movie that received critical acclaim without having to have a whole lot of star power up front.  I think this was, by far, his best effort and I have to applaud him for that.I recommend this film for anyone old enough to watch it but not for those who are a bit more prudent with their sense of humor.",4,"Entertaining As Hell, Though Definitely NOT A Kid Film!

Ken Jeong also was great in his crazy kind of way.  He was a little too close to his character on Community in the crazy department, but the way he is introduced in the movie was very funny.  I also liked Justin Bartha as the missing groom.  Although he ultimately was not in the movie much, his deadpan sarcastic delivery was very good.  There were quite a few cameos in the film but the best by far was Mike Tyson.  He ended up being in a couple scenes and was actually very good.While I don't think this was the best comedy of all time as some have billed it, it is very good.  Definitely one of the better ones in recent memory.  Like I said earlier this is not going to appeal to everyone, but if you like the type of humor then you will love this.",4,Great comedy,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,1251,"['definitely', 'have', 'be', 'more', 'raunchy', 'comedies', 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'fan', 'kind', 'humor', 'great', 'now', 'everyone', 'basic', 'story', 'guys', 'go', 'Vegas', 'bachelor', 'party', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'remembering', 'nothing', 'missing', 'groom', 'rest', 'movie', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'find', 'missing', 'groom.Of', 'main', 'cast', 'far', 'standout', 'was', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'playing', 'awkward', 'kind', 'creepy', 'brother', 'law', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'also', 'was', 'great', 'crazy', 'kind', 'way', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'character', 'Community', 'crazy', 'department', 'way', 'introduced', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'also', 'liked', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'missing', 'groom', 'ultimately', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'much', 'deadpan', 'sarcastic', 'delivery', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'cameos', 'film', 'best', 'far', 'was', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'couple', 'scenes', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'best', 'comedy', 'time', 'have', 'billed', 'very', 'good', 'Definitely', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'recent', 'memory', 'said', 'earlier', 'not', 'going', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'like', 'type', 'humor', 'then', 'will', 'love']",The Hangover - UNRATED

The same setup of a rich California family, pre wedding setup, bachelor party pursuit of fun, destination Las Vegas.  I then have to wait to see how the movie would surpass or differ from The Marrying Man.The forceful injection of ridiculous act to invoke laughter failed due to the incoherent scenario. First was the bride's brother that could not keep his rear end in his pants at adult age. Then comes three middle class well-educated adults who could not figure out that the odd-behaving bride's brother would do them much harm.The abrupt transition in the movie of three confused men waking up in the morning with complete amnesia searching for the groom-to-be could not make of any thing but silly and forcible joke.  Every alibi the three amnesic people could find to connect the dots in finding the missing fourth was also ridiculous due to the inconsistent and fragmented performance of each of those who could explain how the three intoxicated fellows spent their intoxicated time in absurdity.Most probably, Mike Tyson rehabilitated his maniacal image by his sane actions better than producer did of the movie.The climax of fun was supposedly the acts homosexual scene, sex between a man and a tiger, and of dentist pulling his own teeth to invoke laughter.

It's very raunchy as expected and earns an R rating many times over, but it doesn't get quite as extreme as I thought it would. There is something about letting loose in a packed theater when a movie is truly funny and everyone is having a great time. I'm so glad I listened to the critic's positive reviews on this movie and avoided seeing Land of the Lost, which they are bashing the life out of. The casting of the three main guys is excellent, giving everyone a chance to shine as the film unfolds. Zach Galifianakis (what a last name!) is the real star of the show here, mixing a creepy and weird vibe with some great line delivery. He creates a very memorable character.The only minor complaint I have is that the trailers should have not given away so much, like with the Mike Tyson scene. I had probably seen that part at least two dozen times before on TV, so it barely got a laugh out of me this time around.There are just so many clever gags and I don't want to spoil them for you, but make sure you stay when the end credits start to roll.

If you like crazy/funny movies, this one is for you.This movie is about four guys going to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. They go out that night and don't remember a thing the next morning. When they get situated, they cannot find their friend Doug. They go out in the city in search for him. They go through some awesome and crazy things while looking for their friend. One thing is that they stole a police car that night from these dumb cops. The cops find them and arrest them. In order to get out of jail, they make a deal with the cops to use their stun guns on them for a demonstration with kids. There are many other laughable things that they do.One reason to see this movie is because it is a non-stop laughing movie.

The movie succeeds in creating a silly comedy mystery of the absurd, and I admit I laughed often.  Too often, however, I could see the punch line from a mile away.  The movie is a series of neatly crafted punch lines without a compelling overriding comedy.  That is, every joke is the same or a more extreme variation on the same.  And so, the movie was more of an over-hyped letdown than a more genre-critical tour de force like Tropic Thunder.  I compare the two movies because they rely on the audience's previous knowledge of comedy film history, but Tropic Thunder succeeds in delivering actual Hollywood criticism where The Hangover manages the singular enticement of mere gross-out humor.

Yes, there is a baby, but that's only a brief part of the overall mayhem and hilarity.  I will be honest...when I first heard about this film and saw it's trailers, I suspected it might be one of those slapstick comedies of which we've all seen a dime a dozen.  But no, everyone put in that extra effort and as a result, The Hangover was something more.  I did find the two cops in the interrogation scene a bit over the top (the cops from ""Horrible Bosses"" might have been the better choice), but I'll let that go..this film is too good for me to go and be petty.  After all, I'm naming it my second favorite film of all time.  Of course, this film's success can be largely attributed to its three leading men.  Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis display a chemistry that properly develops throughout the film so the trio grows closer as we simultaneously come to sympathize more and more with their plight.  Ken Jeong is the wild card that every comedy surely wishes for and his unpredictability as an actor and in his character's role makes him the perfect foil for the three leads.  I have been a fan of Justin Bartha's since the first National Treasure film and feel that his talents were underused in this feature.  But I suppose that someone had to be missing for this plot to work...maybe the producers should have used someone less talented.  Then again, Mr. Bartha delivered such a strong performance in his brief time on the screen that it perhaps strengthened his friends' quest to find him as an audience would surely want for his safe return at the same time as any of the characters.  Someone else who didn't see nearly enough screen time was the waiting bride Tracy, played by Sasha Barrese.  They ought to have had her go out to Vegas to lead in the search for the missing groom.  But having a level-headed, take-charge person in this search party would have probably sped things up by a lot and ruined pretty much all comedic aspects of the plot.  So ultimately, it is good that the producers don't listen to me as this film would otherwise be very dull.  Instead, it is my favorite comedy of all time and my second favorite movie of all time.  Watch it and you'll see why and perhaps give it similar rankings on your own lists...if you're as geeky as myself and actually have those lists.

1239924,A39W3263A9HCMN,B001UV4XEM,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[1, 4]","The problem with a lot of American comedy is that they usually start off really funny and then soon plateau after 15 minutes. Of recent memory, the only good American comedies I've seen this year would be this, Observe and Report, Pineapple Express, the indie sleeper hit Zach and Miri Make a Porno (heavily underrated), and I Love You Man. Land of the Lost was pure poison, Step Brothers is a complete waste of film, Beer in Hell, as much as the book was funny, is one I will not see and looks like it has the production values of a Jan Terri music video.I was not expecting this to be that great. I had seen the trailer with Observe and Report (which I LOVED) and thought it was funny, but it looked like one I should wait till it comes out on Blu-Ray. However, midway into July, I managed to get ahold of a screener copy of the movie through a friend. So my family and I sat on the couch and watched it together.That said, I was surprised by how good it was! I mean, I was expecting another run of the mill, brash and rude and crude comedy. But no, this film was pure epic comedy at its best. Hell, I hate to commit blasephemy but this movie is really up there with comedy classics like Dr. Strangelove and There's Something About Mary. In fact, it may be the new TSAM. Here you have a fairly uncommon cast with a few surprises, including the gorgeously hot Heather Grahm, and even a cameo from the champ boxer Mike Tyson himself! Don't worry, no ears get bitten off here.The Midnight Meat Train's Bradley Cooper,Semi-Pro's Ed Helms, Comedian Zach Gilifonakis andNational Treasure 2: Book of Secrets' Justin Bartha all star in this hilarious comedy about a group of four guys going to Vegas for one of their's bachelor party. They have an awesome night... except they wake up with their room trashed, Mike Tyson's tiger in their bathroom, and no memory of what happens. What comes for the next 2 days includes getting arrested, finding out one was married, losing money, and more!!! Even worse, the team has been reduced to 3, because one has disappeared! Now they have to continue this horrible weekend no matter what it takes to get through... and make it to the wedding!Let's face it, this movie is the ultimate comedy of the 2000s. I thought Superbad was a hell of an epic comedy! Well, not so much after seeing The Hangover. THe Hangover is a brilliant comedy that not only makes you laugh, but relates to real life too- people spend their lives unnecessarily getting drunk. There are tons of belly laughs, lots of WTF moments, great performances from the stellar cast, and a comedy experiences that will leave you talking about if for months to come.So if you haven't seen this, it's not too late to see it yet. I reccommend it- Finally some GOOD american humor! I haven't seen Zombieland, but I intend to eventually- apparently this and Zombieland re the two best comedies of 09.

1239932,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001UV4XEM,RMurray847,"[2, 3]","THE HANGOVER is the kind of movie that absolutely cries out to be seen with a group.  The best bet would be to see it in a theatre, but if you have to settle for DVD, be sure to invite lots of friends over.  It's really the kind of raucous comedy that relies on an audience to feed the laughter.  Some funny things happen...not necessarily hilarious, but amusing.  A couple of folks laugh.  Then another modestly funny thing happens, and some more folks laugh at THAT.  Then you laugh at something else...not the most hysterically funny thing in the world, but funny enough.  And so on for a bit.  And soon, the original group is laughing again.  And thus, it mixes up, and before you know it, you've got a viewing experience in which a good chunk of the audience is laughing outloud at any given moment...giving the impression that movie is funny from start to finish.On the other hand, I believe that I if you watched it alone, you would NOT laugh as much.  There were some stretches of THE HANGOVER that for me, upon later contemplation, didn't actually amuse me all that much.  (Pretty much 100% of the scenes featuring Mike Tyson.)  But other people sure loved them...so the party atmosphere in the theatre just kept on goin'!  Alone in my living room, I might just be tempted to fast-forward through those scenes.You probably know the basic setup.  Four guys head to Vegas for a Bachelor-Party weekend of tame debauchery.  The groom (Justin Bartha) is a nice fellow who likes the idea of having a nice time...but isn't exactly looking to get his freak on.  The co-pilots of the whole venture are his old friends Bradley Cooper (married, and resentful to be ""tied down"") and Ed  Helms (uptight and in an unhealthy relationship of his own).  And things might have gone okay if these three buddies hadn't been obliged to bring along Bartha's soon-to-be Brother-in-Law (Zach Galifianakis)...a pudgy, bearded guy who is...well...socially inappropriate.  He's clingy, says weird things, is strangely uninformed about other things (""is this the real Caesar's Palace?"" he asks a desk clerk, totally serious and slightly awe-struck by the possibility) and has few personal boundaries.  The guys try, to varying degrees, to be nice to him...but it is an awkward fit.  He must sense this, because when the 4 of them sneak onto the roof of a hotel, he plies them with shots of Jaegermeister.Cut to the next morning.  Their hotel suite is destroyed (and occupied by live animals, including a Tiger), they have the worst hangovers ever, and NO recollection of how they wound up this way.  Galifianakis has no pants.  Helm has lost a tooth.  All three have managed to lose the groom!  The movie thus busies itself with their madcap quest to find the groom, which they can only do by slowly piecing together their crazy night.This is a very funny premise, and the film follows it quite solidly.  It's just a joy seeing all the weird things in their room.  A tiger?!?!  When they finally stumble downstairs and give their valet parking ticket to a driver...he shows up with a police car and says ""here's your car, officers.""  How the HECK did THAT happen?!?!It's a crazy ride, and a very R-rated one.  Leave the kids and the inhibitions at home, and you'll have a grand time.  It's adult silliness at nearly its finest.I'm not a big Bradley Cooper fan.  I find him to be too smarmy and slightly ""stalkerish"" to warm up to.  He doesn't change my mind here...especially with his vitriolic rants about marriage...but the part suits him and I did laugh at his childishness.  Bartha is not well known to me (and he's only there for some of the film), but I kinda liked this guys easy, goofy charm.  Ed Helm is a revelation.  As Andy on ""The Office,"" I took a while to warm up to him, and now he's a real favorite.  In THE HANGOVER,  he's doing a version of Andy, but it's still funny as heck, and often quite touching.  And Galifianakis is just insane...he, too, brings a touching hint of humanity...but mostly he's the unhinged and slightly dangerous stranger in the mix.  It's the kind of comedic performance that makes funny people into stars.  (Think about how Steve Carrell, in 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, suddenly exploded into super-stardom...Galifianakis COULD enjoy that kind of success.)There's plenty to laugh at in this rude, crude romp.  It's a simple, easy to explain premise that is executed with precision by cast & crew alike.

Trouble is, I laughed maybe once or twice, and like the basically unsympathetic heroes here, I don't remember what exactly I laughed at on the morning after...I know it wasn't the lame ""outrageous"" gay Asian mobster character, and it definitely wasn't Mike Tyson (has there been anything remotely humorous about this man?), and it sure wasn't (ho ho, no wait for this one) the *tiger* in the *bathroom* (yep, a tiger!! ha ha - in the BATHROOM! ha ha).  Ed Helms has his moments, though his character isn't nearly as amusing as his nebbishy Andy on TV's The Office. Bradley Cooper is quite easy on the eyes, but his character was pretty repulsive (particularly in his sanctimony near the end when his young son is in the presence of the evil bitch woman who dares to cuss in front of the child - his appalled reaction does not jibe well with the same guy who earlier loudly  calls his friend Dr. Fa***t in public). The bridegroom is merely a cipher. As for Zach Galifianakis, his weirdo-spazmo seems ultimately to be a love it or hate it characterization, with me leaning more towards the middle. I respect what he did with his performance  - it's certainly an original, its-own-thing creation. Stupid frat boy humor is forgivable if it's funny - for example, I thought both Pineapple Express and the first half of Zombieland, two recent we're-just-guys movies, were mostly hilarious.

1239935,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001UV4XEM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[18, 26]","The Hangover (Todd Phillips, 2009)I was absolutely stunned by Todd Phillips' directorial debut, Hated. In the realm of musical biographies, it ranks right up there with... okay, I can't think of any other musical biography I like as much. And the unedited footage included on the DVD is some of the most powerful I've ever seen. I was absolutely champing at the bit throughout the late nineties for Todd Phillips' next movie. And then, he fell off some sort of cliff, churning out unwatchable comedy after unwatchable comedy. I mean, when you're making Tom Green movies that early in your career, something is horribly, horribly wrong. But I never lost faith that somewhere in him, Todd Phillips had one more great movie. And fifteen years after Hated, he has gifted us with The Hangover. I can't remember the last American comedy that made me laugh this much.Plot: four guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party. There's Doug, the soon-to-be groom (Failure ot Launch's Justin Bartha); Alan, the bride's brother, who's somewhat crazy (Zach Galifianakis, who, ironically, showed up in What Happens in Vegas last year); Phil, Doug's longtime best friend (The Midnight Meat Train's Bradley Cooper); and Stu, a college pal of Doug and Phil's whose main quality is that he's painfully henpecked (Ed Helms, recently of Meet Dave). Stu's so bad off he actually lies to his girlfriend and tells her they're going to Napa Valley. (This is important later--not in the movie, in this review.) All is going well until the four of them share a shot on the roof of Caesar's Palace before going out for a night on the town. Then we fade into the next morning. There's a tiger in the bathroom, their suite is wrecked, there's a baby in the closet, Stu is missing a tooth, Phil is wearing a hospital bracelet, there's a chicken wandering around (note: unlike everything else, the chicken is never explained), and most importantly, Doug is missing. The remaining three, none of whom remember anything about the night, have to piece together every clue they've got, chase down leads, and figure out what happened to Doug in time to get him back home for his wedding. Which turns this from a stupid screwball comedy (though it never loses that aspect) into a lighthearted mystery film. And there hasn't been one this fun in years.The Hangover is the movie that so many others wanted to be and failed--most notably Sideways. The big problem with Sideways was that none of the characters was in any way sympathetic, though at least a couple of them should have been. Here we have four moral vacuums with whom we almost instantly bond. Not only that, but oh, the minor characters in this movie are fabulous. Eddie the preacher. The wedding singer. (Adam Sandler dreams of being that funny.) Mike Tyson! (Playing himself.) Jade the stripper, featuring Heather Graham in a return to form that's the best thing she's done since From Hell. The always wonderful Jeffrey Tambor as the father of the bride. All wonderful, but all upstaged by Galifianakis. He's crude, he's inappropriate, but everything that comes out of this guy's mouth is hysterical. I can't explain it, because most of it shouldn't be, but this is a man who can say ""I'm not allowed to be within two hundred feet of a school. ...or a Chuck E. Cheese."", and it's gut-bustingly funny. It's not just comic timing, though Galifianakis takes a cast full of comic actors with more experience than he has and shows them all up; there's just something inherently funny about the guy. (Maybe, as Mr. Chow says--and Mr. Chow's first appearance in this film is one of the scenes you will never, ever forget--""it's funny because he's a fat man."" I don't know, it didn't work for Chris Farley, but this guy? Comic gold.)But it's not just the actors. Everything about this film is dead on, including the things that by rights shouldn't be. The soundtrack is the most jumbled mess of stuff that shouldn't go together ever assembled, including some of the worst contemporary tracks to have found a home on the radio as well as some remakes that never should have seen the light of day, but somehow it all fits together here (for some reason, it reminded me of the soundtrack of the similarly-themed Very Bad Things, though I liked this even better than I did that). The camerawork is almost stock, nothing you won't see outside your random CSI episode, but it's awesome. And because I haven't found a place to say it and really really want to, yes, you're damned right it's better than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. By a country mile.In both opening weekend and total gross, The Hangover has deservedly smoked the twenty-five-year-old record set by Beverly Hills Cop in the R-rated comedy slot. It's already cemented its place in the record books; after all, let's face it, really good R-rated comedies come along, well, seemingly once every quarter-century. And to be sure, The Hangover is one for which you should leave the kiddies at home, but it's worth the extra you'll pay the babysitter. Welcome back, Mr. Phillips.

Everyone has said a lot but seeing Vegas through the joy of Blu Ray was a real treat. The endless onslaught of surprises wasn't at all tiring but I suppose my favorite subplot would have to be the entire Mike Tyson story: from the sudden appearance in their hotel room to the song Ed Helms sings on the grand piano (freakin' hilarious!) to the replaying of the security video of the night the ""deed"" happened. It was all superb. The express tux delivery on the highway was a touching guy moment that I can't explain.Some folks have complained that the women in Todd Phillips movies are either whores or shrews. That may be true. But that's because it is a GUY MOVIE.

1239943,A1RA1035L09OA1,B001UV4XEM,Ryno,"[6, 13]","Let me first start by saying Zach Galifianakis is the best (and the only) funny thing about ""The Hangover"". He finally gets his due after years of underrated movies (i.e. ""Out Cold""), hilarious online video skits (i.e. ""Between Two Ferns""), and Comedy Central specials. If it wasn't for Zach G., I would have absolutely hated this movie and would have given it 1 star.So why my utter disappointment in this movie? It's a tale of two halves. The first half is where Zach's tried and true character/persona of acting dumber than dirt, shines the most. Yes, he plays this same persona in his comedy act and any movie he's ever been in, but he absolutely kills it and is hilarious. It never gets old. The beginning part of the movie shows a lot of promise to be a comedy classic.Unfortunately, after their infamous drink on the rooftop that transitions their saga to the next morning, the second half of the movie completely falls flat. I really can't remember laughing once. Tiger in the bathroom? Awkward Mike Tyson appearance? Clich&eacute; Vegas wedding no one remembers? I understand they're going for cheap laughs with this uninspired circumstantial humor, but it just doesn't get the laughs from me. I'm all about stupid humor (like what Zach G., Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey, etc. are so famous for), however it must be witty. Any writer hack can throw in a random circumstance out of left field... it simply doesn't take any creativity.So on to why this movie really falls flat. ""The Hangover"" plot comes straight from the script pages of ""Dude Where's My Car"". Shocked? Perplexed? In denial? Google the movie titles together and you'll see a College Humor video that does a quick side-by-side comparison of the two (I'd post a link myself but it would get deleted by Amazon). I understand this movie came out several years ago with comedy lightweights Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott. And I understand the humor is extremely sophomoric (which is also the case in The Hangover). I also understand that movies/books/comedians/artists steal material from each other all of the time. But the humor on ""Dude Where's My Car"" was better executed than in the 2nd half of ""The Hangover"" (which isn't saying much). It probably also helped that the prior film trail-blazed the concept/formula before the subsequent rip-off by ""The Hangover"", causing it to be really watered-down for me. If you or most other people would have seen ""Dude"" before they saw ""Hangover"", you'd have the same feeling of being cheated after all of the insane hype I had heard.Given the choice, I'd have the first half of the ""Hangover"" and the second half of ""Dude Where's My Car"" meshed into one hilarious movie. I rate ""Hangover"" 2.5 stars. I can only rate whole stars, but I figure I'd go with the 2 since this movie is already overrated on Amazon. It's a tough thing to be a dissenter of such an over-hyped comedy movie (I'm prepared to get a lot of ""Unhelpful"" check marks on here from die-hards), but I want to let you know that I really tried to like this movie. This kind of movie is right in my wheelhouse. It just wasn't original enough or funny enough.

Thanks to Judd Apatow's smashing successes, the litany of comedies focusing on the trials and tribulations of young men teetering on the brink of manhood (even those well into their 30s) is impressive - ""Knocked Up,"" ""40-Year Old Virgin,"" ""Wedding Crashers,"" ""Superbad,"" ""Pineapple Express,"" and on and on.Smashing through the pack is Todd Philips' ""The Hangover.""  There may not be a more classic setup for a buddy flick - a bachelor party in Vegas gone horribly wrong.  But I cannot think of a recent film that has taken a more stodgy premise and injected such brilliant and unexpected hilarity into the mix.We know from the first scene that things have gone wrong:  a bleeding guy stands in the middle of the desert, calmly explaining to a nervous bride-to-be that he's lost her fiance and the wedding ain't gonna happen.  We think, sure - we've seen this before.No we haven't.Cut to the guys getting ready to hit Vegas.  The fiance, Doug (Justin Bartha (""National Treasure"") is a pretty good guy.  His two best friends are Stu (Ed Helms, ""The Office"") and Phil (Bradley Cooper, ""Wedding Crashers"").  Stu is a hen-pecked guy who's lied to his controlling girlfriend - she honestly thinks he's taking Doug to a bachelor party in Napa (serves her right).  Phil is a teacher frustrated by his job and his marriage and is just dying for a night of depravity.But there is a fourth guy along for the ride - Alan (Zach Galifianakis), the soon-to-be brother-in-law.  In a lesser movie, Alan would quite simply steal the whole shooting match.  Galifianakis combines the zaniness of John Belushi with the untrammelled sweet innocence of Michael Cera.  Alan is not quite right - starved for friendship, socially maladroit, and fanatically loyal.  The first sign of trouble comes when the guys agree to take shots from Alan's booze on top of a Vegas hotel/casino.The brilliance of the movie comes from the next scene - the guys wake up in a completely trashed hotel suite.  But there are signs of a true blowout - broken tables, a burning sofa, a baby in the closet and a tiger in the bathroom.  And a missing fiance.The rest of the movie involves Stu, Phil and Alan trying to track down Doug in Vegas even though nobody can remember a single thing from the night before.  The twists and turns involve Vegas crime lords, a sweet prostitute (Heather Graham), and Mike Freaking Tyson.This movie is hilarious from start to finish.  Fast moving, perfectly cast, and always unexpected, ""The Hangover"" benefits from perfect comic performances from the entire cast.  It's not a surprise to see either Ed Helms or Bradley Cooper in a hilarious movie, but to see Galifianakis graduate from ""Out Cold"" and various ""Reno 911"" episodes to the comic big time is a pure pleasure.Get this movie!",5,An unexpected comic masterpiece,1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,2899,"['current', 'film', 'market', 'guy', 'picture', 'films', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'are', 'two', 'hottest', 'sub-genres', 'comedy', 'there', 'Thanks', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'smashing', 'successes', 'litany', 'comedies', 'focusing', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'young', 'men', 'teetering', 'brink', 'manhood', 'even', 'well', '30s', 'impressive', 'Knocked', 'Up', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Superbad', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'on.Smashing', 'pack', 'Todd', 'Philips', 'Hangover', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'classic', 'setup', 'buddy', 'flick', 'bachelor', 'party', 'Vegas', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'recent', 'film', 'taken', 'more', 'stodgy', 'premise', 'injected', 'such', 'brilliant', 'unexpected', 'hilarity', 'mix.We', 'know', 'first', 'scene', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'wrong', 'bleeding', 'guy', 'middle', 'desert', 'calmly', 'explaining', 'nervous', 'bride-to-be', 'lost', 'fiance', 'wedding', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'happen', 'think', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.No', ""haven't.Cut"", 'guys', 'getting', 'ready', 'hit', 'Vegas', 'fiance', 'Doug', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'National', 'Treasure', 'pretty', 'good', 'guy', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'Stu', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Office', 'Phil', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Stu', 'hen-pecked', 'guy', 'who', 'lied', 'controlling', 'girlfriend', 'honestly', 'taking', 'Doug', 'bachelor', 'party', 'Napa', 'right', 'Phil', 'teacher', 'frustrated', 'job', 'marriage', 'just', 'dying', 'night', 'depravity.But', 'fourth', 'guy', 'ride', 'Alan', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'soon-to-be', 'brother-in-law', 'lesser', 'movie', 'Alan', 'would', 'quite', 'simply', 'steal', 'whole', 'shooting', 'match', 'Galifianakis', 'zaniness', 'John', 'Belushi', 'untrammelled', 'sweet', 'innocence', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Alan', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'starved', 'friendship', 'socially', 'maladroit', 'fanatically', 'loyal', 'first', 'sign', 'trouble', 'when', 'guys', 'agree', 'take', 'shots', 'Alan', 'booze', 'top', 'Vegas', 'hotel/casino.The', 'brilliance', 'movie', 'next', 'scene', 'guys', 'wake', 'up', 'completely', 'trashed', 'hotel', 'suite', 'are', 'signs', 'true', 'blowout', 'broken', 'tables', 'burning', 'sofa', 'baby', 'closet', 'tiger', 'bathroom', 'missing', 'fiance.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'Stu', 'Phil', 'Alan', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'Doug', 'Vegas', 'even', 'nobody', 'can', 'remember', 'single', 'thing', 'night', 'twists', 'turns', 'involve', 'Vegas', 'crime', 'lords', 'sweet', 'prostitute', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Mike', 'Freaking', 'Tyson.This', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'start', 'finish', 'Fast', 'moving', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'always', 'unexpected', 'Hangover', 'benefits', 'perfect', 'comic', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'not', 'surprise', 'see', 'either', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'see', 'Galifianakis', 'graduate', 'Out', 'Cold', 'various', 'Reno', '911', 'episodes', 'comic', 'big', 'time', 'pure', 'pleasure.Get', 'movie']",The Hangover - UNRATED

""Little Nose""","[3, 4]","I was skeptic about seeing this film because I was worried it was going to be too cheesy and very corny for a comedy but man was I wrong. I found ""The Hangover"" to be very original and without of a doubt one of the best and funniest movies I've seen in a long while. ""The Hangover"" stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, & Zach Galifianakis (who I think absolutley stole the show with his very humorous acting throughout the whole movie).While visiting in Vegas for a bachlor party, three groomsmen (Cooper, Helms, Galifianakis) accidently loses their other friend and groom (Justin Bartha) after a night of out of control, mindless, care free, all night long partying. The morning they wake up from the night before (having no clue what on Earth happened), they discover their friend Doug (Bartha) is missing. Therefore, Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms), & Alan (Galifianakis) enters a race against time to find Doug in time for the wedding. During their search for Doug, the guys, little by little, discover all the things that happened the night they lost their friend that includes finding a baby, stealing a cop car, Stu marrying a stripper, stealing a tiger from Mike Tyson, being drugged, and having a little bit of a mix up with a small, naked, Asian guy. All of these parts are projected in a very humorous and hilarious way that will make you laugh every time.Once the guys finally sort out all the mess they encountered the night they lost Doug, they soon remember what they did with him and they do indeed find Doug and are able to make it in time for the wedding in the end.Overall, ""The Hangover"" is a great comedy and is definitely a must see in my book.

Because I expected one of the best comedies ever based on all of the reviews that I had read. What I got what a really good comedy...not great...but really good.The Hangover has plenty of laugh out loud and ""oh-my-God"" moments. I'm a true sucker for slapstick and The Hangover has its fair share of that too. The story is just silly--deliberately so--with 4 guys ""accidentally"" taking a date rape drug combined with mucho alcohol, and instead of the 4 of 'em falling flat on their faces immediately, they basically sleepwalk into some unbelievable, but hilarious escapades that none of them remember in the morning...including losing one of their buddies.So the next day, the ""unlost boys"" spend their time backtracking to find the lost boy only to discover the zany stuff that they had been into the night before with mostly hilarious results. The acting is great by a bunch of guys that I really didn't recognize prior to seeing this movie, and I'd still need to check the credits today to tell you a single one of their names. Jeffery Tambor makes an appearance as does Heather Graham, but their small parts are far overshadowed by the three guys looking for their buddy.There are some very memorable moments in this movie that almost had me giving it 4 stars instead of three. But then I thought about the company of 4 star movies that I'd be putting The Hangover into and it just didn't compute. So by all means, see The Hangover. It's funny!

1239961,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B001UV4XEM,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","`The Hangover' is a goofy comedy about a stag night in Las Vegas that goes horribly wrong when the stags wake up in the morning with a tiger in the bathroom (!), absolutely no recollection of the night before and a missing groom. The film quickly descends into frantic farce as they try to retrace their steps and find the lost groom before it is too late. The actor who plays Andy (Zach Galifianakis) is particularly good and makes this film a whole lot funnier and the other actors manage to keep things speeding along whilst raising laughs at regular intervals. This has a real `old school' vibe about it and reminded me of various comedies from the 80's and if you enjoyed the off-the-wall comedies from that era then this will be right up your street. There are plenty of cliches and obvious jokes but they are delivered so well you can't help but laugh despite yourself. You even get a cameo appearance from Mike Tyson who is pretty funny as well. The various elements the stags have to track down and uncover to find the groom keep the story interesting and make you want to keep watching to find out how various things occurred and how they lead to the groom; like a funny detective story. This is a film that doesn't try to take itself too seriously and sets out to deliver some laughs by the time the film ends and whilst it isn't ground shaking or the best comedy I have ever seen, it does achieve it's goal and had me chuckling at points throughout.

1239964,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B001UV4XEM,S. Schell,"[16, 24]","I'll admit it - I felt victim to hype when seeking out this movie.  I paid heed to all the positive reviews it got and trusted friends and family of mine that described it as ""hilarious"", one going so far as to say that he couldn't remember the last time he'd laughed that hard watching a movie.  Based on all this positive reception, I expected to be doubled over and trying to catch my breath while watching ""The Hangover"" but I found myself chuckling only moderately and feeling a little letdown once the end credits rolled.  The movie will tickle some funny bones more than others but on a personal laugh scale of 1 to 5, I only rate it a 3 and I have to assume it is because I am not a bachelorette, party girl or Vegas enthusiast, and I have no interest of ever visiting the place.The movie centers around a young affianced guy named Doug (Bartha) and his three groomsmen that take a trip to Vegas for one wild night a few days before his impending nuptials.  Phil (Cooper), a married teacher with a son, Stu (Helms), a dentist, Alan (Galifianakis), Doug's dim-witted brother-in-law-to-be and the groom himself all book an expensive villa at Caesar's Palace and toast one another on the roof of the building before descending the stairs again for partying and debauchery.  When they wake up the next morning, the posh villa has been demolished - an armchair smolders in the main sitting area, food and drink are all over the place, a clucking chicken roams the halls and a tiger (yes, you read that right - a TIGER) has taken residence in the bathroom.  Waking up on the floor severely dazed and assessing the celebratory carnage around them, they notice Doug is missing from their small band and they immediately embark on a search for him, desperate to make it to LA for the wedding before it's too late.The rest of the movie is a puckish step-by-step of how all the mayhem transpired.  Along with the mysteries of the animals roaming the villa are Stu's missing tooth, Phil's hospital bracelet, a mattress on the roof of Caesar's Palace and a stolen cop car, not to mention everyone's curious amnesia.  When a date rape drug called rohypnol (aka ""roofies"") is found to be the culprit for their short-term memory loss, they exhaust every little lead they can to locate Doug, becoming impromptu detectives in the process, and wind up in much bigger predicaments than they all thought possible.  The film depends on these outlandish quandaries for its laughs and pulls out all the stops for a zany Vegas adventure, some of which include a quickie marriage to a stripper, a run-in with ""Iron Mike"" Tyson and a hostage situation in the desert.  The script (derived from a real life Vegas bender) relies on moderate amounts of profanity, sexual humor, nudity (I personally could've done without seeing Galifianakis's hairy, cellulite-ridden posterior), drugs/alcohol and the general lore of Sin City for its laughs.  It certainly doesn't help that it comes from screenwriters who are fairly young in their careers.  The end result is that it doesn't break any new ground in the comedy genre, despite its critical and box office success (it's grossed more than $277 million in the US and Canada as of December 2009).Helms (of ""The Office"" fame as Andy Bernard) plays the sensible guy of the bunch who acquiesces to his cold, stiff harpy of a girlfriend because he's too nice for his own good (you can hardly wait for her to get a comeuppance of some sort).  Cooper is the guy with a devil-may-care streak who is dissatisfied with the mediocrity of his life and Galifianakis is a big-hearted oddball who is just trying to belong.  Bartha doesn't get to stretch his legs much as Doug because of his absence from over half the film, his character just a conduit for the plot.  Heather Graham as a smokin' hot but kindly stripper named Jade comes off as a real sweetheart just looking for a connection with an honest man.Bottom line: Despite becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of 2009 so far and snagging a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, I'm overall not impressed with ""The Hangover"" and am glad I did not buy it before watching it.

And after this summer's major disappointments and sequels or remakes like Star Trek, Harry Potter 6, Terminator, etc., Todd Phillips delivered big with this one.  It was nice to watch a movie in the theaters that wasn't just a rehash nor an artsy picture.  Phillips directed the classics ""Road Trip"" and ""Old School"", and turned in acceptable films with ""Starsky and Hutch"" and ""School for Scoundrels"".  However, ""The Hangover"" is his masterpiece.  And to testify about how good it was, the film is the biggest rated R comedy of all time and this without big name stars.  The story is about a group of friends who can't remember their ""unforgettable"" bachelor party in Las Vegas.  And to top it all off they have lost the groom.  So the three remaining friends must retrace their steps from the night before, only to suffer misadventure after misadventure.  Watch for Mike Tyson's brilliant cameo in the film.  Ed Helms from ""The Office"" and ""The Daily Show"" turns in the best performance with a song about the missing groom and his own missing tooth.  And make sure you watch the ending credits.  The pictures from the bachelor party are the funniest part of the film, which is scary considering the whole movie long I could barely catch my breath, I was laughing so hard.  Warning!  This film does contain a lot of language and other offensive material.  But if you can handle it, you should watch it.

1239971,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B001UV4XEM,Steve,"[4, 6]","The Hangover is funny but predictable and therefore is not a comedy classic (as so many fawningly throw out in their snippet reviews) unless your parameters are very narrow. The Hangover would easily offend a large majority of people (which I'm totally fine with, since the easily offended are often the biggest hypocrites) and it is as age intended as the Twilight series. Just as there are forty-something moms swooning over the teen romance in that mawkish series, there will be older guys guffawing and high-fiving their fave moments from this innocuous flick. But the target audiences for both are teens and twenty-somethings whose average cinematic experiences compel them to coin the utterly useless word ""classic"" and apply it to this movie. Compounding the problem is the excess hype that started nearly at the premiere. It just goes to show you how powerful media saturation can be.In short, if you can imagine the highlights of the last five to ten years of movies from Will Ferrell, Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Ben Stiller, et al, you can pretty much predict where the laughs will come from.Endorsing the Vegas theme to the extreme, The Hangover is all about a wild weekend with no consequences.

The desert shots were done adequately so there was no light saturation or blur - overall the presentation in both versions makes them a good investment for being one of the few comedies you might buy on Blu. The unrated runs eight minutes longer and contained nothing that would warrant the usual attraction for being titled as such. By the time they get to the roof to start the night there were four brief sequences added in, including some extra dialogue in the opening house scene, a little more with that abusive girlfriend and a fun spot in the hotel room. The main difference between the two would be a funny one minute scene as they take the tiger back to Tyson's house (elevator addition). Otherwise, there are no R rated additions like some would look for.The supplements are a mixed bag, and after investing the hour it takes to get through them all (except the commentary) none of them stand out as a must see.Standard Special Features (2 Disc DVD and BD)* The missing pictures. 100 added photos from the camera, a few funny ones but they felt like the pics you would screen out before you share with your buddies (10 shots from the same angle, where you get rid of the other 9 and save the best one - they keep the other 9 here).* Map of Destruction. Has 15 spots they filmed on a selectable icon map that takes you to a brief clip regarding making-of info. The Tyson one was the most interesting for me as the others are all either too short or not interesting.* Madness of Ken Jeong. This guy doesn't work for me other than brief shots in a film so his ""improv"" here wasn't funny.* Action Mash-Up. A brief Stooges style mix, forgettable.* Three Best Friends Song. Funny in a movie, not funny as a long version when they can't sing.* The Dan Band. The clean version of the Fame song.* Gag Reel. Now this was funny, only goes a few minutes but they were having fun.BD Exclusive: (BD Live)* Cursing Mash-Up. My player took a few seconds to download/stream it and it only lasted a few seconds, most customers get a chuckle out of it when I screen it in the store, but just ok as a supplement.* Iron Mike Online Teaser. A decent rendition of him singing the In The Air Tonight. That played well and customers thought it a much better trailer than the standard ones we have seen 100 times.Theatrical BD Version:* PiP Commentary with Phillips and the three main guys. I usually love commentaries but this one stunk. I was expecting a great deal of humor, funny stories and cool info, but instead they were just sitting there looking bored, especially Cooper, I honestly think he was there to watch the film. Galifianakis sat there until minute 16 before he really said anything. Every once in awhile Todd would say something interesting about the film making, but don't watch this if you want the laughs.A fun movie with plenty of laughs on a good Blu that for some of the low prices I have seen here and elsewhere it will feel like a good investment.",5,"Hilarious film, a good overall Blu",1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,3213,"['finally', 'got', 'see', 'film', 'Blu', 'gave', 'nice', 'first', 'viewing', 'even', 'doing', 'rated/unrated', 'back', 'back', 'still', 'kept', 'laughing.The', 'Blu', 'clarity', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'solid', 'were', 'failings', 'even', 'volume', 'night', 'sequences', 'desert', 'shots', 'were', 'done', 'adequately', 'was', 'light', 'saturation', 'blur', 'overall', 'presentation', 'versions', 'good', 'investment', 'being', 'one', 'few', 'comedies', 'might', 'buy', 'Blu', 'unrated', 'runs', 'eight', 'minutes', 'longer', 'contained', 'nothing', 'would', 'warrant', 'usual', 'attraction', 'being', 'titled', 'such', 'time', 'get', 'roof', 'start', 'night', 'were', 'four', 'brief', 'sequences', 'added', 'including', 'extra', 'dialogue', 'opening', 'house', 'scene', 'little', 'more', 'abusive', 'girlfriend', 'fun', 'spot', 'hotel', 'room', 'main', 'difference', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'one', 'minute', 'scene', 'take', 'tiger', 'back', 'Tyson', 'house', 'elevator', 'addition', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'R', 'rated', 'additions', 'would', 'look', 'for.The', 'supplements', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'investing', 'hour', 'get', 'commentary', 'none', 'stand', 'out', 'must', 'see.Standard', 'Special', 'Features', '2', 'Disc', 'DVD', 'BD', '*', 'missing', 'pictures', '100', 'added', 'photos', 'camera', 'few', 'funny', 'ones', 'felt', 'pics', 'would', 'screen', 'out', 'share', 'buddies', '10', 'shots', 'same', 'angle', 'where', 'get', 'rid', 'other', '9', 'save', 'best', 'one', 'keep', 'other', '9', 'here', '*', 'Map', 'Destruction', '15', 'spots', 'filmed', 'selectable', 'icon', 'map', 'brief', 'clip', 'regarding', 'making-of', 'info', 'Tyson', 'one', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'others', 'are', 'either', 'too', 'short', 'not', 'interesting', '*', 'Madness', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'guy', ""n't"", 'work', 'other', 'brief', 'shots', 'film', 'improv', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', '*', 'Action', 'Mash-Up', 'brief', 'Stooges', 'style', 'mix', 'forgettable', '*', 'Three', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Song', 'Funny', 'movie', 'not', 'funny', 'long', 'version', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', '*', 'Dan', 'Band', 'clean', 'version', 'Fame', 'song', '*', 'Gag', 'Reel', 'Now', 'was', 'funny', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'were', 'having', 'fun.BD', 'Exclusive', 'BD', 'Live', '*', 'Cursing', 'Mash-Up', 'My', 'player', 'took', 'few', 'seconds', 'download/stream', 'only', 'lasted', 'few', 'seconds', 'most', 'customers', 'get', 'chuckle', 'when', 'screen', 'store', 'just', 'ok', 'supplement', 'Iron', 'Mike', 'Online', 'Teaser', 'decent', 'rendition', 'singing', 'Air', 'Tonight', 'played', 'well', 'customers', 'thought', 'much', 'better', 'trailer', 'standard', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', '100', 'times.Theatrical', 'BD', 'Version', '*', 'PiP', 'Commentary', 'Phillips', 'three', 'main', 'guys', 'usually', 'love', 'commentaries', 'one', 'stunk', 'was', 'expecting', 'great', 'deal', 'humor', 'funny', 'stories', 'cool', 'info', 'instead', 'were', 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'looking', 'bored', 'especially', 'Cooper', 'honestly', 'think', 'was', 'there', 'watch', 'film', 'Galifianakis', 'sat', 'minute', '16', 'really', 'said', 'anything', 'once', 'awhile', 'Todd', 'would', 'say', 'something', 'interesting', 'film', 'making', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'want', 'laughs.A', 'fun', 'movie', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'good', 'Blu', 'low', 'prices', 'have', 'seen', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'will', 'feel', 'good', 'investment']",The Hangover - UNRATED
1239973,A1RV5KO737VP2T,B001UV4XEM,Steven Jones,"[2, 6]","If you are in the right mood and frame of mind for mindless fart joke-type humor then you will probably laugh hysterically for most of this movie. Most people did.There are a few scenes that a large number of people agreed were shocking, disturbing and EXTREMELY offensive so I'll warn you about them:There is a scene involving a baby and masturbation that will make many parents very angry.There is a scene involving a man being sexually tortured by a little girl with a Taser while a cop (the filmmaker himself) stands by telling her she did a good job because she shot him ""right in the balls"" with the Taser which fries his testicles with 50,000 volts. Anyone who knows anything about the Taser and how the police and others are actually using it will find this 'gag' way too realistic and cruel to be funny. This sexual torture by Taser is really happening in the United States, minus the little girl, and it isn't a joke. But it is making a lot of lawyers rich while sending a lot of non-violent, unarmed men to the hospital with severe damage to their genitals for very little reason  (Google ""Tavares Browning Taser"" for a real life example. If you just want to see a video example of how the Taser shoots the testicles even when the police aren't trying to then Google ""Taser balls Rescue Humor"" and click the very first link ""Police take a taser to balls"")You can also find the Taser torture scene on YouTube. If this scene doesn't bother you then you're pretty cold blooded, but the rest of the film will probably be fine with you.Immediately after the girl sexually tortures one of the three friends' with the Taser, leaving him crying on the floor in castrated agony, a boy takes the Taser and shoots another of the three friends in the face with it. When the Taser victim doesn't fall down, the cop shocks him in the neck with a regular stun gun while making a casual remark, dropping him to the floor in a helpless heap of pain. Some people objected to this abuse, too, but since the police aren't actually shooting people in the face with Tasers it didn't receive as much criticism. Generally Taser shots to the face result in a lost eye, just as Taser shots to the genitals often result in destroyed genitals and severe emotional trauma.If you can get past the baby masturbation scene and the Taser sexual torture scene then for the most part you can laugh your ass off at the rest of the movie.

They manage to lose one of their own ( and probably their wives and girlfriends too, later on - we never know for sure, but we are treated to some odd expressions from the women when they do make interim contact with them).  They spend most of their after-the-fact  sober time trying to find out where they lost the buddy, getting married in Vegas Chapels without meaning to, sorting out various mysteries that they can't remember but are dealing with the punch lines; and unleashing the wrath of an Oriental goon who is not only too hot to handle, but smarter than they are too.  One thing we know for sure though, is that the ""pretty boy"" among them is looking pretty hard-core masculine at the end of the road show - through his sunburn, cracked lips and sans the carefully tended head of hair as he wanders around the side of the road in the desert making his desperation phone call home......I did eventually come to understand how the tiger ended up in their bathroom, but I never did figure out where they got the chicken.",4,"The Tiger, The Chicken, and the Goon",1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,1392,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'Chick', 'Flick', 'guy', 'movie', 'guess', 'recommended', 'evil', 'brother', 'hoot', 'anyway', 'own', 'sense', 'humor', 'can', 'handle', 'anything', 'roaring', 'it.In', 'nutshell', 'guys', 'descend', 'Vegas', 'bachelor', 'run', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'hangover', 'lot', 'other', 'strange', 'stuff', 'had', ""n't"", 'counted', 'boot', 'manage', 'lose', 'one', 'own', 'probably', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'too', 'later', 'never', 'know', 'sure', 'are', 'treated', 'odd', 'expressions', 'women', 'when', 'do', 'make', 'interim', 'contact', 'spend', 'most', 'after-the-fact', 'sober', 'time', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'lost', 'buddy', 'getting', 'married', 'Vegas', 'Chapels', 'meaning', 'sorting', 'out', 'various', 'mysteries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'are', 'dealing', 'punch', 'lines', 'unleashing', 'wrath', 'Oriental', 'goon', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'too', 'hot', 'handle', 'smarter', 'are', 'too', 'One', 'thing', 'know', 'sure', 'pretty', 'boy', 'looking', 'pretty', 'hard-core', 'masculine', 'end', 'road', 'show', 'sunburn', 'cracked', 'lips', 'carefully', 'tended', 'head', 'hair', 'side', 'road', 'desert', 'making', 'desperation', 'phone', 'call', 'home', 'did', 'eventually', 'come', 'understand', 'how', 'tiger', 'ended', 'up', 'bathroom', 'never', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'got', 'chicken']",The Hangover - UNRATED

1239980,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001UV4XEM,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[3, 14]","Continuing the ""Old School"" tradition of adult comedies with immature humor, The Hangover succeeds with a promising premise and several inspired performances from its leads. While the plot's creativity does diminish at about the halfway mark and comparisons to lesser films of the genre become more apparent, the R-rated laughs and hilariously despicable misadventures of our gang of inebriated antiheroes maintains a consistent pairing of riotous vulgarities and comical camaraderie in desperation.Before Doug's (Justin Bartha) wedding, his best friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms), along with the groom's soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis), plan a wild bachelor party in Las Vegas. Upon awakening the next morning, Doug is missing and no one can seem to remember the events that transpired the night before. An abandoned baby, a missing tooth, a hospital tag, and a live tiger in the bathroom are just a few of the clues the hungover group of misfits must follow to find their friend and return home before the big day.The Hangover is off to a good start when the major players immediately express their mismatched personalities and generally dysfunctional problem-solving attitudes. Shaft and semen jokes within the first 10 minutes, an eye-flinching jockstrap flash and questionable social mindsets also add to the roseate chaos to come. Although the story isn't entirely original, the premise is a nearly perfect setup for a comedy, and it's fitting that the rating doesn't hinder the outrageous levels of grossly immature and chiefly adult humor. Too bad the title ""What Happens in Vegas"" was already taken by a softy romantic chick-flick.The film has a suitable mix of serious predicaments tied into the crude gags, brutal slapstick, the completely unexpected, hilariously coarse language and (no longer) limits-pushing nudity (unfortunately mostly male). This better balances the pacing of the film and grounds it in reality a little more convincingly, even though it appears to exaggerate out-of-control bachelor party scenarios - director Todd Phillips is convinced that there are real party stories out there that would make any element of The Hangover pale in comparison. With a barbarous stun gun demonstration, a stolen police car, a misplaced tiger, an unclaimed baby, Asian mobsters, Rain Man-gambling, and an unplanned marriage, the film is like Harold and Kumar on ecstasy and Saving Private Ryan in Vegas. It may not be the most groundbreaking comedy, but following the drunken leads' exploits in reverse is a formula for a great time.- The Massie Twins",3,The Hangover Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,2601,"['Continuing', 'Old', 'School', 'tradition', 'adult', 'comedies', 'immature', 'humor', 'Hangover', 'promising', 'premise', 'several', 'inspired', 'performances', 'leads', 'plot', 'creativity', 'diminish', 'halfway', 'mark', 'comparisons', 'lesser', 'films', 'genre', 'become', 'more', 'apparent', 'R-rated', 'laughs', 'hilariously', 'despicable', 'misadventures', 'gang', 'inebriated', 'antiheroes', 'consistent', 'pairing', 'riotous', 'vulgarities', 'comical', 'camaraderie', 'desperation.Before', 'Doug', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'wedding', 'best', 'friends', 'Phil', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Stu', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'groom', 'soon-to-be', 'brother-in-law', 'Alan', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'plan', 'wild', 'bachelor', 'party', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'awakening', 'next', 'morning', 'Doug', 'missing', 'one', 'can', 'seem', 'remember', 'events', 'transpired', 'night', 'before', 'abandoned', 'baby', 'missing', 'tooth', 'hospital', 'tag', 'live', 'tiger', 'bathroom', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'clues', 'hungover', 'group', 'misfits', 'must', 'follow', 'find', 'friend', 'return', 'home', 'big', 'day.The', 'Hangover', 'good', 'start', 'when', 'major', 'players', 'immediately', 'express', 'mismatched', 'personalities', 'generally', 'dysfunctional', 'problem-solving', 'attitudes', 'Shaft', 'semen', 'jokes', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'eye-flinching', 'jockstrap', 'flash', 'questionable', 'social', 'mindsets', 'also', 'add', 'roseate', 'chaos', 'come', 'story', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'original', 'premise', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'setup', 'comedy', 'fitting', 'rating', ""n't"", 'hinder', 'outrageous', 'levels', 'grossly', 'immature', 'chiefly', 'adult', 'humor', 'Too', 'bad', 'title', 'What', 'Vegas', 'was', 'already', 'taken', 'softy', 'romantic', 'chick-flick.The', 'film', 'suitable', 'mix', 'serious', 'predicaments', 'tied', 'crude', 'gags', 'brutal', 'slapstick', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'hilariously', 'coarse', 'language', 'no', 'longer', 'limits-pushing', 'nudity', 'unfortunately', 'mostly', 'male', 'better', 'pacing', 'film', 'reality', 'little', 'more', 'convincingly', 'even', 'exaggerate', 'out-of-control', 'bachelor', 'party', 'scenarios', 'director', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'convinced', 'are', 'real', 'party', 'stories', 'out', 'there', 'would', 'make', 'element', 'Hangover', 'pale', 'comparison', 'barbarous', 'stun', 'gun', 'demonstration', 'stolen', 'police', 'car', 'misplaced', 'tiger', 'unclaimed', 'baby', 'Asian', 'mobsters', 'Rain', 'Man-gambling', 'unplanned', 'marriage', 'film', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'ecstasy', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Vegas', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'groundbreaking', 'comedy', 'following', 'drunken', 'leads', 'exploits', 'reverse', 'formula', 'great', 'time.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",The Hangover - UNRATED

1239985,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001UV4XEM,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 2]","""The Hangover"", the new film from director Todd Phillips (""Old School"") is a very funny movie. Phillips seems to delight in creating stories for his characters to run amok in, to do wild and completely off-the wall things in, and as he pushes the boundaries with his characters, he creates a lot of laughs along the way for us to enjoy. ""The Hangover"" is also outrageous and not the least interested in being PC, both of which add to the comedy. But it isn't a perfect film.Doug (Justin Bartha) is about to get married and his two friends, Phil (Bradley Cooper, ""He's Just Not That Into You""), a school teacher at a prep school and Stu (Ed Helms, TV's ""The Office""), a dentist, want to take him out for a bachelor party. The logical choice is Las Vegas. Doug feels like he should invite his soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galafianakis), a strange man who resembles the Unabomber. Doug's future father-in-law (Jeffrey Tambor) gives them his vintage Mercedes Convertible on the condition only Doug drives it. He also seems to delight in the misadventures he believes the boys will soon partake in. As soon as they arrive, Phil talks them into upgrading to a villa and they head up to the roof of Caesar's Palace to take in the view and toast with a shot before the evening begins. The next morning, Phil, Stu and Alan wake up in the villa with terrible hangovers and can't find Doug. What they do find is a tiger, a chicken and a baby. They quickly determine Doug is missing and start to try to piece together the details of their evening which is a slow process given they can't remember a thing.Directed by Phillips and co-written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (the writing team behind ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" and ""Four Christmases"" YIKES!), ""The Hangover"" is a comedy that has actual moments of surprising comedy, unlike their last two films. You know, the type of moments that are so jarring, so out of left field and so funny you can't possibly see them coming. These are the types of moments that cause you to laugh so hard that you miss the next few jokes. ""The Hangover"" has moments like this, more than most comedies. And that alone makes it worth the price of admission.But to get to this point, the story has to keep us interested and involved. The brilliant thing about ""The Hangover"" is that we watch the boys arrive in Vegas and enter their suite. After they have a toast on the rooftop, the story jumps to the next morning. The camera slowly, almost lovingly, pans across the trashed villa revealing much extensive, almost subversive damage, all of which was obviously caused by a very wild night. One of the ottomans has been made into a swing, suspended from the ceiling by ropes made of expensive sheets. There is a huge sculpture made of empty beer bottles. And more. As the camera finds Stu and Allan, we watch as they wake up and start to process the carnage. Later, Phil wakes up and they begin to realize Doug is nowhere to be found. Because we don't actually watch the debauchery, our mind begins to paint more elaborate and wild images, given their hijinks a new level of humor. Also, it only seems right that we don't witness what the boys can't remember. This puts us on the same playing field and allows us to be surprised with the characters.When we get a full look at each of the guys, it quickly becomes apparent they were in over their heads during their night in Vegas. Really, how do three men create such damage in one hotel suite? It almost seems impossible. But as we begin to unravel their night together, everything quickly seems to come together.The rest of the film is spent trying to piece together what they did, in an effort to find their friend, Doug. A tiger, a chicken, a baby, Mike Tyson, an angry, effeminate Chinese drug lord and Heather Graham all figure into the story and when each one makes an appearance, the story just goes to a new and even more wild place. Some of these plot points don't work as well as others, but they all show the daring level of creativity the director and writers are willing to go to, the lengths they are willing to go to for a laugh.At one point, the three guys find a baby in the villa. Alan quickly decides to take charge of the baby, which is funny because he has, at this point, already proven he is probably the worst person to care for a baby. As they sit at breakfast, trying to determine their next move, Alan becomes bored and starts to play with the baby, capturing one of the most off the wall, funniest moments I have seen in a film in some time.Soon, they realize that Phil is wearing a hospital ID bracelet and this leads them to their first stop. There, they pick up more information leading them to the next, and so on.As they move from one stop to the next, the level of laughs fluctuates as well. The hospital sequence is ok, saved by one shocking, funny image; the wedding chapel sequence is just ok, and so on. When the comedy works, it is brilliant. When it doesn't, they still manage a few chuckles.Bradley Cooper, last seen in ""He's Just Not That Into You"", plays Phil, a teacher at a prep school who is not above conning his students out of the money he needs for the trip. He is also not above getting the group to commit to more and more, all in an effort to give Doug a great Bachelor Party. Phil is ready and willing to do all of this because he values his friendships and he wants to have a good time. Later, we learn that Phil has other levels to his character and he isn't just the hedonistic alpha male of the group.It is a nice performance from Cooper, but he basically plays the straight man, the guiding force to the tornado of crazy that is Stu and Phil. And that's OK, because the trouble these guys get in to is very funny.Ed Helms plays Stu, a dentist who keeps referring to himself as Dr. Price, to make himself seem very important. His fianc&eacute;e, Melissa (Rachael Harris) is a controlling woman and clearly doesn't like the idea of Stu going away for a weekend with the boys. And Stu realizes this, telling her they are going to Napa instead. Stu is henpecked and he isn't even married yet, a fact Phil knows all too well so a lot of the trip is spent chastising Stu for putting up with his current condition.Helms is usually funny and in ""The Hangover"" he displays the right levels of pent-up rage as he deals with all of the craziness going on around him, trying to keep it from Melissa's prying eyes.And he wakes up missing a tooth with only a clot of blood at the gum line. No one can remember what happened to it.Stand-up comic Zach Galafianakis plays Alan, Doug's future brother-in-law. Alan is a strange guy and it quickly becomes apparent that a lot of this strangeness is tolerated and pushed aside by his family, overlooked over the years, allowing him to remain a man-boy. Alan is the most off the wall character of the bunch, the most outlandish and often the funniest. But when you are dealing with extremes like this, the character also has moments that are just too strange, too off the wall, too over the top to work.Heather Graham plays Jade, a stripper who met the bachelor party the night before. Graham is very pretty, but she has never shown she can carry a film, drama or comedy, and now pops up in independent films and in small supporting roles. In ""The Hangover"", she plays a small piece of the puzzle and is OK. Her role isn't that demanding, so it doesn't require her to show a lot of acting ability, which is probably a good thing. But I think she is included to show that these three men actually just want normal lives. Her character sort of stops the comedy dead in it's tracks and the film quickly becomes pedestrian and boring. Jade is the worst of Hollywood stereotypes, the hooker with a heart of gold. As soon as this becomes apparent, you expect some twist, some outrageous behavior to catch you off guard. When this doesn't happen, you feel let down. Why didn't they take her character to a strange, different extreme?When ""The Hangover"" works, which is most of the time, it is easily one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time. When it doesn't, it sort of falls flat. The ending seems to drag because it becomes more like Heather Graham's character, predictable and pedestrian. There are a couple of other moments. But the laughter and comedy from the rest of the film helps to smooth over these slower points. And I really wish the ending weren't so clean. It needs to be outrageous, over the top, hilarious. Instead, it resembles a Sandra Bullock rom-com.""The Hangover"" is extremely funny and a very well deserved R-rated comedy. But even with the R-Rating, there are a couple of shocking moments and images that caught me off guard. The filmmakers were able to get these images into their film and still get an R-Rating? Bravo to Phillips and his producers.""The Hangover"" is one summer film you'll be happy to live with the next day. No hangover cure will be necessary.",4,One Comedy I'm Glad To Have Around The Day After...,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,8959,"['Hangover', 'new', 'film', 'director', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'Old',

1239992,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001UV4XEM,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","*** This review contains spoilers ***Before seeing 'The Hangover', I heard that it was about some guys who hold a bachelor party in Las Vegas. I was expecting a night of ribaldry, chronicling the bachelor party (along the lines of 'Superbad'--except with the characters being a bit older). But the great thing about 'The Hangover' is that all the action happens AFTER the bachelor party occurs, the next day. It's a tremendously clever idea where the comedy is in the unraveling of the mystery as to what happened to the protagonists during a bachelor party which they cannot recall.In the Act One setup, we're first introduced to the principals: Doug is about to be married and along with his brother-in-law, the off-the-wall Alan, joined by Doug's buddies, Stu, a dentist, and Phil, an elementary school teacher, decide to go to Las Vegas two days before the wedding for a surreptitious bachelor party. We then cut to five hours before the wedding, with Phil making a desperate call to Doug's fianc&eacute; informing her that they've lost Doug and it looks like the wedding is off. Then we flashback to the revelers' arrival at Caesar's Palace in Vegas, where they go up to the hotel roof where loose cannon Alan toasts Doug by cutting himself with a knife--he invites everyone to join in a little blood letting as a sort of initiation rite but the others turn him down as they all think Alan is a little bit off the wall.The break into Act Two occurs with Alan, Stu and Phil waking up in a trashed hotel room sans Doug. To make matters worse, there's a live tiger in the bathroom, a crying baby in the kitchen and Stu the Dentist is missing a tooth. They go downstairs and give the parking valet a stub, only to have him drive up with a police car, with the valet addressing the bumbling threesome as 'officers' and 'wishing them a good day'.Soon it becomes clear why Alan, Stu and Phil can't remember anything that happened the night before. Alan thought he was slipping a tab of ecstasy into their drinks but it turns out that it was Rohypnol (aka ""Roofies""), a date rape drug, which he bought from a confused drug dealer (also named Doug who later figures in the plot). I'm not sure if I recall the exact sequence of what happens next but basically the three end up at a wedding chapel where they discover that the night before Stu got hitched to a Vegas stripper. They locate her and fortunately she's the baby's mother. When the bumbling buddies return to their hotel room, waiting for them there is Mike Tyson himself along with one of his handler's. It seems that the boys stole Tyson's pet tiger and in a rather amusing scene, drug the tiger and drive it back to Big Mike's mansion. More outrageous obstacles soon are placed in the protagonists' way.It seems that the night before, Alan was playing craps with a Chinese gangster, Mr. Chow. He ends up taking off with Chow's gambling winnings amounting to $80,000. Chow and his thugs confront Alan, Stu and Phil and reveal that they are holding Doug and demand that they come up with his money or else they'll never see their buddy gain. In one of the few long-winded scenes in the film, Alan wins $80,000 by employing card counting techniques while playing blackjack back at the casino. They all drive out to the desert where they give Chow the money but he hands over a black guy named Doug who happens to be the drug dealer who sold Alan the 'roofies'.We're back at the point where the flashback began toward the beginning of the film. Phil is calling Doug's fianc&eacute; informing her that Doug cannot be located and the wedding is off. But suddenly Stu figures it all out. Earlier, the guys had noticed that Doug's mattress was impaled on the obelisk in front of the hotel. He realizes that Doug could not have thrown the mattress from the hotel windows since they don't open--the only conclusion is that they had brought Doug up to the roof the night before and he's been stuck up there since nightfall. All's well that ends well when the prospective groom and his three buddies drive back to Los Angeles just in time for the wedding (in a hilarious scene while they're driving on the highway, they have their tuxedos thrown to them from a tuxedo company van--obviously having ordered the tuxes beforehand from the car, using a cell phone and credit card).The final scene is one of the best--they discover a digital camera with all the pictures of the groups' hi-jinx the night before. They all agree to look at the pictures once and then erase all of them. As the credits roll, the pictures reveal the machinations of the bumbling threesome during their crazed night out on the town.Of all the characters, I thought Stu the dentist was the funniest. We finally do find out how he lost that tooth--and the scene where he stands up to his overbearing girlfriend at the film's climax was hilarious. I expected a little more with Alan's character as he was introduced as to be the really crazy one at the beginning--but somehow I wanted him to do even more crazy things at the end. Kudos especially to Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow, the foul-mouthed Chinese gangster, who was truly a hoot!Some of the jokes in ""The Hangover"" don't always hit the mark--the bit about the police tasering the hapless trio in front of a bunch of schoolchildren just seemed a little too much. Nonetheless, 'The Hangover' has proved to be the sleeper hit comedy of 2009 with its one welcome bizarre situation after another.",4,Bizarre tale of Bachelor Party revelers' memory loss proves to be

The Hangover is by far better than all three, and it's possibly one of my favorite comedies of all time.  Its blend of different comedians gives it such a rich and original feel.  Hangover is a classic story of detective, which breaks the chain of useless comedies in the past decade.  We have a picture with a purpose other than trying to make you laugh.  It's a comedy/mystery and the two genres mix wonderfully in this result.Our three main characters are perfectly cast for this movie.  They compliment eachother in an untraditional way that makes most comedic directors jealous.  Who would have thought that Zach Galifianakis would have a major career boost, after his nearly dead career.  He redeems himself so well in this movie, and I think everyone is going to be needing him for that special part in their movie.  Also newcomer Bradley Cooper and Office-boy Ed Helms get big recognition from this movie.  Cooper got a major breakthrough and Helms stepped out of his office cubicle and won the laughs from moviegoers who aren't familiar with his work.  Cast is this movie, without these actors it would certainly fail hardcore.All the supporting actors such as Ken Jeong, Matt Walsh, and many more definately keep the movie burning on its humourous gas.  The film never has a dull moment, and I'm sure you will have a hard time picking a favorite part or line.  My personal favorite was Galifianakis whole performance.  He's definately the movies cake before the icing.  Another thing that keeps me watching the movie more than once, is its style.  Phillips took into care a real sense of great cinematography and lighting.  The movie looks great with all the overcast clouds and goldish lighting on our characters faces.  It looks original and sleek.  It sets a stadard for all new comedies, which is you can't just try and make us laugh, you have to look cool as hell while you do it!",5,Best Movie from Todd Phillips,1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,1991,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Road', 'Trip', 'Old', 'School', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'were', 'films', 'same', 'director', 'Hangover', 'far', 'better', 'three', 'possibly', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'time', 'blend', 'different', 'comedians', 'rich', 'original', 'feel', 'Hangover', 'classic', 'story', 'detective', 'chain', 'useless', 'comedies', 'past', 'decade', 'have', 'picture', 'purpose', 'other', 'trying', 'make', 'laugh', 'comedy/mystery', 'two', 'genres', 'mix', 'wonderfully', 'result.Our', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'movie', 'compliment', 'eachother', 'untraditional', 'way', 'most', 'comedic', 'directors', 'jealous', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'would', 'have', 'major', 'career', 'boost', 'nearly', 'dead', 'career', 'so', 'well', 'movie', 'think', 'everyone', 'going', 'be', 'needing', 'special', 'part', 'movie', 'Also', 'newcomer', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Office-boy', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'get', 'big', 'recognition', 'movie', 'Cooper', 'got', 'major', 'breakthrough', 'Helms', 'stepped', 'office', 'cubicle', 'won', 'laughs', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'work', 'Cast', 'movie', 'actors', 'would', 'certainly', 'fail', 'supporting', 'actors', 'such', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'Matt', 'Walsh', 'many', 'more', 'definately', 'keep', 'movie', 'burning', 'humourous', 'gas', 'film', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'picking', 'favorite', 'part', 'line', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', 'Galifianakis', 'whole', 'performance', 'definately', 'movies', 'cake', 'icing', 'thing', 'watching', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'style', 'Phillips', 'took', 'care', 'real', 'sense', 'great', 'cinematography', 'lighting', 'movie', 'great', 'overcast', 'clouds', 'goldish', 'lighting', 'characters', 'original', 'sleek', 'stadard', 'new', 'comedies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'try', 'make', 'have', 'look', 'cool', 'hell', 'do']",The Hangover - UNRATED

1239999,A2BDQQ39DJ826Y,B001UV4XEM,viewer,"[41, 68]","I was looking forward to this movie, based on some enthusiastic word of mouth from a couple of acquaintances. As I stared at the screen with my expression becoming blank, then black, and without ever laughing out loud, all I could think of was that some movies make you look differently at the people who recommend them. ""The Hangover"" is a base, empty mess, wrapped in some slick packaging and hype.I know the party line, from some, but certainly not other, reviews: the movie is a wild, gross-out fun ride that goes down smooth. Quirky buddies try to reconstruct a wild bachelor party night in Las Vegas after they black out and wake up the next day in their trashed hotel suite, with their friend the groom missing. They are a supposedly likable bunch of a weird-acting stoner slob, a dorky dentist with a domineering, unfaithful long-time girlfriend, an irresponsible, self-centered hunk, and a dour boy scout. In their adventures, they encounter colorful characters, like smart-mouth cops, a sleazy owner of a quickie wedding chapel, and Mike Tyson (magically rich, no longer bankrupt, with some canned eccentricities added).The problem is that the movie does nothing but string together a series of gags -- either crude or violent or both -- that grow more and more depressing the clearer it becomes that everything about the movie is shallow, phony, and clich&eacute;. The missing night reconstructed over the course of the movie, with any remaining graphic details gratuitously laid on thick over the end credits, is strikingly unimaginative. (Drunken time with hookers; the drunk, hen-pecked dork marries a single-mom hooker with a heart of gold and then falls for her for real; the awkward slob as genius at cards; the groom swearing renewed, undying devotion to his fianc&eacute;; trashing fancy and cop cars; stuck-up, rich parents of the bride, totally wasting Jeffrey Tambor.) As to the mattress tossed from high up down on top of the hotel statue, it is an embarrassing plot contrivance, conveniently to delay finding the groom, that no one investigates until the last minute the source of the damage (including the police or hotel staff, who would know better than anyone that it was a hotel mattress, that none of the hotel windows open, and that hotel cameras would have picked it all up). The rush back to L.A. and happy endings are pat, forced, and uninteresting.Like a self-indulgent child, the movie wants to have it both ways -- the buddies are supposed to be relatable, down-to-earth guys, yet somehow manage to reserve a $4500/night luxury Vegas ""villa,"" come up with fancy clothes at will, and all have hot-looking girlfriends, wives, fianc&eacute;s, or families. The movie goes for cheap laughs early on by having the slob say he has to stay away by law from schools and parks, yet later treats his carrying around a baby, even making lewd gestures with its hand, as all part of the fun. The same tendency is true of the film's use throughout of what it calls this ""fat man"" as a pratfalling, publicly urinating punching bag; turning him into an instant genius at cards; his casual talk about using the drug ecstasy; and the film's use of slurs to describe the dorky dentist. The hunk, portrayed as a jerk and not in the least believable as a ""school teacher,"" suddenly becomes a devoted family man at the end, hanging all over his wife and son and later even carrying his sleeping son over his shoulder while he leers at cell phone pictures taken by one of his buddies of nude women they made out with in Vegas, as well as of the dentist's bloody, stupidly smiling face after drunkenly pulling out one of his front teeth that night on a dare. The movie does not even manage to convey any genuine sense of joy to the adventures, even as it seems to glorify them, including lots of senseless destruction (like trashing hotel rooms and cars, someone getting shot, an effeminate, foul-mouthed Asian beating people with a tire-iron, the tooth-pulling, etc.).Add to this these points recently made by a print reviewer about the movie:  ""I didn't think 'The Hangover' was all that funny.  It was too choppy, too mean-spirited and too much of an ensemble that didn't fit together as well as it should have.""  (As to the embarrassingly uncritical pass Roger Ebert gave this movie, like so many others, it only reminds me why I always liked Gene Siskel so much better.)Why sweat any of this? It's about drunken partying, right? Identify with it. Go with the flow. It's not about making sense or taking anything seriously. If that works for you, fine. Maybe this is one of those movies where someone likes almost everything or almost nothing.  All a reviewer can do is explain why s/he feels one way or the other. For the reasons discussed, what is bad or weak about the movie so overwhelms anything good about it that the above excuses come across to this reviewer as just a convenient, lame cop-out.  A cop-out here for failing to entertain in any meaningful sense of the word and in the process not merely disappointing, but spoiling the time of, plenty of people who were looking forward to a good time at the movies.",1,"A slick, empty downer",1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,5138,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'based', 'enthusiastic', 'word', 'mouth', 'couple', 'acquaintances', 'stared',

We hadn't really seen these actors before, so the characters seemed 'real' at the time. Funny set-up, great dialogue line-per-line,  every situation hilarious,  and to reiterate, great characters all around right down to even the wedding singer near the end of the film. An instant classic. One would beg the question, ""Hasn't this been done before?"" Yes, (i.e. the terrible VERY BAD THINGS) but [they] perfected it on this one.

But I was pleasently surprised, this is a well written and well acted movie which is not only very funny but also rewarding. While a lot of what's happening in the plot is totally absurd (on purpose), the main characters are believable and even likeable. The true subject of the movie is the camaraderie between the 3 buddies(eventually accepting the 4th one as well)and how they overcome together ridiculously tough (and hillariously funny) situations. I read that the actors playing Doug, Phil and Stu are actually buddies in real life and it shows in the way they talk and care for each other. As many have noticed the plot has a lot in common with 'Dude, where's my car?' but I think The Hangover is even better since the heroes are (more or less) mature individuals who are able to digest the absurdity of their situation, and not just stoners who most of the time are not even aware to wjhat's really happening.",4,Suprisingly good,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,1026,"['was', 'afraid', 'will', 'be', 'spirit', 'American', 'Pie', 'legacy', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'bad', 'taste', 'comedies', 'was', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'funny', 'also', 'rewarding', 'lot', 'what', 'happening', 'plot', 'totally', 'absurd', 'purpose', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'even', 'likeable', 'true', 'subject', 'movie', 'camaraderie', '3', 'buddies', 'eventually', 'accepting', '4th', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'overcome', 'together', 'ridiculously', 'tough', 'hillariously', 'funny', 'situations', 'read', 'actors', 'playing', 'Doug', 'Phil', 'Stu', 'are', 'actually', 'buddies', 'real', 'life', 'way', 'talk', 'care', 'other', 'many', 'have', 'noticed', 'plot', 'lot', 'common', ""'Dude"", 'where', 'car', 'think', 'Hangover', 'even', 'better', 'heroes', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'mature', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'digest', 'absurdity', 'situation', 'not', 'just', 'stoners', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'aware', 'wjhat', 'really', 'happening']",The Hangover - UNRATED
