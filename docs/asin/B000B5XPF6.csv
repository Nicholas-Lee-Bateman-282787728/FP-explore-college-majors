I agree with another reviewer, the script is all over the place. It makes little sense. It could have been far better maybe with a re -write. The music and direction didn't bother me, but the direction was slow because of the poor slow moving script. No director could have made a quality production with what they gave them.  I can only recommend it because it is a penny, plus the postage.

936300,A26HD3S38PLD5A,B000B5XPF6,"BO BO BOB ""WESLEY""","[2, 5]","I love this type of slasher flick: no name-brand actors, no big budget, good acting and an interesting story that is more than T & A being sliced and diced. One has to place more emphasis on the acting, when there are no elaborite scenes and special effects. I counted about three separate stories within the stroy that all seemed to blend with the murder of the young kids in the beginning of the movie. The people in this movie looked normal: NO STUNNING BEAUTIES WITH EXTRA  LARGE BRESTS, NO SEXIEST MAN OF THE YEAR CANDIDATES FOR PEOPLE MAGAZINE, just plain everyday looking people.The story is one of revenge and a lunatic erasing the past. I really hope there are not kids out there as stupid as the four in the beginning. It was kind of not credible that in the midst of having sex with two beautiful girls, that teen boys would be radioing each other for status reports while bragging about there performance in the last football game. Other than that, the movie was well made, directed and told the story it wanted to tell. The killer with the big face is probably typecast in these types of rolls and continues to do an excellent job. Had the deputy and the detective gotten romantically involved, at the end, this would have made for a better ending. Either he could have stayed or she could have went with him, had the director made thier relationship to blossom more during the movie.All in all a good movie. I  have paid more fore worse.

936301,A31A9GENAJYD64,B000B5XPF6,David M. Rossi,"[1, 4]","The one aspect of this movie preventing it from being a Dudley Crap recipient is the fact that with a little more budget, this movie could have been a lot more credible. The low budget is so painfully obvious from moment one that it is hard to keep it out of your mind as you watch it. Rockville Slayer has a decent amount of plot and dramatic devices going for it and Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's brother) does an admirable job as the sherriff and keeps the other actors well grounded, but ultimately the film's many plot points come up feeling slight because of the budgetary constraints. The cover artwork and description lead you to believe this is just another slasher kill fest, but that is not the case. Its a decent enough mystery that in spite of its'low budget keeps you somewhat interested throughout.Rockville Slayer is certainly a cut above many other low budget trash horror on the market.Story:3.5 stars Acting: 3 stars Budget: 1 star.

936303,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000B5XPF6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","The Rockville Slayer (Marc Selz, 2004)The reason I'm not sure if Spiker was the worst movie I saw this week is entirely down to The Rockville Slayer. It might have been slightly, and I do mean slightly, better, but every time I thought there was some minor hope that this movie was going to get (relatively) better, the horrendous acting and terrible special effects, as well as the rootlessness of the final thirty minutes of the movie, pulled it right back down into the muck.The movie opens with the deaths of three high school students and the mutilation of a fourth. Suspicion for the murders falls on a recently escaped mental patient (Amy Brown, from the wonderfully-named Pot Zombies), but the local sheriff's deputy (Circus-Szalewski--yes, that's his name) and an FBI detective (Nicole Buehrer of the upcoming Trippin') aren't buying into the conventional wisdom.There's a reason very few people in this movie have extensive acting credits (and those who do are known for acting in terrible movies--Joe Estevez, Robert Z'Dar, Linnea Quigley, and in his first film, Richard Strobel all make appearances here); the acting here is uniformly awful. And for ""awful"", read ""it's the worst acting you've seen in any movie with a budget of more than ten thousand dollars."" Even worse is the script, which allows the bad actors to deliver hackneyed lines. Not only that, but the movie feels like it should have actually been about an hour long; the rest of it seems as if it were tacked on when they realized the movie wasn't quite feature-length. It gets dumb (well, dumber) at that point, and never recovers. It's watchable, in a train-wreck sort of way, but you'll hate yourself in the morning.

936304,A63F9UIERBW1A,B000B5XPF6,Scott Goring,"[13, 14]","SPOILER ALERT!: The producers tried to hide the bad reviews this film received under its original title ""Unaware"" by changing the name to ""Rockville Slayer"". A rose by any other name would smell as sweet but a stinker is a stinker no matter what you call it. It's direct to video films like this that have become the new last stomping grounds for ex-stars on their way to retirement. Joe Estevez tries his best and he's the only thing ""Rockville Slayer"" has going for it. Robert Z'Dar looks and acts like he didn't care. At times you'll think he was looking around to make sure the paymaster was on the set. Linnea Quigley was a beautiful starlet in classics like ""Return of the Living Dead"" but those salad days are twenty years gone. Some of the newcomers are attractive but they won't want to include this on their future resumes.And I've learned from experience with this film company, get ready for the family and friends of the cast and crew and director to start piling on with fake reviews to pump up the films rating. Look especially at all the reviews from ""reviewers"" who are only reviewing this one film (before its release date!) or just reviewing this film and ""Bomb The System"" or one other film...quite a coincidence, is it not?  It's a sorry state, really.  But wait, once they read this expose they will try to get it removed and start adding to their fake review catalog.The story is really about some psycho who goes around skewering the usual set of cardboard characters in a small town that might have some secrets in its history. When the town's only hope rests on the narrow shoulders of a deputy who looks like he was cast as Barney Fife's twin, and whose played by some guy named, I swear, Circus, I knew there was no hope for either the town or for me. You have a whole cast full of nobodies and suddenly b-movie stock actors Robert Z'Dar and Linnea Quigley show up (and show their age) and you immediately know they have to be the bad guys. They get theirs in a simpleton shootout ending and then Barney Fife drives away and leaves town.
