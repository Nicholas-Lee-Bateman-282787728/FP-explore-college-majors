1176335,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B001CFEC2Y,calvinnme,"[1, 1]","This documentary is one of the scariest haunting stories of which I've heard, and is probably the best episode in Discovery's haunting series. I will warn you that there are spoilers ahead.The premise of the story that the Snedeker family needs to move closer to where the oldest son, Stephen, is being treated for cancer. The family thinks they have found the answer to their prayers when they find a large home that has just been remodeled that is being leased for a very reasonable price. However, they soon learn the reason for the bargain. The house is a former funeral home. However, with the expense of the son's cancer treatment weighing heavily on the family budget, the Snedekers are unable to afford breaking their lease and moving to yet another house. Demons soon invade their domicile - or they invade the demons' domicile, depending on how you look at it - until the supernatural detectives, the Warrens, are called in and with the help of an exorcism, restore peace to the household.Just as much as fright, though, I felt a great deal of anger at the Snedekers as parents. For one thing, Mr. Snedeker seems to believe that the size of his electricity bill is more important than the mental health of a child recovering from cancer since he removes all of the light bulbs from the basement bedroom so that Stephen can no longer sleep with the lights on. Then he forces the boy to continue sleeping in this bedroom in spite of his tales of horror of being tormented by apparitions coming from the former embalming room adjacent to his basement bedroom. He does this in spite of the fact that he and his wife have both personally been the victims of attacks and witnesses of various manifestations of the house's spirits. Afterwards, in despair, the boy just gives in to the demons' collective will, manifesting in more and more bizarre behavior until he finally attacks a visiting cousin. How Mrs. Snedeker could have invited this young niece into her home in the first place just because she wanted the companionship and help around the house, having witnessed firsthand the mayhem that the house's demons can cause, as well as her son's deteriorating mental state, is a wonder to me.I have read an interview with the author of a book on this haunting, which tracks this documentary closely, and he paints both the Warrens and the Snedekers in a very unflattering light in that interview. He basically says that he does not really believe the Snedekers' stories, since even the Warrens themselves told the author that they think that all of their clients are crazy including the Snedekers. Plus, apparently there was considerable drug and alcohol abuse going on in the Snedeker household and the family members would never tell the same story twice. The author only went through with writing his book because he was already legally obligated to do so.However, even if the account told in this documentary is total fiction, it is well told and frightening fiction and I highly recommend it. It is much better than the movie which suffers from a real lack of imagination given the subject matter.",5,The documentary is scarier and more  interesting than the movie,1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,3109,"['documentary', 'one', 'scariest', 'haunting', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'probably', 'best', 'episode', 'Discovery', 'haunting', 'series', 'will', 'warn', 'are', 'spoilers', 'ahead.The', 'premise', 'story', 'Snedeker', 'family', 'move', 'closer', 'where', 'oldest', 'son', 'Stephen', 'being', 'treated', 'cancer', 'family', 'have', 'found', 'answer', 'prayers', 'when', 'find', 'large', 'home', 'just', 'been', 'remodeled', 'being', 'leased', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'However', 'soon', 'learn', 'reason', 'bargain', 'house', 'former', 'funeral', 'home', 'However', 'expense', 'son', 'cancer', 'treatment', 'weighing', 'heavily', 'family', 'budget', 'Snedekers', 'are', 'unable', 'afford', 'breaking', 'lease', 'moving', 'yet', 'house', 'Demons', 'soon', 'invade', 'domicile', 'invade', 'demons', 'domicile', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'supernatural', 'detectives', 'Warrens', 'are', 'called', 'help', 'exorcism', 'restore', 'peace', 'household.Just', 'as', 'much', 'fright', 'felt', 'great', 'deal', 'anger', 'Snedekers', 'parents', 'one', 'thing', 'Mr.', 'Snedeker', 'believe', 'size', 'electricity', 'bill', 'more', 'important', 'mental', 'health', 'child', 'recovering', 'cancer', 'light', 'bulbs', 'basement', 'bedroom', 'Stephen', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'sleep', 'lights', 'Then', 'boy', 'continue', 'sleeping', 'bedroom', 'spite', 'tales', 'horror', 'being', 'tormented', 'apparitions', 'coming', 'former', 'embalming', 'room', 'adjacent', 'basement', 'bedroom', 'spite', 'fact', 'wife', 'have', 'personally', 'been', 'victims', 'attacks', 'witnesses', 'various', 'manifestations', 'house', 'spirits', 'Afterwards', 'despair', 'boy', 'just', 'demons', 'collective', 'will', 'manifesting', 'more', 'more', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'finally', 'visiting', 'cousin', 'How', 'Mrs.', 'Snedeker', 'could', 'have', 'invited', 'young', 'niece', 'home', 'first', 'place', 'just', 'wanted', 'companionship', 'help', 'house', 'having', 'witnessed', 'firsthand', 'mayhem', 'house', 'demons', 'can', 'cause', 'as', 'well', 'son', 'deteriorating', 'mental', 'state', 'wonder', 'me.I', 'have', 'read', 'interview', 'author', 'book', 'haunting', 'documentary', 'closely', 'Warrens', 'Snedekers', 'very', 'unflattering', 'light', 'interview', 'basically', 'not', 'really', 'believe', 'Snedekers', 'stories', 'even', 'Warrens', 'told', 'author', 'think', 'clients', 'are', 'crazy', 'including', 'Snedekers', 'apparently', 'was', 'considerable', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'going', 'Snedeker', 'household', 'family', 'members', 'would', 'never', 'tell', 'same', 'story', 'twice', 'author', 'only', 'went', 'writing', 'book', 'was', 'already', 'legally', 'obligated', 'do', 'so.However', 'even', 'account', 'told', 'documentary', 'total', 'fiction', 'well', 'told', 'frightening', 'fiction', 'highly', 'recommend', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'real', 'lack', 'imagination', 'given', 'subject', 'matter']",A Haunting in Connecticut

1176337,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001CFEC2Y,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","A Haunting in Connecticut was the first of two pilot episodes for Discovery Channel'sA Haunting - Seasons 1-4, one of the best paranormal television series of all time.  The story documented herein is perhaps more fascinating now than it was when the program first aired back in 2002, as the story - and the controversy surrounding it - has received renewed attention coinciding with the release of the filmThe Haunting in Connecticut (Unrated Special Edition)based on the same story of ghostly infestation.  While I have not yet seen the new feature film, a quick perusal of the plot summary makes it quite clear that it differs significantly from original eyewitness accounts - in other words, this program is well worth watching even if you've seen the 2009 horror film.  On the other hand, this documentary actually tells a significantly watered-down version of the original story.  I find that disappointing yet understandable given the deeply personal nature of some of the reported events and the fact that the credibility of the entire story had come strongly in to question by 1999, when Ray Garton, the man contracted to write the story of the haunting in the bookIn a Dark Place, publicly impugned the integrity of the family as well as world-famous investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren.  Whether the whole story is truth or fiction, though, I think all would agree that it makes a hell of a good story.This particular haunting is particularly troubling because it involves the demonic targeting of a young teenager battling cancer.  The Parker family (as it is referred to here) moved from New York to Connecticut so that their cancer-stricken son Paul would be close to his doctors; desperate to find some place for their fairly large family to stay, they jumped at the chance to land this large and relatively inexpensive home.  Only when they moved in did they discover that the place used to be a funeral parlour.  The parents really aren't concerned about this, though - even when three of their children begin reporting frightening sights and sounds.  It's bad enough that both parents refuse to believe their children's stories, but it's frustrating to say the least to watch them blame Paul for putting the idea of ghosts in his siblings' heads.  Whether they believed him or not, I can't understand why they would force an obviously-frightened young man fighting a life-and-death struggle with cancer to stay in a room that scares him so much; the father even removes the light bulbs from the room.  This sets Paul up for great suffering indeed.  Of course, once the parents finally get a sample of what has been tormenting all of their children, they race to find a solution to the problem, eventually turning to demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren for help.  The Warrens and their research team are soon treated to a range of evidence that convinces them that a strong demonic presence abides in the ill-fated house.The truth of this haunting is very much in doubt, but the events recreated in this program are pretty extraordinary and, in some cases, quite distinct and unusual.  This isn't a program you would want to let your kids watch just before going to bed, as bad dreams are made of the phenomena on display here.

This video version is very good.  As a person who actually grew up in former funeral home, I can testify truthfully that they are not all terrifying and infested with demons!  (Ghosts, yes, but demons......no.)As with the book, I have a hard time believing completely some of the details as being factual.There are some things about the story that make me ask ""huh?""  For instance, even if you didn't believe in ghosts and spirits, would you really put your children down in the basement and expect them to sleep in what used to be a morgue?  And when they began running up the stairs night after night, screaming and crying and reporting that they saw apparitions, wouldn't a parent feel enough sympathy to let them sleep on the pull-out sofa in the living room, instead of continuing to insist that they return to the basement aka morgue, to sleep?I find it to be rather cruel myself.  I mean, why didn't the parents take the basement bedroom and let the boys sleep upstairs?  It is tantamount to abuse, in my opinion.And no matter how much debt you had, would you still sleep in a place that molested its inhabitants?  In a place that didn't allow you a simple nights rest?  I mean, wouldn't Motel 6 look like a pretty good deal at some point?  I wonder about those things.So there are parts of the story that don't really add up.

1176358,A1E8RC0BLALMUN,B001CFEC2Y,T. Smith,"[0, 6]","This picture left me with a sense of being haunted but for reasons one might not suspect.  First I paid threatre price to see it.  Second I was told by the person who accompanied me that I dozed off for a few seconds while watching it. While I dont totally believe this it might be true as it lacked much to define it as frightening or scary.Given this was passed off as horror (although it had PG13 rating) I was left haunted a little by my own mild embarrassment at being perhaps a tad rude perhaps to my theatre companion and the filmakers that there horror frightner could induce me to a state of negative consciousness for even a few seconds.The basic premise is fine as far as premises go. Which with this film was pretty short.  A son sticken with cancer and a family renting a house near a hospital while the eldest son gets chemotherapy. The home has a past. It is former mortuary where years of inconceivable acts occurred. Good start. Virgina Madsen, one my favorite actresss, was the stalwart mother holding the family togther in a role she has played so well before. However even her talent seems mostly wasted here. The opening was the most credible part for her.The begining catches us for a few minutes. It is a teaser.  It fools us into thinking heh this might be interesting. Madsen talks to the TV camera about the horror of her family story. At the end she comes back to do a wrap up and this is  a nice way to tie everything into a package. Kudos to the filmakers doing this.However, films are more than beginning and endings neatly tied. Because yes Virginia, films do have a middle and this picture has no Santa Clause. It was a shame to watch Madsen along with notables such as Elias Koteas (the priest)  simply appear to be wasted talent going through the motions as opposed to acting. Kyle Gallner gives a fair performance, portraying his build to insanity. So the acting was not really the main problem. It is Hard to rise like an eagle for any of these actors when the script is basically a turkey.After the initial interest of opening, things descend to the basement literally and figuratively. For some reason the son with cancer decides to reside in the cellar while getting his treament. What follows is a  muddled nightmare of crashing banging,and jolting, in a filmic style best decribed as a train after it has left the rails but still tryinmg to stay upright.  It  bumps bangs, grinds, and crashes from scene to scene supported by an equlally jolting background cast replete with shreaking, wailing violins and other sounds designed to make you jump and of course appropriate visuals of barbecued corpses and other wrapped dead bodies that reminded me of footage from other films.There were some interesting ectoplasmic effects and even a priest who reminded me vaguely of the Exorcist. Interesting scene near the end of a faded shot of the cancer son in a graveyard. Is he dead? It jolts back to a scene of firefighters doing CPR on sons chest. The films trys to attempt some climax as struggling to make us ask the big life question. Is this check out time? Will cancer son live or succumb to his illness and the demon house which is actually keeping him alive.In this moment of attempted ""climatic moment"" we should feel something. Most would hope on some level he makes it but from a film perespective we are not given much to reason to care.  Throughout cancer son's trial with chemotherapy the film provid little ffor us to hang on to. The son might as well have had the  misery of psorsias. Even approrpriate horror film stock scenes of vomiting did not make us feel anymore empathy. Add to this a pseudo tragic picture of an alcoholic father in some rage to turn of lightbulbs and it the result had me thinking maybe he was in the wrong film trying to save the world from an energy crisis.  The director seemed to forget we might want to care about the characters.Insconstenecies in the story are for others to note. Why didnt the family just leave? Who knows. In fact, what this picture really needed to work for me was clowns. Clowns are scary. A large set of nasty clown figures in  masks screaming and running wild would have topped things off. So that makes no sense? This assume the film itself makes sense overall.Haunting uses a cliche hook in the credits saying it based on a true story. Yes it based on a real life family. So what. As one writer noted listening or watching the family who experienced the real terror might have been more interesting and apparently according to reviews the original story available on several big box sites as a bio documentrary is quite well done. Truth stranger than fiction perhaps? Well this film is high in the strange quotient.Fright quotient of Haunting is mininmal. Music was maybe the sum total of films creep quotient. Although it was ""startling"" when a pile of dishes broke loudly, among other things banging around. However someone sitting in front of the theater was talking or arguing loudly on a cell phone jolted me more than the the picture. Maybe todays audience equates being jolted by loud banging and jumpy edits as the hallmarkmark of good horror.My rating system gives it 3 stars. Two for Viginia Madsen doing well with what she had to work with and 1 for Gallner) and 2 yawns.A haunting cinematic vista of schlock and jolt.Tim M Smith.",3,Haunted by the fact I paid premium price

1176359,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001CFEC2Y,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","I love the Haunting series produced by the Discovery Channel, and have all Seasons 1-4. The show is well-produced and most of the stories not only ring true but have the ability to really creep viewers out.Of all the stories portrayed in the series, I'd have to say ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" stands out as one of the scariest stories. In this story, the Parker family moves into their supposedly dream home, a break they desperately need considering one of their children, a son, suffers from cancer. Instead, the family is beset by spooky goings-on, and discover to their horror certain strange artifacts in the house such as coffin keys and a huge freezer in the cellar. They realise that the house used to be a funeral home, and have to cope with the hauntings. They finally seek the help of Edward and Lorraine Warren, the same couple that investigated another haunted house that came to be known as the Amityville horror.The docu-drama is credibly done with effects that are average, yet manage to creep out viewers. The story is also something that doesn't seem unbelievable, there is a ring of truth to it, and though the movie version seems to sensationalize the story, this docu-drama effectively captures the family's nightmare and plight. The viewer comes to sympathize with the family, especially given that they already have enough on their plate - a sick son and added on to that, a house that is inhabited by supernatural entities. Highly recommended, and while you're at it, I'd recommend getting Haunting Seasons 1-4, especially since it is currently being heavily discounted here on Amazon.",5,Creepy docudrama,1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,1610,"['love', 'Haunting', 'series', 'produced', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'have', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'show', 'well-produced', 'most', 'stories', 'not', 'only', 'ring', 'true', 'have', 'ability', 'really', 'creep', 'viewers', 'stories', 'portrayed', 'series', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'out', 'one', 'scariest', 'stories', 'story', 'Parker', 'family', 'moves', 'supposedly', 'dream', 'home', 'break', 'desperately', 'need', 'considering', 'one', 'children', 'son', 'suffers', 'cancer', 'Instead', 'family', 'beset', 'spooky', 'goings-on', 'discover', 'horror', 'certain', 'strange', 'artifacts', 'house', 'such', 'coffin', 'keys', 'huge', 'freezer', 'cellar', 'realise', 'house', 'used', 'be', 'funeral', 'home', 'have', 'cope', 'hauntings', 'finally', 'seek', 'help', 'Edward', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'same', 'couple', 'investigated', 'haunted', 'house', 'came', 'be', 'known', 'Amityville', 'horror.The', 'docu-drama', 'credibly', 'done', 'effects', 'are', 'average', 'yet', 'manage', 'creep', 'out', 'viewers', 'story', 'also', 'something', ""n't"", 'seem', 'unbelievable', 'ring', 'truth', 'movie', 'version', 'sensationalize', 'story', 'docu-drama', 'effectively', 'family', 'nightmare', 'plight', 'viewer', 'sympathize', 'family', 'especially', 'given', 'already', 'have', 'enough', 'plate', 'sick', 'son', 'added', 'house', 'inhabited', 'supernatural', 'entities', 'Highly', 'recommended', ""'re"", ""'d"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'Haunting', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'especially', 'currently', 'being', 'heavily', 'discounted', 'here', 'Amazon']",A Haunting in Connecticut
