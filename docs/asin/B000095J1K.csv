For Dave Chappelle, as well as many other black comedians, he tends to focus on the difference between blacks and whites. Despite it being hilarious, it's also ""safe"" in a weird way, as if you're not going to be shocked and offended, it's just ""the Dave we know and love"".Many stories, some quite hiliarious are present here. My favorite is his discovery of just how bad some of our favorite children shows are, complete with some impersonations of characters on Sesame Street. There's many others including his white friend managing to escape jail time, a night in a limousine, and some jabs at the Clinton and Lewinsky scandal.Where it falls slightly flat(it's still funny though) is the ""see, black people don't do that ****"" stuff, since it's essentially rampant in every black comedian's repertoire such as Chris Rock. It's not as funny when you've heard it many other times by Chris Rock or Bernie Mac or D.L Hughley or any of the others.One unfortunate thing about this disc is that it's an hour long. It's actually 55 minutes but considering the price on here, it's pretty good but instead of let's say combining 2 comedy gigs they just show one so it's much better to rent or just surf HBO every weekend.

752055,AXLXU4LMIRO3F,B000095J1K,MartialWay,"[16, 37]","I want to start by saying this HBO special introduced me to Dave Chapelle. Actually the movie Con Air did, but this was my first exposure to him as a standup comedian. I love this guy's comedy. I love it! He cracks me and my girlfriend up whenever he appears on a tv screen.That being said, while Dave Chapelle is very funny, no doubt, I think it's a stretch calling his material ""genius"". I find his comedy to be original, smart and frankly a roll-around-laughing-hilarious, yet essentially derivative of every single solitary African-American stand up comic I've ever seen, i.e. the bulk of his ""genius"" material consists of anecdotes and jabs with the sole purpose of belittling Caucasians, ""Killin' them softly"".In the two hours he talks his talk I can safely say most of it was painting whites as the racist morons of society, doing it in that white-person's mock voice that ALL ""genius"" black comedians do (y'know, as if we all talk like anal news anchormen or stoned surfers). While he does it in his own playful way, and one should know he isn't serious, you couldn't honestly say that his brand of comedy is 100% new. Show me a black comedian that doesn't rip on white people to get a cheap laugh and I'll show you something you've never seen before.Still his comedy makes me cry with laughter, I own Chapelle's Show first season on DVD and can't wait for the next one. I watch his show on Comedy Central (when it isn't a rerun, which means these days I don't), so don't go calling me bitter because he makes white jokes. I laugh at them as much as the black guys do. I think he's great, and seems to be approachable to anyone from any background. I know he's a decent guy. So take it easy before you click on how this didn't help you (even though you don't need help). I'm only making an argument for the ""reviews"" before mine that hail him as a comic ""genius"". That's extreme. If he could make an audience laugh without a single joke about Caucasians, and was still as funny as he is... then I'd have no argument. Until then he's just very, very funny and you should buy this DVD nonetheless.",4,"Some of the best comedy on TV, but far from genius...",1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,2103,"['want', 'start', 'saying', 'HBO', 'special', 'introduced', 'Dave', 'Chapelle', 'Actually', 'movie', 'Con', 'Air', 'did', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'standup', 'comedian', 'love', 'guy', 'comedy', 'love', 'girlfriend', 'up', 'whenever', 'tv', 'screen.That', 'being', 'said', 'Dave', 'Chapelle', 'very', 'funny', 'doubt', 'think', 'stretch', 'calling', 'material', 'genius', 'find', 'comedy', 'be', 'original', 'smart', 'frankly', 'roll-around-laughing-hilarious', 'yet', 'essentially', 'derivative', 'single', 'solitary', 'African-American', 'stand', 'comic', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'i.e', 'bulk', 'genius', 'material', 'anecdotes', 'jabs', 'sole', 'purpose', 'belittling', 'Caucasians', 'Killin', 'softly', 'two', 'hours', 'talk', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'most', 'was', 'painting', 'whites', 'racist', 'morons', 'society', 'doing', 'white-person', 'mock', 'voice', 'ALL', 'genius', 'black', 'comedians', 'do', ""y'know"", 'talk', 'anal', 'news', 'anchormen', 'stoned', 'surfers', 'own', 'playful', 'way', 'one', 'should', 'know', ""n't"", 'serious', 'could', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', 'brand', 'comedy', '100', '%', 'new', 'Show', 'black', 'comedian', ""n't"", 'rip', 'white', 'people', 'get', 'cheap', 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'show', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before.Still', 'comedy', 'cry', 'laughter', 'own', 'Chapelle', 'Show', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'one', 'watch', 'show', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'when', ""n't"", 'rerun', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'calling', 'bitter', 'white', 'jokes', 'laugh', 'as', 'much', 'black', 'guys', 'do', 'think', 'great', 'be', 'approachable', 'anyone', 'background', 'know', 'decent', 'guy', 'So', 'take', 'easy', 'click', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'help', ""'m"", 'only', 'making', 'argument', 'reviews', 'mine', 'comic', 'genius', 'extreme', 'could', 'make', 'audience', 'laugh', 'single', 'joke', 'Caucasians', 'was', 'still', 'as', 'funny', 'then', ""'d"", 'have', 'argument', 'then', 'just', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'should', 'buy', 'DVD', 'nonetheless']",Dave Chappelle: Killin' Them Softly

He cam up with some of the funniest stuff I have ever heard. As usual he was mocking racism and the president and anything else he can jab at. If you want to see something that will make you bust up till you can't breathe then definitley check this out.

Was in store for a ribtickling hour or so. This guy is good!In this particular cameo, he comfortably treads the line of race, social commentary, kids, the presidency, relationships and some other miscellaneous things.

752067,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000095J1K,Wheelchair Assassin,"[2, 2]","If you're in the mood for some irreverent, occasionally off-color black comedy but Chris Rock is a bit ""much"" for you, this HBO standup special is definitely a worthy option.  Dave Chappelle doesn't share Rock's abrasive tone, rapid-fire delivery, or penchant for bursts of profanity, but behind his low-key approach is an equally bold and perceptive comic voice.  And he's really in his element here, free from the inconsistency that has plagued his Comedy Central sketch show since its premiere last year.  Armed with an arsenal of voices ranging from Oscar the Grouch to Bill Clinton to a generic white guy, Dave offers his hilarious take on subjects few comedians can address this well without going over the top.  His assessments of modern-day race and gender relations elicit frequent fits of hooting and hollering from his audience, and it's easy to see why, as Dave seems to have a knack for expressing what everyone else is thinking.  Dave also proves himself to be a master storyteller, particularly with an account of a night in the projects that's both hilarious and depressing at the same time.  Later on he examines the hidden messages in kids' TV, unveils his plans for becoming the first black president, and of course skewers the whole Clinton-Monica Lewinsky situation, how the media covered it, and just what it tells us about the nature of celebrity.  As I've already mentioned, Dave has his own show on Comedy Central right now, and while it's shown a lot of potential it hasn't quite has its stride yet.  If you want some prime Chappelle, kick back with this DVD and of course a copy of ""Half Baked.""",4,Killer material brilliantly delivered,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,1622,"[""'re"", 'mood', 'irreverent', 'occasionally', 'off-color', 'black', 'comedy', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'bit', 'much', 'HBO', 'standup', 'special', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'option', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', ""n't"", 'share', 'Rock', 'abrasive', 'tone', 'rapid-fire', 'delivery', 'penchant', 'bursts', 'profanity', 'low-key', 'approach', 'equally', 'bold', 'perceptive', 'comic', 'voice', 'really', 'element', 'here', 'free', 'inconsistency', 'plagued', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'sketch', 'show', 'premiere', 'last', 'year', 'Armed', 'arsenal', 'voices', 'ranging', 'Oscar', 'Grouch', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'generic', 'white', 'guy', 'Dave', 'hilarious', 'take', 'subjects', 'few', 'comedians', 'can', 'address', 'well', 'going', 'top', 'assessments', 'modern-day', 'race', 'gender', 'relations', 'elicit', 'frequent', 'fits', 'hooting', 'hollering', 'audience', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Dave', 'have', 'knack', 'expressing', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'thinking', 'Dave', 'also', 'be', 'master', 'storyteller', 'particularly', 'account', 'night', 'projects', 'hilarious', 'depressing', 'same', 'time', 'Later', 'hidden', 'messages', 'kids', 'TV', 'plans', 'becoming', 'first', 'black', 'president', 'course', 'skewers', 'whole', 'Clinton-Monica', 'Lewinsky', 'situation', 'how', 'media', 'covered', 'just', 'what', 'nature', 'celebrity', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'Dave', 'own', 'show', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'right', 'now', 'shown', 'lot', 'potential', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stride', 'yet', 'want', 'prime', 'Chappelle', 'kick', 'back', 'DVD', 'course', 'copy', 'Half', 'Baked']",Dave Chappelle: Killin' Them Softly
