Being a history nut I love all this kind of information and this provides a lot of things that I did not know before, while I had seen some of it on TV before this was much better and more complete.  If you love history and the Bible you will love this.

455642,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,6305239304,David Bower,"[5, 7]","I had first seen this documentary on TV and had recorded it onto VHS tape. The old VHS recording really didn't do it justice so I decided to order this DVD. The section on the ark, which is the major part of the documentary is interesting but not the main reason I bought the DVDThe part that was most fascinating to me was a shorter section on the mechanics of the flood itself. It makes a point of bringing out the very important significance of the waters below, but makes no mention of the waters above; which in my mind is equally important.A book, now out of print but available at some used book sites, details the significance of ""The Waters Above"". This book, by Joseph C. Dillow details more of the mechanics involved in the flood. It also includes detailed information about the Beresovka mammoth; a replica of this mammoth was shown in a scene from the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow"". The remarkable thing about this mammoth was the very repid rate of freezing, and the fact that once frozen it never again thawed thereby preserving intact the contents of the mammoth's stomach in an essentially undigested state. This baby mammoth was discovered in the frozen tundra in Siberia.This point is also brought out in the scene from the movie where the crewman in the downed helicopter freezes in place as he tries to exit the helicopter. The contents of the mammoth's stomach included flowers and ferns which indicated a tropical climate in Siberia at the time the mammoth was frozen. It is also interesting to note the the skin of the mammoth did not have the insulating fat layer found in actic animals but was in fact the skin of a tropical animal.If you have an interest in the Biblical account of creation and the antediluvian world, this DVD provides a point of initial entry into a fascinating filed of study. If you would like to continue your inquiry I can recommed a book called ""The Genesis Flood"" by John Whitcomb and Henry Morris. This book and several others are available on Amazon.com.

455643,A2ETZH5V89IJC4,6305239304,GlobeTrotter79,"[0, 6]","This film still does not adequately address many questions and problems about the flood, the ark, and how the animals got distributed to their present locations afterward, etc. (for example, after leaving the ark on Mt. Ararat, how did the elephants, giraffes, cheetahs, and lions all end up in Africa, while the kangaroos, koalas, and wombats all ended up in Australia, etc?).  Some of the ""scientists"" they have interviewed have no actual degrees in science.  Dr. Carl Baugh, for example, has several ""doctorates""--all from diploma mills or unaccredited institutions.  Two of his three so-called doctorates are in Theology, not science.  His ""degree"" in archaeology comes from the diploma mill that he himself is president of.  If that's not a conflict of interest, I don't know what is.  The fact that they would have this ""expert"" on the show calls into question the credibility of the whole thing.  The ""science"" is not science at all, and the logic is shaky at best.  This film poses as an unbiased scientific investigation into the flood story, but in reality it is just religious propaganda (the film's closing comment should make this clear) put together to try and convince gullible non-believers and help those who already believe the flood myth to feel better about their belief.  I strongly recommend that everyone do some rudimentary research into this film and the real science behind the flood story (look at sources from both sides of the argument), and you will find this ""documentary"" is just a hoax.",1,Still some questions,1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,1519,"['film', 'still', 'not', 'adequately', 'address', 'many', 'questions', 'problems', 'flood', 'ark', 'how', 'animals', 'got', 'distributed', 'present', 'locations', 'afterward', 'etc', 'example', 'leaving', 'ark', 'Mt', 'Ararat', 'how', 'did', 'elephants', 'giraffes', 'cheetahs', 'lions', 'end', 'up', 'Africa', 'kangaroos', 'koalas', 'ended', 'up', 'Australia', 'etc', 'scientists', 'have', 'interviewed', 'have', 'actual', 'degrees', 'science', 'Dr.', 'Carl', 'Baugh', 'example', 'several', 'doctorates', 'diploma', 'mills', 'unaccredited', 'institutions', 'Two', 'three', 'so-called', 'doctorates', 'are', 'Theology', 'not', 'science', 'degree', 'archaeology', 'diploma', 'mill', 'president', 'not', 'conflict', 'interest', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'expert', 'show', 'question', 'credibility', 'whole', 'thing', 'science', 'not', 'science', 'logic', 'shaky', 'best', 'film', 'unbiased', 'scientific', 'investigation', 'flood', 'story', 'reality', 'just', 'religious', 'propaganda', 'film', 'closing', 'comment', 'should', 'make', 'clear', 'put', 'together', 'try', 'convince', 'gullible', 'non-believers', 'help', 'who', 'already', 'believe', 'flood', 'myth', 'feel', 'better', 'belief', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'do', 'rudimentary', 'research', 'film', 'real', 'science', 'flood', 'story', 'look', 'sources', 'sides', 'argument', 'will', 'find', 'documentary', 'just', 'hoax']",Ancient Secrets of the Bible: Noah's Ark - Fact or Fable?

Something doubters contend that not even 19th century man could.2) The Hydro-plate theory shows that there was more to the flood than just a lot of rain. Scoffers believe it was only a local flood.3) Hundreds of cultures world-wide have ancient global flood traditions. One example given is ancient Chinese picto-form words are shown to plainly tell the tale of the flood.This video is dated but being a quality presentation it still deserves consideration. Your understanding should not be based on this one video. There is more current research available now on websites about Noah's ark such as 'Wyatt Museum'.
