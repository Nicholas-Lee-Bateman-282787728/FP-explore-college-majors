For me it's one of those movies that stays with you after leaving the theater. Mickey Rourke was perfect for the role and that's because the part was created for him. Director Darren Aronofsky wanted to come down to earth after THE FOUNTAIN and he sure did. THE WRESTLER like his other films deals heavily with pain and loss. Don't expect light at the end of a tunnel. It just shows how life is a tunnel. Few people have the strength to change.,5,the wrestler,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,497,"['want', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'liked', 'lot', 'one', 'movies', 'leaving', 'theater', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'part', 'was', 'created', 'Director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'wanted', 'come', 'down', 'earth', 'THE', 'FOUNTAIN', 'sure', 'did', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'other', 'films', 'deals', 'heavily', 'pain', 'loss', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'just', 'how', 'life', 'tunnel', 'Few', 'people', 'have', 'strength', 'change']",N/A

J Velarde,"[1, 3]","The Wrestler is the kind of movie you wanna watch over and over, not only because of the emotional rollercoaster that it is, but because is an example that you can still make a good movie without a massive budget.The Wrestler is about Randy Robinson (is not even his real name but he prefers to be called by this) better known as The Ram for his aerial move (very original by the way), called The Ram Jam, not in vain the main character played great by Mickey Rourke drives a Dodge Ram.The movie reflects the drama that several wrestlers live day by day, as Randy tries to not be a star of the past, but still manages to use his previous fame on the top companies to work on the indies, if you are a wrestling fan you will know best about this issue.Mickey Rourke does an excellent job portraying a wrestler, not only because he trained with real wrestlers but because Randy The Ram is almost a copy carbon of the life of Rourke as well.Marisa Tomei does a great job as Cassidy a stripper who wants to get out of the business because of her son, she and Randy form a bond, that in other circumstances can be better suited for a romantic relationship.The movie is not for everyone, since its a wrestling movie, contains violence and of course fault language and a sex scene in a bathroom. However the movie is true and honest, even if some people may consider it derogatory for the wrestling business it portrays a reality many wrestlers (and other athletes from other disciplines) face on their lives.I think the best thing about THE WRESTLER is its honesty and the fact that it was made like an indy movie.The extras on the DVD are scarce, a Bruce Springsteen video with the theme song, and the excellent documentary Within the Ring which explores how the movie came together in a journal type thing. I expected more extras, but still the DVD its okay for the movie since this production was not featured on many theaters.Anyway, not the best movie out there, but still a good interesting production.",4,A good movie even for not wrestling fans,1241481600,"05 5, 2009",2009,2001,"['Wrestler', 'kind', 'movie', 'wan', 'na', 'watch', 'over', 'not', 'only', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'because', 'example', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'massive', 'budget.The', 'Wrestler', 'Randy', 'Robinson', 'not', 'even', 'real', 'name', 'be', 'called', 'better', 'known', 'Ram', 'aerial', 'move', 'very', 'original', 'way', 'called', 'Ram', 'Jam', 'not', 'vain', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'great', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Dodge', 'Ram.The', 'movie', 'drama', 'several', 'wrestlers', 'live', 'day', 'day', 'Randy', 'tries', 'not', 'be', 'star', 'past', 'still', 'use', 'previous', 'fame', 'top', 'companies', 'work', 'indies', 'are', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'will', 'know', 'best', 'issue.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'wrestler', 'not', 'only', 'trained', 'real', 'wrestlers', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'almost', 'copy', 'carbon', 'life', 'Rourke', 'well.Marisa', 'Tomei', 'great', 'job', 'Cassidy', 'stripper', 'who', 'get', 'business', 'son', 'Randy', 'form', 'bond', 'other', 'circumstances', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'suited', 'romantic', 'relationship.The', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'wrestling', 'movie', 'violence', 'course', 'fault', 'language', 'sex', 'scene', 'bathroom', 'However', 'movie', 'true', 'honest', 'even', 'people', 'may', 'consider', 'derogatory', 'wrestling', 'business', 'reality', 'many', 'wrestlers', 'other', 'athletes', 'other', 'disciplines', 'face', 'lives.I', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'honesty', 'fact', 'was', 'made', 'indy', 'movie.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'scarce', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'video', 'theme', 'song', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'Ring', 'how', 'movie', 'came', 'together', 'journal', 'type', 'thing', 'expected', 'more', 'extras', 'still', 'DVD', 'okay', 'movie', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'featured', 'many', 'theaters.Anyway', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'there', 'still', 'good', 'interesting', 'production']",N/A

There is a lot in this movie that will wake people up and realize wrestling is not all as fake as it Semmes not only in the ring but outside of it there is numerous problems in their lives. Mickey Rorecik delivers big time here and holds nothing back. When I was watching this movie I knew wrestlers had addictions in their lives but I did not realize what they would do to go to the extreme of holding on the their dreams of being a pro wrestler. This movie will almost make you cry if not it will because this could relate to a lot of peoples families Now there is nudity and language in this movie but it is at the cost of showing what can really happen in someone's life if they don't take care of the problems that they have.

Mickey Rourke resurrects his career with a superb performance as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a professional wrestler twenty years past his glory days.2. Randy is totally messed up, physically and mentally, all alone and living from one second-rate bout to the next.3. He gets a shot at returning to the big time with a grudge rematch, but finds that his heart isn't totally into it.4. Marisa Tomei plays Cassidy, a stripper/lap dancer also past her prime, following Elizabeth Berkley and Lindsay Lohan to the dreaded career-destroying pole-dancing sequence.  To her credit, she doesn't look half bad, and this doesn't escape the attention of The Ram.5. Randy has a daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) whom he has neglected her entire life, and does his best to make amends.6. He makes a life-changing decision to stay true to the people who love him.This is a down to earth, gritty and believable look at the backstage side of professional wrestling, and the softer side of the guys who mercilessly batter themselves and each other to perform the dangerous choreography craved by their adoring fans.Between the wrestling action and the pounding `80s music (Quiet Riot, Accept, Ratt, Guns N' Roses, Scorpions) there's a genuinely tragic drama playing out, and the casting, acting, sets and costumes are absolutely brilliant.Recommended for fans of gritty drama that mirrors real life.Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: I'm an old broken down piece of meat and I deserve to be all alone, I just don't want you to hate me.Amanda Richards, January 18, 2009",5,My only faith's in the broken bones and bruises I display,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,1754,"['things', 'have', 'comforted', 'drive', 'awayThis', 'place', 'home', 'can', 'not', 'stayMy', 'only', 'faith', 'broken', 'bones', 'bruises', 'display', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Wrestler', 'Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'career', 'superb', 'performance', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'twenty', 'years', 'glory', 'days.2', 'Randy', 'totally', 'messed', 'up', 'physically', 'mentally', 'alone', 'living', 'one', 'second-rate', 'bout', 'next.3', 'shot', 'returning', 'big', 'time', 'grudge', 'rematch', 'heart', ""n't"", 'totally', 'it.4', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Cassidy', 'stripper/lap', 'dancer', 'also', 'prime', 'following', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'dreaded', 'career-destroying', 'pole-dancing', 'sequence', 'credit', ""n't"", 'look', 'half', 'bad', ""n't"", 'escape', 'attention', 'Ram.5', 'Randy', 'daughter', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'whom', 'neglected', 'entire', 'life', 'best', 'make', 'amends.6', 'life-changing', 'decision', 'stay', 'true', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'him.This', 'down', 'earth', 'gritty', 'believable', 'look', 'backstage', 'side', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'softer', 'side', 'guys', 'who', 'mercilessly', 'batter', 'other', 'perform', 'dangerous', 'choreography', 'craved', 'adoring', 'wrestling', 'action', 'pounding', '80s', 'music', 'Quiet', 'Riot', 'Accept', 'Ratt', 'Guns', 'N', 'Roses', 'Scorpions', 'genuinely', 'tragic', 'drama', 'playing', 'out', 'casting', 'acting', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant.Recommended', 'fans', 'gritty', 'drama', 'mirrors', 'real', 'life.Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', ""'m"", 'old', 'broken', 'down', 'piece', 'meat', 'deserve', 'be', 'alone', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hate', 'me.Amanda', 'Richards', 'January', '18', '2009']",N/A

One more shot at fame.  In so many cases, the result is ignominious failure.  It is this process that is at the heart of ""The Wrestler"".Mickey Rourke plays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a one time wrestling great who, twenty years after his glory days, is still trying to eek out an existence in the game.  He is no longer performing in Madison Square Garden.  Instead, he performs before tiny crowds in cold suburban halls.  He knows no other trade.  He is a dinosaur.The balance of the Ram's life is also a mess.  His daughter has disowned him and his romantic life is pathetic.  Randy has hit rock bottom when he collapses from a heart attack.  He survives thanks to a double bi-pass and it is how he confronts his own decline that is the crux of the film.Mickey Rourke is tremendous as the wrestler.  He is a hulk of a man and dominates the film throughout.  This is, indeed, Rourke's own comeback and, unlike the story of the Ram, Rourke succeeds.  He could well be nominated for an Academy Award.  If so, it would be well deserved.  His whole persona is absorbed in the role of the declining star.

1237092,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001TOD92C,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","The hype surrounding Mickey Rourke's career comeback took on a life of its own as `The Wrestler' opened to astounding reviews and the awards season swooped in to reward Rourke for finally making it back to the big screen.  This is both a blessing and a malediction.  `The Wrestler' is probably too small a movie to ever get the recognition it deserves without a backstory like Rourke's, yet that backstory is not the primary reason to embrace this film.  `The Wrestler' is so much more than just a vehicle to prove that Rourke still has the chops to hang with the big dogs.  Sadly, because all the focus went to Rourke the film failed to garner the attention it should have.  Every review raved the man in the leotard instead of the dynamic character study unfolding before their eyes.So, with that said; I'm going to review the movie.You ever hear the saying `less is more'?  I'm sure you have.  It's a very common phrase used to express the need to subtlety.  There is such a thing as too much, so sometimes it is best just to let the story remain simple, that way the director and all others involved can develop that one simple story to perfection.  Such is the case with `The Wrestler'.Here we are told the story of Randy `The Ram' Robinson.  He's a middle-aged, battle scarred wrestler who is way past his prime and desperately trying to adjust to life outside the ring.  When his world is shaken to the core by a physical ailment he is left trying to regain his stride.  Stripped of his entire purpose for existence he is thrown into the world of mere mortals, left to pick up the pieces of his pride as he struggles to be normal.  This means forming a relationship with a local stripper, attempting to reconnect with the daughter he abandoned and even trying to find work that will not just pay the bills but fill a void that has left him rather empty.Simply put, this is a film about a man struggling to live.What is brilliantly captured here is the fact that this world of make believe is the only world that makes any sense to Randy.  As fake and controlled and faux as his ventures in the ring may be (although, it is made brutally obvious that these men do literally destroy themselves for our amusement) it is the only part of his life that is real to him.  Everything else, all the normal human interaction, is a struggle for him.  His attraction to Cassidy (the stripper) is an indication of this as well, since she too is simply playing a part.  They are similar in that their profession defines them and their personal lives are almost a job to them; something far removed from who they really are.The beauty of not bombarding this film with so many subplots and twists is that Aronofsky was able to say so much about humanity.Okay, so now I'll talk about the acting.Before I get to Rourke I want to talk about Marisa Tomei.  Tomei delivers what may be the greatest supporting female performance of the decade here.  What she does here, the emotional connection (and emotional resistance), is perfection.  The scene where she sits in Randy's truck and he's trying desperately to connect to her and you can hear the resistance, the wall she puts up, in her voice; I mean she is stunningly on point.  All her displays of affection have this veneer of surrealism that captures the nature of her profession brilliantly.  Evan Rachel Wood also has a few very effective scenes, although I found her quieter scenes (that whole ""You're my little girl"" scene in particular) to be the most moving.And then there is Rourke.  I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said, but know this, his portrayal of Randy plays out so much like a self portrait that his performance feels truly organic.  This is not acting.  I think that is the biggest compliment I can give Rourke and probably the biggest compliment you can give any actor.  He transcends the performance and simply embodies the man.  Next to Rourke, it is director Aronofsky that delivers the final touches that make this `simple' story ultimately so profound.

1237098,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B001TOD92C,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 4/09, 8/11Rate: 74/09: The long wait had finally come to end today as The Wrestler came out for the first time on DVD. Ever since the movie first appeared in theatres, I knew that it was going to be an excellent picture because of Mickey Rourke's fitting personality with the nature of the film. It made sense to me, and as the months went by, the rave reviews started to build up more and more as I became more and more excited for him. The most fun I've had watching an awards show was the Golden Globes which was hilarious because of Bruce Springsteen's win for Best Song and Darren Aronofsky's flipping of the bird which went uncensored during Mickey's speech for the Best Actor award. Surely, Mickey got nominated for the Academy Awards, and the most exciting awaited moment would finally come for me to see him to win the award. I've always hated those shows, but I was psyched about this one. That night, the award show seemed to go on forever until the Best Actor Award presentation. I had my hopes very high for Mickey and wanted to see what he might do and predicted that he'll probably cry. By the time the winner was revealed, that was the most shocking and the worst moment I can remember in a long time. Anyway, back to the movie, it was no surprise to me...Mickey gave the performance of his career in The Wrestler, and I've seen plenty of his movies, but in The Wrestler, that was his boldest ever. It was truly a tour de force performance that made the film to be the depressing version of Rocky. I was also pleased with Marisa Tomei's performance. She is a stunningly beautiful woman in reality, but in The Wrestler, I was surprised that the director wanted to tone down that beauty factor of hers which I thought was a great move. It did work, and it made her to fit in the movie as whole without standing out that much. However, I am somewhat disappointed with the direction of the film; it is just not as deep as I hoped, and there were too many close-ups which gave me a headache. I preferred the camera to be pulled back away from the characters. Also, I wanted more depth out of Mickey, and I wanted more depth out of the story. I didn't feel there was enough of it in The Wrestler. So, mainly I relied on Mickey Rourke's performance to guide me from start to finish, and it was a great experience. He really took his craft to another level when he played as the beat-down wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. The film was heart-wrenching and harrowing to watch as The Ram continues to sink himself into new lows. In a way, The Wrestler reminded me of Raging Bull because the stories were quite similar and the self-degradation of each of the main characters wasn't different in sense. Most of the time while watching The Wrestler, I kept thinking of the documentary with Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts and how similar the material was to his life.  All in all, The Wrestler brought out the best of Mickey Rourke, and he finally had come alive after two decades of self-destruction. Hey, I wanted to make a comment about the stapler scene. Although it's just a movie, I see that the wrestlers had stapled each other, and of course, it is fake. So why not fake it instead of doing it for real as it was supposed to be the intention on the film? Anyway, I am looking forward to another Mickey Rourke film as long as it's not of comic book crap.8/11: It was clear at 2009 Academy Awards Show that Mickey Rourke got robbed of the Best Actor Oscar. The film, mostly the direction and the cinematography, wasn't good as people think. It was Mickey that made it to float and stay buoyed because he was the star and gave one of the best performances of his career. In so many ways, and for a good reason, The Wrestler was the film that had to be made, and it was the film that was meant for Mickey to star in. Anyone, like I did, who grew up watching WWF and its counterparts during the 80's and 90's will fondly remember the names of the wrestlers, the legendary matches, what performers they were, and how they died later. And then, anyone who watched the early Mickey Rourke films of 80's and early 90's will fondly remember what an enormous talent he was before his crash and burn. Combining both, it was a remarkable comeback for Mickey Rourke and a justified story what professional wrestling was all about. All in all, Mickey should have won the Oscar in 2009. By the way, Marisa Tomei wasn't that good in the film; I guess she got the nod for a nomination for appearing naked. I am dropping the rating of the film from `8' to `7'.",4,Mickey Rourke Got Robbed of the Oscar.,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,4554,"['Viewed', '4/09', '8/11Rate', '74/09', 'long', 'wait', 'had', 'finally', 'come', 'end', 'today', 'Wrestler', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'time', 'DVD', 'Ever', 'movie', 'first', 'appeared', 'theatres', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'excellent', 'picture', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'fitting', 'personality', 'nature', 'film', 'made', 'sense', 'months', 'went', 'rave', 'reviews', 'started', 'build', 'up', 'more', 'more', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'excited', 'most', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'had', 'watching', 'awards', 'show', 'was', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'win', 'Best', 'Song', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'flipping', 'bird', 'went', 'uncensored', 'Mickey', 'speech', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', 'Surely', 'Mickey', 'got', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'most', 'exciting', 'awaited', 'moment', 'would', 'finally', 'come', 'see', 'win', 'award', ""'ve"", 'always', 'hated', 'shows', 'was', 'psyched', 'one', 'night', 'award', 'show', 'seemed', 'go', 'forever', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Award', 'presentation', 'had', 'hopes', 'very', 'high', 'Mickey', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'might', 'do', 'predicted', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'cry', 'time', 'winner', 'was', 'revealed', 'was', 'most', 'shocking', 'worst', 'moment', 'can', 'remember', 'long', 'time', 'Anyway', 'back', 'movie', 'was', 'surprise', 'Mickey', 'gave', 'performance', 'career', 'Wrestler', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'movies', 'Wrestler', 'was', 'boldest', 'ever', 'was', 'truly', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'made', 'film', 'be', 'depressing', 'version', 'Rocky', 'was', 'also', 'pleased', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'performance', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'reality', 'Wrestler', 'was', 'surprised', 'director', 'wanted', 'tone', 'down', 'beauty', 'factor', 'hers', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'move', 'did', 'work', 'made', 'fit', 'movie', 'whole', 'standing', 'out', 'much', 'However', 'am', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'direction', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'deep', 'hoped', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'close-ups', 'gave', 'headache', 'preferred', 'camera', 'be', 'pulled', 'back', 'away', 'characters', 'Also', 'wanted', 'more', 'depth', 'Mickey', 'wanted', 'more', 'depth', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'there', 'was', 'enough', 'Wrestler', 'So', 'mainly', 'relied', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'guide', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'great', 'experience', 'really', 'took', 'craft', 'level', 'when', 'played', 'beat-down', 'wrestler', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'film', 'was', 'heart-wrenching', 'harrowing', 'watch', 'Ram', 'sink', 'new', 'lows', 'way', 'Wrestler', 'reminded', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'stories', 'were', 'quite', 'similar', 'self-degradation', 'main', 'characters', 'was', ""n't"", 'different', 'sense', 'Most', 'time', 'watching', 'Wrestler', 'kept', 'thinking', 'documentary', 'Jake', 'Snake', 'Roberts', 'how', 'similar', 'material', 'was', 'life', 'Wrestler', 'brought', 'out', 'best', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'finally', 'had', 'come', 'alive', 'two', 'decades', 'self-destruction', 'Hey', 'wanted', 'make', 'comment', 'stapler', 'scene', 'just', 'movie', 'see', 'wrestlers', 'had', 'stapled', 'other', 'course', 'fake', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'fake', 'instead', 'doing', 'real', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'intention', 'film', 'Anyway', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'crap.8/11', 'was', 'clear', '2009', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Show', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'got', 'robbed', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'film', 'mostly', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'Mickey', 'made', 'float', 'stay', 'buoyed', 'was', 'star', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'good', 'reason', 'Wrestler', 'was', 'film', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'Mickey', 'star', 'Anyone', 'did', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'WWF', 'counterparts', '80', '90', 'will', 'fondly', 'remember', 'names', 'wrestlers', 'legendary', 'matches', 'what', 'were', 'how', 'died', 'later', 'then', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'early', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'films', '80', 'early', '90', 'will', 'fondly', 'remember', 'what', 'enormous', 'talent', 'was', 'crash', 'burn', 'Combining', 'was', 'remarkable', 'comeback', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'justified', 'story', 'what', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'was', 'Mickey', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', '2009', 'way', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'film', 'guess', 'got', 'nod', 'nomination', 'appearing', 'naked', 'am', 'dropping', 'rating', 'film', '8', '7']",N/A

E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I was expecting the Wrestler to be a film focusing on the wrestling career of a character portrayed by Mickey Rourke, but instead, it's a story focusing on the LIFE of a wrestler portrayed by Mickey Rourke.Going into the movie, well, I've been a big wrestling fan for over 15 years now. Sometimes I watch wrestling on TV constantly (specifically WWE wrestling) other times I go through phases where I'd rather watch something else instead.However, despite how I may feel about wrestling at whatever moment in time, the one thing that never changes is the fact that I've personally cried when many wrestling stars have died at a young and unexpected age, because for years, I've been reading about everything these superstars have to go through in order to put on a show and entertain the fans. Everyone from Owen Hart, to Eddie Guerrero to the British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith.They will always be remembered by wrestling fans for their hard work and talent.  The Wrestler really focuses on the struggles of wrestlers who make a living by putting on entertaining shows.Mickey Rourke does an INCREDIBLE job showing us what sports entertainment wrestling is really like. Everything from the kind of shape these superstars have to be in on an everyday basis, to the way they bleed in the ring, to the way the wrestlers interact with each other before and during matches, to the way they sometimes DO take REAL damage when they smack either other (such as during those extreme matches that focus on tables, barbed wire, chairs, and other dangerous weapons)- this movie covers all the aspects of a wrestling superstars career.The film even covers what happens AFTER a wrestling match, and focuses on the condition these wrestlers are in when they return home.Without spoiling anything, I'm really surprised over the fact the film does NOT focus entirely on wrestling. Instead, the first 45 minutes show us some wrestling, then the next 45 minutes focus on Mickey Rourke's character and the people he interacts with (especially the woman in his life- a LOT of attention was given to this aspect of the storyline) and then the film finishes up with the wrestling aspect to end the movie.What is a bit on the disappointing side is the ending. It leaves a few questions unanswered, some of them BIG questions. Who knows what really happened after that final scene?Anyway, the movie probably deserves all those awards it won last year, because the movie has that distinct quality about it that makes the general population really appreciate the time and work that went into it.

I thought the film was a great character study, specifically about a broken man who has made a lot of mistakes in his life, but who loves what he does, even though it is basically killing him and ruining him.  The movie is filled with phenomenal acting and Rourke certainly deserved his Oscar Nomination and Golden Globe win for Best Actor.  And I think Marisa Tomei earned the respect of those who doubted her for winning Best Supporting Actress in My Cousin Vinny (1992).  I must admit, as much as I love My Cousin Vinny, I too am still surprised at her Oscar win for that performance.  I still remember being completely shocked when they announced her name as the winner at that Oscar telecast.  The only other shock that surprised me more at the Oscars is when Saving Private Ryan (1998) lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare In Love (1998).

1237110,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001TOD92C,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","Known more for his visual appeal along with intriguing stories, director/writer/producer Darren Aronofsky shows a different, and perhaps better, side of his mastery in storytelling.I first became aware of Aronofsky after seeing his impressive Requiem for a Dream back in 2000. Engulfed in that film's unique visual telling, I moved on six years later to see The Fountain. Extraordinary in just about every way, especially the special effects and how he integrated them into the plot, I then went out and tried to find everything I could by this unique man. What I found was very little. A few minor productions prior to 2000, Aronofsky is an enigma; he's not out there making a movie every eight months like some directors.So when I heard praise being heaped upon THE WRESTLER, it was with great surprise that I found out Aronofsky was both producer and director. I wasn't surprised because it was him, but because the story just didn't sound like something he'd do. I mean, where's the visual appeal in the story of a washed-up pro wrestler? Time for me to eat some crow...The visual appeal isn't there but doesn't need to be. This is a myopic view that focuses its entire lens on that of one man, and does it so powerfully, with such an amazing story, that fans of such things as Rocky, Raging Bull and Brian's Song would be proud to rank it among their favorite sports-related films of all time; it's in my top five.Much of the excitement has been directed at returning film star Mickey Rourke. Returning, you ask? Where had he been? Strangely appropriate, Rourke had taken a hiatus from acting and returned to one of his earlier loves: boxing. From 1991 to 1995, Rourke had become a professional boxer and won a string of matches. But he also received some crushing facial injuries that required reconstructive surgery. These injuries are still noticeable in The Wrestler, but they also give the filming of Rourke's face a unique appeal since we're talking about that of a spiraling down wrestler who's failing body can't keep up.Wearing hearing aids, reading glasses, and having to work at a supermarket in order to make ends meet, Randy `The Ram' Robinson (Rourke) is discovering what lay ahead for him, a previously successful wrestler with a fan following that's dying off ...kind of like himself.Beside `The Ram' is a stripper who's also on her downward swing. Getting older and nudged aside by younger, prettier strippers, Cassidy (Marissa Tomei, Wild Hogs) spurns The Ram's romantic advances. She still feels like she's got some stripper time left in her, even though the clientele where she works seems to say different. The power with which Tomei pulls her battered, sex-object body around only to learn that she needs something more than a pole to dance around is incredible to watch. But can Cassidy learn that The Ram's love for her is something she needs before it's too late? This is where the crux of the story really pulls the viewer in and holds us to the very, very end.The side story of The Ram's estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood, Across the Universe) also adds a very human quality to the main character, and gives us more of the in-depth character analysis so many films lack. It also reinforced The Ram's loneliness in a world where aging sports figures learn of their early mistakes, and that trying to make amends often results in old habits cropping up and destroying any such possibilities.Finally, I have to mention the gritty film style that Aronofsky chose for The Wrestler. Hand held camera's and grainy looking film stock all added to a years-gone-by feel that was very appropriate. It also saved a ton of cash. In fact, The Wrestler cost only $7 million to make but has, apparently, made over $70 million as of this writing. The shocking fact for me is not that it's made back ten times what it cost to make, but that Aronofsky did it without any significant special effects like he used in The Fountain (cost = $35 million to make), proving that this director has the potential to make just about any film, under any circumstances, with minimal expenditures. Although this information may not be terribly interesting to movie-goers, I find this extremely admirable considering the multi-gazillion dollar films that get greenlit and then flop at the box office.Aronofsky is the man. And he's got a resume to be proud of, too. And The Wrestler should rank high on his list. It should rank high on yours, too. See it for Rourke's performance.

Clearly, the man had neglected his life and loves outside of his work during his glory days, and now wishes he had not neglected the ones that needed him most.The film is layered on top of that, with all sorts of comparisons to modern America, the sacrifices and humiliations people go through to support themselves and their families, the end of the American family unit, and even how people fuel the self-destructive tendencies of their fellow man.Whether you are a fan of professional wrestling or not, I highly recommend this movie.",5,A glorious example of American filmmaking...,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,808,"['Wrestler', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'films', 'made', 'recent', 'years', 'movie', 'might', 'come', 'only', 'enjoyed', 'niche', 'audience', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'that.The', 'film', 'fantastic', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'sport', ""n't"", 'love', 'back', 'Clearly', 'man', 'had', 'neglected', 'life', 'loves', 'work', 'glory', 'days', 'now', 'had', 'not', 'neglected', 'ones', 'needed', 'most.The', 'film', 'layered', 'top', 'sorts', 'comparisons', 'modern', 'America', 'sacrifices', 'humiliations', 'people', 'go', 'support', 'families', 'end', 'American', 'family', 'unit', 'even', 'how', 'people', 'fuel', 'self-destructive', 'tendencies', 'fellow', 'man.Whether', 'are', 'fan', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'not', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

Like the main character here, Rourke was on his last acting legs when he made this hit, and it brought him back from the dead. All the blood is disturbing for those who are squeamish, like me, but the artistry here somewhat justifies the gore. Marisa Tomei is great as the stripper he falls for. The daughter role is also well done. But Rourke carries this thing, and his face and body are riveting to see.

1237114,A1M181I8IYDLDA,B001TOD92C,Brandon Cozart,"[1, 3]","It's not often that near-perfect movies are made.  Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is a near-perfect movie.  In somewhat of a departure from his earlier films (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain), Aronofsky offers a glimpse into the life of an aging pro-wrestler, a glimpse so real and human that the line between fiction and documentary is hard to discern.The Wrestler tells the story of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a former professional wrestling superstar still trying to hold on to the glory days of the 1980s.  His fame in the 80s, however, came at a price.  He alienated his daughter, put his body through hell, filled it with poison, and now lives in a trailer park as he struggles to keep on living while still feeding his old addictions.  ""The Ram's"" only friend is a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), also an aging ""star"" in her profession trying to survive in a culture that increasingly rejects her.Though the story is a bit clich&eacute;, reminiscent of the last couple installments of the Rocky franchise, it's never been told quite like this.  With Rocky, the audience knows the outcome ahead of time.  The Wrestler keeps us guessing until the final credits start to roll.  Along the way the audience is taken on the ups and downs that Randy ""The Ram"" experiences as he tries to find life outside the ring.The uniqueness of this film comes through the parallels between Randy and Cassidy.  Again, both are aging stars in industries that value youth and vitality.  Both live double lives.  Both exploit their bodies so they can feel loved and wanted.  Both are empty and lonely looking for fulfillment and rescue from their lives as they are.  But neither really knows how to go about finding that fulfillment and rescue.  Randy tries to hold blue collar jobs at a local grocer, first unloading trucks then working behind the meat counter, but the appreciation he is given there, or isn't given, simply does not compare to the thrills of screaming fans and chants of ""Ram Jam, Ram Jam.""  Cassidy is trying to earn and save enough money to buy a new condo, leaving the club and the adult industry behind in order to better provide for and take care of her growing son.  She remains bound, however, to the club and the need to feel wanted by the men she dances for.The brilliance of this film is the simultaneous juxtaposition of these two characters.  Each represents the redemption of the other, but in order to reach that point they must be united together.  After the big crisis event of the story, there are brief glimmers of hope that they understand this and they begin moving toward that point.  As their relationship grows deeper they struggle with facing new categories.  Are they still dancer/customer?  Are they friends?  Can they be more than friends?  Cassidy helps Randy try to salvage a relationship with his daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), Randy gives Cassidy a Randy ""The Ram"" action figure to give to her son, and both of their lives seem to be coming together nicely.  Sure there are the normal growing pains of any budding romance including harsh words and hurt, but there are also moments of sweetness and connection that make the trials of relationship vanish in an instant.The film reaches its climax when these two ""broken down piece[s] of meat,"" as Randy describes himself, must make the decision between the two lives that each lead.  Will Cassidy give up dancing and live the rest of her life as Pam (her real name)?  Will Randy ""The Ram"" leave the brutal world of professional wrestling and accept that Robin Ramzinski is who he really is?  The cost for both Randy and Cassidy is the sacrificing of a significant part of who they are and who they have been for years, but the reward for such a redemptive sacrifice is the beginning of a new life together, a life which will bring the true love and fulfillment that each are looking for.Without giving away the ending, I will simply say that the way in which the story resolves is quite striking and further solidifies this film as an incredible piece of art.  The Wrestler is a very remarkable film that deserved all (and more!) of the award nominations it received this year.Video/AudioThe video on the Blu-ray release of this film is quite good, presented in anamorphic 2:35.  Originally shot in 16mm, the picture has a washed-out, grainy feel to it, but this was a deliberate move by the filmmakers to give it more of a documentary look and feel.  The audio is also done very well, presented in 5.1 DTS.  The hair metal music used throughout the film is pulse-pounding, and the crowds of the wrestling matches surround you, making you feel as if you are actually there watching the show.Special FeaturesThe special features for this release are somewhat disappointing, simply because there aren't that many.  There is a music video for the Bruce Springsteen song, ""The Wrestler"" (how was this not nominated for a Best Song Oscar??), and two featurettes looking behind the scenes at the professional wrestling industry.  The Blu-ray release also includes a digital copy of the film on a second disc.  That's all there is, however.  It would have been nice for deleted scenes or a feature-length commentary to have been included.",5,near-perfect,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,5251,"['not', 'often', 'near-perfect', 'movies', 'are',

1237118,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001TOD92C,Caleb Williams,"[3, 3]","For those of you who have seen the classic wrestling documentary ""Beyond The Mat"" in which it feature Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts heavily, there is no doubt that Darren Aronofsky will have drawn some inspiration from this real life tragic figure. To those who have already seen this spectacular film, you will recognise the parallels between ""The Wrestlers"" main character and Jake. Mickey Rourke can also be compared to the character in regards to his personal life as he tends to get himself into trouble a lot of times with the law and in his relationships.The Plot: Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is an aged professional wrestler and personal trainwreck with his finger constantly on the self destruct button. He was once the biggest name in wrestling with his biggest match taking place in Madison Square Garden against the Ayatollah 20 years prior to this movies setting. You would think that considering his possible legend status that he would be one of the richest men in the business, in fact he seems to be one of the poorest and the most run down.Living in a trailer park and having stripper being the only person he considers a friend he's pretty much the lowest he can be. Taking part in independent shows to make a quick dollar so he can pay for his drug habit and keep his trailer, he's pushing his body to the absolute limit. One night after taking part in a CZW (Combat Zone Wrestling) event, which is pretty much the hardest of hardcore wrestling he collapses and has a heart attack.Waking up in a hospital and finding out he is just had a heart triple bypass he is told that he can no longer wrestle for the strain would destroy his heart and kill him. Being a man that lives for wrestling he finds this change hard to cope with especially being so lonely. He first tries to seek companionship with his stripper friend and tries to reconcile his relationship with his daughter.The Actors: One thing I will say to praise this film above anything else is its authenticity. Being a fan of independent wrestling, I'm more aware of the backstage trials and tribulations of our more failed wrestlers. Being more aware of how the backstage antics work in the real world of wrestling, I expected this to play agaist this film due to me not expecting it to be truly accurate and quite corny in some respects.I was sorely mistaken and the autenticity of this film is spot on especially with its portrayal of the backstage wrestling world. Mickey Rourke is one of those actors who has a name we all recognise but we're not really sure what he looks like or what movies he's been in. Well that was the case for me anyway, however, this is undoubtedly the film that will put a face to the name and have it stick forever.The daughter role of Stephanie played by Evan Rachel Wood is another highlight of the film considering her small part played. The real Gem of it is Cassidy the stripper played by Marisa Tomei who is one that gains Randys friendship through simply doing her job. What started off as a professional friendship grows into much more as the film develops and randys life falls apart. Mickey is the shining light of this movie for 2009 and should get an oscar nomination for such a stellar performance. He seems to lay it all out there and in his wrestling scenes seems to take part without holding back an ounce.Overall the film is superb, being a wrestling fan I especially enjoyed the wrestling scenes which were filmed at actual live WXW, CZW and Ring of Honor events. Mickeys acting seems to exceed all expectations and the film contained some genuinely heart wrenching moments, especially when he first tries to win back his daughter.I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it to anyone who is not just a fan of wrestling, but a fan of movies. A fan of drama movies would suffice to be educated by such an immensely enjoyable picture. Be prepared to be a bit shocked and disturbed by some of the graphic depictions within. Either way, upon its nationwide American release or its world wide release, you must make sure you see this film.",5,The Ultimate Movie Tragedy Shown Through A Wrestlers Eyes,1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,4072,"['who', 'have', 'seen', 'classic', 'wrestling', 'documentary', 'Mat', 'feature', 'Jake', 'Snake', 'Roberts', 'heavily', 'doubt', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'will', 'have', 'drawn', 'inspiration', 'real', 'life', 'tragic', 'figure', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'spectacular', 'film', 'will', 'recognise', 'parallels', 'Wrestlers', 'main', 'character', 'Jake', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'compared', 'character', 'regards', 'personal', 'life', 'get', 'trouble', 'lot', 'times', 'law', 'relationships.The', 'Plot', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'aged', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'personal', 'trainwreck', 'finger', 'constantly', 'self', 'destruct', 'button', 'was', 'once', 'biggest', 'name', 'wrestling', 'biggest', 'match', 'taking', 'place', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'Ayatollah', '20', 'years', 'prior', 'movies', 'setting', 'would', 'think', 'considering', 'possible', 'legend', 'status', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'richest', 'men', 'business', 'fact', 'be', 'one', 'poorest', 'most', 'run', 'down.Living', 'trailer', 'park', 'having', 'stripper', 'being', 'only', 'person', 'friend', 'pretty', 'much', 'lowest', 'can', 'be', 'Taking', 'part', 'independent', 'shows', 'make', 'quick', 'dollar', 'can', 'pay', 'drug', 'habit', 'keep', 'trailer', 'pushing', 'body', 'absolute', 'limit', 'One', 'night', 'taking', 'part', 'CZW', 'Combat', 'Zone', 'Wrestling', 'event', 'pretty', 'much', 'hardest', 'hardcore', 'wrestling', 'heart', 'attack.Waking', 'up', 'hospital', 'finding', 'out', 'just', 'had', 'heart', 'triple', 'bypass', 'told', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'wrestle', 'strain', 'would', 'destroy', 'heart', 'kill', 'Being', 'man', 'wrestling', 'change', 'hard', 'cope', 'especially', 'being', 'so', 'lonely', 'first', 'seek', 'companionship', 'stripper', 'friend', 'tries', 'reconcile', 'relationship', 'daughter.The', 'Actors', 'One', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'praise', 'film', 'anything', 'else', 'authenticity', 'Being', 'fan', 'independent', 'wrestling', ""'m"", 'more', 'aware', 'backstage', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'more', 'failed', 'wrestlers', 'Being', 'more', 'aware', 'how', 'backstage', 'antics', 'work', 'real', 'world', 'wrestling', 'expected', 'play', 'agaist', 'film', 'due', 'not', 'expecting', 'be', 'truly', 'accurate', 'quite', 'corny', 'respects.I', 'was', 'sorely', 'mistaken', 'autenticity', 'film', 'spot', 'especially', 'portrayal', 'backstage', 'wrestling', 'world', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'name', 'recognise', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'what', 'movies', 'been', 'Well', 'was', 'case', 'anyway', 'however', 'undoubtedly', 'film', 'will', 'put', 'face', 'name', 'have', 'forever.The', 'daughter', 'role', 'Stephanie', 'played', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'highlight', 'film', 'considering', 'small', 'part', 'played', 'real', 'Gem', 'Cassidy', 'stripper', 'played', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'who', 'one', 'gains', 'Randys', 'friendship', 'simply', 'doing', 'job', 'What', 'started', 'off', 'professional', 'friendship', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'randys', 'life', 'apart', 'Mickey', 'shining', 'light', 'movie', '2009', 'should', 'get', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'stellar', 'performance', 'lay', 'there', 'wrestling', 'scenes', 'take', 'part', 'holding', 'back', 'ounce.Overall', 'film', 'superb', 'being', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'wrestling', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'actual', 'live', 'WXW', 'CZW', 'Ring', 'Honor', 'events', 'Mickeys', 'acting', 'exceed', 'expectations', 'film', 'contained', 'genuinely', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'moments', 'especially', 'when', 'first', 'win', 'back', 'daughter.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'fan', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'movies', 'fan', 'drama', 'movies', 'would', 'suffice', 'be', 'educated', 'such', 'immensely', 'enjoyable', 'picture', 'Be', 'prepared', 'be', 'bit', 'shocked', 'disturbed', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'way', 'nationwide', 'American', 'release', 'world', 'wide', 'release', 'must', 'make', 'sure', 'see', 'film']",N/A
1237119,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B001TOD92C,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","Mickey Rourke has had at least three careers:  one as an actor, one as a screenwriter, and one as a boxer.  I have no idea about his skill level with regards to the second two in the list, but I do know that he's always been a very strong actor.  And he surely didn't fail here.He gives a very raw but solid performance in ""The Wrestler,"" and I wonder how autobiographical that role really is.  But it's almost as if you can really see the pain in his face from the abuse that he's taken over the years, and it is made especially real by the use of handheld cameras.  As a matter of fact, it seems that most of the shots in the film were used through this method.And of course Marissa Tomei shows once again that she was no fluke as an Academy Award-winning actress.  And yes, she did win that award for ""My Cousin Vinny,"" one that she surely deserved.  Personally, I've always thought that a lot of women don't like her because she's not only pretty -- OK, she's a babe -- but she's even a better actress.  I'm sure that there's a lot of jealousy going on there.  But in reality, have you ever seen her give a bad performance?  No, you haven't, as it just never happens.  And she proves me right once again in this film.I like how this film shows what happens to people over time, how their careers and life aspirations are affected by not only age but health.  Most 20-somethings think that they will be able to work forever, but in reality, it just doesn't happen.  Father Time's hands will follow you, and those same hands will eventually strike midnight.  Happens to everybody.And it should have happened in real life to Mr. Rourke.  But the interesting thing is, he doesn't give up -- neither here nor in reality -- and his career never seems to give up on him.  He seems to still be going strong, even though he's in his 60s now, and I believe that he's still acting.  Not only has his face taken an unfair beating over his life, but his psyche probably has as well; peeking around the web, it seems that he's everyone's kicking boy du jour.

1237120,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B001TOD92C,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[1, 1]","I've been a Mickey Rourke fan during his whole acting career.  He's done some amazing acting jobs over the decades, from small roles to big, from leading man handsome to not good looking at all. This story of a aging wrestler who has seen better days, who is going to die if he doesn't quit wrestling (due to a medical condition), is an interesting story.  However, it is not an electrifying story.  Rourke is the best thing in the movie.  He is the movie, in fact, from beginning to end.  This character is not all that far from the personal journey that Rourke himself has been making in life.  Both the character and the actor have been considerably battered by life and made some very bad decisions along the way.  They paid some big price tags for those mistakes too.  The wrestler tries to connect with his daughter but he has been such a negligent father that he can't get that off the ground.  He has the beginnings of a girlfriend in a stripper, played by Marisa Tomei.  However, he can't sustain anything so they are sort of off again and on again.  He tries to give up wrestling but it is all he knows.  This almost played like a documentary instead of a feature film.  However, the story needed some oomph to it.  I found myself getting bored and restless in various parts of it.  I could see where it was going and wanted it to get there already.  I can't fault the acting but the script needed work, the directing needed more panache. Darren Aronofsky is usually better on delivering more oomph and panache in those departments, as he was with ""The Fountain"" (2006) and ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000).",4,I LIKED THE WRESTLER BUT I DIDN'T LOVE IT,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,1613,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'fan', 'whole', 'acting', 'career', 'done', 'amazing', 'acting', 'jobs', 'decades', 'small', 'roles', 'big', 'leading', 'man', 'handsome', 'not', 'good', 'looking', 'story', 'aging', 'wrestler', 'who', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'who', 'going', 'die', ""n't"", 'quit', 'wrestling', 'due', 'medical', 'condition', 'interesting', 'story', 'However', 'not', 'electrifying', 'story', 'Rourke', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'movie', 'fact', 'beginning', 'end', 'character', 'not', 'far', 'personal', 'journey', 'Rourke', 'been', 'making', 'life', 'character', 'actor', 'have', 'been', 'considerably', 'battered', 'life', 'made', 'very', 'bad', 'decisions', 'way', 'paid', 'big', 'price', 'tags', 'mistakes', 'too', 'wrestler', 'connect', 'daughter', 'been', 'negligent', 'father', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'beginnings', 'girlfriend', 'stripper', 'played', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sustain', 'anything', 'are', 'sort', 'off', 'again', 'again', 'give', 'up', 'wrestling', 'all', 'almost', 'played', 'documentary', 'instead', 'feature', 'film', 'However', 'story', 'needed', 'oomph', 'found', 'getting', 'bored', 'restless', 'various', 'parts', 'could', 'see', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'wanted', 'get', 'there', 'already', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'acting', 'script', 'needed', 'work', 'directing', 'needed', 'more', 'panache', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'usually', 'better', 'delivering', 'more', 'oomph', 'panache', 'departments', 'was', 'Fountain', '2006', 'Requiem', 'Dream', '2000']",N/A
1237121,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B001TOD92C,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 1]","The Wrestler works for me on many different levels. I like how it subverts the standard story formula. Normally in a story about an aging warrior he fights on in spite of his age or other obstacles and ultimately triumphs once again. You are rooting for the underdog to pull off one more victory, with the idea that he can now retire, resting on his laurels, and live happily ever after. The Wrestler looks like it is taking this route, but pulls a detour. In fact, midway through, you are already rooting for him to just retire gracefully. If only he could win back the love of his daughter, win the heart of his stripper girlfriend, and accept his role behind the deli meat counter all would be well.--------------Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: What can I get for you, good-lookin'?Man at Deli Counter: Half pound of egg salad.Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: HALF POUND OF EGG SALAD, COMIN' UP!Man at Deli Counter: Is it fresh?Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: Fresh? Fresh as monkey's breath, brother!=====================After his heart attack, to continue his wrestling career is suicide. But what is he without wrestling? Now it is his ego and vanity that he must defeat. But would winning that battle just be another way of losing?The theme of The Wrestler echoes ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"" by Dylan Thomas:Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,Do not go gentle into that good night.Marisa Tomei plays Pam, who dances under the name of Cassidy. I love how Cassidy/Pam has problems that parallel Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson's. She is also at a transition in life, getting a little old to still be stripping, and it is time for her to retire gracefully as well. The interactions between the two are quite poignant in spite of the crass setting. They are on the verge of making some kind of emotional connection, but can't quite cross over.Mickey Rourke's acting career also holds many parallels to his character's wrestling career:--------------Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: I just want to say to you all tonight I'm very grateful to be here. A lot of people told me that I'd never wrestle again and that's all I do. You know, if you live hard and play hard and you burn the candle at both ends, you pay the price for it. You know in this life you can loose everything you love, everything that loves you. Now I don't hear as good as I used to and I forget stuff and I aint as pretty as I used to be but ****  I'm still standing here and I'm The Ram. As times goes by, as times goes by, they say ""he's washed up"", ""he's finished"" , ""he's a loser"", ""he's all through"". You know what? The only one that's going to tell me when I'm through doing my thing is you people here.============A lot of scenes in The Wrestler are sad and pathetic, like the ill attended autograph signing event where the wrestlers easily outnumber the fans. There are also unexpected moments of tenderness, such as the backstage affection between the villains and heroes, or in the parlance of wrestling, the ""faces"" and the ""heels.""--------------Necro Butcher: Are you cool with the staples?Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: Staples?Necro Butcher: Staple gun... Not so bad on the way in, except it's a little scary, you know - you got this metal thing pressed up against you. Gonna leave some marks, have to deal with a little blood loss.=================================Though wrestling tells a very simple story over and over--heels fight faces but the faces always win--the film tells a very complex story where you aren't sure who are the faces and who are the heels, and even winning and losing isn't so easy to define. Mickey Rourke used the material here to its fullest, giving perhaps the best performance of his career. Marisa Tomei gave Rourke great support, and her performance was also Oscar worthy. Evan Rachael Wood, as the angry daughter, was also commendable, as were all the rest of the cast, crew, and the director and author.Perhaps Stephanie, the angry daughter played by Evan Rachael Wood, is trying or should be trying to say something similar to Dylan Thomas:And you, my father, there on the sad height,Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.Do not go gentle into that good night.Rage, rage against the dying of the light.SELECTED FILMOGRAPHY OF MICKEY ROURKEMasked and Anonymous(2003) ....

1237123,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B001TOD92C,Charles Ashbacher,"[2, 2]","This is an excellent movie, while it does help if you know the professional wrestling genre and some of the tactics used in the ring, you can enjoy it even if you don't know a thing about how the professional wrestling game is played. Mickey Rourke stars as an aging professional wrestler (Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson), with a hearing aid in one ear and an old person's reading glasses on his face. It was clear why Rourke won awards for the role, including an Oscar nomination for best actor, he gives a stellar performance as a man well past his prime in a young man's game, struggling to survive and maintain a reasonable life.There are also two strong and lengthy supporting roles, Evan Rachel Wood plays his estranged daughter that the Ram is trying to reconnect with. After first rejecting Robinson, the Wood character finds common ground and they begin to reconnect, only to have it fall through. Marisa Tomei is superb as a stripper that the Ram visits on a regular basis. She has a young boy and wants to get out of the life as an exotic dancer at a bar, but Robinson is not what a woman would consider to be a good prospect.You find yourself rooting for the Ram to get his life together after he has a near heart attack, but he is not well suited for anything other than the controlled mayhem of the ring. After all else fails, Robinson decides to engage in one last bout, a re-enactment of his most famous bout, with an opponent called ""the Ayatollah.""Some of the best scenes are when the wrestlers are in the makeshift dressing room before the matches, talking about their confrontations and what they are going to do. There is a lot of pseudo and real blood displayed, there is a saying in professional wrestling, ""red is green."" The men that get beat up like that for a living are rough and tough, but also in later years, beaten and broken. As the special feature points out, there really is no place else to go for the aging professional wrestler but to get beat up for a couple hundred dollars.This movie was made for the paltry amount of $7 million, yet it has all the power of a big budget studio production. At times it is gross, yet you feel for the three broken people, all trying to believe in each other, yet not really being able to deliver. Robinson sums it up well when he waves his hand at the wrestling crowd and says, ""Those people are my family.""",5,A great movie about a man broken in so many ways,1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,2374,"['excellent', 'movie', 'help', 'know', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'genre', 'tactics', 'used', 'ring', 'can', 'enjoy', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'thing', 'how', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'game', 'played', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'aging', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'hearing', 'aid', 'one', 'ear', 'old', 'person', 'reading', 'glasses', 'face', 'was', 'clear', 'why', 'Rourke', 'won', 'awards', 'role', 'including', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'best', 'actor', 'stellar', 'performance', 'man', 'well', 'prime', 'young', 'man', 'game', 'struggling', 'survive', 'maintain', 'reasonable', 'life.There', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'strong', 'lengthy', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Ram', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'first', 'rejecting', 'Robinson', 'Wood', 'character', 'common', 'ground', 'begin', 'reconnect', 'only', 'have', 'fall', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'superb', 'stripper', 'Ram', 'visits', 'regular', 'basis', 'young', 'boy', 'get', 'life', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'bar', 'Robinson', 'not', 'what', 'woman', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'good', 'prospect.You', 'find', 'rooting', 'Ram', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'near', 'heart', 'attack', 'not', 'well', 'suited', 'anything', 'other', 'controlled', 'mayhem', 'ring', 'else', 'Robinson', 'engage', 'one', 'last', 'bout', 're-enactment', 'most', 'famous', 'bout', 'opponent', 'called', 'Ayatollah', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'wrestlers', 'are', 'makeshift', 'dressing', 'room', 'matches', 'talking', 'confrontations', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'lot', 'pseudo', 'real', 'blood', 'displayed', 'saying', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'red', 'green', 'men', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'living', 'are', 'rough', 'tough', 'also', 'later', 'years', 'beaten', 'broken', 'special', 'feature', 'points', 'out', 'really', 'place', 'else', 'go', 'aging', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'couple', 'hundred', 'dollars.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'paltry', 'amount', '7', 'million', 'power', 'big', 'budget', 'studio', 'production', 'times', 'gross', 'yet', 'feel', 'three', 'broken', 'people', 'trying', 'believe', 'other', 'yet', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'able', 'deliver', 'Robinson', 'sums', 'up', 'well', 'when', 'hand', 'wrestling', 'crowd', 'people', 'are', 'family']",N/A

They are similar in some ways, both having jobs based on using their bodies. But, while Cassidy longs for a life of normalcy, Randy is still striving to return to his former ""greatness"". Randy also attempts to re-connect with his estranged daughter, Stephanie. But, after a childhood full of broken promises, she is reluctant to allow him back into her life.After a heart attack, Randy attempts to retire from wrestling and work a regular job at a deli counter. But his self-esteem is so tied up with being ""The Ram"" he can't accept just being an ordinary guy living a mundane existence. So he returns for a special 20th anniversary match with his arch enemy from the 80's, a heel named the Ayatollah.The best parts of this movie were the compelling scenes involving Randy and Cassidy. Both Rourke and Tomei deserve Oscars for their top notch performances. The wrestling matches were also well done and intense. Clearly the director, Darren Aronofsky, knows the wrestling biz and the  inclusion of numerous actual wrestlers made the movie seem more gritty and realistic. But the plot itself is rather basic, essentially it's the character study of a man so obsessed with his former glory that he is willing to kill himself to get back in the limelight. It's a well made movie for what it is. But the story is not quite on the same level as the acting and therefore a little disappointing based on my very high expectations.",4,"Chasing After ""Glory Days"" Gone By",1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,1653,"['Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'well', 'prime', 'wrestler', 'was', 'big', 'star', '80', 'now', 'body', 'breaking', 'down', 'stuck', 'doing', 'small', 'shows', 'pocket', 'money', 'only', 'friend', 'aging', 'stripper', 'named', 'Cassidy', 'are', 'similar', 'ways', 'having', 'jobs', 'based', 'using', 'bodies', 'Cassidy', 'longs', 'life', 'normalcy', 'Randy', 'still', 'striving', 'return', 'former', 'greatness', 'Randy', 'also', 're-connect', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'childhood', 'full', 'broken', 'promises', 'reluctant', 'allow', 'back', 'life.After', 'heart', 'attack', 'Randy', 'retire', 'wrestling', 'work', 'regular', 'job', 'deli', 'counter', 'self-esteem', 'so', 'tied', 'up', 'being', 'Ram', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'just', 'being', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'living', 'mundane', 'existence', 'special', '20th', 'anniversary', 'match', 'arch', 'enemy', '80', 'heel', 'named', 'Ayatollah.The', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Randy', 'Cassidy', 'Rourke', 'Tomei', 'deserve', 'Oscars', 'top', 'notch', 'performances', 'wrestling', 'matches', 'were', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'intense', 'Clearly', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'wrestling', 'biz', 'inclusion', 'numerous', 'actual', 'wrestlers', 'made', 'movie', 'seem', 'more', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'plot', 'rather', 'basic', 'essentially', 'character', 'study', 'man', 'so', 'obsessed', 'former', 'glory', 'willing', 'kill', 'get', 'back', 'limelight', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'what', 'story', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'level', 'acting', 'therefore', 'little', 'disappointing', 'based', 'very', 'high', 'expectations']",N/A
1237127,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001TOD92C,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 3]","""The Wrestler"" is wise and heartbreaking in its examination of resilient life patterns. It tells the simple but deep story of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), an aging professional wrestler who doesn't seem to care that he's past his prime. Or maybe he cares so much that he clings to a former life, one he can never get back no matter how hard he tries. Whatever the case, all Randy knows is that he belongs in a wrestling ring. What a fascinating film, so masterful in its character development, so beautiful in its structural and visual simplicity, so sad in its assertion that old habits die hard. It's a wonderful turn for director Darren Aronofsky, who left me hopelessly confused with his nonsensical previous film, ""The Fountain;"" instead of an incomprehensible plot buried under mounds of visual effects, he gives us a real story with characters we can actually care about.What's most interesting about this movie is the attention paid to smaller details, such as the surprising amount of time a wrestler spends maintaining his image. Never mind the weightlifting and the steroid use--trips to tanning and hair salons are part of the regiment, as is the shaving of body hair. Randy does all of this, yet we know he's doing it out of desperation than out of vanity. I'm reminded of ""Bigger, Stronger, Faster*: *The Side Effects of Being American,"" a 2008 documentary that examined steroid use among professional athletes. As director Christopher Bell tells us, Americans are obsessed with heroes, and as such, heroes must always be victorious. But what if victory depends on creating a faade, one that impressionable viewers are unable to look behind? There's a scene in ""The Wrestler"" when, just before a match, Randy hides a broken razor blade within the tape around his wrist; when his opponent slams him to the ground, he discretely removes the blade and cuts his forehead, making it look like the match has been rough on him. The phoniness of that moment is second only to the knowledge that the matches are scripted, along with the rivalries between the wrestlers.The problems stem from the fact that Randy isn't acknowledging the stress his aging body is under. It mostly has to do with his heart, which threatens to give out after an especially shocking wrestling match, one that involved barbed wire, staples, and a lot of blood. (At what point did wrestling become a sadistic geek show?) After waking up in a hospital bed, he's informed that he's had bypass surgery. He's also warned that he must give up on professional wrestling if he wants to stay alive. Adjusting to this new life will not be easy, and we know this because two very difficult relationships take center stage. One is with his estranged daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood); Randy knows that he was a terrible father, and he admits to thinking his career was more important than being there for his family. They try to make the best of the situation, although there's a sense that their relationship is broken beyond repair.The other relationship is with an aging stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), who probably has more in common with Randy than with anyone else. She too may be past her prime, and yet she finds comfort in the consistency of her job. At first, she's merely on friendly terms with Randy. But as the film progresses, it's obvious that she's falling in love. There's a sadness to this character I found very compelling; she's good at what she does, but she seems unwilling to try for anything more. And even though she's always friendly around Randy, she always puts up a wall, as if she were purposely maintaining a sexy image to drive him away. If she lets him see the real her--fully clothed and with no fancy makeup or hair--he might actually see a person there and want to get to know her.One of the more creative aspects of ""The Wrestler"" is the way Aronofsky follows Rourke around with a camera, making it seem like he's filming a documentary about a former wrestler. It adds a personal touch that serves the story well, making it about character instead of about visual appeal. There are also numerous camera angels that reveal sadness without being explicit. Example: When Randy appears at an autograph signing, he looks around the room and sees a slew of other over-the-hill wrestlers, some with canes, others in wheelchairs. But Aronofsky doesn't linger on any specific shot, opting instead to keep things short and to the point.Other moments reveal just how desperately Randy clings to the past. Consider a scene in which he and a neighborhood boy play a video game on the original eight-bit Nintendo system: The boy clearly can't identify with what he's playing because he describes a new game called ""Call of Duty,"" and he makes a point of saying that it's based on the Iraq War. And then there are a few scenes in a supermarket, where Randy has taken a job at the deli counter: While the first scene shows his attempt to make the most of it, the second one reveals his desperation to once again be in a wrestling ring. How interesting that he feels more comfortable performing for an audience than participating in real life--his true feelings come out in his final speech, which is both compelling and sad at the same time. ""The Wrestler"" is a wonderful film, perfectly cast, well written, and engaging as a probing character study.",4,Down for the Count,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,5366,"['Wrestler', 'wise',

He spends the movie just trying to get by until he get into the ring again, where he comes alive and exists as a person.The direction is decent and the writing is good. It's quite fun seeing some of the ""behind-the-scenes"" stuff with the various wrestlers as they plan out their moves in an effort to keep it all as safe as possible.As I said, it's not anything special, except that Mickey Rourke's performance is truly mind-blowing.

A bit to depressing for real life, but I guess some people make choices that they can never return from.

Perhaps the worst thing is the film is the nearly unreadable font of the opening credits, but after that, it's all excelsior. It's small moments remind me of The Jimmy Show, a terrific, and similarly unsentimental, 2001 film that got as much indifference as this film got hype. Both films are unafraid to show life's unpretty side, but neither film buys into the false heroics of Hollywood endings, nor the false travails of more melodramatic `indy' films. It also piques one to envision what a truly adult film by the hit and miss director Kevin Smith would be like, since his films are all set in New Jersey, with blue collar folk, as well.Randy `The Ram' Ramzinsky is what his daughter claims, a screw-up. But, he realizes it. So many of the characters in films, and people in real life, delude themselves into thinking they are things they are not. And it is this sort of strength that makes the film an `adult' film, not Tomei's nudity (watch the scene where Randy heads down from the supermarket bathroom to enter the deli box, pauses, with the blare of a pro wrestling entrance theme playing, breathes, then enters to the silence of mundane work). More of this is needed. Perhaps Darren Aronofsky, if he's learnt the lessons of this film, can pick up the gauntlet that John Cassavetes tossed down a few decades ago, but which remains on American cinema's floor. If not, at least here's hoping he does not return to his earlier ways. If, instead of navel gazing masturbatory philosophy, a dose of blue collar realism (and no sport is more blue collar than pro wrestling) can work wonders for an artist like Aronofsky, imagine what it can do for the blue collars that watch it.

The same goes for the film.The film was shocking to me: For instance, it was a shock seeing Rourke -""Randy The Ram"" -  with the long, flowing blond hair and rippling muscles. Hey, it's not that the former real-life boxer was ever in bad shape, but he never had muscles like this either. The man must have pumped a lot of iron to get ready for this role as an aging wrestler.Another shock was seeing Marisa Tomei, of ""My Cousin Vinny"" fame, naked - and in that state in more than one scene. She didn't leave much to the imagination as ""Cassidy.""A third shock was seeing some of the early wrestling scenes. Yeah, pro wrestling is rough stuff and it's bloody and it's fake, etc., but the scenes in here are pretty brutal, more than I've ever seen on TV. The one extended match with the ""staples"" was pretty gruesome.Evan Rachel Wood is convincing as Randy's daughter ""Stephanie.""  This 21-year-old is no stranger to acting, having been doing it since she was four!  The scenes with her and her dad are memorable.When the shock of the above scenes of sex and violence (and language) fade away, underneath it all is a very tender, sad tale of a lonely man who invested too much in his career and, after coming close to mortality, realizes the important of family and simply being loved by anyone.  That's what sticks with you long after the film ends.  Loneliness can be a killer.""Randy"" tries to mend fences and post a few himself - in his final quest not to wind up as an island in this world of humanity - with both successful and unsucessful results.  Sometimes you can never change what you are, and sometimes you can.

I do not see what all the fuss was about though; I thought it was good, but nothing earth shattering here.Mickey Rourke was great as the nearly washed up Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson.  Once a great professional wrestler, he is now doing local fights, where he still is the greatest, but on a miserable scale.  The film goes through the fascinating (to me) look at professional wrestling, from cutting to steroids.  Randy's miserable life is made more miserable because of his unrequited love for a stripper named Cassidy played by Marisa Tomei.  Randy also has a daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood, he abandoned long ago, and who know wants nothing to do with him.  Complications further arise as Randy suffers a near fatal heart attack and is told never to wrestle or do drugs again.And here is where Rourke shines; Randy does try to do good by his body: he starts a relationship with his daughter, a friendship with Cassidy, and even gets a legitimate job at the deli counter.  (The deli counter scene is my favorite, probably because it was improvised with real people and not extras!).  But because life is unfair, he loses his job in a fit of rage, Cassidy rejects Randy's advances, which makes him forget about a dinner date with his daughter, which causes her to hate him again.  Wait not hate, she does not feel anything for him, ouch!  And so, alone again, Randy turns to the place where he was always loved, even though it may kill him, the ring.I thought it was a good film, with good acting, and an interesting story-Recommended.",3,Good film,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,1620,"['Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'excellent', 'filmmaker', 'knew', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'nothing', 'earth', 'shattering', 'here.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'was', 'great', 'nearly', 'washed', 'up', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'Once', 'great', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'now', 'doing', 'local', 'fights', 'where', 'still', 'greatest', 'miserable', 'scale', 'film', 'fascinating', 'look', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'cutting', 'steroids', 'Randy', 'miserable', 'life', 'made', 'more', 'miserable', 'unrequited', 'love', 'stripper', 'named', 'Cassidy', 'played', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Randy', 'also', 'daughter', 'played', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'abandoned', 'long', 'ago', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'do', 'Complications', 'further', 'arise', 'Randy', 'near', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'told', 'never', 'wrestle', 'do', 'drugs', 'again.And', 'here', 'where', 'Rourke', 'Randy', 'try', 'do', 'good', 'body', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'friendship', 'Cassidy', 'even', 'legitimate', 'job', 'deli', 'counter', 'deli', 'counter', 'scene', 'favorite', 'probably', 'was', 'improvised', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'extras', 'life', 'unfair', 'job', 'fit', 'rage', 'Cassidy', 'Randy', 'advances', 'forget', 'dinner', 'date', 'daughter', 'hate', 'again', 'Wait', 'not', 'hate', 'not', 'feel', 'anything', 'ouch', 'so', 'alone', 'again', 'Randy', 'place', 'where', 'was', 'always', 'loved', 'even', 'may', 'kill', 'ring.I', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'good', 'acting', 'interesting', 'story-Recommended']",N/A

This is a good thing.  Black Swan made an interesting review because it didn't quite work as a straight-forward story, requiring some explanation of director Aronofsky's method and purpose.  The Wrestler requires no explanation because it works better as a story.The view of The Wrestler and Black Swan as inversions--age vs. youth, career end vs. failed start, male vs. female, performance arts, physical discipline, broken homes, sexual isolation, suicide--still holds, but whereas Black Swan is often forced, bordering on contrivance, The Wrestler contains similar themes and techniques effortlessly.  The best example of this is Aronofsky's free association technique, which is on display in The Wrestler by referencing Passion Plays when Mickey Rourke wrestles ""the stapler"" (a Jesus lookalike) on a bed of barbed wire (aka thorns).  The reference fits seamlessly into the storyline.Whereas Black Swan left me fairly indifferent to the fate of the characters, The Wrestler was quite affecting and deserves the praise it received.

It's a run-of-the-mill drama about a washed up entertainer, the kind of story that's been made into multiple biopics and mockumentaries.Then why, you may be wondering, the five stars?  Two reasons.  The first is Aronofsky's filming style--it is direct and humble, ""realistic"" if I must use a film cliche.  It is engaging and helps draw in the audience.  The second, and most important reason you should see this film: Mickey Rourke.  In THE WRESTLER, Rourke either redefines acting, or shirks acting altogether.  His portrayal of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is dead-on, lived-in; it's hard to tell if Rourke is trying to be someone else, or is simply being himself.  This does have one negative effect--the stellar performances of Marisa Tomei and Even Rachel Wood go largely under-appreciated.  It's just so hard not to focus on Rourke, whose performance in this film should be standard-viewing in acting courses.

Duct tape holds his coat together, steroids have bloated his body, chemicals make his hair blond, and a hearing aid dangles from his ear. Hard living, bad luck and stupid choices have landed him where you might expect, including estrangement from his daughter Stefanie. But he soldiers on, and so we love him and resonate with him. When the movie ends ambiguously, we wonder about his fate and hope he will be okay. In a near mirror image, a stripper, Pam, is Randy's only friend, and their mutual commiseration is touching. Who would have thought that a stripper and a wrestler would win our hearts? But such is the skill of director Darren Aronofsky.

K,"[1, 1]","THE WRESTLER**** Out of 5Release Date- Decemeber 17th, 2008Running Time- 111-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- Robert SiegelDirector- Darren AronofskyStarring- Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei and Even Rachel WoodEven though this movie is about a wrestler I don't think you really need to be a fan of it. As a child I was a big wrestling fan and as popular as it was back then with sold out arenas it wasn't really cool to admit it. I lost interest for a long time before getting into it again as a teen and by this time nobody was ashamed to admit they liked it, but the time I reached my mid 20s I lost interest again, while being a fan of wrestling might help you enjoy this more even if you don't like it I don't think it will matter much at the movies core it's a lot deeper than just being about a wrestler.The Wrestler marked the big return for Mickey Rourke who once had a nice career going, but as time went on Rourke's career stalled and he was gone for a long time, but in recent years was making a slight come back with Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Sin City both by Robert Rodriguez, but The Wrestler took him from an actor making a slight come back to the success story of 2008. Rourke may have been popular in the past, but this movie is the role he will always be remembered for and for very good reason.To be honest I found The Wrestler to be a slight letdown, but don't take that wrong this was still an excellent movie and highly worthy of the praise it has received. I think for me the biggest problem is we've sort of seen this kinda flick done so many times it's a bit hard to put your own original take on it. But even with that The Wrestler is one of the best flicks of 2008 and Rourke's performance is no doubt one of the very best of the year and I'd go as far as to say one of the best of the decade.The screenplay by Robert Siegel was excellent and very well written, but I do have some slight problems with it. The main characters are very solid and interesting, but I personally felt a little more could have been done with both. Rourke's character Randy `The Ram' Robinson was once a big time wrestling superstar who performed in front of thousands and now he's pretty much broke wrestling in front of 50 people if lucky a fate that has happened to many wrestlers. But I would have liked for the writer to get into more detail on how The Ram went from the top of the wrestling world to the bottom.Anyone who follows wrestling at all know the reasons stuff like this happens and that's fine, but this is a movie and you can't rely on what happens to real life wrestlers. All of this wouldn't take a big long explanation and could have been summed up in a couple of minutes. The strongest sections of the screenplay are the scenes with Randy and his daughter Stephanie played by Evan Rachel Wood. These scenes are excellent and hard hitting; it's quite obvious why there is a lack of relationship, but I also would have liked to have seen more backstory. I liked Marisa Tomei's character, but I also felt there was a lot more to explore with her character as well.The script by Robert Siegel is very well written and the characters are great, but these complaints I have for me keep this from being a truly great movie. I do think The Wrestler is a great flick, but just those small complaints slightly hold it back for me. What I loved about the script is Randy is a man who has made a lot of mistakes in his life and is trying to make things right, but he's human and he still messes up despite trying. This isn't your typical Hollywood flick where somebody made mistakes and reached rock bottom and makes everything right.Director Darren Aronofsky does an excellent job and what might be slightly lacking with the screenplay Darren Aronofsky more than makes up for with a great tale of a fallen star. Aronofsky creates a gritty look that makes The Wrestler seem almost like a documentary rather than a movie and the brilliant performances make this for much more real. The pacing is solid and Aronofsky brings to life some excellent characters.The acting as I stated is simply amazing; this was the big comeback film for Mickey Rourke and he isn't an actor playing a part he is the character. Even with past success that Rourke has had The Wrestler is without a doubt the role he will always be remembered for. Rourke delivers one of the all time great performances and gives a truly touching performance. I never doubted Rourke's skills as an actor, but this performance just blew me away and I think he really should have taken home the best actor Oscar. Marisa Tomei also delivers a rock solid performance that was very worthy of her Oscar nomination and Marisa is still amazingly beautiful. Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's daughter Stephanie nearly steals the show. Like I stated about my complaints with the script the actors were so amazing they bring a lot more depth than maybe the screenplay gave them.As excellent as Rourke and Tomei were together, Rourke and Evan Rachel Wood just might be better. Wood is a talented young actress and with The Wrestler hopefully more people take notice. My only complaint is she isn't in enough scenes. I think had her role been larger she could have received an Oscar nomination as well.Overall The Wrestler was one of the best films of 2008, but the complaints I had for me keeps this movie from reaching brilliant status, but with that said I still found this to be a great movie and the acting was amazing and Mickey Rourke delivers the performance of a lifetime. As good as The Wrestler was Mickey Rourke is what elevates the movie. The Wrestler comes highly recommended. It's a tragic story and even as flawed as Randy is and as deserving of his fate at times, Rourke brings so much emotion you'll be rooting for the character to get his life together.The Blu-ray release is alright; the picture quality is excellent, but still maintains the gritty look Darren Aronofsky was going for and the sound quality is also excellent. The features slightly lack however. There's a 42-min behind the scenes and a 20-min discussion with a few pro wrestlers and finally a music video by Bruce Springsteen. The release was alright not the worst, but not the best, but the picture and sound are solid.",4,Excellent flick; Rourke delivers a performance of a lifetime,1240531200,"04 24,

Some people would say there are paralells between ""Randy the Ram"" Robinson and Rourke but that's okay.  Both the actor and character he played are down on the ropes after experiencing past glory.  Rourke probably saw this as a last chance to resucitate a dormant career and with every fiber of his being he make's the Ram's desperation real to the audience.  I'm not a wrestling fan in the least but I was exalting when the Ram took on his longtime ""foe"" in the ring at a dingy hall where his prior glory was achieved at the hallowed halls of Madison Square Garden.  Kudos as well to director Darren Aronofsky whose showed great promise in ""Requiem for a Dream"".  Aronofsky lens the film in a semi-documentary style that places the emphasis on character and he should be applauded for allowing the story to tell itself and allow his actors, which also includes terrific turns by Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood, to shine.

1237145,A2KWG1J285Z4QA,B001TOD92C,David Baltazar,"[0, 0]","This review is for;The WrestlerMickey Rourke gives a well deserved Oscar Nominated performance as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. The opening credits of the film takes us through a photo/newspaper montage of the wrestler's popular career, but the actual film begins twenty years later as the wrestler struggles to maintain a life outside of his sports career with a troubled relationship with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), trying to work discreetly for a local supermarket and a flirtatious hint of romanticism with a stripper (Marisa Tormei with some very, sensual moments at the club). The film has a very documentary look to it complete with some hand-held camera shots, but not overdone like ""Cloverfield"" or ""The Blair Witch Project"".The film pretty much shows Rourke's character's repeated attempts to adapt and make amends or connect to the few people he knows outside of his wrestling world, but more often than not we see his failures. He's a man that lives in a mobile home park struggling to keep up with the rent while driving around town in an old van while listening to 80's heavy metal music. He occasionally wears a hearing aid & glasses. Outside of the supermarket job he continues to participate in weekend wrestling events where we see many backstage scenes of wrestlers collaborating about pre-ordained moves. Drug use of steroids or other addictive medications are shown in the film as expected leading us to believe about the inevitable physical downfalls. A visit to the local doctor only confirms some of his fears of his detoriating, physical health.I think one of the most telling moments of the film is when he sits at a table during a fan fest with other wrestlers to sign autographs and to take polaroids with fans. The room is scarcely populated, and Rourke's character spends a few moments glaring at his other battered colleagues (many physically scarred & battered like himself) that are patiently waiting for any fans that scarcely arrive. We also get a moment when Rourke's character calls one of his neighborhood kids to play a vintage, Nintendo video game with him as the kid tries to describe a more modern video game called ""Call of Duty 4"" (the kid probably has a PS3 or Xbox 360). I also like some of his humorous moments when he worked at the deli as he tries to get the exact weight for a lady's order of potato salad who keeps telling him to add more or subtract more.Ultimately throughout the whole film the only time Rourke's character seems to get  acceptance is when he was near his wrestling sport community of friends and associates who always happily greets him every time they see him. Overall I didn't really think this was a film about wrestling, but just about the human element about people we may just see on television or at a sporting event by name and not knowing anything about their real life outside of their realm. It's about people consumed about what they do in the arena and failing to adapt outside of it. I was very impressed with ""The Wrestler"" and it was much better than I thought it was going to be.

Yes, I have all of my teeth, no I do not sport a mullet. Wrestling fans are often derided for their choice of entertainment, and at times when watching some of the god-awful programming WWE has been putting on the air over the years, I sometimes ask myself why do I tune in to watch two men fake fighting? I truly cannot answer that question.When I first heard about ""The Wrestler"" coming out I figured it was going to be a throw-away comedy. Something starring David Spade or Artie Lange that would probably go straight to DVD. As I began hearing more and more about the film, I was intrigued. The film was going to be a straight drama, not an excuse to poke fun at wrestlers or their fans?The film is simply fantastic. ""The Wrestler"" doesn't really delve into the ""why"" of wrestling, but the ""who"". This is a character driven film about two broken people who are searching for ""something"". Mickey Rourke as Randy ""The Ram"" does a phenomenal job, and it's easy to see why he was nominated for Best Actor at the last Academy Awards. His lonely character grabs you in a similar way to Stallone's initial portrayal of Rocky Balboa does. You like Randy, and want to see him succeed. You cringe at the choices he has made, and the choices he continues to make, yet you always root for him to come out on top.Even if you hate wrestling, you will love this movie.

1237148,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001TOD92C,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 5]","Mickey Rourke's triumphant return! `THE WRESTLER' is magnificently real, edgy and easily one of the best films to come out in theaters in 2009 thus far!  Rourke is just amazing in this film!""THE WRESTLER"", a 2008 film (released in theaters in Jan. 2009) had faced a good number of challenges during its planning and production.  Under the constant constraints of trying to get financing and setting a budget and a film finding the right talent that would be perfect for a certain role was indeed a challengeFortunately, the film was well-cast and well written, ""THE WRESTLER"" definitely succeeds under the wonderful guidance of Director Darren Aronofsky (""Requiem for a Dream"", ""The Fountain"", etc.) and a convincing storyline by Robert D. Siegel.  Magnificent performances by Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood!""THE WRESTLER"" is a film about consequences and the moment.  Showcasing the dark side of professional wrestling, it definitely gives us a perspective of knowing that Randy's story is just among the number of wrestlers...old and new, who faces aging, trying to keep fit and doing what they can to get them prepared for the ring, even if it may kill them.VIDEO & AUDIO:""THE WRESTLER"" single-disc DVD is presented in widescreen format 2.35:1 aspect ratio with English 5.1 Dolby Surround.  Picture quality is quite decent on DVD but I'm sure that a film with this much action in the ring should look much more better in High Definition.  But on DVD, it looks as if the film had a lot of grain but granted, the film was shot using 16mmAs for the audio, ""THE WRESTLER"" is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Surround, the audience cheering and the constant blasts of 80's rock music from Quiet Riot, RATT and other 80's rock bands with music that definitely comes out strong through the front channels.SPECIAL FEATURES:The following special features for ""THE WRESTLER"" are included:* Within the Ring featurette - (42:44) An indepth featurette with interviews with the Director and producers of ""THE WRESTLER"" discussing their challenges the film faced, budget problems but working with the various talent and how this story is not to far off from the lives of real professional wrestlers.* The Wrestler Music Video - Written and Performed by Bruce Springsteen - (3:59)  A music video featuring Bruce Springsteen performing in the middle of a wrestling ring and clips from the movie.JUDGMENT CALL:""THE WRESTLER"" is just a powerful film and I have to credit that to the performance of Mickey Rourke.  The amount of work to get his body so toned and muscular is quite impressive but the overall screenplay and level of direction really made this film feel genuine.  I was very surprised of how much bulking up he had to do in order to play the character of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson.  But you can't deny that Rourke looked perfect for the role and his portrayal of a man who's lost was just magnificent.I don't know if any other actor could have really pulled it off.  Rourke's determination and how he owned this role is just brilliant and he was definitely deserving of an Academy Award nomination.Marisa Tomei also had an Academy Award-caliber performance and she looked absolutely great in this film.  Definitely a role that I would never have pictured her for, but nevertheless, she did great.And Evan Rachel Wood, as the estranged daughter, she definitely brought the emotional element between father and daughter and how messed up things truly are between them.  Another fine performance for Wood, who was absolutely wonderful in her last film ""Across the Universe"".What makes ""THE WRESTLER"" work so well is its layers of believability.  The character living in a trailer park, the character of Randy still tries to live in his past relishing on the good years of when he was one of the most popular wrestlers. His mannerisms of dying his hair to continually working his various odd jobs.  He loves it when people listen to his wrestling war stories about his injuries, having the neighbor kids come over to play old school NES (with his character) and having fans and wrestlers continue to support him.  But knowing outside of his life and the persona he has lived, his life is just in shambles.What is very sad about this film, although the storyline features the life of one wrestler, is to know that in reality, Randy's life is a life that many professional wrestlers have lived.  Unlike other sports where an athlete can retire, many of these wrestlers in the 80's did not have the big money contracts of today, nor did they have film offers and aside from Hulk Hogan, the truth is that a good number of the pro wrestlers from yesteryear are poor, wrestling to survive and like the character of Randy, estranged from their own family members, abuse steroids, pain medications or drugs and having to wrestle to survive.How far these athletes will go to earn a paycheck which includes having their bodies battered decades after their prime as a top wrestler.  No health insurance for these aged wrestlers and what money is made from one wrestling match, would have to be spent in a hotel/motel in another state or city and really, are not in a good position to continually save. So, basically when they are in the ring, they are relying on their own wrestling smarts but if they get hurt or injured, it's on their backs and thus many use drugs or painkillers for their pain.Where a film such as ""BEYOND THE MAT"" showed to wrestling fans a realistic and dark and downside of professional wrestling, ""THE WRESTLER"" is obviously a film that has more visibility and will expose people to this side of life of pro wrestlers and thanks to its Academy Award  and critically-acclaimed hype (which is definitely warranted), I hope people give this film a try.Overall, I was really impressed with the film and how well emotions were captured.  And again, magnificent performances from Rourke, Tomei and Wood.""THE WRESTLER"" is definitely recommended on DVD or Blu-ray!",5,'THE WRESTLER' is magnificently real and easily one of the best films

First, because I was worried that I would be too distracted by Mickey Rourke's plastic surgery to be able to enjoy the film. Also, I thought that it would be a lot about wrestling, which I have no interest in. But, being an Aronofsky fan, especially because ofRequiem for a Dream (2000 Film), I decided to take a chance, and I'm so glad that I did.You don't have to like or even watch wrestling to enjoy this film. But, strangely enough, watching those scenes was like watching a car accident, hard to ignore. As much as the sport is supposed to be ""fake,"" there is nothing fake about someone throwing you out of the ring, using a staple gun on you, or cutting your own forehead, and having blood pour down your face. I felt like those scenes were jaw-dropping, and I had to look away several times, and then look back to make sure that he was okay.I know that I don't need to regurgitate the storyline here, because there have been so many great reviews before me. I was suprised at how amazing Mickey Rourke's acting was. I really felt everything that Randy said and did. I had so much sympathy toward him when he was trying to reconcile with his daughter. Even though I didn't feel Evan Rachel Wood's acting was quite up to par as the others, I could sympathize with that whole situation about how he was never a good father. When he was trying to connect with Pam, the aging stripper, who, even though looks gorgeous in her 40's, you see that she had a very similar job as his. The older you get, the more the job takes a toll on you. You become addicted to that lifestyle. It was almost as if it was their ""drug of choice."" They had that in common which is probably why they connected so much.I thought about the movie long after it was over, and I cried more than once. It was so raw and real, that you couldn't help to feel sorry for all of these characters, lost in their own way. People make mistakes, and even though he kept making them over and over, I still felt that he was a good person, and I admired him for trying.Highly recommended!",5,"""The only place I get hurt is out there.""",1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,2093,"['was', 'skeptical', 'watching', 'movie', 'First', 'was', 'worried', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'distracted', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Also', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'wrestling', 'have', 'interest', 'being', 'Aronofsky', 'fan', 'especially', 'ofRequiem', 'Dream', '2000', 'Film', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'like', 'even', 'watch', 'wrestling', 'enjoy', 'film', 'strangely', 'enough', 'watching', 'scenes', 'was', 'watching', 'car', 'accident', 'hard', 'ignore', 'As', 'much', 'sport', 'supposed', 'be', 'fake', 'nothing', 'fake', 'someone', 'throwing', 'ring', 'using', 'staple', 'gun', 'cutting', 'own', 'forehead', 'having', 'blood', 'pour', 'face', 'felt', 'scenes', 'were', 'jaw-dropping', 'had', 'look', 'away', 'several', 'times', 'then', 'look', 'back', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'okay.I', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'regurgitate', 'storyline', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'reviews', 'was', 'suprised', 'how', 'amazing', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'felt', 'everything', 'Randy', 'said', 'did', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'sympathy', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'daughter', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'up', 'par', 'others', 'could', 'sympathize', 'whole', 'situation', 'how', 'was', 'never', 'good', 'father', 'When', 'was', 'trying', 'connect', 'Pam', 'aging', 'stripper', 'who', 'even', 'looks', 'gorgeous', '40', 'see', 'had', 'very', 'similar', 'job', 'older', 'get', 'more', 'job', 'toll', 'become', 'addicted', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'almost', 'was', 'drug', 'choice', 'had', 'common', 'probably', 'why', 'connected', 'so', 'much.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'long', 'was', 'over', 'cried', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'so', 'raw', 'real', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'characters', 'lost', 'own', 'way', 'People', 'make', 'mistakes', 'even', 'kept', 'making', 'still', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'person', 'admired', 'trying.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Not as suicidally dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it doesn't need to be - where Requiem was about a self-destructive quest for the taste of an elusive high, The Wrestler is more interested in the shattered figure trying to cope with the repercussions of that lifestyle. Mickey Rourke nails the role of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, as advertised; the conflicting emotions of hope, guilt, desperation and cheap indulgence that flash across his face speak volumes when the character has very little to say for himself. Marissa Tomei is nicely cast as his counterpart, a stripper running into identical problems; aging in an industry that relies almost exclusively on one's superficial gifts.

1237152,ADKHI1TUGAX4,B001TOD92C,E. Anderson,"[1, 1]","I have been eagerly anticipating The Wrestler since I first heard about it towards the end of 2008. A friend of mine had the opportunity to see it and raved about it to me. The Wrestler stars Mickey Rourke as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a pro-wrestler whose fame and glory has come and gone, and is reduced to working part time at a grocery store and performing as a wrestler in high school gymnasiums and other small venues. Mickey's performance is nothing short of heartbreaking as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. Just like Mickey in real life, Randy's life has not been kind to him. He is estranged from his now grown up daughter Stephanie (played brilliantly by Evan Rachel Wood). His health has made him question his career in wrestling. Randy is constantly struggling with his finances, works part time at a job he hates, and his love life is essentially non-existent.I enjoyed this film immensely. Because of the cinematography, there was many times when I felt that I was watching a documentary than a fictional movie. I thought that was a great idea for Darren Aronofsky to have the movie shot in a way that it felt like a documentary. The performances by Mickey, Marissa, and Evan were devastatingly heartbreaking to watch especially Mickey as Randy. The hair metal soundtrack although albeit too loud at times was perfect. The music did capture the era in which Randy's success was at its peak which was in the 1980s. Normally I don't like endings that abruptly and without closure but I thought Darren ended the way that it deserved, to leave audiences thinking of what happens to Randy and for us to draw our own conclusions to his fate. I loved how the wrestling was portrayed. It was obvious that Darren wanted to portray professional wrestling with as authencity by including an array of real life professional wrestlers.The story of the film may be simple but sometimes less is more. It is depressing however I could not imagine for the story to be anything but one constant disappointment after another in Randy's life. The wrestling scenes were intensely violent and occasionally a bit too much for my liking.

1237154,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001TOD92C,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","It's hard to imagine any actor but the thoroughly embattled Mickey Rourke in the title role of this unremittingly bleak 2008 character study of a pro wrestling star well past his prime and trying to figure out if he can have a life outside the ring. Unlike the heavily stylized work for which he is known (Pi,Requiem for a Dream), director Darren Aronofsky takes a refreshingly straightforward approach here, and Roarke responds with a galvanizing performance that appears to blur the line between reality and fiction. A talented actor (Sin City) with a tattered career of early highs and all-too-many lows, much of them his own doing, he has such a firm grasp on his character's fatal flaws one can't help wondering how much art is imitating life. Regardless, the symbiotic result makes for an often powerful film-watching experience.Rourke plays blond-maned Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson whose professional glory peaked back in the 1980's. Two decades later, he finds his career relegated to small-time matches on the independent circuit in venues attended by only the most fanatical of his diminishing fan base. Living in a trailer he can barely afford, Randy lives on the edge of life, using a pharmacy of meds to hold his broken body together and going to a strip club where he finds himself drawn to a veteran lap dancer named Cassidy. Even in such desperate straits, he proves to be a decent man wracked with not only physical pain but a foreboding sense of his own mortality once he is hospitalized after a grueling match. The story focuses on his fumbling attempts to come to terms with what he wants from what's left of his life.That includes reconciling with his long-estranged daughter Stephanie who has grown bitter over years of being ignored, forming a lasting relationship with Cassidy beyond the next sixty dollars, and even quitting the ring entirely by working the deli counter at a local grocery store. However, the draw of a twentieth anniversary rematch with another iconic wrestler, the Ayatollah, pulls hard at him with the dream of recapturing his former glory. The storyline sounds predictable, and it is if you just take into account Robert Siegel's bare-bones screenplay, but it falls on Rourke's deeply felt work to thwart the clich&eacute;s. Only allowed to show the character in terms of his succession of failures, the actor brings aching heart and surprising sensitivity to a role that could have easily been mired in stereotype. His confessional at the deserted amusement park is heartbreaking.At the same time, with his physique made to look ravaged by steroids and ringside abuse, he is completely convincing in the ring as he orchestrates the elaborate moves to give his fans their money's worth. As the self-protective Cassidy, Marisa Tomei (Before the Devil Knows You're Dead) again proves what a fine, underrated character actress she can be as her character uneasily keeps Randy at arm's length when his need for intimacy threatens her insulated world. Evan Rachel Wood (Across the Universe) has less to do as Stephanie, but she punctuates her scenes with both visceral anger and poignant wariness. The film has an almost documentary feel about it thanks to Aronofsky's no-frills direction and Maryse Alberti's washed-out cinematography, but the approach is fitting given the gritty subject.",4,Take a Ringside Seat for Rourke's Galvanizing Comeback,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,3327,"['hard', 'imagine', 'actor', 'thoroughly', 'embattled', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'title', 'role', 'unremittingly', 'bleak', '2008', 'character', 'study', 'pro', 'wrestling', 'star', 'well', 'prime', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'can', 'have', 'life', 'ring', 'heavily', 'stylized', 'work', 'known', 'Pi', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'refreshingly', 'straightforward', 'approach', 'here', 'Roarke', 'galvanizing', 'performance', 'blur', 'line', 'reality', 'fiction', 'talented', 'actor', 'Sin', 'City', 'tattered', 'career', 'early', 'highs', 'all-too-many', 'lows', 'much', 'own', 'doing', 'firm', 'grasp', 'character', 'fatal', 'flaws', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'art', 'imitating', 'life', 'Regardless', 'symbiotic', 'result', 'often', 'powerful', 'film-watching', 'experience.Rourke', 'blond-maned', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'professional', 'glory', 'peaked', 'back', '1980', 'Two', 'decades', 'later', 'career', 'relegated', 'small-time', 'matches', 'independent', 'circuit', 'venues', 'attended', 'only', 'most', 'fanatical', 'diminishing', 'fan', 'base', 'Living', 'trailer', 'can', 'barely', 'afford', 'Randy', 'edge', 'life', 'using', 'pharmacy', 'meds', 'hold', 'broken', 'body', 'together', 'going', 'strip', 'club', 'where', 'drawn', 'veteran', 'lap', 'dancer', 'named', 'Cassidy', 'Even', 'such', 'desperate', 'straits', 'be', 'decent', 'man', 'wracked', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'pain', 'foreboding', 'sense', 'own', 'mortality', 'hospitalized', 'grueling', 'match', 'story', 'fumbling', 'attempts', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'what', 'left', 'reconciling', 'long-estranged', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'who', 'grown', 'bitter', 'years', 'being', 'ignored', 'forming', 'lasting', 'relationship', 'Cassidy', 'next', 'sixty', 'dollars', 'even', 'quitting', 'ring', 'entirely', 'working', 'deli', 'counter', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'However', 'draw', 'twentieth', 'anniversary', 'rematch', 'iconic', 'wrestler', 'Ayatollah', 'hard', 'dream', 'recapturing', 'former', 'glory', 'storyline', 'predictable', 'just', 'take', 'account', 'Robert', 'Siegel', 'bare-bones', 'screenplay', 'Rourke', 'deeply', 'felt', 'work', 'thwart', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Only', 'allowed', 'show', 'character', 'terms', 'succession', 'failures', 'actor', 'aching', 'heart', 'surprising', 'sensitivity', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'mired', 'stereotype', 'confessional', 'deserted', 'amusement', 'park', 'same', 'time', 'physique', 'made', 'look', 'ravaged', 'steroids', 'ringside', 'abuse', 'completely', 'convincing', 'ring', 'elaborate', 'moves', 'give', 'fans', 'money', 'worth', 'self-protective', 'Cassidy', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Devil', 'Knows', ""'re"", 'Dead', 'again', 'what', 'fine', 'underrated', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'character', 'uneasily', 'Randy', 'arm', 'length', 'when', 'need', 'intimacy', 'insulated', 'world', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Universe', 'less', 'do', 'Stephanie', 'scenes', 'visceral', 'anger', 'poignant', 'wariness', 'film', 'almost', 'documentary', 'feel', 'Aronofsky', 'no-frills', 'direction', 'Maryse', 'Alberti', 'washed-out', 'cinematography', 'approach', 'fitting', 'given', 'gritty', 'subject']",N/A
1237155,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001TOD92C,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE WRESTLER is one of the most compelling films I've seen, and I just watched it for the first time. Mickey Rourke has never been so sympathetic and touching. As the washed-up old wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" (his character's real name, Robin with a Polish surname, I didn't quite catch), he tugged at my heart because I grew up with men like him. But they weren't wrestlers.The Ram is old, tired, ill, alone and in lots of terrible pain. Feelings I know oh-so-well. He is already a has-been, can't seem to find the companionship he truly needs, and into the bargain he suffers a major heart attack requiring bypass surgery. This last fact he stoically manages to hide from everyone except a cherished few. He tells his love interest, pole-dancer/stripper Cassidy a/k/a Pam (Marisa Tomei)--and he tells his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood).Here I evaluate this film-as-film. It is brilliantly shot, documentary-style but so effective dramatically that director Daron Aronofsky (THE FOUNTAIN, PI--see my review) should teach documentary film classes. The way the camera seems to be at times dogging but always following Mickey Rourke is brilliant. I told my wife I had never had this much fun looking at a man's back for so long. The film is really that good, because you feel you are there and you are following along.There is tragedy here, of course, and no humor allowed other than the naturally occurring world of wrestling humor, which is brilliantly exposed here. The characters really breathe, they feel, they sweat and they bleed. They are acting, yes, it's not all fake yet we are shown what is fake and what is not. That is priceless.I felt that The Ram's daughter Stephanie was over the top, so extremely angry that I felt she needed hospitalization. Then I realized there is a very similar situation among my relatives. Suddenly I saw the tragic beauty of this part of the film, and how it fit snugly between The Ram's other travails.All this was carefully balanced against the dreadful downward spiral of stripper Cassidy, who is pole dancing with shots of The Ram intercut. Now there are two old has-beens. It is an exquisitely painful sight to see, because I didn't see Cassidy as washed-up...but the camera catches it. Aronofsky created it, caught it on film, and the viewer's heart bleeds.One scene I thought was stupidly unnecessary was the graphic sex scene with the two players (The Ram and some random prostitute) acting like complete pigs. Real life or fantasy, I DON'T want to see that kind of garbage in movies. I'm no censor or even prudish--honestly, can no one see that all that sex interferes with the storyline flow and is incredibly ugly?Truly: Why is it that every film now has to have some totally gross-out sex scene? What does it add to any story? And for that, I take away one star Mr. Aronofsky. You Gollywood people need to realize when you've crossed the line with this stuff. If it hadn't been for those explicit scenes, I'd have recommended this film be shown in schools.All in all, you cannot afford to miss this otherwise great film. Nor will I give away any of the goodies to be enjoyed herein. You'll have to see for yourself.Mickey Rourke does not need a ""rebirth"", nor did he need a ""comeback"" as it were...he just needed a string of good films and I hope this is just one among them. After all, he was in THE PLEDGE (2001), GET CARTER (2000), THE RAINMAKER (1997) and I can recall all the way back to his beginnings in 1941 (1979) and the next-big-thing he did, THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE (1984), then ANGEL HEART (1987).He worked a lot in between, and was certainly busy in the 1990s and extremely busy this last decade. It's not like Mickey was ever ""lost""...but in any case, I would say welcome to the starring role big-time.",4,Wrestling with life...and death,1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,3789,"['WRESTLER', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'sympathetic', 'touching', 'washed-up', 'old', 'wrestler', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'character', 'real', 'name', 'Robin', 'Polish', 'surname', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'catch', 'tugged', 'heart', 'grew', 'up', 'men', 'were', ""n't"", 'wrestlers.The', 'Ram', 'old', 'tired', 'ill', 'alone', 'lots', 'terrible', 'pain', 'Feelings', 'know', 'oh-so-well', 'already', 'has-been', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'companionship', 'truly', 'bargain', 'major', 'heart', 'attack', 'requiring', 'bypass', 'surgery', 'last', 'fact', 'stoically', 'hide', 'everyone', 'cherished', 'few', 'love', 'interest', 'pole-dancer/stripper', 'Cassidy', 'a/k/a', 'Pam', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', '.Here', 'evaluate', 'film-as-film', 'brilliantly', 'shot', 'documentary-style', 'so', 'effective', 'dramatically', 'director', 'Daron', 'Aronofsky', 'THE', 'FOUNTAIN', 'PI', 'see', 'review', 'should', 'teach', 'documentary', 'film', 'classes', 'way', 'camera', 'be', 'times', 'dogging', 'always', 'following', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'brilliant', 'told', 'wife', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'fun', 'looking', 'man', 'back', 'so', 'long', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'following', 'along.There', 'tragedy', 'here', 'course', 'humor', 'allowed', 'other', 'naturally', 'occurring', 'world', 'wrestling', 'humor', 'brilliantly', 'exposed', 'here', 'characters', 'really', 'breathe', 'feel', 'sweat', 'bleed', 'are', 'acting', 'yes', 'not', 'fake', 'yet', 'are', 'shown', 'what', 'fake', 'what', 'not', 'priceless.I', 'felt', 'Ram', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'was', 'top', 'so', 'extremely', 'angry', 'felt', 'needed', 'hospitalization', 'Then', 'realized', 'very', 'similar', 'situation', 'relatives', 'Suddenly', 'saw', 'tragic', 'beauty', 'part', 'film', 'how', 'snugly', 'Ram', 'other', 'travails.All', 'was', 'carefully', 'balanced', 'dreadful', 'downward', 'spiral', 'stripper', 'Cassidy', 'who', 'pole', 'dancing', 'shots', 'Ram', 'intercut', 'Now', 'are', 'two', 'old', 'has-beens', 'exquisitely', 'painful', 'sight', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Cassidy', 'washed-up', 'camera', 'Aronofsky', 'created', 'caught', 'film', 'viewer', 'heart', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'stupidly', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scene', 'two', 'players', 'Ram', 'random', 'prostitute', 'acting', 'complete', 'pigs', 'Real', 'life', 'fantasy', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'want', 'see', 'kind', 'garbage', 'movies', ""'m"", 'censor', 'even', 'prudish', 'honestly', 'can', 'one', 'see', 'sex', 'storyline', 'flow', 'incredibly', 'ugly', 'Truly', 'Why', 'film', 'now', 'have', 'totally', 'gross-out', 'sex', 'scene', 'What', 'add', 'story', 'take', 'away', 'one', 'star', 'Mr.', 'Aronofsky', 'Gollywood', 'people', 'need', 'realize', 'when', ""'ve"", 'crossed', 'line', 'stuff', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'explicit', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'have', 'recommended', 'film', 'be', 'shown', 'schools.All', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'miss', 'otherwise', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'away', 'goodies', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'herein', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'yourself.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'not', 'need', 'rebirth', 'did', 'need', 'comeback', 'were', 'just', 'needed', 'string', 'good', 'films', 'hope', 'just', 'one', 'was', 'THE', 'PLEDGE', '2001', 'GET', 'CARTER', '2000', 'RAINMAKER', '1997', 'can', 'recall', 'way', 'back', 'beginnings', '1941', '1979', 'next-big-thing', 'did', 'THE', 'POPE', 'OF', 'GREENWICH', 'VILLAGE', '1984', 'then', 'ANGEL', 'HEART', '1987', '.He', 'worked', 'lot', 'was', 'certainly', 'busy', '1990s', 'extremely', 'busy', 'last', 'decade', 'not', 'Mickey', 'was', 'ever', 'lost', 'case', 'would', 'say', 'welcome', 'starring', 'role', 'big-time']",N/A

In fact, I have always liked Mickey Rourke, I think he is an outstanding actor, but has been in some lousy movies which have really affected his career.However, as much as Rourke is phenomenal in this movie, Evan Rachel Wood steals the show.

The first thing you will notice is the camera work. It's mostly done in a hand-held style reminiscent of documentaries. The second thing you'll notice is how Rourke just immerses himself in the role. There are little touches and details that you won't see in the vast majority of films. Marisa Tomei (gorgeous as always) plays a stripper in her mid or late 40's. And there's a scene where she's crawling along the catwalk and you can see the stretchmarks on her body giving away her age. In 90% of Hollywood films, they would have edited them out. The scene where Rourke breaks down and says he's ""just a broken down piece 'a meat"", that is just one of the top tear-jerker scenes and somewhat reminiscent of Brando in ""On the Waterfront"".Despite nobody acknowledging this, ""The Wrestler"" is based on the life of Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts.

This film is the portrait of a man who is coming to terms with his own mortality, literally and also for his craft. There have been many things said about this movie but there seems to be one constant, and that is Mickey Rourke's masterful performance. For those who have not seen this I can tell you right now that he was screwed at the Academy Awards, that little golden man should have been his with out a doubt. I have been a fan of pro wrestling for a long time and while films like ""Ready to Rumble"" are fun for those days when you need to shut off your brain there has never been a serious film on it, until now.The film follows Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson {Rourke} during the end of days so to speak for him, his days doing what he loves are coming to an end. Sure his prime is long behind him but the first part of this showcases that he still loves what he does [on weekends] until health issues arise. Add in the fact that he has an estranged relationship with his daughter { Evan Rachel Wood} and a weird one with a stripper{ Marisa Tomei}. So the film moves on through the emotional ups and downs of a half empty man with an empty life. As his time draws near he tries to mend fences with his daughter and purse a real stable relationship with a stripper named Cassidy. If all that sounds not so appealing to you and you shy away from this film you are making a big mistake. The journey this man takes is really an interesting one, we follow him from knowing who he was to finding out who he is.Director Darren Aronofsky who has made such classics as The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream, and Pi just to name a few has created another classic masterpiece. I love how he and DP Maryse Alberti brought a some what documentary style to this film, it felt real. Writer Robert Siegel did an excellent job crafting this tale, and should have at least been up for nomination for an Oscar. I am not sure if what I am about to say is true but I'll say it any way, I have heard that this film was based on the wrestling documentary ""Beyond The Mat"" [great film]. In fact in particular I have heard it was based on Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts's portion of the film, it fits with the alcohol and drug abuse and really fits the daughter portion.Like I said earlier Mickey Rourke is masterful in this film and he should have won the Oscar easily, hands down it should have been his. It has been said that Rourke did not portray this character as much as the character portrayed him, he did an excellent job. Same can be said for the two female leads Evan Rachel Wood playing his daughter and Marisa Tomei playing his would be girlfriend stripper. Both of them do wonderful jobs with this film as both play very different but somewhat the same characters. They live very different lives and have different personalities but both act the same around Randy. Both try to stay away from him and avoid a real relationship but both find themselves drawn to him only to be hurt. Also Ernest Miller also known as ""The Cat"" a real life pro wrestler did a great job as The Ayatollah as do all the wrestlers in this film from TNA regulars Jay Lethal and Ron Killings [WWE] to ROH athletes like Necro Butcher.When viewing this film you will find yourself laughing at times and sad for him at the very next moment, this film truly takes you through all the emotions. From the happy beginning to the last triumphant shot of the film you will be cheering for The Ram. Does he make back to the top one final time or is that last shot just one more misguided attempt at past glory, that is up to you. For me this is a winner and one brilliant film and I am glad to see the mainstream accepting wrestling again after the Benoit thing. This is a great look into what life for a pro wrestler who is still trying to be in the game can be like.

1237163,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B001TOD92C,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[1, 1]","In the film, a wrestler, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson has been in the wrestling world for twenty years. Being in the twilight of his career, Randy's health is deteriorating as his substance abuse and reckless lifestyle has caught up to him. He drinks regularly, abuses steroids, and habits a particular strip club to meet up with a stripper named Cassidy. After he suffers a heart attack, and is subsequently warned by his doctor to quit wrestling, Randy has some soul searching to do. He reevaluates his life, and tries to correct several aspects: he wants to take his relationship with Cassidy a bit more serious and hopes to marry; he tries to reconnect with his daughter, who barely knows who he is; he tries to keep his spirits up despite the many struggles he encounters.Once Randy's world--wrestling--is taken from him, he struggles. He takes a job in a meat deli to try to pay the bills but this is a tough transition. He meets and tries to reconcile with his daughter, but there is time that he can't get back, and the awkwardness of lost time makes it hard to work things out. He can't work things out with Cassidy because she can't get serious about their relationship. Doing what most would want to do in this situation, Randy makes an attempt to return to the thing he loves most. Knowing that it has been twenty years since his match with his rival, Ayatollah- he realizes that this must a perfect time to make a quick return to the ring. However, how will things turn out now being that he has some health concerns?What I love about this film is the reality and humanness it portrays. Steering from prototypes, The Wrestler shows the raw, ugly side of human failings, but also the redemption that people try to gain when they see the errors of their ways. Like many films, The Wrestler could have portrayed its characters in ""cut and dry"" ways; instead, they depict Randy as a character with many flaws, yet with an awareness of these flaws. There is a ""disgusting"" side to him, yet there is a human side. He tries to become a better person. As the film progresses, he realizes that time may be working against him. Let's just say that the ending is definitely open-ended: you can judge what happens to Randy on your own. Was it an ultimate euphoric moment, or a tragic ending?The Wrestler also is unique in that it is an introspective look into the world of ""staged"" wrestling. There is a camaraderie and bonding that the wrestlers almost seem to have when preparing for a match.On a personal note, The Wrestler evoked nostalgic memories of big hair metal bands and wrestling before it became some huge conglomerate. I didn't feel guilty for listening and enjoying Cinderella, Poison or Ratt. I haven't heard ""Round and Round"" so many times since high school or MTVs Video Fights.The Wrestler got some attention at the Academy Awards, and, I think, with good reason. Mickey Rourke does a fantastic job with his role, even though some may accuse him of ""just being himself.""

Rourke does little more than look bizarre and purse his lips a lot in brooding fashion.  I think he's getting a pity vote because of his grotesque appearance?  Maybe people don't remember that he plays the same guy in every movie....the sulking, soul searching, guy.  Usually the point seems to be that his inner poet matches the beauty of his Adonis like looks, and he's still clinging to that device, only now it's his ragged, battered soul matching his wreck of a face and body.  The writing and plot were pretty cliched, which was dissapointing.  The beat up slab of meat, the hooker with a heart of gold, a father wanting to do the right thing only it's too late, the estranged kid who wants daddy out of her life for good.....there's probably a few I'm missing but frankly I lost interest and quit counting cliches.

What you might also have noticed in that viewing, however, is a young Mickey Rourke who, despite a small part, clearly outshines his acting compadres.  And so it has always been with Mr. Rourke, from ""Body Heat"" to ""Year of the Dragon"" to ""Fall Time"" to ""Domino"" to ""Sin City.""  Regardless of what's going on with him personally, he's always great professionally.Granted, Rourke is America's poster boy for bad living, but that only helps make his role in ""The Wrestler"" more convincing.  He plays the role of aging professional wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (his first name is actually ""Robin""), twenty years past his prime, living in a New Jersey trailer park, estranged from his daughter and with no caring connections in the real world.In fact, the whole movie might be said to be about what's real and what's fake and, regardless, does living in one versus the other matter, especially if one (the real) is more painful than the other (the fake).Marisa Tomei is quite fetching in her turn as the stripper love interest of Rourke's character.

1237166,AY12DBB0U420B,B001TOD92C,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","Here's another one I picked off the bargain rack at my nearby Ross store. It's a winner and is quite a good movie. ""The Wrestler"" starring Mickey Rourke takes place at an unknown location and time but I'd guess it to be New Jersey and fairly recent. Have you ever wondered what pro-wrestling is like on the very bottom rung of the profession? Well, here's your chance to find out. Mickey Rourke plays an aging and burned-out wrestler to perfection. He received a ""best actor"" nomination for the Academy Awards and was a winner in the Golden Globe Awards. He earned the accolades in this excellent performance.The movie is somewhat more like a documentary on the life of a lower-level pro-wrestler than it is a movie. Well, it's a good story and it's quite well done. Very informative. All the aches and pains and low-life living are  everywhere evident and the movie documents the slow decline to a somewhat startling final scene. You just cannot help but being grabbed by the pathetic life of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson and you'll suffer right along with him. I hadn't heard of the movie before. Maybe it's one of those relatively unknown movies that only film buffs know about. In any case, it's first-rate viewing.Gary Peterson",5,A Good Story.

1237167,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B001TOD92C,General Zombie,"[3, 3]","Darren Aronofsky's much hyped but severely uneven career has finally generated a truly first-rate film in ""The Wrestler."" Much of ""The Wrestler"" breaks with his oeuvre: while Aronofsky's earlier films were hyper-stylized, frantically edited works with fragmented narratives, ""The Wrestler"" is shot in a no frills manner and tells a fairly simple story. Yet in many ways, ""The Wrestler"" is the spiritual follow up to ""Requiem For A Dream.""(which I loathed, by the way) It's fundamentally about a man who can't leave behind the addiction that prevents him from living a normal life, and that will surely kill him sooner or later. ""The Wrestler,"" however, isn't the preachy, manipulative tale that ""Requiem"" was, but instead gives us a character who lives a life that few of us can understand, but whose peculiar, self-destructive desires we can sympathize with to some degree. The tale of the past-his-prime star clinging to the old days is a common story told many times before (though it is perhaps out of fashion of late) but Aronofsky and company have reconstructed compellingly, and brought it into a new age.""The Wrestler"" is wholly focused on Mickey Rourke's Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a washed-up pro wrestler who lives a simple, isolated life and still works the small-time circuit decades after his prime. Randy, nevertheless, seems quite content, until he collapses after a performance, and wakes to discover that he can wrestle no more, lest he risk a fatal heart attack. The film is then a character study, as we follow Randy's day-to-day struggles to develop a new life outside the ring, to reconcile his past and to resist the urge to return, no matter the risks.While it's always wise to consider critical darlings, umm, critically, Rourke is worthy of the hype. His performance is the opposite most critical favorites: it's a controlled, nuanced turn that is almost entirely devoid of the histrionic ACTING!!! that foolish critics adore. Equally significant, Randy is an anomaly in American film: he is a lower class white character who is portrayed with realism and sympathy. Both filmmakers and film critics tend not to have much sympathy for the working class/rednecks/white trash, and to the extent that lower class whites are portrayed positively, it is generally in how they transcend their background. (i.e. they lack the roughness and prejudice of their peers, and would've been middle class types, if circumstances differed.) Randy, however, is thoroughly white trash, and represents a different kind of intellectual divide: he is basically friendly and good-natured, but lacks judgment and self-control. He wants to get his life on track, to hold down a conventional job and to reconnect with his daughter, but he's so ill-controlled and has lived a bizarre life for so long that he knows little else. Moreover, his strange life has left him isolated. He has friendly professional acquaintances, but they're ultimately oddballs like him who live for the ring and little else.Two women, a stripper named ""Cassidy/Pam"" (Marisa Tomei) and Randy's estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) play the only other significant roles. (And Wood only has a few scenes.) Tomei is Randy's female counterpart and confidant, a stripper in her mid-40s who will also need to leave her life behind before too much longer. (Tomei, by the way, is so well preserved at 44 that she belongs in a museum or sideshow (""Gaaaazze upon the incredible woman in her mid-40s who is STILL HOT!!"") rather than a strip club.) Wood is merely a snapshot from Randy's past: she initially loathes Randy, though we don't entirely know why, before softening somewhat. With her we learn that Randy hasn't just hurt himself, though the precise details and reasons are never revealed. Though the film is obsessed with the past, it is firmly rooted in the present, and we see only the end results, not the causes. Nevertheless, the scenes between Randy and Stephanie are often sad and touching, as Randy tries to reconnect in his clumsy but sincere way.The ending will no doubt be a source of controversy for some. Some have accused it of being clich&eacute;d and obvious, but with this story there are only a few options, with each of them being somewhat obvious.

1237171,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B001TOD92C,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[15, 21]","As a fan of pro wrestling, and as a fan of a comeback story, I really had high expectations for this film.  Sad to say, I came away angry and disappointed.The only reason this film works at all is because of the amazing performance of Mickey Rourke.  Mickey pours his heart and soul into Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson.  He fills his performance with pathos, sadness, intensity, pity, and just about everything he has.  I can't think of no other actor who could really do this role and do it so well.  Even though the dialog is boring, Rourke manages to elevate it into something meaningful.  Reportedly, Nicholas Cage was originally slated to play Randy the Ram, but he pulled out of the production.  Cage is a decent actor, but he couldn't do what Rourke has done here.  Rourke has been through a ton of crap in his life, and that pathos comes through brilliantly in this performance.  Even though Mickey made a comeback a few years ago in Sin City (actually, he gave the best performance in that movie), this is his real comeback, and I hope it sticks, because he's really a great actor who has his respect back, and he deserves it.Aside from Rourke's amazing, heartfelt performance, this film is actually pretty awful.  The script is extremely trite, filled with boring dialog, cliched situations, no narrative flow whatsoever, and the only scenes that had any real life to them were the one in the bar when Mickey and Marisa have a beer, and one scene where Mickey is having fun with some customers while he works at the deli.  These scenes feel like they were improvised by the actors, and if that was true, I wish they had improvised the whole thing.  I was actually bored a lot of the time, which to me was amazing, considering the film had great potential.Marisa Tormei, a great actress in her own right, does what she can with the underwritten material.  However, most of the other parts are very one note (especially Mickey's manager at the supermarket, played rather snidely by comedian Todd Barry), and nothing really resonates at all in this film.  Aronofsky's direction is lifeless.  His documentary approach doesn't really work here.  There's no poetry in it.  I would have loved Clint Eastwood to direct this film, as it would have been a masterpiece.The opening of the film is really cheesy, perhaps deliberately so.  I don't know.  It's cringe inducing.  The film, however, does show the ""choreography"" of wrestling up close, and doesn't hide the fact that it's a brutal sport.  The matches may be predetermined, but those wrestlers are putting themselves through a lot of pain.  The hardcore match that Mickey is in is brutal and extreme, but isn't as bad as some of the actual hardcore matches out there (the man who Mickey wrestles in this scene is Necro Butcher, an actual hardcore wrestler in CZW (Combat Zone Wrestling), which gets a plug in this film).  Aside from that, the only poignancy you get from this film is from Rourke himself.  It's his film.The film is worth watching strictly for Mickey Rourke.

Rourke was nominated for an Oscar for best actor and won a Golden Globe for his performance.The story line is simple and straight-forward. Down and out, poor, the user of too many drugs, a failure at relationships, Randy only knows one thing: wrestling.

""I don't want to be alone."" Even though we are fairly certain how the film will end, we root for Randy along the way as he attempts to make something out of his life.

He will try to rejoin with her but there are many obstacles to overcome, barriers of hate and pain. On the other hand, his affective life is empty and so, he will intend to make plans with an exotic night dancer (the alluring Marisa Tomei) to start a new life far from the madding world. But - against all the odds - the ruthless reality will impose itself, regardless his sincere desire of self redemption.The most devastating sequence (to my mind) is when he decides to sign autographs and take some pictures with youngsters, the photograph and the camera preserve the corruption of the time, giving us the elusive sensation of a never ending eternity.Rourke is outstanding like this decaying and once beloved idol.

Never has a more ridiculous way to earn a living been turned into a story with so much dignity.And I watched it with such wrong expectations. Somebody said or wrote somewhere, that it is about an aging wrestler who fights his way back to shape, a basic re-surrection story, told only a few hundred times before.No, it isn't. It is as unpathetic as it can get without being unreal. Randy knows that he has lost and he does not whine. He has ruined his relationship with his daughter beyond repair. His hopes for more than friendly banter with a stripper are rebuffed. (Marisa Tomey gives us a highly credible stripper. After Randy comes bloody from a fight, she giggles and calls him the sacrificial ram, urges him to watch Gibson's Passion of Christ movie.) His future is non-existent. His body is at an end point. Randy the Ram takes the honorable route.A major asset in the film are the 'real' wrestlers, the men who make up the population of the movie, together with the audience. One must assume that the spectators are also real. The wrestlers are so incredibly normal, like your neighbors next door, despite all their fancy dresses and their weird paraphernalia, while the spectators are goof balls. (I used to be exposed to 'wrestling' on the TV screens of a health club some time ago. I never figured out why anyone would want to watch that stuff.)My normal daily paper, the South China Morning Post, wrote the fabulous head line: Rourke takes the Mickey out of Penn. Meaning of course that Rourke deserves the Oscar over Sean Penn in Milk.Let me say, I am neutral on that question. Both guys deserve it easily.(P.S. in the meantime the Oscar nominations are out and they are indeed both running for Best Actor. All considered I would favor Penn, as he impersonated somebody else, brillantly, while Rourke seems to be doing an alter ego.)And don't forget the great sound track, with an original song by the Boss and great rock and roll from Guns and Roses and others.",5,The suicide of the sacrificial ram,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,2003,"['remarkable', 'movie', 'Never', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'way', 'earn', 'living', 'been', 'turned', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'dignity.And', 'watched', 'such', 'wrong', 'expectations', 'Somebody', 'said', 'wrote', 'somewhere', 'aging', 'wrestler', 'who', 'way', 'back', 'shape', 'basic', 're-surrection', 'story', 'told', 'only', 'few', 'hundred', 'times', 'before.No', ""n't"", 'as', 'unpathetic', 'can', 'get', 'being', 'unreal', 'Randy', 'lost', 'not', 'whine', 'ruined', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'repair', 'hopes', 'more', 'friendly', 'banter', 'stripper', 'are', 'rebuffed', 'Marisa', 'Tomey', 'highly', 'credible', 'stripper', 'Randy', 'bloody', 'fight', 'sacrificial', 'ram', 'watch', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'movie', 'future', 'non-existent', 'body', 'end', 'point', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'honorable', 'route.A', 'major', 'asset', 'film', 'are', ""'real"", 'wrestlers', 'men', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'population', 'movie', 'together', 'audience', 'One', 'must', 'assume', 'spectators', 'are', 'also', 'real', 'wrestlers', 'are', 'so', 'incredibly', 'normal', 'neighbors', 'door', 'fancy', 'dresses', 'weird', 'paraphernalia', 'spectators', 'are', 'goof', 'balls', 'used', 'be', 'exposed', ""'wrestling"", 'TV', 'screens', 'health', 'club', 'time', 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'stuff', 'normal', 'daily', 'paper', 'South', 'China', 'Morning', 'Post', 'wrote', 'fabulous', 'head', 'line', 'Rourke', 'Mickey', 'Penn', 'Meaning', 'course', 'Rourke', 'Oscar', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Milk.Let', 'say', 'am', 'neutral', 'question', 'guys', 'deserve', 'easily.', 'P.S', 'meantime', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'are', 'out', 'are', 'indeed', 'running', 'Best', 'Actor', 'considered', 'would', 'favor', 'Penn', 'impersonated', 'somebody', 'else', 'brillantly', 'Rourke', 'be', 'doing', 'alter', 'ego', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'great', 'sound', 'track', 'original', 'song', 'Boss', 'great', 'rock', 'roll', 'Guns', 'Roses', 'others']",N/A

1237182,A3NV0G16V04FYM,B001TOD92C,"Jack Baker ""Beauty Will Save the World""","[2, 2]","The Wrestler tells the story of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a former wrestling superstar now at the end of his career and reduced to performing at small events for chump change.  The Ram lives in a trailer park and works part time stocking at a megastore.  His main focus at the beginning of the film is keeping his aging body in shape for the ring.  His life revolves around his workouts, visits to the gym, the tanning salon, and securing the drugs he needs to keep his pain and decay in check.  His only outside interest seems to be spending time at a strip club, where he has forged an awkward relationship with stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei).When Randy suffers a heart attack following a match, he is forced to reexamine his lifestyle and make some difficult choices concerning his future, both professional and personal.  He attempts to reach out to his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and seeks a deeper relationship with Cassidy (whose real name is Pam), and tries to forge a new life outside of the ring by attempting to work a regular job behind the deli counter at the megastore.The movie succeeds in its portrayal of the small independent wrestling scene.  The film uses actual wrestlers and locations, which really works to establish a real vibe.  The main appeal of the movie, however, is the performance of the three principle actors.  Without them, the story would be less compelling.  Rourke is simply outstanding as Randy, the aging warrior whose body is beginning to betray him.  Tomei shines as the single mother stripping to pay the bills, waiting for something better to come along.  And Evan Rachel Wood almost steals the show as Stephanie, Randy's college-aged daughter, trapped in a love-hate relationship with her often absent father.  The scenes between Rourke and Wood crackle with emotions, tender and volatile.The other thing I really admire about this film are the little details.  Randy drives a Dodge Ram van (natch), has an American flag (somewhat tattered) hanging behind his bed, listens to 80s hair metal, and wears reading glasses and a hearing aid when he's not in the ring.  He's Hulk Hogan if the Hulkster was broke and living on food stamps.  Small touches like this make Randy's world a very believable one.  The Wrestler is a well-drawn look at the downside of the American Dream, the downhill ride that sometimes follows success.  Even if you know nothing about wrestling, I highly recommend this picture, on the sheer strength of the acting performances alone.",4,"""Bet I Can Make You Smile When The Blood It Hits The Floor.

1237183,A1SAZB83QFR0W2,B001TOD92C,"JackOfMostTrades ""Jack""","[0, 0]","I'm not a wrestling fan nor a Mickey Rourke fan. I'm a movie fan and a literature fan. I really can't comprehend why people don't understand the core meaning and beauty of this film. It has nothing to do with professional wrestling. It has to do with reaching the roots of great drama, and that's why it is great.There are more complex and elegant plots in film, production values, and more intriguing characters in lots of good films--independent, Hollywood, and foreign, but The Wrestler--through whatever spirit passed through the vehicle of Mickey Rourke's soul--turns out to be a wonderful film for anyone who values the roots of tragedy and the roots of the human condition.Rabbit Run is a book like that; The Stranger is a book like that; Othello is a play like that.  None of these examples are particularly long or complex in relationship to their genres. For example, Othello is perhaps Shakespeare's most simple tragedy.But The Wrestler, like superior works of dramatic art--and with Rourke at the helm--hits humanity where it matters: it shows us our vulnerability; our desire for love and acceptance (even if we aren't good at getting them right) with other people and with society; it depicts The Wrestler's wish for dignity and thus our own natural wish for dignity, for recognition, for home, to be cared for and loved unconditionally--that is what the Wrestler wants.And he is no different from people who look nothing like him or live in worlds that ostensibly don't appear like his. The Wrestler takes steroids. Well, lots of women destroy their feet by wearing high heels. Plastic surgery for both sexes is an attempt to look younger or better, but in the end is all about being loved.Finding a home, a refuge, a sympathetic soul who will care about us unconditionally are values the Wrestler shares with most of us.  He just is at a loss how to find them, and this is ironic because that is just the way he is able to love others in his childlike way--whether they be fellow wrestlers, kids in the neighborhood, or old ladies at the deli counter. The Wrestler's true opponent is a world that doesn't have a place for the type of 'outlier' he is.  There is a reference to his being the 'sacrificial ram' early on in the film, and it's a perfect metaphor. He is at heart an innocent, so innocent that when a girl picks him up at a bar and asks if he wants to 'party', he isn't quite sure what she means.  Randy the Ram is kind to everyone he meets. He just hasn't learned society's game.This is not a complicated film , but the greatest speeches, odes, portraits, ballets, etc., don't have to be complicated, nor should they. It's the intensity that counts and if the intensity remains after the show is over, who needs anything longer? Yea, you can ask for more in art, but you just might get a whole lot less. And if you don't understand what this movie is REALLY about, you are missing a whole lot.",5,The 'meaning' and significance of The Wrestler,1243987200,"06 3, 2009",2009,2920,"[""'m"", 'not', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'fan', ""'m"", 'movie', 'fan', 'literature', 'fan', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'why', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'core', 'meaning', 'beauty', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'do', 'reaching', 'roots', 'great', 'drama', 'why', 'great.There', 'are', 'more', 'complex', 'elegant', 'plots', 'film', 'production', 'values', 'more', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'lots', 'good', 'films', 'independent', 'Hollywood', 'foreign', 'Wrestler', 'spirit', 'passed', 'vehicle', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'soul', 'out', 'be', 'wonderful', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'roots', 'tragedy', 'roots', 'human', 'condition.Rabbit', 'Run', 'book', 'Stranger', 'book', 'Othello', 'play', 'None', 'examples', 'are', 'particularly', 'long', 'complex', 'relationship', 'genres', 'example', 'Othello', 'perhaps', 'Shakespeare', 'most', 'simple', 'tragedy.But', 'Wrestler', 'superior', 'works', 'dramatic', 'art', 'Rourke', 'helm', 'humanity', 'where', 'vulnerability', 'desire', 'love', 'acceptance', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'getting', 'right', 'other', 'people', 'society', 'Wrestler', 'wish', 'dignity', 'thus', 'own', 'natural', 'wish', 'dignity', 'recognition', 'home', 'be', 'cared', 'loved', 'unconditionally', 'what', 'Wrestler', 'wants.And', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'nothing', 'live', 'worlds', 'ostensibly', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'Wrestler', 'steroids', 'Well', 'lots', 'women', 'destroy', 'feet', 'wearing', 'high', 'heels', 'Plastic', 'surgery', 'sexes', 'attempt', 'look', 'younger', 'better', 'end', 'being', 'loved.Finding', 'home', 'refuge', 'sympathetic', 'soul', 'who', 'will', 'care', 'unconditionally', 'are', 'Wrestler', 'shares', 'most', 'just', 'loss', 'how', 'find', 'ironic', 'just', 'way', 'able', 'love', 'others', 'childlike', 'way', 'be', 'fellow', 'wrestlers', 'kids', 'neighborhood', 'old', 'ladies', 'deli', 'counter', 'Wrestler', 'true', 'opponent', 'world', ""n't"", 'have', 'place', 'type', ""'outlier"", 'reference', 'being', ""'sacrificial"", 'ram', 'early', 'film', 'perfect', 'metaphor', 'heart', 'innocent', 'so', 'innocent', 'when', 'girl', 'up', 'bar', ""'party"", ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'kind', 'everyone', 'just', ""n't"", 'learned', 'society', 'game.This', 'not', 'complicated', 'film', 'greatest', 'speeches', 'odes', 'portraits', 'ballets', 'etc.', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'complicated', 'should', 'intensity', 'counts', 'intensity', 'show', 'who', 'anything', 'longer', 'Yea', 'can', 'ask', 'more', 'art', 'just', 'might', 'get', 'whole', 'lot', 'less', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'movie', 'REALLY', 'are', 'missing', 'whole', 'lot']",N/A

Another parallel, of sorts, is Rocky, but The Wrestler is grittier and considerably more real.

Evan Rachel Wood as his daughter seems overmatched by the others.

Also, the scenes with Rourke and his daughter (played by Evan Rachel Wood) are realistic and touching.A good film which shows the struggles in life that we all go through as we get older.

They lack the intelligence to know better, and they can't help but to rely on the familiar.  A broken down wrestler is in many ways similar to an old dog.  As Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Rourke) shows, however, there is one difference: If willing, an old wrestler CAN learn new tricks.The Ram's life is depressing.  He's a decayed professional wrestler whose end is near.  To pay the bills he has to all but beg a weasely supermarket middle-manager for extra hours at a deli counter.  End's meat, literally.  He has no real friends, no close family, and his health is declining rapidly because of the physical and self-prescribed chemical abuse he has endorsed over the years.  On the other hand, he's revered by his fellow wrestlers - a tutor, he's a living legend.  Oh to be King and pauper in the same day.Essentially ""The Wrestler"" is a professional wrestling biography - an expose similar to what Bouton'sBall Fourwas to baseball orThis is Spinal Tapis to the music industry.  It's the backstage meetings and the locker room pharmacist, a look inside the detailed structure and choreography that defines wrestling (despite what an infamously hilarious crying wrestling fan would believe - google ""crying wrestling fan"").  Low brow fun, a contemporary Coliseum.  That's the appeal of this movie.Not everyone ends up like Hulk Hogan, a rich, reality tv star with a masculine daughter who beats Jay Leno on ""chin-offs"", and may be a tranny...err...or much less a Governor like Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura.  A depiction of the dark side is different, with increasing injuries as diminishing skills and physical ability cause the vets to take more risks for an increasingly bloodthirsty audience.  Like O'Brien'sThe Things They Carried, The Ram shows us, through a brilliant portrayal by Mickey Rourke, that the life of an aging wrestler is often times dismal, and there are more than the visible, physical injuries.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention two things: One, the FACT that Rourke deserved best actor award over Sean Penn.  Milk?  Seriously?  Are you f'ing kidding me?  Highway robbery.  Two, Marisa Tomei is has some very erotic scenes, and looks awesome naked.Either way, great movie.

Rourke looks and plays the part convincingly. The fight scenes are sweaty and realistic; interesting also are scenes showing the wrestlers choreographing the day's fight action. This is a gritty down-to earth movie and somewhat of a downer, but worth a watch especially if you are a fan of wrestlig and/or like Rourke who seems to thrive in roles playing struggling losers.

I agree with the critics that single out the acting all around from this movie.I felt that the punishments of this movie too heavy handed, and without a moral for us to learn from, besides that life sometimes sucks, and you people have tough tales, that are from all corners of the earth. And that is what makes this movie special to me also. I am let down by the downness of the ending, the lack of resolution, yet I am rewarded with a part of humanity that was left to oblivion. Where is all the glitz, the glamour, and confidence that we almost took for granted for in wrestlers. Do they live like this? This sad, sordid man, without a bit of luck or much happiness to call his own. My god, I wanted to scream, and rewrite a happy story for this father, for this man.

1237199,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B001TOD92C,J from NY,"[1, 1]","Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"" is not only Mickey Rourke's best performance, it is also the director's best film to date--which means something if one looks back on the one time obscure masterpiece ""Pi"" and the gruelling exploration of drug addicton ""Requiem For A Dream"".Rourke plays burnt out, washed up wrestler ""Randy the Ram"" who is so addicted to the adrenaline high of professional wrestling--which actually takes more of a toll on the men involved than the deceptive cartoonish appearance of the sport would suggest--and takes on a tour of a lonely hell of has beens, crippled veterans of the ring, and the cruel lengths to which men will go to propagate the illusion of machismo for the viewing pleasure of pot bellied men and women who view them as invincible demi-gods of some sort.Randy is a man who has spent his life pleasing the Abstract Other--millions of Americans who rode on the high hog of the 1980's until that decade graciously ended and brought the authenticity of Nirvana or as Randy says in one of his more ""insensitive"" moments about the change in decade and atmosphere: ""Then that Cobain p*ssy had to come and ruin everything!"" In the ring he is a flaming giant, recalling the ""Rockers"" group I remember from watching Professional Wrestling as a child with neon green under arm straps, a warlike viking pair of ""shorts"", and greasy blonde hair which he continually tosses about in an arrogance which is all too easily seen through as the insecurity of a basically nice guy who is completely lost in the real world.Marisa Tomei plays his ""partner"", sort of, an aging stripper who like Randy has lost the balance between reality and illusion.  While her real name is Pam her ""strip name"" is Cassidy.  These two broken human beings are straight out of a Bukowski poem, only with a bit more hope: watch for the interesting commentary on ""The Passion of The Christ"" as Tomei recites a passage from Isaiah and looks at Randy, realizing he is also a sort of Christlike figure, even willing to get a staple gun put in his chest by a young man just starting out to give him his name in the sport.  He just wants to make people happy and goes about doing it in all the wrong ways.  The cinematography gives the feel of lower-middle class New Jersey with a stinking authenticity: after suffering a heart attack, Randy is forced to take a good look at his life and is no longer able to wrestle.  With mortality looming he makes an attempt to reconcile with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), who he simply never had time for during his period in the limelight.Wood gives perhaps the weakest performance in what is otherwise a nearly perfect film.  She pouts so much, looks so drawn and pale that one gets the impression she is trying to communicate the trauma of abandonment by her father a little too much.  And it's a little too perfect within terms of the plotline that she is a lesbian with an African American girlfriend: gee, could that have something to do with her rebellion against her Alphamale father and his cult of manly manliness?  This is the only weakness in the movie.The ending is not suicide.  It is not just despair on Ram's part or a desire to die, as many seem to believe.  With all his attempts at real human connection failed, he makes the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of his fans after delivering a speech which is really his epitaph.

Rourke has been great at recreating the role of the struggling loser or the the cool criminal. Unlike most Hollywooders who may have seen a boxing ring or heavy bag as a fitness trend, Mickey Rourke had roots in the sport since a young age, and it shows in the way he moves and acts. Not a phony tough guy at all.I think this screenplay was based on Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, a wrestler who fell from huge popularity and sold out mega-arenas to barnstorming the VFW circuit for a hundred a night or so. The tale of Jake the Snake is documented well in ""Beyond the Mat"", a fine documentary and a must for wrestling fans or followers of Americana or just the human condition.Rourkes ""Wrestler"" character is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a former wrestling superstar reduced 20 years later to living in a trailer, working blue collar during the week and moonlighting the occasional small wrestling promotion. Spent, overweight with a bad heart and bleached hair, Rourke plays has-been to perfection. Every move, every part of his day lives like a punishment for abusing his body and his fame  earlier in life. As ""The Ram"" tries to pursue romance with local dancer Tomei and renconciliation with daughter Wood, we bare witness to a pained soul and the public, who however smaller, still wanting what destroyed his health.Interesting is the parralell between Tomei's exploitation of her body and youth as a stripper and what Rourke is going through.It's a great film, even if I predicted the final shot about 2 minutes out. The script could have used a little work. Not much is done to show how ""The Ram"" became a high-profile superstar- he seems to lack any of the charisma that would probably have been needed to reach such a height.Regardless, it's one of the better films of late and somewhat of an anti-""Rocky"" with it's bleak message.",4,Better Acting than Script,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,1969,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'Body', 'Heat', 'Pope', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'little', 'known', 'Homeboy', 'Rourke', 'been', 'great', 'recreating', 'role', 'struggling', 'loser', 'cool', 'criminal', 'most', 'Hollywooders', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'boxing', 'ring', 'heavy', 'bag', 'fitness', 'trend', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'had', 'roots', 'sport', 'young', 'age', 'way', 'acts', 'Not', 'phony', 'tough', 'guy', 'all.I', 'think', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', 'Jake', 'Snake', 'Roberts', 'wrestler', 'who', 'fell', 'huge', 'popularity', 'sold', 'out', 'mega-arenas', 'barnstorming', 'VFW', 'circuit', 'hundred', 'night', 'so', 'tale', 'Jake', 'Snake', 'documented', 'well', 'Mat', 'fine', 'documentary', 'must', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'followers', 'Americana', 'just', 'human', 'Wrestler', 'character', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'former', 'wrestling', 'superstar', 'reduced', '20', 'years', 'later', 'living', 'trailer', 'working', 'blue', 'collar', 'week', 'moonlighting', 'occasional', 'small', 'wrestling', 'promotion', 'Spent', 'overweight', 'bad', 'heart', 'bleached', 'hair', 'Rourke', 'has-been', 'perfection', 'move', 'part', 'day', 'punishment', 'abusing', 'body', 'fame', 'earlier', 'life', 'Ram', 'pursue', 'romance', 'local', 'dancer', 'Tomei', 'renconciliation', 'daughter', 'Wood', 'bare', 'witness', 'pained', 'soul', 'public', 'who', 'however', 'smaller', 'still', 'wanting', 'what', 'destroyed', 'health.Interesting', 'parralell', 'Tomei', 'exploitation', 'body', 'youth', 'stripper', 'what', 'Rourke', 'going', 'through.It', 'great', 'film', 'even', 'predicted', 'final', 'shot', '2', 'minutes', 'out', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'work', 'Not', 'much', 'done', 'show', 'how', 'Ram', 'became', 'high-profile', 'superstar-', 'lack', 'charisma', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'needed', 'reach', 'height.Regardless', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'late', 'somewhat', 'anti-', 'Rocky', 'bleak', 'message']",N/A

Love is the most powerful emotion and Mickey Rourke, with the steady hand of Darren Aronofsky, was able to reach way down and tap it. I'm not afraid to admit that I actually felt love for the Ram character - and there is nothing formula about that. The character Rourke created had a reality and a humanity that made me feel his pain like it was my own. I suppose when you're able to recognize your self in someone else, the boundaries vanish and one feels compassion - one feels love.  The film really moved me, shook me up, and ever since I've seen it, just thinking about Ram stirs my emotions.  This touches something far deeper than sentiment. Mickey Rourke is wearing his soul on his skin (as pointed out by Suzannah Troy). Rourke has always pushed acting into the realm of ""the real world"".  He's done this to the point where the characters he's played have seemed to reflect his actual life - and, to a certain extent, his life seemed to be bouncing off into parallel fictions.  As an actor, he seems very technically in control of his craft, of the detail - but as a person, totally out of control when it comes to his life. He's acting and he's living on some very painful but mythic  level - that's what I think makes him so absorbing to watch. I found it so touching to watch this broken down wrestler, this action-figure hero, reaching out, trying to make contact with his daughter and with the Marisa Tomei character - with the feminine - but he was locked into his pain.  There is no ""Rocky"", Hollywood ending to this movie. Creating such a pure experience of reality out of something as fake and disrespected as wrestling is really finding the sacred in the profane - its finding somethin high in what would, on the surface, seem to be low.Aronofsky has created the setting and put his belief in a great actor (who has wrestled many of his own demons) to find redemption and give us all something profound and timeless.

For me, this praise shows how far we have fallen as a culture. We seem to no longer remember or appreciate movies with subtlety, intelligence, beauty, wit, grace, a good script, or good photography. None of these are in evidence in ""The Wrestler"". Instead we are given endless, overly long scenes of profanity and violence. It's geared to the lowest common denominator, as so many movies are today.Those who buy jeans with holes and dirt already manufactured in will probably think the movie is ""cool"". Regarding the protagonist, we should know by now if one leads a life full of stupidity and bad decisions, the outcome will be bad. Like, duh. So I won't dignify the movie with learned analysis, as so many misguidedly have. I might as well write a tome on Jack and the Beanstalk. Even the production quality of the movie was poor, with a grainy and shaky image (at least as I saw it in the theater; I haven't seen the DVD, so I can't speak to that). There have been many prize-fighter movies with great dramatic quality, but this is not one of them. For example, ""Champion"", staring Kirk Douglas, was one such movie among others. Another would be ""The Harder They Fall"". I would rate those 4-5 stars. The vast majority here gave the movie 5 stars. When you think back to all of the truly 5 star movies of the last 60 years, do you honestly think ""The Wrestler"" belongs in that league?  What? Actually have dialog with depth, subtlety or wit ?(i.e., something beyond grunts and trailer park profanity). Can't have that! Just have violent scenes interspersed with grunge for a couple of hours and everything is great! That's the formula for today's movies. I attribute the many 5 stars given to this movie to the long-term coarsening and dumbing-down of our society. Young people don't know any better because they are immersed in it from birth. That deadens their appreciation for anything more refined. They are not aware of the longer term descent of art and culture. Much the same could be said of today's music.

Randy ""The Ram"" lives out his days in second rate wrestling matches that are lesser than what he was once a part of in more highly energized events such as the WWF.Broken down, beaten, and trying to keep himself together he lives his life out of a trailer park trying to make ends meet between matches  and working an odd job at a large wherehouse grocery store(take your pick of large grocery store chains on the east coast).Randy soon has a life changning event, after a match...he has a major heart attack. All the years of abuse suddenly catches up to him. The pain meds, the steroids, the late nights on the weekends;he suddenly turns back to the only connection he has left to life, his only daughter,whom he has neglected so many years ago and attempts to re-connect with.His only other relationship is with a stripper (Marissa Tomei) he sees regularly, in the end he comes full circle. No triumphannt return, no theme song blairing in the back ground. Just someone trying to regain his pride and dignity,and with whatever he has left.This film is nothing more than a raw look at a life lost and the struggling of an individual.Superb acting by both Rourke and Tomei with a glimpse of light at the end of the dark tunnel. No happy endings, just a very genuine and truthful outlook at a life that was meant for greater things, but never meets it's peak.",4,"""I'm just an old broken down piece of meat and I deserve to be alone.

1237212,A75MSQQ3LN86Z,B001TOD92C,Josef Bush,"[2, 4]","It's not just a great wrestling movie, its a great movie about a class and group of individuals whose lives are based on and anchored in physical and sexual exhibitionism.  They cannot, and do not have sexual lives that are like ""ordinary people.""  Their profound narcissism prevents it.  It prevented the hero, Randy, from having the kind of conventoinal family he realizes late in live he missed.All of that aside, this is a very good movie, very well made.  It's a genre work, of course, cut from the standard fictitious cliche-printed oilcloth out of which Wallace Beery and his producer and director, contrived many 90 minute shows during the 20s and 30s.  These popular shows had certain standard elements which are listed clearly in the movie BARTON FINK: first, there is a down-at heel, probably rough-house brawler turned wrestler who is not an unlovable man, but who had a reverence for the suds.  Second, he is befriended by some entity through which his essential sympathy can be shown.  Sometimes it is a pre-adolescent child, usually a boy.  Or it might be an intelligent and affectionate dog.  Or might be a not-quite-elligible woman, an older widow; or perhaps a tom-boy or girl on the skids.  We would fall in love with them (whoever they were in whatever constellation they revealed themselves) and they would fall in love with him, which would lead us to love him too, and to invest all our interest in his bout's favorable outcome.  It's all pure manipulation, as it is here, and except for the color and a little profanity, not very different.  Beery, the Champ, would enter a match, and that would end the story, whether he won or lost, with a tear and a cheer.In this movie the sexual pairing of Rourke and Tomei is poignant in the extreme, because they are nearly of the same age -- which is to say, old enough to be at the end of their respective careers -- hers as a pole-dansing stripper, his as a small-time pro-wrestler.  The close camera-work alows us to watch and to compare the extremes to which they must go to display their still beautiful bodies.  Him as a performer in threadbare spectacles of an ancient sport that are little more than lower class sadomasochistic rituals of blood and sweat.  In an ordinary dive she twists and contorts her still supple, nearly-naked body in a number of exercises that are designed to provoke erotic interest in men who are busy getting drunk.  They are the same; they are exhibitionistic prostitutes of small income and smaller prospects.  And, as the basic story requires, they both have children.  And will, alas, fall in like.The director could not have found two actors better made to play these parts.  Marissa Tomei is thrilling to watch, beyond anything called for by the role.  Who knew she possessed dramatic beauty of that intensity?  You would have to be made of stone not to respond.  And he is the same, and for the same reasons.  He has that heroic and poignant look of the old Roman statue, the Boxer; that scarred face.  Those noble, slumped shoulders.  The wrapped forearms.  Watching this movie reminds you of the time you first realized you'd lost your looks.  And that they would never return.As I said, this is a very good, almost a great movie, and I mean it sincerely, but it is not a magnificent movie.  Not that it didn't do what it intended; it fulfilled all that could reasonably be expected of it, but it did not do more.  And for a movie this good, that's the challenge.  It did not go beyond its borders of likely possibility.  It did not at all explore Randy the Ram's allegiance to the brotherhood of Muscle.  I mean, although the brief scenes in the gym and in the locker rooms where Randy is surrounded by men of his own size and even larger, are impressive and exciting in their own way, they only very gingerly hint at what lies beyond.  What was the line, ""Why don't we all go take a shower together?""  And later, while Randy sits buying drugs from an athlete substantially larger and more astonishingly muscular than he is himself, what does Randy do but ask to see a ""display?""  He invites the man to pose for him, and he does, briefly in a two-stage arm spread which they both enjoy.  It's nothing new.  Everybody who's ever known any of these muscle guys -- wrestlers, footballers, fitness hunks -- knows that they share a covert physical intimacy peculiar to themselves, and the only way we can witness it, mostly, is in the world of GAY male muscle pornography.But, when you live in towns that have large communities of these kinds of super-big men, (or super-big women) you know that although they do not live lives quite like yours, they do live lives with others of their kind.  And so what I'm suggesting as a WHAT IF? casting stunt for THE WRESTLER, is that they replace the Marissa Tomei part with a male from the big male fraternity to which Randy belongs: The Gym Rats.  Hollywood is full of guys like that; escorts, dancers, tainers.  The great thing is, you wouldn't have to change a word.  Not even the camera movements.  They never play a real or conventional love scene.  Though their fooling-around has a tinge of intimacy, they are seldom if ever really alone.Randy's guy needn't be young, or even conventionally handsome.  Randy might drop into the Gay club (a third-rate Chippendales) where his friend Cassidy works to catch the show, or to ""Get a little dance.""  Happens all the time.  Later, he, the dancer could say as well, ""There are lines I cannot cross.""  And he might as well mean his own  children.  He doesn't look any less manly than Randy does, or dress very differently.  His dancer's costume and persona might be that of a wrestler, and we might learn that he abandoned his own wrestler's career because as a sole parent, he anticipated being seriously harmed in the sport.  Also, it would add greatly to the ironic contrast between their status as parents, when Randy says he thinks his daughter is a lesbian, if only because it would mean that their putatively Gay attachment confounds all their troubles.  Yes, its that little something that might add or might have added the little extra that could well have earned the movie the very highest honors if only because without underlining it or even mentioning it, Randy's inner conflict -- his diffidence and passivity -- could be made clear, and plausible.  Of course, its a degree of sophistication we can't expect from American movies, though the Europeans do it occasionally.  THE WRESTLER remains an enjoyable, simple-minded genre movie because it's central character remains a flat, one or two dimension character",5,"THIS IS BARTON FINK'S WRESTLING MOVIE, AND ITS

1237213,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B001TOD92C,Joseph Haschka,"[4, 5]","THE WRESTLER is the first film I've seen in 2008 which has my unqualified recommendation for an Oscar nomination, specifically for the performance of Mickey Rourke as the aging wrestler, Randy ""Ram"" Robinson.As the film opens, the camera pans over a montage of publicity stills and fight posters from the heyday of Ram's career in the 1980s. Now, it's twenty years later, and Randy is on the down slope of Over-the-Hill. He lives alone in a New Jersey trailer park. His only family is his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), and his only ""girlfriend"" is apparently the aging stripper Cassidy (Marissa Tomei) whom he pays for private dances in a local strip joint.Ram is a one-trick pony; wrestling is his life and livelihood, both of which are endangered after one particularly strenuous and bloody bout involving a staple gun, barbed wire, and a fork. Confronted with a fundamental change to his existence, the audience watches him cope with loneliness and a growing despair. Perhaps the most poignant scene takes place in a meeting hall in which he and other has-beens of the profession are set up at card tables to hawk autographed photos and other memorabilia to a dwindling number of fans. As he gazes at his graying colleagues with their crutches, ice packs, and leg braces, the pathetic nature of his twilight career hits home.As evidenced by the end credits, the film heavily involved professional wrestlers both as advisors and cast members. Presumably then, the depiction of the sport, if it can be called such, is credible. But it's obvious that professional wrestling, like stripping, is more in the nature of staged performance art. Yes, perhaps the viewing audience has always suspected this to be true of the former, but THE WRESTLER drives home the point with a revelatory cinema verite.Tomei does a swell job as Cassidy, who, off-stage, is single-Mom Pam with a nine-year old son. Cassidy isn't getting the requests or tips for private dances that she used to in her younger days, and her prospects for the future, though not yet as dismal as Ram's, suggest a similar slide. (But, I tell you what, Marissa Tomei pole dancing at almost 44 is Hot!)Ultimately, THE WRESTLER proves enormously sad. Yet, for any viewer who works for a living, whether it be at a blue or white-collar job, the realization must perhaps be that each of us is but a performance artist, and, if one is but a one-trick pony, the end of the show's run has the potential to be devastating if experienced without a human support net.I don't write movie reviews much anymore because most Big Screen releases aren't worth the effort.

Menta, Jr.","[1, 1]","""The Wrestler"" is a complicated, balanced, but ultimately sympathetic examination of the wrestling profession and one man who makes his living in it.  Regarding the profession, one thing especially struck me: although in scene after scene we're shown that most aspects of professional wrestling are fake, the injuries certainly aren't.  In fact, I started thinking that there would likely be a lot less injuries if there was less choreography and showmanship in the matches and more actual wrestling.  Another memorable scene showed a sad assemblage of broken-down wrestlers (some in wheelchairs) at a sparsely attended autograph-signing event.  I really felt bad for those guys during that scene, and clearly, so did the movie.Mickey Rourke's character is flawed but mostly likable, a man who loves his profession even though it really hasn't taken care of him as much as it should have over the years.  However, his misplaced devotion to wrestling is likely responsible for his hurts and failures outside the ring, especially his longtime estrangement from his daughter. In his view, of course, wrestling is the only thing that hasn't hurt or disappointed him, and the only thing that's given him consistent joy.The movie is raw, adult, and often hard to watch.  But it's also intimate and sweet.  You certainly don't have to be a wrestling fan to get something out of this simple yet surprisingly involving film.""The Wrestler"" looks and sounds fine on standard DVD.

This is an acclaimed actor giving the performance of his life, a performance that makes you want to cheer while never resorting to the obvious inspirational clich&eacute;s. The Wrestler is one of the top five best films of 2008. It's not grand, technical filmmaking but it was one of the most profound movie-going experiences I've had. It's entertaining and powerfully moving, coupled with incredible performances, a raw script, and a perfect directorial style.Rourke plays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, once a famous professional wrestler now reduced to playing small, local gigs to a small, nostalgic crowd. Randy lives in a trailer, struggling to make the rent balancing wrestling with a part time job at a supermarket. With no friends, Randy finds solace and human contact with a stripper (Marisa Tomei), whose job isn't unlike his. While trying to reconnect with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), Randy sees one final shot at the top in a re-match with the Ayatollah.It's worth noting that you don't have to like wrestling to love this film, although it does clear up some of the misconceptions about the sport. Wrestling is ""fake,"" in the sense that it's staged...But when you're getting hit with a chair or slammed to the ground, it's real. The film does a very good job of explore the thin line between ""real"" and ""fake.""What The Wrestler is really about is a performer who has no roots in the real world. He lives and breathes to be this character, it's all he knows. Only with a roaring crowd does he feel at home. This film is much deeper than its subject matter and title imply.There's so much raw, real human emotion here. It could've easily strayed into familiar or predictable territory, but Robert Siegel's script does not allow it. This is not an inspirational film about a down-on-his-luck wrestler, on the verge of a comeback who falls in love with the stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold. The film takes a bleak look at these characters and shows them as people. They're flawed, they make mistakes, not everything turns out all right in the end. All of this is handled masterfully by director Darren Aronofsky; strange, since this is his most simplistic film in terms of filmmaking style. The musical score by Clint Mansell isn't mentioned much in reference to this film, but it's really terrific. It's subtle and underscores every scene perfectly, adding to that bleak simplicity.As for acting, Wood doesn't seem far removed from herThirteencharacter as Randy's estranged daughter, but she does a good job with what she's given. Tomei got an Oscar-nomination for her role. She's certainly a brave actress, who looks stunning at 40. This is not an easy character to play, but Tomei brings believability to the role that many actresses would not have. It's a 3-dimensional character that could've easily been a 1-dimensional one.Now, let's talk about Rourke. What a performance! There's no hiding the parallels between Rourke's real life and the character of Randy the Ram, but don't think this is just Rourke playing himself. I can't express the level of disappointment I felt when Sean Penn's name was read as the winner of the Best Actor Academy Award. Sean Penn is one of the finest actors of his generation and he did an astounding job bringing Harvey Milk to life. But Rourke more than physically becomes Randy the Ram, he brings such life, such pathos to his character that I have no doubt in my mind who gave the superior performance of 2008. It's certainly the most affecting and most powerful performance of that year.There's a scene near the end where Randy is talking to the crowd and says ""...I ain't as pretty as I used to be...As time goes by, they say `he's washed up. He's finished. He's a loser. He's all through.' But you know what? The only ones who are gonna tell me when I'm through doing my thing is you people here."" This is the emotional climax of the film. This isn't just Randy talking to the crowd, its Rourke talking to us; the people who still care about him. I'm glad to have him back. He's not through yet and even though the film has ended...I'm still cheering.GRADE: A",5,The Best Male Performance of 2008 & One of the Top Five Best Films of 2008,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,4439,"['Made', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'visionary', 'director', 'ofRequiem', 'Dream', 'Director', 'Cut', 'andThe', 'Fountain', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Wrestler', 'marked', 'much', 'publicized', 'comeback', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Truth', 'Rourke', 'appeared', 'many', 'films', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'sporadically', 'comeback', 'much', 'grander', 'sense', 'acclaimed', 'actor', 'giving', 'performance', 'life', 'performance', 'want', 'cheer', 'never', 'resorting', 'obvious', 'inspirational', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Wrestler', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'best', 'films', '2008', 'not', 'grand', 'technical', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'profound', 'movie-going', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'had', 'entertaining', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'coupled', 'incredible', 'performances', 'raw', 'script', 'perfect', 'directorial', 'style.Rourke', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'once', 'famous', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'now', 'reduced', 'playing', 'small', 'local', 'gigs', 'small', 'nostalgic', 'crowd', 'Randy', 'trailer', 'struggling', 'make', 'rent', 'balancing', 'wrestling', 'part', 'time', 'job', 'supermarket', 'friends', 'Randy', 'solace', 'human', 'contact', 'stripper', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'job', ""n't"", 'trying', 'reconnect', 'daughter', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Randy', 'one', 'final', 'shot', 'top', 're-match', 'Ayatollah.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'like', 'wrestling', 'love', 'film', 'clear', 'misconceptions', 'sport', 'Wrestling', 'fake', 'sense', 'staged', 'when', ""'re"", 'getting', 'hit', 'chair', 'slammed', 'ground', 'real', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'thin', 'line', 'real', 'fake', 'What', 'Wrestler', 'really', 'about', 'performer', 'who', 'roots', 'real', 'world', 'breathes', 'be', 'character', 'Only', 'roaring', 'crowd', 'feel', 'home', 'film', 'much', 'deeper', 'subject', 'matter', 'title', 'imply.There', 'so', 'much', 'raw', 'real', 'human', 'emotion', 'here', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'strayed', 'familiar', 'predictable', 'territory', 'Robert', 'Siegel', 'script', 'not', 'allow', 'not', 'inspirational', 'film', 'down-on-his-luck', 'wrestler', 'verge', 'comeback', 'who', 'love', 'stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold', 'film', 'bleak', 'look', 'characters', 'people', ""'re"", 'flawed', 'make', 'mistakes', 'not', 'everything', 'out', 'right', 'end', 'handled', 'masterfully', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'strange', 'most', 'simplistic', 'film', 'terms', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'musical', 'score', 'Clint', 'Mansell', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'much', 'reference', 'film', 'really', 'terrific', 'subtle', 'underscores', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'adding', 'bleak', 'simplicity.As', 'acting', 'Wood', ""n't"", 'seem', 'far', 'removed', 'herThirteencharacter', 'Randy', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'given', 'Tomei', 'got', 'Oscar-nomination', 'role', 'certainly', 'brave', 'actress', 'who', 'stunning', '40', 'not', 'easy', 'character', 'play', 'Tomei', 'believability', 'role', 'many', 'actresses', 'would', 'not', 'have', '3-dimensional', 'character', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'been', '1-dimensional', 'one.Now', 'let', 'talk', 'Rourke', 'What', 'performance', 'hiding', 'parallels', 'Rourke', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'Rourke', 'playing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'level', 'disappointment', 'felt', 'when', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'name', 'was', 'read', 'winner', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'generation', 'did', 'astounding', 'job', 'bringing', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'life', 'Rourke', 'more', 'physically', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'such', 'life', 'such', 'pathos', 'character', 'have', 'doubt', 'mind', 'who', 'gave', 'superior', 'performance', '2008', 'certainly', 'most', 'affecting', 'most', 'powerful', 'performance', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'Randy', 'talking', 'crowd', 'ai', ""n't"", 'as', 'pretty', 'used', 'be', 'time', 'say', 'washed', 'up', 'finished', 'loser', 'know', 'what', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'gon', 'tell', 'when', ""'m"", 'doing', 'thing', 'people', 'here', 'emotional', 'climax', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'Randy', 'talking', 'crowd', 'Rourke', 'talking', 'people', 'who', 'still', 'care', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'back', 'not', 'yet', 'even', 'film', 'ended', ""'m"", 'still', 'cheering.GRADE']",N/A

1237220,AV9SRGPNOD73Z,B001TOD92C,JR Media Freak,"[0, 0]","I was very curious to see this movie.  I heard an interview with Mickey Rourke on Howard Stern, and I was intrigued with Rourke's love for the part and his work on the movie.  This movie chronicles the fall of a once famous professional wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson through ups and downs, injuries and victories, steroid abuse and drug abuse, sex and rock and roll.Let's be clear on what this movie is right up front.  This is a tragedy.  It has elements of a documentary in that it follows Rourke's character closely,so closely in fact that the pace drags at times.  However, the feeling of being behind the scenes of the wrestling world sparks the curiosity that overpowers the boredom for the most part.The insight one gets on the world of wrestling is very interesting.  There is a counter culture there that many of us are not exposed.  The steroids, pain killers, growth hormones, tanning, medical treatment and all of the injuries that go along with the world of wrestling.  Much of this is taken for granted by the average fan.  I know I didn't even consider or think of this when I was a fan of wrestling as a preteen.The message in this movie is very clear.  Many sacrifices have to be made to pursue your dreams, and sometimes those sacrifices are more than we can bear.  To be truly successful, one must remember to keep those sacrifices in mind and choose wisely.  In this movie the character of The Ram chose wrestling over his family, and he even sacrifices his body and long term health for immediate satisfaction and justification of pursuing wrestling.  Hence the tragedy that ends for The Ram on a high point...literally when he climbs to the top rope to finish off his opponent while having his second heart attack and probably his final blow.",4,Ends on a high point.,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,1768,"['was', 'very', 'curious', 'see', 'movie', 'heard', 'interview', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'was', 'intrigued', 'Rourke', 'love', 'part', 'work', 'movie', 'movie', 'fall', 'once', 'famous', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'ups', 'downs', 'injuries', 'victories', 'steroid', 'abuse', 'drug', 'abuse', 'sex', 'rock', 'roll.Let', 'be', 'clear', 'what', 'movie', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'tragedy', 'elements', 'documentary', 'Rourke', 'character', 'closely', 'so', 'closely', 'fact', 'pace', 'drags', 'times', 'However', 'feeling', 'being', 'scenes', 'wrestling', 'world', 'curiosity', 'boredom', 'most', 'part.The', 'insight', 'one', 'world', 'wrestling', 'very', 'interesting', 'counter', 'culture', 'many', 'are', 'not', 'exposed', 'steroids', 'pain', 'killers', 'growth', 'hormones', 'tanning', 'medical', 'treatment', 'injuries', 'go', 'along', 'world', 'wrestling', 'Much', 'taken', 'granted', 'average', 'fan', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'think', 'when', 'was', 'fan', 'wrestling', 'preteen.The', 'message', 'movie', 'very', 'clear', 'Many', 'sacrifices', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'sometimes', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'more', 'can', 'bear', 'be', 'truly', 'successful', 'one', 'must', 'remember', 'keep', 'sacrifices', 'mind', 'choose', 'wisely', 'movie', 'character', 'Ram', 'chose', 'wrestling', 'family', 'even', 'body', 'long', 'term', 'health', 'immediate', 'satisfaction', 'justification', 'pursuing', 'wrestling', 'Hence', 'tragedy', 'Ram', 'high', 'point', 'literally', 'when', 'top', 'rope', 'finish', 'off', 'opponent', 'having', 'second', 'heart', 'attack', 'probably', 'final', 'blow']",N/A
1237221,A10872FHIJAKKD,B001TOD92C,Just Bill,"[52, 69]","It's been a long time since I heard an audience gasp -- and choke back sobs -- at a movie's end. But I heard it, and felt it, watching The Wrestler. The screen cuts to black, there's a pregnant pause, and then Bruce Springsteen's haunting song ""The Wrestler"" plays. Credits roll. And people leave the theater, stunned.My wife and I saw the movie again yesterday. And I cried like a baby, again, the minute Springsteen started to sing.Why? Two main reasons:1. I felt for the protagonist, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. I put myself in his shoes, saw the world through his eyes. I totally empathized with the man. In fact, Mickey Rourke played the character so sublimely, with such utter believability, that he WAS ""Randy the Ram."" Because of that, what Randy felt, I felt. In effect, I became ""Randy the Ram,"" too.Sometimes, when you watch a movie it's difficult (if not impossible) to suspend disbelief enough to forget that you're watching an actor play a role. With The Wrestler, I never once saw Mickey Rourke acting. I never once saw any of the actors acting. It was like watching a documentary with real people.2. In many ways, The Wrestler is a metaphor for every person approaching middle age, when lives and careers wane, options fade, and a stifling feeling of desperation sets in. Randy's love interest in the movie, Cassidy -- played brilliantly by the incredibly talented Marisa Tomei -- felt it. Granted, too late to help Randy. But she felt it. She looked around at the patrons in the strip club and she knew what Randy felt every minute of his life -- in the end, time will beat us as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow.Desperation can drive a person do things he/she wouldn't normally do, take actions that may seem foolhardy, react in ways that another day and time might temper. It's a difficult emotion to portray on screen because pushed too far, it becomes hysteria. Too little, and it merely wallows.Reduced to its bare minimum, The Wrestler is a movie about desperation and the toll that emotion takes on everyone involved. It is a movie about a genuinely nice guy who's down on his luck and has nothing left to live for except (a) memories of his glory days as a pro wrestler, and (b) one last chance to re-live those days.I've read other reviews here, including a couple of them that condemn the movie's ""profanity"" or ""violence."" To those people, I can only say that there's no more violence in The Wrestler than in the evening newspaper or on the 6 O'Clock news. And I've heard more profanity at a hockey game.Whatever violence and profanity that occurs in The Wrestler is there because this is a gritty, real movie. There's nothing gratuitous in The Wrestler. Even the scenes in the strip club are real. Yes, you will see nudity. But not because it's a ""steamy"" Hollywood love scene; rather, because it's a strip club, where nudity occurs.I'm going to see the movie again (for the third time!) this afternoon. I'm going to buy it the minute it's released next month. Although The Wrestler is sometimes painful to watch (one wrestling scene, in particular, makes me squirm), it is the most genuine, un-Hollywood movie I've seen in many years. Perhaps ever.There's a line Randy speaks from time to time: ""Bring it."" As in, bring it on. Give me your best.The Wrestler brings it.

1237222,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B001TOD92C,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[1, 2]","To be honest I was expecting The Wrestler to be the Rocky of wrestling, but The Wrestler isn't that simple of a story. Rocky is more of a fairy tale while The Wrestler adheres more to reality and doesn't shy away from some of the truths of the world it shows.Mickey Rourke is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson whose glory days of championships and matches in arenas are a long gone. He now wrestles on the semi-pro wrestling circuit which is a weigh station for those wrestlers either on their way down or on their way up the professional wrestling ladder. They wrestle weekends in school gyms, the outcome of the matches is choreographed before they go on, but the toll on their bodies is the same as on the pro circuit of wrestling, and drugs are common to keep their bodies together. This is wrestling where the take from the door is split among 9 other wrestlers and doesn't even pay the rent on his trailer. This is wrestling not for the fame or glory anymore but for the love of the game, what the wrestlers lack in body and success they more than make up for in soul.Marisa Tomei is Cassidy, the stripper with a heart of gold, who is friends with Randy, his only friend, and the irony of their friendship is that they both use their bodies to make a living, although it seems lost to their characters.After a match Randy has a heart attack and he discovers how alone he really is, none of his from the wrestling world even go with him to the hospital, Cassidy has a life and problems of her own, and the daughter he's ignored most of his life and wants to have nothing to do with him, but she is willing to give him one last chance.The climax of the movie isn't your usual sports movie resolution, no exaltation of personal achievement such as in Rocky, no overcoming of the odds to emerge victorious, not even a climatic game that resolves all conflicts and issues within the film. The Wrestler is more about how we choose to live our lives with dignity and doing what we love even though the cost maybe too much as seen from someone on the outside. I can see why this movie appealed to Rourke, he is someone who lived his career as he saw fit according to his own rules, and he paid a price, but maybe that price was worth paying for the awareness and great acting Rourke is brings to The Wrestler.This DVD doesn't contain any bonus features.",4,A Body Slamming Return for Rourke,1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,2342,"['be', 'honest', 'was', 'expecting', 'Wrestler', 'be', 'Rocky', 'wrestling', 'Wrestler', ""n't"", 'that', 'simple', 'story', 'Rocky', 'more', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Wrestler', 'more', 'reality', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'truths', 'world', 'shows.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'glory', 'days', 'championships', 'matches', 'arenas', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'now', 'semi-pro', 'wrestling', 'circuit', 'weigh', 'station', 'wrestlers', 'either', 'way', 'down', 'way', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'ladder', 'wrestle', 'weekends', 'school', 'gyms', 'outcome', 'matches', 'choreographed', 'go', 'toll', 'bodies', 'same', 'pro', 'circuit', 'wrestling', 'drugs', 'are', 'common', 'keep', 'bodies', 'together', 'wrestling', 'where', 'take', 'door', 'split', '9', 'other', 'wrestlers', ""n't"", 'even', 'pay', 'rent', 'trailer', 'wrestling', 'not', 'fame', 'glory', 'anymore', 'love', 'game', 'what', 'wrestlers', 'lack', 'body', 'success', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'soul.Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Cassidy', 'stripper', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'friends', 'Randy', 'only', 'friend', 'irony', 'friendship', 'use', 'bodies', 'make', 'living', 'lost', 'characters.After', 'match', 'Randy', 'heart', 'attack', 'how', 'alone', 'really', 'none', 'wrestling', 'world', 'even', 'go', 'hospital', 'Cassidy', 'life', 'problems', 'own', 'daughter', 'ignored', 'most', 'life', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'willing', 'give', 'one', 'last', 'chance.The', 'climax', 'movie', ""n't"", 'usual', 'sports', 'movie', 'resolution', 'exaltation', 'personal', 'achievement', 'such', 'Rocky', 'overcoming', 'odds', 'emerge', 'victorious', 'not', 'even', 'climatic', 'game', 'conflicts', 'issues', 'film', 'Wrestler', 'more', 'how', 'choose', 'live', 'lives', 'dignity', 'doing', 'what', 'love', 'even', 'cost', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', 'seen', 'someone', 'outside', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'appealed', 'Rourke', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'career', 'saw', 'fit', 'according', 'own', 'rules', 'paid', 'price', 'maybe', 'price', 'was', 'worth', 'paying', 'awareness', 'great', 'acting', 'Rourke', 'brings', 'Wrestler.This', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'contain', 'bonus', 'features']",N/A

1237224,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B001TOD92C,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[5, 6]","I did not expect to like THE WRESTLER.  But this movie really surprised me.  Once you get pasted the endless punishment these men force on themselves in the ring, the brutal things they do to their bodies over and over again, there is a story told in THE WRESTLER that is definitely worth watching.THE WRESTLER tells the tale of a professional wrestler, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, very late in his career.  Wrestling is all this man knows, and 20 years after the fight of his life, he is still following the trail, picking up second-rate matches where ever he can, living paycheck to paycheck.  But then he has a major heart attack. He decides to give up wrestling, hook up with a stripper for whom he genuinely cares, and mend his relationship with his daughter. None of this works.  Wrestling is all he knows, and so he decides to go back into the ring, the only place where he feels truly appreciated and respected.Mickey Rourke does an admirable job as Randy the Ram, especially when you realize that he does all of his own stunts.  You genuinely come to like this character, and it is very easy to connect with him.  Rourke is dead on in his portrayal of a man whose professional image inside the ring is pure violence, but outside the ring, he is a gentle, kind person just trying to survive.  Marisa Tomei is quite good as the aging stripper, who has feelings for The Ram, but is not quite ready to admit to them.THE WRESTLER will give you a shocking look into the world of professional wrestling, and quite frankly is not for the squeamish.  The overall pacing is rather slow, and you have to be willing to just allow the story to unfold in its own manner.",3,He Died With His Boots On,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,1663,"['did', 'not', 'expect', 'like', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'movie', 'really', 'surprised', 'Once', 'get', 'pasted', 'endless', 'punishment', 'men', 'force', 'ring', 'brutal', 'things', 'do', 'bodies', 'over', 'again', 'story', 'told', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching.THE', 'WRESTLER', 'tale', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'very', 'late', 'career', 'Wrestling', 'man', '20', 'years', 'fight', 'life', 'still', 'following', 'trail', 'picking', 'up', 'second-rate', 'matches', 'where', 'ever', 'can', 'living', 'paycheck', 'paycheck', 'then', 'major', 'heart', 'attack', 'give', 'up', 'wrestling', 'hook', 'up', 'stripper', 'whom', 'genuinely', 'mend', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'None', 'works', 'Wrestling', 'so', 'go', 'back', 'ring', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'respected.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'admirable', 'job', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'especially', 'when', 'realize', 'own', 'stunts', 'genuinely', 'come', 'like', 'character', 'very', 'easy', 'connect', 'Rourke', 'dead', 'portrayal', 'man', 'professional', 'image', 'ring', 'pure', 'violence', 'ring', 'gentle', 'kind', 'person', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'quite', 'good', 'aging', 'stripper', 'who', 'feelings', 'Ram', 'not', 'quite', 'ready', 'admit', 'them.THE', 'WRESTLER', 'will', 'give', 'shocking', 'look', 'world', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'quite', 'frankly', 'not', 'squeamish', 'overall', 'pacing', 'rather', 'slow', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'just', 'allow', 'story', 'unfold', 'own', 'manner']",N/A
1237225,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B001TOD92C,K. Driscoll,"[7, 8]","Robin, or Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was, at least back in the 1980s, a very big deal and a major wrestling superstar.  Many years later and the Ram is way past his prime, but he still wrestles at gyms and high schools on weekends in and around Elizabeth, New Jersey.  During the days he works packing boxes at a supermarket and at night he goes to a local strip club and fixates on Pam (Marisa Tomei), who herself is a bit past her prime.  Randy has trouble paying his rent and seems dependent on painkillers.  Soon, in a match that is very difficult to watch and makes it quite clear the genuine sacrifice this kind of entertainment requires, Randy suffers a heart attack.  From there he begins to reassess his life overall because he cannot live and wrestle anymore.There was only a short window of time where I actually watched professional wrestling as a guilty pleasure.  Something along the lines of watching really bad movies but still finding some kind of appeal.  I was a huge wrestling fan as a child, so nostalgia certainly played a part.  I know enough about wrestling to know that guys like the Ram are probably very real. However, I mention these points to stress that I don't think I needed to ever be a fan of wrestling to enjoy this movie. It is just the backdrop of a compelling tragedy and charming bittersweet character.Darren Aronofsky (Pi,Requiem for a Dream,The Fountain) is an outstanding director and was probably robbed of a best director nomination, but I need to see all of the other films before I stand by that.  His films are all so different and The Wrestler is the ultimate example of a man making a film on his own terms, no matter the cost.  The film received two Oscar nominations for both Rourke's performance as well as Tomei's.  I'm not so sure Tomei's role necessarily lends itself to an award worthy performance but she is very strong. I think her considerable onscreen nudity and courage brought more attention to the part.  Evan Rachel Wood on the other hand, who plays the Ram's estranged daughter, was actually a standout.  She is on the verge of big time stardom if she decides she wants it.  The massive critical support for Rourke's performance is absolutely justified.  The combination of his work and Aronofsky's direction made Randy the Ram a strangely beautiful and tragic wounded animal.  Being a fan of Rourke to begin with helped and I cannot remember a better casting choice in many years.  He makes a flawed character extremely hard not to root for in the face of the demons he has created.  I found myself rooting for him again this Oscar season.2008 had been a year with many great films that were hard to compare to one another because they had been so dramatically different.The Dark Knightwas an action blockbuster and a psychological thriller for the ages, whileSlumdog Millionairewas original and inspirational, andMilkwas one of the best biopics we have seen in a very long time.  But the film that moved me most for 2008 was about a beat-up piece of meat from New Jersey just trying to find some level of meaning in the twilight of his life. A film that both solidifies the genius of Aronofsky and gives Mickey Rourke the performance of his career.  A very high recommendation indeed.",5,One of the Best Films of 2008,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,3265,"['Robin', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'was', 'least', 'back', '1980s', 'very', 'big', 'deal', 'major', 'wrestling', 'superstar', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'Ram', 'way', 'prime', 'still', 'gyms', 'high', 'schools', 'weekends', 'Elizabeth', 'New', 'Jersey', 'days', 'packing', 'boxes', 'supermarket', 'night', 'local', 'strip', 'club', 'fixates', 'Pam', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'who', 'bit', 'prime', 'Randy', 'trouble', 'paying', 'rent', 'dependent', 'painkillers', 'Soon', 'match', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'quite', 'clear', 'genuine', 'sacrifice', 'kind', 'entertainment', 'Randy', 'heart', 'attack', 'reassess', 'life', 'overall', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'wrestle', 'anymore.There', 'was', 'only', 'short', 'window', 'time', 'where', 'actually', 'watched', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Something', 'lines', 'watching', 'really', 'bad', 'movies', 'still', 'finding', 'kind', 'appeal', 'was', 'huge', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'child', 'so', 'nostalgia', 'certainly', 'played', 'part', 'know', 'enough', 'wrestling', 'know', 'guys', 'Ram', 'are', 'probably', 'very', 'real', 'However', 'mention', 'points', 'stress', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'needed', 'ever', 'be', 'fan', 'wrestling', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'just', 'backdrop', 'compelling', 'tragedy', 'charming', 'bittersweet', 'character.Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'Pi', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Fountain', 'outstanding', 'director', 'was', 'probably', 'robbed', 'best', 'director', 'nomination', 'need', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'stand', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'Wrestler', 'ultimate', 'example', 'man', 'making', 'film', 'own', 'terms', 'matter', 'cost', 'film', 'received', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Tomei', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'Tomei', 'role', 'necessarily', 'award', 'worthy', 'performance', 'very', 'strong', 'think', 'considerable', 'onscreen', 'nudity', 'courage', 'brought', 'more', 'attention', 'part', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'other', 'hand', 'who', 'Ram', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'was', 'actually', 'standout', 'verge', 'big', 'time', 'stardom', 'massive', 'critical', 'support', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'justified', 'combination', 'work', 'Aronofsky', 'direction', 'made', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'strangely', 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'wounded', 'animal', 'Being', 'fan', 'Rourke', 'begin', 'helped', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'better', 'casting', 'choice', 'many', 'years', 'flawed', 'character', 'extremely', 'hard', 'not', 'root', 'face', 'demons', 'created', 'found', 'rooting', 'again', 'Oscar', 'season.2008', 'had', 'been', 'year', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'were', 'hard', 'compare', 'one', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'dramatically', 'different.The', 'Dark', 'Knightwas', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'ages', 'whileSlumdog', 'Millionairewas', 'original', 'inspirational', 'andMilkwas', 'one', 'best', 'biopics', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'moved', 'most', '2008', 'was', 'beat-up', 'piece', 'meat', 'New', 'Jersey', 'just', 'trying', 'find', 'level', 'meaning', 'twilight', 'life', 'film', 'genius', 'Aronofsky', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'career', 'very', 'high', 'recommendation', 'indeed']",N/A

1237227,AHBKHBIWDTI5I,B001TOD92C,Kevin Mattingly,"[9, 9]","In a blazing triumph of American film making, The Wrestler is exactly what the bulk of films can never achieve; realism, intensity, sensitivity, regret, love, lust, redemption, and glory all in the same dazzling effort. All the while accomplishing what it sets out to be, and perhaps more, it is also the best character study that I have seen in years.The director is wise to waste no time in throwing you into the violence. If that's something that is going to put you off from the film then it's just as well that it's done at the first. That said, I didn't see this film as being overly violent. The violence is a necessary device used in the right moments to let the viewer know what the life of a wrestler, and this particular wrestler, is all about. The aftereffects are shown so it is not for the sake of gratuity.As I mentioned, the violence is limited. It only occurs in a few scenes that are very integral to the plot and it isn't lingered on, glorified, or depicted without realistic consequences.This film would not be half of what it is without the commanding, captivating, and soul rendering performances of the brilliant Mickey Rourke and always engaging and fascinating Marisa Tomei. Each one had their character in their guts and it shows on the screen.Rourke, in his true form and element, plays Ram. He's the battle scarred, drug and steroid-taking, estranged from his daughter wrestler who has seen better days years earlier when he was at the top of the card as a major star for larger promotions. He now finds himself on the wrestling slagheap and is working independent shows on the weekends for a wad of cash while living in a trailer and having to work at lowly jobs in a store through the week. Rourke runs the emotional marathon between extreme pride and respect on the weekends to the forced humility and the poverty of a working stiff at an entry level job during the week. To make matters less pleasant, his bosses seem less than sympathetic about having him around. Through this all, one can't help but feel the isolation, loneliness and pain of the character of Ram. The most affecting scene for me in this regard is when Ram is at an autograph signing with a bunch of obviously broken down wrestlers and there are very few fans and he just looks around and contemplates the desolation. It is one of the saddest moments in the any film. Mickey Rourke deserves every award that he was nominated for, including the Academy Award.Marisa Tomei plays a stripper at a club that Ram frequents and they have an obvious attraction for each other. Tomei's character is supposed to be past her prime and not one of the strippers who are in high demand due to her advancing age. The idea of men not being attracted to her was the only unbelievability about this movie. She plays the stripper with all of the charm that she can deliver with gusto but one can see the weariness in her eyes and a longing to be somewhere else. Ram is on friendly terms with her as he is a frequent patron of the club and he gets to go slightly beyond the ""don't socialize with the customers"" line that she has set up for herself. She is raising a son and does not want anything to detract from her focus to make a better life for herself. It is demonstrated that she certainly has an exception for Ram in her heart, if not physically.Evan Rachel Wood is the estranged daughter with which Ram is desperately trying to regain contact with and she wants nothing to do with him. He was never there for her as is the life of a traveling wrestler. Ram has a heart attack at one of the shows and is told that if he wrestles again that he may die and now his need to mend fences with his daughter is more palpable than ever and produces one of the most emotional scenes in the film.Despite the specter of death, Ram is offered one last big match. It is a 20th anniversary match with an old nemesis of his played by Ernest Miller. Ram briefly retires as he tries to get his life back together and after being rebuffed by his daughter and Tomei he decides that the people are his family and he's willing to risk death (shortly after heart surgery) to get back in the ring. It's less about the occasion and more about the pride.I'll let the reader watch the movie for the rest of the plot. I will not give away the resolution in a review.Darren Aronofsky expertly directed this film in a documentary style which makes it feel more like a documentary about pro wrestling than any actual documentary on pro wrestling to date. The lighting, mood, pacing, and performances are first rate. It's directed and edited in such a way that there is no wasted moment or emotion, and the viewer feels it.For this reviewer a further compelling aspect of this film is what it is like when two people, a wrestler and a stripper, who are each someone different at their work than they are in real life, get to know each other outside of those settings. This dynamic produces the Aurora Borealis of character acting by Rourke and Tomei that ultimately make this picture the masterpiece that it is.I give this all five stars and will probably watch it repeatedly.Kevin W.

The things that go on in their lives besides all the fighting and wrestling and roars of the fans. The family problems, health issues, and relationships.Mickey Roorke plays the role of a wrestler who has been doing the sport since the 80s. Before performing in an event being a rematch with one of his old aversaries, he experiences a heart attack. His doctors tell him to stop wrestling not matter what. In an attempt to not spend the rest of his life all alone, he tries to get back in touch with his daughter and tries to get a dancer to like him and be with him too. At the same time, he tries to make a living from working in a grocery shop.I see a lot of men choose fighting as a career just because they think its enough and fun and they also think they cannot have a job that starts from 9 till 5. Well, this is ok, but what if something goes wrong that prevents you from continuing the sport? What if you were so good at a younger age but couldn't perform as well when you got older? What if you have a family that depends on you and the money you make from fighting isn't enough anymore simply because the fans stopped like you like before? Is it really worth to sacrifice a real job that could have a bright futue (even if it starts from 9 till 5) in exchange for choosing a fighting career?

In an effort to build a new life, Robinson takes a job at a deli, falls in love with an aging stripper and tries to rebuild a relationship with his daughter.

This film is gritty, heart-wrenching, and a powerful piece of cinema. I cannot recommend this movie enough to any film lover. Mickey Rouke and Marissa Tomei embodie their roles and capture their protrayl with multiple levels of a master craftsman. The story, which is probaly relayed in mutiple reviews follows a once notorious wrester, protrayed by Rouke, who is failing in health due to the failing physical health of his body due to ""hard living"" and steriods. Tomei protrays a single mom who is working as a stripper. These two individuals have been beaten down by the hard realities of life, and yet are still in search of one ultimate goal--love. In so many ways, this is love story and a powerful one at that. This film should have taken the Oscar award for Best Picture, Best Director, Actor, and Support Actress, and there is no question about it. As far as the film and the script, they are cutting edge, and raw. I would strongly suggest the purchase of this film for any collection. It is by far the best of the films recently offered which is a rehash and recycling of stories that we so often seen. I would say, that not since MIDNIGHT COWBOY has a film tackle such raw emotions, and fleshed them out in a spectacular way. YOU MUST GET THIS FILM. Not at all for younger audiances. But I would say that it is a good testimony for how decisions can affect our lives, and how in each of our lives we reach the point of no return. For example, drug abuse, parenthood, and aimless line of sexual partners which all lead to a dead end destination.

Directed by Darren Aronofsky, this character study is a demanding role for any actor.  But it is especially poignant because of the inclusion of explicit wrestling scenes which form a backdrop for the development of the plot.This film is nothing short of a knockout blow.  It picked me up threw me down right into the middle of the world of professional wrestling.  There were points that I felt myself nauseated and repelled.  There were parts of the film that the physical tortures that these men put themselves through were impossible to watch.  But, at the same time, I felt the exhilaration of knowing that I was watching a truly great film which will linger in my consciousness for a long time.Mickey Rourke, now over 50 years, old, is cast as the aging Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson.  He had achieved a peak of success in the 1980's but now, 20 years later, he is no longer in the spotlight, but is wrestling in shoddy downscale matches which put incredible painful demands on his body.  He needs to wrestle for the money, and he needs to wrestle just because that's what he does.Supporting performances by Marisa Tomei as a strip club lap dancer who encourages him to reconcile with his adult daughter and Evan Rachel Wood cast in the role of the daughter are perfect.  Through his relationships with these two women, we see the vulnerable side of the man.The theme of this film has been done before and might have come across as stereotyped in the hands of a less talented director and lesser actors.  But The Wrestler was made by Hollywood's best, and everything, including the camera angles and editing was perfect.  I therefore give this film a high recommendation but it is certainly not for children or anyone who is uncomfortable with graphic violence.  It was even a little strong for my tastes, and that's saying a lot.",5,A knockout blow of a film that is both nauseating and exhilirating,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,1994,"['Starring', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'aging', 'wrestler', 'few', 'choices', 'left', 'make', 'life', '2008', 'film', 'already', 'been', 'nominated', 'numerous', 'prestigious', 'awards', 'Directed', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'character', 'study', 'demanding', 'role', 'actor', 'especially', 'poignant', 'inclusion', 'explicit', 'wrestling', 'scenes', 'form', 'backdrop', 'development', 'plot.This', 'film', 'nothing', 'short', 'knockout', 'blow', 'picked', 'up', 'down', 'right', 'middle', 'world', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'were', 'points', 'felt', 'nauseated', 'repelled', 'were', 'parts', 'film', 'physical', 'tortures', 'men', 'put', 'were', 'impossible', 'watch', 'same', 'time', 'felt', 'exhilaration', 'knowing', 'was', 'watching', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'linger', 'consciousness', 'long', 'time.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'now', '50', 'years', 'old', 'cast', 'aging', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'had', 'achieved', 'peak', 'success', '1980', 'now', '20', 'years', 'later', 'no', 'longer', 'spotlight', 'wrestling', 'shoddy', 'downscale', 'matches', 'put', 'incredible', 'painful', 'demands', 'body', 'wrestle', 'money', 'wrestle', 'just', 'what', 'does.Supporting', 'performances', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'strip', 'club', 'lap', 'dancer', 'who', 'reconcile', 'adult', 'daughter', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'cast', 'role', 'daughter', 'are', 'perfect', 'relationships', 'two', 'women', 'see', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'man.The', 'theme', 'film', 'been', 'done', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'stereotyped', 'hands', 'less', 'talented', 'director', 'lesser', 'actors', 'Wrestler', 'was', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'everything', 'including', 'camera', 'angles', 'editing', 'was', 'perfect', 'therefore', 'give', 'film', 'high', 'recommendation', 'certainly', 'not', 'children', 'anyone', 'who', 'uncomfortable', 'graphic', 'violence', 'was', 'even', 'little', 'strong', 'tastes', 'saying', 'lot']",N/A

The movie shows how he tries and fails in other parts of his life, with his daughter, with his girl friend, with menial  jobs and addictions.The tipping point comes when Randy cannot recover from a wrestling match that had him on steroids and other drugs, and a wrestling partner that could only do staples - that had to be removed after the match.  The painful removal of the staples and Randy's old body reacting to the violence with a major heart attack causes him to take stock of his life.  He tries to re-attach to his daughter, he tries to have family again with his only friend, a stripper, with a 9 year old boy, and he also tries to work a regular job.  Nothing works.His life and everything he knows centers around the professional wrestling world of choreographed fights and a culture of drugs and adoring fans.  The camera work frames his life of wrestling - even as Randy the Ram walks up to work at the Deli Counter- the camera works its way through halls that remind you of the walk to the wrestling ring.  This is a challenge for Randy and he does his best, but it does not work.  He cannot go to that level as a 50 year old fading wrestler.The story is poignant with his isolation and transparent hope to move on.  It is also interesting to get a real glimpse into professional wresting.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[35, 36]","Impressed by Mickey Rourke's Golden Globe winning speech, I decided to go see this movie.Randy 'The Ram' Robinson fought the Ayatollah in Madison Square Garden back in the 80s, and still battles today. Ill met by fate, bruised and battered, his sinewy muscles scarred, his bones creaking in protest he still has the fight, and like a One Trick Pony he sticks to what he knows.  It's a desperate life.As you may recall in Raging Bull, Robert De Niro put on about 40 pounds to play fighter Jake La Motta as he got older, and he won an Oscar for his dedication to the role.Mickey Rourke does something no less astounding here, putting on huge bulk to assume the persona and convincing physique of a professional wrestler.  It's the most amazing acting performance of the year.  The lines between actor  and character blur and disappear.  The kind of pain you see on Randy's face cannot be pretended. It can only be relived from the actor's parallel experience, which is what makes Rourke's performance so compelling.For female companionship, he goes to a local bar, where a fetching stripper played by Marisa Tomei, Academy Award winner for My Cousin Vinny, gives him a lap dance for a fee.  He can barely make rent, yet he has priorities.Marisa gives an incredibly authentic performance, and it's a welcome surprise see her take it off in the name of art.  I applaud her courage in doing so.  Her physique is simply amazing, and her body art is very intriguing.Evan Rachel Wood plays his estranged daughter.  Previously, she played the female lead part in Across The Universe, and already has a quite impressive filmography under her belt.  Here she sports a different look, and gives a perfect performance.Some of the wrestling sequences are truly outrageous, and not a little disturbing.  Having cut my finger on a ham slicer early in life, seeing people operating ham slicers gives me the heebie jeebies.  If you have a problem with the sight of blood,  I caution you that there are some disturbing sequences in the movie.The Academy's actor awards tend to go to actors in two types of role:1.Psychopath- No Country for Old Men, The Usual Suspects, There Will Be Blood, Training Day, Silence of the Lambs.2.Mentally Disabled, Social or Physical Handicap, overcomes great adversity or discrimination- Shine, As Good as It Gets, A Beautiful Mind, Ray, Scent of a Woman, Capote, Philadelphia, The Pianist, A Beautiful Life.Randy definitely has a handicap, and last year was the year of the psychopath, with both Daniel Day Lewis, and Javier Bardem winning Oscar.I hope you find this helpful.",5,The fighter still remains,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,2589,"['Impressed', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'winning', 'speech', 'decided', 'go', 'see', 'movie.Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'fought', 'Ayatollah', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'back', '80s', 'still', 'battles', 'today', 'Ill', 'met', 'fate', 'bruised', 'battered', 'sinewy', 'muscles', 'scarred', 'bones', 'creaking', 'protest', 'still', 'fight', 'One', 'Trick', 'Pony', 'what', 'desperate', 'life.As', 'may', 'recall', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'put', '40', 'pounds', 'play', 'fighter', 'Jake', 'La', 'Motta', 'got', 'older', 'won', 'Oscar', 'dedication', 'role.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'something', 'no', 'less', 'astounding', 'here', 'putting', 'huge', 'bulk', 'assume', 'persona', 'convincing', 'physique', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'most', 'amazing', 'acting', 'performance', 'year', 'lines', 'actor', 'character', 'blur', 'disappear', 'kind', 'pain', 'see', 'Randy', 'face', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'pretended', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'relived', 'actor', 'parallel', 'experience', 'what', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'so', 'compelling.For', 'female', 'companionship', 'local', 'bar', 'where', 'fetching', 'stripper', 'played', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Vinny', 'lap', 'dance', 'fee', 'can', 'barely', 'make', 'rent', 'yet', 'priorities.Marisa', 'incredibly', 'authentic', 'performance', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'see', 'take', 'off', 'name', 'art', 'applaud', 'courage', 'doing', 'so', 'physique', 'simply', 'amazing', 'body', 'art', 'very', 'intriguing.Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Previously', 'played', 'female', 'lead', 'part', 'Across', 'Universe', 'already', 'quite', 'impressive', 'filmography', 'belt', 'Here', 'sports', 'different', 'look', 'perfect', 'performance.Some', 'wrestling', 'sequences', 'are', 'truly', 'outrageous', 'not', 'little', 'disturbing', 'Having', 'cut', 'finger', 'ham', 'slicer', 'early', 'life', 'seeing', 'people', 'operating', 'ham', 'slicers', 'heebie', 'jeebies', 'have', 'problem', 'sight', 'blood', 'caution', 'are', 'disturbing', 'sequences', 'movie.The', 'Academy', 'actor', 'awards', 'tend', 'go', 'actors', 'two', 'types', 'role:1.Psychopath-', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Training', 'Day', 'Silence', 'Lambs.2.Mentally', 'Disabled', 'Social', 'Physical', 'Handicap', 'overcomes', 'great', 'adversity', 'discrimination-', 'Shine', 'As', 'Good', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Ray', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Capote', 'Philadelphia', 'Pianist', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Life.Randy', 'definitely', 'handicap', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'year', 'psychopath', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'winning', 'Oscar.I', 'hope', 'find', 'helpful']",N/A

Mickey Rourke fully deserved his Oscar nomination in a role that challenges Raging Bull as the best use of athletics as a metaphor for deeper human issues.I found the ending sober, truthful, and redemptive -- in the sense that it showed a real human being reacting in a believable way to the irrationality of life and the rewarding, yet difficult task of having meaningful relationships with other human beings. It doesn't take much imagination to realize that we all make bad decisions in our lives -- the decisions that keep us in bad marriages (and maybe put us there), decisions that reflect choices that we later regret (like spending more time at the office than with our children, or being dishonest rather than confront a painful issue), or decisions that get derailed by illness, handicap, or subconscious motivations. Just because ""the Ram"" makes some rather large mistakes, they are little different in kind and spirit from the mistakes that all of us with some frequency. Ram is the athlete as metaphor -- facing the abyss when his body wears out. Provided we don't beat our bodies to a pulp, we'll face the abyss later. But the lessons are entirely apt.And if you think Randy ended up in the same place as he started -- which might appear to be true on the surface to be true -- I think you've missed his subtle transformation into someone who realizes that life and relationships can't be tied up into little bows, that the promise of love is mostly a dream that only sometimes ends well, that he doesn't have the energy or faith to face and try to overcome his psychological and emotional handicaps, and that life begins, and ends, alone. His courage in stepping into the ring that last time is a celebration of man as an individual -- rushing headlong into the irrationality of existence, seizing the moment, and being okay with it. And when it's your turn to die, and you lie there alone, and all spidery filaments of faith start to unwind in the face of a terminal sleep, will you have the courage to be alone and step forcefully into the unknown? That, I think, is what Randy did -- and it's inspiring.",5,"Gritty, insightful, real.",1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,2307,"['real', 'testament', 'just', 'how', 'lame', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'have', 'become', 'idiotic', 'piece', 'trip', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Wrestler', 'overlooked', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'fully', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'best', 'use', 'athletics', 'metaphor', 'deeper', 'human', 'issues.I', 'found', 'ending', 'sober', 'truthful', 'redemptive', 'sense', 'showed', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'reacting', 'believable', 'way', 'irrationality', 'life', 'rewarding', 'yet', 'difficult', 'task', 'having', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'other', 'human', 'beings', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'imagination', 'realize', 'make', 'bad', 'decisions', 'lives', 'decisions', 'keep', 'bad', 'marriages', 'maybe', 'put', 'decisions', 'reflect', 'choices', 'later', 'regret', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'office', 'children', 'being', 'dishonest', 'rather', 'confront', 'painful', 'issue', 'decisions', 'get', 'derailed', 'illness', 'handicap', 'subconscious', 'motivations', 'Just', 'Ram', 'rather', 'large', 'mistakes', 'are', 'little', 'different', 'kind', 'spirit', 'mistakes', 'frequency', 'Ram', 'athlete', 'metaphor', 'facing', 'abyss', 'when', 'body', 'out', 'Provided', 'do', ""n't"", 'beat', 'bodies', 'pulp', ""'ll"", 'face', 'abyss', 'later', 'lessons', 'are', 'entirely', 'apt.And', 'think', 'Randy', 'ended', 'up', 'same', 'place', 'started', 'might', 'appear', 'be', 'true', 'surface', 'be', 'true', 'think', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'subtle', 'transformation', 'someone', 'who', 'life', 'relationships', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'tied', 'up', 'little', 'bows', 'promise', 'love', 'mostly', 'dream', 'only', 'sometimes', 'well', ""n't"", 'have', 'energy', 'faith', 'face', 'try', 'overcome', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'handicaps', 'life', 'begins', 'alone', 'courage', 'stepping', 'ring', 'last', 'time', 'celebration', 'man', 'individual', 'rushing', 'headlong', 'irrationality', 'existence', 'seizing', 'moment', 'being', 'when', 'turn', 'die', 'lie', 'there', 'alone', 'spidery', 'filaments', 'faith', 'start', 'unwind', 'face', 'terminal', 'sleep', 'will', 'have', 'courage', 'be', 'alone', 'step', 'forcefully', 'unknown', 'think', 'what', 'Randy', 'did', 'inspiring']",N/A

I am quite touched that so many people gave this 5 stars. But me thinks it is not. Not quite.  I think the one scene of Mickey's self mutilation in the deli was very unecessary and in fact is the action of a psycho. Only Rourkes charisma could get one to overlook that. Also, I cant put my finger on it but something is missing in this movie. Its like the last Rocky movie where a man well past his prime does it one more time, but...???I think it was rediculous how badly his daughter treated him for one mistake. She was no great shakes as an actor either. Marissa should have been his Adrian and not deserted him. Her character needed more depth and since strippers always go for the wrong guy....she was supposed to fall madly in love with Rourke! A better ending would be where he marries her, she gets pregnant, he goes back to wrestling for one more big score and dies in the ring. There just needed to be a bit more depth in this. And realistic or not, every woman I spoke to that saw this, couldnt watch the whole thing. They got sick from the blood. Truthfully I think we are all Rourke junkies and if he makes a remake of Lassie, we'd all rush to see it!  I saw it 3 times and thats my limit for this year. In the end though, its a must see for any Rourke fan. I'd give my eye teeth to see him team up with Eric Roberts one more time.

1237239,A2P2JXU9JEYNV3,B001TOD92C,"Marian M. Matsunaga ""karma""","[0, 1]","I picked up this film on the strength of Mickey Rourke's presence and Darren Aronofsky's directing. I admit to being ignorant of Professional Wrestling (and titty bars, for that matter), but Aronofsky does a fine job of bringing all the violence and pain that is the stock in trade of this sport to vivid and extremely uncomfortable life.That Rourke came from these beginnings to ultimately play that which got him started in the first place must feel like coming full-circle for him.I couldn't believe the size of some of these guys. A couple looked like puffed-up aliens. The hormone and drug cocktails these guys take MUST have detrimental effects, yes?! The life itself is the saddest thing about this film. These men have forsaken everything to be what they are, but being known is not the same as being respected. Rourke's character's private life is evident of that.While I am not as neurotic as the woman at the deli counter wanting EXACT weight, I darn sure wouldn't take that kind of crap, either! As for his boss, I'd want to pinch his head at the neck and pump his carcass with helium so I could float him out the window (WOW! this film affected me more than I thought!)!Darren Aronofsky does not do films that require no thought, and ""The Wrestler"" does not disappoint here, either. How much is fake and how much is real? Well, you get your answer.  That Rourke was made for this film is unequivocal. Some have said ""The Wrestler"" has a docu-drama feel, and they're right, but it doesn't take ANYTHING away from what is presented on-screen. In fact, if it didn't possess that feel, I don't believe it would have been as good as it is.Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood play the two women in Randy's life, and he just can't seem to make things jell with the two of them. He has the best of intentions, but as they say, sometimes, even that is not enough. What comes across here are people who have been stunted in their growth as human beings. For whatever reasons, they just can't make that leap that would allow them to join the human race. Wood plays conflicted emotion VERY well!For the few bucks I paid for this film, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. Then again, with Rourke pounding on the hood, and Aronofsky driving, why wouldn't there be?!",4,RAMJAMRAMJAMRAMJAM!!!!!!!!!!!!,1241481600,"05 5, 2009",2009,2269,"['picked', 'up', 'film', 'strength', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'presence', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'directing', 'admit', 'being', 'ignorant', 'Professional', 'Wrestling', 'titty', 'bars', 'matter', 'Aronofsky', 'fine', 'job', 'bringing', 'violence', 'pain', 'stock', 'trade', 'sport', 'vivid', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'life.That', 'Rourke', 'came', 'beginnings', 'ultimately', 'play', 'got', 'started', 'first', 'place', 'must', 'feel', 'coming', 'full-circle', 'him.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'size', 'guys', 'couple', 'looked', 'puffed-up', 'aliens', 'hormone', 'drug', 'cocktails', 'guys', 'take', 'MUST', 'have', 'detrimental', 'effects', 'yes', 'life', 'saddest', 'thing', 'film', 'men', 'have', 'forsaken', 'everything', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'being', 'known', 'not', 'same', 'being', 'respected', 'Rourke', 'character', 'private', 'life', 'evident', 'that.While', 'am', 'not', 'as', 'neurotic', 'woman', 'deli', 'counter', 'wanting', 'EXACT', 'weight', 'darn', 'sure', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'kind', 'crap', 'either', 'boss', ""'d"", 'want', 'pinch', 'head', 'neck', 'pump', 'carcass', 'helium', 'could', 'float', 'out', 'window', 'WOW', 'film', 'affected', 'more', 'thought', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'not', 'do', 'films', 'require', 'thought', 'Wrestler', 'not', 'disappoint', 'here', 'either', 'How', 'much', 'fake', 'how', 'much', 'real', 'Well', 'get', 'answer', 'Rourke', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'unequivocal', 'have', 'said', 'Wrestler', 'docu-drama', 'feel', ""'re"", 'right', ""n't"", 'take', 'ANYTHING', 'away', 'what', 'presented', 'on-screen', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'possess', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'Tomei', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'play', 'two', 'women', 'Randy', 'life', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'things', 'jell', 'two', 'best', 'intentions', 'say', 'sometimes', 'even', 'not', 'enough', 'What', 'here', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'stunted', 'growth', 'human', 'beings', 'reasons', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'leap', 'would', 'allow', 'join', 'human', 'race', 'Wood', 'plays', 'conflicted', 'emotion', 'VERY', 'well', 'few', 'bucks', 'paid', 'film', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'quality', 'Then', 'again', 'Rourke', 'pounding', 'hood', 'Aronofsky', 'driving', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'there', 'be']",N/A

1237241,A36EW68H08UOCS,B001TOD92C,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[6, 6]","I can't think of Mickey Rourke and not remember his work two decades ago in films like 9 1/2 weeks and Angel Heart and The Pope of Greenwich Village.  He was a handsome ""Bad Boy"" and seemed to be on a career arc similar to Johnny Depp and Robert Downey, Jr.  The story goes that he was quite difficult to work with, and he lost acting opportunities.  He became a professional boxer and went undefeated in eight international bouts, but took enough of a beating that his handsome face is substantially different.Darren Aronofsky (of the brilliant ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" and the not universally embraced ""The Fountain"") directs Rourke in a documentary-style film that positions Mickey Rourke perfectly in the role of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a professional wrestler who is way over the hill.The Ram was big - headline wrestler at Madison Square Garden big - but 20 years after his famous bout with ""The Ayatollah"", Randy wrestles small-time matches in little gyms and community centers surrounded by a crowd of a few hundred.  He lives alone in a small trailer park, and finds himself locked out early in the film, presumably because he's behind on his rent.  After he gets a few dollars into his hands from a wrestling match, he heads to bars and his favorite strip club.  Not long after he's locked out of his apartment he spends 60 dollars on a lap dance.Randy is over the hill in just about every way that a person can be.  He has a daughter who hates him for all the fathering he didn't do, and his heart, punished by his lifestyle and the pharmacy he pumps in so that he can wrestle, doesn't have that many ticks left.  After a heart attack his kindly Doctor advises him that he just simply can NOT wrestle any more.Randy is initially compliant and takes a more permanent job from a snippety little man who has been giving him part-time work.  The Ram pushes his flowing rock `n' roll mane up under a hair net and works at the deli counter, slicing cheese and ham and doling out pasta salad into little plastic containers.Marisa Tomei, another performer with a reputation for being ""difficult"", does amazing work here as the stripper with a heart.  She plays Pam, who has the stage name ""Cassidy"", and she has a soft place in her heart for Randy, even if he is beat up, ten years older, and tosses out young roughnecks when they're disrespectful to Cassidy, even if they were going to be paying customers.  But Pam also keeps Randy at arm's length, and for much of the film you don't know if it is because she was only pretending to like him or because she believes in the stripper's rule of not dating customers.Wrestling, we learn at an age slightly older than the age where we find out about Santa and the Easter Bunny, is fake - and some of the most interesting scenes in the film are seeing the buddy-buddy behemoth wrestlers backstage discussing the fake carnage they're going to enact in the ring.  Like much of the entertainment biz, ""making it"" in wrestling is not so much dependent on talent as coming up with a gimmick to hook the audience.  Randy has his famous ""Ram Jam"", diving off of the top ropes in the corner of the ring onto a prone opponent.  Before one match Randy's opponent asks him if he's ""okay with the staples"".  ""Staples?"" Randy asks.  ""Staple gun.  Doesn't hurt that much going in, except a little scary, you know.  Gonna leave marks - a little blood loss.""  So, although we're reminded that the outcomes of the wrestling matches are fake - decided beforehand, usually in favor of ""The Face"" and against ""The Heel"", but the little details like staples and blood aren't faked.The best scenes in the film are when Randy is out in the real world, trying to find a foothold in the parts of his life he knows should be important.  But the choices he made that allowed him to become ""Randy the Ram"" have left gaping holes he is unable to repair, and Rourke's acting job makes this pathetic man a completely sympathetic character.  I found myself hoping that Randy's fragile heart would keep ticking long enough for him to reconcile with his daughter and break through Pam's faade.",5,A Perfect Marriage of Actor and Role,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,4116,"['ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'not', 'remember', 'work', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'films', '9', '1/2', 'weeks', 'Angel', 'Heart', 'Pope', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'was', 'handsome', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'seemed', 'be', 'career', 'arc', 'similar', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'story', 'was', 'quite', 'difficult', 'work', 'lost', 'acting', 'opportunities', 'became', 'professional', 'boxer', 'went', 'undefeated', 'eight', 'international', 'bouts', 'took', 'enough', 'beating', 'handsome', 'face', 'substantially', 'different.Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'brilliant', 'Pi', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'not', 'universally', 'embraced', 'Fountain', 'Rourke', 'documentary-style', 'film', 'positions', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'who', 'way', 'hill.The', 'Ram', 'was', 'big', 'headline', 'wrestler', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'big', '20', 'years', 'famous', 'bout', 'Ayatollah', 'Randy', 'small-time', 'matches', 'little', 'gyms', 'community', 'centers', 'surrounded', 'crowd', 'few', 'hundred', 'alone', 'small', 'trailer', 'park', 'locked', 'out', 'early', 'film', 'presumably', 'rent', 'few', 'dollars', 'hands', 'wrestling', 'match', 'bars', 'favorite', 'strip', 'club', 'Not', 'long', 'locked', 'apartment', '60', 'dollars', 'lap', 'dance.Randy', 'hill', 'just', 'way', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'daughter', 'who', 'fathering', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'heart', 'punished', 'lifestyle', 'pharmacy', 'so', 'can', 'wrestle', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'ticks', 'left', 'heart', 'attack', 'kindly', 'Doctor', 'just', 'simply', 'can', 'NOT', 'wrestle', 'more.Randy', 'initially', 'compliant', 'more', 'permanent', 'job', 'snippety', 'little', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'giving', 'part-time', 'work', 'Ram', 'flowing', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'mane', 'up', 'hair', 'net', 'deli', 'counter', 'slicing', 'cheese', 'ham', 'doling', 'out', 'pasta', 'salad', 'little', 'plastic', 'containers.Marisa', 'Tomei', 'performer', 'reputation', 'being', 'difficult', 'amazing', 'work', 'here', 'stripper', 'heart', 'Pam', 'who', 'stage', 'name', 'Cassidy', 'soft', 'place', 'heart', 'Randy', 'even', 'beat', 'up', 'ten', 'years', 'older', 'out', 'young', 'roughnecks', 'when', ""'re"", 'disrespectful', 'Cassidy', 'even', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'paying', 'customers', 'Pam', 'also', 'Randy', 'arm', 'length', 'much', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'only', 'pretending', 'like', 'stripper', 'rule', 'not', 'dating', 'customers.Wrestling', 'learn', 'age', 'slightly', 'older', 'age', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'Santa', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'fake', 'most', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'seeing', 'buddy-buddy', 'behemoth', 'wrestlers', 'backstage', 'discussing', 'fake', 'carnage', ""'re"", 'going', 'enact', 'ring', 'much', 'entertainment', 'biz', 'making', 'wrestling', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'dependent', 'talent', 'coming', 'up', 'gimmick', 'hook', 'audience', 'Randy', 'famous', 'Ram', 'Jam', 'diving', 'top', 'ropes', 'corner', 'ring', 'prone', 'opponent', 'one', 'match', 'Randy', 'opponent', 'okay', 'staples', 'Staples', 'Randy', 'Staple', 'gun', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'much', 'going', 'little', 'scary', 'know', 'Gon', 'leave', 'marks', 'little', 'blood', 'loss', 'So', ""'re"", 'reminded', 'outcomes', 'wrestling', 'matches', 'are', 'fake', 'decided', 'beforehand', 'usually', 'favor', 'Face', 'Heel', 'little', 'details', 'staples', 'blood', 'are', ""n't"", 'faked.The', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'Randy', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'trying', 'find', 'foothold', 'parts', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'important', 'choices', 'made', 'allowed', 'become', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'have', 'left', 'gaping', 'holes', 'unable', 'repair', 'Rourke', 'acting', 'job', 'pathetic', 'man', 'completely', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'found', 'hoping', 'Randy', 'fragile', 'heart', 'would', 'keep', 'ticking', 'long', 'enough', 'reconcile', 'daughter', 'break', 'Pam', 'faade']",N/A

1237244,A17BUUBOU0598B,B001TOD92C,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[4, 4]","The Wrestleris a very effective and real depiction of the life of a down-on-his-luck wrestler years after his heyday.  Although darkly depressing, this movie is multi-faceted and includes elements of dark humor, drama and an almost documentary realism.If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you already know most of the story.  Mickey Rourke is former wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson.  He holds on to wrestling because the memory of the glory days is all he has left.  He is completely estranged from his daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood, who resents him for neglecting her for his career.  His most intimate human relationship is with a stripper, played by Marisa Tomei, who probably only sees him as another tip.  And to hold his crumbling life together, he uses drugs, alcohol and every form of escapism he can find.While the basic story and the script for this movie are familiar territory, the way the movie tells that story is what sets it apart.  This is almost an art movie hidden within a mainstream movie.  All of the characters have simple lines that sometimes can border on clich&eacute;, but those things seem to be to have larger symbolic meanings.  As the story develops, we see the relationships between the characters develop and evolve.We also get some insight into the lives of semi-professional and professional wrestlers.  The issues of drug abuse are dealt with candidly.  The small tricks of the trade that they employ in order to make their shows more entertaining are sometimes difficult to watch.  Even a ""fake"" wrestling bout can be physically devastating to the human body.Those who are easily offended by gratuitous nudity or violence should steer clear of this.  Similarly, those looking for a tale of redemption should be prepared for a very dark and gritty story.  I think there is redemption here, of a sort, but this is definitely not your typical feel good comeback movie.I can understand those who wanted to see more of Ram's descent, yet I think the shock of seeing him down and out is much more impactful without the linear plot showing us how we got there.  When we are down and out in life, don't we always ask ourselves ""how did I get here?""  Had the movie shown us how he got there, it would have lessened our ability to ask that question like Ram had to of asked himself a few times.  I can also understand why some would have wanted his relationships to be fleshed out a little more.  Personally, I think the way it was done makes it easier to see how isolated Ram has become from everybody in his life.The only disappointments I have with this movie is that the standard DVD was set at a list of $30 and there are no special features.  Here they give us the standard audio and subtitle options but none of the extras I look forward to watching.  I would have loved to learn more about the locations throughout New Jersey as well as the various elements that went into making the movie.  I would also have enjoyed to see interview footage with the wrestlers who were extras in this movie.  The list of potential features is almost limitless and here we got nothing.  I can't help be a little bit disappointed that a film that was listed at ""Blu-ray"" prices included nothing more than some previews and standard commentary.CONCLUSIONThose who like dramas with dark realism will definitely find this movie worth their while.  I wish they would have included more with the disk but if you haven't seen this yet it is well worth watching.Enjoy.",4,The Wrestler - A Raw And Gritty Depiction Of Life's Seedy Underbelly,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,3494,"['Wrestleris', 'very', 'effective', 'real', 'depiction', 'life', 'down-on-his-luck', 'wrestler', 'years', 'heyday', 'darkly', 'depressing', 'movie', 'multi-faceted', 'elements', 'dark', 'humor', 'drama', 'almost', 'documentary', 'realism.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'movie', 'already', 'know', 'most', 'story', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'former', 'wrestler', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'wrestling', 'memory', 'glory', 'days', 'left', 'completely', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'played', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'who', 'neglecting', 'career', 'most', 'intimate', 'human', 'relationship', 'stripper', 'played', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'who', 'probably', 'only', 'tip', 'hold', 'crumbling', 'life', 'together', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'form', 'escapism', 'can', 'find.While', 'basic', 'story', 'script', 'movie', 'are', 'familiar', 'territory', 'way', 'movie', 'story', 'what', 'apart', 'almost', 'art', 'movie', 'hidden', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'characters', 'have', 'simple', 'lines', 'sometimes', 'can', 'border', 'clich', 'eacute', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'have', 'larger', 'symbolic', 'meanings', 'story', 'see', 'relationships', 'characters', 'develop', 'evolve.We', 'also', 'get', 'insight', 'lives', 'semi-professional', 'professional', 'wrestlers', 'issues', 'drug', 'abuse', 'are', 'dealt', 'candidly', 'small', 'tricks', 'trade', 'employ', 'order', 'make', 'shows', 'more', 'entertaining', 'are', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Even', 'fake', 'wrestling', 'bout', 'can', 'be', 'physically', 'devastating', 'human', 'body.Those', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'violence', 'should', 'steer', 'clear', 'Similarly', 'looking', 'tale', 'redemption', 'should', 'be', 'prepared', 'very', 'dark', 'gritty', 'story', 'think', 'redemption', 'here', 'sort', 'definitely', 'not', 'typical', 'feel', 'good', 'comeback', 'movie.I', 'can', 'understand', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'Ram', 'descent', 'yet', 'think', 'shock', 'seeing', 'down', 'much', 'more', 'impactful', 'linear', 'plot', 'showing', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'When', 'are', 'down', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'ask', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'here', 'Had', 'movie', 'shown', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'lessened', 'ability', 'ask', 'question', 'Ram', 'had', 'asked', 'few', 'times', 'can', 'also', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'relationships', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'Personally', 'think', 'way', 'was', 'done', 'easier', 'see', 'how', 'isolated', 'Ram', 'become', 'everybody', 'life.The', 'only', 'have', 'movie', 'standard', 'DVD', 'was', 'set', 'list', '30', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'Here', 'give', 'standard', 'audio', 'subtitle', 'options', 'none', 'extras', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'learn', 'more', 'locations', 'New', 'Jersey', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'elements', 'went', 'making', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'see', 'interview', 'footage', 'wrestlers', 'who', 'were', 'extras', 'movie', 'list', 'potential', 'features', 'almost', 'limitless', 'here', 'got', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'film', 'was', 'listed', 'Blu-ray', 'prices', 'included', 'nothing', 'more', 'previews', 'standard', 'commentary.CONCLUSIONThose', 'who', 'dramas', 'dark', 'realism', 'will', 'definitely', 'find', 'movie', 'while', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'disk', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.Enjoy']",N/A
1237245,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001TOD92C,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","Much has been said about Mickey Rourke losing the Oscar this year to Sean Penn in the film MILK. While I agree that Penn is a solid actor, I think the talk is right on this one. Rourke deserved the nod.In THE WRESTLER, Rourke plays Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a wrestler past his prime still making a small living playing in small local area matches. Gone are the heydays of the big arenas and crowds cheering him on. But the crowds that come to see him still remember those days with fondness.Battered and bashed, Randy survives on pain meds and working part time in a grocery store moving freight. While still in better shape than most, the ravages of leaping off the top rope for his signature move has taken its toll. But he continues to get out there every weekend to the roar of the crowd.As Randy ekes out a living, he also develops affection for a young woman, a stripper at the local club named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei). Sadly, while Randy sees their conversations as a bit of a relationship, it's all business to Cassidy. It's nothing more than another situation where Randy is blinded by his own vision of reality compared to what it actually is.After a particularly brutal match, Randy walks off to be patched up due to the various glass, thumbtack, barb wire and board cuts and bruises. Shortly after they finish, he passes out in the locker room. When he wakes he discovers that he's had a massive heart attack and the doctors advise him not to get in the ring again.During a conversation with Cassidy, Randy takes her advice and contacts his daughter, a young woman now who he's rarely seen and never been there for. Her reaction to his visit doesn't go well, even knowing that he is dying. As the film progresses, the two eventually reconcile somewhat, only to have Randy blow it once again by not showing for a dinner.Beaten down by the world, unable to do what he loves most, Randy takes a full time job at the grocery working the deli counter. Between dealing with persnickety customers and old fans that recognize him in what he feels is a low level job, he loses it and quits. Unfortunately his relationship with Cassidy doesn't go a whole lot better.By the films end, Randy has decided to make a small payday by reuniting with his old nemesis The Ayatollah for a 20 year anniversary match. The pair used to be the top headliner and their matches were legend. Now it's time to go down fighting, to recapture his glory and to once more hear that roar of the crowd.Rourke does and outstanding job here as a washed up wrestler who has seen better days yet lives for those moments in the ring in front of the crowd. You feel so much for his character as he struggles day to day while dealing with that loss of years gone by. The punishment that he's put himself through, the suffering he now endures and all for those few moments of adulation that he treasures.The film gives a great behind the scenes look at the world of wrestling too. Fans all over the world know that it's not real in the sense that the outcomes are the results of pummeling and chair hits. Its set up from the get go and the storylines and in the ring moves are worked out in advance. But the drama involved is what keeps fans coming back. And there is indeed athleticism involved in their maneuvers.The major thing I walked away from in this film when it comes to professional wrestlers though wasn't the work involved, I'd known about that. It was the sadness seen in the figures that brought so much attention to their form of entertainment only to walk away with nothing but battered bodies and dreams of days gone by. And that truly is a sad notion to think of.The rise of characters in search of fame and glory has been a staple of the movies for years. The tales of their lives, past and present, offers some of the best stories ever filmed.

OK, it WAS too much, because I already had the song on CD.

Mickey Rourke's character was not only a Loser with a capital L, but he wasn't even interesting.His life was a big waste: his chosen profession is one of fakery and self-abuse, he had a drug addiction, a dead-end day job, dead-end (or just dead) relationships, a crappy trailer, no taste in music, and could not take care of his own basic health needs.Not much could be worse than all this, except--on top of everything!--where does he live? New Jersey.So the movie sets all this up, and does the audience get to see some sort of transformation, or revelation of depth, or ANYTHING that isn't more of the same sad decline?No.This movie was supposed to have been Mickey Rourke's comeback--his life apparently mirrored, to a lesser degree, his character ""the Ram""--but I just don't see it.

Just watching this movie reminded me so much of a documentry I watched long ago about Jake The Snake and his real life struggles with his daughter and his demons. The Wrestler brings a true sense of realism to the silver screen and that's not something that happens too often. This movie is great for one thing, and that's ""realism"". An old wrestler who's glory days are behind him and has to work part time at a grocery store while still continuing matches on the side to get by,a worn down stripper who can't seem to settle down and have a real emotional relationship with a man,and a daughter who has been abandoned by her father for a majority of her life, and can't seem to find peace within herself.I mean these are real people, this is real life on film. At the beginning of the movie you see Randy The Ram as a Wrestler that can still keep himself on his feet, but as the movie goes on you really get to see just how thin thread that's holding him up truly is.  To Randy The Ram, being a wrestler is his identity, it's what he has always known, and what has always motivated him to keep on moving. Even at the end of his career at the very bottom of it all, he still can't let go of it. Only towards the end of the movie do you get to realize why Randy does what he does. He Wrestles because the ring is that one place, where he truly feels at peace.",5,Realistic and Can be appreciated by any Wrestling fan!,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,1677,"['reading', 'review', 'review', 'people', 'talking', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', ""'m"", 'actually', 'going', 'review', 'MOVIE', 'reviews', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'about.The', 'Wrestler', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'long', 'time', 'awaited', 'movies', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'remember', 'guys', 'glory', 'days', 'what', 'became', 'date', 'Just', 'watching', 'movie', 'reminded', 'so', 'much', 'documentry', 'watched', 'long', 'ago', 'Jake', 'Snake', 'real', 'life', 'daughter', 'demons', 'Wrestler', 'true', 'sense', 'realism', 'silver', 'screen', 'not', 'something', 'too', 'often', 'movie', 'great', 'one', 'thing', 'realism', 'old', 'wrestler', 'who', 'glory', 'days', 'are', 'work', 'part', 'time', 'grocery', 'store', 'still', 'continuing', 'matches', 'side', 'get', 'worn', 'down', 'stripper', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'settle', 'down', 'have', 'real', 'emotional', 'relationship', 'man', 'daughter', 'who', 'been', 'abandoned', 'father', 'majority', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'peace', 'herself.I', 'mean', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'beginning', 'movie', 'see', 'Ram', 'Wrestler', 'can', 'still', 'keep', 'feet', 'movie', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'thin', 'thread', 'holding', 'up', 'truly', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'being', 'wrestler', 'identity', 'what', 'always', 'known', 'always', 'motivated', 'keep', 'moving', 'Even', 'end', 'career', 'very', 'bottom', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'Only', 'end', 'movie', 'do', 'get', 'realize', 'why', 'Randy', 'what', 'ring', 'one', 'place', 'where', 'truly', 'peace']",N/A
1237248,A13TO1ZFAH9SVN,B001TOD92C,Matthew Edmundson,"[1, 1]","The Wrestler was one of those movies that you heard everybody talk about. You heard Mickey Rourke was back in the performance of the life time playing a charcter that mirrored himself. Believe the hype because the movie is that good. It's a movie fueled by character performances and was a pleasantly suprising movie.Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson was a star in the 80's. He was the equivalent of Hulk Hogan. He dominated the wrestler world. The 90's and new century haven't been so kind to poor Randy. He's found himself as a wash up and has been. Instead of filling Madison Square Gardens he's now having trouble packing a high school gym. It gets even worse after a hear attack finds himself wondering about what to do with his life. He longs for a relationship with Cassidy(Tomei) a stripper who doesn't date customers. He's trying to patch a relationship that he never had with his daughter Stephanie(Wood). In fact she can't stand and pretty much hates him. Randy is faced with a ton of problems. He should give up wrestling on the eve of the 25 reunion of his greatest match. Can he get a true relationship with either women in his life. That is the tale of the movie The Wrestler.Rourke truly is amazing in the movie. He pulls the look off of a wrestler. He had to be looking at picutres and videos of Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, and any other wrestler trying to hold onto his 80's glory. Rourke plays the role to perfection. I found myself feeling bad for the guy as you see him trying to sruggle to hold onto his past glory. The things he does to try to stay in shape. You pity him that he has no friends and struggles for attention from anybody. There's a great scene where you find him playing NES with a kid in his trailer park. It truly is the performance of his carear.The two women in Randy's life are exceptional as well. Marisa Tomei looks great in the movie. Evan Rachel Wood does also. You feel pity for both women whose lives are almost as bad as Randy. You want to see both succeed both Randy keeps blowing it with either of them, especially his daughter Stephanie. They give Oscar caliber performances and this movie should help both build on budding carears.I've seen all of Darren Aronofsy's movies now except for The Fountain. The guy is pretty dang good as a director. I'd say this is his second best work behind Requiem for a Dream."" Like most critics I doubted his ability to do a wrestling movie. I would have doubted almost any director not named Scorsese, Coppola, or De Palma making the movie. The movie flows incredibly. The acting, editing, music, and everything else are great. I hope people keep bank rolling Aronofsky and he keeps churning out great movies.I was pleasantly surprised by The Wrestler. Mickey Rourke is back and hopefully can keep his act together.

Robert Downey Jr. had Iron Man and his Oscar nominated role for Tropic Thunder, Britany Spears finally got that much needed career boost, but the most out there comeback of the year come from Mickey Rourke, who delivers one of the years best performances in the raw, realistic, and heart tugging The Wrestler.Randy 'The Ram' Robinson was a huge wrestling star in the 80's, with money, fame, and tons of fans. Now almost twenty years later, he is a shell of his former self, body battered and torn, no longer a star, living paycheck by paycheck with every run down wrestling match, the guy is like a walking failure of his glory days. One day, after suffering a near death experience, he wants to put his wrestling days behind him and try to make a 'normal' life.As mentioned before, Mickey Rourke gives the performance of his career, considering this role basically mirrors his own self destructive life. Balancing moments of humor, tenderness, sorrow, and all other emotions inbetween, you actually feel for the guy, feel his pain, and its real, its true, genuine emotion. Then there are the two woman, Marisa Tomei as the strippe Cassidy that Randy has a thing for and Evan Rachel Wood as his angry daughter Stephanie. Both of them deliver great performances as well, Tomei acting sort of like the light of the movie, acting as the perfect counterpart to Rourke, and Wood is able to convey pefectly play her role in a way that dosen't make it just another 'angry daughter' role.Darren Aronofsky, known mostly for his surreal, gritty sci/fi flicks gives us the dirt and piles it on, making the scenes so real and alive, you can feel the cold, you can smell the alcohol, and the wrestling scenes are just so bone crushing, so in your face, its almost too much for you to handle. I still have this searing image in my brain of the brutal fight scene near the middle of the film (trust me, you'll know when you see it). The Wrestler is just that movie that really dosen't act like one but an actual experience as you walk through this man's life.For those who have said that this year was a pretty lackluster year for movies, The Wrestler is that one movie that will seep into your skin and truley affect you in a way very few films will ever accomplish.",5,"A Raw, Powerful Film",1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,2418,"['2008', 'been', 'offically', 'dubbed', 'comeback', 'year', 'year', 'when', 'dozens', 'has-been', 'stars', 'seen', 'careers', 'get', 'jumpstart', 'propell', 'back', 'spotlight', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'had', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'role', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'Britany', 'Spears', 'finally', 'got', 'much', 'needed', 'career', 'boost', 'most', 'there', 'comeback', 'year', 'come', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'one', 'years', 'best', 'performances', 'raw', 'realistic', 'heart', 'tugging', 'Wrestler.Randy', ""'The"", 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'was', 'huge', 'wrestling', 'star', '80', 'money', 'fame', 'tons', 'fans', 'Now', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'body', 'battered', 'torn', 'no', 'longer', 'star', 'living', 'paycheck', 'paycheck', 'run', 'down', 'wrestling', 'match', 'guy', 'walking', 'failure', 'glory', 'days', 'One', 'day', 'suffering', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'put', 'wrestling', 'days', 'try', 'make', ""'normal"", 'life.As', 'mentioned', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'career', 'considering', 'role', 'basically', 'own', 'self', 'destructive', 'life', 'Balancing', 'moments', 'humor', 'tenderness', 'sorrow', 'other', 'emotions', 'inbetween', 'actually', 'feel', 'guy', 'feel', 'pain', 'real', 'true', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'Then', 'are', 'two', 'woman', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'strippe', 'Cassidy', 'Randy', 'thing', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'angry', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'deliver', 'great', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Tomei', 'acting', 'sort', 'light', 'movie', 'acting', 'perfect', 'counterpart', 'Rourke', 'Wood', 'able', 'convey', 'pefectly', 'play', 'role', 'way', 'dose', ""n't"", 'make', 'just', ""'angry"", 'daughter', 'role.Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'known', 'mostly', 'surreal', 'gritty', 'sci/fi', 'flicks', 'dirt', 'making', 'scenes', 'so', 'real', 'alive', 'can', 'feel', 'cold', 'can', 'smell', 'alcohol', 'wrestling', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'bone', 'crushing', 'so', 'face', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'still', 'have', 'searing', 'image', 'brain', 'brutal', 'fight', 'scene', 'middle', 'film', 'trust', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'Wrestler', 'just', 'movie', 'really', 'dose', ""n't"", 'act', 'one', 'actual', 'experience', 'walk', 'man', 'life.For', 'who', 'have', 'said', 'year', 'was', 'pretty', 'lackluster', 'year', 'movies', 'Wrestler', 'one', 'movie', 'will', 'seep', 'skin', 'truley', 'affect', 'way', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'will', 'ever', 'accomplish']",N/A

And it's easy to see why so many wrestlers die (40 in ten years) it's a rough and physical art form that stresses the body to the max and the fact that so many use steriods and other drugs to stay working.  Sadly this movie features cocaine use and that is not usually the problem of wrestlers but it only adds to focus of a man who has hit the bottom in his life. Basically you have a man who selfish life has alennated his own daughter even and he comes to realize that he is doomed. (spoiler, do not read if you don't want to know the ending, but there is a ending as you know what's coming);  His heart is worn out by steriods and he decides to go out in the wring.

Living alone and close to poverty, he befriends a stripper named Pam, who herself is better known by her stage name Cassidy (Marisa Tomei.)  After wrestling in a particularly brutal hardcore match, Randy suffers a heart attack and learns his body can no longer take the strain of competing as a wrestler, thanks in a large part due to years of drug abuse.  With a new outlook on life, Randy realizes his biggest regret:  Losing contract with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood).  He does what he can to adjust to normal life, but can Randy escape the self-destructive behaviors that got him to where he's at in the first place?Mickey Rourke's portrayal of a faded wrestler was the largest reason why I was floored after I saw this film.  I've met people who've wrestled semi-professionally and have seen wrestling documentaries such asBeyond The Mat, so I use my experiences with both as a yard stick in saying this.  Rourke's performance was beyond remarkable in regards to authentic it felt.  He put himself through what many others put themselves through on a regular basis to demonstrate the suffering these performers go through to maintain the sport and entertain it's fans.  Rourke didn't just play the role in the film; he became Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson and you couldn't help but give your empathy toward his character, no matter how much of a screw up he was.I also enjoyed Marisa Tomei's role in the film (and no, not just because of the nude scenes.)  I've met women who, like wrestlers, have had to sell their body just so they can get by.  She demonstrates the balance of having to use your sexuality to make a living while having to protect herself from both abuse and emotional attachment.  Much like Rourke's character, she can't escape her stage persona simply because she isn't working; it's ingrained into who she is because of what she does.In the end there were no fireworks, no glory, no spectacular situations for anyone to claim champions of.  There's no Hulk Hogans or Stone Cold Steve Austins to excite thousands in attendance and millions watching at home.  There are the gutsy up-and-coming semi-pro wrestlers trying to be the next star, over-the-hill semi-pro wrestlers trying to recapture who they used to be, and small venues jam packed with the hundreds of fanatic fans who'll keep coming as long as the door's open for them.  The wrestling can be hard to watch but it's nothing that's overexaggerated; it's only what many do to themselves for the love of what they do and the entertainment of those who cheer for them.This has managed to become one of my personal favorite movies.

1237261,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001TOD92C,mirasreviews,"[0, 1]","""The Wrestler"" is famously a comeback film for Mickey Rourke, whose lead performance earned him an Oscar nomination, about a battered, aging pro wrestler who dreams of a comeback.  Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), whose wrestling career peaked in the 1980s, now lives in a trailer park, stocks shelves at a grocery for a living, and competes in local wrestling matches on weekends. When a promoter suggests a rematch on the 20-year anniversary of one of The Ram's most famous fights, Randy thinks this might be his chance at a comeback. But his battered old body is crying out for retirement, not more abuse.Director Darren Aronofsky approaches this story with a cinema verite style. I could have done without so much camera movement, but the gritty style suits the subject. ""The Wrestler"" is a character study of a man who feels that there is only one place where he can do something that he's good at and be appreciated for it, but, unfortunately, his body can no longer cope with the injuries, the steroids, and general self-destruction of pro wrestling. The film conveys a respect for the athleticism and theater of pro wrestling, but, at the same time, serves as an expos&eacute; of the extreme physical abuse wrestlers inflict upon themselves. The fights aren't real, but the damage is.I'm not normally bothered by the depiction of violence on film. But people doing wanton violence to themselves for the entertainment of others is disturbing. It doesn't reflect well on wrestling fans. Though ""The Wrestler"" is about an aging wrestler's relationship to the sport, it touches on other relationships in his life. Randy finds a little companionship in a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), also in danger of losing her livelihood to age. And he reaches out to his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). I found Stephanie's histrionics unrealistic. But Mickey Rourke never overplays his characterization of a man who has one path at this point in his life, and it's not an enviable one. The Fox 2009 DVD has no bonus features.

Marlene Smith ""tiger lily""","[5, 5]","Mickey Rourke's portrayal of a ""broken down piece of meat"" merits five stars because of all the emotions that it stirs up in the viewer, and that is a true testament to his talent as an actor. Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson feels like a real person, someone you care about despite knowing that he brought much of his loneliness and personal agony on himself. Randy has been involved in wrestling for so long that it's his only means of identifying himself, even though he knows that it could kill him in the end. His wrestling buddies are a sort of surrogate family to a man who has alienated his daughter and cannot get close enough to the woman, stripper Cassidy, who has captured his heart. You cringe when seeing him continue the self-destructive behaviors that threaten his health and relationships, yet you cheer him on anyway and want him to survive and be happy. You see, Randy is imminently likeable. An early scene shows him wearily encouraging a young mohawk-sporting wrestler; he is almost fatherly while talking to the young man right before they go into the ring and beat the hell out of each other.Particularly brutal is a match where a staple gun and barbed wire are used. One can hardly imagine engaging in this sort of activity for the sake of a buck, yet Randy does it - for the money, and for reasons unfathomable to most. He has gotten comfortable in this lifestyle, may wish to break free of it but doesn't know how. (That's my take on it, anyway). He is a human being, and no matter the circumstances of his ruin, does not deserve to be all alone in life.You need not be a wrestling fan to appreciate this film.

That role put him back on the map for all those who saw it, but I have to admit that what he does in The Wrestler even towers head and shoulders above the character Marv that he brought to life so brilliantly. He deserves to win the Best Actor Oscar in my book. While Mickey Rourke is getting all the attention (he does deserve it), Marisa Tomei is on top of her game as well and deserves her nomination. Rounding out the main cast is Evan Rachel Wood as the daughter of Mickey's character. She doesn't have much screen time, but she pulls off the part very well.I was briefly a fan of professional wrestling when I was in middle school, but quickly lost interest. You don't have to like that aspect of the film to enjoy the overall experience. The wrestling scenes don't make up that much of the movie anyway, but be warned, they are extremely brutal.When the credits start to roll, with Bruce Springsteen singing his great original song for the movie, The Wrestler leaves you battered and bruised, but the story will have a lasting tug on your heart and soul.4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",5,Mickey Rourke is born again in a perfect role,1232668800,"01 23, 2009",2009,1179,"['many', 'praise', 'Mickey', 'BIG', 'comeback', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Sin', 'City', 'back', '2005', 'role', 'put', 'back', 'map', 'who', 'saw', 'have', 'admit', 'what', 'Wrestler', 'even', 'towers', 'head', 'shoulders', 'character', 'Marv', 'brought', 'life', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'win', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'book', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'getting', 'attention', 'deserve', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'top', 'game', 'well', 'nomination', 'Rounding', 'out', 'main', 'cast', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'daughter', 'Mickey', 'character', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'part', 'very', 'well.I', 'was', 'fan', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'when', 'was', 'middle', 'school', 'quickly', 'lost', 'interest', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'like', 'aspect', 'film', 'enjoy', 'overall', 'experience', 'wrestling', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'much', 'movie', 'anyway', 'be', 'warned', 'are', 'extremely', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'singing', 'great', 'original', 'song', 'movie', 'Wrestler', 'battered', 'bruised', 'story', 'will', 'have', 'lasting', 'tug', 'heart', 'soul.4', '1/2', '5', 'stars']",N/A
1237265,A1IMPZYRB79DMS,B001TOD92C,Movie Fan,"[170, 184]","I've been a wrestling fan since the '70s and it's one of those things that I have to hide from most people because they think it's a joke or they just don't understand what it's appeal is. Then came along ""The Wrestler"" and now my friends are asking me questions and taking interest in ""the business"". I saw the movie with some friends and family and we had some very spirited discussions afterward. They couldn't believe that these guys would, for example, mutilate themselves to have blood in matches (a practice called ""blading"" that's performed with a small piece of a razor blade), or that years spent in the ring will leave most wrestlers battered and even disabled thanks to the legit wear and tear that wrestling has on the body. Most people assume a wrestling ring is  a trampoline, but it's actually like landing on concrete and over time there's a price to pay for taking bumps on such a hard surface for so many years. ""The Wrestler"" reveals all of these issues wrapped up in an enthralling and emotional motion picture you wont soon forget.Life imitates art on several levels in ""The Wrestler"". For example, the movie shows the dark side of steroid abuse that has caused a laundry list of wrestler deaths in just the past 10 years (the pressures of the Monday Night War era claimed the lives of countless wrestlers). Well, during the first backstage wrestling scene, Mickey Rourke's character shakes hands with a wrestler that is huge and jacked to the gills. That wrestler died from heart failure a few weeks before the movie's release. Also, there is a scene where another huge and overly muscular wrestler sells several illegal muscle enhancers to Rourke's character. That wrestler was recently arrested for selling drugs. But the real story here, is how Mickey Rourke's character of Randy the Ram mirrors Mickey's life in many ways. Both are former stars, both have pushed their bodies to the limit in sports (Mickey revealed on the Charlie Rose show that he was forced to quit boxing because one more serious blow could've been it for him) and both want to get back in the spotlight. Thankfully, Mickey has achieved his goal of regaining the spotlight. As for Randy, that's a different story.Randy the Ram, seems to be based on a combination of former wrestlers Lex Luger and Jake the Snake Roberts. Lex Luger's ailing body and rock bottom financial situation plus Jake's volatile relationship with his daughter were definite inspirations for screenwriter Robert Siegel. Mickey takes the experiences of Lex and Jake, along with his own and shapes a character that he was born to play. The part was originally written for Nicholas Cage, but I can't imagine anyone but Mickey Rourke playing this part. Mickey plays Randy with such heart and soul that he truly makes the audience feel for him. We feel his pain, we relate to his shortcomings and we cheer him on to find love and rebuild the relationship with his daughter. When Randy apologizes to his daughter for being on the road wrestling and not being there for her when she needed him, you feel it.As a wrestling fan, one of the most powerful scenes takes place at the end when Marisa Tomei's character begs Randy not to wrestle just moments before the start of a match due to his heart condition and Randy tells her that he belongs out there. It's the only place he fits in, it's the only place he feels successful and loved. Randy's music then hits and a man who looked broken down and beaten just a second ago, busts thru that curtain and walks out as a superstar with the crowd eating out of his hand. It's a powerful scene that sums up why so many wrestlers find it so difficult to walk away from the business.Don't let the fact that ""The Wrestler"" takes place in the world of professional wrestling keep you from seeing it. You don't need to be a fan to enjoy this movie. Wrestling is merely the backdrop for the drama taking place on the screen. Everyone puts in amazing performances. Rourke and Tomei deserve their Oscar nominations and Evan Rachel Wood nearly steals the movie. Just keep this in mind while watching it. Don't get too wrapped up in the drama, because after all, it is just a movie.

1237266,A3ZMC6NFTXEKO,B001TOD92C,"M. R. Griffin ""griffinfinity""","[1, 1]","Mickey Rourke is among my very favorite actors. I've seen everything he has done and his body of work is substantial. Several of his performances in the `old days' should have earned him Oscar nominations. To say he stood as high as any of his peers would be accurate. That said, I do not think that `The Wrestler' is his best work. It is amongst it though.The Wrestler is a work that shines in its ability to tell the tale of Randy `The Ram' Robinson in the gritty fashion that he lived it. The Ram is a survivor of a career that has seen him at the pinnacle and descent from the Professional Wrestling world. He has handled the pain and injuries along the way. He must now grapple with his emotions, a trickier foe in a far more brutal arena.Rourke portrays two characters here. The first is that of 'The Ram'. All in the VFW halls and locker rooms love him. It is the bottom of the wrestling world in terms of glamor. But the camaraderie is strong, as the wrestlers reminisce about the limelight, the glory days. Inside the ropes, they pummel each other. Outside, there is great pride and friendship. Darren Aronofsky has done a superb job in achieving this sense, along with the real wrestlers taking part in the film.The other character that Rourke brings to life is that of Robin (""call me Randy""). It is Robin who must tend to the wounds that his alter ego `The Ram' inflicts. It is Robin who is constantly reminded of the uncomfortable existence it takes to keep 'The Ram' alive. It is time then, for Robin to summon the courage it takes to change things for the better.Along the way he encounters Marisa Tomei as a kindred soul in need of change as well. Tomei creates 'Pam' a multi-faceted mirror for Robin to peer into. Her ability to blend humor, despair, intelligence and sultriness into the role of Pam is beautiful done. Hers is an integral part in 'The Wrestler'. She pulls it all off in fine fashion and form.Evan Rachel Wood plays a distant and damaged link to Robin's past. Her contribution to the film is significant, with a capital ""S"". As mentioned, the real life wrestlers assembled for the film are great. Each one has crafted a character for the ring that enables their considerable physical talents to enthrall the local crowds who in turn heap praise upon them. They need each other and Director Aronofsky faithfully depicts that.Having followed the buzz and accolades awarded the film, director and actors, I feel that they have truly earned it. Watching Mickey's `official' return to Hollywood, and the publicity it generated made me very happy. I waited to view the film after the hoopla and award galas died down. I was enjoying the Mickey Rourke show too much. The look on Angelina Jolie's face as Rourke kissed her hand at an awards show said it all. For that moment in time, the man standing beside her, Brad Pitt, did not exist. Rourke's charisma survived the ups and downs of a harsh life that Rourke admitted was of his own doing.I think the side story, that of the resurgence of Mickey Rourke is every bit as interesting as `The Wrestler'. Rourke was nothing if not astounding, brilliant in films such as `Rumblefish', and `The Pope of Greenwich Village'. The success continued and then, it seemed as if Mickey disappeared. Often times, that is the case in Hollywood when one doesn't follow the script. What happened?

Randy's a professional wrestler, an entertainer whose body is his business, as we're reminded over and over, sometimes subtly but most of the time fairly bluntly in this very heartfelt film about his life and potential redemption. And by extension, that of the former big star who plays Randy, Mickey Rourke.This is Rourke's film through and through and in a year with a great many very fine male lead performances - Sean Penn in MILK and Clint Eastwood in GRAN TORINO both managed some of their very best work - this might be the best. Rourke inhabits this role like a second skin, a bruised and bloodied steroid-enhanced skin with a mind under it that is active enough but still delusional, still the video-game-playing headbanging kid of the 70s and 80s despite the adult responsibilities that he just doesn't want to face. He's too old for this world, as a heart attack early on tells him; but he's also not fit for the ""straight"" life of working in a grocery store and being a father either.Shot on Super 16MM film with a low-budget grungy vibe throughout, THE WRESTLER doesn't really do anything new apart from being (apparently) the first Hollywood drama about professional wrestling; you could slap most of the well-worn clich&eacute;s here into most films about boxing, drag racing, etc and they'd be right at home. And a lot of the subtext is pretty obvious too; when Randy falls for a stripper (Marisa Tomei who must have made a pact with the devil to look the way she does at 44) we can see pretty readily that, unspoken or not, the themes of performance vs real life, acting a part and knowing when to stop acting, responsibility in the midst of still playing the childhood dream of being the macho guy or the gorgeous babe are going to reflect equally on both stars. And Randy's attempted reconciliation with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) is similarly predictable, though the scene where they go to the deserted and decrepit seaside town is pretty moving anyway.I really didn't like Darren Aronofsky's previous film, THE FOUNTAIN at all: pretentious, pretty for the sake of being pretty, full of grandiose ideas never really developed.  THE WRESTLER is no question an attempt to take the opposite tack, and some people are calling it pretentious for the very reason that the director is trying something different! A ludicrous criticism if you ask me, and this film has a lot in common with both the gritty street scenes of his first two films (PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM) and the overt redemptive story lines of REQUIEM.  It doesn't reach as far or as wide as any of his previous work, but in a great many respects it succeeds more fully in what it does attempt.So you don't go into this for originality, you go into it for great acting and verisimilitude in the decaying Jersey atmosphere, and it succeeds phenomenally in those regards. The ending will disappoint some who want easy resolutions, but if it does they weren't paying attention; there are no easy answers here, and the choice of Bruce Springsteen to sing the title song at the end ought to make that much clear. Life is hard; all Randy can do, finally, is narrow it down to the one thing he loves that never let him down, whether it kills him or not, and all we can do is savor the moment.",4,"Rourke's redemption?

Yes, The Wrestler finds Rourke's career renaissance coming full circle as he stars as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a pro-wrestler way past his prime who is broken, beat-up, and scrounging around just to get by, while still yearning for the sounds and cheers of the crowd.  At its heart, The Wrestler is a character study that succeeds not so much because of its somewhat predictable script, but because of Aronofsky's (Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain) vision, and wholeheartedly because of Rourke's soul-bearing performance as Randy.  How Rourke didn't nail down an Oscar win I'll never know, no disrespect to Sean Penn who was spectacular himself in Milk, but Rourke is the supreme embodiment of the character he's playing, so much so that if Randy were involved in another profession, Rourke would only be playing himself.  Marisa Tomei (who herself received an Oscar nod as well) is fearless and so fine as a kindly stripper doing what she has to just to get by, and Evan Rachel Wood in a brief turn as Randy's estranged daughter makes the most out of her scenes.  But once again, it's Rourke who gives the performance of his career that makes The Wrestler as great a film that it is, and the film manages to deliver an emotional punch that has as much impact as a dropkick to the face.

I have read some comments that this is a film full of cliches redeemed by Rourke's performance but (whilst not taking anything away from Rourke's outstanding performance) that's harsh. For here is a tragedy: Randy the Ram is, at an almost biological level, a performer: it is only as a performer that his life has any value even to him, let alone anyone else, and he is only ever in his element - the sparkle returns - when he is ""performing"". Thereby performance becomes a means of communication outside the ring, too: rough-housing with kids outside the van he's been sleeping in, delivering egg salad, Cocktail-style, to elderly ladies over the deli counter at the local supermarket or carousing with the wrestlers, who still lionise him, backstage. Aronofsky's camera reinforces this point - we track behind Randy's head not only as he strides out to the ring, but as he marches out to the deli counter and marches in to meet the gang backstage.That performs as a way of living is fascinatingly counterpointed by his only (half-way successful) real life relationship, with Cassidy, a stripper, in many ways a very similar sort of a performer (we frequently also track behind Cassidy's head) but dispositionally the negative image: for Cassidy is *condemned* to perform to live (i.e. to earn a crust), and for her, performance is the only part of her life that has no meaning, and is the part she is most desperate to leave behind.That Randy has the misfortune not to apprehend this drives the drama in The Wrestler. Cassidy and Randy are star-cross'd lovers:  the two connect only when he's not performing and (QED, since he's a customer) she is. Like oil and water Cassidy feels forced to keep him segregated from her real self, within the context of her life as a performer; he wants her only outside of his. That is the tragic dilemma around which this film revolves, and while it may be constructed out of hackneyed archetypes it overcomes them handsomely.Olly Buxton",5,Star-cross'd lovers,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,2188,"['ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'autobiographical', 'aspects', 'Wrestler', 'spandex', 'lank', 'blonde', 'hair', 'self-mutilation', 'very', 'visceral', 'level', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'acting', 'have', 'read', 'comments', 'film', 'full', 'cliches', 'redeemed', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'not', 'taking', 'anything', 'away', 'Rourke', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'harsh', 'here', 'tragedy', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'almost', 'biological', 'level', 'performer', 'only', 'performer', 'life', 'value', 'even', 'let', 'alone', 'anyone', 'else', 'only', 'ever', 'element', 'sparkle', 'returns', 'when', 'performing', 'Thereby', 'performance', 'means', 'communication', 'ring', 'too', 'rough-housing', 'kids', 'van', 'been', 'sleeping', 'delivering', 'egg', 'salad', 'Cocktail-style', 'elderly', 'ladies', 'deli', 'counter', 'local', 'supermarket', 'carousing', 'wrestlers', 'who', 'still', 'lionise', 'backstage', 'Aronofsky', 'camera', 'point', 'track', 'Randy', 'head', 'not', 'only', 'ring', 'out', 'deli', 'counter', 'marches', 'meet', 'gang', 'backstage.That', 'way', 'living', 'fascinatingly', 'counterpointed', 'only', 'half-way', 'successful', 'real', 'life', 'relationship', 'Cassidy', 'stripper', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'similar', 'sort', 'performer', 'frequently', 'also', 'track', 'Cassidy', 'head', 'dispositionally', 'negative', 'image', 'Cassidy', '*condemned*', 'perform', 'live', 'i.e', 'earn', 'crust', 'performance', 'only', 'part', 'life', 'meaning', 'part', 'most', 'desperate', 'leave', 'Randy', 'misfortune', 'not', 'apprehend', 'drama', 'Wrestler', 'Cassidy', 'Randy', 'are', 'star-cross', ""'d"", 'lovers', 'two', 'connect', 'only', 'when', 'not', 'performing', 'QED', 'customer', 'oil', 'water', 'Cassidy', 'feels', 'forced', 'keep', 'segregated', 'real', 'self', 'context', 'life', 'performer', 'only', 'outside', 'tragic', 'dilemma', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'constructed', 'hackneyed', 'archetypes', 'handsomely.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

1237274,ARGOWR8T5ML5V,B001TOD92C,"Pagansadog ""PAGANSADOG""","[2, 2]","Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot.The Wrestler is a movie about Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) who was once wrestling's biggest superstars but now his stardom and his career are fading along with his personal relationship with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and a stripper Pam who also has a stage name Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), even worse is his fleeting popularity with the fans. The movie is shot in a somewhat documentary style and compliments the directors vision of in your face realism.I went to see this movie when it first hit my local theater and I must admit that I am a huge wrestling fan. I grew up watching the likes of Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair and many wrestling greats. I was eagerly anticipating the behind the scenes action and it delivered. Not only does this movie pay homage to the wrestling superstars of today it also reminds us to never forget about the superstars of yesterday, whose names are not currently up in lights. There is considerably enough humor, emotion and complexity in Randy, s personal life to keep a non fan sated but its unbelievable ability to touch a fan is most profound and it succeeds with flying colors.In my opinion 'The Rams' relationship with the fans are much more complex than Randy's personal relationships. This is best demonstrated as 'The Ram' is seen greeting and acknowledging two disabled fan's just outside the door to ring side. Here are two fans that probably know all that there is to know about 'The Ram' but perhaps know very little about Randy. I personally doubt that they would want to know either; you see, wrestling is about making heroes and villains, it shows us the beauty of love, the ugliness of hate and gives us fans a proper outlet to appropriately express it. This movie made me laugh and cry. I laughed the most at scenes of Randy's day job where at a deli he tries to use humor to get him through the day and again in a later scene where Randy's stage name 'The Ram' suddenly takes on a whole new meaning. I really enjoyed those scenes.I choked up a few times, in particular the part where Randy is seen playing Nintendo with a little boy who isn't interested (not really) in hearing stories about The Ram. To me this was sad because back in the early 80's wrestlers were devoid of proper media marketing such as Internet, Dud's, Cd's, etc... not to mention the lack of popularity wrestling  had with the mainstream. (Note: The fact that the business held onto the idea that wrestling was absolutely real added to this. It wasn't until after a superstar 'open hand slapped a 20/20 news reporter (twice) who asked him if wrestling was fake, that WWE admitted, ""Although the story lines are fixed the matches were absolutely real"". That is what launched it into the mainstream.)Reinforcing this is a later scene in which, you see former superstars at a fan signing resting their heads on tables while another is actually sewing. The young fans don't care about them anymore, they are left with a disregard that I'm sure was tougher for them to live with than the injuries that they had endured.  It hurts me so deeply that people consistently mock and make fun of the die-hard passion between the wrestlers and the fans that I got more emotional while writing this review than I care to admit. I have witnessed more compassion and love from the men and women in this business then I have seen from those in any other popular sport.As far as WWE superstar appearances, there are plenty, but most important to me was a cameo appearance by WWE newcomer R-Truth. Where he asks Randy ""So how you been man?"" Randy answers ""Hangin and swangin' my brotha."" that is priceless topped off with R-Truth saying"" I'm buyin.'"" is something only a fan can truly appreciate and it brings a smile to my face every time. It upsets me to know the sacrifice and undying commitment these superstars give to the fans night after night and for some (superstars and fans alike) that is the only family they have left. This movie willpick you up and slam you down, again and again.At the heart of this emotional roller coaster is a 'Rocky' like tribute. While Randy is talking on a pay phone we hear him say ""I don't give an s--- I just want to wrestle."" This is a really good movie for Fans and Non fans alike and although as a fan I wanted to stand up and cheer I couldn't because I was too floored to move.  I walked away with a feeling that although the sport might be staged, maybe just once because of this movie, everyone can appreciate just what wrestling entertainment is really all about.",5,STANDING UP FOR THE WWE,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,4607,"['Plot', 'Details', 'opinion', 'reveals', 'minor', 'details', 'movie', 'plot.The', 'Wrestler', 'movie', 'Randy', ""'The"", 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'wrestling', 'biggest', 'superstars', 'now', 'stardom', 'career', 'are', 'fading', 'personal', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'stripper', 'Pam', 'who', 'also', 'stage', 'name', 'Cassidy', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'even', 'worse', 'fleeting', 'popularity', 'fans', 'movie', 'shot', 'somewhat', 'documentary', 'style', 'directors', 'vision', 'face', 'realism.I', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'hit', 'local', 'theater', 'must', 'admit', 'am', 'huge', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'likes', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Ric', 'Flair', 'many', 'wrestling', 'greats', 'was', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'scenes', 'action', 'delivered', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'pay', 'homage', 'wrestling', 'superstars', 'today', 'also', 'never', 'forget', 'superstars', 'yesterday', 'names', 'are', 'not', 'currently', 'lights', 'considerably', 'enough', 'humor', 'emotion', 'complexity', 'Randy', 's', 'personal', 'life', 'keep', 'non', 'fan', 'sated', 'unbelievable', 'ability', 'touch', 'fan', 'most', 'profound', 'flying', 'colors.In', 'opinion', 'Rams', 'relationship', 'fans', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'Randy', 'personal', 'relationships', 'best', 'demonstrated', ""'The"", 'Ram', 'seen', 'greeting', 'acknowledging', 'two', 'disabled', 'fan', 'just', 'door', 'ring', 'side', 'Here', 'are', 'two', 'fans', 'probably', 'know', 'know', ""'The"", 'Ram', 'perhaps', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'Randy', 'personally', 'doubt', 'would', 'want', 'know', 'either', 'see', 'wrestling', 'making', 'heroes', 'villains', 'beauty', 'love', 'ugliness', 'hate', 'proper', 'outlet', 'appropriately', 'express', 'movie', 'made', 'laugh', 'cry', 'laughed', 'most', 'scenes', 'Randy', 'day', 'job', 'where', 'deli', 'use', 'humor', 'get', 'day', 'again', 'later', 'scene', 'where', 'Randy', 'stage', 'name', ""'The"", 'Ram', 'suddenly', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'scenes.I', 'choked', 'up', 'few', 'times', 'particular', 'part', 'where', 'Randy', 'seen', 'playing', 'Nintendo', 'little', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'interested', 'not', 'really', 'hearing', 'stories', 'Ram', 'was', 'sad', 'back', 'early', '80', 'wrestlers', 'were', 'devoid', 'proper', 'media', 'marketing', 'such', 'Internet', 'Dud', 'Cd', 'etc', 'not', 'mention', 'lack', 'popularity', 'wrestling', 'had', 'mainstream', 'Note', 'fact', 'business', 'held', 'idea', 'wrestling', 'was', 'absolutely', 'real', 'added', 'was', ""n't"", 'superstar', 'hand', 'slapped', '20/20', 'news', 'reporter', 'twice', 'who', 'asked', 'wrestling', 'was', 'fake', 'WWE', 'admitted', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'fixed', 'matches', 'were', 'absolutely', 'real', 'what', 'launched', 'mainstream', 'Reinforcing', 'later', 'scene', 'see', 'former', 'superstars', 'fan', 'signing', 'resting', 'heads', 'tables', 'actually', 'sewing', 'young', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'are', 'left', 'disregard', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'tougher', 'live', 'injuries', 'had', 'endured', 'so', 'deeply', 'people', 'consistently', 'mock', 'make', 'fun', 'die-hard', 'passion', 'wrestlers', 'fans', 'got', 'more', 'emotional', 'writing', 'review', 'care', 'admit', 'have', 'witnessed', 'more', 'compassion', 'love', 'men', 'women', 'business', 'then', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'popular', 'sport.As', 'far', 'WWE', 'superstar', 'appearances', 'are', 'plenty', 'most', 'important', 'was', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'WWE', 'newcomer', 'R-Truth', 'Where', 'Randy', 'So', 'how', 'been', 'man', 'Randy', 'Hangin', 'swangin', 'brotha', 'priceless', 'topped', 'off', 'R-Truth', 'saying', ""'m"", 'buyin', 'something', 'only', 'fan', 'can', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'smile', 'face', 'time', 'know', 'sacrifice', 'undying', 'commitment', 'superstars', 'give', 'fans', 'night', 'night', 'superstars', 'fans', 'alike', 'only', 'family', 'have', 'left', 'movie', 'willpick', 'slam', 'down', 'again', 'again.At', 'heart', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', ""'Rocky"", 'tribute', 'Randy', 'talking', 'pay', 'phone', 'hear', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 's', 'just', 'want', 'wrestle', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'Fans', 'Non', 'fans', 'alike', 'fan', 'wanted', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'could', ""n't"", 'because', 'was', 'too', 'floored', 'move', 'walked', 'away', 'feeling', 'sport', 'might', 'be', 'staged', 'maybe', 'just', 'once', 'movie', 'everyone', 'can', 'appreciate', 'just', 'what', 'wrestling', 'entertainment', 'really']",N/A

When these actors are riffing, this film is a winner.There are flaws: the movie never makes up its mind if its' a nostalgic lookback at one of America's oldest and craziest professions and at those who continue the tradition - and those who continue because they are convinced they can do no other work and be successful. Another lost opportunity to make this movie Oscar-bound: by not setting up a believable relationship between the Wrestler and The Stripper (MT), both well past their prime (about 12 years too old to be doing what they do for a buck). The relationship would be very real as both are performers, both are equally concerned about ""image"" and both do choreographed steps for the public.So we get a typical drama involving a feminist survivor and the proverbial guy who just doesn't get it.It must be noted that Rourke and Tomei obviously researched their roles, and this goes a long, long way.

Randy is a broken man holding on to his glory days of the distant past and trying like hell to make his life better anyway he can.

So has Mickey Rourke who once had a hot and smoking film career as one of Hollywood's top leading mean, then lost it all in the midst of tragedy, only to return to become an even better actor than he ever was. One only needs to see his 2 short minutes onscreen in the recent Sean Penn film 'The Pledge' to know this is a genuinly gifted actor that can't be tossed aside or forgotten. His appearance in that film is simply the best moment in the entire movie, and that is saying a great deal considering Jack Nicholson plays the main character in the movie, and Jack is superb in that movie as always. Mickey's short appearance is a testament to the genuine gift this actor has. Certainly Randy the RAM was the perfect role to help Rourke plant his feet firmly back in the movie business. He's simply brilliant in this role. While I had never been particularly a fan of Rourke's in the past, his recent perfornances in these two films and a few others has convinced me that Rourke is a textbook example of an actor who was once washed up only to return to prove to the world that he is better than he ever was.

I rented the movie from Blockbuster on Tuesday, April 21 when it came out for rental.  I had heard great things about it but wasn't certain what to really expect, after all, it is a movie.  I no longer watch wrestling but I was a big fan of it back in the 80s when it rose to great popularity.  I could not imagine any other actor in Hollywood who could have outdone Mickey Rourke'e performance as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson.  He had the look, the talk, the bleached blonde long hair, so prominent in 80s wrestling and not only the superficial things but the depth of emotion displayed by the actors Rourke, Marisa Tomei (Randy's love interest who works as a 40 something stripper - although she still looks great) and Evan Rachel Wood (Randy's estranged daughter) whom he has abandoned most of her life.  The acting abilities, the real, heart-felt emotions the actors display are spot-on superb.  Randy was a big star back in the 80s and fast forward 20 or so years and he is no longer the main-eventer that he once was.  His body is not what it once was so he reverts to some steroid use.  He still wrestles but mostly at small indpendent shows and also works on the side at a grocery store deli counter where he is totally disrespected by his boss, a balding nerdy-looking jerk who loves to rib Randy about his wrestling career.  Randy lives in a run down trailer park but the local kids appear to love him and he even has one young fan who is still willing to spend time playing an old Nintendo wrestling game (featuring none other than ""The Ram"" himself).  After suffering a heart attack, Randy visits Pam (known as Cassady at the strip club) and tells her of his plight.  He also tells her he doesn't want to be alone.  She encourages him to talk to his daughter telling him that he needs to be with his family at this time.  At first, things don't go well with his daughter, she disses him and tells him to get lost (putting it politely).  Once again he talks to Pam and tells her he thinks a gift for Stephanie (the daughter) might be helpful.  Pam agrees and they go shopping together and share a beer and reminisce about the good old days especially the rock music (the 80s) at a local bar.  Things seem to get better with Stephanie until Randy is put off by Pam because she doesn't want to get emotionally attached to him for fear of upsetting her plans for a better life.  She tells Randy that she has a young child to look out for and responsibilities but inside she is really fighting her own feelings for Randy.  He forgets the dinner date he has set with his daugher and needless to say she is not happy about it.  I am not going to say any more because I have already given away a good bit of the movie, so you will need to watch it to see the rest and the ""surprise"" for lack of a better term ending.I saw an interview with Mickey Rourke where he stated that he did many of the stunts himself and even actually ""gigged,"" (I always heard it called blading) or cut himself in the forehead with a razor blade.  That surprised me greatly because most actors don't go to those kinds of extremes to make a movie look realistic.In summary, it is fine film with a lot of raw emotion from the three main characters, Rourke, Tomei and Wood.

1237284,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B001TOD92C,R.A. McKenzie,"[20, 25]","Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert often says, ""It doesn't matter what a movie is about, but how it's about it."" In other words, any topic can make a good movie, if the filmmakers & actors use the tools correctly. For too long, pro wrestling has been dismissed in the entertainment community. Darren Aronofsky's THE WRESLTER isn't going to convince people to start watching televised wrestling, but it will certainly put a heartbreaking face on a business that is often called ""fake.""THE WRESTLER begins with a credit sequence, showing hundreds of fake magazine covers and newsclips which detail the rise of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. After the glorious hard rock music comes to a close, ""The Ram"" is seated in a lonely corner, surrounded by toddler tables and toys. His pay is less than he expected. His fans ask for autographs of photos from a time that's been long gone. His home is a trailer that he can't afford to keep the landlord from locking out of.Randy continues to perform, however, because that indominable spirit that exists in most professional wrestlers has overpowered his common sense. After a particularly vicious hardcore match (where the two opponents use glass and ladders and staple guns), Randy passes out. He soon learns that his heart can no longer endure the intensity of wrestling.Mickey Rourke deserves all of the accolades he's received. He clearly performed some of his own wrestling maneuvers, and delivers the kind of performance he's always been capable of since the 80s, but rarely delivered since then. Rourke knows how to look when in the wrestling ring, knows when to brood in his sadness, knows how to desparately relate to the young kids in his trailer park, and even knows how Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson breathes. It's not a show-stealing performance, but a subtle one that draws you in from start to finish.Watching Randy Robinson's life outside of the wrestling ring is where this movie really shines. There are two outstanding performances from Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. Wood plays Randy's daughter Stephanie, a young woman who rarely saw her father, and has becoming increasingly resentful of his absence in her life. It's a shame that the dramatic moment where Randy cries his soul out to Stephanie has been played for critics and TV coverage; thankfully, it's still a powerful scene. It's followed by a touching dance between the father & daughter, in a room with no music, but the two at least have their harmony for that brief moment in time.Marisa Tomei plays Cassidy, a stripper whom Randy frequently visits. Tomei's character gives the ""veteran who won't retire"" story some much welcome depth. She shares Randy's struggle to remain in the spotlight with a generation that no longer wants her. There are several occasions where Cassidy offers the customers a good time, and they bluntly refuse her services. In perhaps the best scene of the movie, Cassidy and ""The Ram"" finally go to a bar together, and reminisce about how great the 80s were for them. It's a scene of masterful acting, where we sense that the two actors are actually listening to the other's feelings. Almost 20 years ago, Marisa Tomei was heavily-criticized for winning an Academy Award in a performance that most thought required little effort. Let me tell you all something, the best actors are the ones who you forget are acting, and when you start calling the stripper ""Cassidy"" instead of ""Marisa Tomei's character"".Mickey Rourke, Evan Rachel Wood, and Marisa Tomei add a wonderful dose of reality to THE WRESTLER, a movie that addresses an industry that celebrates hyperealism. Darren Aronofsky is to be commended for restraining his stylized visuals when he directed this feature film. REQUIEM FOR A DREAM was a powerful piece of anti-drug cinema, but THE WRESTLER is thankfully much more like the gentle ROCKY than like Oliver Stone's supercharged ANY GIVEN SUNDAY. Besides, THE WRESTLER isn't even a sports movie; it's a movie about a sports entertainer. Some wrestling fans might not like how the film focuses more on Randy Robinson than the world of professional wrestling. But hopefully they'll realize that the movie would've betrayed its story by focusing on the in-ring spectacle. You can't feel the sadness of an old-timer's unrequited passion if you're constantly sitting under the bright lights and alongside the rabid crowds.My only critcism of THE WRESTLER is that the in-ring action might not please longtime wrestling fans. There are basically three matches in the movie, and the first one is a frightening letdown. I've been to many local shows, and the main event is never a 3-minute contest. The other two matches are acceptable, and are made better because of their dramatic implications. I will leave you to discover how those play out in the story. In a way, this criticism is a compliment, because I sincerely believe that people who are NOT wrestling fans will enjoy this movie MORE than those of us who are. And when ""The Ram"" makes his final leap to glory, and Bruce Springsteen's wonderful song plays over the black curtain call, we all feel for ""The Ram"". We condemn his self-inflicted damage, but admire his courageous spirit. In the end, THE WRESTLER makes it our responsibility to decide if pro wrestling has destroyed ""The Ram"", or has saved him. I don't which side of the fence you'll be on, but any movie that gets you talking about the fenceline is well worth your time.***PS, how did Bruce Springsteen not get nominated for the Oscar for Best Song?  That is beyond ridiculous!?***",4,Ram Jams Into Your Gut & Penetrates Your Soul,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,5550,"['Chicago', 'Sun-Times', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'often', ""n't"", 'matter',

It was a much-hyped film from the imagination of Darren Aronofsky, who directed Requiem for a Dream- one of the most powerful movies of the decade. However I was expecting to be disappointed after that majestic turd that was ""The Fountain"". And the first time I saw the movie, I thought it was disappointing. But actually, upon a second viewing, that seems to be an understatement- It's a bad movie.OK, yes, Rourke did great in his performance, seeing as not very many can pull off the gritty ""Washed up wrestler"" type figure that has mainly been done (to death) several times before. ANd Yes, it is rather unfortunate he was snubbed. However, I think his performance is what alone saved the movie from a 1 star rating.Basically, the storyline is nothing special. A washed up wrestler moping and whining about his life. IT's pretty entertaining for a bit, but, as it turns, it's more of the same the more the movie unfolds. THe fight scenes are brutal, not pretty, but very well done- they seem to capture the spirit of Wrestling, which is a brutal as hell sport. But the look of the film is not well. It may be the grainy blu-ray look, but the film has muted and washed-out visuals, combined with headache-inducing shaking camera that does get distracting.THe film, thankfully, is not too long- That seems to be a thing with Aronofsky, he keeps his movies short and sweet (thank God for that. Had he done the opposite with Requiem for a Dream, I'd OD on Prozac, LOL!) However, there's almost nothing redeeming about this film, except for Marisa Tomei looking like she usually does, Mickey Rourke's amazing performance, and the fight scenes.

Mickey Rourke is, indeed, remarkable; tough and sweet and sensitive at all the required moments. He was deserving of the many awards bestowed upon him. Marisa Tomei is also fine, in a complicated role that she handles brilliantly.Her innate sweetness is prevalent throughout, regardless of the moment. There's a few short moments involving Evan Rachel Wood, as Randy's daughter, that created the most angst, and brought out Randy's sweetness and sensitivity. Those were special moments, though brief.

The film itself offers a poignant look at the price of fame, the world of wrestling, the complexities of life, the emotional simplicity of fan adoration, and the punishment a performer is willing to put himself -- and his family -- through in a desperate attempt to make the cheering last forever.",5,A Lot to Wrestle With,1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,981,"['scene', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'where', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'once', 'mighty', 'Ram', 'who', 'fought', 'villainous', 'Ayatollah', 'classic', 'bout', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'twenty', 'years', 'previously', 'walking', 'backstage', 'area', 'big', 'suburban', 'supermarket', 'deli', 'counter', 'where', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'take', 'similar', 'walk', 'earlier', 'movie', 'end', 'parts', 'curtains', 'roar', 'excited', 'crowd', 'deli', 'awaits', 'are', 'customers', 'likely', 'be', 'persnickety', 'how', 'much', 'potato', 'salad', 'containers', 'Darren', 'Aronofksy', 'movie', 'incredible', 'heartbreaking', 'performances', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'film', 'poignant', 'look', 'price', 'fame', 'world', 'wrestling', 'complexities', 'life', 'emotional', 'simplicity', 'fan', 'adoration', 'punishment', 'performer', 'willing', 'put', 'family', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'make', 'cheering', 'last', 'forever']",N/A
1237290,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001TOD92C,Robert Moore,"[3, 3]","Update:  Mickey Rourke just won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama.  And the award was richly deserved.Few actors have ever fallen as far from grace as Mickey Rourke.  After a string of lead performances in the 1980s, he almost completely disappeared for almost twenty years.  As Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson and Pam (otherwise known as the stripper Cassiday) agree, the eighties were great while the nineties sucked.  And just as The Ram's wrestling career peaked with his fight against The Ayatollah in the late eighties (otherwise known as Bob the used car dealer), so Mickey Rourke's career as a leading man ended at that time as well.  When mentioned at all, Rourke was known as the victim of some remarkably bad plastic surgery or his forays into boxing.  He did achieve some success as the brutish Marv in SIN CITY, but he still wasn't fully back.  But 2008 was clearly the year of the comeback.  Robert Downey Jr.'s return was widely and loudly heralded (as well it should have been), but it is dwarfed by Rourke's return.  In fact, there is a lot of talk that THE WRESTLER will bring Rourke his first Oscar nomination.  Interestingly, one of his best upcoming roles will be as the villain Whiplash in IRON MAN II, so the two comeback kids will appear together.Mickey Rourke is so incredible as The Ram that it is almost impossible to imagine he was not the first choice to star in the film.  First choice was reputedly Nicholas Cage, but he left the project early on due to creative differences.  Second choice was Sylvester Stallone, who was busy working on ROCKY BALBOA.  But as these things so often do, it seems that everything worked out for the best.  Undoubtedly Rourke's performance in SIN CITY brought sufficient positive attention to garner the best role not merely in twenty years, but of his career.The story is one that anyone can love.  Someone who had once been on top now has fallen so low that he even gets locked out of the junky trailer he lives in.  His daughter won't talk to him and even his partially successful attempts to rekindle a relationship come to nothing when he once again disappoints her.  His body is betraying him and is completely broken down.  He wheezes when he breathes, he wears a hearing aide, and he can barely creep along down sidewalks.  He is clearly someone at the end of the line.The film is mainly filmed with a handheld camera.  The dynamics of a film using a handheld camera are completely different than one using a stationary or track camera.  In the latter, the actor has to play to the camera, being conscious to stay on his or her marks.  With a handheld camera, the camera plays to the actor.  There are many long scenes in the film where the camera follows Randy for long distances down hallways and sidewalks.  Or back and forth as he performs his day job.  The result is more of a documentary feel the makes it easy for the viewer to feel like they are there.THE WRESTLER also gives Marisa Tomei one of her best roles in years.  I've always liked her and have felt that she was unjustly criticized for winning the Oscar for MY COUSIN VINNY.  She gave a lovely performance in that role, but for some reason each year at Oscar time her win is cited as one of the least deserved wins ever.  I find that absurd.  An undeserved win would have been if Sylvester Stallone had won Best Actor for RAMBO.  Like Rourke, Tomei has been getting a lot of nominations for her role as the aging stripper Cassiday.  I may as well say what everyone I know who has seen this comes out and says.  She spends a good amount of the movie undressed.  Any 20-year-old woman in the world would die for her body.  Well, without the tattoos (which were pretty obviously fake).  Like Rourke, Tomei will unquestionably get a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the Oscars and should have a decent chance of winning.  She has little chance in the Golden Globes due to the bizarre nomination of Kate Winslet in that category in a role that was clearly a lead role.This was one of the best films I've seen in 2008 and my favorite Darren Aronofsky film ever.  The film has already won several awards either for Best Film (such as the Venice Film Festival) and Best Actor and will unquestionably get more nominations and wins.  Tonight's Golden Globes should clarify how successful it will be.  But regardless of awards, this is a great movie that I strongly recommend.  And Mickey Rourke's performance alone makes the film a must-see.",5,Shockingly fine performance by Mickey Rourke,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,4479,"['Update', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'just', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Drama', 'award', 'was', 'richly', 'deserved.Few', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'fallen', 'far', 'grace', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'string', 'lead', 'performances', '1980s', 'almost', 'completely', 'disappeared', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'Pam', 'otherwise', 'known', 'stripper', 'Cassiday', 'agree', 'eighties', 'were', 'great', 'nineties', 'sucked', 'just', 'Ram', 'wrestling', 'career', 'peaked', 'fight', 'Ayatollah', 'late', 'eighties', 'otherwise', 'known', 'Bob', 'used', 'car', 'dealer', 'so', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'career', 'leading', 'man', 'ended', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'mentioned', 'Rourke', 'was', 'known', 'victim', 'remarkably', 'bad', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'forays', 'boxing', 'did', 'achieve', 'success', 'brutish', 'Marv', 'SIN', 'CITY', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'back', '2008', 'was', 'clearly', 'year', 'comeback', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'return', 'was', 'widely', 'loudly', 'heralded', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dwarfed', 'Rourke', 'return', 'fact', 'lot', 'talk', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'will', 'bring', 'Rourke', 'first', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Interestingly', 'one', 'best', 'upcoming', 'roles', 'will', 'be', 'villain', 'Whiplash', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'II', 'two', 'comeback', 'kids', 'will', 'appear', 'together.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'so', 'incredible', 'Ram', 'almost', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'choice', 'star', 'film', 'First', 'choice', 'was', 'reputedly', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'left', 'project', 'early', 'due', 'creative', 'differences', 'Second', 'choice', 'was', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'who', 'was', 'busy', 'working', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'things', 'so', 'often', 'do', 'everything', 'worked', 'out', 'best', 'Undoubtedly', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'SIN', 'CITY', 'brought', 'sufficient', 'positive', 'attention', 'garner', 'best', 'role', 'not', 'merely', 'twenty', 'years', 'career.The', 'story', 'one', 'anyone', 'can', 'love', 'Someone', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'top', 'now', 'fallen', 'so', 'low', 'even', 'locked', 'junky', 'trailer', 'daughter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'even', 'partially', 'successful', 'attempts', 'rekindle', 'relationship', 'come', 'nothing', 'when', 'once', 'again', 'body', 'betraying', 'completely', 'broken', 'down', 'when', 'hearing', 'aide', 'can', 'barely', 'creep', 'down', 'sidewalks', 'clearly', 'someone', 'end', 'line.The', 'film', 'mainly', 'filmed', 'handheld', 'camera', 'dynamics', 'film', 'using', 'handheld', 'camera', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'one', 'using', 'stationary', 'track', 'camera', 'latter', 'actor', 'play', 'camera', 'being', 'conscious', 'stay', 'marks', 'handheld', 'camera', 'camera', 'actor', 'are', 'many', 'long', 'scenes', 'film', 'where', 'camera', 'Randy', 'long', 'distances', 'down', 'hallways', 'sidewalks', 'back', 'forth', 'day', 'job', 'result', 'more', 'documentary', 'feel', 'easy', 'viewer', 'feel', 'are', 'there.THE', 'WRESTLER', 'also', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'years', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'have', 'felt', 'was', 'unjustly', 'criticized', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'MY', 'COUSIN', 'VINNY', 'gave', 'lovely', 'performance', 'role', 'reason', 'year', 'Oscar', 'time', 'win', 'cited', 'one', 'least', 'deserved', 'wins', 'ever', 'find', 'absurd', 'undeserved', 'win', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'had', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'RAMBO', 'Rourke', 'Tomei', 'been', 'getting', 'lot', 'nominations', 'role', 'aging', 'stripper', 'Cassiday', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'say', 'what', 'everyone', 'know', 'who', 'seen', 'out', 'good', 'amount', 'movie', 'undressed', '20-year-old', 'woman', 'world', 'would', 'die', 'body', 'Well', 'tattoos', 'were', 'pretty', 'obviously', 'fake', 'Rourke', 'Tomei', 'will', 'unquestionably', 'get', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscars', 'should', 'have', 'decent', 'chance', 'winning', 'little', 'chance', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'due', 'bizarre', 'nomination', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'category', 'role', 'was', 'clearly', 'lead', 'role.This', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2008', 'favorite', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'film', 'ever', 'film', 'already', 'won', 'several', 'awards', 'Best', 'Film', 'such', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Best', 'Actor', 'will', 'unquestionably', 'get', 'more', 'nominations', 'wins', 'Tonight', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'should', 'clarify', 'how', 'successful', 'will', 'be', 'regardless', 'awards', 'great', 'movie', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'alone', 'film', 'must-see']",N/A
1237291,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B001TOD92C,Robin Friedman,"[0, 0]","A Simon and Garfunkel song of the 1960s called ""The Boxer"" tells the story of a washed-up fighter who responds to his life with determination and fortitude. After the singer recounts the humiliations he has faced in and outside of the boxing ring, the song concludes: ""I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains./ I am leaving but the fighter still remains.""This movie and DVD, ""The Wrestler"" has much of the grittiness of the Simon and Garfunkel song as it tells of a character who must follow his chosen path at all costs. Among other things, the movie also reminded me of the tough, shabby yet intense world of the underground writer Charles Bukowski. In the 1980s, Mickey Rourke, who has the lead role in this movie played Bukowski's alter ego Henry Chinanski in an adaptation of Bukowski's short story ""Barfly"".Most of the time, people need to stay within themselves to give their lives meaning. This seems to me to be the theme of ""The Wrestler."" Mickey Rourke, who has just won a Golden Globe award for his performance, plays an aging pro wrestler, Randy ""The Ram Robinson"". The Ram had fought a battle with a wrestler named The Ayatollah in the 1980s, but 20 years later is reduced to cheap matches in small arenas. The Ram lives alone in a trailer park near Elizabethtown, New Jersey. After a particularly violent match, the Ram suffers a heart attack. His doctor tells him not to fight again. The Ram attempts to find meaning in his life apart from wrestling in a romantic involvement with an aging stripper, Cassidy (Maria Tormei), in making amends with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and in taking a day job at a deli meat counter. Believing himself a failure in each of these three respects, The Ram returns to the life he knows: that of a pro wrestler in a rematch with the Ayatollah, even though he is aware that it could cost him his life.The movie has realistically effective scenes of the life of pro wrestlers, of their cameraderie and of the pain they endure even during staged matches, and of their fans. The scenes of the wrestling world are matched by the scenes in the strip club, with Cassidy in both her toughness and her vulnerability. The Ram is shown living alone in his shabby trailer, continuing his training, showing a substantial degree of introspection, and trying futily to make amends to his daughter. The characters and their environs are portrayed effectively, and both Rourke and Tomei give convincing performances.In addition to the Simon and Garfunkel song and to Bukowski, there are parallels to this movie in ""Raging Bull"" in ""Rocky"" and in other movies. The plot may be simple but it remains effective. The acting, the realistic atmosphere, and the quest by the two main characters to find meaning in life in harsh circumstances make this DVD memorable.Robin Friedman",5,Leaving but the Fighter Still Remains,1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,2847,"['Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'song', '1960s', 'called', 'Boxer', 'story', 'washed-up', 'fighter', 'who', 'life', 'determination', 'fortitude', 'singer', 'humiliations', 'faced', 'boxing', 'ring', 'song', 'am', 'leaving', 'am', 'leaving', 'fighter', 'still', 'am', 'leaving', 'fighter', 'still', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Wrestler', 'much', 'grittiness', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'song', 'character', 'who', 'must', 'follow', 'chosen', 'path', 'costs', 'other', 'things', 'movie', 'also', 'reminded', 'tough', 'shabby', 'yet', 'intense', 'world', 'underground', 'writer', 'Charles', 'Bukowski', '1980s', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'lead', 'role', 'movie', 'played', 'Bukowski', 'alter', 'ego', 'Henry', 'Chinanski', 'adaptation', 'Bukowski', 'short', 'story', 'Barfly', '.Most', 'time', 'people', 'need', 'stay', 'give', 'lives', 'meaning', 'be', 'theme', 'Wrestler', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'just', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'award', 'performance', 'aging', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'Ram', 'had', 'fought', 'battle', 'wrestler', 'named', 'Ayatollah', '1980s', '20', 'years', 'later', 'reduced', 'cheap', 'matches', 'small', 'arenas', 'Ram', 'alone', 'trailer', 'park', 'Elizabethtown', 'New', 'Jersey', 'particularly', 'violent', 'match', 'Ram', 'heart', 'attack', 'doctor', 'not', 'fight', 'again', 'Ram', 'attempts', 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'apart', 'wrestling', 'romantic', 'involvement', 'aging', 'stripper', 'Cassidy', 'Maria', 'Tormei', 'making', 'amends', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'taking', 'day', 'job', 'deli', 'meat', 'counter', 'Believing', 'failure', 'three', 'respects', 'Ram', 'returns', 'life', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'rematch', 'Ayatollah', 'even', 'aware', 'could', 'cost', 'life.The', 'movie', 'realistically', 'effective', 'scenes', 'life', 'pro', 'wrestlers', 'cameraderie', 'pain', 'endure', 'even', 'staged', 'matches', 'fans', 'scenes', 'wrestling', 'world', 'are', 'matched', 'scenes', 'strip', 'club', 'Cassidy', 'toughness', 'vulnerability', 'Ram', 'shown', 'living', 'alone', 'shabby', 'trailer', 'continuing', 'training', 'showing', 'substantial', 'degree', 'introspection', 'trying', 'futily', 'make', 'amends', 'daughter', 'characters', 'environs', 'are', 'portrayed', 'effectively', 'Rourke', 'Tomei', 'give', 'convincing', 'performances.In', 'addition', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'song', 'Bukowski', 'are', 'parallels', 'movie', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Rocky', 'other', 'movies', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'simple', 'effective', 'acting', 'realistic', 'atmosphere', 'quest', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'harsh', 'circumstances', 'make', 'DVD', 'memorable.Robin', 'Friedman']",N/A
1237292,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001TOD92C,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","Darren Aronofsky's superb drama ""The Wrestler"" provides Mickey Rourke with the role for which he will undoubtedly be most remembered - that of ""Randy `the Ram' Robinson,"" a professional wrestler long past his prime, who is attempting to mount a comeback both as a fighter and as a father to the daughter (beautifully played by Rachel Evan Ward) whom he abandoned earlier in life.Rarely does an actor get the chance to inhabit a role quite as fully as Rourke does here.  With his bulging muscles and greasy, long-flowing, bleach-dyed locks, Rourke - who did his own stunts for the film - brings an amazing physicality to the character, making us feel every ache, pain and body blow the man suffers, both inside the arena and out, as he hauls his massive, badly bruised carcass through life.  Randy shows that he suffers no illusions about that life, as he confesses to his daughter, ""I'm an old broken-down piece of meat, and I'm alone and I deserve to be alone.""  But there's something about Randy - call it his gentleness of spirit or his self-effacing modesty - that nevertheless wins us over to his side.  Indeed, for all his physical imposingness, Randy is a surprisingly tender individual who knows he's screwed up in life and now wants to make amends and rebuild bridges with the one person he cares about most.This ""soft"" side of Randy is most evident in his relationship with ""Cassidy,"" a stripper who is herself getting on in years.  In fact, Randy and Cassidy are united in the fact that they are both trapped in professions that are less than kind to those who are aging.  Even though the role of Cassidy could easily have slipped over into the-stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold territory, the intelligence of the writing and the subtle richness of Marisa Tomei's performance prevent that from happening.Screenwriter Robert D. Siegel keeps the story spare and simple, not cluttering it up with fancy narrative flourishes or overblown melodramatics.  With the wintry coastal New Jersey setting as his backdrop, director Aronofsky lets the drama unfold at a seductively leisurely pace, allowing us get to know each of these characters and the rhythm of their lives in finely-drawn, intimate detail.  And even though Rourke has elicited richly deserved praise for the physical pounding he endured for the role, it is in the quieter and subtler moments - when we get to see the inner workings of the character he's portraying - that the actor's talent and dedication to the role truly shine through.  It is, indeed, a performance for the ages and one that students of acting will be studying and attempting to emulate for decades to come.",5,When the actor becomes the role,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,2641,"['Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'superb', 'drama', 'Wrestler', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'role', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'most', 'remembered', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'long', 'prime', 'who', 'attempting', 'mount', 'comeback', 'fighter', 'father', 'daughter', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Evan', 'Ward', 'whom', 'abandoned', 'earlier', 'life.Rarely', 'actor', 'get', 'chance', 'inhabit', 'role', 'quite', 'as', 'fully', 'Rourke', 'here', 'bulging', 'muscles', 'greasy', 'long-flowing', 'bleach-dyed', 'locks', 'Rourke', 'who', 'did', 'own', 'stunts', 'film', 'amazing', 'physicality', 'character', 'making', 'feel', 'ache', 'pain', 'body', 'blow', 'man', 'suffers', 'arena', 'out', 'massive', 'badly', 'bruised', 'carcass', 'life', 'Randy', 'illusions', 'life', 'daughter', ""'m"", 'old', 'broken-down', 'piece', 'meat', ""'m"", 'alone', 'deserve', 'be', 'alone', 'something', 'Randy', 'call', 'gentleness', 'spirit', 'self-effacing', 'modesty', 'nevertheless', 'side', 'Indeed', 'physical', 'imposingness', 'Randy', 'surprisingly', 'tender', 'individual', 'who', 'screwed', 'up', 'life', 'now', 'make', 'amends', 'rebuild', 'bridges', 'one', 'person', 'most.This', 'soft', 'side', 'Randy', 'most', 'evident', 'relationship', 'Cassidy', 'stripper', 'who', 'getting', 'years', 'fact', 'Randy', 'Cassidy', 'are', 'united', 'fact', 'are', 'trapped', 'professions', 'are', 'less', 'kind', 'who', 'are', 'aging', 'Even', 'role', 'Cassidy', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'slipped', 'the-stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold', 'territory', 'intelligence', 'writing', 'subtle', 'richness', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'performance', 'prevent', 'happening.Screenwriter', 'Robert', 'D.', 'Siegel', 'story', 'spare', 'simple', 'not', 'cluttering', 'up', 'fancy', 'narrative', 'flourishes', 'overblown', 'melodramatics', 'wintry', 'coastal', 'New', 'Jersey', 'setting', 'backdrop', 'director', 'Aronofsky', 'drama', 'unfold', 'seductively', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'allowing', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'rhythm', 'lives', 'finely-drawn', 'intimate', 'detail', 'even', 'Rourke', 'elicited', 'richly', 'deserved', 'praise', 'physical', 'pounding', 'endured', 'role', 'quieter', 'subtler', 'moments', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'inner', 'workings', 'character', 'portraying', 'actor', 'talent', 'dedication', 'role', 'truly', 'shine', 'indeed', 'performance', 'ages', 'one', 'students', 'acting', 'will', 'be', 'studying', 'attempting', 'emulate', 'decades', 'come']",N/A

But I resisted getting it because I thought it would cover essentially the same ground as that classic Rod Serling film, ""Requiem for a Heavyweight."" I regarded that work as the definitive drama about a battered pug whose days in the ring had left him forever out of the circle - of what is almost everyman's expectation of friendship, love, life.However I finally relented. I got ""The Wrestler"" - and found it to be a different, equally poignant take on that tragic theme. Whereas Requiem is a polished essay, ""The Wrestler"" has a more documentary, cinema verit&eacute; feel about it. It puts a camera in the viewers' hands, allowing us to follow the Mickey Rourke character around through his daily routine.Sometimes we trail after him as he jounces down ramps from the ring into the locker room. We see his small, dyed-blonde ponytail bobbing gamely ahead of us. Sometimes we hang back quietly and eavesdrop as he tries to make some human contact with the pole dancer at his club hangout, or as he tries to mend fences with his estranged daughter.When we think of people selling their bodies to get by, we usually think of women engaged in prostitution. However here we see how men can get similarly rutted into making displays of themselves - with all the losing battles that entails, such as the battle to stay young-looking and healthy. Here Rourke goes bravely into that battle - always one more time. He makes us feel the bitter triumph of pursuing the only course left open to him - the triumph of just doing it.The acting is superb. Rourke transforms himself physically for the role, but at the same time imbues the Wrestler with his own heartbreaking spirit of perseverance.

1237297,AWBSBYIPOYRL0,B001TOD92C,Ryan,"[1, 1]","The Wrestler.This is a tough movie to review for me. I saw it last night, and I'm still kind of digesting it. Maybe I should wait til I've seen it again before reviewing it, but what the hell, I'll write up my thoughts on the movie now, and see how they change with time.Randy 'The Ram' Robinson was at the top of the wrestling world (we learn this during the opening credits), 20 years later, he is broke and wrestling at YMCA's and anywhere else they'll have him. It's a movie about a man that can't let go of his past, a man who is always one match away from regaining his former glory, a man who has ****ed up everything he's ever had....because wrestling is all he knows. He's only truly comfortable in the ring, and the movie is as much about his ring persona as it is about him trying find something in the real world to latch onto.Randy is a regular at a strip joint where he befriends a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), and after suffering a setback after a match, she urges him to reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). Randy's a good guy at heart, and as the film progresses, I really felt bad for the guy as you watch him try so hard to do the right thing, yet constantly **** it up....whether it is his relationship with his daughter, or attempting to turn his ""stripper/client"" relationship into something more.Like I pointed out earlier, the movie is split fairly evenly between his wrestling life and his home life. Besides his daughter and the stripper, Randy is trying to make it with a normal job and some of the movie's funniest scenes come out of this. On the wrestling side, Randy is offered a dream gig; a rematch of his greatest match from his glory days. Randy's convinced that this is the shot he needs to make it back into the limelight, but what is he willing to sacrifice to fulfill that dream?Overall, the movie is just fantastic. It's brutally honest and violent and emotional and almost feels like a documentary. All actors are pitch perfect in their rolls. This isn't a movie for only wrestling fans, so please don't let that stop you from seeing it. If you are anything like me, I have a feeling you'll be engrossed by the end of the movie. Which brings me to my only real gripe.....the ending. When the movie ended I felt jipped. I was angry that something I was enjoying so much would end like that. I was also a bit confused (mostly because it was so unexpected). Given time to think about it, I can appreciate the ending a bit more and I might even be leaning towards loving it. I am also fairly certain I understand what happened now(but I won't discuss that in a review). Also, I feel like Bruce Springsteen's song at the end IS part of the movie....it's not just a filler song to play over the credits, it just sums everything perfectly.The movie is called The Wrestler... and it's pretty damn good.A",5,The Wrestler,1243987200,"06 3, 2009",2009,2876,"['Wrestler.This', 'tough', 'movie', 'review', 'saw', 'last', 'night', ""'m"", 'still', 'kind', 'digesting', 'Maybe', 'should', 'wait', 'til', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'again', 'reviewing', 'what', 'hell', ""'ll"", 'write', 'up', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'now', 'see', 'how', 'change', 'time.Randy', ""'The"", 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'was', 'top', 'wrestling', 'world', 'learn', 'opening', 'credits', '20', 'years', 'later', 'broke', 'wrestling', 'YMCA', 'anywhere', 'else', ""'ll"", 'have', 'movie', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'past', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'one', 'match', 'away', 'regaining', 'former', 'glory', 'man', 'who', '****ed', 'up', 'everything', 'ever', 'had', 'wrestling', 'only', 'truly', 'comfortable', 'ring', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'ring', 'persona', 'trying', 'find', 'something', 'real', 'world', 'latch', 'onto.Randy', 'regular', 'strip', 'joint', 'where', 'stripper', 'named', 'Cassidy', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'suffering', 'setback', 'match', 'reconnect', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Randy', 'good', 'guy', 'heart', 'film', 'really', 'felt', 'bad', 'guy', 'watch', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'yet', 'constantly', 'up', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'attempting', 'turn', 'stripper/client', 'relationship', 'something', 'more.Like', 'pointed', 'out', 'earlier', 'movie', 'split', 'fairly', 'evenly', 'wrestling', 'life', 'home', 'life', 'daughter', 'stripper', 'Randy', 'trying', 'make', 'normal', 'job', 'movie', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'come', 'wrestling', 'side', 'Randy', 'offered', 'dream', 'gig', 'rematch', 'greatest', 'match', 'glory', 'days', 'Randy', 'convinced', 'shot', 'make', 'back', 'limelight', 'what', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'Overall', 'movie', 'just', 'fantastic', 'brutally', 'honest', 'violent', 'emotional', 'almost', 'feels', 'documentary', 'actors', 'are', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'rolls', ""n't"", 'movie', 'only', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'seeing', 'are', 'anything', 'have', 'feeling', ""'ll"", 'be', 'engrossed', 'end', 'movie', 'Which', 'only', 'real', 'gripe', '..the', 'ending', 'When', 'movie', 'ended', 'felt', 'jipped', 'was', 'angry', 'something', 'was', 'enjoying', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'end', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'confused', 'mostly', 'was', 'so', 'unexpected', 'Given', 'time', 'think', 'can', 'appreciate', 'ending', 'bit', 'more', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'leaning', 'loving', 'am', 'also', 'fairly', 'certain', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'review', 'Also', 'feel', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'song', 'end', 'IS', 'part', 'movie', '.it', 'not', 'just', 'filler', 'song', 'play', 'over', 'credits', 'just', 'sums', 'everything', 'perfectly.The', 'movie', 'called', 'Wrestler', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good.A']",N/A

First, any wrestling fan will enjoy this film.  It's all there:  blading, scripting, a great scene with the steroid dealer, the school gyms, appointments with the hairdresser, poorly attended ""fan conventions,"" and the vast array of characters who haunt the sport.  (Necro Butcher makes an appearance!)Second, to supplement his income, the Ram takes a job at a deli counter, resulting in several wonderful scenes.  (Note his boss, Wayne, an excessively overdrawn management type.)  Third, and not to sound too shallow, Marisa Tomei provides several nude scenes which help to take your mind off the Ram's many problems.Finally, the character of the Ram is really unique.  He's not likeable in the sense you'd invite him to the barbecue, or otherwise hang around with him.  Yet it's not like you hate him, either.  You would definitely say ""hi"" to him if you saw him on the street.This ain't ""Rocky,"" and it's not even ""Requiem for a Heavyweight.""  I don't know what it is, but I really enjoyed it.

1237299,A1YDW1CEVP2WX6,B001TOD92C,Scott Carmichael,"[1, 5]","I have a problem with The Wrestler.On one hand, I understand completely what the director and Mickey Rourke set out to do: Make a faux-biopic about a wrestler* (*Who are we kidding, this is a thinly veiled portrayal of Rourke's own career) who is way past his prime and then show how he deals with day-to-day life. On the other hand, the movie tries so hard to make you feel for the character it outright dismisses the idea that maybe this is the type of person many people just wouldn't want to like.To be fair, it's an interesting concept to attempt with a legitimate has-been leading man and surprisingly well acted by Rourke. What's even more interesting is that even though his face is perma-swollen (and his lips look like they encountered a very bad plastic surgeon...multiple times) --- this doesn't make it impossible for Rourke to show emotions (he honestly looks like a defeated individual). Now, granted, it's not like Rourke was playing something completely opposite of himself because let's face it, the character in the movie and Rourke are basically the same guy. Sure, it's technically ""acting""...and well done overall...but hardly a jaw-dropping stretch for Rourke.As for Marissa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood, they both do a decent job with what they're given to work with. Both are your typical clich&eacute;d characters --- both have daddy issues and problems creating any sort of bond with ""Randy."" Even Randy seems to have a cop-out explanation for his life-long focus on being super masculine (later in the movie it's revealed his actual name is Robin...so...um...yeah....). I also want to mention that while Tomei's looks have always been a big draw for me in whatever she's in, this movie seemed to take advantage of her ""appeal"" in certain ways far too often just for the sake of doing so. It's been said before in Hollywood that the best way for an actress to win an Oscar is to take off her top...and...unfortunately, I honestly believe this was Tomei's intention or hopes when making this movie. The ironic part? Tomei already has an Oscar.Getting back to the movie's plot, by the third act everything in the film conveniently falls apart to the point where Randy/Robin says ""the heck with it"" and decides to go out with a bang despite warnings about his health. It was hardly surprising and even less moving when the final moments unfolded on screen.Believe it or not, there have been much better ""redemption"" movies done over the years (I'm not even limiting this style of film to athlete-based movies - 2002's City by the Sea is a great example of showing a parent/child relationship getting mended in a gritty/depressing setting) and The Wrestler brings absolutely nothing new to the table except for a pretty decent role for Rourke. In fact, 2006's ""Rocky Balboa"" is a much better ""washed-up-athlete-getting-another-shot"" movie.",3,"Decent Acting From Rourke, Forgettable Plot...",1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,2860,"['have', 'problem', 'Wrestler.On', 'one', 'hand', 'understand', 'completely', 'what', 'director', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'Make', 'faux-biopic', 'wrestler*', '*Who', 'are', 'kidding', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'portrayal', 'Rourke', 'own', 'career', 'who', 'way', 'prime', 'then', 'show', 'how', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'feel', 'character', 'outright', 'idea', 'maybe', 'type', 'person', 'many', 'people', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'like.To', 'be', 'fair', 'interesting', 'concept', 'attempt', 'legitimate', 'has-been', 'leading', 'man', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'acted', 'Rourke', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'even', 'face', 'perma-swollen', 'lips', 'look', 'encountered', 'very', 'bad', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'multiple', 'times', ""n't"", 'make', 'impossible', 'Rourke', 'show', 'emotions', 'honestly', 'defeated', 'individual', 'Now', 'granted', 'not', 'like', 'Rourke', 'was', 'playing', 'something', 'completely', 'opposite', 'let', 'face', 'character', 'movie', 'Rourke', 'are', 'basically', 'same', 'guy', 'Sure', 'technically', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'overall', 'hardly', 'jaw-dropping', 'stretch', 'Rourke.As', 'Marissa', 'Tomei', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'what', ""'re"", 'given', 'work', 'are', 'typical', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'characters', 'have', 'daddy', 'issues', 'problems', 'creating', 'sort', 'bond', 'Randy', 'Even', 'Randy', 'have', 'cop-out', 'explanation', 'life-long', 'focus', 'being', 'super', 'masculine', 'later', 'movie', 'revealed', 'actual', 'name', 'Robin', 'so', 'um', 'yeah', 'also', 'want', 'mention', 'Tomei', 'looks', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'draw', 'movie', 'seemed', 'take', 'advantage', 'appeal', 'certain', 'ways', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'just', 'sake', 'doing', 'so', 'been', 'said', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'way', 'actress', 'win', 'Oscar', 'take', 'off', 'top', 'unfortunately', 'honestly', 'believe', 'was', 'Tomei', 'intention', 'when', 'making', 'movie', 'ironic', 'part', 'Tomei', 'already', 'Oscar.Getting', 'back', 'movie', 'plot', 'third', 'act', 'everything', 'film', 'conveniently', 'apart', 'point', 'where', 'Randy/Robin', 'heck', 'go', 'out', 'bang', 'warnings', 'health', 'was', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'even', 'less', 'moving', 'when', 'final', 'moments', 'unfolded', 'screen.Believe', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'redemption', 'movies', 'done', 'years', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'limiting', 'style', 'film', 'athlete-based', 'movies', '2002', 'City', 'Sea', 'great', 'example', 'showing', 'parent/child', 'relationship', 'getting', 'mended', 'gritty/depressing', 'setting', 'Wrestler', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'pretty', 'decent', 'role', 'Rourke', 'fact', '2006', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'much', 'better', 'washed-up-athlete-getting-another-shot', 'movie']",N/A

The ability of an actor, script, music and cinematography to pull at our emotional strings and force us to feel remorse or happiness for a fictional character is amazing. It is amazing but unfortunately a rarity in the hundreds of movies pumped out every year, but once in awhile you stumble on a gem, and that gem renews your faith not only in the industry but in the art of story telling.It is the cliched tale of the mighty warrior falling from glory. The gladiator who has grown old and tired, too damaged to please the adoring crowd and too alien to the normality of life to do anything else. It is the story we are shown quite often but rarily do we get the reality of such a situation. It makes you wonder why boxers way past their primes come back to the ring and NFL players who are past effectiveness refusing to retire. It is something foreign to the everyday man who has not endured the bumps and bruises of a life of pain in entertainment to please the adoring crowd. The Wrestler is such a tale, allowing us for a few moments to see the candid truths of a professional wrestler in the twilight years of his career.Having known some wrestlers in my time period, I already knew this tale. Well documented by scenes in documentaries such as Beyond The Mat, I know that an  older wrestler is normally broke, heavily reliant on drugs and damn near suicidal. With the exception of Hulk Hogan and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, you will be hard pressed to find retired wrestlers who are living comfortably through the fruits of their labor. The Wrestler allows us to be a fly on the wall in the life of one of the unlucky old-timers.Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a professional wrestler with a long career of success behind him. With the old aches and age finally dragging him down, Randy is unable to keep up with life outside the ring and spends nights sleeping in his van. His hopes of returning to stardom leads him to doing small independent shows for little to no money until he is hit with a severe health issue. In a vain attempt to retire and live normal life, Randy pursues a relationship with Cassidy/Pam (Marisa Tomei) a dancer at the Strip Club he frequents and his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan rachel Wood). Unfortunately regular life and Randy do not mix well and he is forced to fall back on the only people who have always been there for him... the crowd.The Wrestler in essence is a tragedy, being that it is so absolutely real it feels more documentary than motion picture. Mickey Rourke is perfect and so believable that had he not been a famous actor it would be hard pressed for you to convince me that ""The Ram"" wasn't a real person. Not only is Marisa Tomei absolutely beautiful in this film but she brings a real humanity to Cassidy that ran parallels to some of the working girls I know in life. The movie was powerfully realistic and relevant and I think it will bring some much needed attention to the entertainment/sport of pro wrestling. To top it off the score is so melancholy and appropriate that it plays with your emotions as much as the action on screen.This is not a rental folks, this is a purchase and treasured film for your collection.

A powerful story that transcends the sports entertainment and makes a powerful commentary about relationships and the human condition, The Wrestler is one of the great films of the 21st century.The Wrestler tells the story of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson a wrestling superstar in the 1980's. Twenty years later, he's a middle-aged man living out of a trailer in New Jersey and working at a supermarket packing boxes on weekdays and independent wrestling shows at V.F.W halls on the weekends. His life is a sad, lonely existence and outside of wrestling he has very little connection to anyone save for Cassidy, an aging stripper he's trying to court. His existence is working and scraping up enough money to pay his rent, tanning sessions, and steroids to maintain his wrestling career, working towards a participating in a match celebrating the 20th Anniversary between him and the Ayatollah, now a used car salesman. He's doing okay until a brutal hardcore match with Necro Butcher. In the aftermath of that match, Randy suffers a heart attack that changes his life.Years of wear and tear in the ring and drug abuse have caught up with Randy. Told by his doctor he can no longer wrestle, he must figure out a new way to make a life. After begging his surly boss (a powerful contrast from the supportive wrestling promoters who beg him for work), He works at the deli counter at the Supermarket. It's a painful and powerful contrasting visual as he makes his entrance into the Supermarket deli counter, one that symbolizes Randy's entrance into the real world.Taking Cassidy's advice and tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie. His efforts are rebuffed at first by Stephanie, but she does re-establish her connection with her father and promises to have dinner with her. However, when Cassidy rejects his advances and an opportunity at a serious relationship that night, Randy's world falls apart. Feeling lonely and hurt, Randy goes to a wrestling show to reconnect with wrestlers and wrestling fans, the only people he feels care about him, has and wild night with a female fan. As he returns home and falls asleep, he misses his dinner with Stephanie and she cuts him out of his life permanently. Recognized by a fan at the Deli counter and belittled by his boss, Randy not only quits his job, but gives up on life as well.Rejected by the real world and the real people closest to him, a despondent Randy decides to return to the only place he feels he's loved: The ring. He books the match with the Ayatollah for no pay because it's the only thing he has to live for.A man with nothing to lose and no connection to anyone or anything, Randy goes on to his final match with the Ayatollah. While Cassidy makes one last effort to reconnect Randy to the real world, he brushes her off. A hopeless and despondent Randy goes on to perform his last match with the Ayatollah. As the screen cuts to black before he comes off the top rope for the Ram Jam, the audience is left pondering if this is his last match or his last day living.The Wrestler is a classic. I love the storytelling in this film; it gives us a brilliant insight into the wrestling business and how wrestling matches work. The writing in this film is reminiscent of Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling's early work, a social commentary about the human condition wrapped up in an entertaining story. Randy the Ram Robinson isn't just wrestling in the ring, he's a man wrestling with his own mortality and maintaining his connection to a world that has forgotten him. Outside of the ring he's a lost soul; we see how much the world that has passed him by in the scene where he's playing Nintendo with a young boy who talks about Call of Duty 4. It's like his entire world ended in 1985, from his clothes to the beat-up Dodge Ram Van he drives, he's a relic from another era trying to understand a world and people that have changed while he was grappling in the ring.Director Darren Aronofsky's crafts a cinematic masterpiece filled with beautiful, moving visuals. Utilizing a pseudo-documentary style, Aronofsky's visuals give Randy's story grit, texture and a sense of realism. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie, I felt like I was watching real life transpiring in front of me. There are some shots that are incredibly powerful; the scenes with the old wrestlers at the convention in wheelchairs is one of the most moving pieces of film I've seen in years. We take for granted how much these athletes entertain us, and take no mind to what happens to them when they leave the ring.The acting here is some of the best I've seen. Mickey Rourke gives the performance of his career in The Wrestler. This is Rourke's signature role, the one he will be known for generations to come. I feel he was ROBBED of an Oscar; Sean Penn needs to pack that statue and Fed Ex it to Rourke NOW. Onscreen Rourke disappears and becomes Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. Evan Rachel Wood steals scenes as Rourke's Daughter Stephanie. Her emotions are so powerful in this film; I could feel her pain and hurt coming off the screen. I'm also wondering why she wasn't nominated for supporting actress Oscar; she was perfect in this film. Marisa Tomei is moving as Cassidy, she adds a graceful humanity to her character making us see the hardworking woman trying to make a living to take care of her family. Todd Barry Gives a solid supporting role As Wayne, the prickly supermarket manager.The Wrestler is Shawn James Five-Star Essential DVD.

I am glad that I decided to see it.  It is really very good.It features Mickey Rourke as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a one time star professional wrestler who is well past his prime.  As with many who are used to the limelight, he is having great difficulty giving it up.  He has been reduced to competing/performing in very out of the way places.He is offered a chance to have a rematch of his biggest ever match from 20 years earlier against The Ayatollah.  While preparing for that, he continues to wrestle in the periphery of the wrestling game.  He is also experiencing health problems (has open heart surgery), is trying to re-establish his relationship with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), and is attempting to forge a relationship with a stripper, Pam (stage name Cassidy) played by Marisa Tomei.The story is very well done and the acting by Tomei and Wood is top notch.

It is pretty obvious from the get go that we are in for a great performance. Following a `has been' wrestler who tries to maintain his former glory in various weekend bouts, this film paints quite a sad picture at times. Rourke plays the part excellently where you can't help but like the main character despite obvious flaws. The sub plot where he falls in love with an aged stripper, and tries to date her, mirrors his own physical demise amongst younger, more athletic and often more extreme wrestlers. This film may mean more if you know of the big eighties and nineties wrestlers, but to be honest this is a film about one mans struggle to keep doing the thing he loves and find some meaning in his life and the wrestling theme is merely a vehicle for that. The final scene is actually quite touching and you are left impressed by the acting from all involved throughout the film. This film was reminiscent of the Rocky films (especially Rocky Balboa), due to the run down locations and style of direction and it easily deserves a place up there with other great sporting themed films from the past.

1237307,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B001TOD92C,Steve,"[1, 1]","I've never been a big fan of Mickey Rourke. I always thought he was more sideshow buffoon than legitimate talent. That he squandered whatever skill he had with forays into boxing and his battles with various toxins is irrelevant. The plain truth is that there were no movies where I thought he played outside of himself and I was never impressed with the guy's work. I still feel that way. Nonetheless, The Wrestler is the perfect vehicle for him. This is acting as reality show and Rourke consumes the role of Ram, the washed up wrestler. The wheezing, grimacing, limping, pondering, seething, self-destructive role and actor often seem one and the same. Rourke pulls off the performance of a lifetime, largely because he is given a role so close to his own reality. What variances the original script had from Rourke's life were augmented at his request to better complete the picture. Don't misunderstand me; Mickey Rourke isn't alone in the Hollywood casting agency of stereotyped personalities, endlessly repeating their signature moves. Nicholson, DeNiro, Pacino are all great actors, but all-too-often they fall back on their bag of tricks. Rourke isn't nearly as talented as those giants, but it doesn't matter. Like all the legends of screen, he found the definitive signature role.Marisa Tomei was the real gem of the story for me, however. Tomei showed courage in playing a character that is nude in most of her scenes and she delivers a brilliant performance. Enduring the merciless taunts or the hurtful disinterest from the crowd she attempts to entertain with the most basic tools, she demonstrates the vulnerability and fragile nature of such a career. Both Rourke and Tomei are performers past their shelf life because their success is based so exclusively on the acceptance of their bodies by a fastidious public. These are people trying to find themselves between the persona under which they perform and the reality that confronts them when the spotlight is shut off. Rourke played a role that mirrored his own near-tragic career path, but Marisa Tomei is the real actor here, playing a character that few actresses would have the fearlessness to accept and one that it is safe to say is far from her personal life.The Wrestler is an exceptional study in damaged individuals who lead lives far from the norm. The problem, as Rourke's Ram puts it, is that the real world doesn't care about them beyond the stage. Both suffer in their personal lives because they can't balance one with the other. Robin can't stop being Ram, to the detriment of his relationship with his daughter and Pam can't put aside Cassidy long enough to distinguish between the customer and the man who truly cares for her. The ending is expertly ambiguous because who can say what these sad characters will do next? It's just as easy to imagine the worst as it is to imagine a happy ending. And that's the reality of life.",4,"Role of Rourke's life, Tomei the real star",1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,2914,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'sideshow', 'buffoon', 'legitimate', 'talent', 'squandered', 'skill', 'had', 'forays', 'boxing', 'battles', 'various', 'toxins', 'irrelevant', 'plain', 'truth', 'were', 'movies', 'where', 'thought', 'played', 'outside', 'was', 'never', 'impressed', 'guy', 'work', 'still', 'feel', 'way', 'Nonetheless', 'Wrestler', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'acting', 'reality', 'show', 'Rourke', 'role', 'Ram', 'washed', 'up', 'wrestler', 'wheezing', 'grimacing', 'limping', 'pondering', 'seething', 'self-destructive', 'role', 'actor', 'often', 'seem', 'one', 'same', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'largely', 'given', 'role', 'so', 'close', 'own', 'reality', 'What', 'original', 'script', 'had', 'Rourke', 'life', 'were', 'augmented', 'request', 'better', 'complete', 'picture', 'Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', ""n't"", 'alone', 'Hollywood', 'casting', 'agency', 'stereotyped', 'personalities', 'endlessly', 'repeating', 'signature', 'moves', 'Nicholson', 'DeNiro', 'Pacino', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'all-too-often', 'fall', 'back', 'bag', 'tricks', 'Rourke', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'talented', 'giants', ""n't"", 'matter', 'legends', 'screen', 'found', 'definitive', 'signature', 'role.Marisa', 'Tomei', 'was', 'real', 'gem', 'story', 'however', 'Tomei', 'showed', 'courage', 'playing', 'character', 'nude', 'most', 'scenes', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Enduring', 'merciless', 'taunts', 'hurtful', 'disinterest', 'crowd', 'entertain', 'most', 'basic', 'tools', 'vulnerability', 'fragile', 'nature', 'career', 'Rourke', 'Tomei', 'are', 'performers', 'shelf', 'life', 'success', 'based', 'so', 'exclusively', 'acceptance', 'bodies', 'fastidious', 'public', 'are', 'people', 'trying', 'find', 'persona', 'perform', 'reality', 'when', 'spotlight', 'shut', 'off', 'Rourke', 'played', 'role', 'mirrored', 'own', 'near-tragic', 'career', 'path', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'real', 'actor', 'here', 'playing', 'character', 'few', 'actresses', 'would', 'have', 'fearlessness', 'accept', 'one', 'safe', 'say', 'far', 'personal', 'life.The', 'Wrestler', 'exceptional', 'study', 'damaged', 'individuals', 'who', 'lead', 'lives', 'far', 'norm', 'problem', 'Rourke', 'Ram', 'real', 'world', ""n't"", 'care', 'stage', 'suffer', 'personal', 'lives', 'ca', ""n't"", 'balance', 'one', 'other', 'Robin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'Ram', 'detriment', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Pam', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'aside', 'Cassidy', 'long', 'enough', 'distinguish', 'customer', 'man', 'who', 'cares', 'ending', 'expertly', 'ambiguous', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'what', 'sad', 'characters', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'just', 'as', 'easy', 'imagine', 'worst', 'imagine', 'happy', 'ending', 'reality', 'life']",N/A

It struck me as being a &#34;smart&#34; movie and I figured it would offset the frequent viewings of &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; that I regularly subject my soul to.Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei deliver career-high performances in their roles.  Mickey Rourke is the bone-tired world-weary wrestler he portrays.  I grimaced with every beating he put his battered body through.A little backstory:  Mickey Rourke plays Randy &#34;The Ram&#34;, a wrestler well-past his heyday of MSG and other arena matches.  He works parttime at a supermarket in Jersey, his closest friend is an exotic dancer (played by Tomei) who charges him for her lap dances, he has no contact with his daughter, and he supplements his meager income with small time neighborhood matches.  He lives in a trailer (when he can make rent) and when he can't, he sleeps in his caravan.  He has a shot at a career-resurrecting match but suffers a heart attack before it takes place and is forced to make a decision about whether to retire from the career he loves.  He is forced to take survey of the life he has and decide whether he can handle not being a wrestler.I loved this movie.

Lighter than Requiem and simpler than The Fountain, The Wrestler provides a grittily realistic, and oftentimes sadly humorous look into the life of a man unable to recover what he's lost outside the ring.Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was once a world-renowned professional wrestler in the `80s, but the spotlight has long since left him and he's reduced to touring the independent circuits.  As he struggles to make ends meet, he attempts to repair the damaged relationship with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), and court a beautiful dancer (Marisa Tomei) working at the strip club he frequents.  But life proves far more difficult outside the ring than in and he feels himself steadily drawn towards the cheering crowds he once knew.Randy doesn't wrestle for money or for pride, but because it is all he has left. His inevitable return to the ring against the warnings of doctors (""I'm a professional wrestler,"" insists Randy. ""That's not a good idea,"" the doctor replies) and despite the slowly blossoming relationship with Tomei's Cassidy isn't about choice. He's like Rocky when it comes to heart, but has nothing to prove - not even to himself. He eventually becomes resigned about his many shortcomings, especially in relationships, and realizes that there's only one place he truly belongs. It's never more apparent than in the fantasy-like conclusion and with the end credit song ""One Trick Pony.""The blood and pain is real, even if the fighting is staged. The Ram uses hidden razor blades to summon extra blood when needed and the use of barbed wire and staple guns aren't just props (and they say wrestling is fake). Randy's pain exists even more so outside of the ring, however, when he fails to fix the estranged relationship with his daughter, copes with Cassidy's rejection and struggles with customer service at the Acme grocery store where he works. His inability to succeed in the real world outside of the violent fantasy of the ring is mirrored by Cassidy's job as a stripper - a mask that she believes Randy won't be able to see through. They are all flawed characters set in desperation and a depressing level of hopelessness, but the poignant and convincing performances make The Wrestler a powerful character study, even if Aronofsky's infatuation with digression and emotional torment makes the film often agonizingly bleak.- The Massie Twins",3,The Wrestler Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,2679,"['Depressingly', 'realistic', 'vice', 'versa', 'depending', 'level', 'pessimism', 'Aronofsky', 'Wrestler', 'manage', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'world', 'forsaking', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'adjust', 'change', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'supports', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'downtrodden', 'athlete', 'Lighter', 'Requiem', 'simpler', 'Fountain', 'Wrestler', 'grittily', 'realistic', 'oftentimes', 'sadly', 'humorous', 'look', 'life', 'man', 'unable', 'recover', 'what', 'lost', 'ring.Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'was', 'once', 'world-renowned', 'professional', 'wrestler', '80s', 'spotlight', 'long', 'left', 'reduced', 'touring', 'independent', 'circuits', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'repair', 'damaged', 'relationship', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'court', 'beautiful', 'dancer', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'working', 'strip', 'club', 'life', 'far', 'more', 'difficult', 'ring', 'steadily', 'cheering', 'crowds', 'once', 'knew.Randy', ""n't"", 'wrestle', 'money', 'pride', 'left', 'inevitable', 'return', 'ring', 'warnings', 'doctors', ""'m"", 'professional', 'wrestler', 'Randy', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'doctor', 'replies', 'slowly', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'Tomei', 'Cassidy', ""n't"", 'choice', 'Rocky', 'when', 'heart', 'nothing', 'prove', 'not', 'even', 'eventually', 'resigned', 'many', 'shortcomings', 'especially', 'relationships', 'only', 'one', 'place', 'truly', 'never', 'more', 'apparent', 'fantasy-like', 'conclusion', 'end', 'credit', 'song', 'One', 'Trick', 'Pony', 'blood', 'pain', 'real', 'even', 'fighting', 'staged', 'Ram', 'hidden', 'razor', 'blades', 'summon', 'extra', 'blood', 'when', 'needed', 'use', 'barbed', 'wire', 'staple', 'guns', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'props', 'say', 'wrestling', 'fake', 'Randy', 'pain', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'ring', 'however', 'when', 'fix', 'estranged', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'copes', 'Cassidy', 'rejection', 'struggles', 'customer', 'service', 'Acme', 'grocery', 'store', 'where', 'inability', 'succeed', 'real', 'world', 'violent', 'fantasy', 'ring', 'mirrored', 'Cassidy', 'job', 'stripper', 'mask', 'Randy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'are', 'flawed', 'characters', 'set', 'desperation', 'depressing', 'level', 'hopelessness', 'poignant', 'convincing', 'performances', 'make', 'Wrestler', 'powerful', 'character', 'study', 'even', 'Aronofsky', 'infatuation', 'digression', 'emotional', 'torment', 'film', 'often', 'agonizingly', 'bleak.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

1237319,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001TOD92C,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 1]","""The Wrestler"", the new film from director Darren Aronofsky (""Pi"", ""The Fountain"") is a good film. And it contains a good performance from Mickey Rourke as Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson, a former professional wrestler who now makes a living appearing in smaller venues, letting his body get hit and abused and violated in all and every manner, so he can eke some dollars and maybe a little glory out of the profession he still loves.But ""The Wrestler"" is easily one of the most over rated films of the year. Because it stars Mickey Rourke, who, lets face it, is a strange guy who has made a lot of terrible films, and he is good in the role, everybody seems to be genuflecting at his feet, proclaiming this the performance of the year. For me, that honor goes to Sean Penn in ""Milk"". Rourke is good, but because we are so used to him being mediocre or terrible, many people seem to mistake his good performance for something great.Randy is a man who is too old to be performing in wrestling matches, but he appears in gyms and smaller exhibition matches in an effort to earn a few bucks here, a few bucks there, and maintain his living. But so much of his money goes towards drugs to keep him going and to the lap dancer, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), he likes that he has trouble paying the rent on his trailer. During one match, he has a scary dose of reality and ends up in the hospital. The doctors tell him he can't wrestle any more, if he does, he could die. This is a big moment for Randy and suddenly causes him to become even more reflective than normal. He begins to wonder about his adult daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). Cassidy urges him to make contact so he drives out to where she is living.Part of the problem I have with ""The Wrestler"" is that it is so damn predictable. If you have seen any film about a down on his luck athlete who is struggling to survive, you will be able to predict the outcome of each and every one of these storylines. From the Lap Dancer with the heart of gold, to the daughter who is extremely reluctant to reconcile with her dad, to the former sports hero eager to relive a moment of glory, you can figure it all out way before the individual stories come to a close. You can even figure out how certain stories will shape up and what will make them change. Darren Aronofsky is, if nothing else, a filmmaker who seems to try to make films that are unlike anything we have ever seen before. For good or bad. So why is ""The Wrestler"" so much of a throwback?The film redeems itself considerably with the performances of Mickey Rourke and Evan Rachel Wood.Again, Rourke is good. Not great. There has been a lot of press about how similar the character is to Rourke's own life. I can't say that I have followed his career (or lack thereof) over the last few decades, but Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is a professional wrestler, and a former star, so there is a certain amount of similarity between his life and the strange odyssey Rourke has been on. And the actor throws himself full force into the role, making it seem real and believable. It is interesting to see someone who has appeared primarily in straight to video films over the last few years (with the exception of ""Sin City"") turn in an interesting, believable portrayal of a man trying to reclaim a few minutes of glory, trying to set things right.Rourke's body and face fit the character perfectly and he has added long, greasy died hair to make the change complete. Sporting skintight spandex costumes, he meets with each of his opponents before hand and they go over the routine they are about to perform. Each of his opponents is clearly honored to work with the one time great Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. So it is sad to see him receiving a small bundle of twenties for his appearance, after he has knocked himself out.I think the closest analogy I can come up with is when Tarantino decides to use on of the actors who he loves in a new, career-defining role. There is a certain electricity when we watch John Travolta, Pam Grier, David Carradine or Robert Forster playing roles written specifically for them, tailored to their strengths. The roles thrust them into the spotlight again because they are each good and Tarantino has given them a new character to showcase their skills. But do they deserve an Academy Award? No. And neither does Rourke. With the exception of a coupe of memorable roles at the beginning of his career, and his more recent role in ""Sin City"", Rourke is the stuff of direct-to-video DVDs. Terrible direct-to-video DVDs.Cassidy (Tomei), the Lap Dancer with a heart of gold, is clearly trying to do a job and Randy meets her because he pays her for some pleasure. But Randy forms an attachment to her and wants to talk to her about life, learn about her son, and more about her life during the lap dances. He even thinks that perhaps she is beginning to care for him and starts to confide in her, asking her to come out to his car to talk. Even though this is against the rules, Cassidy recognizes that Randy needs someone to talk to and occasionally steels away for a few moments.Tomei is good as Cassidy, but it is too clich&eacute;d to be anything memorable. Despite the fact she shows her breasts in one form or another, repeatedly, she simply can't overcome the predictable nature of her character or the role.Evan Rachel Wood is good as Stephanie, Randy's daughter who would rather die than reconcile with him. When he shows up at her door, she looks like she has just seen a monster from a horror film come to life. She tells her partner (I'm guessing on this point as the story never tells us who exactly the woman is) she can take care of it and goes outside to talk with him. He pleads with her to give him a chance and she is extremely reluctant. After they talk a bit and he opens up to her, she begins to let her defenses down. They set a date to have dinner on Saturday night.For me, the most interesting aspect of ""The Wrestler"" is to watch the various people who are competing in the matches prepare. Randy and one of his colleagues visit a 99-cent store looking for props. Randy uses two foil-roasting pans and playfully exhibits his idea to the shop owner, who seems to take it in good stride. It is also interesting to watch the reverence with which the other competitors pay to Randy; they respect his previous work, even though he is passing them in the opposite direction.

1237320,A3VZ4LAHI144EC,B001TOD92C,"tomato cow ""JSC""","[5, 5]","I watched this film last night for the first time on DVD. My partner was turned off by the initial violence of it and left the room, but something about the authenticity of Mickey Rouke's character, (Ram), glued me to my seat and compelled me to follow this story through to it's conclusion. I am glad I did, for this film was one of the most powerful character studies I've ever witnessed.This a very different film, in style and substance, from any I had seen. First of all, I have no interest at all in wrestling, and have always thought the 'sport' to be fairly ridiculous and wondered how people could actually pay money to watch such an obvious farce. But wrestling is not the substance of this movie; it is simple the chosen theatre in which we get to examine life through the eyes of one of it's main characters.  What we have here is a penetrating insight into a battered man, two decades past his prime, searching for an identity and purpose in a world into which he finds it increasingly difficult to fit. In watching this film, which is a world of all-too-real gritty reality, we enter into Ram's psyche as he tries to hang onto meaning in his life. One powerfully feels what Ram feels in this film, which really is a masterful feat of acting and directing.There are moments in this film I was brought to tears.  Most affecting for me was his attempt at reconciliation with his angry and estranged daughter, and how his own human frailties screws that up. Anyone who has suffered a close family 'disconnect' can relate.  Very moving was Ram's attempt to enter 'normal life,' as he tried to embrace his new job behind the local deli counter with enthusiasm, and shared kindness, joyful spirit and humor with the customers. Still, it was his past fame that would ultimately corrupt that path. Like most of us, we are continually haunted by who we have been in the past. His attraction and love for a stripper, played by Marisa Tormei was also very heart-wrenching.  As one of his only 'friends', they were a dysfunctional match, yet it was so affecting to see him gradually make himself emotionally vulnerable to her as he desperately desired heart connection with another. But as we see in this film, timing either makes or breaks such connection attempts. Although chemistry between the two is obvious, she would keep a steel cold wall of self protection around herself. Eventually, you see her heart begin to melt with compassion for Ram, but it is too late. One cannot help but feel great sadness for the tragedy of a missed opportunity for mutual healing through love.This is film about reality, and as such, it's not always a feel good one with a happy ending. I ended up feeling great compassion, empathy and love for the character of Ram and for Tormei's character and his daughter. In some ways, he is the archetype of every man. Rourke and director Aronofsky reveal the subtleties that go on inside a man's heart and soul with penetrating brilliance - all cast in an environment of brutality and gritty nastiness. This film doesn't give us an ending, but instead leaves us to make up our own and contemplate the meaning as the picture goes black and Bruce Springstein's song begins. At this moment, I sat stunned. I understand 'the why'. And I feel for this fallible, but immensely likable man, caught in the web of his own identity that has been spun out the necessity to survive. All in all, it was a highly emotionally moving story of human character, told with great skill and sensitivity.

1237322,A2Z1OFP7850LW2,B001TOD92C,"Trevor D. Hoier ""thoier""","[0, 0]","For starters, if for no other reason at all, watch this movie for the performance by Mickey Rourke.  This is one of the deepest and overwhelming/powerful performances you will ever see.  In a one hour and forty five minute span, Rourke makes you like him, hate him, feel sorry for/pity him and possibly even cry for him..it is simply one of the best performances I have ever seen.I have not seen 'Milk' but am looking forward to watching it.  I hate to say this without seeing the performance by Sean Penn, but I can't possibly imagine it is even a quarter of what Rourke pulled off, here.  Everyone knows the Academy and the Hollywood Liberals, in general, are going to give the nod to a peer who plays a physically/mentally handicapped person or a character who is of the non-traditional sexual orientation.  Those are just the facts...you add the fact Rourke is not a mainstream type of personality who intentionally tries to speak out against global issues as if he was the Dalai Lama of humanitarianism, and Sir Mick really had no shot....it's a crying shame (but again, I look forward to seeing Penn's performance).To boot, 'The Wrestler' is a very good movie.  Of course, Rourke's performance has a lot to do with that, but this movie proves that pretty depressing subject matter can make for an extremely entertaining film when there are actual layers to the story (not the artsy films where it's Joe Miserable sitting around feeling sorry for himself).In a nutshell, Randy Robinson is at the end of a successful wrestling career.  He's still hanging on and performs in smaller vanues along the east coast.  His lifetime of prescription drug abuse, steroid/HGH use and the sheer pounding his body has endured over a 20/25 year span has caused severe physical, mental  and emotional damage.  'The Wrestler' is essentially this character study as he tries to hang on, give up, reconcile, find companionship, and figure out what it means to try and lead a ""normal"" life when he realizes that there has to be a life after the ring at some point.I'm sure there are millions of people out there whose careers are much closer to the end than to the beginning and wonder just how in the hell they're going to survive outside of a lifestyle they've lived and loved for so long, but their bodies and minds just can't allow them to do it anymore.  Can they survive?Darren Aronofsky made a terrific movie.  I'd give it four and a half stars if they allowed you to add a fraction in here.  It's very well made and paced perfectly...and I couldn't have asked for a better ending.A movie like this gives me hope for movie making, because it's been really, really lousy lately (I hope they don't remake this in 20 years).",4,You'll Have 'WrestleRmania',1240444800,"04 23, 2009",2009,2713,"['starters', 'other', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'performance', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'one', 'deepest', 'overwhelming/powerful', 'performances', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'one', 'hour', 'forty', 'five', 'minute', 'span', 'Rourke', 'hate', 'feel', 'sorry', 'for/pity', 'possibly', 'even', 'cry', 'him..it', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', ""'Milk"", 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'hate', 'say', 'seeing', 'performance', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'imagine', 'even', 'quarter', 'what', 'Rourke', 'pulled', 'off', 'here', 'Everyone', 'Academy', 'Hollywood', 'Liberals', 'general', 'are', 'going', 'give', 'nod', 'peer', 'who', 'physically/mentally', 'handicapped', 'person', 'character', 'who', 'non-traditional', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'are', 'just', 'facts', 'add', 'fact', 'Rourke', 'not', 'mainstream', 'type', 'personality', 'who', 'intentionally', 'speak', 'out', 'global', 'issues', 'was', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'humanitarianism', 'Sir', 'Mick', 'really', 'had', 'shot', '.it', 'crying', 'shame', 'again', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Penn', 'performance', '.To', 'boot', 'Wrestler', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'course', 'Rourke', 'performance', 'lot', 'do', 'movie', 'pretty', 'depressing', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'make', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'when', 'are', 'actual', 'layers', 'story', 'not', 'artsy', 'films', 'where', 'Joe', 'Miserable', 'sitting', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'nutshell', 'Randy', 'Robinson', 'end', 'successful', 'wrestling', 'career', 'still', 'hanging', 'performs', 'smaller', 'vanues', 'east', 'coast', 'lifetime', 'prescription', 'drug', 'abuse', 'steroid/HGH', 'use', 'sheer', 'pounding', 'body', 'endured', '20/25', 'year', 'span', 'caused', 'severe', 'physical', 'mental', 'emotional', 'damage', 'Wrestler', 'essentially', 'character', 'study', 'hang', 'give', 'up', 'reconcile', 'find', 'companionship', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'try', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'when', 'be', 'life', 'ring', 'point.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'millions', 'people', 'there', 'careers', 'are', 'much', 'closer', 'end', 'beginning', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'hell', ""'re"", 'going', 'survive', 'outside', 'lifestyle', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'loved', 'so', 'long', 'bodies', 'minds', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'allow', 'do', 'anymore', 'Can', 'survive', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'made', 'terrific', 'movie', ""'d"", 'give', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'allowed', 'add', 'fraction', 'here', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'paced', 'perfectly', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'asked', 'better', 'ending.A', 'movie', 'hope', 'movie', 'making', 'been', 'really', 'really', 'lousy', 'lately', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'remake', '20', 'years']",N/A

Those were the days of Hulk Hogan, Roddy ""Rowdy"" Piper, Iron Shiek, Andre the Giant, Capt. Lou Albano, Jake ""the Snake"" Roberts, Randy ""The Macho Man"" Savage, Hillbilly Jim, Junkyard Dog, and Sgt. Slaughter.  My grandfather told me that the wrestling we watched was all fake, but it didn't look fake to me. I was enthralled by the matches, the battles, and the spectacle of it all.  It was thoroughly entertaining.  However, my Grandpa was right. Most of it was fake.  The majority of those matches were staged and the winners and losers were decided long ahead of time.  I've long since outgrown watching ""professional"" wrestling, but those old stars of the WWF hold a special place for me and will hold my interest.Enter THE WRESTLER, the latest film from the director wiz-kid who is a master of cinematography, Darren Aronofsky.  Aronofsky became a star with the movie PI and cemented his place on the echelon of top directors with his follow up feature, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. For a casual film watcher, those movies are difficult to follow and at times even difficult to watch.  However, the cinematography of those pictures is amazing and both those movies ask huge questions about life and its meaning.  Aronofsky's last movie, THE FOUNTAIN, was a bit more flashy, but was also full of philosophy.  Illustrating that he really is a director with a lot of talent, THE WRESTLER is a movie that is completely different from anything Aronofsky has directed so far.Shot mostly on hand-held cameras, THE WRESTLER follows Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke).  Molded after the wrestlers I passionately followed in my childhood, Randy used to be the top of his field.  In the 1980s Randy was a hugely popular ""professional"" wrestler. He was so popular that there was an action figure of him and he was a popular character on a hot-selling video game.  Randy had to have made a lot of money during his career, but the movie never explains what happened to his fortune.  Instead, when we meet Randy he's still wrestling when he can, but he lives in a rented trailer that he often pays for late and is works part-time in the loading docks of a grocery store to make ends meet. He spends most of his evenings at strip clubs and at one in particular he has a favorite girl, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) that he finds himself developing feelings for. One night after a particularly physical grueling match, Randy looses conscience in the dressing room and when he awakes he finds himself in a hospital.  It turns out that Randy has had a heart attack.  The doctors say he will recover, but tell him he can't wrestle again.  His heart attack leads Randy to do some soul searching.  He attempts to let Cassidy know how he feels and reaches out to his college-aged daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood).  Randy really is a likeable guy who, like many people, makes mistakes and ends up hurting those he loves.  He knows the wrestling and the life of the ring, but outside of that he is lost.  He really does make an effort of changing, but the odds are still against him.I really enjoyed THE WRESTLER. Mickey Rourke gives the acting performance of 2008 (even though he didn't win the Oscar) and is unbelievable.  Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood also give some excellent supporting performances.  THE WRESTLER is not a movie everyone will enjoy.  It's a very good movie, but it's also very dark, brutal, and at times violent.  There were times that a few tears came to my eyes while watching THE WRESTLER and there were other times that I was cringing in my seat and trying not to look at what was happening on the screen. Still, everything that happens in the film is so compelling that I couldn't look away and at the end found myself on the edge of my seat hoping that somehow through it all, ""The Ram"" would survive.",5,"Rooting for ""The Ram"" Or the Return of Rourke",1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,3911,"['When', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'used', 'stay', 'up', 'late', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'Dad', 'watch', 'WWF', 'matches', 'were', 'days', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Roddy', 'Rowdy', 'Piper', 'Iron', 'Shiek', 'Andre', 'Giant', 'Capt', 'Lou', 'Albano', 'Jake', 'Snake', 'Roberts', 'Randy', 'Macho', 'Man', 'Savage', 'Hillbilly', 'Jim', 'Junkyard', 'Dog', 'Sgt', 'Slaughter', 'grandfather', 'told', 'wrestling', 'watched', 'was', 'fake', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'fake', 'was', 'enthralled', 'matches', 'battles', 'spectacle', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'However', 'Grandpa', 'was', 'right', 'Most', 'was', 'fake', 'majority', 'matches', 'were', 'staged', 'winners', 'losers', 'were', 'decided', 'long', 'ahead', 'time', ""'ve"", 'long', 'outgrown', 'watching', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'old', 'stars', 'WWF', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'will', 'hold', 'interest.Enter', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'latest', 'film', 'director', 'wiz-kid', 'who', 'master', 'cinematography', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'Aronofsky', 'became', 'star', 'movie', 'PI', 'cemented', 'place', 'echelon', 'top', 'directors', 'follow', 'up', 'feature', 'REQUIEM', 'FOR', 'A', 'DREAM', 'casual', 'film', 'watcher', 'movies', 'are', 'difficult', 'follow', 'times', 'even', 'difficult', 'watch', 'However', 'cinematography', 'pictures', 'amazing', 'movies', 'ask', 'huge', 'questions', 'life', 'meaning', 'Aronofsky', 'last', 'movie', 'THE', 'FOUNTAIN', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'flashy', 'was', 'also', 'full', 'philosophy', 'Illustrating', 'really', 'director', 'lot', 'talent', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'movie', 'completely', 'different', 'anything', 'Aronofsky', 'directed', 'so', 'far.Shot', 'mostly', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'Robinson', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Molded', 'wrestlers', 'passionately', 'followed', 'childhood', 'Randy', 'used', 'be', 'top', 'field', '1980s', 'Randy', 'was', 'hugely', 'popular', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'was', 'action', 'figure', 'was', 'popular', 'character', 'hot-selling', 'video', 'game', 'Randy', 'had', 'have', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'career', 'movie', 'never', 'what', 'happened', 'fortune', 'Instead', 'when', 'meet', 'Randy', 'still', 'wrestling', 'when', 'can', 'rented', 'trailer', 'often', 'late', 'works', 'part-time', 'loading', 'docks', 'grocery', 'store', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'most', 'evenings', 'strip', 'clubs', 'one', 'particular', 'favorite', 'girl', 'Cassidy', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'developing', 'feelings', 'One', 'night', 'particularly', 'physical', 'grueling', 'match', 'Randy', 'conscience', 'dressing', 'room', 'when', 'hospital', 'out', 'Randy', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'doctors', 'say', 'will', 'recover', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wrestle', 'again', 'heart', 'attack', 'Randy', 'do', 'soul', 'searching', 'let', 'Cassidy', 'know', 'how', 'out', 'college-aged', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Randy', 'really', 'likeable', 'guy', 'who', 'many', 'people', 'mistakes', 'up', 'hurting', 'wrestling', 'life', 'ring', 'lost', 'really', 'make', 'effort', 'changing', 'odds', 'are', 'still', 'him.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'acting', 'performance', '2008', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'unbelievable', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'also', 'give', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'WRESTLER', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'dark', 'brutal', 'times', 'violent', 'were', 'times', 'few', 'tears', 'came', 'eyes', 'watching', 'THE', 'WRESTLER', 'were', 'other', 'times', 'was', 'cringing', 'seat', 'trying', 'not', 'look', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'screen', 'Still', 'everything', 'film', 'so', 'compelling', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'end', 'found', 'edge', 'seat', 'hoping', 'somehow', 'Ram', 'would', 'survive']",N/A

I appreciate the quality of ""Raging Bull"", but I cannot identify with its 1940's New York Italian American characters, nor do I know anything about boxing beyond the ""Rocky"" movies.

It's also about a professional wrestler who peeked in the 1980's, and it's '80's rock soundtrack speaks to his life and times. So ""The Wrestler"" is about a working class athlete with problems and hopes that I can recognize and sympathize with. This is a very well made drama, with great acting and storytelling. Marisa Tomei and her nakedness is a bonus, though her nakedness in ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" is much sexier.

1237329,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,B001TOD92C,Unlucky Frank,"[24, 24]","Growing up in the 80s, Mickey Rourke was James Dean to me. His part was too small for me to notice him in BODY HEAT. The critics had caught a glimpse of him and his potential in that film. I knew that I was on to something watching him as the fast talking womanizing Baltimore con-artist Boogie, in Levinson's DINER. His honesty as an actor pierced my emotions, even though he was playing a character that was lying throughout the entire film. When I witnessed his serene and suicidally introspective portrayal of The Motorcycle Boy in Coppola's urban dreamscape of S.E. Hinton's teenage angst novel RUMBLE FISH, I knew that I had just witnessed The Rebirth of James Dean. When I saw his cool slowburning streetwise Italian dreamer, Charlie in THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLIAGE, I knew I had found a film actor I could idolize. I wore my hair like him. I tried to dress like him. I wanted to be him. Man, this was the COOLEST actor taking the coolest parts in Hollywood! Mickey was IT!But, like Dean, it seemed that Mickey would metaphorically and almost literally crash and leave us with only three truly GREAT films. After a few briefly compelling performances in the 80s as the hardboiled Kowalski in Cimino's YEAR OF THE DRAGON, the lascivious John in 9 1/2 WEEKS, Harry Angel in ANGEL HEART, and the hilarious Henry Chinaski in BARFLY, Mickey's career dwindled into lesser leads, bit parts, and cameo roles. Mickey became ""difficult"" to work with. Mickey wanted to give up the studio politics and the collaborative involvement with a craft that he was, quite literally, born to do. And become what? A boxer? The owner of a hair salon? A biker? A thug? Then, Mickey lost himself for 14 years. In a reply to a ten year hiatus question backstage at The Golden Globes, Rourke said, ""Let's get it right. Ten years sounds easy."" Ultimately, he was alone. Mickey Rourke was forced to do some soul searching.Into the 21st Century, no one noticed Mickey's hilarious turn as The Cook in SPUN. A wild and sardonically dark comedy about methamphetamine users. (The Cook watches and adores wrestling on TV while cooking up his dope. One wonders if this gave Aronofsky the idea to cast Rourke in THE WRESTLER?) His sad and tender moment at the end of that film was a revelation of things to come. The final monologue is a wonderful precursor to his character in THE WRESTLER. It broke my heart. Then, a new generation of fans and critics were talking about him again, after grabbing everyone's attention as disfigured Marv in Robert Rodriguez' comic book pastiche, SIN CITY. Sort of a throwback to Rourke's JOHNNY HANDSOME. The best thing about SIN CITY was Rourke's performance. It stood out like a sore thumb. Even over the special look of that film.Now, things have changed for Mr. Rourke. With the critical acclaim (for once they got it right) for this film, he is all over the talk show circuit recalling his loneliness, his mistakes, and episodes from his former life. Like a 12 stepper, Mickey now seems humble and apologetic. Thanking everyone for giving him the chance to once again become the serious actor he once was. (We should all thank them too.) He is no longer taking anything for granted. Everyone loves a humble winner. And God Bless him, Mickey Rourke is BACK! And his performance in THE WRESTLER is a WINNER!The generous Mr. Darren Aronofsky has given Mickey Rourke the role of a lifetime with this film. Knowing Rourke's reputation for being next to impossible to work with, Aronofsky could not get the financing for this film when he first attached Mickey's name to the project, but promised Mickey an Oscar nomination if he would only listen to his direction and do everything he was told to do. Mickey kept his promise, and it appears that the masterly and prescient Aronofsky has kept his. THE WRESTLER was not written for Mickey Rourke, but was later tailored to fit him personally. The themes are semi-autobiographical.The story is not complicated. Although, changed and improvised due to Rourke's involvement, the script, written by Robert Siegel, is reminiscent of a 20's or 30's bloody pulp fiction boxing story that could have been penned by the creator of Conan The Barbarian, the late Robert E. Howard. It is a simple pulp character study about a lonely beaten man who has been to the top of the mountain only to be brought back down again by the repercussions of his actions, and a savage career choice that has taken a brutal toll on his body from staged battles, steroid juice abuse, and a lot of 80's Hair Metal. (The biggest laugh in the film, comes from Rourke's line about Kurt Cobain and what he did to 80's Metal.) Filmed in a grainy Indy style with long loose tracking shots and circular handheld camera movements, it is a sad, gritty, brutal, and COMIC semi-documentary narrative told mostly from Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson's POV. Not every movie goer will appreciate the raw look of this film, the patchwork sequences, or the triumphantly open ending. True film lovers will.The performances here are very brave indeed. Marisa Tomei is essential as Cassidy. She bares it all as a sweet, conflicted, past her prime stripper mom, unwilling to succumb to The Ram and his half desperate attention for her affections. Most 40 something actresses wished they looked this good, but might never agree to pole dance almost completely nude in a film about an aging wrestler. You will fall in love with her all over again in this film. Her Nomination for a Golden Boy is well deserved.Unlike De Niro who donned 40 lbs of fat for his role as Jake LaMotta, Rourke bulked up approximately 40 lbs of muscle on top of his already commanding girth. Rourke is scarred, pimpled, pumped, and battered. His body and visage are roadmaps of world weariness and pain. One grim shot shows Rourke shooting steroids into his veiny, mottled, and scarred rearend. A selfless dedication and adherence to character. A fearless commitment by a great actor to shamelessly open himself up to his audience. Baring his wounded nakedness, as well as the internal wounds to his lonely psyche. And isn't this what we love about our greatest actors? This film IS Mickey Rourke. Body and Soul. This is an extremely giving performance. It is symbolic, commanding, sad, demanding, honest, demure, comic, tender, uplifting, and most of all, heartbreaking.A broken man searches for acceptance, dignity, and redemption, but finds himself instead.The same can be said about The Second Coming of Mickey Rourke. THIS IS A GREAT FILM! Just give this man his Oscar. I can only hope Mick gets his Harley back!This is The Best Film of 2008.",5,"A broken man searches for acceptance, dignity, and redemption, but finds himself instead",1232755200,"01 24,

Granted, this is strictly a drama with only a handful of actors but I never got deeply attached to any part of the film. Perhaps it's because it deals quite a bit with wrestling. And even though that isn't really the point of the film, you can't ignore it.Rourke's character is a battered, practically washed-up pro wrestler who lives in a trailer park, has no money and no family except for a daughter who wants nothing to do with him. He spends quite a bit of time at the local strip club where he befriends a stripper played quite convincingly by Marisa Tomei.To sum up a long story- Rourke wants to get back in his daughter's (Even Rachel Wood) life after he suffers a heart attack. He tries to change his ways by giving up his passion for wrestling and commiting to a relationship with his daughter-and here is where it gets a bit dramatic-but well, not to spoil anything, but I think we can all pretty much guess what'll happen.The minute you feel an ounce of pity for someone, it flies out the window as soon as they do something stupid again.

They seem to be the lowest paid professional athletes out there, but they are subject to all the wear and tear of the big leagues -- of course, the matches and outcomes are all scripted, if you believe this portrayal. Rourke's character, Randy the Ram Robinson, is washed up and too ill to continue wrestling, altho that is the only place he feels he belongs, the only place where people care about him, and it doesn't seem that he can always tell the ring from reality. The scene where he quits his job is a good depiction of this. Wrestling has given him the only recognition he has ever had, and he can't give it up. The movie shows the character with all his flaws -- altho we try to like him, we end up pitying him.  I would have given this movie 5 stars, but there isn't a whole lot of story or plot, mostly a character study. Marisa Tomei does a great job as his stripper friend -- altho that is the one place where it doesn't seem real -- would a middle-aged single mother really have a body that looks 21 if she was not a movie star?

To be sure, the fight scenes are unpleasant to watch; although they are choreographed by the wrestlers themselves, they are still graphic, and the men suffer real pain, blood loss, and other injuries in the ring.But that isn't the focus of the film.  Its focus is on one man, the Ram, who has spent 20 years taking body slams and injuring himself to please the crowd.  Now he's on painkillers, going deaf, having heart trouble, and regretting the years he spent estranged from his rightfully angry daughter.  He's also got a friend, an exotic dancer who has a kind soul and who dreams of a better life for her son.  And he sees how wrestlers end up:  broke, living on disability, in wheelchairs, collecting a few dollars for an autograph or a photo op.Mickey Rourke looks suitably broken down as the Ram, while Marisa Tomei shines as the dancer, and Evan Rachel Wood emotes as the frightfully pale teen daughter.Despite what a few others have said here, this film certainly has an ending:  the Ram's heart is under terrible strain as he goes into the ring for one last fight. That's the way he chooses to go out, and you don't need to be shown explicitly how it will turn out.

Maybe I'm the only one that feels this way, but I've so far seen...The FountainThe WrestlerRequiem for a DreamBlack Swanand every time I've been consistently disappointed by his movie. But why, why is it that his movies constantly fail to make a fan out of me?It's quite simple really:- He's f'ing repetitive in his themes.Every single movie so far has ended in a sad way. I'm not going to spoil the endings of all these movies, but the theme is that by the end of it. You're going to be freaking depressed! This is no mastery of story telling by any means. The plot is thin in every movie because the intention is for it all to be extremely character driven.So The Wrestler. Our hero is a washed up Wrestler who is pretty much a loser that has to take crummy jobs or participate in extreme wrestling so he could have some form of income. He's estranged from his daughter and he's had a history of making bad decisions.Okay, sounds like a promising start. So you watch the movie right? You're thinking, &#34;all right, things are gonna start changing around. Something's gonna happen and his life is going to be back on the right track.&#34;Well it's around the end of the movie and you realize that no, no. The movie is just going to be a total dick and leave you hanging at the end so you could &#34;interpret&#34; your own ending.What a pretentious waste of an hour and 50 minutes! I'm sorry, I came to watch this movie because I heard it was awesome. That I was going to be emotionally touched or moved by this movie.NO! All it did was show me real life. And you know what? This would have been fine, except that he does this for all his freaking movies! It's depressing to watch and completely ruins the escapism aspect of movie watching.You know what was an emotionally gripping movie that had me to tears, had great characters, and a plot that kept going? 3:10 to Yuma with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe.That's a freaking good movie. This? This is over hyped pretentious garbage that is just oh so artsy because it shows you how real life would happen. The daughter is a weak character, she's not interesting, and there's no resolution with her. The stripper is also rather boring and doesn't really contribute much to the story because she's kind of in the background. It's all about The Wrestler, and though he's an interesting character and well acted. Just focusing on what a loser a guy is does not make for a compelling movie.There is no character evolution, he doesn't learn or grow. The movie makes you THINK he's going to change. But the way that it ends? No, he doesn't change, at all. He still makes the same stupid mistakes, still chases after a glory that no longer exists, and never really repairs his relationship with his daughter.Maybe I'm just a freak, but this director is over rated.Would you regret watching this movie?

These people clearly are not middle-aged or they would have some sympathy for what it feels like to still be young and wild at heart and yet dread the onset of old age and their body's failing. Sooner or later, we all learn that though we may grow as human beings, we're essentially the same people throughout our lives and no one ""feels"" like their age.But I cannot make you understand what it was like to be part of a wave of hyper-reality, an ""age"" with it's own ""zeitgeist"". I imagine the people that lived it up day after day (or weekend to weekend) in the city atmosphere of the 1920's would appreciate what those who took life by the throat in the 1980s experienced. Even if you were not a regular fixture anywhere that enjoyed this spirit, you knew it was there - you could feel it: a level of reality above what we normally experience even on our best days, a seemingly endless party we drift in and out of. I experienced this myself in the mid-1990s in the New York Industrial/Gothic scene. And if you were the ""Main Attraction"" as Rourke's character is in the film, this truism goes a thousand times more. It isn't simply his accomplishments that he longs for, it's an time period and it's spirit. The absence of this is what affects his decision most by the end.Before everyone got high, some few took it to the limits. Before everyone liked hard music and biker styles, a few roared like lions at the soft pink Izod shirt/Huey Lewis banality that permeated the mainstream in the 1980s. And if you had a little money and fame you could tear things up in the eyes of your adoring fans and be more than who you actually were. Hyper-reality, the best drug on earth and the most difficult to find or sustain.For a time into the 1990s there were places you could go and things you could do to find this high - subcultures, raves, orgies, bizarre new drugs like Special K, etc.. I found it had all but disappeared for me by 2000 while every part of American culture had become flat and common. Perhaps the latest such high exists on current foreign battlefields for the soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen who enlisted in the War on Terror. Maybe the high has become much more personally expensive than simply having a big hair-do, sleek car, and coke money - now it can cost you your life. I don't know. Only those who serve can corroborate what I'm trying to express.""The Wrestler"" is an unfair film - to believe in the logic of Mickey's final decision you had to have been there, I think - and that's a pinnacle few scaled though all could see from the valley of cultural mundanity.",5,1980s?

What we're here for is for one thing and one thing only: to put your career back on track, to get you back on your feet again acting-wise.  Yes sir!  With my help we need to find you some peppy-perky part, some part where you're safe, you're unhurt, both feet are on the ground and where nobody in the movie makes a face where it looks like they ate a bad lox.

Mickola, listen to me now,  I didn't get to be 96-years-old banging my head in the middle of a facockta wrestling ring. ... I didn't get to be 96-years-old pumping iron.

1237340,AP3B615GM191G,B001TOD92C,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[6, 9]","Being an old-school fan of professional wrestling (I grew up in the WWF's late 1980s-early 90s heyday), I was expecting to thoroughly enjoy this much-hyped film.  Instead, I found it to fall quite flat for me for two specific reasons:First, I think I came into viewing ""The Wrestler"" with too much prior experience/knowledge of professional wrestling.  While the film depicts such unsettling scenes as the locker room drug/steroid deals, the brutal ""death matches"", and the lonely life that a pro wrestler leads, those were things I already knew, thus I wasn't shocked to see them on screen.  Perhaps moviegoers who know nothing about the sinister side of pro wrestling would find those things more horrifying (and thus sympathize with Mickey Rourke's ""Randy the Ram"" character) than I did.Secondly, I just wasn't sucked into what was supposed to provide the drama of the film.  Randy's relationship with his stripper girlfriend didn't quite lend itself to incredible drama, because it wasn't fleshed-out enough, while his relationship with his estranged daughter flourished a bit too quickly to make the climax of the film as touching as it could have been.So, although Rourke does turn in an inspired performance, I felt that the film was a bit too rushed in its dramatic efforts and didn't cover enough new territory (at least for me) to hold my interest.  However, if you know very little about the backstage goings-on in professional wrestling, then this movie may shock you enough to truly care about Randy the Ram.",2,Will Be Better If You Know Very Little About Wrestling,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,1521,"['Being', 'old-school', 'fan', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'grew', 'up', 'WWF', 'late', '1980s-early', '90s', 'heyday', 'was', 'expecting', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'much-hyped', 'film', 'Instead', 'found', 'fall', 'quite', 'flat', 'two', 'specific', 'reasons', 'First', 'think', 'came', 'viewing', 'Wrestler', 'too', 'much', 'prior', 'experience/knowledge', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'film', 'depicts', 'such', 'unsettling', 'scenes', 'locker', 'room', 'drug/steroid', 'deals', 'brutal', 'death', 'matches', 'lonely', 'life', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'leads', 'were', 'things', 'already', 'knew', 'thus', 'was', ""n't"", 'shocked', 'see', 'screen', 'Perhaps', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'sinister', 'side', 'pro', 'wrestling', 'would', 'find', 'things', 'more', 'horrifying', 'thus', 'sympathize', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Randy', 'Ram', 'character', 'did.Secondly', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'sucked', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'provide', 'drama', 'film', 'Randy', 'relationship', 'stripper', 'girlfriend', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'lend', 'incredible', 'drama', 'was', ""n't"", 'fleshed-out', 'enough', 'relationship', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'flourished', 'bit', 'too', 'quickly', 'make', 'climax', 'film', 'as', 'touching', 'could', 'have', 'been.So', 'Rourke', 'turn', 'inspired', 'performance', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'rushed', 'dramatic', 'efforts', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'enough', 'new', 'territory', 'least', 'hold', 'interest', 'However', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'backstage', 'goings-on', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'shock', 'enough', 'truly', 'care', 'Randy', 'Ram']",N/A

I went and bought it, if it sucks I sell it on Amazon.This movie floored me. It is definately a keeper. It sticks with you for hours after you watch it. This movie isn't exactly about wrestling, though wrestling is the stage for this story. This is about a man, dedicated to the one thing he loves and when that one thing he loves is taken away from him and he realizes he is alone with nothing he sets out on a mission to find love and forgiveness.The main core of this movie is Randy 'The Ram' learning about Robin..his real name. Trying to find love with a woman and make ammends to his daughter. Not very easy to do.------Spoilers Below!!!!!!!---------------------------The last five minutes of this film were astounding to me. Turned away by everyone The Ram makes a suicide dive into the one thing he knows. In response to Marisa Tomei's pleas that he not go into his final battle because he might be hurt he tells her the only place he has been hurt is ""out there"" referring to the world.Rourke was GREAT!!!

Disturbing in that it symbolically shows the destruction of the American male.  In particularly the white male. Divorced broke alimented from his kids.  Should have won an Oscar. Most Americas have died for there dream job and have more or less failed to reproduce health families.
