713079,A1XQP1HXYJCUZP,B00006FDAO,Dan Coffee,"[2, 2]","You can read any of hundreds of reviews of these movies. Whether or not you like them is personal preference. What I think needs the most emphasis is that these 2 movies are either cropped or pan-and-scanned for the old 4x3 TV format. The packaging states that both movies are ""modified to fit your screen"". That would have been an irresponsible statement even at the time the DVD was originally released. HD widescreen arrived 2 years before this DVDs production and it was clear from the beginning that widescreen was the future. It is unlikely that either of these movies will ever be popular enough to be re-release in its original format, but the company which markets this DVD is being consciously irresponsible keeping this increasingly erroneous information on the case.  It could have been corrected when other changes were made to the product. The disc itself has been updated. How do I know it has been updated (you ask)? The menu (for both movies) is laid out in the 16x9 format! If 4x3 is the aspect ratio that ""fits your screen"" why is the menu in 16X9? This inconsistency in marketing doesn't surprise me but it does prove that they had a chance to be honest and chose not to.

713080,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00006FDAO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[36, 38]","Those who remember watching The Carol Burnett Show know that Tim Conway is perhaps the funniest actor to ever live.  The two films on this double feature DVD, Longshot and They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way, are not legendary classic comedies, but they each contain a number of very funny scenes and offer an overall kooky good time.  Tim Conway not only stars in both films, he wrote both of them.  Longshot (1985) is particularly noteworthy because it features a reunion of the funniest comic duo of all time, Conway and Harvey Korman.  They team up with Jack Weston and Ted Wass to form a team of all-time losers and underdogs.  They continually berate themselves for passing up opportunities in the past, missing out on some big payoffs just because they are afraid to take risks.  When a stable worker from the tracks tells them he can guarantee the victory of a longshot horse in a certain race, they decide, for once, to go for it all the way.  Their partner in the stables has a special little pep pill that will make the horse run like the wind, and he agrees to slip the pill to the horse if the guys will place a bet for him along with themselves.  Logic and common sense says the horse can't possibly win, but the guys not only place a huge bet on the horse, they borrow all of the money from a local mobster.  As the movie progresses, there is a lot of pretty funny physical comedy, Jonathon Winters shows up to add his own twist of fun to the proceedings, and the ending plays out much better than I expected.They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way is actually the older of these two films, dating back to 1978.  In this one, Tim Conway teams up with Chuck McCann as incompetent police officers who are sent to jail undercover to try to find out where a notorious bank robber stashed the money from his heist.  No one at the prison knows they are cops, and no one would believe it, anyway, as these guys are just pathetically slow about a lot of things.  They find the money a few days before they are set to be released, but to their great dismay the only person besides themselves who knows they aren't really criminals suddenly dies.  Faced with the dire circumstances of a ten-year stay in prison, the duo decides to break out of jail and take the recovered money to the governor.  There are some really funny scenes in this movie, including a truly classic scene wherein Tim Conway finds himself ordered to pull the warden's bad tooth and has just a little bit of trouble with the Novocain - this scenario reminded me a lot of some of Conway's classic performances on The Carol Burnett Show.  Another memorable scene features Conway impersonating a Japanese translator at the governor's party.  Interestingly, this movie features two characters from The Dukes of Hazzard - Enos (Sonny Shroyer) and Ben Jones (Cooter).  This ending of this movie did leave me feeling a tiny bit cheated, but I can't complain about all the laughs I had along the way.If you are a fan of Tim Conway, this double feature DVD is certainly worth picking up at its affordable price; you get about three hours and fifteen minutes of comedy, and you'll certainly enjoy a number of really funny scenes even if the movies as a whole don't live up to your expectations.  For me, the dentistry scene in They Went That-A-Way is worth the price of the DVD all by itself.",4,Two very funny Tim Conway movies,1052784000,"05 13, 2003",2003,3350,"['who', 'remember', 'watching', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Show', 'know', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'actor', 'ever', 'live', 'two', 'films', 'double', 'feature', 'DVD', 'Longshot', 'Went', 'That-A-Way', 'That-A-Way', 'are', 'not', 'legendary', 'classic', 'comedies', 'contain', 'number', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'offer', 'overall', 'kooky', 'good', 'time', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'not', 'only', 'films', 'wrote', 'Longshot', '1985', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'reunion', 'funniest', 'comic', 'duo', 'time', 'Conway', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'team', 'up', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'Ted', 'Wass', 'form', 'team', 'all-time', 'losers', 'underdogs', 'continually', 'berate', 'passing', 'up', 'opportunities', 'past', 'missing', 'out', 'big', 'payoffs', 'just', 'are', 'afraid', 'take', 'risks', 'When', 'stable', 'worker', 'tracks', 'can', 'guarantee', 'victory', 'longshot', 'horse', 'certain', 'race', 'decide', 'once', 'go', 'way', 'partner', 'stables', 'special', 'little', 'pep', 'pill', 'will', 'make', 'horse', 'run', 'wind', 'slip', 'pill', 'horse', 'guys', 'will', 'place', 'bet', 'along', 'Logic', 'common', 'sense', 'horse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'win', 'guys', 'not', 'only', 'huge', 'bet', 'horse', 'borrow', 'money', 'local', 'mobster', 'movie', 'lot', 'pretty', 'funny', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Jonathon', 'Winters', 'up', 'add', 'own', 'twist', 'fun', 'proceedings', 'ending', 'out', 'much', 'better', 'expected.They', 'Went', 'That-A-Way', 'That-A-Way', 'actually', 'older', 'two', 'films', 'dating', 'back', '1978', 'one', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'up', 'Chuck', 'McCann', 'incompetent', 'police', 'officers', 'who', 'are', 'sent', 'jail', 'undercover', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'notorious', 'bank', 'robber', 'stashed', 'money', 'heist', 'one', 'prison', 'are', 'cops', 'one', 'would', 'believe', 'anyway', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'pathetically', 'slow', 'lot', 'things', 'find', 'money', 'few', 'days', 'are', 'set', 'be', 'released', 'great', 'dismay', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'criminals', 'suddenly', 'Faced', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'ten-year', 'stay', 'prison', 'duo', 'break', 'jail', 'take', 'recovered', 'money', 'governor', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'including', 'truly', 'classic', 'scene', 'wherein', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'ordered', 'pull', 'warden', 'bad', 'tooth', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'trouble', 'Novocain', 'scenario', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Conway', 'classic', 'performances', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Show', 'memorable', 'scene', 'features', 'Conway', 'impersonating', 'Japanese', 'translator', 'governor', 'party', 'Interestingly', 'movie', 'two', 'characters', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'Enos', 'Sonny', 'Shroyer', 'Ben', 'Jones', 'Cooter', 'ending', 'movie', 'did', 'leave', 'feeling', 'tiny', 'bit', 'cheated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'laughs', 'had', 'way.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'double', 'feature', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'affordable', 'price', 'get', 'three', 'hours', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'number', 'really', 'funny', 'scenes', 'even', 'movies', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'dentistry', 'scene', 'Went', 'That-A-Way', 'price', 'DVD']",The Longshot/They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way

Stokes,"[0, 0]","The LongshotA group of four buddies (Tim Conway, Harvey Korman, Jack Weston, and Ted Wass), losers, but not bad guys, get a tip on a sure thing at the track--a longshot that's guaranteed to pay off big. The only problem is that they don't have the money to bet big enough to make it worth the while of the guy who's promised to fix the race for them. So they go to the local mob boss for a loan.Which succeeds about as well as Tim Conway's character trying to seduce the money out of a rich dame. That is to say, not at all.It's a comedy of errors, and boy, do these guys make a lot of them. This is a low-key sort of comedy, but the four are such genial losers you can't help but like them even while you know they're going to screw up.My kids enjoyed it, too--in fact, one came in while I was writing this and said ""oh, The Longshot! That was a good movie."" Proof that it doesn't have to be all about slick special effects and frantic action.__________They Went That-A-Way and That-A-WayBumbling small-town deputy Dewey (Tim Conway) and his partner Wallace (Chuck McCann) are tasked by the governor for a top-secret mission known only to the three of them (Dewey, Wallace, and the governor): go undercover in a prison and try to find out where a notorious bank robber hid his loot.Hijinks ensue. And they get wilder when the governor dies, and Dewey and Wallace decide they'll have to break out of the prison.There are some hilarious scenes, like Dewey posing as a dentist and having a bit of trouble with the Novocain, and Dewey and Wallace posing as a Japanese translator and his wife, respectively, but the humor has a distinctly different tone than current humor. I wanted to describe it as low-key, but that's not really it. It's definitely over-the-top, but it's quieter, somehow. Oh, heck, I don't know how to describe it. If you have any ideas, pretty please let me know.Anyway, it was different from most modern comedies, and I enjoyed it.

Some parts of this movie were slow. I would never prob watch this one again.The ""Longshot"" was better with Harvey Korman and Tim Conway teamed up in this one with Jack Weston. Most of this one funny, but some parts could have been left out. These two movies are not for children to watch anyway.",2,OK movies,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,416,"['movie', 'Went', 'That-A-Way', 'was', 'so', 'corny', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'really', 'funny', 'guy', 'should', ""n't"", 'write', 'scripts', 'movies', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'slow', 'would', 'never', 'prob', 'watch', 'one', 'again.The', 'Longshot', 'was', 'better', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'teamed', 'up', 'one', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'Most', 'one', 'funny', 'parts', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'children', 'watch', 'anyway']",The Longshot/They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way

The plotline is you have 4 guys who are losers who like to go to the track and gamble.  While at the track, they get a tip from a track worker about his attempt to fix a race using a 40 to 1 longshot named French Majesty and giving it something that will make it run fast.  The catch is that he needs money to do it, so our four simpletons go ask a loan shark for the money.  They get the money, but find out the mob has their own horse, Papa Chippi, racing in the same race.  After finding out the race isn't fixed, Tim takes things into his own hands, running on the track trying to encourage their glue factory reject to win.  Does French Majesty come back to beat Papa Chippi?  Will the mob break Tim Conway's kneecaps?  Will Stump fix the hose on his fishtank?  All of these questions will be answered in 90 minutes.",5,Got the Longshot,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,901,"['happen', 'be', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'fan', 'love', 'horseracing', 'love', 'movie', 'plotline', 'have', '4', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'losers', 'who', 'like', 'go', 'track', 'gamble', 'track', 'get', 'tip', 'track', 'worker', 'attempt', 'fix', 'race', 'using', '40', '1', 'longshot', 'named', 'French', 'Majesty', 'giving', 'something', 'will', 'make', 'run', 'fast', 'catch', 'money', 'do', 'so', 'four', 'simpletons', 'go', 'ask', 'loan', 'shark', 'money', 'get', 'money', 'find', 'out', 'mob', 'own', 'horse', 'Papa', 'Chippi', 'racing', 'same', 'race', 'finding', 'out', 'race', ""n't"", 'fixed', 'Tim', 'things', 'own', 'hands', 'running', 'track', 'trying', 'encourage', 'glue', 'factory', 'reject', 'win', 'Does', 'French', 'Majesty', 'come', 'back', 'beat', 'Papa', 'Chippi', 'Will', 'mob', 'break', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'kneecaps', 'Will', 'Stump', 'hose', 'fishtank', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'answered', '90', 'minutes']",The Longshot/They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way
