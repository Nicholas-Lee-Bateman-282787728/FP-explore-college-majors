The 1996 dramatic movie is about the confines of strict religion, mental illness, confusion, prostitution, and the power of love and healing.Bess McNeil, deeply loves, obsesses and marries Jan (pronounced Yan) an oil rig worker. When an accident brings him back paralyzed, presumably forever, her pure nave innocent and childlike happiness takes an unspeakable turn with devastating consequences. Emily Watson gives a persuasive portrayal as Bess; veteran actor Stellan Skarsgard plays her husband Jan; and Dodo Katrin Cartlidge is excellent as her real true friend and sister-in-law.Jan convinced of his demise, unable to make love to Beth and orders her to have sex with other men and to come back and tell him about it. This, he says, is the only way he can make love to her and to further stipulate, he says he will die if she doesn't.There aren't any clear answers as to why Jan asks his wife to do this. Is he delusional, perverted, or does he really feel Bess will be better without him? Does Jan really love Bess so much that he is willing to set her free, or is he thinking of only himself when he embarks his innocent wife into hell, cast out from the church, her family, the town. Is he telling the truth when he believes he can make love to his wife via another man's pleasure. Does he sincerely realize that Bess is mentally incapable of handling this request? Did he realize where she was going, what might happen to her? We don't get those answers.During chronological sequence breaks, you will hear the soundtrack - songs from the 70's, Jethro Tull's Cross Eyed Mary, Procol Harum's Whiter Shade of Pale, Elton John Your Song, Yellow Brick Road.  The music is set to picturesque scenes.Same as von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, the camera angle can have that dizzying effect especially when it pans the length of a room.  You'll adjust as this intriguing conflicting plot develops. Again, the movie is long, two hours. There is graphic sex and nudity, both male and female. It isn't advisable for younger audiences. If you have seen ""Dancer in the Dark"" you will again be mesmerized by this complex emotional and moving film. ...Rizzo",5,"Lower Depths of Love...sadness, confusion, religion",1023408000,"06 7, 2002",2002,2266,"['Breaking', 'Waves', 'written', 'directed', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'film', 'such', 'poignant', 'sentiment', '1996', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'confines', 'strict', 'religion', 'mental', 'illness', 'confusion', 'prostitution', 'power', 'love', 'healing.Bess', 'McNeil', 'deeply', 'loves', 'obsesses', 'marries', 'Jan', 'pronounced', 'Yan', 'oil', 'rig', 'worker', 'When', 'accident', 'back', 'paralyzed', 'presumably', 'forever', 'pure', 'nave', 'innocent', 'childlike', 'happiness', 'unspeakable', 'turn', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'persuasive', 'portrayal', 'Bess', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'husband', 'Jan', 'Dodo', 'Katrin', 'Cartlidge', 'excellent', 'real', 'true', 'friend', 'sister-in-law.Jan', 'convinced', 'demise', 'unable', 'make', 'love', 'Beth', 'orders', 'have', 'sex', 'other', 'men', 'come', 'back', 'tell', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'make', 'love', 'further', 'stipulate', 'will', 'die', 'are', ""n't"", 'clear', 'answers', 'why', 'Jan', 'wife', 'do', 'delusional', 'perverted', 'really', 'feel', 'Bess', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'Does', 'Jan', 'really', 'love', 'Bess', 'so', 'much', 'willing', 'set', 'free', 'thinking', 'only', 'when', 'innocent', 'wife', 'hell', 'cast', 'out', 'church', 'family', 'town', 'telling', 'truth', 'when', 'can', 'make', 'love', 'wife', 'man', 'pleasure', 'sincerely', 'realize', 'Bess', 'mentally', 'incapable', 'handling', 'request', 'Did', 'realize', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'answers.During', 'chronological', 'sequence', 'breaks', 'will', 'hear', 'soundtrack', 'songs', '70', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'Cross', 'Eyed', 'Mary', 'Procol', 'Harum', 'Whiter', 'Shade', 'Pale', 'Elton', 'John', 'Your', 'Song', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'music', 'set', 'picturesque', 'scenes.Same', 'von', 'Trier', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'camera', 'angle', 'can', 'have', 'dizzying', 'effect', 'especially', 'when', 'length', 'room', ""'ll"", 'adjust', 'intriguing', 'conflicting', 'plot', 'Again', 'movie', 'long', 'two', 'hours', 'graphic', 'sex', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', ""n't"", 'advisable', 'younger', 'audiences', 'have', 'seen', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'will', 'again', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'complex', 'emotional', 'moving', 'film', 'Rizzo']",N/A

Everyday we experience this breathtaking emotion with both inanimate objects and with other souls.  It is when we finally find true love that nothing else in the world seems worthy or good.  We work as hard as we can to continue this warmth that we feel in our hearts when true love exists, and sometimes that means going to a level we never thought imaginable.That is the central theme of Lars von Trier's epic, Breaking the Waves.  Love has no boundaries as we watch Bess do everything possible (and more) to keep the relationship with her husband together during the roughest of times.  Emily Watson controls the character Bess giving her best performance ever.  The emotion and serenity that is felt, not only behind the character of Bess, but also behind Watson's eyes is phenomenal.  It is not often that Hollywood is able to capture this sort of raw emotion, but Watson pulled it off with incredible talent.Outside of Watson's character, there is the story.  Lars von Trier does a spectacular job of continually building on the foundation that he has begun.  Watson is his foundation, and Trier builds this amazing world around her.  In this film, everything from talking to God to reverberating stories to her husband while he is in the hospital only helps build the story to even higher heights.  I will be honest; I shed tears at the end of this film.  It will pull at every heart muscle that you have and really make you look at your significant other and truly feel the power of love.This is a love story, but not like one we have seen in a very long time.  I don't think we will see anything similar to this again.  It will be hard for Hollywood to emulate such raw talent, groundbreaking direction, and life-changing story.Thank you Lars von Trier for your imagination and passion for love.Grade:  ***** out of *****",5,We do not need bells in our church to worship God.,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,1861,"['story', 'love', 'Everyday', 'experience', 'breathtaking', 'emotion', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'other', 'souls', 'when', 'finally', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'nothing', 'else', 'world', 'worthy', 'good', 'work', 'as', 'hard', 'can', 'continue', 'warmth', 'feel', 'hearts', 'when', 'true', 'love', 'exists', 'sometimes', 'going', 'level', 'never', 'thought', 'imaginable.That', 'central', 'theme', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'epic', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'Love', 'boundaries', 'watch', 'Bess', 'do', 'everything', 'possible', 'more', 'keep', 'relationship', 'husband', 'together', 'roughest', 'times', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'character', 'Bess', 'giving', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'emotion', 'serenity', 'felt', 'not', 'only', 'character', 'Bess', 'also', 'Watson', 'eyes', 'phenomenal', 'not', 'often', 'Hollywood', 'able', 'capture', 'sort', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Watson', 'pulled', 'off', 'incredible', 'talent.Outside', 'Watson', 'character', 'story', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'spectacular', 'job', 'continually', 'building', 'foundation', 'begun', 'Watson', 'foundation', 'Trier', 'amazing', 'world', 'film', 'everything', 'talking', 'God', 'reverberating', 'stories', 'husband', 'hospital', 'only', 'build', 'story', 'even', 'higher', 'heights', 'will', 'be', 'honest', 'shed', 'tears', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'pull', 'heart', 'muscle', 'have', 'really', 'make', 'look', 'significant', 'other', 'truly', 'feel', 'power', 'love.This', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'see', 'anything', 'similar', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'Hollywood', 'emulate', 'such', 'raw', 'talent', 'groundbreaking', 'direction', 'life-changing', 'story.Thank', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'imagination', 'passion', 'love.Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A

It teackles everything from sex, love, happiness and death. But its main focus is on religion. When Bess says soemthing to the point of ""Words can not be loved...but humans can!"" Your heart will break. Entering the church where women are not allowed to speak, she finally finds the voices in her head a little to quiet! She has something to say about her crippled husband asking her to have sex with other men, her mother calling her weak and stupid, her best friend coddling her, her own paranoia spinning out of control finally consumes her and turns all of her misconceptions about life into reality!The actors are marvels to behold! Watson resembles a broken china doll but the star is here to me is Katrin Cartlidge; she is more than Bess' best friend but her conscience and wanna be savior.

Set in a distant, isolated village in the Scottish highlands, it's the story of an innocent, devoutly religious young woman (the brilliant Emily Watson) who  falls in love with, and soon marries, a more wordly Danish oilrig worker.  Despite a lack of money and Bess's husband's need to stay away from her for  extended periods because of his job, their relationship seems to start off  well.  However, it is changed forever when the husband (called Jan) suffers  a near-fatal accident while working away at sea, and comes back unable to  participate in a physical relationship with his young wife.This is where  the real tragedy of this long, lyrical film begins to unfold: Jan persuades  Bess to seduce strangers for sex, then tell him stories of the encounter  soon afterwards.  She unhappily obliges, and we witness many sad scenes of  Bess attempting to play the seductress.  Her situation gets worse and worse  - eventually she takes on the dangerous job of selling herself to  potentially violent foreign sailors illegally docked in ships off the  Scottish coast.  This really is a beautiful film - the deepest sadness  stems from the fact that Bess believes her actions are sanctioned by God  and will somehow help her husband to recover.  Needless to say, the story  ends far more pessimistically than Bess herself would have hoped.

Who but Satan would make such a pact to an innocent naive woman child?Breaking the Waves is a brilliant story detailing the chapters of Bess's life as she tries to live up to the pact of the man that she truly loves. This picture can be interpreted on many levels of good and evil. Our setting is a place that is cold and brutal. Its people follow suit. Forgiveness, love and joy are foreign words in her small religious sect. Repression, being strong and doing one's duty are their gods.You will also find a heavy display of sexism and control of women in the movie. These episodes range from the elders of the church, Jan, the doctor and the sailors. All feel the need to contain the voice of women. Bess can't shut up. She is to good. Her determination to please out of a sense of helping the one she loves defies all logic. Her role playing as god's voice is harsh at times and very judgemental but through that playing she is able to bring some sense to her situation. Bess steps into a world of madness in her attempts to please and be that good girl?The cast of characters did a fine job in weaving together a story that is surreal and highly complex. Such a psychological drama challenges women to claim their own voice. It was magnificently done.

BREAKING THE WAVES, directed by the always-controversial Lars von Trier, explores the concepts of love and faith with more poignancy and more intensity than any other film that I can think of.The movie opens with Bess (Emily Watson) trying to justify to the elders of her church why she should be allowed to marry Jan, a comparatively worldly outsider.  Bess is from a very small and insulated Scottish community, and the church she belongs to is VERY conservative and traditional (not to mention patriarchical).  It is with some reluctancy that the old bearded men finally approve her marriage.Although Bess is not quite as rigidly backward as the church elders, she is a deeply faithful woman.  In fact, as the film progresses, the purity of Bess's religious beliefs transforms her into a saintly, if not Christ-like character.Next to Bess's devotion to God (perhaps even surpassing it), is her devotion to Jan.  Bess loves her husband completely, unquestioningly, almost madly.  In fact, Bess is at first hesitant to tell her husband how deeply she cares for him, for fear that he will be angry with her for the intensity of her feelings.  Fairly early on in the film (and I don't think I'm revealing too much by saying so), Jan is severely injured in an oil-rigging accident.  This is when Bess's love for him is put to the test in surprising and frankly disturbing ways.As with any Lars von Trier film, BREAKING THE WAVES is not for the faint of heart.  The story is difficult, and there is a lot of frank sexuality.  I think any thoughtful viewer, though, will recognize that this film is far from an exploitive shock-piece.  After viewing it for the first time the other night, I found myself (and I'm not religious, by the way) contemplating some profoundly spiritual questions.  What does it mean to love unconditionally?  Do any of us really have pure faith, or are we all too jaded?  Why was it necessary for Christ to sacrifice himself to save us?  Is this morbid, or is it the ultimate demonstration of love?The film is generally heavy, but there are also several light moments.  One of the most delightful aspects of the film is Emily Watson's performance.  While the acting was excellent across the board, I couldn't take my eyes off of her face.  I was reminded of Giulietta Masina in LA STRADA.  Both actresses are extraordinarily expressive and have a sort of wide-eyed naivety that breaks your heart.  Actually, I believe the similarities between the two roles extend beyond the actresses' facial expressions, but I'll leave that for you to contemplate.  First, you've got to watch this movie.  I highly recommend that you do so.",5,intense and spiritually very interesting,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,2687,"['What', 'powerful', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'THE', 'WAVES', 'directed', 'always-controversial', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'concepts', 'love', 'faith', 'more', 'poignancy', 'more', 'intensity', 'other', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'of.The', 'movie', 'Bess', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'trying', 'justify', 'elders', 'church', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'marry', 'Jan', 'comparatively', 'worldly', 'outsider', 'Bess', 'very', 'small', 'insulated', 'Scottish', 'community', 'church', 'VERY', 'conservative', 'traditional', 'not', 'mention', 'patriarchical', 'reluctancy', 'old', 'bearded', 'men', 'finally', 'approve', 'marriage.Although', 'Bess', 'not', 'quite', 'rigidly', 'church', 'elders', 'deeply', 'faithful', 'woman', 'fact', 'film', 'purity', 'Bess', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'saintly', 'not', 'Christ-like', 'character.Next', 'Bess', 'devotion', 'God', 'perhaps', 'even', 'surpassing', 'devotion', 'Jan.', 'Bess', 'husband', 'completely', 'unquestioningly', 'almost', 'madly', 'fact', 'Bess', 'first', 'hesitant', 'tell', 'husband', 'how', 'deeply', 'fear', 'will', 'be', 'angry', 'intensity', 'feelings', 'Fairly', 'early', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'saying', 'so', 'Jan', 'severely', 'injured', 'oil-rigging', 'accident', 'when', 'Bess', 'love', 'put', 'test', 'surprising', 'frankly', 'disturbing', 'ways.As', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'film', 'WAVES', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'story', 'difficult', 'lot', 'frank', 'sexuality', 'think', 'thoughtful', 'viewer', 'will', 'recognize', 'film', 'far', 'exploitive', 'shock-piece', 'viewing', 'first', 'time', 'other', 'night', 'found', ""'m"", 'not', 'religious', 'way', 'contemplating', 'profoundly', 'spiritual', 'questions', 'What', 'mean', 'love', 'unconditionally', 'Do', 'really', 'have', 'pure', 'faith', 'are', 'too', 'jaded', 'Why', 'was', 'necessary', 'Christ', 'sacrifice', 'save', 'morbid', 'ultimate', 'demonstration', 'love', 'film', 'generally', 'heavy', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'light', 'moments', 'One', 'most', 'delightful', 'aspects', 'film', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'performance', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'board', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'face', 'was', 'reminded', 'Giulietta', 'Masina', 'LA', 'STRADA', 'actresses', 'are', 'extraordinarily', 'expressive', 'have', 'sort', 'wide-eyed', 'naivety', 'heart', 'Actually', 'believe', 'similarities', 'two', 'roles', 'extend', 'actresses', 'facial', 'expressions', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'contemplate', 'First', ""'ve"", 'got', 'watch', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'do', 'so']",N/A

This story, set in the 1970's, follows the story of a newlywed couple who love each other unconditionally.  However, that love is put to the test after Jan suffers a severe head injury at his work.  His wife Bess now must do everything possible to get him out of his coma.  Even if that means acting against her strong religious Christian faith.  Jan requests that she sleeps with other men to help save him and so she can still feel pleasure like it's he giving it to her.  Miraculously, revolutions with his health start occurring.  However, Bess's reputation is in jeopardy.Danish director Lars von Trier, also known for 2000's ""Dancer In the Dark"" starring Bjork, is well known for creating films that entail someone who acts terribly or against their morals to save their loved ones.  Those acts become heroic.  Beyond the low-budget camera work are some of the most heartwrenching stories known to cinema.  This effect allows the story to express itself more emotionally without any distractions.  ""Breaking the Waves"" is no acception.  He proves that films do not need fancy effects to be eyeopening.  His unique work unfortunately remains overlooked.""Breaking the Waves"" amazingly maintains its emotional value throughout the film.  This acceptional plot distinguishes the love story and the heroism beautifully.  It deeply explores the characters' backgrounds and emotions, which shares why this story reaches such emotional levels.  Despite the sexual acts not being acceptable in society, Trier amazingly maintains the heroism theme without labeling Bess as unfaithful.  The storyline creativity is beyond imaginable.  This is one of those few films that successfully maintains audience interest with mostly dialect and little action.Emily Watson received her first Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her role as Bess.  Her remarkable talents express the film's emotional value to unimaginable levels.  She was truly one of the best actresses of 1996.  Her research of the character was revalent.  Her challenging performance never loses it touch, considering almost every scene is difficult acting.  Though all the other actors performed will, Watson's performance states itself the highest.Those looking for an emotional film should watch ""Breaking the Waves"".  This is sure to please many audiences.

I had to force myself to watch it, hoping that somehow something redeeming would transpire.  Two and one half hours later I can say that it did not.  I wish I could say that this was a great work of art, but it is not.  It is a sad, very sad commentary on the madness of human beings, a twentieth century ""tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing.""  Particularly depressing were the church fathers in their beards and their stupidity.  And be forewarned, the sexuality is degrading, and the very essence of human love is willfully and repeatedly perverted.In making this movie, Director Lars von Trier no doubt sought a kinship with the tragedies of Shakespeare and the Greeks in which the fates destroy the protagonist because of a so-called ""fatal flaw,"" a flaw the protagonist cannot help.  Bess's fatal flaw was her childlike nature twisted by circumstance.  In the great tragedies the essential purpose is to bring the audience, through its involvement and its identification with the protagonist, to a catharsis, a catharsis that cleanses the emotions and allows us to see the world as it really is, free of self-delusion.  But Von Trier's bizarre and pathetic ending with those ridiculous bells in the sky was closer to bathos than anything else, and steered us not toward catharsis but into a kind of emotional limbo where not even emptiness is felt.",3,Very difficult to watch,984528000,"03 14, 2001",2001,1573,"['Emily', 'Watson', 'performance', 'extraordinary', 'Stellan', 'Skargard', 'very', 'good', 'doubt', 'most', 'degrading', 'depressing', 'tragic', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'had', 'force', 'watch', 'hoping', 'somehow', 'something', 'redeeming', 'would', 'transpire', 'Two', 'one', 'half', 'hours', 'later', 'can', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'not', 'sad', 'very', 'sad', 'commentary', 'madness', 'human', 'beings', 'twentieth', 'century', 'tale', 'told', 'idiot', 'full', 'sound', 'fury', 'signifying', 'nothing', 'Particularly', 'depressing', 'were', 'church', 'fathers', 'beards', 'stupidity', 'be', 'forewarned', 'sexuality', 'degrading', 'very', 'essence', 'human', 'love', 'willfully', 'repeatedly', 'perverted.In', 'making', 'movie', 'Director', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'doubt', 'sought', 'kinship', 'tragedies', 'Shakespeare', 'Greeks', 'fates', 'destroy', 'protagonist', 'so-called', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'flaw', 'protagonist', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'Bess', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'was', 'childlike', 'nature', 'twisted', 'circumstance', 'great', 'essential', 'purpose', 'bring', 'audience', 'involvement', 'identification', 'protagonist', 'catharsis', 'catharsis', 'emotions', 'see', 'world', 'really', 'free', 'self-delusion', 'Von', 'Trier', 'bizarre', 'pathetic', 'ending', 'ridiculous', 'bells', 'sky', 'was', 'closer', 'bathos', 'anything', 'else', 'steered', 'not', 'catharsis', 'kind', 'emotional', 'limbo', 'where', 'not', 'even', 'emptiness', 'felt']",N/A

I think that when Dodo says to Jan that she's not right in the head, I think thatshe is referring to a breakdown that Bess suffered after the death of her brother.I'm not a religious person, but I don't think that the film is blasphemous like some religiouspeople have said.  If you watch the ending it is far more about the grace of God and howHe not only sees all, but understands a great deal more than we give him credit for.  Ifound the ending to take a very pro- religion stance even though the action leading up to itcould be construed as anti-religion.I also think that the town depicted here is a rare one.  I don't think Von Trier was trying todepict a typical Scottish town.As for the reason why Jan asks Bess to go with other men, my opinion is that he believedhe would be stuck in that bed for the rest of his life and he wanted Bess to experience sex,knowing how much she enjoyed it and how much it altered and obviously affected her theday of her wedding.  He thought that she would never do that, until Dodo says to him,&quot;You can get her to do whatever you want.&quot;  Then he knew that if he told Bess to do that,she would, because he remembered how much she adored him.  But, that said the reason Ithink that Von Trier doesn't tell us why Jan has made this request upon his wife is becauseshe doesn't question it, and so neither should we.Also, the reason why Bess eventually goes where she does (in the sky) is because she is likea saint.  Her gift, or so she says, is that she believes and she believes until the end, and Godunderstood that she believes.  He saw her praying and He saw he evil deeds, but Bess -unlike the old churchies who seem as if they talk to God like they know more than He does- believed and that is the most important thing.Now, I don't know how Emily Watson approached her character, but she seems to act oninstinct like Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant rather than a mapped out plan, and for thosewho have said this film is one-dimensional specify why.  I didn't find it that way at all.  Tome the viewer can see that things are working behind the eyes of the characters.

If anything his films court controversy and push the envelope on what is acceptable and appropriate in films. Some of his Danish works, which are less well known, like a strange film called Idioterne, are positively shocking. Breaking the Waves is more mainstream but by no means conventional. The story tells of a nave and mentally unstable young woman named Bess MacNeil (played startlingly by Emily Watson). She has been reared in a very conservative and religious community (women are not allowed to speak in the church, people are judged harshly by the church, and they can easily be shunned for their activities. Outsiders are not easily welcomed into this community). Bess marries an oil rig worker named Jan (an excellent Stellan Skarsgard. He is an outsider to the community and is not easily accepted. The beginning of the film tells the tale of their marriage, Bess's exploration of sexuality with her new husband, Bess's childlike innocence and mental instability... and how she copes (or does not cope) with Jan's frequent absences. Eventually Jan succumbs to an accident on the oil rig and has to return home. He is hospitalised and is paralysed, and it is thought that he will be paralysed for life. He cannot bear to see his wife especially knowing that he cannot perform his husbandly duties, so he convinces her to go out and experiment sexually with as many men as she can. He convinces her that this helps him when really he is trying to do it for her. Not to add that he is doped up on pain medication.

One thing I'd like to stress first is just what a great parallel to ""Dancer in the Dark"" it is. The two characters Bess and Selma are extremely different from one another yet they both share a common bond of simply being incredibly ""good"". ""Breaking the Waves"" is primarily about sex and God, whereas in ""Dancer in the Dark"" God never gets mentioned and there's not even sexual tension, the focus being on motherhood and a beautiful kind of introspection. Bess talks to God on a regular basis, Selma has no one to talk to. But damned if they're not exactly like each other! Anyway, if you pay attention while watching this movie you'll notice just how much care and precision went into every scene, every single camera shot. It's almost creepy because you really do feel like Von Trier is trying to work his way into your brain, in a way that's very subtle but all the more disturbing for that reason. I think the people who give negative reviews to this movie do so because they don't understand that it's just a really simple story whose main focus is on how f---ed up the world is and how good people - the best among us -  tend to be misunderstood and cast aside.

I'm a Kierkegaard freak and the plot and the a lot of the motifs look like a wholesale rip off of &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; and other books of Kierkegaard's works. This  impression was overwhelmingly confirmed by the ending. Then I discovered  the screenwriter-director is a native of Kierkegaard's hometown in Denmark,  which convinced me even further. This, of course, means that I think the  movie is intensely religious, that Emily Watson's character is a saint,  that the movie is essentially about religious sacrifice. Religion is,  ultimately, involved in the the transcendence of routinized religious  authority (represented by the deacons of the local Kirke).  They  hypocratically condemn souls to Hell, based on visible criterea, when a  God-relationship is invisible. This means they must condemn the saints for  being closer to god than they are. This problem provides a central focus of  the film.  There is also the moment, as Emily Watson's character dies, when  she reflects that she might have been mistaken in her understanding of god.  This moment reminds me of the cry from the Cross in Mark's Gospel: My god,  my god, why have you forsaken me.

The film is completely, unabashedly melodramatic. It manages to hit heights that few films can, since it fearlessly risks alienating us. It's not the director's best film (Dancer in the Dark) but it's easily on of the top 20 films of the 90's.One interesting thing that I read the other day regarded the use of the chapter headings in the movie. Von Trier called them rather offhandedly &quot;God's point of view&quot;. Certainly, in light of that they become really relevant to the film. They are all gorgeous &amp; shot on a normal film stock. If they're taken to be God's point of view, we can see all along that the events that take place are all part of God's plan. Furthermore, the scenes that aren't from God's POV are bleached out in color. this suggests only God can see the beauty in the world (and Bess' actions). Until I thought of them this way, they were mildly problematic for me. Of course until you see the whole film, there's no way to really come to this interpretation on your own, but it's food for thought.If you haven't seen this film yet, stop reading and seek it out.

Well, after watching &#34;Anti Christ,&#34; &#34;Melancholia,&#34; and &#34;Nymphomaniac I & II,&#34; I've started going through all of the films von Trier has made. And of course, I read reviews of every movie I watch, and somewhere along the line, I read a review of &#34;The English Patient,&#34; one of my favorites (Top 50 maybe) that mentioned that, although very good, it didn't stand up to &#34;Breaking the Waves.&#34; Hah, I thought. We'll see. So I rented this, and it instantly took its place into my Top 5 (maybe I'll identify all five someday). This is one of those works of art that literally changed my life. It is transcendent: spiritually, emotionally, artistically, even physically. And Emily Watson's performance was literally out of this world. I wasn't able to sleep for a full day after watching it. I think this movie actually accomplishes what Mel Gibson wanted to do with &#34;Passion of the Christ&#34; but failed at so miserably. I'm not a religious person, but I do have a strong sense of the spiritual. My best friend calls me an &#34;Agnostic with Possibilities.&#34; &#34;Breaking the Waves confirmed why I hold onto those possibilities. &#34;Breaking the Waves&#34; is not an entertainment; it's a life experience, and although I'm interested and at times highly impressed by these other von Trier movies, none of them come anywhere close to &#34;Breaking the Waves.&#34;",5,Move Over Top 5!,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,1895,"['not', 'unusual', 'watch', '10', 'more', 'movies', 'week', 'especially', 'now', ""'m"", 'retired', 'Been', 'true', 'film', 'fanatic', 'life', 'friends', 'will', 'ask', 'what', 'top', '5', '10', '100', 'movies', 'are', 'Top', '100', 'fairly', 'easy', 'when', 'Top', '5', '10', 'usually', 'have', 'say', 'can', 'only', 'provide', 'let', 'break', 'down', 'genres', 'Nevertheless', 'pressed', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'Top', '10', 'even', '5', 'rare', 'have', 'make', 'room', 'lists', 'something', 'new', 'Well', 'watching', '34', 'Anti', 'Christ', '34', '34', 'Melancholia', '34', '34', 'Nymphomaniac', 'II', '34', ""'ve"", 'started', 'going', 'films', 'von', 'Trier', 'made', 'course', 'read', 'reviews', 'movie', 'watch', 'somewhere', 'line', 'read', 'review', '34', 'English', 'Patient', '34', 'one', 'favorites', 'Top', '50', 'maybe', 'mentioned', 'very', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', '34', 'Breaking', 'Waves.', '34', 'Hah', 'thought', ""'ll"", 'see', 'rented', 'instantly', 'took', 'place', 'Top', '5', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'identify', 'five', 'someday', 'one', 'works', 'art', 'literally', 'changed', 'life', 'transcendent', 'spiritually', 'emotionally', 'artistically', 'even', 'physically', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'performance', 'was', 'literally', 'world', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'sleep', 'full', 'day', 'watching', 'think', 'movie', 'actually', 'what', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'wanted', 'do', '34', 'Passion', 'Christ', '34', 'failed', 'so', 'miserably', ""'m"", 'not', 'religious', 'person', 'do', 'have', 'strong', 'sense', 'spiritual', 'best', 'friend', '34', 'Agnostic', 'Possibilities.', '34', '34', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'confirmed', 'why', 'hold', 'possibilities', '34', 'Breaking', 'Waves', '34', 'not', 'entertainment', 'life', 'experience', ""'m"", 'interested', 'times', 'highly', 'impressed', 'other', 'von', 'Trier', 'movies', 'none', 'come', 'anywhere', 'close', '34', 'Breaking', 'Waves.', '34']",N/A

Such love in real life invites abuse, abandonment, and eventual scorn from the massive egos created by the backfiring love. The husband and friends portrayed in this film unrealistically accept, adorn, and appreciate this love instead.So are we to believe Bess' love was pure or Christ like that this love had a different effect on people? Was it the director's intent to make us believe so with the bells ringing at the end of the film? No Bess was mentally and emotionally ill. Afer all Christ didn't cry every two minutes over some trivial incident.So do the mentally ill go to heaven. Doubt it! Most mentally ill cause as much or more suffering to their family and friends as they suffer themselves. The husband and friends of Bess suffered alot because of her - that part of the film was true.

Nonetheless, Bess gets the Church elders approval, after some hesitation, to marry an outsider.  This outsider is Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsgrd), an oil rig worker on the North Sea.  Bess and Jan are so much in love that Bess declares her love for Jan in the bathroom of their reception by saying ""You can love me now!"", which leads to Bess loosing her virginity.  This is the beginning of her sexual transformation as her love expands for Jan and in appreciation she thanks God for the gift of love that he has given her.  However, the honeymoon must come to an end as Jan must return to the oil rig to earn a living.  On the oil rig Jan is seriously injured in an accident, which leads the audience into a relentlessly tragic story about faith, loss, and love.Breaking the Waves is broken up in different chapters and in between the chapters von Tier uses scenic shots that are artistically enhanced.  These shots cue the audience on the upcoming chapter as it deals with different issues around Bess and Jan's relationship.  The film is shot in a Dogma 95 style that von Tier introduced to the public in 1995, which adds to the realism of the story.  In addition, the cast performs brilliantly as they help paint the true vision of Lars von Tier in a brilliant cinematic experience that some will love and some will hate as the story forces the audience to choose a side.",5,"von Tier's relentless tragedy about faith, loss, and love...",1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,1554,"['Bess', 'McNeil', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'naive', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'oppressive', 'environment', 'patriarchal', 'Christian', 'where', 'Christian', 'rules', 'are', 'worshipped', 'else', 'Nonetheless', 'Bess', 'Church', 'elders', 'approval', 'hesitation', 'marry', 'outsider', 'outsider', 'Jan', 'Nyman', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'oil', 'rig', 'worker', 'North', 'Sea', 'Bess', 'Jan', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'Bess', 'love', 'Jan', 'bathroom', 'reception', 'saying', 'can', 'love', 'now', 'Bess', 'loosing', 'virginity', 'beginning', 'sexual', 'transformation', 'love', 'Jan', 'appreciation', 'God', 'gift', 'love', 'given', 'However', 'honeymoon', 'must', 'come', 'end', 'Jan', 'must', 'return', 'oil', 'rig', 'earn', 'living', 'oil', 'rig', 'Jan', 'seriously', 'injured', 'accident', 'audience', 'relentlessly', 'tragic', 'story', 'faith', 'loss', 'love.Breaking', 'Waves', 'broken', 'up', 'different', 'chapters', 'chapters', 'von', 'Tier', 'scenic', 'shots', 'are', 'artistically', 'enhanced', 'shots', 'cue', 'audience', 'upcoming', 'chapter', 'different', 'issues', 'Bess', 'Jan', 'relationship', 'film', 'shot', 'Dogma', '95', 'style', 'Tier', 'introduced', 'public', '1995', 'realism', 'story', 'addition', 'cast', 'brilliantly', 'help', 'paint', 'true', 'vision', 'Lars', 'von', 'Tier', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'will', 'love', 'will', 'hate', 'story', 'audience', 'choose', 'side']",N/A

Watson is the mentally unstable Bess, who talks to God (God seems to talk back in her  voice). Bess, a virgin, marries the burly but sensitive oil-rig worker Jan  (Stellan Skarsgard). Once she tastes the joys of sex, Bess becomes  delirious with love for Jan. But soon he must return to the oil rig, where  he has an accident that paralyzes him. The erratic and heavily medicated  Jan takes it into his head to ask Bess a favor: she must sleep with other  men, and tell him about the encounters, to keep him alive. Both Jan and God  seem to want Bess to go through with it.It's a mistake to take this sort  of fable literally, but director Lars von Trier makes everything seem  realistic with artsy touches like handheld camerawork, jump cuts, and  saturated photography (by Robby Muller). He also, for whatever reason,  divides the movie into chapters, and the chapter headings are surreal  landscapes with sometimes grating '70s rock songs played over them. You nod  and understand all the points von Trier is making, but everything is so  symbolic and predetermined that it seldom truly reaches you. The film is  haunting but mechanistic and, in its last third, borderline ludicrous --  the meaningful masochism gets to be more than a little much. Yet Emily  Watson, who's in almost every frame, very nearly puts the entire gigantic  daft movie across all by herself. Her elastic face is a playhouse for  violently conflicting emotions, and she's never less than touching. With  anyone else in the role (like Helena Bonham-Carter, who was going to do it  but dropped out), the movie would probably collapse.Note: Nothing on the  featured cover artwork or in Amazon.com's description indicates whether  this DVD is letterboxed.

I'm a devout believer in Christ, as well, and understand why the sex scenes and the degradation the character endures are offputting.  Stop to consider, though, that the story, whether the director intended it or not (and it's so obvious, he must have intended it), puts the main character in there as a Christ figure. She lets herself be abused and killed for the sake of love and to ""save"" another, her husband. Sound familiar?Bess's character reminds me of the Scriptural teachings on how believers must come to God as little children--trusting, open--and that what's in our heart matters to God. He sees the heart, not just the outward pieties.  Bess is a guiless woman and a gentle dimwit. She's ""stupid"", she says and others accept. But in her foolishness, she nevertheless has ongoing dialogues with the Creator, who let her be born thusly. When she does evil things (the promiscuous sex), she does them out of a childlike impulse of faith and a good motive (healing). (The opposite of the Pharisees, btw, who were told off by Christ for doing their good acts out of selfish and prideful motives and with hard hearts, trusting in their own holy actions, rather than standing humbly before a gracious and merciful God who sanctifies those who trust wholly in Him.)There is a moving and well-done scene during an inquest. They're trying to decide on Bess' state of mind to understand her actions. What the doctor originally wrote about her had to do with ""psychotic"" and ""neurotic"" and a compulsion to perverse sexual acts. The doctor says he would rewrite his opinion, and he would say about her that she was... ""good."" This stuns the judges. ""Good?"" And it's an awkward moment for everyone there, even the doctor who is struggling to understand exactly the nature of Bess and her actions. It's a fascinating moment of insight. Earlier in the film, Bess herself mentions Mary Magdalene, who though a prostitute by traditional accounts, went on to become, as Bess says, ""beloved"" of God.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!It's no surprise, then, that as Christ had to die, brutally, abused at the hands of those who couldn't perceive his goodness and mission, Bess, the suffering-servant-savior type here, dies as well, misunderstood by the community, labeled a ""sinner"" and damned by the elders of her very strict Scottish sect. Interestingly, her grave is empty.(Hear the gospel echoes?)Her husband, with the aid of his colleagues, steals her body to bury it at sea.Bess's death has not been useless. It has powerful effects: illumination in the doctor who loved her and the friend who tried to guide her, and divine healing to her dying husband.

422442,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,6304442459,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","There may be spoilers.This is another controversial film by Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier who also co-wrote the screenplay.  It was the first film of Von Trier's that received some attention in the U. S.  It won the Grand Prize of the Jury at Cannes and was the film debut of Emily Watson who also garnered an Oscar nomination.In the film Watson plays Bess, a ""simple"" woman living in Scotland with her parents and a member of a strict Christian church.  The term ""simple"" is used by von Trier in the movie and by his own account suggesting Bess can function well day to day, but when life gets complicated, she struggles to understand and can become emotionally distraught, sometimes on the verge of a breakdown.  This is a key element in the film.Bess, a virgin, marries the rugged Jan (Stellan Skarsgard), who works on an oil rig off the coast.  The film is set in the 1970's and is sectioned off by chapters, named by von Trier and begun with some cool pop songs of the day, by artists like Elton John, Rod Stewart and Leonard Cohen.  There is no score or soundtrack beyond those chapter starters.  We see Bess's frailty early on as Jan must depart by helicopter out to the rig for an extended period of time.  His near collapse is bolstered by her dead brother's widow, Dodo (Katrin Cartlidge).  They are best friends and Dodo has pledged to take care of the young Bess.Bess is not only scarily in love with Jan, and he with her for that matter, but also talks to God.  Literally.  Bess's voice becomes deep and stern in tone when God asks or answers a question.  She has several of these conversations with God which increase after Jan is severely injured on the oil platform and is paralyzed.  Jan, believing he will die and heavily medicated most of the time, suggests that Bess have sex with other men and provide him with the details.  Her conversations with God suggests that He doesn't object.  The inexperienced Bess reluctantly goes along with the suggestion but her inexperience and awkwardness is difficult to watch.  Watson is a marvel in this role, uncomfortable as it at times to watch.  Lars von Trier's films are always complicated, a bit muddled and full of innuendo and metaphors.  This is no exception.  The church the family belongs to is male dominated, exclusionary and full of ancient doctrinaire.  While they bury patrons, those that sin in their eyes, are condemned to Hell.  As Bess continues her wayward ways, believing she can cure Jan, it causes problems for the standing in the church and with her family.This isn't an easy film to watch at times and will likely leave many viewers frustrated if not angry.  And certainly the ending will have many shaking their head.  But for me it fits the story.  The film isn't perfect.  It is long at 2  hours and uses hand held cameras most of the time.  But there is no denying its impact.",4,Powerful romantic drama,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,2866,"['may', 'be', 'spoilers.This', 'controversial', 'film', 'Danish', 'filmmaker', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'Von', 'Trier', 'received', 'attention', 'U.', 'S.', 'won', 'Grand', 'Prize', 'Jury', 'Cannes', 'was', 'film', 'debut', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'who', 'also', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'nomination.In', 'film', 'Watson', 'Bess', 'simple', 'woman', 'living', 'Scotland', 'parents', 'member', 'strict', 'Christian', 'church', 'term', 'simple', 'used', 'von', 'Trier', 'movie', 'own', 'account', 'suggesting', 'Bess', 'can', 'function', 'well', 'day', 'day', 'when', 'life', 'complicated', 'understand', 'can', 'become', 'emotionally', 'distraught', 'sometimes', 'verge', 'breakdown', 'key', 'element', 'film.Bess', 'virgin', 'rugged', 'Jan', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'who', 'oil', 'rig', 'coast', 'film', 'set', '1970', 'sectioned', 'off', 'chapters', 'named', 'von', 'Trier', 'begun', 'cool', 'pop', 'songs', 'day', 'artists', 'Elton', 'John', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'score', 'soundtrack', 'chapter', 'starters', 'see', 'Bess', 'frailty', 'early', 'Jan', 'must', 'depart', 'helicopter', 'rig', 'extended', 'period', 'time', 'collapse', 'bolstered', 'dead', 'brother', 'widow', 'Dodo', 'Katrin', 'Cartlidge', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'Dodo', 'pledged', 'take', 'care', 'young', 'Bess.Bess', 'not', 'only', 'scarily', 'love', 'Jan', 'matter', 'also', 'talks', 'God', 'Literally', 'Bess', 'voice', 'deep', 'stern', 'tone', 'when', 'God', 'question', 'several', 'conversations', 'God', 'increase', 'Jan', 'severely', 'injured', 'oil', 'platform', 'paralyzed', 'Jan', 'believing', 'will', 'die', 'heavily', 'medicated', 'most', 'time', 'Bess', 'have', 'sex', 'other', 'men', 'provide', 'details', 'conversations', 'God', ""n't"", 'object', 'inexperienced', 'Bess', 'reluctantly', 'suggestion', 'inexperience', 'awkwardness', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Watson', 'marvel', 'role', 'uncomfortable', 'times', 'watch', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'complicated', 'bit', 'muddled', 'full', 'innuendo', 'metaphors', 'exception', 'church', 'family', 'male', 'dominated', 'exclusionary', 'full', 'ancient', 'doctrinaire', 'bury', 'patrons', 'sin', 'eyes', 'are', 'condemned', 'Hell', 'Bess', 'wayward', 'ways', 'believing', 'can', 'cure', 'Jan', 'problems', 'standing', 'church', 'family.This', ""n't"", 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'times', 'will', 'likely', 'leave', 'many', 'viewers', 'frustrated', 'not', 'angry', 'certainly', 'ending', 'will', 'have', 'many', 'shaking', 'head', 'story', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'long', '2', 'hours', 'uses', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'most', 'time', 'denying', 'impact']",N/A

Bess(Emily Watson), a seemingly retarded and meek girl is in a state of euphoria becuase she, against all expectations, is getting married. The groom is an oil-rig  worker Jan (Stellan Skarsgard), and as an outsider, the locals look on him  with great suspicion. But Bess is so in love with Jan that she can't wait  to get home to consumate their marriage, at the wedding she pulls him into  the lady's room where they have sex. Their relationship is deeply  passionatte, but tragedy strikes when Jan is injured and paralysed from the  neck down. He then asks his loving wife to perform sexual acts with  strangers and tell him about it.It is not clearly explained why he  asks her to do this, but my guess is, that deep down he really believes  that her sacrifice could actually save him. That God really could trade her  standing in this closed community for his life.I once watched two  fifty year old men sit down and debate weather it was allright from a  Religious stand point to blow air on soup inorder to cool it down. Was it  allright? Or will this lack of patience offend God? The elders of Bess's  community are similar, they &quot;love the word and love the law&quot;,  they consider their Bible to be a manual for living effectivly reducing the  Faith to physical action. &quot;How can you love a word&quot; Bess asks  them.The film is anchored by an incredible performance by Emily  Watson as Bess. Yes, she is mentally challenged but not without a sense of  humour or a certain insight. &quot;I was always stupid, but I have one  talent, my talent is faith&quot; she says. And the way director Lars Von  Trier shoots the film gives it a faux documentary feeling. His style  breaksdown the barriers of film, making the characters that much closer to  the audience. He is adhering to the Dogme 95 manifesto he drafted with a  few others Danish film-makers which allows him only handheld cameras and  available light, but he is a liar when he claims that cost is the reason  for this. His upclose style is emotionally exhausting and grimly beautiful.  His willingness to show explicit nudity only adds to the realism of the  film, no strategically placed objects here.It is strange when you  consider what &quot;religious&quot; people do around the world, they claim  to understand God. Perhaps life's strangest irony that a good number of  &quot;the men of God&quot; do the Devil's work.

422447,A2J9FM9PZNDPNP,6304442459,"""nicktuba""","[7, 18]","This review is somewhat biased, because I generally prefer films that move faster and take less time to establish the characters than this one (call me brainwashed by modern Hollywood cinema, but this is how I feel).I appreciate Lars von Trier's effort to establish Bess (Emily Watson) and Jan (Stellan Skarsgaard) as unique characters, but the film ultimately fails because of its slow pace. Unlike other films that have desperate characters (the mindless ""Rules of Attraction"" comes to mind), I feel what Bess does is justified, given her husband's inexplicable request and the extremely conservative nature of her church. These characters (and the performances) breed empathy and compassion; von Trier's skill and the actors' talent are much evident. However, I honestly could not sit through the entire film without hitting my DVD player's Fast Forward button several times, and finally stopping the movie early because I could take the sluggish pace no longer. Forty percent of the movie could be cut, and the story would suffer none.My other gripe about this film is the pointless and unnerving ""chapter"" stops which occur every fifteen minutes throughout the movie. While the film itself plays with mostly no background music, the eight or so chapter marks last way too long. Furthermore, loud rock music plays during these segments, which breaks the mood of the film, making the otherwise quiet film very noisy. These chapter segments inappropriately disrupt the flow of the film, and had me scrambling for my remote control several times to turn down the volume.If the film could be re-edited without the protracted and inappropriate ""chapter"" segments (or even if the disturbing, loud rock music could be removed), then it might be tolerable.",2,"Extremely slow-moving; distracting ""chapter"" stops",1039910400,"12 15, 2002",2002,1752,"['review', 'somewhat', 'biased', 'generally', 'prefer', 'films', 'move', 'faster', 'take', 'less', 'time', 'establish', 'characters', 'one', 'call', 'brainwashed', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'cinema', 'how', 'feel', '.I', 'appreciate', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'effort', 'establish', 'Bess', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Jan', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgaard', 'unique', 'characters', 'film', 'ultimately', 'slow', 'pace', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'desperate', 'characters', 'mindless', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'mind', 'feel', 'what', 'Bess', 'justified', 'given', 'husband', 'inexplicable', 'request', 'extremely', 'conservative', 'nature', 'church', 'characters', 'performances', 'breed', 'empathy', 'compassion', 'Trier', 'skill', 'actors', 'talent', 'are', 'much', 'evident', 'However', 'honestly', 'could', 'not', 'sit', 'entire', 'film', 'hitting', 'DVD', 'player', 'Fast', 'Forward', 'button', 'several', 'times', 'finally', 'stopping', 'movie', 'early', 'could', 'take', 'sluggish', 'pace', 'no', 'longer', 'Forty', 'percent', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'cut', 'story', 'would', 'suffer', 'other', 'gripe', 'film', 'pointless', 'unnerving', 'chapter', 'stops', 'occur', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'film', 'mostly', 'background', 'music', 'eight', 'so', 'chapter', 'marks', 'last', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'Furthermore', 'loud', 'rock', 'music', 'segments', 'mood', 'film', 'making', 'otherwise', 'quiet', 'film', 'very', 'noisy', 'chapter', 'segments', 'inappropriately', 'disrupt', 'flow', 'film', 'had', 'scrambling', 'remote', 'control', 'several', 'times', 'turn', 'down', 'volume.If', 'film', 'could', 'be', 're-edited', 'protracted', 'inappropriate', 'chapter', 'segments', 'even', 'disturbing', 'loud', 'rock', 'music', 'could', 'be', 'removed', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'tolerable']",N/A

Mainstream movie viewers would do well to avoid like the plague. It has all the hallmarks of a bad production - terrible shaky camerawork, bad lighting, non-linear plot line, disjointed editing and low-budget all to the tune of a 70s soundtrack. The fact is that this is the film that birthed a new type of independent movie that uses film making standards ""now known as Dogme with some revised areas"" to approach film making from a new perspective. ""Breaking the Waves"" is not Dogme but did get that whole concept up and running. There is an overall air that the film makers are there on the scene, making a sort of documentary which can be distracting for many but this is what the films sets out to achieve. It almost resembles a Reality TV type of show.Basically the film is set in the 1970s in the northwest coast of Scotland. Bess, (Emily Watson) is a shy quite girl with frustrating sexual and psychological problems who marries Jan (Stellan Skarsgard) an oilrig worker which is not entirely appreciated by her family and friends. He leaves to go back to the offshore rig and she is left alone to spend the days without him. Basically there in an accident which leaves Bess seeking out other men which she has sexual relationships with to help her come to terms with the accident. There is a real shock ending twist and the film does surprise.All in all this is advanced art filmmaking with a great performances. Just remember that there are a lot of new film making concepts involved in this film and it does have a massive running time of 2hrs and 30mins. The film is also strong in sex, language and can be quite violent at times. Only for brave movie lovers who really want to see a great film that challenges the movie system with hyper-realism.

422452,A1QWG77KXFU4GI,6304442459,Perrin Frch,"[7, 9]","Breaking The Waves is quite possibly one of the best, and most powerful film of the 90's. It is considered one of the films in the Dogme movement started by Danish filmmakers including this film's director, Lars Von Trier. The Dogme movement was started in 1995, and is a set of rules, that director's can follow which allows the filmmaking to be at it's purest for cheapest, with no special effect and no big budget, this allows the filmmakers to focus more on the story and the actor's involvement with their characters. Although this is not a proper Dogme film, it does follow some of the other rules Lars Von Trier vowed to keep. This is Emily Watson's first feature film and definately is one of her finest roles to date. She achieved an acadamy award nomination for best actress as the leading character Bess, and the film also won the grand jury award at the Cannes Film Festival, along with best film of the year at the european film awards. The film was written by Lars Von Trier, Peter Asmussen, and the uncredited David Pirie.Breaking The Waves is set in the early 1970's and is about a faithful young woman named bess, who lives in a small town in Scotland. Bess is a very faithful person towards her religon and has a previous mention of being at a psychiatric hospital. At the beginning of the film, Bess is confronting the townsmen who are incharge of the church she attends and is asking their permission to marry an oil rig worker named Jan, who is played by Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgrd. After Bess and Jan get married, Jan has to go back, and Bess' world ends once he leaves to go back and work at the oil rig. Bess' caretaker and sister in law Dodo, encourages her to live a normal life while he's away, and that she shouldn't just stop living. Jan phones his wife every day and doesn't neglect her. Bess prays for her husband to come home, although he would be returning to her in ten days, she can't wait that long, and prays for him to come home immediatly. Jan has a fatal accident at the rig and forces him to come home to attend the hospital. Bess soon finds out from the doctor who's a good friend of her's that he's parralized for life. She soon starts to feel guilty that her beloved is parralized because of her, that she prayed for her husband to return quickly, and thinks that she caused the accident to happen. Jan realises that he can't ever touch or make love to his wife again, and encourages her to find a lover and tell him every detail so that he can never forget what it feels like. Both of them are deeply in love, and Jan pleads her to help him never forget, so that he, as he claims, may still live. Bess beleives that this whole fiasco is a test of her love for him.The key highlight of the picture is Emily Watson's truly amazing performance, and is one of the main reasons you should watch this film. But, there is not one poor performance in this film by any actor.  Skarsgrd is absolutely sensational as the crippled Jan, and gives a very detailed and heart breaking performance alongside Emily Watson. Other brilliant performances come from Katrin Cartlidge as the nurse Dodo and sister in-law to Bess, and as well as Adrian Rawlins as the caring Docter Richardson. Von Trier is known to be hard on his cast, but is rewarded with truly heartfelt performances from the cast and excellent direction. The cinematography is what you expect from any Dogme film(one of the rules is to only use handheld cameras), the handheld camera gives us the personal and intimate moments of the characters, it's not only stylish and unique, but it also gives us a feeling that we are one of the characters in the film, that we are a spectator of the events that are taking place, and that we are in their heads, that we are experiencing what they are feeling at that precise moment. The film features an exilarating 1970's rock soundtrack, that has mostly glam rock, the music is only played at the introduction of each new chapter, and only once, during actual footage, T-Rex's rollicking Hot Love. The script is very well thought out, and very meaningful dialogue with heart pounding story.Overall, Breaking The Waves is a definate knock-out, and rightly deserves the praise it got from critics and cinema goers. But, it isn't for the average movie watcher and would only appeal to avid Von Trier fans and art house viewers. The film should most definately not be missed by anybody who is looking for a tale filled with love and faith. The end result is one of the most powerful films of all time and one of the most depressing films ever. The ending is an absolute tragic event and gets all of the character's emotions thrown at us with devestating results. This and Requiem For A Dream are possibly the most powerful films and saddest films I've ever seen. This is a very tough second viewing, and won't reccomend to the sensetive viewer. The film contains explicit sex, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. But, for everybody else, a film to see on a cold rainy day, infact, any time of the day will do.There are absolutely no special features on the region 1 disc, I own the region 2 disc, it hardly has anything extra, but specialy selected chapters with comentary from Lars Von Trier and other crew involved. The film: 4.5/5 The extras: 2.5/5(R2), 0/5(R1)",5,Most Powerful Film On Von Trier's CV.,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,5307,"['Breaking', 'Waves', 'quite', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'powerful',

There is truly a connection between these two films. The heroine is very naive and simple, but sweet and powerfully convicted and emotional about her goal in life. Both are faced with making a profound sacrifice for someone they love. But unlike Dancer in the Dark which decidedly dark, this film is more optimistic and magical almost to a Spielbergian degree. You have to ride through the entire film to understand. But it all ties together in a lovely way.I quite loved this film and considering that it is filled with mental illness, sex, perversions, and disfunctional religious relationships it ends up being very endearing and sentimental in a way not quite unlike a Capra film like It's a Wonderful Life.So if you tend to dislike arthouse films this might be one you would like.

I have certainly noticed that about 7/8 outof 10 reviews I've seen are quite positive. Movies are very powerfuland evocative, and what rankles me no end is that crass movies likethis play on cheap emotions and sympathies about how we are allvictims, how life is so unfair, and thus we must feel compassion forthe less fortunate who martyr themselves for (among other things) ""love,""no matter how outrageous their actions are.There was a movie that came out some years ago about a millionairewho offers a desperate couple a million dollars if he can have an affairwith the wife. The promoters of the movie were able to create a smallstir, really a bunch of gossip - should they or shouldn't they acceptthe offer? Fortunately I never saw the movie because the idea struck meas nonsense, the bait of money that ""everyone"" supposedly wants, etc.And just like the other movie mentioned above, I see that ""Breaking theWaves"" has also caused a stir among professional and non-professionalreviewers. Is the love of the lead character, Bess, so pure that shebecomes a Mary Magdalene-like prostitute to satisfy the ""inner needs"" ofher paralyzed husband, and thus, as she believes, keeps him alive? Or isshe so innocent because she is somewhat feeble-minded, and thus the""victim"" of the hypocritical church elders (incl. her grandfather), whopredictably excommunicate her, which results in her being cast out byher own family, and hastens her demise.The handling of these issues in ""Breaking the Waves"" is trite,unbelievable, and as I wrote above, the movie very disingenuously and withamazingly exaggerated self-importance plays on human sympathies aboutso-called ""love."" One of the biggest problems with the movie that contributesto its negative effect is that almost the entire footage is done with close-ups.The constant close-ups are annoying on TV; on the big scene I can only imaginewhat the effect would have been! The constant close-ups force a reaction, sceneafter scene, for almost the entire 2 1/2 hours.The first hour of the movie, like many European movies, really drags fora viewer accustomed to American movies. While sometimes the slower pace createsa richness of plot and character development, here it only underscores the weakthemes and characterizations in the movie and foreshadows later events that areeasily predicted. The final travesty is the quick wrap-up at the end, whenBess supposedly ""martyrs"" herself (it is so contrived I was aghast when I sawthe scene) and then with no explanation at all her husband is suddenly healed,and then we are expected to believe that she goes to heaven and ""manifests""church bells above the oil rig where he works!A real tragedy of ""Breaking the Waves"" is that some very fine performancesare almost totally wasted. The actors who play Bess's sister-in-law and theyoung, concerned doctor are believable and touching, and show the kind ofpotential the movie might have realized had it not been so contrived, excessive,and poorly written for the lead character, who herself gives a performancethat is also excessive and self-indulgent.",2,Very much ado about nothing,1023580800,"06 9, 2002",2002,3163,"['movie', 'impressed', 'negative', 'way', 'feel', 'thatI', 'must', 'write', 'review', 'have', 'certainly', 'noticed', 'about', '7/8', 'outof', '10', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'quite', 'positive', 'Movies', 'are', 'very', 'powerfuland', 'evocative', 'what', 'end', 'crass', 'movies', 'likethis', 'play', 'cheap', 'emotions', 'sympathies', 'how', 'are', 'allvictims', 'how', 'life', 'so', 'unfair', 'thus', 'must', 'feel', 'compassion', 'forthe', 'less', 'fortunate', 'who', 'martyr', 'other', 'things', 'love', 'matter', 'how', 'outrageous', 'actions', 'are.There', 'was', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'years', 'ago', 'millionairewho', 'desperate', 'couple', 'million', 'dollars', 'can', 'have', 'affairwith', 'wife', 'promoters', 'movie', 'were', 'able', 'create', 'smallstir', 'really', 'bunch', 'gossip', 'should', 'should', ""n't"", 'acceptthe', 'offer', 'Fortunately', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'idea', 'struck', 'meas', 'nonsense', 'bait', 'money', 'everyone', 'supposedly', 'etc.And', 'just', 'other', 'movie', 'mentioned', 'see', 'Breaking', 'theWaves', 'also', 'caused', 'stir', 'professional', 'non-professionalreviewers', 'love', 'lead', 'character', 'Bess', 'so', 'pure', 'Mary', 'Magdalene-like', 'prostitute', 'satisfy', 'inner', 'needs', 'ofher', 'paralyzed', 'husband', 'thus', 'alive', 'isshe', 'so', 'innocent', 'somewhat', 'feeble-minded', 'thus', 'victim', 'hypocritical', 'church', 'elders', 'incl', 'grandfather', 'whopredictably', 'excommunicate', 'results', 'being', 'cast', 'out', 'byher', 'own', 'family', 'demise.The', 'handling', 'issues', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'trite', 'unbelievable', 'wrote', 'movie', 'very', 'disingenuously', 'withamazingly', 'exaggerated', 'self-importance', 'plays', 'human', 'sympathies', 'aboutso-called', 'love', 'One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'movie', 'negative', 'effect', 'almost', 'entire', 'footage', 'done', 'close-ups.The', 'constant', 'close-ups', 'are', 'annoying', 'TV', 'big', 'scene', 'can', 'only', 'imaginewhat', 'effect', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'constant', 'close-ups', 'force', 'reaction', 'sceneafter', 'scene', 'almost', 'entire', '2', '1/2', 'hours.The', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'many', 'European', 'movies', 'really', 'drags', 'fora', 'viewer', 'accustomed', 'American', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'slower', 'pace', 'createsa', 'richness', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'only', 'weakthemes', 'characterizations', 'movie', 'later', 'events', 'areeasily', 'predicted', 'final', 'travesty', 'quick', 'wrap-up', 'end', 'whenBess', 'supposedly', 'martyrs', 'so', 'contrived', 'was', 'aghast', 'when', 'sawthe', 'scene', 'then', 'explanation', 'husband', 'suddenly', 'healed', 'then', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'heaven', 'manifests', 'church', 'bells', 'oil', 'rig', 'where', 'real', 'tragedy', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'very', 'fine', 'performancesare', 'almost', 'totally', 'wasted', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Bess', 'sister-in-law', 'theyoung', 'concerned', 'doctor', 'are', 'believable', 'touching', 'show', 'kind', 'ofpotential', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'realized', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'contrived', 'excessive', 'poorly', 'written', 'lead', 'character', 'who', 'performancethat', 'also', 'excessive', 'self-indulgent']",N/A

Von Trier's blurb on the DVD has him suggesting that this was a simple love story, but it absolutely isn't. It may be set among a simple people, but the questions it raises will have you thinking for a while.FIRST HALF: MARVELLOUSIn a bleak Scottish village dominated by a rigid Christian sect with a profound distrust of outsiders, a childlike god-fearing young woman named Bess marries an oil-rig worker named Jan, a hearty, worldly sensualist. They hurl themselves into marriage with a reckless, carnal joy that is unnerving to behold.This first half of the movie contains some of the most passionate mosaic of love scenes I have seen in a while. Von Trier, together with cinematographer Mueller, creates an atmosphere of dizzying immediacy and evokes some vivid performances from the actors.SECOND HALF: MIXED BAGAfter all that wondrous love, the film suddenly takes a bizarre dip when the husband gets paralyzed and fears that he will never be able to make love to his wife again. So he asks her to find a lover and tell him the details about it, as a vicarious sexual existence. He tells her that this is the only way he can live, and without it, he will die. She refuses, but when his condition worsens, she ultimately succumbs.This bit I felt is where the film comes a tad undone. While it is VERY moving to watch, I began to question the leaps of faith we are supposed to take, as this strange mix of religion and sexuality smacks either of being too simplistic or too far-fetched. The husband's notions of depraved sexuality as salvation come across as illogical and ineffective.BUT, SO WHAT, IT'S A MUST-WATCH GEM:Despite my gripes, this is a fascinating film to watch (and own!) I have seen very few movies that take such huge risks, it is absolutely high-wire filmmaking, without a net of irony.

When he has to return to the oil rig where he works, she is devastated and prays to God for him to come home. And so he does, on a stretcher, after a serious accident at work has paralysed him. Now it is guilt that devastates Bess. Jan meanwhile begins to have some, ultimately well-intentioned, thoughts that she should free herself up from him, taking a lover perhaps, as he has little prospect of ever making love to her again. She won't hear of it. So now he urges her to do this not for herself but for him. And indeed, his own mental balance shaken by his physical condition, he places the thought in her head that by having sex with other men she can somehow help him to recovery. The deadly seriousness with which she takes this makes her an outcast in her small Highland community and leads to her ultimate destruction.This film is set in the Scottish Highlands. Film lovers the world over, hearing that, may immediately think of the rather fey, whisky-soaked and carefree landscape of ""I Know Where I'm Going"", ""Whisky Galore"", ""Local Hero"", etc. If you do, now is the time to forget these cosy images. The Highlands here are a cold, difficult place where small inward-looking communities are dominated by the ministers of a cold and unforgiving Presbyterian faith and where, out in the harbour, in the ""big boat"" there lurks a lawless and dangerous world of psychopathic sexual sadism. It's a bleak picture indeed though I doubt that von Trier intends it to be a particularly realistic picture of a Highland community. The brutality and ugliness of Bess's environment is simply intended to represent the brutality and ugliness of the world quite generally and indeed von Trier may intend a certain irony in providing his story with a setting so often viewed as a place of escape from such things. (Despite this setting, von Trier's first English language film remains also unmistakably Danish and reviewers who profess to see here the strong influences both of Soren Kierkegaard and of Carl Dreyer are surely dead right.)Two things destroy Bess. One is her love for her husband twisted into madness by her grief and mental weakness. The other is the unforgiving cruelty of her community who, at a moment in her life when she most needs their compassion and understanding, turn their back on her with freezing contempt in spite of their ostensible adherence to a religion of love and forgiveness. In horrible scenes late in the film, Bess's mother shuts her out of her house; she is chased, jeered at and stoned in the street by the local schoolchildren; the local minister (a great chilling performance by Jonathan Hackett) finds her unconscious at the church door and simply walks away. This lost and hopelessly corrupted world fails, in von Trier's eyes, adequately to see that the love and goodness embodied in Bess, for all her innocence and self-destructive foolishness, offers it its sole hope of redemption. Unmistakably this is a profoundly religious film, the work of a director who recently before converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism. But it is a religious movie that is certain  to - and I have no doubt is purposefully designed to - shock and distress most religious viewers.Indeed, in a whole bunch of ways, it will shock and distress just about anybody. The events of the second half of the movie are profoundly harrowing, disturbing and painful to watch. (Not least because Emily Watson turns in a performance so brilliant that it is very easy to forget we are only watching someone acting.) And it is hard viewing. Though not officially a Dogme95 film, it goes a good distance in respecting that school's self-denying ordinances in favour of location shooting, hand-held camera work, lack of incidental music (except here for the occasional ""chapter"" headings accompanied by 70s style rock music), etc. But none of this prevents it from being an extraordinarily compelling, altogether unique movie, one that nobody who cares about good cinema should even think about missing out on.",5,A Shocking and Unforgettable Parable of Love and Sacrifice,1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,4115,"['Child-like', 'devout', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'head', 'Bess', 'married', 'Jan', 'immensely', 'happy', 'When', 'return', 'oil', 'rig', 'where', 'devastated', 'prays', 'God', 'come', 'home', 'so', 'stretcher', 'serious', 'accident', 'work', 'paralysed', 'Now', 'guilt', 'Bess', 'Jan', 'meanwhile', 'have', 'ultimately', 'well-intentioned', 'thoughts', 'should', 'free', 'up', 'taking', 'lover', 'perhaps', 'little', 'prospect', 'ever', 'making', 'love', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'So', 'now', 'do', 'not', 'herself', 'indeed', 'own', 'mental', 'balance', 'shaken', 'physical', 'condition', 'thought', 'head', 'having', 'sex', 'other', 'men', 'can', 'somehow', 'help', 'recovery', 'deadly', 'seriousness', 'outcast', 'small', 'Highland', 'community', 'ultimate', 'destruction.This', 'film', 'set', 'Scottish', 'Highlands', 'Film', 'world', 'hearing', 'may', 'immediately', 'think', 'rather', 'fey', 'whisky-soaked', 'carefree', 'landscape', 'Know', 'Where', ""'m"", 'Going', 'Whisky', 'Galore', 'Local', 'Hero', 'etc', 'do', 'now', 'time', 'forget', 'cosy', 'images', 'Highlands', 'here', 'are', 'cold', 'difficult', 'place', 'where', 'small', 'inward-looking', 'communities', 'are', 'dominated', 'ministers', 'cold', 'unforgiving', 'Presbyterian', 'faith', 'where', 'harbour', 'big', 'boat', 'lawless', 'dangerous', 'world', 'psychopathic', 'sexual', 'sadism', 'bleak', 'picture', 'indeed', 'doubt', 'von', 'Trier', 'be', 'particularly', 'realistic', 'picture', 'Highland', 'community', 'brutality', 'ugliness', 'Bess', 'environment', 'simply', 'intended', 'represent', 'brutality', 'ugliness', 'world', 'quite', 'generally', 'indeed', 'von', 'Trier', 'may', 'intend', 'certain', 'irony', 'providing', 'story', 'setting', 'so', 'often', 'viewed', 'place', 'escape', 'such', 'things', 'setting', 'von', 'Trier', 'first', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'also', 'unmistakably', 'Danish', 'reviewers', 'who', 'profess', 'see', 'here', 'strong', 'influences', 'Soren', 'Kierkegaard', 'Carl', 'Dreyer', 'are', 'surely', 'dead', 'right', 'Two', 'things', 'destroy', 'Bess', 'One', 'love', 'husband', 'twisted', 'madness', 'grief', 'mental', 'weakness', 'other', 'unforgiving', 'cruelty', 'community', 'who', 'moment', 'life', 'when', 'most', 'needs', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'turn', 'back', 'freezing', 'contempt', 'spite', 'ostensible', 'adherence', 'religion', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'horrible', 'scenes', 'late', 'film', 'Bess', 'mother', 'out', 'house', 'chased', 'jeered', 'stoned', 'street', 'local', 'schoolchildren', 'local', 'minister', 'great', 'chilling', 'performance', 'Jonathan', 'Hackett', 'unconscious', 'church', 'door', 'simply', 'walks', 'away', 'lost', 'hopelessly', 'corrupted', 'world', 'von', 'Trier', 'eyes', 'adequately', 'see', 'love', 'goodness', 'embodied', 'Bess', 'innocence', 'self-destructive', 'foolishness', 'sole', 'hope', 'redemption', 'Unmistakably', 'profoundly', 'religious', 'film', 'work', 'director', 'who', 'recently', 'before', 'converted', 'Judaism', 'Roman', 'Catholicism', 'religious', 'movie', 'certain', 'have', 'doubt', 'purposefully', 'designed', 'shock', 'distress', 'most', 'religious', 'viewers.Indeed', 'whole', 'bunch', 'ways', 'will', 'shock', 'distress', 'just', 'anybody', 'events', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'are', 'profoundly', 'harrowing', 'disturbing', 'painful', 'watch', 'Not', 'least', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'performance', 'so', 'brilliant', 'very', 'easy', 'forget', 'are', 'only', 'watching', 'someone', 'acting', 'hard', 'viewing', 'not', 'officially', 'Dogme95', 'film', 'good', 'distance', 'respecting', 'school', 'self-denying', 'ordinances', 'favour', 'location', 'shooting', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'lack', 'incidental', 'music', 'here', 'occasional', 'chapter', 'headings', 'accompanied', '70s', 'style', 'rock', 'music', 'etc', 'none', 'prevents', 'being', 'extraordinarily', 'compelling', 'altogether', 'unique', 'movie', 'one', 'nobody', 'who', 'about', 'good', 'cinema', 'should', 'even', 'think', 'missing', 'out']",N/A

If you attribute her strikingly self-destructive personal faith to the unfortunate combination of mental imbalance, a brutal Calvinist upbringing, and a life of limited scope, then you're likely to feel enough sympathy for her to turn this story into a heartbreaking masterpiece on the redemptive power of love.  But if, on the other hand, you attribute her behaviour to an irritatingly irrational religious enthusiasm bordering on willful stupidity, then you're likely to find her cloying naivet&eacute; - and the rest of this film - almost entirely unwatchable.  On the first viewing, I was in the second camp and within forty minutes I was throwing the remote at the screen.  Coming back to it a day later, and paying more attention, I found Bess far more sympathetic and began to appreciate this film for its craft as much as for its themes.  Lars von Trier's ""dogmatic"" approach doesn't always play, but here it pays off in spades: hand-held cameras and available light add realism to a story and characters which might otherwise seem woefully contrived.  Moreover, the documentary style contrasts wonderfully with the evocative beauty and music of the ""chapter title"" inserts and the glorious, climactic epiphany.

Breaking the waves is about Bess a young simple minded Scottish woman  who cleans the local church.  While cleaning them she regularly has conversations with God. Bess meets and falls in love with Jan and outsider who works on an oil rig. Soon Bess and Jan marry to the begrudging wishes of Bess family and the opressive church elders. Then of course complications occur. Jan is called back to sea and is crippled in a rig accident. Bess whose love is unwavering stands by her man despite the fact he may never walk again. While in the hospital Jan asks Bess for a favor to keep hip alive. I would say more but I've said enough abou the plot which is only window dressing for the amazing performances in this film. First and foremost is Emily Wastson  whose performance as Bess is one of the best by an actress or actor I have ever seen. Her face is like a blank page which immediately and convincingly contorts to what ever emnotion she is feeling. Even the conversatiuons with God which in the hands of a lesser actor would look foolish comes across believable. Stellan Skarsgard who plays Jan is mainly a supporting character but he is also extremely good as the enigmatic husband of Bess. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent. Trier's direction is  breathtaking. By using motsly handheld cameras and natural lighting he's made a film that gives the film a documentary feel to it.

I came to it with positive expectations, having enjoyed Zentropa so thoroughly.Helena Bonham Carter, I understand, turned down the central role ultimately played by Emily Watson, saying that it wasn't a character, it was a mental case.  And so it is.  I know of no other film that shows such contempt of all of its characters; that degrades its central character so thoroughly; and is so persistently ugly to watch.  ""Intellectual pornography"" fails even to begin to cover this film--a film full of sex with no enjoyment.  And the conclusion, which is quite literally an exercise of self-contradiction, only adds to a sense of disgust.It is a wonder to me that von Triers was capable of making a film as mesmerizing as Zentropa and then reversing himself into a career that has produced a series of ugly, degrading, pretentious films with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever.  It is a greater wonder that he is not condemned widely as a false and pretentious provocateur with neither style nor substance.  It further shocks me that anyone with any taste or moral sense could defend this film.This is not a film so much as a moral and aesthetic crime.If I could rate it lower than one star--I would.",1,A film without any redeeming characteristics,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,1390,"['saw', 'film', 'first', 'US', 'showing', 'Telluride', 'film', 'festival', 'not', 'exaggeration', 'say', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'provoked', 'such', 'strong', 'reaction', 'came', 'positive', 'expectations', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'Zentropa', 'so', 'thoroughly.Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'understand', 'turned', 'down', 'central', 'role', 'ultimately', 'played', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'saying', 'was', ""n't"", 'character', 'was', 'mental', 'case', 'know', 'other', 'film', 'such', 'contempt', 'characters', 'central', 'character', 'thoroughly', 'so', 'persistently', 'ugly', 'watch', 'Intellectual', 'pornography', 'fails', 'even', 'begin', 'cover', 'film', 'film', 'full', 'sex', 'enjoyment', 'conclusion', 'quite', 'literally', 'exercise', 'self-contradiction', 'only', 'sense', 'disgust.It', 'wonder', 'von', 'Triers', 'was', 'capable', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'mesmerizing', 'Zentropa', 'then', 'reversing', 'career', 'produced', 'series', 'ugly', 'degrading', 'pretentious', 'films', 'redeeming', 'characteristics', 'whatsoever', 'greater', 'wonder', 'not', 'condemned', 'widely', 'false', 'pretentious', 'provocateur', 'style', 'substance', 'further', 'shocks', 'anyone', 'taste', 'moral', 'sense', 'could', 'defend', 'film.This', 'not', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'moral', 'aesthetic', 'crime.If', 'could', 'rate', 'lower', 'one', 'star', 'would']",N/A

I put off seeing this film for one reason or another for a while and when I finally saw it I was I was surprised at how it affected me.  Breaking the Waves is alive in a way that few films are.  It is a film that asks difficult questions about faith and love and compassion and doesn't have easy answers for those questions.The central question or conflict in the film comes when Bess's new husband Jan is injured while working on an oil rig.  Bess is told that he will never walk again.  While in the hospital Jan asks Bess to find a man to make love to and to come back and tell him about it.  It is hinted at that his mind may be affected by all the medication he is on.  Bess loves her husband so much that she does this for him, believing that the power of love through this gesture might make Jan better.  When she does this Jan's condition improves.  Bess believes that her sacrafice causes this.  Bess is soon banned from the church and from her town.The question is:  Did her sacrafice really help her husband, who was not expected to even live at one point, survive?  The movie doesn't tell us, it lets us come to our own conclusions from our own life experiences.  The movie takes us on this emotional journey and doesn't make it easy or pleasant.  It certainly doesn't play down to its audience.  Breaking the Waves is powerful, emotional, spiritual, totally unconventional and a deeply satisfying experience.",5,Gets under your skin,1012089600,"01 27, 2002",2002,1543,"['sometimes', 'respond', 'more', 'things', 'go', 'grain', 'take', 'conventions', 'throw', 'right', 'out', 'window', 'put', 'off', 'seeing', 'film', 'one', 'reason', 'while', 'when', 'finally', 'saw', 'was', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'affected', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'alive', 'way', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'film', 'difficult', 'questions', 'faith', 'love', 'compassion', ""n't"", 'have', 'easy', 'answers', 'questions.The', 'central', 'question', 'conflict', 'film', 'when', 'Bess', 'new', 'husband', 'Jan', 'injured', 'working', 'oil', 'rig', 'Bess', 'told', 'will', 'never', 'walk', 'again', 'hospital', 'Jan', 'Bess', 'find', 'man', 'make', 'love', 'come', 'back', 'tell', 'hinted', 'mind', 'may', 'be', 'affected', 'medication', 'Bess', 'husband', 'so', 'much', 'believing', 'power', 'love', 'gesture', 'might', 'make', 'Jan', 'better', 'When', 'Jan', 'condition', 'Bess', 'sacrafice', 'Bess', 'soon', 'banned', 'church', 'town.The', 'question', 'Did', 'sacrafice', 'really', 'help', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'expected', 'even', 'live', 'one', 'point', 'survive', 'movie', ""n't"", 'tell', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'own', 'life', 'experiences', 'movie', 'emotional', 'journey', ""n't"", 'make', 'easy', 'pleasant', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'play', 'down', 'audience', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'totally', 'unconventional', 'deeply', 'satisfying', 'experience']",N/A

Lars Von Trier has made  quite a shocking movie hightlighted by Emily Watson's fierce performance  that ranks among the best ever recorded on the screen.  She reminds me so  much of Falconetti in her monumental performance in 'Passion of Joan of  Arc'. I enjoyed Frances McDormand in 'Fargo' a lot.  However, to say that  performance is better than Watson's in this movie is a big shocking joke.  It's like saying that Steve Kerr is a better basketball player than Michael  Jordan.
