1020475,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B000IHY9UC,,"[4, 4]","Going into using this DVD, I was familiar with Denise Austin's personality, voice, etc.  So I am not going to add or subtract stars from my rating based on that -- I knew what I was getting.  For people who might not be familiar with her, I will discuss it a bit.  Her style is very off-putting to some people.  Her voice is raspy and she talks nonstop.  However, I do believe she knows a lot about fitness, and she demonstrates knowledge of anatomical terms.One aspect of this DVD does deserve mention, though, before I move on to talk about the individual segments: there's almost no discussion of proper form for any of the moves.  Early on in the cardio segment, Denise, herself, has rather bad form for push-ups and plank.  Some sections (I'm thinking about the lunges from the strength portion) are also a bit too fast to maintain proper form throughout.  If you're intermediate or advanced, when it comes to exercise, this might not be a big deal.  There aren't a lot of new moves here, so if you've done squats in another DVD or video, you've probably heard not to let your knees get out too far (i.e., over your toes).  But if you're a beginner, you could have problems with form and/or pacing.The DVD is divided into three segments, a 20-minute cardio segment, a 20-minute strength segment, and a 10-minute flexibility segment.Cardio: The warm-up here is decent and covers all the major muscle groups, though it takes about 1/4 of the workout time.  This is supposed to be an interval-training workout, but the intervals are not significantly more difficult (in my opinion) than the other segments.  The actual interval work, after the warm-up, only goes on for about 11 minutes; this seems too short to me to be effective.  Then there's an abs section, and it's short but not bad.  It does cover all the major ab muscles, including upper, lower, and oblique.Strength: There's not much of a warm-up here (maybe two minutes).  I find there's a little too much reliance on squats in this section.  One thing I do like is that there are several different combination moves that simultaneously work the upper and lower body.  This section also includes an abs workout, but this has different exercises than the cardio section does.  Please note that in the description for this section (accessed from one of the menus), it says to use 3-5 lb weights.  This might work for beginners, but is simply not going to do it for more advanced exercisers.Flexibility: I actually really like this segment.  There's a little movement instead of just holding yourself static.  The main part covers ""active isolated stretches"" of different muscles.  This consists of short holds and releases of a stretch before holding it for a longer period of time.Other notes:*The music is highly annoying and sounds as if it's on some sort of endless loop.  The camera work was decent.*Denise has a tendency to say things like ""target tone the tummy.""  Everything I've read suggests that spot-toning specific areas is not possible.  Sure, you can build ab muscles by doing crunches.  But if you want to have a smaller stomach, you need to lose weight all over.  Denise may very well know the difference (in fact, it's likely she does), but she doesn't express it very clearly in this DVD.*The other participants are young and fit and, for the most part, seem happy to be there.  However, one of the men (the one on the back right with the fake tan) sometimes has a bit of trouble following along when the moves change.*There isn't a lot of cueing here.  It's needed less in this type of routine, where there aren't combinations (like there were in, say, a really old step video of Denise's that I have).  But it might benefit beginners to watch it first and get an idea of what's going on.  Sometimes I found myself half a step behind, and I consider myself advanced.*I don't find this much of a challenge, difficulty-wise.  It's medium-intensity when the whole thing is done in a single session.It seems clear to me that Denise intended this to be a single 50-minute workout, not two complete 20-minute workouts with a bonus flexibility segment.  (It seems to have been the trendy thing to do, back when this was produced, to call separate segments complete ""workouts"" when they really weren't.  I can say the same thing about other multi-""workout"" DVDs that I own from 6-7 years ago.)  The length of the warm-up in the first segment is great for a 50-minute DVD, as is the length of the stretch.  There's not a cool down worth noting in either of the 20-minute segments.  The cardio segment isn't intense enough to be a workout on its own (in my opinion), unless you're just starting out with exercise.  However, if you're a beginner, you might not know everything you need to about form, and as discussed above, you won't get an introduction to proper form in this DVD.In the end, I have really mixed feelings about this DVD.  I like some parts of it quite a bit and think others could use some work.  This would be best for people who are familiar with Denise and looking to challenge themselves a little more than in some of her other DVDs.",3,mixed feelings,1379894400,"09 23,

The impact is definitely much higher in this workout (which is rare), than in most of her other DVDs that are typically extremely non-challenging, but the whole routine feels thrown together, made up as you go. There are NEVER enough reps, sides are not worked evenly and if I hear, 'train like an athlete' or 'bootaful' one more time I have to throw up. I normally get pumped up with high-impact cardio, but this workout is extremely non-motivating even though I was sweating pretty good. She talks non-stop in a very annoying manner and the music is blah. I felt very unsatisfied afterwards and I'm so done trying her workouts.

1020477,A3HCZTTUH3CW9Z,B000IHY9UC,Amy Henley,"[3, 3]","I did the three workouts as one long workout (play all). I was thinking of writing this review as I exercised.  If I only did the first section, this review would have been much worse (only 2 stars).  I didn't like the Cardio Interval.  I mean it made me sweat, but I thought the cuing was horrible and the transitions between movements choppy.  She cued like okay now we we do the next exercise.  I was thinking, well I would do the next exercise if if it wasn't such a big secret!  Then, she would not do any counts and all of a sudden switch to the other side so I frequently did one less exercise on one side.  I think only because I have done so many differnt workouts that I was able to keep up with the transitions.  I'm worried about beginners pulling something, especially when she does the t-stand and plank segment.  Please be careful people!  The second and third sections Strength and Flexibility I thought were much better, and the only two I would do again.  I really felt that she worked my whole body in the Strength segment.  However, she didn't say how much weight to use.  I did 8 pounds because the segments are shorter than what I'm used to doing (20 minutes each for the Cardio Internval and Strength).  The Cardio Interval doesn't use weights.  I would recommend less weight for most people to start out.  The new twist to the 10 minute Flexibility section is instead of doing static stretches, you move through the stretches ""like athletes."" Again people be careful of your form.  There are no variations for beginning exercisers in any of the sections.  I got this DVD from the library so might do it again.  I would only recommend advanced beginners or intermediate exercisers like myself get this DVD because of the lack of cuing and types of exercises in the video.  So, the Cardio Interval gets 2 stars and the Strength Interval gets 4 stars for an average of 3 stars.",3,Split personality,1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,1898,"['did', 'three', 'workouts', 'one', 'long', 'workout', 'play', 'was', 'thinking', 'writing', 'review', 'exercised', 'only', 'did', 'first', 'section', 'review', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'only', '2', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'Cardio', 'Interval', 'mean', 'made', 'sweat', 'thought', 'cuing', 'was', 'horrible', 'transitions', 'movements', 'choppy', 'cued', 'okay', 'now', 'do', 'next', 'exercise', 'was', 'thinking', 'well', 'would', 'do', 'next', 'exercise', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'big', 'secret', 'Then', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'counts', 'sudden', 'switch', 'other', 'side', 'frequently', 'did', 'one', 'less', 'exercise', 'one', 'side', 'think', 'only', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'differnt', 'workouts', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'transitions', ""'m"", 'worried', 'beginners', 'pulling', 'something', 'especially', 'when', 't-stand', 'plank', 'segment', 'Please', 'be', 'careful', 'people', 'second', 'third', 'sections', 'Strength', 'Flexibility', 'thought', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'only', 'two', 'would', 'do', 'again', 'really', 'felt', 'worked', 'whole', 'body', 'Strength', 'segment', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'much', 'weight', 'use', 'did', '8', 'pounds', 'segments', 'are', 'shorter', 'what', ""'m"", 'used', 'doing', '20', 'minutes', 'Cardio', 'Internval', 'Strength', 'Cardio', 'Interval', ""n't"", 'use', 'weights', 'would', 'recommend', 'less', 'weight', 'most', 'people', 'start', 'out', 'new', 'twist', '10', 'minute', 'Flexibility', 'section', 'instead', 'doing', 'static', 'stretches', 'move', 'stretches', 'athletes', 'Again', 'people', 'be', 'careful', 'form', 'are', 'variations', 'beginning', 'exercisers', 'sections', 'got', 'DVD', 'library', 'so', 'might', 'do', 'again', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'intermediate', 'exercisers', 'get', 'DVD', 'lack', 'cuing', 'types', 'exercises', 'video', 'So', 'Cardio', 'Interval', '2', 'stars', 'Strength', 'Interval', '4', 'stars', 'average', '3', 'stars']",Da-bootcamp Total Body Blast

I only do the 10 minute stretch once in a while as I am fitting in a workout before going to work, but I stretch during the day.  Important to stretch as these workouts will tighten your muscles and I like to maintain my flexibility as I am 46 years old.  I must modify the higher impact moves because of arthritic knees.  For example, the knees up high running in the first segment...no way I can do that.  However, I keep my heart rate up by marching or jogging in place not letting my toes leave the floor.  I felt an improvement in upper body strength after a week. I have done Pilates work outs and so I am familiar with the ""T"" stands, but if you are not, you can modify it and work up to the advanced way.  The lower hovers really work my abs.  At first my whole torso shook in trying to keep correct form, but now I am stronger and can hold myself up.  Both segments require moderate agility and balance.  The second segment utilizes weights.  It looks like they are using 5lb weights.  I have gone up to 8, but I would not go heavier as the exercises are not meant to be done with very heavy weights.  If I give it my all, I do work up a good sweat in 20 minutes and feel like I accomplished a workout for the day.  You can't beat that feeling for getting the day off to a good start.  I recommend mixing it up with a variety of other workouts such as: pilates, yoga and dance aerobics.  I hope this was helpful.  Good health to you.

She has some different exercises in here that I found refreshing, just not quite as many reps as there should have been for someone more advanced.  The cardio is good, getting the heart rate up. Once you watch the video a few times you'll know what is coming next so the miscues and sudden switcharoos are something that doesn't bother me.  I like the way she gets right into both workouts without endless stretching before getting serious.

It's REALLY good. I couldnt get through all the squats. man that woman loves squats! I was drenched in sweat and it was fun. She goes back and forth between ""jumping rope"", ""shuffle"", kicks and strength training moves. there are a few yoga moves in there too. I love that all her moves are like 2-in-1 you're working two parts at once. By the way you'll need some dumbbells!I just wanted to add (I'm adding this a few weeks later) that I was initialy very sore from all the squats and my legs burned for a couple of days! but now I'm doing it no problem. This remains one of my favorite work outs.then I did the second part, the cardio (20 minutes) it was fun and intense.She sure makes me sweat!Then I did the stretch segment (10 mins) It's not just stretching it's pilates like movements focusing on stretching and core.I LOVE LOVE LOVE the stretching segment. I do the stretching segment after other work outs. Something about it makes my body feel really good and alive.My body feels good! I can't wait to do this workout. Let me just say something about Denise Austin, at first I was turned off by her peppiness but now i LOVE her. Her videos are the best and alternating doing a bunch of them is doing wonders. The personal trainer DVD kicks my buttox ridiculously! This will be a good balance.

I had been trying Pilates most day, and while I enjoyed this exercise, it really wasn't helping me to reach my goals. I realized I needed to do some cardio. My boyfriend, knowing this, purchased this DVD for me. I must say, I am quite pleased he did.Denise is an excellent instructor. She is extremely enthusiastic, something that I found very motivational. The DVD is divided into three sections: cardio interval training (20 minutes), strength interval training (mixed with a little cardio - 20 minutes), and a stretching segment (10 minutes). The DVD allows you to create custom workouts so that you can take multiple segments and have them follow each other. The workouts are up to date and highly effective. The cardio is a vigorous workout. If you haven't exercised in a while it might be something you have to work up to.I started doing this DVD for 20 minutes every other day, alternating with Pilates. This was a good decision, as it lead to the weight lose I desired over the course of about four months I was able to drop eight pounds, increase my endurance, and tone effectively.I highly recommend this workout, as well as other DVDs by Denise Austin.

Third flaw:  She should call it buns workout because almost every exercise works this area.

What I didn't care for was the choreography on this DVD. There were several things about the choreography that I didn't like such as the fact that so few reps are done on each exercise and just as you really getting into one exercise it is time to move on to the next. There is a lot of jumping and bouncing involved which I don't really care for, and this workout requires you to have an extraordinary amount of balance. I also didn't feel like I worked out.
