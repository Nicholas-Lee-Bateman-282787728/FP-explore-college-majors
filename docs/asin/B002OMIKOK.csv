THIS IS English subbed and thats it. If you hate reading subtitles I suggest you move on. But beyond that its a great story as long as boy love interest doesn't bother you either.,4,"THIS IS NOT English dubbed, BUT STILL GOOD",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,314,"['price', 'was', 'steal', 'Too', 'bad', 'so', 'short', 'description', 'box', 'English', 'dubbed', 'IT', 'NOT', 'THIS', 'English', 'subbed', 'thats', 'hate', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'suggest', 'move', 'great', 'story', 'as', 'long', 'boy', 'love', 'interest', ""n't"", 'bother']",N/A

I have watched these dvds endlessly.  It's really sweet and comforting. In the original manga it's a multi-universe where Keita has a different boyfriend in different books but this is based of the best volume of that series as he is befriended by Kazuki who is a student but secretly runs the school. If you like this,""Loveless"" is another good anime.  There are many similar mangas such as ""Demian Syndrome"", ""Komatta"" and ""Takumi-Kun""...",5,This anime got me through some hard times in my life...,1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,581,"['whole', 'boy', 'school', 'meme', 'popular', 'Japanese', 'manga/anime', 'one', 'classic', 'love', 'story', 'art', 'very', 'beautiful', 'have', 'watched', 'dvds', 'endlessly', 'really', 'sweet', 'comforting', 'original', 'manga', 'multi-universe', 'where', 'Keita', 'different', 'boyfriend', 'different', 'books', 'based', 'best', 'volume', 'series', 'befriended', 'Kazuki', 'who', 'student', 'secretly', 'school', 'like', 'Loveless', 'good', 'anime', 'are', 'many', 'similar', 'mangas', 'such', 'Demian', 'Syndrome', 'Komatta', 'Takumi-Kun']",N/A
