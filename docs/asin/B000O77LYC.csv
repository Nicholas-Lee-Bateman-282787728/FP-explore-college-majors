I've been watching them for years and I still laugh everytime at Rodney's amusing bright ideas, eccentric manners, funny jokes and sarcastic commentaries.

But if you love the hurkey-jerky movements of Rodney Dangerfield and admire his willingness to make a fool of himself, then these movies are for you.  If not, stay away.  I love the whole concept of the ""uncool"" latino in ""Easy Money,"" especially when he and his friend come to his father-in-law's home to attempt to win back his naive bride. I thought I'd fall off my seat.  Equally absurd in ""Back to School"" is Rodney himself, paunchy and raunchy, joining his son's college diving team and testing the wind before performing a ""triple lindy,"" a dive no one can do, let alone an old, out-of-shape business tycoon, who owns Tall and Fat Stores (clothing).Who cares about the plot (There is one in each film.) or the acting?  The situations are outrageous, in the old sense of the word, as outrageous as Rodney himself.  The man didn't take himself seriously.  I don't know why some of the condescending critics do.  As Rodney says in his graduation speech at the conclusion of ""Back to School"":""Look out for number one, but don't step in number 2.""",5,Got to Love Rodney,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,1173,"['Irreverent', 'understatement', 'characters', 'played', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'Back', 'School', 'Easy', 'Money', 'love', 'hurkey-jerky', 'movements', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'admire', 'willingness', 'make', 'fool', 'then', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'stay', 'away', 'love', 'whole', 'concept', 'uncool', 'latino', 'Easy', 'Money', 'especially', 'when', 'friend', 'come', 'father-in-law', 'home', 'attempt', 'win', 'back', 'naive', 'bride', 'thought', ""'d"", 'fall', 'off', 'seat', 'Equally', 'absurd', 'Back', 'School', 'Rodney', 'paunchy', 'raunchy', 'joining', 'son', 'college', 'diving', 'team', 'testing', 'wind', 'performing', 'triple', 'lindy', 'dive', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'let', 'alone', 'old', 'out-of-shape', 'business', 'tycoon', 'who', 'Tall', 'Fat', 'Stores', 'clothing', '.Who', 'plot', 'one', 'film', 'acting', 'situations', 'are', 'outrageous', 'old', 'sense', 'word', 'as', 'outrageous', 'Rodney', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'condescending', 'critics', 'do', 'Rodney', 'graduation', 'speech', 'conclusion', 'Back', 'School', 'Look', 'out', 'number', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'step', 'number', '2']",N/A
