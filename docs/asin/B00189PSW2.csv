Great actor, drop dead good looks, and enough charisma to charm even the staunchest movie critic.AS for the movie? I liked the message, but not necessarily the content. Who can argue that love and committment to family is a bad thing? The movie attempted to prove that African Americans do appreciate wholesome movies rather than the trash that is being spoonfed to their community. The female lead, played brilliantly by Ryan Michelle Bathe, is a screenwriter who with her producer husband produce a movie that gets rave reviews at film festivals but fail to secure a distributor. The screenwriter aims to change that by writing a great screenplay in very short time. That done, she is convinced that she has a great product that will sell for sure. All she needs a bankable star. Morgan Freeman comes to mind. She and her husband with their toddler in tow travel to Mississippi to find Mr. Freeman. On the way, they run into obstacles that make them question her obsession with the movie business. In the end, they do run into Mr. Freeman (or someone who looks like him).The bottom line is that the movie was never made. Why? Because is wasn't good enough? Because it wasn't bankable enough? We will never know, but that is not the important part. What is important is that love and committment to family prevailed.",3,Great cast,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1387,"['Boris', 'Kodjoe', 'not', 'already', 'Hollywood', 'A-list', 'should', 'be', 'Great', 'actor', 'drop', 'dead', 'good', 'looks', 'enough', 'charisma', 'charm', 'even', 'staunchest', 'movie', 'critic.AS', 'movie', 'liked', 'message', 'not', 'necessarily', 'content', 'Who', 'can', 'argue', 'love', 'committment', 'family', 'bad', 'thing', 'movie', 'attempted', 'prove', 'African', 'Americans', 'do', 'appreciate', 'wholesome', 'movies', 'rather', 'trash', 'being', 'spoonfed', 'community', 'female', 'lead', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Ryan', 'Michelle', 'Bathe', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'producer', 'husband', 'produce', 'movie', 'rave', 'reviews', 'film', 'festivals', 'fail', 'secure', 'distributor', 'screenwriter', 'change', 'writing', 'great', 'screenplay', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'done', 'convinced', 'great', 'product', 'will', 'sell', 'sure', 'bankable', 'star', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'mind', 'husband', 'toddler', 'tow', 'travel', 'Mississippi', 'find', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'way', 'run', 'obstacles', 'make', 'question', 'obsession', 'movie', 'business', 'end', 'do', 'run', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'someone', 'who', '.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'was', ""n't"", 'bankable', 'enough', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'not', 'important', 'part', 'What', 'important', 'love', 'committment', 'family', 'prevailed']",N/A
