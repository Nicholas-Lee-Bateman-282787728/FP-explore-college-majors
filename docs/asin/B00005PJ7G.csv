673375,A1A3ZFTFW2SY1M,B00005PJ7G,chromo_man,"[0, 0]","A cute film, with a few problems that you should be willing to overlook.  Its characters are all vivid, and I would include the New York City scene as a character in itself.  The 2 main BFF characters are all so wrapped up in being artsy that they purposely eschew any emotion-based relationships, and then you know what happens.  The film has a really great cast, including all the supporting and background characters, and an eye-popping array of artsy costumes and furnishings.  The screenplay was adapted by Douglas Carter Beane from his own stage play, and the dialogue often seems a bit stagey and forced.  But, as I said, you should overlook the shortcomings and focus on the very watchable goings on.  That's my advice:  just watch and enjoy!",4,My advice,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,750,"['cute', 'film', 'few', 'problems', 'should', 'be', 'willing', 'overlook', 'characters', 'are', 'vivid', 'would', 'include', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'scene', 'character', '2', 'main', 'BFF', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'being', 'artsy', 'purposely', 'eschew', 'emotion-based', 'relationships', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'great', 'cast', 'including', 'supporting', 'background', 'characters', 'eye-popping', 'array', 'artsy', 'costumes', 'furnishings', 'screenplay', 'was', 'adapted', 'Douglas', 'Carter', 'Beane', 'own', 'stage', 'play', 'dialogue', 'often', 'bit', 'stagey', 'forced', 'said', 'should', 'overlook', 'shortcomings', 'focus', 'very', 'watchable', 'goings', 'advice', 'just', 'watch', 'enjoy']",Advice From a Caterpillar
673376,A1A0S7SOGWO9SU,B00005PJ7G,"CincinnatiPOV ""Bibliophile""","[4, 6]","There are some women, great women I might add, who totally freak about relationships and run away from the very idea of them. I am one of those women. And, alas, a movie has been made about my kind.Advice from a Caterpillar is great because the lead is as psycho about relationships as I am. Maybe even more so. The lead actress (sorry, don't know the actress' name) is dating a man she calls the suit who is married because she knows his being married protects her from anything too serious. Her best friend (Andy Dick) is a gay man and therefore off limits in terms of  a relationship.Then the gay friend meets a bisexual someone who they are both in love with. Enter Timothy Olyphant. Olyphant is pretty much a yummy piece of eye candy anyway, but in this movie he is absolutely edible!What ensues as the relationship-phobic woman falls in love is great. It is me.The title of the film comes from a line in Alice in Wonderland, ""Come back!"" the Caterpillar called after her.

I didn't like how her character was mean to his through a lot of it, but she was a very high maintenance person with commitment issues and it made sense. I highly recommend this movie if you like these two actors.

I originally rented it solely because it starred Cynthia Nixon & I am a big SATC and Miranda Hobbes fan, but it won me over! I had to find a copy for my movie library & I'm thrilled I found it so easily here on Amazon. I am not an Andy Dick fan at all, but even he had his shining moments in this film. And, Timothy Olyphant was an actor I was familiar with, but had not really left much of an impression on me...until now! He was terrific here and he & Nixon are adorable together.

673379,ANOBZWKE25SBY,B00005PJ7G,Tracy Vest,"[2, 2]","Cynthia Nixon portrays Missy, a celebrated artist, whose claim to fame is taking her family's cheesy home movies, copying them on video, and then adding wry commentary. Her best friend Spaz (Andy Dick) can't seem to keep a relationship or art gig going, and has turned to catering to pay the bills. Commitment phobe Missy is happy with her affair with married ""suit"" (Jon Tenney), provided he remains casual about their relationship. Add to the mix bi-sexual Brat (Timothy Olyphant) who has captured both Spaz and Missy's eyes. Missy and Brat are attracted to each other, but is she willing to ruin a long-term friendship for a roll in the hay? Apparently. Instead of joining Spaz and Suit for a weekend in the country, Missy and Brat have a roll in the city. With next morning blues, Missy races to Spaz to confess.Can anyone really believe that Tenney and Olyphant would vie for a whiney fashion don't like Nixon? Just another pretentious piece of tripe released under the guise of independent film making. There is zero chemistry between Nixon and either man. Compare that to her on-screen chemistry with Johnny Messner in ""One Last Thing,"" which does a much better job of displaying her acting talent. This was jut a huge disappointment from start to finish.The only thing original about this story is the title, derived from ""Alice in Wonderland,"" which plays a key role in the film.
