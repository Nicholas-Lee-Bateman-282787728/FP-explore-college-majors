1089946,A34PAZQ73SL163,B000TGJ8EY,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[18, 34]","I heard a lot of buzz about this series so I gave these episodes a gander after they came out on DVD. I was not previously familiar with BET or its slant on the issues of the day. What I saw in the depictions of these men was extremely unsettling. All of them, in some way, were presented as being victims of The Man or The System. This is preposterous in my view. Being born poor or of low socioeconomic status is never an excuse to commit to a life of crime. Do I begrudge the person who must steal a loaf of bread to survive? No, I do not but I do begrudge the person who steals to get rich or to die trying. There is no explanation or justification possible for this. The inner-city is not a place without hope. There are tens of thousands of black Americans who were born at the same time as Tookie Williams or later Ricky Ross--who came from exactly the same kinds of neighborhood they did--who never broke the law and went on to lead productive lives. In our urban areas today, there are thousands of individuals who come from the community who work in the community as postal workers, teachers, policemen, firemen, small store owners, and entrepreneurs with differing levels of status.Such a message does not come across in these episodes as the only voice of reason is Bernard Parks, the former Chief of the LA Police. That Tom Hayden, a revolutionary throughout the 1960s, would be described as a community activist is obscene. He believes, and has written, that those in jail are uniformly oppressed, political prisoners. Of course he would think that Tookie Williams was only a victim of circumstance. What else would he say? As for the folks he murdered, they are no longer capable of speaking for themselves.I also believe that the whole CIA conspiracy angle with crack cocaine is pretty sick and fallacious. Nobody in the CIA was authorized to work in the streets of America or to do anything here. Obviously, I am not nave enough to pretend that there are not rogue agents out there doing what they want until they're caught but that does not equate with a government conspiracy to circulate crack in our urban areas. That Ross worked hand-in-hand with someone who became a government informer is an inevitable byproduct of choosing the business he did. Most of us choose, on a daily basis, not to take the easier route or be corrupted by money should it include the possibility of going to jail. The fellows profiled here made different choices...and they paid the price.",1,Disappointing and Depressing.,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,2488,"['heard', 'lot', 'buzz', 'series', 'gave', 'episodes', 'gander', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'previously', 'familiar', 'BET', 'slant', 'issues', 'day', 'What', 'saw', 'depictions', 'men', 'was', 'extremely', 'unsettling', 'way', 'were', 'presented', 'being', 'victims', 'Man', 'System', 'preposterous', 'view', 'Being', 'born', 'poor', 'low', 'socioeconomic', 'status', 'never', 'excuse', 'commit', 'life', 'crime', 'Do', 'begrudge', 'person', 'who', 'must', 'steal', 'loaf', 'bread', 'survive', 'No', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'begrudge', 'person', 'who', 'get', 'rich', 'die', 'trying', 'explanation', 'justification', 'possible', 'inner-city', 'not', 'place', 'hope', 'are', 'tens', 'thousands', 'black', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'born', 'same', 'time', 'Tookie', 'Williams', 'later', 'Ricky', 'Ross', 'who', 'came', 'exactly', 'same', 'kinds', 'neighborhood', 'did', 'who', 'never', 'broke', 'law', 'went', 'lead', 'productive', 'lives', 'urban', 'areas', 'today', 'are', 'thousands', 'individuals', 'who', 'come', 'community', 'who', 'work', 'community', 'postal', 'workers', 'teachers', 'policemen', 'firemen', 'small', 'store', 'owners', 'entrepreneurs', 'differing', 'levels', 'message', 'not', 'come', 'episodes', 'only', 'voice', 'reason', 'Bernard', 'Parks', 'former', 'Chief', 'LA', 'Police', 'Tom', 'Hayden', 'revolutionary', '1960s', 'would', 'be', 'described', 'community', 'activist', 'obscene', 'written', 'jail', 'are', 'uniformly', 'oppressed', 'political', 'prisoners', 'course', 'would', 'think', 'Tookie', 'Williams', 'was', 'only', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'What', 'else', 'would', 'say', 'folks', 'murdered', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'capable', 'speaking', 'themselves.I', 'also', 'believe', 'whole', 'CIA', 'conspiracy', 'angle', 'crack', 'cocaine', 'pretty', 'sick', 'fallacious', 'Nobody', 'CIA', 'was', 'authorized', 'work', 'streets', 'America', 'do', 'anything', 'here', 'Obviously', 'am', 'not', 'nave', 'enough', 'pretend', 'are', 'not', 'rogue', 'agents', 'there', 'doing', 'what', 'want', ""'re"", 'caught', 'not', 'equate', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'circulate', 'crack', 'urban', 'areas', 'Ross', 'worked', 'hand-in-hand', 'someone', 'who', 'became', 'government', 'informer', 'inevitable', 'byproduct', 'choosing', 'business', 'did', 'Most', 'choose', 'daily', 'basis', 'not', 'take', 'easier', 'route', 'be', 'corrupted', 'money', 'should', 'include', 'possibility', 'going', 'jail', 'fellows', 'profiled', 'here', 'made', 'different', 'choices', 'paid', 'price']",N/A

1089950,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B000TGJ8EY,Pork Chop,"[0, 0]","American Gangster - First Season - at first glance may suggest arepetition of content with the relatively large number of otherunderworld documentaries, the only difference being much uniquematerial for the most part, explained from the series beingcreated, broadcast and intended for BET cable TV.Each episode is 40 minutes, well edited with a decent audioaccompaniment. The historical narrative is sufficient, and the storyis backed up by direct face to face witnesses about events from daysgone by. Unlike some other series, there are no academicians orhistorians, replaced instead with the versions of law enforcementofficers of the time and major public figures.In the episode concerning South Central LA, the 1970's and 1980'sand Rick ""Freeway"" Ross, the entire controversy of CIA involvementin the narcotics for cash for the Nicaragua Contra's is gone overone more time. The CIA's asset and connection in the USA, DaniloBlandone, orchestrated the import of cocaine from Colombia'sMedellin cartel, at disguised or CIA paid aerodromes, about thelength and size of a soccer field around many locations in SouthUSA. For the uninformed, Congress had cut off funding for USAsupported rebels attempting to overthrow the Nicaraguan Marxistgovernment, and so it is said, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North,POTUS Ronald Reagan, VP GHW Bush, William J. Casey, Admiral JohnPoindexter and others were said in the papers to either haveknowledge or went along with the operations at the time.The footage of the series works well in accompanying the narrative,albeit  extremely selective in avoiding any offensive orcontroversial content.We hear that Ricky Ross was a charismatic yet bizarre choice for theboss position in the organization, considering illiteracy, lack ofsophistication in clothes, lifestyle, and  familiarity with taxes,in the use of military equipment (rocket launchers, UZI, AK-47,etc.) Despite all those shortcomings,  Ross surrounded himself withpeople who had all those skills, perhaps under suggestion ofBlandone. Admittedly, nobody could be jealous of the profits he madeand how he spent it as the paper he made didn't seem to go to hishead.The impact of a $25 piece of crack was immense in the community,with sales  of 100 kg worth $2 million per week. The devastation andepidemic in Los Angeles was stunning ... 90,000 homeless peoplebegan living in cardboard boxes on the streets, destroyedemotionally and physically from substance abuse.The CIA and Blandone, were hawks in maintaining their market shareby offering quantities and prices to dealers and consumers that noother gang could beat, to the point that Ross was gave away $1 and$5 bills and coins as ""garbage"" to cohorts, keeping only the bigbills ($20, $100, $1000 and above) for his money counting machines.From a DEA standpoint (who had taken its marching orders from theCIA in El Salvador operations and Colombia), and local police, thechaos still required a public reaction, such as with APC's carryingbattering rams  to knock down fortified rock-houses which weredealer locations), all the while a number of UHF, VHF and radioscanners were handed over to Ross, to monitor police frequencies.Ross invested in motels, auto parts dealers and threw parties in thecommunity to gain a notoriety and acceptance, all the whilestrawberries traded tricks for crack, and sentences were made moreseverage  in face of  the  calamity. Today, Blandone is under thewitness protection program, while Ross is serving his sentence.",4,"Unique material for the most part created, broadcast and intended for BET",1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,3492,"['American', 'Gangster', 'First', 'Season', 'first', 'glance', 'may', 'suggest', 'arepetition', 'content', 'relatively', 'large', 'number', 'otherunderworld', 'documentaries', 'only', 'difference', 'being', 'much', 'uniquematerial', 'most', 'part', 'explained', 'series', 'beingcreated', 'broadcast', 'intended', 'BET', 'cable', 'TV.Each', 'episode', '40', 'minutes', 'well', 'edited', 'decent', 'audioaccompaniment', 'historical', 'narrative', 'sufficient', 'storyis', 'backed', 'up', 'direct', 'face', 'face', 'witnesses', 'events', 'daysgone', 'other', 'series', 'are', 'academicians', 'orhistorians', 'replaced', 'instead', 'versions', 'law', 'enforcementofficers', 'time', 'major', 'public', 'figures.In', 'episode', 'concerning', 'South', 'Central', 'LA', '1970', ""1980'sand"", 'Rick', 'Freeway', 'Ross', 'entire', 'controversy', 'CIA', 'involvementin', 'narcotics', 'cash', 'Nicaragua', 'Contra', 'gone', 'overone', 'more', 'time', 'CIA', 'asset', 'connection', 'USA', 'DaniloBlandone', 'orchestrated', 'import', 'cocaine', ""Colombia'sMedellin"", 'cartel', 'disguised', 'CIA', 'paid', 'aerodromes', 'thelength', 'size', 'soccer', 'field', 'around', 'many', 'locations', 'SouthUSA', 'uninformed', 'Congress', 'had', 'cut', 'off', 'funding', 'USAsupported', 'rebels', 'attempting', 'overthrow', 'Nicaraguan', 'Marxistgovernment', 'said', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Oliver', 'North', 'POTUS', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'VP', 'GHW', 'Bush', 'William', 'J.', 'Casey', 'Admiral', 'JohnPoindexter', 'others', 'were', 'said', 'papers', 'haveknowledge', 'went', 'operations', 'time.The', 'footage', 'series', 'well', 'accompanying', 'narrative', 'albeit', 'extremely', 'selective', 'avoiding', 'offensive', 'orcontroversial', 'content.We', 'hear', 'Ricky', 'Ross', 'was', 'charismatic', 'yet', 'bizarre', 'choice', 'theboss', 'position', 'organization', 'considering', 'illiteracy', 'lack', 'ofsophistication', 'clothes', 'lifestyle', 'familiarity', 'taxes', 'use', 'military', 'equipment', 'rocket', 'launchers', 'UZI', 'AK-47', 'etc', 'shortcomings', 'Ross', 'surrounded', 'withpeople', 'who', 'had', 'skills', 'perhaps', 'suggestion', 'ofBlandone', 'Admittedly', 'nobody', 'could', 'be', 'jealous', 'profits', 'madeand', 'how', 'spent', 'paper', 'made', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'hishead.The', 'impact', '25', 'piece', 'crack', 'was', 'immense', 'community', 'sales', '100', 'kg', 'worth', '2', 'million', 'week', 'devastation', 'andepidemic', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'was', 'stunning', '90,000', 'homeless', 'peoplebegan', 'living', 'cardboard', 'boxes', 'streets', 'destroyedemotionally', 'physically', 'substance', 'abuse.The', 'CIA', 'Blandone', 'were', 'hawks', 'maintaining', 'market', 'shareby', 'offering', 'quantities', 'prices', 'dealers', 'consumers', 'gang', 'could', 'beat', 'point', 'Ross', 'was', 'gave', 'away', '1', '5', 'bills', 'coins', 'garbage', 'cohorts', 'keeping', 'only', 'bigbills', '20', '100', '1000', 'money', 'counting', 'DEA', 'standpoint', 'who', 'had', 'taken', 'marching', 'orders', 'theCIA', 'El', 'Salvador', 'operations', 'Colombia', 'local', 'police', 'thechaos', 'still', 'required', 'public', 'reaction', 'such', 'APC', 'carryingbattering', 'rams', 'knock', 'down', 'fortified', 'rock-houses', 'weredealer', 'locations', 'number', 'UHF', 'VHF', 'radioscanners', 'were', 'handed', 'Ross', 'monitor', 'police', 'frequencies.Ross', 'invested', 'motels', 'auto', 'parts', 'dealers', 'threw', 'parties', 'thecommunity', 'gain', 'notoriety', 'acceptance', 'whilestrawberries', 'traded', 'tricks', 'crack', 'sentences', 'were', 'made', 'moreseverage', 'face', 'calamity', 'Today', 'Blandone', 'thewitness', 'protection', 'program', 'Ross', 'serving', 'sentence']",N/A
