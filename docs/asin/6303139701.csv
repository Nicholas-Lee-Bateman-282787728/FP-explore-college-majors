Several fighters go through their eagle claw sparring forms on some soundstage with a serious-sounding narrator describing the history of the forms.  You know what I'm talking about.  This always gets me excited that I'm in for a treat.  I was not disappointed. In this Shaw Brothers-like tastey little kung fu diddy, the film relies heavily on the &quot;7 eagle claw styles&quot; and the secret 8th and 9th styles.  Pretty nice classic kung fu storyline.  The fighting is intriquing and satisfying.  Having said that, this is not a great movie, but a nice, supremely watchable movie.  As I think back to the days when I saw films like these in theatres in the 70s, this would probably be the &quot;second&quot; movie on the triple bill, not the &quot;marquee&quot; film, though not the &quot;third&quot; film either.

Yes, this is one of those.Tai Seng - Martial Arts Theater did a pretty good job with the transfer to DVD of this classic. When I first saw it on VHS it was great then.  The overdubs and picture quality was pretty good.  The widescreen is exceptional - can't complain at all.In this flick you basically have the Praying Mantis school trying to eliminate The Eagle's Claw school.  The head pupil, played by Lo Lieh, pretends to defect to the Praying Mantis school after pretending to kill his master.  In actuality, his master was fatally injured by a chest blow from the teacher from the Praying Mantis school.  He died two days later. Knowing he will die soon, the teacher from The Eagle's Claw school told his head pupil to infiltrate The Praying Mantis school in order to learn their kung fu techniques in order to later take revenge.  The Eagle's Claw school soon put out the word that the head pupil killed their master and that they wanted him dead. The teacher from The Praying School felt he could use this situation to his advantage by enlisting the help of Lo Lieh to kill everyone in The Eagle's Claw school.
