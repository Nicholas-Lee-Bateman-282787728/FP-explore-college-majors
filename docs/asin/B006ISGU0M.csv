I like that it focuses on the side body--I especially like ""tick tock"" and the figure 8 flourish. Unfortunately, for me, Grace & Gusto seems relatively easy and the routine does not seem as seemless and well integrated as Ellen's recent workouts (particularly in the middle with the kicks and chair moves, which just feel too random). Still, a nice workout that I have completed several times. I look forward to more Ellen Barrett workouts.",4,Nice Side Body Workout,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,563,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'Ellen', 'Barrett', 'fan', 'have', '10', 'dvd', 'other', 'workouts', 'Grace', 'Gusto', 'fluid', 'graceful', 'side', 'body', 'especially', 'tick', 'tock', 'figure', '8', 'flourish', 'Unfortunately', 'Grace', 'Gusto', 'relatively', 'easy', 'routine', 'not', 'seem', 'seemless', 'well', 'integrated', 'Ellen', 'recent', 'workouts', 'particularly', 'middle', 'kicks', 'chair', 'moves', 'just', 'feel', 'too', 'random', 'Still', 'nice', 'workout', 'have', 'completed', 'several', 'times', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'Ellen', 'Barrett', 'workouts']",Grace and Gusto
