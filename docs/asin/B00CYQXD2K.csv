Going from place to place and either helping or screwing over major companies. Each episode was a different company. Here though, they try to play it much more serious than it was. The tension of the merger is gone, The Rainmaker is mysteriously gone, replaced with some lady who isn't as threatening as the Rainmaker was. But she show is still good and Don Cheadle is still amazing as Marty Kahn. If you liked season one, than season two is still a very fun show. But it lacks the punch season one had.",4,"Still good, but inferior to season one.",1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,589,"['watched', 'House', 'Lies', 'whim', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Going', 'place', 'place', 'helping', 'screwing', 'major', 'companies', 'episode', 'was', 'different', 'company', 'Here', 'try', 'play', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'was', 'tension', 'merger', 'gone', 'Rainmaker', 'mysteriously', 'gone', 'replaced', 'lady', 'who', ""n't"", 'as', 'threatening', 'Rainmaker', 'was', 'show', 'still', 'good', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'still', 'amazing', 'Marty', 'Kahn', 'liked', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'still', 'very', 'fun', 'show', 'punch', 'season', 'one', 'had']",House of Lies: Season 2

1652195,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B00CYQXD2K,Irfan A. Alvi,"[3, 3]","Season 1 introduced us to the sordid world of management consulting, and was very entertaining, though often implausibly over the top in various ways.  I just finished Season 2 and would say that it's equally entertaining, but it almost feels like a different show altogether, more about the people, less about screwing over clients.  The characters are mostly the same as Season 1, but they develop in different ways, generally becoming deeper, richer, emanating contradictions, more human.  It's good.To be more specific, the first two episodes made me feel like the series was going downhill to the extent that I almost wanted to bail, but episode 3 with Matt Damon is hilarious, and then the series just keeps changing from there, frequently in unpredictable and chaotic ways.  It's as though the writers are searching for something they can't quite put their finger on, so doing a lot of experimenting, but the result is fascinating and gripping.  The tension builds until the finale, which will leave you very eager to see what unfolds in Season 3, so I'd say Season 2 did its job!",5,New dimensions open up,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,1087,"['Season', '1', 'introduced', 'sordid', 'world', 'management', 'consulting', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'though', 'often', 'implausibly', 'top', 'various', 'ways', 'just', 'finished', 'Season', '2', 'would', 'say', 'equally', 'entertaining', 'almost', 'feels', 'different', 'show', 'altogether', 'more', 'people', 'less', 'screwing', 'clients', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'same', 'Season', '1', 'develop', 'different', 'ways', 'generally', 'becoming', 'deeper', 'richer', 'emanating', 'contradictions', 'more', 'human', 'good.To', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'made', 'feel', 'series', 'was', 'going', 'downhill', 'extent', 'almost', 'wanted', 'bail', 'episode', '3', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'hilarious', 'then', 'series', 'just', 'changing', 'there', 'frequently', 'unpredictable', 'chaotic', 'ways', 'writers', 'are', 'searching', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'doing', 'lot', 'experimenting', 'result', 'fascinating', 'gripping', 'tension', 'finale', 'will', 'leave', 'very', 'eager', 'see', 'what', 'Season', '3', 'so', ""'d"", 'say', 'Season', '2', 'did', 'job']",House of Lies: Season 2

I felt like the second season was a big improvement from the first, and I really liked the first season.  Kristen Bell is the best, anything she does I will watch, she works great next to Cheadle.  Also, you can't forget about Ben Schwartz and Josh Lawson, when they are together, you can guarantee it will be funny.This season also had some great guest stars, my favorite 2 were Jenny Slate (as Sarah,Doug's girlfriend) and Matt Damon (as Matt Damon).
