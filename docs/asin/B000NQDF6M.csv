1059563,A3P8H2VFQ5K605,B000NQDF6M,Dr. Morbius,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed this DVD. But space historians must realize that engaging film footage of this 1967 event is somewhat limited (silent footage of technicians scrutinizing burned spacecraft fragments in a hangar isn't the most dramatic stuff to watch). Looking back, it's amazing to me how much 16mm news footage of the 1960s was ""silent"" with a soundtrack added in post production (and also not always synchronized). I understand that the Apollo 1 fire, as it was seen by mission controllers via a camera pointed on the spacecraft on the pad, was not videotaped. The funeral footage (all three astronaut funerals included) is here; it adds a very powerful, emotional element to this DVD. I was disappointed that a booklet, referenced in the video, is not included in the DVD box. The manufacturer replied to my e-mail inquiry and said the booklet is online, however, no link was given to me and my later inquiry about it went unanswered. Also, I was hoping for a little more biographical material on the three men, but that was not provided. Overall, I have high praise for this DVD; it is the best of its kind regarding the Apollo 1 fire. You won't find a better visual and audio record--at least in one place--of this tragic event. For space historians, it's a very good reference to own. Today, the blackened Apollo 1 spacecraft is kept locked away from public gaze in a NASA vault; I know it was viewed by a television crew a few years ago. Since it is a ""tomb"", of sorts, it should probably remain out of sight even though it has historical value. No matter, the ultimate fate of Apollo 1 is unknown. In many ways, I don't think NASA has come to grips with it even after the two shuttle accidents. Maybe Apollo 1 should be buried at what remains of Pad 34 at Cape Canaveral along with the memorial there to Grissom, White and Chaffee.",4,A Fire in the Spacecraft,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1832,"['enjoyed', 'DVD', 'space', 'historians', 'must', 'realize', 'engaging', 'film', 'footage', '1967', 'event', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'silent', 'footage', 'technicians', 'scrutinizing', 'burned', 'spacecraft', 'fragments', 'hangar', ""n't"", 'most', 'dramatic', 'stuff', 'watch', 'Looking', 'back', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', '16mm', 'news', 'footage', '1960s', 'was', 'silent', 'soundtrack', 'added', 'post', 'production', 'also', 'not', 'always', 'synchronized', 'understand', 'Apollo', '1', 'fire', 'was', 'seen', 'mission', 'controllers', 'camera', 'pointed', 'spacecraft', 'pad', 'was', 'not', 'videotaped', 'funeral', 'footage', 'three', 'astronaut', 'funerals', 'included', 'here', 'very', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'element', 'DVD', 'was', 'disappointed', 'booklet', 'referenced', 'video', 'not', 'included', 'DVD', 'box', 'manufacturer', 'replied', 'e-mail', 'inquiry', 'said', 'booklet', 'online', 'however', 'link', 'was', 'given', 'later', 'inquiry', 'went', 'unanswered', 'Also', 'was', 'hoping', 'little', 'more', 'biographical', 'material', 'three', 'men', 'was', 'not', 'provided', 'Overall', 'have', 'high', 'praise', 'DVD', 'best', 'kind', 'regarding', 'Apollo', '1', 'fire', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'better', 'visual', 'audio', 'record', 'least', 'one', 'place', 'tragic', 'event', 'space', 'historians', 'very', 'good', 'reference', 'own', 'Today', 'blackened', 'Apollo', '1', 'spacecraft', 'kept', 'locked', 'away', 'public', 'gaze', 'NASA', 'vault', 'know', 'was', 'viewed', 'television', 'crew', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'tomb', 'sorts', 'should', 'probably', 'remain', 'sight', 'even', 'historical', 'value', 'matter', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'Apollo', '1', 'unknown', 'many', 'ways', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'NASA', 'come', 'grips', 'even', 'two', 'shuttle', 'accidents', 'Maybe', 'Apollo', '1', 'should', 'be', 'buried', 'what', 'Pad', '34', 'Cape', 'Canaveral', 'memorial', 'there', 'Grissom', 'White', 'Chaffee']",N/A

There were reasons for Gus to be in a bad mood and difficult to work with leading up to the pad fire and it required the death of his crew to make the point to NASA.I nevertheless keep this important box set to answer questions that come up from friends from time to time on the failed mission.  I just don't see how anyone can watch this box set numerous times in its entirety. It is just too depressing.I never understood the character of Gus portraid in the ""Right Stuff"" and believe the film did not give proper credit to this great American.  Surely it must be understood that he would not have been selected for one of the first Mercury, Gemini and the very first manned Apollo mission if NASA had any doubts about Gus blowing the hatch at the wrong time during the second Mercury mission.Gus Grissom was a no nonsense test pilot and engineer. He was once asked what the most difficult part of the space program was? His response was ""probably this interview"".Gus was also quoted commenting on risk:""If we die, we want people to accept it. We are in a risky business and we hope that if anything happens to us it will not delay the program. The conquest of space is worth the risk of life.""After the pad fire of Apollo 1, NASA fixed all the problems with the spacecraft and the design of the future Orion is being based on that of Apollo.",3,Apollo 1-Documentation of a sad event in our space program.,1242432000,"05 16, 2009",2009,1512,"['Apollo', '1-I', 'found', 'viewing', 'Spacecraft', 'Films', 'product', 'was', 'very', 'thorough', 'documentary', 'however', 'could', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'just', 'one', 'time', 'were', 'reasons', 'Gus', 'be', 'bad', 'mood', 'difficult', 'work', 'leading', 'up', 'pad', 'fire', 'required', 'death', 'crew', 'make', 'point', 'NASA.I', 'nevertheless', 'keep', 'important', 'box', 'set', 'answer', 'questions', 'come', 'up', 'friends', 'time', 'time', 'failed', 'mission', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'watch', 'box', 'set', 'numerous', 'times', 'entirety', 'just', 'too', 'depressing.I', 'never', 'understood', 'character', 'Gus', 'portraid', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'believe', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'proper', 'credit', 'great', 'American', 'Surely', 'must', 'be', 'understood', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'selected', 'one', 'first', 'Mercury', 'Gemini', 'very', 'first', 'manned', 'Apollo', 'mission', 'NASA', 'had', 'doubts', 'Gus', 'blowing', 'hatch', 'wrong', 'time', 'second', 'Mercury', 'mission.Gus', 'Grissom', 'was', 'nonsense', 'test', 'pilot', 'engineer', 'was', 'once', 'asked', 'what', 'most', 'difficult', 'part', 'space', 'program', 'was', 'response', 'was', 'probably', 'interview', '.Gus', 'was', 'also', 'quoted', 'commenting', 'risk', 'die', 'want', 'people', 'accept', 'are', 'risky', 'business', 'hope', 'anything', 'will', 'not', 'delay', 'program', 'conquest', 'space', 'risk', 'life', 'pad', 'fire', 'Apollo', '1', 'NASA', 'fixed', 'problems', 'spacecraft', 'design', 'future', 'Orion', 'being', 'based', 'Apollo']",N/A
