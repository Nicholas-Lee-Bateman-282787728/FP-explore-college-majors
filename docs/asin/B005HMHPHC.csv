Rawhide is a lot of fun and keeps me entertained episode after episode.  I am way to young to have seen this when it was originally on TV and am glad I am now getting the opportunity to see it.  Clint Eastwood's character ""Rowdy Yates"" is very personable and shows that even in his early career Eastwood was a superb actor.  Although I must admit the price is kind of high for these and I am not thrilled with the splitting up of the second season and beyond, the show is great and I I plan on buying every season as they become available. I hope that, unlike with Gunsmoke, I will not be waiting until I am 60 to see the rest on DVD.
