I think the movie was done well and moved easily too.  It's the bold face truth.  It's nothing really shocking or bad either.  I also enjoyed the book Elvis What happened?  by his other body guards.  There's nothing really bad in that book either.  He was a human being.  No saint.

1091627,AR3BZOTB7IY78,B000TME1AY,Anton Karidian,"[1, 2]","I recently rented PROTECTING THE KING from a public library, and as I watched it I was sad to reflect that many people besides myself would be viewing this trash film. Of course, writer and director D. Edward (David) Stanley was with Elvis Presley on tour and I was not, yet I have read a good deal about Elvis, and this movie does not jive well with what I have read. I think PROTECTING THE KING is at best a negative exaggeration of what happened, and at worst is outright fabrications.  Regardless of how true any of it is, the movie is a very unbalanced view because it is almost all bad stuff about Elvis's entourage and makes Elvis himself look pretty bad directly and indirectly, which I know is a distorted view of reality.In case you didn't know, David Stanley is Elvis's step-brother, since Elvis's father Vernon married Dee Stanley after his first wife Gladys died. David Stanley is well known for making false allegations against Elvis, such as several years ago when he claimed that Elvis was a regular user of cocaine, a claim that was refuted by several other members of Elvis's entourage. At one point Stanley also claimed that Elvis committed suicide, a charge that also did not stand up under scrutiny. Why he says these things I don't know, but I believe that PROTECTING THE KING is more of the same false allegations and exaggerations.Also, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the movie is poorly written, directed, and acted. I also did not like that Elvis is never named in the film, but is always referred to as ""the King"" or ""the Boss,"" while the names of most others in the film are changed. Why was this done? I don't know all the legal aspects of this situation, but it seems to me that if the film were accurate, it would not have been necessary to omit or change names. Did Stanley fear being sued for making false allegations against people? Especially if you're an Elvis fan I would NOT recommend that you watch PROTECTING THE KING, since you'd probably be angered by it as I was. I mean, I like knowing the good and the bad about people, but I don't like seeing falsehoods and exaggerations such as this most likely is. I'd much rather see again the fine concert documentariesElvis - That's the Way It Is (Special Edition)and alsoElvis on Tour.",1,Self-Serving Trash Film By Stanley,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,2282,"['recently', 'rented', 'PROTECTING', 'THE', 'KING', 'public', 'library', 'watched', 'was', 'sad', 'reflect', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'viewing', 'trash', 'film', 'course', 'writer', 'director', 'D.', 'Edward', 'David', 'Stanley', 'was', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'tour', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'have', 'read', 'good', 'deal', 'Elvis', 'movie', 'not', 'jive', 'well', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'think', 'PROTECTING', 'THE', 'KING', 'best', 'negative', 'exaggeration', 'what', 'happened', 'worst', 'outright', 'fabrications', 'Regardless', 'how', 'true', 'movie', 'very', 'unbalanced', 'view', 'almost', 'bad', 'stuff', 'Elvis', 'entourage', 'Elvis', 'look', 'pretty', 'bad', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'know', 'distorted', 'view', 'reality.In', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'David', 'Stanley', 'Elvis', 'step-brother', 'Elvis', 'father', 'Vernon', 'married', 'Dee', 'Stanley', 'first', 'wife', 'Gladys', 'died', 'David', 'Stanley', 'well', 'known', 'making', 'false', 'allegations', 'Elvis', 'such', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'claimed', 'Elvis', 'was', 'regular', 'user', 'cocaine', 'claim', 'was', 'refuted', 'several', 'other', 'members', 'Elvis', 'entourage', 'one', 'point', 'Stanley', 'also', 'claimed', 'Elvis', 'committed', 'suicide', 'charge', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'Why', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'believe', 'PROTECTING', 'THE', 'KING', 'more', 'same', 'false', 'allegations', 'exaggerations.Also', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'movie', 'poorly', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'Elvis', 'never', 'named', 'film', 'always', 'referred', 'King', 'Boss', 'names', 'most', 'others', 'film', 'are', 'changed', 'Why', 'was', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'legal', 'aspects', 'situation', 'film', 'were', 'accurate', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'omit', 'change', 'names', 'Did', 'Stanley', 'fear', 'being', 'sued', 'making', 'false', 'allegations', 'people', 'Especially', ""'re"", 'Elvis', 'fan', 'would', 'NOT', 'recommend', 'watch', 'PROTECTING', 'THE', 'KING', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'angered', 'was', 'mean', 'like', 'knowing', 'good', 'bad', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'falsehoods', 'exaggerations', 'such', 'most', 'likely', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'see', 'again', 'fine', 'concert', 'documentariesElvis', 'Way', 'Is', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Tour']",Protecting the King

1091629,A21VCAQLN2YFLU,B000TME1AY,"Bo Duke--The Elvis Presley Fan ""Jedi Master""","[11, 14]","As a fan of Elvis Presley's for more than 20 years I have seen and heard a lot about Elvis Presley from people who knew him, claimed to know him, etc. Yes, David Stanley (using the name D. Edward Stanley to direct this garbage, probably doesn't want anyone to know it's garbage) was his step-brother, until Vernon divorced his mother in the early or mid-1970s, why didn't he mention Elvis by name? He also did no justice to Elvis, his memory or his legacy. Upon watching this ""movie"", and I use the term ""movie"" loosely I noticed, and at first, and wondered who ""Frank"", ""Jeff"" and, I believe, ""Darrell"" are that worked for Elvis. Then I realized it was Red West, his cousin Sonny West and Joe Esposito. Must have been some reason, legal or otherwise, that the names were changed. He (D. Edward Stanley) had Elvis portrayed improperly. The hair was too short, the sideburns weren't correct either, what about the weight gain Elvis went through during the last 5 years of his life. Also, his eyes were blue not brown. Thanks for making a rotten ""movie"" that does only you justice David. It should have been titled the ""David (D. Edward Stanley) Stanley Story"", it would have sold or rented fewer copies than it did. It went on about David this or David that more often than I can remember. It made him, the ""star"" of the ""movie"", David Stanley appear to be a jerk. The key word in my last sentence is appear, I do not know D. Edward Stanley and do not wish to pass judgement on him, just stating an opinion. What about the rest of the world that has plenty of Elvis fans, like me, that deserve to know what was really happening? I must say the only good scene in the ""movie"" came when Red West (given a different name here) punched David Stanley in the face. Too bad ""the Boss"" made him apologize for it. From the way it looked they (the ones called ""Jeff"" and ""Frank"") appear to hate, despise and basically want to beat the you-know-what out of David Stanley (D. Edward Stanley) for a good portion of the ""movie"". It's a shame they didn't, must have been afraid of what ""The Boss"" (I thought Bruce Springsteen was ""The Boss"" and Elvis ""The King"" or am I the only that notices this?) would do to them (fire them?). If all the people who knew Elvis from Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana, through the musicians that played with him during the 1960s and 1970s and any family members and friends got together and tried to put out a movie all together, it probably would NEVER be made. The actors in this ""movie"" should never admit to it. The worst ""movie"" ever made about Elvis Presley in any way, shape or form. You'd be better off watching Elvis That's The Way It Is (this really is a movie!), at least it is more about Elvis and true to life at that point.MY RECOMMENDATION AND IN MY OPINION: don't even rent this ""movie"" it's just a plain old piece of junk not worth the time. Too bad I can't get all my money back (tax included). Thank goodness FYE bought it and, as far as I know, can't sell it as a ""used"" dvd. Well, I lost $10.86 and about an hour and a half.",1,"This alleged ""movie"" is about David Stanley  and it STINKS!!!",1192665600,"10 18, 2007",2007,3059,"['fan', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'more', '20', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'heard', 'lot', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'claimed', 'know', 'etc', 'Yes', 'David', 'Stanley', 'using', 'name', 'D.', 'Edward', 'Stanley', 'direct', 'garbage', 'probably', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'know', 'garbage', 'was', 'step-brother', 'Vernon', 'divorced', 'mother', 'early', 'mid-1970s', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Elvis', 'name', 'also', 'did', 'justice', 'Elvis', 'memory', 'legacy', 'watching', 'movie', 'use', 'term', 'movie', 'loosely', 'noticed', 'first', 'wondered', 'who', 'Frank', 'Jeff', 'believe', 'Darrell', 'are', 'worked', 'Elvis', 'Then', 'realized', 'was', 'Red', 'West', 'cousin', 'Sonny', 'West', 'Joe', 'Esposito', 'Must', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'legal', 'otherwise', 'names', 'were', 'changed', 'D.', 'Edward', 'Stanley', 'had', 'Elvis', 'portrayed', 'improperly', 'hair', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'sideburns', 'were', ""n't"", 'correct', 'either', 'what', 'weight', 'gain', 'Elvis', 'went', 'last', '5', 'years', 'life', 'Also', 'eyes', 'were', 'blue', 'not', 'brown', 'Thanks', 'making', 'rotten', 'movie', 'only', 'justice', 'David', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'David', 'D.', 'Edward', 'Stanley', 'Stanley', 'Story', 'would', 'have', 'sold', 'rented', 'fewer', 'copies', 'did', 'went', 'David', 'David', 'more', 'often', 'can', 'remember', 'made', 'star', 'movie', 'David', 'Stanley', 'appear', 'be', 'jerk', 'key', 'word', 'last', 'sentence', 'appear', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'D.', 'Edward', 'Stanley', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'pass', 'judgement', 'just', 'stating', 'opinion', 'What', 'rest', 'world', 'plenty', 'Elvis', 'fans', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'must', 'say', 'only', 'good', 'scene', 'movie', 'came', 'when', 'Red', 'West', 'given', 'different', 'name', 'here', 'punched', 'David', 'Stanley', 'face', 'Too', 'bad', 'Boss', 'made', 'apologize', 'way', 'looked', 'ones', 'called', 'Jeff', 'Frank', 'appear', 'hate', 'despise', 'basically', 'want', 'beat', 'you-know-what', 'David', 'Stanley', 'D.', 'Edward', 'Stanley', 'good', 'portion', 'movie', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'must', 'have', 'been', 'afraid', 'what', 'Boss', 'thought', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'was', 'Boss', 'Elvis', 'King', 'am', 'only', 'would', 'do', 'fire', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Elvis', 'Scotty', 'Moore', 'D.J', 'Fontana', 'musicians', 'played', '1960s', '1970s', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'got', 'together', 'tried', 'put', 'out', 'movie', 'together', 'probably', 'would', 'NEVER', 'be', 'made', 'actors', 'movie', 'should', 'never', 'admit', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'way', 'shape', 'form', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'Elvis', 'Way', 'really', 'movie', 'least', 'more', 'Elvis', 'true', 'life', 'point.MY', 'RECOMMENDATION', 'AND', 'IN', 'MY', 'OPINION', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'rent', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'piece', 'junk', 'not', 'time', 'Too', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'money', 'back', 'tax', 'included', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'FYE', 'bought', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sell', 'used', 'dvd', 'Well', 'lost', '10.86', 'hour', 'half']",Protecting the King
