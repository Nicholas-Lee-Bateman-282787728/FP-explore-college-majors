E Jackson,"[2, 3]","I had NO idea Death at a Funeral would be so extremely hilarious!The trick that makes the storyline so irresistibly funny is the way there's literally 6 or 7 mini stories involving each member of the family, and each plot twist gradually evolves into something *else* that's just as equally outrageous and unbelievable.  The entire setting takes place around the funeral home of the father.Clever writing at its very finest.  Supposedly this was either influenced by -or is an exclusive American version- of the British comedy of the same name, but I'm not positively sure about that since I never watched the British one.The acting by everyone is phenomenal, the storytelling is just fantastic in my eyes, and the humor is nonstop and quite often crude.  I really can't believe the number of negative reviews floating around the internet.  What's up with that?  Death at a Funeral is truly a one of a kind style of comedic gold.Here, let me give you a small slice of what makes it so hysterical.  Keeping in mind the entire film centers around a funeral, one person is on drugs and becomes an embarrassment to everyone around him, the father is constantly obnoxious and blunt, and there's constant verbal assaults among the family members at every turn.  It seems nobody in the family even likes one another.It's a great movie if you ask me.  One of the funniest I've seen in a very long time.  Much of the humor comes in the way of paying extremely close attention to every single detail so you don't accidentally overlook any subtle jokes that may have slipped through the cracks because, trust me on this one, there's *many* jokes.  In fact I actually need to see the movie again to hear the ones I probably missed.I highly recommend everyone watch it.

1253150,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00275EHHS,Chris Pandolfi,"[10, 13]","It seems like only yesterday I was giving a passing grade to ""Death at a Funeral,"" the 2007 British farce from director Frank Oz. Amazing, how quickly a remake can come along. What's even more amazing is that, despite being virtually the exact same film, this new 2010 version is even funnier. It is, in fact, the funniest film I've seen since ""Get Smart."" Before, the premise was crazy, but now, it reaches levels of insanity that I simply could not ignore. Oh, I tried to tell myself that I'm an adult now, that I'm too old to laugh at any of this, that I'm supposed to be out of my dirty jokes phase. But on this particular trip to the theater, I felt very immature indeed. Essentially, I let my guard down and just allowed myself to enjoy what I was watching.You see, I normally wouldn't be amused by the sight of an old man sitting on a toilet and doing his business while someone else's hand is pinned underneath the seat. And usually, I would find the ... aftermath of this scene disgusting, cheap, lowbrow, and needlessly vulgar. But boy, how I laughed. Sometimes, it's nice to stop being a critic and allow yourself to take pleasure in what you're viewing.Perhaps it helps that it features a great variety of stars, all of whom are naturally funny. At the center of it all is Chris Rock, who successfully balances the screenplay's use of slapstick comedy, witty dialogue, and quiet interludes, the latter surprisingly rich, if ultimately brief. He plays Aaron, who seems to have the weight of the world on his shoulders now that his father is dead and everyone is gathering at his home for the funeral. His wife, Michelle (Regina Hall), wants to get pregnant -- on the day of the funeral. His mother (Loretta Devine) says nothing kind to Michelle and clearly favors her other son, a successful but financially irresponsible writer named Ryan (Martin Lawrence), who hasn't lived up to his end of the deal when it comes to paying for the funeral. Aaron, jealous because of his own failed writing ambitions, is continuously reminded that Ryan was expected to give the eulogy, not him.Before long, he's approached by a dwarf named Frank (Peter Dinklage, reprising his role from the 2007 film). He has numerous pictures that prove he had been ... very, very close with Aaron's father. Unless he receives $30,000 in compensation, he will expose his secret to the rest of the family.Other zany subplots are woven throughout the story, including the dead man's niece, Elaine (Zoe Saldana), having to get a handle on her boyfriend, Oscar (James Marsden), who mistook a hallucinogen for a valium and is now wreaking havoc all over the house. At the same time, she has to contend with her disapproving father (Ron Glass) and her ex-boyfriend, Derek (Luke Wilson), who seems incapable of taking no for an answer. We also meet the crotchety Uncle Russell (Danny Glover) and a family friend, Norman (Tracy Morgan), who Uncle Russell hates for no apparent reason. In one form or another, both find themselves drawn into the rapidly escalating Frank fiasco.The director is Neil LaBute, whose film and stage work has been defined by unflinching depictions of human behavior (I exempt his remake of ""The Wicker Man,"" a truly awful movie). Remember his previous film, ""Lakeview Terrace""? Aside from being a genuinely thrilling ride, it was also one of the most intelligent, complex, and honest examinations of prejudice and relationships of recent memory. ""Death at a Funeral"" is certainly much different in tone, but it still benefits from LaBute's affinity for strong characters and themes. Yes, they're all greatly exaggerated, but not so much that we don't see some degree of truth in them; we believe in the reality of Aaron's personal and financial woes, we understand his wife's persistence, and we can sympathize with anyone who has had to deal with an Uncle Russell. As they say, there's one in every family.I was also impressed with the quality of the performances, especially Marsden's; it's one thing to act like you're under the influence, but it's quite another thing to keep that act consistently interesting, and to make sure there's still a personality underneath it all. He manages this, making him not only funny, but engaging as well. Also of note is Danny Glover, who isn't given much screen time but definitely knows how to make the most of what little he has. He's over the top, but that's okay because, given the screwball nature of the plot, subtlety would not have been appropriate. I noted back in 2007 that the ""fun"" had been put back into ""funeral."" It seemed all right to say it then, but now I realize that I should have reserved it for this version.

This film was insane, hilarious, and a whole lot of fun!We've got Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Luke Wilson, Tracy Morgan, Danny Glover, Zoe Saldana, James Marsden, Keith David, Loretta Devine and Regina Hall, all packed into a movie that essentially takes place within one central location. What's not to like?If that's not sufficient enough for you, then throw in someone else incredible and who I have pegged to win the first Oscar for a littler person - Peter Dinklage. You may not know him by name, but he's every bit as talented as those previously mentioned.Chris Rock stars as Aaron and he is having a really bad day. His father has died and all he wants to do is just get through the funeral and move on with his life. When he realizes that the funeral recession personnel have somehow `misplaced' his father's body and were in an attempt to unintentionally bury the wrong man - naturally a slight case of panic sets in. This is just one of many events that will go awry on this painful day.When Aaron's brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence) shows up at the funeral, he heaps on feelings of insecurity and aggression to Aaron's already in the slumps mood. This stems largely from the fact that Ryan has been a much more successful writer; so much in fact that their family often seems to forget that Aaron is a writer as well.To make matters worse, Aaron's wife is on his case about something personal; his mother is in hysterics with dealing with the death of Aaron's father; and pretty much everyone else that attends, has their own personality disorders and or bad timing mishaps that fuel to the comedic fire of this film.But none of these situations stand up to the one that an outsider brings with him. A mysterious man named Frank (Peter Dinklage) has a painful case of blackmail that will surely tarnish his father's name, lined up for Aaron on this of all days.As humorous as all of these events were, the one that took the cake for me, and everyone else in the theater I shared the viewing with, was the performance of James Marsden. He plays Oscar and is brought to the funeral by his girlfriend Elaine (Zoe Saldana) and has yet to meet her father, who will also be at the funeral. When Elaine accidentally gives Oscar the wrong medication due to a mix-up from her brother - Oscar will be appearing at the last rites in a somewhat `less than sober' fashion.Marsden's portrayal of a man battling the demon of an unwanted high, while trying to make an impression on his lover's family, was classic and will have you puking your guts out with laughter. I haven't laughed this hard since The Hangover.I have no idea how he was able to muster up some of the facial expressions that he does, but he did and God bless him for it. There is almost nothing as humorous as watching someone unable to control themselves at a time that calls for them to be on their best behavior. Marsden's demonstration is among the best of such that you will find in any cinematic recording to date.It's a screw-ball comedy at times, for sure. But it is cleverly written and directed. Director Neil LaBute steps away from his last two top notch thrillers (The Wicker Man (2006) and Lakeview Terrace) and gets back into comedy. His forte is dark comedy; having previously directed Nurse Betty and Your Friends & Neighbors, it's clear he knows exactly what he's doing.The film is well acted by all of its huge hitters as well. Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence and Tracey Morgan are three of the best in comedy and we see new sides to all three of them here.And of course, James Marsden will blow you away. It's perfect that his character's name is Oscar, because he's just as worthy of an Oscar Nomination as Robert Downey Jr. was in Tropic Thunder. Comedy requires talent too, sometimes even more-so than drama, and Death at a Funeral showcases that beautifully, several times over.",4,Death at a Funeral Review,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,4379,"['DEATH', 'AT', 'A', 'FUNERALSTARRING', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Keith', 'David', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'Regine', 'NehyWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Dean', 'CraigDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Neil', 'LaButeRated', 'RGenre', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '17', 'April', '2010Review', 'Date', '25', 'May', '2010I', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'original', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'released', '2007', 'hearing', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'year', 'Death', 'Funeral', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'checking', 'out', 'soon', 'film', 'was', 'insane', 'hilarious', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Keith', 'David', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'packed', 'movie', 'essentially', 'place', 'one', 'central', 'location', 'What', 'not', 'like', 'not', 'sufficient', 'enough', 'then', 'throw', 'someone', 'else', 'incredible', 'who', 'have', 'pegged', 'win', 'first', 'Oscar', 'littler', 'person', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'name', 'bit', 'as', 'talented', 'previously', 'mentioned.Chris', 'Rock', 'stars', 'Aaron', 'having', 'really', 'bad', 'day', 'father', 'died', 'do', 'just', 'get', 'funeral', 'move', 'life', 'When', 'funeral', 'recession', 'personnel', 'have', 'somehow', 'misplaced', 'father', 'body', 'were', 'attempt', 'unintentionally', 'bury', 'wrong', 'man', 'naturally', 'slight', 'case', 'panic', 'sets', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'events', 'will', 'go', 'awry', 'painful', 'day.When', 'Aaron', 'brother', 'Ryan', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'up', 'funeral', 'feelings', 'insecurity', 'aggression', 'Aaron', 'already', 'slumps', 'mood', 'largely', 'fact', 'Ryan', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'writer', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'family', 'often', 'forget', 'Aaron', 'writer', 'well.To', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Aaron', 'wife', 'case', 'something', 'personal', 'mother', 'hysterics', 'dealing', 'death', 'Aaron', 'father', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'attends', 'own', 'personality', 'disorders', 'bad', 'timing', 'mishaps', 'fuel', 'comedic', 'fire', 'film.But', 'none', 'situations', 'stand', 'up', 'one', 'outsider', 'mysterious', 'man', 'named', 'Frank', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'painful', 'case', 'blackmail', 'will', 'surely', 'tarnish', 'father', 'name', 'lined', 'up', 'Aaron', 'days.As', 'humorous', 'events', 'were', 'one', 'took', 'cake', 'everyone', 'else', 'theater', 'shared', 'viewing', 'was', 'performance', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Oscar', 'brought', 'funeral', 'girlfriend', 'Elaine', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'yet', 'meet', 'father', 'who', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'funeral', 'When', 'Elaine', 'accidentally', 'Oscar', 'wrong', 'medication', 'due', 'mix-up', 'brother', 'Oscar', 'will', 'be', 'appearing', 'last', 'rites', 'somewhat', 'less', 'sober', 'fashion.Marsden', 'portrayal', 'man', 'battling', 'demon', 'unwanted', 'high', 'trying', 'make', 'impression', 'lover', 'family', 'was', 'classic', 'will', 'have', 'puking', 'guts', 'out', 'laughter', 'have', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'hard', 'Hangover.I', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'muster', 'up', 'facial', 'expressions', 'did', 'God', 'bless', 'almost', 'nothing', 'as', 'humorous', 'watching', 'someone', 'unable', 'control', 'time', 'be', 'best', 'behavior', 'Marsden', 'demonstration', 'best', 'such', 'will', 'find', 'cinematic', 'recording', 'date.It', 'screw-ball', 'comedy', 'times', 'sure', 'cleverly', 'written', 'directed', 'Director', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'away', 'last', 'two', 'top', 'notch', 'thrillers', 'Wicker', 'Man', '2006', 'Lakeview', 'Terrace', 'back', 'comedy', 'forte', 'dark', 'comedy', 'having', 'previously', 'directed', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'Your', 'Friends', 'Neighbors', 'clear', 'exactly', 'what', 'doing.The', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'huge', 'hitters', 'as', 'well', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Tracey', 'Morgan', 'are', 'three', 'best', 'comedy', 'see', 'new', 'sides', 'three', 'here.And', 'course', 'James', 'Marsden', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'perfect', 'character', 'name', 'Oscar', 'just', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'was', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'Comedy', 'talent', 'too', 'sometimes', 'even', 'more-so', 'drama', 'Death', 'Funeral', 'showcases', 'beautifully', 'several', 'times']",N/A

1253157,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00275EHHS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","A gut-bursting, laugh-out loud comedy.  If you are in the mood for a fun and entertaining film, definitely check out ""Death at a Funeral""!In 2007, director Frank Oz and screenwriter Dean Craig were responsible for the critically acclaimed British black comedy film ""Death at a Funeral"".In 2009, producer/actor/comedian Chris Rock along with director Neil LaBute (""The Wicker Man"", ""Nurse Betty"", ""Lakeview Terrace"") and original screenwriter for the British comedy Dean Craig went to work on an American adaptation of the film.  And in 2010, the film was released in theaters and made over $48 million in the box office.VIDEO:""Death at a Funeral"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Another excellent HD release from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.  There is a lot of detail in this film, some details...some people may feel it's a bit too detailed (ie. the poop scene).  But there is a lot of detail in this Blu-ray release, from the skin pigments on the actors, the detail on the coffin and overall surroundings, the vibrant colors with the reds/browns indoors to the colors outdoors, blacks are nice and deep, there is a good amount of grain that can be seen in the film and I saw no DNR or compression artifacts.Picture quality is absolutely solid for this release!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Death at a Funeral"" is featured in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish/English (Audio Description Track) Dolby Digital 5.1.  Aside from the music shown at the opening and ending credits, ""Death at a Funeral"" is a dialogue-driven film that is mostly front and center channel driven.  There really wasn't anything that stood out, audio-wise especially for the surround channels.  If anything, it's all about the dialogue and the dialogue on the lossless soundtrack is crystal clear.  I detected no hiss or any audio problems while watching the film.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Death at a Funeral"" comes with the following special features (in standard and high definition, English stereo and with English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles):* movieIQ(tm)+sync and BD-Live connect you to real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the movie!* Commentary with Director Neil LaBute and Chris Rock - Very informative commentary by Director Neil LaBute and producer/actor Chris Rock.  LaBute and Rock break down the scene and gives us detail on the making of the film, working with various talent, Michael Jackson references and more.* Deleted Scenes - (7:13) Featuring eight deleted scenes from the film.* Gag Reel - (2:37) The outtakes from the film.* Death at a Funeral: Last Rites, Dark Secrets - (20:11) The cast and the producers talk about remaking the popular British comedy for an American audience.  The cast talk about working with other cast members and working with director Nick LaBute.* Family Album - (10:59) The cast talk about their characters and their relation to other characters in the film.* Death For Real - (5:55) The cast of the film talk about funerals and death.JUDGMENT CALL:Typically, when a popular foreign film receives its adaptation for the US, there are drastic changes.  So, bad are the changes, most of the time we ask why these films bother being remade.  But with ""Death of a Funeral"", it's a remake that works and for some, it may prove to be much better than the original.Aside from the obvious difference of the film spotlighting a Black family in mourning, the film still manages to capture the essence of the original but also making the humor much more accessible for American audiences.  For its main storyline, both director LaBute and Chris Rock has said that they kept true to the original without many storyline changes.With that being said, it's understandable if people are wondering why there was a remake of a perfectly well-done British film for the US.  And the answer is that although there are a good number of us who will seek out films from the UK and also from other countries, the majority of Americans will not.  I can easily remember the same argument being made when BBC America's ""Coupling"" and ""The Office"" was going to receive its US adaptation and many felt these remakes were pointless.  And we are seeing it today with fans wondering why there will be an American remake of the show ""The Vicar of Dibley"".  It's understandable why these passionate fans of the British comedies were crying foul of why the US needed to do in their words ""another pointless remake"".  While the American version of ""The Coupling"" fizzled, the American version of ""The Office"" evolved into something different from the original British series and became a highly-rated television hit.So, here we are with a 2010 remake of the popular 2007 film and yes...the original version is a fantastic film but I've gone past the ""Why do we need a remake?"" phase after seeing what has happened with American adaptations of Japanese and Korean horror or dramatic films.  And I've read enough message postings by fans of the original ""Death at the Funeral"" panning this American version.  But keeping an opening mind and watching this film, I can easily say that I found the 2010 version of ""Death at a Funeral"" to be a film that is capable of gut-bursting, laugh-out loud moments.I remember reading Roger Ebert's review of the film and saying that he laughed all the way through the film (and he also enjoyed the original) and I have to agree.  I came in to this film with low expectations because I enjoyed the original but while watching the film, I couldn't stop laughing and I had the feeling the American humor and the crazy antics that take place in the film would go well with the audience.The fact is that many of us have experienced funerals and how tense they are.  But when things go wrong, it's like a trainwreck that you just can't keep your eyes off of it.  In this case, seeing this family having to go through crazy and embarrassing situations from the moment Aaron (Chris Rock) opens the casket to find a deceased Asian man, you can't help but laugh and know that you are in for a wild ride.  But as much as I love Chris Rock's comedy, his character was the most subdued as he is the man who must stay in control.  It's the other supporting talent around him who shine on screen and this cast did a pretty good job.From Aaron's wife Michelle wanting to have sex quickly in order to get pregnant an hour or so before the actual funeral, Aaron's brother Ryan trying to be suave and cool despite having problems in his personal life but then you have the extended family with Elaine and her new boyfriend Oscar.  Personally, this is one role in which I never expected James Marsden to play (as the accidentally drugged out boyfriend), let alone be naked in front of so many people (according to Marsden, he was gullible and forgot to ask for a closed set and thus, he was nude in front of hundreds of people during the shooting of his nude scene) and you know when you see Oscar show up onscreen, you know that nothing but trouble will be happening.  It's one thing to know that you will be getting laughs from Rock, Lawrence and Morgan but I wasn't expecting to laugh so much during Marsden's appearances in the film.And then there is Tracy Morgan who improvised a lot of his scenes and the things that come out of his mouth is just crazy and hilarious.  Yes, he comes up with crazy, yet stupid dialogue but it works with the character quite effectively.  Especially the interaction between Morgan's character Norman and the crotchety Uncle Russell, which Danny Glover does a great job playing that role.  And the bathroom scene is just a gross but crazy scene that got me laughing and feeling gross about the scene all at once.And then you have the appearance of Frank (the gay lover of Aaron's father), played by Peter Dinklage who was in the original film.  Who is definitely much more hilarious this time around.  Overall, you have a solid cast in the 2010 version of ""Death at a Funeral"".  Everyone played their parts exceptionally well and you can't help but laugh!One thing where Ebert hit it right square on the nail in his review was his comment, ""British actors are rightly known for their skill, and there were some good ones in the 2007 version of the same Dean Craig screenplay. But playing proper upper-crust characters tends to restrain them. The family in ""Death at Funeral"" is obviously wealthy, but loose-more human. Their emotions are closer to the surface, and these actors work together like a stock company.""I happen to agree.  With American audiences, people relate to characters like them and in this case, these are not upper-class characters.  You have Aaron worrying about the financial situation of paying for the funeral (which many American families have to face) and each of these talents work quite well with each other and as Chris Rock has mentioned in one of the featurettes, it was important for him to hire a director that he could trust for the film and director Nick Labute did a good job in making a film for the American audience.  And the fact that you had the original writer for the British film, Dean Craig, involved is a major plus.As for the Blu-ray release, ""Death at a Funeral"" has a pretty solid commentary by director LaBute and Chris Rock and also a good number of short featurettes interviewing the cast about their characters and working with each other.  Also, this Blu-ray release is consistent with a lot of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment releases of awesome PQ, solid blacks and no video anomalies.  This is a solid film featuring wonderful picture quality, the film is not exactly the kind of film you would be hearing major utilization of the surround channels but dialogue is absolutely clear and understandable.Overall, ""Death at a Funeral"" is one of those films that you love for its embarrassing and crude humor but also I can understand if fans of the original have a hard time accepting this new film because of how different it is and the feeling that there is no reason for a audiences to watch a remake.  But having said I enjoyed the original a lot, having watched ""Death at a Funeral"" (201o) was such a fun and entertaining experience, I felt that I was laughing out loud throughout the film and that's a good thing.A gut-bursting, embarrassing, laugh-out loud comedy.

Their father has died, which unites the family for the funeral, and things go awry at every turn.Also included in the cast is Luke Wilson, Tracy Morgan, Danny Glover, James Marsden, Zoe Saldana, and Peter Dinklage, who reprises his role from the original film. To me, much like another recent comedy (Date Night), the script is so-so (written by Dean Craig, who wrote the original), but the cast elevates the material into something enjoyable and fun.Like I say, the film is not great, and there was one scene in particular involving Danny Glover's character that I found to be far too crude and tasteless.

1253177,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00275EHHS,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","In a world that is inundated with remakes it would seem strange that someone would choose to remake a movie that is only four years old. And yet that is what DEATH AT A FUNERAL is, a remake of a recent film. And while the original film, a British picture that has gathered somewhat of a cult following but never box office success, was hilarious it seems as though this remake has gone and upped the ante. Yes, while I loved the original, I thought this movie was much funnier.The story revolves around the funeral of Edward (Bob Minor), a man with two sons, held in his home by his request. The first, Aaron (Chris Rock), has stayed in the family home with his wife helping his father and mother. The second, Ryan (Martin Lawrence) is the favored son, the author that has found great success and moved on with his life. Except that in reality he's broke leaving Aaron the tab for the entire event.As the story begins, Aaron and his wife (Regina Hall) are now planning on moving on with their lives, finding a place of their own and starting a family. We also discover that Aaron has hopes of being an author as well, though he's yet to finish his book and had it published. Ryan is such the well known wordsmith that it seems everyone can't understand why Aaron, the elder of the two, is delivering the eulogy instead.Around these two focal points is a cast big enough that this could be better termed an ensemble piece. There is Norman (Tracy Morgan) and his friend Derek (Luke Wilson) who are in charge of picking up Uncle Russell (Danny Glover), a mean old coot if there ever was one. Derek is going to the funeral with the hopes of rekindling a romance with Elaine (Zoe Saldana) who is about to announce her engagement to Oscar (James Marsden). Elaine and Oscar stop off to pick up her brother Jeff (Columbus Short), a med student who's made some hallucinogenic pills for a friend and placed them in a bottle marked valium...which Zoe gives to Oscar to calm him before telling her father (Ron Glass) about the engagement. You see? Plenty of people with plenty of problems going on here, most of them happening before the funeral begins.But that's not all. At the funeral Aaron notices a small man, a dwarf actually, that he doesn't recognize. Introducing himself as Frank (Peter Dinklage, replaying his role from the original film), he finally gets a chance to speak with Aaron alone. It turns out that Frank has a secret he shares with Aaron that only makes matters worse.And as if that weren't enough, Oscar is acting more peculiar than one would think. Jeff's drugs have him seeing a world of green, the casket move during the service and more that eventually lead him to the roof of the house...naked.In other words, a day when everything should be proper, Aaron finds his life turned upside down. While he wanted everything to be just as it should to pay respects to his father, nothing is as it seems and nothing goes right. With the exception of a ton of laughs.The movie takes what should be a somber occasion and changes it into a comedy of errors, one leading to another, with characters playing off each other like a pinball hitting bumpers. The stories have their own focus yet connect with one another from start to finish.Each and every actor involved here does a fantastic job. But where most would say you couldn't single out one performance over another, I have to say that Marsden is by far the funniest person in this film filled with comedians. His Oscar, totally flipped out on an acid type pill, does the most absurd and hilarious things. Each time the movie flips back to his situation, all you can do is laugh.Many remakes try to reinvent the original film and make it better, more often than not failing miserably.

I liked it, but I liked this remake even better. While the scenarios are almost identical, the cultural differences between the two families made them feel like completely different films.  It was a stroke of genius on the part of director Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men,Lakeview Terrace, and the unfortunate remake ofThe Wicker Man), to recast Peter Dinklage as the uninvited guest with a secret, but otherwise to make the grieving families quite different.The original worked due to a delicate blend of deadpan delivery and madcap farce - deadpan and madcap being the dominant modes of British comedy - but with the emphasis on deadpan.  Here the emphasis is on madcap, especially in the performance of Tracy Morgan, but it still manages to feel like a plausible depiction of a real-to-life family, and never quite goes to ridiculous.  In both, the humor comes mostly from a tension between the expectations of dignity and decorum at a funeral and the increasingly undignified activities of its participants: drug-crazed hallucinations, sibling rivalry, sex-craziness and jealousy, secretive revelations, blackmail, and possibly even murder.  Here, though, I just thought it was simply more funny.  While I grinned watching the first one, I laughed out loud with this version.  Danny Glover was delightful as a mad-as-hell uncle; Chris Rock played the straight man, the put-upon and under appreciated son of the deceased; Martin Lawrence played perfectly the cocky and successful writer come home; Tracy Morgan plays the pratfall guy and takes some hilarious crap in this film; and Zoe Saldana as the niece of the deceased and James Marsden as her tripped-out fiance round out the mix.  It's a terrific ensemble cast, and Neil LaBute times it all perfectly, managing to make perfectly clear what's going on when and where in what might have been a much more chaotic mixture with a less competent director at the helm.

1253196,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00275EHHS,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Death At A Funeral is a remake of a 2007 British comedy by the same name, and is usually not the type of film I go for. For starters, I hate Chris Rock, and I really couldn't see a film about a funeral being all that funny. The previews were a riot and I love Martin Lawrence, so I decide to give it a try and was once again was taught that you can't judge a book by it's cover. This film turned out to be one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. It's a solemn day for Aaron and Brian, as they prepare to lay their father to rest. They expect it to be a small, simple ceremony, but they are soon reminded of why their family only gets together at weddings and funerals. A series of unbelievable and hysterical events keep disrupting the service, which include, but are not limited to, a gay midget, a guest tripping on acid, and a crotchety old man that really has to poop. I'm not surprised that I liked this film as much as I did, but I was surprised by the reasons why I liked it. You'd think an R rated film staring Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence would be raunchy as hell and way over the top, and it was, but not because of either of them. Rock and Lawrence were actually fairly toned down in this film and it was the large cast of supporting characters who really make the film. Danny Glover is amazing as Uncle Russell, an old timer who hates everyone and isn't afraid to run his mouth. James Marsden is equally as good, as the hated white boy friend, who takes what he thinks is Valium to calm down before the service. Death At A Funeral is absolutely hysterical and full of non-stop ridiculousness, if this film doesn't make you laugh, there is most definitely something wrong with you.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,1700,"['Death', 'A', 'Funeral', 'remake', '2007', 'British', 'comedy', 'same', 'name', 'usually', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'go', 'starters', 'hate', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'funeral', 'being', 'funny', 'previews', 'were', 'riot', 'love', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'decide', 'give', 'try', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'taught', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'solemn', 'day', 'Aaron', 'Brian', 'prepare', 'lay', 'father', 'rest', 'expect', 'be', 'small', 'simple', 'ceremony', 'are', 'soon', 'reminded', 'why', 'family', 'only', 'together', 'weddings', 'funerals', 'series', 'unbelievable', 'hysterical', 'events', 'keep', 'disrupting', 'service', 'include', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'gay', 'midget', 'guest', 'tripping', 'acid', 'crotchety', 'old', 'man', 'really', 'poop', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'liked', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'was', 'surprised', 'reasons', 'why', 'liked', ""'d"", 'think', 'R', 'rated', 'film', 'staring', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'would', 'be', 'raunchy', 'hell', 'way', 'top', 'was', 'not', 'Rock', 'Lawrence', 'were', 'actually', 'fairly', 'toned', 'down', 'film', 'was', 'large', 'cast', 'supporting', 'characters', 'who', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'amazing', 'Uncle', 'Russell', 'old', 'timer', 'who', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'run', 'mouth', 'James', 'Marsden', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'hated', 'white', 'boy', 'friend', 'who', 'what', 'Valium', 'calm', 'down', 'service', 'Death', 'A', 'Funeral', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'full', 'non-stop', 'ridiculousness', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'laugh', 'most', 'definitely', 'something', 'wrong']",N/A

The problem is that everything isn't easily managed, and all of the things that Aaron wishes would go away seem to follow him to that funeral. And perhaps that is symbolic in some ways; he gets to say some things he normally wouldn't say to people like his brother, to Peter Dinklage and to the relationship he and his father had, to his uncle and cousin, his wife, and so many others. Still, things ar enot that easily buried - and these few hours are some that Aaron probably wishes he could fast-foward over and then some.Death at a Funeral starts out really funny and, in a lot of places, it has some really good stuff. Chris Rock is funny and he delivers when you expect him. I was concerned about this at first, hoping I didn't get a CB-4 showing out of this - and I didn't, thank you! It even has some body humor that is even funny when you have Danny Glover doing it, and that really surprised me - I LOATHE that type of humor. to go along with the actor's and the things they accomplish, I also liked the stuff Peter Dinklage did and how he showed the diversity he has that goes from The Station Agent to the comedy front. Martin is also funny as Chris Rock's writer/brother, and then the extended family adds to the equation.The one thing that REALLy hurt this movie is one joke that keeps running and that really, really, really bothered me. It happens as one of our main attendees is about to leave and meet people that don't all approve of his relationship (the father-in-law isn't proud of the whiteboy his daughter brought home, basically). He's nervous and she gives him what she thinks is a sedative, hoping to calm his nerves. The only problem is that it is some super LSD concoction AND it really gets the mental ball rolling. HAd this been a small part of the script, i might have like this gag. The problem here was that it keeps on going on, and finishes off with at least 15 minutes movie time. That's a lot of time to spend on sometihng like that, and it hurts the script so, so much.I would have given the movie a 5 but I can't because of that part. I think it deserves a 4, howeve,r because certain parts simply come at you and are funny. Comedy is not a genre i like too much, liking my comedy darker and more chainsawical, but this sturck me as good. Still, the body humor joke definately makes it not for everyone - and possibly not for the weak of stomach.",4,How Many Dead Men Does it take to (fill in your joke ending here)?,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,2472,"['Aaron', 'father', 'dies', 'pick', 'up', 'everything', 'try', 'puut', 'together', 'problem', 'everything', ""n't"", 'easily', 'managed', 'things', 'Aaron', 'wishes', 'would', 'go', 'away', 'seem', 'follow', 'funeral', 'perhaps', 'symbolic', 'ways', 'say', 'things', 'normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'people', 'brother', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'relationship', 'father', 'had', 'uncle', 'cousin', 'wife', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'Still', 'things', 'ar', 'enot', 'easily', 'buried', 'few', 'hours', 'are', 'Aaron', 'probably', 'could', 'fast-foward', 'then', 'some.Death', 'Funeral', 'out', 'really', 'funny', 'lot', 'places', 'really', 'good', 'stuff', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'funny', 'when', 'expect', 'was', 'concerned', 'first', 'hoping', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'CB-4', 'showing', 'did', ""n't"", 'thank', 'even', 'body', 'humor', 'even', 'funny', 'when', 'have', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'doing', 'really', 'surprised', 'LOATHE', 'type', 'humor', 'go', 'along', 'actor', 'things', 'accomplish', 'also', 'liked', 'stuff', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'did', 'how', 'showed', 'diversity', 'Station', 'Agent', 'comedy', 'front', 'Martin', 'also', 'funny', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'writer/brother', 'then', 'extended', 'family', 'equation.The', 'one', 'thing', 'REALLy', 'hurt', 'movie', 'one', 'joke', 'running', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'bothered', 'one', 'main', 'attendees', 'leave', 'meet', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'approve', 'relationship', 'father-in-law', ""n't"", 'proud', 'whiteboy', 'daughter', 'brought', 'home', 'basically', 'nervous', 'what', 'sedative', 'hoping', 'calm', 'nerves', 'only', 'problem', 'super', 'LSD', 'concoction', 'really', 'mental', 'ball', 'rolling', 'HAd', 'been', 'small', 'part', 'script', 'i', 'might', 'have', 'gag', 'problem', 'here', 'was', 'going', 'finishes', 'off', 'least', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'time', 'lot', 'time', 'spend', 'sometihng', 'script', 'so', 'much.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '5', 'ca', ""n't"", 'because', 'part', 'think', '4', 'howeve', 'r', 'certain', 'parts', 'simply', 'come', 'are', 'funny', 'Comedy', 'not', 'genre', 'i', 'too', 'much', 'liking', 'comedy', 'darker', 'more', 'chainsawical', 'good', 'Still', 'body', 'humor', 'joke', 'definately', 'not', 'everyone', 'possibly', 'not', 'weak', 'stomach']",N/A
