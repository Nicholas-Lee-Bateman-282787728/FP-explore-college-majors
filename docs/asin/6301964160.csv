275634,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,6301964160,Chris Kennison,"[5, 8]","The only thing rising with THE RISE OF TAJ is the number of people who are unwilling to pay money to see movies at the theatre, or buy DVDs.I wasted $3.75 renting the thing.VAN WILDER 2: THE RISE OF TAJ is a movie that has every silly cliche that every college movie has ever used. The nerds. The frat. The competition. The frat guys girl. The nerd with the super wanger. I have never in my life rolled my eyes at a film so much. The lines are corny, poorly written, predictable and poorly executed. I didn't laugh once in the whole film.Kal Penn, who plays Taj Mahal Badalandabad has actually been pretty funny in some other movies, but in this, his comedic execution is destroyed by either a poor director or a poor script. Not to mention, for an indian guy, his indian accent is terrible. It comes and goes and in some scenes it's heavier than others.The only redeeming quality to the entire movie is a collection of attractive women, including Lauren Cohan, who hopefully can bounce back and have a career.The real shame is HOW THIS MOVIE EVEN GOT THE GREENLIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE!! I've seen dozens of comedies written by unknown writers who are getting walked over and forgotten because they don't have the connections, and dozens of movies like this get made every year. It's disheartening.Ultimately, Hollywood is killing themselves by making 50 comedies like this a year, and actually only one or two are any good. Makes you not want to even bother paying to see movies anymore. They just use recycled plots and recycled scenarios and put them to lousy scripts and then stick an UNRATED on the box, hoping all the teeny-boppers will salivate. Don't.

275636,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,6301964160,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 0]","National Lampoon, or more specifically post-1990 National Lampoon, is usually synonymous with 'crap'.  Therefore, any post-1990 movie associated with the name is treated with the lowest of expectations.  Somehow I guess my low expectations were exceeded, or maybe the planets were aligned or I went crazy, because ""Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj"" wasn't that horrible.  A post-1990 National Lampoon movie...not that bad?  Bizarre.  To be fair, the first ""Van Wilder"" wasn't bad either, but since this is the ""Short Circuit 2"" of sequels (considering both movies had the main lead being replaced with Indian sidekicks), it could've gone downhill at the first minute.  But it does have a few pluses.Kal Penn as Taj Badagaddadavida is a pretty likable character.  He may not have the screen presence and confidence as Ryan Reynolds (at all), but unlike characters fromcertain Lampoon movies, he mostly cared about a ragtags group of losers instead of his groin.  The film does have are pretty competent characters as well, except for the outrageously racist and villainous upperclassman.  Plot-wise, it's like ""Animal House"" in Europe, where Taj was transferred to a prestigious British university, but then the rich upperclassjerks made him bunk on the House of scalawags and it's up to him to make the House cool and have his team rise up from the higher-ups in the form of a competition rally.  The losers consists of Harry Potter, a hooker, an Irish Stereotype, and a gamer who does and says nothing, and though cliche as they are, I got nothing against them.  They are concerned about their well-being and just wants to step-up instead of randomly going to parties and do stupid things; okay, Taj influenced them to eventually do those things, but they didn't fool themselves too much.  Taj also met a highly-acadmeic love-interest who doesn't appreciate his unorthodox ways of helping his peers, but quickly admires him; she was way too easy to fall for him after just one day and a field trip, but at least she tried to make herself interesting rather than another ditz or whiner.This is still a National Lampoon movie, so it does have all the annoying vulgar elements like a guy sitting on poo, dog 'sauce' spewing on the audience, embarrassing sexual overtones, girls obsessed with the act of whoopee, and Balzac the Bulldog's trademark massive marbles.  Gross and humorless as they may be, at least the movie was tamed on these regards (although it might be due to watching the rated version).  Otherwise, I was pretty okay with ""Rise of Taj"".  It's an average underdog tale with little ill will to speak of.",3,Kumar Goes To England,1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,2612,"['National', 'Lampoon', 'more', 'specifically', 'post-1990', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'usually', 'synonymous', ""'crap"", 'Therefore', 'post-1990', 'movie', 'associated', 'name', 'treated', 'lowest', 'expectations', 'Somehow', 'guess', 'low', 'expectations', 'were', 'exceeded', 'maybe', 'planets', 'were', 'aligned', 'went', 'crazy', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Rise', 'Taj', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'post-1990', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'Bizarre', 'be', 'fair', 'first', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'Short', 'Circuit', '2', 'sequels', 'considering', 'movies', 'had', 'main', 'lead', 'being', 'replaced', 'Indian', 'sidekicks', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'downhill', 'first', 'minute', 'have', 'few', 'pluses.Kal', 'Penn', 'Taj', 'Badagaddadavida', 'pretty', 'likable', 'character', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'screen', 'presence', 'confidence', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'characters', 'fromcertain', 'Lampoon', 'movies', 'mostly', 'cared', 'ragtags', 'group', 'losers', 'instead', 'groin', 'film', 'have', 'are', 'pretty', 'competent', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'outrageously', 'racist', 'villainous', 'upperclassman', 'Plot-wise', 'Animal', 'House', 'Europe', 'where', 'Taj', 'was', 'transferred', 'prestigious', 'British', 'university', 'then', 'rich', 'upperclassjerks', 'made', 'bunk', 'House', 'scalawags', 'up', 'make', 'House', 'cool', 'have', 'team', 'rise', 'up', 'higher-ups', 'form', 'competition', 'rally', 'losers', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'hooker', 'Irish', 'Stereotype', 'gamer', 'who', 'nothing', 'though', 'cliche', 'are', 'got', 'nothing', 'are', 'concerned', 'well-being', 'just', 'step-up', 'instead', 'randomly', 'going', 'parties', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'Taj', 'influenced', 'eventually', 'do', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'fool', 'too', 'much', 'Taj', 'also', 'met', 'highly-acadmeic', 'love-interest', 'who', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'unorthodox', 'ways', 'helping', 'peers', 'quickly', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'fall', 'just', 'one', 'day', 'field', 'trip', 'least', 'tried', 'make', 'interesting', 'rather', 'ditz', 'whiner.This', 'still', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'movie', 'have', 'annoying', 'vulgar', 'elements', 'guy', 'sitting', 'poo', 'dog', 'spewing', 'audience', 'embarrassing', 'sexual', 'overtones', 'girls', 'obsessed', 'act', 'whoopee', 'Balzac', 'Bulldog', 'trademark', 'massive', 'marbles', 'Gross', 'humorless', 'may', 'be', 'least', 'movie', 'was', 'tamed', 'regards', 'might', 'be', 'due', 'watching', 'rated', 'version', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'pretty', 'okay', 'Rise', 'Taj', 'average', 'underdog', 'tale', 'little', 'ill', 'will', 'speak']",N/A

Van was one of the coolest people on campus and taught Taj everything he knew. This time Taj tackles his own journey in the United Kingdom. Upon arriving in the United Kingdom he looks to join one of the most prestigious fraternity. He is told that there was a ""typographical error"" and is told to go to The Barn. The Barn is where all the rejects are. Taj sees potential in these freaks and wants to makes something out of them. He tells them that they can even win the Hastings Cup if they try hard enough. The Hastings Cup is a challenge for all fraternities on campus to compete in. It is a series of academic, athletic, and recreational challenges. Taj and the barn make their own fraternity and join in the games.The first Van Wilder was much better. Taj was just too uninteresting to make an entire movie about.
