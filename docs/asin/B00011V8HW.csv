790668,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00011V8HW,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[71, 71]","Call it ""My Big Fat Italian Wedding,"" but with more love, bittersweetness, family feeling, and pastry. ""A Wedding for Bella"" or ""The Bread, My Sweet""  has a big heart, narrowly avoiding the oversweetness of such movies. It's a romantic comedy, a tragedy, and a warm tale about family.Domi (Scott Baio) is a corporate bigwig by day, but owns a bakery that he runs with his two brothers. He has also ""adopted"" an elderly Italian couple, the grumpy Massimo (John Seitz) and loving Bella (Rosemary Prinz). But one day Bella takes Domi to the hospital, revealing that she has terminal cancer. But she orders him not to tell anyone -- because ""I no gonna start dying until I'm ready."" But she obviously wishes she could see her wayward daughter Lucca (Kristin Minter) be married.So Domi quietly tries to contact Lucca, only to have her turn up at Christmas dinner. Within a day, he proposes to her -- just so Bella can see her daughter be married, even if he expects Lucca to go her own way once her mother is dead. Lucca and Domi start awkwardly getting to know one another, all the time hoping that Bella will live to see them wed.A lot of movies would have lapsed into silly cliches. But as someone of Italian ancestry, I can say honestly that a lot of Italians are like the people of this film: they ""got a scream,"" argue and insult, and yet they're generous and loving to everybody. And love food. Even the broken English Bella and Massimo speak never crosses the line into parody.But what makes ""A Wedding for Bella"" so enchanting is that it's not just about a wedding or romance. It's also about love and family, and about living your life to the fullest. It's impossible not to be moved as Bella states that she's going to keep living -- not just surviving -- for as long as possible, and tries to do that. And somehow, this movie manages to do it without sinking into sticky-sweetness.The story mainly focuses on the very weird courtship between Lucca and Domi, and again it manages not to be soppy or cliched -- one scene has them exchanging questionnaires and information. It's awkward, and it's supposed to be. But even with terminal illnesses and faux weddings, ""Wedding"" has comedy too, such as the three brothers and Massimo goofing around at the tux fitting.The star performance of this is undoubtedly Prinz as the dying Bella. She exudes warmth, kindness and a quiet strength. It's easy to see why everyone loves her. There are also stellar performances from Baio and Minter, who make the transition from self-arranged fiancees to lovers believable, and Seitz, who gives the crabby Massimo plenty of heart. And ""Van Helsing's"" Shuley Hensley gives the most underrated performance of the film as Domi's retarded brother, who loves Bella dearly.""A Wedding for Bella"" (""The Bread, My Sweet"") a story about celebrating life, and about love -- between lovers, spouses, and brothers.

790669,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00011V8HW,Grady Harp,"[6, 6]","A WEDDING FOR BELLA (aka THE BREAD, MY SWEET) is lovely little low budget film that demonstrates how tender the heart can be without the need for big time stars or production values. This film as directed by Melissa Martin reminds us that quiet slices of life in middle America have as much if not more cinematic validity that the big blockbusters.  Briefly, Dominic (a very fine Scott Baio!) and his two brothers are bakers and have adopted an older couple (Bella portrayed with understated simplicity and warmth by Rosemary Prinz and Massimo portrayed by John Seitz) as family.  Dominic wears two hats: he is a successful businessman in the mid Pittsburgh district but spends as much time with his brothers in the family bakery.  Dominic and Bella are especially close and when it is discovered that Bella has terminal cancer, Dominic sets out to find her 'estranged' daughter Lucca (Kristin Minter) who everybody thinks is an unloving carefree beatnik in Mexico.  Lucca arrives and with her comes the truth - that she graduated Law School with honors, was disillusioned, left Pittsburgh to be in the Peace Corps to help others, became disillusioned and ended up selling junk art to tourists in Mexico. Her reason for return is not in response to Dominic's pleas (she never got the messages), but to her own need to reunite with the mother whom she adores. Bella's secret wish is that Lucca be happily married and have children, but she also is a wise enough mother to know that her daughter must choose her own life.  Dominic decides that the thing that would make Bella happy before she succumbs to her cancer is for Dominic and Lucca to marry!  Their intentions thrill Bella and the 'extended family' all concentrate on the energies of wedding preparation to offset Bella's impending demise. The way this all plays out in the end is the meaningful part and to reveal that would not be fair.  Suffice it to say that the actors carry off multiple levels of interpersonal relationships, touching on the comedy, the tragedy and the warmth of these marvelous Italian American characters.  Yes, the film wears its heart on its sleeve, but who's to say that is wrong?

790671,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00011V8HW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Who would've thunk it, that Scott Baio had it in him to be so good? A WEDDING FOR BELLA features a Scott Baio who is ages removed from his TV heartthrob days of HAPPY DAYS and CHARLES IN CHARGE. Here, he plays Dominic Pyzola, a work-obsessed Italian-American holding down two contrasting gigs. By day, he's a merciless corporate executive, handling mergers and a cold-hearted ace at firing employees. Then he lets his hair down and toils at the biscotti bakery he runs jointly with his two brothers. The heart of the film lies in Dominic scheming to marry the wayward daughter of Bella, an elderly, terminally-ill woman who dwells above the bakery. Bella has been like a mother for the Pyzola boys, and her fondest wish has always been for her independent daughter to finally settle down and start a family. Dominic means to make Bella's wish come true, before she passes on.A WEDDING FOR BELLA is an unassuming little film with occasional eruptions of color and joviality. It steeps itself in expansive Italian-American culture, yet the characters are played by the actors with enough earnestness and sensitivity that they don't feel too much like caricatures. The film unveils quiet moments which impact on an emotional level and a romance which is lowkey and begins as a contrivance yet ends up being real enough. I thought Kristen Minter as Lucca, Bella's flighty, contrary daughter, was splendid, with wonderfully natural reactions. Rosemary Prinz plays Bella, who decides to live the ""six good months"" left her with grace and dignity. Prinz is well-cast in the role, although she does come off as too cloying at times. But it was actually a heartrending moment when, after weeks and weeks of cheerfully toughing it out, Bella at last voices her agony. The supporting cast is laudable, especially Shuler Hensley as Pino, the half-witted brother, and John Seitz as Massimo, the half-crazed husband.It's a simple story, with a plot gimmick which stretches credibility some. So credit Scott Baio with underplaying his character to very good effect, as he makes Dominic's crazy scheme actually seem realistic and workable. And, while a weepy, sad, and bittersweet drama, there's still room here for humorous moments, mostly brought about by the three brothers interacting and by the antics of Massimo, who is a great gruff man.A WEDDING FOR BELLA isn't a glossy, big budget production. It even seems amateurish, at times. Yet it has a way of eliciting quiet tears and contemplative silences. Even the ""big"" moments are arrived at without flourish. When Dominic proposes to Lucca, as family members look on, there isn't a grand, rousing speech. The speech he makes is simple and direct, and the question is bluntly proposed. The whole thing is actually a bit awkward, which to me makes it more endearing. A WEDDING FOR BELLA triumphs in its celebration of family ties and a steadfast clinging to ethnic roots. And in Bella's gradual yet defiant decline, it manages to be quietly life-affirming. So, no, A WEDDING FOR BELLA isn't a glossy, big budget production. It's a good movie, though.",4,"Of a life told in mere months' passing, of a wish granted and something about pistachios, and a wedding for Bella",1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,3088,"['Who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thunk', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'had', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'WEDDING', 'FOR', 'BELLA', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'who', 'ages', 'removed', 'TV', 'heartthrob', 'days', 'HAPPY', 'DAYS', 'CHARLES', 'IN', 'CHARGE', 'Here', 'Dominic', 'Pyzola', 'work-obsessed', 'Italian-American', 'holding', 'down', 'two', 'contrasting', 'gigs', 'day', 'merciless', 'corporate', 'executive', 'handling', 'mergers', 'cold-hearted', 'ace', 'firing', 'employees', 'Then', 'hair', 'down', 'toils', 'biscotti', 'bakery', 'jointly', 'two', 'brothers', 'heart', 'film', 'Dominic', 'scheming', 'marry', 'wayward', 'daughter', 'Bella', 'elderly', 'terminally-ill', 'woman', 'who', 'bakery', 'Bella', 'been', 'mother', 'Pyzola', 'boys', 'fondest', 'wish', 'always', 'been', 'independent', 'daughter', 'finally', 'settle', 'down', 'start', 'family', 'Dominic', 'make', 'Bella', 'wish', 'come', 'true', 'on.A', 'WEDDING', 'FOR', 'BELLA', 'unassuming', 'little', 'film', 'occasional', 'eruptions', 'color', 'joviality', 'expansive', 'Italian-American', 'culture', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'actors', 'enough', 'earnestness', 'sensitivity', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'caricatures', 'film', 'unveils', 'quiet', 'moments', 'impact', 'emotional', 'level', 'romance', 'lowkey', 'contrivance', 'yet', 'up', 'being', 'real', 'enough', 'thought', 'Kristen', 'Minter', 'Lucca', 'Bella', 'flighty', 'contrary', 'daughter', 'was', 'splendid', 'wonderfully', 'natural', 'reactions', 'Rosemary', 'Prinz', 'Bella', 'who', 'live', 'six', 'good', 'months', 'left', 'grace', 'dignity', 'Prinz', 'well-cast', 'role', 'come', 'off', 'too', 'cloying', 'times', 'was', 'actually', 'heartrending', 'moment', 'when', 'weeks', 'weeks', 'cheerfully', 'toughing', 'out', 'Bella', 'last', 'voices', 'agony', 'supporting', 'cast', 'laudable', 'especially', 'Shuler', 'Hensley', 'Pino', 'half-witted', 'brother', 'John', 'Seitz', 'Massimo', 'half-crazed', 'husband.It', 'simple', 'story', 'plot', 'gimmick', 'credibility', 'credit', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'underplaying', 'character', 'very', 'good', 'effect', 'Dominic', 'crazy', 'scheme', 'actually', 'seem', 'realistic', 'workable', 'weepy', 'sad', 'bittersweet', 'drama', 'still', 'room', 'here', 'humorous', 'moments', 'mostly', 'brought', 'about', 'three', 'brothers', 'interacting', 'antics', 'Massimo', 'who', 'great', 'gruff', 'man.A', 'WEDDING', 'FOR', 'BELLA', ""n't"", 'glossy', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'even', 'amateurish', 'times', 'way', 'eliciting', 'quiet', 'tears', 'contemplative', 'silences', 'Even', 'big', 'moments', 'are', 'arrived', 'flourish', 'When', 'Dominic', 'proposes', 'Lucca', 'family', 'members', 'look', ""n't"", 'grand', 'rousing', 'speech', 'speech', 'simple', 'direct', 'question', 'bluntly', 'proposed', 'whole', 'thing', 'actually', 'bit', 'awkward', 'more', 'endearing', 'WEDDING', 'FOR', 'BELLA', 'triumphs', 'celebration', 'family', 'ties', 'steadfast', 'clinging', 'ethnic', 'roots', 'Bella', 'gradual', 'yet', 'defiant', 'decline', 'be', 'quietly', 'life-affirming', 'So', 'WEDDING', 'FOR', 'BELLA', ""n't"", 'glossy', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'good', 'movie', 'though']","A Wedding for Bella aka The Bread, My Sweet"
