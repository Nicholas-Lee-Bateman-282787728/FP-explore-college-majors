Walken is reduced to a silly bum and hardly has any screen time. He was so wicked and charismatic in the first two.

The editing is bad, the story is confusing and not even worth our attention and people come and go like an all night bus stop. What was even stupidier that all that was the goth-inspired angel that is the bad guy in here. I was really trembling in my pants as I saw him, gheeze.

474426,A141HP4LYPWMSR,6305732388,Brian E. Erland,"[1, 3]","And so after three movies the 'Second War in Heaven' saga finally comes to a conclusion. Thank God! [get it, thank God]. It appears that the amazingly original concept and dark, cutting edge humor that generated the masterpiece 'The Prophecy' and an admirable follow-up in 'The Prophecy II' eventually ran out of ideas and what little was left became the disappointing 'Prophecy 3.'The once formidable fallen Archangel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) introduced in the first feature film, the one with a gaze so terrifying your heart stopped everytime he appeared on screen, wasn't even a shadow of his former self by the third film. Now lowered to the status of mere mortal poor Gabriel seems to have lost not only his angelic powers, but his once sharp wit and laserlike tongue as well. His remarks are now trite, whimsical and all but senile in nature. My how the mighty have fallen.Unfortunately the storyline doesn't fair much better. What began as a potentially good film simply failed to deliver the apocalytic climax promised. The offspring of the mortal woman and angel from 'The Prophecy II' is now grown. His name is Danyael (Dave Buzzotta) and he is a Nephilim, part angel and part human, chosen by God to bring an end to the rebellion. The time of the end is drawing near and Pyriel, the Angel of Genocide is coming to destroy the human race. As you probably already guessed by now the task of facing and defeating Pyriel has fallen to Danyael.Positives: Even though this isn't Walken at his best he still makes it worth watching. The special effects surrounding the coming of Pyriel are rather well done and Danyael's girlfriend Maggie (Kayren Ann Butler) is quite attractive.If you're a fan of 'The Prophecy' and a complusive completist as I am I guess you'll have to buy the DVD.",3,"""My Kingdom For A Straight Answer""  ~  And A Better Ending",1130716800,"10 31, 2005",2005,1792,"['so', 'three', 'movies', ""'Second"", 'War', 'Heaven', 'saga', 'finally', 'conclusion', 'Thank', 'God', '[', 'get', 'thank', 'God', ']', 'amazingly', 'original', 'concept', 'dark', 'cutting', 'edge', 'humor', 'generated', 'masterpiece', 'Prophecy', 'admirable', 'follow-up', ""'The"", 'Prophecy', 'II', 'eventually', 'ran', 'ideas', 'what', 'little', 'was', 'left', 'became', 'disappointing', '3', ""'The"", 'once', 'formidable', 'fallen', 'Archangel', 'Gabriel', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'introduced', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'one', 'gaze', 'so', 'terrifying', 'heart', 'stopped', 'everytime', 'appeared', 'screen', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'third', 'film', 'Now', 'lowered', 'status', 'mere', 'mortal', 'poor', 'Gabriel', 'have', 'lost', 'not', 'only', 'angelic', 'powers', 'once', 'sharp', 'wit', 'laserlike', 'tongue', 'well', 'remarks', 'are', 'now', 'trite', 'whimsical', 'senile', 'nature', 'My', 'how', 'mighty', 'have', 'fallen.Unfortunately', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'fair', 'much', 'better', 'What', 'began', 'potentially', 'good', 'film', 'simply', 'failed', 'deliver', 'apocalytic', 'climax', 'promised', 'offspring', 'mortal', 'woman', 'angel', ""'The"", 'Prophecy', 'II', 'now', 'grown', 'name', 'Danyael', 'Dave', 'Buzzotta', 'Nephilim', 'part', 'angel', 'part', 'human', 'chosen', 'God', 'bring', 'end', 'rebellion', 'time', 'end', 'drawing', 'Pyriel', 'Angel', 'Genocide', 'coming', 'destroy', 'human', 'race', 'probably', 'already', 'guessed', 'now', 'task', 'facing', 'defeating', 'Pyriel', 'fallen', 'Danyael.Positives', 'Even', ""n't"", 'Walken', 'best', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'special', 'effects', 'surrounding', 'coming', 'Pyriel', 'are', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'Danyael', 'girlfriend', 'Maggie', 'Kayren', 'Ann', 'Butler', 'quite', ""'re"", 'fan', ""'The"", 'Prophecy', 'complusive', 'completist', 'am', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'buy', 'DVD']",Prophecy 3: Ascent VHS

474428,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,6305732388,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","THE PROPHECY trilogy reaches its thrilling climax in THE PROPHECY 3: THE ASCENT! Danyael, the half-human son of an angel, has been chosen as mankind's only hope against the coming of the Second God, Pyriel, the Angel of Genocide. With his powers revoked, the arch-angel Gabriel is left to sit idly by and watch as the world dies... That is, unless he is able to help Danyael fulfill his destiny and stop the approaching apocalypse! THE PROPHECY 3 draws the characters and events from the first two films together for a fitting conclusion as Patrick Lussier ups the ante with more exciting action and gripping suspense. The grand scope of the picture is achieved on a much smaller scale, delivering all of the same terrifying imagery and dread at a fraction of the cost. Dave Buzzotta gives a strong performance as the lost prophet Danyael, who is struggling to find purpose after learning of his own immortality. Vincent Spano's overblown theatrics can be forgiven considering his role as the angelic assassin, Zophael, while Christopher Walken is far more reserved now that his wings have literally been clipped. The crowning moments are rightfully achieved in Danyael's final confrontation with the sinister Pyriel, as well as in the notable cameos made by the previous players in the series (Gabriel's stop at an all-too-familiar diner is particularly entertaining).-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,The Prophecy 3,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1400,"['PROPHECY', 'trilogy', 'thrilling', 'climax', 'THE', 'PROPHECY', '3', 'ASCENT', 'Danyael', 'half-human', 'son', 'angel', 'been', 'chosen', 'mankind', 'only', 'hope', 'coming', 'Second', 'God', 'Pyriel', 'Angel', 'Genocide', 'powers', 'revoked', 'arch-angel', 'Gabriel', 'left', 'sit', 'idly', 'watch', 'world', 'able', 'help', 'Danyael', 'fulfill', 'destiny', 'stop', 'approaching', 'apocalypse', 'THE', 'PROPHECY', '3', 'characters', 'events', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'together', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'Patrick', 'Lussier', 'ante', 'more', 'exciting', 'action', 'gripping', 'suspense', 'grand', 'scope', 'picture', 'achieved', 'much', 'smaller', 'scale', 'delivering', 'same', 'terrifying', 'imagery', 'dread', 'fraction', 'cost', 'Dave', 'Buzzotta', 'strong', 'performance', 'lost', 'prophet', 'Danyael', 'who', 'struggling', 'find', 'purpose', 'learning', 'own', 'immortality', 'Vincent', 'Spano', 'overblown', 'theatrics', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'considering', 'role', 'angelic', 'assassin', 'Zophael', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'far', 'more', 'reserved', 'now', 'wings', 'have', 'literally', 'been', 'clipped', 'crowning', 'moments', 'are', 'rightfully', 'achieved', 'Danyael', 'final', 'confrontation', 'sinister', 'Pyriel', 'as', 'well', 'notable', 'cameos', 'made', 'previous', 'players', 'series', 'Gabriel', 'stop', 'all-too-familiar', 'diner', 'particularly', 'entertaining', '.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Prophecy 3: Ascent VHS

I give it 2-3 stars for the one saving grace that is Christopher Walken. As the movie begins, we see that he has lost his grace (Punished) and is now human. He has to learn the things that normal people take for granted and is a bum. As his character, who is now acting as a good guy after learning the error of his ways, is a supporting role, by the end you are rooting for Gabriel.Ok, the bad. This was an aweful story, with aweful acting and why are the angels trying to be goth?! Someone said, Vincent Spano looked more like he needed some mousse and a hair dryer. I had to agree. He was not intimidating and not believable at all.The ultimate evil angel that is also being reborn (Pyriel) is a goth wannabe but in white. I agree with other reviewers that ""What was he waiting for? He was waiting for the one guy to come to his grave to be reborn?"" A fight occurs between Pyriel and the hero with a spear that the hero has taken from Vincent Spanno's character that is so unbelievably awefully designed, I just laughed every time I saw it used.If you are going to watch the trilogy, watch 1 and 2 and if you are bored and want to waste some time and finally see what the final outcome for Gabriel is, rent this.

A new dark angel named Pyriel, not satisfied with simply blocking humans from entering into Heaven decides to attempt to eradicate all humans.  To do this he has sent one of his followers to kill the Nephilim(a child born of a human and an angel), named Danyael.  Danyael is not aware of his destiny to be mankind's salvation from annihilation and opening up the gates of Heaven, and is gunned down before he can fully realize his potential.  However, Danyael is no mere mortal, as his self-appointed secret bodyguard, the fallen angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) had figured out years ago when he attempted to kill him before he was out of the womb.  Gabriel, who is now human after the events of ""The Prophecy 2"", discovers that Danyael has been resurrected and takes it upon himself to guide the boy in embracing his destiny to fight Pyriel and save humanity.This 3rd installment in the franchise was a great sequel and at the time a very satisfying ending to 'The Prophecy' saga.

474440,A82LIVYSX6WZ9,6305732388,Michael Bolts,"[0, 3]","the final chapter in The Prophecy series has Christopher Walken as the ex-angel Gabriel on the streets, with a trumpet. He goes and hears a young boy speak about God and the kid gets shot by some homeless looking guy played by Brad Dourif. This event brings upon the angel Zophael played nicely by Vincent Spano and Zophael has come to burn the body of the kid, or named Danyael Rosales. Rosales' mother Valerie died many a year ago in a fire accident. Danyael is half angel, half human, a Nephilim,  so he's sort of like for example Angel's son Connor in the Tv Show Angel, Sanyael has human and angel qualitites. Danyael's task is to defeat Pyriel and stop the war. It's another sequel but this is a two notches better then the second one. Walken has never been more funnier, Dourif is in another wasted role and Steve Hytner, who plays yet again the doctor Joseph is still the same.
