Kind of off to a vague start but eventually you'll see Hanna get her revenge on those who created her (I figured out that she was &#34;created&#34; before the movie got around to revealing that). Sometimes had its odd bits like Hanna and her friend kissing, and the unbelievable Internet search Hanna did (raised by &#34;father&#34; to get revenge but taught nothing of computers and web searching yet she does brilliantly anyway?) yet Saorise Ronan did an excellent job with what must've been a hard role to perform.I didn't like the way the viewer is just left hanging as to Hanna's future, the alternate ending in which she returns to her Arctic cabin home helped that only a little.It's worth watching, maybe Miss Ronan has a future in action roles.",4,Could have been better Saorise Ronan sure did her part,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,880,"['Not', 'best', 'films', 'lot', 'action', 'notable', 'teen', 'girl', 'being', 'lead', 'character', 'doing', 'most', 'action', 'Kind', 'off', 'vague', 'start', 'eventually', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Hanna', 'get', 'revenge', 'who', 'created', 'figured', 'out', 'was', '34', 'created', '34', 'movie', 'got', 'around', 'revealing', 'Sometimes', 'had', 'odd', 'bits', 'Hanna', 'friend', 'kissing', 'unbelievable', 'Internet', 'search', 'Hanna', 'did', 'raised', '34', 'father', '34', 'get', 'revenge', 'taught', 'nothing', 'computers', 'web', 'searching', 'yet', 'brilliantly', 'anyway', 'yet', 'Saorise', 'Ronan', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'what', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hard', 'role', 'perform.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'viewer', 'just', 'left', 'hanging', 'Hanna', 'future', 'alternate', 'ending', 'Arctic', 'cabin', 'home', 'helped', 'only', 'little.It', 'worth', 'watching', 'maybe', 'Miss', 'Ronan', 'future', 'action', 'roles']",N/A

1454152,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005CMSDKA,Andrew Ellington,"[10, 13]","There is so much about `Hanna' that shouldn't work, and yet it does; remarkably so.  The plot could have easily been clich&eacute;d and rather tired, and yet it feels youthful and modern.  The plot twists could have been predictable (and at times they are) and yet they feel necessary to the progression of the film.  There are depictions here that could have been deemed mere gimmick if handled poorly (especially the bookended scenes and specific phrasing) and yet they are dynamic in scope and wholly effective.There is so much `right' about this movie.`Hanna' tells of a young girl of sixteen who has been trained in isolation by her father to be an assassin.  She has trained her whole life to defend herself against the woman responsible for the death of her mother, the woman who would stop at nothing to end her life.  She has trained for the moment she would be ready to confront and kill this adversary.  When the film opens, Hanna is ready.  Once the switch is flipped (quite literally as well as figuratively) there is no turning back, and Hanna soon finds herself being sabotaged by an enemy smarter than she expected.A word of caution, `Hanna' is extremely violent, even for a PG-13.  The violence is also of a more disturbing nature, considering that the main proprietor of this violence is a young teenage girl.  To see Hanna snap a woman's neck and then shoot countless men in a single scene can be a bit much for some to watch.  The violence is never gory (although, the scene with the man hanging from the ceiling is a tad gruesome) but it is gratuitous and so one should be aware before committing to watching the film that it will be intense, and then some.For me, this film is the perfect amalgam of film arc-types.  It is an action film on the surface, a dramatic love story at the core and is beautifully glossed over with art house flare.I want Joe Wright to direct the next James Bond film.  I know that they decided to change directors with every new film because it adds a layer of individualism to each individual piece, but once Sam Mendes is done (another finely underrated director, so I'm pleased) can the reigns be handed over to Wright?  He shows such depth of cinematic viewpoint in `Hanna'.  The way he weaves emotional tones into the action, as well as the way he stages his scenes to play out like a beautiful painting; it's all so mesmerizing.  He captures action like a pro, but he never allows the action to take over the core themes of the film.  The score is to die for and the cinematography is delicious (especially that opening sequence).  Cate Blanchett may be a caricature, but she's an effective one.  Bana is superb (great accent work), I just wish he was used more.  I also loved seeing Tom Hollander (creepy, seductive, interesting) spice up the film, and young Jessica Barden is astonishingly effective as the `friend' Hanna develops in her travels.  She also has deft comedic timing, which is a raw asset she should cultivate.The girl is sharp.But there really is Saoirse Ronan, and no one else.  She is magnificent here.  Not only does she handle the physical aspect of the performance (the accent, the action scenes, the languages, the presence) but she captures the emotional trauma of the character as well.  She portrays such depth in her eyes, but she never betrays her character's innocence.  You never feel as though Hanna knows `too much', for she is always believably nave, but she manages to get a slick handle on her character's more advanced education, the harsher grasp on her `emotional makeup'.  You never doubt her killer instincts, and yet she really wins you over when she begins to understand love and friendship.I can't wait to see this girl's future!So, despite the thematic issues (more from a moral standpoint and an obvious personal reaction) this is a film I highly recommend.  It is styled perfectly, and yet the style never trumps substance.  This is a film you can drool over on all respects, for it is as visually stimulating as it is emotionally captivating.",5,An assault on all fronts...,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,4044,"['so', 'much', 'Hanna', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'yet', 'remarkably', 'so', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'rather', 'tired', 'yet', 'youthful', 'modern', 'plot', 'twists', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'predictable', 'times', 'are', 'yet', 'feel', 'necessary', 'progression', 'film', 'are', 'depictions', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'deemed', 'mere', 'gimmick', 'handled', 'poorly', 'especially', 'bookended', 'scenes', 'specific', 'phrasing', 'yet', 'are', 'dynamic', 'scope', 'wholly', 'so', 'much', 'right', 'movie.', 'Hanna', 'tells', 'young', 'girl', 'sixteen', 'who', 'been', 'trained', 'isolation', 'father', 'be', 'assassin', 'trained', 'whole', 'life', 'defend', 'woman', 'responsible', 'death', 'mother', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'stop', 'nothing', 'end', 'life', 'trained', 'moment', 'would', 'be', 'ready', 'confront', 'kill', 'adversary', 'When', 'film', 'Hanna', 'ready', 'switch', 'flipped', 'quite', 'literally', 'as', 'well', 'figuratively', 'turning', 'back', 'Hanna', 'soon', 'being', 'sabotaged', 'enemy', 'smarter', 'expected.A', 'word', 'caution', 'Hanna', 'extremely', 'violent', 'even', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'also', 'more', 'disturbing', 'nature', 'considering', 'main', 'proprietor', 'violence', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'see', 'Hanna', 'snap', 'woman', 'neck', 'then', 'shoot', 'countless', 'men', 'single', 'scene', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'watch', 'violence', 'never', 'gory', 'scene', 'man', 'hanging', 'ceiling', 'tad', 'gruesome', 'gratuitous', 'so', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'committing', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'intense', 'then', 'some.For', 'film', 'perfect', 'amalgam', 'film', 'arc-types', 'action', 'film', 'surface', 'dramatic', 'love', 'story', 'core', 'beautifully', 'glossed', 'over', 'art', 'house', 'flare.I', 'want', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'direct', 'next', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'know', 'decided', 'change', 'directors', 'new', 'film', 'layer', 'individualism', 'individual', 'piece', 'once', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'done', 'finely', 'underrated', 'director', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'can', 'reigns', 'be', 'handed', 'Wright', 'such', 'depth', 'cinematic', 'viewpoint', 'Hanna', 'way', 'emotional', 'tones', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'beautiful', 'painting', 'so', 'mesmerizing', 'action', 'pro', 'never', 'action', 'take', 'over', 'core', 'themes', 'film', 'score', 'die', 'cinematography', 'delicious', 'especially', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'may', 'be', 'caricature', 'effective', 'one', 'Bana', 'superb', 'great', 'accent', 'work', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'used', 'more', 'also', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'creepy', 'seductive', 'interesting', 'spice', 'up', 'film', 'young', 'Jessica', 'Barden', 'astonishingly', 'effective', 'friend', 'Hanna', 'travels', 'also', 'deft', 'comedic', 'timing', 'raw', 'asset', 'should', 'cultivate.The', 'girl', 'sharp.But', 'really', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'one', 'else', 'magnificent', 'here', 'Not', 'only', 'handle', 'physical', 'aspect', 'performance', 'accent', 'action', 'scenes', 'languages', 'presence', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'depth', 'eyes', 'never', 'character', 'innocence', 'never', 'feel', 'Hanna', 'too', 'much', 'always', 'believably', 'nave', 'get', 'slick', 'handle', 'character', 'more', 'advanced', 'education', 'harsher', 'grasp', 'emotional', 'makeup', 'never', 'doubt', 'killer', 'instincts', 'yet', 'really', 'over', 'when', 'understand', 'love', 'friendship.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'girl', 'future', 'So', 'thematic', 'issues', 'more', 'moral', 'standpoint', 'obvious', 'personal', 'reaction', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'styled', 'perfectly', 'yet', 'style', 'never', 'trumps', 'substance', 'film', 'can', 'drool', 'respects', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'emotionally', 'captivating']",N/A
1454153,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B005CMSDKA,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","Hanna is an interesting movie, the first thing you notice is that the movie is beautiful, every scene and location is shot with perfection and brilliance making this film a feat for the eyes. The stunning visuals draw the viewer into what is really a pretty weak story. Now the concept of Hanna is not bad, the movie is about a teenage girl who have lived her whole life in the woods with her father, learning to fight, to hunt and to survive. Hanna's only entertainment is a old lexicon and a picture book with fairytales. One day Hanna see a plane going by overhead and she decided that she want more than her life of isolation, her father agree but warn his daughter that there are people who will stop at nothing to see her dead, Hanna can rejoin society only if she manages to defeat and kill those that are after her.Now the above sounds like a pretty good concept for a movie, a young girl raised apart from modern civilization but trained as a soldier since she was a toddler have to fight a desperate struggle to take down the bad guys and rejoin her father. Well yes it is a decent premise, unfortunately this is all the movie is. While watching the film I was completely drawn in by the beauty of it, and by the character Hanna herself which really are fascinating, however at one point when there where only one sixth left of the movie I started wondering when the plot would start. Yes there is some science fiction elements here, it is clear from the start that Hanna is stronger, faster and smarter than your average human but the whole thing is never well though out, there are no plot twist just evil government agency want girl, girl run around and experiences a world she have never seen before and kill someone now and again while looking for her father, that is it.I still think Hanna is a good movie but it stands on it's visuals alone. I really do not get why some call it thought provoking, there is nothing here it is just your basic government experiments with making a super soldier, it go sour and now they are trying to cover it up kind of story, no twists no layers no nothing, and what I have just written is not even a spoiler, it is right there from the start, five minutes into the film you know what the entire movie is about.

1454157,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005CMSDKA,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Hanna is a slightly different spin concerning action storylines where the good guy has to run from the bad guy.  In this case the ""good guy"" is a powerful assassin who's actually a little blonde-haired girl.  She can kick butt and take no names, and even defeat upwards of 5 or 6 operatives at the same time who possess their own special abilities and gun-wielding ways.  With that said, this isn't *quite* a Matrix-style film.  It's close to it, however.Unfortunately there's two reasons I'm not particularly thrilled with the end result.  The first reason is that the beginning, at least the first 20 minutes, is quite confusing.  You're totally unsure what's going on- all you know is that a little girl is in the middle of a snowy forest and is an extraordinary fighter of sorts.  It's unclear what's going on until... well, without spoiling what happens, until she makes a critical, life-changing decision.  This *dramatically* changes the direction of the storyline and then begins to make perfect sense.The other reason this film is average at best is the fact that the little girl is supposed to be running from a group of operatives who try desperately to contain the girl but... a good chunk of the storytelling doesn't actually focus on the running but instead focuses on the girls friendship with another girl she meets out in the desert, and this takes up a really big chunk of the movie.  At least 45 minutes of it.  It's pretty excessive to me.However the 3 stars means I DID like Hanna overall.  The segments where Hanna unleashes her special butt-kicking talents on anyone she sees fit (and I mean *anyone*, haha) are easily the parts of the film that impress me the most.  It's not a gripping storyline by any means, and I'd say it's even lackluster for the most part, but at least the final 25 minutes is really suspenseful.  Oh and the description is actually correct.  It IS part adventure/part suspense.  This means kids might find it too violent, but the language is hardly ever extreme.  Not much (if any) swearing for example.Overall, had about 30 minutes of the film been trimmed I believe would have benefited the film.  I would have then given the movie a higher rating.",3,Hanna,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,2198,"['Hanna', 'slightly', 'different', 'spin', 'concerning', 'action', 'storylines', 'where', 'good', 'guy', 'run', 'bad', 'guy', 'case', 'good', 'guy', 'powerful', 'assassin', 'who', 'actually', 'little', 'blonde-haired', 'girl', 'can', 'kick', 'butt', 'take', 'names', 'even', 'defeat', 'upwards', '5', '6', 'operatives', 'same', 'time', 'who', 'possess', 'own', 'special', 'abilities', 'gun-wielding', 'ways', 'said', ""n't"", '*quite*', 'Matrix-style', 'film', 'close', 'however.Unfortunately', 'two', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'thrilled', 'end', 'result', 'first', 'reason', 'beginning', 'least', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'quite', 'confusing', ""'re"", 'totally', 'unsure', 'what', 'going', 'on-', 'know', 'little', 'girl', 'middle', 'snowy', 'forest', 'extraordinary', 'fighter', 'sorts', 'unclear', 'what', 'going', 'well', 'spoiling', 'what', 'critical', 'life-changing', 'decision', '*dramatically*', 'direction', 'storyline', 'then', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense.The', 'other', 'reason', 'film', 'average', 'best', 'fact', 'little', 'girl', 'supposed', 'be', 'running', 'group', 'operatives', 'who', 'try', 'desperately', 'contain', 'girl', 'good', 'chunk', 'storytelling', ""n't"", 'actually', 'focus', 'running', 'instead', 'focuses', 'girls', 'friendship', 'girl', 'out', 'desert', 'up', 'really', 'big', 'chunk', 'movie', 'least', '45', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'excessive', 'me.However', '3', 'stars', 'DID', 'Hanna', 'overall', 'segments', 'where', 'Hanna', 'special', 'butt-kicking', 'talents', 'anyone', 'fit', 'mean', '*anyone*', 'haha', 'are', 'easily', 'parts', 'film', 'impress', 'most', 'not', 'gripping', 'storyline', 'means', ""'d"", 'say', 'even', 'lackluster', 'most', 'part', 'least', 'final', '25', 'minutes', 'really', 'suspenseful', 'Oh', 'description', 'actually', 'correct', 'part', 'adventure/part', 'suspense', 'kids', 'might', 'find', 'too', 'violent', 'language', 'hardly', 'ever', 'extreme', 'Not', 'much', 'swearing', 'example.Overall', 'had', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'been', 'trimmed', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'then', 'given', 'movie', 'higher', 'rating']",N/A

Hollywood shows it's typical lack of fresh ideas.  Here's the plot, in a nutshell (Spoilers Ahead).  Hanna is the last of a genetically altered/engineered group of kids that were bred to be super soldiers.  Eric Bana, a former CIA agent, kidnaps her as an infant.  He raises her out in the wilderness and trains her to be the perfect assassin.  Her mission being to kill his former boss Marissa, played adeptly by Cate Blanchette.  She fails and thus begins a massive hunt, by the CIA, for Hanna and Eric Bana.  Sounds okay, but there are a lot of problems with the movie beyond the Blair Witch quality camera work.  First of all, every one of the pursuers of Hanna are totally incompetent. Marissa goes to some weird bar, with a shemale performer, to hire some mercenaries to hunt down Hanna. You get the impression that these are tough experienced assassins that will give Hanna and Erik a run for their money.  Wrong.  What you get are just some average weak goons that seem no better than 3rd rate mob henchmen.  They make Hanna more formidable mainly by making everyone chasing her totally inept.  In one scene, a bunch of CIA agents have Erik totally surrounded.  Instead of just shooting him, they decide to brawl with him one at a time.  He takes them down one by one, until the last guy decides to pull out a gun to try to shoot him, but he's quickly taken down with a throwing knife.  Apparently, only one of them had a gun.  You get a lot of that in the movie.  Another turn off is that everyone in the movie is a bad guy.  You really have no one to root for.  I suppose you could root for Hanna, but she's a remorseless brutal killer.  Also, every character in the movie is weird.  Hanna is naturally bizarre, but every person she ""befriends"" or comes across is a scatter brained weirdo.  The worse one is her newfound friend, Sophie, who is talking machine that wont stop.  In fact she has more lines in 10 minutes of screen time than Hanna, Erik and Marissa put together for the entire film.  I kept hoping that Hanna would kill her and spare the audience from further suffering.  Oh, well.  Suffice to say, the movie ends predictably with the ""showdown"" between Marissa and Hanna.  Since Marissa is basically a pencil pusher, it's a head scratcher trying to figure out just how she would think she would have a chance against a brilliant super assassin like Hanna.

Hanna is a very good movie filled with great action and good characterizations. You feel like you really get to know the people, a rarity in action films.Eric Bana raises Hanna in a remote area of Finland where he trains her to be a ninja warrior of the fiercest and quickest kind. He has her on the alert even while she is sleeping. She knows that her mother died, ""shot be three bullets"" but knows little else about her life. As she learns more about who she is and what she is, she begins an existential crisis.Eric Bana tells Hanna that when she is ready, she should press a button on the CB radio in their Finnish cottage and people will know where they are. It is then her responsibility to kill the woman played by Cate Blanchett or be killed by her. Hanna goes out on her own and has one adventure after another. They are poignant, heartwarming, adrenaline rushing, and edge of your seat action scenes. Hanna plays the part of a warrior/idiot savant brilliantly. She can recite facts about most anything but knows little or nothing about human emotion.Overall, I recommend the movie. I don't know the name of the actress who plays Hanna, but she is great.

1454168,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B005CMSDKA,Brian Driver,"[3, 4]",".NOTE:  THIS REVIEW HAS NO SPOILERS!As played by Saoirse Ronan, Hanna is an enigmatic killing machine who is as cold and barren as the arctic environment in which she is raised by her father, Erik Heller.  An ex-CIA operative himself, he's given her everything he can: martial arts training, encyclopedic knowledge, fluency in several languages, and most of all a place to hide away from the forces who have been looking for her all of her life, to (at best) study her, or to (at worst) kill her.She's had the option to leave her father's ""care"" ever since he deemed her ready: all she has to do is touch a button.  And as our movie just barely starts, she does--and we're in for a wild ride from here on in.You would be excused for thinking this is another in the ""Bourne"" sub-genre of movies: a highly trained but unknowing (i.e. ""innocent"") operative is left to fend for herself against the murderous intentions of equally skilled assassins gunning for her.  How many times have we seen this trope played out?I can't tell you that this one is truly different--to be sure, there ARE differences, and I think you'll discover them without my spoiling it for you here.  But what I did like was the concept that, for Hanna, almost EVERYTHING was a discovery: people, society, our cultures, and most of all music.  It was all new, all magnificent, but she was so inundated by it all that any one thing was hard to register.  Imagine being thrown into a blender and being told to pick out a chocolate chip...it's almost impossible.One thing she has to deal with, perhaps above all, is just who SHE is.  Hanna knows she's being hunted, and she has been trained for this.  But exactly why has never been appropriately spelled out.  And in this sense everyone is an enemy or at least a suspect, not the least of all those who are closest to her.""Hanna,"" is directed by Joe Wright, whose previous works--""Atonement,"" ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and ""The Soloist""--clue us in to the notion that there is going to have to be something sophisticated here.  Wright's works do not bespeak a director of action films.  But Wright does indeed do a great job of handling the quick cut/fast moving battle scenes, including one incredible continuous scene in which the camera follows Eric Bana (as Hanna's father Erik) as he exits a bus, travels through the station, along a street, down an escalator into a subway station and into an open area in which he is forced to battle four hired assassins--ALL IN ONE UNBROKEN SHOT!!  All of this while the camera literally swirls around him as he walks, descends, and fights; it's absolutely fluid, and absolutely amazing.What Wright brings to the film is an unspoken intelligence, a way of setting this action flick in a more intellectual plane.  I think it's possible to follow a metaphorical slant here, too:  the film has a depth to it that goes beyond bullets and knives.  Follow the line ""I just missed the heart,"" if you want a clue.What struck me about Hanna was how perfect the young actress playing her was.  Saoirse Ronan is extraordinary as the girl trained to be, well, extraordinary.  Her blonde hair, her pale Irish complexion...it all makes for a blank canvas as yet unwritten upon at the movie's start.  And, while she is this innocent young teenager, she is also a fearsome killing machine, more capable than anyone could know, except perhaps the father who trained her.Eric Bana deserves credit too in his role as the father.  He portrays a man who is torn by his duty as an ex-operative, and protecting the daughter he has, as well as the history, the fate, that is foisted upon her.But it is Cate Blanchett who really acts the hell out of her role.  She is a red-headed terror on two feet, alternately cold-blooded and yet strangely fashion conscious, cruel and fastidious.  But then again, the other killers we see are strange, too...very strange.  They make the particular sub-strata occupied by these horrendous beings one you would be quite obviously best to avoid, one where killing is merely a highly specialized job.I liked ""Hanna"" and recommend it.  There is certainly room for a sequel, and I would find it an interesting proposition.  What Hanna might become, given her shall we say unusual upbringing, would be anyone's guess.",4,"A Wild, Dark Tale",1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,4278,"['.NOTE', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'HAS', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', 'played', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'Hanna', 'enigmatic', 'killing', 'machine', 'who', 'cold', 'barren', 'arctic', 'environment', 'raised', 'father', 'Erik', 'Heller', 'ex-CIA', 'operative', 'given', 'everything', 'can', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'encyclopedic', 'knowledge', 'fluency', 'several', 'languages', 'most', 'place', 'hide', 'away', 'forces', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'life', 'best', 'study', 'worst', 'kill', 'her.She', 'had', 'option', 'leave', 'father', 'care', 'ever', 'deemed', 'ready', 'do', 'touch', 'button', 'movie', 'just', 'barely', ""'re"", 'wild', 'ride', 'here', 'in.You', 'would', 'be', 'excused', 'thinking', 'Bourne', 'sub-genre', 'movies', 'highly', 'trained', 'unknowing', 'i.e', 'innocent', 'operative', 'left', 'fend', 'murderous', 'intentions', 'equally', 'skilled', 'assassins', 'gunning', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'trope', 'played', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'one', 'truly', 'different', 'be', 'sure', 'ARE', 'differences', 'think', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'spoiling', 'here', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'concept', 'Hanna', 'almost', 'EVERYTHING', 'was', 'discovery', 'people', 'society', 'cultures', 'most', 'music', 'was', 'new', 'magnificent', 'was', 'so', 'inundated', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'hard', 'register', 'Imagine', 'being', 'thrown', 'blender', 'being', 'told', 'pick', 'out', 'chocolate', 'chip', 'almost', 'impossible.One', 'thing', 'deal', 'perhaps', 'just', 'who', 'SHE', 'Hanna', 'being', 'hunted', 'been', 'trained', 'exactly', 'why', 'never', 'been', 'appropriately', 'spelled', 'out', 'sense', 'everyone', 'enemy', 'least', 'suspect', 'not', 'least', 'who', 'are', 'closest', 'Hanna', 'directed', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'previous', 'works', 'Atonement', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Soloist', 'clue', 'notion', 'going', 'have', 'be', 'something', 'sophisticated', 'here', 'Wright', 'works', 'do', 'not', 'bespeak', 'director', 'action', 'films', 'Wright', 'indeed', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'handling', 'quick', 'cut/fast', 'moving', 'battle', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'incredible', 'continuous', 'scene', 'camera', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Hanna', 'father', 'Erik', 'bus', 'travels', 'station', 'street', 'down', 'escalator', 'subway', 'station', 'open', 'area', 'forced', 'battle', 'four', 'hired', 'assassins', 'IN', 'ONE', 'UNBROKEN', 'SHOT', 'camera', 'literally', 'swirls', 'around', 'descends', 'fights', 'absolutely', 'fluid', 'absolutely', 'Wright', 'film', 'unspoken', 'intelligence', 'way', 'setting', 'action', 'flick', 'more', 'intellectual', 'plane', 'think', 'possible', 'follow', 'metaphorical', 'slant', 'here', 'too', 'film', 'depth', 'bullets', 'knives', 'line', 'just', 'missed', 'heart', 'want', 'clue.What', 'struck', 'Hanna', 'was', 'how', 'perfect', 'young', 'actress', 'playing', 'was', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'extraordinary', 'girl', 'trained', 'be', 'well', 'extraordinary', 'blonde', 'hair', 'pale', 'Irish', 'complexion', 'blank', 'canvas', 'yet', 'unwritten', 'upon', 'movie', 'start', 'innocent', 'young', 'teenager', 'also', 'fearsome', 'killing', 'machine', 'more', 'capable', 'anyone', 'could', 'know', 'perhaps', 'father', 'who', 'trained', 'her.Eric', 'Bana', 'credit', 'too', 'role', 'father', 'man', 'who', 'torn', 'duty', 'ex-operative', 'protecting', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'history', 'fate', 'foisted', 'her.But', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'really', 'hell', 'role', 'red-headed', 'terror', 'two', 'feet', 'alternately', 'cold-blooded', 'yet', 'strangely', 'fashion', 'conscious', 'cruel', 'fastidious', 'then', 'again', 'other', 'killers', 'see', 'are', 'strange', 'too', 'very', 'strange', 'make', 'particular', 'sub-strata', 'occupied', 'horrendous', 'beings', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'obviously', 'best', 'avoid', 'one', 'where', 'killing', 'merely', 'highly', 'specialized', 'job.I', 'liked', 'Hanna', 'recommend', 'certainly', 'room', 'sequel', 'would', 'find', 'interesting', 'proposition', 'What', 'Hanna', 'might', 'become', 'given', 'shall', 'say', 'unusual', 'upbringing', 'would', 'be', 'anyone', 'guess']",N/A

1454179,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005CMSDKA,Chris Kennison,"[2, 9]","I was excited to see HANNAH the moment I saw the trailer and was intrigued by the storyline immediately. Then there was Saoirse Ronan (Hannah), who has been a great young star. Not to mention, Cate Blanchett (Marissa) gasping as she watches through the one-way window as it is implied that Hannah has just skillfully ended the life of a woman who was posing as Blanchett's character, Marissa. Then of course Eric Banna rounding out an already interesting cast. So, imagine my disappointment when I found out that HANNAH wouldn't be coming to a theatre near me. In fact, it didn't even come to my STATE!! So, I had had to wait for the video. It finally was available in my town and I rushed to rent it, in fact, I almost bought the thing before seeing it. I was THAT pumped.I'm glad I didn't buy it. Where do I start? The first thing that ruined the film for me was the overemphasis on artistic vision. Long drawn out shots and camera tricks and heartbeat sounds were all so overly done, I was rolling my eyes after about 25 minutes. All of this is signs of a Director who is trying way too hard to impress. Maybe that's because his first two films were highly praised and one, ATONEMENT, was showered with Oscars. The thing is, he didn't have to try so hard to impress. The story and the actors were good enough to do that, we didn't really have to have a camera that twisted completely 360 degrees while Hannah runs. Were we trying to cover up that most of the film is Hannah running? Maybe.The deep characters in HANNAH were never truly fleshed out. We could never actually say that we knew them. The camera spent the most time with HANNAH, and we sort of get to know her. Although, she is, believe it or not, the least interesting of the characters. She's basically a tool of her father. A killing machine, trained to right the wrongs and revenge the death of her mother, who she never met.Unfortunately for HANNAH, that is about as far as the depth goes in this movie. There are no twists and turns. There is running and there are sets that are so choreographed, I thought I was watching a Jackie Chan movie. Colorful duck boats lined in a row so that Hannah can jump across them. Did they have to be big obnoxious duck boats? Couldn't they be ordinary boats? Couldn't there have been a space between a couple of them so that she had to REALLY jump far to get across the water? Nope. Instead, as Hannah jumps, we spent the ten seconds looking at the boats, instead of focusing on Hannah.Not enough movie and too much director to enjoy this one. On every turn of this film, all I could think about was the Director's gimmicks instead of losing myself in the film. Director Joe Wright should have let the great actors he had tell the story, instead of wasting time with...

1454183,A3E8BTA2SXPV3P,B005CMSDKA,cinemagirl,"[0, 1]","The concept of the film is an exciting one: a 16-year-old assassin, &agrave; la Mathila from THE PROFESSIONAL (but intensified), is on the run from government agents, namely a slick CIA woman for as-of-yet unclear reasons. The visuals are sleek and even poetic, which sets this particular film apart from other thrillers.The set-up of the film raises an intriguing question. Will Hanna Heller (played by the magnificently sensitive Saoirse Ronan) decide to leave the nest of the forest in Finland in order to discover the world outside, in spite of the dangers that she is almost certain to encounter? This is a question encountered by many ""normal"" people on some level, and it is a particularly pertinent question, given this day and age (and economy).The main problem stems from the tone of the film. It is part LA FEMME NIKITA, part THE PROFESSIONAL, part RUN LOLA RUN, part THE BOURNE IDENTITY, part...HOME ALONE?The Grimms fairy tales are so important to the overall meaning of the film that it is set up in the first couple minutes, and Hanna even recites multiple times throughout that she has to meet her father (Eric Bana) at Wilhelm Grimm's house in Berlin. Unfortunately, the film's connection to the Grimms tales seems superficial at best, and it appears that the Brothers Grimm are mentioned purely so that there is an interesting-looking location for the climax (big fairy tale bed, faux candy, brightly-colored set decor in the aforementioned house).It seems incongruous that Hanna, who has been trained to the extent that even her father ambushes her in the middle of the night to test her (in fact to drill into her head that she is never safe, even while sleeping), would later freely confess her planned meeting place to her new friend Sophie. This, of course, could be attributed to Hanna's humanization, her opening up to the very first friend in her life, but given the caution shown beforehand to mold her into a callous fighting machine, this seems sloppy and lazy--just an easy means to allow the antagonists to find her in order to get to the climax.The minions Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett) employs to help find Hanna and her father are ludicrous and contribute largely to the film's downfall. Isaacs (Tom Hollander) is the main henchman, and he has a bad blond dye-job and dresses in different bright-colored jogging suits with his two dome-headed accomplices. One accomplice, by the way, is a tall wiry man who wears acid-wash skinny jeans with knee-high boots and a cropped nylon jacket.Yeah. Acid. Wash. Skinny. Jeans.There you go. They provide comic relief, but juxtapose any scenes with these henchmen with one of the most exciting scenes of the film: Hanna under surveillance by the CIA in a clinically sparse holding cell, reminiscent of something out of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE or SALT. So, these henchman are what Hanna, with all her back-breaking training and ability to beat up a team of grown men without blinking, is matched up against? They mirror the bad guys in HOME ALONE--Harry, the mastermind who is slightly less stupid than his partner and therefore leader, and of course Marv, the moron. In both these films, the idiotic antagonists are outsmarted by a fast kid. Except HOME ALONE is marketed as a comedy, so that works. One wonders why Wiegler, with all her purported acuity and resources at the CIA, couldn't come up with better henchmen than ones she picks up at a bar.Wiegler is simultaneously amazing and disappointing. With her sharply-tailored dress suits, cropped red hair, stark make-up, and expensive designer heels, Wiegler cuts an impressive figure as she gives orders at the CIA. She is clearly a powerful woman in charge, not afraid to screw on a silencer on a gun in order to kill--well, as it turns out, anybody. Though she appears as robotic as Hanna in the beginning, she reveals some concessions she has had to make in order to get to the top of the totem poll. When asked if she ever had children, Wiegler somberly responds, ""I made certain choices."" She is not simply the Evil Queen of the fairy tale, but had the film explored this aspect of her character a bit more, the ending (as it is, ridden with simple mistakes) would have been more satisfying.The family Hanna shacks up with is a touching bedrock of the film, particularly when Hanna witnesses the family bonding and kidding around in a way that she never got a chance to experience. Unfortunately, her friend Sophie's dialogue is comically stilted and extremely unrealistic (this works in a lot of films, but not this one). The highlight of the family is the young Aldo Maland, who plays Sophie's younger brother Miles. Though he's not in many scenes, he steals the ones he is in with his hilarious facial expressions and reactions to the actions of the confusing adult world around him.In the end, the climax of the film doesn't feel earned, simply because the story hasn't woven the Grimms allegory deep enough in order to justify the silly antagonists and out-of-the-ordinary tidbits. The setting screams, ""LOOK AT THE COOL ABANDONED AMUSEMENT PARK WITH THE BROKEN ELEPHANT! AND THE COOL GRIMM HOUSE! ISN'T THIS GIANT BED COOL? SEE? IT'S THE GRIMMS, YOU SEE...JUST LIKE IN THE BOOK HANNA READS WITH HER DAD!""Despite its flaws, the film is, however, worth watching just to see Saoirse Ronan handle a rare role like this. It is not every day that a filmmaker attempts to portray a 16-year-old character in such a complex and philosophical way. Ronan seems to handle every possible state director Joe Wright throws at her with ease--confusion, happiness, nervousness, anger, and freedom. Oh, and she kicks major ass, too, holding her own against men more than twice her age and size.",3,"Great Concept, Flawed Execution, Beautiful Cinematography.",1318896000,"10 18,

1454186,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B005CMSDKA,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 2]","What to make of Hanna Heller (Saoirse Ronan)? She's 16, pale blond, light blue eyes and has been raised since she was a few months old in the isolated, frigid forests of northern Finland. The things we begin to notice are the grimly serious hand-to-hand combat she and her father, Erik (Eric Bana) practice; the sneak attacks on each other and near-death blows; her knife skills and her bow and arrow expertise; her seriousness, her apparent lack of empathy, her high pain threshold; her relentless hunting down a reindeer she almost killed with an arrow, eating the steaming raw liver, skinning and butchering the beast and then hauling it back to the isolated one-room cabin she shares with her father. The cabin is rough living at best; heat comes from wood, clothes are rags and skins. This is all Hanna knows...plus several memorized identities, several languages and many facts about placesOne day, after Hanna beats her father in combat, she declares that she is ready. He takes out a small transmitter with a button. ""The choice is yours,"" he tells her. She reflects for a day, then reaches out and pushes the button. Hanna, the movie, is underway.That button has alerted CIA agent Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett) that Hanna is alive and where she is located. Hanna's father takes an old set of civilian clothes and leaves. He tells Hanna how to meet him. Hanna waits quietly for Marissa's agents to show up. There are three. She kills one, then is captured and taken to secret headquarters, where she meets Marissa face-to-face...or is it a false Marissa. Hanna kills several more before she escapes.The rest of Hanna is a thriller chase, with Hanna intent on meeting her father at a place called Grimm's House in Germany and learning her origins. Right behind her is Marissa, now searching for her father while one of her off-the-books operatives, Issacs (Tom Hollander), a small dyed-blond man who favors tight white jumpsuits and whistles while he works, seeks to capture Hanna and bring her to Marissa.Hanna is a clever thriller. A little of the air seeps out when the CIA is brought in. Making up for this is the consistency of Ronan's character. Hanna is a deadly naf. Was she brought up to be an assassin? I don't think so. She was brought up to defend herself against Marissa, with good reason. On the one-hand, Hanna's ruthlessness when it comes to killing bad guys is bracing but disturbing. On the other hand, her utter unfamiliarty with such concepts as ""friendship"" is also disturbing, and quite touching when she begins to grasp the idea. Ronan does a fine job.So fine, in fact, that Cate Blanchett doesn't walk off with the movie. Still, Blanchett's take on a cool, amoral, murderous woman, who must have control, is vivid and scary. She dominates every scene she's in, even those with Ronan, but she can't quite dominate Ronan's character.Even the smaller parts have been cast with care. I like three, especially. Tom Hollander is one of Britain's finest actors. Too short, perhaps to ever make it as more than a character lead, Hollander as Issacs plays a homosexual killer with verve. He enjoys using a man being interrogated for target practice. Martin Wuttke lives in Grimm's House in the middle of what appears to be an abandoned fair ground. He's eccentric, friends with Erik Heller and wants to protect Hanna. Michelle Dockery plays the false Marissa. She has a small role. She doesn't last long, but what time she has she uses well.Hanna is the kind of adventure movie that, likeTell No One, is well made, well acted and clever. Does it mean anything more?

1454189,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005CMSDKA,C. Sawin,"[2, 4]","Hanna felt like The Little Engine That Could right from the start. When the trailer first started being shown in theaters, it looked to have potential while featuring a solid cast. But it felt like a smaller film that would leave a big impact once you finally got around to seeing it. There were a few things working against the film. I'm fairly certain that the only film of Joe Wright's that I've actually had the opportunity to sit down and watch is The Soloist. Despite being enjoyable, its weak online reputation along with movie critics less than stellar ratings and reviews imply that the film missed its mark. Speaking of missing its mark, Saoirse Ronan was also in Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones which couldn't really decide what type of film to be and was more than a little disappointing overall. Luckily, Hanna doesn't suffer that same fate and we're actually given a film that is much stronger than it lets on.Hanna really utilizes the two senses you use most while watching a movie to their maximum potential. The beautiful cinematography is done in a way that let's you see things in a completely different light. There's a fairly wide contrast in scenery in the film; everything from the wooded forest to the dry, desolate desert to big cities to playgrounds and parks. Whether it's a cabin being covered by snow out in the middle of a Finnish forest, an expanding look at the rocky and seemingly endless desert floor, or just admiring the several sunsets utilized throughout the film to bridge one scene to the next, the camera work in Hanna is something that should definitely catch your eye.While we're on the subject of camera work, there are quite a few intriguing perspective techniques used in Hanna as well. Some of the most noteworthy scenes in the film are one-take or long-take sequences meaning no cutaways or chances to do it again without starting from the beginning. The best example is a scene involving Erik (Eric Bana) where he gets off a bus and is being tailed by four agents sent by Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett). The way that scene is filmed along with its climax is just spectacular. That same technique is used several times throughout the film and seems to make something simple like a chase through a junkyard way more entertaining than if it was filmed differently. Another interesting shot is when Erik finds Marissa in her hotel room. A battle of bullets breaks out as we look through one of the bullet holes to see Erik kicking the door in. Good stuff right there, boys and girls. Good stuff indeed.The other sense that's capitalized upon is what the film allows you to hear. Hanna features an original score by The Chemical Brothers and it doesn't disappoint. I'm not exactly a big fan of house music, techno, trip hop, or any music genre of that nature, but there's something about this soundtrack that adds something a different genre or artist probably wouldn't have been able to capture if they had been fortunate enough to do this soundtrack instead. Those beats and that electronic sound may not sound like they should be a part of a film like this, but it's an essential part of the film that makes the chase scenes involving Hanna more suspenseful and it's practically impossible to imagine Tom Hollander's ""sandman"" scene without that creepy bell-heavy lullaby. Truth be told, the Hanna soundtrack is every bit as good as the TRON: Legacy soundtrack.The action thriller has a fantastic way of coming full circle. The beginning and end come together in a way that feels similar, but is done in a satisfying way that makes the storyline feel complete. Hanna actually has a little bit of humor hidden in its depths, as well. Most of it involves Sophie (Jessica Barden) in some capacity. The ""three bullets"" scene is the first that comes to mind. The entire theater seemed to be in an uproar over that one.The one thing that didn't seem to click with Hanna was the editing. It's like the editor became incredibly overzealous being in possession of a soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers and certain scenes seemed more complicated than necessary. Hanna's (Saoirse Ronan) escape from holding was the scene that brought this theory to light. Flashing lights and scenes of Hanna running episode down along with multiple shots of her face in one frame just made the entire scene feel like an epileptic's nightmare.Hanna is a fantastically paced action thriller that features strong performances from a powerful cast and a storyline that's rounded out in the best of ways. Eric Bana nearly steals the show at times while you may want to kill Cate Blanchett at other times for her Texan accent alone, but Saoirse Ronan puts in a performance that may be the best of her career thus far. Top it off with a spectacular soundtrack from The Chemical Brothers, and Hanna becomes one of the first must-see films of the year that is both intelligent and features slap-the-taste-out-of-your-mouth action.",4,Smart and mesmerizing with an incredible soundtrack,1302220800,"04 8, 2011",2011,4944,"['Hanna', 'felt', 'Little', 'Engine', 'That', 'Could', 'right',

1454193,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B005CMSDKA,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[7, 8]","""Hanna"" is a ruthless, relentless, chase featuring a teen girl assassin. It's violent and suspenseful, fast and cruel. The chase sprawls over travelogue settings in the Arctic Circle, North Africa, and Berlin. It's like the Bourne movies, like Daniel Craig's Bond movies. The difference is, of course, that the hero is not a muscle-bound adult male, but a barely muscled teenage girl, Saorise Ronan. And the focus never waivers from the chase. Hanna gets no love interest.I generally don't go to movies I know are going to be violent and I have walked out of violent films, but I loved ""Hanna"" and kept my eyes open throughout almost all of it. It's not just that Hanna, the assassin, is a girl, and I'm female, too, although that was part of it. ""Hanna"" depicts Hanna as having an admirable work ethic, and as being an underdog. The one thing that separates her from the people she so determinedly wounds, beats, stabs, and kills is that she is just following the pedagogical training of her admirably dedicated, old-school patriarch, Erik (Eric Bana.) Erik raised his girl to know how to read, write, and kill. He did this for a righteous reason. The people Erik trained Hanna to kill are very, very bad people, and the audience wants them dead, as well. The morality and worldview of ""Hanna"" is very much that of the setting of its opening scene: the harsh north. This is Nordic morality, where even if you do the right thing, you may end up dead, anyway. There is no reward. If you don't end up dead, and live on, you live on only to keep fighting in a harsh, unforgiving landscape.Saorise Ronan gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Hanna. She truly inhabits a character whose sole focus is on struggle. She enters every new landscape, from a treeless desert to a hotel room, with the focus of a wild animal: where is the food? Where is something to drink? From what direction will danger come? How will I meet it? Ronan never once slips up, never once behaves as a comfortable teenage girl would behave. She has a killer's eyes throughout the entire film. I have to wonder if this wasn't a tough film for her to make. Playing Hanna would have given me nightmares.The film's ruthlessness becomes a bit of a failing. The film is so ready to wound and kill characters the audience wants to like, so ready to turn sweet moments into deadly poison, so ready to let any landscape become a death trap, that I did get a bit jaded about 75% into the film. I was no longer surprised when a character showed some humanity only to be dispatched in the most hateful of ways. But the film threw some new plot developments in at that point, and it kept my interest.Cate Blanchett is terrific as Hanna's foil. Eric Bana is solid as her dedicated teacher and father. The supporting cast, including Tom Hollander and Olivia Williams, is all very good.The Chemical Brothers' soundtrack is perfect. I often don't even hear soundtracks the first time I watch a movie, and when I do notice them, it is, all too often, because they are intrusive and trying to do the work of wrenching emotions that poor filmmaking could not do. During one breathless scene in ""Hanna,"" I realized that the post-Apocalyptic soundtrack geared me up and made me tense and brought me into the scene in a very enjoyable way.",4,The Work Ethic of a Teen Girl Assassin,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,3284,"['Hanna', 'ruthless', 'relentless', 'chase', 'featuring', 'teen', 'girl', 'assassin', 'violent', 'suspenseful', 'fast', 'cruel', 'chase', 'travelogue', 'settings', 'Arctic', 'Circle', 'North', 'Africa', 'Berlin', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'movies', 'difference', 'course', 'hero', 'not', 'muscle-bound', 'adult', 'male', 'barely', 'muscled', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Saorise', 'Ronan', 'focus', 'never', 'waivers', 'chase', 'Hanna', 'love', 'interest.I', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'movies', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'violent', 'have', 'walked', 'violent', 'films', 'loved', 'Hanna', 'kept', 'eyes', 'open', 'almost', 'not', 'just', 'Hanna', 'assassin', 'girl', ""'m"", 'female', 'too', 'was', 'part', 'Hanna', 'Hanna', 'having', 'admirable', 'work', 'ethic', 'being', 'underdog', 'one', 'thing', 'people', 'so', 'determinedly', 'beats', 'stabs', 'kills', 'just', 'following', 'pedagogical', 'training', 'admirably', 'dedicated', 'old-school', 'patriarch', 'Erik', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Erik', 'raised', 'girl', 'know', 'how', 'read', 'write', 'kill', 'did', 'righteous', 'reason', 'people', 'Erik', 'trained', 'Hanna', 'kill', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'people', 'audience', 'dead', 'as', 'well', 'morality', 'worldview', 'Hanna', 'very', 'much', 'setting', 'opening', 'scene', 'harsh', 'north', 'Nordic', 'morality', 'where', 'even', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'anyway', 'reward', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'live', 'live', 'only', 'keep', 'fighting', 'harsh', 'unforgiving', 'landscape.Saorise', 'Ronan', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Hanna', 'truly', 'inhabits', 'character', 'sole', 'focus', 'struggle', 'new', 'landscape', 'treeless', 'desert', 'hotel', 'room', 'focus', 'wild', 'animal', 'where', 'food', 'Where', 'something', 'drink', 'what', 'direction', 'will', 'danger', 'come', 'How', 'will', 'meet', 'Ronan', 'never', 'once', 'up', 'never', 'once', 'comfortable', 'teenage', 'girl', 'would', 'behave', 'killer', 'eyes', 'entire', 'film', 'have', 'wonder', 'was', ""n't"", 'tough', 'film', 'make', 'Playing', 'Hanna', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'nightmares.The', 'film', 'ruthlessness', 'bit', 'failing', 'film', 'so', 'ready', 'wound', 'kill', 'characters', 'audience', 'like', 'so', 'ready', 'turn', 'sweet', 'moments', 'deadly', 'poison', 'so', 'ready', 'let', 'landscape', 'become', 'death', 'trap', 'did', 'get', 'bit', 'jaded', '75', '%', 'film', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'surprised', 'when', 'character', 'showed', 'humanity', 'only', 'be', 'dispatched', 'most', 'hateful', 'ways', 'film', 'threw', 'new', 'plot', 'developments', 'point', 'kept', 'interest.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'terrific', 'Hanna', 'foil', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'solid', 'dedicated', 'teacher', 'father', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'very', 'good.The', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'hear', 'soundtracks', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'when', 'do', 'notice', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'intrusive', 'trying', 'do', 'work', 'wrenching', 'emotions', 'poor', 'filmmaking', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'one', 'breathless', 'scene', 'Hanna', 'realized', 'post-Apocalyptic', 'soundtrack', 'geared', 'up', 'made', 'tense', 'brought', 'scene', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'way']",N/A
1454194,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B005CMSDKA,DarthRad,"[14, 22]","""Hanna"" is a moderately entertaining movie, worth viewing just for the terrific acting by the trio of Cate Blanchett, Saoirse Ronan, and Eric Bana. But ultimately, I can't give it that high of a rating because it lacks a heart and soul, and despite being a two hour long movie, the many action sequences squeeze out scenes or plot points that would have let us understand or feel for the major characters.Saoirse Ronan reprises her ongoing roles as a young teenaged girl on a journey of discovery. She has played this part before, in ""City of Ember"", and ""Lovely Bones"" and is a terrific actress. Here in this movie, her hair and eyebrows and eyelashes have been bleached nearly white (she is normally a natural light brunette), giving her an ethereal quality, almost like a fairy or a wood elf. The difference in this movie is that her character is not a normal teenage girl, as we soon discover, and so she has this flat and emotionless affect through most of the movie.Cate Blanchett, what to say except that she is again wonderful, playing this fiercely evil CIA agent. Blanchett has been one of my favorite actresses after her role as Galadriel - I couldn't imagine anybody else playing that role ever again.Eric Bana has never been one of my favorite actors, as he seems to have cornered the market on roles as earnest but ultimately failed heroes. But he is an excellent actor.The movie has a lot of action sequences, with lots of running. The change from one scene to another is herky jerky, as we jump from the wilderness of Finland to an underground fortress in Morocco, to a tourist campground in Morocco, to Berlin, and then once in Berlin, from a rundown amusement park to her father's apartment, to her grandmother's apartment and then back to the amusement park.The action is also excessively stylish as if it were supposed to mean something. Why have the final denouement in an amusement park, starting in a house styled like a gingerbread fairy tale house? Why have Cate Blanchett's #1 evil henchman whistle a jaunty tune as he stalks his prey? I mean, won't that give him away?The movie left tons of loose ends and unanswered questions at the end. The motivations of the two adult antagonists are left only partially answered. Just why was Cate Blanchett's character chasing so hard after her quarry?

1454212,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005CMSDKA,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 7]","HANNA (2011) answers all the big questions about us: who we are, why we are here, where we are going (read: where we are destined to go). In a funny way that I dearly loved, HANNA answered these queries without really saying a word about them. In fact, HANNA has a lot of fun and incredible stuff that it never mentions. Watch this one with your eyes peeled!It's hard to review a PG-13 actioner about a beautiful young girl, Hanna (the gorgeous and sweet Saoirse Ronan whom I first saw in the quirkyCity of Ember, see my review), who also happens to be a well-trained killing machine. Raised in the wild by her father (an excellent Eric Bana), Hanna can do anything and survive anywhere. What she really wants to know is, What is music?This represents only a taste of the deficiencies in her upbringing - but the circumstances forbid me to even mention the story arc beyond the bare bones. At a crucial time of Hanna's own choosing, she may activate a homing device that will set the U.S. government on her and her father's tails. Naturally there is an excellent and very emotional reason for this, which I will not spoil.Ronan is a most skilled girl; she sweetly devours the role of Hanna and I sense she had great fun doing it. I had the most fun of my life watching her, as she runs off, set to rendezvous with her father in Berlin - and the animadventures she will suffer along the way. She meets and falls in love with a spoiled, vacant little British teen girl, sees Morocco and parts of Germany, gets caught and instantly escapes.The soundtrack by The Chemical Brothers is some a-kickin' music, the kind of swift 'martial-arts-techno' I love. In fact Ronan reminded me very much of the most skilled martial artists I have ever seen - no mean feat. Then again, I truly love this plucky, game little actress no matter what she's doing. And being trained by the great Master Dan Inosanto didn't hurt her! What a career she has in store, what treats await us in the future from this fine young girl.This film has pathos, humor, truly evil bad guys who blur with the good guys, if there even are any ""good guys"". Hanna knows she does not want to be what she is, does not want to live as she has been. She wants to see and know the world, and not hurt anyone. In short, she wants to be a superhero.This film, as I said, has all the answers contained in it - including Hanna's story. Many have said they do not understand this, they do not understand that. Watch, listen and learn. It is all here. A truly weird, Shakespearian ending, aside from being absolutely brilliant, is wide open for a sequel or two - or perhaps not. That is part of its brilliance. HANNA is the only film I can even think of that changes genres twice before our eyes. Again, no mean feat.I wanted more simply because this is so good. There is a European minimalism here which I find refreshing, and blended with the Dadaist humor, I suspect a lot was riding on Europe's acceptance of this work of art. It will do well in Europe too, especially Germany and Norway. This is no vacant, lame-brained vehicle for violence/mindless action. This is a joy, an epiphany and a supremely sad story.

The photography was excellent, especially the far north shots from Finland. The rest was good also, but I really liked the frozen north. Beautiful and well done! Also, before I watched the movie, I noticed that the music was by the Chemical Brothers. The Chemical Brothers? One of my favorite electronic acts? They're doing movies? Well, this I had to hear so my ears, at least, were open throughout the movie. I'd say it only barely sounded like the Chemical Brothers, but it was a well done musical score.Alas, now the movie. It was unmitigated nonsense. There's no other way to put it. How does Hollywood come up with stuff like this? A young woman was raised in the far north of the Finland wilds to be a trained killer and aimed at a target. Alas, she was tough, to be sure, but quite a charming young lady. Miscast? I'd say so! In any case, she escapes a planned raid on the Arctic Circle hideout and emerges from a man-hole in a subtropical desert at least 3000 miles away. Trust me. I'm a geologist. Now, does this strain credibility or what? The desert looked like an obscure part of the Colorado Plateau of the Western U. S., but the local quickly changed to North Africa. Alas, I'm already having trouble following this story. Then we find her amazed with electricity and in awe of lights and fans and things of that sort. Okay, it's understandable, considering her raising. However, a few minutes later, we find her using a computer search engine to track down her father. Alas, this is a story I just can' follow. There are so many interlaced credibility gaps that the whole story makes no sense whatsoever. Let's cut it short. She finally kills her target. There!The whole movie is just a fiasco. CIA agents everywhere. People getting killed by the dozens. Chase scenes overlapping chase scenes. Well, there's enough action that boredom doesn't set in but the story has no credibility at all.

1454226,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005CMSDKA,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","The title of this review is a twice stated comment from Hanna - the first when she shoots a dear with her bow and arrow and the second at the end when the arrow is aimed at a significant human character.  But actually the quote could summarize the response of most people who watch this strange film  Written by newcomers Seth Lochhead and David Farr and directed by Joe Wright who has 'The Soloist', 'Atonement', and 'Pride & Prejudice' to his credits, the problem with the film is the telling of the story: the whole thing makes sense at the end but before that the audience is left in somewhat of a quandary as to who is who and where is where  and why the whole thing is progressing the way it does.  Thankfully the entire concept is resolved in the closing minutes - and anyone who shares those secrets in a review would be doing a disservice to those who will encounter this gripping, action-packed thriller.The story opens in the forest in winter in Finland: teenage Hanna (Saoirse Ronan, an actress who is maturing very well indeed) lives with her father Erik (Eric Bana), an ex-CIA agent who has devoted his life sequestered with his daughter to raise her to be the perfect soldier.  They spar, challenge each other's fighting skills, hunt, share books, all the wile Erik is making Hanna memorize data about being from the Grimm house (as in the Brothers Grimm) in Berlin. At a certain point Hanna feels she is ready to go into the real world on her 'mission' and Erik changes his hunter costume for a suit and departs also (a strange signal box is turned on that will alert Erik's past confreres as to his return.  From this point we follow Hanna into many strange places including an interrogation chamber which seems totally foreign to her and tricks her into thinking her skills have accomplished her mission of killing one Marissa (Cate Blanchett).  Hanna escapes and continues her journey across Europe, Morocco, and unnamed places, all the while on the run and practicing her well-informed assassin skills.  She is followed by Marissa, and by the bizarre Isaacs (Tom Hollander) and his companion CIA Tech #1 (Paris Arrowsmith).  Hanna meets quite by accident a family on vacation -the hippie mother Rachel (Olivia Williams), the father Sebastian (Jason Flemyng) and their two children Sophie (Jessica Barden in a superb role as Hanna's only friend) and Miles (Aldo Maland). As the enemy closes in on Hanna and her adopted family, Hanna must leave and head for Berlin, all the while Erik is making his way toward Berlin, desiring to face Marissa with the secrets of Hanna's beginnings as a human experiment. And form that point the story must be guarded from those who must figure out the ending for themselves.Saoirse Ronan and Eric Bana give superb performances: Cate Blanchett seems oddly miscast here, having a difficult time figuring out which of her accents belongs to the monochromatic role. This is not a film for those who need linear storytelling: the  film does jump around a bit seemingly in search of a story, but that all comes to pass in the film's end.

It's still interesting when she is captured and tries to carry out her mission. But it soon degenerates. It's hard to root for her or Erik when they're killing poor working shmucks like lab techs and policemen.What's good: seeing Hanna react and adjust to the outside world - meeting electricity and other people and showers. I'd wager the lesbian-toned kiss between her and another teen is what earned all the critical acclaim, because the script is Luc Besson material (think Fifth Element, not Taken). Some ""symbolism"" in filming in Wilhelm Grimm's house, bad wolf, wicked witch, etc., but somewhat blunt.The climax is a letdown - for all their training, the promise of Hanna's training is feebly realized, and some main characters are taken down like rank amateurs. There is no intelligence to their final encounters, no smarts, no skill, no payoff for all that training. A superior movie in this regard would be Die Hard. There we see the hero and villains actually use their brains. As such, this movie is kind of a missed mess of genres.If I'd rented this for a dollar from Redbox, I'd still say it stank.

Thus, the obvious comparison of Hanna with Dragon Tattooed Girl trilogy and Kick-Ass girl all of which, to their credits, showed unique and creative storytelling. But, if a choice has to be made then Kick-Ass has an edge with the awe/cool factor. Their are several reasons why this female assassin fell a little short of five star greatness such as the following: First, the background story seemed a little holey as in too many holes to be totally coherent and thus envelop the viewers. Second, the genetic manipulation could have been more educative, which that field is, and less dumb photo montage and thus make the story more believably incredible. Third, for a girl of such potential she seemed to vacillate between super skill and super dumb actions/decisions. Fourth, the action scenes which are what the movie ultimately is to be judged upon were stereotypically bland and inconsistent. Fifth, the alternate ending should have been added after the final kill.On the positive side the cinematography was creative with angles, field of view, light and color. The locations and sets were outstanding from Finland to Morocco and finally a little Grimms' bad wolf as the final set. The story was creative despite the holes.

1454232,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005CMSDKA,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 8]","In the film's opening moments a teenaged girl stalks a caribou in the frozen wilderness and soon shoots it with an arrow. Approaching to deliver the coup de grce she softly informs the caribou, ""I just missed your heart."" And, at that moment, there's this premonition that we'll hear that line again somewhere down the pipe. For Hanna, it's all part of her lifelong training as an assassin, this girl rigorously tutored by her father and raised in snow-capped desolation somewhere near the Arctic Circle. It's frigid living, in more ways than one.Consider the fairy tale overtones which lend a perverse swerve to this stylish thriller. We note this as early as when Hanna leafs thru a Brothers Grimm picture book, and much later when she wanders into a wondrous home that is gigged out like Hansel and Gretel's enchanted cottage. There comes a time when school ends and the student graduates. Hanna feels that she's ready to step out into the world and fulfill her mission, the one for which she'd been prepping all her life. There's a switch that she must flip, for some reason.The filmmakers inject an introspective approach into the mechanics of an action thriller. The story sort of comes at you from an oblique angle, in the sense that not everything is spelled out for the viewer. We never do learn the entire back story regarding Hanna's parents and Marissa, the steely American intelligence officer (Cate Blanchett). Marissa's motivations aren't fully explored. We're not quite certain as to why she's so gung ho to capture Hanna, besides that obvious reason wherein Hanna poses too great a security risk if left to her own devices. But watching Erik (Hanna's dad) and Marissa's interactions, there's a vibe there.To serve as a grounding element and a counterpoint to Hanna's surreal existence, the screenplay introduces a normal English family, holidaying thru Morocco, with whom Hanna meets and gets involved. The best moments for me aren't those in which Hanna goes all assassin-y and wipes the floor with CIA henchmen. The best moments are when Hanna is learning about and reacting to the outside world, and a huge part of this consists of her observing this Brit family. Hanna strikes a tentative friendship with the British teen Sophie (Jessica Barden) who is the first ever girl that Hanna meets - and she first meets her during a frantic escape attempt. In her initial dialogue with Sophie, Hanna realizes that her rote responses don't quite cut it in the real world.The three leads are impeccable. Eric Bana toes that line between the father who loves his daughter but is chary with affection because he knows he has to eventually throw her to the wolves, and she must learn self-reliance. There's a pronounced brittleness to Cate Blanchett's character. She adds interesting quirks to her abstractly vile CIA operative but makes sure that she remains unlikable. And, up to the end, we wonder at the nature of her relationship with Hanna and her father. Saoirse Ronan, who plays Hanna, is mesmerizing. There's a riveting stillness about her. There are times when Ronan is simply just there, taking it all in, her character soaking in all the new experiences. The camera often pans in on her face and hones in on her eyes, which are haunting and expressive. You sense a palpable melancholy beneath the stoic facade. You just want to hug the girl, introduce her to the MTV channel or give her an iPod or something (Before venturing out of the Arctic Circle, Hanna had never been exposed to music). But then you realize that, that air of vulnerability aside, this girl won't hesitate to put a bullet in you if she thinks it needed doing.I expected more action from HANNA, and then I learned in the watching that the writers and director opted to inject more brains to the plot to complement the brawn. The tone is moody and pensive, and this - along with Hanna's journey of self-discovery - serves to lend more credence to the big action scenes when they do come along. It's worth noting that the high octane score by the Chemical Brothers ratchets up the tension that much more. Those moments in which Saoirse Ronan struts her badassery are worth checking out. She's showcased in three main set pieces. The first is when she breaks out of the CIA's impregnable fortress. The second is the fighty fight over at the shipping warehouse. Finally, there is her showdown with the wicked witch.

1454237,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B005CMSDKA,I'm Right,"[1, 2]","(Three and a half)The last movie I saw by the same director was Atonement, and it left a similar feeling with me that Hanna did where the story is pretty bland, but the visuals/sounds are fantastic. Well this bourne knockoff is more of the same, although it definately has more entertainment value than Atonement. The premise is very basic that would normally make for your typical bland PG-13 'thriller' that gets pinched out every couple of weeks but not in this case, Hanna is very European flavored which makes it more of an oddity.The story is Hanna's living with her dad in the middle of nowhere (I think they were in Greenland) and he's teaching her very extreme survival methods, and tells her that whenever she's ready (not sure for what exactly) to push a comical red button. When she does she get's captured by the CIA(I think?) and escapes, with an agency on her tail, and all sorts of life lessons for Hanna are learned between each ass kicking. I've seen this movie about three times now and the story has vague parts that have me still scratching my head.I went into this movie knowing nothing more than the cover so it was kind of a cool suprise that this wasn't Joan of Arc or something, that it took place in modern times, but when the story starts going along there's a lot of dumb action cliches you see (for example when she grabs onto the bottom of a truck going like 60mph in the middle of the rugged desert). A couple of things in the movie were just pretty bizarre as well, like the German bounty hunter who's played out to be some sadistic badass gets his ass whooped in like 2 seconds, the out-of-leftfield lesbian moment, and the British family that Hanna tags along with meet a suprisingly gruesome fate for a PG-13 movie. The ending is kind of abrupt too but I liked how it went full circle.So that's all the bad things about Hanna out of the way, lets talk about the good things, the shots are great, the cinematography was excellent as the film took you all over the place. The acting was alright, nothing really incredible but the kids weren't lousy actors this time which was nice. The visuals get pretty surreal at parts too, especially at the old hippie guy's house which was interesting. Some of the shots are simply brilliant as well, the strongest anti-piracy message I've ever seen was simply the subway fight scene, the build up, the music, the subtle visual cues, and of course the lightning fast choreography, all of it was fantastic.I'm also a big Chemical Brother's fan, but strangely enough didn't know they did the soundtrack until after I saw the movie, and I'd say they did a great job with the soundtrack. They didn't overdo their role by just adding more dance songs but actually did atmosphere which worked out great for them, to this day I still can't get 'The Devil's in the Details' out of my head.So Hanna's a rather strange Euro-action film, it wants so bad to be your typical American action film and yet it's just so weird that it can't be, and I suspect that it has a strong cult following since it wasn't a huge hit with normal audiences. That being said if you have an appreciation for styalized film, than you will enjoy Hanna, just don't put too much thought into the story. Another interesting thing is when I saw Hanna for the second time enebriated and the experience was much more rewarding with the brain turned off. Let's hope next time Joe Wright hires a better screen writer though.",3,"Dumb Story, Awesome Everything Else",1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,3454,"['Three', 'half', 'last', 'movie', 'saw', 'same', 'director', 'was', 'Atonement', 'left', 'similar', 'feeling', 'Hanna', 'did', 'where', 'story', 'pretty', 'bland', 'visuals/sounds', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Well', 'bourne', 'knockoff', 'more', 'same', 'definately', 'more', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Atonement', 'premise', 'very', 'basic', 'would', 'normally', 'make', 'typical', 'bland', 'PG-13', ""'thriller"", 'pinched', 'out', 'couple', 'weeks', 'not', 'case', 'Hanna', 'very', 'European', 'flavored', 'more', 'oddity.The', 'story', 'Hanna', 'living', 'dad', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'think', 'were', 'Greenland', 'teaching', 'very', 'extreme', 'survival', 'methods', 'whenever', 'ready', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'exactly', 'push', 'comical', 'red', 'button', 'When', 'get', 'captured', 'CIA', 'think', 'escapes', 'agency', 'tail', 'sorts', 'life', 'lessons', 'Hanna', 'are', 'learned', 'ass', 'kicking', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'story', 'vague', 'parts', 'have', 'still', 'scratching', 'head.I', 'went', 'movie', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'more', 'cover', 'was', 'kind', 'cool', 'suprise', 'was', ""n't"", 'Joan', 'Arc', 'something', 'took', 'place', 'modern', 'times', 'when', 'story', 'going', 'lot', 'dumb', 'action', 'cliches', 'see', 'example', 'when', 'grabs', 'bottom', 'truck', 'going', '60mph', 'middle', 'rugged', 'desert', 'couple', 'things', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'pretty', 'bizarre', 'as', 'well', 'German', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'who', 'played', 'out', 'be', 'sadistic', 'badass', 'ass', 'whooped', '2', 'seconds', 'out-of-leftfield', 'lesbian', 'moment', 'British', 'family', 'Hanna', 'meet', 'suprisingly', 'gruesome', 'fate', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'ending', 'kind', 'abrupt', 'too', 'liked', 'how', 'went', 'full', 'circle.So', 'bad', 'things', 'Hanna', 'way', 'talk', 'good', 'things', 'shots', 'are', 'great', 'cinematography', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'acting', 'was', 'alright', 'nothing', 'really', 'incredible', 'kids', 'were', ""n't"", 'lousy', 'actors', 'time', 'was', 'nice', 'visuals', 'get', 'pretty', 'surreal', 'parts', 'too', 'especially', 'old', 'hippie', 'guy', 'house', 'was', 'interesting', 'shots', 'are', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'well', 'strongest', 'anti-piracy', 'message', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'simply', 'subway', 'fight', 'scene', 'build', 'up', 'music', 'subtle', 'visual', 'cues', 'course', 'lightning', 'fast', 'choreography', 'was', 'fantastic.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'big', 'Chemical', 'Brother', 'fan', 'strangely', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', 'soundtrack', 'saw', 'movie', ""'d"", 'say', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'soundtrack', 'did', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'role', 'just', 'adding', 'more', 'dance', 'songs', 'actually', 'did', 'atmosphere', 'worked', 'out', 'great', 'day', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', ""'The"", 'Devil', 'Details', 'head.So', 'Hanna', 'rather', 'strange', 'Euro-action', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'be', 'typical', 'American', 'action', 'film', 'yet', 'just', 'so', 'weird', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'suspect', 'strong', 'cult', 'following', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'hit', 'normal', 'audiences', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'appreciation', 'styalized', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Hanna', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'too', 'much', 'thought', 'story', 'interesting', 'thing', 'when', 'saw', 'Hanna', 'second', 'time', 'enebriated', 'experience', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'rewarding', 'brain', 'turned', 'off', 'Let', 'hope', 'next', 'time', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'better', 'screen', 'writer']",N/A

Yeah, Hanna learns a few things about who she was and her past, but her character arc didn't show any growth.  She didn't have to overcome anything.  In fact, almost everything placed in her way as an obstacle seemed too easy for her to resolve.  She didn't grow any, she only learned new information going from scene to scene almost like a robot following her program.  It wouldn't surprise me if they made a sequel and revealed that she is, indeed, a robot.

Saoirse Ronan plays a girl who is being hunted by the CIA and apparently has spent about 13 of her 14 or so years in a cabin with her father someplace above the Arctic Circle where no one ever goes. She is being constantly trained in shooting, fighting, and other survival skills as well as multiple languages.First few problems: She has apparently never seen ANYTHING outside of the woods around their cabin. So while really good at shooting reindeer, she would never have seen anything like a TV, a car, or a phone. Their cabin is strictly a kerosene lights and woodstove operation. This seems not the best prep for getting along anyplace outside of an Innuit village. Ms. Ronan is also on the light and short side for her age. The concept of her fighting grown men is a little ahhh - well OK it's a movie. Then she gets to the real world and the movie just dies. It seems a REALLY bad remake of La Femme Nikita with all the techno music and flashing lights. Hanna acts like a cross between the Terminator, 7 of 9, and a lost 7th grader on a field trip. She can recite her (fake) life story by rote, but is utterly clueless at any human interaction and is also terrified by electric fans and TV sets.

You will enjoy this chilling performance probably more than the other two leads but that's not to undervalue them because villains always have the showiest parts. This is a balanced trio of good actors meeting the demands of the script: The father as teacher, the student who surpasses the teacher, and the principal who closed their 'school' and wants to eliminate them. Cate's henchmen are as nasty as her if not worse.There's a fairy tale motif running through this survival story as well as plenty of action scenes of mortal combat, chases, and torture accompanied by a throbbing score by the Chemical Brothers. The secondary theme concerns the emotional awakening of a young teenaged girl who has been raised away from civilization and must now learn to interact with adults and a girl of her own age as well as with boys as Hanna discovers when she tags along with an English family in Morocco on her covert trek to Germany. Saoirse is convincing here as in her action scenes. It's these blending of genres and themes that makes HANNA a cut above the usual action thriller. Saoirse will amaze you in how she uses her expressionless face to mask her true feelings and Cate will give you a good scare in just about every one of her scenes.This Blu-ray's visuals are very good in depicting the various locales and times of day but it's the DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack that surpasses them in quality to give your home theater's speakers and subwoofer a total workout with room shaking ability and startling surround effects.

1454257,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B005CMSDKA,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","What do you get when the director of Atonement, Pride and Prejudice (2007), and The Soloist directs an action movie?  How about if La Femme Nikita and The Fifth Element's Leeloo produced a love-child?  Same answer for both:  Hanna.  And not for something completely different...Both brutal and emotionally delicate, this fairy tale-driven movie follows a young, female, elven-looking Jason Bourne in her journey to defeat the wicked witch.  Hanna tries to appeal to both art house critics and action movie connoisseurs, but succeeds considerably more in the ethereal former than the latter.Hanna begins very slowly, but with no shortage of intrigue, as we are introduced to Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) and her father (Eric Bana) living in some subarctic wilderness.  They make ends meet by living off the grid with zero human interaction and hunting for self-sufficiency.  Like any father concerned for his early-teenage daughter, he randomly assaults her to test her developing martial prowess--for which she has a frightening facility.  Near bedtime Hanna is drilled to answer questions in Spanish, Italian, German...no problem.  We later learn that she also speaks Japanese and Arabic.  Just as we begin to question how this young girl could be so talented as a spy-in-training we meet her deficiency.  She has had no human or world interaction.  All of her knowledge outside of her ployglot tongue and combat grooming have been limited to a single-volume abridged encyclopedia.Yearning to be introduced to the world, we discover that Hanna's training has been geared to assassinate a CIA agent (Cate Blanchett) formerly assigned to her case; assigned to terminate her, having already dispatched her mother.  This plot element goes largely unexplained.  So if you craft questions about it while watching the movie, they will go unanswered.The movie has notably two different tones.  One is reserved for the scenes in which we see Hanna interacting with the sights, sounds, and denizens of a world she only understood through her father's explanations as if they were fairytales.  The majority of her character development is cued by a budding relationship with a posh British tween on her family vacation in Africa.  She experiences friendship, acceptance, and a near-first kiss which results in a Spanish teen almost having his neck snapped (a very Leeloo-Fifth Element moment).  Her awkward social encounters are humorous.  When asked how her mother died by the British girl's mother, Hanna casually and informatively replies: ""three bullets.""  While, at moments, this social experiment comes off as shocking, it also has its enchanting moments.  As she experiences new, simple things such as hearing music or having the wind blow in her face riding aback a motorcycle, her haunting expressions remind me of the emotional journey taken by the young, deaf Japanese girl from Babel.The other tone was strongly forecast by the trailer: Hanna is a stone-cold killer.  Eric Bana brought his A-game Munich bad-assery to this movie and shared a heaping spoonful of kickass awesome with his co-star.  There are several battles between Hanna and her father, as well as between each of them and various covert-types sent to kill them.  In terms of camera work and film-editing, no effort is made for the viewer to enjoy the Bourne Identity-style fighting choreography.  You ""know"" what kinds of moves are being executed, but you cannot really ""see"" it happen.  Instead, every effort is made for the viewer to experience the abrupt, brutal, purposeful nature of these trained killers.  Their techniques come off as effortless; instinctive.  Also similar to the Bourne series is how much sprinting occurs in this movie, making for a very fight-or-flight-y experience.Presented with many elements of fantasy--a young girl (sort of) imprisoned, naively interacting with the outside world, a ""near first"" kiss, revenge, a wicked witch, a fairy tale house, and various foreign locales--our more elf-than-human looking heroine strives to defeat her nemesis to have her revenge and gain her freedom.  Her journey ends with an ending that doesn't feel like an ending.  Rather it feels like they ""forgot"" to film the last few scenes and abruptly ""ended"" the movie on the spot.  Considering the strong, climactic, symbolic endings of fairy tales, this felt like a huge disappointment after watching an otherwise stimulating film.Despite some large plot holes and an ending that should earn the director a well-deserved kick in the nuts, I'd still like to offer a hard sell on seeing this movie.  It borrows from many, but is unlike any other.  I found this movie very interesting, touching and surreal.",4,Fairy tale secret super-agent: a coming of age tale,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,4680,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'director', 'Atonement', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '2007', 'Soloist', 'action', 'movie', 'How', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Leeloo', 'produced', 'love-child', 'Same', 'answer', 'Hanna', 'not', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'brutal', 'emotionally', 'delicate', 'fairy', 'tale-driven', 'movie', 'young', 'female', 'elven-looking', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'journey', 'defeat', 'wicked', 'witch', 'Hanna', 'appeal', 'art', 'house', 'critics', 'action', 'movie', 'connoisseurs', 'considerably', 'more', 'ethereal', 'former', 'latter.Hanna', 'very', 'slowly', 'shortage', 'intrigue', 'are', 'introduced', 'Hanna', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'father', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'living', 'subarctic', 'wilderness', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'living', 'off', 'grid', 'zero', 'human', 'interaction', 'hunting', 'self-sufficiency', 'father', 'concerned', 'early-teenage', 'daughter', 'randomly', 'assaults', 'test', 'developing', 'martial', 'prowess', 'frightening', 'facility', 'bedtime', 'Hanna', 'drilled', 'answer', 'questions', 'Spanish', 'Italian', 'German', 'problem', 'later', 'learn', 'also', 'Japanese', 'Arabic', 'Just', 'begin', 'question', 'how', 'young', 'girl', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'talented', 'spy-in-training', 'meet', 'deficiency', 'had', 'human', 'world', 'interaction', 'knowledge', 'ployglot', 'tongue', 'combat', 'grooming', 'have', 'been', 'limited', 'single-volume', 'abridged', 'encyclopedia.Yearning', 'be', 'introduced', 'world', 'discover', 'Hanna', 'training', 'been', 'geared', 'assassinate', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'formerly', 'assigned', 'case', 'assigned', 'terminate', 'having', 'already', 'dispatched', 'mother', 'plot', 'element', 'largely', 'unexplained', 'So', 'craft', 'questions', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'go', 'unanswered.The', 'movie', 'notably', 'two', 'different', 'tones', 'One', 'reserved', 'scenes', 'see', 'Hanna', 'interacting', 'sights', 'denizens', 'world', 'only', 'understood', 'father', 'explanations', 'were', 'fairytales', 'majority', 'character', 'development', 'cued', 'budding', 'relationship', 'posh', 'British', 'tween', 'family', 'vacation', 'Africa', 'friendship', 'acceptance', 'near-first', 'kiss', 'results', 'Spanish', 'teen', 'almost', 'having', 'neck', 'snapped', 'very', 'Leeloo-Fifth', 'Element', 'moment', 'awkward', 'social', 'encounters', 'are', 'humorous', 'When', 'asked', 'how', 'mother', 'died', 'British', 'girl', 'mother', 'Hanna', 'casually', 'informatively', 'replies', 'three', 'bullets', 'moments', 'social', 'experiment', 'off', 'shocking', 'also', 'enchanting', 'moments', 'new', 'simple', 'things', 'such', 'hearing', 'music', 'having', 'wind', 'blow', 'face', 'riding', 'aback', 'motorcycle', 'haunting', 'expressions', 'emotional', 'journey', 'taken', 'young', 'deaf', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'Babel.The', 'other', 'tone', 'was', 'strongly', 'forecast', 'trailer', 'Hanna', 'stone-cold', 'killer', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'brought', 'A-game', 'Munich', 'bad-assery', 'movie', 'shared', 'heaping', 'spoonful', 'kickass', 'awesome', 'co-star', 'are', 'several', 'battles', 'Hanna', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'covert-types', 'sent', 'kill', 'terms', 'camera', 'work', 'film-editing', 'effort', 'made', 'viewer', 'enjoy', 'Bourne', 'Identity-style', 'fighting', 'choreography', 'know', 'what', 'moves', 'are', 'being', 'executed', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'see', 'happen', 'Instead', 'effort', 'made', 'viewer', 'experience', 'abrupt', 'brutal', 'purposeful', 'nature', 'trained', 'killers', 'techniques', 'come', 'off', 'effortless', 'instinctive', 'Also', 'similar', 'Bourne', 'series', 'how', 'much', 'sprinting', 'movie', 'making', 'very', 'fight-or-flight-y', 'experience.Presented', 'many', 'elements', 'fantasy', 'young', 'girl', 'sort', 'imprisoned', 'naively', 'interacting', 'outside', 'world', 'first', 'kiss', 'revenge', 'wicked', 'witch', 'fairy', 'tale', 'house', 'various', 'foreign', 'locales', 'more', 'elf-than-human', 'looking', 'heroine', 'strives', 'defeat', 'nemesis', 'have', 'revenge', 'gain', 'freedom', 'journey', 'ending', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ending', 'forgot', 'film', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'abruptly', 'ended', 'movie', 'spot', 'Considering', 'strong', 'climactic', 'symbolic', 'endings', 'fairy', 'tales', 'felt', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'watching', 'otherwise', 'stimulating', 'film.Despite', 'large', 'plot', 'holes', 'ending', 'should', 'earn', 'director', 'well-deserved', 'kick', 'nuts', ""'d"", 'still', 'like', 'offer', 'hard', 'sell', 'seeing', 'movie', 'many', 'other', 'found', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'touching', 'surreal']",N/A

It stars Saroise Ronan (The Lovely Bones) as a young girl who was trained to be the perfect killer by her father (Eric Bana, ""The Hulk"", ""Munich"") who sets her out on a mission that takes her across Europe and into the path of an evil agent (Cate Blanchett, ""Robin Hood""). Of course like most movies of this kind there's always more going on than meets the eye.The early scenes with Hanna and her father in the Finland wilderness are very good and soon after her father leaves she is captured. The best sequence may have been when she escaped  and took out a whole bunch of guards using the skills that were bred into her. The whole movie while edited quite quickly is overall very well done, Ronan has a unique look and has a certain presence that will fit quite well in Hollywood.The problem that prevents ""Hanna"" from being a 4 star film is after the initial scenes with her dad and the escape it feels like the movie kinda ran out of juice near the end and that the director felt he had to rush to a finish. Mind you whats here is very good, but it leaves the viewer wanting more.As a whole ""Hanna"" is a good solid movie that certainly has plenty of originality and lots of good thrills.

It's almost like the 3 main actors, Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett, are in three separate movies that occasionally bump into each other and none of them make sense. The basic plot is that Cate Blanchett is a CIA manager, and Eric Bana used to be one of her agents about 15 years before. They were involved in a Super Soldier experiment that came to an end at which point, Bana was supposed to kill all the participants. He didn't. Instead, he takes baby Hanna into hiding and trains her up to be a lethal asset. Why? Because Bana thinks Blanchett will come for her. After 15 years. So what does he do? He turns on a homing beacon to tell Blanchett here they're hiding. Why? And why would she care after 15 years? Then all heck breaks loose after which Ronan goes on a coming-of-age odyssey I won't bore you with. And then it ends.HANNA has kinds of Felini-esque imagery which just adds to the what-the...? factor. If you like quirky, stream of conscious movies, then you might like HANNA.

She is gorgeous and ethereal on screen, with a face that subtly displays every emotion, without overacting. It's hard to say too much about the plot of this movie without spoiling it, so I won't, but basically Eric Bana plays her father, and the movie starts with them in a remote, frozen tundra where he is training her as an assassin or warrior of some type, although we don't really know why. Cate Blanchett also stars, as an intelligence officer somehow embroiled in what is going. The movie is an action adventure, but the pacing, filming, music, and soulfulness are more indie than blockbuster, and the entire thing really hinges on the performance of Saoirse Ronan, who more than pulls it off.I was engaged all the way through, but my husband found it a bit slow and dull in parts. I was OK with the pacing - I appreciated the more nuanced character development, which you don't usually see in action films - but I did think the ending lacked a bit. While I welcome the attempt to not simply tie everything up in a neat little bow, in this case a little too much was left unexplained, IMHO.

I think this film appeals to everyone, whether you are into action films or indie art films, or both. Hanna (played brilliantly by the young Saoirse Ronan) was raised in the forest by her father (Eric Bana). She has never had any contact with the outside world, and although she is quite intelligent, she is oblivious to many aspects of life. For example, she has never seen a television or heard music...and she doesn't really understand what she's missing out on. Hanna has also been raised as a soldier, and has been being groomed for a mission: her father wants her to murder an American agent (the always incredible Cate Blanchett) who killed her mother. Anxious to leave the forest, fulfill her responsibility, and get on with her life, Hanna embarks on a crazy and dangerous journey that will take her across Europe as she fights for her survival and discovers the secrets of her past.I absolutely loved this movie. It isn't cliche in any way. The pacing is great throughout the film, and I was deeply engrossed in the story from beginning to end. The acting is superb (LOVE Cate Blanchett's American accent!) and the cinematography is fantastic. There are so many great scenes and sequences that are unique and energized and so different from traditional films. It's a real pleasure to watch. The many fight scenes and the final scenes at the carnival are especially fantastic. I suppose my only gripe is that you don't really get an epilogue of what happens after the final scene, but I'm the kind of person who hates having any loose ends in a movie, and I realize that not everyone is like that, so this may not bother everyone.Overall, ""Hanna"" is awesome.

The best we've done so far isRalph Macchio, of whom there is one for every half-dozenFrankie Munizes. However, ""Hanna"" - the fourth film and action debut of director Joe Wright (Atonement) - strikes preciously rare ground in making teenager Saoirse Ronan believable as well as entertaining to a mature audience. It's definitely not everyman's action flick - a great deal of its strength relies on its genre-bending structure of thriller and bildungs motifs - but as someone who looks at all action fare with a skeptical eye, I can wholeheartedly recommend this one to whomever can approach it with an open mind.The story: Hanna (Ronan), a 16-year-old raised by her father (Eric Bana,Munich) in isolation to be the perfect assassin, is dispatched on a mission across Europe to kill a ruthless intelligence agent deadset on her capture (Cate Blanchett,The Lord of the Rings trilogy).I admit, I had to watch this film more than once to begin appreciating it. The story (written by first-timer Seth Lochhead) thrives on ambiguity - the ambiguity of Hanna's true origin and that of the strange triangle between her, her father, and Cate Blanchett's character. Additionally, the globetrotting nature of the plot confused me, as the film goes from Finland to Morocco to Spain and finally Germany with the utmost nonchalance; the first transition is particularly jarring, making it feel as though we're entering a dream scene when Hanna suddenly enters a palm resort amidst camels and folks in robe and turbans. To counter potential discomfort with these aspects, you just need to remain alert and not expect the locations to pop up in text on the screen. The payoff of this is that you get to better enjoy a cast of surprisingly interesting characters: Hanna of course is always nice to watch in her ongoing introduction to society, and Cate Blanchett's deceptively complicated CIA-witch is more intriguing every time you watch her; additionally, Hanna tags along with a quirky bohemian family for some weirdly sweet scenes, and all the while she's pursued by a trio of German enforcers led by Tom Hollander (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest) who for all the world could have jumped out of a Luc Besson or Quentin Tarantino picture.The action isn't overly abundant, but when it occurs, it's just the way I like it: up close & personal, with a good deal of martial arts but no explosions or car chases. Normally, I'd take account of the fact that none of the performers here are legitimate martial artists, but instead, I consider the movie an accomplishment for fight choreographer Jeff Imada (The Bourne Ultimatum), who's got a knack for making non-fighters look legitimate without the need of stunt doubles. It helps that the fights are all pretty realistic: the five exchanges are relatively few and far between, but they stand out for their convincing design, full of counter-strikes and a few judo maneuvers. My personal favorite (the subway brawl) doesn't include Saoirse Ronan at all, but she's still a highlight when you see her taking on opponents larger than herself and overcoming them without needing them to feint blows or over-sell a strike. I'll admit, the fights aren't mind-blowing, but I honestly couldn't believe that I was watching the skinny shrimp fromThe Lovely Bonesthe first time I saw her tussle. I have no reason to believe that Ronan will remain a regular of the action genre, and darnit I'm disappointed - this girl could outdo Cynthia Rothrock, given time and opportunity.My major qualm with the film is its ending: it doesn't so much sneak up on you as just end - it's like ifStar Warshad gone to the credits right after everyone had escaped the Death Star for the first time. Maybe this is to set up a sequel, but it's still pretty disappointing if you've gotten as involved in the movie as I have. With that said, I'd be the first in line to see this hypothetical sequel, if I knew it were anything as good as this. ""Hanna"" isn't a film I'd use to introduce a complete newcomer to the action genre, but it'd definitely be on my list to demonstrate how diverse of stars and vehicles you can expect to find.",4,"""Adapt or die - Think on your feet - Even when I'm sleeping""",1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,4293,"['Starring', 'child', 'adolescent', 'kind', 'action', 'movie', 'gamble', 'place', 'outspokenly', 'serious', 'one', 'decisively', 'dangerous', 'risk', 'best', ""'ve"", 'done', 'so', 'far', 'isRalph', 'Macchio', 'whom', 'one', 'half-dozenFrankie', 'Munizes', 'However', 'Hanna', 'fourth', 'film', 'action', 'debut', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'Atonement', 'strikes', 'preciously', 'rare', 'ground', 'making', 'teenager', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'mature', 'audience', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyman', 'action', 'flick', 'great', 'deal', 'strength', 'relies', 'genre-bending', 'structure', 'thriller', 'bildungs', 'motifs', 'someone', 'who', 'action', 'fare', 'skeptical', 'eye', 'can', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'one', 'whomever', 'can', 'approach', 'open', 'mind.The', 'story', 'Hanna', 'Ronan', '16-year-old', 'raised', 'father', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Munich', 'isolation', 'be', 'perfect', 'assassin', 'dispatched', 'mission', 'Europe', 'kill', 'ruthless', 'intelligence', 'agent', 'deadset', 'capture', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', '.I', 'admit', 'had', 'watch', 'film', 'more', 'once', 'begin', 'appreciating', 'story', 'written', 'first-timer', 'Seth', 'Lochhead', 'ambiguity', 'ambiguity', 'Hanna', 'true', 'origin', 'strange', 'triangle', 'father', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'character', 'Additionally', 'globetrotting', 'nature', 'plot', 'confused', 'film', 'Finland', 'Morocco', 'Spain', 'finally', 'Germany', 'utmost', 'nonchalance', 'first', 'transition', 'particularly', 'jarring', 'making', 'feel', ""'re"", 'entering', 'dream', 'scene', 'when', 'Hanna', 'suddenly', 'palm', 'resort', 'amidst', 'camels', 'folks', 'robe', 'turbans', 'counter', 'potential', 'discomfort', 'aspects', 'just', 'need', 'remain', 'alert', 'not', 'expect', 'locations', 'pop', 'up', 'text', 'screen', 'payoff', 'get', 'better', 'enjoy', 'cast', 'surprisingly', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Hanna', 'course', 'always', 'nice', 'watch', 'ongoing', 'introduction', 'society', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'deceptively', 'complicated', 'CIA-witch', 'more', 'intriguing', 'time', 'watch', 'additionally', 'Hanna', 'quirky', 'bohemian', 'family', 'weirdly', 'sweet', 'scenes', 'pursued', 'trio', 'German', 'enforcers', 'led', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Chest', 'who', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'jumped', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'picture.The', 'action', ""n't"", 'overly', 'abundant', 'when', 'just', 'way', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'good', 'deal', 'martial', 'arts', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'Normally', ""'d"", 'take', 'account', 'fact', 'none', 'performers', 'here', 'are', 'legitimate', 'martial', 'artists', 'instead', 'consider', 'movie', 'accomplishment', 'fight', 'choreographer', 'Jeff', 'Imada', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'who', 'got', 'knack', 'making', 'non-fighters', 'look', 'legitimate', 'need', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'fights', 'are', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'five', 'exchanges', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'far', 'stand', 'out', 'convincing', 'design', 'full', 'counter-strikes', 'few', 'judo', 'maneuvers', 'personal', 'favorite', 'subway', 'brawl', ""n't"", 'include', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'still', 'highlight', 'when', 'see', 'taking', 'opponents', 'larger', 'overcoming', 'needing', 'feint', 'blows', 'over-sell', 'strike', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'fights', 'are', ""n't"", 'mind-blowing', 'honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'watching', 'skinny', 'shrimp', 'fromThe', 'Lovely', 'Bonesthe', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'tussle', 'have', 'reason', 'believe', 'Ronan', 'will', 'remain', 'regular', 'action', 'genre', 'darnit', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'girl', 'could', 'outdo', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'given', 'time', 'opportunity.My', 'major', 'qualm', 'film', 'ending', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'sneak', 'up', 'just', 'end', 'ifStar', 'Warshad', 'gone', 'credits', 'right', 'everyone', 'had', 'escaped', 'Death', 'Star', 'first', 'time', 'Maybe', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'still', 'pretty', 'disappointing', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'involved', 'movie', 'have', 'said', ""'d"", 'be', 'first', 'line', 'see', 'hypothetical', 'sequel', 'knew', 'were', 'anything', 'as', 'good', 'Hanna', ""n't"", 'film', ""'d"", 'use', 'introduce', 'complete', 'newcomer', 'action', 'genre', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'be', 'list', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'diverse', 'stars', 'vehicles', 'can', 'expect', 'find']",N/A

At the same time, though, I'm close to agreeing with a one-star reviews that advised viewers to turn off the TV when Hanna flips the switch to let her whereabouts be known to the Wicked Witch. The only reason I'm not in full agreement is that the Witch is played by Blanchett and I enjoyed every scene that she is in. I also agree with a one-star review that scolds the movie, or the heroine, for wasting time and energy beating up her merely mortal father, Eric Bana, when there are actual villains out there. Coming-of-age film or not, this spoiled brat should have learned to control her temper by now! More seriously, the film should have made up its mind whether it is a thriller with a teenage girl as assassin, which would had my vote, or science fiction with a mystery element, or a coming-of-age saga with a heroine who has does have some unusual issues to deal with, or a fairy tale.

Ronan is remarkable as a world class martial artist, showing real prowess.  At times she also is a regular if nave, teenager.  Brilliant acting including Cate Blanchette as the CIA officer in charge and the quirky Jessica Barden from ""Tamara Drewe"" and a rocking Chemical Brothers soundtrack help elevate this movie from the norm.BLU RAY UPDATE:This is a Blu ray update and second viewing.  It might seem unusual for director Joe Wright who is known more for the likes of ""The Soloist,"" ""Atonement, "" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" to take on an action flick like this.  It is a pretty straight forward escape and exact revenge film.  Nothing unusual about that.  Nothing really unusual about the fact that it is a female seeking retribution.  Nothing really unusual even that it is a teen-ager.So what makes this film so interesting?  First and foremost, Wright spends enough time with Hanna early in the film to make you believe she could be a lethal weapon.  After all, she's 16 and about 100 pounds.  Raised by her father (Eric Bana), a former CIA operative, in remote northern Finland, Hanna is trained to survive and kill those who would harm her.  In a brilliant about face, Oscar nominee (for the aforementioned ""Atonement,"") Saoirse Ronan is totally convincing in spite of her sprite-like presence.  While the action sequences are truly excellent, Wright takes the time to humanize Hanna.  She's whip-smart and quick to adapt, but she is also sheltered from the world.  She's never kissed a boy for example.  And when that opportunity arises she is both curious and fearful.In her cross-continent escape to Berlin she encounters a band of gypsies in southern Spain.  Rather than brushing past this meeting, Wright lingers a bit, allowing Hanna to absorb her first real exposure to music.  There are many subtleties that raise this action drama above the norm.  When Hanna meets another teenage girl (terrific Jessica Barden) they become friends.  You can see it in their eyes as the camera closes in on their dilated pupils.  The villain in the movie it another surprise.  Cate Blanchett is the sinister CIA sector boss who authorized the experiments that led to Hanna's unusual abilities and killed her mother.  In one scene when Marissa (Blanchett) is under stress, the camera catches her upper lip quivering.Lest one think this film is short on action, think again.  In a noteworthy scene shortly after Hanna is captured early in the movie, she escapes killing those in her way and using her lithe frame and training to slink through tunnels, ductwork, cracks and crevices.  All this while the Chemical Brother's pounding soundtrack fills the speakers.  This is grade A escapism.The Blu ray transfer of this film is near perfect.  Filled with snowy landscapes and glowing computer banks, the film sparkles from every corner.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is of reference quality.  The speakers are constantly active is the surrounds and the LFE channel is full of lossless bass.  The sound is enveloping without become aural trickery.  Bonus features include an alternate ending, deleted scenes, an anatomy of a scene and commentary by director Joe Wright, a piece on the Chemical Bros. score and soundtrack and several other featurettes.",5,BLU RAY UPDATE: One of the best movies of the year!,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,3960,"['Director', 'Joe', 'Wright', '180', 'acclaimed', 'Atonement', 'delivers', 'action', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'conquer', 'new', 'territory', 'as', 'much', 'grit', 'genre', 'Hanna', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'who', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'role', 'aforementioned', 'Atonement', 'Here', '16', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'far', 'removed', 'civilization', 'remote', 'Scandinavian', 'country', 'living', 'ex-spy', 'dad', 'Erik', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'are', 'evidently', 'evading', 'CIA', 'and/or', 'other', 'evil', 'goon', 'squads', 'secret', 'girl', 'suspect', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'later', 'Once', 'Dad', 'convinced', 'can', 'survive', 'own', 'turned', 'loose', 'head', 'back', 'world', 'Dad', 'other', 'way', 'plan', 'reunite', 'Berlin', 'Ronan', 'remarkable', 'world', 'class', 'martial', 'artist', 'showing', 'real', 'prowess', 'times', 'also', 'regular', 'nave', 'teenager', 'Brilliant', 'acting', 'including', 'Cate', 'Blanchette', 'CIA', 'officer', 'charge', 'quirky', 'Jessica', 'Barden', 'Tamara', 'Drewe', 'rocking', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', 'soundtrack', 'help', 'elevate', 'movie', 'norm.BLU', 'RAY', 'UPDATE', 'Blu', 'ray', 'update', 'second', 'viewing', 'might', 'seem', 'unusual', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'who', 'known', 'more', 'likes', 'Soloist', 'Atonement', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'take', 'action', 'flick', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'escape', 'exact', 'revenge', 'film', 'Nothing', 'unusual', 'Nothing', 'really', 'unusual', 'fact', 'female', 'seeking', 'retribution', 'Nothing', 'really', 'unusual', 'even', 'teen-ager.So', 'film', 'so', 'interesting', 'First', 'foremost', 'Wright', 'enough', 'time', 'Hanna', 'early', 'film', 'make', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'lethal', 'weapon', '16', '100', 'pounds', 'Raised', 'father', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'former', 'CIA', 'operative', 'remote', 'northern', 'Finland', 'Hanna', 'trained', 'survive', 'kill', 'who', 'would', 'harm', 'brilliant', 'face', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'aforementioned', 'Atonement', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'totally', 'convincing', 'spite', 'sprite-like', 'presence', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'truly', 'excellent', 'Wright', 'time', 'humanize', 'Hanna', 'whip-smart', 'quick', 'adapt', 'also', 'sheltered', 'world', 'never', 'kissed', 'boy', 'example', 'when', 'opportunity', 'curious', 'fearful.In', 'cross-continent', 'escape', 'Berlin', 'band', 'gypsies', 'southern', 'Spain', 'Rather', 'brushing', 'meeting', 'Wright', 'bit', 'allowing', 'Hanna', 'absorb', 'first', 'real', 'exposure', 'music', 'are', 'many', 'subtleties', 'raise', 'action', 'drama', 'norm', 'When', 'Hanna', 'teenage', 'girl', 'terrific', 'Jessica', 'Barden', 'become', 'friends', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'camera', 'dilated', 'pupils', 'villain', 'movie', 'surprise', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'sinister', 'CIA', 'sector', 'boss', 'who', 'authorized', 'experiments', 'led', 'Hanna', 'unusual', 'abilities', 'killed', 'mother', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Marissa', 'Blanchett', 'stress', 'camera', 'upper', 'lip', 'quivering.Lest', 'one', 'think', 'film', 'short', 'action', 'think', 'again', 'noteworthy', 'scene', 'shortly', 'Hanna', 'captured', 'early', 'movie', 'killing', 'way', 'using', 'lithe', 'frame', 'training', 'slink', 'tunnels', 'ductwork', 'cracks', 'crevices', 'Chemical', 'Brother', 'pounding', 'soundtrack', 'speakers', 'grade', 'A', 'escapism.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'film', 'perfect', 'Filled', 'snowy', 'landscapes', 'glowing', 'computer', 'banks', 'film', 'sparkles', 'corner', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'reference', 'quality', 'speakers', 'are', 'constantly', 'active', 'surrounds', 'LFE', 'channel', 'full', 'lossless', 'bass', 'sound', 'enveloping', 'become', 'aural', 'trickery', 'Bonus', 'include', 'alternate', 'ending', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'anatomy', 'scene', 'commentary', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'piece', 'Chemical', 'Bros.', 'score', 'soundtrack', 'several', 'other', 'featurettes']",N/A

It reminded me a lot of the Bourne films, except this time the person laying the beat downs and killing people left and right is a young girl that even Hit-Girl would envy. Basically she is trained to be a lethal assassin by her father, who has a background in the subject, in a remote cabin cut off from the outside world. Let's just say that some covert operation from years back had some loose ends that needed tying up, so of course they are now the targets, but boy did they mess with the wrong duo.I liked the strong European feel from the locations to the small character parts throughout. It was kind of like entering a different world. Throw in some well choreographed fight scenes that don't shy away from the violence despite the PG-13 rating and you've got quite the feast. It's even peppered with a number of light hearted moments that might bring a smile to your face. The directing, camera work, writing and music were also of high caliber, but the strong level of acting on display really stole the show.There are a number of really talented young actresses at the moment (Hailee Steinfeld and Chlo Grace Moretz for example), but Saoirse Ronan is in the same league if not even better. I had previously seen her in Atonement and The Lovely Bones and while I had issues with both of those films, she was the definite standout. Her line delivery and facial expressions continue to amaze for someone her age. This is her best role by far. You will believe she is not someone to mess with. Eric Bana is convincing as her father and Cate Blanchett turns in one of her best roles ever in my opinion. What a bad lady. Even the weirdo psycho killer working for Blanchett is memorable in a part that could have been a throwaway.Now for some minor negatives. A couple of parts did get a little slow and once the mystery is revealed it's more of a been there done that kind of deal, but overall Hanna remains a unique blending for an action film. One that actually has the smarts to stretch beyond the genre's normal limitations.And yes, I was so close to giving this 5 stars, but in the end I just couldn't pull the trigger.",4,I'd have a better shot defeating Tyson in his prime than I would this teenage girl,1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,2204,"['Now', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'even', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Bourne', 'films', 'time', 'person', 'laying', 'beat', 'downs', 'killing', 'people', 'left', 'right', 'young', 'girl', 'even', 'Hit-Girl', 'would', 'envy', 'Basically', 'trained', 'be', 'lethal', 'assassin', 'father', 'who', 'background', 'subject', 'remote', 'cabin', 'cut', 'off', 'outside', 'world', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'covert', 'operation', 'years', 'back', 'had', 'loose', 'ends', 'needed', 'tying', 'up', 'course', 'are', 'now', 'targets', 'boy', 'did', 'mess', 'wrong', 'duo.I', 'liked', 'strong', 'European', 'feel', 'locations', 'small', 'character', 'parts', 'was', 'kind', 'entering', 'different', 'world', 'Throw', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'violence', 'PG-13', 'rating', ""'ve"", 'got', 'quite', 'feast', 'even', 'peppered', 'number', 'light', 'hearted', 'moments', 'might', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'directing', 'camera', 'work', 'writing', 'music', 'were', 'also', 'high', 'caliber', 'strong', 'level', 'acting', 'display', 'really', 'stole', 'show.There', 'are', 'number', 'really', 'talented', 'young', 'actresses', 'moment', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'example', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'same', 'league', 'not', 'even', 'better', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'Atonement', 'Lovely', 'Bones', 'had', 'issues', 'films', 'was', 'definite', 'standout', 'line', 'delivery', 'facial', 'expressions', 'continue', 'amaze', 'someone', 'age', 'best', 'role', 'far', 'will', 'believe', 'not', 'someone', 'mess', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'convincing', 'father', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'ever', 'opinion', 'What', 'bad', 'lady', 'Even', 'weirdo', 'psycho', 'killer', 'working', 'Blanchett', 'memorable', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'throwaway.Now', 'minor', 'negatives', 'couple', 'parts', 'did', 'get', 'little', 'slow', 'once', 'mystery', 'revealed', 'more', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'kind', 'deal', 'overall', 'Hanna', 'unique', 'blending', 'action', 'film', 'One', 'actually', 'smarts', 'stretch', 'genre', 'normal', 'limitations.And', 'yes', 'was', 'so', 'close', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'end', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'trigger']",N/A

Directed by Joe Wright, Atonement, If you didn't know better you would swear he had directed action before. The movie does have a lot of action. Filmed very well, not that shaky camera stuff either. The plot is a little thin and the ending is pretty much predictable. The acting was really good again. Eric Banna no stranger to action, and Cate Blanchete who plays the villain over the top but you can tell she had fun with it. The movie is being called a art house action movie because after Hanna thinks she takes care of her problems she has to trek across Europe mostly with a very odd family where Hanna Learns about the world and how ill prepared she is to deal with it. Just when things start to fell slow the movie kicks back into action until its ending. The cinematography is insanely beautiful. Form the Cold winter wonderland to the scorching desert, Hanna's whole journey looks amazing on Blu ray. The score is one of the best I have heard, somewhat like Tron Legacy's score, its loud and will get your heart pumping. My only problems were I had a slight disconnect with the family Hanna stays with and I thought it shouldn't have been so predictable.

Military vehicles drive above her going somewhere between 50 and 90 miles an hour. She grabs the bottom of one as it is driving inches above her head. Her head is nearly level with the surrounding ground. Anybody who did this would have had their back broken as it impacted with the ground on their way out of the hole. Totally ludicrous.The entire movie is equally unbelievable. Maybe it would be forgivable if there were any interesting plot to carry the movie. The plot meanders slowly. Uninteresting characters are constantly introduced throughout the movie. The only really good character was an old Moroccan (supposedly but I doubt it because his French accent was not great and not very North African sounding--I guess they used an American Palestinian and borrowed some camels from the Los Angeles zoo). Unfortunately he is killed off pretty fast and the boring bad guys, who as usual look like Nazi skinheads with the typical bad guy blonde dyed hair, get to stay.A better movie would have involved that old Moroccan man meeting her and protecting her through the rest of the movie like in The Professional but with him being just a regular old guy. That was a hell of a better movie than this one and was much more believable. The characters are all so flat and typical that it is hard to care about any of them. Most especially her. I wasn't even rooting for her. They could have disemboweled her onscreen 30 minutes into the movie and I would have been like, I hope that means this boring ride is over.Here is some typical dialogue from the movie as she sits next to a teenage guy that I guess we are supposed to think is a hot bad boy. He has one earring and no chin...Her: ""Are we going to kiss now?"" Him: ""Would you like to?"" Her: ""Kissing requires a total of 34 facial muscles and 112 postual muscles. The most important muscle involved is the obicularis florus muscle because it is used to pucker the lips.""After her tempting words, he tries to kiss her so she punches him in the face, flips him over, and body slams him into the ground where she lays on top of him subduing him as he quivers with fear. She says: ""I'm going to go now."" Him: ""OK."" Her: ""It was nice."" This script is just such a dud. The only thing it is missing is Angelina Jolie shooting bullets that curve instead of flying straight.The director definitely has some weird fascination for the actress who play Hanna. He films her slow motion with her hair blowing in the wind and her blonde hair backlit by light to look even more light blonde. If the rest of us were as fascinated by prepubescent blonde girls as the director, maybe this would be a more watchable movie.",1,Boring and unrealistic,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2777,"['unrealistic', 'stunts', 'make', 'movie', 'laughable', 'boring', 'watch', 'one', 'scene', 'Hanna', 'hiding', 'manhole', 'Military', 'vehicles', 'drive', 'going', 'somewhere', '50', '90', 'miles', 'hour', 'grabs', 'bottom', 'one', 'driving', 'inches', 'head', 'head', 'nearly', 'level', 'surrounding', 'ground', 'Anybody', 'who', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'back', 'broken', 'impacted', 'ground', 'way', 'hole', 'Totally', 'ludicrous.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'equally', 'unbelievable', 'would', 'be', 'forgivable', 'were', 'interesting', 'plot', 'carry', 'movie', 'plot', 'meanders', 'slowly', 'Uninteresting', 'characters', 'are', 'constantly', 'introduced', 'movie', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'character', 'was', 'old', 'Moroccan', 'supposedly', 'doubt', 'French', 'accent', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'very', 'North', 'African', 'sounding', 'guess', 'used', 'American', 'Palestinian', 'borrowed', 'camels', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'zoo', 'Unfortunately', 'killed', 'off', 'pretty', 'fast', 'boring', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'usual', 'look', 'Nazi', 'skinheads', 'typical', 'bad', 'guy', 'blonde', 'dyed', 'hair', 'get', 'stay.A', 'better', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'involved', 'old', 'Moroccan', 'man', 'meeting', 'protecting', 'rest', 'movie', 'Professional', 'being', 'just', 'regular', 'old', 'guy', 'was', 'hell', 'better', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'flat', 'typical', 'hard', 'care', 'Most', 'especially', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'rooting', 'could', 'have', 'disemboweled', 'onscreen', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hope', 'boring', 'ride', 'typical', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'next', 'teenage', 'guy', 'guess', 'are', 'supposed', 'think', 'hot', 'bad', 'boy', 'one', 'earring', 'chin', 'Are', 'going', 'kiss', 'now', 'Would', 'like', 'Kissing', 'total', '34', 'facial', 'muscles', '112', 'postual', 'muscles', 'most', 'important', 'muscle', 'involved', 'obicularis', 'florus', 'muscle', 'used', 'pucker', 'lips', 'tempting', 'words', 'kiss', 'face', 'body', 'slams', 'ground', 'where', 'top', 'subduing', 'fear', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'now', 'OK.', 'was', 'nice', 'script', 'just', 'such', 'dud', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'shooting', 'bullets', 'curve', 'instead', 'flying', 'straight.The', 'director', 'definitely', 'weird', 'fascination', 'actress', 'who', 'play', 'Hanna', 'films', 'slow', 'motion', 'hair', 'blowing', 'wind', 'blonde', 'hair', 'backlit', 'light', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'light', 'blonde', 'rest', 'were', 'fascinated', 'prepubescent', 'blonde', 'girls', 'director', 'maybe', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'watchable', 'movie']",N/A

Gregg,"[0, 0]","This COULD HAVE been very good.Plot/premise:  A (German?) government agency does some DNA altering on embryos to make stronger, smarter, healthier ""soldiers"".  Then pulls the plug and kills off all the evidence - except for baby Hanna and agent Erik who get away (Hanna's mother is killed in the escape).  Erik who is NOT her biological father, hid Hanna in the wilderness and taught her physical survival skills and educated her including teaching her multiple languages.  When she feels ready to take on those who want her dead, he produces a signal box - Hanna (about 13 yrs old) flips the switch and waits for them to show up while Erik takes off.The question is WHY?  WHY would they do this? Why not slip quietly into the world and hopefully never be noticed by them, with physical combat skills to protect herself with if she's found?  Or, why not stealthily go after the person(s) who want her dead?  Why the major ""come and get me""?  Why did Erik risk his life to save her, raise and train her to survive and then leave her so vulnerable?  There is no logic to going about it this way.This ""WHY"" ruined the entire movie for me.  Had they simply just been discovered one day in the woods, or had they tried to go after these people and not quite pulled it off and then those people came after them, it would've been a good enough story to work.

Could Saoirse Ronan be the next Angelina Jolie?I liked the premise, the whole &#8220;taught to be awesome warrior&#8221; thing,  but I didn't get the premise for the rest.

There was so much to work with!  Yeah, I like a good deal of the action but I really was a bit let down overall.Don't misunderstand, a rating of 4 is a movie worth watching in my book, but where I would watch every episode of Arrow (on CW) and have read all the Hunger Games books, and watched the 2 movies (so far), I'll not be in this one for a re-run.Along the way there are some interesting 'reveals' that were unexpected, but with hindsight there were a few hints to all the reveals along the way.  It is in the reveals that beg for a sequel. I don't really know where to go from there, but there is absolutely a sequel and if I were writing it, it would be better than the original.  I'd go for something along the Borne Identity range of ideas, toss in some awkward romance and it's a hit.I did like the conclusion.

Add some high-biotech, beyond state-of-the-art manipulation of basic reproductive material in a weapons-grade experiment that gets out of hand, and we're still not enirely out of the domain of plausibility.  Write a slam-bang story based on an admittedly far-fetched rendering of the foregoing premise.  Recruit a cast of really fine actors, including those who fill the roles of kids who are, in various winsome ways, precocious but never obnoxious, and you've got a really fun movie.  In this case you've got Hanna.As played by Saoirse Ronan, Hanna is an engaging character who combines almost unlimited resourcefulness, a purposefully focused cloak-and-dagger sort of sophistication, and a very believable naivete' in a world that is exciting, dangerous, and wherein she finds genuine friendship and affection.  While on the run from the off-handedly evil Marissa (Cate Blanchett) and her henchmen, Hanna joins up with a family headed by a couple of well-meaning and likeable latter day hippies.  Their daughter Sophie is about the same early-adolescent age as Hanna, and Sophie's little brother is immediately taken with our pretty and daring protagonist.  The family is determinedly accepting of differences of all kinds, and the parents encourage their children to be independent.  Even they, however, can't help but notice that Hanna is, well, special.The hippie family provides aid and comfort for Hanna when she needs it most, and the cleverly written story, along with remarkably capable actors, avoids annoying stereotypes that often emerge when dealing with '60's throwbacks.  Sophie, Hanna's first real friend, is naturally articulate, self-assured beyond her years, and genuinely funny.  Even Sophie, however, is stunned and frightened when she sees for herself what Hanna does to  survive the onslaught of the nefarious bureaucrat, Marissa, and her hired assassins, be they jack-booted thugs or more than a little effeminate impresarios.Cate Blanchett is perhaps a bit too bland, maybe even wooden, as an amoral government official.  Throughout the movie her voice and accent change in ways and for reasons that are not explained.  Erik Bana does a fine job as Hanna's father, as tough as he has to be, but also genuinely loving.  His role, too, could have easily collapsed into a tough-but-tender stereotype, but Bana is a better actor than that, and he's working with a really nice screenplay.The movie does not take itself too seriously, and neither should we.  Hanna is a fun movie, loaded with excitement, none of which seems gratuitous.  Nothing deep or profound here, just a good story, even if it is a bit outlandish, with a lot of action and a really fine cast.  Just relax and enjoy it.

1454315,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B005CMSDKA,Only-A-Child,"[0, 1]","""Hanna"" is basically a strange blend of ""The Golden Compass"" (2007) and ""The Passenger"" (1975); with a little ""THX 1138"" (1971) thrown in for production design and atmospheric purposes.Had ""Hanna"" (2011) been promoted for what it was, a relatively low-budget, live-action, PG-13 allegorical fairy tale; with a uniquely quirky performance by Saoirse Ronan, it would be better regarded by the movie going public. Rather than the minimalist promotion and distribution this type of film normally receives, for some reason the distributors decided that it had the potential to make big money.So they threw almost as much money into marketing as had gone into production, sold the film as an action adventure suspenseful spy story, with another Chloe Moritz type hit girl.  They utilized a saturation booking technique normally reserved for their weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre-release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theaters, with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance.The result was a lot of viewers who rightly felt that the film did not live up to its blockbuster billing, and a failure to appreciate the good points of the film. And there are some very good points. Ronan's earnest portrayal of the title character, a juvenile assassin and good daughter, rings true despite being unlike any character in cinema history.  Ronan manages to blend a bubbly enthusiasm for the newness of everything she missed growing up away from the world (think of a younger version of the Anne Francis ""Alta"" character in ""Forbidden Planet"") with the deadly but ""fish-out-of-water"" qualities of Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""new-to-20th Century-earth"" robot in ""Terminator 2"" (1991).  Ronan has effectively played the bubbly stuff before, most notably in ""City Of Ember"" (2008).  In ""Hanna"" she effortlessly slips back and forth between bubbly wonderment and analytic processing.  These contrasting personas are delivered so effectively (and in so many languages) that the overall performance ranks among the best in cinema history.And credit director Joe Wright with the vision to stage sequences and POV shots that make Hanna small and vulnerable, enough so to evoke a feeling of protectiveness toward her from viewers.  Altman's ""Kansas City"" (1996) comes to mind, in which Jennifer Jason Leigh's tough talking gun moll created a powerful bond of identification with the viewing audience.The film is a fairy tale and the good vs evil dynamic is more allegorical than precise.  Cate Blanchett plays a high level CIA operative who functions as the wicked witch.  Basically Snow White's evil queen step-mother masquerading as a cross between the Rosa Klebbs character in ""From Russia With Love"" (1963) and Nicole Kidman's character in ""Golden Compass"" (in fact Kidman's ""Goldren Compass"" character was also named Marisa).  She is assisted by the versatile Tom Hollander, a Wright regular (Mr. Collins from ""Pride & Prejudice"").  Blanchett's Marissa is evil and menacing without the redemption dimensionality of Kidman's ""Golden Compass"" Marisa.  Wright could have had much more fun with Hollander's character, but even so the minion is far more effective than his distaff master.Wright is not trying to be plausible, if anything the story is more expressionism than realism.  This becomes especially obvious late in the film when the action switches to the huge abandoned Spreepark entertainment center in Berlin.  The park was closed in 1999 and the decaying fairy tale related rides and attractions are a production designer's dream.  These become a key motif of the film, much like the abandoned Salt Air Pavilion in ""Carnival of Souls"".  Also watch for the existential connection between Hanna and Laika, the Soviet dog-in-space;  torn from their world to be passengers through a world in which they do not belong.Bottom line, I am going to recommend the film.  But with the advice to watch it for Ronan's performance and for its uniqueness; and to not try to place it into any neat classification.Then again, what do I know"", I'm only a child.",4,Unique,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,4125,"['Hanna', 'basically', 'strange', 'blend', 'Golden', 'Compass', '2007', 'Passenger', '1975', 'little', 'THX', '1138', '1971', 'thrown', 'production', 'design', 'atmospheric', 'purposes.Had', 'Hanna', '2011', 'been', 'promoted', 'what', 'was', 'relatively', 'low-budget', 'live-action', 'PG-13', 'allegorical', 'fairy', 'tale', 'uniquely', 'quirky', 'performance', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'regarded', 'movie', 'going', 'public', 'Rather', 'minimalist', 'promotion', 'distribution', 'type', 'film', 'normally', 'reason', 'distributors', 'decided', 'had', 'potential', 'make', 'big', 'money.So', 'threw', 'almost', 'much', 'money', 'marketing', 'had', 'gone', 'production', 'sold', 'film', 'action', 'adventure', 'suspenseful', 'spy', 'story', 'Chloe', 'Moritz', 'type', 'hit', 'girl', 'utilized', 'saturation', 'booking', 'technique', 'normally', 'reserved', 'weaker', 'blockbusters', 'technique', 'lot', 'pre-release', 'publicity', 'then', 'opening', 'simultaneously', 'many', 'theaters', 'goal', 'generating', 'quick', 'profits', 'bad', 'reviews', 'word', 'mouth', 'kill', 'attendance.The', 'result', 'was', 'lot', 'viewers', 'who', 'rightly', 'felt', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'blockbuster', 'billing', 'failure', 'appreciate', 'good', 'points', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'points', 'Ronan', 'earnest', 'portrayal', 'title', 'character', 'juvenile', 'assassin', 'good', 'daughter', 'rings', 'true', 'being', 'character', 'cinema', 'history', 'Ronan', 'blend', 'bubbly', 'enthusiasm', 'newness', 'everything', 'missed', 'growing', 'up', 'away', 'world', 'think', 'younger', 'version', 'Anne', 'Francis', 'Alta', 'character', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', 'deadly', 'fish-out-of-water', 'qualities', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'new-to-20th', 'Century-earth', 'robot', 'Terminator', '2', '1991', 'Ronan', 'effectively', 'played', 'bubbly', 'stuff', 'most', 'notably', 'City', 'Ember', '2008', 'Hanna', 'effortlessly', 'back', 'forth', 'bubbly', 'wonderment', 'analytic', 'processing', 'contrasting', 'personas', 'are', 'delivered', 'so', 'effectively', 'so', 'many', 'languages', 'overall', 'performance', 'ranks', 'best', 'cinema', 'history.And', 'credit', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'vision', 'stage', 'sequences', 'POV', 'shots', 'make', 'Hanna', 'small', 'vulnerable', 'enough', 'so', 'evoke', 'feeling', 'protectiveness', 'viewers', 'Altman', 'Kansas', 'City', '1996', 'mind', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'tough', 'talking', 'gun', 'moll', 'created', 'powerful', 'bond', 'identification', 'viewing', 'audience.The', 'film', 'fairy', 'tale', 'good', 'vs', 'evil', 'dynamic', 'more', 'allegorical', 'precise', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'high', 'level', 'CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'wicked', 'witch', 'Basically', 'Snow', 'White', 'evil', 'queen', 'step-mother', 'masquerading', 'cross', 'Rosa', 'Klebbs', 'character', 'Russia', 'Love', '1963', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'fact', 'Kidman', 'Goldren', 'Compass', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'named', 'Marisa', 'assisted', 'versatile', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'Wright', 'regular', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Blanchett', 'Marissa', 'evil', 'menacing', 'redemption', 'dimensionality', 'Kidman', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'Marisa', 'Wright', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'Hollander', 'character', 'even', 'minion', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'distaff', 'master.Wright', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'plausible', 'anything', 'story', 'more', 'expressionism', 'realism', 'especially', 'obvious', 'late', 'film', 'when', 'action', 'huge', 'abandoned', 'Spreepark', 'entertainment', 'center', 'Berlin', 'park', 'was', 'closed', '1999', 'decaying', 'fairy', 'tale', 'related', 'rides', 'attractions', 'are', 'production', 'designer', 'dream', 'become', 'key', 'motif', 'film', 'much', 'abandoned', 'Salt', 'Air', 'Pavilion', 'Carnival', 'Souls', 'Also', 'watch', 'existential', 'connection', 'Hanna', 'Laika', 'Soviet', 'dog-in-space', 'torn', 'world', 'be', 'passengers', 'world', 'do', 'not', 'belong.Bottom', 'line', 'am', 'going', 'recommend', 'film', 'advice', 'watch', 'Ronan', 'performance', 'uniqueness', 'not', 'try', 'place', 'neat', 'classification.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",N/A

Probably their best work.The film is very original and tells a story of a young girl, Hanna, who was raised by her father and trained to fight and support herself. They live out in the middle of nowhere, they hunt their own food and are cut off from any civilization. Hanna is curious as to the outside world and music and people, however he father discourages her of this. After a while her father presents a box with a switch to Hanna. He further explains that someone will come to find them if she flips the switch. She of course flips it and teams of bad guys and helicopters show up. The father takes off and leaves Hanna to fend for herself. She is captured and taken to a facility, but is that part of the plan?Over-all Hanna blew me away. It is original, however ideals from past films do shine through the plot at times. The cinematography is superb and the music is very well built into the actions on the screen.

I had only seen the trailer once and barely remembered what was shown. And, I saw this in the D-BOX section of the screening room, which means motion seats. I'd figured this movie was pretty exciting if it was gonna be shown in D-box.And, as a result, it was. This is definitely the best movie to be released so far this year. There's a lot of garbage floating out there like ""Your Highness"" and ""Red Riding Hood"". Finally, a movie that is equally as thought-provoking as it is action packed and thrilling.Hanna is a 14 year old girl, an assassin since a child. She lives with her father, Erik, in a hut in the woods, who has trained her to be an assassin, and has kept her in the woods from day one, after the murder of the mother. As the film starts, ""the time is right""- Hanna is ready to see the outside world, and so Erik sends her on a mission to meet him in Berlin... and to help successfully get revenge on Marissa, an American intelligence agent bent on killing both Hanna and Erik.And that's all you need to know- because Hanna is a high-octane, gripping, and totally action-packed movie that, the less you knew about, the more you will enjoy it.Saoirse Ronan is just insanely amazing as the titular character. I'll be honest, I liked her more than Chloe Moertz in Kick-Ass. I was not surprised to find out she did most of the action herself, because I swear, it was just a thrill to watch. Cate Blanchett is stunning, hilarious, and sexy in her role as Marissa- and her southern drawl is great!!!! I actually thought she did a fantastic job. But, the real show-stealer is Eric Bana. He was a total badass, his performance was just fantastic and he seemed really into it.In addition, the cinematography is great too. Gorgeous scenery and good camera work in the action scenes too- even the rather gimmicky upside down shots were great. The suspense is high throughout, there's a LOT of suspense, and the last 20 minutes are an intense nail biter, especially the twist ending.Oh, and in addition, if this is playing in a D-box theatre near you, see it. The motion seats just add to the intensity of the film.In short, do not miss this intense experience.

1454333,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B005CMSDKA,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","HANNA is a great example of a film where style and attitude trumps (or nearly) substance and logic. It's a super-cool looking movie that feels like it is better than it really is.Young Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, THE LOVELY BONES) gives an MVP performance as a teen-age killer. Raised since she was a baby by Erik (Eric Bana) her father in the middle of what looks like northern Finland...she knows almost nothing of how life works in the civilized world. Growing up in a wild, snow-shrouded environ, Erik has taught her everything she needs to know about hand-to-hand combat, firearms, bows & arrows, etc., as well as given her an education in languages and practically encouraged her to memorize an encyclopedia. Erik, you see, is a former CIA agent who is on the run from his bosses, because he ""knows too much"" about some nefarious and unsavory program. He's raising Hanna to be able to survive on her own, because one day, he knows they'll be separated and she needs to be prepared to fight her way to freedom.That day comes when Hanna insists she's ready to live in the real world. So Erik pulls out a homing beacon that basically tells his pursuers exactly where to find him and when they show up, Erik has already fled, but Hanna turns herself over to them. It's never explained why they feel they must take such a loud, noisy, bloody re-entry into society...except that apparently it's worth risking both their lives to try to kill Erik's former boss/handler, Marissa (Cate Blanchett).Hanna DOES escape, in grand style, and begins her journey to reunite with her father. Along the way, she is befriended by various colorful ""ordinary"" people and we see how ill-prepared Hanna is to interact with society. She's smart & dangerous, but also touchingly helpless and nave. She is pursued by some nasty characters (this movie does NOT make Germans or Germany look very appealing) as she flees from Morocco to Berlin.A few folks have compared Ronan to the killer girl played by Chloe Grace-Moretz in KICK-A**...but they similarities are very slender. Moretz was a fast -and-foul talking little sparkplug, world-wise and eager to pile up bodies. Hanna is slow to speech and is wild-eyed and wondering at the world.This is Ronan's movie and she totally steals it. She is a totally striking figure, in her nearly white hair and white eyebrows, with piercing eyes. But she continues to amaze as an actress as well...totally convincing as a killer, but also believable as just a teenager who has led a sheltered life. This character is very interesting & engaging, and we root for her.Bana is fairly bland, but the role is bland. Blanchett is over-the-top, and proves once and for all (after INDIANA JONES) that she is NOT cut out to play a cartoonish villainess. She puts on a terrible Southern accent and gives a performance utterly without menace. I normally love her, but she was quite terrible in HANNA. (I did enjoy Tom Hollander as the primary assassin chasing Hanna. He brought a convincing level of creepiness to his performance.)Director Joe Wright uses his exotic locations well and stages some nifty little action scenes. There are a lot of shots of Hanna simply running with great urgency, but they reminded me of Franka Potente in RUN LOLA RUN...gripping in their simplicity.But behind the style, I found a frustrating plot. Motivations were often sketchy. Characters behaved in ways that didn't entirely make sense. The bad guys seemed more adept at crossing the globe than was reasonable. And this is one of those films where MANY innocent people die so that just two people can live. Hanna and her father are not important enough to justify the deaths and torturing of so many others...especially folks who befriend Hanna only to die painfully later.And the climax of the film lacks punch. The best action sequences come early. I know the end is supposed to have more emotional heft, but because we don't really care that much about the Blanchett & Bana, the lack of a really spectacular climactic chase or battle really left me with a deflated feeling when the credits began to roll.But the character of Hanna and the performance of Ronan make the movie worth seeing.

1454334,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005CMSDKA,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","&lt;strong>Hanna&lt;/strong> (Joe Wright, 2011)&lt;em>Hanna&lt;/em> was one of my favorite films of 2011, among the relatively few that I have so far seen, so I have no idea why it has taken me so long to actually get around to reviewing it. (And it's third on the list; there are two films I saw before this one I haven't reviewed yet. Sheesh.) Some movies just have to percolate for a long, long time, I guess. Maybe because this is so far removed from the types of things I usually watch, which break down into ""Hollywood blockbusters"" and ""stuff no one's ever heard of before."" &lt;em>Hanna&lt;/em>, from what little publicity it received, seemed as if it was of the latter variety, but at the eleventh hour got a push from the distributor to try and turn it into the former. It still has the feel of a small indie film, albeit a brilliantly-shot one with much-nominated director Joe Wright (&lt;em>Atonement&lt;/em>) at the helm and a cast stuffed so full of award-winning actors it sometimes felt as if the entire thing would burst at the seams from all the OMGIMPORTANT. And yet, at no point did it ever feel pretentious or overblown or... Hollywood. Even had it not been all that good a film, that sense alone would have endeared me to it. But good it is.Plot: Hanna (Saoirse Ronan, who worked with Wright on &lt;em>Atonement&lt;/em>) is a thirteen-year-old girl living in the middle of nowhere with her father (&lt;em>Chopper&lt;/em>'s Eric Bana), a former secret agent who spends his days training his daughter to survive in the world. Problem is, he only knows his own way of doing so, so he's also training her to be, essentially, an assassin. Well, the inevitable happens, his old friends track him down, and he sends Hanna off on a trans-Europe run, being chased by those same operatives, headed up by dad's former boss, the enigmatic Marissa (Cate Blanchett). Do I need to tell you anything else for you to know the entire movie is a setup for a confrontation between Hanna and Marissa? Not if you've watched half a dozen spy thrillers in your life, I don't. But Seth Lochhead's script is entirely unafraid to go places that normal spy thrillers don't, but that make perfect sense given the age and sex of the protagonist (who is, at best, a charming sociopath for whom ""socalized"" may be a word she encountered in the dictionary once), including hooking up for part of her journey with a loud, blowsy British family whose daughter, Sophie (&lt;em>Tamara Drewe&lt;/em>'s Jessica Barden), is actually the undiscovered jewel of this film, a brash young actress whose considerable skills enable her to shine in a film containing, well, Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett.The best thing to do with &lt;em>Hanna&lt;/em> is to not take it too seriously. At its heart, this is a simple genre spy thriller with a twist, not some art film with Oscar pretensions. And yet still, there are places where this movie transcends. Most notable is the incredible cinematography courtesy DP Alwin Kuchler (&lt;em>Sunshine&lt;/em>); this is a movie that feels just at home in the trackless wastes of Norway as it does, in one memorable scene, inside a bullet hole. (It makes up for the somewhat woeful Chemical Brothers soundtrack, the movie's one real weakness.) The principal actors all bring their A games, and Lochhead's script is a lot of fun; if you missed this one the first time round, see it--but try to catch it on the big screen so you can soak in all that great camerawork. *** ",4,Solid genre thriller with a twist.,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,3484,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Hanna', 'lt', '>', 'Joe', 'Wright', '2011', 'lt', '>', 'Hanna', 'lt', '>', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2011', 'relatively', 'few', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'seen', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'actually', 'get', 'reviewing', 'third', 'list', 'are', 'two', 'films', 'saw', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'reviewed', 'yet', 'Sheesh', 'movies', 'just', 'have', 'percolate', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'guess', 'Maybe', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'types', 'things', 'usually', 'watch', 'break', 'down', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'stuff', 'one', 'ever', 'heard', 'before', 'lt', '>', 'Hanna', 'lt', '>', 'what', 'little', 'publicity', 'received', 'seemed', 'was', 'latter', 'variety', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'got', 'push', 'distributor', 'try', 'turn', 'former', 'still', 'feel', 'small', 'indie', 'film', 'brilliantly-shot', 'one', 'much-nominated', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'lt', '>', 'Atonement', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'helm', 'cast', 'stuffed', 'full', 'award-winning', 'actors', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'entire', 'thing', 'would', 'burst', 'seams', 'OMGIMPORTANT', 'yet', 'point', 'did', 'ever', 'feel', 'pretentious', 'overblown', 'Hollywood', 'Even', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'sense', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'endeared', 'good', 'Hanna', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'who', 'worked', 'Wright', 'lt', '>', 'Atonement', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'thirteen-year-old', 'girl', 'living', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'father', 'lt', '>', 'Chopper', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'former', 'secret', 'agent', 'who', 'days', 'training', 'daughter', 'survive', 'world', 'Problem', 'only', 'own', 'way', 'doing', 'so', 'also', 'training', 'be', 'essentially', 'assassin', 'Well', 'inevitable', 'happens', 'old', 'friends', 'track', 'down', 'Hanna', 'off', 'trans-Europe', 'run', 'being', 'chased', 'same', 'operatives', 'headed', 'up', 'dad', 'former', 'boss', 'enigmatic', 'Marissa', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Do', 'need', 'tell', 'anything', 'else', 'know', 'entire', 'movie', 'setup', 'confrontation', 'Hanna', 'Marissa', 'Not', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'dozen', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'Seth', 'Lochhead', 'script', 'entirely', 'unafraid', 'go', 'places', 'normal', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'given', 'age', 'sex', 'protagonist', 'who', 'best', 'charming', 'sociopath', 'whom', 'socalized', 'may', 'be', 'word', 'encountered', 'dictionary', 'once', 'including', 'hooking', 'up', 'part', 'journey', 'loud', 'blowsy', 'British', 'family', 'daughter', 'Sophie', 'lt', '>', 'Tamara', 'Drewe', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Jessica', 'Barden', 'actually', 'undiscovered', 'jewel', 'film', 'brash', 'young', 'actress', 'considerable', 'skills', 'enable', 'shine', 'film', 'containing', 'well', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'Cate', 'Blanchett.The', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'lt', '>', 'Hanna', 'lt', '>', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'heart', 'simple', 'genre', 'spy', 'thriller', 'twist', 'not', 'art', 'film', 'Oscar', 'pretensions', 'yet', 'still', 'are', 'places', 'where', 'movie', 'Most', 'notable', 'incredible', 'cinematography', 'courtesy', 'DP', 'Alwin', 'Kuchler', 'lt', '>', 'Sunshine', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'movie', 'just', 'home', 'trackless', 'wastes', 'Norway', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'bullet', 'hole', 'up', 'somewhat', 'woeful', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'one', 'real', 'weakness', 'principal', 'actors', 'bring', 'games', 'Lochhead', 'script', 'lot', 'fun', 'missed', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'round', 'see', 'try', 'catch', 'big', 'screen', 'can', 'soak', 'great', 'camerawork', '***']",N/A

Some for television. Some for both. Some from literature. None of these lists included Hanna, and for that, I think they are all lacking. Yes, even the literature lists should have included Hanna; she's that kick butt! In fact, she's so kick butt, I'm sure that that's where that movie came from. Someone said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie about a young girl that can kick butt like no body's business!""Someone else tried to ruin  the party by saying, ""But, wait, why can she kick so much butt?""And that's where it all fell apart.The movie, Hanna, is strung together on the very thinnest of plots. I mean Run, Lola, Run thin, but that one works better, because that's all the movie's supposed to be about. But the makers of Hanna, evidently, wanted the movie to appear as if it contains substance, so they tried to write a story as to why Hanna can and does kick so much butt. And I say makers, because I have no idea who might be at fault for this ill-conceived notion. Was it just bad writing from the start? Did the director dispense with the story in favor of the action? Did the producers demand it? Also, speaking of Lola, and I didn't time it, but I would guess somewhere close to 1/3 of Hanna is actually just music video of (mostly) her just running. Or crawling. Being chased, at any rate. Sometimes it's Erik.Having said all of that, if you like a good action flick and don't need much story, it's a great movie. My friend, who took me to see it, certainly liked it much better than I did. The fight scenes are well done, and there's plenty of suspense wrapped up in the action. And running. Lots of running. And I bet the director or the writer or someone thought they were being very clever by wrapping the movies ending up in a circle to tie it back to the opening. Oh, but wait, I'm letting my antipathy for the story slip back in there.The biggest issue with the story is that it resorts to the ""big reveal"" in order to explain the story all at once because it failed to provide the viewers with enough information as the movie progressed to figure anything out on  their own. Really, I hate this. Especially since they could have allowed us the information throughout the movie by cutting out 10 minutes of running.There was one other very positive aspect of Hanna: the acting. Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett are both excellent. In fact, they are the two characters that give the movie any sort of depth and weight. Saoirse Ronan (Hanna) does a fine job, but I haven't seen her in anything else, so I'm not sure if it was acting ability or just the way she is.",2,action over story,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,2702,"['past', 'week', 'so', ""'ve"", 'come', 'several', 'lists', 'toughest', 'chicks', 'fiction', 'were', 'chicks', 'movies', 'television', 'literature', 'None', 'lists', 'included', 'Hanna', 'think', 'are', 'lacking', 'Yes', 'even', 'literature', 'lists', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'Hanna', 'kick', 'butt', 'fact', 'so', 'kick', 'butt', ""'m"", 'sure', 'where', 'movie', 'came', 'Someone', 'said', 'Hey', 'Let', 'make', 'movie', 'young', 'girl', 'can', 'kick', 'butt', 'body', 'business', 'Someone', 'else', 'tried', 'ruin', 'party', 'saying', 'wait', 'why', 'can', 'kick', 'so', 'much', 'butt', 'where', 'fell', 'apart.The', 'movie', 'Hanna', 'strung', 'together', 'very', 'thinnest', 'plots', 'mean', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'thin', 'one', 'better', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'makers', 'Hanna', 'evidently', 'wanted', 'movie', 'appear', 'substance', 'tried', 'write', 'story', 'why', 'Hanna', 'can', 'kick', 'so', 'much', 'butt', 'say', 'makers', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'fault', 'ill-conceived', 'notion', 'Was', 'just', 'bad', 'writing', 'start', 'Did', 'director', 'dispense', 'story', 'favor', 'action', 'producers', 'demand', 'Also', 'speaking', 'Lola', 'did', ""n't"", 'time', 'would', 'guess', 'somewhere', 'close', '1/3', 'Hanna', 'actually', 'just', 'music', 'video', 'mostly', 'just', 'running', 'crawling', 'Being', 'chased', 'rate', 'Erik.Having', 'said', 'like', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'story', 'great', 'movie', 'friend', 'who', 'took', 'see', 'certainly', 'liked', 'much', 'better', 'did', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'wrapped', 'up', 'action', 'running', 'Lots', 'running', 'bet', 'director', 'writer', 'someone', 'thought', 'were', 'being', 'very', 'clever', 'wrapping', 'movies', 'ending', 'up', 'circle', 'tie', 'back', 'opening', 'Oh', 'wait', ""'m"", 'letting', 'antipathy', 'story', 'slip', 'back', 'there.The', 'biggest', 'issue', 'story', 'big', 'reveal', 'order', 'explain', 'story', 'once', 'failed', 'provide', 'viewers', 'enough', 'information', 'movie', 'progressed', 'figure', 'anything', 'out', 'own', 'Really', 'hate', 'Especially', 'could', 'have', 'allowed', 'information', 'movie', 'cutting', 'out', '10', 'minutes', 'running.There', 'was', 'one', 'other', 'very', 'positive', 'aspect', 'Hanna', 'acting', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'are', 'excellent', 'fact', 'are', 'two', 'characters', 'give', 'movie', 'sort', 'depth', 'weight', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'Hanna', 'fine', 'job', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'else', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'acting', 'ability', 'just', 'way']",N/A

Her DNA was altered to eliminate compassion, pity, etc. and make her stronger with increased mental focus, so 90 lbs of Hanna Heller equals 1 grown up Jason Bourne.She kills in self defence, and I have to admit, while I cheered for her, knocking off CIA operatives who should be chasing down Al-Qaeda terrorists instead, had me conflicted.  But those CIA operatives were scum of the earth while the soldiers were pawns who would kill tribal leaders while hunting insurgents; it is after all, a rogue operation which is why Marissa hires Isaacs (""Why do you want me?""  Marissa: ""The CIA won't let me do some things"", or something like that).Many viewers couldn't accept the ""reason"" for the 14-year hunt for Eric & Hanna Heller, but the same story line exists with 3 Jason Bourne movies so just believe that if the CIA wants you dead, they won't forget.  It is a bit weak as Marissa, 14 years ago, seems to be just a field assassin.  Marissa looks hot, and would probably bother a lot of male spymasters.Right after her escape from the CIA compound in the middle of the No. African desert (does Morocco know about it), Hanna comes in contact with everyday life and real people for the first time after leaving the Finland artic cocoon.  The Spanish boy will now learn not to grab girls inappropriately.  It also humanizes her for the audience, and you want her to win and thrive, I did, at least.At the end, everybody dies but Hanna  . . . horray, but what becomes of her ?  bleeding from a bullet in her side, and ""father"" and grandmother also dead.

1454365,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B005CMSDKA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[25, 31]","4 1/2 StarsI liked this film. I liked it a lot.Come to think of it, I like all of director Joe Wright's films. Each seems to be crafted by someone who is truly in love with the art of filmmaking. This would seem like a prerequisite for any film, but sadly, I don't believe it is. Beginning with his version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" in 2005, through ""Atonement"", ""The Soloist"" and now ""Hanna"", he brings a unique sensibility to each, giving each film a different look, a different feel and a different style. While he makes each film unique, he also uses enough of the genre or theme to make it recognizable, allowing our vision of these stories to expand along with him. I mean, it would be pretty silly to watch a version of ""Pride"" that doesn't at least acknowledge the source material by Jane Austen. But Wright is smart enough to realize he can only push the envelope so far and shows some restraint.Hanna (Saoirse Ronan, ""Atonement"") has been raised in the forest by her father, Erik (Eric Bana). They spend their days and nights together in a small cabin living about as far off the grid as humanly possible. Erik spends his time training Hanna to survive; they engage in elaborate fights, hunt, learn to survive in the tundra, teaching Hanna to become strong, to fight against the best of them. Her skill set is amazing, wide and varied, but as a sixteen-year-old teenage girl, she begins to miss something in her life. As she asks questions, Erik begins to realize what she wants. One day, he digs up a small beacon he buried long ago and brings it back to the cabin. If Hanna really wants to see the real world, all she has to do is turn the beacon on. As soon as she does this, Marissa Vigler (Cate Blanchett), a CIA operative, will begin to hunt them. A couple of days later, Erik returns from a hunt to find the beacon blinking. They make arrangements to meet in Berlin and he is off. Hanna waits and soon, a helicopter arrives. She puts up token resistance and soon finds herself in a strange holding facility. She asks to speak with Marissa Vigler and all hell breaks loose.An interesting thing to note about this film is that the screenplay by Seth Lochhead and David Farr (who wrote some episodes of the British TV series ""MI: 5"") was listed on both the 2006 and 2009 Blacklist, an annual list of the best-unproduced screenplays circulating in Hollywood. It is kind of easy to see why this screenplay was not immediately snapped up and produced. ""Hanna"" is a character-driven action film. Most action films are story-driven and directors embrace this because it gives them an excuse to blow up buildings and to choreograph elaborate action sequences. In ""Hanna"", the characters are the heart of the story, and we spend a lot of time with them, learning about them, watching them navigate this world. There are some terrific action set-pieces, but they aren't the main focus of the film. In fact, in a couple of these, the director seems to believe they aren't important to the characters and we watch only the aftermath of the fight before it. We'll return to this later. But I feel like story-driven action films are more popular, more acceptable for most filmmakers because they don't have to spend too much time on character development, they can concentrate their energy on elaborate explosions, kick-ass car chases and fancy fights.Joe Wright deserves a lot of credit for recognizing how well-written and how unique this story is and for sticking to the strange and unusual aspect of the screenplay.There are a lot of unusual touches to the visuals of this story. From the very beginning, when we first join Hanna and Erik in the snow-bound forest, everything appears almost monochromatic. They are living in a world blanketed with white and the wood and animal skins surrounding them provide dark, vibrant slashes of black and gray. Both Hanna and Erik are very pale, their wild hair frequently covered with snow. Even after Hanna is captured and taken to the holding facility, the images remain monochromatic. But now, everything is very gray (lots of concrete and metal) and orange (the surrounding desert and her prison garb, for lack of a better word). As the story moves to Morocco, then France, then Berlin, Hanna seems to find herself in dirty, unkempt areas. Especially when she gets to Berlin, the area she populates seems uncared for, nothing has been painted in a many years and seems faded of all vitality. It is an easier place to go unnoticed. This also helps to carry on with the washed out, monochromatic feel of the film.When Hanna is held in the unknown facility, it appears like it was originally constructed in the 70s, lots of curves and circular shapes, everything appears a little grimy. This gives us the message she is in a facility that hasn't been used in a while, and now seems to be dusting off the cobwebs. When she eventually escapes, Wright embraces the nature of the facility and really throws us into a different kind of action film. He creates a montage of incredibly brief shots and very quick editing to give us more of a feel of her escape. This sequence seems to pay homage to films of the 70s, borrowing the same sort of editing aesthetic Kubrik, Friedkin and Yates might have used. Lots of brief shots, lots of close-ups of shapes and images, blurry transitions, shots turning and twisting. In a way, this aesthetic also helps us remember that Hanna is new to this world and everything must seem strange and new to her.Because Wright is more interested in the characters, he spends a lot of time with Hanna and Erik, establishing who they are, what makes them interesting. There are moments of violence, of fighting, but these seem abbreviated somehow. As mentioned before, in many instances, we witness the aftermath of a fight or a violent episode. This does two things. First, it allows our mind to fill in the details of what happened just before. Generally, our minds will fill in more graphic details, more blood, so this is an effective technique to get us involved in the story. It is the same technique that makes a good horror film good. When we don't see everything in explicit detail, our mind fills in the blanks, making it scarier. Second, it reminds us the characters are king and in control of the story in this film.When we do see the action, it is top notch. Hanna's escape from the holding facility is fast-paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Various fist fights are elaborately choreographed and interesting. A gun battle is very quick and leaves your heart racing.But Wright is clearly more interested in character. After Hanna escapes the holding facility, she walks through the Moroccan desert and happens upon a British family traveling in an old caravan. Dad (Jason Flemyng) and Mom (Olivia Williams) are eager for their children, Sophie (Jessica Barden), a teenager trying to live beyond her years, and Miles (Aldo Maland), to live a rich life in the country, full of travel. When Hanna and Sophie meet, Sophie seems to consider this new, unusual friend a trophy and she wants her around for a while. This sequence of the film seems to diverge from the real story. Hanna basically lives with them for a while as they travel. And as this seems to go on forever, a realization happens. Hanna is learning how to be a, more of less, normal teenage girl from Sophie. It actually works and gives us a deeper feeling for Hanna.Also, during this sequence, Wright continues to revisit Erik, Marissa and a strange German assassin played by Tom Hollander, keeping us grounded  and making the sequence seem more integrated into Hanna and Erik's story.Saoirse Ronan is really good as Hanna. She is mature beyond her years but also nave and lacking in the life experiences most of us have in their first sixteen years. Because of this, Hanna is unsure of most of what she is experiencing as soon as she enters the real world. But she knows Marissa is out to get her, so with every challenge she adapts quickly and moves on.Ronan shows us all of Hanna's vulnerabilities while demonstrating her unique skills. One moment, she may be staring wide-eyed at a television because it is the first one she has ever seen. The next, she is running through a maze of shipping containers trying to elude a trio of assassins. This duality runs throughout the film and helps us get a better picture of this very mature young lady who can kill people with her bare hands yet wonders what the world really holds for her.Eric Bana is good as Erik. He is a strange fellow and we wonder for quite a while why he has brought his daughter to this small cabin in the woods, to raise her in such extreme isolation. There are a couple of flashbacks giving us the back-story to his character and his relationship with Marissa. A highly efficient killer, he has confidence in his daughter's ability to survive.Blanchett plays Marissa Vigler, a CIA operative who is working for and towards her own agenda. As she tracks Hanna and Erik, we learn about their relationship and the reasons for her nearly psychotic determination. She really wants to get to Erik and Hanna and we get the sense that much of this is due to her personal relationship with them. She is holding a grudge or wants to clean up a mistake and will stop at nothing until she reaches her goals.Blanchett is great. Using a sort of Southern twang, you never, ever feel Marissa relaxes. Yes, she smiles and tries to be personable, but there always seems to be a tightly wound rubber band underneath, ready to snap.Wright quickly and efficiently convinces us of each character's determination to succeed, to beat their adversaries. This builds a lot of tension between the trio and helps to keep our attention riveted to the screen.""Hanna"" is a real treat. A character-driven action film filled with interesting, unusual performances and a hybrid visual style.

But that might have made for a more interesting movie.  I don't know.  This movie is about Johanna (Saoirse Ronan, doing a good job playing her part as a wide-eyed naif who has learned about but not experienced the world), a young teenage girl who has been trained to be a super soldier ostensibly in order to assassinate the woman who killed her mum and will kill her if she were to learn of her existence (Kate Blanchett, wearing a cropped red wig that rather suits her, and dropping in and out of a southern, Texas-style accent which is very distracting).  Hanna's educated and deadly father (Eric Bana as Erik Heller) trains her in the arctic, in a harsh environment devoid of distraction and requiring individual determinedness, self-reliance, and focus in order to survive.  When Hanna is ready to venture out on her quest and put her training to the test she crosses paths with not only her nemesis but also a contract killer and a free-roaming hippie British family, the daughter of which becomes Hanna's friend.  In the end Hanna learns who she is and why she is...a disturbing revelation that doesn't seem to hit her that hard and, because of how the movie ends (much like it started...I won't give it away) we are left to wonder what will happen to the girl.What makes this movie unique is not its female protagonist but her potential in the face of her lack of wordly experience.  There is a scene where she comes into contact with a variety of electrical items (light, fan, TV, coffepot) and it overwhelms her and she doesn't know what to do.  The scene is not played for comedy and has an unusual and memorable feel to it.  She also has some normalish teenage experiences with a Brit girl that befriends her and there is some tenderness played in these scenes.  Saoirse has a natural beauty that is on display and looks appropriately young, that is until she is put into light makeup, and then she looks like she's about to turn 20.  Also unique is the ending that takes place in a closed down theme park that feels surreal.  Blanchett's villain, Marissa Weigler, is dubious in that you can understand how she is the villain and yet at the same time the writers don't give her an underhanded verve or style with which to play off of and Blanchett doesn't manage a convincing style on her own.  Overall the movie doesn't mount to much but you may end up appreciating it all the same.  3.5 stars.",3,Individual moments add flavor to a movie that doesn't end up amounting to much.,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,2560,"['surprising', 'sequel', 'Woody', 'Allen', '1986', 'drama', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'titular', 'heroine', 'kill', 'closest', 'kid', 'course', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'Johanna', 'Saoirse', 'Ronan', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'part', 'wide-eyed', 'naif', 'who', 'learned', 'not', 'experienced', 'world', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'trained', 'be', 'super', 'soldier', 'ostensibly', 'order', 'assassinate', 'woman', 'who', 'killed', 'mum', 'will', 'kill', 'were', 'learn', 'existence', 'Kate', 'Blanchett', 'wearing', 'cropped', 'red', 'wig', 'rather', 'suits', 'dropping', 'southern', 'Texas-style', 'accent', 'very', 'distracting', 'Hanna', 'educated', 'deadly', 'father', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Erik', 'Heller', 'arctic', 'harsh', 'environment', 'devoid', 'distraction', 'requiring', 'individual', 'determinedness', 'self-reliance', 'focus', 'order', 'survive', 'When', 'Hanna', 'ready', 'venture', 'out', 'quest', 'put', 'training', 'test', 'paths', 'not', 'only', 'nemesis', 'also', 'contract', 'killer', 'free-roaming', 'hippie', 'British', 'family', 'daughter', 'Hanna', 'friend', 'end', 'Hanna', 'who', 'why', 'disturbing', 'revelation', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hit', 'hard', 'how', 'movie', 'much', 'started', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'girl.What', 'movie', 'unique', 'not', 'female', 'protagonist', 'potential', 'face', 'lack', 'wordly', 'experience', 'scene', 'where', 'contact', 'variety', 'electrical', 'items', 'light', 'fan', 'TV', 'coffepot', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'scene', 'not', 'played', 'comedy', 'unusual', 'memorable', 'feel', 'also', 'normalish', 'teenage', 'experiences', 'Brit', 'girl', 'tenderness', 'played', 'scenes', 'Saoirse', 'natural', 'beauty', 'display', 'appropriately', 'young', 'put', 'light', 'makeup', 'then', 'turn', '20', 'Also', 'unique', 'ending', 'place', 'closed', 'down', 'theme', 'park', 'surreal', 'Blanchett', 'villain', 'Marissa', 'Weigler', 'dubious', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'villain', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'underhanded', 'verve', 'style', 'play', 'Blanchett', ""n't"", 'manage', 'convincing', 'style', 'own', 'movie', ""n't"", 'mount', 'much', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'appreciating', 'same', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

The film follows her submergence into our world once she goes to task.I read some of the negative reviews of this film before pulling the trigger and they actually pushed me towards the purchase.  Most of the bleating came from people advising me that the first thirty minutes housed the only scenes of real value and that the film went flaccid for the next hour.  That was exciting to me because I'm tired of watching car chases recycle themselves for hours on end while a soundtrack made up entirely of rapidly escalating explosions pounds like blistering techno until robots and/or trite superheroes show up and throw flaming meteorites at the scorched earth to attack/defend the human race.  I'm just tired of that stuff.But I still want action, and I got it.  In proper dosage, even.  The fight scenes choreographed for this film were presented at a heightened, but still reasonable human level and I appreciate that.  The director clearly wanted to keep the film on a more realistic track for its duration and there's some beauty in that.  The results were invigorating to me because I stayed connected which is a huge deal.  It was well done.That being said, the other elements in this film were also executed splendidly.  And yes, the movie does slow down, but not in a bad way.  A story develops, characters are introduced, and yes, I can live without gunfire for awhile while this all goes down.  I just don't see the problem.(Especially with the Chemical Brothers orchestrating the soundtrack?!  SCORE.)I think the only problem I had with the film was listening to Cate Blanchett with a southern accent.  Something just didn't feel right there.  Aside from that, however, the acting was stellar.In the end, I think I dug the movie because there's zero cheese.  None.And I need no cheese.- t",4,No CGI?

Unfortunately, it's just one of those film where all the good stuff is in the previews. Hanna is a special girl, wanted by The C.I.A., so since birth, her father hid her in a cabin in the North Pole. He trained her to be an ultimate weapon, to fight the people who sought her out, but as a result she had no idea about how the world worked. The only positive thing I could take away from this film was the performance of Saoirse Ronan, who was simply amazing. At 19, this girl isn't just a martial arts expert, but she speaks like a dozen languages. She is just as special and amazing as the character she was portraying and it's unfortunate that her skills were wasted in such a bomb of a movie. I don't think I've ever seen a slower moving, more boring action film in my life. Nothing is explained to you until much later on and by that point, you just really don't care anymore and want the film to be over. It's just one uncomfortable interaction after another, with seemingly no point, until the films disappointing climax. The actress was really talented and they could have done so much more with her, instead of putting her in a film, where she's running around like a chicken with her head cut off. I mean really, the story could not have been more thin and the supporting cast couldn't possibly have been any less helpful to the story.

The actors were great.  The music was HORRIBLE!!!  Reminded me of that European expiremental garbage.  Just didn't felt like a cheap movie soundtrack.  One review mentioned it was made by the ""The Chemical Brothers"".  They're name fits the music...""Toxic"".  One of the other movies I heard a soundtrack similar to this was on the ""Tron: Legacy"" movie.  But, that soundtrack flowed.  This one was just a lot of confusion.  At one point it sounded like the music was the sound in the movie, then I realized it was the song!!!The movie could've done without that little obnoxious girl she ended up ""befriending"".  Wow, what a weird family that was.  Product of hippie parents.  That whole little side-story really was unnecessary.I had never seen the girl that played ""Hannah"".  She was really good and believable.  Too bad she was a product of a bad film.  I don't know who to blame.  The Director, Producer, or Screenplay.  So, I'll blame them all.I do agree that the photography of the movie was excellent.  Great angles, shots, etc.The pace of the movie was slow and you wanted more action and intensity.  Unfortunately, you didn't get that.  The fight scenes you wanted to see more of.  They were just over too quickly.  I know that the movie was supposed to be more realistic, and not a Kung Fu movie per se.  But, it could have been done a little more interestingly.I really didn't like this movie.  But, that is just me.  I go more for substance of story and pace.  This movie had none of that.It reminded me of a bad version of ""The Professional"" with Natalie Portman.  Now that was a very good movie.  This one couldv'e been in that same level as story and production.  But, it fell very short.  My recommendation is to avoid this movie.It's PG-13, but I think it could've and should've been ""R"".  Some of the ""themes"" in that movie were more fitting for ""R"".

The task becomes even harder when the storyline is saddled with countless plot holes, incredible coincidences and impossible motives. Don't get me wrong. I know disregard to realistic possibility is not actually a bad thing, and I enjoyed such actions as ""The Long Kiss Good Night."" But in the case of ""Hanna,"" things just went too far.The film centers on a girl Hanna Heller (Saoirse Ronan), raised and home-schooled by her father Erik Heller (Eric Bana) in the wilderness of Finland. Under Erik's tutelage Hanna has been training more than ten years to be a perfect killing machine. Hanna is growing up fast, getting more and more interested in the world outside, and one day Erik asks her to make a decision. She does it, and deadly battles with CIA operatives begin, while she meets people including a traveling family in the desert.You can argue that ""Hanna"" is not really an action thriller, but a character-driven drama about the titular heroine like ""La Femme Nikita."" Some might find fairy-tale elements in some of the episodes and characters, and Cate Blanchett's wicked-witch like agent is one of them. To me, ""Hanna"" seems more like a pretentious effort from filmmakers who fail to realize the film's derivative premise, which is hardly covered by the showy camerawork (including the director Joe Wright's trademark long take), and the superficial treatment of dramatic and allegorical aspects.I like Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett. I tried to like the film, but found it very hard to do so, when Hanna, easily frightened by television and electricity, drops in a shop, uses a computer and access the internet; when chasing agents commit stupid mistakes again and again; when, most importantly, secrets and twists (very slowly revealed) are nothing really original.

Despite some strong performances ""Hanna"" fails to escape the threat of mediocrity.If you must see ""Hanna"" rent it first.",3,Interesting premise but the film wants to be both an action movie and art film but isn't successfuly at being either one,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,2482,"['SPOILERS', 'Raised', 'wilds', 'Finland', 'Hanna', 'Soairse', 'Ronan', ""n't"", 'interacted', 'person', 'aside', 'father', 'Erik', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'German', 'ex-CIA', 'operative', 'Trained', 'birth', 'be', 'assassin', 'Hanna', 'captured', 'team', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'command', 'Marissa', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Why', 'Marissa', 'Hanna', 'Erik', 'dead', 'mystery', 'when', 'Hanna', 'captors', 'Europe', 'meet', 'father', 'Berlin.END', 'OF', 'SPOILERS', 'Directed', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'Atonement', 'based', 'spec', 'script', 'Seth', 'Lockhead', 'rewritten', 'David', 'Farr', 'voted', 'one', 'best', 'unproduced', 'screenplays', 'mess', 'movie', 'promise', 'director', 'Wright', 'using', 'pounding', 'score', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', ""n't"", 'fit', 'film', 'insists', 'using', 'arty', 'direction', 'thriller', 'more', 'straight', 'forward', 'honest', 'direction.Actors', 'Ronan', 'Bana', 'Blanchett', 'do', 'best', 'material', 'can', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'often', 'stunning', 'expertly', 'choreographed', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'director', 'Wright', 'heavy', 'handed', 'approach', 'material.The', 'Blu-ray', 'often', 'stunning', 'detailed', 'presentation', 'image', 'quality', 'occasionally', 'soft', 'deliberate', 'choice', 'Colors', 'are', 'muted', 'keeping', 'theatrical', 'look', 'film', 'visually', 'impressive', 'presentation', 'film.The', '5.1', 'lossless', 'presentation', 'also', 'outstanding', 'lively', 'presentation', 'filled', 'detail', 'particularly', 'noticeable', 'opening', 'sequence', 'set', 'Finland.The', 'special', 'features', 'inclulde', 'commentary', 'director', 'Wright', 'interesting', 'articulate', 'discussion', 'merit', 'film.We', 'also', 'get', 'number', 'very', 'good', 'featurettes', 'including', 'one', 'oddly', 'named', 'Central', 'Intelligence', 'Agency', 'actually', 'fairy', 'provide', 'portal', 'understanding', 'Hanna', 'world', '.The', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', 'also', 'appear', 'featurette', 'discussing', 'score', 'Escape', 'Camp', 'G', 'insight', 'shooting', 'chase', 'scene', 'when', 'Hanna', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'promo', 'slightly', 'longer', 'alternate', 'ending', 'Blu-ray', 'Hanna', 'great', 'premise', 'poorly', 'executed', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'who', 'completely', 'terms', 'approach', 'material', 'score', 'Chemical', 'Brothers', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'film', 'strong', 'performances', 'Hanna', 'escape', 'threat', 'mediocrity.If', 'must', 'see', 'Hanna', 'rent', 'first']",N/A

You really have no idea what is happening through most of the movie. You know someone is going to try to capture and/or kill Hanna & she must kill them first. As the movie goes on you learn who they are and little bits of information are fed to you here & there. But even knowing what we are told, it still doesn't really explain the entire story. With a fragmented storyline, it was hard to really enjoy the movie. The actress that played Hanna was wonderful. Some of the fight scenes were a little hard to believe. They look choreographed & it was hard to believe she was doing any real damage to grown men. If they had concentrated more on her brains & speed, it would have been more realistic.

Just to say it, they should have hired a Chinese martial artist advisor. Some of it is well choreographed and edited but that too slides as the film proceeds. The 'super' presumably CIA agent, and the evil henchmen who either Hanna or Eric should have dispatched with one hand suddenly become their equal when necessary to the declining plot. In reality they are simply the psychopathic three stooges. The 'identity crisis' Hanna has because, having mastered the internet and come to fully understand molecular genetics in about 5 minutes, she understands that she is 'different' which leads directly to another plot failure. I really wanted to like this film from the trailer. It looked original and exciting and, at the beginning it was exactly that. Banality crept in like an ever deflating balloon. I think the writer really had no understanding of his main character and the director was simply clumsy in his transitioning Hanna from the pristine life of a subarctic dweller entering 'civilization' for the first time and dealing with all that entails to the precious little spoiled Eurogirl that she seems to become. Sorry to be clumsy myself here expressing my disappointment, this being the first time I have chosen to ever comment on a movie but that disappointment is what drove me here. Bana was good but winds up doing absolutely stupid things. Ronan is good but ditto. Both of their characters go from being highly competent to bumblers to serve the writer's lack of imagination. I think you will be very happy up to about the sewer cover in the middle of a desert...sorry, guys. I REALLY wanted to like this movie.

Despite its common beginning, however, 'Hanna' rises well above its genre. Cate Blanchett does a great job in her hard-edge spymaster role. Eric Bana plays a minor part in the drama, however large his part in getting the plot under way. Saoirse Ronan, however, walks away with the title role. Her delicate features and lean grace seem at odds with her vicious role, and the director makes the most of that contradiction. The paradox only builds when Hanna connects with another young girl - the contrast of one girl's chatty, knowing daydreams with the other's gritty and uncertain nightmares might make you look at any girl differently, knowing that both extremes might lie within one young frame.Think of a kitten: cute, yes, but trained by its parents to kill.
