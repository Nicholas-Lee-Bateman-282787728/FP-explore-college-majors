What makes matters even worse is how there's way too many slasher movies that basically blend together and after a while you feel like you're watching the same thing over and OVER again.With that in mind, there's some things about Knock Knock that separate it from the rest.  I think it's the mystery/detective vibe that dominates much of the storyline, despite the fact there's plenty of gruesome killings taking place (with LOTS of blood squirting and bodies hanging).Also, I bet you're probably thinking every single killing happens by way of the killer knocking on the front door of someones home, the person at home opening the door, the killer surprises them and violently kills them.  Well it doesn't happen that way very often (still happens occasionally though).  The movie did a fair job tricking the viewers into thinking all the killings would involve a suspicious bang at the door.One thing I positively *hated* though was the ending.

1144412,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B0013XZ6PC,J. B. Hoyos,"[1, 4]","""Knock Knock"" is an unique slasher mystery that is enjoyable if one is willing to forgive the low budget, sub par acting, and stereotypical characters.  In a small town, pretty high school student Nicole and her friends are being terrorized by a revenge-seeking lunatic who resembles Leatherface from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  They are being systematically slaughtered, butchered and strung up like animals - arranged so that their parents are the ones who find them first.  These scenes are drenched in gore and quite unnerving.  A great soundtrack accompanies this chiller from director Joe Ariola.  It has all original music including Erika J's ""Can't Let You Go,"" which is a nice song played during the credits.Who is this vicious killer who likes to knock on your door before killing you?  What horrible secret compels him to kill again and again and again?  What is his connection with the slowwitted high school custodian, Troy?  ""Knock Knock"" offers enough suspense, mystery and creative death scenes to make this good late night viewing.  It also has a wonderfully downbeat, open ending (similar to the one in the original ""Halloween"") that ensures the maniac will return.  However, because of the amateurish acting, I recommend renting ""Knock Knock"" before purchasing.",3,"Don't Bother Looking, He'll Kill You Before You Know He's There",1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,1284,"['Knock', 'Knock', 'unique', 'slasher', 'mystery', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'willing', 'forgive', 'low', 'budget', 'sub', 'par', 'acting', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'small', 'town', 'pretty', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Nicole', 'friends', 'are', 'being', 'terrorized', 'revenge-seeking', 'lunatic', 'who', 'Leatherface', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'are', 'being', 'systematically', 'slaughtered', 'butchered', 'strung', 'up', 'animals', 'arranged', 'so', 'parents', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'find', 'first', 'scenes', 'are', 'drenched', 'gore', 'quite', 'unnerving', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'chiller', 'director', 'Joe', 'Ariola', 'original', 'music', 'including', 'Erika', 'J', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Let', 'Go', 'nice', 'song', 'played', 'credits.Who', 'vicious', 'killer', 'who', 'knock', 'door', 'killing', 'What', 'horrible', 'secret', 'compels', 'kill', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'What', 'connection', 'slowwitted', 'high', 'school', 'custodian', 'Troy', 'Knock', 'Knock', 'enough', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'creative', 'death', 'scenes', 'make', 'good', 'late', 'night', 'viewing', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'downbeat', 'open', 'ending', 'similar', 'one', 'original', 'Halloween', 'maniac', 'will', 'return', 'However', 'amateurish', 'acting', 'recommend', 'renting', 'Knock', 'Knock', 'purchasing']","Knock, Knock: Unrated Director's Cut"

1144415,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B0013XZ6PC,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","I first came across Knock Knock a few years ago on Fear Net and reading the plot, it sounded like it'd be a pretty good horror movie but unfortunately it was less than good and only reaches the lines of....okay.Basically this movie is about a group of popular high school teenagers in a small town being haunted by the demonic spirit of a murdered teen who grew up in the town (typical B horror movie plot, right?) The murdered teen was a guy named Rico whose father was the pall bearer of a funeral home. One day while playing with a friend in the basement of the funeral home, some bullies came by and pranked Rico by locking him inside of a casket. The prank went awry when they accidentally burned the funeral home down with Rico inside, who burned to death. A generation later, the bullies are adults with teenage kids, about to pay for the crime of their past because Rico is back from the dead.Instead of targeting those responsible for his death, Rico insteads kills off their kids one by one in some of the most gruesome ways. A female detective and a retired, beat up cop team up to trace down this killer before it's too late. A mentally challenged janitor at the kids' high school, who was in the basement with Rico the day he died, plays a big part in them finding Rico. The killer in this movie looks a lot like a cheap, low budget version of Leatherface. He's got a paper mask that almost resembles Leatherface's and the rest of his attire looks like Leatherface's as well.The plot of the movie is typical but seems like it'd be enjoyable. Unfortunately the writers didn't go all the way with the plot and mid-way through, the movie becomes mediocre to watch. As mentioned, the killer kills off these teens in some really gruesome ways, using different weapons for each teen he murders. The first death is the most cliche one of the film that happens at the opening of the film. A made to look hot teenage girl is home alone when someone constantly knocks at the door. Every time she opened it, no one was there. She looks through the peep hole, where a fist punches through the door and chokes her. It's so stupid it's laughable.The bad part about this movie is that the ending leaves way for a sequel. Thankfully that sequel never happened. A Knock Knock 2 was made a few years ago but it has absolutely nothing to do with this movie, so I'm not sure why it was titled Knock Knock. Overall, a so-so B horror movie. Nothing great.

You can point to the great acting, the perfect foley work, the amazing cinematography, the gorgeous set design, and yet there's still something more, a perfect combination that makes magic happen and turns something that should have been a very good, but unremarkable, movie into something ineffably great. &lt;em>Knock Knock&lt;/em> is the first time I have ever seen this principle work in reverse. The acting, which is among the worst I have ever seen in a movie. The five-buck special effects budget. The horrific lighting. What looks like bad photoshopping on the exteriors (look at the bar entrance awning for a good example). The unintentionally hysterical script. All of these things combine to make an awful movie indeed, but there is something more going on under the hood. I can't tell you exactly what, just as I can't tell you what it is about &lt;em>The Fisher King&lt;/em> that elevates it above any other comedy I've ever seen. All I can tell you is that it is there, hanging over this production like a miasma, sinking itself deep into your eyeballs to implant its despair in your medulla, leading you to wonder if you could ever truly enjoy a movie again after watching this. My advice? Flee. Flee screaming in terror.

The movie is fair and has some good elements, some bad elements, and some giggle-worthy good-bad elements.The Good Elements:Hot chicks, Hot busty chicks, and one not as busty naked chick.A couple of good kill scenes.The Bad Elements:Everything Else.The good-bad elements:The chief detective investigating the murders looks and dresses like a hooker.  She also has an unusual way to grill a suspect.  She jiggles her assets then slaps them for looking.  When that doesn't work, she tries charm-(she swears at them)She teams up with a crusty old retired detective and they spend their lunch time throwing back whiskey at the nearest watering hole.  By this time I just referred to them as crusty and busty.  In the bar scene she actually wears(for her) a demure blouse but wears a mini skirt so mini she probably had to see a dermatologist after sitting on the bar stool.

1144422,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B0013XZ6PC,Sid the Elf,"[14, 17]","At this point in our movie reviewing careers you should be well aware that we are huge supporters of the low budget b community. Far from being movie snobs we seek out some of the finest b efforts ever made. There really is nothing better then popping in a movie that promises to be so bad it's good. The kind of film that tries so hard to be official but falls so short of the mark sending any of it's actors directly into porn never to be heard from again. That's our business, that's what we do. On the flip side of this love also comes a lot pain. The pain comes from sitting through movies like out title feature of the night ""Knock, Knock."" Seeing that the name of the production company was Ariola Productions. Inc. kind of gave it away that we were in for a real disaster. The only saving grace for this one was the cover which appeared as if it may pack some real horror punch but just wound up being largely misleading.The film starts off in typical B horror fashion as a young smoking hot chick is home alone wearing very skimpy clothes when she hears a knock at the door. She goes to answer and nobody is there, yeah big suprise. After she shuts the door it happens again and again until she finally runs out and challenges whoever is doing the knocking. Since nobody calls her out on the challenge she hops back into the house where she devises the master plan of shutting the door then looking through the peep hole to finally catch the trickster. As she has her face up on the door a hand busts through and she gets killed. Maybe if she had a reverse peephole like Kramer she would have lived but in this case she bites it. Now the film switches gears to a group of high school d bags who you really want to see get wacked. The one girl who is apparently the main character has an ex-cop grandfather who all of a sudden wants to be part of her life. He follows her around everywhere begging her to let him in with some of the most hilarious dialogue to ever grace film since The Final Sacrifice. This old guy has the most entertaining Italiano accent which led us to believe this film must have been shot in Jersey. The way this guy talked you just knew it. When it comes to Italian American stereotypes this guy had it all and earned the film 1/2 of it's one star. The other 1/2 comes from our suspected killer who had winner of a Gene Simmons look a like contest at some point in his life. He is the janitor of the high school and seems to be a few bricks short of a load if you know what we mean. He lives at home still with his mother, cleans the school durning the day, and moonlights as a serial killer. Oh and on the weekend we suspect he leads a b version of a kiss cover band.Now that weve had a couple murders we are introduced to the police detective who will crack the case. She's a blonde with a huge rack playing the most unrealistic detective the world as ever seen. She winds up tracking down the retired gumba grandpa cop at a local dive bar and gets him to help track down this killer before his granddaughter winds up getting killed. Somehow they are lead to believe that Gene Simmons brother, Gene Simmons is in charge of the murder and decide to pay him a visit. They arrive during the most bizarre scenes of the film when retarted Gene is actually playing the guitar in his bedroom. He is waering a tie dye shirt watching himself play his axe in the mirror while he laughs. It was so funny at first until it kept going on to the point of becoming disturbing. The scene lasts for about 10 of the strangest minutes of our lives until detective juggs and retired detective gramps bust into his room and brake up the one man concert. As his mother, who sounds a lot like Mrs. Costanza, yells at the detectives they try to question him about the murders. All he says is ""I didn't do nothin"" in yet another Jersey accent and they bring him down to the station. Finally Gene explains that when he was a kid he had a friend who a bunch of the jocks accidentally killed. They locked him in a casket and a fire broke out causing his friend to roast alive. Gene held on to all this anger and decides to start picking off young people who had nothing to do with the murder years ago. And thats that. There your movie in a nutshell. Be thankful we just saved you money if you planned on picking this one up.As far as horror/b horror goes this one was just horrible. It did have a few moments but they were just laughs from the fantastic Jersey accents and the Gene Simmons look a like. The only way we will suggest checking this one out is if it comes on tv late one night and you have absolutely nothing better to do. However you will need to think of it more as a comedy then anything else.",1,Even in the world of B horror this one scrapes the bottom of the stocking,1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,4716,"['point', 'movie', 'reviewing', 'careers', 'should', 'be', 'well', 'aware', 'are', 'huge', 'supporters', 'low', 'budget', 'b', 'community', 'Far', 'being', 'movie', 'snobs', 'seek', 'out', 'finest', 'b', 'efforts', 'ever', 'made', 'really', 'nothing', 'better', 'then', 'popping', 'movie', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'kind', 'film', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'official', 'so', 'short', 'mark', 'sending', 'actors', 'directly', 'porn', 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'again', 'business', 'what', 'do', 'flip', 'side', 'love', 'also', 'lot', 'pain', 'pain', 'sitting', 'movies', 'out', 'title', 'feature', 'night', 'Knock', 'Knock', 'Seeing', 'name', 'production', 'company', 'was', 'Ariola', 'Productions', 'Inc.', 'kind', 'gave', 'away', 'were', 'real', 'disaster', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'one', 'was', 'cover', 'appeared', 'may', 'pack', 'real', 'horror', 'punch', 'just', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'largely', 'misleading.The', 'film', 'typical', 'B', 'horror', 'fashion', 'young', 'smoking', 'hot', 'chick', 'home', 'alone', 'wearing', 'very', 'skimpy', 'clothes', 'when', 'knock', 'door', 'answer', 'nobody', 'there', 'yeah', 'big', 'suprise', 'door', 'again', 'again', 'finally', 'out', 'challenges', 'whoever', 'doing', 'knocking', 'nobody', 'out', 'challenge', 'back', 'house', 'where', 'master', 'plan', 'shutting', 'door', 'then', 'looking', 'peep', 'hole', 'finally', 'catch', 'trickster', 'face', 'up', 'door', 'hand', 'killed', 'Maybe', 'had', 'reverse', 'peephole', 'Kramer', 'would', 'have', 'lived', 'case', 'Now', 'film', 'gears', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'd', 'bags', 'who', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'get', 'wacked', 'one', 'girl', 'who', 'apparently', 'main', 'character', 'ex-cop', 'grandfather', 'who', 'sudden', 'be', 'part', 'life', 'everywhere', 'begging', 'let', 'most', 'hilarious', 'dialogue', 'ever', 'grace', 'film', 'Final', 'Sacrifice', 'old', 'guy', 'most', 'entertaining', 'Italiano', 'accent', 'led', 'believe', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'Jersey', 'way', 'guy', 'talked', 'just', 'knew', 'When', 'Italian', 'American', 'stereotypes', 'guy', 'had', 'earned', 'film', '1/2', 'one', 'star', 'other', '1/2', 'suspected', 'killer', 'who', 'had', 'winner', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'look', 'like', 'contest', 'point', 'life', 'janitor', 'high', 'school', 'be', 'few', 'bricks', 'short', 'load', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'home', 'still', 'mother', 'school', 'durning', 'day', 'moonlights', 'serial', 'killer', 'Oh', 'weekend', 'suspect', 'b', 'version', 'kiss', 'cover', 'band.Now', 'weve', 'had', 'couple', 'murders', 'are', 'introduced', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'will', 'crack', 'case', 'blonde', 'huge', 'rack', 'playing', 'most', 'unrealistic', 'detective', 'world', 'ever', 'seen', 'tracking', 'down', 'retired', 'gumba', 'grandpa', 'cop', 'local', 'dive', 'bar', 'help', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'granddaughter', 'up', 'getting', 'killed', 'Somehow', 'are', 'lead', 'believe', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'brother', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'charge', 'murder', 'decide', 'pay', 'visit', 'arrive', 'most', 'bizarre', 'scenes', 'film', 'when', 'retarted', 'Gene', 'actually', 'playing', 'guitar', 'bedroom', 'waering', 'tie', 'dye', 'shirt', 'watching', 'play', 'axe', 'mirror', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'first', 'kept', 'going', 'point', 'becoming', 'disturbing', 'scene', '10', 'strangest', 'minutes', 'lives', 'detective', 'juggs', 'retired', 'detective', 'gramps', 'bust', 'room', 'brake', 'up', 'one', 'man', 'concert', 'mother', 'who', 'lot', 'Mrs.', 'Costanza', 'detectives', 'try', 'question', 'murders', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'nothin', 'yet', 'Jersey', 'accent', 'bring', 'down', 'station', 'Finally', 'Gene', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'had', 'friend', 'who', 'bunch', 'jocks', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'locked', 'casket', 'fire', 'broke', 'out', 'causing', 'friend', 'roast', 'alive', 'Gene', 'held', 'anger', 'decides', 'start', 'picking', 'off', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'murder', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'nutshell', 'Be', 'thankful', 'just', 'saved', 'money', 'planned', 'picking', 'one', 'up.As', 'far', 'horror/b', 'horror', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'horrible', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'moments', 'were', 'just', 'laughs', 'fantastic', 'Jersey', 'accents', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'look', 'like', 'only', 'way', 'will', 'suggest', 'checking', 'one', 'out', 'tv', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'However', 'will', 'need', 'think', 'more', 'comedy', 'then', 'anything', 'else']","Knock, Knock: Unrated Director's Cut"
