445021,A3RCGRXYBRKSRC,6305045976,"Danielle Greenhouse ""Author of What They Left...","[4, 7]","I bought this DVD for my daughter because it was on sale at Wal-Mart and she's a big Barney fan.  Since this is a full length feature, I figured it would be a little bit different than the show.  Probably it would be 'smartened' up a bit for the reluctant adult audience...well, yes and no.The plot is very simple and easy to follow for children.  Basically, these parents drop their kids off at their grandparents house in Maine.  The oldest, a cynical teenage boy, teases the two younger girls about their belief that Barney is real.  That is, until Barney comes to life!  Then, the kids discover a large colorful egg in their grandparents' barn.  Along with Barney, they take it to a neighbor who is a bird expert.  Soon after they determine the egg has a creature called a 'dreammaker' inside, they soon lose the egg.  Most of the movie centers around their pursuit of the egg and their various mishaps and adventures along the way.  I won't give away the ending, though most adults probably have a good idea about what it will entail.Well, my daughter loves this movie.  This is one of the few live action movies that she will sit down and watch the whole way through.  Considering that she's hyper and the movie is about 90 minutes long, that's saying something.  She particularly enjoys the 'egg chase' section.How do I like it?  Well, I can watch it at least.  And it does have a plot.  But honestly, I think the movie is just plain silly.  Their attempts to 'smarten' it up were intended for the older kids forced to endure this thing with their younger siblings.  The acting isn't very good.  Everyone sounds like they're reading off of cue cards.  I know this is hard to believe, but Barney does the best acting job of the bunch!  At least it sounds like he actually memorized his lines.  I was rolling my eyes at a lot of situations, which just seemed absolutely ridiculous to me.  Especially the guy who makes a milk shake and french fries while driving, then almost gets into an accident.  Go to McDonald's or Dairy Queen, you idiot!  Also, this movie has mediorce special effects, which seem to be worse than what they have on the show (which I didn't think was possible).  It looks like someone who just bought an Imac put them all in--it doesn't seem like a professional job at all.  If you're an adult and don't mind the show, you will probably be able to sit through this movie.  If not, I seriously doubt it.About the supposed sex, drugs, swearing, etc.--This is the absolute truth, there is NONE.  There is some smart alecky remarks the kids say to each other, like ""Talk to the hand because the face isn't here"" but that's about it.  Also it is true that one of the kids steps in a cow patty, and unfortunately it's a close-up shot.  I was grossed out by it, but my daughter didn't care.  Other than that it's definitely a G rated movie.Would I recommend it?  For kids, a definite yes.  For adults, no, even if you like Barney.  Unless you're planning to do an Mystery Science Theater-like viewing party for a bunch of your friends, I would definitely not suggest any adult buy it for themselves.",3,My Daughter Loves It; I'm Not So Crazy About It,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,3118,"['bought', 'DVD', 'daughter', 'was', 'sale', 'Wal-Mart', 'big', 'Barney', 'fan', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'show', 'Probably', 'would', 'be', ""'smartened"", 'up', 'bit', 'reluctant', 'adult', 'audience', 'well', 'yes', 'no.The', 'plot', 'very', 'simple', 'easy', 'follow', 'children', 'Basically', 'parents', 'drop', 'kids', 'grandparents', 'house', 'Maine', 'oldest', 'cynical', 'teenage', 'boy', 'two', 'younger', 'girls', 'belief', 'Barney', 'real', 'Barney', 'life', 'Then', 'kids', 'discover', 'large', 'colorful', 'egg', 'grandparents', 'barn', 'Barney', 'take', 'neighbor', 'who', 'bird', 'expert', 'Soon', 'determine', 'egg', 'creature', 'called', ""'dreammaker"", 'inside', 'soon', 'lose', 'egg', 'Most', 'movie', 'centers', 'pursuit', 'egg', 'various', 'mishaps', 'adventures', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'most', 'adults', 'probably', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'will', 'entail.Well', 'daughter', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'will', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'whole', 'way', 'Considering', 'hyper', 'movie', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'saying', 'something', 'particularly', ""'egg"", 'chase', 'section.How', 'do', 'Well', 'can', 'watch', 'least', 'have', 'plot', 'honestly', 'think', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'attempts', ""'smarten"", 'up', 'were', 'intended', 'older', 'kids', 'forced', 'endure', 'thing', 'younger', 'siblings', 'acting', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Everyone', ""'re"", 'reading', 'cue', 'cards', 'know', 'hard', 'believe', 'Barney', 'best', 'acting', 'job', 'bunch', 'least', 'actually', 'memorized', 'lines', 'was', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'lot', 'situations', 'just', 'seemed', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'Especially', 'guy', 'who', 'milk', 'shake', 'french', 'fries', 'driving', 'then', 'almost', 'accident', 'Go', 'McDonald', 'Dairy', 'Queen', 'idiot', 'Also', 'movie', 'mediorce', 'special', 'effects', 'seem', 'be', 'worse', 'what', 'have', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'possible', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'bought', 'Imac', 'put', ""n't"", 'seem', 'professional', 'job', ""'re"", 'adult', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'show', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'movie', 'not', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'supposed', 'sex', 'drugs', 'swearing', 'etc.', 'absolute', 'truth', 'NONE', 'smart', 'alecky', 'remarks', 'kids', 'say', 'other', 'Talk', 'hand', 'face', ""n't"", 'here', 'Also', 'true', 'one', 'kids', 'steps', 'cow', 'patty', 'unfortunately', 'close-up', 'shot', 'was', 'grossed', 'out', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Other', 'definitely', 'G', 'rated', 'movie.Would', 'recommend', 'kids', 'definite', 'yes', 'adults', 'even', 'like', 'Barney', ""'re"", 'planning', 'do', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater-like', 'viewing', 'party', 'bunch', 'friends', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'suggest', 'adult', 'buy']",Barney's Great Adventure: The Movie VHS

Cody of course is stalwart in his disbelief of Barney, warning this may upset younger viewers because of the rude things said to Barney.A night time conversation between Cody and Barney reveal Cody's need for adventure and the ""cool"" things. Trying to sway Cody to the perks of imagination, Barney encourages Cody to wish on a star. Well that star turns out to be a Dream Maker egg and it sends Barney and Friends on a wild egg hunt trying to find out what's inside it, as well as rescue it before too late.With appearances by BJ and Baby Bop, the movie goes into more of it's more hilarious antics. Finally, when Twinken the Dream Maker hatches from his egg, Abby gets to see her dream more clearly, and Cody apologizes to Barney with an admission that the Purple Dinosaur is cool after all.My opinion? Well, the movie is not entirely big budget, and nothing that could contend with Superman Returns or Ice Age 2, or Pixar's Cars. But kids of ALL ages, should appreciate the heart, and the intent of what the movie tries to say to us all. Will I ever continue to watch the show? Maybe, maybe not. But I will watch the movie over and over again.And maybe, just maybe, through our own imaginations and determination, we all might make our own dreams come true. That message is what Barney and Friends put forth in the movie. Goes the same for kids and adults. I cant say for sure that every kid will like this movie. I did. And I recommend it for anybody who still believes that they can sing and dance and for one day if nothing else, hang with Barney. I think he's cool.As an afterthought. Keep an eye out for performances by two of todays young actors. You might recognize Kyla Pratt from Dr. Dolittle and The Proud Family. And Trevor Morgan can be seen in the Spielberg dino movie(coming full circle are we?) Jurassic Park 3. George Hearn, of Annie fame, is the kids' grandpa.",5,"Alright for Barney, A kiddie movie worth watching",1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,2645,"['Barney', 'Dinosaur', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'purple', 'pal', 'lately', 'grow', 'much', 'older', 'was', 'tend', 'get', 'relatively', 'disinterested', 'much', 'other', 'PBS', 'broadcasting', 'picked', 'up', 'Barney', 'Great', 'Adventure', 'DVD', 'Wal-Mart', 'work', 'discovered', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'big', 'kid', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'littler', 'ones', 'love.The', 'story', 'three', 'children', 'Abby', 'Marcella', 'two', 'girls', 'rich', 'imagination', 'dreams', 'who', 'love', 'Barney', 'play', 'doll', 'constantly', 'Cody', 'cynical', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'trying', 'be', 'cool', 'doesnt', 'automatically', 'believe', 'Barney.During', 'game', 'keep', 'away', 'started', 'Cody', 'Barney', 'large', 'life', 'thereby', 'starting', 'chain', 'events', 'Cody', 'reeling', 'adventure', 'always', 'dreamed', 'Cody', 'course', 'stalwart', 'disbelief', 'Barney', 'warning', 'may', 'upset', 'younger', 'viewers', 'rude', 'things', 'said', 'Barney.A', 'night', 'time', 'conversation', 'Cody', 'Barney', 'reveal', 'Cody', 'need', 'adventure', 'cool', 'things', 'Trying', 'sway', 'Cody', 'perks', 'imagination', 'Barney', 'Cody', 'wish', 'star', 'Well', 'star', 'out', 'be', 'Dream', 'Maker', 'egg', 'Barney', 'Friends', 'wild', 'egg', 'hunt', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'inside', 'as', 'well', 'rescue', 'too', 'late.With', 'appearances', 'BJ', 'Baby', 'Bop', 'movie', 'more', 'more', 'hilarious', 'antics', 'Finally', 'when', 'Dream', 'Maker', 'egg', 'Abby', 'see', 'dream', 'more', 'clearly', 'Cody', 'Barney', 'admission', 'Purple', 'Dinosaur', 'cool', 'all.My', 'opinion', 'Well', 'movie', 'not', 'entirely', 'big', 'budget', 'nothing', 'could', 'contend', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Ice', 'Age', '2', 'Pixar', 'Cars', 'kids', 'ALL', 'ages', 'should', 'appreciate', 'heart', 'intent', 'what', 'movie', 'say', 'Will', 'ever', 'continue', 'watch', 'show', 'Maybe', 'maybe', 'not', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'again.And', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'own', 'imaginations', 'determination', 'might', 'make', 'own', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'message', 'what', 'Barney', 'Friends', 'put', 'forth', 'movie', 'same', 'kids', 'adults', 'cant', 'say', 'sure', 'kid', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'did', 'recommend', 'anybody', 'who', 'still', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'one', 'day', 'nothing', 'else', 'hang', 'Barney', 'think', 'cool.As', 'afterthought', 'Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'performances', 'two', 'todays', 'young', 'actors', 'might', 'recognize', 'Kyla', 'Pratt', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'Proud', 'Family', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Spielberg', 'dino', 'movie', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'are', 'Jurassic', 'Park', '3', 'George', 'Hearn', 'Annie', 'fame', 'kids', 'grandpa']",Barney's Great Adventure: The Movie VHS
