The actors are believable as college kids, the professor actually seems to be delivering interesting lectures, the psychiatrist seems competent, even the police don't make any obvious dumb mistakes.

The best part of the movie is the cool looking cover. Spoiler Alert - The basics of this movie is about a typical confused 18 year old girl who is socially awkward and very naive. She gets drawn into a ridiculous idea about a urban legend from a group of pot smoking college age teens, involving an internet chat room and speaking some goofy phrase will bring out a so called serial killer that causes the deaths of the person you are chatting with. I think a very similar movie has already been done before, at least once. I feel its time to move on from the teen based horror film and into more of the modern horror film construct with a more complex story and cast. I am very happy I didn't buy this movie.

Several subjects were touched on that amazed me, including: philosophy, the laws of physics, the nature of eeevil, and psychology. It isn't a straight horror film, as much as it is an examination of the underside of the Internet, especially its borderline criminal usage, its anonymity, and the whole &#34;troll&#34; phenomenon. SMILEY is not another brainless spooker, or slasher movie. SMILEY him / itself doesn't even play as much of a role as I thought he / it would. While there is a supernatural aspect, this is more of a thriller that exposes human nature that has no balance, direction, or limitations.

Smiley is nowhere near as bad as its reputation would leave you to believe, but on the other hand, it's not an overlooked genre effort waiting to be rediscovered either.In Smiley, the film's central protagonist is slowly losing her grip on reality as she tries to figure out exactly what is going on around her as she investigates the urban legend surrounding Smiley. The panic, the confusion and the disorientation that this character is feeling is palpable. On the flip side of things, Smiley comes across as awfully repetitive and mistakes false scares for genuine suspense. It also takes far too long for anything, something to happen. Smiley comes across as prolonged.Smiley is the type of film that had a potentially iconic horror movie villain and could have been a great deal of fun as any type of material involving tall tales, superstitions and urban legends lends itself to that since these are stories we grew up listening to and horror fans have an automatic fondness for them, but instead we're given a film in which we're forced to sit there and watch a character slowly lose her mind. At the end of the day, Smiley is a middle of the road slasher film effort, not the best of its kind obviously, but not the worst of its kind either.

Keith David had a very small role in the movie. I didn't like the lead actress. I thought she did a very bad acting job. Some of the other actors didn't do too bad. I was let down by this movie. I saw it as a missed opportunity. I don't see this movie on par with Scream or the first I Know What You Did Last Summer. Even Urban Legend might be better than this mess. I didn't like the ending. I spent ten bucks on the dvd and I am going to trade it in soon. I'll say for true diehard slasher fans I would check it out still. Everyone is different. If you are looking for a good slasher that came out recently I suggest 'Silent Night' starring Jamie King and Malcom Mcdowell. Scream 4 is also a good one too bad it did poorly at the box office and there likely won't be another Scream. But any way I'd only rent this or see it on cable for free. Cheers!

The legend is this: If you log into an anonymous chat room, pick a person that you don't know, concentrate real hard and then type &#34;I did it for the lulz&#34; three times (It's Internet speak for &#34;I did it for the laughs.&#34;), a killer named Smiley (who stiched his eyes shut and then stitched a large smile on his face) will appear behind that person and slice their throat or stab them in the heart. We then switch to freshman college student Ashley (Caitlin Gerard; THE AWAKENING - 2010, who is very good here), a young female nerd who is trying to get over the suicide of her mother and had to be institutionalized for a short while. Rather than living in a dorm, she moves into a house close to campus with Proxy (Melanie Papalia; CONFINED - 2010), another young female who is the exact opposite of Ashley. She likes to party and have a good time, where Ashley is rather straight laced. Proxy talks Ashley into going to a party with her (after introducing Ashley to the joys of pot) at the house of rich privileged computer hacker Zane (Andrew James Allen). She also meets fellow nerd Binder (Shane Dawson), who is thrown out of the party for ratting out Zane and his friends to campus authorities for their hacking habits. After getting drunk at the party and watching a video of Smiley in action on one of Zane's computers, Ashley and Proxy go home and log into an anonymous chat room, where Proxy picks a person (a man who is buck naked) and tells Ashley to concentrate really hard (because you have to want it to happen) and type in &#34;I did it for the lulz.&#34; three times. An apprehensive and still-drunk Ashley does it and, sure enough, Smiley appears behind the guy and slits his throat. He then stares directly at the screen with his sewn-shut eyes. This freaks Ashley out, fearing that Smiley now knows who she and Proxy are. Ashley then believes that Smiley is after her (the dreams she has are very vivid) and goes to psychiatrist Dr. Jenkins (Liza Weil; STIR OF ECHOES - 1999), who prescribes her an anti-anxiety drug and threatens to recommit her if she gets worse. She also has discussions with psychology teacher Professor Clayton (an excellent Roger Bart; HOSTEL PART II - 2007), who tells her that all humans in general are doomed to extinction and it is only a matter of time before it happens (it's also refreshing that he never hits on her, except jokingly). I'll leave the rest for you to discover, as it didn't turn out the way I thought it was going to, which is always a plus in my book. For those that don't bother watching the closing credits to a film, I recommend you stay until the end for a stinger that changes everything. Director/co-writer/co-executive producer Michael J. Gallagher (his first theatrical effort, even if it only played for one week before going the DTV route) has created an inventive new character in Smiley (along with co-writer/co-executive producer Glasgow Phillips, who directed the funny Western zombie flick UNDEAD OR ALIVE - 2007) and fills the film with plenty of jump scares, which are usually nothing but somebody suddenly appearing in frame while the music amps up in volume, but it did manage to make me jump a couple of times (something that most modern horror films don't do to me). The inventive finale really surprised me, but there are clues along the way (especially if you watch it a second time) that doesn't make it seem that it is just coming out of left field, like most modern horror films where the writers and directors don't know how to properly end a film. SMILEY thankfully doesn't suffer that fate (and the stinger after the final credits is also a plus) and Roger Bart as Professor Clayton is such an interesting character, I wish I could go back to college and have him as a teacher. The acting and technical aspects are also above par for such a low-budget film and while there is some blood and gore, it doesn't rely on it to get the point across. In other words, I enjoyed it. It's nothing spectacular, mind you, just an entertaining update of all those urban legends that scared the shit out of us when we were kids. Also starring Keith David (as a police detective who really has nothing to do besides disbelieve everything Ashley tells him), Toby Turner, Jana Winternitz, Nikki Limo, Steve Greene, Richard Ryan and Michael Traynor as Smiley.

1607908,A3TWCND9PMIOG5,B00AEJM61I,"Marty Kingsley ""That Geek With The Clip-Ons""","[1, 2]","WARNING! SPOILERS WILL BE COMING!How my ratings work:5 - I really liked/loved it4 - I liked it3 - Could've been better/worth a look2 - Just didn't live up to the potential1 - Simply awfulI'll admit that when I first saw promotional material for this movie and a trailer, I thought ""This couldn't bee too bad."" Course the more I learned about the more it sounded totally moronic. Not helping is that after you really think about it, the killer has the face of an emoticon. OMG! EMOTICONS HAVE GAINED SENTIENCE! RUN!The legend: There's an urban legend on the internet (which just sounds odd to begin with) that if you go onto a random chat room and type to someone ""I DID IT FOR THE LULZ"" three times (when I first read this I felt my brain was gonna pop from the stupid) and a guy named Smiley comes behind the LULZ victim with a knife and I'm sure you can guess what he does next. He's called Smiley because he sewed his eyes shut vertically (and must've had some large eyes or put more effort into slicing his eyes vertically and then sewing them shut) and carved a smile on his mouth. I guess he also somehow sanded off his nose and made his nostrils disappear. This must've looked too graphic for DVDs (but not posters), because on the cover it looks like he's wearing a sack with a smile put on it (which really isn't too bad and could've been creepy), and in the movie he appears to be wearing some sort of smiley face mask with a panty stocking over it (making it look more silly, but I guess the knife helps). Maybe if he wasn't an internet based killer it would be more effective, but horror based around the internet just come off really really stupid. First off, the chat roulette in the movie (called hide and go chat) is outdated by several years, and wouldn't most these days have sound as well?Characters/plot: our main character is Ashley (played by an actress who's name you don't need to learn because I seriously doubt she's gonna have a career after this) who's just starting college. She rents a house with another college student named Proxy (good lord) and it's clear right away that Ashley has never interacted with another human being. She spouts dialogue that just makes you go ""What is wrong with you?"" Example: *Proxy invites her to a party* ""Isn't in a school night? Oh ha, right, it's college I can do whatever I want! heh Yes, I except your invitation."" or when Proxy hands her a joint ""I think I'm high off your marijuana."" Other characters include moron hacker Zane, moron computer nerd Binder (played by a youtube celebrity apparently...wow!), a dull as crud ethics teacher who just rambles on and on and says nothing and actually asks his students what a hypothesis is (funny, I thought that was something you learn in middle school).Ashley and Proxy think it would be hilarious to try the LULZ legend on some random person and get shocked when the person dies. This of course can't be reported because it happened on the internet, therefore the cops wouldn't take it seriously (video evidence, what's that!?). As it turns out the cops don't, as the main cop (played by Keith David, who was also in the amazingly stupid internet based horror film Chain Letter and deserves SOOOOOO much better! The dude was Goliath on Gargoyles for God sake!) says they need a body or for her to know said victims (because people only report deaths of people they know, never strangers).Technical goofs: This movie is filled with so many continuity errors that it's just sad. And anyone who says ""It's a low budget horror film!"" that isn't a valid excuse! There are plenty of low budget horror films that still looked good (which this movie does look ok) and kept decent continuity.Examples:1. The opening kill girl hears about the urban legend from a girl she's baby sitting. Later at home, she goes to a random chat room and some dude with glasses who just loops with his eyebrow arching types it out to her. However, it first shows the screen as her typing it (indicated by YOU), but then shows STRANGER writing it.2. We see said eyebrow looping dude at the party Ashley and Proxy go to, and we see him performing the LULZ and constantly see him looking at his friends and his ""video"" is still of him eyebrow looping or the video isn't on there at all (keen eyes will notice he doesn't even have a cam, built in or otherwise).3. There's a scene where Ashley freaks out and smashes her laptop and someone films it and puts it on youtube (I can't make this up, if I could I'd have written and sold it for a quick buck). When talking to the cops, they show her the video. And you can clearly see the edit option above the video! COME ON! Would it have really been so hard to have them open the video in a different link that didn't feature that? Internet reviewers have better continuity and they have even less of a budget!JUMP SCARES!: Every modern horror films has to have one. Not just a jump scare, but it also has to have that noise of someone banging on what sounds like a metal pan or something. Who needs atmosphere and mood? Let's just catch some people off guard with LOUD NOISES! There is a scene where I DID IT FOR THE LULZ! is painted on a wall in blood!The ending (I gave a spoiler warning at the start, you have no right to be upset by this): Turns out that Proxy and her friends were all messing with Ashley to drive her insane, and it causes her to jump out a window (a really bad CGI window) fall on her head and kill her). They all see this as a win for Anonymous (the online hacking group for those that don't know; Apparently they like to cause people mental grief and kill people) and even the opening kill girl was in on it. NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE! The opening kill girl was all spooked out in her house, plus she heard about the legend from the girl she was babysitting. The chat room thing is random, you have no way of knowing who you're going to chat with and therefore can't set up a fake kill or real kill. Ashley encounters Smiley in a chat room, meaning someone had to be sitting there for most likely days in hopes that she eventually came across him. This whole thing also had to rely on the cops being total morons who wouldn't take her seriously. Then there's the scene where she accidently shoots Binder, who was actually rigged with a squib and she had a fake gun that was placed at Zane's house, where she went to check on him. She could've easily gotten ahold of a real gun, or not even shot Binder and just let him in the house, which would've messed with their plan. And everyone in the group finds it awesome that Ashley was killed; apparently internet geeks are sociopaths. There was no reason for them to be messing with her! Well, other than the fact that they were bored I guess and figured ""Hey, let's prank on this doofy girl! FOR THE LULZ!"" Proxy via webcam finds it awesome as well, but later questions if they're bad people (OF COURSE NOT! You only messed with a girls psyche and caused her to die!) and Zane jokingly types in LULZ and Proxy gets killed by the real Smiley! DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN!Everyone in this movie is awful! The acting is either really bad or just really bland. Once Proxy gets all nervous about Smiley, she starts showing up randomly to Ashley in an attempt to JUMP SCARE her and act crazy. The ethics teacher is so droning and bland, and his scenes are pointless and add nothing to the movie! Keith David I suppose isn't too bad, but it's not like he's in the movie long enough to make any impact. And the lead playing Ashley! MY GOD! SHE IS SOOOOOOOO BAD! She is one of the most awkward leads I've ever seen. Did the director not see her audition first? Did he really think ""Oh yeah, she's a natural."" The direction isn't too bad, but the script (co-written by the director) is just incredibly stupid. What is with modern horror films making most of the main characters either bland or just so obnoxious and or jerky that we have no reason to give a crap what happens to them? A good horror film will set up some character development and make them a little sympathetic before killing them off (like John Carpenter's Halloween or Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street). This is also a tame horror film for a modern day slasher. I'm not saying gore would make it better, but at least there'd be some entertainment from the killer being over the top in his killings. But no, he just stabs people (sure, that's mostly what Michael Meyers did, but again there was mood set and had presence). That's actually another thing, Smiley isn't really in the movie much. He's mentioned a lot, but he's not around much and there aren't many kills. Again, doesn't have to be a blood bath, but most super natural killers make a show of it. Even Chain Letter had OTT gore. That didn't make it good by any means, but it was still something.So yeah, this movie sucks. I know I rambled, but I wanted to blow off steam on how bad it was. And if this review keeps people from seeing it, then I feel I've done my job.",1,"Hey Smiley, turn that smile upside down and go frag yourself!",1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,8994,"['WARNING',

I liked the premise for the story and thought how original until someone refreshed my memory about the chanting on Candyman and I think there are a few other movies that use repeated chant lines too. Anyway, back to the movie. It's definitely geared for the younger crowd and panders to their lifestyle and relationship with the internet, instant messaging and the anonymous interactions they share with one another. It does delve into some of the harsh realities that do take place with anonymous interactions and those who are empowered by their anonymity to do stupid stunts. Its like liquid courage they have powers that aren't possible without the anonymity or the fear of getting caught, so the movie actually does have a message in it. The three lead characters (2) girls Ashley & Proxy roomates and (1) ""Security Guru""  Zane are just plain annoying along with most of the supporting cast. Ashley's acting and screeming skills leave a lot to be desired and made the character more of a joke than than a asset. Proxy's acting was better, but she was annoying and Zane'sacting was a little to over the top and very annoying. While the story made me think how they were pulling off the kills for a while, the story got to redundant and far fetched and add the bad acting and silly interactions between the characters and I got bored. I will say that I actually did get a jump out of one scene, ;) I was impressed with some of the production values like camera work, image quality, locations and props, but the direction, acting and the worn out clich'e storylines for example the shrink, am I crazy, the cops don't believe me and the pranks and so on. These problems have been cramed down our throats to many times and have gotten ""OLD"". The writer dropped the ball on this one and could not think outside the box and instead went with the ""OLD"" clich'e standard story fillers. Was this worth the time? Yes and no, because it does have some redeeming value to it, but it also has a poorly written story and bad acting.

Independent movies like this, especially horror, are what really give fans things that are new and original, so I am happy to support them.And then I saw it.Now, this follows the fact that a week before the movie was set to premiere on VOD, the whole idea was shaken up, and AMC Theaters bought the rights to show the movie in various cities around the country, mine included.  Great!  I went to the theater, and watched.  Good God, I can't describe what happens next.It's awful.  Not just regular awful, God-awful.  Not 'so bad it's good', this movie reaches levels of 'so bad, it's completely embarrassing'.  That in and of itself is interesting, because this is the type of movie that is so bad, it actually is worth discussing, surpassing all bad movies before it, into something completely new.  I would even consider having this sitting on my shelf to show people just how bad things can get in the movies.  Have you ever been water-boarded?  Just watch this movie.  You want to put hot spikes into your eyes?  Don't worry, this movie fills in as an equivalent, it'll do the trick!The story is about a girl, Ashley, who goes off to college after her mother dies.  She has a fractured relationship with her dad (of course), and afraid of making close friendships of any kind.  She meets her roommate, Proxy (seriously, that's her name), and a weird subculture of hackers, including guys named Zane, Binder, and Flasher (seriously, those are their names).  She learns of an urban legend of a killer named Smiley, who kills people over internet video chat rooms.  Whenever someone chats with someone over the system, and says ""I did it for the LULZ"" three times (yea, seriously, it's really bad), Smiley will appear from behind them, and kill them on screen for that person to see.  So, of course, the characters all do this throughout the movie, people die, Ashley gets worried, blah, blah, blah.  This all leads to the end, where it is supposedly a huge twist, but turns out to be nothing more than a lame excuse to try and salvage this movie.  I mean, did you read what I just described, because all of that is true.  It's in the movie.The offenders are writer/director Michael Gallagher and lead actress, Caitlin Gerard, who plays Ashley.  I do give *some* credit to the original idea here.  But that is where it stops.  Gallagher should be kicked out of all writing and directing circles, and forced to film The Howling Part 8 or Child's Play 7 as his next feature, if he makes another one at all, only.  That's it.  I'm not sure he's capable of something better to be honest, and it's a shame, because there were some great ideas here, completely squandered away with the weakest of weak scripts, and pathetic film-making duties.Of course, there's also the lead actress, Caitlin Gerard, who I most recently saw in a McDonald's commercial.  That's right, she is such a good actress, she scored a spot in a silent McDonald's commercial, as a girl who plays horseshoes.  I can't make this up folks, this might be the worst performance ever captured on film.  She is not believable as a damsel in distress, she can't scream IN A HORROR MOVIE, hell, she can't even party or vomit right on film.  If she is ever in another film, I think it would be OK for the film-makers to threaten the studio to quit before moving forward with her, even as an extra.Are you still here?  How could I have written so much about this thing?  I'm telling you, this movie is new to the word, bad.  Curious about this thing now?  If you are a fan of horror, sure, give it a whirl, and see what never to do as a writer, director, actor, casting director, anything.  This is a cautionary tale about what not to do.  How they roped Keith David in, I will never understand, he deserves better than this.  Enemies deserve better than this.  Amazon should really allow 0 stars, because 1 is WAY too good for this.  But if you are still inclined, watch at your own risk.  It'll be the most fun you had since you squeezed lemon juice in your open wound, and cleaned it out with a wire brush.",1,Could be the worst movie I've ever seen.
