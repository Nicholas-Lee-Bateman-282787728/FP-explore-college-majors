1447751,A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ,B0058ZPNUY,Peter Tsang,"[230, 234]","The cover of ""Extreme Makeover Weight Loss Edition: The Workout"" shows images of three people who have been on the show.  They are Rachel who lost 161 pounds, LaRhonda who lost 202 pounds, and Alex who lost 216 pounds.  There's also an 11 minute segment where they give advice.  This workout is designed for those who want to start losing weight and have not been active.  This DVD is probably not intended for experienced exercisers.There are three levels in the DVD.  Each level has its own warm up and cool down.In all three, Chris Powell leads a group with various fitness levels.Level 1 is about 15 minutes.  This workout is for people, (like the people on the cover, when they first wanted to get fit), who are just starting out.  Movements are slow and carefully controlled.  Mr. Powell instructs with safety in mind and works on the upper body, the lower body, and the core.Level 2 is about 25  minutes.  This workout bumps it up a bit by introducing some aerobic movements.  Aerobics include some high impact, but there's always a low impact version shown.  Mr. Powell works more on the upper body, lower body, and the core.Level 3 is about 30 minutes.  Mr. Powell continues the upper body, lower body, and core work with longer aerobics, a series of squats, pushups, ab work and so on.  Easier modifications are shown.Mr. Powell's instruction is friendly, gentle, and mindful of newcomers to exercise.  No equipment is needed.
