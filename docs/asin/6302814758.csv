I have to say this is much better than alot of Wes Cravens newer work ! This is when Wes, was a raw executer of horror. Now he is putting out Trash like ""Redeye"" and the Unforgettable laughable Scream movies! He in my opinion has been headed for a downward spiral over the years. Just getting by on his creditability of his past ! And even though his cinematograpy is better now days, it  doesn't necessary make up for horrible writing. Where in this movie his cinemetograpy and directing  was childs play? The story was extremley interesting and creative !Well, anyway this is the story about a loss of two friends one a robot ! And how this young and very sick but ingenious young man decides to combine the two. But the only problem is her soul is dead but BB which is the robot's isn't ! And based on the fact that BB wasn't such a nice robot in the beginning ! This turns in to a grizzly plot for revenge on everyone that had harmed Samantha and BB from the beginning. By the time signs of Samantha started to show it was too late. It was almost like they were at conflict with one another in the same body but both very angry at what had happened !Loaded with gore, and extremley gruesome and creative murders. Especially the basketball murder that was interesting! Where did Wes Cravens creativity go ? Now this is an interesting movie and script even for todays standards. I just wish it could be remade with better actors and a better execution ! I hadn't seen this movie in 19 years since was 11 or 12 ! But i remember really thinking this movie was extremley unique even for that time! So I fetched a copy off of Amazon and watched it again! Why this isn't out on DVD I don't Know? Why doesn't this ever get reran on any cable stations I don't know? It's kind of weird considering all the other crap that gets played or made! This movie definitley you can tell it was around that ""Nightmare On Elm Street period. His directing and style in this movie is quite similiar. Especially the boiler room scene with her father and how her father resembled the Freddy charcter.",4,I have to give this 4 for the creativity and vintage novelty alone !,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,2154,"['Even', 'movie', 'was', 'poorley', 'excuted', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'have', 'say', 'much', 'better', 'alot', 'Wes', 'Cravens', 'newer', 'work', 'when', 'Wes', 'was', 'raw', 'executer', 'horror', 'Now', 'putting', 'out', 'Trash', 'Redeye', 'Unforgettable', 'laughable', 'Scream', 'movies', 'opinion', 'been', 'headed', 'downward', 'spiral', 'years', 'Just', 'getting', 'creditability', 'past', 'even', 'cinematograpy', 'better', 'now', 'days', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'make', 'up', 'horrible', 'writing', 'Where', 'movie', 'cinemetograpy', 'directing', 'was', 'childs', 'play', 'story', 'was', 'extremley', 'interesting', 'creative', 'Well', 'anyway', 'story', 'loss', 'two', 'friends', 'one', 'robot', 'how', 'young', 'very', 'sick', 'ingenious', 'young', 'man', 'combine', 'two', 'only', 'problem', 'soul', 'dead', 'BB', 'robot', ""n't"", 'based', 'fact', 'BB', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'nice', 'robot', 'beginning', 'grizzly', 'plot', 'revenge', 'everyone', 'had', 'harmed', 'Samantha', 'BB', 'beginning', 'time', 'signs', 'Samantha', 'started', 'show', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'was', 'almost', 'were', 'conflict', 'one', 'same', 'body', 'very', 'angry', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'Loaded', 'gore', 'gruesome', 'creative', 'murders', 'Especially', 'basketball', 'murder', 'was', 'interesting', 'Where', 'did', 'Wes', 'Cravens', 'creativity', 'go', 'Now', 'interesting', 'movie', 'script', 'even', 'todays', 'standards', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'remade', 'better', 'actors', 'better', 'execution', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', '19', 'years', 'was', '11', '12', 'i', 'remember', 'really', 'thinking', 'movie', 'was', 'extremley', 'unique', 'even', 'time', 'So', 'fetched', 'copy', 'Amazon', 'watched', 'again', 'Why', ""n't"", 'out', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Why', ""n't"", 'ever', 'get', 'reran', 'cable', 'stations', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'kind', 'weird', 'considering', 'other', 'crap', 'played', 'made', 'movie', 'definitley', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'period', 'directing', 'style', 'movie', 'quite', 'similiar', 'Especially', 'boiler', 'room', 'scene', 'father', 'how', 'father', 'resembled', 'Freddy', 'charcter']",N/A

Yes, the story is sort of loopy, and the ""shock"" ending is pretty silly, but I still find myself enjoying this movie! Paul (Matthew Laborteaux) has just moved into a new neighborhood w/ his mum and his robot, BB. Next door, a girl named Samantha (Kristy Swanson) lives w/ her drunk, abusive, and repugnant father. Across the street is the neighborhood crazy-lady named Elvira (Anne Ramsey) w/ her tall fence, alarm system, and shotgun. Samantha is killed by her idiot father, causing Paul to attempt the unthinkable- implanting BB's  brain in her dome! The rest is a tale of revenge, as Samantha/BB goes on a rampage, including the infamous head-sizzling (head roasted into what resembles a burnt meatloaf) and head exploding (head goes boom like a grenade in a watermelon) scenes!

Chow,"[1, 2]","`Deadly Friend' features Kristy Swanson when she was 16.OK, you're not ordering `Deadly Friend' you're reading this review which means that if the prospect of 16 year old Kristy is not enough to persuade you to buy this film nothing else is going to.Wes Craven's `Deadly Friend' is almost such a bad idea you wonder how he became involved with it. The plot focuses on a 16 year old Paul a brain surgeon, scientist who builds AI robots in his spare time. Moving to a new town with his single mother, they are instantly the talk of the nationhood as their robot Feebee (Think R2D2 with arms) makes a big splash and shows he/it is capable of violence as it fends off a carjacker and a teen biker gang and Feebee is beginning to disobey Paul. ""Paul? What are you doing Paul?""The girl next door is sexy 16 year old Kristy Swanson. For Halloween she dresses in a toga as a Greek goddess. Romance springs between the two teens, but before Paul can play doctor with her, Kristy is beaten to death by her sexually abusive father.Here the film turns from sexy to sick as Paul lives out his necrophilia fantasy of bringing Kristy back from the dead with spare parts from Feebee. As with all sci-fi we know that bringing someone back from the dead results in at least two things, 1 they're evil, 2 they're super strong. Hence Kristy begins stalking and killing the nasty neighbors while Paul tries to lock her up in his attic.As I said I don't know what Wes Craven was going for here. Homicidal zombie Kristy Swanson just isn't sexy. What is Paul hoping to accomplish?`Deadly Friend' does have its moments reminiscent of small town sci-fi ala `Goonies', `Monster Squad,' exedra. One scene worth the price of admission alone is when Kristy hurls a basketball with super human strength at Anne Ramsey (`Throw Mama From the Train')  causing her head to explode like a watermelon and her decapitated corpse to stumble around the room spurting blood. It's a scene like this which could have saved Wes Craven's `Red Eye.'",3,Sexy Friend and An Exploding Head,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,2003,"['Deadly', 'Friend', 'features', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'when', 'was', '16.OK', ""'re"", 'not', 'ordering', 'Deadly', 'Friend', ""'re"", 'reading', 'review', 'prospect', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Kristy', 'not', 'enough', 'persuade', 'buy', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'going', 'to.Wes', 'Craven', 'Deadly', 'Friend', 'almost', 'such', 'bad', 'idea', 'wonder', 'how', 'became', 'involved', 'plot', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Paul', 'brain', 'surgeon', 'scientist', 'who', 'AI', 'robots', 'spare', 'time', 'Moving', 'new', 'town', 'single', 'mother', 'are', 'instantly', 'talk', 'nationhood', 'robot', 'Feebee', 'Think', 'R2D2', 'arms', 'big', 'splash', 'shows', 'he/it', 'capable', 'violence', 'carjacker', 'teen', 'biker', 'gang', 'Feebee', 'beginning', 'disobey', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'Paul', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'sexy', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'Halloween', 'toga', 'Greek', 'goddess', 'Romance', 'springs', 'two', 'teens', 'Paul', 'can', 'play', 'doctor', 'Kristy', 'beaten', 'death', 'sexually', 'abusive', 'father.Here', 'film', 'sexy', 'sick', 'Paul', 'out', 'necrophilia', 'fantasy', 'bringing', 'Kristy', 'back', 'dead', 'spare', 'parts', 'Feebee', 'sci-fi', 'know', 'bringing', 'someone', 'back', 'dead', 'results', 'least', 'two', 'things', '1', ""'re"", 'evil', '2', ""'re"", 'super', 'strong', 'Hence', 'Kristy', 'stalking', 'killing', 'nasty', 'neighbors', 'Paul', 'lock', 'up', 'attic.As', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'was', 'going', 'here', 'Homicidal', 'zombie', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'just', ""n't"", 'sexy', 'What', 'Paul', 'hoping', 'accomplish', 'Deadly', 'Friend', 'have', 'moments', 'reminiscent', 'small', 'town', 'sci-fi', 'ala', 'Goonies', 'Monster', 'Squad', 'exedra', 'One', 'scene', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'when', 'Kristy', 'basketball', 'super', 'human', 'strength', 'Anne', 'Ramsey', 'Throw', 'Mama', 'Train', 'causing', 'head', 'explode', 'watermelon', 'decapitated', 'corpse', 'stumble', 'around', 'room', 'spurting', 'blood', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Red', 'Eye']",N/A

337970,A23JNLBAE18XO0,6302814758,Frank R. Schoonover,"[1, 1]","Deadly Friend, a 1986 horror film based on the novel Friend by Diane Henstell, whose screenplay was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Wes Craven, is another one of the most underrated films of the 1980's. It is actually a very entertaining, scary and funny romp that happens to be a very worthy entry in the Wes Craven film catalog.The whole film is about a young man named Paul(Matthew Laborteaux)and his mother Jeannie(Anne Twomey)moving into a small town. Paul's pet project is a robot named BB(voice of Charles Fleischer) who only way of communicating is saying BB all the time. Paul is a young college student studying neurology and artificial intelligence at the local university. He immediately befriends another young man named Tom(Michael Sharrett)and when he meets the girl next door named Samantha(Kristy Swanson), he falls in love with her. Unbeknown to Paul, she lives with a very physically abusive father(Richard Marcus)and is always in denial when there are sores discovered on her by Paul. They soon meet the meanest lady on the block named Elvira Parker(Anne Ramsey, may she rest in peace)who takes their basketball away when it accidently goes into her yard. The lady, on Halloween night, would later destroy BB by shooting him repeatedly with her shotgun.Samantha is later killed by her father when he pushes her down the stairs and is later declared brain dead by the doctors at the local hospital. Paul and Tom later steal her body from the hospital and Paul brings Samantha back to life by inserting BB's AI brain chip into her brain and she comes to life by remote control. But soon, Samantha comes to life on her own and starts a revenge campaign by killing her father first and later, in a golden horror film moment, kills Elvira Parker by bashing her head with the stolen basketball right in her living room and soon, she is out of control and won't stop. As usual, I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it as of yet.Wes Craven works wonders behind the camera as he directs the film with the usual flair that he used for The Hills Have Eyes and A Nightmare on Elm Street. He paints a truly horrific experience that will scare you and at the same time, make you chuckle a little as it combines horror with a little bit of black comedy. Deadly Friend is where The Breakfast Club meets The Bride of Frankenstein. It also shows that there are those who will do whatever it takes to bring back a love lost no matter what the circumstances and also shows that you should leave well enough alone, no matter what.Deadly Friend is well acted, well scripted and is a very technically well made motion picture. The film is wonderfully directed by Craven and although he really doesn't think much of this film, he really should be proud of it as, though not his best film, it is actually a wonderful film that is a very much underrated horror classic and worthy of the term horror in many ways. Deadly Friend is both scary and a hoot at the same time in more ways than one.I saw this movie back in the day at a cheap film cinema in my hometown and I thought that it was a wonderful little film as I enjoyed it immensely. This film really grabbed me when I saw it and also made me laugh when the scene where Elvira Parker's head is bashed by the basketball as it made everyone in the theater auditorium laugh really hard. I bought this on DVD at a going out of business sale at a local video store and seeing it on DVD brought back all the fun that I had when I initially saw this film in 1986. I still enjoyed it as immensely as I did back when I initially saw this back in 1986 at the local bargain cinema. I even bought this on VHS at the local Media Play for only $8.99 when that store first opened up.The DVD has the film looking great.PROS: The film looks great. The colors are all there and they are looking bright and beautiful. The film looks, clean, fresh and new.CONS: There are no scene selections. With the exception of the theatrical trailer, there really isn't much in the special features department.Still, it is on DVD and that is wonderful.Deadly Friend should be a part of any horror film lovers DVD library. It is a scary film and it is also funny at the same time. It will also please horror film fans that have a sense of humor. If you saw this movie back in the day and want to revisit it again, go ahead and rent it or better yet, buy it and relive the memories again. Again, this is one film that no horror fan nor comedy fan should be without.",4,Another One of the Most Underrated Films of the 1980's,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,4537,"['Deadly', 'Friend', '1986', 'horror', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Friend', 'Diane', 'Henstell', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Bruce', 'Joel', 'Rubin', 'directed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'films', '1980', 'actually', 'very', 'entertaining', 'scary', 'funny', 'romp', 'be', 'very', 'worthy', 'entry', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'film', 'catalog.The', 'whole', 'film', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Paul', 'Matthew', 'Laborteaux', 'mother', 'Jeannie', 'Anne', 'Twomey', 'moving', 'small', 'town', 'Paul', 'pet', 'project', 'robot', 'named', 'BB', 'voice', 'Charles', 'Fleischer', 'who', 'only', 'way', 'communicating', 'saying', 'BB', 'time', 'Paul', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'studying', 'neurology', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'local', 'university', 'immediately', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Tom', 'Michael', 'Sharrett', 'when', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'named', 'Samantha', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'love', 'Unbeknown', 'Paul', 'very', 'physically', 'abusive', 'father', 'Richard', 'Marcus', 'always', 'denial', 'when', 'are', 'sores', 'discovered', 'Paul', 'soon', 'meet', 'meanest', 'lady', 'block', 'named', 'Elvira', 'Parker', 'Anne', 'Ramsey', 'may', 'rest', 'peace', 'who', 'basketball', 'away', 'when', 'accidently', 'yard', 'lady', 'Halloween', 'night', 'would', 'later', 'destroy', 'BB', 'shooting', 'repeatedly', 'shotgun.Samantha', 'later', 'killed', 'father', 'when', 'down', 'stairs', 'later', 'declared', 'brain', 'dead', 'doctors', 'local', 'hospital', 'Paul', 'Tom', 'later', 'steal', 'body', 'hospital', 'Paul', 'Samantha', 'back', 'life', 'inserting', 'BB', 'AI', 'brain', 'chip', 'brain', 'life', 'remote', 'control', 'soon', 'Samantha', 'life', 'own', 'revenge', 'campaign', 'killing', 'father', 'first', 'later', 'golden', 'horror', 'film', 'moment', 'Elvira', 'Parker', 'bashing', 'head', 'stolen', 'basketball', 'right', 'living', 'room', 'soon', 'control', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'usual', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet.Wes', 'Craven', 'wonders', 'camera', 'film', 'usual', 'flair', 'used', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'truly', 'horrific', 'experience', 'will', 'scare', 'same', 'time', 'make', 'chuckle', 'little', 'horror', 'little', 'bit', 'black', 'comedy', 'Deadly', 'Friend', 'where', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'also', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'bring', 'back', 'love', 'lost', 'matter', 'what', 'circumstances', 'also', 'should', 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'matter', 'what.Deadly', 'Friend', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'scripted', 'very', 'technically', 'well', 'made', 'motion', 'picture', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'directed', 'Craven', 'really', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'actually', 'wonderful', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'underrated', 'horror', 'classic', 'worthy', 'term', 'horror', 'many', 'ways', 'Deadly', 'Friend', 'scary', 'hoot', 'same', 'time', 'more', 'ways', 'one.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'back', 'day', 'cheap', 'film', 'cinema', 'hometown', 'thought', 'was', 'wonderful', 'little', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'film', 'really', 'grabbed', 'when', 'saw', 'also', 'made', 'when', 'scene', 'where', 'Elvira', 'Parker', 'head', 'bashed', 'basketball', 'made', 'everyone', 'theater', 'auditorium', 'really', 'hard', 'bought', 'DVD', 'going', 'business', 'sale', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'brought', 'back', 'fun', 'had', 'when', 'initially', 'saw', 'film', '1986', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'immensely', 'did', 'back', 'when', 'initially', 'saw', 'back', '1986', 'local', 'bargain', 'cinema', 'even', 'bought', 'VHS', 'local', 'Media', 'Play', 'only', '8.99', 'when', 'store', 'first', 'opened', 'up.The', 'DVD', 'film', 'looking', 'great.PROS', 'film', 'great', 'colors', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'looking', 'bright', 'beautiful', 'film', 'clean', 'fresh', 'new.CONS', 'are', 'scene', 'selections', 'exception', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'special', 'features', 'department.Still', 'DVD', 'wonderful.Deadly', 'Friend', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'horror', 'film', 'lovers', 'DVD', 'library', 'scary', 'film', 'also', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'also', 'please', 'horror', 'film', 'fans', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'saw', 'movie', 'back', 'day', 'want', 'revisit', 'again', 'go', 'ahead', 'rent', 'better', 'yet', 'buy', 'relive', 'memories', 'again', 'Again', 'one', 'film', 'horror', 'fan', 'comedy', 'fan', 'should', 'be']",N/A

So innocent, yet in so much pain. Pain endured alone in the home of an abusive father. Our hero lives next door to her, a child prodigy. A genius in the field of biology, chemistry, and mathematics. He is in classes far beyond his age group, yet he excels.Samantha is physically abused by her father, all the classic symptoms are present; mysterious bruises, black eyes, and a shy, quiet demeanor. She will not tell anyone. One day her father goes to far and kills her, throwing her down a flight of stairs.Oh rue the day of innocence and youth lost. How many of us knew a silent victim? How many of us were helpless to act? How many lost loves were never experienced because of circumstances that were above the realm of the average American teenager?

That is why `Deadly Fiend' will always have a special place in my heart.Our hero, plays a junior Frankenstein upon his friend's death. He rebuilds her, brings her back to life. Will she avenge herself by killing her father? Will she be forever grateful and fall in love with our hero? Will she run off and become a sausage vendor in Wisconsin?

337988,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6302814758,Monty Moonlight,"[4, 4]","A teenage genius named Paul (Matthew Laborteaux) moves into a new town with his single mother and typical '80's robot of his own design, BB. He makes a friend right away in a paperboy named Tom, and also discovers he's one of those lucky movie characters who has moved in next door to a teen angel, this one named Samantha Pringle (Kristy Swanson). Paul soon finds he has his hands full, between his increasingly intelligent and aggressive robot and constantly abused by her father love interest. Robot BB doesn't last long, thanks to some less than friendly neighbors, so the focus soon shifts more towards the beautiful and sweet Samantha, who is probably one of the most sympathetic characters ever put on film, and if you have trouble watching extreme adorableness suffer continuously, you may have trouble watching ""Deadly Friend"". This is the tragic story of teenage love ended all too soon and brought back in the style of Mary Shelly, with a modern twist!Now, if you've seen ""Deadly Friend"" already, you may scoff at my awarding it 5 stars. But, as I often have to remind people, 5 stars means ""I Love It"", according to Amazon.com, not ""It's a masterpiece of filmmaking"", and I do love ""Deadly Friend"". Why? Well, first, it IS just an updated Frankenstein story, but that's a great story. This is an '80's take, but it's not overwhelmingly '80's like your typical teen '80's film. It manages to not be all that dated, aside from the look of the robot that is so reminiscent of so many movies from the time. But I think the main reason this movie endears itself to so many is that Kristy Swanson is such a sweetheart in it. It's so successful as a tragedy because Samantha is a character you really fall in love with and wish you could save. Frankly, I'm not hugely into Kristy Swanson, but in this film and her tiny part in ""Ferris Bueller"" she is extra cute and always gets to me. It also has some very unforgettable scenes, like the famous basketball-meets-head explosion. The characters and the acting are all first rate in general, and this is just fantastic Wes Craven stuff. The only thing I could complain about in this film, aside from how sad it is (but it's supposed to be), is the final scene, which is dreamlike but never confirmed to be a dream. I really wish they had either left that little tid bit out, cut the final aspect of it, or thrown in the ""waking from a dream"" shot to have it make more sense. It shouldn't ruin your enjoyment of the film overall, it's just too bad that they went that route with the final minute or two, in my opinion. Easily ignored though, so don't let it prevent you from checking out this extremely enjoyable flick!The DVD is practically barebones, but we do get the cool theatrical trailer and it has some scenes restored over the VHS release. The DVD cover is lame though, and they should have used the original poster art.

In fact, most folks probably don't remember that he even made the movie(like Swamp Thing).  While it doesn't quite achieve classic status like some of his other films, it's rather fun.  Until recently, I haven't seen this film since about 1988 or so(on HBO of course).  The plot concerns a teenage genius, Paul, who has created a robot with artificial intelligence.  He also teaches at the local college.  He falls for his next door neighbor, Sam(Kristy Swanson), who ends up severely brain damaged and ultimately killed by her abusive father.  Earlier in the film, Paul's robot, BB, was blown to smithereens by the neighborhood's lunatic old lady(Anne Ramsey from The Goonies and Throw Momma From The Train), so Paul has a handy dandy robot brain lying around.  In true mad scientist fasion he brings back Sam with BB's brain.  Of course we all know that when this stuff happens in movies nothing goes as smooth as planned.  The merged brains of BB and Sam go on a killing spree of everyone that ever wronged them(there was some BB bullying early in the film).  Paul tries to hide Sam from his mother and keep her in line with a remote control, but it all becomes to big for him to handle.  Plus, his buddy is about to squeal to the fuzz.  Interestingly the movie actually plays out better than the silly concept would have you believe.  Make no mistake, some of it is quite funny, but in Craven's hands it's handled about as well as this Weird Science/Re-Animator hybrid could be handled.  Swanson has never been one of my favorite actresses, but she does a good job with the blank stares and robotic movements(the credits state she had a mime coach).  Matthew Laborteaux has nerdy charm, but it is a bit hard to buy that he'd have the drive and determination to do what he does.  This movie is most well known for it's ""basketball decapitation"" scene, which is certainly worth the price of admission alone.  The shock ending scene is completely absurd and defies any kind of logic, but is very typical of horror movies from this time period.  It still managed to bring a smile to my face nonetheless.  The song played over the closing credits is a hoot with it's constant whisperings of ""BB!"", ""BB!""  Deadly Friend was worth seeing again for sure(unlike that putrid Cursed movie Craven did).

Some, like Wes Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) were creative successes that forged new ground.  The same can't really be said of Craven's Deadly Friend (1986), a goofy tale with a very shaky storyline involving robotics, neurobiology, and re-animation.  This version of the film apparently includes restored scenes deleted in some previous releases.  The additional blood and gore probably add a little excitement, to what is a slow moving and not very scary tale.Jeannie Conway (Anne Twomey) and her son Paul (Matthew Laborteaux) have just move to a new town.  A science wiz, Paul has built a robot named BB, and has a scholarship to Western Polytech, a local college.  Paul quickly makes friends with a high school student named Tom (Michael Sharrett), and Samantha (Kristy Swanson) a young girl who lives next door.Paul is a strange guy.  He's really intelligent, performing research on the brain, and lecturing to a class at college.  But on the other hand, he often seems to think and act, like a little kid.  Paul, Tom, and Sam, seem overly fascinated by cranky Elvira Parker (Anne Ramsey), an older woman who has a chain link fence around her house, and has a habit of pointing a loaded shotgun.  You would think they would steer clear of this nutjob, but at Halloween Paul has BB open Parker's locked gate, which quickly leads to the robot being blasted to pieces.  After this genius move, a heartbroken Paul manages to salvage BB's CPU.Paul is working on developing a relationship with Sam, but her possessive and abusive father (Richard Marcus) limits what they can do.  One evening, Sam is pushed down the stairs by her father, injures her head, and is put on life support at the hospital.  Paul convinces Tom to help him, as he enters the hospital, hijacks Sam's dead body, and hoping to re-animate her, Paul implants BB's CPU into her brain, and sneaks her back to his home.The result is a limited success, as Sam can move, but she can't speak and doesn't seem to understand much about what is happening.  Sam apparently has a sense of consciousness similar to that of the robot BB.  One thing she does understand is the concept of revenge.  Sam first makes things really hot for her father, then apparently still holding a grudge from being blasted to pieces, she follows up by dealing with Ms. Parker.  Samantha is slowly becoming more human, but it's just a little too late.Kristy Swanson is pretty good as the normal Samantha, but no so great at the re-animated Sam.  Her slow moving and robotic performance, accompanied by a blank look on her face that often seems ready to break into a smile, may be what Craven wanted, but at times it almost seems more funny than scary.Bloody dream sequences, and a burned corpse, are a couple of elements attributable to Wes Craven, but this silly, slow-moving film seems aimed mostly at a juvenile audience.  Character development is very poor, and the story is full of holes.  For a director, who even at this point of his career had clearly done much better, this type of effort is something of a disappointment.  Although it explores similar themes asRe-Animator(1985), comparisons may not be fair, but Deadly Friend has nowhere near the suspense, frenetic action, or camp value, and rates just 2.5 stars.",2,a disappointing juvenile effort from Wes Craven...,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,3322,"['80', 'produced', 'lot', 'wacky', 'horror', 'films', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', '1984', 'were', 'creative', 'successes', 'forged', 'new', 'ground', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'said', 'Craven', 'Deadly', 'Friend', '1986', 'goofy', 'tale', 'very', 'shaky', 'storyline', 'involving', 'robotics', 'neurobiology', 're-animation', 'version', 'film', 'apparently', 'restored', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'previous', 'releases', 'additional', 'blood', 'gore', 'probably', 'add', 'little', 'excitement', 'what', 'slow', 'moving', 'not', 'very', 'scary', 'tale.Jeannie', 'Conway', 'Anne', 'Twomey', 'son', 'Paul', 'Matthew', 'Laborteaux', 'have', 'just', 'move', 'new', 'town', 'science', 'wiz', 'Paul', 'built', 'robot', 'named', 'BB', 'scholarship', 'Western', 'Polytech', 'local', 'college', 'Paul', 'quickly', 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'named', 'Tom', 'Michael', 'Sharrett', 'Samantha', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'next', 'door.Paul', 'strange', 'guy', 'really', 'intelligent', 'performing', 'research', 'brain', 'lecturing', 'class', 'college', 'other', 'hand', 'often', 'think', 'act', 'little', 'kid', 'Paul', 'Tom', 'Sam', 'seem', 'overly', 'fascinated', 'cranky', 'Elvira', 'Parker', 'Anne', 'Ramsey', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'chain', 'link', 'fence', 'house', 'habit', 'pointing', 'loaded', 'shotgun', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'steer', 'clear', 'nutjob', 'Halloween', 'Paul', 'BB', 'open', 'Parker', 'locked', 'gate', 'quickly', 'robot', 'being', 'blasted', 'pieces', 'genius', 'move', 'heartbroken', 'Paul', 'salvage', 'BB', 'CPU.Paul', 'working', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'possessive', 'abusive', 'father', 'Richard', 'Marcus', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'One', 'evening', 'Sam', 'pushed', 'stairs', 'father', 'head', 'put', 'life', 'support', 'hospital', 'Paul', 'Tom', 'help', 'hospital', 'Sam', 'dead', 'body', 'hoping', 're-animate', 'Paul', 'BB', 'CPU', 'brain', 'back', 'home.The', 'result', 'limited', 'success', 'Sam', 'can', 'move', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'much', 'what', 'happening', 'Sam', 'apparently', 'sense', 'consciousness', 'similar', 'robot', 'BB', 'One', 'thing', 'understand', 'concept', 'revenge', 'Sam', 'first', 'things', 'really', 'hot', 'father', 'then', 'apparently', 'still', 'holding', 'grudge', 'being', 'blasted', 'pieces', 'up', 'dealing', 'Ms.', 'Parker', 'Samantha', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'more', 'human', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'late.Kristy', 'Swanson', 'pretty', 'good', 'normal', 'Samantha', 'so', 'great', 're-animated', 'Sam', 'slow', 'moving', 'robotic', 'performance', 'accompanied', 'blank', 'look', 'face', 'often', 'ready', 'break', 'smile', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'Craven', 'wanted', 'times', 'almost', 'more', 'funny', 'scary.Bloody', 'dream', 'sequences', 'burned', 'corpse', 'are', 'couple', 'elements', 'attributable', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'silly', 'slow-moving', 'film', 'aimed', 'mostly', 'juvenile', 'audience', 'Character', 'development', 'very', 'poor', 'story', 'full', 'holes', 'director', 'who', 'even', 'point', 'career', 'had', 'clearly', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'type', 'effort', 'something', 'disappointment', 'similar', 'themes', 'asRe-Animator', '1985', 'comparisons', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fair', 'Deadly', 'Friend', 'nowhere', 'suspense', 'frenetic', 'action', 'camp', 'value', 'rates', 'just', '2.5', 'stars']",N/A

""Deadly Friend"" is a Wes Craven film that combines drama/romantic comedy/sci-fi horror all into one to make for a very interesting and unusual movie. This movie contains a pet robot, a crotchety old woman's head exploding via basketball, and a pair of teenagers sneaking into the hospital in the middle of the night. If any of those events appeal to you at all, I have a feeling you'll enjoy this movie thoroughly!
