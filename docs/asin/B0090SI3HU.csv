1580178,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B0090SI3HU,Andre Dursin,"[0, 0]","""How I Met Your Mother"" star Josh Radnor's second film as writer-director is a genial tale of a New York City college admissions officer asked by one of his former professors (Richard Jenkins) to return to their idyllic Ohio college to pay tribute to his retiring teacher. There, he's infatuated with Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen), the 19-year-old daughter of Jenkins' friends, who's currently enrolled on campus. Radnor is likeable as the 35-year-old trying to settle down but navigating rocky relationships in order to get there; his movie is a bit rough around the edges but has plenty of perceptive dialogue and amiable performances, making ""Liberal Arts"" worth seeing (Zac Efron also makes an unbilled appearance).

1580189,A3KU995HEIFDNG,B0090SI3HU,Considering Film (Christopher Bruno),"[1, 3]","Walking across a college campus is an evocative image, conjuring halcyon days of unfettered didactic discourse and effortlessly lateral social expansion.  I felt that way before I had been to college, imagining it as some cobblestoned Shangri-La, splendid in both its verdant summers and the spartan white of its winters.  Once I was in college, and despite all evidence to the contrary, I continued to feel this way; with the right song on my iPod, the long humps across campus to get from one class to the next became the expeditious moments of my personal bildungsroman, the interstitial digestion of the knowledge upon which I had voraciously gorged myself.  Half a decade removed from the annals of higher learning, I still wrap the image in a soft patina of wistful yearning, understanding now, more fully than ever, that those were the moments that most perfectly encapsulated the impossibly dichotomous quintessence of university: the languid vagabonding and the rigorous intellectual pursuit, the freedom from consequence and the promise of progress, the movement outward as well as upward.That these ephemeral, inconsequential promenades retain their gilded aura is a testimony to the promise of college more so than the actuality, as anyone who has ever crammed for a final or stayed up all night to finish a thesis can attest.  But that promise was a beautiful one, trimmed with the satisfaction of self-government and willful diligence.  Josh Radnor, no doubt, acutely understands the power of that image as a metaphor, and employs it beautifully in Liberal Arts, his second feature as writer-director-star.  What makes it a good film is his ability to illustrate the discord between the Platonic ideal and the objective reality of the university machine; what makes it a great film is Radnor's lack of cynicism and variegated perspective as he does so.Radnor plays Jesse Fisher, an admissions officer for a university in New York, who spends virtually every waking moment of his life with a book in hand.  Recently separated from his girlfriend and worn down by the numbing redundancy of his job, Jesse, personally invited by one of his former professors to attend his retirement dinner, jumps at the chance to spend a weekend back in Ohio, traipsing about his alma mater.  The professor in question, Peter Hoberg, is one of the great collegiate archetypes: the baby boomer to whom higher education was a means of political protest and social activism who has returned to breed a generation of literate, conscious, and progressive minds.  As Peter, Richard Jenkins lends an aloof and credible ease to some of the script's broader characterizations, giving him just the right touch of integrity, authority, and self-efficacy.While staying with Peter, Jesse is introduced to Zibby (a radiant Elizabeth Olsen), a drama student whose mother was in Peter's class years before.  Zibby has many of the trappings of the manic-pixie-dream-girl, and yet avoids all of the common pitfalls of such a character.  Assured and sprightly, Zibby senses an immediate connection between herself and Jesse despite their sixteen year age gap.  Following a chance meeting on campus later that night, Jesse agrees to meet Zibby for coffee the next day.  Zibby speaks of herself in the beautifully distilled expository manner only afforded by first dates and the movies.  She explains how her improv class has taught her to ""say yes to everything,"" and to approach life both on and off the stage with an openness to all of its possibilities; she enthuses about her Introduction to Classical Music class, which has acquainted her a world of beauty previously unknown to her.  Despite his better judgment, Jesse finds himself under Zibby's spell.When Jesse returns to New York, Zibby leaves him with that ultimate totem of modern courtship: a mixtape.  Handing him a burned CD of pieces by Mozart, Vivaldi, Wagner, and other composers, Zibby urges Jesse to write to her -- to really write, with pen and paper.  The relationship that unfolds between them via post is innocent, erudite, and sincere, as they elucidate and share their personal relationships to the works of these great composers.  ""Grace, I realized, was neither time nor place dependent,"" Jesse writes, ""all we need is the right soundtrack.""Radnor's deep love and respect for both the written word and the profound impact of music are apparent, but his wide-eyed, rapturous zeal for the pillars of western art prevents his appreciation from becoming too dry or scholarly.  To put a finer point to it, there is nothing snobbish about Liberal Arts, a quality which was no doubt of concern to Radnor in its writing.  In fact, ""snobbish"" is the very term Zibby lobs at Jesse when he tells her that college is not simply about understanding different points of view, but ""also about developing taste.""  That his delivery belies the implicit condescension of such a statement speaks to Radnor's strengths as both an actor and a director.  Rather than take sides with either Zibby or Jesse, Radnor recognizes the truth in the great Dylan lyric ""You're right form your side / I'm right from mine"" and the role of perspective in determining truth.  Jesse wonders aloud whether he and Zibby connect because she's advanced or because he's stunted; Radnor realizes it's because they meet somewhere in between.I dare not reveal how Jesse and Zibby's relationship unfurls; though it is not quite unexpected, it is absolutely right, and it is rare for this sort of film to eschew the more impractical tropes of relationship films in favor of a more considered, authentic, and earned resolution.  ""Guilt before we act is called morality,"" Jesse says at one point in the film, and this struggle with the weight of consequences both real and perceived -- the ""struggle between sacred and profane love,"" to borrow his description of Wagner's Tannhauser -- comprises the film's ethical and philosophical core.Allison Janney is reliably impeccable in a small but significant role as the British Romantic Literature professor with whom Jesse briefly reconnects and John Magaro is memorable as Dean, a sensitive, literate college student who opens up to Jesse after discovering a shared admiration for David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest.  Through Jesse's interactions with the both of them, Radnor is able to explore the pitfalls of idolatry and the moral imperative of a deep interpersonal connection.  It is in these scenes that Liberal Arts is its most altruistic, humane, and assertive in its promotion of benevolence and generosity.As an actor, Radnor has a perfectly restrained and affable demeanor that plays well with everyone in the cast.  He's equal parts Cusack and Piven, alchemizing their strengths and downplaying the cartoonish exaggerations native to the broad suburban fantasies of the eighties.  He never feels like he's playing the straight man, but his careful understatement perfectly frames Olsen's endearing turn as Zibby.  While less natural and unaffected than she was inMartha Marcy May Marlene [Blu-ray] (an appropriate choice for playing a genial drama student), Olsen is just as confident and sublime as she has ever been; she continues to be one of the most interesting and promising young actresses working today.  Zac Efron plays delightfully against type as a new-agey deus ex machina, stealing most of his few scenes.  But it's Elizabeth Reaser's effortless charm as an introverted bookstore clerk which ultimately makes her the warmest and most touching character in the film.With Liberal Arts, Josh Radnor has not only shown significant growth as a writer and director, he has miraculously managed to romanticize both the past and the future in a manner that is both engaging and reaffirming.  ""This right now, all this stuff you're feeling,"" Jesse tells Dean late in the film, ""this is a footnote.""  That may be, but sometimes the footnotes are the most interesting parts of a story.[originally published on Considering Film]",5,Josh Radnor's Affectionate Footnote,1363305600,"03 15,

1580191,A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B0090SI3HU,Darren O'Neill,"[1, 2]","I decided to check out this movie because I am a fan of Josh Radnor, both from the television series ""How I Met Your Mother"" and his first filmHappythankyoumoreplease.  Here in ""Liberal Arts"" Radnor wrote, directed and stars in the film.  Judging from the quick synopsis that I read before seeing the movie, I was expecting a bit more of a romantic comedy but was pleasantly surprised to find a film with a little more heart and soul to it.Josh Radnor plays Jesse Fisher, a 35 year old New York college admissions officer who, fresh off a break-up, jumps at a chance to return to his alma mater in Ohio for a retirement dinner for one of his favorite professors.  There he is introduced to 19 year old Zibby, played by Elizabeth Olsen, who is passionate about improv, classical music and reading.  The two connect over their love of reading, and as Radnor heads back to New York Zibby gives him a mix CD of her favorite classical music in order to broaden his playlist beyond unknown Indie bands.  She writes her phone number in the CD case, but tells Jesse how much she loves the handwritten word so the two start exchanging letters discussing the music.It is through those letters that their relationship builds.  It is interesting that this simple act of exchanging handwritten letters really does change your perception of the relationship.  There is just something so much more personal, so much more romantic when pen is put to paper.  We are living in a society where text messages and Tweets are the preferred method of communication so it was refreshing to see two people communicating through long, thought-out letters.In one of those letters Zibby invites Jesse to come back and see her.  It is then where things start to get interesting as it was easy enough for Jesse to not define his relationship with the young coed through their written correspondence, the case could still be made for them just being friends, or kindred spirits or even that Jesse was just a mentor to young Zibby.  To say much more might spoil the movie.I thought that the movie dealt with the process of growing up in a poignant way.  When Jesse's old professor lets him in on the dirty little secret that nobody really feels like an adult, that we all mostly feel 19 years old even as we age well past that number.  I think that really hit the mark here as Jesse decides the path he should take with Zibby and his life in general.This is not your typical romantic comedy, it is more a story of finding the path that you are meant to be on and how it is sometimes much easier to retreat and find yourself back on familiar ground.  It is a quiet little movie filled with characters that you can relate to and characters that you care about.

1580195,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0090SI3HU,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","This lightweight 2012 dramedy marks the sophomore effort of screenwriter/director Josh Radnor who is better known as being part of the ensemble of the long-running CBS sitcomHow I Met Your Mother. Similar to another directorial venture from an actor with TV roots, Zach Braff'sGarden State, it's a charming enough effort, quite literate but ultimately inconsequential. He cast himself as Jesse Fisher, a 35-year-old admissions counselor who leaves New York to visit his bucolic alma mater in Ohio to attend the retirement party for Peter Hoberg, one of his favorite professors. In a decidedly nostalgic mood, Jesse strikes up a platonic relationship with Zibby, a 19-year-old sophomore who appreciates classical music, loves her improv class, and unapologetically enjoys vampire romance novels. Radnor deftly wraps his story in the romance of academia and cultural discernment at the same time showing his character's discontent about growing old without fulfilling the dreams he held in his youth on the same campus.Radnor must think Jesse's discontent is endemic since he also shows Hoberg grappling with post-retirement life as well as the harsh cynicism of Judith Fairfield, a Romantics professor who reveals herself as a cougar holding no sentiment about former students who worshipped her in the classroom. There's also sad-eyed Dean, a suicidal student whom Jesse sees as a kindred spirit, and a new-age eccentric named Nat who pops up now and then to tell Jesse to go with the flow. Meanwhile, the courtship between Jesse and Zibby is handled with chaste affection until they face the inevitable moment when they face what their relationship is about. Radnor is amiable as the sometimes condescending Jesse, but his puppyish manner doesn't leave an indelible impression. He got lucky with the superb actors he was able to secure. Richard Jenkins (The Visitor) plays Hoberg with fierce pride and vulnerability, expertly handling a scene where the humiliated professor asks for his job back. As Fairfield, Allison Janney (The Help) lends her sharp-tongued brand of steely intelligence to a character type we have seen from her many times.Once again, Elizabeth Olsen shows how she is shaping a fine career in small indie films - a standout inMartha Marcy May Marlene, one of the few redeeming features ofPeace, Love and Misunderstandingand now this assured turn as an open-minded, precocious coed who begins to see Jesse as the soulmate who could transcend their significant age difference. She brings a smart, zestful quality that helps the film glide over its potentially more unsavory moments. John Magaro plays Dean close to the vest since the part appears ill-defined, while Zac Efron is merely distracting playing strictly against type as Nat. Playing what amounts to a convenient plot device, Elizabeth Reaser (Sweet Land - A Love Story) has a few brief scenes as an age-appropriate bookstore clerk back in New York. Cinematographer Seamus Tierney filmed Radnor's story on the campus of the actor's actual alma mater, Kenyon College, where Janney also graduated. It's a pretty place that will make you become wistful about your own college days.",3,"Radnor Relives His College Days with a Lightweight, Literate Romantic Dramedy",1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,3157,"['lightweight', '2012', 'dramedy', 'sophomore', 'effort', 'screenwriter/director', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'who', 'better', 'known', 'being', 'part', 'ensemble', 'long-running', 'CBS', 'sitcomHow', 'Met', 'Mother', 'Similar', 'directorial', 'venture', 'actor', 'TV', 'roots', 'Zach', ""Braff'sGarden"", 'State', 'charming', 'enough', 'effort', 'quite', 'literate', 'ultimately', 'inconsequential', 'cast', 'Jesse', 'Fisher', '35-year-old', 'admissions', 'counselor', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'visit', 'bucolic', 'alma', 'mater', 'Ohio', 'attend', 'retirement', 'party', 'Peter', 'Hoberg', 'one', 'favorite', 'professors', 'decidedly', 'nostalgic', 'mood', 'Jesse', 'up', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'Zibby', '19-year-old', 'sophomore', 'who', 'classical', 'music', 'improv', 'class', 'unapologetically', 'vampire', 'romance', 'novels', 'Radnor', 'deftly', 'story', 'romance', 'academia', 'cultural', 'discernment', 'same', 'time', 'showing', 'character', 'discontent', 'growing', 'old', 'fulfilling', 'dreams', 'held', 'youth', 'same', 'campus.Radnor', 'must', 'think', 'Jesse', 'discontent', 'endemic', 'also', 'Hoberg', 'grappling', 'post-retirement', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'harsh', 'cynicism', 'Judith', 'Fairfield', 'Romantics', 'professor', 'who', 'cougar', 'holding', 'sentiment', 'former', 'students', 'who', 'worshipped', 'classroom', 'also', 'sad-eyed', 'Dean', 'suicidal', 'student', 'whom', 'Jesse', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'new-age', 'eccentric', 'named', 'Nat', 'who', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'tell', 'Jesse', 'go', 'flow', 'Meanwhile', 'courtship', 'Jesse', 'Zibby', 'handled', 'chaste', 'affection', 'face', 'inevitable', 'moment', 'when', 'face', 'what', 'relationship', 'about', 'Radnor', 'amiable', 'sometimes', 'condescending', 'Jesse', 'puppyish', 'manner', ""n't"", 'leave', 'indelible', 'impression', 'got', 'lucky', 'superb', 'actors', 'was', 'able', 'secure', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Visitor', 'Hoberg', 'fierce', 'pride', 'vulnerability', 'expertly', 'handling', 'scene', 'where', 'humiliated', 'professor', 'asks', 'job', 'back', 'Fairfield', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Help', 'sharp-tongued', 'brand', 'steely', 'intelligence', 'character', 'type', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times.Once', 'again', 'Elizabeth', 'Olsen', 'how', 'shaping', 'fine', 'career', 'small', 'indie', 'films', 'standout', 'inMartha', 'Marcy', 'May', 'Marlene', 'one', 'few', 'redeeming', 'features', 'ofPeace', 'Love', 'Misunderstandingand', 'now', 'assured', 'turn', 'open-minded', 'precocious', 'coed', 'who', 'see', 'Jesse', 'soulmate', 'who', 'could', 'transcend', 'significant', 'age', 'difference', 'smart', 'zestful', 'quality', 'film', 'glide', 'potentially', 'more', 'unsavory', 'moments', 'John', 'Magaro', 'Dean', 'close', 'vest', 'part', 'ill-defined', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'merely', 'distracting', 'playing', 'strictly', 'type', 'Nat', 'Playing', 'what', 'amounts', 'convenient', 'plot', 'device', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'Sweet', 'Land', 'Love', 'Story', 'few', 'brief', 'scenes', 'age-appropriate', 'bookstore', 'clerk', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'Cinematographer', 'Seamus', 'Tierney', 'filmed', 'Radnor', 'story', 'campus', 'actor', 'actual', 'alma', 'mater', 'Kenyon', 'College', 'where', 'Janney', 'also', 'graduated', 'pretty', 'place', 'will', 'make', 'become', 'wistful', 'own', 'college', 'days']",Liberal Arts

1580197,A38M4BOJ8XXH1X,B0090SI3HU,"Flippy ""Buchlieber""","[2, 5]","Though I didn't fall in love with Happythankyoumoreplease, I think Josh Radnor has a lot to add in the world of modern film. He, like John Cusack, has an admirable everyman quality and the fact that he writes and directs, brings an auteur like approach to his cinematic presence.Firstly, I enjoyed this movie despite what I felt were some of the film's flaws (which I'll get to shortly). Josh plays Jesse, a wider-eyed but more down-to-earth, bearded romantic version of his Ted Mosby character on How I Met Your Mother. He lives in New York City, the greatest city in the world, a place where his laundry is stolen in the first ten minutes of the film by a chubby kid. He is recently dumped and yet still, he forges on, happy to get a call from a former professor, Peter Hoberg (Jenkins). Hoberg is having a quasi-retirement party and wants Jesse up there in Ohio as a guest.Not long after his bucolic drive through the Arcadian countryside of Ohio (a nice contrast to the drab and dour apartment and city scenes in New York), Jesse finds myself back in his favourite professor's presence. Through Hoberg, he meets friends of the said professor and their precocious, equally wide-eyed daughter, Zibby (Olsen), a theatre student with a love of improv. Though the retirement dinner isn't the most exciting, Jesse finds himself on nostalgia lane, wandering the campus at night, bumping into Nat (Zac Efron). Nat is somewhere between a stoner and a Zen Master sage, a bit of a trickers and urges Jesse to follow him. Nat hears music. Let's go check it out. Jesse doesn't want to but Nat convinces him to be adventurous.At the party, coincidentally and pleasantly, Zibby bumps into Jesse.From there, the relationship blossoms, in montages of campus walking scenes and then through letters. Zibby introduces Jesse to classical music and through various montages of New York, Radnor has Jesse walking the street, ear-budded, listening to the likes of Mozart's 'Cosi Fan Tutti' and Beethoven's Pastoral, not to forget Massenet's 'Meditation' from the opera Thais.Of course, crunch time has to come because Jesse isn't nineteen and Zibby is certainly not thirty-five and though they've been writing letters, epistles does not a romantic-comedy, let a lone dramedy make.Again, I really enjoyed this film but I found the dramatic moments added little weight or substance to the film. For instance (my first flaw): Hoberg's attempt to get out of retirement struck me as a bit pathetic and out of character. There was a kind of mean-spirited desperation to his argument with the head of the department. I found this a bit distracting and though it tried to balance the love-interest going on between Zibby and Jesse, I didn't find it necessary and more off-putting.Moreover, Dean (Magaro), the depressed college student, a closet-bibiophile who is more Holden Caufield than anything, suffers in this film without being offered a solution by the film's end (my second flaw). Dean's presence grounded this film during the time when the precarious love story got off the ground and instead of focusing on Hoberg, I wish Radnor had explored more of Dean. The depression is deeper and can't be solved with anti-depressant drugs and a pep talk by film's end (doing my best to avoid spoiling anything). I related to Dean the most because I was very similar to him, longing for university to be just over. He was a fascinating character and had something to offer.Returning to Zibby and Jesse, the relationship of course has to either blossom or die and it's up to the viewer to find out what happens.Allison Janney playing a now-cold-hearted but still revered English Romantic professor was perfect in her role and could have been the character to best show the soullessness and bureaucratic nonsense of being a tenured professor. Janney's presence was enough in this regard. Having her preach the message of being anti-faculty meetings and politics, this would have opened up possibilities for the script to focus on Dean and give his character some hope as opposed to giving him the Sitcom, Full-House-esque-we're-getting-near-the-credits advice.Still, I'll watch this movie again. It's definitely better than the latest bland, rom-coms without their challenging narrative arcs. Also nice to see Zac Efron do something a bit more looney, less romantic. Though, despite the chemistry of the leads and some rather honest depictions of university life, I didn't think Radnor truly challenged the viewer the way excellent cinema does. I do have a feeling he is on the way and he needs to distance himself from his Ted Mosby persona. This is a fun movie, a great movie at times and definitely one I'll watch again because despite my criticism, Liberal Arts embraces an intelligent audience without being pretentious or annoyingly esoteric.",4,"Pleasant, Endearing and Great for a Saturday Night",1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,4817,"['did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'love', 'Happythankyoumoreplease', 'think', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'lot',

There is no real conflict at any point in the film, and the characters drift between indie-rom-com set pieces until the end.  The writer/director/leading man and a 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' (if you don't know what it is, Google it.  Pretty much it's a shallow and underdeveloped female character who is inexplicably attracted to the typically reserved male protagonist, and she 'brings him out of his shell' and 'teaches him how to live life.)The characters don't develop at all really.  Jesse is a wimp and a loser throughout the film, and he shows no real development until he finally asks a girl out at the end.  (But this isn't development because in the beginning we see he's had an established relationship, and he had no trouble asking out the Manic Pixie Dream Girl.)There are no stakes.  Nothing is at risk.  The best scene takes place with his former college professor, and the only reason it's good is because it's ripped straight out of *The Graduate.*In fact, the entire film could be seen as a vastly inferior remake of *The Graduate.*  (A college grad comes back to his home town/college, meets a younger girl still in college, has a fling with an older woman from his past, obsesses about what he's going to do with his life, etc.)The characters just sit around.

Something lighthearted, not too deep or serious, had some characters that were likable such as the 'wise man in the red hat', characters had some issues that conceivably would be easy for many to relate to, refreshingly not full of foul language or any explicit scenes (in the beginning at least), laugh-out-loud moments, and music that fit the mood of the film. (!!Spoiler Alert!!)....All of this was dampened when the film arrived at the bedroom(s) scene: he wont sleep with Zibby, a young woman of 19/20, because of their age difference and her lack of experience, explaining to her it was based on ""morality"", which he apparently somehow forgot when in the same night, he quickly and easily sleeps with a female professor who is many, many times older than he.I can understand his refusal in the first instance, after all he truly liked and respected the lovely Zibby, had a good friendship with her that looked like it easily could have turned into a wonderful, long-lasting friendship, and he didn't want to ruin that. But then after speaking of having ""morality"", to immediately turn around and bed an old, bitter, mean, selfish, man-user of a professor (who he had absolutely no friendship with) simply because he liked her romantic literature class she taught and because of some twisted infatuation based on the wrong assumption that she would be 'romantic' because of the class she taught, well it seemed hypocritical, far-fetched, unbelievable, unnecessary, and just plain gross. It actually made me dislike his character, and consequently the film too.Had the movie cut out that bar/bedroom scene with the female professor, it would have been a good film, and would have still made all of the meaningful points it was trying so hard to portray with that one horrid scene.",2,Could Have Been Great But Fell Short,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,1930,"['As', 'far', 'product', 'Amazon', 'video', 'player', 'played', 'okay', 'own', 'internet', 'speed/connection.Movie', 'Review', '.the', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'promising', 'Something', 'lighthearted', 'not', 'too', 'deep', 'serious', 'had', 'characters', 'were', 'likable', 'such', ""'wise"", 'man', 'red', 'hat', 'characters', 'had', 'issues', 'conceivably', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'many', 'relate', 'refreshingly', 'not', 'full', 'foul', 'language', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'least', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'music', 'fit', 'mood', 'film', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', '.All', 'was', 'dampened', 'when', 'film', 'arrived', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'sleep', 'Zibby', 'young', 'woman', '19/20', 'age', 'difference', 'lack', 'experience', 'explaining', 'was', 'based', 'morality', 'apparently', 'somehow', 'forgot', 'when', 'same', 'night', 'quickly', 'easily', 'sleeps', 'female', 'professor', 'who', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'older', 'he.I', 'can', 'understand', 'refusal', 'first', 'instance', 'truly', 'liked', 'respected', 'lovely', 'Zibby', 'had', 'good', 'friendship', 'looked', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'wonderful', 'long-lasting', 'friendship', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'then', 'speaking', 'having', 'morality', 'immediately', 'turn', 'around', 'bed', 'old', 'bitter', 'mean', 'selfish', 'man-user', 'professor', 'who', 'had', 'absolutely', 'friendship', 'simply', 'liked', 'romantic', 'literature', 'class', 'taught', 'twisted', 'infatuation', 'based', 'wrong', 'assumption', 'would', 'be', ""'romantic"", 'class', 'taught', 'well', 'seemed', 'hypocritical', 'far-fetched', 'unbelievable', 'unnecessary', 'just', 'plain', 'gross', 'actually', 'made', 'dislike', 'character', 'consequently', 'film', 'too.Had', 'movie', 'cut', 'out', 'bar/bedroom', 'scene', 'female', 'professor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'made', 'meaningful', 'points', 'was', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'portray', 'one', 'horrid', 'scene']",Liberal Arts

It is witty, intelligent, well-acted, adult, textured and beautifully acted, with a gorgeous soundtrack. Our 2012 Seattle International Film Festival audience could scarcely contain ourselves as we exited the theater. We had watched decent people trying to cope with the vagaries of growing up, each at his or her own pace, each with his or her own degree of success.Let's look at some of these nice people:* Josh Radnor (""How I Met Your Mother"") is Jesse, an Admissions officer for a New York City school, called to give a speech for a former professor who is retiring at his old alma mater. He is a bookworm who says a dual English/History degree should make a graduate fully unemployable. He meets a couple of undergrads while visiting his old campus.* Elizabeth Olsen (""Martha Marcy May Marlene"") is Zibby, a young woman wise for her years but who views a relationship with our hero as a possible short-cut to maturity. She gives him a mix-tape filled with works by dead white males, i.e., European composers Wagner, Beethoven, Mozart, Vivaldi and Shubert. That is his FIRST surprise from her! She is smart, decent and has great insight. And she LOVES ""snail mail.""* John Magaro (""My Soul to Take"") is Dean, the other student our hero meets on campus. This guy hates hyperbole and is terminally depressed! He keeps re-reading a book written by an author who killed himself. He's attending college because he got a ""full ride"" scholarship and his single mom is ""soooo proud!""* Richard Jenkins (""The Visitor"") is Peter Hoberg, the professor trying to make the difficult transition to retirement.* Allison Janney (""The Help"") is Judith Fairfield, the acerbic professor who helped our hero learn to love dead white males (in this case the Romantic poets). She thinks he has a ""gooey heart!""* Elizabeth Reaser (the ""Twilight"" trilogy) is Ana, who works in a bookstore. She notices he reads dead white males, authors who shall remain nameless.* Zac Efron (""The Lucky One"") is Nat, who may or may not exist....Writer/director Josh Radnor (""Happythankyoumoreplease"") has a great future ahead. He doesn't talk down to his audience, his characters are literate, witty, decent and earnest.

1580207,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B0090SI3HU,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Little did I know prior to watching Liberal Arts, this is actually Josh Radnor's second film. I love him on How I Met Your Mother and almost instantly went to pick this up when I saw a preview of it on the Why Stop Now DVD. Not only does Josh Radnor play one of the main roles in the film, but he also wrote and directed the film as well. That seems like a lot of work to take on by one man, so how does the film hold up?In my opinion, Liberal Arts is wonderful. The film follows 35 year old Jesse Fisher (Radnor) through what is essentially a turning point in his life. He works in New York City as a college admissions counselor when he receives a call from one of his old college professors, Peter Hoberg (Richard Jenkins). Peter is retiring soon and he wants Jesse to be at the retirement dinner that the school is throwing for him. Jesse, obviously somewhat disappointed with his life thus far, accepts.As Jesse arrives in Ohio he meets a young 19 year old woman named Elizabeth (Elizabeth Olsen), or Zibby for short. As luck would have it, a spark emerges between the two and they become pen pals for a couple of months. That is, until Zibby asks for Jesse to come and visit her. As I type this short summary it feels weird and, please believe me, it really isn't. I won't go into further detail, but as odd as the premise may seem in text, in motion it's wonderful to watch.I'm a sucker for movies like this. I like to consider them diamonds in the rough because there obviously won't be a huge following for Liberal Arts. It isn't an over the top action flick, it isn't an unbelievable love story, there are no good guys, and there are no bad guys. Liberal Arts is a heartfelt story about one man realizing that things in life can be good and that it's ok to actually enjoy life. All he needed was the help of two college students, Zibby and Dean (John Magaro), an old Romantics professor (Allison Janney), and Nat (Zac Efron).From start to finish this film, for me, was a joy to watch. The story was sincere and everyone, and I do mean everyone, gave fantastic performances. The most surprising to me, though, was Efron's performance as Nat. I've only seen Efron in two roles, that god-awful High School Musical and the mediocre 17 Again. Nat's character is somewhat of an enigma so I won't attempt to describe him in words, but Efron nailed it and definitely gained some respect from me.No matter who you are you're bound to have seen Richard Jenkins and Allison Janney in a movie or two. Both gave their usual performances and they were both a joy to watch. The only actors I was unfamiliar with in the main line-up were Elizabeth Olsen and John Magaro. Olsen was phenomenal, as was her character, and she's definitely one of the most adorable actresses to come out in the last few years. Magaro was equally enjoyable as the psychologically troubled Dean.As I said already I did enjoy the film's story, but towards the end things got a little `eh'. Throughout the first two-third's of the film the pacing is amazing. So much so that I was surprised an hour had already passed. Once you hit that hour mark, though, things get a little jumbled. I wasn't expecting the relationship with Zibby to take the course it did and the ending felt a little rushed. Liberal Arts definitely could have benefited from another ten or fifteen minutes added to the overall running time. This would have allowed the ending to be fleshed out a little more.Overall Score: 8.5/10 - To fans of over the top commercial films, Liberal Arts may come off as pretentious. To fans of indie films, Liberal arts may seem a bit cliched. With that said, for me, Liberal Arts was an enjoyable little love story with a great cast.

1580209,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0090SI3HU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[24, 26]","It's fair to say that I wasn't a huge fan of Josh Radnor's first film as a writer/director ""Happythankyoumoreplease."" While the movie had promise and some strong points, it veered a little too far into preciousness and quirk for my taste. I might have been in the minority, though, as the film scored an Audience Award at Sundance. But for me, many of its plot digressions seemed a little too contrived to be taken seriously. In his second effort, ""Liberal Arts,"" I find myself having a similar reaction. Overall, though, the movie works much more cohesively. It strikes some irresistibly bittersweet moments and features some winning performances. But every time Radnor scores with a heartfelt, affectionate, or funny scene, he counters with something too convenient or unbelievable to follow it up. Simply put, ""Liberal Arts"" is a good movie (sometimes very good) that struggles to find a consistent tone. Radnor has talent as both a writer and director, sometimes he just needs to rein in the artificiality that comes with excessive quirk.""Liberal Arts"" relies on a middle-aged nostalgia for one's college days. As a central theme, it is one that strikes a real emotional chord and is something that many of us can easily identify with. Radnor plays a New York City resident who is invited to his small town alma mater to honor a favorite professor (Richard Jenkins). The two men share an easy bond and their scenes together have a quiet poignancy and effectiveness. While there, Radnor becomes entangled with a feisty co-ed (Elizabeth Olsen) despite their sixteen year age difference. There are some fresh comic moments throughout. I especially liked an uncredited Zac Effron as an ethereal life force that connects rather fancifully with Radnor. But there are also moments of deep sadness. Jenkins struggles with his life choices and Radnor has to face the realities of his relationship with the younger Olsen. What does it mean to finally grow up? That's the position Radnor finds himself confronting.The movie has some terrific highlights. Jenkins is great. Allison Janney has an amusing, but brief, side plot. But for me, the movie all but belongs to Olsen. She's so likable and, more importantly, so believable. It's hard to imagine not falling in love with her. Breezy and heartfelt in equal measures, she epitomizes every idealistic crush you might have experienced. When she's on screen the movie soars. I might have lived without a couple of peripheral stories like Radnor inexplicably befriending a troubled student. This is one of the developments that seems far more scripted than real. Still, ""Liberal Arts"" has its heart in the right place. It strikes an appropriately wistful tone and should be an appealing diversion to most. While I wanted to love it (and I did love the central plot of the film), I merely liked it due to some of the extraneous choices. About 3 1/2 stars for me, I'll round up for Olsen who is becoming an increasingly impressive young actress.

Oleson,"[1, 1]","Josh Radnor wrote, directed and has the lead in this seemingly personal story of a guy in his mid-30's returning to his small liberal arts college in central Ohio.  This at the request of one of his favorite and now retiring teachers (Richard Jenkins).  Jesse (Radnor) is a college admissions officer in New York City whose romantic (marriage?) relationship had just ended.  Feeling somewhat depressed by his crummy job and lack of a social life, he agrees to speak for Prof. Holberg at his retirement party.While having dinner with Hoberg, he meets a couple and their 19 year old daughter Elizabeth (Zibby) played with her usual acumen by Elizabeth Olsen.  They are close friends of the professor and their daughter goes to the same unnamed college.  Jesse and Zibby immediately hit it off, especially when it comes to books and authors, well at least until Zibby confesses to being fond of a certain series of novels revolving around a human girl and her affection for a young vampire.Jesse returns to his moribund life but can't get Zibby (he insists on calling her Elizabeth) off his mind, nor she him.  They write each other, send music mixes and talk on the phone.  Jesse finds excuses to return more than once but when Zibby wants to take the relationship to the next level, Jesse balks due to their age difference.  Radnor doesn't break any new ground here but as usual Ms. Olsen breathes life into her character and overcomes the sometimes dour feel of the movie.Jenkins character is an interesting diversion as he reconsiders his retirement.  Allison Janney plays another former teacher of Jesse's which adds another age appropriate relationship question.  This is another one of those small personal stories that provides film comfort food but will have you looking for something else soon after.  Enjoy.The Blu ray version of the film conveys its digitally shot image to a 1080p transfer with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The movie looks very good with adequate sharpness and clarity.  There are no imagery issuees.  The color is strong and vibrant.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  As the movie is dialog centric we don't get much from the surrounds.  Some street noise, a party and the music are well placed around the room.

At least, that is what I thought went I went to see this movie in the theatre this weekend. Boy, was I in for a surprise!""Liberal Arts"" (2012 release; 97 min.) brings the story of Jesse Fisher (played by Josh Radnor), a 35 yr. old college admission officer at some school in New York. One day he gets a call from a retiring professor at his alma mater in Ohio, and Jesse agrees to come for the farewell dinner. While spending the weekend there, Jesse gets to meet Zibby (played by Elizabeth Olsen), a 19 yr. old sophomore, and wouldn't you know it, they hit it off. Soon Jesse returns to NY, but Jesse and Zibby start a penpal relationship the old fashioned way, by actually handwriting letters to each other. There are a number of secondary characters in the movie that are of some interest, none more than the retiring professor (played by Richard Jenkins), who may be regretting his decision; then there is Nate (played by Zac Efron), in a very small role as a non-student college hanger-on with some unique views of the world. At some point Zibby invites Jesse to return for a weekend. Will Jesse and Zibby become romatically involved? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. But I dare say that you will be surprised. That aside, Elizabeth Olsen continues her winning ways (check out last year's ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"").This movie may be marketed as a ""romantic comedy"" but it is so much more than that. In the second half of the movie, Jesse reflects on the age difference with Zibby, while Peter (the retiring professor) reflects on the life that has passed him by. There are a number of scenes involving the topic of ageing (Peter reflects ""the dirty little secret is that nobody views themselves as an adult"") that really spoke to me. This movie must be a labor of love for Josh Radnor, who not only stars in it but also wrote and directed it. By the way, the Ohio scenes were shot in and around Kenyon College here in Ohio. In all, this movie was quite the unexpected but nice surprise for me.

Berner,"[22, 30]","I just watched this movie last night at a theater on the campus of Florida Atlantic University and it was one of the best movies I've seen all year. I mention that it was on a university campus because the staff, all undergraduates, thought the movies was terrific, so it isn't just the opinion of middle aged guys like me. Usually, if I see a movie in the theater, I don't get the DVD, but I will buy this one.Unlike most American movies - even indy's these days - this is a movie that respects its screenwriter. As a result, in plot and dialogue, it is like many foreign movies: designed for serious minded people, grown-ups, which is appropriate for a movie about growing up (no matter how old you are) and the limits of intellect without character. It is hard for me to define the ideas of the movies without making it sound dull, but it is also extraordinarily funny. Even now, 24 hours after I saw the movie, lines of dialogue or certain scenes keep coming back to me, alternately making me laugh or ponder the wisdom of the film, from the hilariously unromantic date with an inspired professor of romantic literature to the trenchant observation that ""guilt before you act is morality,"" this will be a movie I will want to watch many times.",5,A Keeper,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,1247,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'theater', 'campus', 'Florida', 'Atlantic', 'University', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'mention', 'was', 'university', 'campus', 'staff', 'undergraduates', 'thought', 'movies', 'was', 'terrific', ""n't"", 'just', 'opinion', 'middle', 'aged', 'guys', 'Usually', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'DVD', 'will', 'buy', 'one.Unlike', 'most', 'American', 'movies', 'even', 'indy', 'days', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 'result', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'many', 'foreign', 'movies', 'designed', 'serious', 'minded', 'people', 'grown-ups', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'are', 'limits', 'intellect', 'character', 'hard', 'define', 'ideas', 'movies', 'making', 'sound', 'dull', 'also', 'extraordinarily', 'funny', 'Even', 'now', '24', 'hours', 'saw', 'movie', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'certain', 'scenes', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'alternately', 'making', 'ponder', 'wisdom', 'film', 'hilariously', 'unromantic', 'date', 'inspired', 'professor', 'romantic', 'literature', 'trenchant', 'observation', 'guilt', 'act', 'morality', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'many', 'times']",Liberal Arts
