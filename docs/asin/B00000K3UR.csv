Some people think that some intended humor in this movie was pointless and stupid, but I highly dissagree. There are jokes throughout this entire movie, even sometimes during ""emotional"" times. if you haven't seen this movie by now, I feel bad for you, because this movie even has Rob Schneider (Nazo), Sonny's ""best friend"", who is a delivery guy, and is funny throughout the movie. Steve Buscemi is also in this movie, playing the Homeless guy, who also adds some humor into the already funny movie.Why do some people say ""this is a movie that creates bad examples for kids""? Well, yeah it might, but they also must forget the fact this is rated PG-13, so kids if they don't wanna shouldn't watch it then.Anyways, obviously buy this movie.

It really just depends on the kind of story he's involved with for whatever movie he's in.However, this is one really rare moment when his humor is not overbearing and completely tolerable for just about anyone to get into.  You have plenty of emotions where Adam and the child character communicate with each other in such a way where you can't help but enjoy Adam's character.  Every actor needs a movie like this in their long and winding career.Sure, at the time we weren't sure if a comedian such as Adam Sandler would fit in with this kind of role in a movie.

You leave behind the carefree days when someone else was still responsible for you as you took your first steps towards independence.  Our parents did the best they could in cutting the umbilical cord and sending us on our way.  For most of us, this transition felt normal and was achieved without much pain.  However, for a few, growing pains continued beyond what was considered normal or prudent.Over Memorial Day weekend, I sort of had an old movie watching extravaganza and ended up watching a few films.  One of these films was Big Daddy.  Big Daddy was produced in 1999 and featured the Sprouse twins (Dylan and Cole) playing the same role of  Julian ""Frankenstein"" McGrath who is a 5 year child sent from Buffalo, New York to be reunited with this father who he has never seen.  His mother has passed away and she wanted Julian to be with his biological Dad.  Of course, this is also a big surprise for everyone including Gerrity.The unfortunate thing is that Dad (Kevin Gerrity' who is played by Jon Stewart) does not know anything about Julian or in fact that he even exists and as fate has it is on his way to China on business.  Sonny Koufax played by Adam Sandler is the one who opens the door and finds the five year Julian on his stoop.  Sonny in the end finds more than Julian that fateful day and learns a lot about himself.Adam Sandler as his typical funny self plays a bright would be lawyer who  is an irresponsible slob; a guy who cannot get it altogether even though all of his friends have moved on with their careers and lives sort of leaving him far behind.  Adam is feeling this particularly when he opens his door and finds Julian standing there; since Sandler also just found himself losing his girlfriend to boot.The film shows Adam at his funny best and if you are a Sandler fan you will like this movie. Layla Maloney played by Joey Lauren Adams is a sweet role and Adams in this role reminds me a little of Renee Zellwegger in Jerry Maguire.In the final analysis, love wins out and everybody lives happily ever.  The movie promotes family love and values and is a feel good movie which most likely if you are a Jon Stewart or an Adam Sandler fan will not disappoint you.Some coarse segments as another reviewer mentioned which influenced me and was one of the reasons that I did not give it four stars though I enjoyed the movie on the whole very much.  It was funny, light and kept you laughing.  If you intend to watch this flick with your children, there are more than a few stunts that you may not enjoy your own children doing or getting any ideas about.  So be forewarned.

510330,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00000K3UR,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 7]","Adam Sandler is always entertaining, but Big Daddy never really piqued my interest; looking back now, I think the previews of this film did it a disservice.  Certainly, Big Daddy has its course moments, but it's an excellent comedy that just so happens to have a heart.  Some would say this film sets a bad example for kids.  First of all, this isn't one of those education films of the 1950s that tells you how to be a good parent.  More importantly, though, what you have here is a guy who is more than willing to ""grow up"" and change his life in order to be a father to a kid he genuinely loves.  Plenty of fathers in the world raise their kids to be little gentlemen and ladies, but often it's more about a father not wanting his son or daughter to embarrass him than it is about genuine fatherly love.  To me, Big Daddy is - in its own quirky, Sandler-ish way - a tribute to all the fathers out there who genuinely love their children.As usual, Sandler plays a character who has never really grown up; Sonny Koufax is a law school graduate, but he works in a toll booth one day a week and basically tries to live as if he is still an undergrad.  His girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) wants a man of means and goals, and he's trying to figure out how to get her back when little Julian (played by Cole and Dylan Sprouse) is literally dropped at his doorstep.  It's not even his kid; the biological father is Sonny's roommate who has just left town on business.  Sonny tells his newly-engaged buddy that he will handle everything, initially planning just to keep the kid until Social Services opens the next day - but he can't let little Julian be tossed into an orphanage.  He doesn't exactly follow Dr. Spock's rules for parenthood, but Sonny soon comes to love the little tyke - even after it becomes clear that he and Vanessa are through.  When Social Services finds a family for Julian, Sonny can't give him up - until he's forced to.  The fact that he posed as the kid's biological father doesn't stand him in good stead when he tries to get custody of the kid, but he's determined to try.Sonny teaches Julian a lot of dubious things, but he also does the kid right when he realizes that his laissez faire parenting method isn't what is best for the child when it comes to schoolwork and the like - and he comes up with some pretty ingenious ways to inspire Julian.  Before this film is through, there are actually a few heartwarming moments - which are accomplished without sacrificing any of the comedy.  The cast is great (even Jon Stewart isn't all that bad); Joey Lauren Adams in particular brings a special something to the film as Sonny's new girlfriend.I don't, as a rule, enjoy comedies built around children doing some of the disgusting things that children do, but Big Daddy was a pleasant, very entertaining surprise.  You can't really go wrong with a Sandler movie - laughs are guaranteed, and there's almost always much more to the story than you might expect.",5,"Sometimes course, but genuinely funny and even heart-warming",1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,2985,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'never', 'really', 'piqued', 'interest', 'looking', 'back', 'now', 'think', 'previews', 'film', 'did', 'disservice', 'Certainly', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'course', 'moments', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'just', 'so', 'have', 'heart', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'bad', 'example', 'kids', 'First', 'all', ""n't"", 'one', 'education', 'films', '1950s', 'tells', 'how', 'be', 'good', 'parent', 'More', 'importantly', 'though', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'guy', 'who', 'more', 'willing', 'grow', 'up', 'change', 'life', 'order', 'be', 'father', 'kid', 'genuinely', 'Plenty', 'fathers', 'world', 'raise', 'kids', 'be', 'little', 'gentlemen', 'ladies', 'often', 'more', 'father', 'not', 'wanting', 'son', 'daughter', 'embarrass', 'genuine', 'fatherly', 'love', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'own', 'quirky', 'Sandler-ish', 'way', 'tribute', 'fathers', 'who', 'genuinely', 'love', 'children.As', 'usual', 'Sandler', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'grown', 'up', 'Sonny', 'Koufax', 'law', 'school', 'graduate', 'toll', 'one', 'day', 'week', 'basically', 'tries', 'live', 'still', 'undergrad', 'girlfriend', 'Vanessa', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'man', 'means', 'goals', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'back', 'when', 'little', 'Julian', 'played', 'Cole', 'Dylan', 'Sprouse', 'literally', 'dropped', 'doorstep', 'not', 'even', 'kid', 'biological', 'father', 'Sonny', 'roommate', 'who', 'just', 'left', 'town', 'business', 'Sonny', 'newly-engaged', 'buddy', 'will', 'handle', 'everything', 'initially', 'planning', 'just', 'keep', 'kid', 'Social', 'Services', 'next', 'day', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'little', 'Julian', 'be', 'tossed', 'orphanage', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'follow', 'Dr.', 'Spock', 'rules', 'parenthood', 'Sonny', 'soon', 'love', 'little', 'tyke', 'even', 'clear', 'Vanessa', 'are', 'When', 'Social', 'Services', 'family', 'Julian', 'Sonny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'forced', 'fact', 'posed', 'kid', 'biological', 'father', ""n't"", 'stand', 'good', 'stead', 'when', 'get', 'custody', 'kid', 'determined', 'try.Sonny', 'teaches', 'Julian', 'lot', 'dubious', 'things', 'also', 'kid', 'right', 'when', 'laissez', 'faire', 'parenting', 'method', ""n't"", 'what', 'best', 'child', 'when', 'schoolwork', 'like', 'up', 'pretty', 'ingenious', 'ways', 'inspire', 'Julian', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'few', 'heartwarming', 'moments', 'are', 'accomplished', 'sacrificing', 'comedy', 'cast', 'great', 'even', 'Jon', 'Stewart', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'particular', 'brings', 'special', 'something', 'film', 'Sonny', 'new', 'girlfriend.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'rule', 'enjoy', 'comedies', 'built', 'children', 'doing', 'disgusting', 'things', 'children', 'do', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'was', 'pleasant', 'very', 'entertaining', 'surprise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'wrong', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'laughs', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'almost', 'always', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'might', 'expect']",N/A

After a kid gets dropped off at his apartment, he finds out that the kid is his roommates' (Jon Stewart)  Sonny than tells his roommate that he'll watch the kid until he got back from a business trip.  It's a really sweet and cute father and son movie with a comedy twist on parenting.Now I went into this movie not knowing the story and me and my best friend saw this moving thinking that it was going to be another great Sandler comedy.

I appreciate his humor, don't ask me why but I find him funny. Most critics batter him for childish antics, bathroom humor, violent slapstick, and immaturity. True, he can childish and immature in his humor, but he is just lovable enough to get away with it. Anyway, the people I know like to laugh at the one-liners and antics of BILLY MADISON, HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WATERBOY. but not a lot people talk about BIG DADDY as much, and that's too bad.Meet Sonny (Sandler), a 32-year-old law school grad on the fast track to nowhere: Rather than take a high-paying job in a high-powered New York City firm, Sonny works one night a week in a tollbooth and hangs out with the deli delivery guy (Rob Schneider). Now meet Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), a cute five-year-old who appears on Sonny's doorstep with a note from his mom claiming he's the illegitimate son of Sonny's best law-school buddy Kevin (Jon Stewart), who's just left for China. No problem, thinks Sonny: A son will get his life on track and help him win back his wayward girlfriend (Kristy Swanson). But when a compromising situation arises and Sonny's girlfriend dumps him, Sonny gets desperate and has social services look for a family that can take Julian. Instead of letting Julian end up in an orphanage he volenteers to look after him, giving the kid options instead of orders, letting him dress however he likes, bathe when he wants and eat what he likes, but soon he realizes that he needs to set boundries for the kid in order for him to excell school. Sonny starts to bond with the kid. But after ignoring calls from social services, Sonny is taken to court for Fraudulently hold Julian under his biological father's name.I think this is one of Sandler's best, not only because he's downplaying his humor impulse to stutter like Bobby Boucher, get violent like Happy Gilmore, or act childish like Billy Madison. But because he seems to have matured a bit as an actor and as a person. His humor is dry, but funny. Rob Schnider is hilarious as Nazo the delivery guy, and Steve Buscemi is uproarious as the homeless guy. Adam has really come a far way since BILLY MADISON, he's a hell of a lot more calmer, and a little bit more likable to the non-Sandler-fan community. Yes there is some bodily humor here, but it's marginal and it doesn't come from Adam, which is good because it wouldn't wear well on a man in his mid-30s as it would on a little kid. All in all, if you're not a Sandler-fan, you're better off not watching his earlier stuff first, because he can get carried away with the childish humor, so start off slow and watch BIG DADDY, THE WEDDING SINGER, or 50 FIRST DATES.",5,Probably one of Sandler's most unappreciated,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,2749,"['Yes', 'am', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan', ""'m"", 'not', 'obsessed', 'about', 'other', 'fans', 'are', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'find', 'funny', 'Most', 'critics', 'batter', 'childish', 'antics', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'violent', 'slapstick', 'immaturity', 'True', 'can', 'childish', 'immature', 'humor', 'just', 'lovable', 'enough', 'get', 'away', 'Anyway', 'people', 'know', 'laugh', 'one-liners', 'antics', 'BILLY', 'MADISON', 'HAPPY', 'GILMORE', 'WATERBOY', 'not', 'lot', 'people', 'talk', 'BIG', 'DADDY', 'much', 'too', 'bad.Meet', 'Sonny', 'Sandler', '32-year-old', 'law', 'school', 'grad', 'fast', 'track', 'nowhere', 'Rather', 'take', 'high-paying', 'job', 'high-powered', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'firm', 'Sonny', 'one', 'night', 'week', 'tollbooth', 'hangs', 'out', 'deli', 'delivery', 'guy', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Now', 'Julian', 'Cole', 'Dylan', 'Sprouse', 'cute', 'five-year-old', 'who', 'Sonny', 'doorstep', 'note', 'mom', 'claiming', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Sonny', 'best', 'law-school', 'buddy', 'Kevin', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'who', 'just', 'left', 'China', 'problem', 'Sonny', 'son', 'will', 'get', 'life', 'track', 'help', 'win', 'back', 'wayward', 'girlfriend', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'when', 'compromising', 'situation', 'arises', 'Sonny', 'girlfriend', 'Sonny', 'desperate', 'social', 'services', 'look', 'family', 'can', 'take', 'Julian', 'Instead', 'letting', 'Julian', 'end', 'up', 'orphanage', 'look', 'giving', 'kid', 'options', 'instead', 'orders', 'letting', 'dress', 'however', 'bathe', 'when', 'eat', 'what', 'soon', 'set', 'boundries', 'kid', 'order', 'excell', 'school', 'Sonny', 'bond', 'kid', 'ignoring', 'calls', 'social', 'services', 'Sonny', 'taken', 'court', 'Fraudulently', 'hold', 'Julian', 'biological', 'father', 'name.I', 'think', 'one', 'Sandler', 'best', 'not', 'only', 'downplaying', 'humor', 'impulse', 'stutter', 'Bobby', 'Boucher', 'get', 'violent', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'act', 'childish', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'have', 'matured', 'bit', 'actor', 'person', 'humor', 'dry', 'funny', 'Rob', 'Schnider', 'hilarious', 'Nazo', 'delivery', 'guy', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'uproarious', 'homeless', 'guy', 'Adam', 'really', 'come', 'far', 'way', 'BILLY', 'MADISON', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'calmer', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'likable', 'non-Sandler-fan', 'community', 'Yes', 'bodily', 'humor', 'here', 'marginal', ""n't"", 'come', 'Adam', 'good', 'would', ""n't"", 'wear', 'well', 'man', 'mid-30s', 'would', 'little', 'kid', ""'re"", 'not', 'Sandler-fan', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'not', 'watching', 'earlier', 'stuff', 'first', 'can', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'childish', 'humor', 'start', 'slow', 'watch', 'BIG', 'DADDY', 'THE', 'WEDDING', 'SINGER', '50', 'FIRST', 'DATES']",N/A

The idea of Adam Sandler being a father at all, never mind a good father, is extremely absurd. Adam Sandler would probably show the same parenting skills in real life as he did in the first half of the movie. I wouldn't approve of a kid having a big neon sign in his room that says &quot;LIVE NUDES&quot;, especially one at that age. I wouldn't want my kid to trip rollerbladers that go really fast. It would be funny, but I wouldn't want my kid dripping spit out of his mouth and slurping it back up.

Searle have long considered the perplexing existence (or theoretical existence) of consciousness to be one of the great mysteries of life.  Equally perplexing a mystery is the popularity of  Adam Sandler and his abominable films, indisputable proof of the existence  of unconsciousness.  For a journey that thoroughly explores the utter pits  of refuse, feel free to watch Big Daddy, an eccentric piece about an  unmotivated slacker (Sandler) who develops a sense of responsibility while  caring for an abandoned child (Julian, played by twins Cole and Dylan  Sprouse).Sandler plays the part of Deadbeat Big Daddy, showing the  five-year old how to, among other things, urinate in public and make bed  sheets out of old newspapers.  Most depressing is the apparent joy the film  takes out of exposing the kid to some predominantly adult situations,  including a constant barrage of tiresome Hooters jokes.  Tack on one of the  silliest (and longest) courtroom scenes ever put on celluloid, and you've  got yourself a real turkey.That being said, Bid Daddy does have a few  clever moments.  The way Sandler tries to keep Julian away from drugs by  interrogating several of his school friends is hilarious and almost  heartwarming.  Rob Schneider and Joey Lauren Adams also turn in competent  performances.  Unfortunately, there is not nearly enough good to outweigh  the bad, so I cannot recommend this film.

Zwick,"[1, 2]","It's hard not to like &quot;Big Daddy&quot;, though diehard fans of Adam Sandler may well cringe at this further step in the sentimentalization of  the comic actor. For although this film has raised the hackles of a number  of overly sensitive worrywarts for its seeming endorsement of permissive  parenting, the film is, in reality, far more soft-hearted than hard-edged.  Actually, this seems to be, probably, the wisest direction for Sandler to  go in at the moment because, as an actor, he conveys an aura of genuine  likability that fits well with his Average Joe persona. &quot;Big  Daddy&quot; might have been a better film if it had not given in so easily  to sentimentality and predictable emotional uplift, but Sandler's deadpan  portrayal of an immature adult forced to grow up into responsibility-laden  fatherhood makes the film relatively enjoyable.Sandler portrays a  30-something loser living in South Manhattan, who has been milking a minor  foot injury to the tune of a $200,000 court settlement and whose life,  consequently, consists of miniscule employment, a general lack of  direction, and a girlfriend who's ready to move on to an older man with a  &quot;5-year plan&quot;. When a little boy suddenly shows up on his  doorstep (the hitherto unknown son of a friend of his), Sandler decides to  temporarily take him under his wing in the hopes of winning his girlfriend  back. Thus, a man with almost no resources of adult maturity attempts to  instill skewed life lessons into a willing, highly impressionable young  mind. This leads to Sandler's teaching the boy to indulge in predictable,  but surprisingly timid, antisocial behavior such as urinating on public  buildings, staying up late, tripping unsuspecting rollerbladers etc. The  film is not always at its peak of creative freshness at such times, but  Sandler's lowkey cynicism provides some humor.As Sandler grows to care  for his tot and the inevitable forces array themselves against him to take  the child away, the film veers off in the direction of sappiness and  maudlin tearjerking. One may be moved at times, but one also craves the  satirical sharpness and bite that a more courageous screenplay might have  provided.The movie does display an enlightened view of gays (though  Hollywood has yet to get past the point where gay characters can do more  than merely twinkle at each other), but it loses points for its rather  nasty tone towards old people. Still, any film designed to send Dr. Laura  into spasms of psychoanalytical outrage should be respected and  honored.Overall, &quot;Big Daddy&quot; is a movie that, if it had taken  more audacious pathways, might have been a firstrate comedy. As it is, it  provides numerous chuckles and a cuddly warm feeling - and that, given the  state of much of big screen comedy these days, is about all we dare allow  ourselves to expect.",3,generally likable comedy,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,2876,"['hard', 'not', 'like', 'quot', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'quot', 'diehard', 'fans', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'may', 'well', 'cringe', 'further', 'step', 'sentimentalization', 'comic', 'actor', 'film', 'raised', 'hackles', 'number', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'worrywarts', 'seeming', 'endorsement', 'permissive', 'parenting', 'film', 'reality', 'far', 'more', 'soft-hearted', 'hard-edged', 'Actually', 'be', 'probably', 'wisest', 'direction', 'Sandler', 'go', 'moment', 'because', 'actor', 'conveys', 'aura', 'genuine', 'likability', 'well', 'Average', 'Joe', 'persona', 'quot', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'quot', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'given', 'so', 'easily', 'sentimentality', 'predictable', 'emotional', 'uplift', 'Sandler', 'deadpan', 'portrayal', 'immature', 'adult', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'responsibility-laden', 'fatherhood', 'film', 'relatively', 'enjoyable.Sandler', '30-something', 'loser', 'living', 'South', 'Manhattan', 'who', 'been', 'milking', 'minor', 'foot', 'injury', 'tune', '200,000', 'court', 'settlement', 'life', 'consequently', 'consists', 'miniscule', 'employment', 'general', 'lack', 'direction', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'ready', 'move', 'older', 'man', 'quot', '5-year', 'plan', 'quot', 'When', 'little', 'boy', 'suddenly', 'up', 'doorstep', 'hitherto', 'unknown', 'son', 'friend', 'Sandler', 'temporarily', 'take', 'wing', 'hopes', 'winning', 'girlfriend', 'back', 'Thus', 'man', 'almost', 'resources', 'adult', 'maturity', 'attempts', 'instill', 'skewed', 'life', 'lessons', 'willing', 'highly', 'impressionable', 'young', 'mind', 'Sandler', 'teaching', 'boy', 'indulge', 'predictable', 'surprisingly', 'timid', 'antisocial', 'behavior', 'such', 'urinating', 'public', 'buildings', 'staying', 'up', 'late', 'tripping', 'unsuspecting', 'rollerbladers', 'etc', 'film', 'not', 'always', 'peak', 'creative', 'freshness', 'such', 'times', 'Sandler', 'lowkey', 'cynicism', 'humor.As', 'Sandler', 'care', 'tot', 'inevitable', 'forces', 'array', 'take', 'child', 'away', 'film', 'veers', 'off', 'direction', 'sappiness', 'maudlin', 'tearjerking', 'One', 'may', 'be', 'moved', 'times', 'one', 'also', 'satirical', 'sharpness', 'bite', 'more', 'courageous', 'screenplay', 'might', 'have', 'provided.The', 'movie', 'display', 'enlightened', 'view', 'gays', 'Hollywood', 'yet', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'gay', 'characters', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'merely', 'twinkle', 'other', 'points', 'rather', 'nasty', 'tone', 'towards', 'old', 'people', 'Still', 'film', 'designed', 'send', 'Dr.', 'Laura', 'spasms', 'psychoanalytical', 'outrage', 'should', 'be', 'respected', 'honored.Overall', 'quot', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'quot', 'movie', 'had', 'taken', 'more', 'audacious', 'pathways', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'firstrate', 'comedy', 'numerous', 'chuckles', 'cuddly', 'warm', 'feeling', 'given', 'state', 'much', 'big', 'screen', 'comedy', 'days', 'dare', 'allow', 'ourselves', 'expect']",N/A

Big Daddy has Sandler living the contemporary American dream by living off of somebody else. Somehow he got a girlfriend (she probably felt sorry for him). Tired of him being such a loser, she dumps him. Somehow he ends up taking care of a kid who doesn't talk in order to prove he is responsible to get his girlfriend back. The kid doesn't respond to anything until Sandler accidently gets run over by a car. The way the kid laughs at people's possible injuries, he would probably have an orgasm if someone died. After he realizes the kid's potential, and starting him out at a young age, Sandler gives him full-on loser training. He continues entertaining the kid featuring a stick placed strategically in a skater's path with him tumbling down and practically breaking his neck. I heard a rumor that suspected terrorists at Guantanimo are subliminally tortured with Adam Sandler movies and makes them beg for water boarding. Sandler eternally becomes known as the original jackass as he trips, falls, and no matter what he does or says, there is always people proving their low I.Q.'s by showing up in droves for his movies as they chew bubble gum and instant message all the way through. After ""Big Daddy"", the media exploded with real and fake versions of intentional, predictable, bodily harm resulting in a new sensation of people having to break bones, or bleed to make us laugh.

One day she gets fed up up with him and tells him to grow up and get a decent job. As his girl friend left he went over to see his room mate and as he entered his house everyone wasted the suprise on Sonny. Everyone was very disapointed because they wasted it on sonny when they wanted to say it to the other room mate who was leaving to china for a few weeks. As the room mate leaves Sonny gets a kid sent to him with a note saying that it was the room mates kid. Sonny called the room mate up and told him he had his kid right here. Sonny ended up looking after him and raising him to become like him which was very funny. Later on in the movie he visits his ex girl friend and tries to impress her with his kid, though things start to go wrong as Sonny finds out she's sleeping with a old man. HOW WILL SONNY WIN HER BACK!!!!!!!!! one of the funniest parts in the movie was when Sonny had a little talk yo by the kids teacher and the teacher had some very bad things to say about the kid which where very funny. Another funny bit was when the kid goes daddy can i have my night light, and so Sonny turns on a lit up sign saying live nudes with an arrow pointing to the right. I really loved this movie, it was very hillarious with more than 20 hillarious bits. It is one of the most hillarious films i had seen and the ending was very sweet and even through out the film it was sweet. Adam Sandler is a great actor and he had the most suitable part in the movie for him. Adam Sandler has done some great work and i hope he keeps up the great work. If you like this film i suggest you go see the new movie with him in, mr deeds and believe me you won't regret it, but i have to say mr deeds was not as funny as big daddy, but it is great and i hope more people in the world start to know more about Adam Sandler and understand why he is such a great funny sweet actor. If i had to have a favourite Adam sandler movie it would propbably be waterboy, which was a very sweet touching film. So yeah overall a great film worth watching, SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!!!!!

Yes,BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE are both hillarious and classic comedy films-but what is the best movie Adam Sandler has made? In my opinion,that honor goes to BIG DADDY-which not only has everything an Adam Sandler film usually has to it and is,but it also has everything any kind of comedy film needs. Read on for my review of this:This time,Adam Sandler is Sonny Koufax,a young male living in New York City who has never wanted reponsibility. Koufax works at a toll booth,and his dad,one of the most respected lawyers in Florida,has been,as Koufax puts it,hassling him his whole life to get a job. Koufax is a grown man,so he doesn't exactly have to do what his dad wants him to do now,correct? Correct-but there is a problem. The problem is that his girlfriend,Vanessa,is sick of Sonny being so lazy and is not sure whether or not she should stay with him.Oh no...what is Sonny going to do now?Sonny is not exactly sure what to do to make Vanessa want to stay with him...but then,something happens that Sonny thinks could help him get Vanessa to stay with him. One morning,a five-year old boy named Julian shows up at his Manhattan apartment after he has been dropped off by an older kid who is probably about fourteen or fifteen years old. After one of Sonny's closest friends,Kevin(Jon Stewart)claims that Julian is not his son,Sonny takes responsibility for Julian-and after he finds out that Vanessa has left him for an older man,funny,sad,and heartwarming events continue on for about an hour or so.BIG DADDY is one of the best ""parenting"" films ever made. Some parents say that they don't want their children watching this film because some of the things they(Adam Sandler and the two twins in this film who played Julian,Cole and Dylan Sprouse)do in this film are stupid--OK,so that may be true,but WHO CARES???!!! It's a film-and it's a hillarious film also. With this film,Adam Sandler brought out the goofy kid he played in BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE and helped make a film that already had a lot going for it really great,really sweet,and really funny.This film,without question,is a must see film-no matter how old you are.",5,A must see,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,2312,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'review', 'saying', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'favorite', 'comedian', 'have', 'Sandler', 'albums', 'have', 'seen', 'own', 'lot', 'movies', 'Yes', 'BILLY', 'MADISON', 'HAPPY', 'GILMORE', 'are', 'hillarious', 'classic', 'comedy', 'films-but', 'what', 'best', 'movie', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'made', 'opinion', 'honor', 'BIG', 'DADDY-which', 'not', 'only', 'everything', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'film', 'usually', 'also', 'everything', 'kind', 'comedy', 'film', 'needs', 'Read', 'review', 'time', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Sonny', 'Koufax', 'young', 'male', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'who', 'never', 'wanted', 'reponsibility', 'Koufax', 'toll', 'booth', 'dad', 'one', 'most', 'respected', 'lawyers', 'Florida', 'been', 'Koufax', 'hassling', 'whole', 'life', 'get', 'job', 'Koufax', 'grown', 'man', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'do', 'what', 'dad', 'do', 'now', 'correct', 'Correct-but', 'problem', 'problem', 'girlfriend', 'Vanessa', 'sick', 'Sonny', 'being', 'so', 'lazy', 'not', 'sure', 'not', 'should', 'stay', 'him.Oh', 'what', 'Sonny', 'going', 'do', 'now', 'Sonny', 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'make', 'Vanessa', 'want', 'stay', 'then', 'something', 'Sonny', 'thinks', 'could', 'help', 'get', 'Vanessa', 'stay', 'One', 'morning', 'five-year', 'old', 'boy', 'named', 'Julian', 'up', 'Manhattan', 'apartment', 'been', 'dropped', 'off', 'older', 'kid', 'who', 'probably', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'years', 'old', 'one', 'Sonny', 'closest', 'friends', 'Kevin', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'Julian', 'not', 'son', 'Sonny', 'responsibility', 'Julian-and', 'out', 'Vanessa', 'left', 'older', 'man', 'funny', 'sad', 'heartwarming', 'events', 'continue', 'hour', 'so.BIG', 'DADDY', 'one', 'best', 'parenting', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'parents', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'children', 'watching', 'film', 'things', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'two', 'twins', 'film', 'who', 'played', 'Julian', 'Cole', 'Dylan', 'Sprouse', 'do', 'film', 'are', 'stupid', 'OK', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'WHO', 'CARES', 'film-and', 'hillarious', 'film', 'also', 'film', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'brought', 'out', 'goofy', 'kid', 'played', 'BILLY', 'MADISON', 'HAPPY', 'GILMORE', 'helped', 'make', 'film', 'already', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'really', 'great', 'really', 'sweet', 'really', 'funny.This', 'film', 'question', 'must', 'see', 'film-no', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'are']",N/A

But after his fed up girlfriend leaves him, he comes up with the ingenious idea to adopt a five year old boy to showcase his newfound maturity.

510408,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00000K3UR,wellwellwell,"[5, 8]","I think that by this time in Adam Sandler's career, there are two kinds of fans: ones who either hate him, or love him.  And to be blunt, his roles in most of his movies are not that great.  For instance; playing the title character in ""Happy Gilmore"", he was a hockey/golf pro.  In ""The Waterboy"" he played a retarted waterboy.  And in ""Little Nicky"" he played the Devil's son.  Now, all of these roles are not ones that we can relate to.  But yet we still loved those films, and with good reason.But in ""Big Daddy"", Sandler plays Sonny Koufax.  What makes this role so much better is that there's a sense of love from within.  When a young boy (Cole/Dylan Sprouse) is left outside his door, he takes him in and gives him a home.  And for anyone who saw ""Billy Madison"" you see the irony here.  Anyway, to make a long story short, it's the most well-rounded character he's every played.  It's a movie that anyone can like, even if they don't like Adam Sandler.  Grant it, he has the starring role, but he's with a great supporting cast.  It includes Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart and Rob Schneider, along with some Sandler-movie regulars.  Joey is particularly good here.  She provides more seriousness than most of his female co-stars from earlier films.This movie is definetly a comedy--and it' a good one at that.  But it has more than just stupid laughs.  It's cute, it's sad, and it's something you shouldn't be able to hate.  The movie may be around 3.5 stars, it's better than just three.  The only reason it didn't get more is because of the ending.  I didn't think much of the ending, but I guess it was fitting.  Anyway, Adam Sandler does something in this movie that I hope continues for him; that being playing great roles.  So watch this movie, whether you like Adam Sandler or not.
