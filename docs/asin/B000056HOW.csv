569384,A8YDXMFXJ4R6X,B000056HOW,Amber,"[0, 0]","After getting pretty deep into the TV series, I searched out the rest of Kenshin's world. Fortunately, the manga is being released here. I have also seen the OVA, which explains Kenshin's past before the TV series and the manga. Then I got into the movie.This--is--awesome! Like the OVA, it moved me in a way that few (if any) anime ever have. Unlike the OVA, there are many funny parts in addition to the depressing parts. I love it when Yahiko is told to grow up to be an honorable man worthy of respect, and he thinks of his two role models, Kenshin and Sanosuke. The look on his face when he thinks of the older pair in some of their goofier aspects is great!The focus, however, is on the dramatic rather than the humorous. Kenshin is forced to relive a part of his life he would in all honesty rather forget, even erase. His past once again taints a relationship that otherwise would have gone smoothly, and in the end he and his new ally are forced to fight on opposite sides. Again. However, this time it ends, not with the reconciliation of the pair, but in tragedy.The fight scenes in this movie are of the same quality you've come to expect from this incredible series. The fight between Shigure and Kenshin is just jaw-dropping! I actually said &quot;Wow!&quot; the first time I saw it.Oh, and there is something I should mention. One fight is shown several times through several different angles. This fact may turn a lot of people off, but it IS important to the story. And that is (understandably) the only time he fights this particular man, so they have to keep showing the same small battle. It certainly didn't hurt me to see the same fight three or four times.Like the series, the English dub SUCKS! I hate it! *imagines taking the dub track from the people at the studio and stomping on it* The Japanese is SO much better! Kenshin as a character is supposed to have one of those voices that could be either male or female--that is part of the whole joke surrounding the character. He is supposed to be mistaken for a teenage boy at best, a young woman at worst. However, in the English dub, he is given a definite male voice. That alone is worth burning the tape with dub track on it. But combined with the questionable talents of the other English actors...Anyway, I prefer the Japanese version, not just for the (correct) voices but also for the correct pronounciation of the names. And for the excellent subbing. The subbers actually translate the names of Kenshin's attacks. This is both good and bad, as I love to hear him say the names, but on the other hand I get to (finally) learn what those attacks really are.In keeping with the somewhat darker tone of this movie, much of the action takes place at night or in dark buildings. What scenes are done in daylight are very well-done--these are often the more humorous scenes. Except for the battle scene: there wasn't supposed to be anything funny about that. However, when I showed it to two of my friends, they found that scene really funny for some reason. But they were also laughing during the climax of the battle between Shigure and Kenshin. Grr...I fully recommend this to any and all Kenshin fans, though if you don't know at least a little of the backstory than this probably won't make much sense.",5,This deserves more than a million stars!,1080086400,"03 24, 2004",2004,3285,"['getting', 'pretty', 'deep', 'TV', 'series', 'searched', 'out', 'rest', 'Kenshin', 'world', 'Fortunately', 'manga', 'being', 'released', 'here', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'OVA', 'Kenshin', 'past', 'TV', 'series', 'manga', 'Then', 'got', 'movie.This', 'awesome', 'OVA', 'moved', 'way', 'few', 'anime', 'ever', 'have', 'OVA', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'parts', 'addition', 'depressing', 'parts', 'love', 'when', 'Yahiko', 'told', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'honorable', 'man', 'worthy', 'respect', 'two', 'role', 'models', 'Kenshin', 'Sanosuke', 'look', 'face', 'when', 'older', 'pair', 'goofier', 'aspects', 'great', 'focus', 'however', 'dramatic', 'rather', 'humorous', 'Kenshin', 'forced', 'relive', 'part', 'life', 'would', 'honesty', 'rather', 'forget', 'even', 'erase', 'past', 'once', 'again', 'relationship', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'smoothly', 'end', 'new', 'ally', 'are', 'forced', 'fight', 'opposite', 'sides', 'Again', 'However', 'time', 'not', 'reconciliation', 'pair', 'tragedy.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'same', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'incredible', 'series', 'fight', 'Shigure', 'Kenshin', 'just', 'jaw-dropping', 'actually', 'said', 'quot', 'Wow', 'quot', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'it.Oh', 'something', 'should', 'mention', 'One', 'fight', 'shown', 'several', 'times', 'several', 'different', 'angles', 'fact', 'may', 'turn', 'lot', 'people', 'important', 'story', 'understandably', 'only', 'time', 'particular', 'man', 'have', 'keep', 'showing', 'same', 'small', 'battle', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'see', 'same', 'fight', 'three', 'four', 'series', 'English', 'dub', 'SUCKS', 'hate', '*imagines', 'taking', 'dub', 'track', 'people', 'studio', 'stomping', 'Japanese', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'Kenshin', 'character', 'supposed', 'have', 'one', 'voices', 'could', 'be', 'male', 'female', 'part', 'whole', 'joke', 'surrounding', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'mistaken', 'teenage', 'boy', 'best', 'young', 'woman', 'worst', 'However', 'English', 'dub', 'given', 'definite', 'male', 'voice', 'alone', 'worth', 'burning', 'tape', 'dub', 'track', 'combined', 'questionable', 'talents', 'other', 'English', 'actors', 'Anyway', 'prefer', 'Japanese', 'version', 'not', 'just', 'correct', 'voices', 'also', 'correct', 'pronounciation', 'names', 'excellent', 'subbing', 'subbers', 'actually', 'translate', 'names', 'Kenshin', 'attacks', 'good', 'bad', 'love', 'hear', 'say', 'names', 'other', 'hand', 'get', 'finally', 'learn', 'what', 'attacks', 'really', 'are.In', 'keeping', 'somewhat', 'tone', 'movie', 'much', 'action', 'place', 'night', 'dark', 'buildings', 'What', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'daylight', 'are', 'very', 'well-done', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'battle', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'anything', 'funny', 'However', 'when', 'showed', 'two', 'friends', 'found', 'scene', 'really', 'funny', 'reason', 'were', 'also', 'laughing', 'climax', 'battle', 'Shigure', 'Kenshin', 'Grr', 'fully', 'recommend', 'Kenshin', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'least', 'little', 'backstory', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense']",Samurai X - The Motion Picture

569387,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000056HOW,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","In my opinion, Rurouni Kenshin is in my top 3 anime series of all time. Filled with humor, action, lovable characters, great storylines(although the sumo wrestler from season 1 was odd). So hearing of this movie, having watched the pre tv-OVA's, decided to watch this. Despite certain things that nagged me, this is a very good film to watch.It starts with a flashback as a man named Gentatsu is killed by Kenshin, otherwise known as Hitokiri Battousai, a feared assassin and master swordsman. Back to present day, Kenshin and his 3 friends from the series(minus Megumi) are in a city. There they meet Takimi, an equally good swordsmen. Kenshin later finds out that Takimi is haunted by the death of his friend Gentatsu and wants to get rid of Japan's government. Kenshin finds himself in a predicament as not only does he have to stop Takimi from starting a war, he's got to stop Takimi and not kill him over the wishes of Toki, a woman who secretly loves him.Phew. It's easier to watch. Bit of storyline details. This takes place during the Kyoto Arc after Kenshin has met Saito, and after Sanosuke learns a new punch.  It was rather sad to not see Megumi but you do see Ayume and and Sazume so that's a plus. Animation's great(although the blood looks odd in some parts) and Kenshin oddly looks a bit different here.Now for some bad stuff.  The killing of Tentatsu is repeated many times throughout the film. While it is a reminder of the problems of Kenshin and Takimi, you don't have to have it 5 times, literally. Another thing is the dub. I watched the English dub and it's rather bad. One thing that made Rurouni Kenshin funny was Kenshin having a darker voice when he was about to fight and a more lighthearted voice during the slapstick moments, then of course there's &quot;oro&quot;. And Sanosuke has a bit of an australian accent which doesn't sound right. However, Kenshin's english voice is good despite him not saying &quot;oro&quot; once.If you're a big Kenshin, you might as well check it out, won't hurt. If you're not, I recommend the watching the series up until the first half of Season 1 and if you want to know about Saito, watch some of Season 2 but I recommend watching it.",5,Better than I thought it would be,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,2199,"['opinion', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'top', '3', 'anime', 'series', 'time', 'Filled', 'humor', 'action', 'lovable', 'characters', 'great', 'storylines', 'sumo', 'wrestler', 'season', '1', 'was', 'odd', 'hearing', 'movie', 'having', 'watched', 'pre', 'tv-OVA', 'decided', 'watch', 'certain', 'things', 'nagged', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'watch.It', 'starts', 'flashback', 'man', 'named', 'Gentatsu', 'killed', 'Kenshin', 'otherwise', 'known', 'Hitokiri', 'Battousai', 'feared', 'assassin', 'master', 'swordsman', 'Back', 'present', 'day', 'Kenshin', '3', 'friends', 'series', 'Megumi', 'are', 'city', 'meet', 'Takimi', 'equally', 'good', 'swordsmen', 'Kenshin', 'later', 'out', 'Takimi', 'haunted', 'death', 'friend', 'Gentatsu', 'get', 'rid', 'Japan', 'government', 'Kenshin', 'predicament', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'stop', 'Takimi', 'starting', 'war', 'got', 'stop', 'Takimi', 'not', 'kill', 'wishes', 'Toki', 'woman', 'who', 'secretly', 'him.Phew', 'easier', 'watch', 'Bit', 'storyline', 'details', 'place', 'Kyoto', 'Arc', 'Kenshin', 'met', 'Saito', 'Sanosuke', 'new', 'punch', 'was', 'rather', 'sad', 'not', 'see', 'Megumi', 'do', 'see', 'Ayume', 'Sazume', 'plus', 'Animation', 'great', 'blood', 'odd', 'parts', 'Kenshin', 'oddly', 'bit', 'different', 'here.Now', 'bad', 'stuff', 'killing', 'Tentatsu', 'repeated', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'reminder', 'problems', 'Kenshin', 'Takimi', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', '5', 'times', 'literally', 'thing', 'dub', 'watched', 'English', 'dub', 'rather', 'bad', 'One', 'thing', 'made', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'funny', 'was', 'Kenshin', 'having', 'darker', 'voice', 'when', 'was', 'about', 'fight', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'voice', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'then', 'course', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sanosuke', 'bit', 'australian', 'accent', ""n't"", 'sound', 'right', 'However', 'Kenshin', 'english', 'voice', 'good', 'not', 'saying', 'quot', 'quot', ""'re"", 'big', 'Kenshin', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'check', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', ""'re"", 'not', 'recommend', 'watching', 'series', 'up', 'first', 'half', 'Season', '1', 'want', 'know', 'Saito', 'watch', 'Season', '2', 'recommend', 'watching']",Samurai X - The Motion Picture

It shows an aspect of Kenshin's character we rarely get to see- the results of his prior days as the manslayer.  While in the t.v. series Kenshin suffers in a more generic, non-specific kind of way for his past sins, that is, he doesn't see the direct results of his actions, such as  the suffering of the families of those he killed, in this movie he is slapped in the face with it.  He learns of the suffering first hand, from the relatives of one he had previously slain in the name of justice.  This is much the same as the first movies, Trust and Betrayal.  The only thing I could complain about was the difference in the voices of the English dub of the series and the English dub of this movie.  While most of the changes weren't distracting, the voice of Sanosuke was absolutely horrendous to the point of distracting me.  Other than that, kudos to this film for being entertaining and giving a little further development into the Kenshin character.For those who are not Kenshin fans, this movie might be confusing.  It is chock full of history and characters that are prevalent throughout the series but are not exactly things you would hear or be able to relate to in every day life.  The movie is rather violent if you are not used to Kenshin, but no more so than any of the other animes out there that contain violence.  Again, I would suggest watching the series first, and then trying the movies out.Finally,Kenshin remains true to the ideal of the series, trying to resolve differences, atone for his sins and make up for the hurt he has caused in the past, to the point where he is willing to die to even the score.  Kenshin is a man who is gentle and full of compassion, but can also kick butt and protect those who need protecting.

569394,A1DAQOI9N8L4R3,B000056HOW,Jason Pratt,"[3, 4]","To date (12/2/02), this is the only theatrical film based upon the story and characters of the Rurouni Kenshin series. I will skip a summary of the plot, since this will have been covered adequately in other reviews.ADV, not AnimeWorks, produced this American release, and the dubbing team is the same actors who voiced the OVA miniseries (i.e., not the main series crew). This is one of the chief problems with the film (insofar as its American release is concerned); for while the dubbing crew did an outstanding job for the OVA, in my opinion, they had a hard time shifting to the occasionally light-hearted and comic tone required for the theatrical film. (They do much better when the tone shifts to drama.)The dubbing writers chose the odd tactic of representing the antagonist (he isn't really a villain) as being someone who can mimic and improve upon other people's fighting styles--in this case, Kenshin's Hiten Mitsurugi. It's a novel notion, and almost works; but it doesn't really match what is happening on the screen, and certainly doesn't match the original dialogue (so far as I know--the subtitles say he's using his own style, and that fits the series psych-philosophy of dueling much better.)The storyline takes place during the continuity of the main series. Exactly when, is a matter of debate. Internal evidence (as well as production characteristics) indicate that it should be placed after the main series Kyoto arc, but before the concluding feng shui arc of season 3 (when most of the government buildings in Tokyo are wiped out). There are some secondary thematic similarities to the 3rd season Shimabara arc; but the film has a more dramatically satisfying conclusion, in my opinion. (At least the fight scenes are better--so far as they go; they aren't better than the majority of fights during the Kyoto arc...)Artistic values are fairly high 3rd-season level, although not yet at the level of the final main series ep nor the OVA. I found no music in the movie (or on its soundtrack, which I've bought) from the 1st or 2nd seasons; it's all from the 3rd season. (Or it may be that the 3rd season borrows music liberally from this movie, the 2nd season, and a little from the 1st season... The 'new' music first appears in the aforementioned Shimabara arc.)Although the ep isn't strictly canonical (it isn't borrowed from the manga, so far as I know, and other eps don't reference it), I still recommend it as part of a series watch-through.Personally, I prefer to watch it just prior to the beginning of the Kyoto Arc (essentially the whole of the 2nd season).There is nothing too far out of line for shifting the order this early, except for Sano's one use of the futonokiwami move: but in English this is ignored (I don't remember if he says the name of the move in Japanese); and all throughout the 3rd season he is unable to punch with that hand (having broken every bone trying to use the punch on Mikoto Shishio). Besides, as is common for 'strong man' characters in most fictional stories, the RuroKen writers tend to ramp Sano's strength up and down however necessary for the situation at hand: he's splitting huge trees in half with one punch in season 2, partly for comedy-value, _before_ he learns the futo', for instance! Punching a blockade out of the way is in the same vein, I think.Hajime Saito's involvement with the story may seem problematic; but I argue that it can still fit a pre-2nd season 'ep'. We know from season 2 that Kenshin knows Saito is alive; that Saito has been keeping an eye on Kenshin; and that Kenshin wasn't expecting Saito to come after him in _this_ fashion (maybe come after him some day, but not like _this_). This is commensurate with Kenshin meeting Saito briefly in this film. Nothing in season 2 indicates that Kenshin is surprised to learn Saito is a police officer. Saito meets virtually no one in the film who has any bearing to the Kyoto Arc. Saito's involvement in the film is admittedly abrupt, in terms of a 'plot introduction'; but if the film is screened right before Kyoto starts, then the hanging question &quot;Who _was_ that guy!?&quot; is satisfactorily answered right from the beginning.Thus, my recommendation of view order: Season 1 (skipping the False Prophet DVD 4, as to taste), temporarily skip the train robbery ep (DVD 5), then do the short arc introducing Sano's friend (DVD 6), then do the train robbery ep, which the theatrical feature could be seen as beginning with. (The 'modern day' majority of the movie begins with Sano and Kaoru doing their steam/ghost argument while riding the train to Yokohama. Title credit song is highly annoying, btw. |g|) Then after the theatrical, go straight to Kyoto Arc and play out from there. (The coastal pirate arc of Season 1 can be skipped, or put in earlier, as to taste.)",4,Actually makes a good transition between Seasons 1 and 2.,1038787200,"12 2, 2002",2002,4819,"['date', '12/2/02',

ADV films has made this confusing by giving the dubbed versions of the OVA and the movie the same title.

But for some reason the movie didn't live up to the TV series potential.Why?  Well, in my opinion it was to much related to the OVA, plot twist wise, and there was to many politics.  Which brings me to another point.  If you watch the movie in spurts it doesn't seem to be that bad.  I watched it in one sitting the first time, felt in different, watched the movie a 2nd time in 2 or 3 sittings and actually liked it better.  Why?  I think it was because I wasn't having a political over load.Over all if you're a huge Kenshin fan it's worth a peek, but I don't suggest buying it on DVD, maybe VHS(subbed o' 'course ^^x).

Bernabo,"[4, 5]","At the start of &quot;Samurai X: The Motion Picture&quot; (&quot;Rurni Kenshin: Ishin shishi e no Requiem&quot;) we are clearly in the same bloody world of &quot;Samurai X: Betrayal&quot; and &quot;Samurai X: Trust.&quot;  But then the titles come along and we are back to the world of &quot;Rurni Kenshin&quot; the series, with Kaoru Kamiya, Sanosuke Sagara, and Yahiko Myjin on the train to Yokohama.  Apparently the violent prologue was only a reminder of Kenshin's life as the &quot;Hitokiri Battousai&quot; (&quot;the man who slashes even as he draws his sword&quot;).Within the context of the character's history the point of this story is to contrive a situation in which Kenshin Himura might break his vow and actually kill somebody with his reverse blade sword.  As is often the case in the series although the war against the Tokugawa Shogunate ended years earlier with the Meiji Restoration there are those who are not happy with the new world order in Japan.  Shigare Takimi is haunted by the death of his friend Takatsuki Gentatsu and now leads a band of desparate rebels who intended to kill a foreign ambassador.  But when Kenshin helps to protect Takatsuki Toki from the brutality of foreign sailors, the two men become friends.  Shigure asks Kenshime to take care of Toki if anything should ever happen to him.  Of course it is a small world even in Japan Toki is the sister of Gentatsu, who was killed by Kenshin (in the prologue).Still, there are plans within plans in Meiji Japan as someone else is trying to use Shigure to his own ends and in the end it seems inevitable that Shigure and Kenshin will cross swords.  This is another example of a  &quot;Rurni Kenshin&quot; story in which the stranger with a past whose path has crossed our hero before ends up being the most interesting character.  It also remind those of us who enjoyed the anime series that things had ended there with Kaoru and Kenshin finally getting together and now we have apparently reset to an earlier time (the trip to Yokohama) and we can only ask, what is up with that?  Still, you have to admit that this is &quot;movie&quot; version is representative of the series, where a long string of former foes cross Kenshin's path once again.I accidentally started watching the movie with the English dub and the English subtitles and kept it going just because there were so few times when they came close to matching.

569405,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B000056HOW,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[26, 28]","The timing of this film is after the 'Samurai X' OVA's.  The year is 1879, sometime during the progress of the 'Rurouni Kenshin' television series.  The bloody overthrow of the Tokugawa Shogunate has been followed by the Meiji restoration, but all is not well.  Samurai led by Takimi Shigure regret the passing of the old days and plan to start a counter-revolution.  Himura Kenshin, one of the samurai who fought to overthrow the Shogunate, finds himself forced by destiny to oppose Shigure.  In the past, a mistake by Shigure left his closest friend, Takatsuki Gentatsu without sufficient resources for a raid.  Unknown to Shigure, Kenshin is the samurai who killed Gentatsu.  Both men were deeply affected by this, at the restoration of the Meiji, Shigure was sworn to vengeance.  And Kenshin had his sword blade reversed, determined never to kill with his sword again.Now, in Yokohama, Shigure plots the death of the British Governor.  When Kenshin helps protect Takatsuki Toki (Gentatsu's sister) Shigure befriends Kenshin and eventually asks him to take care of Toki if something should happen to him.  In the meantime, forces in the government intend to use Shigure as a means for achieving their own ends, creating a multi-layered scenario of betrayals that will culminate in the final battle between the two honorable opponents.Despite (or perhaps because of) the highly romanticized depiction of samurai behavior and swordmanship, this becomes a dramatically engaging story instead of a simple tale of blood and swashbuckling.  Kenshin's youthful appearance and the antics of his friends keep the film from being overwhelmingly tragic.  Thus it is a well-balanced plot with many subtexts to add to its richness.Artistically, the film is first-class.  The battle scenes are cleanly detailed, and the choreography of the sword fights is beautifully done, if a bit fantastical.  The scenes have a fluid grace that will cause the viewer to stop action often, just to admire the illustration.  This film, and the related tales of Rurouni Kenshin set a new standard for Samurai based anime, that is rarely equaled.  Watching the OVA series before seeing the movie version will provide the viewer with useful background information, but the film stands quite well on its own, making it a fitting introduction to this popular and long-running series.",4,"""In the sadness, I was holding my dream tightly.""",1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,2352,"['timing', 'film', ""'Samurai"", 'X', 'OVA', 'year', '1879', 'sometime', 'progress', ""'Rurouni"", 'Kenshin', 'television', 'series', 'bloody', 'overthrow', 'Tokugawa', 'Shogunate', 'been', 'followed', 'Meiji', 'restoration', 'not', 'well', 'Samurai', 'led', 'Takimi', 'Shigure', 'passing', 'old', 'days', 'plan', 'start', 'counter-revolution', 'Himura', 'Kenshin', 'one', 'samurai', 'who', 'fought', 'overthrow', 'Shogunate', 'forced', 'destiny', 'oppose', 'Shigure', 'past', 'mistake', 'Shigure', 'left', 'closest', 'friend', 'Takatsuki', 'Gentatsu', 'sufficient', 'resources', 'raid', 'Shigure', 'Kenshin', 'samurai', 'who', 'killed', 'Gentatsu', 'men', 'were', 'deeply', 'affected', 'restoration', 'Meiji', 'Shigure', 'was', 'sworn', 'vengeance', 'Kenshin', 'had', 'sword', 'blade', 'reversed', 'determined', 'never', 'kill', 'sword', 'again.Now', 'Yokohama', 'Shigure', 'death', 'British', 'Governor', 'When', 'Kenshin', 'protect', 'Takatsuki', 'Toki', 'Gentatsu', 'sister', 'Shigure', 'Kenshin', 'eventually', 'take', 'care', 'Toki', 'something', 'should', 'happen', 'meantime', 'forces', 'government', 'intend', 'use', 'Shigure', 'means', 'achieving', 'own', 'ends', 'creating', 'multi-layered', 'scenario', 'betrayals', 'will', 'culminate', 'final', 'battle', 'two', 'honorable', 'opponents.Despite', 'perhaps', 'highly', 'romanticized', 'depiction', 'samurai', 'behavior', 'swordmanship', 'dramatically', 'engaging', 'story', 'instead', 'simple', 'tale', 'blood', 'swashbuckling', 'Kenshin', 'youthful', 'appearance', 'antics', 'friends', 'keep', 'film', 'being', 'overwhelmingly', 'tragic', 'Thus', 'well-balanced', 'plot', 'many', 'subtexts', 'add', 'richness.Artistically', 'film', 'first-class', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'cleanly', 'detailed', 'choreography', 'sword', 'fights', 'beautifully', 'done', 'bit', 'fantastical', 'scenes', 'have', 'fluid', 'grace', 'will', 'cause', 'viewer', 'stop', 'action', 'often', 'just', 'admire', 'illustration', 'film', 'related', 'tales', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'set', 'new', 'standard', 'Samurai', 'based', 'anime', 'rarely', 'equaled', 'Watching', 'OVA', 'series', 'seeing', 'movie', 'version', 'will', 'provide', 'viewer', 'useful', 'background', 'information', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'own', 'making', 'fitting', 'introduction', 'popular', 'long-running', 'series']",Samurai X - The Motion Picture

I am reviewing this film independent from the series.From a basic standpoint, ""Samurai X"" gave me what I wanted to see:-a compelling, unique, and initially mysterious main character-some excellent fight scenes-better than usual art work-adequate English dubs and music-a story that did not get in the way of the actionThe initial fight scene, which takes place years before the rest of the story, really gripped me and made me want to continue on with the film.  Gripping tension and excellent fighting action.After that there was a lot of story setup where I was lost for the most part.  This is probably because I never saw the series.  Basically there was a civil war but some are angry with the new regime and wish to overthrow it.  There is much intrigue that unfolds throughout the rest of the story as characters chose a side and then in some cases betrayed that side in the struggle.In some cases I thought the double-crosses became too many, but the plot advanced just fine and brought about enough fight scenes.One thing I will admit to admiring about this movie was how it moved me emotionally at some points.  I felt tension when young Yahiko got trapped by the rebels.  I felt a bit of sorrow in the end for Takimi and Toki.  I could understand Takimi's rage at Kenshin.  This was one of the strong points of the movie, and the music did a decent job of adding to the emotion.All in all, maybe not one of the greatest movies of all time, but certainly entertaining and superior within its own genre.

The sotry line is great because everytime kenshin says that he is repenting for the people that he killed, you can never put a face to it. In this movie we are able to take a glimpse into the pain that his assasin days cause in the maji era. We now have an idea of what kenshin put people through. And for that i beleive that all kenshin fans should get it. But if you havent seen the seriese you can watch it too, and it will still be a great story, but then i suggest you should get the other samurai x movies trust and betrayal, then there are rourouni kenshin boxed sets you can buy if you are curious about his days as a wonderer. If you dont want to buy the seriese you can buy relfection, which has short flashbacks on the seriese and concludes the kenshin saga.Here you have it.

569414,AS5WZV6SBZAAK,B000056HOW,The Blue Raja,"[3, 3]","I've read many reviews on this film at Amazon, and it seems that OVA lovers hate it, and the Kenshin TV lovers accept it.  I happen to appreciate BOTH series.  I like the OVAs (Betrayal/Trust) for the more cinematic/artsy style and non-googly face scenes of the TV series, plus the harsh, dramatic story (though quite bloody at times)and the dark style treatment for dark times.  The TV series (episodes 1-95) I appreciate because the violence is not as extreme and the stories are filled with drama, morals, and humor.Now for Samurai X, the motion picture.  This, I believe, is a perfect blend of the OVA series and the TV series.  The artwork is more consistent with the TV series, as you see Kenshin's friends like Yahiko &amp; Sanosuke, and Kenshin has the vibrant red hair &amp; purple outfit.  It seems suitable to me because he is trying now to rid of his dark past (which had a darker look to it).  The only thing that made it difficult for me to get into this picture at first was the English dub; though I like BOTH the English and Japanese voices on the TV series, this movie, I thought, was TERRIBLE in the English voice department.  So I switched to the original Japanese track and was very happy to find the voices from the Japanese TV version.The story of the film is great, the characters are dynamic and the action is excellent.  I read someone complain that they reused the open of the film 7 times throughout the picture... I was relieved to discover that each time they repeated they were not in their entirety, only mere images so it was fine and worked with the story... how could I FORGET about the OPEN?!  The open to this film is what made me purchase it right away.  Though the rest of the film doesn't have much of the feel or look as the open does (kind of like an OVA open, slightly watered down - but VERY well executed) it WAS a flashback of a different era.  I cannot rave enough about the opening sequence, but I'll stop to spare you.I think each Kenshin series has something good for anime lovers.  The goofy faces / head bumps of the TV series is the only thing that has ever bothered me, but I get used to it.  Fortunately, Samurai X, the Motion Picture doesn't have that element.  Anyone think Toki &amp; Kaoru look VERY similar?  Anyway, this was an excellent movie - give it a chance! (Watch it in Japanese w/ subs!!)",4,In between the TV series and the OVA...
