While the editing is not as polished as other seasons, there's a lot to be said for the freshness of the show and the people on it. More people who wanted the adventure and fewer people trying to break into acting or modeling. Also, no one in Season 1 knew how the game was played. Everything was new.Also, much of this season is ""amazing."" You get to see some of the sites you've always wanted to see like Victoria Falls. In the more recent seasons, you have to avoid big cities because of spoilers being posted.The extra footage that is worked in is fun - it gives you a sense of what is really recorded and how it is edited. The airport confrontation between the Guidos and Drew and Kevin is shown unedited. The commentary on four episodes is also wonderful - I wish there were more.If you are new to the Amazing Race, I'm sure this season will strike you as quirky.

It follows 11 teams of 2 people raceing around the world to win a million dollars. Each episode is one leg of the race...so like each episodes is like a new race.The last person to finish each leg is usualy eliminated completely. They complete in different challenges to recieve clues that tell them were they need to go next in the world. The first season isnt the best out of all 7 but one of the best. I would highly Reccomend this to anyone. Exept that if you watch it the first time you will know will be eliminated the second time you watch it. Only one minor problem.

169679,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,1415711534,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","In a world where the reality TV show has become king, The Amazing Race holds its own very well. We have two successful dancing contests, two successful talent shows, some on and off again dating shows, and two exotic travel shows.I have personally always liked Survivor and The Amazing Race best of this group. And of the two, I favor The Amazing Race, although I know I may be in the minority there compared to the number of pure Survivor fans. There are two reasons I like The Amazing Race better. First, the contestants largely determine their own fate. While a bad taxi driver or a breakdown in a rental car may occasionally knock someone out, the focus of the Race is on the teams adapting quickly to both challenges and travel. Secondly, Survivor is all in one place. The Amazing Race moves around the world, giving you a look at numerous interesting places and lifestyles during the course of each series.Of course, Season One started it all off. While the Race creators have added more nuance to the Race and its strategies over the course of ten years, it is interesting to see what it was like at the beginning, when the contestants had to feel their way along without the experience of having watched earlier incarnations of the series.Each episode has a starting point and a destination, with challenges to be completed along the way. Sometimes just finding their way to travel to the next challenge can be difficult for some of the contestants. On most shows, the last team to arrive at the destination is eliminated. And the eliminations can be touching. Often the team that arrives last may have worked the hardest, or even performed well but missed a turn in their travel. You'll delight with capable and personable teams who breeze to the finish line. You'll suffer with sympathetic teams that struggle to understand a puzzle. You'll experience some frustration with annoying teams who just don't seem to ever go away. LOLBut most of all, if you like reality contests with a lot of variety, you'll enjoy the heck out of this show.",5,Reality show that has withstood the test of time,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,2047,"['world', 'where', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'become', 'king', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'own', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'two', 'successful', 'dancing', 'contests', 'two', 'successful', 'talent', 'shows', 'off', 'again', 'dating', 'shows', 'two', 'exotic', 'travel', 'shows.I', 'have', 'personally', 'always', 'liked', 'Survivor', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'best', 'group', 'two', 'favor', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'know', 'may', 'be', 'minority', 'there', 'compared', 'number', 'pure', 'Survivor', 'fans', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'like', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'better', 'First', 'contestants', 'largely', 'determine', 'own', 'fate', 'bad', 'taxi', 'driver', 'breakdown', 'rental', 'car', 'may', 'occasionally', 'knock', 'someone', 'out', 'focus', 'Race', 'teams', 'adapting', 'quickly', 'challenges', 'travel', 'Secondly', 'Survivor', 'one', 'place', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'world', 'giving', 'look', 'numerous', 'interesting', 'places', 'lifestyles', 'course', 'series.Of', 'course', 'Season', 'One', 'started', 'off', 'Race', 'creators', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'nuance', 'Race', 'strategies', 'course', 'ten', 'years', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'beginning', 'when', 'contestants', 'had', 'feel', 'way', 'experience', 'having', 'watched', 'earlier', 'incarnations', 'series.Each', 'episode', 'starting', 'point', 'destination', 'challenges', 'be', 'completed', 'way', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'finding', 'way', 'travel', 'next', 'challenge', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'contestants', 'most', 'shows', 'last', 'team', 'arrive', 'destination', 'eliminated', 'eliminations', 'can', 'be', 'touching', 'Often', 'team', 'last', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'hardest', 'even', 'performed', 'well', 'missed', 'turn', 'travel', ""'ll"", 'delight', 'capable', 'personable', 'teams', 'who', 'breeze', 'finish', 'line', ""'ll"", 'suffer', 'sympathetic', 'teams', 'struggle', 'understand', 'puzzle', ""'ll"", 'experience', 'frustration', 'annoying', 'teams', 'who', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'ever', 'go', 'away', 'LOLBut', 'most', 'like', 'reality', 'contests', 'lot', 'variety', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'heck', 'show']",N/A

169682,AZB4CQ9JZSUQB,1415711534,Eric Pregosin,"[1, 1]","Ok I admit I am a gameshow nut, as well a nut for the other DVDs you read my reviews on, and I don't like reality tv except for the shows that are in game show format.  However, there is ""reality tv"" and then there is ""The Amazing Race"".  I never saw any of the early shows on CBS, but since GSN picked up the reruns, I am having a ball, albeit I have to set timers on my vcr to pick some up cause I turn in at 9 my time (when it airs on GSN or CBS) on worknights.  But when I saw this disc set of the ""first race"" (not really the ""first season"", to me a ""season"" of a tv seriies is fall of this year to spring of next year) this week, I just had to ""avoid elimination"", and get it.  I am glad I did, as I (and you when you buy it) will get footage that neither CBS or GSN has aired) and the extras definitely intrigue me.  The show is definitely one which tests your brain and your braun, which is rare for a tv series of yesteryear or nowadays.  The ""Man from New Zealand"" (not to mention the early days of the FX Network): Phil Koeghan is a delite to listen to (I would put him on at least 1 of the buddy lists of my messengers in a heartbeat).  As someone who is building a DVD library of various genres and movies of my lifetime and before, I can tell you right now, this is THE ONE series of its genre that I am glad to own.  I've been watching #7 on GSN lately, so am very eager to see what the disc copies look like this winter, but I hope CBS puts the in between ones out after the holidays.  Suffice it to say, when CBS and GSN dumps it once and for all, this is one series I will enjoy looking at again as much as many of my other films/shows.  Keep em coming CBS, you have a personal Emmy winner in my book even if it doesn't ""officially"" win any more real Emmys.",5,Amazing Amazing Amazing,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,1775,"['Ok', 'admit', 'am', 'gameshow', 'nut', 'as', 'well', 'nut', 'other', 'DVDs', 'read', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'reality', 'tv', 'shows', 'are', 'game', 'show', 'format', 'However', 'reality', 'tv', 'then', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'never', 'saw', 'early', 'shows', 'CBS', 'GSN', 'picked', 'up', 'reruns', 'am', 'having', 'ball', 'have', 'set', 'timers', 'vcr', 'pick', 'cause', 'turn', '9', 'time', 'when', 'GSN', 'CBS', 'worknights', 'when', 'saw', 'disc', 'set', 'first', 'race', 'not', 'really', 'first', 'season', 'season', 'tv', 'seriies', 'fall', 'year', 'spring', 'next', 'year', 'week', 'just', 'had', 'avoid', 'elimination', 'get', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'when', 'buy', 'will', 'get', 'footage', 'CBS', 'GSN', 'aired', 'extras', 'definitely', 'intrigue', 'show', 'definitely', 'one', 'brain', 'braun', 'rare', 'tv', 'series', 'yesteryear', 'nowadays', 'Man', 'New', 'Zealand', 'not', 'mention', 'early', 'days', 'FX', 'Network', 'Phil', 'Koeghan', 'delite', 'listen', 'would', 'put', 'least', '1', 'buddy', 'lists', 'messengers', 'heartbeat', 'someone', 'who', 'building', 'DVD', 'library', 'various', 'genres', 'movies', 'lifetime', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'ONE', 'series', 'genre', 'am', 'glad', 'own', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', '7', 'GSN', 'lately', 'am', 'very', 'eager', 'see', 'what', 'disc', 'copies', 'look', 'winter', 'hope', 'CBS', 'ones', 'out', 'holidays', 'Suffice', 'say', 'when', 'CBS', 'GSN', 'once', 'one', 'series', 'will', 'enjoy', 'looking', 'again', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'other', 'films/shows', 'Keep', 'em', 'coming', 'CBS', 'have', 'personal', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'book', 'even', ""n't"", 'officially', 'win', 'more', 'real', 'Emmys']",N/A
169683,A27YUZ4HZHPWUU,1415711534,GamerGirl,"[4, 8]","As someone who got hooked on the Amazing Race during season 2, I didn't wait too long to run out and buy the first season so I could go back and see how it all started. It is definitely a trip to see how different the game was when it started, from the rules to things as simple as the color of the route markers. It was definitely interesting to see how people played the game before they had seen people play it before them, so they had no strategies or anything to work off of.Even back in the first season, they still had all the requisite teams. Older married couple, older ""life partnered"" couple (who I noticed chimed in with their own review already - kind of unethical in my opinion, but after watching them play the game I'm not too surprised by that), parent/child team, separated couple, best friends, and several young couple teams. There were definitely some good moments, and it was fun watching teams who had never left the U.S. before keep up with the world travellers who snubbed their noses at them.My biggest gripe about this season is the lack of special features. There is a roadblock that was not seen in the original season when it aired (although the task was recycled to be used in a later season), commentaries on a few episodes that I will probably never listen to, approximately 90 minutes of extra footage, and a couple other special features. I think my biggest disappointment is with the extra footage. The producers decided to go the way of putting an icon on the screen when extra footage is available and you have to click the enter button to see it. For the amount of money I paid, I would have appreciated it if they would have blended the extra stuff in with the rest of the show. Obviously, there must have been literally weeks worth of extra film taken during the course of the season, and I'm supposed to be grateful for 90 minutes, some of which is already in the episode, and not even get that mixed in with the show?Anyway, I'd definitely recommend at least renting this season if you're a big fan of the show but missed the first season. If you caught it the first time around, there's really not much here to make the purchase worth it, unless you're such a huge fan that you just have to have it.",5,It's Good to Go Back,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,2243,"['someone', 'who', 'got', 'hooked', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'season', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'wait', 'too', 'long', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'how', 'started', 'definitely', 'trip', 'see', 'how', 'different', 'game', 'was', 'when', 'started', 'rules', 'things', 'as', 'simple', 'color', 'route', 'markers', 'was', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'played', 'game', 'had', 'seen', 'people', 'play', 'had', 'strategies', 'anything', 'work', 'off', 'of.Even', 'back', 'first', 'season', 'still', 'had', 'requisite', 'teams', 'Older', 'married', 'couple', 'older', 'life', 'partnered', 'couple', 'who', 'noticed', 'chimed', 'own', 'review', 'already', 'kind', 'unethical', 'opinion', 'watching', 'play', 'game', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'surprised', 'parent/child', 'team', 'separated', 'couple', 'best', 'friends', 'several', 'young', 'couple', 'teams', 'were', 'definitely', 'good', 'moments', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'teams', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'left', 'U.S.', 'keep', 'world', 'travellers', 'who', 'snubbed', 'noses', 'them.My', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'season', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'roadblock', 'was', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'season', 'when', 'aired', 'task', 'was', 'recycled', 'be', 'used', 'later', 'season', 'commentaries', 'few', 'episodes', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'listen', 'approximately', '90', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'couple', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'think', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'extra', 'footage', 'producers', 'decided', 'go', 'way', 'putting', 'icon', 'screen', 'when', 'extra', 'footage', 'available', 'have', 'click', 'enter', 'button', 'see', 'amount', 'money', 'paid', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'would', 'have', 'blended', 'extra', 'stuff', 'rest', 'show', 'Obviously', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'literally', 'weeks', 'extra', 'film', 'taken', 'course', 'season', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'be', 'grateful', '90', 'minutes', 'already', 'episode', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'mixed', 'show', 'Anyway', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'least', 'renting', 'season', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'missed', 'first', 'season', 'caught', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'make', 'purchase', 'worth', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan', 'just', 'have', 'have']",N/A

This DVD gave me the chance to go back and look at where the Amazing Race began and how far the show has come in the last few years.The premise behind the Amazing Race is simple. Race around the world and the first team to cross the finish line wins one million dollars. Of course, with prize money like that, it won't be easy navigating your way around the world, but if you succeed, you get the cash.The race began (and ended) in New York City. Teams traveled through South Africa, China, India, Thailand, France and numerous other places before returning to the United States for the completion of the race. Along the way, eight teams of two were eliminated, leaving only three teams of two in the final leg.When the 11 teams of two left the starting line, they had no idea where they were going, or what they were doing. They got clues that led them to exotic destinations, places many of them had never been. It was fun to watch these Americans try to get along in another country without speaking the language.There were some great challenges in the first version of the Amazing Race. Contestants had to jump off a cliff in Africa, navigate a crowded market in India, hike a steep portion of the Great Wall of China, drive a team of dogs in Alaska, soar in a glider above Italy and more. As the years have gone on, the challenges have remained difficult, but I believe that some of the ones in the first season were among the toughest.Along the way, teams were met with Road Blocks, which were tasks that usually only one member of the team could complete, and Detours, which gave teams the chance to make a choice on which way they wanted to proceed. Often times choices made at Detours could make up valuable time or put a team behind their competitors. Teams also had the chance to use a Fast Forward. The first team to complete each Fast Forward, could skip all tasks on that leg of the race and go directly to the pit stop, which was located at the end of the leg. However, each team could only use one Fast Forward during the race and choosing when to use it was key.At the end of each leg, contestants would get a 12-hour break at the pit stop, where they could talk with other contestants and just relax and prepare for the next leg. The last team to check in at each leg was eliminated, with the exception of three legs that were non-elimination legs. In future editions, teams were penalized for coming in last at a non-elimination leg, but in the inaugural season, there were no such penalties.As the seasons have gone on, producers have tweaked the show to make it better. Some of the things in the first season that were changed included the introduction. Host Phil Keoghan would talk about what previously happened on the show and at the end, say 'who will be eliminated tonight.' However, if you listen to that intro, you can tell when nobody's going to be eliminated because he doesn't use those words but others. Now, on the intro, he says 'who will be eliminated next,' which is much better. Also, Phil would only greet the last team, which always was a tip-off to the last place finishers that they were indeed, last. Now, Phil greets every team and that makes it more dramatic for the teams.The teams in the first season were also much like the teams in every season I've watched. You have the requisite gay couple (Joe and Bill aka Team Guido), the spunky grandparents (Dave and Margaretta), the parent-child team (Nancy and the very cute Emily), the macho guy teams (Drew and Kevin, Rob and Brennan), the underdog two women teams (Pat and Brenda, Kim and Leslie) and a few young couples using the race as a gauge of their relationship (Paul and Amie, Matt and Ana, Lenny and Karen, Frank and Margarita). This formula  has been used on most of the editions I have watched, though, I am not arguing with it. It seems to work. Team Guido was the team everybody loved to hate, thanks to their cockiness and sneakiness. It was tough to watch Frank and Margarita racing to the finish line, thinking they were first, when in reality, that was not the case. My favorite two teams were frat brothers Drew and Kevin and Nancy and Emily. Drew and Kevin were just a riot. They made me laugh at every turn, yelling at each other, but always managing to stay in the race until almost the end. Nancy and Emily made it farther than anyone expected them to, which is always nice to see. They fought through some difficult times, particularly in India, but came through stronger as a team. Plus, Emily was pretty darned cute.As far as extras go, this set has a lot, but the way they are set up is different. You can watch the episodes with a choice to go look at unaired footage, but you can't see the footage any other place. It would have been nice to package that another way, but it is still nice that it is included. There are four episodes of commentary, two from Rob and Brennan and Team Guido and two from Lenny and Karen and Drew and Kevin. There is also a look back at the first season with the aforementioned teams, Keoghan and the executive producers. There is a look inside the making of the first season and how difficult the logistics were. It is interesting to hear the producers talk about how they were often on the same plane as the contestants and barely steps ahead of them for much of the way.All told, this is a solid release of the very first season. It would be nice to see more seasons released. Season seven has also been released, but I would love to see seasons two through six as well.",4,The race begins,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,5650,"['only', 'began', 'watching', 'Amazing', 'Race',

Plus, some of the places theyvisit are pretty fascinating, though the pace of the game means we don';t get more than a cursory glance at the localcultures.The one big fly in the ointment for me was that often those who  worked hard to build an advantage often had it strippedaway through no fault of  their own (e.g. the leading contestants were often scheduled to go back out in the middle of thenight when the access to the next stop often wasn't open until the next morning, meaning that their lead would be erodedas they sat waiting).

The premise is simple, teams of two who already know each other will race around the world for a million dollars finding clues and completing tasks along the way.  Most legs, the team to arrive last will be eliminated from the race.And it works.  The editing in this show, while at times does drive me crazy, works wonders for the final segment.  I find my heart racing waiting to see who comes in first and who gets eliminated.  And yes, I've been known to yell at the TV when the outcome isn't what I wanted.As with all these shows, there are heroes and villains along the way.  Team Guido took the title of team we most loved to hate in this season with their cutthroat playing.  There were lots of teams to root for here, including mother/daughter Nancy and Emily and frat brothers Kevin and Drew.I've grown to have a healthy respect for those who take this show on.  While I think it would be fabulous to do and love watching the countries and events unfold, I can see how this competition would strain relationships.  If the pressure gets to me sitting at home, how much worse must it be when you actually have a stake in it?

169700,A5YY84IO6W2Q5,1415711534,Sheryl McCallister,"[1, 7]","The first Amazing Race has always been by far the best installment.There were fascinating places to go, real people racing (not the everlasting ""recruited"" model-actors, nutjob entertainment industry people, and prior reality show contestants we've been subjected to since then), and best of all REAL clues and tasks!!!  Clues that people had to figure out and SOLVE before they could get go anyplace!  Tasks that required people do real WORK before they could get their next clue! A real, true race, that just that one time actually let tough, focused racing put the top competitors out in front for good and all, instead of interminably penalizing them with Hours of Operation and Airport Bunching.So, knowing all this, does the team behind this boxed set take full advantage of the fact that this race is in fact LEGENDARY among fans of the show?  There weren't many of us who actually watched this the first time around and fell in love with a game that allowed a guy to scream at his partner ""Swing you fat bast***, swing!""  Most fans had only heard or read about this race until just this past fall.No, in fact, they do NOT take good advantage.  Not at all, IMHO.For example, there's just no excuse for NOT having a commentary track on EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.  At the very least, there should have been commentary for every elimination leg, by the team that got eliminated!  I'd have liked to know just how it was that Anna and Matt got so completely turned around, and why Emily and Mom just gave in?! And every episode could have benefitted from the sage and snarky comments of the beloved Frats (Kevin and Drew to the uninitiated among you) and Team Guido, with their luck of the evil.  And where are Frank and Margarita?  Seriously; one train from winning the race, and there's not a word from them.  What gives?Not to mention that they could have partnered with some of the people who are MOST responsible for the ultimate success of the show for some additional materials.  There are all kinds of fan sites with racer interviews, with recaps (Television Without Pity's Miss Alli's come to mind), with timelines and other race trivia; they could have gone to the people who've made this show a success and said, ""Hey, we'd like to include some of your material on the bonus DVD.  Can we pay you a little money?""Yes, I bought it.  Yes, I've watched it.  I love this race, and I'm an eternal fan of all these people who took a chance on an entirely untried concept, and who all raced with passion, grit and (for the most part) more than a little class--unlike an embarrassingly high percentage of subsequent racers.But I'm excessively disappointed that the team behind the Race 1 DVD left so many extras that they COULD (and SHOULD!) have included off the disks, and that so much of what could have been added in terms of commentary and insight from the racers themselves was left unattempted.RACERS:  6 stars.RACE: 6 stars.DVD TEAM: 1 star.AVERAGE:  4 1/4 stars.",4,Why does the best race ALWAYS get this sucky treatment?,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,2970,"['first', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'always', 'been', 'far', 'best', 'installment.There', 'were', 'fascinating', 'places', 'go', 'real', 'people', 'racing', 'not', 'everlasting', 'recruited', 'model-actors', 'nutjob', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'people', 'prior', 'reality', 'show', ""'ve"", 'been', 'subjected', 'then', 'best', 'REAL', 'clues', 'tasks', 'Clues', 'people', 'had', 'figure', 'out', 'SOLVE', 'could', 'get', 'go', 'anyplace', 'Tasks', 'required', 'people', 'do', 'real', 'WORK', 'could', 'get', 'next', 'clue', 'real', 'true', 'race', 'just', 'one', 'time', 'actually', 'let', 'tough', 'focused', 'racing', 'put', 'top', 'competitors', 'out', 'front', 'good', 'instead', 'interminably', 'penalizing', 'Hours', 'Operation', 'Airport', 'Bunching.So', 'knowing', 'team', 'boxed', 'set', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'fact', 'race', 'fact', 'LEGENDARY', 'fans', 'show', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'who', 'actually', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'fell', 'love', 'game', 'allowed', 'guy', 'scream', 'partner', 'Swing', 'fat', 'bast***', 'swing', 'Most', 'fans', 'had', 'only', 'heard', 'read', 'race', 'just', 'past', 'fall.No', 'fact', 'do', 'NOT', 'take', 'good', 'advantage', 'Not', 'IMHO.For', 'example', 'just', 'excuse', 'NOT', 'having', 'commentary', 'track', 'EVERY', 'SINGLE', 'EPISODE', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'commentary', 'elimination', 'leg', 'team', 'got', 'eliminated', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'was', 'Anna', 'Matt', 'got', 'so', 'completely', 'turned', 'around', 'why', 'Emily', 'Mom', 'just', 'gave', 'episode', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'sage', 'snarky', 'comments', 'beloved', 'Frats', 'Kevin', 'Drew', 'uninitiated', 'Team', 'Guido', 'luck', 'evil', 'where', 'are', 'Frank', 'Margarita', 'Seriously', 'one', 'train', 'winning', 'race', 'not', 'word', 'What', 'Not', 'mention', 'could', 'have', 'partnered', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'MOST', 'responsible', 'ultimate', 'success', 'show', 'additional', 'materials', 'are', 'kinds', 'fan', 'sites', 'racer', 'interviews', 'recaps', 'Television', 'Pity', 'Miss', 'Alli', 'come', 'mind', 'timelines', 'other', 'race', 'trivia', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'made', 'show', 'success', 'said', 'Hey', ""'d"", 'like', 'include', 'material', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Can', 'pay', 'little', 'money', 'Yes', 'bought', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'love', 'race', ""'m"", 'eternal', 'fan', 'people', 'who', 'took', 'chance', 'entirely', 'untried', 'concept', 'who', 'raced', 'passion', 'grit', 'most', 'part', 'more', 'little', 'class', 'embarrassingly', 'high', 'percentage', 'subsequent', 'racers.But', ""'m"", 'excessively', 'disappointed', 'team', 'Race', '1', 'DVD', 'left', 'so', 'many', 'extras', 'COULD', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'included', 'off', 'disks', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'terms', 'commentary', 'insight', 'racers', 'was', 'left', 'unattempted.RACERS', '6', 'stars.RACE', '6', 'stars.DVD', 'TEAM', '1', 'star.AVERAGE', '4', '1/4', 'stars']",N/A

You pretty much know the outcome.  My opinion has changed since watching Season 1 of the Amazing Race on DVD.  One of my good friends kept talking about the show so much I finally started watching Amazing Race when season 5 started.  I've been hooked ever since.  I was very excited to see Season 1 of the show was being released on DVD and enjoyed it so much I'm going to buy my own season set.  Amazing Race always has something going on.  You don't have too many moments where the contestants are not doing anything.  Survivor is fun to watch during the run of the show, but after a while the camp segments can get a little dull.  I like the constant action of the task the Amazing Race contestants and trying to figure out who will make it to the pit stop in what order.Amazing Race has teams of two people (husband wife, boyfriend girlfriend, engaged couples, etc, etc) who are given instructions and clues on where to go, to get their next clue, and have to finish a task to get yet, their next clue.  A Detour is a choice between two tasks.  One task might be easier, but you might have to drive further to get to it.  Picking the right task can mean the difference between coming in first, or last and possibly being eliminated.  For a Fast Forward you do a task that can help you find the fast forward to go straight to the pit stop bypassing the detour task.  Teams are only allowed to do a fast forward once during the game, so teams must choose wisely.  The thing about this show is you are competing with people you know, or think you know well.  This show can bring out the worst or the best of couples.  Fighting can create such turmoil you can lose the motivation to want to go further with your partner.  I'm sure a couple broke up when it was all said and done.Even though it's easy to find out who won the race, you still find yourself reacting to what the contestants are doing like it's a brand new show.  I was often talking to my TV!!!  Some of the exotic locations traveled to were South Africa, Paris, Rome, India, and Thailand.The best part had to be the last episode.  You think you know who will win, and when you see the actual team that does win, let's just say it will make you rewind the DVD to see where things went wrong.  This is simply an awesome show and I hope season 2-4 are released on DVD so I can catch up.

169704,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,1415711534,Thayer,"[28, 30]","I am happy that the show finally found an audience that made the producers of the show decided to release the first season on DVD. I think of all the reality series, this one will hold its own best in ""repeated viewings"" and on syndication. Unlike other reality series, even if you already know who wins or who gets eliminated in a particular episode, it doesn't ruin the quality of the episode. But of course there's still nothing compared to seeing these episodes for the first time.It is a revolutionary reality series that has a concept that was probably very hard to pull off on paper (can you imagine the reactions of the TV executives when they first heard about the concept of the show). But amazingly, they did pull it off! It is very evident that the producers treat each episode as ""special episode"" because can you just imagine the logistics and the number of people (across the globe) involve in producing this show?There are some aspects of the show that were later on in the succeeding seasons were changed mostly for improvements. Example of this is that in the first season, Phil only received the teams who came in the last place (a person from that particular country receives those who came in before the last team). Part of the fun is watching the reactions of the racers anticipate whether they were eliminated or not. Because in the first season the racers already know if they came in last, we were not able to see those kinds of reactions.Some of the most memorable teams were Team Guido (you won't believe the extent they were willing to do to get ahead), Lenny and Karyn (the original fighting couple, but their fight looked real and not some deliberate attempt to gain screen time. When Karyn said ""Disappointing"", you believe her!), Nancy and Emily (even though Emily acted like a brat, Nancy just radiates with motherly innocence in the race), and Kevin and Drew (the original funny guys)When the winner finally cross the finish line at the finale, with all the eliminated teams cheering for them, you just can't help but feel like being a part of the race.Grade: A",5,Best Reality Show on TV,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,2095,"['am', 'happy', 'show', 'finally', 'found', 'audience', 'made', 'producers', 'show', 'decided', 'release', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'think', 'reality', 'series', 'one', 'will', 'hold', 'own', 'best', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'syndication', 'other', 'reality', 'series', 'even', 'already', 'know', 'who', 'who', 'eliminated', 'particular', 'episode', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'quality', 'episode', 'course', 'still', 'nothing', 'compared', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'first', 'time.It', 'revolutionary', 'reality', 'series', 'concept', 'was', 'probably', 'very', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'paper', 'can', 'imagine', 'reactions', 'TV', 'executives', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'concept', 'show', 'amazingly', 'did', 'pull', 'off', 'very', 'evident', 'producers', 'treat', 'episode', 'special', 'episode', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'logistics', 'number', 'people', 'globe', 'involve', 'producing', 'show', 'are', 'aspects', 'show', 'were', 'later', 'succeeding', 'seasons', 'were', 'changed', 'mostly', 'improvements', 'Example', 'first', 'season', 'Phil', 'only', 'received', 'teams', 'who', 'came', 'last', 'place', 'person', 'particular', 'country', 'receives', 'who', 'came', 'last', 'team', 'Part', 'fun', 'watching', 'reactions', 'racers', 'anticipate', 'were', 'eliminated', 'not', 'first', 'season', 'racers', 'already', 'know', 'came', 'last', 'were', 'not', 'able', 'see', 'kinds', 'reactions.Some', 'most', 'memorable', 'teams', 'were', 'Team', 'Guido', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'extent', 'were', 'willing', 'do', 'get', 'ahead', 'Lenny', 'Karyn', 'original', 'fighting', 'couple', 'fight', 'looked', 'real', 'not', 'deliberate', 'attempt', 'gain', 'screen', 'time', 'When', 'Karyn', 'said', 'Disappointing', 'believe', 'Nancy', 'Emily', 'even', 'Emily', 'acted', 'brat', 'Nancy', 'just', 'motherly', 'innocence', 'race', 'Kevin', 'Drew', 'original', 'funny', 'guys', 'When', 'winner', 'finally', 'finish', 'line', 'finale', 'eliminated', 'teams', 'cheering', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'being', 'part', 'race.Grade']",N/A

The filming and editing really showed off the exotic scenery. There were many likeable teams, and the team interactions for the most part were like real people. The kind you wouldn't mind having a beer with.Another thing I liked about the early seasons is how there was more emphasis on problem solving and mental challenges. The clues were clues, they didn't just flat out tell you where you had to go next. And yes, they did have some weird food eating segments, but unlike FF, it was real, cooked local quisine, not humiliating gross out stuff. Strange, unpleasent maybe, but real.And as I touched on earlier, the camera work and editing were top notched. The camera pans and cuts seem to flow with the action better. Some of the locations were truly spectacular: Victoria Falls is standout. In comparison to a recent competing show, the AR folks win hands down with the photography. I got sea sick watching a competing show from all the unnecessary zooms in and out.Summation: Best season of the series, but looking forward to season 2!

Reality TV had just started to take off the previous summer with the smash hit of SURVIVOR.  SURVIVOR: AUSTRALIA was airing (and getting even bigger ratings) during the time that THE AMAZING RACE started filming.  BIG BROTHER had aired, but the reality craze that was to sweep the nation (and the networks) wasn't quite yet in full swing.  Fall 2001 brought the bumper crop of reality television shows and THE AMAZING RACE proved to be the best of the whole new batch and next to SURVIVOR was and still remains as one of the two best reality shows on tv.The concept of THE AMAZING RACE is huge.  Eleven teams of two racing around the world in the hopes of finishing the race first and winning a million-dollar prize.  Along the way they are forced to complete all kinds of different obstacles during each leg of the trip.  Teams that finish last (except for on three pre-determined legs) on each leg are eliminated from the race.  The race provides all sorts of opportunities for comedy and drama to unfold.  Often when it does it is in the most unexpected of places.Season One of THE AMAZING RACE presents such favorite teams as the mother and daughter duo of Nancy & Emily, the best friends and frat brothers Kevin & Drew, separated parents Frank & Margarita, and the dastardly duo (and first villains of THE AMAZING RACE) Team Guido: Bill & Joe.  The episodes travel from South Africa, France, Tunisia, Italy, India, Thailand, and China.Included with this DVD set are a series of deleted scenes that can be viewed through the ""all access pass"" feature, 4 audio commentaries (two with Kevin, Drew, Lenny, and Karyn  and two with Bill, Joe, Rob, and Brennan), the first roadblock that never aired on television involving the eating of an ostrich egg, a featurette entitled ""Reliving the Race"" that includes interviews with some of the contestants, and a featurette entitled ""Creating and Coordinating"" that explains how the show was brought about from its conception until the first season of shooting.THE AMAZING RACE: THE FIRST SEASON is a great DVD set for any fan of the show to own.  Those who enjoy reality television or traveling will probably enjoy the set as well.",5,Race to the Finish.,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,2298,"['When', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'first', 'aired', 'fall', '2001', 'was', 'anything', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'seen', 'television', 'Reality', 'TV', 'had', 'just', 'started', 'take', 'off', 'previous', 'summer', 'smash', 'hit', 'SURVIVOR', 'SURVIVOR', 'AUSTRALIA', 'was', 'airing', 'getting', 'even', 'bigger', 'ratings', 'time', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'RACE', 'started', 'filming', 'BIG', 'BROTHER', 'had', 'aired', 'reality', 'craze', 'was', 'sweep', 'nation', 'networks', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'yet', 'full', 'swing', 'Fall', '2001', 'brought', 'bumper', 'crop', 'reality', 'television', 'shows', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'RACE', 'proved', 'be', 'best', 'whole', 'new', 'batch', 'next', 'SURVIVOR', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'two', 'best', 'reality', 'shows', 'tv.The', 'concept', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'RACE', 'huge', 'Eleven', 'teams', 'two', 'racing', 'world', 'hopes', 'finishing', 'race', 'first', 'winning', 'million-dollar', 'prize', 'way', 'are', 'forced', 'complete', 'kinds', 'different', 'obstacles', 'leg', 'trip', 'Teams', 'finish', 'last', 'three', 'pre-determined', 'legs', 'leg', 'are', 'eliminated', 'race', 'race', 'sorts', 'opportunities', 'comedy', 'drama', 'unfold', 'when', 'most', 'unexpected', 'places.Season', 'One', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'RACE', 'presents', 'such', 'favorite', 'teams', 'mother', 'daughter', 'duo', 'Nancy', 'Emily', 'best', 'friends', 'frat', 'brothers', 'Kevin', 'Drew', 'separated', 'parents', 'Frank', 'Margarita', 'dastardly', 'duo', 'first', 'villains', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'RACE', 'Team', 'Guido', 'Bill', 'Joe', 'episodes', 'travel', 'South', 'Africa', 'France', 'Tunisia', 'Italy', 'India', 'Thailand', 'China.Included', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'series', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'access', 'pass', 'feature', '4', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'two', 'Kevin', 'Drew', 'Lenny', 'Karyn', 'two', 'Bill', 'Joe', 'Rob', 'Brennan', 'first', 'roadblock', 'never', 'aired', 'television', 'involving', 'eating', 'ostrich', 'egg', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Reliving', 'Race', 'interviews', 'contestants', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Creating', 'Coordinating', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'brought', 'about', 'conception', 'first', 'season', 'shooting.THE', 'AMAZING', 'RACE', 'FIRST', 'SEASON', 'great', 'DVD', 'set', 'fan', 'show', 'own', 'who', 'enjoy', 'reality', 'television', 'traveling', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'set', 'as', 'well']",N/A
