1125643,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0010KHOSU,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Out In The 1950s Film Noir Night- Jeanne Crain's Dangerous CrossingYou really should be wary of whirlwind romances, quick romances that end in marriage, and maybe danger. No I am not an old spoilsport, a naysaying in matters of the heart, but unless you know somebody for a while, get a feel for what they are about, get that ""under your skin"" feeling then back off, back off a little. You just never know when some guy or gal might be a gold-digger just looking to get fat and sassy at your expense.Take the lovely Ruth (played by Jeanne Crain) in the 1950s film noir mystery under review, Dangerous Crossing, she was feeling blue after the sudden death of her rich father and grabbed onto the nearest Johnnie around, took the whirlwind, and then the marriage plunge. If she had taken my advice, or had this John Bowman (played by Carl Betz) guy who swept her off her feet checked out she could have saved herself a lot of angst and anguish. But no she took the plunge, clueless, and then went on a honeymoon cruise that took the starch out of everything.Now your average ship cruise, until lately anyway, is pretty uneventful, just food, booze and shuffleboard. But from about minute one this turned out to be the cruise from hell and Ruth's life was upended. The loving couple (knowing each other for all of four weeks), Ruth and John, boarded the ship and then John took a powder, went missing. Ruth, a little unstable due to the father's death, was frantic. She looked everywhere, asked everybody about his whereabouts, making a general nuisance of herself in the process. Nobody seemed to believe her story denying that this John was on board.  She was ultimately medical help by one Doctor Manning (played by Michael Rennie) but was looked at by one and all as a looney.But here is the funny thing this John was on board, had a confederate on board (okay, his real honey, but that's still a confederate isn't it), and had created an elaborate hoax to do away with Ruth and grab her dough. Now you know in these film noir things, particularly 1950s noir, that the main point driven home is that crime does not pay so you know that, elaborate hoax or not, this Johnnie is doomed. Watch the film is find out how. Oh yah, and be careful, very careful the next time you have a whirlwind romance. Enough said.",3,Watch Out For Whirlwind Romances,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,2310,"['1950s', 'Film', 'Noir', 'Night-', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Dangerous', 'CrossingYou', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'wary', 'whirlwind', 'romances', 'quick', 'romances', 'end', 'marriage', 'maybe', 'danger', 'No', 'am', 'not', 'old', 'spoilsport', 'naysaying', 'matters', 'heart', 'know', 'somebody', 'while', 'get', 'feel', 'what', 'are', 'get', 'skin', 'feeling', 'then', 'back', 'back', 'little', 'just', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'guy', 'gal', 'might', 'be', 'gold-digger', 'just', 'looking', 'get', 'fat', 'sassy', 'expense.Take', 'lovely', 'Ruth', 'played', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', '1950s', 'film', 'noir', 'mystery', 'review', 'Dangerous', 'Crossing', 'was', 'feeling', 'blue', 'sudden', 'death', 'rich', 'father', 'grabbed', 'nearest', 'Johnnie', 'around', 'took', 'whirlwind', 'then', 'marriage', 'plunge', 'had', 'taken', 'advice', 'had', 'John', 'Bowman', 'played', 'Carl', 'Betz', 'guy', 'who', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'checked', 'out', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'lot', 'angst', 'anguish', 'took', 'plunge', 'clueless', 'then', 'went', 'honeymoon', 'cruise', 'took', 'starch', 'everything.Now', 'average', 'ship', 'cruise', 'lately', 'anyway', 'pretty', 'uneventful', 'just', 'food', 'booze', 'shuffleboard', 'minute', 'one', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'cruise', 'hell', 'Ruth', 'life', 'was', 'upended', 'loving', 'couple', 'knowing', 'other', 'four', 'weeks', 'Ruth', 'John', 'boarded', 'ship', 'then', 'John', 'took', 'powder', 'went', 'missing', 'Ruth', 'little', 'unstable', 'due', 'father', 'death', 'was', 'frantic', 'looked', 'everywhere', 'asked', 'everybody', 'whereabouts', 'making', 'general', 'nuisance', 'herself', 'process', 'Nobody', 'seemed', 'believe', 'story', 'denying', 'John', 'was', 'board', 'was', 'ultimately', 'medical', 'help', 'one', 'Doctor', 'Manning', 'played', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'was', 'looked', 'one', 'looney.But', 'here', 'funny', 'thing', 'John', 'was', 'board', 'had', 'confederate', 'board', 'okay', 'real', 'honey', 'still', 'confederate', ""n't"", 'had', 'created', 'elaborate', 'hoax', 'do', 'away', 'Ruth', 'grab', 'dough', 'Now', 'know', 'film', 'noir', 'things', 'particularly', '1950s', 'noir', 'main', 'point', 'driven', 'home', 'crime', 'not', 'pay', 'so', 'know', 'elaborate', 'hoax', 'not', 'Johnnie', 'doomed', 'Watch', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Oh', 'yah', 'be', 'careful', 'very', 'careful', 'next', 'time', 'have', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'Enough', 'said']",Dangerous Crossing

1125646,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0010KHOSU,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","Gene Tierney might have been the reigning female star of noir at Fox, but Jeanne Crain certainly gives Tierney a run for her money in the sublime ""locked room"" mystery DANGEROUS CROSSING, one of her last major movies before leaving the studio in 1953.In DANGEROUS CROSSING, Jeanne Crain plays Ruth, the lovely if ever-so-slightly unstable wife of John Bowman (Carl Betz).  Their honeymoon cruise hits a snag when the groom promptly ""disappears"" just as the boat launches.  Frantic Ruth appeals for help from passengers and crew members alike but the story is always the same: they don't recall seeing Ruth with anyone, let alone a husband.  Concerned Dr. Manning (Michael Rennie) takes the shattered woman under his wing; and he's determined to discover the real cause of Ruth's ""delirium"".  But no-one, much less Ruth, will be able to understand the true motives behind the vanished husband.Economically filmed in only nineteen days using the pre-existing ship sets built for the 1953 Fox production of ""Titanic"", DANGEROUS CROSSING is a testament to the professionalism of Jeanne Crain--who was battling a 'flu during the shoot--that she was able to flesh out such a believable character in a short amount of time, delivering one of her finest performances in the process.  Ruth in DANGEROUS CROSSING is right up there with ""Pinky"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"" and ""A Letter to Three Wives"".The ""locked room"" mystery movie is a great example of a successful noir sub-genre; other movies with the same theme include Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes"", 1932's ""Midnight Warning"", and the underrated masterpiece ""So Long at the Fair"" starring Jean Simmons and Dirk Bogarde (still sadly-unavailable on DVD--hello, Criterion!).  DANGEROUS CROSSING was based on a popular radio play by John Dickson Carr entitled ""Cabin B-13"".The DVD includes a wonderful new Making Of featurette (""Peril at Sea: Charting a Dangerous Crossing""), audio commentary with Aubrey Solomon, isolated musical score track, interactive galleries and the trailer; plus sneak peeks at similar titles in the Fox Film Noir collection.Highly recommended.",4,Jeanne Crain dazzles in suspenseful mystery at sea,1257292800,"11 4, 2009",2009,2109,"['Gene', 'Tierney', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'reigning', 'female', 'star', 'noir', 'Fox', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'certainly', 'Tierney', 'run', 'money', 'sublime', 'locked', 'room', 'mystery', 'DANGEROUS', 'CROSSING', 'one', 'last', 'major', 'movies', 'leaving', 'studio', '1953.In', 'DANGEROUS', 'CROSSING', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Ruth', 'lovely', 'ever-so-slightly', 'unstable', 'wife', 'John', 'Bowman', 'Carl', 'Betz', 'honeymoon', 'cruise', 'snag', 'when', 'groom', 'promptly', 'disappears', 'just', 'boat', 'Frantic', 'Ruth', 'appeals', 'help', 'passengers', 'crew', 'members', 'alike', 'story', 'always', 'same', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'Ruth', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'husband', 'Concerned', 'Dr.', 'Manning', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'shattered', 'woman', 'wing', 'determined', 'discover', 'real', 'cause', 'Ruth', 'delirium', 'no-one', 'much', 'less', 'Ruth', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'true', 'motives', 'vanished', 'husband.Economically', 'filmed', 'only', 'nineteen', 'days', 'using', 'pre-existing', 'ship', 'sets', 'built', '1953', 'Fox', 'production', 'Titanic', 'DANGEROUS', 'CROSSING', 'testament', 'professionalism', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'who', 'was', 'battling', ""'flu"", 'shoot', 'was', 'able', 'flesh', 'out', 'believable', 'character', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'delivering', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'process', 'Ruth', 'DANGEROUS', 'CROSSING', 'right', 'there', 'Pinky', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'Letter', 'Three', 'Wives', '.The', 'locked', 'room', 'mystery', 'movie', 'great', 'example', 'successful', 'noir', 'sub-genre', 'other', 'movies', 'same', 'theme', 'include', 'Hitchcock', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', '1932', 'Midnight', 'Warning', 'underrated', 'masterpiece', 'So', 'Long', 'Fair', 'starring', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'still', 'sadly-unavailable', 'DVD', 'hello', 'Criterion', 'DANGEROUS', 'CROSSING', 'was', 'based', 'popular', 'radio', 'play', 'John', 'Dickson', 'Carr', 'entitled', 'Cabin', 'B-13', '.The', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'new', 'Making', 'featurette', 'Peril', 'Sea', 'Charting', 'Dangerous', 'Crossing', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Aubrey', 'Solomon', 'isolated', 'musical', 'score', 'track', 'interactive', 'galleries', 'trailer', 'sneak', 'peeks', 'similar', 'titles', 'Fox', 'Film', 'Noir', 'collection.Highly', 'recommended']",Dangerous Crossing

When the young, wealthy and nervous Ruth Stanton (Jeanne Crain) hears this from her impetuously-wedded new husband just after boarding a transatlantic steamer for their honeymoon, be prepared for the disappearing spouse gambit (or disappearing brother or best friend). The disappearance may take place on a train, in a Paris hotel or on a cruise ship, but we know that the young woman will soon think she must be mad...yet, in this case, she knows she had a husband. Why does everyone she meets, from fellow passengers to the stewards and third officers, deny ever having seen the man. It looks like sedation and confinement is in the works for Ruth, but then kindly Paul Manning (Michael Rennie), the ship's doctor, thinks that...just maybe...Ruth Stanton might be telling the truth.And off we go on a voyage filled with nighttime fog, dark passage ways, muffled struggles, disbelief and, as we early on surmise, an unscrupulous plot designed to bring a young woman to madness.Dangerous Crossing benefits from the old warhorse of a plot, from the creepy look of the film and, if you like transatlantic ships, the pleasurable goings on of those who dress for dinner in the grand salon. Michael Rennie is tall, calm and reassuring. Jeanne Crain, however, is from Hollywood's Loretta Young School of Acting, which includes Gene Tierney, Donna Reed, Ann Blythe and, sometimes, Anne Baxter. That is, the actresses must always be well groomed, immaculately made up, dressed casually to the nines and, in general, be able to mix restrained hysteria with well-bred graciousness.We know what's going on early in the movie, but still, getting to the last words is an easy way to spend 75 minutes.""Everything he said and did was like a terrible nightmare. Only worse because it was real,"" Ruth says to Paul.""Ruth, listen to me. You've got to put it out of your mind, the whole thing. It was a nightmare, but your eyes are open now.  It's over, Ruth, all over. You've got tomorrow to think of...and lots of tomorrows after that...""""I know you're right, Paul.""The movie looks just fine.

1125654,AZC562U18BK2S,B0010KHOSU,J. R. Trtek,"[0, 0]","Based on a stage play by mystery writer John Dickson Carr, Dangerous Crossing is a short suspense film with excellent casting and acting, outstanding direction and photography, and a couple or so plot holes so large that even Titanic could have sailed through without scraping her hull. A newlywed couple board an ocean liner and the husband goes off to run an errand, never to be seen again. The wife is presented with evidence and testimony that she is actually unmarried and booked a solo passage. But the husband contacts her secretly with a warning they are both in danger, and the ship's doctor is skeptical of her story but still feels there is something strange in the works. The taut and economical screenplay -- ignoring plot holes -- is skillfully written and expertly performed by a cast of fine actors who include Jean Crain and Michael Rennie as the wife and doctor, Max Showalter as a ship's officer, Willis Bouchey as the Captain, and several others who don't get credited. Oh, and Carl Betz as the husband, and in this case definitely not the husband from the Donna Reed Show. When it's all said and done, it's a bit amazing that so much could be crammed into just an hour and a quarter. So what about those plot holes? They mainly involve the need to keep a conspiracy secret and a ruse convincing, and success depends too much on coincidence and contrivance. Still, at the end those problems faded away for me, obscured by the otherwise solid movie-making this film represents.",3,Well Done but with a Flawed Story Line,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,1496,"['Based', 'stage', 'play', 'mystery', 'writer', 'John', 'Dickson', 'Carr', 'Dangerous', 'Crossing', 'short', 'suspense', 'film', 'excellent', 'casting', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'direction', 'photography', 'couple', 'so', 'plot', 'holes', 'so', 'large', 'even', 'Titanic', 'could', 'have', 'sailed', 'scraping', 'hull', 'newlywed', 'couple', 'board', 'ocean', 'liner', 'husband', 'run', 'errand', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'wife', 'presented', 'evidence', 'testimony', 'actually', 'unmarried', 'booked', 'solo', 'passage', 'husband', 'secretly', 'warning', 'are', 'danger', 'ship', 'doctor', 'skeptical', 'story', 'still', 'feels', 'something', 'strange', 'works', 'taut', 'economical', 'screenplay', 'ignoring', 'plot', 'holes', 'skillfully', 'written', 'expertly', 'performed', 'cast', 'fine', 'actors', 'who', 'include', 'Jean', 'Crain', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'wife', 'doctor', 'Max', 'Showalter', 'ship', 'officer', 'Willis', 'Bouchey', 'Captain', 'several', 'others', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'credited', 'Oh', 'Carl', 'Betz', 'husband', 'case', 'definitely', 'not', 'husband', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Show', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'bit', 'amazing', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'crammed', 'just', 'hour', 'quarter', 'So', 'what', 'plot', 'holes', 'mainly', 'involve', 'need', 'keep', 'conspiracy', 'secret', 'ruse', 'convincing', 'success', 'too', 'much', 'coincidence', 'contrivance', 'Still', 'end', 'problems', 'faded', 'away', 'obscured', 'otherwise', 'solid', 'movie-making', 'film']",Dangerous Crossing

Quickly enveloped by a paranoia of everyone, I was mislead to believe my advice shouted to the beautiful heroine, Ruth Stanton Bowman (Jeanne Crain), was correct. Needless to say the plot of a husband that carries his bride across a stateroom threshold and into emotional terror was absorbing - drawing the viewer onboard the vessel as an unworthy confidant. With Hitchockian style, the seemingly predictable nature of the film was just the opposite, even though significant clues were clearly presented from the very beginning.Jeanne Crain is an accomplished actress, having starred inPINKY(1949),A LETTER TO THREE WIVES(1949), andLEAVE HER TO HEAVEN(1945). Her talent comes to life when considering that filming of this thriller was completed in just 19 days (as noted on the excellent DVD extra ""Peril at Sea: Charting a Dangerous Crossing""). Bon voyage for surprised boarders of DANGEROUS CROSSING - a precursor to the similarly themed movieFLIGHTPLAN. Bravo!Movie quote: ""I do think you're confused Mrs. Bowman. This is your cabin.

After they board the ship and go to B 16 (their cabin) John tells Ruth he has to leave but to meet him downstairs. Then John disappears without a trace...literally! Ruth can't find him! Not only that there is no record of a John Bowman on the ship. In fact there is no record of Ruth being married! Frantic Ruth goes to her cabin B16. It's locked! What is going on here? She asks the steward to open the room and the man exclaims &#34; This cabin hasn't been opened until....now&#34;. A man shows her the passenger list but Ruth or John Bowman are not on the list! Ruth's name is under Ruth Staton her maiden name. She has been put in B 18! She soon faints and the ship's doctor Dr. Paul Manning (Michael Rennie) tries to help Ruth. Then Ruth gets a phone call from her husband so he must be on the ship she thinks. He says that they are both in danger and not to trust anyone. As the tention mounts Ruth is starting to lose her mind. The stewardess says she saw Ruth but noone was with her! Ruth becomes histerical and suspicious of everybody. Where is her husband? Why hasn't anyone seen him or even have him on the passenger list? Who switched her luggage from B16 to B18? Why did the stewardess say she saw her with noone? Also the stewardess says she didn' see her being carried over the threshold to B 16. Dr. Manning tries to help poor Ruth but perhaps he is in on the plot to drive her insane. After a breakdown Ruth is confined to her cabin! She is supposed to meet John at 2:00 but she is sedated. Will Ruth find the truth? Will she be able to convince the captain and Dr. Manning that she was married. And where is her Dear Husband?!!! Who is after him? This thriller is short...running about 76 minutes but it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

1125658,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0010KHOSU,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","Dangerous Crossing is one of the best thriller/mysteries I've seen to date. It was actually filmed in a mere nineteen days although you'd never guess it! Jeanne Crain was highly intelligent and put everyone to the task of keeping up with her; and the result was wonderful. Yes, the ship's foghorn sounds too much during the early half of this film; but it's all atmospheric and despite just a little bit of camp there's really no fat to be found here! The cinematography is excellent and the choreography for action scenes is extremely well done. The film was shot in black and white to highlight the darkness of this mystery thriller.When the action starts, we meet newlyweds John and Ruth Stanton Bowman (Carl Betz and Jeanne Crain, respectively) who board an ocean liner for a transatlantic crossing on their honeymoon. As the ship pulls out of port in New York City, John mentions to Ruth that he needs to go to the purser to deposit some cash for safekeeping. Trouble is, that's when the mystery begins. Ruth quickly finds out that her husband never keeps his appointment to meet her in the ship's lounge bar--and there's not even a record of him boarding the ship! The cabin stewardess who saw them both as she prepared the cabin politely but strongly denies that she ever saw John; and his passport and clothing are missing from their cabin!Ruth panics, understandably, and when she is reassigned to another room the captain of the ship starts to suspect that Ruth is crazy and deluded. He wants to confine Ruth to her cabin for the crossing but the much kinder ship's doctor Paul Manning (Michael Rennie) wants to investigate Ruth's story just on the chance that she might not be hallucinating after all.Nevertheless, Ruth continues to panic and this only makes the captain as well as the other passengers rather uncomfortable. After Ruth makes a big scene in the ship's ballroom even Dr. Manning agrees to let the captain forcibly confine Ruth to her cabin for the remainder of the voyage.So, now, how will this all be resolved? Ruth does get one very brief phone call from her husband John who warns her that they are being watched--is it true? Where is John--on the ship or on land? Is Ruth waving goodbye to anyone in particular as the ship pulls out of port in New York City? Watch the movie and find out--I'm certainly not about to give out spoilers!The DVD comes with an interview with Jeanne Crain's granddaughter and that's grand. There are a few other extras but this interview is really the best of them in my opinion.Dangerous Crossing is a fine mystery thriller that looks quite professional despite the fact that is was produced on a rather low budget and filmed in just nineteen days. I highly recommend this film for persons who like mysteries; and fans of Michael Rennie and the others in the cast will not be disappointed.",5,"better be careful--husbands can get lost, you know...",1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,2848,"['Dangerous', 'Crossing', 'one', 'best', 'thriller/mysteries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'mere', 'nineteen', 'days', ""'d"", 'never', 'guess', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'was', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'put', 'everyone', 'task', 'keeping', 'up', 'result', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Yes', 'ship', 'foghorn', 'too', 'much', 'early', 'half', 'film', 'atmospheric', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'camp', 'really', 'fat', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'choreography', 'action', 'scenes', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'highlight', 'darkness', 'mystery', 'action', 'meet', 'newlyweds', 'John', 'Ruth', 'Stanton', 'Bowman', 'Carl', 'Betz', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'respectively', 'who', 'board', 'ocean', 'liner', 'transatlantic', 'crossing', 'honeymoon', 'ship', 'port', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'John', 'mentions', 'Ruth', 'go', 'purser', 'deposit', 'cash', 'safekeeping', 'Trouble', 'when', 'mystery', 'Ruth', 'quickly', 'out', 'husband', 'never', 'appointment', 'meet', 'ship', 'lounge', 'bar', 'not', 'even', 'record', 'boarding', 'ship', 'cabin', 'stewardess', 'who', 'saw', 'prepared', 'cabin', 'politely', 'strongly', 'ever', 'saw', 'John', 'passport', 'clothing', 'are', 'missing', 'cabin', 'Ruth', 'panics', 'understandably', 'when', 'reassigned', 'room', 'captain', 'ship', 'suspect', 'Ruth', 'crazy', 'deluded', 'confine', 'Ruth', 'cabin', 'crossing', 'much', 'kinder', 'ship', 'doctor', 'Paul', 'Manning', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'investigate', 'Ruth', 'story', 'just', 'chance', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'hallucinating', 'all.Nevertheless', 'Ruth', 'panic', 'only', 'captain', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'passengers', 'rather', 'uncomfortable', 'Ruth', 'big', 'scene', 'ship', 'ballroom', 'even', 'Dr.', 'Manning', 'let', 'captain', 'forcibly', 'Ruth', 'cabin', 'remainder', 'voyage.So', 'now', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'resolved', 'Ruth', 'get', 'one', 'very', 'brief', 'phone', 'call', 'husband', 'John', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'watched', 'true', 'Where', 'John', 'ship', 'land', 'Ruth', 'waving', 'goodbye', 'anyone', 'particular', 'ship', 'port', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'give', 'out', 'spoilers', 'DVD', 'interview', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'granddaughter', 'grand', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'extras', 'interview', 'really', 'best', 'opinion.Dangerous', 'Crossing', 'fine', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'quite', 'professional', 'fact', 'was', 'produced', 'rather', 'low', 'budget', 'filmed', 'just', 'nineteen', 'days', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'persons', 'who', 'mysteries', 'fans', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'others', 'cast', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Dangerous Crossing
1125659,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,B0010KHOSU,Mcgivern Owen L,"[1, 1]","After a whirlwind romance, a couple set sail on the ""Monrovia"" for their dream honeymoon.  But no bliss ensues. Hubby Carl Betz (the dad on the ""Donna Reed Show""), vanishes after a trip to the Bursar's office. The frantic new bride (Jeanne Crain) is understandably beside herself! An overwrought Crain looks high and low but receives scant assistance from a polite, though skeptical crew. No one saw Betz! JC has no record of any marriage- Betz had all their papers. Viewers know all along that Crain is right but who will believe her?  There are some great noir touches: those gloomy, misty nighttime decks, dark corners, dreary corridors and that moaning foghorn. There is a spooky trip to the baggage room and that creepy old man who keeps turning up. A good review won't give a resolution but just maybe that good girl Crain will land on her feet. Maybe! The bottom line is that ""Dangerous Crossing"" is very well done.  DC is fast moving with no wasted movement. The small screen, black and white format adds to the tension. Ms. Crain is very good in the lead. She was certainly an attractive woman. Michael Rennie shines as the ship's doctor and the one supportive crew member. Honorable mention goes to veteran character actor Willis Bouchey as the ship's skipper. Many may remember his face and distinctive voice. It was he who delivered that wonderful closing line: ""Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance!"" The only negative here is one wonders what a second viewing might produce. Would it reveal a hole in the plot or would it divulge a clue or two as to what Betz was up to?  2 closing questions: When did Hollywood lose the talent for making tight, ""efficient"" films like ""Dangerous Crossing""?

The cast is competent and attractive and the production is pretty much first-rate.  The mini feature about the making of Dangerous Crossing is interesting, as it explains how movie production in the old studio days was incredibly fast.  To think this movie was filmed in 19 days, with the polished look of an A-picture, even though it was filmed with a B-picture budget.  Sets from Gentleman Prefer Blondes and Titanic were reused making the film seem more prestigious than it really was.

1125667,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0010KHOSU,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Click on the DVD special features and you'll learn a few interesting things about 'Dangerous Crossing'. First off, it only took 19 days to film; and it cost about $500,000 which was less than half of what Twentieth Century Fox was paying for their 'A' blockbusters such as 'Titanic', which also was released around the same time in 1953. Speaking of 'Titanic', a good number of the sets from that film were used in 'Crossing' along with a pool set from 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes', another 'A' feature, also released in 1953. By using the sets from those other more expensive films, this was a big reason why the producers of 'Dangerous Crossing' were able to have the film made on the cheap as well as shoot it on such a short schedule.'Dangerous Crossing' is a taut, little mystery with an ocean cruise as its setting. Jeanne Crain plays Ruth Stanton Bowman who just got married a day before and is off on her honeymoon with John Bowman (played by Carl Betz, known for his stint on TV's 'Donna Reed Show' a few years later). Once the couple boards the ship and settles into their cabin, the story takes a real spooky twist, reminiscent of a Twilight Zone episode. John disappears and the crew has no record of him being on the passenger manifest. Ruth starts to panic and the ship's captain orders the ship's physician, Paul Manning (played by the erudite Michael Rennie), to basically keep tabs on her. It appears that Ruth is off her rocker but the captain goes by the book and orders a search of the ship with negative results.The tension in the plot keeps rising as Ruth receives a mysterious call from John who warns her that both of them are in great danger and he'll have to contact her later. The call makes Ruth even more frantic as she basically begins running around the ship conducting her own investigation. At a certain point, Ruth realizes that if she continues to act hysterically and fails to contain her anger, the doctor will be forced by the captain to confine her to her quarters. So she begins pretending that her story about coming on board with her husband, is simply a figment of her imagination (an idea suggested to her by Dr. Manning).Ruth's paranoia is exacerbated when she encounters various fellow passengers and crew members all who seem quite menacing in her eyes. One passenger in particular sends her into a tailspin and that's this older German gentleman who walks with a limp and carries a cane. Of course he's just there (like most of the other crew and passengers) to throw the audience off the scent.After Dr. Manning shows Ruth a telegram from the Bureau of Investigation on the mainland that her personal physician and housekeeper know nothing about her getting married, Ruth confesses that she kept the marriage a secret. It seems she had a reason to fear someone might be after her and her new husband: right before her father died, he left her the family business--cutting out the father's half-brother who threatened the father in the event that he planned to disinherit him.Ruth experiences her 'dark moment the soul' when she encounters John on the deck and he runs away from her. In an excellent scene, she runs into the dining room and in a fit of paranoia, faints after she believes the crew members are all coming after her. The ship's captain immediately confines her to her quarters and her fears of being branded a lunatic have come true. Soon we learn that she hasn't been crazy after all. In the climactic scene, one of the ship's officers (who has been feigning illness and has been on sick leave) turns out to have impersonated Ruth's husband. Since Ruth has been confined to quarters and the ship will dock the next day, 'Bowman' attempts to strangle Ruth and throw her overboard, to make it look like she committed suicide. Manning intercepts Ruth's would-be killer and he ends up getting caught in a rope and falls overboard.Up until the ending, 'Dangerous Crossing' is a highly entertaining mystery which keeps the audience continually guessing as to the outcome. The outcome however has one main problem. If 'Bowman' had been successful, he couldn't have claimed Ruth's inheritance since it would have shed light on his whole plot to kill her. It appears that 'Bowman' was really working with Ruth's father's half-brother who probably had paid 'Bowman' to do Ruth in. So it would have been much better if 'Bowman' mentioned this to Ruth as he's about to strangle her--he could have said something to the effect, 'Remember that uncle of yours--well, he and I had a little deal. Now, I hope you finally get it.""Most of the performances in 'Dangerous Crossing' are quite good but I did feel Jeanne Crain could have kept some of those histrionics under wrap. I'm referring especially to all those fainting spells every time she ends up receiving some kind of bad news. Also I found Dr. Manning to be remarkably patient (as well as Captain Peters) in dealing with the oftentimes hysterical Ruth. I know the staff of a cruise ship must be patient and courteous to the passengers, but would crew members today be as patient with someone like Ruth, who had a continual problem in controlling her anger?'Dangerous Crossing' is a surprisingly well-made 'B' film noir. Particularly impressive is the cinematography in which a multitude of close-ups are utilized to a most efficacious effect.",4,"A neat little 'B' noir, despite leading lady's

It's all too wonderful for Ruth ... until her husband disappears, and there's no evidence of him ever having boarded the ship. In fact, there's considerable doubt as to whether he ever existed at all!Enter the handsome & caring ship's doctor (an elegant Michael Rennie), the only one on board who seems genuinely sympathetic to her plight. Of course, by this time Ruth's nerves are so rattled that she doesn't quite trust him ... but who else is there to trust? And then there's the matter of those mysterious phone calls --I won't give away any more. This is a solid thriller, with not a wasted moment, swimming with atmosphere & enough red herrings to keep you guessing (wrongly) until the very end.
