1097439,AMPW2XLJQISVZ,B000UX6TRK,"Cory B. ""Ronnie Milsap""","[3, 4]","Although he hasn't had a major hit single in almost two decades, this dynamic 2007 concert from Paris finds the great Lionel Richie looking and sounding as good as he did 20 years ago. Lionel has lost none of the talent that made him an R&B;/pop superstar in the 1970's and 80's, and his stage presence and enthusiasm for live performance is vividly displayed in this entertaining show. He is a true entertainer who knows how to deliver a vibrant and high-energy show, and his piano playing is also very solid.Backed by a strong group of musicians, Richie is clearly enjoying himself as much as the audience as he gives them a nice selection of his solo hits and his classics with the Commodores. What sets Richie apart from many R&B; stars is his ability to appeal to both black and white audiences by crafting excellent songs with great melodies that blurred the lines between pop and R&B.; Lionel is probably the only R&B; performer besides Ray Charles to recieve airplay on country music stations as well with great songs like ""Stuck on you"" and ""Deep River Woman"". The latter song featured country superstars Alabama on backing vocals. Lionel's great love ballad ""Lady"" was a number one country hit for Kenny Rogers as well. It would've been nice to hear him perform that song in this concert since Lionel could surely sing it as well or better than Kenny.Other reviewers here have complained about the sound quality on this DVD, but haven't noticed any problems with the sound on my disc. Despite the fact that a talent like this is no longer allowed on today's top 40 stations, there are enough people out there who still recognize a good thing when they hear it. Richie's latest album just recently earned a gold record and was nominated for a grammy last year. If you are looking for quality pop music by a man who knows how to write it and perform it better than anyone on the charts in 2008, this is the DVD for you.",5,A dynamic concert from a legendary master of pop and R&B,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,1927,"[""n't"", 'had', 'major', 'hit', 'single', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'dynamic', '2007', 'concert', 'Paris', 'great', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'looking', 'sounding', 'as', 'good', 'did', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Lionel', 'lost', 'none', 'talent', 'made', 'R', 'B', '/pop', 'superstar', '1970', '80', 'stage', 'presence', 'enthusiasm', 'live', 'performance', 'vividly', 'displayed', 'entertaining', 'show', 'true', 'entertainer', 'who', 'how', 'deliver', 'vibrant', 'high-energy', 'show', 'piano', 'playing', 'also', 'very', 'solid.Backed', 'strong', 'group', 'musicians', 'Richie', 'clearly', 'enjoying', 'as', 'much', 'audience', 'nice', 'selection', 'solo', 'hits', 'classics', 'Commodores', 'What', 'Richie', 'apart', 'many', 'R', 'B', 'stars', 'ability', 'appeal', 'black', 'white', 'audiences', 'crafting', 'excellent', 'songs', 'great', 'melodies', 'blurred', 'lines', 'pop', 'R', 'B', 'Lionel', 'probably', 'only', 'R', 'B', 'performer', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'recieve', 'airplay', 'country', 'music', 'stations', 'well', 'great', 'songs', 'Stuck', 'Deep', 'River', 'Woman', 'latter', 'song', 'featured', 'country', 'superstars', 'Alabama', 'backing', 'vocals', 'Lionel', 'great', 'love', 'ballad', 'Lady', 'was', 'number', 'one', 'country', 'hit', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'as', 'well', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'hear', 'perform', 'song', 'concert', 'Lionel', 'could', 'surely', 'sing', 'as', 'well', 'better', 'Kenny.Other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'complained', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'problems', 'sound', 'disc', 'fact', 'talent', 'longer', 'allowed', 'today', 'top', '40', 'stations', 'are', 'enough', 'people', 'who', 'still', 'recognize', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'hear', 'Richie', 'latest', 'album', 'just', 'recently', 'earned', 'gold', 'record', 'was', 'nominated', 'grammy', 'last', 'year', 'are', 'looking', 'quality', 'pop', 'music', 'man', 'who', 'how', 'write', 'perform', 'better', 'anyone', 'charts', '2008', 'DVD']",N/A

1097442,A2E59ENPEQUMVN,B000UX6TRK,G. Pearson,"[1, 1]","I bought this DVD in New Zealand and before looking at it, I checked out the reviews on Amazon. Upon seeing all the reviews relating to sound defects, I quickly played it. My copy was reproduced evenly through both stereo speakers, but it sounded like they forgot to put any microphones around the drummer. Lionel's vocals were recorded very well, the overall sound lacked depth and bass and a rather thin trebly sound was all I got.I don't know if this is what 5.1 surround sound is like if you only have two speakers (standard stereo), if so I would be surprised.Lionel puts on a good show, he really gets the crowd going and age is no barrier to him performing well - all the correct notes are hit and he sounds as good now as he did in the 1970's.I was looking forward to the well known song ""Endless Love"", but this was the only disappointing performance for me - he only performed half the song and he got the crowd to do all the female (Diana Ross) parts of the song - great crowd interaction, but you never got to appreciate this pretty song.In summary, a great concert, great video and very average audio, which is a shame. I am sure Lionel would be disappointed with these comments on this modern recording.",3,Great Concert - Average Recording,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,1217,"['bought', 'DVD', 'New', 'Zealand', 'looking', 'checked', 'out', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'seeing', 'reviews', 'relating', 'sound', 'defects', 'quickly', 'played', 'copy', 'was', 'reproduced', 'evenly', 'stereo', 'speakers', 'sounded', 'forgot', 'put', 'microphones', 'drummer', 'Lionel', 'vocals', 'were', 'recorded', 'very', 'well', 'overall', 'sound', 'lacked', 'depth', 'bass', 'rather', 'thin', 'trebly', 'sound', 'was', 'got.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'speakers', 'standard', 'stereo', 'would', 'be', 'surprised.Lionel', 'good', 'show', 'really', 'crowd', 'going', 'age', 'barrier', 'performing', 'well', 'correct', 'notes', 'are', 'hit', 'good', 'now', 'did', ""1970's.I"", 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'well', 'known', 'song', 'Endless', 'Love', 'was', 'only', 'disappointing', 'performance', 'only', 'performed', 'song', 'got', 'crowd', 'do', 'female', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'parts', 'song', 'great', 'crowd', 'interaction', 'never', 'got', 'appreciate', 'pretty', 'song.In', 'summary', 'great', 'concert', 'great', 'video', 'very', 'average', 'audio', 'shame', 'am', 'sure', 'Lionel', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'comments', 'modern', 'recording']",N/A

After doing some checking online I've come to the conclusion that almost everyone who has purchased this has ended up with a defective copy and the producers ignore the fans who contact them.  So sadly this is one fine concert that I won't be adding to my collection. My advice is you want to find out for yourself put away your wallet and get it from the library if you still want to hear it.,1,i hope Amazon is listening,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,533,"['really', 'enjoy', 'listening', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'doing', 'checking', 'online', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'almost', 'everyone', 'who', 'purchased', 'ended', 'up', 'defective', 'copy', 'producers', 'ignore', 'fans', 'who', 'contact', 'So', 'sadly', 'one', 'fine', 'concert', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'adding', 'collection', 'advice', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'put', 'away', 'wallet', 'get', 'library', 'still', 'want', 'hear']",N/A
