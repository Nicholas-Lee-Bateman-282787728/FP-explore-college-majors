I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the very old world series' were covered. If you can find this dvd priced at $20 or less, buy it. However, since it is rare now, don't be taken advantage of by some of the scumbag gougers who try to sell it for $40 or more. It definitely is not worth that ridiculous price.",5,AWESOME DVD,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,389,"['best', 'dvd', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'history', 'world', 'series', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'very', 'old', 'world', 'series', 'were', 'covered', 'can', 'find', 'dvd', 'priced', '20', 'less', 'buy', 'However', 'rare', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'advantage', 'scumbag', 'gougers', 'who', 'try', 'sell', '40', 'more', 'definitely', 'not', 'worth', 'ridiculous', 'price']",N/A

The show covers every World Series since 1903, when it began to 2002.  And we're not talking a 10 second mention per World Series.  The show is approximately 3 1/2 hours long, so each series is given a fair amount of time, especially the more recent years as the participants are still alive to give their recollections.  The great video clips, even from the first decade of the century, make it a terrific show. The best part for me was the segment on the 70s, which was when I discovered the game.  Lots of great memories.  Bob Costas narrates and he does a great job as he doesn't ""wax poetic"", which he has a tendency to do in his everyday job.There are interviews shown with Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Pete Rose, Tommy Lasorda, Dennis Eckersley, Joe DiMaggio, Leo Durocher, Eldon Auker (a pitcher for Detroit in the 30s, a very entertaining storyteller), Kirk Gibson, Derek Jeter, Tom Glavine, Jim Palmer, Sandy Koufax and on and on.I've seen many sports documentaries and this one will be the one in which they are all judged in the future!",5,The Best Sports Video I've Ever Seen,1094774400,"09 10, 2004",2004,1133,"['rented', '100', 'Years', 'World', 'Series', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'purchasing', 'Amazon', 'show', 'World', 'Series', '1903', 'when', 'began', '2002', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', '10', 'second', 'mention', 'World', 'Series', 'show', 'approximately', '3', '1/2', 'hours', 'long', 'series', 'given', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'especially', 'more', 'recent', 'years', 'participants', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'give', 'recollections', 'great', 'video', 'clips', 'even', 'first', 'decade', 'century', 'make', 'terrific', 'show', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'segment', '70s', 'was', 'when', 'discovered', 'game', 'Lots', 'great', 'memories', 'Bob', 'Costas', 'narrates', 'great', 'job', ""n't"", 'wax', 'poetic', 'tendency', 'do', 'everyday', 'are', 'interviews', 'shown', 'Hank', 'Aaron', 'Willie', 'Mays', 'Pete', 'Rose', 'Tommy', 'Lasorda', 'Dennis', 'Eckersley', 'Joe', 'DiMaggio', 'Leo', 'Durocher', 'Eldon', 'Auker', 'pitcher', 'Detroit', '30s', 'very', 'entertaining', 'storyteller', 'Kirk', 'Gibson', 'Derek', 'Jeter', 'Tom', 'Glavine', 'Jim', 'Palmer', 'Sandy', 'Koufax', 'on.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'sports', 'documentaries', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'are', 'judged', 'future']",N/A

So there was no World Series in 1904 and 1994.  But there are still so many memorable games and great series that this is really an extremely iteresting DVD to watch.

773815,A19Y4W9RZDRNF4,B0000C8261,Theo Logos,"[10, 12]","100 Years of the World Series is a beautifully done homage to the Fall Classic. It has outstanding production value, excellent narration (from Bob Costa), and is long enough to tell many of the great stories that grew out of one hundred years of baseball in October. The earliest World Series are mostly illustrated with well chosen still photos, in the best tradition of documentaries like Ken Burns Baseball and The Civil War, but I was surprised that there was actually a good deal of motion picture baseball footage available for a much earlier date than I would have supposed. This fine documentary should be a must see for all true baseball fans.I did have one major disappointment with this documentary, which was serious enough for me to dock a star from my review. It totally ignored the two great Pittsburgh Pirates World Series teams of the 1920s. The slight to the 1927 team is at least understandable, as they were overshadowed by and lost to Murder's Row, the great New York Yankees team considered by many to be the greatest single team in baseball history. All that was said about this team was that they had no chance despite the fact that the team contained five future Hall of Fame players - it did not even bother to name any of them. The slight to the 1925 team, which won that World Series, was much more egregious. After going into depth about Walter Johnson and the Senator's 1924 World Series victory, the 1925 World Series was covered with a bare ten seconds and one sentence, which only mentioned the Pirate victors in passing. All that the narrator could say about this exciting series (which went seven games and was the first where a team came back from being down three game to one to win the Series) was this - ""Johnson led the Senators to another World Series in 1925, but though he won two games in that classic, the Pittsburgh Pirates won game seven for their second title."" The fact that both of these Pirates teams loaded with future Hall of Fame players (Pie Trayner, Joe Cronin, Kiki Cuyler, brothers Paul & Lloyd Waner, and Max Carey) and representing a decade in which the Pirates were consistently in the first division of the National League is a major oversight and worthy of censor, especially considering the fact of how lovingly every New York loosing team was covered.Despite how badly this documentary dropped the ball in its coverage of the 1920s Pirates World Series teams, its overall excellence won me over, and I must give it an enthusiastic recommendation. If you are a baseball fan, you simply shouldn't miss this one.Theo Logos",4,"Outstanding, despite an egregious slight",1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,2584,"['100', 'Years', 'World', 'Series', 'beautifully', 'done', 'homage', 'Fall', 'Classic', 'outstanding', 'production', 'value', 'excellent', 'narration', 'Bob', 'Costa', 'long', 'enough', 'tell', 'many', 'great', 'stories', 'grew', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'baseball', 'October', 'earliest', 'World', 'Series', 'are', 'mostly', 'illustrated', 'well', 'chosen', 'still', 'photos', 'best', 'tradition', 'documentaries', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Baseball', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'deal', 'motion', 'picture', 'baseball', 'footage', 'available', 'much', 'earlier', 'date', 'would', 'have', 'supposed', 'fine', 'documentary', 'should', 'be', 'must', 'see', 'true', 'baseball', 'fans.I', 'did', 'have', 'one', 'major', 'disappointment', 'documentary', 'was', 'serious', 'enough', 'dock', 'star', 'review', 'totally', 'ignored', 'two', 'great', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pirates', 'World', 'Series', 'teams', '1920s', 'slight', '1927', 'team', 'least', 'understandable', 'were', 'overshadowed', 'lost', 'Murder', 'Row', 'great', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'team', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'greatest', 'single', 'team', 'baseball', 'history', 'was', 'said', 'team', 'was', 'had', 'chance', 'fact', 'team', 'contained', 'five', 'future', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'players', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'bother', 'name', 'slight', '1925', 'team', 'won', 'World', 'Series', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'egregious', 'going', 'depth', 'Walter', 'Johnson', 'Senator', '1924', 'World', 'Series', 'victory', '1925', 'World', 'Series', 'was', 'covered', 'bare', 'ten', 'seconds', 'one', 'sentence', 'only', 'mentioned', 'Pirate', 'victors', 'passing', 'narrator', 'could', 'say', 'exciting', 'series', 'went', 'seven', 'games', 'was', 'first', 'where', 'team', 'came', 'back', 'being', 'down', 'three', 'game', 'one', 'win', 'Series', 'was', 'Johnson', 'led', 'Senators', 'World', 'Series', '1925', 'won', 'two', 'games', 'classic', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pirates', 'won', 'game', 'seven', 'second', 'title', 'fact', 'Pirates', 'teams', 'loaded', 'future', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'players', 'Pie', 'Trayner', 'Joe', 'Cronin', 'Kiki', 'Cuyler', 'brothers', 'Paul', 'Lloyd', 'Waner', 'Max', 'Carey', 'representing', 'decade', 'Pirates', 'were', 'consistently', 'first', 'division', 'National', 'League', 'major', 'oversight', 'worthy', 'censor', 'especially', 'considering', 'fact', 'how', 'lovingly', 'New', 'York', 'loosing', 'team', 'was', 'covered.Despite', 'how', 'badly', 'documentary', 'dropped', 'ball', 'coverage', '1920s', 'Pirates', 'World', 'Series', 'teams', 'overall', 'excellence', 'won', 'must', 'give', 'enthusiastic', 'recommendation', 'are', 'baseball', 'fan', 'simply', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one.Theo', 'Logos']",N/A
