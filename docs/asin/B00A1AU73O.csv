During Ronald Reagan's term as president it was impossible to secure a print.  The rumor being that it was so bad the White House was keeping it away from the public.  Well, it's NOT the howler that we were led to believe.  At worst there are plot points that are big enough to drive a truck through and it's no better or worse than many of the Warner Brother pictures of the period.  As has already been noted this is probably the best acting Shirley Temple did as an adult and (as Bette Davis called him) Little Ronnie Reagan is his old dependable, wooden self.

It concerns a girl who is adopted as a baby by a man and woman in a town where a weathly man's daughter has recently come home from a long mental illness.  Both the woman and the wealthy man's daughter have been out of town and come home on the train.  Local gossip has it that the daughter had a baby by her boyfriend (whom her parents don't like, and played by Reagan) and ""That Hagen Girl"" is the baby.  The girl encounters mean-spirited people, who believe the worst of her, everywhere she goes.

Of course missing out on some of her films from when she was older. I had expected this movie to be good, but I loved it even more than I thought I would.Of course I knew that Shirley would be a wonderful actress in it, she always has been since the age of 5! A young Ronald Reagan protrays her suspected father and is splendid!

Rumors in the small town abound about if she was an illegitimate child of a prominent attorney, Tom Bates who disappears shortly after she is adopted then reappears when Mary is attending college. The rich boy Ken takes a fancy to Mary, but his mother puts a stop to their romance, reminding her son that Mary is ""not one of us."" At one point Mary is so fed up with her shabby treatment by the townspeople that she contemplates committing suicide; she does not understand what she has done to deserve such treatment. This movie precedes Peyton Place but it just as soapy as they come, but I found the plot riveting anyway. Shirley was about 19 years old when this film was made, so it is interesting to see her in an adult role. She was to give up movies at the ripe old age of 21. Shirley has been quoted that Mary Hagen was her favorite adult role to play. The movie is a bit pricey, but since it is rarely shown on TCM or any other channels, I felt it was a worthwhile purchase.",4,Features a college-age Shirley and young Ronald Reagan,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,1101,"['plot', 'stuff', 'soap', 'operas', 'Shirley', 'character', 'Mary', 'Hagen', 'being', 'adopted', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Rumors', 'small', 'town', 'abound', 'was', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'prominent', 'attorney', 'Tom', 'Bates', 'who', 'shortly', 'adopted', 'then', 'when', 'Mary', 'attending', 'college', 'rich', 'boy', 'Ken', 'fancy', 'Mary', 'mother', 'stop', 'romance', 'reminding', 'son', 'Mary', 'not', 'one', 'one', 'point', 'Mary', 'so', 'fed', 'up', 'shabby', 'treatment', 'townspeople', 'committing', 'suicide', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'done', 'deserve', 'such', 'treatment', 'movie', 'Peyton', 'Place', 'just', 'as', 'soapy', 'come', 'found', 'plot', 'riveting', 'anyway', 'Shirley', 'was', '19', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'interesting', 'see', 'adult', 'role', 'was', 'give', 'up', 'movies', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', '21', 'Shirley', 'been', 'quoted', 'Mary', 'Hagen', 'was', 'favorite', 'adult', 'role', 'play', 'movie', 'bit', 'pricey', 'rarely', 'shown', 'TCM', 'other', 'channels', 'felt', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'purchase']",N/A

Made to feel the outcast, Mary Hagen nevertheless perserveres througout most of the backdoor slander.Ronnie Reagan shines as her rumored father as he returns to town after a long absence.Rory Calhoun is equally versatile as Mary's love interest, who ends up dissing her under peer pressure of the townsfolk.I won't give away the entire plot as to be a spoiler.Interesting footnote:  When Ronald Reagan ran for President in 1980 copies of this film were snatched up and it was rarely if ever seen during his Administration.  Fact is, it is rarely seen today which is why its debut on DVD (even if it is DVD-R) is important.Picture quality is stellar, but the audio leaves much to be desired.
