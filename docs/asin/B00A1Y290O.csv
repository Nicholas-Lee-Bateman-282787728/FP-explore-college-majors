I enjoy Jillian Michaels, Cindy Whitmarsh and Jackie Warner and this one was up there- probably harder! The three sections offer variety depending on the amount of time a person has. The total body was a challenge! It says it's 25 minutes but with the warm-up it came in about 35 min. This is a great dvd for someone looking for a challenge!",5,Wow!,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,415,"['have', 'never', 'owned', 'dvd', 'Tracey', 'one', 'challenge', 'enjoy', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Cindy', 'Whitmarsh', 'Jackie', 'Warner', 'one', 'was', 'up', 'there-', 'probably', 'harder', 'three', 'sections', 'offer', 'variety', 'depending', 'amount', 'time', 'person', 'total', 'body', 'was', 'challenge', '25', 'minutes', 'warm-up', 'came', '35', 'min', 'great', 'dvd', 'someone', 'looking', 'challenge']",N/A
1603808,A1CO03HHPZZ75A,B00A1Y290O,Bernadette,"[0, 0]","I purchased this after reading the reviews on Amazon about the video, good and bad. I'm glad I did not listen to the bad reviews and not purchase. The core workout is 14 minutes, the lower body is 31 minutes and the total body is 33 minutes. When I combine the total body and core workout I burn almost 300 calories in under 40 minutes. Yes, she does engage your lower back, but just modify it. I had back surgery in 1997, so I'm picky about workouts as sometimes certain types will aggravate my back. So with Tracey's workout, I simply modify and still get an effective workout and a great calorie burn. For example, instead of doing plank holds with leg raises on my feet, I do them on my knees so I don't strain my back. If you're looking for a shorter, effecive workout that will leave you sore the next day then this is a must buy! I use this during the week when I have to work and can't do a complete 60 to 80 minute workout. FYI, I just ordered her other two workouts (New Body and Barre Arms/Abs) because I love this one so much!",5,Fantastic Workout!,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,1038,"['purchased', 'reading', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'video', 'good', 'bad', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'listen', 'bad', 'reviews', 'not', 'purchase', 'core', 'workout', '14', 'minutes', 'lower', 'body', '31', 'minutes', 'total', 'body', '33', 'minutes', 'When', 'combine', 'total', 'body', 'core', 'workout', 'burn', 'almost', '300', 'calories', '40', 'minutes', 'Yes', 'engage', 'lower', 'back', 'just', 'modify', 'had', 'back', 'surgery', '1997', ""'m"", 'picky', 'about', 'workouts', 'sometimes', 'certain', 'types', 'will', 'aggravate', 'back', 'Tracey', 'workout', 'simply', 'modify', 'still', 'get', 'effective', 'workout', 'great', 'calorie', 'burn', 'example', 'instead', 'doing', 'plank', 'leg', 'raises', 'feet', 'do', 'knees', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'strain', 'back', ""'re"", 'looking', 'shorter', 'effecive', 'workout', 'will', 'leave', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'then', 'must', 'buy', 'use', 'week', 'when', 'have', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'complete', '60', '80', 'minute', 'workout', 'FYI', 'just', 'ordered', 'other', 'two', 'workouts', 'New', 'Body', 'Barre', 'Arms/Abs', 'love', 'one', 'so', 'much']",N/A

Although it WILL work you, the moves are a lot more convoluted than they need to be to get a good workout, which is not ideal for someone like me who is nursing old lower back and knee injuries. And it's hard to take Tracey Mallett seriously when she says ""hexhale"" over and over again or when she talks about ""lactating"" to refer to lactic acid buildup.
