The acting isn't really great, and there is one really badly cheesey scene in the first half hour that almost made me turn off the TV. But I stuck with it, and let me tell you I LOVED this movie. The special effects were a little ... (the monster looked very animated), and some of the dialouge was bad, but this is a very psychological movie and there were plenty of scenes where I my heart starting beating fast. And one scene I jumped out of my seat. If you are really so totally skeptical... try to borrow it off friends, or get a free pass from Hollywood Video or wherever. If it is bad, and ..., you'll get over it.

After the Scream trilogy, his movies have gone downhill. This movie is basically about night terrors. It wasn't suspenseful, wasn't scary, and had no real storyline to it. I waited for the entire movie to see maybe 30 seconds of something cool and horrorific happen at the very end. But even that wasn't scary. I collect horror films. This will never be in my collection.

601110,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00005JLHF,Amanda,"[2, 6]","The first sign that I wasn't going to like this movie: it reminded me too much of that OTHER incredibly bad ""horror"" movie that came out last year, ""Darkness Falls"". Actually, for all I know, they may actually be the same exact movie, only with a different cast. Heck, they both even star former Buffy the Vampire Slayer cast members! However, that is not enough to save either movie. In ""Darkness Falls"" the evil baddie was the tooth fairy who stayed away from the light because she was all disfigured, and if anyone opened her eyes and saw her, she'd kill them. In ""They"", the evil baddie is, well, ""they"" (don't ask me what ""they"" are, please. I really don't know. And more importantly, I don't care). ""They"", like the ""tooth fairy"", like to stay out of the light. But get them alone in the dark and ""they"" can't wait to pounce on our little Mia Farrow lookalike named Julia (played by Never-Seen-Her-Before Laura Regan). You see, these little ""they"" things marked her and a few other people as children. Seems ""they"" implanted them with what looks like a splinter. Why, you ask? Because ""they"" could. That's why.Seriously though, I can't tell you too much about this film, the main reason being that it just didn't hold my attention for very long. Yes, I did finish it, and I will admit the ending was not 100% bad. However, it does not make up for the rest of the movie. The acting wasn't that good, however it was not the worst I've ever seen (for that, check out ""The Shaft"", possibly the worst excuse for a movie EVER). The plot? Well, there was one, I'm sure. I just didn't pick up on it. Probably just me. Other people may love this. But if you're looking for a good scary movie, please look elswhere. You don't even have to look that far: Wes Craven's ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series is pretty creepy. I guess he should have stayed in the realm of dreams.It's a tough world out here, Mr. Craven.

Say, Jason for example...hacks and slashes &quot;joes&quot; and &quot;janes&quot; around the camp fire.  Or Leatherface...wears skin and runs around with a chainsaw...that hacks and slashes &quot;joes&quot; and &quot;janes&quot;...I guess I have to say most horror movies have a comical sense that Gahan Wilson fans would enjoy and understand.They...is a good movie I have to say.  One that I actually took the time on several mental levels (extremely rare with movies of this day and age) to study it.  I see a lot of people fussing because there is never an answer as to what and who &quot;they&quot; are.  Well isn't that the point?  Wes Craven's movie is almost Lovecraftian simply because you can't really &quot;name&quot; the monsters.  These monsters are not Jason or Freddy or even the goofy ones in Scream.  Instead, these are fears, transformed into an almost physical body, that not only is out to get you, but darn well feast upon your wholeness.  They have no specific body, though you sometimes see hints and allegations of them, they really have no face or personality...except the personality to eat you up.Such fears go back not just to your younger days, but to those times when you were a young boy or girl, needing badly the nightlight of Mickey Mouse or Bugs Bunny so that you can sleep peacefully.  Yet when that light bulb burns out.  You know and I know that &quot;they&quot;, or so in the mind of a child, come out.  Of course they really never got us...but I would hypothesize that these creatures were our first realization that there was a darker more sinister aspect of reality, not really hell, but an underworld where there were monsters and gnashing of teeth.If you truly watch They you will realize that Wes Craven is not really wanting to give you the next Freddy or Jason or Leatherface.

601112,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLHF,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 5]","People are defending this movie?  I'm stumped, but whatever.  Not to knock anyone else's taste (who am I to judge) but this movie was one of those films that left me scratching my head, and not in a good way.  I know that Jeff Shannon's review states that it is a subtle shocker; one that is `creepily engrossing' but I found it just plain boring, and rather stupid.  This was the trend in the early 00's though; blast out a billion of these PG-13 horror films to capitalize on the success of that 99 ghost movie (yes, I'm playing the `...Sixth Sense' card again, but it fits so why not) and see how much money we can make off of an overdone plot point.  This film just doesn't offer anything new or exciting.  The plot is under worked and the scares (I know that the reviewer makes it sound like a good thing that the film isn't `in your face' scary, but isn't that the point of a horror film?) are nearly non-existent; and when they come they are generic and borderline laughable.Seriously, stay away from this dud.To feign sounding ignorant to those who claim that I just don't `get it'; I want to make it clear that the concept here is actually one I find rather intriguing.  I mean, the idea that our fears are shaped by the ambiguous ones that plagued our childhood is pretty ingenious, and the concept of shaping a film around those ever-shape-shifting fears is one that could have worked gloriously; I just find the films construction and delivery to be lacking in some very key areas.  It just doesn't come together like it should have.  But, maybe the concept is too vague to work when you think about it.  Some things that work on an intellectual level can't work from an entertainment perspective, and I fear that that issue comes into play here.  The movie-going public likes resolutions.  They like to know what they rooting for and or rooting against.  Keeping things so vague and mysterious can become frustrating and irritating when the resolution is swept out from under us.We like to be `guessing', but we also like to be told if we are `right'.I just think this film fell completely apart and needed to be reworked and maybe even completely scrapped.  Instead, what seems like a brilliant concept becomes a forgettable and at time laughable reminder that Hollywood can only make the same film so many ways so many times before it becomes a statistic.",2,Really?,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2370,"['People', 'are', 'defending', 'movie', ""'m"", 'stumped', 'whatever', 'Not', 'knock', 'anyone', 'else', 'taste', 'who', 'am', 'judge', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'know', 'Jeff', 'Shannon', 'review', 'subtle', 'shocker', 'one', 'creepily', 'engrossing', 'found', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'rather', 'stupid', 'was', 'trend', 'early', '00', 'blast', 'out', 'billion', 'PG-13', 'horror', 'films', 'capitalize', 'success', '99', 'ghost', 'movie', 'yes', ""'m"", 'playing', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'card', 'again', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'can', 'make', 'off', 'overdone', 'plot', 'point', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'exciting', 'plot', 'worked', 'scares', 'know', 'reviewer', 'good', 'thing', 'film', ""n't"", 'face', 'scary', ""n't"", 'point', 'horror', 'film', 'are', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'when', 'come', 'are', 'generic', 'borderline', 'laughable.Seriously', 'stay', 'away', 'dud.To', 'feign', 'sounding', 'ignorant', 'who', 'claim', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'want', 'make', 'clear', 'concept', 'here', 'actually', 'one', 'find', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'mean', 'idea', 'fears', 'are', 'shaped', 'ambiguous', 'ones', 'plagued', 'childhood', 'pretty', 'ingenious', 'concept', 'shaping', 'film', 'ever-shape-shifting', 'fears', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'gloriously', 'just', 'find', 'films', 'construction', 'delivery', 'be', 'lacking', 'very', 'key', 'areas', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'should', 'have', 'maybe', 'concept', 'too', 'vague', 'work', 'when', 'think', 'things', 'work', 'intellectual', 'level', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'entertainment', 'perspective', 'fear', 'issue', 'play', 'here', 'movie-going', 'public', 'likes', 'resolutions', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'rooting', 'rooting', 'Keeping', 'things', 'so', 'vague', 'mysterious', 'can', 'become', 'frustrating', 'irritating', 'when', 'resolution', 'swept', 'us.We', 'be', 'guessing', 'also', 'like', 'be', 'told', 'are', ""right'.I"", 'just', 'think', 'film', 'fell', 'completely', 'apart', 'needed', 'be', 'reworked', 'maybe', 'even', 'completely', 'scrapped', 'Instead', 'what', 'brilliant', 'concept', 'forgettable', 'time', 'laughable', 'reminder', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'only', 'make', 'same', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'statistic']",They

The script, the setup and the pace were all below a tolerable level.Basic premise that probably a number of people have already written:  four people suffered from night terrors as children, have been marked with some type of sliver-wound that bleeds when &quot;They&quot; are targeted and are disappearing one-by-one while (surprise!) no one believes them.  To be honest, that's it.  Nothing else is explained in this movie at all.

It could have redeemed it, but alas, it was not to be.I read that there were 10 writers that worked on this script -- I'm pretty sure they won't be working on another movie for some time after this snoozer.My recommendation:  You want Craven?

Now 19 years later the nightmares have resurfaced, but this time he awakens with a Freddy Krueger-esque slash mark on his hand that won't heal. He calls his friend Julia (Laura Reagan) and when she meets Billy at a local diner she finds him dishevelled and visibly disturbed. The explaination is simple: Billy tells Julia that he is haunted by dark dwelling creatures that can affect electricity (And of course, has a thirst for human blood). But conveniently there are mysterious power fluctuations in the diner which electrocute Billy before he can give Julia the full story. Is this a plot device to help build suspense; or is it just plain old-fashioned indolence on the Screenwriter's part? Watch and decide for yourself.What's more macabre is that prior to Billy's death, strange events that could only be of supernatural origin have been occuring in Julia's house: Such as random short circuits, blood gurgling out of the bathroom sink and an icky black substance smeared on her bathroom mirror.

The acting is decent enough, the emotions from the characters whenever something bizarre or sad happens is believable (most of the time) but the biggest problem with this film is that it was completely boring.  Not interesting for a single second until the final 5 minutes.Yes that's right- over an hour and 20 goes by and THEN something interesting happens.  The ending is pretty good, but the story throughout the movie should have focused on what eventually happened to the woman instead of waiting until the VERY end to show it.  How much longer were we expected to wait until something interesting happens?  The writers should have focused on what ended up happening to the young woman for the other characters in the movie.The signs that something horrible was about to happen to certain people by a blood mark appearing somewhere on their body was more along the lines of bad and lazy writing instead of interesting ""what's going to happen next?"" story-telling.  Whenever something bad was about to happen to the characters (such as the woman who was swimming in the dark) the actual suspense honestly wasn't there at ALL almost the entire time.  The only good part (besides the ending) was the guy in the restaurant who had a gun in the beginning of the movie (I won't spoil what happened here).Plus the entire movie was completely dark (like I mention above in the opening line).

This movie tries to make a case for basing that fear in reality. Doesn't do such a hot job of it.Here's the scoop. Julia young, (Laura Regan looking like a young Mia Farrow) while knocking on the door of her Masters in Psychology, is in the presence of one of her patients, Billy, who suffers from night terrors when he kills himself. As she herself suffered the same malady as a child she's traumatized by the event. She meets two of his friends at the funeral who reiterate Billy's feeling that that the fear is not irrational but that beings 'on the other side' target victims and, at some time, drag them over. Strange events begin to suggest he might be right.There are some reviewers who want to champion this film and I can see why. A person wrestling with personal demons and trying to determine fantasy from reality makes for a good story. Somehow, though, this just didn't come off. This sort of thing has been done before and I always liked the way the better versions see-sawed the case of reality vs. insanity. Here they didn't make enough case for her going off the deep end, so I pretty much figured the 'other side' was real. Plus: Here they needed the constant rain, and threats of New York City summer power outages to facilitate a dark setting where the demons can emerge. What if your in some place where those aren't an issue? Do the demons leave those kids alone? Too many issues like that in the movie.

Most horror movies are ruined by the endings, and this was one of them. Even with the alternate ending, the whole movie would have led to sadness. There was really no way out for Julia from the beginning because THEY had her trapped from the start.Julia (Laura Regan) is a Psychologist in training at college. As a Psychologist, she would come up with a logical explanation for things that are happening. But there is no way to get out of the reality that her world will fall apart around her. When her lifelong friend Billy tries to warn Julia that THEY, the monsters in their closet which may not be so imaginative, are coming back for them, she knows he must be teetering on the brink of insanity. Billy shows her a strange scar that he believes came from THEY so he can be identified, she still thinks there has to be an explanation. When he takes his own life right in front of her, she finally realizes his overactive mind may not have not been so fake after all. When several people she meets end up with a strange and mysterious mark, just like the one Billy had, out of nowhere, she knows he may have been right. When the same mark appears on her forehead, and something comes out of it, she knows she doesn't have much time to live. As she tries to escape the horrorfick vortex that THEY have caught her in, THEY finally come after her in a way she cannot escape.The acting in the movie was okay. I have to say the only good acting in the whole thing was done by Laura Regan. She was great. The plot was good, but if only they could've made it a better ending. Like someone said before, the alternate ending would have given it the Wes Craven idea. Somewhat like Alfred Hitchcock, or John Carpenter. But why was it called Wes Craven presnts They? He didn't even write the story. That was probably ...for publicity just to get attention. I thought the movie would be somewhat perdictable, but it wasn't nearly as perdictable as I thought, considering THEY would jump out at any time, all of the sudden.

I wasnt impressed and not scared one bit. Specifically, when I saw the PG-13 and from ""Dimension"", I knew I'd be disappointed.Laura Regan, the main actress, did well with the material and was the only character I was interested in a bit. Her and some other folks all theorized that this mark somewhere on their body was from their childhood, when something that lurked in the dark apparently tried to get them. Those with the mark meant that something was coming to complete their accquisition. Why did THEY wait so long? Was their anything about these people that made them want them specifically? I guess that it's just that they all had night terrors as a child and THEY liked that. Maybe it made them easier to be taken or something.Why would the mark suddenly appear on the soon-to-be victims? On the main character, how could a giant splinter not even be noticeable in her head -- even if the mark couldn't be seen yet? Why could THEY be able to appear in the light at the end and take the lady to some kind of spooky dimension? What made them able to turn off lights?Heck...one of the most interesting parts, to me, was when the psychologist asked the patient, who was in college to be a psychologist, to analyze herself.The alternate ending -- the lone extra feature on the DVD -- was cooler. In that, she was a psychiatric patient since childhood and the entire movie was her schizophrenic delusion. Some of the other patients were, in the movie, different characters in her mind. For example, her own psychologist was shown in a chair getting medicine.This should have been the ending; it would have been a bit neater. I figure that a person with a major mental illness could be forgiven for having 'plot holes' in the delusions. It must have also been a in-the-mind creation that Wes Craven presented this; he's not listed anywhere on the package except for above the title of the movie.

The boy tells his mother that he's afraid.  But, his mother reassures him that everything will be fine.  However, everything turns out very wrong, and something grabbed the child.Fast forward 19 years.  Julia (Laura Regan) is a young psychology Master's degree candidate.  She is out on a date with her boyfriend Paul (Marc Blucas) when she gets a frantic phone call from Billy (Jon Abrahams).  Billy and Julia were childhood friends and both suffered from ""night terrors"".  Julia agrees to meet with Billy; much to the chagrin of Paul.  Upon arriving, Julia notices the bad condition Billy is in.  He begins babbling incoherently about ""They""; the creatures that tormented him as a child.  This babbling goes on for several minutes until Billy pulls out a gun and kills himself right in front of Julia.A few days later at the funeral, Julia meets two other friends of Billy: Sam (Ethan Embry) and Terry (Dagmara Dominczyk).  They too suffered from the same night terrors that Billy and Julia did. After talking for a while, Julia learned that Billy, Sam, and Terry suffered with nightmares well into college.  Each also displayed a  strange mark on their skin.  Billy also kept a journal, and Sam has become engrossed in each entry.  The marks on the skin are believed to be something left behind by the creatures so that they could come back later and collect them.Sure enough, Sam and Terry are ""collected"".  Julia, fearing that she might have the mark, asks Paul to check.  Finding nothing, Julia begins to feel somewhat better.  However, Paul didn't check everywhere and soon, Julia is suffering from her own new set of night terrors.  Is all of this in her head, as her psychologist expects, or is she really convinced that ""They"" are coming back for her?This is a very good movie.  It took a while for me to get into the plot, but after a short time, I became engrossed in the film.  The plot is expertly designed around the nightmares of children, and its something everyone can relate to.I highly recommend this movie.

The movie does create a somewhat decent atmosphere, and it is a bit creepy, but there are severe faults in the course of the movie that prevented me (And possibly others) from enjoying it fully.The first problem, I would say, involves the ending. The alternate ending available on the DVD is actually very good, and would have made the movie much better (Maybe even raising it to a two-and-a-half or even three-star rating). However, the ""real"" ending is quite disappointing. It builds up the movie to a conclusion that is never concluded. It's the sort of ending that you'd get when somebody thinks they're being clever or fooling around with your brain, but really, they're just being lazy and not finishing off the movie.The second, and much more devastating problem is that Laura Regan does a terrible job and her character is a poor choice for a heroine. It's bad enough that Regan can't act to save her life (Figuratively or literally, however you look at it). It's made only worse by her stupid, stupid character.You know those horror movie cliches that annoy you? Like when a character is all alone in a creepy house wearing nothing but their underwear and then they decide, ""Hmm, the attic would be a good place to hide?"" This movie is full of those stupid cliches / decisions, and almost all of them come from the heroine. She is unlikeable, unbelievable, and very difficult to sympathize with, which makes the movie difficult to enjoy.On the plus side, the creatures are nicely rendered and pretty creepy. Also, I'm pleased to see that the movie relies less on cheap scares and gore and more on subtle suspense and eeriness (Even though it kind of weakens down as it goes on).This is a movie that could have been incredibly scary if the script was retooled a bit and if the main character was replaced by somebody we could like.Though, I have to say... Regan is disgustingly skinny... and her frame is by far the scariest thing I have seen in years. Yech!VIOLENT CONTENT - Most violence is off-screen. There is no gore. There are some dark images and ""They"" grab people and drag them around on the ground, which is a bit disturbing... but it's mostly not that bad.LANGUAGE CONTENT - Almost none. Nothing worse than what you'd hear on a sitcom on network TV.NUDITY / SEXUAL CONTENT - I seem to remember at least one needless shower scene, but there isn't any nudity. There are a couple of scenes where some characters are just about to become intimate, and nothing is shown.",2,Hmm... this is frustrating to watch.,1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,2603,"['would', 'give', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'think', 'direction', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'enough', 'merit', 'two', 'movie', 'create', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'atmosphere', 'bit', 'creepy', 'are', 'severe', 'faults', 'course', 'movie', 'prevented', 'possibly', 'others', 'enjoying', 'fully.The', 'first', 'problem', 'would', 'say', 'ending', 'alternate', 'ending', 'available', 'DVD', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'Maybe', 'even', 'raising', 'two-and-a-half', 'even', 'three-star', 'rating', 'However', 'real', 'ending', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'never', 'concluded', 'sort', 'ending', ""'d"", 'get', 'when', 'somebody', ""'re"", 'being', 'clever', 'fooling', 'brain', 'really', ""'re"", 'just', 'being', 'lazy', 'not', 'finishing', 'off', 'movie.The', 'second', 'much', 'more', 'devastating', 'problem', 'Laura', 'Regan', 'terrible', 'job', 'character', 'poor', 'choice', 'heroine', 'bad', 'enough', 'Regan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'save', 'life', 'Figuratively', 'literally', 'however', 'look', 'made', 'only', 'worse', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'character.You', 'know', 'horror', 'movie', 'cliches', 'annoy', 'when', 'character', 'alone', 'creepy', 'house', 'wearing', 'nothing', 'underwear', 'then', 'decide', 'Hmm', 'attic', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'place', 'hide', 'movie', 'full', 'stupid', 'cliches', '/', 'decisions', 'almost', 'come', 'heroine', 'unlikeable', 'unbelievable', 'very', 'difficult', 'sympathize', 'movie', 'difficult', 'enjoy.On', 'plus', 'side', 'creatures', 'are', 'nicely', 'rendered', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'Also', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'see', 'movie', 'less', 'cheap', 'scares', 'gore', 'more', 'subtle', 'suspense', 'eeriness', 'Even', 'kind', 'weakens', 'down', '.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'incredibly', 'scary', 'script', 'was', 'retooled', 'bit', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'replaced', 'somebody', 'could', 'like.Though', 'have', 'say', 'Regan', 'disgustingly', 'skinny', 'frame', 'far', 'scariest', 'thing', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'Yech', 'VIOLENT', 'CONTENT', 'Most', 'violence', 'off-screen', 'gore', 'are', 'dark', 'images', 'grab', 'people', 'drag', 'around', 'ground', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'mostly', 'not', 'bad.LANGUAGE', 'CONTENT', 'Almost', 'none', 'Nothing', 'worse', 'what', ""'d"", 'hear', 'sitcom', 'network', 'TV.NUDITY', '/', 'SEXUAL', 'CONTENT', 'seem', 'remember', 'least', 'one', 'needless', 'shower', 'scene', ""n't"", 'nudity', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'become', 'intimate', 'nothing', 'shown']",They

What could possibly be more frightening than something trying to ""get"" you, and you have no idea who they are, what they are, or how to fight them? Seriously, that's awful stuff.However, it doesn't work in a film. In a film, you need identifiable heroes and villains. The viewers need to have an understanding of what the evil is. For example, the scariest films of all time have identifiable villains. Two films come to mind: The Exorcist, and Silence of the Lambs. Actually knowing what we're up against made them more frightening.In THEY, we have no idea what the people in the movie are up against, so how could we possibly be frightened? We know that they are, but what good does that do us? We some spidery creatures that look like a cross between Gollum and an Alien, but who knows what their motives are?This makes for a very bland, boring, and snooze-worthy film.

I saw it at the theater when it first came out and thought it was okay.I then watched it a year or two ago and really liked it better.Now, I just finished watching it again, in my living room, lights off, fan humming, and...wow!I'm in love!The movie is all about mood and atmosphere,so,to truly feel its vibe, you need to tune out the world for 90 minutes and just let it take you.If your talking, getting up, eating...whatever, forget feeling the magic of the film.If your looking for a quick scare, don't hold your breath.What your watching is really designed to be just one long, feverish nightmare.Sure, it's got a Freddy-Fever thing going on and it's virtually a remake of 'Don't be afriad of the Dark' with actress Laura Regan filling Kim Darby's shoes.But the sleepy style has it's own little 'creepy crawly' thing going on. If you are a true horror movie fan, someone who thinks outside of the box, you will at least appreciate the tension weaved through each scene and the film-nor like flavor.What also helps is the outstanding cast. Laura Regan may not be, in my opinion, a great actress but she sure does look strange and haunted throughout the film. (not to mention that she has one helluva long neck!) She was also in another little film called 'My little Eye' and she looked just as spooked in that one. Good movie by the way!I also love Ethan Embry! He's so bizarre, but adorable at the same time. I'm surprised he hasn't made a name for himself, commercially that is. He's really a fantastic actor. He's been in so many off-beat movies like,Dutch, Empire Records, and Disturbing Behavior, just to name a few. He's really awesome to watch......and another thing, even though I'm not into alternateendings found on many DVDS as a special feature (I feel one solid ending is all I need. I hate when the producers feel as if I need to see 'another conclusion' to the story. All it reminds me of is that what I just watched was a commercial product and more than one hand was mixing the stew. It's like I just witnessed a 'choose your own adventure story' which is rather lame. I recall the movie 'Joyride' having more than three endings on the DVD. Come on!? Talk about loosing the magic of what I just watched. Yuck!However, in this case,the alternate ending is pretty cool and doesn't really take away from the first one.But I really, really liked the theatrical ending, compared to the 'Wizard of Oz' like finale.Great stuff here Wes! Goosebumps for sure! I'm a huge avid movie lover,especially horror, I live and breath this stuff. And I will have to say, 'Wes Craven's They' is a nice little creepy dark ride.

You don't get to see the creatures very well, and when you do, it's too dark to make anything out.  The story is stale, the acting is stale, and the ending is a bigger letdown than the rest of the film.  In short, I don't recommend this flick to anyone unless they are a hardcore Wes Craven fan.

That was one of the greatest horror movie performances of all time.  Laura Regan in ""They"" has a definite Mia Farrow quality about her and I think that her performance in this film compares favorably to what Farrow was capable of in her prime.  In fact, all the performances in this film are uniformly excellent.This is a film made with dedication and with class.  This movie was presumably accomplished quickly and cheaply but it was not done sloppily or cheesily. The goal for the director, the actors and the production staff was to craft a quality little horror movie that they would be proud to show to their friends as well as to their peers.  I appreciate the careful effort that they put into this movie and I hope they will all go on to bigger things and bigger budgets.As is the case with nearly every horror movie ever made, the plot is the weakest link in the endeavor.  I couldn't even begin to speculate who ""They"" are.  The computer-generated creatures that we see emerging from the dark aren't very convincing or especially menacing.  It would have been better if ""They"" had been presented as black-on-black, hallucinatory shadows that can only be half-glimpsed and half-comprehended. The enigma of night terrors must be maintained.The ending of this film isn't entirely satisfying because the plot itself is too muddled to lead up to a well-structured conclusion.  But I didn't hate the way the movie ends.  What happens is dark and surprising and I won't ever forget it.Some people are happy if their horror flicks are stuffed with shocks and schlock and nothing else much matters to them.  But other people can appreciate the outstanding acting, directing and production design that goes into a movie like this one.

601146,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLHF,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","You can tell that &quot;Wes Craven Presents They&quot; is a horror film because it looks like a horror film (dark and creepy) and it sounds like a horror film (unrelenting ominous music).  The fact that the title is &quot;Wes Craven Presents They&quot; is another clue that it is supposed to be a horror film, but the problem is that for most of this thriller it is working so hard to be a horror film that it ultimately fails.The &quot;they&quot; in &quot;They&quot; are basically the things that go bump in the night, although in the film's prologue, set nineteen years earlier, one small child finds out that they do more than that.  The title of &quot;They&quot; reminds me of the black &amp; white sci fi classic &quot;Them,&quot; the difference being that in the latter we got to see the giant ants in all their giant puppet glory and in this film we are not really sure what &quot;They&quot; are.  We know that they come in the dark and maybe there is something to do with a doorway opening between our world and their world or dimension or cubbyhole or whatever.The heroine in distress is Julia Lund (Laura Regan), who is finishing up her master's degree in psychology.  As a child she was plagued by &quot;night terrors,&quot; and those come rushing back again after a friend kills himself, insisting that that horrible creatures of the night have been coming after him in the dark and that they will be coming for Julia next.  Suddenly defending her thesis is not the worst thing she has to face in the week to come.  Of course, the obvious irony is that as creepy things start happening to her everyone starts to think that Julia should be declared a crazy person and should not be in any position to treat them.Brendan Hood is credited as the screenwriter for &quot;They,&quot; but my understanding is that he came up with the basic idea and original draft and then about a dozen writers and producers came in and turned it into this mess.  I was totally surprised at the end of this movie.  Not &quot;surprised&quot; in the sense that the ending was unexpected, but &quot;surprised&quot; in the sense that suddenly the movie was over and as the credits started to roll I stopped munching my popcorn and said, &quot;That's it?&quot;  However, this ending is better than the alternative ending, even though it makes less sense (you will understand when you see the alternative ending).Lund, who played Jessica Lynch in last year's made for TV film, does a good enough job given what the script gives her to work with in this 2002 film.  However, the actress is done a disservice by a totally unnecessary nude shot.  When you make a point of avoiding showing body parts in several bedroom scenes and then suddenly do it for no reason whatsoever, it offends me.  Making a horror film that is not scary offends me too, but not as much.It was nice to see Marc Blucas as Julia's boyfriend, showing that the abilities to deal with a strange girl friend that he showed on television's &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; are still going strong.  Seeing him also reminded me of another film by a &quot;BtVS&quot; alumni, &quot;Darkness Falls,&quot; with Emma Caulfield, which also has something that only goes bump in the night.

(MONSTERS INC. does a great job in &quot;satirizing&quot; those fears).  Wes Craven &quot;presents&quot; this film, and although Harmon did a bang-up job in 1986's &quot;The Hitcher&quot;, his aproach in this one is more subtle.  It is a moody, often terrifying look at the possibility that there were monsters under the bed and in the closet.  And as some other reviewers have mentioned, those &quot;things&quot; never really did have a specific form or content; they just popped out of wherever and hopefully you were lucky enough to wake up and find out you were just dreaming.Harmon's film is generally well done, with some creepy creatures that jump out and scare you quite effectively. Laura Regan as the heroine, Julia, and Marc Blucas as her studly Paul, don't come up to Streep or Cruise, but they are generally effective.  Regan's waifishness and naivete make her fragile character more sympathetic.The DVD has an alternate ending that would have been effective, too, although the movie's &quot;official&quot; ending is a little more imaginative, if a little bit depressing.THEY is one of those movies that could stay with a child, or one of those adults who still don't like being in the dark.

601154,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JLHF,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 3]","You've got to love movies where Wes Craven's name is listed along with the title, as if that somehow makes the film better.  Wes Craven isn't actually the director (that honor belonging to Robert Harmon and Rick Bota), so his connection to the film is tenuous at best.  Besides, these days, Craven's name on horror movies isn't necessarily a plus.They's plot is simple: boogeymen are real (maybe) and they mark human children for kidnapping and eating later.Or something like that. We follow the life of willowy Julia Lund (Laura Regan), a graduate student preparing to defend her thesis on psychology.  With her long neck and bowl cut, Lund has a compelling screen presence; she's especially good at welling up with tears at a whim.Two men orbit our heroine, her EMT boyfriend Paul Loomis (Marc Blucas) and her childhood male friend Billy Parks (Jon Abrahams). The boyfriend is something of an anomaly; he's a medical professional that lives with his two shlub roommates. Understandably, Julia doesn't want to sleep over...although she does anyway, despite the fact one of the idiot roommates walks in on her naked. More on the sleeping arrangements later.Billy is a wreck.  He has a history of drug use and paranoia, and when rolling blackouts threaten to roll across the city (which I think is New York, but was never sure), he totally flips out.  Billy is convinced that the things that go bump in the night are out to get him, and eventually, poor Julia.  Why they're out to get Billy NOW, as opposed to say, when they originally tagged him in the beginning of the movie as a child, we have no idea.  Billy prattles on about how both he and Julie suffered from ""night terrors"" as children and that the things causing the night terrors have returned to collect them.  Speaking of which, night terrors are integral to the plot but never adequately explained. The frantic conversation ends with Billy committing suicide in front of Julia by shooting himself in the head.Understandably distraught, Julia visits Billy's funeral, where she meets two other victims.  One of them, Sam Burnside (Ethan Embry), is an artist who chain-smokes and paints really crappy pictures.  The other roommate, Terry Alba (played by sultry Dagmara Dominczyk), doesn't seem to do anything but speak with a strange accent and walk around in a swimsuit.  It's obvious from the start that both of these folks are doomed.All of the characters seem to have difficulty finding someone to share their bed with, despite even Julia having a steady boyfriend.  When her boyfriend does sleep over, he sleeps in a separate room for reasons that are never explained.  And yet, Julia has no problem sleeping in her boyfriend's bed (you know, the one with the two loud roommates who walk in on her naked). Sorry, if I was freaked that things might eat me at night, I'd find a bedmate, even if it was only a platonic bedmate.  Sam and Terry seem like perfect candidates for just such an arrangement, but they of course split up...They tries really hard to scare us without scaring us, relying on creatures half-seen.  I couldn't help but feel cheated; I really wanted to see some cool monster effects.  We never get that much.  Instead, we get a lot of information: THEY cannot abide the light, THEY can cause electrical devices to go out, and THEY tag humans as children with long slivers of bone.  It's almost like an alien abduction scenario, only THEY are interdimensional kidnappers.They suffers from the same problem as Silent Hill; the heroine doesn't really have a realistic chance of fighting back against the bad guys.  Instead, she's relegated to running, screaming, and then more running into really stupid places like subways.  The rolling blackout threat never seems to come to pass; I had visions of the entire city being overrun as the lights went out. But no such luck, this is Julia's story and hers alone.The ending is grim and particularly unsatisfying.  The alternate ending on the DVD was much bolder and certainly excused the flimsy plot.  But unfortunately, the directors balked (or maybe it was good old Wes) and we end up with a standard plot with standard monsters and standard victims.For all its flaws, They is still a pretty good creepfest.  It's just not a very satisfying movie, and after awhile the heroine's histrionics become irritating enough that you start rooting for the monsters to eat her.",2,Is this them?

Lunds portrayl of the hapless, night-terror victim brought me to nausea before the first half-hour, and dozens will agree that once the creatures drag her into thier world forever, you'll be applauding the credits. Suprisingly, Blucas proved a weak actor as well. Could it be bad scripting? Who knows, but more importantly, who cares?!If Craven's near-plajarism of 'IT,' in scenes such as Lund's getting spurted in the face by sink drain-scum, don't make you weary of deja-vu', you might as well turn off the VCR. Most of the entire plot was a recreation of various nightmare-themed films, many of which Craven himself crafted (Yes, I know it's pathetic). Lighting and sets were appropriately dreary, the music reminescent of ""Scream""'s, and the CG used for the night-terrors is neatly composited, but even long-time fans of Craven's macabre mastery may be sadly disappointed.

This time, however, &quot;they&quot; are going to take them away for good.The film centers around Julia, a psychology grad student, who receives a phone call from an old friend of hers. While at a diner, her friend Billy explains that &quot;they&quot; are coming to get him and that he's so scared. Unable to understand what he's talking about, Julia tries desperately to make sense of the situation.

601167,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JLHF,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Wes Craven Presents: They (Rick Bota and Robert Harmon, 2002)Robert Harmon's name appears at the end of They. Rick Bota's does not. I get the feeling Bota originally directed and Harmon was called in to save the resulting mess. If so, he did a surprisingly good job of it.When this movie came out, it was universally trashed. Not surprising. Any movie whose name begins (director) Presents... is usually going to be horrific. (There are exceptions, however; Robert Zemeckis presented us with The Frighteners in 1996. Keep that in mind.) Wes Craven has an especially bad record, having ""presented"" us such gems as Mind Ripper, a film even the combined talents of Giovanni Ribisi AND Lance Henriksen couldn't save. Lurking under the surface of They, however, is actually a really good movie. And it comes out at times.Explaining why this is would be a vague, but major, spoiler, so get ready for it. If you plan on seeing the film and haven't yet, stop reading now.I am willing to give points, automatically, to any film that doesn't automatically embrace the Hollywood ending. So when I got to the final moments of They, and it ended exactly where I hoped it would, I was mightily impressed. (Note: I understand the UK release had an alternate, Hollywood-esque, ending. Sorry, you lot.) Yes, it does have an exceptional sense of deja vu attached to it (if you see the end of this movie and don't think of a certain John Carpenter film, you probably need to go back and watch said Carpenter film again; saying which one it is would be giving away too much), but Harmon handles it better than Carpenter did. And that, my friends, is one hell of a trick, when you think about it. Remember, this was a film Carpenter directed at the height of his powers.The movie centers on Julia (Laura Regan, who had a two-minute part in Unbreakable, and recently played the title role in Saving Jessica Lynch), a grad psychology student whose best childhood friend, Billy (Boston Public's Jon Abrahams), has just committed suicide. Billy, like Julia, suffered from extreme night terrors as a child. At his funeral, Julia meets two of Billy's other close friends from long ago, Sam (Ethan Embry, looking almost unrecognizable) and Terry (Keeping the Faith temptress Dagmara Dominczyk). They, too, had night terrors as children. (One wonders how a kid kept two different sets of childhood friends.) Billy's night terrors had returned just before his death, and he was convinced the things in his dreams were coming back to get him. Thus, his death. All well and good (and providing some excellent black humor, wonderfully timed; a rarity in films like this), except now the others are starting to get the same idea...There's a lot here, and some of it is unexplored. Normally, that drives me to distraction, but this time I found myself hoping they'd make a sequel focusing on Sarah (Kingdom Hospital's Jodelle Ferland), a young girl Julia meets while trying to uncover the mystery of the night terrors. Sarah is a patient in a hospital who also suffers from night terrors, and knows who They are. This led to all kinds of questions in my head. There's a hospital dedicated to studying night terrors? The staff have collected all these stories about They? Could the staff, too, know about They? (If so, the final scene takes on an added dimension of ominousness that many viewers might have missed; think about it.) Put together a sequel about Sarah, once she's Julia's age, but with more street-smarts than Julia (who is, to play devil's advocate, slightly smarter than your average monster lunch, but probably not up to the brain level of your typical psychology grad student-- at least, judging by her actions here), and you could have one serious barnburner on your hands.

601170,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00005JLHF,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[17, 19]","So much better than its reputation that it's scary, ""They"" is a cryptic, cerebral horror movie that's like the Rorscach Test of film: what one person sees in it may be vastly different than the way another views it, and that could be the main reason behind the wildly mixed reaction it's received.The nameless, shapeless things that scare you in your room during childhood, glimpsed in shadow or heard in silence, or suddenly perceived while half-asleep, are real.  Or are they?  At least one young man thinks they are, thinks they're still watching, and thinks he's discovered ways to track their patterns.  After getting in contact with childhood friend (and ""They""'s main protagonist) Julia Lund, Julia finds herself drawn into the 'delusions' of her friend, who shows all the signs of deep mental illness and severe paranoia.  But could he still be right?  A number of others experiencing the same apparant phenomenon enter the picture, and it becomes uncomfortably clear to Julia that ""They"" may be more than paranoid imaginations.With great performances all around, including Laura Regan (Julia), Jon Abrahams, and perhaps most of all Dagmara Dominczyk, and alternately gloomy/eerie and gorgeous/eerie cinematography (see the nighttime road scene shrouded in fog and surrounded by dense trees) this is a seriously underrated horror movie.  Some have said its weakness is it only seems to be showing the tip of the iceberg of what its capable of.  I disagree with the 'weakness' part, I agree that for the vast majority of the movie it's only showing the tip of the iceberg.  There's something big under the surface here, something on par, perhaps, with the likes of what H.P. Lovecraft would imagine.  I'm not saying I would expect Chthulu or Yog-Sottoth to show up in a potential sequel, but that something on a really mysterious and grand scale Similar to what Lovecraft would write is (or could be) at play here.  The ending is shocking. (And a hundred times preferable to the Alternate Ending, which not coincidentally was the last Alternate Ending on a movie I really loved that I ever watched.  I'm kind of thinking now, 'if it's great the first time around I might be better off skipping the alternate, lest it dilute the movie in my mind'.  This alternate ending kind of weakened ""They"" in my mind but only for a few weeks, after which it returned to its lofty status in my heart.  Some people apparantly liked the alternate ending Better though, so you'll have to make up your own mind on whether you personally want to check it out)  The ending also leaves room for a sequel, but they would probably need to go Really big budget if they want to really explore the entirety of that iceberg.  Maybe a novelized sequel by a skilled author instead if they can't afford to do the follow-up right?  Sequel or none, this movie is a great one, a good 8.5 or 9 out of ten.

I agree with some of the others that the alternate ending would have made it a little more interesting - kind of a ""was it real or not?"" ending - versus the ""Yes, it WAS real.""  Though like I said, the original ending is pretty cool too.Problem with the movie is everything leading up TO the ending.  The lead actress is the most boring I've ever endured.  Good horror films need STRONG female leads!  She's simply there.The ""off-the-characters-one-at-a-time"" proceedings are routine and mundane - eliciting more sighs than screams.

Below are my hits and misses with this tidy little horror film.The Hits:1) The film is very well acted, especially by some newcomers to film.2) It is intelligently written and keys in on themes and issues that many can relate to in their own lives.3) The direction is confident, but not intrusive.  One gets the impression that he knows exactly where he is going (even when he doesn't --consider the alternate ending that I personally like better than the theatrical one).4) This film is appropriately creepy and atmospheric and I always prefer those films over the more in-your-face horror gems (that are great in their own right).The Misses:1) A few overly slow periods.2) Some aspects of the film we have seen too often, such as the whole thing under the bed or in the closet idea as used inBoogeymanor the dead trying to punch a hole into our world as inPulse.3) The decision by the director to go with an ending from another movie and not the one originally intended and listed as the ""Alternate Ending"" on the DVD was, in my view, a huge error.  I thought this well-crafted film would have done better with a more original ending and not one rather shamelessly copied from another film.  I think most will be very satisfied with the ending and even consider it appropriate, but I prefer a bit more originality and found the ending predictable and disappointing.Overall, this is a truly excellent ""little"" film that deserves more recognition.  It is worth owning, but it may not have great repeat value once you really know the storyline.  It's the kind of film you may watch every once in a blue moon when you forget enough of the details.****Spoiler Alert****  Don't read if you want to have a surprise ending***In reference to #3 under ""Misses,"" the ending is far too similar to Carpenter's ending to hisPrince Of Darkness.  In that film, the heroine goes through a mirror and can't return, but sees the outside world; in this film, it's the closet acting as the mirror.

And now that they're attractive twentysomthing adults, these demons return to kidnap them to their dimension.The main downside of THEY is that it feels small.  A sparse cast with few locations or extras.  Not much happens until the end, which packs a powerful punch.  But for that brief and ominous ending, I'd give this film two stars.Many scenes are derivative, though I suppose that's hard to avoid after a while.  The country road where the woman's car breaks down reminded me of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES.  The freight elevator reminded me of THE RING.  The wake after the guy died reminded me of THE SIXTH SENSE.  The swimming pool scene reminded me of CAT PEOPLE and GOTHICA (the latter was released after THEY, but ironically had a better swimming pool scene).  The mirror-like extra-dimensional passage reminded me of PRINCE OF DARKNESS.Adding to THEY's smallness are the Canadian locations.  The story is set in Manhattan, but you only see a few barren streets that don't look anything like New York, partly because they're trying to hide the fact that THEY is shot in Canada.If you're going to shoot in Canada, set the story in Canada, like David Cronenberg did in the 1970s.  That way, you can take advantage of Canadian locales, and not have to ""dummy down"" the film by hiding locales.  Films shot ""on the sly"" in Canada invariably come off poorer for it (e.g., FEARDOT.COM and ISLAND OF THE DEAD -- the latter tried to hide the fact that Toronto looks nothing like Wall Street by filming Taliso Soto from an extreme low angle, so we only saw the tops of skyscrapers and no streets).Not that THEY even manages to hide its Canadian locales effectively.  The subway station plainly says ""Victory Square"" and the trains say UTA whereas in NY it's MTA (for Metropolitan Transportation Authority).  As one familiar with New York, these bloopers take me out of the film.I said this was a TV movie.  Maybe not, but it looks like a made-for-cable movie, so I'm guessing that's what it was.And it's short.  About an hour and 23 minutes (not including end credits).And you don't get a clear view of the demons, even at the end.  What you do see looks kinda slimy.  They're okay monsters, but nothing special.

Were you one of those people that could sit in it and find yourself fearless, knowing beyond knowing that there was nothing hiding within the shadows and that Mommy and Daddy God would dispel all forms of hardship? Or were you one of the people that knew something was awry and could perhaps hear something slipping through that silent void, scratching at the boards under your bed, slightly afraid and hopeful that you parent's were right when they said that there was nothing out there? Or perhaps you were one of the even more unlucky ones, hearing the nails of those spectral hands clawing through your closet while you sat huddling underneath the covers, knowing that ""they"" come for you at night?And what if that fear wasn't simply something of a childhood trauma playing out, but was something more sinister and far more real? What if those sounds had figures and they came back for you now?Within ""They,"" the ideas themselves are not original and the process of eliminating the characters is nothing that audiences haven't seen. All fans of the genre have heard these thoughts recycled over and over again, and all of those reprocessed affairs never seem to lead to new revelations on what being afraid truly amounts to.But the fear that is produced therein is effective nonetheless, not really needing to be something unique to allow one to shiver and fear the dark.By using a cascade of effects that let the shadows breathe just out of sight, you can see images that aren't quite images as they skulk into the ""real world"" in search of something that eludes their ""reality bound,"" docile prey. As the movie progresses, those shadows show more and more of what they are, too, and the beasts therein seem like something out the nightmarish Silent Hill 2 while culminating on other plateaus.As the onlooker, you find yourself sitting at a table with characters who peer into the shadows that you wouldn't want to look into, and you know that something is lurking there and that it is looking back.Honestly, it is a frightening affair in some places.Added to that are people that seem like people, with lives that try to mingle in the world of absolutes but that find themselves disassociated as the themes progress. From the initial blows landed, with the shock causing little reality waves to the worlds awash in nightmares, you find yourself watching faces that find themselves thrust into a world where they are, in so many ways, lost and looked at as crazy.This leads to some moments that are a little odd and disconnected, but that are nonetheless interesting to watch because the disintegration of lives as monstrosities terrorize them is oftentimes beyond the mundane.The one complaint I would voice is that some people jump into the pool of thought from far left field, leaving you to feel like you've missed something at first. Things do come around and are explained, mind you, but that initial confusion is something that I've never liked breeding in my mind.Still, if you like your shadows with claws, the darkness with an agenda, and your endings unhappy, then the flaws are easily overlooked. Little kids being taken and marked, disappearing into the night, isn't something you get from a genre that has become infested with ""let the little boy go"" mentalities too often in this PC world of demise.

In short, that's all you can find in the story, and the rest of the film is about hapless characters who are 'marked' for death.  And forget about 'Wes Craven' part.  What does this 'presents' mean anyway in 'Wes Craven presents'?Horror fans must remember the name of the director of 'They': Robert Harmon.  He was behind the camera in Rutger Hauer thriller 'The Hitcher' in 1986.  For 'They' FOCUS FEATURES (the indie company of '21 grams') assembled the following cast -- Laura Regan, Marc Blucas, Ethan Embry, Dagmara Dominczyk.  And 'They' are coming to them (except one).Legan is Julia, graduate student of psychology, with a boyfriend.  On a rainy day (like that of 'Se7en') she receives a call from her old friend Billy, who almost demented warns her: beware the darkness, for they are coming.The film goes on at the plodding pace at first, though Rene Ohashi's brooding photography is one great merit.  The scares are not all effective, all too predictable, and the story itself is not an original one (see for example 'Darkness Falls' and Anna Paquin's 'Darkness'), and the ideas are mostly borrowed ones.But when 'They' are really coming to her and others (and this hardly visible 'They' designed by Patrick Tatopoulos), the film gradually becomes better, with quite thrilling (if slightly illogical) sequences (in a swimming pool and a subway tunnel) that builds up to the striking ending.  Though the weak opening is never to be recovered, the last chapter is a minor triumph.The problems are twofold: one is that, as I said, the film  takes too much time to reach the very well-made set-pieces.  And the other is that the acting is mostly below average.  You might hate me for saying this, but Laura Legan is not ready for the leading lady's role yet.Don't expect the fast-paced thriller, or the steady flow of scary scenes with which you might associate the name of Craven, the master of horrors.  It is more atomospheric, and perhaps with a better luck, after. like 10 years, 'They' might be recognized as cult horror.

601182,A2YS8G30VYUN6C,B00005JLHF,"W. Russell ""warussl""","[5, 6]","I admit I was pulled in by the ""Wes Craven Presents"" moniker, so I expected at least a fairly scary movie.  What I got was a story with mild frights, tension, and a terrible ending.  The bad thing is there is an alternate ending on the disc that was much better than the original and would have greatly improved the overall movie (more on this later).  The general plot involves ""night terrors""; those things in the closet that scare us as a kid.  As this story goes, ""They"" really exist and come back for us when we grow up.  A young psychology student (Laura Regan) witnesses the suicide of her friend who has become so frightened that ""They"" will find him, that he takes his own life.  She later learns that her and two friends were taken as kids and marked so ""They"" can find them as adults, and take them back to their world.  In fact, we witness the abduction of the suicide victim in the opening scene of the film.  Early on, the movie relies on mood and what we don't see to scare us.  Later, we are shown the CGI generated creatures.As I mentioned, the disc contains an alternate ending to the film.  Had this ending been used, many of the stories inconsistencies would have been cleared up.  I suspect the writers/director filmed the movie with one thing in mind, but shot the ending that ended up on the film due to the reaction of a test audience.  That's a shame because with the alternate ending, the film would have had more of a ""Wes Craven"" feel.  Some films are ruined by the ending and this is particularly true for a B-Grade horror flick.The widescreen picture is sharp and clear.  The Dolby 5.1 is not overly utilized, but handles the creature noises well.  Other than the alternate ending, there are no other extras on the disc.  Not that this movie warrants a lot of extras, but the price of the disc is fairly high for such a bare bones offering.  I would have like to hear the director's reason for changing the ending.  If you are a die hard fan of modern horror, there are many other titles that I would recommend before this one.

It seemed that the casting was way off(I would've used the main character from ""May"")and the script is filled with useless dialogue. A lot of the lines do nothing to further the story or define the characters. The overall feel of the movie was dull and un-interesting. It was a pretty big let-down. For movies of the same genre, see ""Boogeyman"", or ""Alone in the Dark""(both of which have the same premise, but both are more fun to watch).If you enjoy Wes Craven's work, watch this and form your own opinion, but you might want to pass this up.",3,"""They"" come for you in the dark.....",1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,583,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'watching', 'one', 'seemed', 'casting', 'was', 'way', 'would', ""'ve"", 'used', 'main', 'character', 'May', 'script', 'filled', 'useless', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'lines', 'do', 'nothing', 'further', 'story', 'define', 'characters', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'dull', 'un-interesting', 'was', 'pretty', 'big', 'let-down', 'movies', 'same', 'genre', 'see', 'Boogeyman', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'have', 'same', 'premise', 'are', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'work', 'watch', 'form', 'own', 'opinion', 'might', 'want', 'pass', 'up']",They
