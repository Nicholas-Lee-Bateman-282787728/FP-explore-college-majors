I also liked how close he was to his mother. The moments he spent with her were the best parts of this film. And everything going on with his father - those moments taught lessons of forgiveness and second chances.Some characters talked about sex as if it was the solution to every problem. It is not. And having sex simply for physical pleasure is not love-making. It is meaningless. I was especially glad to see Curtis' growth in this area.
