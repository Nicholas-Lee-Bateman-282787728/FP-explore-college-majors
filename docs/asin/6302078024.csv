294222,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302078024,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Man Who Never Was, 1956 filmThe movie starts with a body on the beach, carried in by the tide. The Allies could land at a number of places. Can they misinform the enemy so their defense of Sicily is weakened? Lt. Commander Ewan Montagu must come up with a plan to fool the enemy. &#8220;The simpler the better.&#8221; We see life in wartime London. They meet Sir Bernard Spilsbury to talk about medical facts. Someone who died of pneumonia would have water in their lungs, like a drowned person. The body could be preserved with dry ice in a container. Operation Mincemeat is approved and critiqued. Montagu answers the questions. The Prime Minister approves the plan, cutting through red tape. They find a body that will serve their needs. The father asks that his son&#8217;s body will be respected and given a Christian burial &#8220;Yes.&#8221;It will be a great thing for England (but the man was a Scotsman). &#8220;Major William Martin&#8221; will be given papers to authenticate his identity. Pam will write a letter. [Would sea water wash out any ink?] Pam&#8217;s friend Lucy uses her personal experience to compose this letter. We see the other documents used to authenticate Major Martin. [Isn&#8217;t it difficult to dress a dead body?] The noise of bombs exploding adds tension to this drama. [Is that the right skin color for a dead Caucasian?] Next the &#8220;Optical Instruments&#8221; are delivered to a submarine. Will the Major have a successful journey? [Shouldn&#8217;t there have been a loss of an airplane to explain the disappearance of the Major?] The round case is delivered top side. A rubber dinghy is launched, next the Major. A short burial service is recited. [What happens to that case?]A carrier pigeon is released to carry the results. [It can&#8217;t be intercepted and decoded, or traced by radio finders.] The body washes up on shore, a poor fisherman calls the authorities. A Spanish Naval Officer takes the briefcase. A man informs the British Embassy, an official asks for the briefcase. &#8220;The Major has arrived.&#8221; The body is buried with honors, the papers are returned. Were those envelopes opened? A scientist in a lab coat tests the envelopes. &#8220;It was opened by somebody who knows what he was doing.&#8221; But one German officer has doubts, they will send an agent to London. Mr. Riley arrives to verify Martin&#8217;s past. A taxi takes him to a location. [This tells about life then, such as &#8220;blackout curtains&#8221;.] Riley&#8217;s suitcase has unusual items! Riley goes to Gieves for khaki shirts, then asks for information at the Navy Club.&#8220;Mr. Phillips: calls a bank for information; they make an afternoon appointment. Is he suspicious? Montagu visits Scotland Yard for help. Will &#8220;Phillips&#8221; show up? Riley looks for the girlfriend at her home address. Lucy gets bad news. Riley gives his address to Pam. Lucy arrives and talks about her dead boyfriend. Riley leaves after giving his address to Pam; she makes a telephone call. Riley sends a radio message; if he is still free in an hour then Martin existed. [Would a real spy do that?] Montagu surmises Riley&#8217;s plan and explains it to the General. They will not arrest Riley, even if he leaves the country. Riley sends the message &#8220;Martin genuine&#8221;. The enemy moves some of its forces away from Sicily. After the war Montagu visits Martin&#8217;s grave. [Note the walled vaults in that country.]This war movie that has little action, only intellectual activity.

294223,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,6302078024,Andres C. Salama,"[2, 2]","Handsome movie, made in the 1950s, about Operation Mincemeat, the successful deception plan concocted by the British during World War II to send a corpse to the Mediterranean with false invasion plans. The Germans swallowed it whole, and left Sicilia (where the invasion finally took place) relatively unguarded.Made by Hollywood with relatively unknown actors, this film is very entertaining, even if some of the things here turned out not to be true, though this was probably not the fault of the filmmakers. For instance, the corpse that was used in the operation belonged to a Welshman instead of a Scot (an alcoholic tramp, in actuality), and his family was not notified. And the last half hour deals with the story of an Irish spy in London working for the Germans that, while entertaining, is pure invention.More a spy film than a war film, it can be compared, as some of the commenters have noted, to some of the best movies by Alfred Hitchcock, in the way the film builds suspense over the operation. The beautiful color photography is an enormous plus; since this was filmed just a decade after the conflict ended, this allows you to have a very good idea of what London must have looked like during the war in full colors. Some might find the patriotism in the film a bit old fashioned, but I found it refreshing in comparison with the constant cynicism and weariness of contemporary movies.",5,"Solid, entertaining WW2 film based on real events",1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,1402,"['Handsome', 'movie', 'made', '1950s', 'Operation', 'Mincemeat', 'successful', 'deception', 'plan', 'concocted', 'British', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'send', 'corpse', 'Mediterranean', 'false', 'invasion', 'plans', 'Germans', 'swallowed', 'whole', 'left', 'Sicilia', 'where', 'invasion', 'finally', 'took', 'place', 'relatively', 'unguarded.Made', 'Hollywood', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actors', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'even', 'things', 'here', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'fault', 'filmmakers', 'instance', 'corpse', 'was', 'used', 'operation', 'belonged', 'Welshman', 'instead', 'Scot', 'alcoholic', 'tramp', 'actuality', 'family', 'was', 'not', 'notified', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'deals', 'story', 'Irish', 'spy', 'London', 'working', 'Germans', 'entertaining', 'pure', 'spy', 'film', 'war', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'commenters', 'have', 'noted', 'best', 'movies', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'way', 'film', 'builds', 'suspense', 'operation', 'beautiful', 'color', 'photography', 'enormous', 'plus', 'was', 'filmed', 'just', 'decade', 'conflict', 'ended', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'London', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'war', 'full', 'colors', 'might', 'find', 'patriotism', 'film', 'bit', 'old', 'fashioned', 'found', 'refreshing', 'comparison', 'constant', 'cynicism', 'weariness', 'contemporary', 'movies']",Man Who Never Was VHS
294224,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302078024,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","A few years ago I read the book `Body of Lies' (which isn't very good) and it opens with the idea of planting false evidence on a dead body and leaving it for war enemies to find and I found that fascinating.  I only wished that the rest of the book was as inspired and compellingly written.Well, `The Man Who Never Was' is compelling, from start to finish, and delivers on that very intriguing premise with marvelous results.  The film plays out almost like two films played back to back, interweaving two sets of engaging scenarios that are connected and yet feel unique and set apart on their own.  In the film's first half we have the American government planning an attack on Sicily during World War II.  In an attempt to divert attention away from their plan, they decide to plant contradictory evidence on a dead man passed off as a soldier and wash him ashore on enemy soil.  Just when it appears that the film has nowhere else to go and we're only an hour in, we get the second half, which follows an enemy spy collecting information to prove the reality of the body found.  Was this man genuine, or was it a trick?  The intensity rises in this second half as the audience is left wondering if this spy will uncover the truth.The film is expertly written and acted by the entire cast, but it is the supporting roles that really anchor this film.  Steven Boyd (in one of his first roles) is devilishly good as the evil spy, but it is Gloria Grahame who makes the most of every moment in her supporting role as a young woman who falls in love with a doomed fighter pilot.  Her drunk scene is HOW YOU GET IT DONE, and she leaves a very lasting impression.This is one of the better war movies of the time (there were a lot of them) and sadly one that many people probably have never heard of.",5,The film no one ever saw...,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1797,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'read', 'book', 'Body', 'Lies', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'planting', 'false', 'evidence', 'dead', 'body', 'leaving', 'war', 'enemies', 'find', 'found', 'fascinating', 'only', 'wished', 'rest', 'book', 'was', 'inspired', 'compellingly', 'written.Well', 'Man', 'Who', 'Never', 'Was', 'compelling', 'start', 'finish', 'delivers', 'very', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'marvelous', 'results', 'film', 'out', 'almost', 'two', 'films', 'played', 'back', 'back', 'interweaving', 'two', 'sets', 'engaging', 'scenarios', 'are', 'connected', 'yet', 'feel', 'unique', 'set', 'apart', 'own', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'have', 'American', 'government', 'planning', 'attack', 'Sicily', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'attempt', 'divert', 'attention', 'away', 'plan', 'decide', 'plant', 'contradictory', 'evidence', 'dead', 'man', 'passed', 'off', 'soldier', 'wash', 'ashore', 'enemy', 'soil', 'Just', 'when', 'film', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', ""'re"", 'only', 'hour', 'get', 'second', 'half', 'enemy', 'spy', 'collecting', 'information', 'prove', 'reality', 'body', 'found', 'Was', 'man', 'genuine', 'was', 'trick', 'intensity', 'second', 'half', 'audience', 'left', 'wondering', 'spy', 'will', 'uncover', 'truth.The', 'film', 'expertly', 'written', 'acted', 'entire', 'cast', 'supporting', 'roles', 'really', 'film', 'Steven', 'Boyd', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'devilishly', 'good', 'evil', 'spy', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'who', 'most', 'moment', 'supporting', 'role', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'doomed', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'drunk', 'scene', 'HOW', 'YOU', 'GET', 'IT', 'DONE', 'very', 'lasting', 'impression.This', 'one', 'better', 'war', 'movies', 'time', 'were', 'lot', 'sadly', 'one', 'many', 'people', 'probably', 'have', 'never', 'heard']",Man Who Never Was VHS

However different people are get credit the different actions and thoughts than in the book.The first half of the movie is about solving a problem of how to make the Germans in 1943 think that the invasion will take place in Portugal instead of in Sicily. If they can move just one gun or a troop they can save lives. The solution is described as barbaric and unique.The second half of the movie is to keep the Germans from finding out the deception. They have gone trough elaborate efforts to manufacture a false identity for a currier. The Germans are interested if him and send in a spy (Steven Boyd) to find out his past.One of the most telling scenes is while there are preparing the deception and are in a bunker you hear the bombs and screams that remind you of the urgency and purpose of the movie.Clifton Webb is Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu, the person that the movie evolves around. Gloria Grahame plays Lucy Sherwood, an alleged girlfriend. The reason she shines is that they put a lot of grease on her face and it shines in the dark.If you saw Ben-Hur then you may recognize Messala (Steven Boyd) as the spy sent to be sure that Martin is genuine.And if you are an Agatha Christie Miss Marple fan you will see that Joan Hickson is the apartment owner.It is a great story and well told.

294237,A2XHRW7XBKEQ31,6302078024,CitizenChampion,"[0, 1]","This particular Motion Picture shares distinction with the very ordinary and the very suspensefull.It is a story that I have viewed more than once because this time consuming effort required to produce one Major William Martin of the Royal Marines was worth watching more than once.As everybody belongs to somebody,""The Man Who Never Was"" provided such a success story that ""Operation Mincemeat"" was the code named operation with which Major William Martin of the Royal Marines helped to persuade Nazi German Officials that the documents found on Major Martins Body were to be believed.It appears as if German forces responded to this proposed threat of an invasion coming from Greece rather than Sicily thereby relocating some percentage of there forces in Italy to Greece.This had the desired affect of lowering the overall ability that could be offered by German forces when the Invasion of Sicily commenced.The film produces some tedious if a bit overstated positions as would be if we can re-locate just one battery.The tediousness of such positioning may of in fact been un-necesary as there was a loss of dramatic story telling ability as a result.Both Ewen Montagu(played by Clifton Webb) and an assistant played by Robert Fleming moved with deligence towards this films overall story.These very same offices whereby much of the intelligence discussions occurred were the very same offices that Ian Fleming was attached to.This is mentioned as both attention to detail could be overstated and otherwise as commonplace occurences. There were two women,one played Ewen Montagu's Secretary(Josephine Griffin) and the other(women) was a librarian(Gloria Grahame), the two women lived together.It can not be stated enough that these two women were instrumental in making this film work.Excellent performances as both clever and intelligent theater was very interesting to watch unfold.When these women were on their own in the presence of Nazi German Agent O'Reilly(played by Steven Boyd) there dramatic storytelling ability was pretty darn good.This film had that about it that as the film progressed it became more and more suspenseful.It seems further that the war had taken a toll which the feminine psyche had some problems with,however it was not only the feminine psyche that had a problem with the toll the war was taking.It had the desired effect of convincing an otherwise wiser man in The German Agent played by Stephan Boyd.A matter perhaps worth mentioning is that both the German Agent(played by Stephan Boyd)and the unidentified ""Man Who Never Was"" were claimed to be Scottish.A understated complaint was made to Ewen Montagu(played by Clifton Webb) by the father to this particular individual(the unidentified ""Man Who Never Was"")that they were Scottish and proud of it.Scotland was as well a Neutral Nation during World War II and should not  necessarily be considered part of the United Kingdom.Politics is here mentioned as a understated strain in Scotlands relationship with Great Britain.These moments did as it were add up,they added up to credible storytelling .I'am not so easily convinced however the scene occurring which convinced me that German Agent O'Reilly was a wiser man then we were lead to believe occurred in the officers club as he actually expressed a sincere ability that I paid attention to.I do not know if in fact German agents were so skilled but it might very well un-nerve some very resolute fellows when confronted by such sincerity.I'am reminded of a number of 00 accounts whereby Agents were to lose their lives as a result.The particular offices that were involved were in fact associated with and almost exclusively dealt with the double 00 field agent. Ewen Montagu was himself a 00 field agent with there command centralized out of office 39.This effort had people like Ian Flemming attached to its operations.This was a very real War time effort.""Operation Mincemeat""was also part of a larger operation.We do not know these things as such but perhaps it is well and good that such things are more properly handled than being the province of hucksters of a sort.This film had that degree of involvement whereby the success or failure of one particular item could doom the believability of Major William Martin of the Royal Marines.This particular mention was worth considering as there was a difference between a Motion Picture and the reality of this war time account of ""Operation Mincemeat"".This was as it were a good try.I wish to remind the reader that ""Operation Mincemeat"" was not a well made Motion Picture,it was a real time War Operations plan conducted in 1943.The very detail offerred here was not the detail that was offerred in reality.There are to be certain differences as things may actually have happened and the things that are portrayed in ""The Man Who Never Was"".There was a story told elsewhere as it involved Irwin Rommel's ""Africa Corp"".A blown up jeep with a dead soldier behind the wheel had on his person papers that showed a way around a mine field.Rommel's forces discovered the documents and a while later were found to be bogged down in quick sand like desert.There was a-lot at stake with this undertaking both as it were on film and most certainly when it counted.The Film portrays Ewen Montagu in Civilian clothes.He goes to the grave site of Major William Martin and places a Medal,a Medal that Montagu has been awarded upon a  wreath which adorns the grave of Major William Martin.It may very well be suggested that such a scene was all the more appropiate given the importance of the life of Major William Martin. ""The Man Who Never Was"" was as a result of real effort.This film was that to me both a real effort and worth as it were in mentioning the films opening narrative,""Last Night I Dreamed A Deadly Dream Beyond the Irish Sky.I saw a Dead Man win the fight and I think that Dead Man was I"".",5,Last Night I Dreamed A Deadly Dream Beyond The Irish Sky.I saw a Dead Man win the fight and I think the

294239,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302078024,C. O. DeRiemer,"[4, 5]","In the Fifties Britain produced a number of well made WWII movies that recaptured the valor and victories of British arms. The war was past and the civilian deprivations that had lasted well after the war were going away. It was time to celebrate what Britain had accomplished. The Man Who Never Was is among these movies. It tells the true story of Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montague (Clifton Webb), a barrister who now is in Naval Intelligence, who has been charged to come up with a scheme that will convince the Germans that the Allies will not mount a major effort to invade Sicily. His solution is named Operation Mincemeat, and involves using a body as a decoy. I won't go into the details because the fun is in seeing just how Montague and his small staff, an aide and a secretary, go about it. But having accomplished their assignment, they are faced with the likelihood that the Germans will try hard to verify what they are being led to believe. The second half of the movie is a tight little drama where Montague has to outwit an Irishman who has become a German agent.Webb is quite effective playing Montague. There's almost none of the prissiness he brought to most of his roles. He's quiet, determined and smarter than many around him. He has a sharp tongue but seldom shows impatience. It's a nice job. Gloria Grahame plays a young woman who provides an important piece of evidence establishing the body's history, and then unknowingly faces the Irish agent.In my view, this is a very watchable film that keeps moving at a good pace. Ronald Neame was an experienced, effective director who knew what he was doing. Two of his best films and well worth watching are The Horse's Mouth and Tunes of Glory.And for those who appreciate a stiff upper lip and immaculate British manners, here are some of those Fifties WWII movies to track down: The Colditz Story, Ice Cold in Alex, The Battle of the River Platte, Ill Met by Moonlight, I Was Monty's Double, Above Us the Waves, The Cruel Sea.

Patton being in charge of a fake army to the use of double agents. The allies were able to keep vital German panzer tanks and troops away from the Normandy beaches as Hitler kept his attention on the Calais region.Yet even before this British intelligence scored another coup by diverting German attention away from the imminent invasion of Sicily by making the Germans believe that Greece and perhaps Sardinia were the actual targets.They did this by creating the man who never was. Taking the body of a man whose condition could be interpreted as having died from drowning, dressing him in clothes with accompanying documentation and casting him off from a submarine just off the coast of Spain. All with the goal that the body and the vital top secrets it carried being intercepted by the Nazi's.It was an inspired scheme and this movie, in much the same vein as the similar true-life deception movie I WAS MONTY'S DOUBLE really shines.

294245,A29VKODW4R5U7W,6302078024,dooby,"[69, 70]","This is a fine movie of wartime espionage, disinformation and deception. Based on the book by Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montagu, it tells of British Naval Intelligence's attempt to deceive the Germans about the planned 1943 invasion of Sicily. Trying to draw as many German troops away from Sicily as possible, they concocted a plan to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain, with papers purportedly from Allied High Command indicating that the invasion would go by way of Greece or Sardinia instead of Sicily. The subterfuge succeeded. The Germans embarked on a massive build up of defences around Sardinia and the Greek Peloponnesus, thinning out their defences on Sicily. The hoax affected not only the Sicilian offensive but had effects across the entire European theater. Hitler swallowed it whole. Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was sent to personally supervise the defence of Greece. The 1st Panzer Division was withdrawn from France. Two other Panzer divisions were withdrawn from the Russian front just when they were needed at the crucial Battle of Kursk. Operation Mincemeat, as it was called, was one of the most ingenious and successful hoaxes perpertrated by the Allies during the Second World War.This is a war movie with little battlefront action. It concentrates on the quiet background work of the Intelligence Service. The first half of the movie deals with the hatching of the plan, the procurement of the dead body, the faking of the dead man's history and the drawing up of his elaborate cover story. The fictional officer is christened ""Major William Martin"" of The Royal Marines. The second half starts when the Germans fall for the ruse and send a spy over to England to check out its veracity. There follows a cat and mouse game as the British try to tie up loose ends and fill in the fake history they have put together for the dead man, including his purported girlfriend. The movie is always absorbing, often rivetingly so. It is one of the few WW2 espionage films that have stood the test of time. The fact that it was a true story makes it doubly interesting.Fox have released a barebones edition of the film on DVD. It contains both the widescreen version in its original 2.55:1 Cinemascope (enhanced for widescreen TV) and a fullscreen pan-&-scan version. The widescreen version strangely is placed on the unmarked flipside of the double-sided DVD. Picture quality is fine, very good in fact if you consider this film dates from 1955. There is very little dirt, speckling or any print damage. Colors are strong and bright. Skintones look natural. Black levels are well rendered. The pan-&-scan version version looks terrible in comparison, with a claustrophobic, darker image, heavier grain and a softer picture overall. Sound is available in the original English 2.0 mono, a 4.0 Surround remix as well as alternate Spanish and French 2.0 mono tracks. A single theatrical trailer is all that's included. A fine memento of wartime subterfuge and deception with solid acting and direction from a time when there was still a viable British Film Industry.Note: The grave at Huelva, on the southern coast of Spain still bears the name ""Major William Martin"". The real identity of the dead man was kept secret for over 50 years. It was only in 1996 that he was finally identified as a homeless alcoholic Welshman. Today, across the bottom of the white marble tombstone is an added epitaph, finally revealing his identity, ""Glyndwr Michael served as Major William Martin"".",4,Fine account of elaborate wartime hoax...

294246,A2TXR85WQLE32N,6302078024,D. S. Thurlow,"[3, 3]","""The Man Who Never Was"" is a nicely-done movie dramatization derived from the book of the same name by former British Intelligence Officer Ewan Montagu.  Montagu (played in the movie by Clifton Webb) was tasked in 1943 to divert German forces from the defense of Sicily, the next Allied objective.  Montagu and his team came up with the disturbing but unique idea of planting false papers on a dead body disguised as an Allied officer, then allowing the body to wash ashore in Fascist Spain in the hopes that the information would be passed to the Germans.The first two thirds of the movie follows the efforts of Montagu's team to find a suitable body and prepare its legend as one Major William Martin, Royal Marines, carrying letters to high officers in the Mediterranean Theater.  Amid the disruptions of blitz-torn London, the team deals with details such as procuring a special canister in which the body can be placed, packed in dry ice, for movement by submarine to the Spanish coast. The team invents a girlfriend for the young officer; a roommate (played by Gloria Grahame) of Montagu's secretary obligingly writes the love letters that the dead Martin will carry with him.This operation, codenamed MINCEMEAT, was a high-risk venture in that there was no assurance that the body would wash ashore, that the materials would be passed to the Germans, or that the Germans would consider the documents credible.  In the actual event, the success of the deception was not truly apparent until after the war.  The last third of the movie fills this dramatic gap by having a fictional Irishman spying for the Germans (played by Stephen Boyd) check on Martin's bonafides in London.  The team finds out about the spy late in the game and must persuade British Internal Security not to arrest him.  An emotionally-charged meeting with the roommate, grieving over the loss of her real boyfriend, turns out to be the key to the spy's mission.This movie is highly recommended as an entertaining and dramatic tale of wartime guile and cunning, based for the most part on a real life event.",4,Guile and Cunning...,1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,2084,"['Man', 'Who', 'Never', 'Was', 'nicely-done', 'movie', 'dramatization', 'derived', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'former', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'Officer', 'Ewan', 'Montagu', 'Montagu', 'played', 'movie', 'Clifton', 'Webb', 'was', 'tasked', '1943', 'divert', 'German', 'forces', 'defense', 'Sicily', 'next', 'Allied', 'objective', 'Montagu', 'team', 'came', 'up', 'disturbing', 'unique', 'idea', 'planting', 'false', 'papers', 'dead', 'body', 'disguised', 'Allied', 'officer', 'then', 'allowing', 'body', 'wash', 'ashore', 'Fascist', 'Spain', 'hopes', 'information', 'would', 'be', 'passed', 'Germans.The', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'efforts', 'Montagu', 'team', 'find', 'suitable', 'body', 'prepare', 'legend', 'one', 'Major', 'William', 'Martin', 'Royal', 'Marines', 'carrying', 'letters', 'high', 'officers', 'Mediterranean', 'Theater', 'Amid', 'disruptions', 'blitz-torn', 'London', 'team', 'deals', 'details', 'such', 'procuring', 'special', 'canister', 'body', 'can', 'be', 'placed', 'packed', 'dry', 'ice', 'movement', 'submarine', 'Spanish', 'coast', 'team', 'girlfriend', 'young', 'officer', 'roommate', 'played', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'Montagu', 'secretary', 'obligingly', 'love', 'letters', 'dead', 'Martin', 'will', 'carry', 'him.This', 'operation', 'codenamed', 'MINCEMEAT', 'was', 'high-risk', 'venture', 'was', 'assurance', 'body', 'would', 'wash', 'ashore', 'materials', 'would', 'be', 'passed', 'Germans', 'Germans', 'would', 'consider', 'documents', 'credible', 'actual', 'event', 'success', 'deception', 'was', 'not', 'truly', 'apparent', 'war', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'gap', 'having', 'fictional', 'Irishman', 'spying', 'Germans', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'check', 'Martin', 'bonafides', 'London', 'team', 'out', 'spy', 'late', 'game', 'must', 'persuade', 'British', 'Internal', 'Security', 'not', 'arrest', 'emotionally-charged', 'meeting', 'roommate', 'grieving', 'loss', 'real', 'boyfriend', 'out', 'be', 'key', 'spy', 'mission.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'entertaining', 'dramatic', 'tale', 'wartime', 'guile', 'cunning', 'based', 'most', 'part', 'real', 'life', 'event']",Man Who Never Was VHS

Taylor ""GFT""","[6, 6]","In 1942 Allied powers greatly desired to invade Sicily--a fact of which Axis powers were well aware and against which the island was greatly fortified.  In an effort to trick the Nazi military, British intelligence agents Flight Lt. Charles Cholmondeley and Lt. Commander Ewen Montagu came up with a clever plan: a body, bearing papers indicating that the major Allied attack would come elsewhere, was floated in to Spanish waters.  Although technically neutral, Spain was sympathetic to the Nazis, and with any luck the papers would be thought genuine and reach German hands.Although top secret even after the war, a good story is hard to keep down, and after numerous leaks Montagu himself was allowed to write an account of the deception.  Titled THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS, the book was an overnight bestseller and the 1956 film version proved very popular as well.  In retelling the story on the screen, writer Nigel Balchin took a number of liberties with the story, most particularly in the creation of ""Lucy Sherwood"" (Gloria Graham), a character who exists largely in order to provide a touch of love and pathos; even so, the film is very accurate in terms of the operation itself and how it was carried out.Clifton Webb is perhaps best recalled for his waspish roles in such celebrated films as LAURA, but he sets aside his mannerisms for the role of Montagu and drives the action of the film in a remarkably capable manner, well supported by Robert Flemyng as assistant Lt. George Acres (based on Charles Cholmondeley) and Josephine Griffin as Pam, his secretary.  Stephen Boyd does well in the Irish-accented role of Nazi agent Patrick O'Reilly, a semi-fictional character, and Gloria Graham, always a memorable performer, scores heavily in the role of Lucy Sherwood.he film is essentially about process--finding the right body, planting the papers, arranging for the body to be transported, and so on--and as such it moves a fast clip, with director Ronald Neame (an Oscar-winning screenwriter perhaps best now known as director of such films as I COULD GO ON SINGING, THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE, and THE POSEIDON AVENTURE) keeping everything moving at a good clip.  The DVD offers excellent picture and sound, as well as the choice between wide screen and full screen.  If you know nothing about Operation Mincemeat, you'll find it fascinating stuff--and if you do know about Operation Mincemeat you'll still find the film entertaining on its own.

This has prodded its militaryplanners to think in unconventional terms in strikingat its enemies.  This means using its naval forces tomove stealthily around its continental enemiesusing naval forces  and to try to use deceptionto get the enemy off guard, rather than confrontingthem head on.  The failed First World War operation at Gallipoli wasa good example of this, trying to strike at Germany""through the back door"", rather than just head onin the blood-soaked trenches of Flanders on theWestern Front.In the Second World War, all the British leaders  andsenior officershad been traumatized by the slaughter of theFirst World War and were desperate to come up withways of avoiding a replay.  Thus, in 1943, after NorthAfrica had been cleared of Axis forces, the Britishmilitary leaders sought a way to distract the Germansfrom the obvious next target, which was Sicily.The result was deception of ""Operation Mincemeat"" which is portrayedin this excellent film. The film is based on EwenMontagu's book ""The Man Who Never Was"".  This filmis of a long-lost genre of films which are rivetingin spite of the fact that they don't have any ""action"",(i.e. shoot-outs, fist fights, car chases, etc), like another of my favorites ""Twelve Angry Men"".A close observation of the film shows, beside the mainstory, a lot of other information showing what wartimeBritain was like, such as how London became run-downand grimy during the long years of bombing and austerity,how the British learned to take the air raids in stride,the resignation to the on-going deaths of relatives andfriendsand the shortages of quality consumer goods. In addition,we see the manifestations of the traditionally tense relationship betweenBritain and Ireland as well as Scotland. For militarybuffs, there is a brief look at the legendary Mosquitofighter/bomber and the unsung British submarine force (ascompared to those of the United States and the GermanU-Boat force).One thing to keep in mind is that while Montagu makesno mention of German efforts to authenticate the existenceof ""Major Martin"", the film devotes a considerable partof its plot to that, which I assume is ""overdramatized""to keep the interest of the audience.  The film claimsthat the German (actually Irish) agent actually gets incontact with someone who had a part in the whole operation,and I doubt whether this is factual.

A deception was therefore needed to try to lure away some of the German defences. Inter-services ""XX Committee"" (XX for double-cross) members Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu, and Squadron Leader Sir Archibald Cholmondley hatched the then unheard of plan of planting a body in the sea off Spain where prevailing currents would surely carry it inshore to the Huelva region, known to be the territory of one of the Nazis' best Spanish agents. The body, dressed as a major in the Royal Marines and apparently killed in a plane crash at sea, would be carrying supposedly top secret documents aimed at convincing any reader that the invasion target was not Sicily at all, but Greece. Montagu himself plays a cameo role in the film as an Air Marshall.The film takes us through the planning and execution of what its creators hoped would become one of the most successful and unusual deceptions in the history of warfare. The leading role of Montagu is played by Clifton Webb, utterly credible as a British naval officer, while Robert Flemyng, who had himself served conspicuously in WWII and who was awarded the Military Cross and Order of The British Empire, takes on the role of Montagu's junior assistant, a composite role based partly on Cholmondley's real-life character. Together they must procure a body that will pass a medical examination to determine the cause of death and they must also create a personality and a past life and history for this man.This is a true-story that avoids battle scenes and big bangs. There are no special effects. It describes a war of stealth and cunning and the cat and mouse game of espionage. It is an atmospheric suspense thriller with Stephen Boyd effective as the determined Axis agent, Patrick O'Reilly, sent in from Ireland to verify the existence and past life of this man who never was. While the soundtrack is one of Alan Rawsthorne's (The Cruel Sea) better scores, it is nevertheless immediately recognizable as one of his compositions, unfortunately sounding so much like all his others. It is ably directed by the great and sometimes under-rated Ronald Neame. It is beautifully filmed, as are all of former-cameraman Neame's pictures. The voice of Churchill is provided by the young Peter Sellers who, at that time in 1956, was establishing his versatility and making a name for himself in the BBC radio comedy, ""The Goon Show"".20th Century Fox's DVD video and sound quality are excellent, as would be expected in the studio release of one of their own productions.

Commander Mantagu, whose mission is to create a diversion tactic to lure the Germans away from the real Italian location the British plan to invade. So he thinks of the most daring, sophisticated and simple plan of them all: to have a dead British officer carrying top secret information falling on the hands of the Germans. But the plan is not easy and every detail must be calculated with care as the Germans will know the information is too good, therefore, they will investigate the dead man's life in order to spot any fabrication.Most of the film revolves around the making of the ""the man"" - getting the right body, producing the documents, finding him a personal life, preserving him from decomposing... and launching him from a submarine into a beach in Spain where the sharpest German operator is certain to find him.Then it all becomes a psychological game as the British try to understand what response will come from the Germans. Did they buy it? Did they disregard him as an obvious lie? So the Germans send a top spy into Britain to investigate the life of such a valuable man - too valuable to be true.So this is NOT a spy film like most. It has no fight or combat scenes and most of the action is pretty much likeThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold- both films even share the same cinematographer. Put on top of it all the fact that this is a British film and you'll get all the elegance, pace and charm of the best WWII films.Also impressive is that this is a CinemaScope film made in 1955 with a gorgeous cinematography by Oswald Morris (Lolita,The Guns of Navarone,The Odessa FileandThe Man Who Would Be King).The DVD comes with two versions of the film (one on each side of the disc): the CinemaScope version and the unacceptable Pan&Scan; version that completely destroys the CinemaScope's beautiful frame composition.I admit that after having seen Clifton Webb on other films likeLauraandCheaper By the Dozen, I was afraid he would not look convincing as an Intelligence officer... but Clifton Webb was really an amazing actor and his portrayal of Lt.

It belongs to a tradition of English war films in which aspects of the war are treated slowly, deliberately, and with great precision.  While in the US war films tended to feature John Wayne leading Marines into combat, the British tended to focus much more on the preparation and plans of operations.  For instance, the very fine film THE DAM BUSTERS features very little in the way of actual combat.  And THE MAN WHO NEVER WAY has no combat whatsoever.The movie is based on a book by the same name about Operation Mincemeat, in which the British attempted to mislead the Germans about the intended invasion spot for D-Day by planting a corpse with fake papers on a beach in Spain, knowing that the Spanish would pass the papers onto the Germans.  The entire movie is involved with the formation of the plan, and then creating the man who never was, creating his papers and personal effects.  On one level, not much happens in the film, but on another it is one of the most fascinating films ever made about the war, because of the practical problems they deal with in the executing of the operation.  Knowing that it was all based upon real events greatly adds to the appeal of the film.Clifton Webb, who was in fact far too old for the part, turns in a convincing performance as Lieutenant Commander Montagu.  In most of his films he comes across as arrogant, but in this one he instead communicates competence and intelligence.  Gloria Grahame is excellent as the primary female presence in the film.

Commander Montagu, creator of the plan to send a carefully picked dead body, tricked out as a drowned English officer complete with personal artifacts and actual but untrue letters from and to top military leaders, to wash up on a specific Spanish coast where it was likely to fall into german hands.But when the Germans do get hold of the body, everything about it seems too good to be true and they send an Irish agent, a young and menacing Stephen Boyd, to England to authenticate the identity of ""William Martin.""The race is on with British intelligence scrambling to stay ahead of the game with the Nazi agent who has targeted the ""fiance"" of ""Martin.""Even though this film was made 50 years ago, period detail is impeccable.  The Cinemascope, ultra widescreen (aspect ration 2.55:1) composition is striking and there are no wasted scenes as the already taut, true story ratchets the tension in the last act.",4,CLASSIC WW II ESPIONAGE THRILLER -- AND IT'S TRUE,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,1574,"['MAN', 'WHO', 'NEVER', 'WAS', 'Fox', 'wide', 'view', 'deserted', 'Spanish', 'beach', '1943', 'body', 'washed', 'view', 'clipped', 'British', 'voice', 'intones', 'Last', 'Night', 'dreamed', 'deadly', 'dreamBeyond', 'Isle', 'Skye.I', 'saw', 'dead', 'man', 'win', 'fightAnd', 'think', 'man', 'was', 'So', 'classic', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'audacious', 'true', 'story', 'Major', 'William', 'Martin', 'name', 'made', 'up', 'true', 'identity', 'secret', 'even', 'death', 'Major', 'Martin', 'pulled', 'off', 'daring', 'deception', 'misled', 'Nazi', 'diverting', 'defenses', 'convinced', 'Allies', 'would', 'invade', 'Greece', 'perhaps', 'Sardinia', 'instead', 'Sicily.Clifton', 'Webb', 'Lt', 'Commander', 'Montagu', 'creator', 'plan', 'send', 'carefully', 'picked', 'dead', 'body', 'tricked', 'out', 'drowned', 'English', 'officer', 'complete', 'personal', 'artifacts', 'actual', 'untrue', 'letters', 'top', 'military', 'leaders', 'wash', 'up', 'specific', 'Spanish', 'coast', 'where', 'was', 'likely', 'fall', 'german', 'hands.But', 'when', 'Germans', 'do', 'get', 'hold', 'body', 'everything', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'send', 'Irish', 'agent', 'young', 'menacing', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'England', 'authenticate', 'identity', 'William', 'Martin', 'race', 'British', 'intelligence', 'scrambling', 'stay', 'ahead', 'game', 'Nazi', 'agent', 'who', 'targeted', 'fiance', 'Martin', 'Even', 'film', 'was', 'made', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'period', 'detail', 'impeccable', 'Cinemascope', 'ultra', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ration', '2.55:1', 'composition', 'striking', 'are', 'wasted', 'scenes', 'already', 'taut', 'true', 'story', 'tension', 'last', 'act']",Man Who Never Was VHS

294294,AK61LQI92GTCH,6302078024,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[7, 8]","The true story of the British attempt to lay some heavy disinformation on the Axis in World War II.  Clifton Webb plays Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montagu, the British naval commander who is both mastermind and chief promoter of The Plan, an elaborate concoction of forged papers, misleading faux orders, a convincing back story, and a suitable corpse meant to mislead the enemy about the Allied intentions prior to the invasion of Italy.  I don't suppose it's giving too much away to report that things more or less go as planned (although the suspicious Germans do send spy Stephen Boyd in to liven up the last third of the film.)  Even though this is indeed a war movie, bang-bang stuff, THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS practically wallows in minute details while eschewing the firefight and the foxhole.  That's not to say it doesn't have its share of situational suspense - are those depth charges going to sink the sub and scuttle the movie? - but detail is much preferred over violent action.Along with the likes of Monty Woolley, Webb more or less cornered the market on playing stuffy, condescending Englishmen. Here Webb's strength, a stiff and rather formal persona who needs a baby-sat seven-year-old to evoke his humanity, is put to good use.  There are no kids around and Webb doesn't unbend, but this movie doesn't care that much about the personal life of its characters, anyway, save for poor Gloria Grahame, who's given the rather thankless task of shedding some plot-directed tears and seems rather out of place for her troubles.Even though it's clinical and relatively bloodless - in every sense of the word - THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS is a great deal of fun.  Director Ronald Neame lovingly dwells on every step of the preparation, through to the execution of the caper, and has us deeply involved when the whole thing is threatened with the appearance of the Boyd character.  THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS is a fine, thoughtful film that should appeal to those who aren't necessarily great fans of action war movies.",5,A dead man goes to war,1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,2004,"['true', 'story', 'British', 'attempt', 'lay', 'heavy', 'disinformation', 'Axis', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Clifton', 'Webb', 'Lt.', 'Cmdr', 'Ewen', 'Montagu', 'British', 'naval', 'commander', 'who', 'mastermind', 'chief', 'promoter', 'Plan', 'elaborate', 'concoction', 'forged', 'papers', 'misleading', 'faux', 'orders', 'convincing', 'back', 'story', 'suitable', 'corpse', 'meant', 'mislead', 'enemy', 'Allied', 'intentions', 'prior', 'invasion', 'Italy', 'do', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'report', 'things', 'more', 'less', 'go', 'planned', 'suspicious', 'Germans', 'do', 'send', 'spy', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'liven', 'up', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'Even', 'indeed', 'war', 'movie', 'bang-bang', 'stuff', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'NEVER', 'WAS', 'practically', 'minute', 'details', 'eschewing', 'firefight', 'foxhole', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'have', 'share', 'situational', 'suspense', 'are', 'depth', 'charges', 'going', 'sink', 'sub', 'scuttle', 'movie', 'detail', 'much', 'preferred', 'violent', 'action.Along', 'likes', 'Monty', 'Woolley', 'Webb', 'more', 'less', 'cornered', 'market', 'playing', 'stuffy', 'condescending', 'Englishmen', 'Here', 'Webb', 'strength', 'stiff', 'rather', 'formal', 'persona', 'who', 'baby-sat', 'seven-year-old', 'evoke', 'humanity', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'are', 'kids', 'Webb', ""n't"", 'unbend', 'movie', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'personal', 'life', 'characters', 'anyway', 'save', 'poor', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'who', 'given', 'rather', 'thankless', 'task', 'shedding', 'plot-directed', 'tears', 'rather', 'place', 'troubles.Even', 'clinical', 'relatively', 'bloodless', 'sense', 'word', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'NEVER', 'WAS', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'Director', 'Ronald', 'Neame', 'lovingly', 'step', 'preparation', 'execution', 'caper', 'deeply', 'involved', 'when', 'whole', 'thing', 'threatened', 'appearance', 'Boyd', 'character', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'NEVER', 'WAS', 'fine', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'should', 'appeal', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'great', 'fans', 'action', 'war', 'movies']",Man Who Never Was VHS

Before the Nazis rush from Sicily (where the Brits actually will land) to Greece, they send an agent to London to determine if the intelligence is genuine. That's the intrigue in this intriguing docudrama financed by Hollywood (thus the miscasting of Clifton Webb and Gloria Grahame) but made by English director Ronald Neame on real locations using English actors.Cast against type, Webb is suitably correct. Grahame, an Oscar winner for ""The Bad and the Beautiful,"" however, is embarrassing in a key but contrived role as a librarian whose flyer lover is killed. As the Nazi agent snooping around London, the handsome Stephen Boyd dominates the last quarter of the film with steely charm, reminding us again what a loss his early death was to films in the 1950s. And it's nice to see Sir Cyrl Cusack and Joan Hickson (later Miss Marple on television) in bit parts.What's not so nice (in the version I saw) is the shameful DVD transfer, which begins and ends in the original Cinemascope but throughout reformats to full screen, diminishing the reach of the actual locations and the re-creation of wartime London. This true story, especially the invention of a non-person's whole life, ranks with John LeCarre's tales and ""Five Fingers"" (still unreleased on DVD) as one of Hollywood's better espionage films.

The plot is billiant...plant fake invasion plans on corpse, and hope the Germans fall for the  bait.Unfortunately, good plot movies end up &quot;connect the dot&quot;  themes unless there is real suspense. Everthing goes pretty much according  to plan and we don't have the &quot;Dial M For Murder&quot; or the &quot;39  Steps&quot; type of intrigue. For example, the British pretty much rubber  stamp this project, despite the severity of the plan. Yes, there is  discussion of the plan, but one could be arguing for more orders of  ballpoint pens versus inkwell pens. Then, the villain, the one who is  supposed to check out the story, pretty much covers a routine checklist  that any failed detective would follow. It is not clear why he would go to  extremes of sacrificing his life to determine the validity of the plot.  There is little character development. Surely, there would have been better  ways to obtain the truth, especially once he gets most of the clues. For  example, the non-membership of the deceased at the club...following Lucy to  see if she goes to any memorial services, etc. The villain would thus be  hidden and not expose his identity.Still, one should not be too harsh.  The plot is based on a true story and this itself gives admiration to the  wartime effort of the British to beat the Germans. One can only imagine the  courage of the Bristish soldier( played by Clifton Webb) in a formalized  structure of the British hierarchy to not only propose this plot but to  execute it. But that is why we are really ready to dodge some bullets and  swing at the curve balls.I think then we would have gotten a better flavor  of the team work needed to make this plot work.
