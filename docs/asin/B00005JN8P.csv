627723,A2YW1SOKOLNG2,B00005JN8P,"Amazon Customer ""Movie Fan""","[0, 0]","This was the show that put HBO on the map for quality, original entertainment.  Up to this point, HBO had put out some good stuff before, like The Hitchhiker, Fraggle Rock and Philip Marlowe, Private Eye, but Dream On was the show that made HBO the gold standard it has enjoyed ever since.  Brought to us by Philip Kaufman and Martha Krane, who would later create Friends, this was a weirdly cerebral show.  For any serious movie fan, you will love it.  It's about an ordinary guy going through life, but we are seeing his inner monologue in the form of old movie and TV clips.  He was a TV junkie as a kid and this now bleeds over into his adult life.  This show was the predecessor to The Mind of the Married Man and Herman's Head, and was better than both of them put together.  It is quirky and fun, but not necessarily for every taste as it is heavy on lesser-known film references.  However, anyone who used to love that great cable show, Mystery Science Theater 3000, should love this show.  Check it out.  You will not be disappointed.",5,Another great HBO show you may have missed,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,1043,"['was', 'show', 'put', 'HBO', 'map', 'quality', 'original', 'entertainment', 'Up', 'point', 'HBO', 'had', 'put', 'out', 'good', 'stuff', 'Hitchhiker', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'Philip', 'Marlowe', 'Private', 'Eye', 'Dream', 'was', 'show', 'made', 'HBO', 'gold', 'standard', 'enjoyed', 'ever', 'Brought', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'Martha', 'Krane', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'create', 'Friends', 'was', 'weirdly', 'cerebral', 'show', 'serious', 'movie', 'fan', 'will', 'love', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'going', 'life', 'are', 'seeing', 'inner', 'monologue', 'form', 'old', 'movie', 'TV', 'clips', 'was', 'TV', 'junkie', 'kid', 'now', 'over', 'adult', 'life', 'show', 'was', 'predecessor', 'Mind', 'Married', 'Man', 'Herman', 'Head', 'was', 'better', 'put', 'together', 'quirky', 'fun', 'not', 'necessarily', 'taste', 'heavy', 'lesser-known', 'film', 'references', 'However', 'anyone', 'who', 'used', 'love', 'great', 'cable', 'show', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'should', 'love', 'show', 'Check', 'out', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

My wife thought it looked like another T&A; show until she watched it and found that it is topical, funny, intelligent and VERY thought provoking.  She has now watched all of the episodes from the first and second season.I thoroughly enjoy the way that the show handled the nudity and sex scenes.  Even when they were gratuitous (which wasn't often), they had a real life feel, not the plastic feel that a lot of movies have.Dream On also dealt with topics that broadcast TV couldn't, due to the puritanical standards of the networks (both then and now). Many topics were handled in a very adult manner without passing judgement.I don't know if any more seasons are coming out on DVD, but I (for one) know that it won't be soon enough.

I kinda lost hope and was elated to see this on an add inside another DVD box. Needless to say it took me all of 3 min to go on line and order my copy. I discovered this show by sheer luck as it was shown late at night due to adult content on the Swiss French TV channel (I live in Switzerland). It was in the original language (good) but with subtitles in French (bad as they covered the image and distracted from the view). I was immediately captivated as I found it really funny to hilarious especially some of the B&W; movie ""thoughts"". I did manage to tape them all and also copy them to other tapes to have them in chronological order. I still have the dusty tapes somewhere but soon to go as now we have the luxury of having this great show on DVD. So hello freeze frame, subtitles if and when you want, instant replay etc...The DVD are actually good maybe the image a little bit grainy at times but what the heck is an old show and is only small trade off.Now let's only hope that the other seasons will be also quickly published on DVD!",5,FINALLY!

I used to love this show when I watched it first-run on HBO years ago.  Brian Benben was PERFECT as the hapless Martin Tupper, divorced from his wife Judith and trying to raise his teenage son Jeremy while re-entering the dating scene in the 1990's.  The show contained many clips of old black & white TV shows and movies where appropriate in the story, and they were hilarious!  One of my favorite such moments was in the episode where Jeremy went to a makeout party and told both Martin and Judith he would be staying with the OTHER parent.  They found out they had been duped when Judith phoned Martin and found out he had a woman with him.  She chastised him for doing so because Jeremy was there, but Martin was quick to defend himself and inform Judith that Jeremy was with HER.  She said, ""No, he's..."" and slowly a look of realization comes to both of their faces.  Then, it immediately cuts to a B&W; shot of two small boys saying to each other ""We fell for it!  Boy are we dumb!""  Hilarious!I hope that there are some special features present on this set, but even if there aren't it will still be worth owning.  It's about time that this classic HBO Original Series gets the DVD treatment.  Hats off to Universal!  Now let's hope that another excellent but overlooked HBO Original, ""Tales From the Crypt"", gets the same treatment!  Everyone please support this release so the rest of the seasons will be released as well!

627728,A3T6RCNC7MOGUN,B00005JN8P,"Chris bct ""music everyday""","[5, 5]","Seeing more and more old TV series being released onto DVD I'd hoped to one day see Dream On.  I watched it for years, although only the non cable TV versions.  Subtle funny stuff that was very consistent.  One of my favorite TV comedy series of all time.  What made the pain of its seemingly permanent loss worse was seeing the perfectly acted Eddie Charles actor, Dorien Wilson on my TV (only when changing channels) on the very mediocore The Parkers UPN/WB type laugh track goofy comedy virtually every weekday.  His role on The Parkers was so wasted compared to how amazingly funny and insightful the actor and the role were on Dream On.  Of course, there has been Wendie Malick who played the main character's ex-wife, Judith who plays the vamp on Just Shoot Me, another constant reminder of how great the cast was on Dream On and how ordinary her character was in her later TV series.I'm Mexican/Italian.  It ain't about race.  It's about funny.  The Eddie Charles character was one of the finest, well written characters I can remember in decades of enjoying comedy on TV and at the movies.  Dorien Wilson brought me back to the show week after week.  In fact, I always thought the main actor, Brian Benben was a bit underplayed though he's supposed to be skittish and immature while being endearing (did I just describe most of us men?  No. We're grown ups.)You can bet i'll be purchasing this DVD set of the first 2 seasons and hoping, of course, the other seasons are released as well.  Because quality will tell folks.  Just because it's 10 to 15 years old does not mean it's fresh.  I discovered that when listening to Jimi Hendrix and punk rock from the late 70's and early 80's.  You hear a bunch of that today and the quality material is still zinging today, filtered through our experiences and further entertainment adventures.  Good stuff stands the test of time.  I know when I see Eddie Charles again I'm gonna be laughin' like the early 90's.

Although I was only a kid when it came out, I used to watch it quite a bit - when my parents weren't watching that is!  The humor is so subtle at times it takes you a minute to get it, and since it was cable TV they were free from the network restrictions of language and nudity.  It was a good time.  It was also a very adult good time, of which I felt like I was doing when watching it.  It still is an adult show, although reletively tame nowdays.Look at any TV show today or in the recent past and they all pay some tribute to Dream On's revolutionary vision.  Ally McBeal had her fantasy sequences, the ladies of Sex & The City and their romps, and The Surprano family's foul mouths (just to name a few) may have never made it on the air had this show never been.  Who would've thought that some black and white, obscure footage of movies past who no one remembers would have become so cool?For reasons I'm not quite sure of, Martin is an appealing guy.  He's not the most handsome, not the most clever, but he has one of those rare character balances of being both the strait man and the happy, bumbling fool.  Reeling from his divorce, he is attempting to start over again.  And over, and over, and over.  We can all relate.  Just when things are going his way it seems to fall apart again.

I recall many more wonderful moments, most notably an hour-long episode featuring Tom Poston, James Woods, Isabel Sanford, Tom Smothers, Jack E. Carter.

Martin Tupper (Brian Benben) is a recently divorced New York book editor whose life is full of wild situations and offbeat characters. From dealing with his headstrong assistant to finding love in the wrong places, Martin struggles to keep order in his life and still be a positive role model for his growing teenage son. ""Dream On"" premiered on HBO in 1990 and became one of the first original shows that changed cable television to a whole new generation of innovative programming. The landmark adult comedy could be best described as a male version of ""Sex in the City"". ""Dream On"" had a good six year run and earned several CableACE and Emmy awards. The episodes feature some well written storylines, strong sexual references and  short clips of classic films that are clever metaphors of Martin's reactions. Brian Benben delivers a good comedic performance and the supporting cast is wonderful. The first 2 seasons features guest stars like Fran Drescher, David Bowie, Mimi Rogers, Catherine O'Hara and Tom Berenger.Don't expect to be blown away with ""Dream On: Seasons 1 & 2"". All 28 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. The picture quality is reasonably good and the 2.0 Dolby Digital sound holds up quite well. Its only supplemental feature is a short introduction by series producer John Landis. Despite the complete lack of DVD extras, ""Dream On"" is a breakthrough comedy that pushed the boundaries on cable programming and earns a ""B"".",4,Sex & the Single Father,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,1601,"['creators', 'popular', 'comedy', 'Friends', 'examine', 'hardships', 'single', 'life', 'hilarious', 'adult', 'comedy', 'sitcom', 'Dream', 'Martin', 'Tupper', 'Brian', 'Benben', 'recently', 'divorced', 'New', 'York', 'book', 'editor', 'life', 'full', 'wild', 'situations', 'offbeat', 'characters', 'dealing', 'headstrong', 'assistant', 'finding', 'love', 'wrong', 'places', 'Martin', 'keep', 'order', 'life', 'still', 'be', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'growing', 'teenage', 'son', 'Dream', 'premiered', 'HBO', '1990', 'became', 'one', 'first', 'original', 'shows', 'changed', 'cable', 'television', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'innovative', 'programming', 'landmark', 'adult', 'comedy', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'male', 'version', 'Sex', 'City', 'Dream', 'had', 'good', 'six', 'year', 'run', 'earned', 'several', 'CableACE', 'Emmy', 'awards', 'episodes', 'feature', 'well', 'written', 'storylines', 'strong', 'sexual', 'references', 'short', 'clips', 'classic', 'films', 'are', 'clever', 'metaphors', 'Martin', 'reactions', 'Brian', 'Benben', 'good', 'comedic', 'performance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'features', 'guest', 'stars', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Tom', 'Berenger.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'Dream', 'Seasons', '1', '2', '28', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'original', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'picture', 'quality', 'reasonably', 'good', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'only', 'supplemental', 'feature', 'short', 'introduction', 'series', 'producer', 'John', 'Landis', 'complete', 'lack', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Dream', 'breakthrough', 'comedy', 'pushed', 'boundaries', 'cable', 'programming', 'B']",N/A

If you've never seen the show, it's about a guy named Martin Tupper, who grew up in front of the TV.  Martin Tupper is a divorced book editor who is still in love with his wife, even though she's moved on and married a guy who's beyond perfect.Several clips from old 1950's TV shows are thrown into each show.  Somebody will ask Martin a question and an old scene from one of these shows pops up to show us his real response, followed by what he actually says to the person.  For example, there's an episode where he feels betrayed by his best friend and every time he thinks about the friend they show a clip of a guy getting a knife thrown into his back.The shows are usually pretty funny and it's fun to watch the guest stars pop up in each episode.  People like Larry Miller, Martin Mull, the woman who played Mimi on Drew Carey, and several others you'll recognize pop up in just about every episode.They also had a good supporting cast with Wendy Malick as his ex-wife, Chris Demetral as their son, Denny Dillon as his secretary and Dorien Wilson as his best friend (except for the first season when they had another guy play the part).  Michael McKean is in several episodes as Martin's sleazy boss, and he does a great job too.It was great to see these shows again after all these years.

627741,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JN8P,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[31, 34]","One of HBO's first original comedies ""Dream On"" chronicles the life of Martin Tupper a book editor who has a difficult time relating to women. Interspersed throughout each episode are clips from old films that Tupper grew up watching as a kid. These clips act as both a metaphor for Martin's true feelings as well as a reference that he uses to help him deal with difficult situations. Tupper copes with dating again after divorce and trying to relate to his teenage son. His ex-wife Judith (the wonderful Wendie Malick) provides him with one of the few touch points with the fairer sex. Unfortunately, Judith not only remarried but did so to someone who is nearly perfect in comparison to the neurotic Martin.  His unusual friends and co-workers (among them Toby played by Denny Dillon who gives new meaning to the word evil) keep Tupper's life in a state of upheaval not that he needs any help with that anyway.Criminally underappreciated in its day, ""Dream On"" ran for over a 100 episodes and predates many of the other series that garnered much more attention and praise (such as ""The Sopranos""). Although ""Dream On"" was a great comedy during its first three seasons  it lost much of its steam by the end of its run. Even during the lesser shows the show was well written and performed with an air of screwball comedy missing from TV when it was being aired. The gimmick of using old movie and TV clips as cultural reference points for Tupper grew tired by the end of the show's run but the lively cast kept the series interesting until the very end.""Dream On"" has the look of a wonderful daydream on DVD. Universal has done a fine job with this transfer with few analog or digital blemishes to mar the picture. The picture does occasionally appear soft during some sequences (most notably during some of the older clips from movies) but that's an unfortunate byproduct of referencing so many older films of variation quality. There are also noticeable analog imperfections in the form of hair, dirt, etc. during the clips intercut throughout the show but, on the whole, the picture looks very good. The show wasn't show with 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound in mind so isn't presented in that format. The stereo sound is frequently impressive although keep in mind that the clips used throughout the show are usually in mono so it does flit back and forth between the two formats.Sadly, there's not much in the way of extras provided. Executive Producer John Landis does appear for an introduction to the series. Landis briefly discusses the inspiration of the show and his involvement in the series during its run on HBO. The good news is that these episodes are uncut and feature all the nudity, swearing and hilarious sexual situations that fans saw when it was initially run on HBO.No commentary track although I'm sure star Brian Benben would have been more than willing to provide it (provided there was compensation). My guess is that Universal didn't budget the series for commentary tracks or featurettes hoping that the uncut episodes and the fact that the series has run infrequently since the late 90's might be enough to attract fans to buy it. I'm also quite sure that they weren't sure that the market could justify spending the extra money on these features. It appears that most of the production budget for the DVD went into making sure that the image quality and sound quality was acceptable.A forgotten pioneer original series on HBO, ""Dream On"" continues to be funny today because it focuses more on the characters and less on the gimmick of Martin relating to those around him through his experience of watching TV. The gimmick isn't as heavily relied on during the second half of the first season and that's really when the comedy takes flight. Although there aren't any extras to speak of, the picture and sound quality are exceptionally good.",5,Dreams do come true!,1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,3872,"['One', 'HBO', 'first', 'original', 'comedies', 'Dream', 'life', 'Martin', 'Tupper', 'book', 'editor', 'who', 'difficult', 'time', 'relating', 'women', 'Interspersed', 'episode', 'are', 'clips', 'old', 'films', 'Tupper', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'kid', 'clips', 'act', 'metaphor', 'Martin', 'true', 'feelings', 'as', 'well', 'reference', 'help', 'deal', 'difficult', 'situations', 'Tupper', 'dating', 'again', 'divorce', 'trying', 'relate', 'teenage', 'son', 'ex-wife', 'Judith', 'wonderful', 'Wendie', 'Malick', 'one', 'few', 'touch', 'points', 'fairer', 'sex', 'Unfortunately', 'Judith', 'not', 'only', 'remarried', 'did', 'so', 'someone', 'who', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'comparison', 'neurotic', 'Martin', 'unusual', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'Toby', 'played', 'Denny', 'Dillon', 'who', 'new', 'meaning', 'word', 'evil', 'keep', 'Tupper', 'life', 'state', 'upheaval', 'not', 'help', 'anyway.Criminally', 'underappreciated', 'day', 'Dream', 'ran', '100', 'episodes', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'garnered', 'much', 'more', 'attention', 'praise', 'such', 'Sopranos', 'Dream', 'was', 'great', 'comedy', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'lost', 'much', 'steam', 'end', 'run', 'Even', 'lesser', 'show', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'performed', 'air', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'missing', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'being', 'aired', 'gimmick', 'using', 'old', 'movie', 'TV', 'clips', 'cultural', 'reference', 'points', 'Tupper', 'grew', 'tired', 'end', 'show', 'run', 'lively', 'cast', 'kept', 'series', 'interesting', 'very', 'end', 'Dream', 'look', 'wonderful', 'daydream', 'DVD', 'Universal', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'transfer', 'few', 'analog', 'digital', 'blemishes', 'mar', 'picture', 'picture', 'occasionally', 'appear', 'soft', 'sequences', 'most', 'notably', 'older', 'clips', 'movies', 'unfortunate', 'byproduct', 'referencing', 'so', 'many', 'older', 'films', 'variation', 'quality', 'are', 'also', 'noticeable', 'analog', 'imperfections', 'form', 'hair', 'dirt', 'etc', 'clips', 'intercut', 'show', 'whole', 'picture', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'show', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'mind', 'so', ""n't"", 'presented', 'format', 'stereo', 'sound', 'frequently', 'impressive', 'keep', 'mind', 'clips', 'used', 'show', 'are', 'usually', 'mono', 'flit', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'formats.Sadly', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'provided', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'John', 'Landis', 'appear', 'introduction', 'series', 'Landis', 'briefly', 'inspiration', 'show', 'involvement', 'series', 'run', 'HBO', 'good', 'news', 'episodes', 'are', 'uncut', 'feature', 'nudity', 'swearing', 'hilarious', 'sexual', 'situations', 'fans', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'initially', 'run', 'HBO.No', 'commentary', 'track', ""'m"", 'sure', 'star', 'Brian', 'Benben', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'willing', 'provide', 'provided', 'was', 'compensation', 'guess', 'Universal', 'did', ""n't"", 'budget', 'series', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'featurettes', 'hoping', 'uncut', 'episodes', 'fact', 'series', 'run', 'infrequently', 'late', '90', 'might', 'be', 'enough', 'attract', 'fans', 'buy', ""'m"", 'also', 'quite', 'sure', 'were', ""n't"", 'sure', 'market', 'could', 'justify', 'spending', 'extra', 'money', 'features', 'most', 'production', 'budget', 'DVD', 'went', 'making', 'sure', 'image', 'quality', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'acceptable.A', 'forgotten', 'pioneer', 'original', 'series', 'HBO', 'Dream', 'be', 'funny', 'today', 'more', 'characters', 'less', 'gimmick', 'Martin', 'relating', 'experience', 'watching', 'TV', 'gimmick', ""n't"", 'heavily', 'relied', 'second', 'half', 'first', 'season', 'really', 'when', 'comedy', 'flight', 'are', ""n't"", 'extras', 'speak', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'good']",N/A
