Bendix plays a gunslinger that plays the role serious. Not that he wasn't a bad actor. He played it straight in the movie ""The Blue Dahlia."" Doug McClure, people will debate with me, isn't the best cowboy actor and how he got typecast in so many cowboy roles is beyond me. I was just never impressed with him. The series is light-hearted and not meant to be a straight, serious cowboy Western like ""Cheyenne."" The picture quality is beautiful. The price is a bargain. I remember paying $35 for a 16mm master of one of the episodes. Small tip: I discovered you need to watch the series in chronological order.

The quality of my DVD is not very good compared to many other shows I own. This is a big minus for me. It is a bit tireing to watch stagecoach rocking similar ways in each episode. These are obviously made in studio. Both main actors are likable, but I do not care about the Laredo-type bantering they have in each episode. If you like this, then the series is easier to like. The stories are O.K., but because of the light attitude between main actors, real excitement is lacking. Overland Trail is not a very serious business. Maybe it would have been better with a lot more comedy. Or a bit more tragedy.
