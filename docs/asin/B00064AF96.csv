Each different song was so wonderful I, had to keep on singing along and not stop until-it was finished.It was fun to see Captain Feathersword fly like an eagle while the Wiggles were performing ""Eagle Rock"".  I also liked ""Hoop-Dee-Doo"", ""I Wave My Arms and Swing my Baton"", and ""Play Your Guitar with Murray"".Live Hot Potatoes is A BIG WIGGLY CONCERT MOVIE!!.",5,A BIG WIGGLY CONCERT MOVIE!!,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,437,"['Wiggles', 'have', 'done', 'again', 'made', 'Live', 'Hot', 'Potatoes', 'huge', 'sucess', 'different', 'song', 'was', 'so', 'wonderful', 'had', 'keep', 'singing', 'along', 'not', 'stop', 'until-it', 'was', 'finished.It', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'fly', 'eagle', 'Wiggles', 'were', 'performing', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'also', 'liked', 'Hoop-Dee-Doo', 'Wave', 'Arms', 'Swing', 'Baton', 'Play', 'Guitar', 'Murray', '.Live', 'Hot', 'Potatoes', 'BIG', 'WIGGLY', 'CONCERT', 'MOVIE']",The Wiggles - Live Hot Potatoes
859236,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,B00064AF96,csm,"[40, 41]","If you've ever seen the Wiggles live, then you know just how fantastic their live shows are.  This video is a must-have for nothing else, a keepsake.  It's full of stuff from their recent tour, and even has Santa in there at the end.  They go around looking for Jeff again, complete with the blow-up balloon.  My little one went upstairs and grabbed his guitar and was playing along with most of the show.  Then he went after his keyboard and gave me the guitar and we played together!  You can't passively watch the Wiggles - you just have to get up and dance along.  They do such a fantastic job too - it never ceases to amaze me the amount of time an thought that goes into their shows.  This video gives a glimpse of what they did here in the US - they showed them driving in the Big Red Car, going under signs for Columbus, then driving into the auditorium and the next thing you see is them driving out in the Big Red Car onto the stage.  That about floored my husband, who is a teacher as well (so are the Wiggles).  He just keeps remarking at all the attention the Wiggles give to the details to keep the kids' attention while teaching them at the same time.  They're learning and they don't even know it.  Just like Leapfrog products!  I'm still wondering how Greg dances like a noodle up there - he's got to be double-jointed!Don't expect this to be a quick view and leave video either - it's 140 minutes long!  Some of the cinematography could have been better though on this - the dark shots turned blue, and Anthony produced the musical portion and some of Greg's vocals are a little ""hot"" here and there, but kids don't care much about that.  And, unless you're a musician or in the music business, you're not going to notice it much.  That's my only criticism of this video.  It's especially nice to hear Captain Feathersword sing ""Eagle Rock.""  I loved it when they had him flying on a trapeze out into the audience during their recent shows here and guess what?  It's on this video too!  That definitely made our day here.  My little one was just as mesmerized by it again when he saw the video.Another highlight of this video is that it is totally live. There's no canned studio tracks being used on this one.  They have a live orchestra up there, complete with backup singers.  Dom Lindsey is the orchestra director, complete in white hat and tails, and leads the orchestra, plays trumpet (hey, it's worth the cost of the video just to hear him play!), and even sings as one of the ""three tenors"" with Captain Feathersword.  Awesome part for us music people out there!Great, great stuff, I highly recommend it and if you're new to the Wiggles, grab this guy and get ""Toot, Toot"" too.  That still is their best one, in my humble opinion besides this one.  Great job Wiggles and thanks very much for caring about the quality of products being directed towards our children.  You definitely deserve all the success you are having!",5,"Fantastic video, great to save for a concert memory",1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,2946,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Wiggles', 'live', 'then', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'fantastic', 'live', 'shows', 'are', 'video', 'must-have', 'nothing', 'else', 'keepsake', 'full', 'stuff', 'recent', 'tour', 'even', 'Santa', 'end', 'go', 'looking', 'Jeff', 'again', 'complete', 'blow-up', 'balloon', 'little', 'one', 'went', 'upstairs', 'grabbed', 'guitar', 'was', 'playing', 'along', 'most', 'show', 'Then', 'went', 'keyboard', 'gave', 'guitar', 'played', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'passively', 'watch', 'Wiggles', 'just', 'have', 'get', 'up', 'dance', 'along', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'too', 'never', 'amaze', 'amount', 'time', 'thought', 'shows', 'video', 'glimpse', 'what', 'did', 'here', 'US', 'showed', 'driving', 'Big', 'Red', 'Car', 'going', 'signs', 'Columbus', 'then', 'driving', 'auditorium', 'next', 'thing', 'see', 'driving', 'out', 'Big', 'Red', 'Car', 'stage', 'floored', 'husband', 'who', 'teacher', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'are', 'Wiggles', 'just', 'remarking', 'attention', 'Wiggles', 'give', 'details', 'keep', 'kids', 'attention', 'teaching', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'learning', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Just', 'Leapfrog', 'products', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'how', 'Greg', 'noodle', 'there', 'got', 'be', 'double-jointed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'quick', 'view', 'leave', 'video', '140', 'minutes', 'long', 'cinematography', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'dark', 'shots', 'turned', 'blue', 'Anthony', 'produced', 'musical', 'portion', 'Greg', 'vocals', 'are', 'little', 'hot', 'here', 'there', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', ""'re"", 'musician', 'music', 'business', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'notice', 'much', 'only', 'criticism', 'video', 'especially', 'nice', 'hear', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'sing', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'loved', 'when', 'had', 'flying', 'trapeze', 'out', 'audience', 'recent', 'shows', 'here', 'guess', 'what', 'video', 'too', 'definitely', 'made', 'day', 'here', 'little', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'mesmerized', 'again', 'when', 'saw', 'video.Another', 'highlight', 'video', 'totally', 'live', 'canned', 'studio', 'tracks', 'being', 'used', 'one', 'have', 'live', 'orchestra', 'there', 'complete', 'backup', 'singers', 'Dom', 'Lindsey', 'orchestra', 'director', 'complete', 'white', 'hat', 'tails', 'orchestra', 'trumpet', 'hey', 'cost', 'video', 'just', 'hear', 'play', 'even', 'sings', 'one', 'three', 'tenors', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'Awesome', 'part', 'music', 'people', 'there', 'Great', 'great', 'stuff', 'highly', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'new', 'Wiggles', 'grab', 'guy', 'get', 'Toot', 'Toot', 'too', 'still', 'best', 'one', 'humble', 'opinion', 'one', 'Great', 'job', 'Wiggles', 'thanks', 'very', 'much', 'caring', 'quality', 'products', 'being', 'directed', 'children', 'definitely', 'deserve', 'success', 'are', 'having']",The Wiggles - Live Hot Potatoes

We have numerous DVDs of the Wiggles and this is our favorite.  Entertaining and just plain fun.  My daughter will join the Wiggles on all the songs (not so much singing, but hand gestures).  She loves Rock-a-bye-bear!  Gets on the floor to roll like Captain Feathersword and running back.  Dorothy is our favorite in our house (popular name i.e. Elmo's fish's name is Dorothy). If your child is into the Wiggles this DVD is a must.  Great exercise music for us parents.  Plus the songs are not corny and are very entertaining.
