I enjoyed it immensely, and the  choice of Michael Feinstein to do the narrating was excellent.  I would have liked to have more of the lyrics sung to some of the songs, but in the interest of time this wasn't possible even though the program is nearly three hours long.  On the other hand many of the songs I enjoyed hearing did have more of the lyrics than I expected.  The great songwriters are all here.  It's not necessary for me to mention all the names, but George M. Cohan, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Richard Rogers, Larry Hart, Oscar Hammerstein, and several others are all here.

The nostalgia was warm, breath-taking, a slice of Americana as it once was. We will never see those days again. True, every chapter of history has its corruption and ne'er do wells, but this was the idealism and art and culture that could have made America great - if only.But forget about if-only for the few hours that it takes to get lost in the rhapsody and pageantry and the history of American music. For me, it evoked memories of times I wasn't even there for, but my parents and grandparents knew the songs and I watch old movies.

In contrast, the classic songs of stage and film have never been of much interest to me. But this excellent documentary really brought that music to life and allowed me to learn about an entirely different aspect of American culture.Pianist Michael Feinstein serves as the narraror and provides fascinating commentary on great lyricists and composers such as Ira and George Gershwin, Lorez Hart and Oscar Hammerstein. The doc begins with America's first popular song, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", and continues through the 19th century, the Jazz Age, big band era and up until the emergence of rock and roll in the 1950's. Much of the music is drawn from Broadway and Hollywood musicals, with some great film clips and other footage from the historical archives.

Miss Day, almost single-handedly, saved the movie musical in the 1950s.  She also saved Warner Brothers from becoming non-existant.  When she became a star with her first film, ""Romance on the High Seas,"" she rose to become the #1 musical star in films.Perhaps the people who produce these films are from the ""I must hate Doris Day"" era.  There was a time when the mere mention of Day's name drew ire from many uninformed people, some were even critics.  What they don't want to admit is that Doris Day is one of the most popular and talented singer/actresses in the history of motion pictures. That's a crime, in my opinion.  Forget the fact that she remains, to this day, the top female boxoffice star of all time.Certainly, she deserves more screen time in these documentaries, since there is so much material from which to choose.  She made 17 films in 7 years while at Warner Brothers alone, most of them musicals.Most of the people who get the star treatment in these documentaries were never as big as Day, and like Garland, didn't have the crossover appeal to the Top 40 charts, as Doris did.Until Doris gets her due, I won't buy these documentaries.",3,"Mostly All Judy Garland, Very Little Doris Day...",1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,1286,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'happens', 'whenever', 'documentaries', 'are', 'made', 'get', 'TONS', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'hardly', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Miss', 'Day', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'saved', 'movie', 'musical', '1950s', 'also', 'saved', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'becoming', 'non-existant', 'When', 'became', 'star', 'first', 'film', 'Romance', 'High', 'Seas', 'rose', 'become', '1', 'musical', 'star', 'people', 'who', 'produce', 'films', 'are', 'must', 'hate', 'Doris', 'Day', 'era', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'mere', 'mention', 'Day', 'name', 'drew', 'ire', 'many', 'uninformed', 'people', 'were', 'even', 'critics', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'admit', 'Doris', 'Day', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'talented', 'singer/actresses', 'history', 'motion', 'pictures', 'crime', 'opinion', 'Forget', 'fact', 'day', 'top', 'female', 'boxoffice', 'star', 'time.Certainly', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'documentaries', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'choose', 'made', '17', 'films', '7', 'years', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'alone', 'most', 'musicals.Most', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'star', 'treatment', 'documentaries', 'were', 'never', 'as', 'big', 'Day', 'Garland', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'crossover', 'appeal', 'Top', '40', 'charts', 'Doris', 'did.Until', 'Doris', 'due', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'documentaries']",The Great American Songbook
