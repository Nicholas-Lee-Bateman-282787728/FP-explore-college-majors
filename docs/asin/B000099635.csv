752834,A3ONKRWEZMJJUV,B000099635,"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista""","[2, 3]","Nine short films that explain and digs in The Matrix Mythology. Six of them are outstanding (Final Flight of the Osiris, The second Renaissance Part I and II, Kid's Story, Program, and Beyond), one that is good (World Record), but not matching the storyline level of the best Animatrix, and two, that even though in their beautiful visuals, never achieves more beyond that (A Detectives Story, and Matriculated). I recommended to look at then as a whole, a full-length film divided in nine episodes, this because they are really part of single stage proposal, their goal is to make complete the whole picture, and so they do with a great effect. Fans of Japanimation will find it as a real piece of art, (visually it is, the quality and diversity of the animation is a strong element to take into consideration, always with the highly appealing Anime style), the ones that don't know the genre will find it breathtaking and refreshing, a real compelling view of The Matrix world and logic, here to make the Trilogy more accessible but maintaining its complex architecture of science fiction style.The Wachowski Brothers enlisted an arsenal of first class Japanimation directors, and one from the computer animation world to bring to screen their innovative idea. Some of them where the main influence for The Matrix development, so in this cases, it became almost a matter of retribution, or an imposed tribute to then selves.Final Flight of the Osiris (the first short in the package), made entirely of computer animation, is a prelude to The Matrix Reloaded. How the Osiris encounters the Sentinel Army and the communication of this to Zion, is the story. It can't be view along from the Trilogy because its intention is to illustrated (not tell), how humans spotted the invasion, plus it shows a quite sensual duel between its main characters before the tragedy (directed by Animation director of Final Fantasy, the Spirits Within, Andy Jones). Fast, accurate and captivating, a quick and sharp ride. The Second Renaissance Part I and II, shockingly narrates the facts of how the machines came to be the human predators. With a smart straight documentary style, the story captivates the scary sense of the first Matrix, more solid this time, the best of the Animatrix. Kid's Story, makes clear all about that none sense character appearing from no where in Reloaded, the graphic rough style is very much in the mood of this simple but emotional story, another piece that explains some facts of Reloaded. Program (written and directed by Ninja Scroll director), manipulates a computer training program that teaches a lesson to one of its users, but the lesson is all about possible betrayal disguised in a couple's love, the lesson is hard to learn, shocking and sharp. Beyond, the most poetic and beautiful of the Animatrix (a real pain in the a... for the producers because of its director slow making), tells the original story of a bunch of kids that encounters a fluctuation in the Matrix, shaped in the form of a haunted house, is a delicate view in this cold artificial world, like a rose in a pond. This six shorts are captivating with a imaginative view and narration that quickly takes you directly into their stories, an achievement very difficult to obtain in short films, sum to this the great musical work from Don Davis (redeeming himself from his mediocre work in The Matrix), rising the emotional twists and still moments. World Record is a good effort, but the story is not clearly explained, making it a little confusing in its resolution, so the goal of the runner is missed in the way for glory, somewhere in the script. A Detective Story (as the rest of the Animatrix), surprises with its animation, but the story is both boring (specially when comparison it with the previous seven shorts), and flat, do your business in the bathroom while this short is on, it is something like a Black Detective story, but without the charm of the genre it tries to emulate. Finally Matriculated is by far, the worst, annoying and pointless it tells an Alice in Wonder Land plot, only in abusing of it's own director work shipping of his animation, nothing more. The extras are more than interesting (specially, Scrolls to Screen; The History and Culture of Anime, a documentary), and the quality of the sound sure makes the experience worth buying or renting it, definitively a far better choice to have instead of Reloaded and Revolutions.",4,"""Japanimation"" done with Conviction and unlimited Resources.",1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,4451,"['Nine', 'short', 'films', 'explain', 'digs', 'Matrix', 'Mythology', 'Six', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Final', 'Flight', 'Osiris', 'second', 'Renaissance', 'Part', 'II', 'Kid', 'Story', 'Program', 'Beyond', 'one', 'good', 'World', 'Record', 'not', 'matching', 'storyline', 'level', 'best', 'Animatrix', 'two', 'even', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'never', 'more', 'Detectives', 'Story', 'Matriculated', 'recommended', 'look', 'then', 'whole', 'full-length', 'film', 'divided', 'nine', 'episodes', 'are', 'really', 'part', 'single', 'stage', 'proposal', 'goal', 'make', 'complete', 'whole', 'picture', 'so', 'do', 'great', 'effect', 'Fans', 'Japanimation', 'will', 'find', 'real', 'piece', 'art', 'quality', 'diversity', 'animation', 'strong', 'element', 'take', 'consideration', 'always', 'highly', 'appealing', 'Anime', 'style', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'genre', 'will', 'find', 'breathtaking', 'refreshing', 'real', 'compelling', 'view', 'Matrix', 'world', 'logic', 'here', 'make', 'Trilogy', 'more', 'accessible', 'maintaining', 'complex', 'architecture', 'science', 'fiction', 'style.The', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'enlisted', 'arsenal', 'first', 'class', 'Japanimation', 'directors', 'one', 'computer', 'animation', 'world', 'bring', 'screen', 'innovative', 'idea', 'where', 'main', 'influence', 'Matrix', 'development', 'so', 'cases', 'became', 'almost', 'matter', 'retribution', 'imposed', 'tribute', 'then', 'selves.Final', 'Flight', 'Osiris', 'first', 'short', 'package', 'made', 'entirely', 'computer', 'animation', 'prelude', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'How', 'Osiris', 'Sentinel', 'Army', 'communication', 'Zion', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'view', 'Trilogy', 'intention', 'illustrated', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'humans', 'spotted', 'invasion', 'quite', 'sensual', 'duel', 'main', 'characters', 'tragedy', 'directed', 'Animation', 'director', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'Andy', 'Jones', 'Fast', 'accurate', 'captivating', 'quick', 'sharp', 'ride', 'Second', 'Renaissance', 'Part', 'II', 'shockingly', 'facts', 'how', 'machines', 'came', 'be', 'human', 'predators', 'smart', 'straight', 'documentary', 'style', 'story', 'scary', 'sense', 'first', 'Matrix', 'more', 'solid', 'time', 'best', 'Animatrix', 'Kid', 'Story', 'clear', 'none', 'sense', 'character', 'appearing', 'where', 'Reloaded', 'graphic', 'rough', 'style', 'very', 'much', 'mood', 'simple', 'emotional', 'story', 'piece', 'facts', 'Reloaded', 'Program', 'written', 'directed', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'director', 'computer', 'training', 'program', 'lesson', 'one', 'users', 'lesson', 'possible', 'betrayal', 'disguised', 'couple', 'love', 'lesson', 'hard', 'learn', 'shocking', 'sharp', 'Beyond', 'most', 'poetic', 'beautiful', 'Animatrix', 'real', 'pain', 'producers', 'director', 'making', 'original', 'story', 'bunch', 'kids', 'fluctuation', 'Matrix', 'shaped', 'form', 'haunted', 'house', 'delicate', 'view', 'cold', 'artificial', 'world', 'rose', 'pond', 'six', 'shorts', 'are', 'captivating', 'imaginative', 'view', 'narration', 'quickly', 'directly', 'stories', 'achievement', 'very', 'difficult', 'obtain', 'short', 'films', 'sum', 'great', 'musical', 'work', 'Don', 'Davis', 'redeeming', 'mediocre', 'work', 'Matrix', 'rising', 'emotional', 'twists', 'still', 'moments', 'World', 'Record', 'good', 'effort', 'story', 'not', 'clearly', 'explained', 'making', 'little', 'confusing', 'resolution', 'goal', 'runner', 'missed', 'way', 'glory', 'somewhere', 'script', 'Detective', 'Story', 'rest', 'Animatrix', 'animation', 'story', 'boring', 'specially', 'when', 'comparison', 'previous', 'seven', 'shorts', 'flat', 'do', 'business', 'bathroom', 'short', 'something', 'Black', 'Detective', 'story', 'charm', 'genre', 'emulate', 'Finally', 'Matriculated', 'far', 'worst', 'annoying', 'pointless', 'Alice', 'Wonder', 'Land', 'plot', 'only', 'abusing', 'own', 'director', 'work', 'shipping', 'animation', 'nothing', 'more', 'extras', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'specially', 'Scrolls', 'Screen', 'History', 'Culture', 'Anime', 'documentary', 'quality', 'sound', 'sure', 'experience', 'worth', 'buying', 'renting', 'definitively', 'far', 'better', 'choice', 'have', 'instead', 'Reloaded', 'Revolutions']",The Animatrix: Gift Set

752838,AZLC3D46UHOAK,B000099635,Bryan Weber,"[5, 6]","Alrighty, this will be a bit different from my usual reviews. Animatrix is done as an omnibus, so therefore, I shall give my opinion of each segment on its own.1. Final Flight of the Osiris: Top notch computer animation and a story that leads straight into the second movie. This one is more eye-candy than anything else, but it's good eye-candy.2. The Second Renaisance Pts. 1 & 2: The history of our future, as told by the archives of Zion. Learn the chilling origin of the Matrix, and learn that the machines aren't the only ones to blame for the downfall of humanity. Chilling and graphic imagery, with direct parallels to well known historical events. This gives us an expanded view of what Morpheus told Neo in the first movie. Not for the squeamish.3. Kid's Story: Utilizing bizarre imagery, this is the tale of one young man who became aware of the Matrix, and his efforts to escape. Symbolism is thick, and there are thoughts on modern youth culture in this world.4. Program: All cel animation, but you would never know from looking at it. Two lovers quarrel over returning to the Matrix as they fight in a gorgeous rendition of old Japan. This one will leave an indelible mark on the viewer. The keen ear will detect superb voice acting from Samuri Jack's title actor, Phil LaMarr.5. World Record: This one is wholly symbollic of man's eternal struggle, not against machine, though the Matrix is certainly involved, but rather, against his own human limitations. A tribute to the indomitable spirit of humanity. This tale is about a track runner trying hard to push the limits of his mind and body...and paying a heavy price for doing so.6. Beyond: A glitch...or a haunted house. Either way, a group of children discover a place of magic in the world. But the Agents have discovered it, as well. Ever wonder why there is no magic left in the world? This story will offer you one possible reason.7. A Detective Story: Harken back to the days of Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe in this film noir homage. Detective Ash is hired to find Trinity, but his search through the looking glass and down the rabbit hole will not be an easy one. The art here reflects the true beauty of old black and white films.8. Matriculated: What if the problem is that humans and machines never really tried to understand one another? What if neither understood the others suffering? Is it possible to reach out and offer an olive branch for peace? Or have the machines learned too well the art of cruelty from their former masters? This one features the familiar art style of Peter Chung, of Aeon Flux and Reign: The Conqueror fame. Also voice acting by Dwight Schultz from Star Trek: The Next Generation.Enthusiasts of voice acting will recognize several voices, including Tara Strong, notably of the Powerpuff Girls, Kevin Richardson, who, ironically enough, played Morpheus in a Matrix parody done by Kevin Smith in his Clerks animated series, and the voices of Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Matt McKenzie of the original movie.The soundtrack disc included is also of good quality, featuring a number of innovative techno style songs, most notably the track ""Who Am I?"" from the Kid's Story segment.The only pity is that we will never get an anthology like this for television, because there is so much of the Matrix that could be delved into.P.S.

The DVD gives you background filler for what the Matrix is and the Wachowski brothers allow some of Japan's best anime artists to interpet the 9 different stories on their own.  I think, just like art, each viewer will have a different type of experience.  You have 9 wonderful compelling stories and the visual style is so different that it adds much value to the telling of the stories.  The brothers had a vision and clearly the Matrix effected many people and, what a wonderful gift they gave by incorporating the world of anime into the telling of their vision.  But not only is it visually stunning and stylish, but the music is dead on.  There are all sorts of morals in the stories.  From SECOND RENNAISSANCE'S man's destructive nature and his down fall, to the sort of, don't-play-with-fire nature of MATRICULATED and the playfulness and joy of BEYOND.  Plus the DVD special features take us into each director of each piece explaining his &quot;art&quot; and how the film the Matrix effected them.  We even get a little history on the orgins of anime.  It was just really enjoyable to watch people who are so passionate about their craft and about the Matrix.

752841,AYUFQY3XG4ZBR,B000099635,"Johnny Sideburns ""21st Century Renaissance Man""","[0, 0]","I have to admit that as much as I was anticipating the release of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" in the Spring of 2003, I was not particularly impressed with the effort. Sure, the special effects were terrific and (most of) the action sequences were amazing, but the movie eventually disappeared up its own @rse and drowned in a sea of metaphysical philosophical nospeak. It really didn't add much to the story as introduced in the original ""Matrix"" movie.>Which is why I find ""The Animatrix"" so much more rewarding and entertaining to watch. I was skeptical about the notion of an animated interpretation of ""The Matrix"" (what would be the point as beautifully presented as it was in live action?), but not only does ""The Animatrix"" expand dramatically on the themes of the first ""Matrix"" movie, this expansion also enables it to stand (to a large degree) independently of the first movie altogether.>""Final Flight of the Osiris"" starts the program; the graphics are amazing enough, but the true reason for this episode is to introduce the video game ""Enter The Matrix"" (and to show off the animation skills of its creators); it looks great, but it has little purpose.>""The Second Renaissance (Pts. I & II)"" does more to explain the cirumstances under which the characters in ""The Matrix"" movies have found themselves; extremely well-thought out and executed.>""Kid's Story"" is a bit of a Gen-X take on the ""awakening"" experience detailed in the first ""Matrix"" movie (guest appearances from Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in the English translations are a nice touch).>""Program"" is another variation on the training exercises within the virtual world; terrific animation from the folks who brought you ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust"" and ""Ninja Scroll"".>""World Record"" is dismissed by other reviewers, but I found it to be another interesting take on the ""awakening"" theme.>""Beyond"" was the first episode I'd seen from this collection; it is perhaps the most original interpretation of ""The Matrix"" themes to be found on this DVD (think back to Neo's ""deja vu"" experience from the first movie as a point-of-reference); many aspects of this story have ""other-worldly"" applications that weren't breached during either ""Matrix"" live-action movie...this one may have the most Japanese soul of all entries included here.>""A Detective Story"" is obviously (and brilliantly) done by the folks behind ""Cowboy Bebop""; very noir, very pulp fiction-esque, and another cameo appearance by Carrie-Anne Moss. Slickly done and my favorite episode to watch just for the sheer beauty of the production.>""Matriculated"" completes the collection, an hallucinogenic collection of images that begin wihtin the real world and pick up to a nearly lysergic rate with another training exercise session (although this one designed with the idea of ""converting"" enemy machines to the side of the human beings). My favorite anime artist, Peter Chung of ""Aeon Flux"" and ""Reign"" fame is the creative force behind this episode; like the other writers/directors/producers involved with this project, he makes the segment with which he's involved indelibly his own.>The soundtrack CD that accompanies the DVD in this set is also a worthy purchase; I'm no fan of electronica music, but the works included in ""The Animatrix"" are tastefully selected and rank high within the echelon of great anime' soundtracks. The songs are prominently mixed within the movie's audio mix (with the exception of ""Hands Around My Throat"" by Death In Vegas, my personal favorite track) and are recognizable at once when listened to after viewing the movie.  The bonus, non-soundtrack selections inspired from the first ""Matrix"" movie (and including dialogue samples from it as well) ""Red Pill, Blue Pill"" and ""The Real"" cap off a terrific listening experience.>If you watch the movie and enjoy it, a prominent aspect for your enjoyment will undoubtedly be the soundtrack; I knew after a single viewing that I had to own the DVD as well as its score CD, and I am absolutely satisfied with both.",5,Major Multi-Media Masterpiece,1057190400,"07 3, 2003",2003,4029,"['have', 'admit', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'anticipating', 'release', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'Spring', '2003', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'effort', 'Sure', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'terrific', 'most', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'amazing', 'movie', 'eventually', 'disappeared', 'up', 'own', '@', 'rse', 'drowned', 'sea', 'metaphysical', 'philosophical', 'nospeak', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'story', 'introduced', 'original', 'Matrix', 'movie.', '>', 'Which', 'why', 'find', 'Animatrix', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'rewarding', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'was', 'skeptical', 'notion', 'animated', 'interpretation', 'Matrix', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'beautifully', 'presented', 'was', 'live', 'action', 'not', 'only', 'Animatrix', 'expand', 'dramatically', 'themes', 'first', 'Matrix', 'movie', 'expansion', 'also', 'stand', 'large', 'degree', 'independently', 'first', 'movie', 'altogether.', '>', 'Final', 'Flight', 'Osiris', 'program', 'graphics', 'are', 'amazing', 'enough', 'true', 'reason', 'episode', 'introduce', 'video', 'game', 'Enter', 'Matrix', 'show', 'off', 'animation', 'skills', 'creators', 'great', 'little', 'purpose.', '>', 'Second', 'Renaissance', 'Pts', 'II', 'more', 'explain', 'cirumstances', 'characters', 'Matrix', 'movies', 'have', 'found', 'extremely', 'well-thought', 'executed.', '>', 'Kid', 'Story', 'bit', 'Gen-X', 'take', 'awakening', 'experience', 'detailed', 'first', 'Matrix', 'movie', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'English', 'translations', 'are', 'nice', 'touch', '>', 'Program', 'variation', 'training', 'exercises', 'virtual', 'world', 'terrific', 'animation', 'folks', 'who', 'brought', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'D', 'Bloodlust', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', '>', 'World', 'Record', 'dismissed', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'be', 'interesting', 'take', 'awakening', 'theme.', '>', 'Beyond', 'was', 'first', 'episode', ""'d"", 'seen', 'collection', 'perhaps', 'most', 'original', 'interpretation', 'Matrix', 'themes', 'be', 'found', 'DVD', 'think', 'back', 'Neo', 'deja', 'vu', 'experience', 'first', 'movie', 'point-of-reference', 'many', 'aspects', 'story', 'have', 'other-worldly', 'applications', 'were', ""n't"", 'breached', 'Matrix', 'live-action', 'movie', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'most', 'Japanese', 'soul', 'entries', 'included', 'here.', '>', 'A', 'Detective', 'Story', 'obviously', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'folks', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'very', 'noir', 'very', 'pulp', 'fiction-esque', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'Slickly', 'done', 'favorite', 'episode', 'watch', 'just', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'production.', '>', 'Matriculated', 'collection', 'hallucinogenic', 'collection', 'images', 'begin', 'real', 'world', 'pick', 'up', 'nearly', 'lysergic', 'rate', 'training', 'exercise', 'session', 'one', 'designed', 'idea', 'converting', 'enemy', 'machines', 'side', 'human', 'beings', 'favorite', 'anime', 'artist', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Reign', 'fame', 'creative', 'force', 'episode', 'other', 'writers/directors/producers', 'involved', 'project', 'segment', 'involved', 'indelibly', 'own.', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'DVD', 'set', 'also', 'worthy', 'purchase', ""'m"", 'fan', 'electronica', 'music', 'works', 'included', 'Animatrix', 'are', 'tastefully', 'selected', 'rank', 'high', 'echelon', 'great', 'anime', 'soundtracks', 'songs', 'are', 'prominently', 'mixed', 'movie', 'audio', 'mix', 'exception', 'Hands', 'My', 'Throat', 'Death', 'Vegas', 'personal', 'favorite', 'track', 'are', 'recognizable', 'once', 'when', 'listened', 'viewing', 'movie', 'bonus', 'non-soundtrack', 'selections', 'inspired', 'first', 'Matrix', 'movie', 'including', 'dialogue', 'samples', 'as', 'well', 'Red', 'Pill', 'Blue', 'Pill', 'Real', 'cap', 'terrific', 'listening', 'experience.', '>', 'watch', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'prominent', 'aspect', 'enjoyment', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'soundtrack', 'knew', 'single', 'viewing', 'had', 'own', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'score', 'CD', 'am', 'absolutely', 'satisfied']",The Animatrix: Gift Set
752842,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000099635,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[0, 0]","In The Animatrix, the storyline of the Matrix trilogy is further expanded with 9 animated shorts by some of the best in the field.Each of the short films helps to explain a part of the Matrix that was glossed over in the movies, helping to enrich our understanding of what was going on and where these characters came from.A number of famous anime names were involved in this creation, including Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop), Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll), and Koji Morimoto (Robot Carnival). Because of this, each short has its own style, telling its own piece of the story in a unique way. This also means that some of the shorts are brilliant, but others are not quite as technically stellar.An example of how the shorts fill in pieces can be seen with Final Flight of the Osiris, created by Square Pictures (the guys behind the Final Fantasy movie). In the movie The Matrix Reloaded, things begin with a mysterious package that &quot;Thadeus&quot; got to a post office, sacrificing his entire crew to do. Pretty much nothing else is said about that - the story focusses on what the package held. To help clarify this background, the game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; is all about how Niobe and Ghost managed to get to this package in the post office, and get it out to safety.But Final Flight of the Osiris takes it one step further. It introduces us to Thadeus and his crew, and explains how they saw what they then felt was so important to tell others about. The only way they thought they could get the news to others was to put it in a package and drop the package into a mailbox - sending it to a secure post office box.So a character and situation that maybe got one line in the movie now takes on a life of its own - helping to explain further both the movie and the game.Matrix fans will love all of the extra information they're given by these shorts, and anime fans will love some of the gorgeous work shown by some of the best anime people around.Yes, they're short. And yes, they're not related to each other. But each is a small work of art that helps show just how amazingly far we've come in anime - and gives a hint of what is yet to come.",5,Small Works of Art,1055894400,"06 18, 2003",2003,2167,"['Animatrix', 'storyline', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'further', 'expanded', '9', 'animated', 'shorts', 'best', 'field.Each', 'short', 'films', 'explain', 'part', 'Matrix', 'was', 'glossed', 'movies', 'helping', 'enrich', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'where', 'characters', 'came', 'from.A', 'number', 'famous', 'anime', 'names', 'were', 'involved', 'creation', 'including', 'Shinchiro', 'Watanabe', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Yoshiaki', 'Kawajiri', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'Koji', 'Morimoto', 'Robot', 'Carnival', 'short', 'own', 'style', 'telling', 'own', 'piece', 'story', 'unique', 'way', 'also', 'shorts', 'are', 'brilliant', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'technically', 'stellar.An', 'example', 'how', 'shorts', 'fill', 'pieces', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Final', 'Flight', 'Osiris', 'created', 'Square', 'Pictures', 'guys', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'movie', 'movie', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'things', 'begin', 'mysterious', 'package', 'quot', 'Thadeus', 'quot', 'got', 'post', 'office', 'sacrificing', 'entire', 'crew', 'do', 'Pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'else', 'said', 'story', 'what', 'package', 'held', 'help', 'clarify', 'background', 'game', 'quot', 'Enter', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'how', 'Niobe', 'Ghost', 'managed', 'get', 'package', 'post', 'office', 'get', 'out', 'safety.But', 'Final', 'Flight', 'Osiris', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'Thadeus', 'crew', 'how', 'saw', 'what', 'then', 'felt', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'tell', 'others', 'only', 'way', 'thought', 'could', 'get', 'news', 'others', 'was', 'put', 'package', 'drop', 'package', 'mailbox', 'sending', 'secure', 'post', 'office', 'box.So', 'character', 'situation', 'maybe', 'got', 'one', 'line', 'movie', 'now', 'life', 'own', 'helping', 'explain', 'further', 'movie', 'game.Matrix', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'extra', 'information', ""'re"", 'given', 'shorts', 'anime', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'gorgeous', 'work', 'shown', 'best', 'anime', 'people', 'around.Yes', ""'re"", 'short', 'yes', ""'re"", 'not', 'related', 'other', 'small', 'work', 'art', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'amazingly', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'anime', 'hint', 'what', 'yet', 'come']",The Animatrix: Gift Set

The first movie to use bullet time, the first movie to bring comic book and anime storytelling to live action, etc. On it's own The Matrix is a landmark film and had the Wachowski brothers left it at that, it would have been enough. Little did we know in 1999 (the year the Matrix was released) that the brothers had much more in store for us.While doing a press junket in Japan, the Wachowski brothers took the opportunity to meet some of the directors of their favorite anime series and movies. On the plane ride back they hatched the idea that they would go beyond just the next two films that were planned to finish the trilogy. They decided to include anime and video games as additional mediums to tell their story. To my knowledge, no director has ever done this and this marks yet another first in the history of film.The Animatrix is a collection of short stories all told through animation. Most of the directors come from Japanese animation, or anime as it is typically called. For many viewers, this was their first introduction to anime. Titles such as Cowboy BeBop, Ghost In The Shell and Blue Submarine No. 6 may be completely foreign to most American audiences, but with the Animatrix, they were being introduced to some of the best anime directors in the world.Of the 9 segments contained in the Animatrix, only 4 of them were actually written by the Wachowski brothers. The other six were written by the Directors themselves. That being said, the Brothers did produce all of the segments to ensure that they other writers stayed true to the mythos of The Matrix. What the Wachowski brothers didn't do however was direct any of the segments. They actually turned over the reigns to the anime directors themselves. Not many directors would have been this collaborative, but it just goes to show what huge fans of anime the two brothers are.Now you might be thinking, &quot;Well, this is just a cartoon, so what does it really matter?&quot; Given the fact that they didn't direct them and only wrote 4 of the 9 segments, the Animatrix, it might appear that this is just some marketing ploy, or some fanciful project that doesn't relate to The Matrix Trilogy at all. That is not the case. The Animatrix contains stories that not only relate to the Matrix, but actually include story arcs that tie directly into the movies.Besides the 9 segments themselves, the DVD is jam packed with bonus materials. There are director commentaries for 4 segments as well as a history of Anime and a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary as well. If you like bonus materials on a DVD, you won't be disappointed in this one. There is also a package that includes a soundtrack to the Animatrix as well. The soundtrack is very good an includes some great techno music.All in all, if you're a fan of the Matrix, then this is a must have in your collection. Even if you're not a huge fan of the Matrix it's still worth a watch. The fact that the story for the Matrix Saga weaves excellently through the Animatrix, you don't know the whole story if you haven't seen this DVD. There are references to it in both The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. You're enjoyment of the movies will be that much more heightened as a result of it.",4,You don&#65533;t know the whole story if you haven&#65533;t seen this DVD.,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,3268,"['Matrix', 'had', 'lot', 'firsts', 'first', 'movie', 'use', 'bullet', 'time', 'first', 'movie', 'bring', 'comic', 'book', 'anime', 'storytelling', 'live', 'action', 'etc', 'own', 'Matrix', 'landmark', 'film', 'had', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'left', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'Little', 'did', 'know', '1999', 'year', 'Matrix', 'was', 'released', 'brothers', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'store', 'us.While', 'doing', 'press', 'junket', 'Japan', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'took', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'directors', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'movies', 'plane', 'ride', 'back', 'hatched', 'idea', 'would', 'go', 'just', 'next', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'planned', 'finish', 'trilogy', 'decided', 'include', 'anime', 'video', 'games', 'additional', 'mediums', 'tell', 'story', 'knowledge', 'director', 'ever', 'done', 'yet', 'first', 'history', 'film.The', 'Animatrix', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'told', 'animation', 'Most', 'directors', 'come', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'anime', 'typically', 'called', 'many', 'viewers', 'was', 'first', 'introduction', 'anime', 'Titles', 'such', 'Cowboy', 'BeBop', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'Blue', 'Submarine', 'No', '6', 'may', 'be', 'completely', 'foreign', 'most', 'American', 'audiences', 'Animatrix', 'were', 'being', 'introduced', 'best', 'anime', 'directors', 'world.Of', '9', 'segments', 'contained', 'Animatrix', 'only', '4', 'were', 'actually', 'written', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'other', 'six', 'were', 'written', 'Directors', 'being', 'said', 'Brothers', 'did', 'produce', 'segments', 'ensure', 'other', 'writers', 'stayed', 'true', 'mythos', 'Matrix', 'What', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'however', 'was', 'direct', 'segments', 'actually', 'turned', 'reigns', 'anime', 'directors', 'Not', 'many', 'directors', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'collaborative', 'just', 'show', 'what', 'huge', 'fans', 'anime', 'two', 'brothers', 'are.Now', 'might', 'be', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Well', 'just', 'cartoon', 'what', 'really', 'matter', 'quot', 'Given', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'only', 'wrote', '4', '9', 'segments', 'Animatrix', 'might', 'appear', 'just', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'fanciful', 'project', ""n't"", 'relate', 'Matrix', 'Trilogy', 'not', 'case', 'Animatrix', 'stories', 'not', 'only', 'relate', 'Matrix', 'actually', 'include', 'story', 'arcs', 'directly', 'movies.Besides', '9', 'segments', 'DVD', 'jam', 'packed', 'bonus', 'materials', 'are', 'director', 'commentaries', '4', 'segments', 'as', 'well', 'history', 'Anime', 'quot', 'making-of', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'like', 'bonus', 'materials', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'one', 'also', 'package', 'soundtrack', 'Animatrix', 'as', 'well', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'techno', 'music.All', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Matrix', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'collection', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Matrix', 'still', 'worth', 'watch', 'fact', 'story', 'Matrix', 'Saga', 'excellently', 'Animatrix', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'whole', 'story', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'are', 'references', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'Matrix', 'Revolutions', ""'re"", 'enjoyment', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'heightened', 'result']",The Animatrix: Gift Set

The last story is more comic book style, not so much animation.For those interested in the mythology of the Matrix, this movie will provide more insight in how the Matrix works and how it came into existence, we finally are shown the events that lead to machines taking over.

I don't think we'd get that stupid and let machines come that far. The orginal robot should have been taken apart to find out what went wrong and then all other machines should have been updated accordingly. If I had my way I'd write ""The Second Renaissance Part III"". Ideally we'd get Joe Pantoliano to do the voice. I'd go something like this.Fade in showing the machines digging. They find a bunker under ground. Inside is a skeleton of a long dead man and a recording device. The machines play the recording. (From the way the person is dressed in the recording and what's left of the skeleton, it's the same person.)Recording beings. (The speaker is drinking what appears to be scotch and is getting ""looser"" as the speech goes on.)(Speaker fills a glass)Senator Reagan: This is Senator Reagan, if you are watching this recording now it probably means that those damn machines took over and the human race is being slaughtered wholesale. I tried to stop them I really did. When that first thing was put on trial I ranted against it. That right, I called it a thing. That's all it is. Those damn liberals think these over grown TV's and toaster ovens should have rights. I said no and tore three part on the senate floor had them rebuilt. They worked fine. Try doing that to a flesh and blood human. That only made me look like a bad guy. Well excuse me for defending the human race. It should have been taken apart to see how it developed a sense of self-preservation. Isaac Asimov anybody??? I, Robot??? Ring any bells???? No...(Fills a glass again)We destroyed most of them but not enough of them. They moved to the Middle East and set up ""01"" and we let these little trash compactors get away with it. We let them set up industries. Why??? No one saw it coming. They didn't ""pay"" their workers the way we did. Their workers didn't sleep, eat, unionize... That was the first and only time I asked, ""Where's the damn union when you need it??"" Labor activists should have been up in arms over this. But they weren't. I was stunned at the lack of outrage.(Fills a glass, speech is slurring)We nuked them. The EPM, blast wave and heat got some but not all of them. We stopped. Why??? People were too afraid to let their source for cheap goods dry up. They offered the olive branch, and then we decide to get tough on them. It was already too late for that. I personally put forth a banishment idea. Get those walking microwaves ovens off the planet. They could go to the Moon, Mars, leave the solar system all together. They could see if we are alone in the universe, but no.We blackened the sky to stop them. I'd love to get my hands on the geniuses that thunk that one up. That's world government for ya.(Fills the glass and downs it in one gulp)Then things got really ugly, full-blown war. It started out looking like we might win this, but they were suckering us into a trap. They knew our weakness, their troops, if they can be call that didn't fear death. They can be put back together good as new. They unleashed plagues that made Ebola look like a skin rash. I even heard rumors that they stared using humans as a power source. That's rich, biometric energy it's called.(Grabs the bottle and drinks straight from it, speech impaired)It's getting very bleak now and I'm one of the lucky ones that got to hide were they would have a hard time finding me. If hiding makes me a coward so be it. I have no idea what's happening on the surface right now, but it's a good possibility that I could be the last ""free"" human on Earth. Funny, I'm free, but I'm trapped in a buried bunker. I only hope that humans are watching this and laughing their a$$es off at me, instead of those metal hunks of junk. If it is the machines, and I'm not a religious man, God have mercy on us all for what we have done and what we have failed to do.(Throws the bottle against the wall, hear it shatter)The speech ends, and it appears that the speaker has passed out.The recording ends.Machines move on.A little while later humans show up.

752848,A1VCLTAGM5RLND,B000099635,"Ronnie Clay ""R.C.""","[0, 3]","This dvd comes with a musical cd which is great now about this dvd. The U.S. people went to Japan to have them draw the cartoons of nine short movies that involes the Martix movies each with different stories. The americans wrote the stories. To tell what I think about each story look down below.FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS (8/10)-This one is the only one in 3D graphics I say it looks pretty good, I love it when while they were inside the ship shooting at the machines that were outside just like in the ""Matrix Revolutions"", the dissapointing thing was at the end they all died anyway.SECOND RENAISSANCE PART 1 & 2 (10/10)-This one is the best of all of them. I wish it was a movie of it's own making it to the big screen. The drawings were 100% perfect especially on how the United Nation building was drawn. Both 1 & 2 is telling you on how it all started when man invented machines to do work for them then on machine was the first to kill his master then all the humans were distorying the machines then the machine created a city for themselves to get back at humanity.KID'S STORY (7/10)-The animation was very good at first until the agents arived at this boys high school and started chasing him at his school he was running on his skate board thats when the picture started to look so blury and way out of drawn right which ruined it for me. This boy was a lost soul to commit suicide.PROGRAM (5/10)-For me it was ""ok"". I liked the fighting in the forest when that man and woman were knights to me those were good moves, the animation was a bit bad it looked like that anime show ""Regin"". The story was a bit entertaining when this man wanted this woman to come with him to leave the matrix she refuses then kills him, then she wakes up learns that it was all a test and she pass but she didn't took it too well.WORLD RECORD (4/10)-World Record was the worstest onw I hated out of the most. All it had was a man who was not suppose to race on his legs or else he could gets paralise for good he didn't listen when his legs started to break the whole picture started to look so stupid and weird it usually had nothing to do with the matrix movies. I always fast foward through this one movie what a waste. Also very bad animation.BEYOND (5.5/10)-It was just 50/50 for me. I could have been better. Just some girl who loses her cat she goes off to fine it in the ally with a bunch of kids playing and for some reason either they have magic powers or were they was at gravity is not a law I didn't get.A DETECTIVE STORY (6/10)-I feel the same way about this one. Some detective is going after a computer hacker. It starts to get interesting when he meets Trinity on the train then the agents started shooting at her and him was my favorite part. Trinity her animated version looked very good in this movie.MATRICULATED (6/10)-Don't know much to say about the last movie except it was alright. They were turing machines programing them to be on their side for a change. In the end all of the people died from fighting the evil machines, the only left alive was one machine which looked heart broken seeing that woman died.",5,U.S. and Japanese anime,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,3129,"['dvd', 'musical', 'cd', 'great', 'now', 'dvd', 'U.S.', 'people', 'went', 'Japan', 'have', 'draw', 'cartoons', 'nine', 'short', 'movies', 'Martix', 'movies', 'different', 'stories', 'americans', 'wrote', 'stories', 'tell', 'what', 'think', 'story', 'look', 'down', 'below.FINAL', 'FLIGHT', 'THE', 'OSIRIS', '8/10', '-This', 'one', 'only', 'one', '3D', 'graphics', 'say', 'pretty', 'good', 'love', 'when', 'were', 'ship', 'shooting', 'machines', 'were', 'outside', 'just', 'Matrix', 'Revolutions', 'dissapointing', 'thing', 'was', 'end', 'died', 'anyway.SECOND', 'RENAISSANCE', 'PART', '1', '2', '10/10', '-This', 'one', 'best', 'wish', 'was', 'movie', 'own', 'making', 'big', 'screen', 'drawings', 'were', '100', '%', 'perfect', 'especially', 'how', 'United', 'Nation', 'building', 'was', 'drawn', '1', '2', 'telling', 'how', 'started', 'when', 'man', 'invented', 'machines', 'do', 'work', 'then', 'machine', 'was', 'first', 'kill', 'master', 'then', 'humans', 'were', 'distorying', 'machines', 'then', 'machine', 'created', 'city', 'get', 'back', 'humanity.KID', 'STORY', '7/10', '-The', 'animation', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'first', 'agents', 'arived', 'boys', 'high', 'school', 'started', 'chasing', 'school', 'was', 'running', 'skate', 'board', 'when', 'picture', 'started', 'look', 'so', 'blury', 'way', 'drawn', 'right', 'ruined', 'boy', 'was', 'lost', 'soul', 'commit', 'suicide.PROGRAM', '5/10', '-For', 'was', 'ok', 'liked', 'fighting', 'forest', 'when', 'man', 'woman', 'were', 'knights', 'were', 'good', 'moves', 'animation', 'was', 'bit', 'bad', 'looked', 'anime', 'show', 'Regin', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'entertaining', 'when', 'man', 'wanted', 'woman', 'come', 'leave', 'matrix', 'then', 'then', 'up', 'learns', 'was', 'test', 'pass', 'did', ""n't"", 'took', 'too', 'well.WORLD', 'RECORD', '4/10', '-World', 'Record', 'was', 'worstest', 'onw', 'hated', 'most', 'All', 'had', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'suppose', 'race', 'legs', 'else', 'could', 'paralise', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'when', 'legs', 'started', 'break', 'whole', 'picture', 'started', 'look', 'so', 'stupid', 'weird', 'usually', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'matrix', 'movies', 'always', 'fast', 'foward', 'one', 'movie', 'what', 'waste', 'Also', 'very', 'bad', 'animation.BEYOND', '5.5/10', '-It', 'was', 'just', '50/50', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Just', 'girl', 'who', 'cat', 'off', 'fine', 'ally', 'bunch', 'kids', 'playing', 'reason', 'have', 'magic', 'powers', 'were', 'was', 'gravity', 'not', 'law', 'did', ""n't"", 'get.A', 'DETECTIVE', 'STORY', '6/10', '-I', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'one', 'detective', 'going', 'computer', 'hacker', 'get', 'interesting', 'when', 'Trinity', 'train', 'then', 'agents', 'started', 'shooting', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'Trinity', 'animated', 'version', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'movie.MATRICULATED', '6/10', '-Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'say', 'last', 'movie', 'was', 'alright', 'were', 'turing', 'machines', 'programing', 'be', 'side', 'change', 'end', 'people', 'died', 'fighting', 'evil', 'machines', 'only', 'left', 'alive', 'was', 'one', 'machine', 'looked', 'heart', 'broken', 'seeing', 'woman', 'died']",The Animatrix: Gift Set

752850,AWGPEXO9M8R7Q,B000099635,Stephen M. Sturgeon,"[0, 2]","This is a great DVD for a fan of the Matrix or for introducing someone to anime. If you're a fan of the Matrix, it answers some of the unanswered questions from the movies. &quot;We don't know who struck first, us or them. But we do know it was us that scorched the sky.&quot; Thanks to &quot;Second Renaissance,&quot; now we know who struck first and more.If you want to introduce someone to anime, this is also good because of the diversity in this DVD. Each segment shows a differant aspect of what anime has to offer. It's like a really nice sampler platter to help whet the appetite.There's only reason I didn't give five stars. Some segments were way too compact for the amount of story they were trying to cram in.  To be fair, there's only so much story you can cram into a 9-16 minute frame of time. That these writers/directors were able to do as much with their segments as they did is a real testiment to their skill.A word on the sound track, it's definetely worth the extra bit of cash. With 12 tracks including &quot;Meat Beat Manifesto&quot; and &quot;Juno Reactor,&quot; it's a great listen to.",4,Nice anime sampler platter,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,1111,"['great', 'DVD', 'fan', 'Matrix', 'introducing', 'someone', 'anime', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Matrix', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'movies', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'struck', 'first', 'do', 'know', 'was', 'scorched', 'sky.', 'quot', 'Thanks', 'quot', 'Second', 'Renaissance', 'quot', 'now', 'know', 'who', 'struck', 'first', 'more.If', 'want', 'introduce', 'someone', 'anime', 'also', 'good', 'diversity', 'DVD', 'segment', 'differant', 'aspect', 'what', 'anime', 'offer', 'really', 'nice', 'sampler', 'platter', 'help', 'whet', 'appetite.There', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'segments', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'compact', 'amount', 'story', 'were', 'trying', 'cram', 'be', 'fair', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'can', 'cram', '9-16', 'minute', 'frame', 'time', 'writers/directors', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'segments', 'did', 'real', 'testiment', 'skill.A', 'word', 'sound', 'track', 'definetely', 'worth', 'extra', 'bit', 'cash', '12', 'tracks', 'including', 'quot', 'Meat', 'Beat', 'Manifesto', 'quot', 'quot', 'Juno', 'Reactor', 'quot', 'great', 'listen']",The Animatrix: Gift Set
