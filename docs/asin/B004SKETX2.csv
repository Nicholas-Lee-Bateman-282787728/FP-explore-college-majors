Also, it was very well made:* Well-written script* Good acting* The depiction of meth life seemed very realistic* Characters were well balanced, e.g., the bad guys were not over-the-top bad, nor cartoonish* The way the good characters persevered was edifyingMovies about pathetic losers are usually unbearable to me, and I quickly turn those movies off (e.g., many of Nick Nolte's characters).  Somehow, this movie is different.  Although the story was disturbing, the overall tone was encouraging, e.g., the way the good guys persevered and the bad guys perished.",5,"Very well made.

Anson plays a drug user that is not concerned about his nephew or his daughter and the tribulations they go through.  Not a movie for kids since there is language and a very disturbing rape but it is a movie you must not miss,5,Love/hate this movie,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,340,"['So', 'good', 'so', 'disturbing', 'Anson', 'Mounts', 'performance', 'amazing', 'Hard', 'watch', 'times', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Anson', 'drug', 'user', 'not', 'concerned', 'nephew', 'daughter', 'tribulations', 'go', 'Not', 'movie', 'kids', 'language', 'very', 'disturbing', 'rape', 'movie', 'must', 'not', 'miss']",Cook County

The first reviewer was perhaps commenting on the depth of human depravity in this film, which is indeed abhorrent and revolting, rather than dismissing the brilliant performances that bring this all-too-real story to life.The story, dialogue and mood of Cook County could easily be a documentary of rural East Texas drug life with it's broken, neglected children and men who've devolved into human parasites, draining the life out of all who dare to come near them.I can testify to having witnessed the exact drug-addled ramblings of Anson Mount's addict, which he plays with such blistering reality it boggles the mind.  I cannot imagine the writer making this up, pulling only from his imagination, for these exact words are uttered inside these same filthy infested homes by these very depths of human ugliness, not just in East Texas where I saw and ran from it myself, but across the country in counties of every state.  No special effects are needed for this journey into drug hell, because the reality of this story is horrific enough on its own with no embellishment required.Anson Mount is an actor not to be missed, an actor who cannot be ignored for he is mesmerizing on the screen.  Those in need of more from this delicious man should consider the entire Hell on Wheels series, even for those like me who are not huge fans all things Old West.  One episode in, and I was hooked nonstop until the very last scene of the very last season.Anson Mount is magical with the ease in which he embodies his characters. I anxiously await more of his work, but this is one actor who does not accept every script that comes along, so my patience comes in knowing whatever comes next will be spectacular.",5,ANSON MOUNT - ADDICT PERSONIFIED,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,1847,"['Simply', 'could', 'not', 'abide', 'work', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'being', 'left', 'wither', 'die', 'due', 'having', 'just', 'one', 'single', 'review', 'containing', 'one', 'single', 'star', 'first', 'reviewer', 'was', 'perhaps', 'commenting', 'depth', 'human', 'depravity', 'film', 'indeed', 'abhorrent', 'revolting', 'rather', 'dismissing', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'bring', 'all-too-real', 'story', 'life.The', 'story', 'dialogue', 'mood', 'Cook', 'County', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'documentary', 'rural', 'East', 'Texas', 'drug', 'life', 'broken', 'neglected', 'children', 'men', 'who', ""'ve"", 'devolved', 'human', 'parasites', 'draining', 'life', 'who', 'dare', 'come', 'them.I', 'can', 'testify', 'having', 'witnessed', 'exact', 'drug-addled', 'ramblings', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'addict', 'such', 'blistering', 'reality', 'mind', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'writer', 'making', 'up', 'pulling', 'only', 'imagination', 'exact', 'words', 'are', 'uttered', 'same', 'filthy', 'infested', 'homes', 'very', 'depths', 'human', 'ugliness', 'not', 'just', 'East', 'Texas', 'where', 'saw', 'ran', 'country', 'counties', 'state', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'needed', 'journey', 'drug', 'hell', 'reality', 'story', 'horrific', 'enough', 'own', 'embellishment', 'required.Anson', 'Mount', 'actor', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'mesmerizing', 'screen', 'need', 'more', 'delicious', 'man', 'should', 'consider', 'entire', 'Hell', 'Wheels', 'series', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'huge', 'fans', 'things', 'Old', 'West', 'One', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'nonstop', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'very', 'last', 'season.Anson', 'Mount', 'magical', 'ease', 'characters', 'anxiously', 'await', 'more', 'work', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'not', 'accept', 'script', 'along', 'patience', 'knowing', 'next', 'will', 'be', 'spectacular']",Cook County

Again even the small stand in's had the ""authentic"" feel to them.  I enjoyed ""Hell on Wheels"" mainly because of Anson Mount, and I rented this film mainly because of his casting.....he delivered one amazing performance, and is now one of my favorite actors.
