I remember seeing the first one and thinking 'It's good', but when i saw this one, i was blown away. Better actors, better story and better costumes, not forgetting better action. It's so involving you wish you where the Guyver. David Hayter is a vast improvement on the original guy who played Sean Barker, and just in case you didn't know, David Hayter wrote the screen play for the excellent X-Men movie and did the voice of Solid Snake for Metal Gear Solid one and two. I didn't see the anime series until a few years later and was blown away by that to. So to all you anime/sci-fi fans, i recommend you buy this one, and get the first one, if only to make sure you know what's going on in Guyver 2. Even though it's been 10 years, i still hope they get round to doing a third Guyver to bring it full circle. Well, go on, buy it.

The dig uncovers a derelict alien spacecraft that houses the secrets behind The Guyver and Sean's shape-shifting enemies. THE GUYVER 2 drops the silly slapstick and humor that hampered the first film in place of a darker atmosphere and mood that is much more in line with the original source material. While acting and writing only show minor improvements, the fight choreography in Steve Wang's action sequences have improved dramatically, and the deaths of the creatures are far more gruesome than before. Wang's own design crew has stepped in for Screaming Mad George, proving that they are more than competent as they produce equally stunning costuming and monster effects that rival the best Hollywood has to offer. The new Guyver suit is more lightweight and maneuverable, and allows martial artist Anthony Houk with a greater range of motion and control. Its features have also been exaggerated, with longer blades and increased muscle tone. Finally, the unique set designs for the alien craft that were created on the film's small budget are just as impressive. THE GUYVER 2 is a fast-paced and action-packed super-hero sequel that is a vast improvement over the original film.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,The Guyver 2,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,1429,"['order', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'new', 'found', 'powers', 'Sean', 'Barker', 'mountains', 'Utah', 'visit', 'archaeological', 'dig', 'where', 'sightings', 'monstrous', 'Zoanoids', 'have', 'been', 'reported', 'locals', 'dig', 'derelict', 'alien', 'spacecraft', 'houses', 'secrets', 'Guyver', 'Sean', 'shape-shifting', 'enemies', 'GUYVER', '2', 'silly', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'hampered', 'first', 'film', 'place', 'darker', 'atmosphere', 'mood', 'much', 'more', 'line', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'acting', 'writing', 'only', 'show', 'minor', 'improvements', 'fight', 'choreography', 'Steve', 'Wang', 'action', 'sequences', 'have', 'improved', 'dramatically', 'deaths', 'creatures', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'gruesome', 'before', 'Wang', 'own', 'design', 'crew', 'stepped', 'Screaming', 'Mad', 'George', 'proving', 'are', 'more', 'competent', 'produce', 'equally', 'stunning', 'costuming', 'monster', 'effects', 'rival', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'offer', 'new', 'Guyver', 'suit', 'more', 'lightweight', 'maneuverable', 'martial', 'artist', 'Anthony', 'Houk', 'greater', 'range', 'motion', 'control', 'features', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'exaggerated', 'longer', 'blades', 'increased', 'muscle', 'tone', 'Finally', 'unique', 'set', 'designs', 'alien', 'craft', 'were', 'created', 'film', 'small', 'budget', 'are', 'just', 'impressive', 'GUYVER', '2', 'fast-paced', 'action-packed', 'super-hero', 'sequel', 'vast', 'improvement', 'original', 'film.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Guyver 2: Dark Hero VHS

While the first film was dopey, this one was mopey.  Even worse, the plot was infinitely forgettable.

The effects and monster costumes are also about Power Ranger levels though some of the effects especially with the blood is actually somewhat better as well as the Guyver fight scenes too.  The video quality is probably the biggest complaint I got as it looks like it was just transferred from a VHS tape to dvd as when you watch the scenes half of them have a bit of graininess in them though it's not to bad as you can still see most of the scenes without to much distortions during those scenes.  The audio is pretty good though no distortions or level drops to worry about,  so if you're a fan of the Guyver series or Power Rangers or just looking for a campy semi-decent action flick here's a good choice though I'd advise trying to see if you can get it for at least $20.00 dollars or lower....",4,For What The Movie Is It Actually Is Pretty Good,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,1226,"['first', 'live', 'action', 'Guyver', 'movie', 'toned', 'down', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'sequel', 'more', 'then', 'up', 'None', 'actors', 'actresses', 'very', 'memorable', 'have', 'rank', 'acting', 'abilities', 'would', 'put', 'least', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'level', 'meaning', 'not', 'most', 'terrible', 'actors', 'greatest', 'either', 'again', 'watch', 'movie', 'passable', 'enough', 'where', 'irritate', 'effects', 'monster', 'costumes', 'are', 'also', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'levels', 'effects', 'especially', 'blood', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'Guyver', 'fight', 'scenes', 'too', 'video', 'quality', 'probably', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'got', 'was', 'just', 'transferred', 'VHS', 'tape', 'dvd', 'when', 'watch', 'scenes', 'half', 'have', 'bit', 'graininess', 'not', 'bad', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'most', 'scenes', 'much', 'distortions', 'scenes', 'audio', 'pretty', 'good', 'distortions', 'level', 'drops', 'worry', 'about', 'so', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Guyver', 'series', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'just', 'looking', 'campy', 'semi-decent', 'action', 'flick', 'here', 'good', 'choice', ""'d"", 'advise', 'trying', 'see', 'can', 'get', 'least', '20.00', 'dollars', 'lower']",Guyver 2: Dark Hero VHS

Acting is somewhat kinda iffy sometimes. But good non the less! I was dissapointed that Guyver III wasn't in the movie. I mean I figred sence they did the 1st one they would bring more people from the original anime adult cartoons. Over all freaking 5 stars its one of the best movies out there. I say buy this and buy the DVD Set for the Anime version I kinda think it's better than the movies. And if you are pleased with Dark Hero and all 12 episodes, then get the 1st live action Guyver movie.",5,GUYVER!,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,621,"['Alright', 'here', 'Deal', 'Guyver', '1', '1st', 'movie', 'was', 'alright', 'Guyver', '2', 'Dark', 'Hero', 'BIG', 'STEP', 'UP', 'great', 'movie', 'Acting', 'somewhat', 'kinda', 'iffy', 'sometimes', 'good', 'non', 'less', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'Guyver', 'III', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'mean', 'figred', 'sence', 'did', '1st', 'one', 'would', 'bring', 'more', 'people', 'original', 'anime', 'adult', 'cartoons', 'freaking', '5', 'stars', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'say', 'buy', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Set', 'Anime', 'version', 'kinda', 'think', 'better', 'movies', 'are', 'pleased', 'Dark', 'Hero', '12', 'episodes', 'then', 'get', '1st', 'live', 'action', 'Guyver', 'movie']",Guyver 2: Dark Hero VHS

You no longer get the over-emphasised transformation and the humour, but in place you have  fantastic actions and a good plot.You can be fulfilled with Guyver 1 if  you're simply looking for special effects, but if you're looking for  genuine sci-fi actions with a strong storyline, then this sequel is a  must.Defintely one of the best sequels.

However the factory went over board with cutting through the barcodes as it went through the DVD Case sleeve and went through the actual case as well! Many people have been complaining about this and I can see why... When I order something I expect the item to be NEW and UNDAMAGED! Do they have to be that lazy to take a knife and slice away? Companies are suppose to be using a MARKER for the barcode... This prevents damage to the case... It's real simple...As for the dvd itself... It could of been better... It was bare bones... No extras at all... That to me is a sloppy job... They could of added some cast interviews, art galleries ect...
