Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 5]","If you have children or run across Nickelodeon (older folks like me might recognize it as ""Nick At Nite""), you're probably aware of ""Drake and Josh.""  The show gives the audience a comedic glimpse into the lives of two stepbrothers (Drake Bell and Josh Peck) and how they deal with the growing pains of teenage life and a little sister, the wickedly funny Megan (Miranda Cosgrove).  In ""Drake and Josh Go Hollywood,"" which is essentially an expanded version of one of the show's episodes, Drake and Josh merely have to put their sister on a plane to Denver and then they'll have the house to theirselves for a few days while their parents are away.  Of course, if you have watched the show, you know that they're bound to screw up something.  In typical Drake and Josh fashion, they screw up royally.  They manage to put their sister on a plane to Los Angeles, get tied up into a money-printing scam and have to resolve both of those problems in time to get Drake on the set of TRL to do a live performance.  Sounds completely unbelievable, right?  It's just another day in the life of these guys.This movie has played on Nick on a number of occasions, and it doesn't stray at all from the ""Drake and Josh"" formula.  It has plenty of slapstick comedy executed perfectly by the two heroes of the tale (Megan refers to them lovingly as ""boobs."")  Bell and Peck are truly funny young individuals.  Cosgrove is funny as well as the always confident, always lethal Megan.  The great thing about this show is that it plays out well for younger audiences but is actually pretty funny for folks over the age of eighteen.  In fact, I personally know a few people who are well over the legal drinking limit that love to watch the series.Parents don't have to worry about Drake, Josh, or anybody else going too far into adult (or even late teen) territory with their humor or language.  My daughter, aged six, loves to watch this movie and I like watching it with her.  I have no problem leaving the room while this movie is playing.Overall, this is a good purchase for families who enjoy watching movies together.  Bell and Peck are a likeable duo and I expect to see both of them going far in their future careers.",4,"The Simpler The Task, The More Chaotic They Make It",1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,2205,"['have', 'children', 'run', 'Nickelodeon', 'older', 'folks', 'might', 'recognize', 'Nick', 'Nite', ""'re"", 'probably', 'aware', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'show', 'audience', 'comedic', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'two', 'stepbrothers', 'Drake', 'Bell', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'how', 'deal', 'growing', 'pains', 'teenage', 'life', 'little', 'sister', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'Megan', 'Miranda', 'Cosgrove', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'Go', 'Hollywood', 'essentially', 'expanded', 'version', 'one', 'show', 'episodes', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'merely', 'have', 'put', 'sister', 'plane', 'Denver', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'house', 'theirselves', 'few', 'days', 'parents', 'are', 'away', 'course', 'have', 'watched', 'show', 'know', ""'re"", 'bound', 'screw', 'up', 'something', 'typical', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'fashion', 'screw', 'up', 'royally', 'manage', 'put', 'sister', 'plane', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'get', 'tied', 'up', 'money-printing', 'scam', 'have', 'resolve', 'problems', 'time', 'get', 'Drake', 'set', 'TRL', 'do', 'live', 'performance', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'right', 'just', 'day', 'life', 'guys.This', 'movie', 'played', 'Nick', 'number', 'occasions', ""n't"", 'stray', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'formula', 'plenty', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'executed', 'perfectly', 'two', 'heroes', 'tale', 'Megan', 'refers', 'lovingly', 'boobs', 'Bell', 'Peck', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'young', 'individuals', 'Cosgrove', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'confident', 'always', 'lethal', 'Megan', 'great', 'thing', 'show', 'out', 'well', 'younger', 'audiences', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'folks', 'age', 'eighteen', 'fact', 'personally', 'know', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'well', 'legal', 'drinking', 'limit', 'love', 'watch', 'series.Parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'anybody', 'else', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'adult', 'even', 'late', 'teen', 'territory', 'humor', 'language', 'daughter', 'aged', 'six', 'watch', 'movie', 'like', 'watching', 'have', 'problem', 'leaving', 'room', 'movie', 'playing.Overall', 'good', 'purchase', 'families', 'who', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movies', 'together', 'Bell', 'Peck', 'are', 'likeable', 'duo', 'expect', 'see', 'going', 'far', 'future', 'careers']",N/A
