The DVD probably has closed captions.Based on true case from 1982.  There is very little ""fiction"" in this script.  It is an accurate portrayal of what happens when innocent parents are accused of child abuse.  Children (6 & 9) were coerced by CPS & mostly by an unethical ADA to lie.  ""They yell at us and threaten us until we agree with them.""Memorable Lines which in particular strike me as true also based on my own personal experience in Los Angeles, circa 2008:Brandon, ""I don't know what's true anymore.""Brandon, ""I've been confused for a long time about what went on...what I said...who told me what...I'm still confused.  Now when I think about it, I know only one thing for sure, if those things happened to me...I'd remember.  What I do remember is that one day they walked in and they stole my parents.  The two most powerful people in my world.  That terrified me beyond words.  Now what do we do?""Spoken at age 19, after being a US Marine for a year.  This is an active example of Tzeddaka.  Tzeddaka is righting the wrongs.This case happened 26 years before ours.  I was never accused of any crime, sex or otherwise.  I and my son now both accuse County of sex crimes against us.  County has avoided service for over 3 months, costing me so far $328 to pay process servers to chase them around Los Angeles, as they lie to each process server about who is the agent to receive the Summons issued four months ago.  A declaration of due diligence is on file in the federal court.I did get my child back within four months.  All else happened in Los Angeles (all the same procedural abuses by county), 26 years AFTER these events, and it is still going on today, unless parents stand up and stop the County from persecuting parents.  Brainwashing and coercion are still not only going on right now, it's public policy.  Change it.If you are a California or Los Angeles parent who has had a child taken for no good reason, please, I beg of you, contact USDC Central in Los Angeles and join my class action now!  Look for me on FaceBook and Change.org!In my most humblest of opinions, these two parents should be nominated for sainthood for their steadfast faith.  Brendon portrayed by Cody Dorkin (9) and by Scott Baily (15-21) looks, sounds and acts very much like my own son at 13, while undergoing very similar brainwashing and coercion by LAPD and CPS in Los Angeles in 2008.  He has so testified and his declaration is on file in the court right now.  I await Judge Dolly Gee's new ruling in Ovitsky v. State of California.God only tested Job for seven years, but He tested Dick & Brenda Kniffen for TEN long years.  So far, my personal test has been for about 3.5 years.  But it's not just my test, is it?  Do other customers/viewers know someone falsely accused? Know of a child wrongfully removed? Encourage those individuals now to come forward please, to speak and be heard in public.  To right the wrongs of injustice.I note that: Habeus Corpus.  Explained in this film as ""Things not handled in the original trial.  New evidence.""  Brainwashing.  Exculpatory evidence ignored.  The new evidence in the Kniffen case was scientific evidence about coercion and brainwashing. Specifically, ""wink"" response was not indicative/proof of sodomy.  Parents sentenced to 240 years in prison each based on ""expert"" testimony that said since boys ""winked"" they must have been sodomized...each boy asked over 340 leading questions, ""terrified,"" not to answer as ADA requested...)  Boys were badgered until they agreed.  ADA trapped boys in rooms for hours tampering with them as witnesses...not allowing any defense examination of the same witnesses by the pediatrician, the teacher, clergy, etc.Brandon, ""I was terrified not to answer as they wanted...I wanted to go back to my parents, for that I would have said anything, done anything...""So if I fail now in my current complaint, then I suppose according to this script, Los Angeles prosecution failed to preserve my right to present witnesses was violated as well as cross exam of County ""Investigator"" who failed to show up (just as in Kern/Kniffen) despite court ORDER. Prosecution/county's failure to turn over exculpatory evidence in MY case (Zinn)IS grounds for Habeus Corpus. Thanks for that info....Film notably quotes Justice Brandeis, ""The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in the insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning, but without understanding.""Fogarty-Hardwick had same thing happen to her in Orange County within my recent memory.  She was separated from her two children for 6 years.  Her case not published...but you can google it or I can email you a copy, also a real case, and very recent.""Two little boys, were ripped from their loving home.  Isolated, frightened.  Bounced from foster home to foster home.  While being used to convict and imprison their parents.  Two little boys, all the while believing that when this was over, they would be reunited with their parents and go home.  Were these kids abused? Yes, your honor, they sure were...""Read what it says on the screen at the end there...the Kniffens did finally sue Kern County for civil rights violations, ""settled for an undisclosed sum...."" When? Some time in the 90s.  But it is still going on now.  I wonder how long the average parent has to wait to get justice?I rest my case.  Not a film for the average person or the average evening's entertainment, but I give it 5 stars for vindication of innocent parents, and for providing me with yet another role model.  Steadfast, faithful individuals like the Kniffens are preciously hard to come by.Shalom from Aloha, Oregona.j. ovitsky",5,True Story,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,5743,"['Just', 'Ask', 'My',

724173,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B0000714DW,Don R. Holloway,"[5, 6]","This movie is based on the real-life case of Brenda and Scott Kniffen who were arrested and taken from their home and charged with child molestation even though the authorities had no evidence whatsoever to support the charges. The Kniffen's two sons, Brandon and Brian, were removed from the home and placed in protective custody. Over a period of weeks the boys were constantly badgered and coerced into giving false testimony in the belief that they would be allowed to go home to their parents if they said the ""right"" things. The Kern County authorities committed outrageous abuses of power against innocent citizens and sent them to prison for crimes they didn't commit. This era was known by some as the ""child sex wars"" of the 1980s. Some called it ""witch hunts."" I lived in California for 20 years, including the decade of the 1980s, so I am more than a little familiar with all that went on. Sadly, as we can see in this movie, the only abuse these children received was from the very system that was meant to protect them. And the scary thing is that something like this could have happened to anybody. You didn't have to be guilty of a crime to be sent to prison. If the District Attorney's office wanted you in prison, then you would go to prison. And they would abuse your children while you were locked away. And it was pointed out at the end of this film that many victims of these ""witch hunts"" are still in prison because they have no way to prove their innocence. Please note that this movie was made in 2001. We usually associate these kinds of things with more primative, third-world countries, or with countries ruled by tyrannical dictators. We don't want to believe that things like this can happen in the United States of America. But sadly, my friends, these things do happen here. Dozens of people in this country have been executed for crimes they did not commit, and then were later found to be innocent. How do you bring someone back to life when you discover that they were unjustly put to death. If this film makes you think about our justice system and see it as an imperfect entity, then something good has come from the suffering of those who were abused by the system. You might ask if we can ever have a perfect justice system. Unfortunately, the answer is ""no."" But we can strive to make our system the best it can be. And movies like this one can help us to understand where we are going wrong. We can learn from our mistakes. Please watch this movie. It is a difficult movie to watch. You will be sad and angry and outraged and bewildered by all you see. But watch it anyway because it is worth the effort in order to gain insight into how to make our society a better place. I know this is a rather long review, but I hope it has been a help to some of you out there. And I hope this movie will open your mind as much as it did mine. Let us hope that we will learn from our history so that we will not be doomed to repeat it.",5,The Kern County Witchhunts,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,2966,"['movie', 'based', 'real-life', 'case', 'Brenda', 'Scott', 'Kniffen', 'who', 'were', 'arrested', 'taken', 'home', 'charged', 'child', 'molestation', 'even', 'authorities', 'had', 'evidence', 'whatsoever', 'support', 'charges', 'Kniffen', 'two', 'sons', 'Brandon', 'Brian', 'were', 'removed', 'home', 'placed', 'protective', 'custody', 'period', 'weeks', 'boys', 'were', 'constantly', 'badgered', 'coerced', 'giving', 'false', 'testimony', 'belief', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'go', 'home', 'parents', 'said', 'right', 'things', 'Kern', 'County', 'authorities', 'committed', 'outrageous', 'abuses', 'power', 'innocent', 'citizens', 'sent', 'prison', 'crimes', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'era', 'was', 'known', 'child', 'sex', 'wars', '1980s', 'called', 'witch', 'hunts', 'lived', 'California', '20', 'years', 'including', 'decade', '1980s', 'so', 'am', 'more', 'little', 'familiar', 'went', 'Sadly', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'only', 'abuse', 'children', 'received', 'was', 'very', 'system', 'was', 'meant', 'protect', 'scary', 'thing', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'anybody', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'guilty', 'crime', 'be', 'sent', 'prison', 'District', 'Attorney', 'office', 'wanted', 'prison', 'then', 'would', 'go', 'prison', 'would', 'abuse', 'children', 'were', 'locked', 'away', 'was', 'pointed', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'many', 'victims', 'witch', 'hunts', 'are', 'still', 'prison', 'have', 'way', 'prove', 'innocence', 'Please', 'note', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '2001', 'usually', 'associate', 'kinds', 'things', 'more', 'primative', 'third-world', 'countries', 'countries', 'ruled', 'tyrannical', 'dictators', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'sadly', 'friends', 'things', 'do', 'happen', 'here', 'Dozens', 'people', 'country', 'have', 'been', 'executed', 'crimes', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'then', 'were', 'later', 'found', 'be', 'innocent', 'How', 'do', 'bring', 'someone', 'back', 'life', 'when', 'discover', 'were', 'unjustly', 'put', 'death', 'film', 'think', 'justice', 'system', 'see', 'imperfect', 'entity', 'then', 'something', 'good', 'come', 'suffering', 'who', 'were', 'abused', 'system', 'might', 'ask', 'can', 'ever', 'have', 'perfect', 'justice', 'system', 'Unfortunately', 'answer', 'can', 'strive', 'make', 'system', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'movies', 'one', 'can', 'help', 'understand', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'wrong', 'can', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'Please', 'watch', 'movie', 'difficult', 'movie', 'watch', 'will', 'be', 'sad', 'angry', 'outraged', 'bewildered', 'see', 'watch', 'anyway', 'effort', 'order', 'gain', 'insight', 'how', 'make', 'society', 'better', 'place', 'know', 'rather', 'long', 'review', 'hope', 'been', 'help', 'there', 'hope', 'movie', 'will', 'open', 'mind', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'mine', 'Let', 'hope', 'will', 'learn', 'history', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'doomed', 'repeat']",N/A

This family suffered greatly, but they were not alone.  The McMartin trial comes to mind.  It was, indeed, exactly like the witch hunts in Salem Massachusetts.  The saddest part is that children are very suggestable.  Well-intentioned but misguided psychiatrists planted thoughts in many children's minds of abuse that never happened. As with the oldest son in this family, confusion reigned in their minds as to whether or not it actually happened.  Families were torn apart and lives destroyed or permanently damaged.  Time is one thing no one can get back once it has passed.  These children were torn from their parents with NO proof of any wrong doing.  The accusations of a mentally deranged grandmother were outrageous, but the Kern County police just raced forward like a bunch of drunken zealots.  The head prosecutor even said this case could be ""career making"".  Well, it wasn't as he was forced to resign.This movie is excellently acted and not only portrays the horrible side of such an incident, but the fact that the parents could still hang onto hope and their faith, even in the most preposterous and trying of situations.An egregious wrong was done this family, but it has been righted as best as it can be.
