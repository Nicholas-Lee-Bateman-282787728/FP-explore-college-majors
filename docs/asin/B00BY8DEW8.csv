Although a little downbeat in the beginning as it goes along it becomes a great film with a roller coaster of emotions. Both leads Colin Firth and Emily Blunt are British and they transform themselves into being Americans. The casting is inspired and although I do not think this film will get the viewing it deserves it is in my library and I will watch it again. It is a a gem of a film and am sure that when you have seen it you will enjoy.

1640954,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BY8DEW8,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Director Dante Ariola may not have a lot of credentials as yet, but taking chances with stories such as this one written by Becky Johnston (Seven Years in Tibet, The Prince of Tides, etc), stories that dare take the unexpected path for how people are finding the human condition rather chaotic, suggests that we have a very creative artist in the making. Blessed with a quartet of fine actors in the leading roles and a small but impressive supporting cast, this film is just far enough off center to make it refreshingly refreshing.The story follows the mid-life travails of sad sack FedEx floor manager Wallace Avery (Colin Firth) who is estranged from his ex-wife and angry young son Grant (Sterling Beaumon) and spends his time with his `lover' Mina (Anne Heche in a fine performance) who loves him despite the fact that Wallace is boring. He decides to refuse to face a life he hates, stages his own death and buys himself a new identity as Arthur Newman. However, Arthur's road trip towards a new life is interrupted by the arrival of the beautiful but fragile Mike (Emily Blunt), who is also trying to leave her past behind: her mother committed suicide, her sister is in a mental institution, and Mike has assumed her sister's name to avoid having to create a life of her own. Drawn to one another, these two damaged souls begin to connect as they break into empty homes and take on the identities of the absent owners - elderly newlyweds, a high-roller and his Russian lady, among others - all supposedly brief moments on their road trip to Terre Haute, Indiana where Arthur believes he has a job as a golf pro - the promise of a chance encounter with one strange Fred Willoughby (the gifted David Andrews). That goal is a dead end, and through this process, Arthur and Mike discover that what they love most about each other are the identities they left at home, and their real journey begins.Colin Firth and Emily Blunt are consummate actors and bring these odd characters to life: they successfully manage comedic situations but always hold closely to the sad underpinnings of their characters' tortured souls. The story is odd, being a variation of a road trip by very lonely and desperate people, but somehow it enters the head and heart and is cause for contemplation.

Sometimes the dream is far better than the reality, but it is the dream that drives our eponymous hero to plan and execute some drastic action. This R-rated dramedy is more drama than comedy; furthermore, if you have any trouble hearing dialogue, you might want to consider closed captions, either in a theater, or wait for the DVD. You don't want to miss the finer points in this plot.We watch:* Colin Firth (""A Single Man"" and ""The King's Speech"") speaking American (!), is Arthur Newman, a frustrated wanna-be golf pro who, after a down-hill slide, has decided to reinvent himself. ""New man,"" get it? He cleverly fakes his own death and hits the road.* Emily Blunt (""Your Sister's Sister"") also speaking American, is Mike, a young woman with nothing to lose. She encounters our hero on the road and they proceed to go adventuring...* Anne Heche (""Cedar Rapids"") is Mena, the girl he left behind. She knows he's boring, but she loves him anyway.* Lucas Hedges (""Moonrise Kingdom"") is Grant, our hero's son. It turns out that he is the most compelling reason for Arthur Newman to re-think his decision.As our couple journeys on, they break into people's houses and take on the personalities (and clothes!) of the occupants. They are far more comfortable being someone else than being themselves. The tagline is: ""If you don't have a life, get someone else's."" They find this great...until it isn't.This is no light-hearted romp, but we are in the hands of pros.

1640958,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BY8DEW8,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","There may be spoilers.Director Dante Ariola's  first film has an interesting premise and I was admittedly drawn in by British actors, Colin Firth and Emily Blunt who are as good as it gets.  Both manage to pull off flawless American accents portraying two weak and desperate souls in search of something meaningful in life.Firth plays Wallace Avery, a divorced man with a 14 year old son who lives with his mother.  Although he is romantically involved with Mina, a woman he works with (Anne Heche), he isn't happy with his life.  He is especially depressed over the fact that his son Kevin (Lucas Hedges) hates him and even tells him to his face.  Wallace, decides to fake his death by drowning.  He changes his identity and becomes Arthur Newman, golf pro which he actually was at one time in his life.  He begins a journey to Terre Haute, Indiana where he is to become the head pro at a swanky private club.  He had met the board chairman at a golf event earlier and improved his game so dramatically that he was offered a job.Along the way Arthur finds Michaela, known as Mike (Blunt) overdosed on a chair by the pool at his motel.  He takes her to the hospital and when released they continue their journey together to Terre Haute.  Skeletons arise from Mike's past and they hide more secrets from each other.  Eventually and predictably they fall for one another.  The movie gets dumber as things move along.Mike is no shrinking violet and entices Arthur to begin breaking in to people's homes that they have seen in town.  At first it seems pretty innocent, but it becomes more and more risky to the point, sex in a stranger's home seems to be the goal.  Although Blunt and Firth are excellent in their roles, at times they just seem to stare at each other like deer in the headlights.Back home in North Carolina, Kevin takes more interest in his father, now that he thinks he's dead.  He stays in his dad's apartment on occasion even when Mina is there.  Nothing creepy mind you.  While much of the film's promise is lost, the finale is a real clunker.

I figured that this will not stick around very long and hence I went to see it right away.""Arthur Newman"" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of a man (played by Colin Firth) who is in the dumps: he just got fired from his job, his ex-wife does not care for him, and his 13 yr. old son hates the mere sight of him. As the movie opens, we see Colin Firth acquiring a new identity, actually someone who passed away a few years ago named Arthur Newman. He then fakes his own death and takes off, as a ""new man"". Arthur plans on driving from Florida to Terre Haute, IN, where a job as a golf instructor awaits. But on his first night on the road, he makes the acquaintance of a young woman (played by Emily Blunt), who herself is running away from her own troubles, and using her twin sister's identity (""Mike"") along the way. Mike decides to join Arthur on the trip to Indiana. To tell you much more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, this is a road movie for the most part, as we follow the two main characters from motel to hotel, and from town to town, on their way to Indiana. Second, the main characters are engulfed in melancholy as on the one hand they are running away from something, yet at the same time are pining for love and someone who understands their problems. Both performances from Colin Firth and Emily Blunt are ace from start to finish. Blunt has been on an incredible run recently (just last year alone I saw her in Your Sister's Sister, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, Looper and the Five Year Engagement, and she shone in just about all of them), and she continues that hot streak in this movie.This movie gathered positive buzz last Fall when it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, and I had been waiting eagerly to see it. The screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not particularly well attended, and so I doubt this will stick around long in the theaters.

However, I was disillusioned as to this film.  For one thing, they are without their suave British accents, both playing Americans in this film. Both of them, though, can pull off an American accent, and their acting was a true pleasure to watch.But, the storyline, to me, was slow and boring. An hour and a half of my life that I can't get back. Colin plays Wallace Avery, who up and runs away from his life and tries to impersonate a golf pro named Arthur J. Newman. Along the way he meets a girl, drunk by a hotel pool, whose real name is Charlotte Fitzgerald but who is impersonating her twin sister Michaela, ""Mike,"" who is a ""lunatic.""Both Wallace and Mike carry a lot of baggage in their lives, but they end up falling for one another.  As they make their way to Terre Haute, IN, they break into people's houses, try on their clothes, take pictures of themselves, and get it on with one another. I found it amazing that no one reported these break-ins to the police. If I came home and found random pictures of strangers strewn all over my kitchen, I would find that more than a little creepy.  Anyway, Wallace and Mike seem to have a fabulous time with other people's identities...until Mike is found out and they spend their last night together, a truly touching scene. Mike goes back to her sister and Wallace goes back to his son.This movie just didn't really do it for me. Only about an hour in was I interested...and even then not for a long length of time. I had seen Emily Blunt play a thief before, in ""Wild Target"" opposite Bill Nighy, and I was reminded her of her character in that movie. She can really pull off the ""bad girl"" thing well.Colin Firth is an amazing actor - I love ""The King's Speech,"" ""Mamma Mia,"" and other things I've seen him in. If for nothing else, watch this movie for the chemistry between Colin and Emily's characters.

Colin Firth plays Avery Walace who leads a boring life and wants something different. Not much in his life has lived up,to his expectations. He wanted to be a golf pro and could never quite make the cut. He is now a floor manager for FedEx. His ex-wife says he spen more time with the caddy than with his family. His son says he was never there for him. Avery's present girlfriend finds him boring but lovable. He takes a chance, goes tote beach, fakes his death, buys a new/old Metcedes convertible and hits the road. He has a new persona, license and all. Where did he get the money? A bag fully money with no answers.On the road he runs into a young woman, who has overdosed on cough syrup, played by Emily Blunt. She is also running away and has taken on her schizophrenic sister's personna. Of course, thy hook up,travel otters Hate, where the new Arthur Newman has a job as a golf pro waiting.You can't run away oes the old saying. Through their fun and games on he road, they both begin to realize this. Boring life, scary life, at sometime you have to face the facts. This film was a quiet little masterpiece that had such great potential. Somewhere along the way, something went wrong. Two marvelous British actors playing two southern characters seems a stretch, but it works. It is the film itself that has no where to go.

It was directed by Dante Ariola  from a screen play by Becky Johnston, (Seven Years In Tibet [HD].  And I'm going to quote its plot summary, written by its screenwriter Johnston, as posted at The Internet Movie Database:Wallace Avery hates his job. His ex-wife and son hate him, and he's blown his one shot at living his dream. Not wanting to face all this, he stages his own death and buys himself a new identity as Arthur Newman. However, Arthur's road trip towards a new life is interrupted by the arrival of the beautiful but fragile Mike, who is also trying to leave her past behind. Drawn to one another, these two damaged souls begin to connect as they break into empty homes and take on the identities of the absent owners: elderly newlyweds, a high-roller and his Russian lady, among others. Through this process, Arthur and Mike discover that what they love most about each other are the identities they left at home, and their real journey, that of healing, begins.The acting is competent to the job.  The well-born Colin Firth, once such tasty eye candy, now looking very middle-aged, plays Arthur.  (SeeThe King's Speechfor which he won the Best Actor Oscar,Bridget Jones's Diary,Love Actually,Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition).  The equally well-born Emily Blunt, a Golden Globe winner forThe Devil Wears Prada, plays Mike.  Anne Heche, (Six Days, Seven Nights,Donnie Brasco), an actor with a more eventful private life than most of Hollywood, plays Arthur's girlfriend Mina Crawley.But remarkably little happens in this road picture; most scenes are reminiscent of actor's studio exercises.  The rather distasteful scenes of the couple breaking into people's houses and play-acting as the occupants while they make love have a desperate vibe, as in, `We gotta do sumphin. We need more screen time.""  (The film runs only 101 minutes).  And it flies in the face of common sense for a man who has tasted some success in golfing under his real name Wallace Avery, to think he can capitalize on that success under the A/K/A of `a new man.'The film was largely made in North Carolina, so it gives us some lovely scenery with which most viewers will not be familiar.  Some of it was filmed quite close to my Carolina Beach residence; the beach scenes at Fort Fisher.  Coles Motel?  Well, that's very near our cute little beachy keen library branch.  So that's a plus for us--rather few -- local residents and visitors.
