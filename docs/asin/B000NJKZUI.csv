However, I soon found myself engrossed in it. It's not your typical love story, but that's what is so good about it. Two people meet and slowly fall in love, but there's a big secret that each of them has that they're not sharing with the other that ends up making all the difference in how they relate to each other. By the time you finish watching this movie, you'll have rethought everything about your life and how you're living it, and if you have a significant other, you'll both be brought closer by this story. It's a very powerful love that these two people share, made all the more intense by their situation. This may not be a blockbuster, but I highly recommend that anyone who has ever spent their time whining about how hard they have it pick this up and watch it.",5,This movie will make you rethink your priorities,1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,883,"['actually', 'first', 'caught', 'movie', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'However', 'soon', 'found', 'engrossed', 'not', 'typical', 'love', 'story', 'what', 'so', 'good', 'Two', 'people', 'meet', 'slowly', 'fall', 'love', 'big', 'secret', ""'re"", 'not', 'sharing', 'other', 'up', 'making', 'difference', 'how', 'relate', 'other', 'time', 'finish', 'watching', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'rethought', 'everything', 'life', 'how', ""'re"", 'living', 'have', 'significant', 'other', ""'ll"", 'be', 'brought', 'closer', 'story', 'very', 'powerful', 'love', 'two', 'people', 'share', 'made', 'more', 'intense', 'situation', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'spent', 'time', 'whining', 'how', 'hard', 'have', 'pick', 'up', 'watch']",GRIFFIN AND PHOENIX 2007

The woman who plays the main character is very appealing (as well as pretty) and makes the various scenes in the movie affecting.  And there are some good moments.  It also is set entirely in and around Manhattan, which will appeal to New Yorkers.But it's a odd movie, typified by the fact that the lead actor is pictured as a blonde in several places on the cover but has black hair in the movie.  He also seems to be trying to do a Sylvester Stallone impersonation.  I like Stallone, but it is disorienting to be constantly reminded of a different actor.The reaction to the bad news is understandable--they play harmless pranks--but is this the best for a movie?  And do we have to see so many of them, one after another?  Couldn't they have thought of at least a few other things to do?  And what type of audience is it that relates to such behavior?  The joking behavior is also understandable, but in the beginning it is a little jarring until we get used to it.The rock songs at the beginning are also an odd choice.  What audience is this movie for?  Rock appeals to the younger half, but they like fast-paced, action movies, not slow, laid-back material about people dying.  The older audience who might like this, typically do not relate to rock.  To them, it is an irritant that detracts from the feel of the movie.So, make your choice or toss a coin.  Or read the novel.

1057185,A1XC099UZR8591,B000NJKZUI,"East West ""Don Quijotee""","[1, 1]","This is a message movie and appears directed at those living with terminal illnesses although the messages of living life, love and priorities are relevant to all. This movie is blunt, often witty and clich&eacute; at delivering its bitter-sweet message. I would not discourage anyone from seeing this touching, occasionally humorous and often heartbreaking movie.The story of two terminally ill people with very little time to live who accidentally fall in love and complete a portion of their 'bucket lists' together, content to enjoy together what remains of their lives while learning anew how to love and the real priorities of life, this movie shows that life and time are precious, unpredictable and best shared with others you love.The acting by both Dermot Mulroney and Amanda Peet was consistently good, emotional and carry the movie which suffers somewhat from editing and production flaws. The story is delivered hurriedly. Dialog is witty but occasionally clich&eacute;; purposeful at delivering its intended message within it short run time, but heartwarming and effective enough at the right moments with elements of humor. There are some iconic visuals such as the clock tower scene. Music used is popular, current (fresh), and relevant to the theme of the moment. I want to purchase the soundtrack!Editing and production issues are the main challenges of this movie. The run time (1:42) felt insufficient to fully develop this two part story (PART 1: Initial love story, PART 2: Subsequent end of life story). As a consequence, some scenes felt 'staged', key dialog like Phoenix's 'coming out' and certain scenes like their using medications at lunch seem too blunt, weakening the movies overall effectiveness. The emotional impact could have been many times more intense had more time been given to develop the characters relationship, budding love and sincere emotional attachment. Despite the dialog and editing limitations, the actors consistently delivered emotional performances. Production issues included shaky cameras, lighting issues and a few 'TV' quality shots. Much of the dialog sounded dubbed-over, sound booth quality and a few sets appeared like a TV sound stage.",3,Bitter-Sweet Love Unfettered,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,2197,"['message', 'movie', 'directed', 'living', 'terminal', 'illnesses', 'messages', 'living', 'life', 'love', 'priorities', 'are', 'relevant', 'movie', 'blunt', 'often', 'witty', 'clich', 'eacute', 'delivering', 'bitter-sweet', 'message', 'would', 'not', 'discourage', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'touching', 'occasionally', 'humorous', 'often', 'heartbreaking', 'movie.The', 'story', 'two', 'terminally', 'ill', 'people', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'live', 'who', 'accidentally', 'fall', 'love', 'complete', 'portion', ""'bucket"", 'lists', 'together', 'content', 'enjoy', 'together', 'what', 'lives', 'learning', 'anew', 'how', 'love', 'real', 'priorities', 'life', 'movie', 'life', 'time', 'are', 'precious', 'unpredictable', 'best', 'shared', 'others', 'love.The', 'acting', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'was', 'consistently', 'good', 'emotional', 'carry', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'editing', 'production', 'flaws', 'story', 'delivered', 'hurriedly', 'Dialog', 'witty', 'occasionally', 'clich', 'eacute', 'purposeful', 'delivering', 'intended', 'message', 'short', 'run', 'time', 'heartwarming', 'effective', 'enough', 'right', 'moments', 'elements', 'humor', 'are', 'iconic', 'visuals', 'such', 'clock', 'tower', 'scene', 'Music', 'used', 'popular', 'current', 'fresh', 'relevant', 'theme', 'moment', 'want', 'purchase', 'soundtrack', 'Editing', 'production', 'issues', 'are', 'main', 'challenges', 'movie', 'run', 'time', '1:42', 'felt', 'insufficient', 'fully', 'develop', 'two', 'part', 'story', 'PART', '1', 'Initial', 'love', 'story', 'PART', '2', 'Subsequent', 'end', 'life', 'story', 'consequence', 'scenes', 'felt', ""'staged"", 'key', 'dialog', 'Phoenix', ""'coming"", 'out', 'certain', 'scenes', 'using', 'medications', 'lunch', 'seem', 'too', 'blunt', 'weakening', 'movies', 'overall', 'effectiveness', 'emotional', 'impact', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'times', 'more', 'intense', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'been', 'given', 'develop', 'characters', 'relationship', 'budding', 'love', 'sincere', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'dialog', 'editing', 'limitations', 'actors', 'consistently', 'delivered', 'emotional', 'performances', 'Production', 'issues', 'included', 'shaky', 'cameras', 'lighting', 'issues', 'few', ""'TV"", 'quality', 'shots', 'Much', 'dialog', 'sounded', 'dubbed-over', 'sound', 'quality', 'few', 'sets', 'appeared', 'TV', 'sound', 'stage']",GRIFFIN AND PHOENIX 2007
1057186,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000NJKZUI,Grady Harp,"[33, 35]","GRIFFIN & PHOENIX is a quiet little made for television film that touches the vulnerable heart.  Originally written in 1976 as a television film by John Hill, this thirty-years-later version holds up well, and the fact that audiences will still opt for sensitive stories that treat difficult topics in a mature manner, adding warmly humorous touches to a potentially maudlin idea, speaks well for our continuing tastes.From the opening frames of the film we learn that Griffin (Dermot Mulroney) has inoperable cancer: his frank and compassionate physician (Lois Smith) aligns him with reality. Griffin is a divorced father of two boys and his first attempt to find meaning in his limited time is to spend time with them, an attempt partially thwarted by his ex-wife.  Once a workaholic, Griffin attends a class on death and dying at the university and there he meets the rather strange and isolated Phoenix (Amanda Peet).  Griffin's new take on life encourages him to go after the seemingly impenetrable Phoenix and through a series of wildly frivolous escapades he courts her and they gradually fall in love - something neither felt they could do.  They cope with issues of intimacy and finally Phoenix shares her secret with Griffin, a secret that plunges them headlong into a fully blossomed romance.  How the two cope with the inevitable is well handled, rarely bordering on sappy, and always holding our compassion.Director Ed Stone paces the film well, inserting moments of extended silence to match the emotional atmosphere, allowing breathing space.  Both Peet and Mulroney create believable three-dimensional characters and are well supported by such solid actors as Lois Smith, Sarah Paulson, and Novella Nelson.  The story may have sad aspects, but the cast always allows the humor inherent in any life event to come through.  And that is one of the several reasons the film works well.
