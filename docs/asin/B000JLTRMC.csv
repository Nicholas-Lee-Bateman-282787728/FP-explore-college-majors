That is because really nothing has changed from the first season. The plots are different of course, but there's still just as much action, excitement, and suspense. Expect more roundhouse kicks, nefarious villains, and truly hilarious moments the way it was all meant to be. You can also expect that same sense of justice when evil criminals are tossed into the bed of Walker's pickup truck, and the awesome new theme song - ""The Eyes of a Ranger"". It's bigger, better, and just plain awesome! Below is a list of episodes included in this seven disc DVD set.--- Ratings based on my opinion of episode; 4 **** Rating System ---1.

I bought season 2 because the price at Amazon was right and why would you only want half a set and not the whole collection. What good is an incomplete set. I have seen the show many times but owning it is not like watching it on T.V. with all of the commercials. I have found over the years that T.V. really needs some help. The shows aren't that good, so why not buy what you want to watch. It is a whole site cheaper in the long run than, a one or two year contract with you local Cable Company. After all the cable companies usually show the same movies  you can get on a DVD. So it makes more sense to get it and own it, rather than from some company who shows the feature and it cost more money. Buy the program and save in the Long Run.

So Walker does it nice and rough instead, and when you're dealing with the likes of heavy-duty criminals like drug dealers, bank robbers, assassins, cattle rustlers, the Japanese mob, and vengeful escaped convicts, that's the only way to do it.&#34;If you come back here,&#34; a dirty sheriff warns Walker in the episode &#34;Badge of Honor,&#34; &#34;you'd better bring an army because you alone just ain't gonna cut it.&#34; Actually, that'll cut it just fine. What makes Walker so satisfying is that justice may be delayed, but it is never denied.In the episode, &#34;Mean Streets,&#34; Walker goes undercover to protect the homeless from a band of rich kids who are preying on them and videotaping the attacks. If this were, say, Law & Order, the kids' parents would hire an elite defense team and the kids might get off scot-free. That's not the way they roll on Walker: Texas Ranger. With the kids in custody, viewers are promised an &#34;easy&#34; conviction.What really kicks this 1993-1994 Season into high gear is the show's new theme song, &#34;Eyes of a Ranger,&#34; performed by Norris himself. Jeff Foxworthy has joked, &#34;If an episode of Walker: Texas Ranger has changed your life, you might be a redneck.&#34; Granted, Walker may not be life-changing TV &agrave; la Oprah, but there is considerable spiritual uplift in watching an incorruptible hero tossing Texas' scum of the earth into the back of his pickup truck and taking them to jail.We join Asst. D.A. Alex Cahill (Sheree J. Wilson) in raising a glass to Walker. &#34;Here's to the Texas Rangers,&#34; she toasts in one episode, &#34;the best there are.It's also cool to be able to see all these episodes of WALKER, TEXAS RANGER complete & uncut without all those deleted scenes we got on TV Land, WGN, Hallmark Channel, and USA.",3,Eyes Of A Ranger,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,2297,"['1993-94', 'Season', 'police', 'drama', 'ran', 'CBS', '1993-01', 'was', 'somewhat', 'reigned-in', 'Walker', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'less', '34', 'Dirty', 'Harry', '34', 'more', 'by-the-book', 'providing', 'course', 'book', 'plenty', 'pictures', 'criminals', 'being', 'subdued', 'roundhouse', 'kicks', 'head.In', 'one', 'episode', 'Walker', 'partner', 'Jimmy', 'Trivette', 'Clarence', 'Gilyard', 'Jr.', 'serving', 'warrant', 'way', '34', 'nice', 'easy.', 'unfortunately', 'Walker', 'never', 'ever', 'anything', 'nice', 'easy', 'So', 'Walker', 'nice', 'rough', 'instead', 'when', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'likes', 'heavy-duty', 'criminals', 'drug', 'dealers', 'bank', 'robbers', 'assassins', 'cattle', 'rustlers', 'Japanese', 'mob', 'vengeful', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'it.', '34', 'come', 'back', 'here', '34', 'dirty', 'sheriff', 'Walker', 'episode', '34', 'Badge', 'Honor', '34', '34', ""'d"", 'better', 'bring', 'army', 'alone', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'cut', 'it.', '34', 'Actually', ""'ll"", 'cut', 'just', 'fine', 'What', 'Walker', 'satisfying', 'justice', 'may', 'be', 'delayed', 'never', 'denied.In', 'episode', '34', 'Mean', 'Streets', '34', 'Walker', 'undercover', 'protect', 'homeless', 'band', 'rich', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'preying', 'videotaping', 'attacks', 'were', 'say', 'Law', 'Order', 'kids', 'parents', 'would', 'hire', 'elite', 'defense', 'team', 'kids', 'might', 'get', 'off', 'scot-free', 'not', 'way', 'roll', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'kids', 'custody', 'viewers', 'are', 'promised', '34', 'easy', '34', 'conviction.What', 'really', 'kicks', '1993-1994', 'Season', 'high', 'gear', 'show', 'new', 'theme', 'song', '34', 'Eyes', 'Ranger', '34', 'performed', 'Norris', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'joked', '34', 'episode', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'changed', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'redneck.', '34', 'Granted', 'Walker', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'life-changing', 'TV', 'agrave', 'Oprah', 'considerable', 'spiritual', 'uplift', 'watching', 'incorruptible', 'hero', 'tossing', 'Texas', 'scum', 'earth', 'back', 'pickup', 'truck', 'taking', 'jail.We', 'join', 'Asst', 'D.A', 'Alex', 'Cahill', 'Sheree', 'J.', 'Wilson', 'raising', 'glass', 'Walker', '34', 'Here', 'Texas', 'Rangers', '34', 'one', 'episode', '34', 'best', 'are.It', 'also', 'cool', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'episodes', 'WALKER', 'TEXAS', 'RANGER', 'complete', 'uncut', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'got', 'TV', 'Land', 'WGN', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'USA']","Walker, Texas Ranger - The Complete Second Season"
