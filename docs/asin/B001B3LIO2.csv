1170260,A3DQDILRL74K37,B001B3LIO2,"KMG ""Apparently I'm a Shopaholic""","[47, 48]","I am an avid lover of Empire Records.  That movie was a cult classic, up there with Clerks and Mallrats- maybe even Jay and Silent Bob.  It is an overdose of stupid, lovestruck, eccentric teenagers (and twenties) who work in a record store that is about to go under, due to some embezzeling of the funds in the safe by an employee.  They are so much like a family, that the gambling (and subsequent losing) of that money is hidden like a dark secret.  They all come together to have a store party (fest) to raise money to save the small town store.  It's funny, it's wild, introspective and exciting.  Perfection for an early 90s film.However...Along came the ""remix fan edition"".  In the fan edition, the words have changed from their original ""classic"" version.  I have to assume the words in this edition are the ORIGINAL scripted words, and maybe the movie that was released had the revised ones to keep the film at PG 13?  But since the released version is the one that I've grown accustomed to, that is the version that I want.No where on this site is this product marked ""fan edition"".  I specifically bought this version (even though matched with Singles in a dual disc case) because it was NOT marked ""fan edition"".  I can't find the original version ANYWHERE.This is very upsetting.Viewers- PLEASE BE ADVISED- this version of Empire Records is NOT the originally released version.
