1289724,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B002UJIY02,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","""American Pie Presents : The Book Of Love"" is the 4th in the straight to DVD series of this franchise and the 7th overall. After having seen and written reviews for the all others in the ""Presents"" franchise, I really don't know what else could be said in reviews if more came out. Basically, what you always think the movie is, well, usually is. The same can be said for this latest installment in the long running frnachise. I have given this movie three stars, when it should probably be less. I have given 2 stars for some of the other entries in the straight to DVD films since I figured they were the best they were going to be, but I gave this one three simply because it it slightly better than the three previous entires in the series. Does this make sense?. You pretty much know the score and how these are all by the numbers, but let's get on with it.We are back at East Great Falls High School, the setting of the original film from 1999. We are introduced to a new team of high school buddies who have girls and sex on the brain. Nothing new. One is the good guy who longs for his dream girl. He is the ""Jim"" of the bunch. His two buddies are the usual. One is constantly looking to hook up with the popular cheerleader babe, and the other wants to get more active with his girlfriend. After an ensuing fire in the library, our trio of boys discover the lengendary Book Of Love. The Book Of Love is a sex guide on how to get it and get with girls that has been passed down from generation to generation of students, with each one adding new tips and techniques to the book. Our guys think they have found the holy grail. Sadly, the book was destroyed in the fire, and the three go about trying to put it back together with help from previous students who contributed, including Jim's Dad(Eugene Levy).First and foremost, this is the first of the AP : Presents films, except Eugene Levy, to have more of a tie in with the original trilogy, which featured the Book Of Love. Plus, the East Great Falls High School is back in play, even tho this was filmed in Canada and it's not the same building. The writer of this one also co-wrote American Pie 2. So, it has more of a feel and connection with the earlier films than their straight to DVD offspring. It still doesn't hold a candle to the original film or trilogy, but it's an American Pie film, and it has what you have come to expect from it. Horny high school hi-jinks and shenanigans?. You betcha!. Gratuitous nudity and beautiful women all over?. Uh-huh!. Embarrasing sexual situations?. You know it!. An actor doing a bad Sean William Scott impression?. Yep!. It's all here in spades. If that's what you are looking for, you definitley won't be disappointed. Elsewhere, the movie tries to have something resembling more of a plot, and it does it better than the three that came before(""The Naked Mile"", easily the worst of the worst, still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth), but it still quickly dissolves into the usual and doesn't amount to much more than that. I mean, after one character gets attacked in his backside with a poorly done CGI moose, where else is there to go?.As for the cast and the characters, this bunch is better than the group we had to hang with in the last two films. Bug Hall is our main guy, and he's a pretty likeable guy. He was Alfalfa in ""The Little Rascals"" movie. Beth Behrs is the main girl here and she is instantly loveable and sweet. She doesn't get much to do here other than be ""the girl"", but at least it's easy to see why our main guy is so madly in love with her. Eugene Levy is still the man. He owns every scene he is in. He deserves better than these quick paychecks, but he is still funny and delivers in his small role. We have yet another Stifler family member here. Is everyone in this family the same?. Are they all jerks and idiots?. The guy who was Stifler in ""Band Camp"" was the best of the Stiflers I thought, and the others that came after were just poor imitations. No different here. The rest of the gang are all typical. One of the best parts of the movie is there are some fun cameos. Some of the past students who wrote in the book are played by Tim Matheson(Animal House), Bret Michaels(Poison), Christopher Knight(The Brady Bunch), C. Thomas Howell(The Hitcher), Steve Railsback, Robert Romanus(Fast Times At Ridgemont High), and Dustin Diamond(Saved By The Bell). Sherman Hemsley(The Jeffersons) and Curtis Armstrong(Revenge Of The Nerds)appear as well. A big surprise here is Rosanna Arquette. She is fun in the movie and looks like she probably had a fun time, but did she really need this work?.It was nice to have a writer from the original films and give the movie a connection the original with the book and school. The first film had real heart, and this one tries to go there too, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Basically, this is exactly what you think it is. If you have seen the previous ones and like them, then you know what you are getting into. The best compliment I can give this movie is that it is the best of the ""Presents"" series, but that really isn't saying much at all.",3,"Okay, Just One More Piece....",1263340800,"01 13,

I took a peak anyways. What a waste of time -- This was a terrible movie!The storyline is almost identical to the 1st ""American Pie"". 3 Guys make a pack to lose their virginity. Although similar, there is one major difference in this film when compared to the original. This time the Sex Bible (originally shown in ""American Pie 1"") is the central part the storyline. Yes the same book that Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) discovers in the Great Falls high school library and uses to sexually please Vicky (Tara Reid) in her bedroom. The book has been partially destroyed in a flood (due to fire sprinklers being set off after a small fire.) Now the 3 main characters (of this film) are on a mission to restore the book and lose their virginity at the same time.There are lots of familiar scenes in this film that are almost identical to the original ""American Pie"" including several references to sex with Food items, animals, and household appliances. Also there are several scenes where the main character's sex life is exposed on the internet (sound familiar?). Furthermore, we have another Stiffler who is oddly similar to the original character created by Seann William Scott but not portrayed as well. And if that is not enough, the film also includes a foreign exchange student (Nadia's cousin) although her part is small and unclear as to what she actually adds to the storyline.Basically if You have seen the original ""American Pie"", and maybe ""Hot Dog... The Movie"" (due to some similar ski lodge scenes) then you have seen this movie. Wish I could give a better review to this one, but it was just not that great of a Pie movie (unlike the last few released.) Maybe they should have stayed within the newer storyline they created with ""American Pie presents The Naked Mile"", and ""American Pie presents Beta House"". At least these two movies were actually worth watching more then once.The only slightly interesting aspect of this movie is the assorted guest appearances by former child stars, rock stars, and Classic Television stars. Some of those include Dustin Diamond (Skreech), C. Thomas Howell, Christopher Knight (Peter Brady), Tim Matheson, Bret Michaels (Poison), Kevin Federline (Britney Spears Ex-husband), Sherman Hemsley (The Jeffersons), Steve Railsback, and a few others. Maybe this just shows how bad this movie is considering they could not even hire a decent cast other than Eugene Levy (in all American Pie Films) and Rosanna Arquette.Overall unless you are just interested in obtaining this dvd to complete your collection, I think I would stay away from this film.",2,Did they run out of storylines?

Certainly none of these films are CITIZEN KANE but they have all had some funny gags, likeable and attractive characters and fairly decent scripts (the first four in particular).

All of the characters are unpleasent for the most part (although Ms. Arquett does a decent job).  There is really no one to identify with in this film.  This time around no attempt is made to link Stiffler with his previous onscreen relatives and his character amounts to little more than a cameo. Even Eugene Levy phones it in on this one. The entire premise of the film is also extremely unlikely and rather stupid.  Hopefully the inevitable part 8 will get back on track.

The DTS was mixed perfectly, especially in each fantasy sequence the music didn't drown anything out. The picture was crystal enough to see every pore and flesh tone - and there is a great deal of that. Aside from the cameos and fun fantasy sequences, the movie is forgettable, but the supplements are fun and worth the watch, including:* Making of, 8:00 minutes. Director intros with how he dislikes the usual fare so this and all of the others could have been one long documentary of gags, outtakes and fun on the set. This one covers some brief interviews and gags.* Love Manual, 5:50 minutes. The hot girls from the movie and some of the cameo guys give their take on how to get with ladies.* Trivia. One of the cast goes around the set and tests people's memory on some good American Pie trivia. Enjoyable.* Pie-Cons, 6:50 minutes. Interviews with the long list of cameos in this film.* Deleted scenes, 11:14 minutes. Plenty of extra skin and forgettable dialogue.* Gag Reel, 4:00 minutes. More outtakes and adlib stuff - hilarious.* From the Set, 10 clips totaling 19 minutes. Essentially more deleted scenes with lots of extra ladies sans their clothing in funny sequences. Obviously this crew/cast had a good time making the film.The extended is only a few minutes longer and there really isn't that much of a difference to warrant watching this twice.

1289744,A1ZCMOW8Q6E71X,B002UJIY02,"Ted E. Kissel ""Ted Kissel""","[1, 1]","With the American Pie movies 2 of them stand out as by far the worst and best of the series.  The best being oddly enough American Pie 2 and the worst being American Pie Presents Band Camp the second worst dreaded forth sequel of an movie series with the worst being Wrong Turn 4.  Another odd thing about the American Pie movies is that Book Of Love is the second worst of the series and it's follow up American Reunion is the second best of the series.The plot of the movie is pretty simple 3 guys (Nathan, Rob, and Lube)  are trying to lose their virginity in high school and keep striking out big time kind of like Finch, Kevin, Oz, and Jim in the first pie movie.  The main character Rob takes the place of Jim in this movie since he is tying to get with a girl named Heidi and keeps woosing out when trying to pick her up, kind of like Jim does with Nadia in the first pie movie.  Except the big difference is Heidi isn't an exchange student, is present through out the entire movie, and isn't really comparable to Nadia in the first pie movie.  Then there's Nathan who has a girlfriend who won't go all the way kind of like Kevin does in the first pie movie.  Except the difference is Nathan's girl (Dana) is not a virgin and has black hair.  Then Lube because he's overweight kind of plays the part of Oz and Finch combined without being involved in any sports.  And then Scott Stifler takes the place of Steve Stifler in the movie.Rob accidentally sets part of the school library on fire when going after Heidi at a school dance and puts the fire out with water.  After he puts the fire out with water he finds the book of love/bible in ruins through serving detention cleaning up his mess.  Him, Nathan, and Lube try to read the book of love and use it to get laid.  Then after they end up killing a prostitute (Monique) over 65 years of age in Canada by Rob trying to have sex with her due to a passage in the book of love that was written in 1975 about having sex with Monique that Rob, Nathan, and Lube thought was written in 1995.  Rob, Nathan, and Lube find the name Noah Levenstien as the first person who checked out the book, contact him, and find out he was the original writer of the book.  Then Noah, Rob, Nathan, and Lube contact everyone else who checked out the book to re-print what they'd wrote in the book.Now lets look at the mistakes in the movie*Scott Stifler is by far the least funniest of all the Stiflers including Eric.  It seemed like the actor who played him really lacked that jerky voice and presentation of anger it took to play a Stifler.  Plus the Stifler's play LaCross and football not basketball.*Way too many embarrassing youtube videos on Rob.  It was almost like Rob's little brother put too many youtube videos up of Rob's embarrassing moments during the movie and the director didn't spread out all the boys trying to lose their virginity getting embarrassed through out the movie like in the first American Pie with Finch, Stifler, Jim, and Oz.  Instead (even though Lube got an embarrassing moment or 2 in the movie) it seemed like  everything was focused on Rob.  And Stifler got a good embarrassing moment at the end of the film that was pretty good.  Plus all the embarrassing moments in this film unlike the first American Pie just seemed too fictional and non believable causing them not to be as funny as they were in the first American Pie.*Stifler's house-When Scott Stifler threw a party at his house it just didn't seem believable as your typical get drunk high school party.  The party seemed to have too much going on at it and just wasn't the same as the party's Steve Stifler threw at his hose in American Pie 1 & 2 and American Reunion.*Eugene Levy has the smallest part of any American Pie movie-Eugene Levy wrote the book of love/bible, why is he only in the movie for 20 minutes straight and not spread out through out the entire movie like he is in the other 7 American Pie movies?  And why was the book of love written in 1969 when Noah Levenstien (played by Eugene Levy) was in high school, when according to American Pie Presents The Beta House Noah was captain of the Beta House during the last greek games in 1969 (well technically second to last since in Beta House the house does have the greek games against another fraternity house at the end of the film)?*No Kevin or Tom Myers-When Rob, Nathan, Lube, and Noah re-construct the book of love they call everyone who's checked it out and wrote in it.  These people include the East Great Falls principal, Brett Michaels, and other people.  Why where Kevin (ie Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Tom (ie Casey Affleck) Myers not in any of these scenes when they were the ones who were talking about and using the book of love in the first American Pie movie?But all in although American Pie Presents Book of love may not be the best of the pie series, it's still better then American Pie Present's Band Camp and has a much better ending.  Even though it seemed like the creator of this movie tried to take the same approach the creator of the first American Pie did.  Except the big difference is the creator of the first American Pie found much better and younger actors no one knew about.",2,Too much like the original not as bad as Band Camp,1358553600,"01 19,

1289745,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B002UJIY02,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[9, 11]","Anyone that has watched the films in this series since the beginning (American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)) is going to inevitably rate this film in comparison to the other films.  The first film, much like another film of that same general era (The Matrix (10th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]) was somewhat ground breaking.  It was raw, crude, lewd, and really, really funny thanks to being so lewd and crude.  The later films in the series have had that bar to jump over and some have been mildly successful (American Pie Presents - The Naked Mile) while others have been merely amusing.  This particular film (Book of Love) seems to fall into that range with nothing to really push it towards a higher rating.  For me, I think I'd have to put this one into the same ratings area asAmerican Pie - Band Camp (Unrated Widescreen Edition).  While this film is, at least in the Unrated version, loaded with more gratituitous T&A; than that earlier film, the story seems to be about as weak as that earlier story was.There are several cameos in Book of Love that do add to the fun, and a load of extras that add value as well, but personally I'd have to say that this one veers far more to rental territory than to purchase territory.  Tread carefully here.  If you aren't a fan of the series, then look elsewhere.Hopefully the next film in the series delivers something a little better for everyone to enjoy.",3,"The series goes on, but hopefully next time brings a better story",1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,1425,"['Anyone', 'watched', 'films', 'series', 'beginning', 'American', 'Pie', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'going', 'inevitably', 'rate', 'film', 'comparison', 'other', 'films', 'first', 'film', 'much', 'film', 'same', 'general', 'era', 'Matrix', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'was', 'somewhat', 'ground', 'breaking', 'was', 'raw', 'crude', 'lewd', 'really', 'really', 'funny', 'thanks', 'being', 'so', 'lewd', 'crude', 'later', 'films', 'series', 'have', 'had', 'bar', 'jump', 'over', 'have', 'been', 'mildly', 'successful', 'American', 'Pie', 'Presents', 'Naked', 'Mile', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'merely', 'amusing', 'particular', 'film', 'Book', 'Love', 'fall', 'range', 'nothing', 'really', 'push', 'towards', 'higher', 'rating', 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'put', 'one', 'same', 'ratings', 'area', 'asAmerican', 'Pie', 'Band', 'Camp', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'film', 'least', 'Unrated', 'version', 'loaded', 'more', 'gratituitous', 'T', 'A', 'earlier', 'film', 'story', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'weak', 'earlier', 'story', 'are', 'several', 'cameos', 'Book', 'Love', 'do', 'add', 'fun', 'load', 'extras', 'add', 'value', 'as', 'well', 'personally', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'one', 'veers', 'far', 'more', 'rental', 'territory', 'purchase', 'territory', 'Tread', 'carefully', 'here', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'series', 'then', 'look', 'elsewhere.Hopefully', 'next', 'film', 'series', 'delivers', 'something', 'little', 'better', 'everyone', 'enjoy']",N/A

Now to set the record straight I love teenage sex comedies. However, a boy making love to a PB&J; is not in my realm of humor. Toss in a dog and his brother filming the event and I am out the door.The movie missed a golden opportunity in The Book of Love. It attempted to reunite certain characters from the past to the present. We had Booger, from the classic ""Revenge of the Nerds"" as a teacher and Rosanna Arquette from ""Amazon Women on the Moon."" This should have been a parade of champions from past teenage sex comedies, instead we just get a few to tempt us.Nudity, sexual situations and non-stop crude sex language.
