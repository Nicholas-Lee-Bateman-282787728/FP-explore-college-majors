1466546,A3UE57S8G2G72Y,B005LAIH1S,A Customer,"[2, 2]","In this movie Tyler Perry plays Wesley Deeds, the son of a wealthy, deceased businessman who was raised by his father to be a businessman and raised by his mother to be a gentleman. He is a fifth generation ivy league graduate. He is also engaged to Natalie (Gabrielle Union) and, while they are in love, she can predict his every move and this makes their relationship unexciting. Then one day he meets Lindsey (Thandie Newton), a night janitor who is a single mother that just got evicted and is going through a rough time after the death of her husband in Iraq. In the process of helping her, he discovers that he has been living his life for his parents. Then he decides to live his own life and be happy. It is heartwarming to see him as a sensitive, charming, respectful, caring, family-oriented man. He's also really handsome and intelligent. Newton's character is absolutely amazing, so is the actress who played her daughter. I admire the strength they have to pesevere. They struggle so hard to survive, but Lindsey is so proud. She also doesn't want to keep getting hurt, which is understandable. Like she said to Wesley, everyone that promised to take care of her, let her down, but Wesley showed that he was different. It's nice to see her bond with him and her daughter. Phylicia Rashad is amazing as usual. She plays Wesley and Walter's mum. She is fantastic, but I wish her character did not look down on Newton's character. When they met she said some mean things to her, which I don't think is fair. But to be honest, there are people like her in real life so her role is realistic. Gabrielle Union is also a great actress. The only character I do not like apart from Rashad's character is Wesley's brother (Walter) because he is disrespectful to women, and he is trying to take his brother's position. Unfortunately, there are people like him in real life, so his character is also realistic. Wesley's assistant, John, is a dedicated worker and also a great friend. His wife (Heidi) is also a terrific friend to Natalie. I just remembered Lindsey's daughter's teacher who showed concern for them, Jerry from the shelter who kindly showed them the location of their bed, the social worker who gave her daughter back to her once she got an apartment, Wesley's amazing secretary (April), etc. In short, everybody was great. Last, but not least, as a Nigerian, I love that Wesley, Lindsey, and April are traveling to Abuja, Nigeria. I looked closely at their tickets. This is exactly where I am at the moment. Anyway, I highly recommend this movie, not because of what I just said, it truly is an amazing movie.

He has a very managed life and does not do anything that is out of the ordinary. As he is getting to settle down with a Natalie ( Gabrielle Union), Lindsey ( Thandie Newton) enters his life. She is struggling with her roles as a single mom and Deeds helps her a lot. Things start changing for him quickly and he starts to question his purpose in life, his relationship with Union and his family, his businessman persona and ultimately his feelings for Natalie.This is a cliched film to boot, every frame is predictable and the characters also seem to be very pretentious and unforgettable in their roles- except White. Despite its many weaknesses the film is watchable and for that I must credit Perry and his  very professional direction. Tyler Perry has consistently managed to make watchable but predictable movies and this one is no exception. However it is sad to see that an actress such as Union wasted in a very small role. The movies predictable pace is saved by high production values but a weak ending somehow renders it all useless.

1466584,A35FC3DWA1M79H,B005LAIH1S,Christopher,"[6, 13]","Let's just start out flat and say that Tyler Perry is definitely not a dramatic actor and will never win an award.  Hell, Will Smith has him beat on acting!  With that said, Perry needs to do what George Lucas should have done for Attack of the Clones - hire a DIRECTOR!From what I have read and heard from actors, Tyler Perry is cheap and pays them practically nothing!  It is clear that he prefers to keep as much money from his films as much as possible which is why he writes, directs and produces all of them and even stars in them - all so that he gets most of the money!  Yeah, he employs actors who otherwise would not have much higher profile work coming in or who otherwise would not get any TV or film work, but with him it is like getting below or minimum wage!  That should end for a guy with an EGO like Perry!Now, this film is another one of his hastily put together, predictable films.  This film serves as a showcase for Perry to show off his real life wealth put in film.  He is rich, owns a company, has a nice looking fiance, nice looking mother, fly rides, fly home, is intelligent, cannot relate to the common man and of course, has the ladies fighting over him.  In other words, he is the top man!  He meets a janitor played by another one of Perry's stable of actors (she is just getting by on the acting skills - but she is cute!), but of course in real life, a woman looking like this would never be stuck with a job of janitor!  She would most certainly be someone's assistant some place!It's the usual story.  Rich man is rich, meets the poor, wants to help, the poor changes his worldly views, he has fun and resigns from his stiff life (that 99% of people would love to have!) and is a better and happier man.  Hell, even his fiance is fine with his new decisions!  Perry is a rotten actor and the guy who played his brother is even worse!  In one dramatic scene, I was expecting more emotions out of Perry.  If he would have had a director, he would have gotten it out of him, but when you are the boss, you can do it half ""A.""Again, these are not Academy Award type films from Perry, just meant for quick money grabs.  Even though this flopped, it still made money and he has another Medea film lined up right after.  Medea is the anchor and Good Deeds is the experiment.  It would not hurt to get a co-writer to polish the film up and to get rid of cliches and predictable story lines.  In the first 40 minutes, I did not know where it was going, but I knew the ending.  After 40 minutes, it was predictable as was the ending.  In fact, when it ended, I could not believe that it was over with that ending!It had my attention, but after it was over, it did not have my retention!  This is another ego-driven film by the latest flavor of black directors.  I guess the John Singleton's and Spike Lee's are not the order of today since they tackle real issues and Perry deals with largely foolishness.  It is OK to laugh (although he needs a write for that too, because I don't laugh at his films, I am just entertained) and Perry does deliver positive messages, so I am not as hard on him as others.  My main issues are with the quality.EXTRA:  I also noticed that Tyler Perry almost always has a mixed girl as the lead and as an example of optimum beauty.  I hope he is not color struck.  He also has a lot of the women in his films as prostitutes as if most black women do that if they are not a professional.",3,You Know What to Expect!,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,3442,"['Let', 'just', 'start', 'out', 'flat', 'say', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'definitely', 'not', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'will', 'never', 'win', 'award', 'Hell', 'Will', 'Smith', 'beat', 'acting', 'said', 'Perry', 'do', 'what', 'George', 'Lucas', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'hire', 'DIRECTOR', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'heard', 'actors', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'cheap', 'practically', 'nothing', 'clear', 'keep', 'much', 'money', 'films', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'why', 'directs', 'even', 'stars', 'so', 'most', 'money', 'Yeah', 'actors', 'who', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'higher', 'profile', 'work', 'coming', 'who', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'TV', 'film', 'work', 'getting', 'minimum', 'wage', 'should', 'end', 'guy', 'EGO', 'Perry', 'Now', 'film', 'one', 'hastily', 'put', 'together', 'predictable', 'films', 'film', 'showcase', 'Perry', 'show', 'off', 'real', 'life', 'wealth', 'put', 'film', 'rich', 'company', 'nice', 'looking', 'fiance', 'nice', 'looking', 'mother', 'fly', 'rides', 'fly', 'home', 'intelligent', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'common', 'man', 'course', 'ladies', 'fighting', 'other', 'words', 'top', 'man', 'janitor', 'played', 'one', 'Perry', 'stable', 'actors', 'just', 'getting', 'acting', 'skills', 'cute', 'course', 'real', 'life', 'woman', 'looking', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'stuck', 'job', 'janitor', 'would', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'someone', 'assistant', 'place', 'usual', 'story', 'Rich', 'man', 'rich', 'poor', 'help', 'poor', 'changes', 'worldly', 'views', 'fun', 'resigns', 'stiff', 'life', '99', '%', 'people', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'better', 'happier', 'man', 'Hell', 'even', 'fiance', 'fine', 'new', 'decisions', 'Perry', 'rotten', 'actor', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'brother', 'even', 'worse', 'one', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'emotions', 'Perry', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'when', 'are', 'boss', 'can', 'do', 'half', 'A', 'Again', 'are', 'not', 'Academy', 'Award', 'type', 'films', 'Perry', 'just', 'meant', 'quick', 'money', 'grabs', 'Even', 'flopped', 'still', 'made', 'money', 'Medea', 'film', 'lined', 'up', 'right', 'Medea', 'anchor', 'Good', 'Deeds', 'experiment', 'would', 'not', 'hurt', 'get', 'co-writer', 'polish', 'film', 'up', 'get', 'rid', 'cliches', 'predictable', 'story', 'lines', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'knew', 'ending', '40', 'minutes', 'was', 'predictable', 'was', 'ending', 'fact', 'when', 'ended', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'ending', 'had', 'attention', 'was', 'over', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'retention', 'ego-driven', 'film', 'latest', 'flavor', 'black', 'directors', 'guess', 'John', 'Singleton', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'are', 'not', 'order', 'today', 'tackle', 'real', 'issues', 'Perry', 'deals', 'largely', 'foolishness', 'OK', 'laugh', 'write', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'films', 'am', 'just', 'entertained', 'Perry', 'deliver', 'positive', 'messages', 'am', 'not', 'as', 'hard', 'others', 'main', 'issues', 'are', 'quality.EXTRA', 'also', 'noticed', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'almost', 'always', 'mixed', 'girl', 'lead', 'example', 'optimum', 'beauty', 'hope', 'not', 'color', 'struck', 'also', 'lot', 'women', 'films', 'as', 'prostitutes', 'most', 'black', 'women', 'do', 'are', 'not', 'professional']",Tyler Perry's Good Deeds

Wesley Deeds lived his life by the blueprint of his parents and was so dead to it all that he masked his unhappiness with smiles.  That was, until, a attitude-laced janitor, played by Thandie Newton, came into his life and started to break down the walls, just to show him that his life was his and his alone.  For me, the standout performances belonged to Thandie Newton, who had a little too much attitude for me, but when you watch what she went thru just to keep her daughter safe and fed, I couldn't to anything buy sympathize and root for her, throughout her struggles.  The other belonged to Brian J. White, who took the self-absorbed, little brother routine to a whole 'nother level.

The only relatively happy person in hisrelationship(s) was Mr. Deeds (The Player). He was like so many men.  He was not happy with a little pie, so he wanted the whole pie. Gabrielle was disrespected immensely and allowed herself to be devalued rather than honored.  How not to get the guy?  Move in with him and service him daily and fix his meals and etc etc. That is not how to treat an animal(that has not put a ring on it) if you plan on keeping it for a while. You must make him thirsty!  Do not give him anything to eat or drink and he will keep coming back? He will be relentless if he is not a real dog.  If not, chalk all up to, Aint nothing but the dawg in him?The new girl Mr Deed went after should have told him to keep stepping. He was disrespecting her also.  He may well have taken his own advice and closed that door before opening another one. Close it real good and put bars on it and a pit bull at the door to keep his butt inside the gate.  who let the dawgs out?  Mr. Deeds AKA Tyler Perry in all his films or the majority of them. Mr deeds is being a player in this movie and it was so distasteful. This is what turns many women into a Diary of a Mad black woman.  How about a movie with a guy respecting a girl and waiting until marriage?  Oh, that does not sell movie tickets. Well it does sell as far as a man worth having?  I did not find that in Mr Deeds anywhere.Money can't buy me love is the correct phrase. Mr Deeds did not have true love.  True love is respectful and does not stray from what is morally correct. This is why there is a show called Basketballs wives.  If he disrespects you in the beginning, he will do it in the end.  The way he begins is the way he ends. Unless someone corrects his butt and tells the animal to get his feet off the couch,get some manners,respect and honor or its over!If it does not work, consider yourself one flea less, of a headache ! ! !",2,Why Didn't I love This Film?

I think the plot for the movie was good but that's where it ended for me. The plot; man see life from new point of view/woman and changes life around. As another reviewer stated (This movie has the feel of ""The Pursuit of Happiness"") the actions of almost all the characters was too unbelievable and stupid for me to feel for them (save Gabriel Union).Lets start with Wesley Deeds (TP).  He comes from money, very smart and has a beautiful live-in girlfriend. However does not want the position at his fathers company, so predicable that girl friend knows his thoughts word for word, line for line and does what ever his mother says. Now on to Lindsey Wakefield (Thandie Newton). Can't get to work on time, Can't get her child to school on time, does not pay the rent or any bills, car falling apart etc...  Yet seems to have the inner sight on philosophy and had to relax and live life... really????? You can't get your child to school, leave child in car alone etc.. Yet you're giving advice to others.  Maybe I'm being picky but let me break it down this way.1. If he is that predictable and boring, what woman would want to be with him and really say they love him and enjoy the relationship? She Natalie (Gabrielle Union) said at the beginning of the movie she did not like the predictable ways about him. Why would you move in and live with that type of person?2. Walter (Brian White) character is way too much of a loose cannon to be working in an office environment. They made his roll way over edge for no reason.  They take his car keys away????? Really???? That's the only way to keep him from driving with a suspended license????. IF YOU HAVE MONEY YOU CAN GET A CAR AND DRIVE!!!!. LEGAL OR ILLEGAL... WTF!!! That just did not make sense.3.  Lindsey Wakefield (Thandie Newton) - You live in a city and don't know anyone????? No co-workers, friends, neighbors in the same building, your child class mates parents etc.... You just don't know anyone at all.???? WTF??? You take your child to a homeless shelter?????? Really when you have a car and any FOOL has seen enough bad things about shelters to know you don't go there unless you`ve exhausted 50 places or ideals to spend the night. THAT WAS JUST DUMB. Going to the dirtiest gas station in San Francisco and that was dumb and stupid.4. **** The one good thing**** Natalie (Gabrielle Union) her role did come with some feelings to it. I loved they way she stated the problem in their relationship and why she went out drinking etc.. How she wanted to do things more spontaneous with him etc.. She again has taken a step forward in her acting.5. Woman down or her luck and faith, finds a good man. He comes to her rescue just in the nick of time and they get together. ""And they lived happily ever after""... The End....Yeah right.I can't see myself ever wanting to see this more then once and not sure how others feel. The ending was so over the top that it really made me think that (TP) has just run out of ideas for projects. As I've said before ""Really""??? You just stood up for yourself for the first time in years and you go to Africa??? Not even a trip to the Islands or South America with your new girlfriend??  Let's just take the child out of school that she has been getting too late for weeks and move her to Africa..WTF??? I did like the use of a new city (San Francisco) other than Atlanta.The music was also different and nice use of old songs like(Cyndi Lauper - time after time etc.) I want to give this less stars with the over the top actions but the over all production was good and again I loved the plot.

Even though he has plenty of money and material things, Wesley is just existing instead of living - going through the motions... until he meets, Lindsey.Lindsey Wakefield is a single mother struggling to make ends meet. No money for rent, money owed for back taxes - she and her daughter (Jordenn Thompson/a very talented little girl) are stuck in a bad situation and Lindsey is seriously stressed.Wesley (Tyler Perry) was the lead male role, but his brother, Walter (Brian J. White), left more of an impression; I was still thinking about White's performance long after the movie ended. Brian J. White sure knows how to play an unlikeable character (thinking of his role in Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All By Myself), but even though Walter had issues, he was my favorite character.  At first I thought he hated women, and then I thought he just plain disliked everybody, but I think Walter had issues with himself and I think he was hurting. The man had a mouth on him, but I loved his honesty.I know times were hard for Lindsey (Thandie Newton) and I know she was doing what she could to survive, but she was too good at lying. She was teaching her daughter to be dishonest and that bothered me. Her attitude in the beginning kept me from liking her, but she became likeable as the movie progressed.Natalie (Gabrielle Union): As soon as the movie began I wondered why she was with Wesley if she had so many complaints about his routine. I'm glad that question was answered, because up to that point I wasn't sure how I felt about her.Wilimena Deeds (Phylicia Rashad): She was an uppity woman who wanted everything her way. I could say she was cold hearted - especially when it came to Walter - but I think it was all a faade.The scene in the elevator was intense and even a bit sad. It said so much without too many words being spoken.

She was over-the-top unprofessional, but he was so on point and focused in promoting the film that I knew I had to give it a shot. And I did.I want to forewarn viewers that I thought I didn't care for ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I (Two-Disc Special Edition),"" but when I watched this film for the first time since it left the movie theater, I realized I loved it a lot more when I didn't have two diarrhea-of-the-mouth boys sitting behind me. Unfortunately three blabbermouth females did the same exact thing through the entire ""Good Deeds"" film so I heard them in one ear while trying to enjoy this movie. While I believe my review is accurate, it may update when I see this movie again after it leaves the show. My views on ""Breaking Dawn"" certainly did. But at the moment and after seeing it yesterday, this is what I have to say.The movie was OK. It reminded me a bit of the tone for ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" It wasn't so much the connection with being homeless but that the film stayed steady. Even on the climactic scene, I was never wow'd. The only scene that really caught my interest was the Makaveli/Casual Day scene. I laughed out loud about that. Other than that, it got to be a bit dull. I think the theme and the purpose of the film was great, and I'm not sure it was a matter of not really getting into Thandie Newton's character (I was never a fan of Gabrielle Union until I saw her in ""Daddy's Little Girls"" and tend to like her more now than ever) or did I want another male lead. I think Tyler Perry is a great actor, but I pondered on whether I'd have preferred he play the role of Brian White and Brian White played HIS role. I was never convinced that Tyler Perry's character meshed well with Gabrielle Union's character and definitely not with Thandie Newton's.But I almost stood up and cheered when I saw Phylicia Rashad. There is no other female actor who I'm more supportive of than her. She could do a commercial and I'd jump up to record it. Anyway, the movie was basically about a rich computer software owner who has a troublesome brother, a meddling mother and a wife who thinks he's too predictable. When a janitor (Newton's character) falls on hard times and ends up a single woman and homeless, he's there to pick up the pieces and find out a few things about his own life.I didn't love it. I didn't hate it. But I'd like to see it at home, alone, to see if maybe later I'll change my mind.",3,It was cool but not mind-blowing,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2912,"[""'d"", 'defended', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'films', 'day', 'one', 'far', 'favorite', 'films', 'are', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Daddy', 'Little', 'Girls', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Madea', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'Fullscreen', 'Edition', 'seeing', 'Madea', 'Big', 'Happy', 'Family', 'paused', 'rethought', 'views', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'films', 'really', 'wanted', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'seeing', 'complimentary', 'tweets', 'Brian', 'White', 'awkward', 'interview', 'Chelsea', 'Handler', 'had', 'Chelsea', 'Lately', 'was', 'over-the-top', 'unprofessional', 'was', 'so', 'point', 'focused', 'promoting', 'film', 'knew', 'had', 'give', 'shot', 'did.I', 'want', 'forewarn', 'viewers', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'left', 'movie', 'theater', 'realized', 'loved', 'lot', 'more', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'two', 'diarrhea-of-the-mouth', 'boys', 'sitting', 'Unfortunately', 'three', 'blabbermouth', 'females', 'did', 'same', 'exact', 'thing', 'entire', 'Good', 'Deeds', 'film', 'heard', 'one', 'ear', 'trying', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'believe', 'review', 'accurate', 'may', 'update', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'show', 'views', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'certainly', 'did', 'moment', 'seeing', 'yesterday', 'what', 'have', 'say.The', 'movie', 'was', 'OK', 'reminded', 'bit', 'tone', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'connection', 'being', 'homeless', 'film', 'stayed', 'steady', 'Even', 'climactic', 'scene', 'was', 'never', 'wow', ""'d"", 'only', 'scene', 'really', 'caught', 'interest', 'was', 'Makaveli/Casual', 'Day', 'scene', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'Other', 'got', 'be', 'bit', 'dull', 'think', 'theme', 'purpose', 'film', 'was', 'great', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'matter', 'not', 'really', 'getting', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'character', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'saw', 'Daddy', 'Little', 'Girls', 'tend', 'like', 'more', 'now', 'ever', 'did', 'want', 'male', 'lead', 'think', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'great', 'actor', 'pondered', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'play', 'role', 'Brian', 'White', 'Brian', 'White', 'played', 'HIS', 'role', 'was', 'never', 'convinced', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'character', 'meshed', 'well', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'character', 'definitely', 'not', 'Thandie', ""Newton's.But"", 'almost', 'stood', 'up', 'cheered', 'when', 'saw', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'other', 'female', 'actor', 'who', ""'m"", 'more', 'supportive', 'could', 'do', 'commercial', ""'d"", 'jump', 'up', 'record', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'was', 'basically', 'rich', 'computer', 'software', 'owner', 'who', 'troublesome', 'brother', 'meddling', 'mother', 'wife', 'who', 'too', 'predictable', 'When', 'janitor', 'Newton', 'character', 'hard', 'times', 'up', 'single', 'woman', 'homeless', 'there', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'find', 'out', 'few', 'things', 'own', 'life.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'home', 'alone', 'see', 'maybe', 'later', ""'ll"", 'change', 'mind']",Tyler Perry's Good Deeds
