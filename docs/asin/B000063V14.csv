696087,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000063V14,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","I would like it if everyone took a page from the Tao of Jimmy Neutron, and before you laugh hysterically at the thought of this, I would encourage you to see Boy Genius yourself.  I went into this film expecting childish humor, a mediocre plotline, and animation that would make the boys at South Park seem like they were working at Pixar ... but alas, I was wrong - dead wrong.  Now, I don't want to say that Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius is the best movie I have ever seen, in fact, it is very rare that I deem any film with those words, but it was worth an hour and a half of my time.  What stood out immediately was the animation, the coloring, the bold attention to detail, and the fact that none of it was lost on the DVD.  Occasionally, you find yourself watching an animated film wondering how many drinks the animators may have had while attempting to create artwork, which suddenly becomes even more visible in the comfort of your own home.  There has been, in my time reviewing these films, one film that has been animated flawlessly.  That was The Incredibles, and while Neutron is not that film, the two do stand very well together.  Aside from the standing ovation animation, the rest of the film is actual a fun watch.  Going into this film with no knowledge of the character Jimmy Neutron or his history, I found myself eager to enjoy more of his adventures and further deeper into his world.One of the enjoyable elements of this film has to be the pacing.  While some will argue that you cannot judge a film by the mere merit of time, for Jimmy Neutron you can.  I didn't want to get bogged down, I didn't want to loose my attention span, and thankfully - with the skilled penmanship of one Steve Oedekerk - I learned to sit back and thoroughly enjoy what Jimmy had to offer.  I wasn't distracted by small, insignificant plot alleys or forgettable characters; with Neutron what you see is what you get.  For approximately 82 minutes we are packed with one exciting element after another without getting sidetracked.  From the opening ""pull"" sequence to the center amusement park transformation, all the way to the final climactic scene which incorporated all the themes and elements from earlier in the film, Neutron honestly didn't let you down.  Strange to hear that coming from a critic that typically goes harsh on the children's films.  For some strange reason, Neutron hooked me and kept a smile on my face during the entire time.  The humor was crisp, the characters were actually enjoyable to watch, and unlike other films of this genre, you knew what was going to happen, but you weren't quite sure how.  I think that is what kept my attention the longest, with the brain power of Neutron; I was never quite sure what he was going to combine next.  The opportunities were endless, and I enjoyed seeing them unfold right before me.  Laugh all you want, but Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius was an enjoyable experience.Why is it that women can do pre-pubescent boy voices better than anyone else?  Just like in The Simpsons we have a young woman doing the voice behind our heroine with the perfect blend of emotion, excitement, and honesty.  I loved the voices in this film mainly because it didn't focus on trying to give you the ""who is that voice"" quiz game, but rather employ unknowns and allow the film to do the talking.  While I have to give the entire cast excellent marks on their work with this film, it was Patrick Stewart and (I can't believe I am saying this...) Martin Short's comical combination that did it for me.  They aren't big stars, so I didn't hear the voice and immediately see the actor, I saw the Martian counterparts that they were trying to portray!  Coupled with the fact that they looked hysterical (humorous physical depictions of alien life), I found myself laughing at this pair more than I imagined.  Stewart controlled his voice and delivered (with ease) some of the best one-liners of this film, while Short added the final punch needed to make the kiddies in the audience laugh.  For me, the two worked brilliantly together and could honestly carry a show of their own together.  Short wasn't over the top, and the two created a strong balance which coupled well with the seriousness of Neutron's quest.With all this praise, one would think that this is a perfect film.  Alas, I cannot give it the full five stars, mainly because of an issue of redundancy.  Perhaps that isn't the right word, but what I am trying to say is that this is a show that prides itself on the genius of the main character, Jimmy.  What makes this show work is that he is by far the smartest child on the Earth, yet his parents keep him grounded (which creates likeability for the viewers) by making him do chores, get in trouble, and create boundaries.  Yet, for all the inventions that Jimmy creates, for all the tests that he passes in school, he seems to forget that there is no air in space and therefore the entire plausibility of all the children in his town flying to this obscure planet is debunked.  I realize that this is a cartoon, a-hem, an animated feature and that I should just accept the fact that in this world there is air in space, but I couldn't buy it.  Without the masks or helmets, I felt cheated and was pulled away from the truth, thus forcing me to realize I was watching a film.  Make sense?  I was deeply involved with this film until the kids rallied together and shot into space, because of the fake nature of it.  I couldn't move past it, and was a discouraging element to the film.Overall, I would strongly suggest this film to families, and in fact, friends.  I thought this was a very funny, very smart, and exceptionally well animated film, especially during the age of Pixar.  The voices were perfect, the pacing (as mentioned before) was a slice of perfection, and the overall molding of this film was nearly flawless.  Outside of the scientific elements that should have been caught (due to the intelligence of our main character), there were moments of pure Oedekerk that made me grin from ear to ear.  Also, if you look closely, there is a great Beetlejuice montage at the beginning and end of the film.  Perhaps it is obscure, but it made me want to watch that classic Keaton film again.  I liked Jimmy Neutron, and while it may get me laughed at on the playground, I thought that for what it was worth, it gave a good 92% -- and that is still an A isn't it?

Litton,"[14, 16]","As far as state-of-the-art computer animation has taken us, &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; isn't first rate, but who said it needed to be, anyway? Here is a movie whose animation reminds us that capturing reality through technology isn't always appealing; for me, this delightful children's movie is a true triumph of comedy and spirited fun, and will no doubt please children as well as adults.The story is based on the Nickelodeon cartoon featuring Jimmy Neutron, a highly intelligent elementary school student whose knowledge of all things scientific wows his father and displeases his mother (&quot;How many times have we told you not to play with rockets?&quot;). He is teased at school for his height and his creativeness, which sometimes carries mixed results, though none of it seems to bother him. His inventive nature drives him to do things like creating a girl-eating plant, burp soda, and launching a satellite made from a household toaster into space.When phlegm-like space aliens retrieve the satellite and discover Earth's coordinates, they descend on Jimmy's town and kidnap all adults as a meal for their ruler, a cross between a chicken and Godzilla. At this point, it's up to Jimmy to save the day.This is a very simple yet entertaining story, devoid of the in-jokes and satirical whimsy of &quot;Shrek,&quot; or the slightly more realistic appearance of Disney's &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies, yet it still manages to please with its childlike innocence and its wonderful humor. Jimmy's creative mind provides for some very wacky shenanigans, including a completely robotic dog named Goddard who is Jimmy's friend for life. He is also supplied with two best friends, a nerdy, timid chub named Carl, and a cartoon fanatic named Sheen, both of whom bring a great deal of laughs to the material.The comedy supplied here reminds us that a movie need not be a satire or parody, or possess abundant bodily function jokes or crude humor to be amusing. As for the computer animation, there's no reason I can think of for which &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; should have been supplied with a completely realistic animation process; in fact, when working with the movie's unrealistic story, it adds to the sense of whimsy and fantasy that makes it such a terrific movie.I expected no more or no less than fun from this latest family feature, and came out with a big smile on my face. Like many of the year's family films, from &quot;Cats and Dogs&quot; and &quot;Spy Kids,&quot; to &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; this film is pleasing for the kiddies while reminding adults of the pleasures of childhood, and that alone is worth it.

696096,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B000063V14,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[2, 3]",Computer animation is poor in this movie but does it really matter?I mean what kind of person would rate a movie on animation?Animation is like a special feature.The animation is not what makes a movie.It's the voice talents and the plot etc that make a movie.That's what I focused on in my veiwing on Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius which is the first computer animation film in the Nick movie seris.Not counting the two Rugrats films this movie was actually all made on the computer.It's not a movie with a bit of adult humor thrown in here and there but the kind of movie that is all for kids just about but parents could enjoy.Adults or parents can enjoy the movie without the extramly brief adult humor unlike Shrek which had alot of it.Why?Because the plot and the idea of it all is interesting.The scene in which the kids make rocket ships from the amusment park to go to space was very interesting and you wouldn't really see that in alot of other films.Basecally the film is good and has alot of great voice talents and evn though I talked about the animation before it is acutally pretty good animation.But what is the movie about is probally the question in your mind.Well then let me begin...The movie begins in the sky where Jimmy Neutron to trying to send a message to a distant galexy via satllelite that looks alot like a toaster.The message gets through the atomosphere but Jimmy and his best friend Carl Weezer don't make it and fall onto the roof of Jimmy's house.After school that day he learns that that night is the grand opening of a new theme park called Retroland.Too bad it's a school night and Jimmy can't go.Jimmy gets grounded that night also because of an accendent that he had and he Carl and his other friend Sheen decide to sneak out.After having a great time they wish that parents would just go away for a little while.There wish comes true when the aliens from the galexy come to Earth to steal the parents and make them sacrificed to there great Lord.At first the kids are happy with no parents and stay up late and eat way to much candy untill they start to miss them.They then embark on a quest to save their parents from the aliens in an adventure in space.I know you probally think it sounds corny but you have to see the movie because of the funny jokes that are inside.Such as Sheen's obession with an action figure Ultra Lord which is possible one of the finniest things in the movie.So Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius is worth the bucks to see it.I recommend it to you and most of the other reveiws do too.It's funny and perfect for children....an adults too.ENJOY!,4,Great for Children and Parents Alike!,1032307200,"09 18, 2002",2002,2596,"['Computer', 'animation', 'poor', 'movie',

696098,AJWDOCM9BLAQ3,B000063V14,Fernando,"[0, 2]","In my opinion, the true mark of a good children movie is one that can entertain and speak to children and adults at different levels. This is a movie children will enjoy but not likely grow into discovering grown-up jokes or a more sophisticated understanding of its theme as they mature. It is very much a vapid story within a framework so arbitrary that anything can happen. Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius it's not so much a children movie as it is a children's movie.I saw this with my daughter when it was first released in theaters and two minutes into it I realized there was just no comparison between it and anything from Pixar or Dreamworks. Prior to the theatrical release Nickelodeon had for months played a number of JN sketches and some were quite funny, but they were all so disjointed I realized after a while they couldn't all possibly be in the movie. And they weren't! This movie was just an attempt to capitalize and promote a show that was going to be on TV.The voice talents are excellent and the animation is good. The characters themselves are funny (especially the dad and Sheen) and stand out from one another, unlike other shows in which several characters seem to speak with the same voice, both physical and from script. Yet the story line is halting and, even for a kid show, inconsistent, i.e. Jimmy travels around the world (before breakfast) in a rocket he made which is faster than military planes but his family is still middle class and makes no money off his super talent/He is a genius but still attends the same class as non-genius -and downright loopy- kids/He travels through space without a space suit, etc. Fantasy is not the issue, but there has to be consistency within the fantasy; there are ""rules"" even in the most fantastic children fantasy universe that keep the story concordant with itself and not, like in JN, flying off the handle and going wherever it wants to. You'd never see a story so loose from Pixar or Dreamworks.Eventually, Jimmy Neutron TV episodes went on to be refreshingly original and unusual for a children show (open endings/bad guys winning) but this movie was a letdown, it surprises me the mostly good reviews it has gotten. Whereas I'm just as excited -if not more- than my daughter about whatever new CGI movie is released, with JN I kept glancing at my watch and mentally balancing my check book.There are worse children movies you can buy, but there are not many of them.",2,"Way, Way Sub Par",1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,2442,"['opinion', 'true', 'mark', 'good', 'children', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'entertain', 'speak', 'children', 'adults', 'different', 'levels', 'movie', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'not', 'likely', 'grow', 'discovering', 'grown-up', 'jokes', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'understanding', 'theme', 'mature', 'very', 'much', 'vapid', 'story', 'framework', 'so', 'arbitrary', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'Jimmy', 'Neutron', 'Boy', 'Genius', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'children', 'movie', 'children', 'movie.I', 'saw', 'daughter', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'theaters', 'two', 'minutes', 'realized', 'was', 'just', 'comparison', 'anything', 'Pixar', 'Dreamworks', 'Prior', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Nickelodeon', 'had', 'months', 'played', 'number', 'JN', 'sketches', 'were', 'quite', 'funny', 'were', 'so', 'disjointed', 'realized', 'while', 'could', ""n't"", 'all', 'possibly', 'be', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'attempt', 'capitalize', 'promote', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'TV.The', 'voice', 'talents', 'are', 'excellent', 'animation', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'funny', 'especially', 'dad', 'Sheen', 'stand', 'out', 'one', 'other', 'shows', 'several', 'characters', 'seem', 'speak', 'same', 'voice', 'physical', 'script', 'story', 'line', 'halting', 'even', 'kid', 'show', 'inconsistent', 'i.e', 'Jimmy', 'world', 'breakfast', 'rocket', 'made', 'faster', 'military', 'planes', 'family', 'still', 'middle', 'class', 'money', 'super', 'talent/He', 'genius', 'still', 'same', 'class', 'non-genius', '-and', 'downright', 'loopy-', 'kids/He', 'travels', 'space', 'space', 'suit', 'etc', 'Fantasy', 'not', 'issue', 'there', 'be', 'consistency', 'fantasy', 'are', 'rules', 'even', 'most', 'fantastic', 'children', 'fantasy', 'universe', 'keep', 'story', 'concordant', 'not', 'JN', 'flying', 'off', 'handle', 'going', ""'d"", 'never', 'see', 'story', 'so', 'loose', 'Pixar', 'Dreamworks.Eventually', 'Jimmy', 'Neutron', 'TV', 'episodes', 'went', 'be', 'refreshingly', 'original', 'unusual', 'children', 'show', 'open', 'endings/bad', 'guys', 'winning', 'movie', 'was', 'letdown', 'mostly', 'good', 'reviews', 'gotten', ""'m"", 'just', 'as', 'excited', 'not', 'more-', 'daughter', 'new', 'CGI', 'movie', 'released', 'JN', 'kept', 'glancing', 'watch', 'mentally', 'balancing', 'check', 'are', 'worse', 'children', 'movies', 'can', 'buy', 'are', 'not', 'many']",Jimmy Neutron - Boy Genius VHS

696107,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B000063V14,Mike,"[12, 14]","""Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius"" (2001)It is rare that an animated children's film comes along and reminds us exactly how much fun it was to be a kid. Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius is one of those movies that makes you want to go back to those days and play with your gadgets and have fun. Instead of doing that you could just watch this splendid film. It's about as suitable for kids as it is for adults, and I'm sure even though the movie is unrealistic, everyone will view Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius as it was meant to be viewed - a fun-filled, imaginative and faithful adaptation to the TV show I have not yet seen.The movie's plot is fairly simple - some kids' parents are kidnapped by aliens so its up to the children to save the day - but the wizardry is not in the plot. The real fantastical thing about the movie is the fact that Jimmy Neutron is a boy-genius and this offers for some terrific belly laughs. The fact that this young child can invent things that children and even some adults can only dream about is brilliant and it brings the movie vividly to life. Jimmy can invent edible bubble-gum which blows up to be a type of transport, burp soda, a mechanical dog named Goddard, a plant which is robotically engineered to eat girls, and many other things. Neutron's inventions are what save the day in the end and they are memorably creative and you'll wish you had some of the things that Jimmy could invent.The film's humour is absolutely stunning. You've got the chance to see a giant octopus and rollercoaster ride in space, see Channel 7 news run by children and the characters themselves bring many smiles and laughs to the movie. Jimmy Neutron is a funny man himself, very scientific and uses a lot of big words and metaphorical slangs (funny since he is so young), but it isn't him that steals the show. For me, the sidekicks really steal the show which is so often the case in many comedies. Carl is Jimmy's best friend, a glasses-wearing, chubby and thick guy, and he has the coolest voice and I just thought his lines and character in general were very cute. For the kids Sheen will be terrific. His obsession with a cartoon character Ultra Lord offers many belly laughs. And then of course there's Goddard, Neutron's mechanical dog, who has many gadgets and insertions, and he ultimately takes the cake and is the most inventive (and that's out of a lot) thing in the film.Sure, the movie does have a couple of problems. There are still some questions you'll want answered like I wondered if the parents were only abducted from Jimmy's home town or from all over the world. And how could the children just ""breathe"" in space? But of course you've got to remember this movie is mostly intended to be seen by children so those 2 are excusable in some senses. What disappointed me slightly is that the movie is really quite predictable overall. The gadgets and ideas in the movie are indescriably entertaining and you don't expect them, but the plot doesn't have any major twists and turns and you just know how the movie is going to end. I also wanted to see more of Jimmy's class teacher, who is the funniest character in the entire film and has yet 2 scenes.However, what remains of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius is a terrific animated movie with great memorable quotes and some amazing ideas. It is worth seeing in the theatres for its creative genius and great photography.

Though the concept of all parents disappearing and the kids' initial jubilation and subsequent sadness over the situation has been done before, this movie kept the scenario fresh and entertaining.  While a serious suspension of disbelief is required throughout the film (i.e. just about anything taking place in outer space), it is a kids' film and kids will love it.

The colors are bright and kid friendly, yet the dialogue, allusions and spoofs of everything from teen movies to comic books will entertain adults.The animators have decided not to tread down the path that Pixar and SKG have gone with Toy Story and Shrek, i.e. the attempt to &quot;copy&quot; reality, and have, instead, pursued the outlandish whackiness that cartoons used to be known for. If some have criticized the animation, then they have been comparing apples to oranges.We have kept our daughter (4 1/2) away from Nickolodeon because we find it generally tasteless, crass and repulsive--thus we were very pleasantly surprised at the result.The characters are interesting and well drawn and played to the hilt by everyone involved.One can only hope the inevitable sequels are done with as much verve and cleverness.A couple of nitpicky items: I agree with the observations of some that Jimmy's father could be more complexly drawn. In this film he is a mere compliment (pun intended) to Jimmy's fiercely brilliant mother. It would also be a good thing for the children if there were a couple of adults (other than his mother) who were a LITTLE smarter than the actual teachers most of us had in school.

In this case, however, I'm going to qualify that approach: this isn't a film in any way aimed at adults.

When it comes to character and character development, plot, and the level of the humor, this is something very clearly made for children.Can adults enjoy it? Well... yes... in the sense that if you're an adult who's seriously into animation, I wouldn't specifically advise you to avoid it. Plus, I think many grown-ups will rather appreciate the charm of this film's delightfully retro take on ""hi-tech"". Its aesthetic owes much to the futurism of the 1950's and early 60's, which I myself love. But (again, speaking strictly as a grown-up) that's as much as I can say of it.Personally, I enjoy the spin-off TV series rather more. It isn't necessarily any better, you understand.
