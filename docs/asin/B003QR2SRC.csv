1359192,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B003QR2SRC,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[1, 1]","Exploding Girl starring Zoe Kazan may not make everyone feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Some people might think this film is boring and that nothing significant happens to Ivy (Kazan) or that they might think this film tries too hard to be current or hip. The thing I take away from Exploding Girl is that this is a story of a young College girl who feels alone and out of place in the world and somewhow I can relate to that which makes this a memorable film to me. I've seen Zoe Kazan in a few films prior to this one, I never really took a strong interest in her before but after watching this film, I think it is very obvious that Kazan is an exceptional, gifted actress. Her character Ivy suffers from seizures and her relationship with her boyfriend Greg is on the verge of collapse whom she communicates with via cell phone. I like her friend Al and how their friendship takes an unexpected turn at the end of the film, it's beautiful and subtle and oh so realistic! I love this film, it's my own secret treasure! It might not move everyone but it moved me.",5,A slice of Indie heaven.,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,1064,"['Exploding', 'Girl', 'starring', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'everyone', 'feel', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'inside', 'people', 'might', 'think', 'film', 'boring', 'nothing', 'significant', 'Ivy', 'Kazan', 'might', 'think', 'film', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'current', 'hip', 'thing', 'take', 'away', 'Exploding', 'Girl', 'story', 'young', 'College', 'girl', 'who', 'alone', 'place', 'world', 'somewhow', 'can', 'relate', 'memorable', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'few', 'films', 'prior', 'one', 'never', 'really', 'took', 'strong', 'interest', 'before', 'watching', 'film', 'think', 'very', 'obvious', 'Kazan', 'exceptional', 'gifted', 'actress', 'character', 'Ivy', 'suffers', 'seizures', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'Greg', 'verge', 'collapse', 'whom', 'cell', 'phone', 'friend', 'Al', 'how', 'friendship', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'end', 'film', 'beautiful', 'subtle', 'oh', 'so', 'realistic', 'love', 'film', 'own', 'secret', 'treasure', 'might', 'not', 'move', 'everyone', 'moved']",The Exploding Girl

1359194,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B003QR2SRC,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[7, 7]","Hey. Hey. Oh Hey...Every phone conversation starts like this. The only difference, sometimes Ivy doesn't say hey a second time.Not much happens in this film. Ivy and Al arrive at her mother's New York City house for summer college break. Ivy is involved with a faceless person that we get to know through their phone calls (mostly voice mail). Al ends up staying at Ivy's house; his parents have converted his room into a Tantric Sex room. The passage of time isn't obvious, it looks like only a few nights, but in reality the film spans most of the summer.Exploding Girl is a slow moving, delicate, independent film. Shot with a Red Digital camera, every shot is rock solid, with minimal panning. Each scene is very carefully constructed and deliberate, the director uses framing effectively. Unfortunately, not every single shot is in focus. Even with this sometimes major fault, I loved this film. The director uses very slow pacing, shots run on for a good long time. The editing matches the feel of the film, take time to get to know the character and what they just did. Frequently foreground objects obstruct the frame. In the subway, it turns out none of this was planned; they bootlegged filming in the subway as described in the bonus making of featurette.This is a sensual film. The chemistry between Ivy and Al develops slowly. Ivy is shy, Al is a bit more outgoing, but not by much. There is no nudity. There is one scene where Al and another girl smoke marijuana. I don't recall any strong language. The scene where Ivy has a seizure is done from a distance, but it is very clear what is happening.I loved the character development. It felt like real life, getting to know Ivy and Al, and peripherally her mother and the disembodied boy friend, slowly. At about an hour and twenty minutes, the film seems like it is the right length.This isn't a film for everyone. My enjoyment of this film is the careful framing, slow editing, muted colors, and slow character development. I liked these two characters.",5,Hey.......

She goes to a few parties where other homely girls congregate. Her boyfriend breaks up with her but she doesn't say anything. It's a fine line between trying to show the inner emotions of someone without dramatic dialogue and showing that someone is emotionally dysfunctional. This one veers too far toward the latter.Also, the dialogue between the characters makes them seem like Middle School students, not college. I mean, this guy tells his friend that he's been hanging out with this girl for a few months and he thinks he ""likes"" her and they almost kissed... but not quite. How old are these people?

1359200,AGHZCRWBR9XML,B003QR2SRC,"Preferred Customer ""C. Edman""","[1, 1]","A short, yet slow film, that obviously isn't for everyone, but, for those who it *is* for, those who'll enjoy this ultra low-budget examination of friendship and romance, for us, it's like bittersweet candy. Ivy, played by the beautiful Zoe Kazan, has epilepsy(The name, Exploding Girl is a double entendre, for one, she has epilepsy, shown in one scene to heart-breaking effect, and also in regards for her angst and ennui regarding her relationships and confusions with them.) Her friend Al, played by Mark Rendall(Who really should be in more and more movies, he seems like a star in my opinion.) is staying at her place during a break in College(I think Spring Break, but I'm honestly not sure.) But over the course of this 80 minute film, Ivy goes back and forth emotionally with a boyfriend she only hears of in brief, uneventful phone calls that mirror the phone conversations we have in real life, we attempt to have long, rich conversations through a hand-held device, yet end up saying ""good-bye"" before anything of use or wealth is said. The fact that the film unfolds slowly, and feels slow, and yet only lasts 80 minutes is a toast to the writing and performances. Some will say its boring because of this, but to me, it was just about as realistic as you could get, and very fun and heart-warming to see these events play out the way they did, because, in real life, relationships dont get kick-started with a jolt of energy like they do in most movies, they take a lot of time and a lot of missed opportunities and seemingly lost chances and inhibitions. To me, this film was just about perfect. Its what I love in modern independent film-making, short, cheap, to the point, effective, lovely, and sweet. Whilst also being true. And if you are the kind to be able to sit through a movie like this, the ending will definitely pay off for you. But for those unaware of what they're getting into, expecting a John Hughes romance, you're not gonna get it. But, as said before, if this is what you want, what you're looking for, then seek no more, you've found it!",5,"Oh, oh so lovely",1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,2074,"['short', 'yet', 'slow', 'film', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'who', '*is*', 'who', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'ultra', 'low-budget', 'examination', 'friendship', 'romance', 'like', 'bittersweet', 'candy', 'Ivy', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'epilepsy', 'name', 'Exploding', 'Girl', 'double', 'entendre', 'one', 'epilepsy', 'shown', 'one', 'scene', 'heart-breaking', 'effect', 'also', 'regards', 'angst', 'ennui', 'regarding', 'relationships', 'confusions', 'friend', 'Al', 'played', 'Mark', 'Rendall', 'Who', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'more', 'movies', 'star', 'opinion', 'staying', 'place', 'break', 'College', 'think', 'Spring', 'Break', ""'m"", 'honestly', 'not', 'sure', 'course', '80', 'minute', 'film', 'Ivy', 'back', 'emotionally', 'boyfriend', 'only', 'brief', 'uneventful', 'phone', 'mirror', 'phone', 'conversations', 'have', 'real', 'life', 'attempt', 'have', 'long', 'rich', 'conversations', 'hand-held', 'device', 'yet', 'end', 'up', 'saying', 'good-bye', 'anything', 'use', 'wealth', 'said', 'fact', 'film', 'slowly', 'feels', 'slow', 'yet', 'only', '80', 'minutes', 'toast', 'writing', 'performances', 'will', 'say', 'boring', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'realistic', 'could', 'get', 'very', 'fun', 'heart-warming', 'see', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'way', 'did', 'real', 'life', 'relationships', 'dont', 'get', 'kick-started', 'jolt', 'energy', 'do', 'most', 'movies', 'take', 'lot', 'time', 'lot', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'seemingly', 'lost', 'chances', 'inhibitions', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'what', 'love', 'modern', 'independent', 'film-making', 'short', 'cheap', 'point', 'effective', 'lovely', 'sweet', 'Whilst', 'also', 'being', 'true', 'are', 'kind', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'movie', 'ending', 'will', 'definitely', 'pay', 'off', 'unaware', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'expecting', 'John', 'Hughes', 'romance', ""'re"", 'not', 'gon', 'get', 'said', 'what', 'want', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'then', 'seek', 'more', ""'ve"", 'found']",The Exploding Girl

Her kind-natured childhood friend, Al (Mark Rendall), needs a place to stay over the summer and rooms with Ivy and her mother. As the summer progresses Ivy's increasingly disinterested boyfriend, Greg, ends their relationship via cellphone. Ivy's a sensitive soul struggling with epilepsy, keeping her emotions wrapped up tightly inside. Her faithful friend, Al, reaches out as Ivy sinks into despair. Will Ivy reach back? Will romance spark?The Exploding Girl is a sweet, little film which explores the angst of young love. Zoe Kazan, the granddaughter of legendary film director, Elia Kaza, gives a wonderfully touching performance. Rendall does a nice job as Ivy's good-hearted friend.
