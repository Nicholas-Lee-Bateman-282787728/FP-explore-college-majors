Okay, I admit that it plays the facts quite loosely, but the story is so clever this movie should be a Christmas classic.  It follows St. Nicholas from ancient times through all the nooks and turns that it might have taken to arrive at the modern traditions of Santa Clause.  Parents will laugh at some of the imaginative ways this movie conceives for the origin of Santa traditions, and kids will love the story just because it is the story of Santa!",5,Should Be a Christmas Classic for Kids,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,546,"['are', 'looking', 'very', 'imaginative', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'one', 'kids', 'Okay', 'admit', 'facts', 'quite', 'loosely', 'story', 'so', 'clever', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'St.', 'Nicholas', 'ancient', 'times', 'nooks', 'might', 'have', 'taken', 'arrive', 'modern', 'traditions', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Parents', 'will', 'laugh', 'imaginative', 'ways', 'movie', 'origin', 'Santa', 'traditions', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'story', 'just', 'story', 'Santa']",N/A

O'DELL ""njsquarebear""","[2, 2]","This is a nice film for younger viewers and their parents to watch together as it purports to explain through the art of story-telling how the various traditions connected to Santa Claus came to be.  It is significant as it is (to my knowledge) the first popular movie that describes Santa's origins in the Saint Nicholas story of eastern europe then Holland.  And significant in describing the Dutch tradition of Santa's Moorish (African-American) assistant.  So as another reviewer here points out, the Santa Claus story has a culturally-significant male 'sidekick' who is dark-skinned, which'll help non-white kids connect better to the Santa story.... which is significantly better than say, showing black elves at the North Pole as does all those Santa 'Clause' movies!  Hume Cronyn and James Earl Jones are always a delight to watch; they're both great grandfather-material.
