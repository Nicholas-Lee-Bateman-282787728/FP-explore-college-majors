He warns Steve to stop seeing this ""dame"" and to start treating his daughter right. Steve ignores Stag, and continues the affair. Sooo, the Sergeant pays a visit to the home-wrecking ""tramp"" in order to give her a good talking to. Uh-oh! It seems that old Stag's a bit high strung and within minutes, the woman is dead! Now, Stag does the honorable thing, he covers the whole thing up! As the story unfolds, Stag grows increasingly anxious, especially when he and his partner (Murray Hamilton- JAWS) investigate the homicide!  A TATTERED WEB is a fine made-for-TV movie from 1971. Bridges is perfectly intense and maniacally driven in his role. Watch for Broderick Crawford as a bum, and John Fiedler and Whit Bissell in minor roles... .",4,"""I Don't Pay Social Calls On Tramps!""...",1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,895,"['Lioyd', 'Bridges', 'tough', 'cop', 'named', 'Sergeant', 'Edward', 'Stag', 'who', 'son', 'in-law', 'named', 'Steve', 'out', 'cheating', 'daughter', 'Steve', 'stop', 'seeing', 'dame', 'start', 'treating', 'daughter', 'right', 'Steve', 'Stag', 'affair', 'Sooo', 'Sergeant', 'visit', 'home-wrecking', 'tramp', 'order', 'give', 'good', 'talking', 'Uh-oh', 'old', 'Stag', 'bit', 'high', 'strung', 'minutes', 'woman', 'dead', 'Now', 'Stag', 'honorable', 'thing', 'whole', 'thing', 'up', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Stag', 'increasingly', 'anxious', 'especially', 'when', 'partner', 'Murray', 'Hamilton-', 'JAWS', 'investigate', 'homicide', 'TATTERED', 'WEB', 'fine', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', '1971', 'Bridges', 'perfectly', 'intense', 'maniacally', 'driven', 'role', 'Watch', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'bum', 'John', 'Fiedler', 'Whit', 'Bissell', 'minor', 'roles']",N/A

So far I haven't seen anything Lloyd Bridges did that wasn't good.  When I was in Jr. High, I lived in an ordinary everyday neighborhood.  Lloyd Bridges was doing Sea Hunt then & lived two blocks away.  When my two girl friends and I walked to our park we went by his house.  If he was outside doing some work or playing basketball with Jeff and/or Beau he always said HI to us & said we should have a good day or going to the park girls?  I've always remembered how down to earth he was---not how some stars (?) are today.  This isn't a Airplane movie, a Hot Shots one but a who dunit----I now know WHO DUNIT----will you know WHO DUNIT????  He is strong in this & his acting reminds me of how he was in High Noon---strong, forceful.  So, if you like Lloyd Bridges then I think you'd enjoy this.",5,after sea hunt,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,917,"['When', 'found', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'read', 'details', '-it', 'sounded', 'good', 'was', 'real', 'good', 'suspenseful', 'far', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'When', 'was', 'Jr.', 'High', 'lived', 'ordinary', 'everyday', 'neighborhood', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'was', 'doing', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'then', 'lived', 'two', 'blocks', 'away', 'When', 'two', 'girl', 'friends', 'walked', 'park', 'went', 'house', 'was', 'outside', 'doing', 'work', 'playing', 'basketball', 'Jeff', 'and/or', 'Beau', 'always', 'said', 'HI', 'said', 'should', 'have', 'good', 'day', 'going', 'park', 'girls', ""'ve"", 'always', 'remembered', 'how', 'down', 'earth', 'was', '-not', 'how', 'stars', 'are', 'today', ""n't"", 'Airplane', 'movie', 'Hot', 'Shots', 'one', 'who', 'dunit', 'now', 'know', 'WHO', 'DUNIT', 'will', 'know', 'WHO', 'DUNIT', 'strong', 'acting', 'how', 'was', 'High', 'Noon', '-strong', 'forceful', 'So', 'like', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'then', 'think', ""'d"", 'enjoy']",N/A

825021,A1JEFESGLIS076,B00025X0X2,rsoonsa,"[1, 3]","A critically important component of virtually all successful cinema is suspense, a perception of uncertainty within the viewer as to what may ensue from the events occurring upon the screen, whichever genre, present even when we know an outcome (APOLLO 13) if the work is done well; all of which is meant to point to a total absence of suspense in this weakly directed feature, that dully plods from scene to scene until its flat ending. Lloyd Bridges, cast as police sergeant Ed Stagg, has discovered that the husband (Frank Converse) of his daughter Tina (Sallie Shockley) is dallying with a local chippy and during Stagg's attempts to end the adultery, he accidentally commits a murder, upon which he forges a plan to place responsibility for the crime upon a local inebriate, tangentially providing a question of the title: was Scott's ""What a tangled web we weave..."" (Marmion) the intended source, inaptly transposed into ""tattered""? (an amendment that would be of a piece within this poorly crafted affair). The film is steeped in cliche, hampered by a witless score, and the acting from the three mentioned leads is often embarrassingly bad, notably in the case of Bridges, which might be attributed to the hackneyed script if it were not that Anne Helm as the doxy and Murray Hamilton as Stagg's partner manage to make something of their material, while Broderick Crawford rises above his during his few scenes.",1,ONE SHOULD ENDEAVOUR TO MISS THIS ONE.,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,1420,"['critically', 'important', 'component', 'virtually', 'successful', 'cinema', 'suspense', 'perception', 'uncertainty', 'viewer', 'what', 'may', 'ensue', 'events', 'occurring', 'screen', 'genre', 'present', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'outcome', 'APOLLO', '13', 'work', 'done', 'well', 'meant', 'point', 'total', 'absence', 'suspense', 'weakly', 'directed', 'feature', 'dully', 'plods', 'scene', 'scene', 'flat', 'ending', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'cast', 'police', 'sergeant', 'Ed', 'Stagg', 'discovered', 'husband', 'Frank', 'Converse', 'daughter', 'Tina', 'Sallie', 'Shockley', 'dallying', 'local', 'chippy', 'Stagg', 'attempts', 'end', 'adultery', 'accidentally', 'murder', 'plan', 'place', 'responsibility', 'crime', 'local', 'inebriate', 'tangentially', 'providing', 'question', 'title', 'was', 'Scott', 'What', 'tangled', 'web', 'weave', 'Marmion', 'intended', 'source', 'inaptly', 'transposed', 'tattered', 'amendment', 'would', 'be', 'piece', 'poorly', 'crafted', 'affair', 'film', 'steeped', 'cliche', 'hampered', 'witless', 'score', 'acting', 'three', 'mentioned', 'leads', 'often', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'notably', 'case', 'Bridges', 'might', 'be', 'attributed', 'hackneyed', 'script', 'were', 'not', 'Anne', 'Helm', 'doxy', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'Stagg', 'partner', 'manage', 'make', 'something', 'material', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'few', 'scenes']",N/A
