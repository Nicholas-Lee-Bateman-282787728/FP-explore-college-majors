429053,A355VZC33RZGNA,6304584598,A Viewer and Reader,"[29, 30]","This version of Swan Lake, staged by Nureyev for the Vienna State Opera  Ballet in 1964, was an historic and artistic blockbuster.  In contrast to  Balanchine's view that &quot;ballet is woman&quot; Nureyev focused on the  male dancer's role  and in showcasing his own talents arrived at a  breakthrough in emphasis on the male dancer in ballet.Makarova's 1988  version derived from Petipa and Ashton, and mounted for the London Festival  Ballet, offers the standard Prince who poses, prances, and rarely dances,  and is such a pathetic fellow that one cannot imagine dying for him.  Nureyev complained, &quot;The Prince sits on his ass for thirty-five  minutes and then has to walk,&quot; (instead of dance).  Discerning a  deeply sinister mood in Tchaikovsky's music Nureyev added psychological  depth to Swan Lake by introducing an unhappy ending in which Seigfried  drowns in his struggle to be reunited with Odette.  The Prince's obsession  with the Queen Of Swans, the ideal woman, destroys him.  Thus the emphasis  of the drama is on Seigfried rather than Odette, and for him to be seen as  a tragic figure rather than a mere pawn demanded the first rate character  portrayal that Nureyev brought to his dancing.Totally recasting the  brooding passive Seigfried into an active character Nureyev introduced the  Prince into the first act birthday entertainment normally danced by two  girls and a boy. Nureyev recast this for two girls, two boys, and himself,  dancing with them separately, together, and with energetic outgoing solos  for himself.  Having described the Prince as &quot;an unusual man ready for  unusual things to happen to him&quot; he inserted the Danse Du Prince  before the Coda, an unheard of solo for himself conveying Seigfried's sense  of romantic anticipation and pursuit of the ideal.In the second act  lakeside scene with the swans Odette's charms are usually displayed for  Seigfried by his hunting companion, Bonno.  Nureyev dispensed with Bonno  entirely and took all the steps for himself.  The result is a perfect  bonding between the Prince and Odette.  His coupling with Fonteyn was  sublime, and in a ballet traditionally reserved for the display of the  ballerina's technique the inspiration that he brought to his role created a  synergism of ever more dramatic expression between them.Nureyev left act  three essentially unchanged since the danser's role is so prominent  although he added steps as bravura as Odile's including a series of  whipping turns to match her famous 32 fouettes.  Fonteyn's Odile was more  sweetly flirtatious than coldly dazzling and cunning.  In Makarova's  version Evelynn Hart very effectively projected the pride, arrogancce, and  disdain underneath Odile's seductiveness.For act four Nureyev created  an elegiac pas de deux following his frantic discovery of Odette.  It is  one of the most beautiful dances of the ballet, perfectly conveying the  poignancy of the coming separation.  The conventional happy ending with  Prince Seigfried and Odette reunited in death is incomprehensible at the  end of the ballet unless one has read the narrative. Nureyev's unhappy  ending seems more in keeping with the action and Tchaikovsky's musical mood  of storm swept tragedy, abandoned romanticism, and brooding  melancholy.At first Fonteyn was so upset with Nureyev's changes that he  ended up kicking her out of a rehearsal, but they soon reconciled and went  on as if nothing had happened.  Over the orchestra's strong objections  Nureyev insisted that the tempi be slowed so he could bring out the nuances  of emotion he was seeking.  His version of Swan Lake was a smashing success  with the public.  At the last performance of the premier in Vienna he and  Fonteyn received 89 curtain calls, the most ever taken.In this film of  the ballet restrained camerawork and intelligent editing have defined the  essential choreography and dramatic effects.  The camera angles and  close-ups capture rather than destroy the patterns and enchainments as is  so often the case when &quot;creative film-making&quot; makes a hash of the  choreography.  As other reviewers have noted this DVD may not be entirely  up the technically achievable standard but it is so far superior to  anything available on VHS, and brings such clarity and presence to the  performance, that its few flaws can be forgiven.  Nureyev's Swan Lake  belongs in every ballet lover's collection, and it is fervently to be hoped  that this DVD is but the first in an avalanche of these great ballets on  perfect DVD's.",5,Nureyev's Swan Lake A Quantum Jete,965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,4552,"['version', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'staged', 'Nureyev', 'Vienna', 'State', 'Opera', 'Ballet', '1964', 'was', 'historic', 'artistic', 'blockbuster', 'contrast', 'Balanchine', 'view', 'quot', 'ballet', 'woman', 'quot', 'Nureyev', 'focused', 'male', 'dancer', 'role', 'showcasing', 'own', 'talents', 'arrived', 'breakthrough', 'emphasis', 'male', 'dancer', 'ballet.Makarova', '1988', 'version', 'derived', 'Petipa', 'Ashton', 'mounted', 'London', 'Festival', 'Ballet', 'standard', 'Prince', 'who', 'prances', 'rarely', 'dances', 'such', 'pathetic', 'fellow', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'dying', 'Nureyev', 'complained', 'quot', 'Prince', 'sits', 'ass', 'thirty-five', 'minutes', 'then', 'walk', 'quot', 'instead', 'dance', 'Discerning', 'deeply', 'sinister', 'mood', 'Tchaikovsky', 'music', 'Nureyev', 'added', 'psychological', 'depth', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'introducing', 'unhappy', 'ending', 'Seigfried', 'drowns', 'struggle', 'be', 'reunited', 'Odette', 'Prince', 'obsession', 'Queen', 'Swans', 'ideal', 'woman', 'Thus', 'emphasis', 'drama', 'Seigfried', 'rather', 'Odette', 'be', 'seen', 'tragic', 'figure', 'rather', 'mere', 'pawn', 'demanded', 'first', 'rate', 'character', 'portrayal', 'Nureyev', 'brought', 'dancing.Totally', 'recasting', 'brooding', 'passive', 'Seigfried', 'active', 'character', 'Nureyev', 'introduced', 'Prince', 'first', 'act', 'birthday', 'entertainment', 'normally', 'danced', 'two', 'girls', 'boy', 'Nureyev', 'recast', 'two', 'girls', 'two', 'boys', 'dancing', 'separately', 'together', 'energetic', 'outgoing', 'solos', 'Having', 'described', 'Prince', 'quot', 'unusual', 'man', 'ready', 'unusual', 'things', 'happen', 'quot', 'inserted', 'Danse', 'Du', 'Prince', 'Coda', 'unheard', 'solo', 'conveying', 'Seigfried', 'sense', 'romantic', 'anticipation', 'pursuit', 'ideal.In', 'second', 'act', 'lakeside', 'scene', 'swans', 'Odette', 'charms', 'are', 'usually', 'displayed', 'Seigfried', 'hunting', 'companion', 'Bonno', 'Nureyev', 'dispensed', 'Bonno', 'entirely', 'took', 'steps', 'result', 'perfect', 'bonding', 'Prince', 'Odette', 'coupling', 'Fonteyn', 'was', 'sublime', 'ballet', 'traditionally', 'reserved', 'display', 'ballerina', 'technique', 'inspiration', 'brought', 'role', 'created', 'synergism', 'ever', 'more', 'dramatic', 'expression', 'them.Nureyev', 'left', 'act', 'three', 'essentially', 'unchanged', 'danser', 'role', 'so', 'prominent', 'added', 'steps', 'as', 'bravura', 'Odile', 'including', 'series', 'whipping', 'turns', 'match', 'famous', '32', 'fouettes', 'Fonteyn', 'Odile', 'was', 'more', 'sweetly', 'flirtatious', 'coldly', 'dazzling', 'cunning', 'Makarova', 'version', 'Evelynn', 'Hart', 'very', 'effectively', 'projected', 'pride', 'arrogancce', 'disdain', 'underneath', 'Odile', 'seductiveness.For', 'act', 'four', 'Nureyev', 'created', 'elegiac', 'pas', 'deux', 'following', 'frantic', 'discovery', 'Odette', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'dances', 'ballet', 'perfectly', 'conveying', 'poignancy', 'coming', 'separation', 'conventional', 'happy', 'ending', 'Prince', 'Seigfried', 'Odette', 'reunited', 'death', 'incomprehensible', 'end', 'ballet', 'one', 'read', 'narrative', 'Nureyev', 'unhappy', 'ending', 'more', 'keeping', 'action', 'Tchaikovsky', 'musical', 'mood', 'storm', 'swept', 'tragedy', 'abandoned', 'romanticism', 'brooding', 'melancholy.At', 'first', 'Fonteyn', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'Nureyev', 'changes', 'ended', 'up', 'kicking', 'out', 'rehearsal', 'soon', 'reconciled', 'went', 'nothing', 'had', 'happened', 'orchestra', 'strong', 'objections', 'Nureyev', 'insisted', 'tempi', 'be', 'slowed', 'could', 'bring', 'out', 'nuances', 'emotion', 'was', 'seeking', 'version', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'was', 'smashing', 'success', 'public', 'last', 'performance', 'premier', 'Vienna', 'Fonteyn', 'received', '89', 'curtain', 'calls', 'most', 'ever', 'taken.In', 'film', 'ballet', 'restrained', 'camerawork', 'intelligent', 'editing', 'have', 'defined', 'essential', 'choreography', 'dramatic', 'effects', 'camera', 'angles', 'close-ups', 'capture', 'rather', 'destroy', 'patterns', 'enchainments', 'so', 'often', 'case', 'when', 'quot', 'creative', 'film-making', 'quot', 'hash', 'choreography', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'DVD', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'technically', 'achievable', 'standard', 'so', 'far', 'superior', 'anything', 'available', 'VHS', 'brings', 'such', 'clarity', 'presence', 'performance', 'few', 'flaws', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Nureyev', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'belongs', 'ballet', 'lover', 'collection', 'fervently', 'be', 'hoped', 'DVD', 'first', 'avalanche', 'great', 'ballets', 'perfect', 'DVD']",Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake
429054,A1THJ5GJF9NLCS,6304584598,"BLee ""bpslee""","[9, 10]","4 Stars?Well, when Margot Fonteyn danced, every single motion or gesture of hers was a poem of utmost beauty and she herself was the embodiment of supreme elegance. In view of the duration of her part here, she herself alone deserves 7 stars! Nureyev himself also deserves 6 stars as a dancer: there is hardly anyone either from Kirov or any other place who could seriously challenge him. The rest, especially by today's standard, are all 5 star ballerinas, and there are masses of them here.For most ballet music, the composers tailor made their music to the requirements of the choreography. Tsaichovsky was an exception, his musical imagination was given a free hand: the original choreographist accommodated him and changed some of his part in accordance with his music. That partly explains why Tsaichovsky's Swan Lake or Sleeping Beauty was such great music outshinging any other ballet music. Anyway, music and choreography in ballet should go either hand in hand or as glove befitting hand. Here lies the main drawback of this DVD: the choreography doesn't tie in well with the music and was often at odd with it! Nureyev, however great a dancer he was, didn't have good ears for music, it could also be seen from the conductor of the accompanying orchestra he preferred (?) whose treatment of Swan Lake is so out of line.Nureyev introduced some new and novel elements in his choreography, notably the use of properties, say the roses, the bow and arrow, and the large clothes representing waves on the stage that at last engulfed the prince. He also mobilized masses of ballerinas to create various shapes, making them as scented as flowers. Even when they are only some simple geometric matrixes, they are equally spectacular especially when seen from a height.The stage settings are great, the costumes too and there are numerous of them. Of course, viewers must bear in mind that however brilliant the photography was, it was filmed in 1968 after all. Furthermore, there are at times some makeshifts, however brief that may be, they are quite prosaic or even static: Nureyev was by then not as matured a choreographist as he later was, as could be seen from his ""Sleeping Beauty with Ballet De L'opera De Paris"".",5,5 Stars Nonetheless,1052524800,"05 10, 2003",2003,2224,"['4', 'Stars', 'Well', 'when', 'Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'danced', 'single', 'motion', 'gesture', 'hers', 'was', 'poem', 'utmost', 'beauty', 'was', 'embodiment', 'supreme', 'elegance', 'view', 'duration', 'part', 'here', 'alone', '7', 'stars', 'Nureyev', 'also', '6', 'stars', 'dancer', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'Kirov', 'other', 'place', 'who', 'could', 'seriously', 'challenge', 'rest', 'especially', 'today', 'standard', 'are', '5', 'star', 'ballerinas', 'are', 'masses', 'here.For', 'most', 'ballet', 'music', 'composers', 'tailor', 'made', 'music', 'requirements', 'choreography', 'Tsaichovsky', 'was', 'exception', 'musical', 'imagination', 'was', 'given', 'free', 'hand', 'original', 'choreographist', 'accommodated', 'changed', 'part', 'accordance', 'music', 'partly', 'why', 'Tsaichovsky', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'music', 'outshinging', 'other', 'ballet', 'music', 'Anyway', 'music', 'choreography', 'ballet', 'should', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'glove', 'befitting', 'hand', 'Here', 'main', 'drawback', 'DVD', 'choreography', ""n't"", 'tie', 'well', 'music', 'was', 'often', 'odd', 'Nureyev', 'however', 'great', 'dancer', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'ears', 'music', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'conductor', 'accompanying', 'orchestra', 'preferred', 'treatment', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'so', 'line.Nureyev', 'introduced', 'new', 'novel', 'elements', 'choreography', 'notably', 'use', 'properties', 'say', 'roses', 'bow', 'arrow', 'large', 'clothes', 'representing', 'waves', 'stage', 'last', 'engulfed', 'prince', 'also', 'mobilized', 'masses', 'ballerinas', 'create', 'various', 'shapes', 'making', 'as', 'scented', 'flowers', 'Even', 'when', 'are', 'only', 'simple', 'geometric', 'matrixes', 'are', 'equally', 'spectacular', 'especially', 'when', 'seen', 'height.The', 'stage', 'settings', 'are', 'great', 'costumes', 'too', 'are', 'numerous', 'course', 'viewers', 'must', 'bear', 'mind', 'however', 'brilliant', 'photography', 'was', 'was', 'filmed', '1968', 'Furthermore', 'are', 'times', 'makeshifts', 'however', 'brief', 'may', 'be', 'are', 'quite', 'prosaic', 'even', 'static', 'Nureyev', 'was', 'then', 'not', 'matured', 'choreographist', 'later', 'was', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'Ballet', 'De', ""L'opera"", 'De', 'Paris']",Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake

429058,A3TIL1PC2ZE97B,6304584598,J. M WILINSKY,"[19, 20]","Nureyev had a wonderfully keen practical and artistic sense of how to produce the classical ballets.  Among other things, he realized the merits of enlarging the role of the male dancer, as did Balanchine, his quote to the contrary notwithstanding!(Male dancers who danced for him that I have trained with, tell me that when he said ballet is all about women, he was mostly referring to the concept of partnering, where the woman is prominently displayed;  he enjoyed working with male dancers very much, as we can see in his choreography.)  In this version, both principal dancers are given a great deal of choreography and, as one would expect from one of the world's most famous ballet duos, they dance magnificently!  Margot Fonteyn was always the quintessential ballerina, both on stage and off.  She was also a great balletic actress and did not like to be disturbed backstage during a ballet because she would stay in character.  She always peformed at her best, right up to the end of her very long career.Some people have been surprised at the closeup of Nureyev in this at the begining of the first act; it shows the starkness of his makeup.  Actually, this type of makeup is often used for this role, but we usually don't see it in closeup!  It looks good at a distance.  It is all part of the fantasy aspect of Swan Lake.Especially noteworthy is the adagio Nureyev dances at the end of act one.  Many dancers have bought this version just to see and study this!  It is one of the greatest moments in classical ballet!Nureyev's handling of the corps de ballet is also fantastic.  I loved the geometric patterns he sets for them.  The corps also dances with great precision and passion.The only subdued aspect of this version is that of the Rothbart character.  He is reduced to just a character role here.  Nureyev liked to have important character, non-dancing , roles in his ballets for balance, no doubt.This recent transfer by DG is marvelous, both visually and acoustically.

Maybe someone else that knows could comment, but my  guess is that the master for this was a video, since there are dust marks  on the credits screens but not seen anywhere in the performance.  To the  credit of those making the recording, it also appears that a special stage  performance was made for the benefit of the recording, since it was  appropriately lit for cameras and shot from multiple cameras with competent  choices of camera angles, close-ups, pans and wide shots.Although I  share his enthusiasm for this performance, I have to disagree with Mr.  Crotty's overstatement that this release ""exploits all the advanced  technology of DVD.  The September 1999 viewer from Texas is completely  accurate in his comments about the visual and audio flaws.  The next  version should address these flaws and do a restoration to remove the  videotape scan line artefacts.  It should have full DTS stereo digitally  remastered from an original professional audio tape and not the videotape's  audio track.  The quality would then be up to the minimum level that  customers expect from DVDs.Even considering basic DVD capabilities,  there is little to complement since almost none are used other than chapter  indexing of all scenes.  This is decent, with 39 points in the ballet that  can be selected. But unlike Kultur's other excellent Nureyev DVD of Romeo  and Juliet, there are no annotations of any kind- no biographies or story  synopsis except that which is embedded in the film itself rather than on a  DVD screen or subtitle.  At bare minimum, the synopsis for each act should  be translated into the major European languages as well as (judging from  Amazon's statement of its popularity in Taiwan) non European languages such  as Chinese.  Besides the bare bones features in Romeo and Juliet, a ballet  commentary as a separate audio track would be especially welcome.  These  sorts of things are common on great films by Hitchcock or Bergman and could  be done cheaply.  Either of these features would enrich the experience of  audiences who are interested in gathering a fuller appreciation of this art  form, and would pay the producers back since it would extend their market  into larger audiences.Additional Credits (copied from back of box):  Ballet members of the Wiener Staatsopernballett, Music performed by Wiener  Symphoniker conducted by John Lanchbery.

It is wonderful to have a copy of this DVD in my collection - it is a little grainey due to the age of the performance no doubt, but the dancing is sublime.  Fonteyn is wonderful as Odette/Odile, such grace is rarely seen and Nureyev is in his prime - Nureyev always danced with passion and the pair always danced as if they were meant for each other.  There may well be better productions, but there are none to compare to Nureyev and Fonteyn as partners.  I actually preferred the ending of the Anthony Dowell Covent Garden performance - but Anthony Dowell was wooden and no Nureyev.  For the sake of seeing these dancers together in a classically danced ballet - I would highly recommend this.  It is also a joy to see Fonteyn again and not the anorexic dancers we tend to see today.",4,Absolutely Gorgeous,1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,929,"['Having', 'seen', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'perfomed', 'many', 'times', 'having', 'seen', 'Fonteyn', 'Nureyev', 'perform', 'ballet', 'live', 'many', 'moons', 'am', 'little', 'biased', 'wonderful', 'have', 'copy', 'DVD', 'collection', 'little', 'grainey', 'due', 'age', 'performance', 'doubt', 'dancing', 'sublime', 'Fonteyn', 'wonderful', 'Odette/Odile', 'such', 'grace', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Nureyev', 'prime', 'Nureyev', 'always', 'danced', 'passion', 'pair', 'always', 'danced', 'were', 'meant', 'other', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'better', 'productions', 'are', 'none', 'compare', 'Nureyev', 'Fonteyn', 'partners', 'actually', 'preferred', 'ending', 'Anthony', 'Dowell', 'Covent', 'Garden', 'performance', 'Anthony', 'Dowell', 'was', 'wooden', 'Nureyev', 'sake', 'seeing', 'dancers', 'together', 'classically', 'danced', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'also', 'joy', 'see', 'Fonteyn', 'again', 'not', 'anorexic', 'dancers', 'tend', 'see', 'today']",Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake
429063,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,6304584598,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[10, 15]","Back in the 60's, the balletic duo that were Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn were all the rage in the ballet business. They danced with passionate chemistry and artistic integrity, committing themselves to their performance so harmoniously that they seemed to exist only within the time/setting of the ballet's fantasy world itself. Swan Lake, Tchaikovsky's first ballet, was initally a dismal failure in St. Petersburg. But he cleaned it up, revised the score and continued to stage it and it became a much loved ballet. For a prima ballerina like Margot Fonteyn, the dual role of Odette/Odile is a star vehicle and dancer's ticket to fame. She becomes the character. Her dancing is virtuosic, and yes, as one critic pointed out, her body type is apparently a bit bigger than the very frail, bony ballerinas of today - Allesandra Ferri is sickly thin sometimes. Fonteyn is still talked about as a major star and all ballet connoisseurs an fans revere here work. Likewise, Nureyev was a great figure in the ballet world, a man who would influence the later star Mikhail Borishnnokoff. Nureyeve got into his characters with dramatic flair and dancing bravura. As Prince Siegfried, he is totally convincing. Fonteyn and Nureyev'spas de deuxs are miraculous to watch. The look of the film is dated and grainy but that's due to its age- this is a 60's performance. But it still looks good and the sets and costumes are gorgeous and just what I imagine when I dream of Swan Lake.",5,Two Masters In A Masterpiece,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,1476,"['Back', '60', 'balletic', 'duo', 'were', 'Rudolf', 'Nureyev', 'Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'were', 'rage', 'ballet', 'business', 'danced', 'passionate', 'chemistry', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'committing', 'performance', 'so', 'harmoniously', 'seemed', 'exist', 'only', 'time/setting', 'ballet', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'Tchaikovsky', 'first', 'ballet', 'was', 'initally', 'dismal', 'failure', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'cleaned', 'up', 'revised', 'score', 'continued', 'stage', 'became', 'much', 'loved', 'ballet', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'dual', 'role', 'Odette/Odile', 'star', 'vehicle', 'dancer', 'ticket', 'fame', 'character', 'dancing', 'virtuosic', 'yes', 'one', 'critic', 'pointed', 'out', 'body', 'type', 'apparently', 'bit', 'bigger', 'very', 'frail', 'bony', 'ballerinas', 'today', 'Allesandra', 'Ferri', 'sickly', 'thin', 'sometimes', 'Fonteyn', 'still', 'talked', 'major', 'star', 'ballet', 'fans', 'revere', 'here', 'work', 'Likewise', 'Nureyev', 'was', 'great', 'figure', 'ballet', 'world', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'influence', 'later', 'star', 'Mikhail', 'Borishnnokoff', 'Nureyeve', 'got', 'characters', 'dramatic', 'flair', 'dancing', 'bravura', 'Prince', 'Siegfried', 'totally', 'convincing', 'Fonteyn', ""Nureyev'spas"", 'deuxs', 'are', 'miraculous', 'watch', 'look', 'film', 'dated', 'grainy', 'due', 'age-', '60', 'performance', 'still', 'good', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'just', 'what', 'imagine', 'when', 'dream', 'Swan', 'Lake']",Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake
429064,AWY56V0LIB3P,6304584598,Stephen McLeod,"[50, 51]","This filmed performance was styled by Nureyev, who choreographed and danced this performance - retaining and only mildly revising the traditional ""white acts"" choreography. Nureyev's aim was to give a lot more dancing and character to Prince Siegfried. Apart from his over-the-top makeup, Nureyev's realization of the Prince was, in addition to being the perfection of perfection, profoundly moving - the Prince can act!But there's more. Margot Fonteyn was one of the greatest ballerinas ever. In 1961, when Nureyev famously leapt to the West, a partnership began that many have described as miraculous. Fonteyn's age was fairly transparent here. Certainly the technique maintained a high level of purity and style. Even though the roll was trimmed to accomadate the way of all flesh (Fonteyn was 47 when this was filmed!) and she probably was even more breathtaking at her peak, this performance will not dissapoint anyone but a moron.Sadly, the corps here is weak and the orchestra disappointing. This is why it lost a star from me. Because the corps is so vital to this ballet, and Tchaikovsky's music so fine, you'll probably want another Swan Lake if you can only have one.  But if you're a seeker for heart-melting beauty, you'll have to get it if only for Nureyev.",4,Great Nureyev Vehicle,1027555200,"07 25, 2002",2002,1271,"['filmed', 'performance', 'was', 'styled', 'Nureyev', 'who', 'choreographed', 'danced', 'performance', 'retaining', 'only', 'mildly', 'revising', 'traditional', 'white', 'acts', 'choreography', 'Nureyev', 'aim', 'was', 'give', 'lot', 'more', 'dancing', 'character', 'Prince', 'Siegfried', 'Apart', 'over-the-top', 'makeup', 'Nureyev', 'realization', 'Prince', 'was', 'addition', 'being', 'perfection', 'perfection', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'Prince', 'can', 'act', 'more', 'Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'ballerinas', 'ever', '1961', 'when', 'Nureyev', 'famously', 'West', 'partnership', 'began', 'many', 'have', 'described', 'miraculous', 'Fonteyn', 'age', 'was', 'fairly', 'transparent', 'here', 'Certainly', 'technique', 'maintained', 'high', 'level', 'purity', 'style', 'Even', 'roll', 'was', 'trimmed', 'accomadate', 'way', 'flesh', 'Fonteyn', 'was', '47', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'probably', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'breathtaking', 'peak', 'performance', 'will', 'not', 'dissapoint', 'anyone', 'moron.Sadly', 'corps', 'here', 'weak', 'orchestra', 'disappointing', 'why', 'lost', 'star', 'corps', 'so', 'vital', 'ballet', 'Tchaikovsky', 'music', 'so', 'fine', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'can', 'only', 'have', 'one', ""'re"", 'seeker', 'heart-melting', 'beauty', ""'ll"", 'have', 'get', 'only', 'Nureyev']",Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake
