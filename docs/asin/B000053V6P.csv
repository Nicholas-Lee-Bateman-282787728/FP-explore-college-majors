This workout both builds muscle strength and develops balance. While perhaps a challenge for a beginner, this video will bring you to the next level in core strength and stability. What I like about ""Strength & Grace"" is the incorporation of key yoga poses like warrior, tree and downward dog. Even though I do work out regularly, there are some moves that are balance challenging; like the ""T"" Pose. The ab section is also very good; using moves like boat pose. This is a wonderful overall workout and the music fits perfectly.

565091,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000053V6P,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[3, 4]","This workout blends classic non-weights toning moves (mostly for the lower body) with yoga poses and Pilates-type abs section.  Yes, the participants wear shoes throughout the workout, which is certainly not traditional to either yoga or Pilates, but as the instructor Minna states at the beginning, the workout is supposed to be ""a blend of east and west.""  I found the workout to be fun and different.  Although I also have more traditional yoga tapes which I enjoy as well, this was a nice change of pace.The tape begins with a lengthy (about 6 minutes) warm-up which includes some simple toning moves (eg, squats) combined with yoga stretches (eg, tree pose).  The workout itself continues this pattern of doing classic toning moves with yoga stretches inbetween.  For example, the first segment consists of squats and lunges followed by proud warrior; following this is a series of pli?s combined with tree pose.  The toughest segment comes next:  it consists of holding plank pose for an extended period, moving into downward dog, and doing a few yoga-style pushups (the only really upper body work in the entire workout).  The Pilates-based section is fairly intense, and because Minna doesn't provide much instruction, I would advise those with no prior knowledge of Pilates to skip this part.  Finally, Minna ends with a series of classic yoga stretches and twists.I was surprised to see that other reviewers had described this workout as fairly difficult; I consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser (advanced beginner in yoga), and I was able to do virtually the entire tape, with the exception of some of the abs moves.  The plank section is tough, but if you keep your knees on the floor as in the modification, it's very doable for beginners.  Minna is a pleasant instructor; she's motivating without being pushy.  She and her three fellow exercisers really seem to enjoy the workout.  Overall, I think this is a fun, different toning workout with a lower body emphasis that's appropriate for advanced beginners/intermediates, and as long as you are not expecting more traditional yoga and Pilates, you won't be disappointed by this tape.",5,A FUN workout!,1032307200,"09 18, 2002",2002,2158,"['workout', 'classic', 'non-weights', 'toning', 'moves', 'mostly', 'lower', 'body', 'yoga', 'poses', 'Pilates-type', 'abs', 'section', 'Yes', 'participants', 'wear', 'shoes', 'workout', 'certainly', 'not', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'instructor', 'Minna', 'beginning', 'workout', 'supposed', 'be', 'blend', 'east', 'west', 'found', 'workout', 'be', 'fun', 'different', 'also', 'have', 'more', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'pace.The', 'tape', 'lengthy', '6', 'minutes', 'warm-up', 'simple', 'toning', 'moves', 'eg', 'squats', 'combined', 'yoga', 'stretches', 'eg', 'tree', 'pose', 'workout', 'pattern', 'doing', 'classic', 'toning', 'moves', 'yoga', 'stretches', 'inbetween', 'example', 'first', 'segment', 'squats', 'lunges', 'followed', 'proud', 'warrior', 'following', 'series', 'pli', 's', 'combined', 'tree', 'pose', 'toughest', 'segment', 'next', 'holding', 'plank', 'pose', 'extended', 'period', 'moving', 'downward', 'dog', 'doing', 'few', 'yoga-style', 'pushups', 'only', 'really', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'entire', 'workout', 'Pilates-based', 'section', 'fairly', 'intense', 'Minna', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'instruction', 'would', 'advise', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'Pilates', 'skip', 'part', 'Finally', 'Minna', 'series', 'classic', 'yoga', 'stretches', 'twists.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'other', 'reviewers', 'had', 'described', 'workout', 'fairly', 'difficult', 'consider', 'be', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'yoga', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'virtually', 'entire', 'tape', 'exception', 'abs', 'moves', 'plank', 'section', 'tough', 'keep', 'knees', 'floor', 'modification', 'very', 'doable', 'beginners', 'Minna', 'pleasant', 'instructor', 'motivating', 'being', 'pushy', 'three', 'fellow', 'exercisers', 'really', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'Overall', 'think', 'fun', 'different', 'toning', 'workout', 'lower', 'body', 'emphasis', 'appropriate', 'advanced', 'beginners/intermediates', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'not', 'expecting', 'more', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'tape']",N/A

However, it is a great video to monitor your progress. It took me four months before I could get through the video 98%. Sometimes the pushup are still to much. I was able to see the growth and strength in my muscles. It is an intense workout. You have to stick with it to see results but you will see results.
