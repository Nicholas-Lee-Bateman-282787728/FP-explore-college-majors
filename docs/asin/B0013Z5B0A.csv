They play a brother and sister who shoulder the burden and responsibility of caring for their aged, and once abusive, father in his final weeks.We're not exactly told how the father treated them when they were young -- it's hinted at rather than made explicit. The father, now demented, still shows flashes of his old temper from time to time but is now just a shadow of his former self, both physically and mentally. When the woman he has been living with for the past 20 years suddenly dies, it falls to the borther and sister to care for him. They move him from Arizona into a nursing home in Buffalo, New York where the son lives.The movie provides some interesting contrasts between the cookie-cutter sub-division in Sun City Arizona, full of old people whizzing around on golf carts, and gritty, snowy, miserable New York -- which still feels much more authentic.The nursing home is spartan and the movie is blunt in painting the misery of this kind of old-age and death.Both lead characters are flawed, both failures in their personal lives and in their professions -- but they stick together even if they don't like each other much. That's the human heart of this movie -- people doing their best, shouldering their responsibilities despite their many flaws.My one criticism -- the happy ending tacked on feels false. One feels the characters in real life would have struggled on in much the same way as before. In the movie, the death of their father provides a cathartic event that enables both to set their lives on a better course.Still, this one is worth a look.",4,Well-acted and very human,1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,1662,"['Fine', 'performances', 'Linney', 'Seymour-Hoffman', 'are', 'main', 'attraction', 'movie', 'play', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'shoulder', 'burden', 'responsibility', 'caring', 'aged', 'once', 'abusive', 'father', 'final', 'weeks.We', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'told', 'how', 'father', 'treated', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'hinted', 'rather', 'made', 'explicit', 'father', 'now', 'demented', 'still', 'flashes', 'old', 'temper', 'time', 'time', 'now', 'just', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'physically', 'mentally', 'When', 'woman', 'been', 'living', 'past', '20', 'years', 'suddenly', 'borther', 'sister', 'care', 'move', 'Arizona', 'nursing', 'home', 'Buffalo', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'son', 'lives.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'contrasts', 'cookie-cutter', 'sub-division', 'Sun', 'City', 'Arizona', 'full', 'old', 'people', 'whizzing', 'around', 'golf', 'carts', 'gritty', 'snowy', 'miserable', 'New', 'York', 'still', 'much', 'more', 'authentic.The', 'nursing', 'home', 'spartan', 'movie', 'blunt', 'painting', 'misery', 'kind', 'old-age', 'death.Both', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'failures', 'personal', 'lives', 'professions', 'stick', 'together', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'much', 'human', 'heart', 'movie', 'people', 'doing', 'best', 'shouldering', 'responsibilities', 'many', 'flaws.My', 'one', 'criticism', 'happy', 'ending', 'tacked', 'feels', 'false', 'One', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'struggled', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'before', 'movie', 'death', 'father', 'cathartic', 'event', 'set', 'lives', 'better', 'course.Still', 'one', 'look']",N/A

Laura Linney is also choice as Jon's sister, Wendy Savage. It's no accident that she plays the female lead in another memorable movie of melancholy, ""The Squid and the Whale (Special Edition),"" and with this film I can finally forgive her for her excruciatingly awful Boston accent in ""Mystic River (Widescreen Edition).""As a man who has put his grandmother in a retirement home, I can testify that Hoffman's and Linney's portrayal of this awkward part of life is all too true. Luckily, the stellar script allows us some tentative laughs at the absurdities, like when Jon Savage is put in a sling attached to the ceiling and when his father does unspeakable things with feces. What is remarkable is it does this while keeping a dirty sense of realism firmly in place.This movie is great study of human misery and discomfort, but its crowning achievement is that it's not hopeless.

1144607,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0013Z5B0A,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 6]","Let's talk for a minute about the perfect actors for the perfect script.  As I watched `The Savages' last night I couldn't help but think that these actors couldn't be better suited for this film.  Both Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman have this incredibly natural dry wit about them that plays so well with the tightly woven dramedy Tamara Jenkins penned.  Every line felt real and connects with the audience as it connects with the actors.  There is nothing fake about this movie, for the actors understand their characters.But this film is so much more than just a mere actor's showcase.  No, `The Savages' moved me more than many other films this past year.  In all honesty it is truly one of the best films I've seen to tackle the parent/child/sibling relationships in quite some time.Wendy and Jon Savage are a unique brand of adult, thanks in large part to their unnatural (or all too natural) upbringing.  Their father was abusive and their mother right out abandoned them and so they find themselves middle-aged and dysfunctional.  Jon is a college professor who can't seem to get his personal as well as his secular life in order, and Wendy is an aspiring playwright who filters through temp services and steals from the government as a way to make ends meat.  When their father Lenny finds himself homeless, Wendy and Jon are then forced to find him ample living arrangements.  This in turn forces Wendy and Jon to both come face to face with their own deficiencies that resulted from the man they are now attempting to care for.  They are guilty, they are bitter, they are defensive, they are confused; and through it all they become stronger people.The performances by the three leads truly elevate this film, because without their believable conviction the weight of the film could have easily been lost.  Laura Linney delivers what may very well be her finest performance to date.  As Wendy she is beautifully uncontrolled.  She is immature and selfish and manipulative but in an innocent and sympathetic way.  She creates a character that we can condone despite her unlikable traits.  As Jon, Hoffman embodies this repressed and lonely man beautifully, giving the audience a glimpse into his soul.  It is true that Linney carries this film (Hoffman's performance in `Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' is superior to his performance here) but Hoffman plays off of her brilliantly, and delivers some humanity to his comedy.  Philip Bosco does a fine job never falling into obscurity.  He never lets you forget that this film is essentially about him and his impact on his children.  There is a scene in particular where Lenny sits in the car listening to Wendy and Jon argue about him and you can see in his eyes the guilt, as if he's asking himself ""did I do this?"".  And then, in another scene where he turns his hearing aid down in order to kill his children's bickering you can see his misery, as if he finally understands what he put his children through now that the tables have turned.That is really the heart of this story; for it is a story about children and parents reversing roles.  This idea is conveyed beautifully as the two children struggle with their treatment of a man who never cared enough about them to try.  They want to be better children than he was a parent, but bitterness and guilt can manipulate your judgment.In the end, `The Savages' is a remarkable character study that I think is important for everyone to see, parents and children and siblings, for it gives us all something to contemplate as regards to our dealings with one another.  Laura Linney's surprise Oscar nomination is no longer a surprise now that I have seen her remarkable work here.  I've always been a fan of her ability to relay humanity within her performances, soaking up every ounce of her naturalness within the film, and this is probably Linney at her most natural.",5,Every aspect of this film fits like a glove...,1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,3894,"['Let', 'talk', 'minute', 'perfect', 'actors', 'perfect', 'script', 'watched', 'Savages', 'last', 'night', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'suited', 'film', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'have', 'incredibly', 'natural', 'dry', 'wit', 'so', 'well', 'tightly', 'woven', 'dramedy', 'Tamara', 'Jenkins', 'penned', 'line', 'felt', 'real', 'connects', 'audience', 'actors', 'nothing', 'fake', 'movie', 'actors', 'understand', 'characters.But', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'mere', 'actor', 'showcase', 'No', 'Savages', 'moved', 'more', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'past', 'year', 'honesty', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tackle', 'parent/child/sibling', 'relationships', 'quite', 'time.Wendy', 'Jon', 'Savage', 'are', 'unique', 'brand', 'adult', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'unnatural', 'too', 'natural', 'upbringing', 'father', 'was', 'abusive', 'mother', 'right', 'out', 'abandoned', 'so', 'find', 'middle-aged', 'dysfunctional', 'Jon', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'personal', 'as', 'well', 'secular', 'life', 'order', 'Wendy', 'aspiring', 'playwright', 'who', 'temp', 'services', 'steals', 'government', 'way', 'make', 'ends', 'meat', 'When', 'father', 'Lenny', 'homeless', 'Wendy', 'Jon', 'are', 'then', 'forced', 'find', 'ample', 'living', 'arrangements', 'turn', 'forces', 'Wendy', 'Jon', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'own', 'deficiencies', 'resulted', 'man', 'are', 'now', 'attempting', 'care', 'are', 'guilty', 'are', 'bitter', 'are', 'defensive', 'are', 'confused', 'become', 'stronger', 'people.The', 'performances', 'three', 'leads', 'truly', 'elevate', 'film', 'believable', 'conviction', 'weight', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'lost', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'what', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'finest', 'performance', 'date', 'Wendy', 'beautifully', 'uncontrolled', 'immature', 'selfish', 'manipulative', 'innocent', 'sympathetic', 'way', 'character', 'can', 'condone', 'unlikable', 'traits', 'Jon', 'Hoffman', 'repressed', 'lonely', 'man', 'beautifully', 'giving', 'audience', 'glimpse', 'soul', 'true', 'Linney', 'film', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'Devil', 'Knows', ""'re"", 'Dead', 'superior', 'performance', 'here', 'Hoffman', 'brilliantly', 'humanity', 'comedy', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'fine', 'job', 'never', 'falling', 'obscurity', 'never', 'forget', 'film', 'essentially', 'impact', 'children', 'scene', 'particular', 'where', 'Lenny', 'car', 'listening', 'Wendy', 'Jon', 'argue', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'guilt', 'asking', 'did', 'do', 'then', 'scene', 'where', 'hearing', 'aid', 'down', 'order', 'kill', 'children', 'bickering', 'can', 'see', 'misery', 'finally', 'what', 'put', 'children', 'now', 'tables', 'have', 'turned.That', 'really', 'heart', 'story', 'story', 'children', 'parents', 'reversing', 'roles', 'idea', 'conveyed', 'beautifully', 'two', 'children', 'struggle', 'treatment', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'cared', 'enough', 'try', 'want', 'be', 'better', 'children', 'was', 'parent', 'bitterness', 'guilt', 'can', 'manipulate', 'judgment.In', 'end', 'Savages', 'remarkable', 'character', 'study', 'think', 'important', 'everyone', 'see', 'parents', 'children', 'siblings', 'something', 'contemplate', 'regards', 'dealings', 'one', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'surprise', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'no', 'longer', 'surprise', 'now', 'have', 'seen', 'remarkable', 'work', 'here', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'ability', 'relay', 'humanity', 'performances', 'soaking', 'up', 'ounce', 'naturalness', 'film', 'probably', 'Linney', 'most', 'natural']",N/A

1144623,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B0013Z5B0A,Danielle Turchiano,"[4, 4]","The entire Savage family in Writer/Director Tamara Jenkins' first film in three years suffers from delusions of their own mind.  The patriarch, Lenny (Philip Bosco), is deteriorating in mental health due to his age and lack of environmentally challenging stimuli, but the ""kids,"" Wendy and Jon (Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman) have no such excuse.  Rather their imaginations contort the facts and history of their family (Wendy is working on a ""semi-autobiographical"" tale about a brother and sister who are ""forced to fend for themselves"" at the hand of an abusive father after their ""mother goes out on a date only to never return"") and keep them from maturing (Jon breaks up with his long time girlfriend when her visa expires, sending her back to Poland).  Though Jon points out that they ""are not in therapy right now; this is real life,"" the central theme in The Savages appears to be that all the therapy in the world can't heal those who just aren't ready to accept it. Though Wendy seems to have taken on the brunt of it (with her pill-popping and extramarital affair), everyone in The Savages is so stuck on the mistakes of the past that they are unable to forgive, let alone try to move forward with their lives.  Though The Savages depicts one very specific family's journey, at its core is a state of mind that is much more common than perhaps admitted and therefore universal.When Lenny's girlfriend passes away, he is left without companionship and homecare, so both siblings travel to Sun City, Arizona for the funeral and to see to longer-term placement of the man whom they both moved to the opposite coast to escape.  Arriving at their father's hospital bed, they are reduced once again to small children in his presence, even though he is strapped into bed and tied up with catheters and IV drips.  The Savages is a coming-of-age tale if there ever was one, but its protagonists are already middle-aged.  Slowly, perhaps even reluctantly, Wendy learns the importance of caring for someone else, and in turn, takes a cold, hard look at how sad her life has become.  Her neuroses translate into an obsession to do the best she can for her father, in almost a nurturing, spousal way. Jon, on the other hand, just gives into his father's worsening condition, and rather than try to control it, he accepts it.  In their own way, they each change subtly, but surely, in the short timeframe the film spans.  At times they seem to take one small step forward and two giant leaps back, but it's a gradual process; they cannot magically be fixed overnight.  As Jon said: ""This is not [a movie]; this is real life.""  It takes the need to care for the man who never did for them for these two perpetual adolescents to finally begin to grow up.The weight of film relies on Linney and Hoffman's shoulders, and in less capable actors' hands, the characters would come off as insane drones, but because both are so known for (and so good at) playing ""everymen,"" they add a level of credibility and believability... even upon revealing yet another fantastical layer of personality (such as Wendy's admission that the grant she received was not for her play but actually from FEMA because of 9/11).  Jenkins directs her actors to be natural and emote their feelings with slight rolls of their eyes or slouching shoulders, and The Savages, as a film about an average family, is only stronger for that.The Savages on DVD offers two brief extended scenes, one which is the opening dance routine, and one which features the motel lounge singers.  Both are superfluous, however, as the real attraction is the EPK-esque ""Making of"" featurette entitled ""Meet The Savages.""  In it, interviews with the cast and Jenkins share their inspiration during both the development and pre-production periods.  Jenkins points out in this ""extra"" that she opts for ""slice of life"" characters and moments and prefers observational humor rather than more traditional on-screen humor.  It is an unnecessary admission after actually viewing The Savages, which blurs the line between comedy and tragedy, but it is still a refreshing approach to filmmaking nonetheless.Jenkins also shares a few personal photos in a bonus behind-the-scenes gallery, and of course the disc offers trailers from other upcoming Fox releases.  The Savages' theatrical run was short-lived--a blink-and-you-missed-it-- and didn't have the opportunity to reach the masses who would have undoubtedly identified with the story had they known it was there.  Thankfully, though, like the Savages, the film itself has been given a second chance at life with its DVD release.",4,A Slice Of Life...

In a bit of inspired casting, Jenkins has paired Hoffman up with one of the finest character actresses around, Laura Linney. Hoffman and Linney are Jon and Wendy Savage, middle-aged siblings who find themselves saddled with the responsibility of caring for their estranged father, who has been diagnosed with dementia. When his ""girlfriend"" of twenty years dies, the elder Savage, Lenny (beautifully played by veteran stage actor Philip Bosco) is kicked to the curb by her adult children, who now legally own the house that the couple shared.Neither Savage sibling is well-equipped to take care of this sudden and unwelcome burden. Each is suffering through their own mid-life crisis, and lead somewhat self-absorbed lives. Wendy is an aspiring playwright, supporting herself by working temp jobs as the writer's grant rejection letters pile up. She lives alone in a modest NYC apartment (with the requisite cat) and gobbles down anti-depressants while slogging her way through a half-hearted affair with a married neighbor. Jon is a drama professor at an upstate college, spending his spare time doing obsessive research for a book on ""the dark comedy"" of Bertolt Brecht (in one particularly wonderful scene, he grooves to Kurt Weill while cruising in his car, high on Percocet). His love life is also in disarray; his live-in girlfriend of several years is heading back to her native Poland because her visa has expired (along with any hopes of a marriage proposal from the commitment-shy Jon).Necessity sparks an uneasy family reunion as Jon and Wendy scramble to find a nursing home for Lenny, whose moments of lucidity are marked by the demeaning verbal abuse that obviously drove the siblings apart from their father in the first place (and explains the self-esteem issues that pervade their adult life). It doesn't take long for long-dormant rivalries and simmering resentments between the brother and sister to re-emerge as well.This is one of those family angst dramas that could have easily turned into a wrist-slitting downer in the Eugene O'Neill/Harold Pinter vein. After all, it does deal with some heavy issues; existential middle age despair and the looming prospect of the inevitable downward spiral of our parents' ""golden years"" does not exactly make for ""feel-good"" fare. However, writer-director Jenkins strikes a nice balance here; while her script doesn't sugar-coat the film's central theme (i.e., we're all gonna die) with maudlin sentimentality, she still provides just the right amount of levity and very real, life-affirming moments to make this an engaging watch. It doesn't hurt to have the monster talents of Hoffman and Linney on board. I know this is a dreaded clich&eacute;, but they made me laugh, and they made me cry.

Moreover, by casting ""middle-aged"" actors like Philip Seymour Hoffman (40) and Laura Linney (44), Jenkins lends her film the realism that many mainstream films lack. Much appreciated!!While billed as a comedy, this slice-of-life work (along the lines of a more claustrophobicThe Station Agent) may prove too dismal for many viewers (I was a little surprised at its darkness ... but much likeLars and the Real Girl, I think that the film-industry STILL has no idea how to categorize a complicated piece). There are no ""Hollywood magical-solutions"" here ... just a brother and sister coping with their dying father. The pair navigate through the rigors of finding appropriate elder-care and all its minutia. For those who are currently enmeshed in this process, this film could prove too real ... but others may find solace (it is a difficult call, so proceed with caution).Now, the references to September 11th seem a bit forced (and, perhaps too firmly position the film at a fixed time). Some may appreciate its relevance, but I found it distracting and awkward. For me, this was the only negative in an overall slow-paced (meaning ""demanding"" but not ""painful""), superbly acted, nicely shot film.A younger audience will struggle to relate to the work, but a more mature audience (30+) will appreciate Jenkins' effort.",4,You Never Really Stop Being a Child ...,1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,1389,"['Tamara', 'Jenkins', 'film', 'addresses', 'adult-issues', 'unflinching', 'honesty', 'Moreover', 'casting', 'middle-aged', 'actors', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', '40', 'Laura', 'Linney', '44', 'Jenkins', 'film', 'realism', 'many', 'mainstream', 'films', 'lack', 'Much', 'appreciated', 'billed', 'comedy', 'slice-of-life', 'work', 'lines', 'more', 'claustrophobicThe', 'Station', 'Agent', 'may', 'prove', 'too', 'dismal', 'many', 'viewers', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'darkness', 'much', 'likeLars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'think', 'film-industry', 'STILL', 'idea', 'how', 'categorize', 'complicated', 'piece', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'magical-solutions', 'here', 'just', 'brother', 'sister', 'coping', 'dying', 'father', 'pair', 'navigate', 'rigors', 'finding', 'appropriate', 'elder-care', 'minutia', 'who', 'are', 'currently', 'enmeshed', 'process', 'film', 'could', 'prove', 'too', 'real', 'others', 'may', 'find', 'solace', 'difficult', 'call', 'so', 'proceed', 'caution', '.Now', 'references', 'September', '11th', 'seem', 'bit', 'forced', 'perhaps', 'too', 'firmly', 'position', 'film', 'fixed', 'time', 'may', 'appreciate', 'relevance', 'found', 'distracting', 'awkward', 'was', 'only', 'negative', 'overall', 'slow-paced', 'meaning', 'demanding', 'not', 'painful', 'superbly', 'acted', 'nicely', 'shot', 'film.A', 'younger', 'audience', 'will', 'struggle', 'relate', 'work', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', '30+', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Jenkins', 'effort']",N/A

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[22, 24]","Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman shine is the seriocomic film, ""The Savages,"" written and directed by Tamara Jenkins. Linney is Wendy Savage, a thirty-nine year old office temp and aspiring playwright.  Hoffman plays forty-two year old Jon Savage, a theater professor in Buffalo who specializes in the works of Berthold Brecht.  Neither Jon nor Wendy is particularly successful, although Jon does have a steady job and is working on a book.  Both have managed to make a mess of their personal lives.  Jon has a Polish girlfriend who is about to return to her country; he loves her but cannot make a permanent commitment.  Wendy settles for quick and humiliating liaisons with a married man, instead of seeking a long-term relationship with someone who is free to give her the love that she craves.The siblings have never been particularly close, but they are reluctantly thrown together when their elderly father, Leonard Savage, is ejected from the Sun City, Arizona retirement home where he sponged off his girlfriend for years.  Leonard is becoming forgetful and agitated, and the two younger Savages must decide what to do for a father who abused and neglected them.  Jon dutifully arranges for Leonard to be placed in a decent enough facility in Buffalo, but Wendy is so upset by her father's decline that she unfairly lashes out at her brother.  As the weeks pass, the two try to put their rancor aside and begin to empathize with one another. They also start to realize that there is a statute of limitations on blaming your parents for everything that is wrong with your life.Tamara Jenkins nicely balances humor and poignancy in a film that is moving but never schmaltzy.  The veteran actors include Philip Bosco, as the angry and confused Leonard Savage, a man who furiously rails against the dying of the light.  Although he barely knows his children, he knows that he doesn't much care for them.  Hoffman embodies the scruffy intellectual who is more expert in German theater than he is in interpersonal relationships.  Linney delivers a beautifully nuanced performance as an insecure woman who is so out of touch with her feelings that, at times, she can barely think straight; her tirades try the patience of her long-suffering brother as well as of the nursing home staff.  The fine supporting cast includes Peter Friedman as Wendy's irritating lover and Gbenga Akinnagbe, a compassionate orderly who does what he can to boost Wendy's self-confidence.  The sole false note comes at the end, which is a bit too neat considering what has gone before.  However, ""The Savages"" is worth seeing for its understated satirical humor, outstanding performances, and unflinching depiction of the horrors of old age.",5,"""We're taking better care of the old man than he ever did of us.""",1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,2726,"['Laura', 'Linney', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'shine', 'seriocomic', 'film', 'Savages', 'written', 'directed', 'Tamara', 'Jenkins', 'Linney', 'Wendy', 'Savage', 'thirty-nine', 'year', 'old', 'office', 'temp', 'aspiring', 'playwright', 'Hoffman', 'forty-two', 'year', 'old', 'Jon', 'Savage', 'theater', 'professor', 'Buffalo', 'who', 'works', 'Berthold', 'Brecht', 'Jon', 'Wendy', 'particularly', 'successful', 'Jon', 'have', 'steady', 'job', 'working', 'book', 'have', 'managed', 'make', 'mess', 'personal', 'lives', 'Jon', 'Polish', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'return', 'country', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'permanent', 'commitment', 'Wendy', 'quick', 'humiliating', 'liaisons', 'married', 'man', 'instead', 'seeking', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'someone', 'who', 'free', 'give', 'love', 'craves.The', 'siblings', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'particularly', 'close', 'are', 'reluctantly', 'thrown', 'together', 'when', 'elderly', 'father', 'Leonard', 'Savage', 'ejected', 'Sun', 'City', 'Arizona', 'retirement', 'home', 'where', 'sponged', 'off', 'girlfriend', 'years', 'Leonard', 'becoming', 'forgetful', 'agitated', 'two', 'younger', 'Savages', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'father', 'who', 'abused', 'neglected', 'Jon', 'dutifully', 'Leonard', 'be', 'placed', 'decent', 'enough', 'facility', 'Buffalo', 'Wendy', 'so', 'upset', 'father', 'decline', 'unfairly', 'out', 'brother', 'weeks', 'pass', 'two', 'try', 'put', 'rancor', 'aside', 'begin', 'empathize', 'one', 'also', 'start', 'realize', 'statute', 'limitations', 'blaming', 'parents', 'everything', 'wrong', 'life.Tamara', 'Jenkins', 'nicely', 'humor', 'poignancy', 'film', 'moving', 'never', 'schmaltzy', 'veteran', 'actors', 'include', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'angry', 'confused', 'Leonard', 'Savage', 'man', 'who', 'furiously', 'dying', 'light', 'barely', 'children', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'Hoffman', 'scruffy', 'intellectual', 'who', 'more', 'expert', 'German', 'theater', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'Linney', 'beautifully', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'insecure', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'touch', 'feelings', 'times', 'can', 'barely', 'think', 'straight', 'tirades', 'try', 'patience', 'long-suffering', 'brother', 'as', 'well', 'nursing', 'home', 'staff', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Peter', 'Friedman', 'Wendy', 'irritating', 'lover', 'Gbenga', 'Akinnagbe', 'compassionate', 'orderly', 'who', 'what', 'can', 'boost', 'Wendy', 'self-confidence', 'sole', 'false', 'note', 'end', 'bit', 'too', 'neat', 'considering', 'what', 'gone', 'before', 'However', 'Savages', 'worth', 'seeing', 'understated', 'satirical', 'humor', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'unflinching', 'depiction', 'horrors', 'old', 'age']",N/A
1144631,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0013Z5B0A,Ed Uyeshima,"[10, 11]","It's been nearly a decade since her first film, 1998's idiosyncraticSlums of Beverly Hills, but writer/director Tamara Jenkins' 2007 drama really hits the nail on the head this time with this trenchant look at the inevitable indignities of aging for not only a father slipping into dementia but his two emotionally stunted children, both hovering around forty and dealing with their own personal issues which are preventing them from moving forward with their lives. I saw the preview for this movie several months ago and expected a black comedy with a deadpan toward death and euthanasia. While there are some laughs, it is really the pervasive and empathetic sadness of the situation that draws you into a very human-size story of three flawed people.The character-driven story begins in the famous Del Webb retirement community of Sun City, Arizona, where Lenny Savage has been living with his now-severely ailing girlfriend Doris for twenty years. When Doris passes away, Lenny's two children are contacted since he is being evicted and no longer able to live on his own. His son Jon is a professor of theater in Buffalo working on a book about German playwright Bertolt Brecht, while his daughter Wendy is ironically a struggling playwright applying for a multitude of grants while doing demeaning temp work in Manhattan. Although they are both smart with similar artistic aspirations and a common phobia when it comes to long-term commitments, the siblings have become estranged from each other as well as their father. They jointly decide to take Lenny back to Buffalo where Jon has reserved a room in a rather depressing (though typical) nursing home. Naturally, the full extent of their dysfunctional family unit comes to the fore now that they are all within close proximity of one another during a particularly unforgiving winter.What Jenkins does exceptionally well is depict the small moments, both private and shared, as Jon, Wendy and Lenny each come to terms with the inevitable. The dialogue scenes have a realistic, unsentimental edge as long-dormant feelings of resentment percolate into both vitriol and humor. The three leads are note-perfect. As the more insular Jon, Philip Seymour Hoffman accurately captures the simmering states of denial and hostility of a man whose innate brilliance is deliberately camouflaged by his disheveled, disconnected life. Playing Wendy as a self-loathing variation on the emotionally uptight character she played in Kenneth Lonergan's brilliantYou Can Count on Me, Laura Linney proves again what a master she is at sharply balancing a messy bundle of neuroses like a precarious house of cards. Despite their physical dissimilarity, Hoffman and Linney are completely convincing as tension-rattled siblings in a constant state of mutual misunderstanding.In his brief scenes, Broadway veteran Philip Bosco manages to paint the fury and confusion in Lenny with forceful, affecting strokes. On the sidelines, Peter Friedman plays Wendy's married lover with just the right amount of smarmy neediness, while Gbenga Akinnagbe has a couple of nice scenes with Linney as a sympathetic caretaker. There is nice camerawork from W. Mott Hupfel III, who effectively makes the abrupt visual transition from the color of sunny, open-spaced Arizona to the grayness of Buffalo in winter, while the eclectic music selections on the soundtrack dramatically bridge the story well. Film trivialists may recall the opening song, ""I Don't Want to Play in Your Yard"", as the one Diane Keaton sings during one of the more idyllic scenes in Warren Beatty'sReds. This movie will not be everyone's cup of tea, but anyone with aging parents will undoubtedly be affected by it.",5,The Inevitable Indignities of Aging Masterfully Played Out Like an Intimately Orchestrated Sonata,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,3702,"['been', 'nearly', 'decade', 'first', 'film', '1998', 'idiosyncraticSlums', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'writer/director', 'Tamara', 'Jenkins', '2007', 'drama', 'really', 'nail', 'head', 'time', 'trenchant', 'look', 'inevitable', 'indignities', 'aging', 'not', 'only', 'father', 'slipping', 'dementia', 'two', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'children', 'hovering', 'forty', 'dealing', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'are', 'preventing', 'moving', 'forward', 'lives', 'saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'expected', 'black', 'comedy', 'deadpan', 'death', 'euthanasia', 'are', 'laughs', 'really', 'pervasive', 'empathetic', 'sadness', 'situation', 'very', 'human-size', 'story', 'three', 'flawed', 'people.The', 'character-driven', 'story', 'famous', 'Del', 'Webb', 'retirement', 'community', 'Sun', 'City', 'Arizona', 'where', 'Lenny', 'Savage', 'been', 'living', 'now-severely', 'ailing', 'girlfriend', 'Doris', 'twenty', 'years', 'When', 'Doris', 'away', 'Lenny', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'contacted', 'being', 'evicted', 'longer', 'able', 'live', 'own', 'son', 'Jon', 'professor', 'theater', 'Buffalo', 'working', 'book', 'German', 'playwright', 'Bertolt', 'Brecht', 'daughter', 'Wendy', 'ironically', 'struggling', 'playwright', 'applying', 'multitude', 'grants', 'doing', 'demeaning', 'temp', 'work', 'Manhattan', 'are', 'smart', 'similar', 'artistic', 'aspirations', 'common', 'phobia', 'when', 'long-term', 'commitments', 'siblings', 'have', 'become', 'estranged', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'jointly', 'decide', 'take', 'Lenny', 'back', 'Buffalo', 'where', 'Jon', 'reserved', 'room', 'rather', 'depressing', 'typical', 'nursing', 'home', 'Naturally', 'full', 'extent', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'unit', 'fore', 'now', 'are', 'close', 'proximity', 'one', 'particularly', 'unforgiving', 'winter.What', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'depict', 'small', 'moments', 'private', 'shared', 'Jon', 'Wendy', 'Lenny', 'come', 'terms', 'inevitable', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'have', 'realistic', 'unsentimental', 'edge', 'long-dormant', 'feelings', 'resentment', 'percolate', 'vitriol', 'humor', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'note-perfect', 'more', 'insular', 'Jon', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'accurately', 'simmering', 'states', 'denial', 'hostility', 'man', 'innate', 'brilliance', 'deliberately', 'camouflaged', 'disheveled', 'disconnected', 'life', 'Playing', 'Wendy', 'self-loathing', 'variation', 'emotionally', 'uptight', 'character', 'played', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'brilliantYou', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'again', 'what', 'master', 'sharply', 'balancing', 'messy', 'bundle', 'neuroses', 'precarious', 'house', 'cards', 'physical', 'dissimilarity', 'Hoffman', 'Linney', 'are', 'completely', 'convincing', 'tension-rattled', 'siblings', 'constant', 'state', 'mutual', 'misunderstanding.In', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Broadway', 'veteran', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'paint', 'fury', 'confusion', 'Lenny', 'forceful', 'affecting', 'strokes', 'sidelines', 'Peter', 'Friedman', 'Wendy', 'married', 'lover', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'smarmy', 'neediness', 'Gbenga', 'Akinnagbe', 'couple', 'nice', 'scenes', 'Linney', 'sympathetic', 'caretaker', 'nice', 'camerawork', 'W.', 'Mott', 'Hupfel', 'III', 'who', 'effectively', 'abrupt', 'visual', 'transition', 'color', 'sunny', 'open-spaced', 'Arizona', 'grayness', 'Buffalo', 'winter', 'eclectic', 'music', 'selections', 'soundtrack', 'dramatically', 'story', 'well', 'Film', 'trivialists', 'may', 'recall', 'opening', 'song', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Want', 'Play', 'Yard', 'one', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'sings', 'one', 'more', 'idyllic', 'scenes', 'Warren', ""Beatty'sReds"", 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'anyone', 'aging', 'parents', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'affected']",N/A

As soon as the movie started, we realized we were in for a surprise for the plot centers around rather serious issues that many family members confront:1. Death of parents2. Responsibility to elders3. Serious illness4. A demented parent5. Placement of a loved one in the care of others6. The quality of care provided for the elderlyIt is difficult to express the feelings surfaced by The Savages as we witnessed brother and sister trying to care for a father, diagnosed with dementia, who failed to be loving or caring to them. The father is alone because his life partner dies and her children don't want the responsibility of caring or providing shelter for him.From the outset, the movie will shock viewers with the crude reality of mental health issues confronted by the unfortunate individuals who suffer dementia. The acting is superb. Wendy, played by Laura Linney is the lonely play writer sister who has terrible relationships because she does not want the commitment to developing a family of her own. Jon, masterfully played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the brother who also can't commit to a relationship, living in an apartment that is so cluttered that when his sister visits and he offers the couch, which is covered with magazines and school papers, we hear her cynical comment: ""what couch?""The range of emotions displayed brought us to laughter, being upset, understanding the guilt and anger felt by the siblings, empathy and finally we were happy to see the transformation, the catharsis experienced by the family members as they learn much about themselves from the experiences shared.Not an easy movie to watch, but an excellent view as to real human drama.

1144635,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B0013Z5B0A,e. verrillo,"[4, 4]","The dysfunctional family is a theme which has been so overdone in American film that I can't blame you if the prospect of watching yet another screwy family on screen elicits a groan. But The Savages stands a cut above the rest, not just for the performances (which were wonderful), or the writing (which was flawless), but because at long last the reason for the dysfunctionality makes sense. (It's not just the fact that we're junk-food-eating Americans who watch too much TV.)The plot of the movie is deceptively simple. Two siblings, Wendy and Jon Savage, are suddenly faced with the responsibility of caring for their demented father, Lenny. Neither sibling has been what you would call a success in life. Wendy, who works as a temp in New York City, is stuck in a tire-spinning relationship with a married man. Jon, a theater professor in Buffalo who is perpetually on the verge of writing his definitive work on Berthold Brecht, can't seem to keep a relationship going either. And Lenny, apparently, has not done anything approaching a good job as a father. Normally, the interactions of three people who haven't got much going for them wouldn't make a good movie. In this case, however, it worked.The reason it worked is that the interactions were entirely realistic. Wendy's neurotic quest to find some indication that her father has actually cared about his children is entirely plausible. (It is only in movies that daughters dramatically lash back at cold fathers. Mostly they seek approval.) Jon's rejection of Wendy's efforts is equally as plausible, although you don't find out why until the end of the film. As with Wendy, Jon provokes no confrontation with his father. There is no cathartic moment of resolution--just quiet resignation. The fact that nothing is overdramatized is what makes the film so believable.Even if the topic does not appeal to you, The Savages is worth watching just for Philip Seymour Hoffman, who, as always, gives a masterful performance. Hoffman's ability to convey subtle emotions--of every variety--is simply unmatched. Laura Linney, as the pill-popping Wendy, gives a fine performance, as does Philip Bosco as the irascible Lenny. The supporting cast was convincing enough to make you think they weren't actors--just real people.

There's a lot to dislike about dementia, about the procedures of dying in our modern world, about hospice and 'rehabilitation facilities. In the earliest scenes of the film, there's a lot to dislike about retirement communities -- Sun City and its golf cart serendipity -- and a lot to dislike about 'double-wide' white retirees who live in them. The vignettes of Sun City, in the first quarter hour of the film, are like a Wayne Thiebaud painting, but even more depressingly vapid. There's not quite as much to dislike about Wendy's older brother, Jon, but there's not much to admire about him either. The siblings are perfect examples of ""Bruno's Law of the Conservation of Sibling Dysfunctionality"", i.e. that in any sibling relationship bad behavior is a constant but as one sib waxes the other wanes.And one can be forgiven for disliking the experience of a strenuously depressing film for which one has paid one's money in hopes of diversion from Life's unavoidable miseries. One can be forgiven for not relishing ugliness, both physical and behavioral.But there's no excuse for not admiring, not enjoying superb acting. The three principals in this film -- Philip Seymour Hoffman as Jon Savage, Philip Bosco as the dying father, and Laura Linney as the out-of-control sister -- give performances that are 'scary good'. Hoffman has gotten to be too big a 'star' ever to be unrecognizable, but he can still still be completely convincing in a role different from any of his other roles. That's the sign of a real Actor! Linney is the central character of the script, the one who suffers the most traumata, but Bosco deserved a Supporting Role Oscar (he didn't get one) for his uncanny portrayal of senile dementia.In short, this is a well-done painful film, well scripted, well directed, well photographed, well worth suffering through for the craft. However ......and this is a BIG however ...when you grasp that the story is nearly finished,specifically when you see the words ""Six Months Later"" flash on an otherwise black screen, TURN IT OFF! Don't ask me why. Just pull the plug or click the button that opens the DVD drawer. I promise you, it's the right thing to do. Don't let curiosity  overcome my fair warning. The ending is an abomination. It trivializes the totality of misery that came before.

1144637,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0013Z5B0A,Grady Harp,"[47, 53]","How we all come to grips with our mortality is often previewed in how we manage the care of our elders. When that elder care is focused on a parent, as it is in Tamara Jenkins's brilliant film THE SAVAGES, it not only strikes chords with individual philosophies, but is also reveals the intricacies of family relationships that come into play in coping with the final days of a parent's life. Though there is little story to this film, this is a character study about isolation, loneliness, and need that will touch the hearts of sensitive viewers.Wendy Savage (Laura Linney) is a frustrated unpublished playwright working as a temp, a bright woman whose insecurities limit her emotional activity to an affair with a 'safe' married man Larry (Peter Friedman).  Jon Savage (Philip Seymour Hoffman), her older brother, is a professor of philosophy who is writing a book on the theater of the absurd of Bertolt Brecht while living in Buffalo with a Polish woman, Kasia (Cara Seymour), who, because Jon does not wish to commit to marriage, is forcing his only emotional tie to return to Poland when her Visa expires. Wendy and Jon were deserted by their mother at an early age, left in the care of their abusive father Lenny Savage (Philip Bosco), and both siblings have distanced themselves from their father now living in Sun City, Arizona with his girlfriend of twenty years.  Lenny's girlfriend dies and the signs of Lenny's rapidly encroaching dementia  force Wendy and Jon to fly to Arizona to 'make arrangements' for their demented father.  Coming together under duress the two siblings are forced to confront their own frustrations together with  the realities of placing Lenny in a nursing home.  Lenny is moved from Arizona to Buffalo, NY and the manner in which Jon and Wendy cope with the new 'family' arrangement raises problems of guilt, memories of their childhood, resentment, and ultimately the manner in which they continue with their lives.The film could have easily become a diatribe against current nursing home conditions, but instead Jenkins through her superb script and direction levels the playing field, allowing the family frustrations to play out  in equal time with the vantage point of the caregivers (well played by David Zayas, Gbenga Akinnagbe, Margo Martindale, Tonye Patano, Nancy Lenehan, Tijuana Ricks, and others).  But the real power of this film comes from the bravura performances by Linney, Hoffman, and Bosco. These three actors can do more with silences and facial and body expressions that just about anyone on the screens today. Watching these gifted actors at their trade makes for a  stunning film experience and one that shakes us all a bit to think about things we don't wish to consider - death, care of the elderly, and finding life in a world that usually runs a bit on the crazy side. Another quality aspect of this film is the quiet, mood enhancing musical score by Stephen Trask, who manages to combine childlike songs with simple line piano music to underscore the intimate moods of the story.  Highly recommended.

The movie is a fairly realistic look at what happens to siblings when one of their parents has dementia (probably Parkinson's disease). The problem is the movie doesn't really delve deeply into the problems. It covers some of the problems, but not significantly. The overall toil on the family is not covered. The father was never really part of their lives. The movie has some genuine humor and some pathos that come from the situations. The characters grow, but the movie doesn't really explain why.

1144647,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B0013Z5B0A,J. SHARP,"[2, 3]","Billed as a dark comedy, 'The Savages' is certainly not standard movie fare but I think it's a film that we're richer for having around. Many have tackled end-of-life issues before but very few have done it like this. It is an unsentimental, unapologetic, slice-of-life depiction of two middle aged siblings, Linney (in an Oscar-nominated turn) and Hoffman, managing the rapid mental deterioration and death of their estranged, abusive father and the process - physiological and logistical - that entails.It averts its gaze from none of the practical and emotional issues met by everyone whose family members live so long. From scatological problems to the appalling reality of nursing homes to the pressures of guilt, it covers the bases. It does punctuate it with moments of humor and sprinkles knowingly wry observations of sibling dynamics throughout. But there are no saccharine reconciliations or dramatic changes of heart in the last act to pull the punches. Things just happen and the people react as we all do - with integrity and responsibility in some areas and utter cowardice and flakiness in others. And with many things left unsaid.My only real nit to pick is a slight sense of self-indulgence in the characters' professions. Everyone but the father is in the theater (or wants to be). It leads to a bit of inside humor that took me out of the movie a few times. (If you know who Bertolt Brecht is, it could open up another level of Hoffman's character to you. He briefly summarizes Brecht's epic philosophy at one point.) But it's not a huge liability.Linney and Hoffman are, of course, impeccable but I believe Philip Bosco, who plays the largely silent role of the father, deserves praise as well.

1144649,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B0013Z5B0A,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[42, 44]","This would have been a 5 star movie if not for the ending. Even so, I would urge you to see it. They got so much right, even perfect, in MOST parts of this film. I was waiting for the DVD to come out and I ordered it (as of this review, it has not arrived but I've seen this one already)UPDATE: Having now gone through the additional and special features on the DVD, I also wanted to say that they are not just simple ""add  ons"" but help add perspective to this film. The actors speak about the fact the complexities of family relationships and Seymour-Hoffman adds his take (which can also be seen here on Amazon's own snippet from the film for now) that it isn't normal for children to be estranged from a parent. In this case, the children of a very difficult father are alienated from him.The film struck home for me because I'm helping to care for two relatives, both elderly, one in a nursing home. Trust me, I know authenticity when it comes to catching the dynamics of family relationships, dealing with an elderly parent and all the issues that come into play. Even in the best of situations, there are tough days. Aging can go down hard and mental and physical decline, as portrayed so aptly in this film, isn't easy to watch.Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney are also excellent as brother and sister who have their own struggles with facing reality and dealing with an imperfect father. They have their own flawed and difficult lives and then, suddenly, they have total responsibility for their father, who is left without the girlfriend or backup support that the siblings thought was there. Now what?That is the plot, in short. Hoffman manages to be clumsy but engaging, a trait he seems to have made into an art form in many films. In this one, he and his sister (Linney) have both tension and a bond between them. I could feel their pain when they were together and Linney's judgment of her brother's lifestyle...and yet they had to find a way to get through the situation with their father as well, however awkward that might be.Of the two, Linney is the one who tries to be the ""pleaser"" and fix things. She goes through bouts of denial while her brother is less apt to turn away from reality. Yet Linney also seems to have more sympathy at times. Both Seymour-Hoffman and Linney work so well together, seeming perfectly believable as two very opposite sibling, both damaged by a very flawed parent. Now they have to care for that parent.Everything seemed so real to me. I'd been in similar situations, faced with unexpected crisis. I know that ""bumbling through"" is sometimes the best we can do, although there are those of us who step up to the plate with grace, tact and composure at all times. This is a film for the rest of us.Partly, I guess, this movie was about having to grow up, in spite of oneself. I am still struggling to be articulate about it because it pulled at me so strongly that it is hard to be objective - or anything approaching it. I simply loved this movie! It is, however, VERY slow-paced and the drama may not appeal to those who want something less real. It isn't really a feel good, escapist movie. It could even be called depressing by some, although I felt inspired by it, like someone understood the particular difficulty of dealing with an aged parent.Also, Linney and Hoffman aren't schmaltzy. If you want to know if this film is for you, consider it a ""slice of life"" film about two people who have to handle a father's physical and emotional decline, senility and all that. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, by all means avoid it.However, this film made me think about aging - and I had already thought about it plenty (or so I believed). It gave me new perspective on sibling relationships, flawed parents and it also was a very engaging film, in its own niche area.I enjoyed the film immensely, with the exception of the ending - and I have to be honest about that, so there it is. It isn't nearly as dark as my outline of it may make it sound. There are quirky moments and humorous ones.I do agree with the reviewer who noted that people who like films like The Good Girl and Little Children may also like this one. I like those types of films and am constantly intrigued by they psychological oddities of the  human character. This film explores that territory, with a story line involving two siblings and an aging parent. Because so many Baby Boomers are both aging and handling elderly parents, this is a theme that deserves plenty of attention.

And calls into question the hightolerance one must have to deal with people in a decrepitcondition suffering from diseases that can regress oneback into child-like behavior.Two estranged siblings (Laura Linney and Philip-SeymourHoffman) are quickly called upon to help their unpleasantfather whom is diagnosed with dementia. The daughter, Wendy,realizes the gravity of the situation and seeks to fulfillthat motherly instinct by caring for a man who could hardlybe called a father. The son, Jon, is initially reluctant anduncaring of the father's plight, but gives in due to Wendy'spressure and his obligation as a son. Down the road we aregiven glimpses of the father's true colors at the mostinopportune moments, hinting at what a truly horrible manhe was. Mr. Savages old film reel is shown one night at thehome, adding racism to his list of horrible traits.The wounded siblings seek to establish some form of a normallove life, but it is precarious at best, as the daughtersleeps with a married man she has no intellectual or emotionalconnection to. When this man brings attention to the realityof the situation, Wendy quickly severs contact. Subesquently,she becomes infatuated with a Nigerian caretaker, one whoshows her the attention that she desperately craves. In anawkward scene the two sit side-by-side and Wendy unexpectedlyputs a move on the man, and makes the comment ""I'm so gross!""when her advance is rejected (A symptom of her father's racism).Despite her beauty, she does not see herself as beautiful anddoes not feel worthy of true emotional intimacy, but onlyphysical love with no strings attached (A symptom of incestby the father?). The son fairs just as badly, rejecting emotionalcommitment and making far-fetched excuses as to why he cannotbe with a woman that clearly cares about him, or is at leasttrying to. Amusingly, the two become judges of each others tornlives, but fail to be introspective of their own.The actors play these flawed characters superbly with nuanceand realism, exposing those repressed emotions at just theright moments.

1144659,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B0013Z5B0A,Marc Cabir Davis,"[3, 3]","Tamara Jenkins is clearly a wondrous talent - ""The Savages"", which focusses on three family members who share that same last name, is a poignant, sometimes hilarious look at love and relationships between siblings, and most importantly our societys' interaction with aging parents and our responsibility toward them.Despite being a straight-forward narrative, the film excels at certain vignettes that only add to its overall appeal - the scene where Laura Linney is in the airplane with her father and he needs to use the bathroom is especially realistic - I've actually witnessed something like this on an airplane - and the 'breakdown' scene where Linney goes about the hospital searching for the 'big red pillow' she bought her father is a superb high-point of the film as it defines the character so perfectly.Both siblings here are people who want to 'be something in life'. To this end, they both consider themselves scholared academics on the quest for grants and scholarships and publishing deals. While Hoffman plays his role as the brother without a hint of irony, Linney's role seems better written as she is more 'flawed' and more 'real', without being a total turnoff. Her choice of love-partner (an unattractive, rather unintelligent married man in his 50s) is enough for us to draw up a suitable impression of her character. She is shown as slightly off-kilter, and not really high on the concept of morality. Linney also brings that special awkwardness that people with low self-esteem have, and by the end of the movie we are treated to the direction her life takes - and its not quite what we expected. That last scene will have you thinking for hours (no spoilers here - but it involves a dog that's undergone hip surgery).""The Savages"" is definitely not for everyone, even for many of you who might like slow, dialog-driven film. Its also not pretentious or pandering to an 'art-house' audience, which is something I appreciated. Its very real, down to earth, and definitely the kind of motion picture that Hollywood does not make anymore. At its' center is the superb performance by Linney (who by the way scored an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actress in 2007 for this) - and its clearly an honor-worthy performance. Special mention must be made of the actor who plays the father - his expressions vacillate from bored, disinterested & tired to frantic, confused and violent - watching the other actors put in reactive performances to his outbursts are acting lessons in motion.""The Savages"", for all its dreary subject matter, is also a wonderful commentary on how we treat our parents in their old age. I doubt any of us are doing the 'best job we can', as the siblings in this film sadly find out. What is even harder to do is to care for a parent who didn't bother looking after you when you were growing up. To what extent should you bear responsibility? Do we consider our aging parents a burden or a comfort? Do we look after our aged to assuage our own guilt, or because we truly want to care for them? Very rarely do we even bother to ask ourselves these questions, but ""The Savages"" will make you wonder what sort of people we are, and how ageism is treated in our current global climate.What I especially liked about this movie, is that despite its rather short running time (a little under two hours), its very rewatchable - with some great one-liners and situational dialog. Also, watching Laura Linney's facial expressions are enough to convince you that she's one of our contemporary greats.

Sherwin,"[2, 2]","The Savages tells the story of the emotional strife siblings face when their long absent father begins to suffer so much from dementia that he can no longer care for himself. This plot will resonate with just about anyone who has taken care of an elderly relative; and of course professional caregivers may well be able identify with the adult children in this movie, too. The cinematography is very well done and the choreography lacks nothing; but the film progresses at a rate that is much too slow and they could have edited about ten to fifteen minutes out of the picture to make it tighter. On the other hand, however, the acting is consistently wonderful and very convincing.When the action starts, we are quickly introduced to elderly Lenny Savage (Philip Bosco) who is suffering from the beginning stages of dementia. Lenny lives with his girlfriend of twenty years in Sun City, Arizona; and he doesn't have any contact with his two adult children. It's also explained to us that Lenny wasn't exactly a nurturing father, either. Eduardo (David Zayas), the home health care attendant for Lenny's girlfriend, finds Lenny playing with something that should have been flushed down the toilet. After that, it's only a short time before Lenny's adult children Wendy Savage (Laura Linney) and Jon Savage (Philip Seymour Hoffman) are called in--and they're called in all the faster when Lenny's girlfriend dies and her relatives insist that Lenny move out.Jon and Wendy fight over where to put their father; but he is soon moved to a nursing home in Buffalo near where Jon works as a professor. Wendy thinks a nursing home is horrible but Jon reminds her they can't afford assisted living and realistically there aren't many other choices for their father. It's remarkable just how much these two adult children care for a father after nearly twenty years of silence, not even knowing where he was living, and taking abuse from him daily when they were both young children and very vulnerable.It's also interesting to see the emotional pain Jon and Wendy almost silently endure when having to deal with each other and their elderly father. The scars are not healed; and the acting is quite convincing. You can really feel the pent up emotions from the dysfunctional family dynamics that were never resolved. This adds a lot to the movie.Meanwhile, Wendy struggles along with her married boyfriend Larry (Peter Friedman). Jon breaks up with his girlfriend Kasia (Cara Seymour) after her visa expires and she must return to her native Poland because neither she nor Jon are ready for marriage.What happens from here? The plot can go anywhere. Will Lenny and his children ever even begin to resolve their differences from the past? Will Jon or Wendy find love? What about Wendy's grant so that she can put on a semi-autobiographical play? Will she get the grant money? Watch and find out!The DVD comes with some interesting extras; I especially liked the ""extended scenes"" and there's another very good feature entitled ""About The Savages.""The Savages deals with family relationships on several different levels simultaneously and for this reason The Savages is a very good film. True, it moves a bit too slowly and they could have cut a few minutes here and there; but the overall effect is still quite satisfying. I highly recommend this movie for people studying family dynamics and people who are dealing with the issues of caring for an elderly parent.

How do you find a nursing home for your demented father? How do you make that room one you want to live in? How do you provide love when there wasn't any at the beginning?  Tamara Jenkins, the writer and director has provided a story that none of us want to live, but one we all need to see.""Jenkins and her three astonishing actors create comic devastation out of situations as serious as a mental meltdown and picking out just the right nursing home. There is nothing cozy about The Savages. Bosco, a theater legend, seizes his juiciest film role and makes every shocking moment count. And Linney is an amazement, showing vulnerability and strength at war for a character's soul. As for Hoffman, is this his year, or what?"" Peter TraversThis film is one that is so poignant, and we can all see some vestiges of our families in this tale. There have been few films that show us what real life is like when someone in our family has dementia. This film portrays that reality with humour and finally with understanding.Highly Recommended.  prisrob 04-26-08Before the Devil Knows You're DeadYou Can Count on Me",5,Where Does Theatre End And Real Life Begin?,1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,2967,"['pleasure', 'true-to-life', 'tale', 'told', 'director', 'actors', 'who', ""'ve"", 'sunk', 'so', 'deep', 'movie', 'together', 'wonder', 'how', 'ever', 'surfaced', 'live', 'Jon', 'Wendy', 'Savage', 'gratefully', 'even', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'do', 'same', 'Manohla', 'Dargis', 'mess', 'up', 'mum', 'dad', 'Philip', 'Larkin', 'wrote', 'Peter', 'Travers', 'two', 'Savages', 'Wendy', 'Jon', 'are', 'screwed', 'up', 'come', 'are', 'likable', 'wonderfully', 'human', 'people', 'Wendy', 'NYC', 'temp', 'trying', 'write', 'plays', 'John', 'professor', 'Brecht', 'Buffalo-', 'yes', 'do', 'shuffle', 'off', 'Buffalo', 'Wendy', 'married', 'lover', 'Jon', 'Polish', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'able', 'commit', 'visa', 'father', 'whom', 'have', 'been', 'estranged', 'most', 'life', 'dementia', 'care', 'Here', 'come', 'rescue-', 'travel', 'Arizona', 'bring', 'back', 'Buffalo', 'nursing', 'home', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'caring', 'father', 'whom', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'who', 'probably', 'physically', 'abused', 'who', 'can', 'still', 'get', 'little', 'ways.The', 'film', 'days', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'dying', 'Lenny', 'played', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'stage', 'actor', 'who', 'completed', '40', 'films', 'true', 'actor', 'Wendy', 'played', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'always', 'study', 'definition', 'pure', 'acting', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Jon', 'who', 'giant', 'acting', 'industry', 'more', 'bring', 'film', 'together.This', 'movie', 'appreciation', 'nature', 'making', 'who', 'are', 'brother', 'sister', 'Jon', 'Wendy', 'are', 'able', 'bring', 'home', 'Not', 'enough', 'superlatives', 'can', 'be', 'stated', 'acting', 'three', 'actors', 'who', 'make', 'film', 'also', 'film', 'humour', 'everyday', 'issues', 'problems', 'raise', 'head', 'circumstances', 'make', 'are', 'answers', 'film', 'How', 'do', 'find', 'nursing', 'home', 'demented', 'father', 'How', 'do', 'make', 'room', 'one', 'want', 'live', 'How', 'do', 'provide', 'love', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'beginning', 'Tamara', 'Jenkins', 'writer', 'director', 'provided', 'story', 'none', 'want', 'live', 'one', 'need', 'see', 'Jenkins', 'three', 'astonishing', 'actors', 'create', 'comic', 'devastation', 'situations', 'as', 'serious', 'mental', 'meltdown', 'picking', 'out', 'just', 'right', 'nursing', 'home', 'nothing', 'cozy', 'Savages', 'Bosco', 'theater', 'legend', 'juiciest', 'film', 'role', 'shocking', 'moment', 'count', 'Linney', 'amazement', 'showing', 'vulnerability', 'strength', 'war', 'character', 'soul', 'Hoffman', 'year', 'what', 'Peter', 'TraversThis', 'film', 'one', 'so', 'poignant', 'can', 'see', 'vestiges', 'families', 'tale', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'films', 'show', 'what', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'someone', 'family', 'dementia', 'film', 'reality', 'humour', 'finally', 'understanding.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', 'Devil', 'Knows', ""'re"", 'DeadYou', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me']",N/A

A brother (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and his sister (Laura Linney) are forced to reunite upon their learning that Dad's long time girlfriend of 20 years has passed away, he is being kicked out of her house in Arizona by her children due to pre-nuptual agreement that states he is not allowed to stay in the house once his girlfriend (their mother) is dead.  What is not helping is that Dad is diagnosed with the early stage of dementia and needs around the clock care.  As we watch father and daughter taking trip from Arizona to New York and siblings struggling to agree with their new responsibilites about their long absent parent who never really took proper care of them while they were kids, one cannot be but touched by the fact that these two do have a decency to take care of their helpless father in spite of emotional harm he has done to them as they were growing up.  These siblings are damaged goods.  They are in their late thirties, early forties, single with mediocre careers barely able to take care of themselves.  When they want to feel good, they simply take the pill.  But as this story continues, we see brother and sister bond and take care of each other.  The death of their estranged parent is a license for both of them to re-examine their lives and start again.  The film has many comedic moments in spite of the ulimate sadness of the story.

While the characters of the brother and sister are self-centred and somewhat dysfunctional, they both step  up to bat to take over the care of their elderly father when his dementia causes a crisis that unfolds with the death of his  common-law spouse (the one with the money) out West in the retirement community of Sun City, AZ  This is all the more surprising and commendable since the script alludes to the fact that both parents of  the siblings had ignored them or abandoned them during their formative years.However, the need to look after someone other than a plant or a cat shakes up both brother and sister.  The father dies in the nursing home (a bit too neatly) but the children are redeemed and each turns out to be a  positive influence on the other.This sad and blackly comic film was beautifully written and  had strong performances by all the actors.

In the hands of the very adept writer/director Tamara Jenkins, ""The Savages"" lets out all the stops. These characters are all damaged, in one way or another, and the screenplay allows great latitude to show the humor in everyday human foibles. Indeed, there's loads of unrequited familial love that has never been given the chance to flow naturally. Laura Linney and P.S. Hoffman are excellent, perfectly cast, and the wonderful Philip Bosco is on hand to add considerable angst to the proceedings. DVD extras are few but there's a nice making-of segment that explains a lot, and allows Ms. Jenkins to cite her connection to the story.

1144670,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0013Z5B0A,RMurray847,"[17, 18]","Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney give us a pair of performances right out of their standard playbooks...and the remarkable thing is that they both work so well. Hoffman's slobby demeanor, unshaven face, red eyes and a delivery so bored you can tell it just feels like his character can barely stand the idea of talking are nothing new...but they are still effective. Linney gives another over-energized, on-the-edge but super intelligent performance...again, nothing new...but still very welcome.These two play siblings of the Savage family, who, while not exactly estranged, probably aren't spending much time with each other either. Hoffman is a Brecht scholar and professor in Buffalo, and Linney works as a temp in NYC, while waiting for a grant that will allow her to pursue her dreams of playwrighting. They are brought together when they have to bring their father (Philip Bosco) back to New York after his long-time girlfriend dies. Dad is suffering from early stages of dementia and has other ailments, so Hoffman persuades Linney that the only place for dad is a nursing home.I fully expected this movie to be an indictment against our treatment of the elderly, or one of those family dramas where everyone yells at each other all the time. Instead, the siblings are mostly uncomfortable with each other. Each is in the end-stages of relationships and neither feels comfortable sharing much about their personal lives. They agree to live together for a little while, so they can trade off looking in on dad. The movie mostly explores their brittle relationship with each other. Dad clearly wasn't much in the parenting department, and no doubt his kids owe a lot of their failures and foibles to that fact...but Dad is now mostly a non-entity. He sometimes recognizes them, and sometimes he resists efforts to move him or change his clothes...but mostly he is lost and passive. He's hardly the man they both grew to dislike...he's mostly an obligation. To the credit of the brother and sister, they never argue over who will ""take care of dad"" or spout clich&eacute;s like ""you're getting off easy."" They both understand that this burden has fallen to them, and while not happy about, they will handle it.Hoffman is more practical. He finds Dad a nursing home near his house. It's got a plain exterior and feels like a hospital. They take medicare and can provide for dad. (In fact, I really enjoyed the fact that this home, while still somewhat depressing, actually cared for its patients, treated them with respect and didn't generate any enmity from the audience.) To Hoffman, the place is fine. Linney wants dad somewhere ""nicer,"" preferably a place in Vermont. She is somewhat driven to find her dad a nicer spot...probably out of some misplaced guilt.Not a lot happens in this film. Director and writer Tamara Jenkins is very blessed to have these two great actors, because they make all their interactions crackle with wit, sadness and believability. They love each other...but not in a way that gives them much joy. They are siblings who share little beyond an appreciation for theatre and a dieing father. Yet in many ways, the movie shows them jockeying for the approval of the other. Linney wants to be successful in her brother's eyes, because she thinks he looks down on her. Truth is, he doesn't look down on her all that much...but he's pretty down on himself too and that drags everyone under. Hoffman and Linney are a great cinematic team, and I'd love to see them work together on something again. They whole time I was watching them, I was imagining seeing them in a play together...that would be worth seeing.Philip Bosco is also VERY good as the father. His expression alternates from confusion to anger to disappointment to sadness to emptiness to very mild happiness. He's not an easy guy to like...but he is by no means the clich&eacute;s dementia victim so many movies dish out. In fact, Jenkins has made all three characters very specific and unique. While it's always a bit heavy-handed to see characters who are writers or ""in theatre,"" even that works for this film, because these two have to live out pretend lives because their real lives hold so little joy. (It's a very nice touch that Hoffman is a Brecht scholar...Brecht was all about the head and not the heart. He didn't want his plays to have real emotion...Hoffman's character is somewhat afraid of real emotion too.)This isn't an earth-shattering film. It has moments of great humor and also some sadness. Mostly, it just feels like a fairly believable slice-of-life. It's not an important film...but it has some great performances, and that makes it very worthwhile.",5,Two Oscar-worthy performances and a thoughtful script!,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,4674,"['Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'give', 'pair', 'performances', 'right', 'standard', 'playbooks', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Hoffman', 'slobby', 'demeanor', 'unshaven', 'face', 'red', 'eyes', 'delivery', 'so', 'can', 'tell', 'just', 'feels', 'character', 'can', 'barely', 'stand', 'idea', 'talking', 'are', 'nothing', 'new', 'are', 'still', 'effective', 'Linney', 'over-energized', 'on-the-edge', 'super', 'intelligent', 'performance', 'again', 'nothing', 'new', 'still', 'very', 'welcome.These', 'two', 'play', 'siblings', 'Savage', 'family', 'who', 'not', 'exactly', 'estranged', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'spending', 'much', 'time', 'other', 'either', 'Hoffman', 'Brecht', 'scholar', 'professor', 'Buffalo', 'Linney', 'temp', 'NYC', 'waiting', 'grant', 'will', 'allow', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'playwrighting', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'when', 'have', 'bring', 'father', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'long-time', 'girlfriend', 'dies', 'Dad', 'suffering', 'early', 'stages', 'dementia', 'other', 'ailments', 'Hoffman', 'Linney', 'only', 'place', 'dad', 'nursing', 'home.I', 'fully', 'expected', 'movie', 'be', 'indictment', 'treatment', 'elderly', 'one', 'family', 'dramas', 'where', 'everyone', 'other', 'time', 'Instead', 'siblings', 'are', 'mostly', 'uncomfortable', 'other', 'end-stages', 'relationships', 'feels', 'comfortable', 'sharing', 'much', 'personal', 'lives', 'agree', 'live', 'together', 'little', 'while', 'can', 'trade', 'off', 'looking', 'dad', 'movie', 'mostly', 'brittle', 'relationship', 'other', 'Dad', 'clearly', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'parenting', 'department', 'doubt', 'kids', 'owe', 'lot', 'failures', 'foibles', 'fact', 'Dad', 'now', 'mostly', 'non-entity', 'sometimes', 'sometimes', 'efforts', 'move', 'change', 'clothes', 'mostly', 'lost', 'passive', 'hardly', 'man', 'grew', 'dislike', 'mostly', 'obligation', 'credit', 'brother', 'sister', 'never', 'argue', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'dad', 'spout', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'re"", 'getting', 'off', 'easy', 'understand', 'burden', 'fallen', 'not', 'happy', 'will', 'handle', 'it.Hoffman', 'more', 'practical', 'nursing', 'home', 'house', 'got', 'plain', 'exterior', 'feels', 'hospital', 'take', 'medicare', 'can', 'provide', 'dad', 'fact', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'home', 'still', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'actually', 'cared', 'patients', 'treated', 'respect', 'did', ""n't"", 'generate', 'enmity', 'audience', 'Hoffman', 'place', 'fine', 'Linney', 'dad', 'somewhere', 'nicer', 'preferably', 'place', 'Vermont', 'somewhat', 'driven', 'find', 'dad', 'nicer', 'spot', 'probably', 'misplaced', 'guilt.Not', 'lot', 'film', 'Director', 'writer', 'Tamara', 'Jenkins', 'very', 'blessed', 'have', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'make', 'interactions', 'crackle', 'wit', 'sadness', 'believability', 'love', 'other', 'not', 'way', 'much', 'joy', 'are', 'siblings', 'who', 'share', 'little', 'appreciation', 'theatre', 'dieing', 'father', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'jockeying', 'approval', 'other', 'Linney', 'be', 'successful', 'brother', 'eyes', 'down', 'Truth', ""n't"", 'look', 'down', 'much', 'pretty', 'down', 'too', 'everyone', 'Hoffman', 'Linney', 'are', 'great', 'cinematic', 'team', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'work', 'together', 'something', 'again', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'imagining', 'seeing', 'play', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'seeing.Philip', 'Bosco', 'also', 'VERY', 'good', 'father', 'expression', 'confusion', 'anger', 'disappointment', 'sadness', 'emptiness', 'very', 'mild', 'happiness', 'not', 'easy', 'guy', 'like', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dementia', 'victim', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'dish', 'out', 'fact', 'Jenkins', 'made', 'three', 'characters', 'very', 'specific', 'unique', 'always', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'see', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'writers', 'theatre', 'even', 'film', 'two', 'have', 'live', 'out', 'pretend', 'lives', 'real', 'lives', 'hold', 'so', 'little', 'joy', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'Hoffman', 'Brecht', 'scholar', 'Brecht', 'was', 'head', 'not', 'heart', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'plays', 'have', 'real', 'emotion', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'somewhat', 'afraid', 'real', 'emotion', 'too', ""n't"", 'earth-shattering', 'film', 'moments', 'great', 'humor', 'also', 'sadness', 'Mostly', 'just', 'feels', 'fairly', 'believable', 'slice-of-life', 'not', 'important', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'very', 'worthwhile']",N/A

Zwick,"[3, 3]","As we move ever further into the 21st Century, more and more Baby Boomers and Gen-Xers are finding themselves thrust into the role of primary caregiver to their ailing and aging parents.  Such a situation is challenging enough even under the best of circumstances, but what if the person who needs taking care of was never a loving and nurturing parent to begin with, or the middle-aged child has more than enough problems on his own plate to deal with?  This is the dilemma faced by John and Wendy Savage, a brother and sister who have long been estranged from the father who left them when they were youngsters but who has now come back into their lives after he can no longer take care of himself.  Despite the fact that the siblings feel little emotional attachment to their father, they agree to do the decent thing by caring for him in his final days, even though his dementia makes it nearly impossible for them to heal old wounds or build a filial bridge between the two generations.Meanwhile, John and Wendy, both unmarried and childless, aren't exactly what one would call models of highly functional and successful adults in their own right.  John is a theater professor and part-time author who lives in a shabby Buffalo apartment with a girl from Poland who is being deported because John - commitment-phobe that he is - can't bring himself to marry her.  Wendy is an unsuccessful playwright who pays the bills with temp jobs and has been carrying on a dead-end affair with a married man for years.""The Savages"" works on a dual level, exposing the grim realities of aging, while at the same time exploring the complexities of familial (i.e. parent-child and sibling) relationships.  The strain on everyone caught in this type of a predicament can be devastating and overwhelming, and writer/director Tamara Jenkins examines the situation from all angles.  John and Wendy have an understandable urge to live their own lives, and they feel ill-equipped to cope with this new burden that has been suddenly placed upon them.  The situation also opens up old wounds related to their upbringing and heightens their own feelings of inadequacy and failure.  John and Wendy are also not above turning against one another when the world gets to be a bit too much for them to handle, wounding each other with verbal thrusts and jabs carefully aimed at their various weaknesses and vulnerabilities.The subject matter is obviously dark and brooding, but the filmmakers inject a surprising amount of biting, whistling-past-the-graveyard humor to help lighten the load.  They are also helped in this regard by the rich and engaging performances of its three leading actors.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is remarkably quiet and subdued in his role of John, the more cynical of the two children who feels a little less guilt-ridden about doing the minimum for a man who never took on the very role of paternal caregiver to his children that they are assuming for him.  As the father, Philip Bosco rises to the difficult challenge of portraying a man who`s lost much of his ability to connect with the world around him.  But it is Laura Linney who provides the warm human center that lifts the movie above the dreary nature of its material.  It is Wendy who struggles most with doing what is right by trying to make the last days of a man who abandoned her as comfortable as possible.  In her every word and gesture, Linney shows that she understands the paradoxical nature of the character she is being called on to play, revealing her weaknesses and vulnerabilities, while, at the same time, showing her to be a woman of strength and character, even if she has trouble displaying much of either of those qualities in her own life.  In fact, we sense that Wendy does quite a bit of growing up in the course of her struggles.  Wendy may hate her father for never being there for her and her brother, but she knows maturity means moving beyond one's bitterness over the past and responding to the basic humanity of even the most undeserving among us.What I like about ""The Savages"" is that it doesn't devolve into angst-ridden hand-wringing or self-aggrandizing melodramatics in dealing with its topic.  Instead, in this her fifth film as a director, Jenkins illuminates a difficult subject with subtlety, insight and compassion.

1144674,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B0013Z5B0A,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[3, 3]","Writer/director Tamara Jenkins' ""The Savages"" is one of those rare coming-of-age films that avoids cliches and comes across wholly genuine. Jenkins understands that coming-of-age is not only for the young, bringing out in her characters what the average filmmaker would easily miss. Her directing skill is also profoundly exquisite - she does not merely capture her Oscar-nominated screenplay on celluloid but makes it transcend the screen. No High Definition necessary.Jon and Wendy Savage, portrayed by the aptly-celebrated Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney, are a brother and sister whose vast emotional distance is mirrored by their respective residences in Buffalo, N.Y. and Manhattan. This comfortable disparity is severed, however, when their equally distant father Leonard, played by Philip Bosco, succumbs to dementia brought on by Parkinson's disease soon after his long-time girlfriend passes away. Floating in and out of consciousness, he is no longer able to fend for himself, forcing his children to undertake the difficult task of transporting him from sunny Arizona to frigid Buffalo where they can more optimally watch over him in a private nursing home.The premise is hardly light, but Jenkins finds humor in the seemingly mundane. Jon is a philosophy professor consistently teaching new ways to open the mind yet could not be more closed-off to any viewpoints other than his own. Wendy divides her time between writing her ""subversive, semi-autobiographical"" stage play and romping with her neighbor in spite of his being married mostly because she is fond of his dog. Meanwhile, facing the fact that they must care for their father - a father who never truly took care of them - becomes more cumbersome for the duo than they care to admit.In her third Oscar-nominated performance Linney is fantastic as usual, fully capturing the difficult transition that Wendy has to make not only where her father is concerned but in how she must rescue herself from artistic and personal stagnation. Hoffman also impresses as the more cynical of the duo, wrapped up in collegiate pretense and personal demons. Bosco may have the most work cut out for him, however. Perfectly bringing to light the capricious consciousness that accompanies dementia, he clinches Jenkins' poignant script.The icicles of New York State reach out and grab the listener as fully as the palm fronds and summer breezes of Arizona with Jenkins behind the lens. A screenwriter with her astute directing skill is a rare commodity, especially in today's fickle industry. The subject matter may run the risk of becoming dour or cloying, but she never allows it to fall into those traps. Interjecting her grave, gripping premise with subtle, wry humor, she makes ""The Savages"" a true pleasure.",4,Aren't We All 'Savages'?,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,2776,"['Writer/director', 'Tamara', 'Jenkins', 'Savages', 'one', 'rare', 'coming-of-age', 'films', 'avoids', 'cliches', 'across', 'wholly', 'genuine', 'Jenkins', 'coming-of-age', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'bringing', 'out', 'characters', 'what', 'average', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'easily', 'miss', 'directing', 'skill', 'also', 'profoundly', 'exquisite', 'not', 'merely', 'capture', 'Oscar-nominated', 'screenplay', 'celluloid', 'transcend', 'screen', 'High', 'Definition', 'necessary.Jon', 'Wendy', 'Savage', 'portrayed', 'aptly-celebrated', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'are', 'brother', 'sister', 'vast', 'emotional', 'distance', 'mirrored', 'respective', 'residences', 'Buffalo', 'N.Y.', 'Manhattan', 'comfortable', 'disparity', 'severed', 'however', 'when', 'equally', 'distant', 'father', 'Leonard', 'played', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'dementia', 'brought', 'Parkinson', 'disease', 'soon', 'long-time', 'girlfriend', 'away', 'Floating', 'consciousness', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'fend', 'forcing', 'children', 'undertake', 'difficult', 'task', 'transporting', 'sunny', 'Arizona', 'frigid', 'Buffalo', 'where', 'can', 'more', 'optimally', 'watch', 'private', 'nursing', 'home.The', 'premise', 'hardly', 'light', 'Jenkins', 'humor', 'seemingly', 'mundane', 'Jon', 'philosophy', 'professor', 'consistently', 'teaching', 'new', 'ways', 'open', 'mind', 'yet', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'closed-off', 'viewpoints', 'other', 'own', 'Wendy', 'time', 'writing', 'subversive', 'semi-autobiographical', 'stage', 'play', 'romping', 'neighbor', 'spite', 'being', 'married', 'mostly', 'fond', 'dog', 'Meanwhile', 'facing', 'fact', 'must', 'care', 'father', 'father', 'who', 'never', 'truly', 'took', 'care', 'more', 'cumbersome', 'duo', 'care', 'admit.In', 'third', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'Linney', 'fantastic', 'usual', 'fully', 'capturing', 'difficult', 'transition', 'Wendy', 'make', 'not', 'only', 'where', 'father', 'concerned', 'how', 'must', 'rescue', 'artistic', 'personal', 'stagnation', 'Hoffman', 'also', 'more', 'cynical', 'duo', 'wrapped', 'up', 'collegiate', 'pretense', 'personal', 'demons', 'Bosco', 'may', 'have', 'most', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'however', 'Perfectly', 'bringing', 'light', 'capricious', 'consciousness', 'dementia', 'Jenkins', 'poignant', 'script.The', 'icicles', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'reach', 'out', 'grab', 'listener', 'as', 'fully', 'palm', 'fronds', 'summer', 'breezes', 'Arizona', 'Jenkins', 'lens', 'screenwriter', 'astute', 'directing', 'skill', 'rare', 'commodity', 'especially', 'today', 'fickle', 'industry', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'run', 'risk', 'becoming', 'dour', 'cloying', 'never', 'fall', 'traps', 'Interjecting', 'grave', 'gripping', 'premise', 'subtle', 'wry', 'humor', 'Savages', 'true', 'pleasure']",N/A
1144675,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0013Z5B0A,Samuel McKewon,"[4, 6]","A slovenly Brecht scholar and his sorta-playwright sister watch their estranged father die in Tamara Jenkins' ""The Savages,"" which never quite decides if it'd like to be a satire, Bergman-style claustrodrama or one of those high-end, visually static art pictures that might as well be performed on a stage. And for good reason - Jenkins, like a lot of her gifted contemporaries, is not aspiring to be Lars Von Trier; rather, she's merely a bright, literate filmmaker cobbling together experiences, jokes and observations into something resembling a loose plot, filmed in whatever style suits her mood that day. As a coherent vision, it isn't; it's really a blog of, oh, Wonkette quality, as emotions, dialogue and character arcs change briskly, presumably according to the quality of one's donut that morning, or the intensity of conversation the night before. The ending of ""The Savages"" is surprisingly foolish. Sugary even. Not merely unearned, it seems like A Life Lesson Learned. It's soft-core Tama Janowitz turned ""One True Thing."" C'mon now. You feel like taking a few names in vain.Such is often the lot of those trying to give voice and grant victory to Generation X All Grown Up as it struggles to get a scoop of the pie hoarded by Baby Boomers, who are forever to trying to recapture their youth (that is, use wistfulness as a means of control and generational subjugation) through the social (sexual) exploitation of their junior partner. In Jon and Wendy Savage, the slob/snob combo played by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney, we see emotional immaturity froth into sloppy attempts at intimacy, a willingness to take life on the chin, marijuana as a coping mechanism, an inability to finish, a helping of shame or that character trait a bit farther down the subway line - sloth. It'd be a fresh woman's perspective if Nicole Holofcener, the Sprecher sisters, Lisa Cholodenko, and Rebecca Miller hadn't made the same commentaries in the last six years. Or if Jenkins hadn't so expertly charted this journey in ""The Slums of Beverly Hills"" eight years ago. Or if Noah Baumbach, Nicole Kidman, and the DDG Jennifer Jason Leigh hadn't thrown ""Margot at the Wedding"" into the arena. ""The Savages"" can't bust free of all that; its best foot, so to speak, are Hoffman and Linney, who are decent but unspectacular.It's Linney's Wendy who gets top billing; Jon's too skilled at emotional distance to be the lead of any kind of funny movie Jenkins would make. Wendy's a temp of some kind, working on a play about her childhood, the title and contents of which don't seem very original. At any rate, she's the prototypical Gen X girl, sleeping with a married, balding Boomer, mostly, it seems, out of kindness and some affinity for the guy's dog. After a tryst with said MBB, she checks her answering machine: Come get your dad, a voice says. He's writing in his own feces.For Lenny (Philip Bosco), this seems like an act of defiance and dementia, but when his live-in girlfriend dies at the nail salon shortly after this episode, it really doesn't matter. The lady's kids don't want him. Jon and Wendy's turn.The short opening act, in which siblings are dragged back into Lenny's life and forced to find him a new home, is nearly perfect; over the opening credits, Jenkins presents a goofy, Tim Burton sideshow of Sun City, Arizona - its landscaping done a spare, Feng Shui style, an apt amphitheater for what can only be considered an elderly pom-pom squad - only to quickly reveal a harsher core, of, frankly, fat, unhappy people (a rude male nurse, the aforementioned pushy kids). Shades of ""Blue Velvet?"" I considered it. More like Soundgarden's ""Black Hole Sun"" video. Jon and Wendy look like pinned specimens in this environment: Too much light, too much heat, not enough crawl-in spots to hide, waste time and nurse wounds in.Predictably, Jon leaves Sun City early - this is not a man who chooses to trouble himself much with people, even a kind Polish lover (Cara Seymour) whose visa is about to expire. And Wendy has to bring Lenny back to Buffalo on a plane by herself. The first misstep in ""The Savages"" occurs on that ride - an embarrassing trip to the bathroom with little setup or payoff - and Jenkins proceeds to recommit the crimes, over and over: A freak neck injury during a tennis match at the local gym, a confession regarding Wendy's apparent Guggenheim grant, a movie night at Lenny's nursing home, where Lenny inexplicably chooses ""The Jazz Singer"" to show to patients and all-black orderly staff. Jenkins evens finds time to further the ""wise immigrant"" myth, complete with a counseling session for Wendy and a smooth ""pffft!"" of pot roach. Then she tries to kiss the wise orderly, and he-Well, look. ""The Savages"" is witty enough, and occasionally on point: Jenkins shows herself to be a person who'd make a good Starbucks Buddy. Jon's rant about upscale nursing homes - which prey on the emotions of the patient's family - is a perfect commentary on the dilemma of the Gen Xer: ""Am I doing the right thing? Is this nice enough? Would my older, wiser friends approve?"" Jon's cynical, pathetic worldview just happens to be on the right side of this issue, and Hoffman, as always, knows where to find an ounce of intellectual rage in his performance. Jenkins negates this speech, mind you, by deeming it cruel (she does so by cutting to a wide shot of a daughter pushing her mother in a wheelchair, clearly in earshot).But wit and just-so observations are better kept in seven-page short stories that make the literary journal circuit. Quaint, look-at-my-world lists are fine for filler, but they don't drive drama, and Jenkins proves it in the movie's last act, where, sans rimshots, she relies on trembling hands, the ""weird sleep"" two-shot, shots of a gray sky and free parting gifts to the characters, courtesy of off-screen growth marked by the title card ""six months later."" In those final scenes, Jon has a line about Wendy's work that so false and empty that Hoffman seems pained to say it.Which is interesting, because Hoffman saves a lot of the scenes that Linney either overplays or overtly conforms to Jenkins' shabby direction. A number of times, Linney steps out of character and declares her line, as if to bump the story along. By her nature, Linney is a lot like Jennifer Aniston, a brittle, barking actor, all nerve endings, hand gestures, and worrisome looks. Many of her key roles - ""You Can Count On Me,"" ""The Squid and the Whale,"" - are as responsible, guilt-ridden, overburdened caretakers on the verge of subversive behavior. She does not, in short, have the persona of someone who became estranged from their father and brother for years, and she doesn't wear it well.",3,"Aims for insight, settles for

They can be selfish, petty, disconnected from other people and from deeper feelings; they're not particularly likable or have a winning charm.  But the movie still gives them humanity; mixed in with their stark flaws are some decent impulses and moments of laughter, growth and understated connection.Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney in large part make this humanity and sympathy for the characters possible; they become their characters, Jon and Wendy, a brother and sister who suddenly find that they need to care for their estranged father.  Hoffman gives Jon a scruffy hyper-intellectuality.  He conveys cynicism, boredom, and skepticism with a single deadpan look; he can make himself look wonderfully pained and long-suffering, both for comic effect or to convey real anguish.  Laura Linney plays Wendy as bright, neurotic, and full of child-like confusion and hurt.  You sense that both these characters never really left their childhoods behind, that they're stunted; throughout the film they become less stunted, if only slightly, and in certain ways more wise and appreciative of life and its possibilities.  Hoffman and Linney are also great at conveying the unspoken, unsentimental bond between the siblings; Jon and Wendy understand each other and are present in each other's lives in ways that don't need to be articulated.  I enjoyed that element of the film - the kind of relationship the siblings share.Though the movie reveals at several points that their father, Lenny, was neglectful and abusive, it doesn't dwell on these painful past events.  It's about the present - where the characters are in their lives, and how simply attributing their current poor choices and character flaws to their bad childhood won't in and of itself do much to help them improve or move on.  I like how, instead of some grand triumph, the characters change in smaller but also meaningful ways, though they're still far from perfect.  And the last shot in the film lifted my heart a little.I wouldn't say that this is a great and tremendous film, but it's worth watching just for Hoffman and Linney's performances.  The dialogue's also sharp, full of dark humor and interesting observations, and I liked how the film understands the characters and for the most part lets them just be who they are.",4,Hoffman and Linney are great here,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,2373,"['liked', 'Savages', 'film', 'characters', 'be', 'can', 'be', 'selfish', 'petty', 'disconnected', 'other', 'people', 'deeper', 'feelings', ""'re"", 'not', 'particularly', 'likable', 'have', 'winning', 'charm', 'movie', 'still', 'humanity', 'mixed', 'stark', 'flaws', 'are', 'decent', 'impulses', 'moments', 'laughter', 'growth', 'understated', 'connection.Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'large', 'part', 'make', 'humanity', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'possible', 'become', 'characters', 'Jon', 'Wendy', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'suddenly', 'find', 'need', 'care', 'estranged', 'father', 'Hoffman', 'Jon', 'scruffy', 'hyper-intellectuality', 'conveys', 'cynicism', 'boredom', 'skepticism', 'single', 'deadpan', 'look', 'can', 'make', 'look', 'wonderfully', 'pained', 'long-suffering', 'comic', 'effect', 'convey', 'real', 'anguish', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Wendy', 'bright', 'neurotic', 'full', 'child-like', 'confusion', 'hurt', 'sense', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'left', 'childhoods', ""'re"", 'stunted', 'film', 'become', 'less', 'stunted', 'only', 'slightly', 'certain', 'ways', 'more', 'wise', 'appreciative', 'life', 'possibilities', 'Hoffman', 'Linney', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'conveying', 'unspoken', 'unsentimental', 'bond', 'siblings', 'Jon', 'Wendy', 'understand', 'other', 'are', 'present', 'other', 'lives', 'ways', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'articulated', 'enjoyed', 'element', 'film', 'kind', 'relationship', 'siblings', 'movie', 'reveals', 'several', 'points', 'father', 'Lenny', 'was', 'neglectful', 'abusive', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'painful', 'past', 'events', 'present', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'lives', 'how', 'simply', 'attributing', 'current', 'poor', 'choices', 'character', 'flaws', 'bad', 'childhood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'help', 'improve', 'move', 'how', 'instead', 'grand', 'triumph', 'characters', 'change', 'smaller', 'also', 'meaningful', 'ways', ""'re"", 'still', 'far', 'perfect', 'last', 'shot', 'film', 'lifted', 'heart', 'little.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'great', 'tremendous', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'Hoffman', 'Linney', 'performances', 'dialogue', 'also', 'sharp', 'full', 'dark', 'humor', 'interesting', 'observations', 'liked', 'how', 'film', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'be', 'who', 'are']",N/A

With these two actors in the lead roles, how could you expect anything less than great performances. As siblings, Wendy (Laura Linney) and Jon (Philip Seymour Hoffman) are so human, perfectly honest in their portrayals of their characters.  Theirs is not a usual sister and brother relationship. In my opinion, the best part of the film was how these two could keep it real while  it couldn't have been easy to remain comfortable in a heightened situation. To them, it seemed just like second nature.These two are in a horrible situation. They are quickly subjected to having to deal with the care of their elderly father, after not seeing him for years and without any prior notice. They do know him quite well, and this is why they haven't seen him. They were brought up by this very cold natured man and their past with him is alluded to often in different ways. His abusive nature towards them is the most evident.  This has caused these two to have many issues in life involving intimacy. Through it all, Wendy and Jon care for each other and their father and do so with an off-tilt humor that I actually found quite hilarious in parts.Tamara Jenkins, writer and director of this slice of life picture, could not have chosen more esteemed actors to pull this into reality and give it the necessary punch of feeling which it deserves. While Wendy and Jon may seem somewhat closed off at first, they most certainly are not in the long haul and run the gamut of emotions in the short amount of time this movie captures in their lives.This brings to life the ways caring for an elderly parent can affect the adult children with some baggage on board. In their case, it's brought on unexpectedly, suddenly, and sends Wendy into a panic causing her to call her brother Jon. She has not seen her brother in a very long time. These two take charge of the matter brilliantly. With a darker plot their switch into humor is sometimes subtle, then blatant, and can be much appreciated during this chaos.Their lives, before the phone call, were a bit self-absorbed and noticeably involved.After they go through all that they do concerning their father and their own fledgling relationship with each other, you are left knowing that they will remain the brother and sister they become. They will be much richer for it as they each realize the importance of having each other.  Some may say this is in no way a feel good movie and basically it is not. The movie, although, left me feeling better for these two and the relationship they will keep on building through the unsettling way they were forced to begin it.",5,A Savage Reunion,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,2742,"['had', 'been', 'wanting', 'view', 'wonderful', 'film', 'long', 'while', 'finally', 'did', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'genius', 'Linney', 'Hoffman', 'brought', 'two', 'actors', 'lead', 'roles', 'how', 'could', 'expect', 'anything', 'less', 'great', 'performances', 'siblings', 'Wendy', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Jon', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'so', 'human', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'portrayals', 'characters', 'Theirs', 'not', 'usual', 'sister', 'brother', 'relationship', 'opinion', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'two', 'could', 'keep', 'real', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'remain', 'comfortable', 'heightened', 'situation', 'seemed', 'just', 'second', 'nature.These', 'two', 'are', 'horrible', 'situation', 'are', 'quickly', 'subjected', 'having', 'deal', 'care', 'elderly', 'father', 'not', 'seeing', 'years', 'prior', 'notice', 'do', 'know', 'quite', 'well', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'very', 'cold', 'natured', 'man', 'past', 'alluded', 'often', 'different', 'ways', 'abusive', 'nature', 'towards', 'most', 'evident', 'caused', 'two', 'have', 'many', 'issues', 'life', 'involving', 'intimacy', 'Wendy', 'Jon', 'care', 'other', 'father', 'do', 'so', 'off-tilt', 'humor', 'actually', 'found', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'parts.Tamara', 'Jenkins', 'writer', 'director', 'slice', 'life', 'picture', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'chosen', 'more', 'esteemed', 'actors', 'pull', 'reality', 'give', 'necessary', 'punch', 'feeling', 'Wendy', 'Jon', 'may', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'closed', 'off', 'first', 'most', 'certainly', 'are', 'not', 'long', 'haul', 'run', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'movie', 'lives.This', 'brings', 'life', 'ways', 'caring', 'elderly', 'parent', 'can', 'affect', 'adult', 'children', 'baggage', 'board', 'case', 'brought', 'unexpectedly', 'suddenly', 'Wendy', 'panic', 'causing', 'call', 'brother', 'Jon', 'not', 'seen', 'brother', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'two', 'take', 'charge', 'matter', 'brilliantly', 'darker', 'plot', 'switch', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'subtle', 'then', 'blatant', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'appreciated', 'chaos.Their', 'phone', 'call', 'were', 'bit', 'self-absorbed', 'noticeably', 'involved.After', 'go', 'do', 'concerning', 'father', 'own', 'fledgling', 'relationship', 'other', 'are', 'left', 'knowing', 'will', 'remain', 'brother', 'sister', 'become', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'richer', 'realize', 'importance', 'having', 'other', 'may', 'say', 'way', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'basically', 'not', 'movie', 'left', 'feeling', 'better', 'two', 'relationship', 'will', 'keep', 'building', 'unsettling', 'way', 'were', 'forced', 'begin']",N/A

Linney, Hoffman, and Bosco have all been accomplished thespians on stage, film, and television. In this film, Bosco is unrecognizable as the elderly father who has been emotionally absent from children's lives. Linney and HOffman are perfect as his adult children who are both somewhat alone in their lives. Hoffman's role as John Savage is a literature professor who knows more about Bertolt Brecht than about his father. Linnney plays his sister who is a doomed love affair with a colleague and aspires to be a playwright rather than a working temp in New York City. When their father's longtime girlfriend suddenly dies, the Savages come together in Arizona where they must accompany their father back to Buffalo, New York near where John lives and works as a professor. His sister accompanies their dementia stricken father aboard the flight. In this one scene and clip, I think of Linney as one of our finest actresses today. The story picks up where the family tries to become a family despite their estrangements from each other over the years. All three of them should have easily earned Oscar nominations for their performances especially Bosco as their father.

What was their father really like?  While it is understandable to believe they grew apart and tried to remove as much of their earlier years to move on with their life, but I expected their father's demise to bring about some reminiscing and dialogue about their father and their past.Needless to say, my critique doesn't diminish the overall strength of this picture and certainly is a must-see for the performances by Linney and Hoffman.",4,Hoffman & Linney.
