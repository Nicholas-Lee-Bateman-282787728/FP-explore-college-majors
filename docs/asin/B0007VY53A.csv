I don't feel the movie truly expresses the true fear why women go into hiding and take on another identiy.

891905,A14OJS0VWMOSWO,B0007VY53A,Midwest Book Review,"[32, 33]","Frannie and her son have finally escaped a respected police detective who is also a wife-beater: but a life on the run, hiding from friends and family as well as the vengeful husband searching for them, takes it toll on both Frannie and the son who can't quite understand why they left. A new community, new friends, and new job doesn't quite erase the past, and when Robert lets his guard down, trouble results. Can Frannie ever find life free from her husband?

Espicially when you don't have family that is the worse.  To have programs like this to help people get out of their situations.

891909,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0007VY53A,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Based on a novel by acclaimed writer, Anna Quindlen, Black & Blue is the story of a woman who risks everything to get her family away from her abusive husband. There's a problem though, her husband is a New York City Detective, who will stop at nothing to find them. This was originally a made for TV film, but unlike most, the producers didn't tone it down for the small screen. This movie is a terrific example of what it's like to suffer from the horrors of domestic abuse. Mary Stuart Masterson is nothing short of brilliant, in a role that should have made her career. I'd go as far to say that it is the single best performance I've ever seen in a made for TV movie. Young Will Rothhaar was also great, leading to bigger and better roles in the future. This film was more than just entertaining, but important for every person in a similar situation to see and learn from.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,878,"['Based', 'novel', 'acclaimed', 'writer', 'Anna', 'Quindlen', 'Black', 'Blue', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'everything', 'get', 'family', 'away', 'abusive', 'husband', 'problem', 'husband', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Detective', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'find', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'most', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'tone', 'down', 'small', 'screen', 'movie', 'terrific', 'example', 'what', 'suffer', 'horrors', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'career', ""'d"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'single', 'best', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'Young', 'Will', 'Rothhaar', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'leading', 'bigger', 'better', 'roles', 'future', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'entertaining', 'important', 'person', 'similar', 'situation', 'see', 'learn']",N/A
