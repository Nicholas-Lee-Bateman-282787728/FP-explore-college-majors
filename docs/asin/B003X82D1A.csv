Each of the mysteries is complexly plotted and easy to follow the many twists and turns. Kenneth Branagh is amazing as the conflicted, depressed Wallander who verges on the brink of instability and insubordination but whose obsession to solve the crime carries him through exhaustion and personal difficulties.I have not yet read the books, so cannot comment on the adaptation but the writing is very good for the main characters and for the guest stars. The supporting cast is a bit bland. The actors do their best but the writing gives them no personality or individuality, with the exception of the pathologist who is recognizable because he is always standing near the murder victim.

Something about them is more appealing than most US television these days.Anyway, I stumbled upon the Wallander series by accident one day and watched the first episode. I was hooked.The series is based on novels written by a Swedish author which are set in Sweden. There was a Swedish video version and then a British TV version was made later. The British version, reviewed here, is done with UK actors and filmed in Sweden.I think that Wallander is darker and more violent than most British detective programs that I've seen. Graphic at times, but not overdone as in much American television. Just enough to shock a little and keep the viewer's attention riveted.These episodes are the second season.In ""Faceless Killers"", an elderly couple are murdered in their farmhouse for no apparent reason. It gets out that foreigners may be the killers. Apparently, there are some extreme right wing anti-immigrant groups in Sweden, and they get involved. Very shocking conclusion here.""The Man Who Smiled"" involves murder and a big charity. The first murder is a very scary sequence. Lots of twists and turns. Rupert Graves plays the head of the charity. Beware of men who smile - all is not as it seems.In ""The Fifth Woman"", a bird watcher, a florist and a jogger are killed in bizarre ways. Wallander seems to find a girl friend along the way. ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" might apply here - well sort of I guess.Highly recommended. Available on Netflix streaming.

We are back in Sweden,walking with Wallander who is sometimes more important to the plot than the crime. There is nodoubt these are character driven mysteries and Kenneth Branagh is again up to the task brilliantly.The first episode of three, ""Faceless Killers"", investigates the slaying of an elderly couple at aremote farmhouse. A leak from the police about the wife's dying words sparks racist violence andall the fallout has Wallander doubting his abilities as a police officer. During the investigation he isaccused by his daughter of being a racist.The second entry of the series, ""The Man Who Smiled"", has an old friend of  Kurt Wallander's highlysuspicious that his father has been murdered. At first Wallander refuses to get involved because hehas been suspended from the force, but as events pile up he is convinced to take a closer look atthe case. It is a corker. There is an international conspiracy afoot that can threaten countlessinnocent lives.The third and last of Series Two is ""The Fifth Woman"". This is another of those cases that seem tobe unconnected but Wallander feels there is a connection. A bird-watcher falls to his death in whatappears to be a well planned murder. The seemingly unconnected case of a local man disappearingis getting Wallander increasingly suspicious that he may be looking for a serial killer bent uponrevenge.Wallander also gets too close to one of the suspects (this is Wallander's weakness and strength aswell) which can serve him as well as undermine his investigation. Wallander must also deal with hisdying father as the killings progress. Yes, family still intervenes into his life as it can for most of us.This series, like the last one, is intelligent and thoughtful. I was pulled along as if I were on thetrail with Wallander.  The photography is splendid as usual, again with bluish overtones that seemsto cast a pall over Wallander's proceedings. The series is maturing as the production crew  and castcontinue to explore the Wallander series.This Series deserves a 5 Star rating for its high production values, photography, writing and acting.Terrific stuff for all you mystery fans out there.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOTE: At the time of this review you are able to stream this series Free if you are an AmazonPrime member.

Thurlow,"[5, 5]","BBC has produced a second set of excellent film adaptations of Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander detective novels, returning most of the original cast, including Kenneth Branagh, who absolutely inhabits Mankell's moody Swedish detective on screen.  Like the first series, these three films are set on location in and around the southern coastal city of Ystad. The evocative Swedish landscape helps set the tone of the films.In ""Faceless Killers"", an elderly couple are slaughtered in their own home.  Foreigners are suspected, and Wallander ends up in a race against time to find and stop the real killers before Ystad explodes in hate crimes.  Wallander himself ends up being a casualty of the violence.In ""The Man Who Smiled"", Wallander, out on extended sick leave, is approached by an old acquaitance, who asks him to check into the mysterious death of his elderly father.  Wallander discovers a trail of clues that lead back to a wealthy philanthropist and another burnt-out policeman.  Wallander will have to argue his way back on duty to solve a difficult case.In ""The Fifth Woman"", a series of vicious revenge killings have the Ystad police scratching their heads.  Only Wallander has the intuitive insight and dogged determination to connect the cases and capture a mysterious and ruthless killer.The ""Wallander"" mysteries are not for everyone.  Wallander himself is unable to remained detached from his work; his personal life is a painful emotional trainwreck.  The stories are quite dark; those who need clean happy endings are likely to be disapppointed.  Fans of the novels should expect that complex plots have been simplified for the screen.

If, on the other hand, you find Wallander and his world too bleak (I disagree with respect, but this is a matter of taste), you are well advised to pass up the second set. Regardless whether you have read Henning Mankell's Wallander novels - great literature in the disguise of great detective fiction - or not, the film scripts can stand on their own merits, as the plots are, to the most part, intelligently curtailed and extracted from the books. The cast of characters is excellent, the films, beautifully shot against the colorful backdrop of the Swedish country- and cityside, focus not only on the whodunit with its police procedural, but tackle very real social issues and problems present in all western societies. While Kenneth Branagh certainly would not have been my imaginary ""ideal"" Wallander persona when I read the novels, I find him an almost perfect choice for the role. His mostly dysfunctional private life, very well captured, mirrors the world of crime in an often dysfunctional society. Whether the camera actually assumes his subjective viewpoint or not, all events appear to be seen through his eyes: with compassion, helpless anger and complex, brooding introspection.

1370249,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B003X82D1A,Happy Reader,"[1, 1]","This TV series, as with the books they're based on, will not be everybody's cup of tea. They are unrelentingly dour and humorless. They are well plotted and fabulously acted, but even the cinematography seems to have a blue cast that adds to the bleakness. Kenneth Branagh is magnificent throughout. What an actor!I've only read two Kurt Wallander mysteries, written by Henning Mankell and set in Skane, Southern Sweden. The two I've read are ""Faceless Killers"" (published 1991 in Sweden), the first in the series, and ""The Troubled Man"" (published 2009 in Sweden), the last in the series. Kurt is a police detective. He's a good detective, though he's so intense and focused that he can be hard on witnesses, his co-workers, his family, and most of all, on himself.This is the 2nd season of Kenneth Branagh's ""Wallender"", which originally aired in 2010: episodes ""Faceless Killers"", ""The Man Who Smiled"" and ""The Fifth Woman"". The 1st season is also available on DVD, which originally aired in 2008: episodes ""Sidetracked"", ""Firewall"" and ""One Step Behind"". All of the screenplays, for both sets, are based on Mankell's books by the same names.I think both TV series do an excellent job of capturing the books' Wallander. He is moderately unkempt; recently divorced but still wearing his wedding ring. He works horrific hours and has trouble sleeping at night on top of it. He sees society's underbelly on a daily basis and it has left his emotions alternately strangled and unavailable or else spewing volcanically. His relationship with his daughter is actually better in the TV series than in the books. And he is more nominally likeable in the TV series than he is in the two books I've read.There are currently plans for a 3rd TV series, and screenwriters have been commissioned. Apparently, three of the episodes will be original screenplays, not based on a Wallander book. If the series keeps going, they'll have to do so. Mankell has only written 13 Wallander novels (one, a prequel, is set pre-""Faceless Killers"").I very much enjoyed watching this series, and the 1st series, too. A purist may not appreciate a Swedish series filmed in Skane, but populated 100% by English speaking characters, but it was OK with me.

Indeed, it avoids almost all of the flaws that seem to plague even the most popular television shows of that genre.Perhaps that's because the stories are adapted directly from Henning Mankell's novels, rather than being ground out by a television writer fighting a deadline.Kurt Wallander (Kenneth Branagh) is an overworked Swedish police detective in the small, backwater town of Ystad.  He is divorced from his wife, his artist father (David Warner) is in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and Wallander himself suffers from diabetes.  Aside from his work, the only meaningful relationship that he has in his life is with his grown daughter, which runs hot-and-cold.Like with most mystery writers, Mankell's stories have a formula, but his is a formula that is not easy to second- guess.  In each of these three new movies, Wallander is confronted with initially seemingly unrelated crimes, which as the investigations proceed, actually turn out to be tied together.In FACELESS KILLERS, for example, the murder of an elderly couple in their farmhouse results in an outbreak of racial violence.In THE MAN WHO SMILED, the detective is asked by an old friend to investigate the mysterious death of his father, then a week later, the friend turns up dead.THE FIFTH WOMAN opens with the brutal murder of an elderly birdwatcher, the first of many of a clever serial killer.Wearing a three-day beard, Branagh delivers a superb portrayal of the emotionally distressed detective.  The supporting casts, none of which (with the exception of David Warner) are familiar to this writer, are also fine.The three movies for this second season are well-paced and play more like good theatrical films, rather than something made to be seen on television.The 2-disc set from BBC Video contains a pair of ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.

1370278,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B003X82D1A,mirasreviews,"[50, 53]","I enjoyed Wallander Series 2 more than the first series, as at least some of the mysteries do not defy all credibility. Based on the Swedish crime novels of Henning Mankel, this trio of mysteries grows more sensational as it progresses, but the unbelievable bits creep up on the viewer instead of being outright off-the-wall. As is often the case, Mankel has entwined social issues with his murders: anti-immigration sentiment, trafficking in human organs, and domestic abuse. Dave Shiflett of Bloomberg aptly described Kurt Wallander as ""perhaps the most melancholy man on television"" and Kenneth Branagh's performance as ""majestically morose"". He is an unlikely police officer. Wallander has a strong sense of justice but a hard time coping with life in general, much less with the brutality with which he job brings him into constant contact. He's never in a stable state of mind.The Wallander series is also set apart from most television cop dramas by Wallander's lack of relationship with his colleagues. Fellow detectives Anne-Brit Hoglund (Sarah Smart), Magnus Martinsson (Tom Hiddleston), and pathologist Nyberg (Richard McCabe) are always there, making helpful contributions, but Wallander has no personal relationship with them and barely a professional one. They're just part of the landscape. This is more in the mold of noir fiction, which focuses on the protagonist's angst and how he is acted upon by the world around him. But Wallander's crises are emotional, not existential. He processes everything on an emotional level, to the extent that he seems always to fail his needy daughter and father, the people with whom he is most preoccupied. There are three 90-minute episodes:An elderly couple are murdered in their farmhouse by someone apparently looking  for hidden money in ""Faceless Killers"". Wallander thinks the dying woman may have whispered ""foreigner"" -or was it ""farmer""? He couldn't make it out, but the ""foreigner"" angle is leaked to the press and inspires vigilante action against a local community of migrant workers. Wallander thinks things will settle down if he finds the couple's killers. He and partner Hoglund (Sarah Smart) hope to uncover some clues in the victim's former mistress and illegitimate son. Meanwhile, Wallander must cope with his father's deteriorating condition and his daughter's new boyfriend. This mystery is especially good, because it is not overwrought, and the culprits commit plausible crimes with plausible motives.""The Man Who Smiled"" finds Wallander on leave and planning to resign following the events of the previous episode. An old friend, Sten Torstensson (David Sibley) asks Wallander to look into the odd circumstances surrounding the recent death of his father Gustave in an auto accident. But, by the time Wallander gets around to it, Sten is himself dead, supposedly a suicide. Wallander feels guilty and begs to go back to work, but he has become dependent on tranquilizers and struggles with withdrawal. And his colleague Magnus (Tom Hiddleston) resents Wallander's intrusion into the case. The Torstenssons were solicitors to a wealthy philanthropist named Alfred Harderberg (Rupert Graves), who received a similar death threat, so the detectives begin there inquiry there.An elderly birdwatcher is found gruesomely murdered in ""The Fifth Woman"", the first in a series of torture-murders that have no obvious connection. When a missing florist is found murdered, then a late-night jogger, it becomes clear that Wallander and his colleagues are dealing with a serial killer who targets financially successful men with a history of bullying women. But that leaves a long list of potential suspects and difficulty in determining who might be the next victim. Wallander, meanwhile, is becoming fond of the second victim's forlorn business manager, Vanja Andersson (Saskia Reeves), a potential suspect, while he deals with the usual family dramas that leave him barely fit for work. This is the most sensational of the episodes, and its social agenda seems overstated.",4,"Branagh Gives Strong Performance in These Dark, Emotive Swedish Mysteries.",1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,4041,"['enjoyed', 'Wallander', 'Series', '2', 'more', 'first', 'series', 'least', 'mysteries', 'do', 'not', 'defy', 'credibility', 'Based', 'Swedish', 'crime', 'novels', 'Henning', 'Mankel', 'trio', 'mysteries', 'more', 'sensational', 'unbelievable', 'bits', 'creep', 'up', 'viewer', 'instead', 'being', 'outright', 'off-the-wall', 'often', 'case', 'Mankel', 'entwined', 'social', 'issues', 'murders', 'anti-immigration', 'sentiment', 'trafficking', 'human', 'organs', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'Dave', 'Shiflett', 'Bloomberg', 'aptly', 'described', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'perhaps', 'most', 'melancholy', 'man', 'television', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'performance', 'majestically', 'morose', 'unlikely', 'police', 'officer', 'Wallander', 'strong', 'sense', 'justice', 'hard', 'time', 'coping', 'life', 'general', 'much', 'less', 'brutality', 'job', 'constant', 'contact', 'never', 'stable', 'state', 'mind.The', 'Wallander', 'series', 'also', 'set', 'apart', 'most', 'television', 'cop', 'dramas', 'Wallander', 'lack', 'relationship', 'colleagues', 'Fellow', 'Anne-Brit', 'Hoglund', 'Sarah', 'Smart', 'Magnus', 'Martinsson', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'pathologist', 'Nyberg', 'Richard', 'McCabe', 'are', 'always', 'there', 'making', 'helpful', 'contributions', 'Wallander', 'personal', 'relationship', 'barely', 'professional', 'one', ""'re"", 'just', 'part', 'landscape', 'more', 'mold', 'noir', 'fiction', 'protagonist', 'angst', 'how', 'acted', 'world', 'Wallander', 'crises', 'are', 'emotional', 'not', 'existential', 'everything', 'emotional', 'level', 'extent', 'always', 'fail', 'needy', 'daughter', 'father', 'people', 'whom', 'most', 'preoccupied', 'are', 'three', '90-minute', 'episodes', 'elderly', 'couple', 'are', 'murdered', 'farmhouse', 'someone', 'apparently', 'looking', 'hidden', 'money', 'Faceless', 'Killers', 'Wallander', 'dying', 'woman', 'may', 'have', 'whispered', 'foreigner', '-or', 'was', 'farmer', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'out', 'foreigner', 'angle', 'leaked', 'press', 'inspires', 'vigilante', 'action', 'local', 'community', 'migrant', 'workers', 'Wallander', 'things', 'will', 'settle', 'down', 'couple', 'killers', 'partner', 'Hoglund', 'Sarah', 'Smart', 'hope', 'uncover', 'clues', 'victim', 'former', 'mistress', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Meanwhile', 'Wallander', 'must', 'cope', 'father', 'deteriorating', 'condition', 'daughter', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'mystery', 'especially', 'good', 'not', 'overwrought', 'culprits', 'commit', 'plausible', 'crimes', 'plausible', 'motives', 'Man', 'Who', 'Smiled', 'Wallander', 'leave', 'planning', 'resign', 'following', 'events', 'previous', 'episode', 'old', 'friend', 'Sten', 'Torstensson', 'David', 'Sibley', 'Wallander', 'look', 'odd', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'recent', 'death', 'father', 'Gustave', 'auto', 'accident', 'time', 'Wallander', 'around', 'Sten', 'dead', 'supposedly', 'suicide', 'Wallander', 'feels', 'guilty', 'begs', 'go', 'back', 'work', 'become', 'dependent', 'tranquilizers', 'struggles', 'withdrawal', 'colleague', 'Magnus', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Wallander', 'intrusion', 'case', 'Torstenssons', 'were', 'solicitors', 'wealthy', 'philanthropist', 'named', 'Alfred', 'Harderberg', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'who', 'received', 'similar', 'death', 'threat', 'detectives', 'begin', 'there', 'inquiry', 'there.An', 'elderly', 'birdwatcher', 'found', 'gruesomely', 'murdered', 'Fifth', 'Woman', 'first', 'series', 'torture-murders', 'have', 'obvious', 'connection', 'When', 'missing', 'florist', 'found', 'murdered', 'then', 'late-night', 'jogger', 'clear', 'Wallander', 'colleagues', 'are', 'dealing', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'financially', 'successful', 'men', 'history', 'bullying', 'women', 'long', 'list', 'potential', 'suspects', 'difficulty', 'determining', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'next', 'victim', 'Wallander', 'meanwhile', 'becoming', 'fond', 'second', 'victim', 'forlorn', 'business', 'manager', 'Vanja', 'Andersson', 'Saskia', 'Reeves', 'potential', 'suspect', 'usual', 'family', 'dramas', 'leave', 'barely', 'fit', 'work', 'most', 'sensational', 'episodes', 'social', 'agenda', 'overstated']",N/A
1370279,A2QUX0WLXLMHDV,B003X82D1A,Mr. Scott T. Allen,"[3, 11]","The other ""2 Star"" reviews here are correct so I'll say a few things they don't.  First, Branagh is the only actor worth watching.  The rest are cardboard cutouts.  Second, the mysteries really aren't the focus of the plots, instead the story lines involve everyone else giving Wallander crap about details of his personal life, professionalism, etc. and he just lamely takes it.  If it is faithful to the novels, fine, but all episodes feature (a) someone dies, (b) Wallander shows up clueless, (c) Wallander takes crap about his personal life or professionalism, (d) Wallander seems to investigate further as an ""escape"" more than anything else, (e) Wallander takes more crap, and (e) through an accident or two the perpetrator practically gives him/herself up.  Third, this series doesn't stand for anything.  That is, there is no real projection of good or goodness, just bad (typically the evil white man) and people piddling their time away in depressing diversions.  In toto, I find myself wishing that every single character we see just dies.

For Wallander nothing else in his life is more important than solving a crime. However, his ability to be great at his job costs him personally and you cannot help but feel for Branagh when you see how much these cases have affected him physically as well as emotionally.  I swear Branagh does more acting with his eyes then most other actors can do when using their entire bodies and it's impossible to look away when he is on the screen.Series two also stars, Sarah Smart as Anne-Britt Hoglund, Tom Hiddleston as Magnus Martinsson, Richard McCabe as Nyberg, Tom Beard as Svedberg, Sadie Shimmin as Lisa Holgersson, Jeany Spark as Linda Wallander (Kurt's daughter), David Warner as Povel Wallander (Kurt's father), and Saskia Reeves as Vanja Andersson.Filmed in 2010 series two consists of the following episodes:""Faceless Killers"" Wallander investigates the murders of an elderly couple living in a remote part of the country.  Due to Wallander believing that one of the victims' dying words was ""foreigners"" when asked who attacked her it causes repercussions in Ystad with racial fighting between groups. Wallander gets to the bottom of who was behind the killings while trying to navigate the professional quagmire he is in.(5 stars)""The Man Who Smiled"" Wallander still reeling from the events in ""Faceless Killers"" has been hiding away from his family and friends for months. When a friend contacts him with help trying to prove this father was murdered it leads Wallander back to Ystad and him trying to make amends with those who left behind. (5 stars)""The Fifth Woman"" Wallander investigates when an old man falls to his death and it becomes apparent he was murdered. Another man is missing and quickly the two cases become entwined.  Wallander finds himself for the first time in years to begin to care for another woman. 4 starsI found episodes one and two so very good that I was very let down by the last episode, ""The Fifth Woman"". I think perhaps it was because at times Wallandar is such a contradiction. He wants to reach out to people but often turns them away and then acts surprised when people stop trying to get close to him. I really did love ""Faceless Killers"" and watching the fallout of those events impact him in ""The Man Who Smiled."" I did find series two to be much darker than series one if that is possible though I did love the end of the Fifth Woman since it seemed that finally there could be a happy ending for our dour detective in the future.Please note that I was able to view this entire series for free due to Amazon Instant Video.",5,Just Gets Better and Better (4.5 Stars),1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,2856,"['watching', 'falling', 'love', 'series', 'one', 'Wallander', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'quickly', 'watched', 'episodes', '1', '3', 'series', 'two', 'engaging', 'show.This', 'series', 'stars', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'Swedish', 'detective', 'inspector', 'living', 'working', 'Ystad', 'Sweden', 'Wallander', 'nothing', 'else', 'life', 'more', 'important', 'solving', 'crime', 'However', 'ability', 'be', 'great', 'job', 'costs', 'personally', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'Branagh', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'cases', 'have', 'affected', 'physically', 'as', 'well', 'emotionally', 'swear', 'Branagh', 'more', 'acting', 'eyes', 'then', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'using', 'entire', 'bodies', 'impossible', 'look', 'away', 'when', 'screen.Series', 'two', 'also', 'stars', 'Sarah', 'Smart', 'Anne-Britt', 'Hoglund', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Magnus', 'Martinsson', 'Richard', 'McCabe', 'Nyberg', 'Tom', 'Beard', 'Svedberg', 'Sadie', 'Shimmin', 'Lisa', 'Holgersson', 'Jeany', 'Spark', 'Linda', 'Wallander', 'Kurt', 'daughter', 'David', 'Warner', 'Povel', 'Wallander', 'Kurt', 'father', 'Saskia', 'Reeves', 'Vanja', 'Andersson.Filmed', '2010', 'series', 'two', 'consists', 'following', 'episodes', 'Faceless', 'Killers', 'Wallander', 'murders', 'elderly', 'couple', 'living', 'remote', 'part', 'country', 'Due', 'Wallander', 'believing', 'one', 'victims', 'dying', 'words', 'was', 'foreigners', 'when', 'asked', 'who', 'attacked', 'repercussions', 'Ystad', 'racial', 'fighting', 'groups', 'Wallander', 'bottom', 'who', 'was', 'killings', 'trying', 'navigate', 'professional', 'quagmire', '5', 'stars', 'Man', 'Who', 'Smiled', 'Wallander', 'still', 'reeling', 'events', 'Faceless', 'Killers', 'been', 'hiding', 'away', 'family', 'friends', 'months', 'When', 'friend', 'help', 'trying', 'prove', 'father', 'was', 'murdered', 'Wallander', 'back', 'Ystad', 'trying', 'make', 'amends', 'who', 'left', 'behind', '5', 'stars', 'Fifth', 'Woman', 'Wallander', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'death', 'apparent', 'was', 'murdered', 'man', 'missing', 'quickly', 'two', 'cases', 'become', 'entwined', 'Wallander', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'begin', 'care', 'woman', '4', 'starsI', 'found', 'one', 'two', 'so', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'very', 'let', 'down', 'last', 'episode', 'Fifth', 'Woman', 'think', 'perhaps', 'was', 'because', 'times', 'Wallandar', 'such', 'contradiction', 'reach', 'out', 'people', 'often', 'away', 'then', 'acts', 'surprised', 'when', 'people', 'stop', 'trying', 'get', 'close', 'really', 'did', 'love', 'Faceless', 'Killers', 'watching', 'fallout', 'events', 'impact', 'Man', 'Who', 'Smiled', 'did', 'find', 'series', 'two', 'be', 'much', 'darker', 'series', 'one', 'possible', 'did', 'love', 'end', 'Fifth', 'Woman', 'seemed', 'finally', 'could', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'dour', 'detective', 'future.Please', 'note', 'was', 'able', 'view', 'entire', 'series', 'free', 'due', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video']",N/A

Another reviewer felt the series was depressing and so on.  Thankfully, in America, so far, everyone is entitled to their opinion, unless you are not politically correct.The cast is outstanding and we felt that both season 1 and 2 have been excellent.  For us, spell binding.  I cannot disagree that they are dark, but that is what they are and if that is not your thing don't watch them.  They are not Nanny McPhee. These stories are heavy.  We totally disagree that the characters are not well developed.  Each episode is approximately 90 minutes long and there are quite a number of characters.  How much can you do in 90 minutes?  There is no way to develop every character like a book can.  For those that can take some nasty, gruesome violence with some seedy characters, suspense and shot in a gloomy environment give this series a try.
