1509046,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0063E00FC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[23, 24]","Among Koji Wakamatsu's films, ""Caterpillar"" is no doubt his best film yet.  Unsettling but yet managing to retain the political message that Wakamatsu incorporates in his films.For those who are familiar with Koji Wakamatsu's oeuvre and have looked at the filmmaker's history, you will know that he is well-known for his pink movie films of the '60s and '70s and his contribution to the ""Pink Eiga"" genre.  To also know that he was a producer of Nagisa Oshima's controversial film ""In the Realm of Senses"" (1976) and similar to Oshima, willing to take on films that are not traditional style of storytelling in Japan and are known to have an edge.But similar to Nagisa Oshima, Wakamatsu is also a rebel.  In 2008, his film ""United Red Army"" was a docudrama on the tragedy of the Japanese radical left and America and in 2011, he began working on another political film based on the acclaimed novelist and political activist Yukio Mishima titled ""1.25 Jiketsu No Hi, Mishima Yukio To Wakamonotachi"" (11.25 the Day of Self Determination, Yukio Mishima and the Youth).But if you explore Wakamatsu's work, you will realize that aside from his political films, he was known to create very low-budget films in his career that showcased sex and violence with political messages.And in 2010, his film ""Caterpillar"" was screened and also competed for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival and earned actress Shinobu Terajim the Silver Bear Award for ""Best Actress"" at the 2010 Berlin Film Festival.The film also received critical praise from critics and deemed as Wakamatsu's ""masterpiece"".And now both ""Caterpillar"" and his docudrama ""United Red Army"" will be released in the United States on DVD courtesy of Kino Lorber Inc.""Caterpillar"" is an unnerving film that is set during the Second Sino-Japanese War and also World War II.The film begins with three Chinese women trying to escape from Japanese soldiers.  The women were raped and killed.  The soldier who raped and killed a woman was Tadashi Kurokawa (played by Keigo Kasuya).The story then showcases the arrival of Tadashi Kurokawa to his home.  Being hailed as a war hero who fought for the Emperor and his country, the villagers celebrate his arrival.And as his wife Shigeko and his family await for Tadashi arrive, they are absolutely shocked to see the condition that Tadashi is in.Tadashi no longer has legs, no longer has arms and hands and part of his face is badly burned and scarred. He is also a mute and the only thing he has to show for his bravery is the three medals on his chest.His father is shocked that the military would return Tadashi in such a condition since he can't work, he can't talk and possibly can't hear.  But because Japanese honor their war heroes, the family including the villagers expect his wife Shigeko to take care of the war hero.Shigeko is shocked at the sight of her husband. She can't believe that the military kept him alive in such a state and she is absolute repelled by how he looks.  At first, tries to kill him by strangling him, but she can't.Immediately, Tadashi tries to communicate with Shigeko and what he wants is to have sex.  And because it's her duty as a wife to take care of the village's ""war hero"", she knows she must make him happy as part of her service to the country of Japan and the Emperor.And the routine becomes daily as Tadashi continues to want sex all the time.  All he can do is eat, sleep and have sex and it begins to have its toll on Shigeko as she has to do all the work to make ends meet, having to feed him and not having enough food for herself and then having to have sex with a man that can't really do anything but move like a ""caterpillar"".VIDEO & AUDIO:""Caterpillar"" is presented in 169 (1:85:1 aspect ratio) and Japanese stereo 2.0 with English subtitles.It's important to note that Wakamatsu films were not big-budget films.  They were low-budget back in the '60s and he continues that trend today.  And with ""Caterpillar"", similar to ""United Red Army"", you have the primary film footage but also archived footage from World War II.  So, the quality does vary but in the case of ""Caterpillar"", the historical videos are used for the end to showcase Japan's loss to America by showing the viewer the dead bodies after Japan was bombed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.But for the most part, picture quality is good.  I detected no major artifacts or damage, if anything, this film sounds good on DVD.  Dialogue was understandable and subtitles were easy to read.  Although, I will say that I was a bit surprised at the choice of subtitle fonts, instead of the helvetica or the usual sans-seriff fonts, something that looked like comic sans was used.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Caterpillar"" comes with trailers, no commentary or featurettes.JUDGMENT CALL:""Caterpillar"" was an unnerving and a unique film from Koji Wakamatsu.And in some ways, the film similar to Wakamatsu's previous films, to show the absurdity of Japan's militarism and propaganda.We watch as the village that the Kurokawa's live in are dedicated to their country and the Emperor and celebrations for the young men of the village going to war is respected.  The older men of the village wear their old war uniforms, the women learn how to attack dummies with a spear and through this celebration of Japanese military with men and women clad in white, standing around is one man in red robe constantly picking his nose.You can't help but laugh and be intrigued by Wakamatsu's humor employed in his films.  You know there is a message but how far would he go?In some way, ""Caterpillar"" is a film that embodies Wakamatsu's career.  It has the sex, the violence and the political message questioning Japan's past.The character of Shigeko is wonderfully performed by Shinobu Terajima and the character continues to wonder if by pleasing her husband who has nothing but his torso and a constant hard-on is her service to Japan.  And we start to see her emotional breakdown because her husband is reduced to a man that only sleeps, eats and wants to have sex all the time.Her villagers remind her of the amazing service for Japan's military and are often feed propaganda of Japan winning the war.  And so, she continues trying to work to survive, parading her husband to remind everyone of their service and to respect their war heroes and to give him pleasure when he asks for it.The film is unsettling for its earlier scene of the rape and disemboweling of Chinese women.  There are still people in Japan who refuse to believe that Japan had committed atrocities to the Chinese (especially in Nanjing) but Wakamatsu's opening is to show that not only did it happen, karma also came back with full force on Tadashi.  But also letting everyone know that all those soldiers were also executed for their war crime which they fought for the name of Japan and their Emperor.Overall, ""Caterpillar"" is no doubt the best Wakamatsu film I have seen by far and while there are those who criticized the film for looking low-budget, that is how Wakamatsu's films have been since the '60s.  Low-budget but yet he has managed to entertain generations through his nontraditional ways of storytelling and filmmaking.  Also, The performance by Shinobu Terajima as the wife, Shigeko Kurokawa was magnificent.I don't think there is any film that can compare to ""Caterpillar"" and for anyone wanting to experience something different in Japanese cinema will no doubt want to check out this Koji Wakamatsu film!Recommended!",4,"If you are familiar with Koji Wakamatsu's films and his career, you'll love the

1509047,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,B0063E00FC,Dwight,"[0, 0]","Well, I had my doubts that it could be well-meant when the film opens with rapes of Chinese women by Japanese trespassers.  If the Japanese are making this movie, brace yourself.So don't let that seeming disrespect for authority I.e. The 1960s era japanese cinema trope of anti-rah rah rah culture of invading China et al,  distract and camouflage from the simple message to its own demographic.  True, this movie is propaganda aimed at the outside non-Axis world but it is also an instruction directed at its own people on how to respond anew to the ongoing broaching of the issue of Japanese conduct.It's interesting after all the forced incest rapes, the forced auto cannibalism, the mutilations such as of our dancers and acrobats specifically the removal of their expressive limbs how are the japanese going to explain away the distinctive extremeness of their sadism and hatred of total strangers.Well, let the filmmaker explain:You see, they come from backwaters where the insensitive farmers mindlessly call the delimbed wounded a ""god"" when he is absolutely miserable.Because unlike my family who would be glad to have our lost returned to us even in such a condition - because you can still hug him if he lives, that baint the reaction to his return by his childless wife.  So ... Not true love maybe not even love at all and how can that end well?So whatever their marriage story is, the movie ends with footage of the invasion of Okinawa, the numbers killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, then hirohito's radio announcement of surrender.  Followed by warning to the Aklies in text form beginning with ""They fought for their country and were hanged for it.""  Referring to the war criminals and then statistics of numbers killed are given ending with the words ""according to records.""Get it?  Japan paid it's dues merely by failing to achieve its ambitions and not recouping it's expenditures including that of arms and legs of the title character, that not everyone enters the twilight years with deep sleep euphoria of the everlasting dream come true memories of that irreplaceable feeling of raping every man woman and child in that unapproachable envied resented China within grasp.  Such a bacchanalia of evil and violence unprecedented and unmatched with no reprisal, no penalty except the clean up required of those clumsy Allied accusers directionless in their dismay of sensing Scott-free state of the perpetrators.  The hum of being purely and completely satisfied for the one and only time in one's life is denied in this new film with the claim that the fictional title character has nightmares about committing multiple rapes of Chinese females a la ""this hurts me more than it hurts you.""Tiresome.If you look at the wacktastic japanese oeuvres of the 1960s, take note of how they all obliquely respond to the atrocities known by others to have been committed by Japan.  It's all about responding without acknowledging their deserved reputation.What is very important about who the director is is that this is that old guard when the war was just a decade and a half ago and now that they had gotten a look at those open faced fair play Americans believed themselves ready to corrupt their vanquishers by repackaging their atrocities as illicit porn with the ugliness and violence included possibly to claim as if hey, this is just our hairy crab nature.  Don't hold it against us because it will distract you from our willingness to participate in pornography.  Enjoy yourselves into a stupor while we rearm.So this guy is known for gross ugly porn and he's an art house commodity.  Why is this important?  Because at that level when they insist in having their rashomon say, you can grab them with their personal touch and war connection in these films.  It becomes more disguised in later years even with fascist perspectives in their pornographic cartoons which Anthony Bourdain has spotlighted in his CNN episode on Japan.The reason he matters and is something of a smoking gun is that all postwar pornography and fetish from japan is about denying presence of mind during the FILMED atrocities.  They made snuff films both of their comfort women dinner parties and the home invasions especially of the wealthier Chinese extended families more elaborate than the Blue Pool Road and St. Stephens College massacres prior to the British surrender of Hong Kong.Hirohito designed the tortures for years with his coterie and there is a tube video of Iris Chang referencing the family project nature of their war against China.  How could hirohito be denied such splendid sights and sounds?  Oh, the variations in the wails, the unbound weeping of totally destroyed Chinese snobs.  Droit du voyeur as it were.How could there ever be survivor testimony that the PRINCES of Japan oversaw the shipments of anything other than inanimate objet d'arts to the palace in Tokyo?I very much object to the disrespectful refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing in the way that the atomic bombings were mentioned at the end of this movie indicating that the audience was subjected to more than an hour of propaganda about Japan is also a victim so they get to deny our right to point out their villainy by fake admitting when really they are playing victim:""The round-ups of foreigners began on 5 November 1942 when the Kempeitai launched early morning raids, arresting 243 Britons, 65 Americans, 20 Dutch, and some other foreign nationals, totalling 350 men in all. Labelled `Prominent Citizens', they were hauled off to Haiphong Road Camp, run by the Imperial Japanese Army. `The Japanese were showing their teeth,' recalled arrested British reporter Ralph Shaw, `and, from their record of cruelty in China, we knew that many of us were going to suffer indescribable ill-treatment.'Bridge House, a large white apartment block just across Garden Bridge, became the main Kempeitai interrogation centre, and by February 1942 the Japanese had arrested many foreign journalists, businessmen, and police officers. Some were held for months; beaten, whipped, given the water torture, electrocuted, and starved.The Japanese subjected American reporter John B Powell to `atrocious assaults, beating him unmercifully,' recalled Shaw. H G W Woodhead, outspoken British editor of Oriental Affairs, who had attacked the Japanese for their earlier outrages in China, almost died. Sir Frederick Maze, former inspector-general of Chinese Customs was tortured for four weeks before being released without charge. Anyone even remotely suspected of being `anti-Japanese' was arrested and tortured. Fear of a knock on the door in the middle of the night was literal.""So finally knowing what they do to reporters when they decloak, we can't go to war with Japan because James Fallows with Yushukan and Nicolas Kristof have already pissed them off.  No wonder everyone is so careful around Japan.  I previously wondered why everyone was so lame not realizing that James Fallows honest coverage of Yushukan and Nicolas Kristof in general were terribly risky for them.HONG KONG ATROCITIESA True Christmas StoryChristmas Day - Hong Kong - 1941On Christmas Eve Japanese officers were instructed by their Commander, Lt. General Sakai Takashi, having received personal instructions through Prince Asaka (responsible for the rape of Nanking), to strike terror into the military and civilian population. The orders came from Emperor Hirohito, through the Emperor's uncle, Prince Asaka.During Christmas morning lone survivors from overrun British outposts were released to bring this message to General Maltby's attention, and to tell how their comrades had all been killed. By the afternoon Maltby could see that his forces were breaking up into pockets which the Japanese would be able to annihilate at leisure. With the approval of Governor Mark Young, General Maltby decided to capitulate. Early in the morning of Christmas day the Japanese captured St Stephen's Coll-ege outside the walls of Fort Stanley. On its premises, on the orders of General Sakai, they began their occupation of the hos-pital. On their arrival at the Ed Cross hospital, and without one word of peace-parlay, they immediately shot and bayoneted the two Medical Officers, Dr George Black and Captain Whitney of the Royal Army Medical Corps. Captain Whitney had been walking towards the Japanese Officer in charge and was carrying a white flag plus a Red Cross flag, they were still wearing their white hospital clothing and Red Cross armbands. The Japanese entered the hospital, and amid the screaming, they ripped off bandages and field dressings from the wounded. They then proceeded to bayonet 60 of the 90 severely wounded laying helpless in their beds, one young Chinese nurse was bayoneted along with her patient when she tried to protect him.Later, four Chinese and seven British nurses were put in one room, about one hundred orderlies, doctors and stretcher bearers were herded into another room. During the afternoon the male captives were taken out, two or three at a time, and were dismembered limb from limb. They chopped off fingers, sliced off ears, cut out tongues, and stabbed out eyes before they killed them, some were allowed to escape in order to tell the Fort Stanley defenders what was happening. In the other room the nurses were screaming, they were tied down on beds of corpses on which they were raped.At some time in the evening the four Chinese nurses and then the three youngest of the English nurses were put to death by bayoneting. About then negotiations with the defenders at Fort Stanley began to progress, the last four of the elder British nurses were locked in a room and left alone. During the night Fort Stanley surrendered, and in the morning British prisoners were brought into the hospital to clean up. It was then that they released the four surviving, gibbering nurses. The people cleaning up waded in blood as they gathered the corpses from the execution room to prepare them for burial. They carried away an hysterical British Lieutenant who was the husband of one of the three British nurses who had been abused and then killed. For the first of the Allied war captives, the years of imprisonment had begun, and for some of the surviving nurses, years of brothel duty for Japanese soldiers began.Sadly this is not the end of the horror Christmas Story, there were other hospitals, and a Convent, involved in similar attrocities by the Japanese invaders. i.e. Silerian Mission: The Ridge at Wong Nei Chong Gap: Eucliffe Castle: Repulse Bay and the Jockey Club at Happy Valley.A letter from George H.

Banzai!"", the neatly framed portraits of the Emperor and Empress displayed next to the newspaper clipping and the hero's three war medals, the quadriplegic veteran forever lying behind the screen, routinely fed, cleansed and serviced by his wife (deftly played by Shinobu Terajima, for which she was named best actress at the Berlin International Film Festival). But the most indelible image is that of the ""caterpillar"" dressed up in coat, medals and hat, who is paraded around as the ""War God"" in a garden cart. This must be the most absurd yet dramatically charged image of insanity, group insanity, as villagers bow and officers salute. The ""War God"" is indeed a hell-being and within this mutilated man's mind we catch glimpses of horrors in repeated flashbacks.

1509057,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0063E00FC,Paul Allaer,"[3, 3]","""Caterpillar"" (2010 release from Japan; 85 min.) brings the story of a Japanese soldier who, after rampaging in the Sino-Japanese war, returns home severely disabled (he has lost both arms and legs, and is deaf and mute) but with honor. He gets multiple medals and is nicknamed ""the War God"". It is up to his wife to take care of the War God, and given his condition, that becomes an almost non-stop job. Along the way we see how the War God relearns how to express his feelings and desires. As the movie unfolds, the wife starts to question the supposed honor behind all of this, all for the greater glory oo the Empire and the Emperor.To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all unfolds.Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is a blistering indictment against not just the absurdity of war itself, but in particular of the prevailing nationalistic mood that existed in Japan in the 1930-40s. Men are going off to war, to the applause of the entire village, promising ""to die for country and the Emperor"". Second, this movie contains a lot of graphic scenes, not only of the war, but also of domestic scenes betwee the disabled war veteran and his wife, and it makes for uneasy watching at time (and certainly not for the faint of heart). I couldn't help but think back how differently this movie approches sex for the disables as compared to the recent US release ""The Sessions"". Last but certainly not least, the acting performances of both leading performers are nothing short of astonishing and sensational.At the very end of the movie, we hear the Emperor of Japan annouce on the radio that ""given the current conditions"", he has ordered his government to surrender. I couldn't help but shake my head. All the suffering and deaths for this? ""Caterpillar"" is obviously MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, but if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that tackles some tough topics, I would readily recommend ""Caterpillar"".",4,Honor before all... the absurdity of war,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,2027,"['Caterpillar', '2010', 'release', 'Japan', '85', 'min', 'story', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'who', 'rampaging', 'Sino-Japanese', 'war', 'home', 'severely', 'disabled', 'lost', 'arms', 'legs', 'deaf', 'mute', 'honor', 'multiple', 'medals', 'nicknamed', 'War', 'God', 'up', 'wife', 'take', 'care', 'War', 'God', 'given', 'condition', 'almost', 'non-stop', 'job', 'way', 'see', 'how', 'War', 'God', 'how', 'express', 'feelings', 'desires', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'wife', 'question', 'supposed', 'honor', 'greater', 'glory', 'Empire', 'Emperor.To', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'unfolds.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'movie', 'blistering', 'indictment', 'not', 'just', 'absurdity', 'war', 'particular', 'prevailing', 'nationalistic', 'mood', 'existed', 'Japan', '1930-40s', 'Men', 'are', 'going', 'war', 'applause', 'entire', 'village', 'promising', 'die', 'country', 'Emperor', 'Second', 'movie', 'lot', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'not', 'only', 'war', 'also', 'domestic', 'scenes', 'betwee', 'disabled', 'war', 'veteran', 'wife', 'uneasy', 'watching', 'time', 'certainly', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'back', 'how', 'differently', 'movie', 'sex', 'disables', 'compared', 'recent', 'US', 'release', 'Sessions', 'Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'acting', 'performances', 'leading', 'performers', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'astonishing', 'sensational.At', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'hear', 'Emperor', 'Japan', 'annouce', 'radio', 'given', 'current', 'conditions', 'ordered', 'government', 'surrender', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'shake', 'head', 'suffering', 'deaths', 'Caterpillar', 'obviously', 'MILES', 'away', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'are', 'mood', 'quality', 'foreign', 'movie', 'tough', 'topics', 'would', 'readily', 'recommend', 'Caterpillar']",Caterpillar

Director Wakamatsu Koji made the film in response to the re-release of Mishima Yukio's militaristic right-wing movie Patriotism, showing the harsh reality of Japan's military cult of WWII.Nominally based off of Edogawa Rampo's banned short story of the same name (Found inJapanese Tales of Mystery & Imagination),  ""Caterpillar"" shares only the briefest of association with Rampo's tale.  Wakamatsu changed the setting from the Russo-Sino war (where Japan was the victor) to WWII, and swapped the aggressive roles of the husband and wife.The caterpillar of the title is Kurokawa Tadashi (Katsuya Keigo), who marched bravely off to war and returned a living torso, lacking arms, legs, hearing or speech.  His neighborhood honors him as a living God of Soldiers, but his wife Shigeko (Terajima Shinobu) knows a different side of Kurokawa.  Lacking anything else, Kurokawa has been reduced to a being of sensations.  He eats. He sleeps.  And he wants sex.  All the time.  Shigeko endures as a good wife should, but her hatred of her caterpillar husband overtakes her.  To humiliate him, she dresses him in his uniform and hauls him through town in a horse cart, so that everyone can pay homage to the God of Soldiers.Wakamatsu allows no glory to be shown in war.  In Rampo's story, the caterpillar sustains his injuries in combat, but in ""Caterpillar"" it is heavily implied that Kurokawa was injured while raping and killing Chinese farm girls in a burning building.  Kurokawa is a decorated war hero, but his behavior mocks and degrades his commendations.  His wife Shigeko shows the face of a good wife in public, but behind doors we see the suffering she endures.  When Shigeko carts Kurokawa around town as a living idol (reminiscent of Johnny Got His Gun), he is the horror of war personified.I have seen ""Caterpillar"" as described as having ""explicit sex,"" but surprisingly this isn't true, Wakamatsu is an acclaimed Pink Film director, and although he made films likeGo, Go Second Time Virgin, he also has to his credits ""Violated Angels"" and ""Angelic Orgasm.""  With ""Caterpillar,"" even though there a sexual element, there is no nudity or titillation.  All of the sex scenes are shown from a distance, from a side-view, where you can see Kurokawa's limbless body hunching on his wife.""Caterpillar"" is a surprisingly great film; very different from what I was expecting. Terajima Shinobu deserved all of the awards she won in the roll of Shigeko, and director Wakamatsu Koji showed once again that Japan's Pink Film industry is one of the best proving grounds for talented directors.",4,The God of Soldiers,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,3107,"['first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Caterpillar', 'do', 'not', 'promise', 'great', 'movie', 'Shot', 'what', 'digital', 'video', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'burning', 'building', 'look', 'were', 'done', 'someone', 'home', 'computer', 'figured', 'was', 'yet', 'low-budget', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film.I', 'was', 'wrong.Nominated', 'Golden', 'Bear', 'director', 'winner', 'Silver', 'Bear', 'Best', 'actress', 'Berlin', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Caterpillar', 'intense', 'anti-war', 'film', 'heavily', 'political', 'nothing', 'even', 'approaching', 'horror', 'film', 'Director', 'Wakamatsu', 'Koji', 'made', 'film', 'response', 're-release', 'Mishima', 'Yukio', 'militaristic', 'right-wing', 'movie', 'Patriotism', 'showing', 'harsh', 'reality', 'Japan', 'military', 'cult', 'WWII.Nominally', 'based', 'Edogawa', 'Rampo', 'banned', 'short', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'inJapanese', 'Tales', 'Mystery', 'Imagination', 'Caterpillar', 'shares', 'only', 'briefest', 'association', 'Rampo', 'tale', 'Wakamatsu', 'changed', 'setting', 'Russo-Sino', 'war', 'where', 'Japan', 'was', 'victor', 'WWII', 'swapped', 'aggressive', 'roles', 'husband', 'wife.The', 'caterpillar', 'title', 'Kurokawa', 'Tadashi', 'Katsuya', 'Keigo', 'who', 'marched', 'bravely', 'war', 'returned', 'living', 'torso', 'lacking', 'arms', 'legs', 'hearing', 'speech', 'neighborhood', 'honors', 'living', 'God', 'Soldiers', 'wife', 'Shigeko', 'Terajima', 'Shinobu', 'different', 'side', 'Kurokawa', 'Lacking', 'anything', 'else', 'Kurokawa', 'been', 'reduced', 'being', 'sensations', 'sex', 'time', 'Shigeko', 'good', 'wife', 'should', 'hatred', 'caterpillar', 'husband', 'humiliate', 'uniform', 'hauls', 'town', 'horse', 'cart', 'everyone', 'can', 'pay', 'homage', 'God', 'Soldiers.Wakamatsu', 'glory', 'be', 'shown', 'war', 'Rampo', 'story', 'caterpillar', 'injuries', 'combat', 'Caterpillar', 'heavily', 'implied', 'Kurokawa', 'was', 'injured', 'raping', 'killing', 'Chinese', 'farm', 'girls', 'burning', 'building', 'Kurokawa', 'decorated', 'war', 'hero', 'behavior', 'mocks', 'commendations', 'wife', 'Shigeko', 'face', 'good', 'wife', 'public', 'doors', 'see', 'suffering', 'When', 'Shigeko', 'Kurokawa', 'around', 'town', 'living', 'idol', 'reminiscent', 'Johnny', 'Got', 'Gun', 'horror', 'war', 'personified.I', 'have', 'seen', 'Caterpillar', 'as', 'described', 'having', 'explicit', 'sex', 'surprisingly', ""n't"", 'true', 'Wakamatsu', 'acclaimed', 'Pink', 'Film', 'director', 'made', 'films', 'likeGo', 'Go', 'Second', 'Time', 'Virgin', 'also', 'credits', 'Violated', 'Angels', 'Angelic', 'Orgasm', 'Caterpillar', 'even', 'sexual', 'element', 'nudity', 'titillation', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'distance', 'side-view', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'Kurokawa', 'limbless', 'body', 'hunching', 'wife', 'Caterpillar', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'Terajima', 'Shinobu', 'deserved', 'awards', 'won', 'roll', 'Shigeko', 'director', 'Wakamatsu', 'Koji', 'showed', 'once', 'again', 'Japan', 'Pink', 'Film', 'industry', 'one', 'best', 'proving', 'grounds', 'talented', 'directors']",Caterpillar
