My favorite moments are when Martin Short freaks out in the airport and later in the car...thus Martin Short is also my favorite actor in this film, the star, Tim Allen, coming in second.  While some of the culture clashes are clich&eacute;, some are humorous.  As for the jokes, some are admittedly crude, disgusting, and even disturbing, so keep younger kids away from the screen.  Other jokes are funny, like everything Martin Short does and the scene with the sleeping cat...and the reading of the cereal box.  Overall, a good film with some laughs.  I didn't quite get all the talk about stocks and the spider becoming a weapon against enemies made me feel bad for the spider being carried around like that more than anything else.  But I'll let those things go...it's still a good film.

Although this film is funnier, better acted(Tim Allen rocks!), and more entertaining, I didn't feel the boy(Sam Hungington) that played Mimi was born in the jungle at all.  Don't get me wrong, he is a wonderful actor and the girls will love his bod, although he did a great job he didn't come across on film as believable.  In Little Indian Big City the boy was believable.  Sam Huntington spoke as well as a Harvard lawyer and jungle boys don't speak that well since they told us straight out that he couldn't read.This film takes place in New York City.  Little Indian Big City takes place in Paris.  Mimi climbs the Statue of Liberty, pins the neighbors pigeon against the wall, cooks his dad's friends prize fish and yes, gets the girl.The weird thing about this film I think: A half naked boy walks down the street in New York and nothin happens to him?
