The first and biggest disappointment was the music score.  It was cheap, boring musac that you would expect to hear in a dentists waiting room.  I would have liked to have heard the actual artists music that to me that is the very thing that shaped the sixties.  However I do realize that there were probably copyright issues that prevented the music.  Also, the show may have been easier to follow if it would have told the story in chronological order instead of the events being scattered all over the decade;  (from Woodstock to JFK to the moon landing to MLK then back to Montery pop festival).  The information was all there but came up a big disappointment in the entertainment department.

917886,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000A0GP22,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[11, 13]","The Sixties: The Years That Shaped A Generation gives us a broad retrospective of these times although this suffers from two major flaws. The DVD documents mostly the years between 1967 and 1974; and there should have been more newsreel footage from that era instead of interviews with historians who weren't always present at the major demonstrations.The archival footage is in very good shape as we see the youth of the 1960s spearheading the development of major social movements. We see many college students, black people and women fighting for fundamental social change and greater equality with the white male population. There is good footage of Martin Luther King, Jr. as he gives his speeches; and the footage of Bobby Kennedy was great also. It's positive to see that the 1960s produced major advances in equality for blacks, student rights, women and gays.Some of the interviews by Arlo Guthrie and Henry Kissinger are valuable because these people were deeply politically involved during a time a rapid social change and upheaval. I didn't see the advantage of interviewing others like Pat Buchanan. Yes, he wrote speeches for Nixon, but I didn't get the impression he publicly involved himself in any movement, left or right, of the day.I must say once again that the title is going to mislead you. Yes, this covers the turbulent 1960s; but it starts with 1966 and 1967--not 1960. The viewer, therefore, gets the message that the makers of this film don't consider anything before 1966 or 1967 as being noteworthy. I would disagree.The DVD doesn't have bonus features--unless you count ""scene selection."" Sigh.Overall, I recommend this for people who want an elementary introduction to one of the most turbulent times in recent American history. Students of global history will appreciate the footage of student protests in other countries across the globe. Unfortunately, however, I think the film was made somewhat carelessly. There's scarcely any information about the years before 1967; and the interview footage adds color but just not enough.",3,lukewarm rehashing of the 1960s that is best viewed as a primer,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,2062,"['Sixties', 'Years', 'Shaped', 'Generation', 'broad', 'retrospective', 'times', 'suffers', 'two', 'major', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'documents', 'mostly', 'years', '1967', '1974', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'era', 'instead', 'interviews', 'historians', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'present', 'major', 'demonstrations.The', 'archival', 'footage', 'very', 'good', 'shape', 'see', 'youth', '1960s', 'spearheading', 'development', 'major', 'social', 'movements', 'see', 'many', 'college', 'students', 'black', 'people', 'women', 'fighting', 'fundamental', 'social', 'change', 'greater', 'equality', 'white', 'male', 'population', 'good', 'footage', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'speeches', 'footage', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'great', 'also', 'positive', 'see', '1960s', 'produced', 'major', 'advances', 'equality', 'blacks', 'student', 'rights', 'women', 'gays.Some', 'interviews', 'Arlo', 'Guthrie', 'Henry', 'Kissinger', 'are', 'valuable', 'people', 'were', 'deeply', 'politically', 'involved', 'time', 'rapid', 'social', 'change', 'upheaval', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'advantage', 'interviewing', 'others', 'Pat', 'Buchanan', 'Yes', 'wrote', 'speeches', 'Nixon', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'publicly', 'involved', 'movement', 'left', 'right', 'day.I', 'must', 'say', 'once', 'again', 'title', 'going', 'mislead', 'Yes', 'turbulent', '1960s', '1966', '1967', 'not', '1960', 'viewer', 'therefore', 'message', 'makers', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'anything', '1966', '1967', 'being', 'noteworthy', 'would', 'disagree.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'bonus', 'features', 'count', 'scene', 'selection', 'Sigh.Overall', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'elementary', 'introduction', 'one', 'most', 'turbulent', 'times', 'recent', 'American', 'history', 'Students', 'global', 'history', 'will', 'appreciate', 'footage', 'student', 'protests', 'other', 'countries', 'globe', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'somewhat', 'carelessly', 'scarcely', 'information', 'years', '1967', 'interview', 'footage', 'color', 'just', 'not', 'enough']",The Sixties - The Years That Shaped a Generation

This DVD puts the time, causes, results and people in a holistic perspective. Living through the time you only caught bits and pieces of the politics, music, demonstrations, police actions and changing social mores.This ties many things together in context: music, social values and changes, demonstrations and ""establishment"" efforts to maintain power and the status quo and vigorous resistance to change. What is remarkable is that the changes brought about in the 1960s occurred in many countries around the world, not just university communities of the U.S. Many of our current laws and perspectives are strongly shaped by the changes that began in the 1950s, reached a peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continue through today.We currently find ourselves revisiting old battles and fighting false and unsustainable values and goals. This puts things in perspective and reminds us that a quality and sustainable civilization requires continuing effort and diligence against those who only think short-term and seek power. The 1960s were idealistic, but many of us now find ourselves an integral part of society, while continuing to hold onto the lofty goals of the 1960s.Should be required viewing for all, especially those who aspire to political office.",4,Lived Through and Remembered,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,1374,"['one', 'thing', 'have', 'lived', '1960s', 'What', 'remembered', 'disjointed', 'biased', 'incomplete', 'DVD', 'time', 'causes', 'results', 'people', 'holistic', 'perspective', 'Living', 'time', 'only', 'caught', 'bits', 'pieces', 'politics', 'music', 'demonstrations', 'police', 'actions', 'changing', 'social', 'mores.This', 'ties', 'many', 'things', 'together', 'context', 'music', 'social', 'values', 'changes', 'demonstrations', 'establishment', 'efforts', 'maintain', 'power', 'status', 'quo', 'vigorous', 'resistance', 'change', 'What', 'remarkable', 'changes', 'brought', 'about', '1960s', 'occurred', 'many', 'countries', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'university', 'communities', 'U.S', 'Many', 'current', 'laws', 'perspectives', 'are', 'strongly', 'shaped', 'changes', 'began', '1950s', 'reached', 'peak', 'late', '1960s', 'early', '1970s', 'continue', 'today.We', 'currently', 'find', 'revisiting', 'old', 'battles', 'fighting', 'false', 'unsustainable', 'values', 'goals', 'things', 'perspective', 'quality', 'sustainable', 'civilization', 'continuing', 'effort', 'diligence', 'who', 'only', 'think', 'short-term', 'seek', 'power', '1960s', 'were', 'idealistic', 'many', 'now', 'find', 'integral', 'part', 'society', 'continuing', 'hold', 'lofty', 'goals', '1960s.Should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'especially', 'who', 'aspire', 'political', 'office']",The Sixties - The Years That Shaped a Generation
