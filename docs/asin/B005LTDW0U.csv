There were some problems, though. I know that everything is resolved by the end, but there are some pretty homophobic and despicable characters in this movie. Thankfully, one of them changes and the other one gets sprayed with whipped cream. Despite some touchy dialogue, Walk A Mile In My Pradas is still a fun little comedy. And it was great seeing Dee Wallace, as always.",4,"Not Perfect, But Entertaining Nonetheless",1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,495,"['Walk', 'Mile', 'My', 'Pradas', 'comedy', 'good', 'cast', 'good', 'laughs', 'happy', 'ending', 'characters', 'involved', 'were', 'problems', 'know', 'everything', 'resolved', 'end', 'are', 'pretty', 'homophobic', 'despicable', 'characters', 'movie', 'Thankfully', 'one', 'changes', 'other', 'one', 'sprayed', 'whipped', 'cream', 'touchy', 'dialogue', 'Walk', 'Mile', 'My', 'Pradas', 'still', 'fun', 'little', 'comedy', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'always']",Walk A Mile In My Pradas

This one even has a gay/straight theme, but if it was made by or for gay people they must be self-loathing gay people.Who thinks it's funny to see a straight man turn gay? straight women. Who thinks it's funny to see a gay man turn straight? straight men. I guess there are also people who think magical role-reversal movies likeFreaky Fridayare hilarious and don't care what roles are being exchanged; and people who guffaw at extremely obvious lowbrow sitcom humor no matter what the subject is. As a gay man who outgrew adolescent squirming a long time ago, I find this kind of garbage annoying. I don't see how even straight people can find this relentlessly offensive and mean-spirited ""humor"" entertaining (the vicious ridicule of a desperate straight fat girl is especially appalling).Being gay is wonderful. If changing sexual orientation were possible (and it's not), I wouldn't turn straight if you gave me a billion dollars, and I really mean it. Any gay man who thinks being gay is something that should make a straight man squirm and pee in his pants - who thinks switching sexual orientation is funny - either is an idiot or secretly (or not so secretly) wishes he weren't gay. This movie is pretty well done for its inherently offensive kind, but if a single cent of gay money went into making it, the ones who invested that money should rethink their priorities.",2,Relentlessly offensive comedy for sitcom-bred straight people and self-loathing gays,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,1483,"['Once', 'again', 'have', 'movie', 'straight', 'people', 'classified', 'gay', 'gay', 'character', 'one', 'even', 'gay/straight', 'theme', 'was', 'made', 'gay', 'people', 'must', 'be', 'self-loathing', 'gay', 'people.Who', 'funny', 'see', 'straight', 'man', 'turn', 'gay', 'straight', 'women', 'Who', 'funny', 'see', 'gay', 'man', 'turn', 'straight', 'straight', 'men', 'guess', 'are', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'magical', 'role-reversal', 'movies', 'likeFreaky', 'Fridayare', 'hilarious', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'roles', 'are', 'being', 'exchanged', 'people', 'who', 'guffaw', 'extremely', 'obvious', 'lowbrow', 'sitcom', 'humor', 'matter', 'what', 'subject', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'outgrew', 'adolescent', 'squirming', 'long', 'time', 'find', 'kind', 'garbage', 'annoying', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'even', 'straight', 'people', 'can', 'find', 'relentlessly', 'offensive', 'mean-spirited', 'humor', 'entertaining', 'vicious', 'ridicule', 'desperate', 'straight', 'fat', 'girl', 'especially', 'appalling', '.Being', 'gay', 'wonderful', 'changing', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'were', 'possible', 'not', 'would', ""n't"", 'turn', 'straight', 'gave', 'billion', 'dollars', 'really', 'mean', 'Any', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'gay', 'something', 'should', 'make', 'straight', 'man', 'squirm', 'pee', 'pants', 'who', 'switching', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'funny', 'idiot', 'secretly', 'not', 'so', 'secretly', 'wishes', 'were', ""n't"", 'gay', 'movie', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'inherently', 'offensive', 'kind', 'single', 'cent', 'gay', 'money', 'went', 'making', 'ones', 'who', 'invested', 'money', 'should', 'rethink', 'priorities']",Walk A Mile In My Pradas

I did really laugh out loud at a few parts and the leading men are engaging, especially the straight one who turns gay. He might seem bigoted but it's not done in an overly mean way, so you can still take it like a good ribbing from a straight buddy almost.",5,Comedy That's Right Up My Alley,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,530,"['Well', 'very', 'nice', 'holiday', 'movie', 'whole', 'theme', 'switching', 'bodies', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'still', 'got', 'little', 'twist', 'own', 'one', 'still', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'straight', 'man', 'gay', 'man', 'did', 'really', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'few', 'parts', 'leading', 'men', 'are', 'engaging', 'especially', 'straight', 'one', 'who', 'gay', 'might', 'seem', 'bigoted', 'not', 'done', 'overly', 'mean', 'way', 'can', 'still', 'take', 'good', 'ribbing', 'straight', 'buddy', 'almost']",Walk A Mile In My Pradas

Now I already go into alot of the gay cinema not expecting much as there are alot of bombs out there but every so often one does come along that I will watch twice.Reading a few of the other reviews I never took the movie so serious and never looked at any sterotypes. I just took the film for what it was worth. Sure you had one character that was sooo straight and homophobic and the other who was so gay but lets face it, there are indeed ""some"" that are that way. Its not saying that everyone is like that. I have always wondered what would it be like for the other to see what it can be like if the shoe was indeed on the other foot. And I liked the way they chose a few ""extremes"" to have one not accept his/her sexuality like shock therapy to seeing a outragoues preist. Now, Thats funny. The cast was pretty good and actually pretty well acted. I liked the way that they were trying to get a point across without being so serious.

1493663,A224BKBLXVA859,B005LTDW0U,Rocky Sunico,"[1, 2]","Let's forget about the notion of linking homophobia with strange childhood trauma. Both Tony and Steve spend a lot of the movie acting out various stereotypes for straights and gays alike. Since Tony is now gay. he gains the magical ability to cook even though he had never done this before. Steve in turn has inherited a magical understanding of automobiles just because he's straight now.And of course we come to the &#34;problem&#34; that both are in committed relationships that are on the brink of marriage. Since their sexuality  alignments have been switched, this means that their relationships now fall apart since they can't have sex with one another. Sure, they remember their lives together and all the challenges that they had faced as couples. But because their sexual organs no longer respond to the right gender identity, they can't be in their relationships anymore.There are a million other ways that the writers could have explored the whole gender swap concept without going down such a cliched path. Sure, I know it's supposed to be a shallow comedy, but we can certainly do so much better than this. Comedies don't necessarily have to resort to being dumb and offensive in order to get laughs (and I can't really folks laughing in this movie apart for the odd Tom Arnold expression). There's such a thing as wit and humor that does require intelligence to write but not necessarily to appreciate and understand.And I don't even get the need to set this movie during the Christmas season. What is this, a Die Hard movie? If you want to go see a good LGBT themed holiday movie, go see Make The Yuletide Gay. It's not out of this world amazing, but it's still worlds better than this one.Walk A Mile In My Pradas is a horrible movie.
