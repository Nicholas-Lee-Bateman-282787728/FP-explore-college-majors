Artistic license is common in almost all bible to film endeavors, but ""Noah"" ruins itself with poor artistic interpretation. The idea of using walking rocks (that are very ineffective looking on screen) with a core of inner light to aid Noah was a creative disaster.  The ""giants of old"" from the biblical text  helping Noah build an ark was wise, but making them visually silly hurt the film.Be advised, some spoilers to follow. No one else should ever have been in the ark but Noah and his family, nor should they have been allowed to speak such terrible dialogue. I yearned to see a true survival story inside the ark, but again a forced new vision sidetracked a binding family. The movie is a lot of fluff with the weakest of scripts, that makes you want to just see the flood scene and get it over with.How many times does the ""you were chosen"" teaching mantra need to be said or implied in a film in which we know that is the needed formula? There are other ways to communicate that fact without actually saying it several times. It's worn out! I also didn't see most of the actors put an original stamp on their portrayals. Russell Crowe especially seemed to be doing his ""Gladiator"" character all over again.I'm done with Anthony Hopkins as the wise sage or father figure time and again in films. The character of Methusula could easily have been depicted with much more wisdom as well. Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson were very good, and held together what vestiges of the film that were effective together.I was disappointed in the CGI. The animals entering the ark seemed utterly unreal,and earthly animals at the least should seem genuine. The flood itself was a bit of a bore. Water coming up from the earth was just wrong. Apart from some small moments of interests the movie is destined to be forgotten with its achingly old script, poor reimaginings and flat ending. Yes, a downer of a theatrical experience for a subject that had exceedingly more potential.Note: It turns out that water coming up from the earth actually occurred in the biblical account. Some astute Amazon users that commented on my review pointed that out. I was in error. As one  commentator said, ""its one of the few things that  the film got right"", and I agree, but a couple of Genesis accuracies can't save the film.",2,Strange and weak,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,2409,"['Noah', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'desperately', 'shoot', 'new', 'life', 'famed', 'biblical', 'story', 'Artistic', 'license', 'common', 'almost', 'bible', 'film', 'endeavors', 'Noah', 'poor', 'artistic', 'interpretation', 'idea', 'using', 'walking', 'rocks', 'are', 'very', 'ineffective', 'looking', 'screen', 'core', 'inner', 'light', 'aid', 'Noah', 'was', 'creative', 'disaster', 'giants', 'old', 'biblical', 'text', 'helping', 'Noah', 'build', 'ark', 'was', 'wise', 'making', 'visually', 'silly', 'hurt', 'film.Be', 'advised', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'one', 'else', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'ark', 'Noah', 'family', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'speak', 'such', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'yearned', 'see', 'true', 'survival', 'story', 'ark', 'again', 'forced', 'new', 'vision', 'sidetracked', 'binding', 'family', 'movie', 'lot', 'fluff', 'weakest', 'scripts', 'want', 'just', 'see', 'flood', 'scene', 'get', 'over', 'with.How', 'many', 'times', 'were', 'chosen', 'teaching', 'mantra', 'need', 'be', 'said', 'implied', 'film', 'know', 'needed', 'formula', 'are', 'other', 'ways', 'communicate', 'fact', 'actually', 'saying', 'several', 'times', 'worn', 'out', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'most', 'actors', 'put', 'original', 'stamp', 'portrayals', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'especially', 'seemed', 'be', 'doing', 'Gladiator', 'character', 'again.I', ""'m"", 'done', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'wise', 'sage', 'father', 'figure', 'time', 'again', 'films', 'character', 'Methusula', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'depicted', 'much', 'more', 'wisdom', 'as', 'well', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'held', 'together', 'what', 'vestiges', 'film', 'were', 'effective', 'together.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'CGI', 'animals', 'entering', 'ark', 'seemed', 'utterly', 'unreal', 'earthly', 'animals', 'least', 'should', 'seem', 'genuine', 'flood', 'was', 'bit', 'bore', 'Water', 'coming', 'up', 'earth', 'was', 'just', 'wrong', 'Apart', 'small', 'moments', 'interests', 'movie', 'destined', 'be', 'forgotten', 'achingly', 'old', 'script', 'poor', 'reimaginings', 'flat', 'ending', 'Yes', 'downer', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'subject', 'had', 'exceedingly', 'more', 'potential.Note', 'out', 'water', 'coming', 'up', 'earth', 'actually', 'occurred', 'biblical', 'account', 'astute', 'Amazon', 'users', 'commented', 'review', 'pointed', 'was', 'error', 'one', 'commentator', 'said', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'film', 'got', 'right', 'agree', 'couple', 'Genesis', 'accuracies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film']",N/A

The biblical story of Noah is not very long, and its moral and practical message is pretty straightforward, in the Bible. Yet this movie made the attempt to stretch the story to 2 hours, so it added so many extra facets that kept us saying, &#34;Wait, that's not in the Bible. What happened? Why is Noah doing this or that?&#34; To make it worse, the moral message was watered down because it was expanded to include other moral quagmires. How the audience feels about these other moral decisions greatly affects their eventual opinion of the movie, and I don't think it will be good. Another sore point with me is that there really is no story climax---the plot just fizzles out towards the end. Main character Noah (Russell Crowe) might have a moral directive from God, but in his dedication to that he winds up doing some immoral stuff. How should we feel about him? He was supposed to be our hero. Noah's wife Jennifer Connelly, to her credit, does a fantastic acting job, especially her hateful rant towards the end. She delivers her lines so well that we are convinced that they spell the end of a relationship. But no, that is not what happens. Oh, God. And Anthony Hopkins: why is he in this movie in a role worth 10% of what he can deliver? Bad casting decision. Did he need the money badly, or was he chosen just for the name? And Ray Winstone as a savage leader? His acting persona is his face, his accent, and his erudite delivery. But here he is just slightly above the animals! One big plus for this movie is the gorgeous cinematography and special effects. In my view, the REAL star of the show were the stone-ash-crippled creatures called the Watchers. Very innovative, unlike any other creatures in movies. So, overall, I was disappointed with this film that went round-and-round towards the purported goal, which turned out to be anti-climactic when we got there.

1599833,AWTY32U87QZEF,B009NNM828,Amazon Customer,"[18, 40]","The following review consists mainly of my own opinions and may contain spoilers. Caution.There's no way around it: Whether you're a Christian or Atheist, Noah is more than a little likely to severely offend you. I already knew that the account of Noah in this movie would be a bit different but there are liberties taken here that are arguably  blasphemous to the extreme. In this film ""The Creator"" AKA GOD is portrayed as a cruel, unforgiving and even indecisive being. The title character himself acts like a psychopath when he talks about murdering the children of his adopted daughter. At one point in the movie Noah even goes so far to say that the point of the flood and the ark is to make sure that ALL mankind is wiped out. If you believe in this account as historical fact, then that's not just silly, it's just plain wrong.I'd like to point out that there were many things in this movie that conflict with the Biblical account of Noah. For one, the Nephilim were the offspring of rebellious angels who came to Earth when they had relations with women. They were NOT benevolent Rock monsters! Most importantly though, was the fact that in the Bible, Noah and his family tried to warn everyone of the impending flood. Instead of listening however they just went on their merry way. Noah did NOT let those people die, the people on Earth had a choice to listen to Noah's warning or just die in the cataclysm. Part of Noah's assignment was to try and save any potentially righteous people! Oh, and because of the friendly rock monsters(Not Nephilim), it no longer takes Noah decades to build the ark, but only a few years. Oh and by the way, the Ark had a stowaway too. It says right there in Matthew 24:39 ""and they took no note until the Flood came and swept them all away"". Nobody tried to take the ark! Like I said, I was not nave enough to believe the account wouldn't be changed to some degree, but if this movie didn't take itself so seriously, it might come off as a comedy.The movie doesn't even pass muster as entertainment. It's tedious, it's hard to watch, it's just a very unpleasant experience because the story is basically pointless. Save the animals? Why? It's very hard for us the audience to identify with Noah in this movie. By the way, where in the bible did it say he let a girl caught in a bear trap that his one son loved die? At the end, Noah shamefully steals a verse from the Bible about being fruitful and filling the Earth. I guess that goes against what he said earlier about mankind dying out and the flood, or not? I don't know. Does this movie really need to be confusing in addition to being as indecisive as the creator is portrayed in this movie?The long and short is this: Noah the movie is garbage. These days when too few people even read the bible, most people are likely to see this film and they're not going to feel the least bit compelled to pick up the Bible. Movies like this in contrast to movies like the Ten Commandments or even The Passion of the Christ are likely to turn people off to the word of God. With a movie like this, there is a certain promise that the makers of the film should at least be somewhat faithful to the source material. But they couldn't even manage that. We can't really identify with anybody in the movie! Therefore a genuine emotional connection is lacking. Most women might even find it very hard to identify with Noah's wife, who is there just to stand there and look emotional throughout the whole thing. With such a drastic retelling, what was the point of the film? Since it deviates on such a ridiculous level from the original story with all sorts of stupid stuff added in(like the shedded snake skin thing), I can only conclude there was no point to the movie. Movies based on the bible should make you want to pick up the Bible. Unless you picked it up out of burning anger for what this movie did, did the movie really make you want to read the bible?Oh, and why are Atheists likely to be offended by this film? Because the movie asserts that God created the heavens and the earth, but it takes the rather dubious creationist point of view that the Earth was created in six literal days. No matter who you are, I can't imagine anyone watching this movie without feeling a bit sickened by the experience.",1,I knew Hollywood was going to take some artistic liberties but...

1599834,A15LV8T2XAUD0Y,B009NNM828,Amazon Customer,"[55, 91]","Normally I go easy reviewing Bible-based films. They are generally meant to appeal to a faith-based audience and often eschew great filmmaking for the sake of the message. All well and good. But Noah is not a Bible film. It is a political statement barely hidden behind one-dimensional, stereotyped characters within a loose retelling of a story from Hebrew Scriptures. If PETA and the EPA had written Genesis, this would be it. I have no problem with political movies per se, but don't try to tell us they are ""Biblical"". In this case the mischaracterization is a fraud and a sham. Where to begin?Noah and his family represent the flower children of the 1960s, nature's darlings, who consider it wicked to pluck even a petal. Everyone else on earth belongs to the damned. Why? Because they eat meat, practice deforestation, and believe that humans were given dominion over the world. For these reasons, humans are the vile, wicked occupants of planet Earth unworthy of God's redemption. Confused, I took a glance at my copy of the Torah. It seems to provide kosher methods for slaughtering animals for both eating and sacrificing, rules for eating the lambs on Passover, and God telling Adam and Eve to ""be fertile...master the earth...and rule the fish, birds, and all living things"" (Gen 1:28). I guess those centuries of Israelites who wrote and followed the very texts that this story is based on got it wrong. Fortunately, Hollywood knows better. By the way, don't forget, God originally planned to wipe out the animals, too (Gen 6:7).The political platform of this film manages to include jibes against hunters (girl gets caught in a steel bear trap - wonder how they had that in this pre-Iron Age world?), ""bitter clingers"" (Ham wants to keep the weapon given to him by the evil king against Noah's wishes), right-to-lifers (Na'el wants to keep her babies but Noah decides that infanticide is preferable to allowing the human race to continue). In fact, everything about this film bludgeons the point home that humans are bad, Creation is good. If only we would leave, the universe would once again be in balance. I'm no preacher, but I don't think that's the message of the Bible. Even Darwin's theory of evolution (in the midst of a Creationist account of the origins of life!) is championed here.""Noah"" is filled with the usual hypocrisy that accompanies political rants like this one. Though evil humans have deforested their land to build their vile city, Noah immediately proceeds to do the same and deforest the magic land grown from the seed of Eden to build his ark. Noah condemns his wife Naameh for admitting she would kill in order to protect her children (vile woman!) while Noah energetically kills any who would jump aboard his precious ark to save their lives. Ham is vilified by Noah for his sinful lust when all he wants is a wife to take with him to their depopulated future. He does not get one (according to Genesis, all the sons had wives). Noah (played with excruciating dullness by Russell Crowe who is once again stuck in first gear) gives a soliloquy against violence during a visual montage of warriors past and present (including, look closely, Revolutionary War-era and World War II-era soldiers). How evil! Never mind that some soldiers in history have actually fought to defend liberty and deny tyranny. I guess we should have let those nasty Nazis have their way.Artistic liberties abound as is generally unavoidable when making full-length motion pictures from often very little textual material. Nevertheless, the outright convolution of elements from inside and outside the Bible is astounding. In this film, the Tolkienesque Watchers, described in the book of Enoch and apparently equivalent to the ""sons of God"" of Gen 6:2, are good guys! The film presents them as angels who have come to help mankind (so far so good) until men duplicitously turned against them. In reality, the text of Enoch characterizes Watchers as ""fallen"" angels, i.e. demons, because when they got here they started lusting after human women, mating with them, and teaching humans about weaponry, sorcery, etc. Poor, misunderstood demons. They're so noble in this film, however, that they even build and defend Noah's ark.Methuselah, Noah's grandfather, played by the ubiquitous Anthony Hopkins, is a looney Gandalf-type character who lives in a cave, dreams of berries, and dispenses magic (sorcery?) whenever importuned. Women fair surprisingly poorly in such a liberal environment. They generally look on and weep and are ineffectual at anything they try. Naameh, played by Jennifer Connelley, gets one scene in which she unloads on cruel Noah but to no avail.The dour, depressing, soulless character of this film is not in any way reprieved by its brief five-minute attempt to rectify everything at the end. Noah realizes he cannot kill his grandbabies (hooray for him) and a rainbow appears in the sky. It's as if the studio, after seeing this monstrosity, begged the filmmakers for a happy ending no matter the inconsistency. Of course, anyone seeking religion from Hollywood is already misguided. Nevertheless, there is no inspiration here of any kind, religious or otherwise. It's just dreadful. If I want a religious movie, I'll stick with the Ten Commandments or Ben-Hur until something better comes along. If I want Tolkein, I'll go to the source.",2,"The Politics of ""Noah""; or The Bible meets the Lord of the Rings",1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,5377,"['Normally', 'go', 'easy', 'reviewing',

Salama,"[2, 4]","The first biblical epic made by Hollywood in many decades isn't too faithful to its source: the presence of Stone giants should be a clue to that. Noah (Russell Crowe) is, in modern parlance, a quite fanatical environmentalist. Not only he is a vegetarian, but he reproaches his son when he picks up a flower. You see, he only eats those fruits and vegetables that had already fallen to the ground (such extreme ethics won't impede him from killing scores of men if it needs be). His family of gatherers stands in contrast with the mean men living in the dirty proto industrial cities, places where sin and disobedience to God (or the Creator, as the movie calls him) rules. That Noah values animals over men is seen by his ultimate plan (which he claims has been dictated to him by the Creator): he wants humanity to become extinct after the flood. That's why when he learns that his daughter (Emma Watson) is pregnant, he vows to kill her baby if it turns out to be a girl, as he wants the survivors of the flood to be the last humans on Earth. Criticism aside one must admit this is a generally well made, compelling and entertaining movie. Anthony Hopkins has a nice cameo as Methuselah, who is portrayed here as an ancient Gandalf like wizard (the Lord of the Rings seems to have been as much as an influence on this movie as the Bible here). Ray Winstone is fine as the chief Bad guy, the king of the evil men Tubal Cain. Also with Jennifer Connelly as Noah's wife.

1599836,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B009NNM828,Andrew Ellington,"[32, 51]","~this review was written after seeing the film in the theaters on opening night~Finding a place to begin a review of &#8216;Noah&#8217; is difficult for me.  I have so many things to say about this and yet knowing where to start is hard to pinpoint.  I could just ramble from the get-go and eventually get to a place where it all makes sense and it all comes together and yet I&#8217;m not even sure that that would happen since at the moment I&#8217;m still processing everything and trying to formulate my actual opinion.  Maybe finding a place to start is not the problem at all, but finding the TIME to start.  I mean, is now really the best time to flesh out a review of the film you just saw, or would it be more appropriate to wait until I&#8217;ve had the needed days to process?  I&#8217;ve asked myself this question all day long, as I&#8217;ve continued to tweet various feelings about the film or post paragraphs about it on various social mediums.The bottom line is that I can&#8217;t stop thinking about it and so maybe now is the best time to write this all down.I&#8217;ll be pretty up front in admitting that &#8216;Noah&#8217; was one of the films I was most looking forward to this year.  In fact, ever since the project was announced with Aronofsky at the helm and Crowe in the lead I was hooked.  I&#8217;ve been waiting with wide eyed anticipation since early last year.  But then harmful speculation started to sneak into the media and the idea that Aronofsky&#8217;s Biblical epic was indeed a disaster began to take root.Everyone&#8217;s a critic, right?There are many ways to look at a film like &#8216;Noah&#8217;.  I think this is where many people are going to find themselves either on the outside looking in, are settled into the front seat, awaiting the ride.  The Bible is a very tricky subject, because the passion surrounding it is heated from both sides.  Those who follow it as the book of God don&#8217;t like it to be messed with, and those who view it as a man&#8217;s book consider its contents ridiculous, outdated and irritating.  You cannot please both camps.  Darren Aronofsky has flirted with God, faith and the paranormal before, and so this isn&#8217;t exactly new territory for him.  Many note &#8216;The Fountain&#8217; as an example of Aronofsky&#8217;s delving into faith, and many also note that film as a reason why he should stay away from the subject.I happen to think that film has lofty ideas and a great sense of originality, but it needed a little more guidance.&#8216;Noah&#8217; works, for me at least, as a separate entity, removed from its source.  The film veers so much from the written text that anyone watching it an expecting an exact retelling of the preserved story is going to find themselves confused.  Aronofsky alters many well-known aspects of Noah&#8217;s story (including his depiction of the fallen angels, here seen as kind hearted &#8216;watchers&#8217;, cursed to the Earth for their desire to help men right themselves with The Creator) and so some (or many) Christians may have a hard time swallowing this particular version of Noah&#8217;s story.  I have to admit, the Christian in me was slightly alarmed by these alterations, and there were a few individuals at the showing I attended to walked out during a key scene between Noah&#8217;s rival, Tobal-Cain, and Noah&#8217;s son Ham.  Still, there is something that I continue to come back to that makes this film feel all the more important to me.The bottom line is that &#8216;Noah&#8217; serves as a wickedly astute allegory to modern man&#8217;s struggle with faith.  Much less a Biblical, historical account, Aronofsky&#8217;s Noah is a marvelous depiction of the modern man and his eternal plight to understand, and account, before God (or whatever being he puts faith in).  Instead of delivering to us a film that feels like a dusty historical account, complete with technical authenticity, Aronofsky brings Noah to the 21st Century, giving him the weight of modern man and making him emotionally accessible to his audience.  The themes that Aronofsky broaches here, from blind faith, doubt, self-righteousness, guilt and mercy all stem from a place that feels more suited to our modern society, thus giving this &#8216;telling&#8217; a more arresting feel.I can completely understand why those who don&#8217;t like anything interfering with scripture will not appreciate this work, but separated from the text I think one should be able to appreciate how beautiful Aronofsky wove this tale.It doesn&#8217;t all work though.  There are some narrative issues, some plot construction issues that feel fractured from the rest of the film.  Still, these fractions are slim and don&#8217;t hamper the overall impact of the film.Anchoring this film is a pretty impressive performance by Russell Crowe, who carries so much weight in his eyes that he, in my eyes, becomes the ideal Noah for Aronofsky&#8217;s tale.  Watching his dissension into madness over his own internal struggle with faith, having his beliefs shaken by his observance of mankind and ultimately lose all his sanity in his plight to &#8216;do The Creator&#8217;s work&#8217;, is completely mind blowing.  Sadly, the rest of the cast doesn&#8217;t fare as well.  Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly are somewhat uninteresting until the very end, when they cry a lot, and Douglas Booth does absolutely nothing to the point where I honesty wonder if a lot of his scenes were but.  Anthony Hopkins is just a clich&eacute; and a badly drawn one at that, and Leo McHugh Carroll (and honestly Gavin Casalegno as well) are so effeminate looking I thought for a moment that they changed the sex of Noah&#8217;s children.  Ray Winstone and Logan Lerman fair the best of the supporting cast thanks to the moral complexity of their characters, and Winstone&#8217;s muttering dispute with The Creator is telling to the state of Aronofsky&#8217;s Biblical world.Visually, this film is a treat.  The cinematography is absolutely stunning.  The mix of gritty lighting and harsh tones with that storybook scenery (and those night backdrops with shadows and crayon skies) is simply breathtaking.  The CGI doesn&#8217;t always work (especially when the animals are entering the ark) but the actual flood is breathtaking, and the use of CGI in a distanced effect (like the swarming birds) sends chills.  At the heart of this atmosphere is yet another stunning score by Clint Mansell, which builds to such heights over the course of the film.Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s &#8216;Noah&#8217; is not your father&#8217;s Noah.  It&#8217;s not even your Noah, but it is a variation of the man who really was always the perfect canvas for the dissection of faith that Aronofsky attempts to debate.  Here is a man who was saddled with the weight of a worldwide destruction.  The impact of that foreknowledge is ripe for so many interpretations.  While one may argue that scripture should not be &#8216;interpreted&#8217; at will, I don&#8217;t think that what Aronofsky does here alters the breadth of the scriptures but merely opens up the conversation for our own modern idea of faith.This is a heavily flawed film, but it is also a film that demands conversation, and the fact that the one thing I keep returning to is the film&#8217;s clear modern application makes me feel like this could be the one film from 2014 that we continue to return to and continue to debate.A flawed masterpiece is far better than a perfected failure.",5,It&#8217;s going to be a wet one&#8230;,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,7505,"['~this', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'seeing', 'film', 'theaters', 'opening', 'night~Finding', 'place', 'begin',

Those looking for a ""Ben-Hur"" will instead be treated to a stripped-down version of the book of Genesis, that is no different from other recent disaster movies, such as ""2012.""The cast can't hold this shipwrecked screenplay together. Given that the story of Noah never had much of a narrative, Darren Aronofsky takes extensive liberties to craft his 2-hour and 15-minute big budget mess. Jennifer Connelly single-handedly ruins the entire movie with her misplaced over-acting, pristine appearance, and general frailness. According to the book of Genesis, Noah lived around 5,000 BCE. Why does everybody in this movie look like they belong on the Scottish Lowlands with William Wallace? Moreover, why does Ray Winstone and his army lay siege to Noah's ark with welding masks covering their faces?For whatever reason, Darren decided to include ""fallen angels"" to watch over earth. These are nothing more than stone golems, taken straight from Peter Jackson's Hobbit films. Unlike better movies based on the Bible, Noah is devoid of religious undertones.

1599838,A3EBJL95L3SS4K,B009NNM828,ashaw12,"[7, 21]","Now, I'm not going to say that ""Noah"" doesn't have it's problems, because it definitely does (pacing and some dialogue, to be specific). But despite that, it's still a well-made and thought-provoking film with incredible cinematography, fantastic acting, and immaculate sound design. The film begins as an epic fantasy movie and slowly transitions into a gripping psychological drama.To say this is one of Aronofsky's darker films is an understatement, but that may be one of the reasons why I loved it so much. In his version of the story, Noah becomes an extremely dark character who (through lack of communication) is unsure of God's wishes about whether or not the human race should survive after the flood. After witnessing the wickedness of man firsthand (trading young women for meat, ripping animals apart with their bare hands, etc.), Noah is horrified and although God does not contact him after the initial warning of the oncoming flood, Noah misinterprets God's silence as confirmation that He believes humans have done enough damage in this world and do not deserve a second chance.I'm not going to give anything else away for the sake of spoilers, but I insist you give this a watch. And whatever you do, don't listen to the Christian fundamentalists trying to tear this movie apart for inane reasons, like that it isn't ""historically accurate"" to the Bible. Guess what? Christians aren't the only one with a flood story. In fact, ""Noah"" was based on multiple religious texts including the Bible, Jewish mid-rashes and other Gnostic texts. Pretty much everything included in the film is based on something in some type of religious text - yes, even the ""rock monsters"" are Aronofsky's interpretation of the giants who are referenced in the Bible and other texts.

Warning, SPOILERS TO FOLLOW:The GOOD:&#34;Fred's Raft&#34; captured the forgiveness overriding theme of the Bible akin to Abraham being tested by G-d but G-d never intending for Abraham to truly sacrifice his son, G-d giving the ten commandments despite the worshipping of a golden calf idol by the liberated Egyptian Jews, G-d willing to not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah if good people could be found,...  and innumerable other stories of Divine compassion in the &#34;Old&#34; Testament.Similarly and favorably, &#34;Fred&#34; as played by Russell Crowe did not sacrifice the twins in &#34;Fred's Raft&#34; in a fully fabricated insertion of attempted murder to the Noah story.  Similarly, a conspiracy by Ham and active effort by Shem to effect patricide was distasteful as this was never present in the Bible.  Though the contrived filicide of the grandchildren was equally distasteful, it was nice to see the compassion of G-d of the Bible demonstrated as He never insisted on follow-thru death of the Holleywood fabricated filicide test.As one can read the &#34;Old&#34; Testament at any time to see that death was not mandated by G-d for Abraham's son nor Noah's family, the visual testimony of the &#34;Old&#34; Testament's Biblical  compassion in &#34;Fred's Raft&#34; does not warrant allocation of time to view it.Sadly discarded in &#34;Fred's Raft&#34; was G-d's wish for true repentance turning from evil to good to warrant salvation and forgiveness by accountable actions.  The Biblical stories of Noah, Sodom and Gomorrah, and others illustrate G-d's wish for people to behave with decency via actions, not mere words or devotion.  However, &#34;Fred's Raft&#34; discarded the notion of repentance and accountability of the Bible as the young woman would-be wife of Ham was sacrificed by Hollywood and an unsympathetic &#34;Fred,&#34; quite different from the Bible's Noah.As demonstrated and articulated by the intruder on the boat, the movie showed that evil is served by man worshipping man with no accountability or respect for decency, justice, tolerance, respect for other living creatures, or the rule of law.  However, in contra-distinction to the Bible, no clear protagonist was presented.  Russell Crowe's &#34;Fred&#34; was the antithesis of Noah.  The movie portrayed a fanatic who mistakenly contrived that G-d wished for him to murder his grandchildren, terminate future generations of any vestige of humanity, and refuse forgiveness to all save his family.  Saving the life of his loved grandfather was never even entertained.Also good in &#34;Fred's Raft&#34; were the brief special effect scenes of the raft on the ocean.  Not quite worth the reported $130 million film budget.  Quite a few other films have similar dynamic ocean scenes such that the brevity of special effects does not even come close to supporting the allocation of time to see the WTF film.  Titanic had much better music as well as better visuals and 2012 was a far better apocalypse film with vastly better computer graphics as the ocean overrode the monks at the Himalayan peaks.The issue of depletion of natural resources is a tangible, vital argument when societies respecting equal rights is dependent on oil from countries which embrace terrorism and deprivation of women's rights with murder of homosexuals.  However, as commonly besetting a confused Hollywood, the issue was inappropriately and unreasonably inserted into the biblical story of Noah.  We do not pay high fees to go to the movies to be lectured by ultra-rich hippocrites who line their pockets with millions of dollars as they decry the evils of earned wealth.Similarly, &#34;Fred's Raft&#34; indicated that G-d wished to destroy the planet not because of the evils people were doing to people, but rather that which man was doing to the environment.  The environment is precious, but life itself is invaluable.  Hollywood, confused by their greed and who knows what else, totally misrepresented the Bible's values of human ethics.One final &#34;good&#34; statement.  The above and below review do not apply to Russell Crowe.  Gladiator is one of my favorite movies and he's done tons of other greats as a wonderful actor.  Director is crap.The BAD:&#34;The Bad&#34; was almost ubiquitous throughout the Hollywood destruction of the Noah story of the Bible, mandating a one star rating.  SPOILERS again present.Contrary to the movie, the Bible story of Noah never had Noah actively murdering people, Noah the vegetarian deriding the nutritional merit of meat, magic rocks used for explosives, American Indian drug induced &#34;spirit journey&#34; visions, destruction of the land from mining to provide for the masses, the foolish self-hating outright lie that industrial westernized societies are inherently evil vs. the good of scavenging or impoverished third world countries where equal rights are absent, testing of Noah to sacrifice babies, pregnancy test technology in biblical times, sedative technology to make the animals conveniently fall asleep rather than feeding them in accordance with the Biblical story, death of some species aboard the ark as murdered by the fabricated evil human intruder, and sci-fi giant rock monsters with glowing eyes detracting from the story of salvation of the good and damnation of the unrepentant evil.G-d's mending of women's barren wombs was repeatedly discussed in the Bible (Abraham's wife Sarah as well as Hannah (Elkanah's wife), Rebekah (Isaac's wife), Rachel (Jacob's wife), Samson's mother, and Michal (David's first wife)).  In &#34;Fred's Raft,&#34; bearing no semblance to the Biblical story that audiences paid money to see, it was the magical grandfather who cured the barren womb.  Very noninspirational and consistent with atheist/pagan Hollywood usurping the audience's wishes by instead presenting man serving man by manifesting Divine powers.  The degradation and destruction of G-d of the Bible to instead worship man was NOT what I paid for.  Future would-be viewers should be aware!Contrary to the movie, the Bible story of Noah did include Noah compassionately directed by god to warn his neighbors to repent and join him in salvation to create a better world by elimination of the evil of the old.  However, &#34;Fred's Raft&#34; depicted Russell Crowe as discarding the helpless, most moving when he failed to help the young woman whose leg was caught in a hunting trap despite the protestations of his son Ham.  Furthermore, &#34;Fred's Ark&#34; suggested that G-d could not be questioned but mankind routinely questions and petitions G-d in the Bible.  An omnipotent G-d is not threatened by man's challenges and blind faith is not G-d's wish.  Decent behavior, helping others is G-d's goal for man in the Bible despite &#34;Fred's Raft.&#34;Additionally, the Bible story of Noah distinctly did have Noah so good a person such that G-d spoke directly to him akin to G-d directly speaking to Adam, Eve, Caine, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Saul, some kings, and some prophets.  Via dreams He also spoke to Joseph, Samuel, Daniel, Elijah, and Solomon.  Indirectly via angels, G-d spoke to Sarah, Lot, Elisha, and Hagar.  G-d even spoke to a snake in the Bible and to Balaam via Balaam's donkey, but not to Russell Crowe in &#34;Fred's Raft.&#34;  List probably not all inclusive but certainly Russell Crowe should have been presented as speaking directly to G-d rather than American Indian trance states.  Those of us paying to see a movie in the theatre do not appreciate Hollywood's drastic changing of the Biblical story as G-d directly speaking to Moses in Hollywood's Ten Commandments is one of the most well received scenes of the classic movie.  Rent the Ten Commandments with Charleton Heston instead!Two final points.  Never once did &#34;Fred's Raft&#34; use the name &#34;G-d&#34; despite concealing the Hollywood messages under the Biblical name &#34;Noah.&#34;  Also, the Biblical story of Noah was not one of actively killing humanity but instead G-d's compassionate offer of those good, repentant souls a fresh start to do it right this time.Enormously disappointing!Just one question - why did they inappropriately name the movie &#34;Noah?&#34;",1,Fred's Raft,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,8446,"['34', 'Fred', 'Raft', '34', 'movie', '34', 'Noah', '34', 'had', 'so', 'very', 'little', 'common',

1599841,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B009NNM828,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[20, 35]","Noah is well-acted, intense, and visually it is beautiful from beginning to end, but WOW is the story wild.Creative license had to be taken with the story of Noah. Let's be real, the biblical account does not tell us much of anything in the realm of detail- that's all left up to the reader's imagination. Anyone making a movie about Noah and the ark is going to have to make some of it up out of necessity. But what Aronofsky did with Noah is on another level altogether.First, what the devil is with the Watchers? Aronofsky made these fallen angels from the apocryphal Book of Enoch an essential part of Noah's story, and it was confusing as hell. For starters, why are the Watchers giant rock monsters? These things are lifted almost straight out of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (they look and fight almost exactly like the ents inThe Two Towers), and their existence and purpose are never sufficiently explained. Why are they there? They fell from heaven. Okay, but why are they giant rocks? And why do they hide? Oh, men are evil, turned on them, and persecuted them. BUT THEY'RE GIANT, 30-FOOT TALL ROCKS; they could destroy mankind easily, no? In any case, they're excruciatingly boring characters, and their inclusion in the film is just very awkward.Second, Noah experiences a personality change halfway through the film that feels quite unnatural. The loving Noah of the first half of the film, the good father and gentle husband, the Noah who took Ila in and raised her as his own daughter, disappears entirely. Suddenly, we have a Noah who turns a blind eye to violence and suffering. He gives his family the cold shoulder. Oh, and he threatens to kill newborns. I don't know if this was an attempt to portray the religious in a negative light or if it was just strange writing, but either way it came across as very forced and very out-of-character.Third, the whole film feels like a fairy tale. I was interested in a serious take on the story of Noah, a portrayal that could conceivably have happened in real life (with a fair bit of divine intervention, of course), not the stuff of a Disney fantasy. Even beyond the ridiculous Watchers, we're subjected to an overly dramatic account of creation, the hokey murder of Abel by his brother Cain, magic bright rocks that start fires, an evil stowaway on the ark, and, again, a Noah who practically becomes a serial killer. It's just too much to stomach.Fourth, the film's environmental message is not at all subtle. God had the world of men destroyed because they did not respect creation. All life is precious, nature is holy, and killing and eating animals is wrong. Yech! Spare me.Given these shortcomings, I am not at all surprised to read a fair amount of Christian outrage over this film. I myself am a Catholic, and while I don't fault Aronofsky for taking some liberties with the story of Noah and the Ark, I do fault him for making a mockery of it. While I did not think the movie was ""bad"" per se, I just did not enjoy it all that much, and I am also sympathetic to those who feel it has been misrepresented in trailers and advertisements. What you see is not what you get!Apart from a few powerful scenes (Noah attempting to console Ila was exceptional, as was his venture into the ""enemy"" camp), Noah is nothing more than pure entertainment: there are a lot of pretty visuals, great special effects, and a fair amount of action, but there is no overarching theme or deep moral message (unless you count ""respect nature"" as such). Noah missed every opportunity to make a profound statement about life or being human, which is really too bad. I also feel I should mention that Noah is pretty intense for a PG-13 film.

Noah and his big boat is a huge story from the Bible, and we have the technology in movie making to actually BRING LIFE to this rather short, yet hugely important part of the Book. Yes, our Creator did become so disenchanted with his Earth, He destroyed it; He drowned it completely.. (think of a 'mere' tsunami folks)....And why would an atheist make this film?  But also, why should we care ? Weird.  I am no atheist, but I do find my spiritual life in Christianity and in MORE... there is an endless Universe, people; I am sometimes frustrated with the lack of imagination in our Creator's 'supreme' creation.The great films which come from the Bible are able to help us see that these heroes were HUMAN. Yeah, human, with choices and flaws.  As a little kid in Sunday School didn't you wonder how Noah and his family built such a behemoth fortress to survive the wrath of God?  Why object to the voluntary and much needed assistance of the Fallen Angels? Fallen angels are still angels, (and no, I didn't really like the 'Rocky' looks of them), but they were redeemed by their good works... Don't we all wish for that?  I thought the cast was outstanding. Only Russell Crowe could pull of such a larger than life figure and yet make him human.  Jennifer Connolly was perfect. Emma Thompson shows she is older and wiser than Hermione and the three sons were excellent.  Yes, the Bible says that all the sons had wives, but it played true somehow to me that the &#34;middle son&#34; would have trouble, and that even as Paradise began again, Noah doubted his decisions to the point of becoming a drunk and the middle son, (who had allowed the 'evil' king to live aboard so long) would walk away,creating perhaps just the slightest hint that this Paradise would not be without stress, or trouble, or even evil...  Man/Woman, after all, has been given free will.  And it isn't always easy... that free will thing.  I would really give this four and a half stars if I could.  There were a few things which were a little muddled, mostly regarding Methuselah.. but over all.... I thought it was a good film.  I enjoyed it and it was thought provoking.  and for me, that is the best kind of entertainment, indeed, if taking on such a story could be merely entertainment.

Whether you're religious or not, everyone interprets the bible differently, and it's a touchy subject for most.

Included in this recent batch of films is Darren Aronofsky's ""Noah"", which looked to be more fresh and interesting than the others, but ended up being a huge missed opportunity.Starring Russell Crowe as the classic title character, we see him experience a vision foretelling a great flood that will wash over the Earth, destroying every living thing that stands on the soil. That vision leads Noah to construct a massive ark designed to shelter every existing animal, along with him and his family. With the help of a race of angels called The Watchers, we follow his treacherous, and often boring, journey to fight off the wicked and protect his loved ones.As epic as it may have looked, the movie never delivers.

The storyline is insane, Noah takes God's flood to commit genocide and saving his family and animals at first as face value... an intent to start over again.

I understand that any biblical story is controversial and many people will become upset if they read an opinion that they do not 100% agree with. So, that being said this is my opinion of the movie (Not Yours).I love the story of Noah since I was a child and today I still love reading Noah plight and what God has given him to reach that goal. The movie starts with Adam and Eve and their children Cain, Able and Seth. What confused me is the watchers, rock creatures? The whole set up of the scenes with scavengers running around and Noah's grandfather, the gold nuggets Noah had and a list of other weird events further confused me. The writers seemed to take a basic story and add middle earth (lord of the rings) type fantasy characters and situations. Why not, stick with a basic story and allow the characters and special effects tell the story, leave out all the fantasy stuff.

1599850,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B009NNM828,Brian Driver,"[7, 15]","I think this is important to get straight right at the start: Darren Aronofsky's NOAH is not a purely Biblical epic. It is, instead, an artistic and personal film made by one of cinema's more commercial auteurs - who has managed to create his most compelling general audience film to date.So, while the plot moves in loose accordance with the Bible (which in actuality leaves many gaps in Noah's saga) director and co-writer Aronofsky filled in the rest, and in so doing has turned out a watchable 140-minute movie that keeps the audience, if not glued to their seats, at least tuned in. But be warned: if you demand religious ""accuracy,"" this is not the film for you...the word ""God"" is never mentioned (Noah's mentor is instead referenced as ""The Creator""), and Aronofsky is quite liberal when it comes to constructing a movie he feels is ""inspired by"" the Bible, rather than in strict unity with it.This becomes clear early on when angels plummet from heaven and become mired in the cooling lava of a newly forming earth, becoming rock-like (and also kinda spider-like) ""watchers"" who have the pretty unfortunate job of trying to keep mankind in line. We all know about Adam and Eve's really bad day in the Garden of Eden, but it is  years later, when their son Cain murders brother Abel, that Cain's genetic line becomes doomed, and his tainted offspring go about plundering the earth for all they can steal.And so it is up to Cain and Abel's kinder, gentler sibling Seth to give mankind its last chance -- a shaky one indeed, as his policy of non-confrontation soon places his lineage in risk of becoming extinct. An angry Creator soon has had enough, and gives Seth's last heir, Noah, the command to build an Ark in preparation for a civilization-ending flood.What Aronofsky does well is build a story that concerns itself with The Man Noah and the broad shoulders he must put to use carrying the burden of the Creator's request. There are several moving scenes that concern the immense yoke (and later, horror) of turning one's back upon the masses of people who at first demand, then beg to be saved. In addition, the very fact that Noah has been chosen as the conduit for the Creator is often questioned not only by those outside the family, but those within as well. Even Noah himself questions the Creator's reasons for selecting him, for who is to say what is meant by the cryptic messages he is sent in the form of bizarre dreams? It is in this regard that NOAH the movie is strongest, especially when portrayed by the extremely capable actor Russell Crowe.While I certainly liked NOAH, I don't think it is a movie I will sit through twice - at least not for quite a while. This is not to say it is not watchable -- for it is - nor is it meant to knock either Aronofsky's direction or the very capable acting of, in addition, Jennifer Connelly as wife Naameh and or Emma Watson as foster daughter Ila, as all three really empower the movie in superbly professional style. It's only that this is a movie burdened by its unleavened darkness. While one might combat such a critique with ""Well, what else?"", I only respond that there could have been more attention paid to the wonderment of such a task. From the creation of the Earth to its near destruction, from the creation of the Ark to the amazing arrival of the animals, two by two, and even the beaching of the Ark and the emergence of new life upon it, I kept looking for more moments to gasp in awe at the spectacle. I wanted to, but It. Just. Felt. So. Damned. HEAVY.I did feel some effort was made toward the presentation of the Ark early on: it was a massive construct of wood, surrounded by web-like scaffolds, and though we only see it at the end of its construction we are indeed treated to a few scenes within before the animals arrive. It was immense, and did a good job of making me feel that given a little artistic license this really could have been a vessel capable of the task. And when those creatures arrive we get a little peek at the surprise of Noah and his family at their appearing out of the woods, either slithering or crawling or trundling along. But I felt more like it just happened, rather than it being - well, spectacular. Frankly, they looked pretty CGI.But I was immensely pleased that, while Aronofsky seemed to allow for a metaphorical interpretation of the creation as a ""Seven Day"" process, he never shied away from promoting Evolution with a capital E (just as he seemed to cater to science for the creation of the planets). And the movie was ecologically minded as well, though in an obvious way: Noah's family were expressly forbidden to eat meat, for doing otherwise would obviously make EXTINCT any animal they chose. It was nice to see the movie emphasize the worth of the animals over the petty needs of our stomachs.All in all, I was glad I watched NOAH, and ""carried"" the film with me when I left the theater. It was more accessible than Aronofsky's previous fare: 2006'sThe Fountain, 2008'sThe Wrestler, and 2010'sBlack Swan(the last two of which were nominated for two and five Oscars, respectively).  I re-emphasize how impressed I was with how this movie seemed to be less about the Noah as a religious figure and more about this troubled, beleaguered man who was given an enormous task, and of his bearing that weight even while he repeatedly questioned not only what he must do, but WHY such an mammoth mission was given to HIM to bear. ""Why me?"" he asks repeatedly -- and this is a question all who survive must also determine for themselves. When at one point his interpretation of his visions causes a near mutiny, we can only ponder what might have happened had there been a collapse of the very family that was Mankind's only chance to re-populate the planet.See NOAH if A) you like a director unafraid to stick his neck out for the films he makes; B) you have wondered about the Great Flood but preferred to see the story from a thoughtful perspective rather than, say, Michael Bay's; and C) you are okay with an interpretation of one of the Bible's great tales that The Great Book itself never really ""fleshed out.""",4,"Good,

1599856,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B009NNM828,Chris Kennison,"[6, 16]","Russell Crowe has been flirting with greatness nearly his entire career. In fact, if you look at the movies that he has been a part of or the lead actor in, you in the least have to assume that he is easily one of the most respected actors in Hollywood; ""L.A. Confidential"", ""The Insider"", ""Gladiator"", ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Master and Commander"", ""Cinderella Man"", ""American Gangster"", ""Les Miserables"" and now ""Noah"". On top of that, he's not always been the best at avoiding criticism for his off camera antics, box office failures and even his singing. So, why not shoulder another film that may be open to criticism?Well, if my opinion is worth anything, Crowe's turn as the biblical character Noah is not to be criticized, it is to be respected. The film itself may take some liberties with the words of the bible as well, but lets consider some things for a moment. First of all, the bible states that Noah was 500-years old when he became father to his three sons; Shem, Ham and Japheth. He then was exactly 600 when the rains began. So, either we're dealing with some biblical characters on a different calendar schedule or the reporters of information in this day and time took some liberties of their own. Of course, we also must realize that everybody died but Noah and his family and I'm pretty sure no reporters or writers managed to stow away.Bottom line, the story of Noah and the Ark is a story that is one of the most fantastical of the bible. There has been evidence that something Arkish did occur, but when all is said and done, to assume that everything in the story is exactly as it occurred or occurred at all, is as ridiculous as assuming that our twenty-four hour news outlets of today aren't biased toward certain political parties and every thing they say is exactly correct, all the time. So forget all your biblical hangups and realize that the true essence and intent of the story, as intended by the bible, is exactly in tact. Man is capable of evil and God is capable of judgment.Darren Aronofsky may have made more of a ""Lord of the Rings"" type film as opposed to a ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" type film, but as I said earlier; the story of Noah and the Ark is a fantastically spun story. There is great evil, there are fallen angels that are portrayed in the form of large rock monsters called 'Watchers' that reminded me of ""Lord of the Rings"" tree monsters, there are two of each animal that make their way to the Ark and apparently told the other animals of their kind to stay put and there is a monstrous flood that succumbs the earth.If you're hung up on accuracies and formalities then you will miss the outstanding performances by Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Ray Winstone who plays Tubal-Cain. More importantly though, you will miss the message that rings way too close to the world we live in today and does the bible stories intent justice. We as human beings cannot allow evil to succumb us and we must fight to make sure love and compassion always wins. ""Noah"" may have been a little long and windy in places, but as a whole, the movie is gifted with deep emotion and timely intent.",4,HOW DO YOU KNOW?

1599857,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B009NNM828,Christopher Schwinger,"[6, 18]","Darren Aronofsky, who was the director, a producer, and one of the two writers of this Noah movie, spun the Biblical story in some very weird directions.  I feel that the Noah's ark story's thematic power is seriously weakened by the worldview he projects on the script.  Though Aronofsky is an atheist, I am aware that John Huston, also an atheist, created a well-liked Biblical movie, called The Bible:  In the Beginning.  Thus I knew having an atheist direct it wouldn't necessarily make the movie irreverent.  I expected that seeing Noah in the theater would be an interesting experience, because I'd read quite a bit on the internet about the changes it makes from the Bible, but I hoped that I would at least find the themes satisfying.  In theory, they are, but I could not be more disappointed with how Aronofsky weakened them in his execution of the movie.Rather than listing the ways it departed from the Bible, my focus in reviewing it is to describe reasons I feel the changes weakened the movie:THE NOAH CHARACTERThe characterization of Noah as an almost psychopathic, duty-driven, misanthropic (anti-human) person is pessimistic, whereas the Bible, written from the Jewish perspective, presents the Noah story as a memorial of God's faithfulness to protect those who are righteous.  The Old Testament's theme is God's faithfulness.  (Genesis 8:1 says ""But God remembered Noah"" and caused the flood to cease.)  The movie could have included some great dialogue as they wait in the ark and try to be patient as the flood continues to go on for 40 days.  Instead, on this movie, Noah becomes demented on the ark, and everyone is trying to hide from him because he intends to kill off his family because he believes God hates people.  Instead of doing twisted psychological things like Aronofsky likes to do in movies, couldn't Aronofsky instead focus on themes of family and of thankfulness to God?  The whole movie is about Noah's confusion as to whether God likes people or not, and because Noah ultimately finds the goodness within his own instincts instead of from his understanding of God, it felt to me like a weak morality tale, even though the theme of valuing mercy over justice should, in theory, be a sure-fire success.  The reason the justice/mercy theme felt weak to me at the end is because the Noah character doesn't get any clarity from his understanding of God, nor thank God for preserving him from the flood.  God is the one who demonstrated a balance of justice (judgment) and mercy (protection) for people and for animals, yet in the movie, Noah finds that within himself, while believing he's failing God by showing mercy to his family.  That whole subplot of Noah wanting to kill his family because he believes God hates people doesn't even make sense, since he wouldn't have built the ark if he believed that.  It's the thing that weakens the script the most.Amazingly for a Biblical epic, God is almost made into the product of Noah's imagination, because instead of hearing from God, he has to interpret a wordless dream, and he becomes so blind to humane concerns because he believes God is all about destruction.  He somehow concludes at the end that God wants him to be fruitful and multiply, after getting drunk for feeling some guilt about sparing his family.  There's also a dysfunctional (doesn't fit with the story's theme(s)) subplot where Ham grows more distant from Noah because Noah didn't care about the girl Ham rescued from Tubal-cain's ruffians.  Ham wanders off by himself after the flood because he feels rejected--after the incident involving Noah's drunkenness, actually.  Ham growing distant from Noah doesn't tie into the theme at all, and I also really think a movie about Noah ought to end before the incident where he gets drunk, since it only was meaningful to the Jewish compilers because Noah curses Canaan, which would be the nation of Israel's enemy.NOAH'S FAMILY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND, EITHERThe character of Methuselah, a religious hermit in the movie, says Noah must interpret God's dream himself, and that it's not for him to tell Noah what's right and wrong.  It amazed me that all of these characters didn't have any confidence about who God was or assurance that God cares about people.  If someone is going to make a film about something so monumental as a great worldwide flood, which God caused and protected Noah from, then stop slowing down the story by dwelling on ""Does God love people?"" and focus on the process of preparing for the flood and on God's promise after the flood to never again destroy the world like that.  In the end, NOT ONE PERSON in his family speaks up to tell Noah that he misunderstood the mind of God, i.e., that God intended humans to survive.  After his instincts keep him from killing his family, he feels he's failed God, but no one tells him that God loves mercy.ANIMALS ARE SUPPOSEDLY ALWAYS GOODAronofsky was also unashamedly revisionist in making it so pro-animal but anti-human, to a laughable degree--as if everything NOT human is good, as if there's no such thing as animal predation.  In the movie, God's cause for destroying the world was that people ruined the soil and didn't care about endangered species and wanted to hunt instead of eat food they had grown.  But what about cruelty to other humans?  That's not shown very much, and when it is, it still is not emphasized as a reason for God to spare Noah but destroy the others.  The movie emphasized people's lack of ecology as the basis for God destroying the world.SUGGESTIONS OF WHAT SHOULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENTI have no problem with a somewhat ecological focus, but I feel the movie skewed the Noah story in weird enough ways that it became more like environmentalist screed than even a morality tale.  I read online that Emma Watson got sick from the water because ultra-green Aronofsky wouldn't let her have a plastic water bottle when filming on location in Iceland, and told her to live with her ill feelings and use 'em to make her acting more intense.  Instead of spending half an hour or more filling the movie with Noah's psychological tension, Aronofsky should've shown more of the process of building the ark (and without supernatural help--the movie adds stone giants called ""Watchers"" who help Noah out) and also Noah trying to warn the world to stop being licentious and irresponsible.  Instead of having Noah's family hide from him on the ark because he is waiting for the flood to end so he can kill his family, Aronofsky should've had them talk about God's faithfulness to protect them, and show more specifics of how life on the ark functioned.TWO OTHER SUBPLOTS THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN SCRAPPEDThe magic seed:  Another subplot that makes no sense is that Noah needs a magic seed from Methuselah in order to immediately grow a forest so he can have wood for the ark, because the entire land has been laid waste because of Tubal-cain.  As if it's possible in a world before huge factories and nuclear weapons to completely eliminate all life in entire regions?  Where are the rest of the sections of the world?  Is God going to destroy everything because Tubal-cain's settlement trashed a certain part of the planet?  And are the only people just Noah's small family and a settlement led by Tubal-cain?  There are plenty of other areas of the world which haven't been destroyed, yet humans as a whole are bad because Tubal-cain has an especially cavalier attitude about animal life and plants' ecosystems.  Noah himself doesn't show any concern in the movie about how to preserve those special kinds of trees after he cuts 'em down after using the magic seed to grow a forest.The snakeskin:  And what's with the snakeskin from the Devil being some kind of family heirloom?  Would you want to wear an evil artifact on you right after you get through the global flood?  So many plot points make no sense in this messed up movie!CASTINGAnthony Hopkins and Ray Winstone, playing Methuselah and Tubal-cain, respectively, gave me my few laughs in the movie.  Methuselah gets covered by a flood as he gets his last wish, to be satisfied with some berries which he was talking about from early on in the movie.  Tubal-cain has excellent swagger, and I found myself rooting for him some because I love Ray Winstone's acting.  Russell Crowe played the Noah character more darkly than anyone else could, which is what he was supposed to do, in keeping with the director's wishes.  Emma Watson as his daughter-in-law and Jennifer Connelly as his wife played their parts strongly.  The script was the problem, not the acting.",2,"Serious weaknesses because it detaches the story from its Jewish, God-focused roots; some plot developments don't function well",1396656000,"04 5,

Darren Aronofsky made a bold choice to choose a project that could have been both a critical failure and a condemned piece of blasphemy. With a fresh vision, he took an old and tired story and turned it into something exciting, relatable, and visually breathtaking. In Aronofsky's version of Noah, spirits in the form of giant rock creatures help build the ark, an epic fight ensues between Tubal-cain's army and the rock creatures, and it contains the single most stunning creation of Earth sequence in film history. As a visual and sonic spectacle, it's essentially a masterpiece. That said, much of the film's drama comes off as very 'Hollywood' and melodramatic. Perhaps it's impossible to make a biblical story that is in no way histrionic, as exaggerated storytelling is deeply engrained in the movie genre and in the stories themselves. The performances, as stagy as they can be, are pretty great. Russell Crowe and Ray Winstone are both powerful, and Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson, and Logan Lerman are well-suited for their supporting roles. It's a relatively long film, and it does slow down significantly after the grand battle sequence, but Noah is always a visual feast that offers an audience a new take on a familiar story that beats out many of the biblical epics of recent years.",4,"For Moviegoers, Not Devout Christians",1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,1356,"['biblical', 'story', 'Noah', 'ark', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'made', 'bold', 'choice', 'choose', 'project', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'critical', 'failure', 'condemned', 'piece', 'blasphemy', 'fresh', 'vision', 'took', 'old', 'tired', 'story', 'turned', 'something', 'exciting', 'relatable', 'visually', 'breathtaking', 'Aronofsky', 'version', 'Noah', 'form', 'giant', 'rock', 'creatures', 'help', 'build', 'ark', 'epic', 'fight', 'ensues', 'Tubal-cain', 'army', 'rock', 'creatures', 'single', 'most', 'stunning', 'creation', 'Earth', 'sequence', 'film', 'history', 'visual', 'sonic', 'spectacle', 'essentially', 'masterpiece', 'said', 'much', 'film', 'drama', 'off', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'Perhaps', 'impossible', 'make', 'biblical', 'story', 'way', 'histrionic', 'exaggerated', 'storytelling', 'deeply', 'engrained', 'movie', 'genre', 'stories', 'performances', 'as', 'stagy', 'can', 'be', 'are', 'pretty', 'great', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'are', 'powerful', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'are', 'well-suited', 'supporting', 'roles', 'relatively', 'long', 'film', 'slow', 'down', 'significantly', 'grand', 'battle', 'sequence', 'Noah', 'always', 'visual', 'feast', 'audience', 'new', 'take', 'familiar', 'story', 'out', 'many', 'biblical', 'epics', 'recent', 'years']",N/A

IT does not seem like this film knew WHAT it was WANTING to do.It starts off with some Biblical history like Adam and Even in the Garden of Eden...but perverts that to a degree. Then it talks about the children of Adam and Eve being Cain and Able and Shem; and shows with PUPPETRY shadows that Cain slew Able and the set about to wipe off the face of the Earth all other people not descended from him. WITH the help of angels whose sole purpose was to help Cain's group...and not the other's groups...because they saw some goodness in Cain's group.

A pair of every living creature housed within a vast ship made of ""gopher wood.""  Beyond the question of one's faith, it is hard to imagine a person not knowing this story or at least having a version of it in his or her head.  Here it is interpreted on film by director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler) as a mega-budget action/adventure spectacle and also as a meditation on, among other concerns, the environment and the concept of justice.  Russell Crowe is an able Noah:  ever a source of cinematic fury and grit, he can create this type of bearded monument to the macho and the mad with ease, though there is never a sense he is challenged despite the iconic nature of the role.  The overall result is ambitious and not without a certain objective interest in regard to its production and how it is received around the world, yet, as a film, as an intended entertainment, it is uneven and at times even unpleasant.Changes to the story as presented in Genesis, or rather details and tensions inserted to turn it into a feature-length film, have generated furious debate.  In my opinion, as an atheist who finds the story of Noah intriguing without believing it to be true in any way, shape, or form, a few of the changes are positive and a few are negative.  The worst:  the conception and inclusion of angels turned stone giants named the Watchers, beings who aid Noah's construction and engage in a brutal fight sequence as the flood begins.  These computer-generated monster-protectors play as if they tramped their way out of second-rate deleted scenes from the Lord of the Rings or Pirates of the Caribbean franchises, and I could never invest in their involvement in the storyline.  A more rewarding alteration:  Tubal-Cain, a smith (descended from the first murderer) briefly mentioned in the Bible, is played by Ray Winstone as a self-proclaimed king who refuses to be stamped out by the Creator to whom the stoic Noah is so beholden, at least not without a bone-crushing, throat-slicing fight.  The way his desperate urge toward self-preservation manifests itself is riveting, as is the way he contends with others or seduces them to his side.In general, aforementioned stone giants notwithstanding, this is a film which rouses in its large moments, but falls short in regard to more fundamental elements, including character development.  A scene in which Noah spins a campfire tale regarding God's creation of the universe results in a psychedelic time-lapse montage placing Adam and Eve within an evolutionary context, and the result is as gorgeous as it is provocative.  This is a bold and neat gambit.  Yet, on the other hand, consider Noah's sons, including Ham and Shem, and how thinly conceived they are.  They are important characters, yet there is not a single significant moment of interaction to reveal to the audience the ever-evolving dimension of love and resentment so often shared by brothers and sisters.  Portrayed by porcelain stud Douglas Booth, Shem in particular is a nonentity and cipher.  And so it goes with Noah the film:  amazing visuals and moments of rousing acting give way to hamstrung dramatic beats and underdeveloped characters and ideas.",2,"An ambiitous, but flawed epic by Aronofsky",1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,3255,"['Noah', 'God', 'deluge', 'destroy', 'world', 'then', 'start', 'anew', 'A', 'pair', 'living', 'creature', 'housed', 'vast', 'ship', 'made', 'gopher', 'wood', 'question', 'one', 'faith', 'hard', 'imagine', 'person', 'not', 'knowing', 'story', 'least', 'having', 'version', 'head', 'Here', 'interpreted', 'film', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'Wrestler', 'mega-budget', 'action/adventure', 'spectacle', 'also', 'meditation', 'other', 'concerns', 'environment', 'concept', 'justice', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'able', 'Noah', 'ever', 'source', 'cinematic', 'fury', 'grit', 'can', 'create', 'type', 'bearded', 'monument', 'macho', 'mad', 'ease', 'never', 'sense', 'challenged', 'iconic', 'nature', 'role', 'overall', 'result', 'ambitious', 'not', 'certain', 'objective', 'interest', 'regard', 'production', 'how', 'received', 'world', 'yet', 'film', 'intended', 'entertainment', 'uneven', 'times', 'even', 'unpleasant.Changes', 'story', 'presented', 'Genesis', 'rather', 'details', 'tensions', 'inserted', 'turn', 'feature-length', 'film', 'have', 'generated', 'furious', 'debate', 'opinion', 'atheist', 'who', 'story', 'Noah', 'intriguing', 'believing', 'be', 'true', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'few', 'changes', 'are', 'positive', 'few', 'are', 'negative', 'worst', 'conception', 'inclusion', 'angels', 'turned', 'stone', 'giants', 'named', 'Watchers', 'beings', 'who', 'aid', 'Noah', 'construction', 'engage', 'brutal', 'fight', 'sequence', 'flood', 'computer-generated', 'monster-protectors', 'play', 'tramped', 'way', 'second-rate', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'franchises', 'could', 'never', 'invest', 'involvement', 'storyline', 'more', 'rewarding', 'alteration', 'Tubal-Cain', 'smith', 'descended', 'first', 'murderer', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'Bible', 'played', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'self-proclaimed', 'king', 'who', 'be', 'stamped', 'out', 'Creator', 'whom', 'stoic', 'Noah', 'so', 'beholden', 'least', 'not', 'bone-crushing', 'throat-slicing', 'fight', 'way', 'desperate', 'urge', 'self-preservation', 'manifests', 'riveting', 'way', 'others', 'seduces', 'side.In', 'general', 'aforementioned', 'stone', 'giants', 'notwithstanding', 'film', 'large', 'moments', 'short', 'regard', 'more', 'fundamental', 'elements', 'including', 'character', 'development', 'scene', 'Noah', 'campfire', 'tale', 'regarding', 'God', 'creation', 'universe', 'results', 'psychedelic', 'time-lapse', 'montage', 'placing', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'evolutionary', 'context', 'result', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'provocative', 'bold', 'neat', 'gambit', 'other', 'hand', 'consider', 'Noah', 'sons', 'including', 'Ham', 'Shem', 'how', 'thinly', 'conceived', 'are', 'are', 'important', 'characters', 'yet', 'not', 'single', 'significant', 'moment', 'interaction', 'reveal', 'audience', 'ever-evolving', 'dimension', 'love', 'resentment', 'so', 'often', 'shared', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'Portrayed', 'porcelain', 'stud', 'Douglas', 'Booth', 'Shem', 'particular', 'nonentity', 'cipher', 'Noah', 'film', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'moments', 'rousing', 'acting', 'give', 'way', 'hamstrung', 'dramatic', 'beats', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'ideas']",N/A

In the first hour or so, director Darren Aronofsky sets up an intriguing premise: that the entire idea of the flood is God's revenge on humankind for having destroyed the world.  There is a strong sense of contemporaneity about this message, especially when we consider issues such as global warming and environmentalism.  As Noah, Russell Crowe comes across as a convincing servant of the Creator, someone charged with the responsibility of implementing His word, yet unable to exercise free will.  Despite living a pious life, he has to preside over the destruction of a sinful world so that a New World might be created.  Noah's dilemma is obvious, especially when we observe the way in which he is concerned for his family's future, even the wayward son Ham (Logan Lenman).  As his grandfather Methuselah, Anthony Hopkins comes across as equally dedicated to the divine cause - despite living in comparative squalor, he finds enough to sustain himself in the earth, rather than having to rely on anyone.  Once the flood occurs - in a stunning sequence of special effects - the film falls apart: director Aronofsky seems less interested in exploring the consequences of human action, and the ways in which it can traduce God's word, as seen, for instance in the relationship between Noah and his perpetual adversary Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone, a plausibly tooth-gnashing villain), and resorts instead to a family melodrama involving Noah, his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), his eldest son Shem (Douglas Booth) and adopted daughter Ila (Emma Watson).  The two leading actresses give performances that can most charitably be described as undistinguished, devoid of light and shade.  The film ends happily - for Noah's family, at least - with humankind re-assuming its position at the center of all activity.  According to Hollywood logic, it seems that even the Creator has to take a supporting role.",2,"A Movie of Two Halves - Good Beginning, Then Falls Apart",1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,1969,"['What', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'up', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'entire', 'idea', 'flood', 'God', 'revenge', 'humankind', 'having', 'destroyed', 'world', 'strong', 'sense', 'contemporaneity', 'message', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'issues', 'such', 'global', 'warming', 'environmentalism', 'Noah', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'across', 'convincing', 'servant', 'Creator', 'someone', 'charged', 'responsibility', 'implementing', 'word', 'yet', 'unable', 'exercise', 'free', 'will', 'living', 'pious', 'life', 'preside', 'destruction', 'sinful', 'world', 'New', 'World', 'might', 'be', 'created', 'Noah', 'dilemma', 'obvious', 'especially', 'when', 'observe', 'way', 'concerned', 'family', 'future', 'even', 'wayward', 'son', 'Ham', 'Logan', 'Lenman', 'grandfather', 'Methuselah', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'equally', 'dedicated', 'divine', 'cause', 'living', 'comparative', 'squalor', 'enough', 'sustain', 'earth', 'rather', 'having', 'rely', 'anyone', 'flood', 'stunning', 'sequence', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'apart', 'director', 'Aronofsky', 'less', 'interested', 'exploring', 'consequences', 'human', 'action', 'ways', 'can', 'traduce', 'God', 'word', 'seen', 'instance', 'relationship', 'Noah', 'perpetual', 'adversary', 'Tubal-cain', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'plausibly', 'tooth-gnashing', 'villain', 'resorts', 'instead', 'family', 'melodrama', 'involving', 'Noah', 'wife', 'Naameh', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'eldest', 'son', 'Shem', 'Douglas', 'Booth', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Ila', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'two', 'leading', 'actresses', 'give', 'performances', 'can', 'most', 'charitably', 'be', 'described', 'undistinguished', 'devoid', 'light', 'shade', 'film', 'happily', 'Noah', 'family', 'least', 'humankind', 're-assuming', 'position', 'center', 'activity', 'According', 'Hollywood', 'logic', 'even', 'Creator', 'take', 'supporting', 'role']",N/A

Any movie adaptation was going to have to find a way to fill out a two hour movie. In some respects, Director Darren Aronofsky did fine. The movie is well cast, with Russell Crowe as a determined and devout Noah, Jennifer Connelly as his dutiful wife, Emma Watson as an adopted daughter, Anthony Hopkins as Noah's grandfather Methuselah, and Ray Winstone as the leader of a band of roving scavengers. If you've seen the trailer, you know the cinematography is quite good. The Icelandic location shooting is dramatic, and those portions of the movie which stick to the original storyline work fairly well.In some other respects, the movie does less well. The Biblical story of Noah is a straightforward morality tale about mankind. Aronofsky insisted on respinning it as a not very convincing environmental cautionary tale about a pre-industrial age. He also chose to rewrite the story of Noah and his sons and their respective wives in order to invent a disturbing and almost lethal family drama inside the Ark. At the end, the message of the movie is quite confusing.Judging from other reviews, viewers with no particular commitment to the original story of Noah like the movie.

I think Paramount made a huge mistake hiring an atheist director and writer to tell this story.  The disclaimer they have been running at the end of all the marketing pieces on TV and radio should have been warning enough, but I have been looking forward to seeing this for a couple years.  The performances are solid (the only positive thing I can say about it), but depicting the story of Noah the way they did was incredibly frustrating.  I don't mind when film makers take liberties, but take liberties where there isn't any written record of what happened.  There are numerous things in Genesis leading up to the story of Noah that are incredible that rarely get touched on by the Christian church that could have still made this very interesting and surprising in places.  That didn't happen.  When Noah was running around trying to kill his Granddaughters I was done.  I haven't watched a movie in years that left me feeling complete disgust like this one did.  It will be unfortunate if Hollywood takes the box office success of this film to mean that it's OK to annihilate bible stories in this manner.  Paramount Studios would make even the most dishonest used car salesman blush the way they marketed this film to the faith based audience.  It was incredibly disingenuous to name the movie Noah when so little from the Genesis story is even in the film.  The fact that some pastors are publicly endorsing it is probably the most troubling thing of all.  If you really want to see this film, but don' want to support it financially; wait for it to hit home video in late July and rent it from your local library.  I really hope ""Exodus"" when it is released later this year doesn't make the same mistake.  I will wait for what others have to say before I watch that one on opening weekend.

1599881,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B009NNM828,FNDNreview,"[6, 12]","Historical renditions can be a freighting topic to tackle in regards to getting the facts straight, especially when a writer/director is attempting to depict a specific series of events from the Bible.  Over the years, there have been multitudes of films portraying Moses and Jesus Christ &#8211; two prophets of God, both of whom play a prominent role in the Book of God.  There are several other individuals that are also supremely important to the Bible, yet individuals like David, Peter, or Paul, are apparently not provocative enough to warrant a big screen treatment.  In fact, it&#8217;s quite astonishing that it&#8217;s taken this long for a filmmaker to have the desire to create a feature about Noah and his ark.  Perhaps it&#8217;s simply a matter of writers and directors not wanting to deal with the abundance of controversy that accompanies these stories.  But, it&#8217;s obvious Darren Afronofsky is not a man that shies away from a project due to controversy.Directed by Darren Afronofsky (Black Swan, The Wrestler), Noah stars Russell Crowe as Noah, the final pre-flood Patriarch of God.  As a young boy, Noah witnessed the death of his father at the hands of a tyrant, leaving him as the only remaining descendant of Seth (the final son of Adam and Eve).  While the descendants of Cain (also son of Adam and Eve) pillaged and plundered the Earth, Noah remained devoted to his creator &#8211; eventually marrying his wife, Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) and having three sons, Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman), and, Japheth (Leo McHugh), while also taking in an adoptive daughter, Ila (Emma Watson).Noah begins having dreams, which he believes are messages from the creator &#8211; indications that a planet-wide cleansing will wash away all land-based life, leaving only a small remnant of the planet&#8217;s population.  These dreams prompt Noah to start construction on an ark that will be large enough to protect two of each of the world&#8217;s species (animals, reptiles, etc.) in order to repopulate the Earth after the great flood.  Noah and his family are aided by a group of giants, called the watchers &#8211; angels forced to live out their days on Earth after defying their creator, but the production of the giant ark gains the attention of the Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone), the so-called king of man.Naturally, there&#8217;s absolutely no need to give away too many details about the plot progression, since the majority of us already know full well how the story concludes.  Regardless, Noah takes on the typical three-chapter mannerism of storytelling, the first of which shows Noah interpreting his dreams and then moving his family to an area where the ark will be built.  This also brings in Anthony Hopkins&#8217; character, Methuselah &#8211; Noah&#8217;s grandfather, who is established as the grand old wizard that has endless knowledge of seemingly everything, but works only in riddles and magic.  And, despite the fact that Hopkins&#8217; role is limited to only a handful of scenes, he brings brief moments of humor and leaves an all-important lasting impression on the outcome of the film.The second stanza vastly incorporates the film&#8217;s villain, portrayed by the flawless efforts of Ray Winstone.  Although he is a commanding character to be sure, he&#8217;s not a traditional villain in the sense that he has evil intentions on the brain or in his heart.  In this particular case, he reacts in the same exact manner that the majority of humanity would react if a scenario like this were to happen today, and that&#8217;s simple:  survive by any means necessary.  But, when God has his mind made up and is dead-set on washing the world clean, do you really think the actions of one man stand a chance against a force that is so great that no one could ever fully understand?  Exactly.  Sorry, that&#8217;s not a spoiler &#8211; that&#8217;s just common sense.In the final act, copious amounts of drama take full command of this film.  Once aboard the well-constructed vessel, Noah must come to grips with the fact that all mankind must come to an end, and of course, that includes the lives of he and his family.  Naturally, news of that nature is bound to drive any man a little crazy, creating a slew of standout scenes for Russell Crowe and one particularly emotional scene that allows Jennifer Connelly to steal the show.  Emma Watson also takes full advantage of her scenes, proving that she&#8217;s grown into a fine young actress (and outgrown Harry Potter) with enough potential to fill her shelves with an endless amount of shiny Hollywood awards &#8211; assuming she decides to get serious and take the right roles.Clearly, the casting choices for Noah worked out to the film&#8217;s benefit.  Still, the CGI elements are far more worthy of conversation than the acting.  But, like any massive Hollywood production, you can&#8217;t create an apocalyptic epic without blanketing the screen with special efforts.  While the book of Genesis does mention giants, it doesn&#8217;t go into the amount of detail that Aronofsky implements with his rock creatures &#8211; which are undeniably similar to Transformers.  If you don&#8217;t like staying through the credits, the voices of those rock creatures will sound familiar &#8211; voiced notably by Nick Nolte and Frank Langella.Overall, Noah is a grand experiment that can easily be best described as an ambitious epic with only the best of intentions.  Sadly, not everyone is going to see this film in the same light as writer and director Darren Aronofsky.  The oversized $150 million (in that ballpark) budget sets the bar high for a production that I fear will have disappointing returns, not because it&#8217;s poorly structured, badly written, or any of the usual reasons movies fail.  Big name actors like Russell Crowe, Anthony Hopkins, and Emma Watson are a welcome sight in a risky endeavor such as this, yet the polarizing subject matter vastly overshadows the terrific acting and stellar visuals.  Will you enjoy Noah?  That seems to be the question on everyone&#8217;s mind, so the best way to answer that question is to encourage you to take the risk and lend your time to a beautifully constructed feature and try to keep an open mind that it is a Hollywood production and not a minute-by-minute literal depiction.GRADE:  B+FNDNreview.com",4,"'Noah' polarizing, yet ambitious adventure",1396828800,"04 7,

1599886,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,B009NNM828,Get Serious,"[8, 21]","OK...so how can you even make a film about something which has no proof and may not have even happened?  The Bible has been rewritten hundreds of times, each time perhaps absorbing the writer's propaganda. In other words this is a fantasy. So what that means is that writers can interpret and define it any way they want to and suggest a possible scenario.  The overall suggestion is that Man had become evil and God decided to exterminate him. This rendition makes Noah an instrument of overall extermination. The film goes into extreme CGI detail in showing the gruesome deaths of thousands. It has often been said that God was not empathetic and he killed humans who displeased him with little remorse. Depending on which Christian propaganda house you subscribe to, you will have a different viewpoint. Let's look at some of the accepted ritualistic beliefs of various organizations:*Man was made in God's image. This is a nice, trite supposition to believe that the human body and mind are a clone of God's. Other belief systems believe the human body was made the way it is, because it's easily repaired and can be utilized as a slave source. In another rendition, humans were put on planet Earth as a food source for returning alien races. You make up your own rendition. Man spends half his time wondering what his purpose is and wondering why he's here on this planet in the first place, but he never comes up with an answer, because nobody knows.*As far as Planet Earth is concerned, it is obvious that this planet was designed to house a humanoid race. It sits the exact distance from our star to properly warm us, but not burn us up. It has a 23.5 degree axis tilt to give us the exactly perfect four seasonal existence. It rotates one turn every 24 hours to allow humans to recharge in the dark. It orbits our star once every 365 days to assist the seasonal design. It is three-quarters water, a necessity for a humanoid population in providing foodstuffs and hydration. It maintains an ozone layer to protect the humanoid race from deathly dangerous ultra-violet radiation.20% of humans (Or are they infiltrated aliens?) are purely evil and start all the wars that kill millions of people and this goes back five thousand years to the first known written language. 20% of humans are creative and actually build things and infrastructures. The rest are sheep being swayed by propaganda and whatever base instincts dictate and they follow the herd.There is a history of a flood on the planet (actually several floods) separated by between 3,500 and 5,000 years each.  Choose your scenario.*God did it to wipe out the human race because they were evil.*A meteor hit, causing a massive tsunami, exterminating all life.*The shadow planet-sun Niburu (which orbits clockwise, while all the planets orbit counter-clockwise) appears every 3-5,000 years and 'washes' the planet, uprooting the oceans, tearing the magma, reversing the polar fields and exterminating every living thing on the surface (except birds and fish).And this is actually set in place to clean the planet every few millennia.Biblical-based stories like this always make us question our existence and if God (or the alien mother race) is coming back to demand an accounting.

Additionally, we have Noah, stressing over his adopted daughter's baby, who isn't on the passenger manifest and so therefore should be killed?

It's as if the makers of this film found the whole matter of the animals a major annoyance, and threw it in reluctantly.Anyway, the more I think about the movie the more I dislike it.

Now it's clear from some of the reviews that some of the nay-sayers of this film CLEARLY went to this film to complain about it, or just didn't go to see it at all and are parrotting what they've read about the film. Complaining about not mentioning God (instead, to not alienate people of other faiths, they used the term ""Creator"" which was the term used for God in those days), to the ""socialist progressive undercurrent"" of the film (which doesn't exist), or that Noah is portrayed as a flawed, angry and violent human man as oppossed to the friendly ""Let's get two of every animal and build an ark and have a happy time"" children's picture-book telling of the tale.But what are you really expecting from the director of PI (super-indie B&W; film), REQUIEM FOR A DREAM (Major Indie drug addiction Depress-o-thon), THE FOUNTAIN (ultra-high-concept sci-fi art film), and BLACK SWAN (psychosexual hallucinatory thriller)?!??!? Aronofsky is an auteur. He's not a journeyman director. He's going to take whatever story interests and excites him and put his own spin on it.NOAH is not perfect. It's a somewhat flawed film with an epic scale that is, per usual of Aronofsky, visually arresting. Russell Crowe doesn't quite fit into this role as easily as he might have in the past, and Jennifer Connelly, despite being a great actress, feels a little stilted. Emma Watson is fitting into her post-HARRY POTTER career quite nicely in this film as well as work in films like MY WEEK WITH MARILYN and THE BLING RING. Ray Winstone is a little over-the-top here, but kind of fun to watch, and Anthony Hopkins is decidedly under-the-top yet again in a role that solely demands expository dialogue.However, the performances seem perfunctory to the visual tale that Aronofsky is telling. He wanted to tell this tale on the scale of the biblical tales of Cecil B. Demille, just without the all-ages stamp and all-star casting that caused people to flock to see THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, but most specifically, he wanted to tell a story that didn't have to adhere to every single sentence in the Bible. As with most of the Bible (and here comes the hate-mail), this is a story subject to interpretation, and his visual interpretation of this film is terrifically exciting. Although one would ask if Aronofsky was just making a film that not only was his vision, but was also to kind of troll the devout Christians. I would bet on mostly the former, and perhaps a little of the latter.Although, that just won't cut it in this day and age. I was hoping that we would have evolved as audiences since 1988, and the firey, hateful rhetoric caused by Martin Scorsese's absolutely brilliant LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, but as reaction to this film has proven that we really haven't. Many people don't want ""interpretations"" of biblical stories; they want their biblical stories to be treated as totally literal with no room for interpretation. No critical thinking; no questioning.Makes you wonder what kind of God they're worshipping, or what some churches are teaching. I went to eight years of Sunday School (although that ended about 27 years ago, when I was confirmed), but the teachers never said ""This is TRUTH, and to deny that is a sin!"". They taught us that knowledge of truth and having faith CAN go hand in hand, but don't ALWAYS have to.",4,Going into this film with an open mind just might be what most viewers need.,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,3544,"['been', 'LOT', 'noise', 'made', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'rather', 'progressive', 'interpretation', 'biblical', 'tale', 'NOAH', 'primarily', 'pundits', 'Fox', 'News', 'citizens', 'GlennBeckistan', 'Religious', 'Right', 'Now', 'clear', 'reviews', 'nay-sayers', 'film', 'CLEARLY', 'went', 'film', 'complain', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'are', 'parrotting', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'film', 'Complaining', 'not', 'mentioning', 'God', 'instead', 'not', 'alienate', 'people', 'other', 'faiths', 'used', 'term', 'Creator', 'was', 'term', 'used', 'God', 'days', 'socialist', 'progressive', 'undercurrent', 'film', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Noah', 'portrayed', 'flawed', 'angry', 'violent', 'human', 'man', 'oppossed', 'friendly', 'Let', 'get', 'two', 'animal', 'build', 'ark', 'have', 'happy', 'time', 'children', 'picture-book', 'telling', 'tale.But', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'expecting', 'director', 'PI', 'super-indie', 'B', 'W', 'film', 'REQUIEM', 'FOR', 'A', 'DREAM', 'Major', 'Indie', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Depress-o-thon', 'FOUNTAIN', 'ultra-high-concept', 'sci-fi', 'art', 'film', 'BLACK', 'SWAN', 'psychosexual', 'hallucinatory', 'thriller', 'Aronofsky', 'auteur', 'not', 'journeyman', 'director', 'going', 'take', 'story', 'interests', 'put', 'own', 'spin', 'it.NOAH', 'not', 'perfect', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'film', 'epic', 'scale', 'usual', 'Aronofsky', 'visually', 'arresting', 'Russell', 'Crowe', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'role', 'as', 'easily', 'might', 'have', 'past', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'being', 'great', 'actress', 'little', 'stilted', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'fitting', 'post-HARRY', 'POTTER', 'career', 'quite', 'nicely', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'films', 'MY', 'WEEK', 'WITH', 'MARILYN', 'THE', 'BLING', 'RING', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'here', 'kind', 'fun', 'watch', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'decidedly', 'under-the-top', 'yet', 'again', 'role', 'solely', 'expository', 'dialogue.However', 'performances', 'seem', 'perfunctory', 'visual', 'tale', 'Aronofsky', 'telling', 'wanted', 'tell', 'tale', 'scale', 'biblical', 'tales', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'Demille', 'just', 'all-ages', 'stamp', 'all-star', 'casting', 'caused', 'people', 'flock', 'see', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'most', 'specifically', 'wanted', 'tell', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'adhere', 'single', 'sentence', 'Bible', 'most', 'Bible', 'here', 'hate-mail', 'story', 'subject', 'interpretation', 'visual', 'interpretation', 'film', 'terrifically', 'exciting', 'one', 'would', 'ask', 'Aronofsky', 'was', 'just', 'making', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'vision', 'was', 'also', 'kind', 'troll', 'devout', 'Christians', 'would', 'bet', 'mostly', 'former', 'perhaps', 'little', 'latter.Although', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cut', 'day', 'age', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'have', 'evolved', 'audiences', '1988', 'firey', 'hateful', 'rhetoric', 'caused', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'OF', 'CHRIST', 'reaction', 'film', 'proven', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'interpretations', 'biblical', 'stories', 'want', 'biblical', 'stories', 'be', 'treated', 'totally', 'literal', 'room', 'interpretation', 'critical', 'thinking', 'questioning.Makes', 'wonder', 'what', 'kind', 'God', ""'re"", 'worshipping', 'what', 'churches', 'are', 'teaching', 'went', 'eight', 'years', 'Sunday', 'School', 'ended', 'about', '27', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'confirmed', 'teachers', 'never', 'said', 'TRUTH', 'deny', 'sin', 'taught', 'knowledge', 'truth', 'having', 'faith', 'CAN', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'ALWAYS', 'have']",N/A
1599893,A10H47FMW8NHII,B009NNM828,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[2, 10]","There are scores of fables throughout the world that describe an apocalyptic flood with a lone survivor who repopulates Earth. From the Seminoles to the Senegalese, from the Mayan to the Malaysian, from the Inuit to the Egyptian, these are passed down through the ages with spooky similarities.As this movie began, it occurred to me that some of the kerfuffle from the fundamentalists might have been avoided if writer/director Darren Aronofsky had used something other than the Judeo-Christian version for inspiration. Then I realized he used the familiar names as a sort of shorthand to avoid the need for lengthy explanation. No matter what his rationale, by the time I left the theater, I felt I had been taken through all of Genesis (with generous doses of artistic license: the animals are computer generated images with only a slight tip of the hat toward realism). Do NOT trouble yourself with this film if you believe in a literal interpretation of the Judeo-Christian Bible.You see:* Russell Crowe (&#34;Winter's Tale&#34;) as Noah, the paterfamilias who gets one upsetting message after another from The Creator. He's doing his best to obey; it is clear that he is the world's first conservationist.* Jennifer Connelly (&#34;The Dilemma&#34;) as his wife Naameh, who seems part loving wife and mother, and part shaman (she paces through the ark swinging a sort of incense burner which anesthetizes the creatures).* Anthony Hopkins (&#34;RED 2&#34;) is Methuselah (see, I told you &#34;familiar names&#34;), sitting on his mountain, who wants to enjoy the taste of berries one more time.* Logan Lerman (&#34;Percy Jackson&#34; franchise) does some of the heavy lifting as Ham, who asks the obvious question, &#34;Where will I find a wife if all of mankind is wiped out?&#34;* Emma Watson (&#34;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34;) is Ila, their adopted daughter, gravely wounded when she was a child.* Douglas Booth (&#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34;) is Shem, the lucky son who gets the girl.* Ray Winstone (&#34;Hugo&#34;) is Tubal-Cain a descendant of Cain, perpetrator of the world's first fratricide. He says &#34;I am a Man&#34; and knows he has dominion over the animals.This PG-13 movie tries to cover too many issues and relies on computer generated imaging (rock warriors, anyone?) for all of the action. In my opinion, this only detracts from a fairly involving story, if only they had focused on it. Connelly, Crowe and Lehrman are all three very capable actors, so they brought more to the table than this script deserved.I saw this in a theater with closed captions. I suspect I would have missed some of the dialogue if I hadn't worn the glasses. There were some very quiet, murmured moments.

If you&#8217;re confused, welcome to the club.  The producers of Noah, obviously decided that the &#8220;kitchen sink&#8221; approach was the way to go with this movie.  The mixture of a little of this, little of that made my head ache.  This was back in stone age times&#8230;so why was there metal armor and forged steel weapons?  And gun powder wasn&#8217;t invented until the 9th century by the Chinese;  and, obviously,  there were no gun-type weapons before that either.  Or at least it&#8217;s obvious to everyone except the writers of Noah, who, for lack of gunpowder, simply wrote in little, glowing rocks that explode when you smash them &#8211; which is why in one scene you see a guy firing off a &#8220;gun&#8221; that looks like it&#8217;s made of bamboo (now if they can forge armor, how come their gun was made out of bamboo?).  And in another scene my friend who was watching the movie with me swears she saw one of the marauders caring a shield made out of what looked like corrugated tin.And I won&#8217;t even go into the fact that the writers got EVERY single part of the Biblical story wrong.  Those of you not familiar with the Bible account won&#8217;t pick up on that, but those of you who are, expect to sit in your seats, scratching your head in utter bewilderment and saying, &#8220;Where the hell are they getting this crap from?!&#8221;Let&#8217;s move on to the special effects and the CGI.  You would expect that would be the movie&#8217;s strong point &#8211; lots of well done, impressive CGI, especially of the flood.  Eh, not so much.  First on the scene are the rock monsters (a.k.a fallen angels), that looked down right cartoonish.  Everyone in the audience was snickering.  Then you get to the big moment when the flood starts&#8230; and then you quickly go on to all the nonsensical family arguing&#8230;because despite what you would think, the flood itself is more of a footnote in the movie.  The main theme is the whole &#8220;humans are evil, do we even deserve to survive&#8221; question, which is debated and screamed about endlessly by Noah and his family.After the movie&#8230;after we finished rolling our eyes and laughing about how bad it was&#8230;my friend says, &#8220;I so almost got up and left half way through.&#8221;  I looked at her and exclaimed, &#8220;OMG, me too!&#8221;  So if you find yourself halfway through this movie and bored out of your mind, don&#8217;t feel bad about leaving&#8230;chances are the person you&#8217;re with is feeling the same way.",1,One of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time.,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,2676,"['Rock', 'monsters', 'magical', 'fire-producing', 'rocks', '8216', '8217', 'device', 'made', 'bamboo', 'metal', 'armor', 'crazy', 'armadillo-dog', 'thingies', 'Noah', 'vegan', '8217', 're', 'confused', 'welcome', 'club', 'producers', 'Noah', 'obviously', 'decided', '8220', 'sink', '8221', 'approach', 'was', 'way', 'go', 'movie', 'mixture', 'little', 'little', 'made', 'head', 'ache', 'was', 'back', 'stone', 'age', 'times', '8230', 'why', 'was', 'metal', 'armor', 'forged', 'steel', 'weapons', 'gun', 'powder', 'wasn', '8217', 'invented', '9th', 'century', 'Chinese', 'obviously', 'were', 'gun-type', 'weapons', 'least', '8217', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'writers', 'Noah', 'who', 'lack', 'gunpowder', 'simply', 'wrote', 'little', 'glowing', 'rocks', 'explode', 'when', 'smash', '8211', 'why', 'one', 'scene', 'see', 'guy', 'firing', 'off', '8220', '8221', '8217', 'made', 'bamboo', 'now', 'can', 'forge', 'armor', 'how', 'come', 'gun', 'was', 'made', 'bamboo', 'scene', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'saw', 'one', 'marauders', 'caring', 'shield', 'made', 'what', 'looked', 'corrugated', 'tin.And', 'won', '8217', 't', 'even', 'go', 'fact', 'writers', 'got', 'EVERY', 'single', 'part', 'Biblical', 'story', 'wrong', 'not', 'familiar', 'Bible', 'account', 'won', '8217', 'pick', 'up', 'who', 'are', 'expect', 'sit', 'seats', 'scratching', 'head', 'utter', 'bewilderment', 'saying', '8220', 'Where', 'hell', 'are', 'getting', 'crap', '8221', 'Let', '8217', 's', 'move', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'would', 'expect', 'would', 'be', 'movie', '8217', 'strong', 'point', '8211', 'lots', 'well', 'done', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'especially', 'flood', 'Eh', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'First', 'scene', 'are', 'rock', 'monsters', 'a.k.a', 'fallen', 'angels', 'looked', 'down', 'right', 'cartoonish', 'Everyone', 'audience', 'was', 'snickering', 'Then', 'get', 'big', 'moment', 'when', 'flood', '8230', 'then', 'quickly', 'go', 'nonsensical', 'family', 'arguing', '8230', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'flood', 'more', 'footnote', 'movie', 'main', 'theme', 'whole', '8220', 'humans', 'are', 'evil', 'do', 'even', 'deserve', 'survive', '8221', 'question', 'debated', 'screamed', 'endlessly', 'Noah', 'family.After', 'movie', '8230', 'finished', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'laughing', 'how', 'bad', 'was', '8230', 'friend', '8220', 'so', 'almost', 'got', 'up', 'left', 'way', 'through.', '8221', 'looked', 'exclaimed', '8220', 'OMG', 'too', '8221', 'find', 'halfway', 'movie', 'bored', 'mind', 'don', '8217', 'feel', 'bad', 'leaving', '8230', 'chances', 'are', 'person', '8217', 're', 'feeling', 'same', 'way']",N/A

Usually, in my opinion, movie creators cave in to religious authenticity in their fearful desire to attract and placate both truly and sanctimoniously devout people at the risk of turning out a bland, lifeless, predictable product.  These movie creators seem to concede that it&#8217;s just too damn hard to create both a respectful and exciting epic.  I argue that Aronofsky has succeeded in doing just that in &#8220;Noah&#8221;, and he&#8217;s an atheist to boot!The basic structure and components of the Old Testament mythological &#8220;Noah and the Flood&#8221; are largely intact.  Granted, the tale itself is relatively straightforward and skeletal, but this works to Aronofsky&#8217;s advantage because he can introduce various subplots and previously peripheral characters to flesh out and fortify the story and make it really feel like an epic without mangling the story beyond recognition.  As I see them, these are the steps Aronofsky took to achieve this:1) As other Amazon reviewers have noted, Aronofsky has taken a Tolkeinesque approach to this material, including showing desolate wastelands, fantastic characters, miraculous events, and a daunting quest from a supernatural figure called the Creator.2) Making Noah (Russell Crowe), a man charged by the Creator with saving the non-human world from an impending flood, not only a devout, Creator-heeding and family-loving man, but also a virile, resolute man of action who will do just about anything to carry out his divine mission.3) In a slight but not fatal deviation from the text, &#8220;Noah&#8221; introduces a subplot involving Noah&#8217;s second-oldest son Ham&#8217;s (Logan Lerman&#8217;s) struggle with asserting his manhood and avoiding a lonely bachelorhood.4) Introducing the misshapen Watchers (who look like Transformers with a granite exo-skeleton), who ARE referenced in the Bible, as former angels cast from Heaven for aiding sinful humanity (how Promethean!) and condemned to wear a rocky skin.  Despite their ordeal, several Watchers agree to help Noah with building the ark to carry the world&#8217;s animals and protecting the vessel from the rest of humanity.  No matter what you think, it&#8217;s an imaginative, impressive way of explaining how Noah and only a few family members could fashion and preserve such a colossal vessel.5) Including the aged but still lively patriarch Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins), Noah&#8217;s grandfather, who gives his sometimes confused grandson sage advice and moral support, and even aids Noah&#8217;s daughter-in-law and son Shem&#8217;s (Douglas Booth&#8217;s) wife Ila (Emma Watson) with a troubling family problem.  And in return, all Methuselah asks is to satisfy a berry jones.6) Adding the character of Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone), a ferociously warlike (and carnivorous) descendant of the world&#8217;s first murderer, Cain, and apparent leader of the sinful hordes who attempt to battle for passage into the ark.  When the hordes fail, Tubal-cain selfishly manages to stowaway on the ark and try to manipulate Ham&#8217;s frustration to avenge himself on archnemesis Noah.7) Exploring the extent of Noah&#8217;s religious zeal, which flirts with the rationalization that he and his family, including loyal, passionate but sturdy wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly, who reminds me a lot of Demi Moore), young Japheth, and even, shockingly, Ila&#8217;s newborn twins, must also die after saving the animals to fulfill the Creator&#8217;s mission.People may object to Aronofsky&#8217;s stylistic flourishes in Noah as being disrespectful to the Bible, unbelievable, or just plain silly.  I suppose arguments could be made for each of these viewpoints. Still, I feel that although &#8220;Noah&#8221; realizes and accepts that all Biblical/mythological stories relying on supernatural events can seem ridiculously hard to swallow, it ultimately adheres to the story&#8217;s spirit AND marvels and respects at all that the Creator (God) has made, and manages to be dynamic, rip-roaring, and surprising, too.P.S.:  My mother, who is a Greek Orthodox Christian, also approved of and enjoyed &#8220;Noah&#8221;.  Therefore, I respectfully recommend that &#8220;Noah&#8221; purists, religious or otherwise, relax and not be so resistant to the movie&#8217;s message.",4,Tolkeinesque Elements Flesh Out a Well-Known

1599905,A24UPY3K2IMZYV,B009NNM828,Joseph Elliott,"[128, 162]","I saw Noah a week ago at my local theater, and am just now able to write a level headed review about it. See, Noah is that type of movie that you either absolutely love, or downright hate. Its the kind of movie that makes people fiercely defensive of their opinions, that sparks widespread controversy. This is rare, as movies nowadays seem to be pretty tailored to their target audience. Most of the controversy is centered around whether or not the film is biblical. As a Christian who has read the bible, I feel the need to point out that the bible is very vague concerning the story of Noah. God has the only speaking part, and the feelings and experiences of Noah and his family are not shared with us. If the film ONLY included the text as it was written, it would be about half an hour, and very impersonal. Darren Aronofsky adds additional material because if he didn't, there wouldn't be a film. There wouldn't even be any characters, other then names. Now, a lot of the controversy concerns what he added, mainly the bit about the fallen angels. People seem very confused about this, shortsightedly likening them to ""Rock Transformers"". The Nephilim, as they are called, are mentioned in the Bible, as well as in the Book of Enoch (Enoch was the great grandfather of Noah), which is a Jewish telling of the flood that is separate from the one in the Bible. They are also referred to in the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is an ancient historical and mythological text containing the story of the flood, also separate from the bible. If one considers for a moment that Darren Aronofksy came from a Jewish background, its easy to see where he would have gotten some of his content. Other characters from the Bible are featured, such as Tubal Cain (the leader of the 'wicked' humans in the film), as well as Methuselah, even though they aren't mentioned in the biblical story of the flood. If one considers that all of these people lived at the same time however, its not much of a stretch. You can have whatever opinion about the film that you want, I just thought it might be interesting for those of you who are confused as to what the Nephilim are, or who the ""Yoda character"" is. Now, considering the vagueness of the bible on the event of the flood, it is only reasonable that Darren Aronofsky would have to fill in some blanks, and he does take creative license with it. Of course a lot of it isn't in the bible, but it does not contradict or disrespect what is already there. I think it should be celebrated that the bible is so narratively complex, its mysteries so compelling, that a self professed Atheist would be moved to try and tell one of its stories. There is a lot of material in that book for compelling films, whether you believe it to be fact or fantasy.Of course, a lot of people will disagree with me, both on my opinions of the film and its source material. That is fine, I am just tired of reading negative and uneducated articles and reviews by people who refer to the Nephilim as ""rock transformers"", even by people who have admitted to not even seeing the film! Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and some people will not like the liberties taken by the director. Its understandable. But as far as I am concerned, Noah is a beautiful, grim, powerfully compelling epic about the human capacity for wickedness and immorality, as well as love and mercy. The cinematography, art design, special effects, and music are uniformly brilliant. Russell Crowe brings a humanity and chilling focus to the character of Noah in one of his best performances, with Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson, Ray Winstone, and Logan Lerman all turning in powerfully brazen work as well. The film is tense, brutal, spectacular, smart, emotionally involving and thought provoking. Love if or hate it, you cannot deny the importance and power of anything that has inspired so much debate and controversy. As entertainment, I loved it, as a story with compelling characters and themes, I loved it. If you enjoyed Braveheart or Lord of the Rings, and are willing to see Noah as a work of film rather than an advertisement for the Christian church, I think you will enjoy it too. And if you don't, that's okay.

1599908,A37JNE9W4CZ5R1,B009NNM828,J. Teuton,"[1, 3]","The flood myth has been around a very long time.  Before the biblical tale, there was the tale of Gilgamesh in which a man named Utnapishtim was the hero of the flood tale.  Even this ancient Sumerian tale it is likely written down from a much older tale originating from the oral tradition, predating written language.  The story is well known, especially among the big three major religions, so how do you make a movie about the great flood, the most globally recognized story of Noah, and turn it into a movie worth watching?Herein lays the great problem.  The story is just too well known, globally, there are no real surprises in it.  The movie itself is well made, the acting is superb, and the story, while ancient, still feels fairly fresh.  So why was it so panned by so many people?  For most, it was simple, they expected a religious experience or a more religiously injected movie, and didn't get it.  For me, it was the shortcuts that were taken.Instead of a great wave, tsunami, tidal wave, etc., water explodes from the ground.  Instead of cutting from an existing forest, one was grown instantaneously from one seed supposedly from Eden.  Finally the addition of fallen stone covered angels all made these miracles seem a bit too contrived.  There were simply too many &#34;miracles of convenience&#34; to help add more wow factor than to actually add to a human drama of a family surviving a flood in a world of evil, especially in a world where &#34;the creator&#34; worked more through dreams and visions than actual miracles.The best parts of the movie are the human parts, and not the special effects.  Noah's conflict with the sons of Cain, the family's struggle to survive and follow Noah, his beliefs causing both a conflict with his family and his own morals all make for a compelling human drama.  This is not to say that the special effects were hack or all convenient, when done right they are done to perfection, but when used to produce shortcut miracles it seems a bit too showy.In short, one must approach the movie with an open mind, and a fresh eye, one must not re-read the story of Noah prior to watching this film, nor should one watch this movie with any religious preferences or expectations.  It is pure entertainment, and when it does it right and relies on the actors, it is done extremely well, but it is hard to hold the suspension of beliefs that this movie asks us to take when so many shortcuts are taken in the guise of miracles.",3,"The most non-religious biblical epic ever, which is not a bad thing.",1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,2477,"['flood', 'myth', 'been', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'biblical', 'tale', 'was', 'tale', 'Gilgamesh', 'man', 'named', 'Utnapishtim', 'was', 'hero', 'flood', 'tale', 'Even', 'ancient', 'Sumerian', 'tale', 'likely', 'written', 'down', 'much', 'older', 'tale', 'originating', 'oral', 'tradition', 'predating', 'written', 'language', 'story', 'well', 'known', 'especially', 'big', 'three', 'major', 'religions', 'how', 'do', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'flood', 'most', 'globally', 'recognized', 'story', 'Noah', 'turn', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Herein', 'great', 'problem', 'story', 'just', 'too', 'well', 'known', 'globally', 'are', 'real', 'surprises', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'acting', 'superb', 'story', 'ancient', 'still', 'fairly', 'fresh', 'So', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'panned', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'most', 'was', 'simple', 'expected', 'religious', 'experience', 'more', 'religiously', 'injected', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'was', 'shortcuts', 'were', 'taken.Instead', 'great', 'wave', 'tsunami', 'tidal', 'wave', 'etc.', 'water', 'explodes', 'ground', 'Instead', 'cutting', 'existing', 'forest', 'one', 'was', 'grown', 'instantaneously', 'one', 'seed', 'supposedly', 'Eden', 'Finally', 'addition', 'fallen', 'stone', 'covered', 'made', 'miracles', 'seem', 'bit', 'too', 'contrived', 'were', 'simply', 'too', 'many', '34', 'miracles', 'convenience', '34', 'help', 'add', 'more', 'wow', 'factor', 'actually', 'add', 'human', 'drama', 'family', 'surviving', 'flood', 'world', 'evil', 'especially', 'world', 'where', '34', 'creator', '34', 'worked', 'more', 'dreams', 'visions', 'actual', 'miracles.The', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'human', 'parts', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'Noah', 'conflict', 'sons', 'Cain', 'family', 'struggle', 'survive', 'follow', 'Noah', 'beliefs', 'causing', 'conflict', 'family', 'own', 'morals', 'make', 'compelling', 'human', 'drama', 'not', 'say', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'hack', 'convenient', 'when', 'done', 'right', 'are', 'done', 'perfection', 'when', 'used', 'produce', 'shortcut', 'miracles', 'bit', 'too', 'showy.In', 'short', 'must', 'approach', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'fresh', 'eye', 'one', 'must', 'not', 're-read', 'story', 'Noah', 'prior', 'watching', 'film', 'should', 'one', 'watch', 'movie', 'religious', 'preferences', 'expectations', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'when', 'right', 'relies', 'actors', 'done', 'extremely', 'well', 'hard', 'hold', 'suspension', 'beliefs', 'movie', 'take', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'shortcuts', 'are', 'taken', 'guise', 'miracles']",N/A
1599909,A24CASOMWGS87I,B009NNM828,"Juan Camaney ""Book Hunter""","[10, 20]","It is important to know what you are getting into when you are boarding this Ark. This is an action movie. This is also an art house film. And it is also a spiritual statement in the part of the director, with which you might agree or not agree. Rest assured that you will definitely not be bored, as this is a passionate, intense and visually stunning film.Darren Aronofsky is the fearless, visionary director of films such as "" Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Black Swan"", so it comes as no surprise that his ""Noah"" is every bit as relentless and (of course) apocalyptic as those films. I would dare say that no film has ever captured the savagery and the brutality of the Old Testament as ""Noah"" does; despite the controversies about accuracy, Aronofsky knows his Old Testament well and his ""Noah"" world recalls the terrifying Middle Ages paintings of Hell and Punishment.So while this film might annoy fundamentalists, it might also annoy high minded people, so it's good to remember that when it comes to Aronofsky, you must leave irony at the door: he believes in what he believes intensely and unapologetically, there is Evil, there is Mystery and there is also Grace, presented not with subtlety but with operatic, magnificent grandiosity, which is just as much Cecil B. DeMille as Werner Herzog as Aronofsky own, unique vision of trascendent spectacle.So this is the Bible Epic to end all Bible Epics, as the big themes are there, most importantly Mystery and Destiny, as the second half of the movie, which takes place on the Ark, faces Noah with what he thinks it's an impossible choice. This will strike many as melodramatic, but there is a thin line (or maybe none at all) between melodrama and tragedy, and what better example of it than the Bible itself, and here Aronofsky smartly introduces elements of another Bible story, the Abraham-Isaac one to explore fanaticism, freedom and again, fate. He is one of the few major filmmakers in the world, along with Bruno Dumont, dealing with matters of Faith; but not the blind faith of religious fanatics, but the complicated, demanding, terrifying and miraculous as exemplified by the Abraham-Isaac one; this is not necessarily an endorsement of Biblical or religious beliefs, but definitely a powerful, larger than life representation of it.Hats off to Paramount for allowing a filmmaker as talented as Aronofsky to work in such a large, epic scale. This movie reminded me in a very powerful way of another movie set in another time ""Children of Men"", which is a movie about the future which is really about the present, in the same way in which ""Noah"" is a movie about the past which is really about the present, by exposing a world bereft of pity and humanity, and swamped by greed and violence.But there is Grace too, not before a lot of Blood, and effective performances by Russell Crowe, Jenniffer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins, Ray Winstone, Emma Watson, among others.Fast paced, suspenseful, visually dazzling, ""Noah"" is what Cinemas were built for.",5,Art House Blockbuster,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,3008,"['important', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'when', 'are', 'boarding', 'Ark', 'action', 'movie', 'also', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'also', 'spiritual', 'statement', 'part', 'director', 'might', 'agree', 'not', 'agree', 'Rest', 'assured', 'will', 'definitely', 'not', 'be', 'bored', 'passionate', 'intense', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film.Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'fearless', 'visionary', 'director', 'films', 'such', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Black', 'Swan', 'surprise', 'Noah', 'bit', 'relentless', 'course', 'apocalyptic', 'films', 'would', 'dare', 'say', 'film', 'ever', 'captured', 'savagery', 'brutality', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Noah', 'controversies', 'accuracy', 'Aronofsky', 'Old', 'Testament', 'well', 'Noah', 'world', 'terrifying', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'paintings', 'Hell', 'Punishment.So', 'film', 'might', 'annoy', 'fundamentalists', 'might', 'also', 'annoy', 'high', 'minded', 'people', 'good', 'remember', 'when', 'Aronofsky', 'must', 'leave', 'irony', 'door', 'what', 'intensely', 'unapologetically', 'Evil', 'Mystery', 'also', 'Grace', 'presented', 'not', 'subtlety', 'operatic', 'magnificent', 'grandiosity', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'DeMille', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'Aronofsky', 'own', 'unique', 'vision', 'trascendent', 'spectacle.So', 'Bible', 'Epic', 'end', 'Bible', 'Epics', 'big', 'themes', 'are', 'there', 'most', 'importantly', 'Mystery', 'Destiny', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'place', 'Ark', 'Noah', 'what', 'impossible', 'choice', 'will', 'strike', 'many', 'melodramatic', 'thin', 'line', 'maybe', 'none', 'melodrama', 'tragedy', 'what', 'better', 'example', 'Bible', 'here', 'Aronofsky', 'smartly', 'elements', 'Bible', 'story', 'Abraham-Isaac', 'one', 'explore', 'fanaticism', 'freedom', 'again', 'fate', 'one', 'few', 'major', 'filmmakers', 'world', 'Bruno', 'Dumont', 'dealing', 'matters', 'Faith', 'not', 'blind', 'faith', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'complicated', 'demanding', 'terrifying', 'miraculous', 'exemplified', 'Abraham-Isaac', 'one', 'not', 'necessarily', 'endorsement', 'Biblical', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'definitely', 'powerful', 'larger', 'life', 'representation', 'it.Hats', 'Paramount', 'allowing', 'filmmaker', 'as', 'talented', 'Aronofsky', 'work', 'such', 'large', 'epic', 'scale', 'movie', 'reminded', 'very', 'powerful', 'way', 'movie', 'set', 'time', 'Children', 'Men', 'movie', 'future', 'really', 'present', 'same', 'way', 'Noah', 'movie', 'past', 'really', 'present', 'exposing', 'world', 'bereft', 'pity', 'humanity', 'swamped', 'greed', 'violence.But', 'Grace', 'too', 'not', 'lot', 'Blood', 'effective', 'performances', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Jenniffer', 'Connelly', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'others.Fast', 'paced', 'suspenseful', 'visually', 'dazzling', 'Noah', 'what', 'Cinemas', 'were', 'built']",N/A

1599911,A2EBR70V6P9W0N,B009NNM828,"karhill54 ""karhill54""","[9, 15]","...Christians -- or Bible purists of any kind -- would hate it for all its inconsistencies and evident blasphemous elements. (There is nothing particularly sacred about the Noah story so to tell it differently or embellish it is not blasphemous.) As a professing, practicing, born-again Christian, I figured way ahead of time that there wasn't going to be any more Biblical authenticity in this film than there was in ""Life of Brian"" and I might as well just toss out all my preconceived notions of what the ""real"" story of Noah should look and sound like. Thus, I wasn't disappointed; I sat down to watch a fantasy film with supernatural elements instead of a live-action Bible story.That said, I liked it. It was an interesting ""end-of-the-world"" scenario, no worse than many different end-of-the-world movies out there (well, it certainly WASN'T worse than ""2012,"" which was so bad I was unable to finish it) and the acting and special effects were quite good. I don't mind Aronofsky's choice to make the Fallen Angels good instead of demonic, but for goodness' sake, rock creatures? Seriously??? As if sci-fi/fantasy films don't have enough rock creatures in them. But in the end I really LIKED what he did with them: God -- excuse me, ""The Creator"" -- FORGAVE them as they willingly died to save Noah and his family. What's even better is that, just before it happened, I realized that THAT is what was GOING to happen; I knew that when Samyaza was attacked and was being destroyed he would be forgiven and received back into Heaven. That was an unusual and unexpected illustration of the most fundamental truth of Christianity: God forgives.How do I feel that Aronofsky chose to use the term ""The Creator"" instead of just using God's name, ""God?"" I'm ambivalent. Aronofsky is not trying to convert nonbelievers into Catholics the way Mel Gibson was with ""The Passion of the Christ"" so it probably shouldn't matter to me so much... but I can't help it, it does just a bit. But again, I'm watching a fantasy film, not a Biblical film. I am going to choose to use the name ""God,"" however, because that's what I know and believe in.Ray Winstone's part Tubal-Cain as Noah's primary antagonist was fine. I always like to see minor characters fleshed out and given personalities, but I'm undecided about how I feel about T-C's being a long-term stowaway. The film already had enough tension and conflict within the principle protagonists, but it did give Ham something more to do than brood. Ham's anger at his father for not saving the girl he'd picked out to be his girlfriend is understandable... or it would have been had he known her longer than 20 minutes. I certainly understand his adolescent angst that he would never, ever have sex if he didn't take matters into his own hands and go looking for it himself. I'm not a teenage boy, but I suspect they all feel that way at some point in their lives whether the world is getting ready to end or not. Was Ham so angry at Noah that he would hide T-C, with the understanding that T-C would eventually kill Noah? I don't really think Ham thought that far ahead. Teenagers generally don't. And Ham the character needed something to do to keep his situation uppermost in the minds of the audience.I did prefer, I think, the film's interpretation of Noah as a mortal, imperfect man instead of an ethereal, genteel, prophet-like super-human, which most Christians seem to prefer. And yet I enjoyed Methuselah as that very type of ""magical"" prophet. I mean, a guy who lives 1000 years has got to have some secret to long life; veganism can't be the answer to everything. Noah realizes and articulates a truth of the human condition: we are ALL corrupt. We are all born in sin and without redemption are condemned to die that way. None of us is born more innocent than others. He cries out to God, pleading, why did God give Noah this impossible task, the task of being the last of humanity, to even kill humans in order to remain true to that task? God is silent. Why? Because of course, Noah was wrong all along; God had never set that task before him at all. God was the one who sent the waters, God sealed the door of the ark, God destroyed mankind. God gave Noah love for his grandchildren, and when Noah acted on that love, that's when God responded with His blessings.And that, to me, is a pretty darn good Bible story.",4,"See, I KNEW this would happen....",1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,4372,"['Christians', 'Bible', 'purists', 'kind', 'would', 'hate', 'inconsistencies', 'evident', 'blasphemous', 'elements', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'sacred', 'Noah', 'story', 'so', 'tell', 'differently', 'embellish', 'not', 'blasphemous', 'professing', 'practicing', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'figured', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'more', 'Biblical', 'authenticity', 'film', 'was', 'Life', 'Brian', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'toss', 'out', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'what', 'real', 'story', 'Noah', 'should', 'look', 'sound', 'Thus', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'fantasy', 'film', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'instead', 'live-action', 'Bible', 'story.That', 'said', 'liked', 'was', 'interesting', 'end-of-the-world', 'scenario', 'worse', 'many', 'different', 'end-of-the-world', 'movies', 'there', 'well', 'certainly', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'worse', '2012', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'unable', 'finish', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Aronofsky', 'choice', 'make', 'Fallen', 'Angels', 'good', 'instead', 'demonic', 'goodness', 'sake', 'rock', 'creatures', 'Seriously', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'rock', 'creatures', 'end', 'really', 'LIKED', 'what', 'did', 'God', 'Creator', 'FORGAVE', 'willingly', 'died', 'save', 'Noah', 'family', 'What', 'even', 'better', 'just', 'happened', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'GOING', 'happen', 'knew', 'when', 'Samyaza', 'was', 'attacked', 'was', 'being', 'destroyed', 'would', 'be', 'forgiven', 'received', 'back', 'Heaven', 'was', 'unusual', 'unexpected', 'illustration', 'most', 'fundamental', 'truth', 'Christianity', 'God', 'do', 'feel', 'Aronofsky', 'chose', 'use', 'term', 'Creator', 'instead', 'just', 'using', 'God', 'name', 'God', ""'m"", 'ambivalent', 'Aronofsky', 'not', 'trying', 'convert', 'nonbelievers', 'Catholics', 'way', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'was', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'just', 'bit', 'again', ""'m"", 'watching', 'fantasy', 'film', 'not', 'Biblical', 'film', 'am', 'going', 'choose', 'use', 'name', 'God', 'however', 'what', 'know', 'believe', 'in.Ray', 'Winstone', 'part', 'Tubal-Cain', 'Noah', 'primary', 'antagonist', 'was', 'fine', 'always', 'like', 'see', 'minor', 'characters', 'fleshed', 'out', 'given', 'personalities', ""'m"", 'undecided', 'how', 'feel', 'T-C', 'being', 'long-term', 'stowaway', 'film', 'already', 'had', 'enough', 'tension', 'conflict', 'principle', 'protagonists', 'did', 'give', 'Ham', 'something', 'more', 'do', 'brood', 'Ham', 'anger', 'father', 'not', 'saving', 'girl', ""'d"", 'picked', 'out', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'understandable', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'known', 'longer', '20', 'minutes', 'certainly', 'understand', 'adolescent', 'angst', 'would', 'never', 'ever', 'have', 'sex', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'go', 'looking', ""'m"", 'not', 'teenage', 'boy', 'suspect', 'feel', 'way', 'point', 'lives', 'world', 'getting', 'ready', 'end', 'not', 'Was', 'Ham', 'so', 'angry', 'Noah', 'would', 'hide', 'T-C', 'understanding', 'T-C', 'would', 'eventually', 'kill', 'Noah', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'Ham', 'thought', 'far', 'ahead', 'Teenagers', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'Ham', 'character', 'needed', 'something', 'do', 'keep', 'situation', 'uppermost', 'minds', 'audience.I', 'did', 'prefer', 'think', 'film', 'interpretation', 'Noah', 'mortal', 'imperfect', 'man', 'instead', 'ethereal', 'genteel', 'prophet-like', 'super-human', 'most', 'Christians', 'seem', 'prefer', 'yet', 'enjoyed', 'Methuselah', 'very', 'type', 'magical', 'prophet', 'mean', 'guy', 'who', '1000', 'years', 'got', 'have', 'secret', 'long', 'life', 'veganism', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'answer', 'everything', 'Noah', 'truth', 'human', 'condition', 'are', 'corrupt', 'are', 'born', 'sin', 'redemption', 'are', 'condemned', 'die', 'way', 'None', 'born', 'more', 'innocent', 'others', 'out', 'God', 'pleading', 'why', 'did', 'God', 'give', 'Noah', 'impossible', 'task', 'task', 'being', 'last', 'humanity', 'even', 'kill', 'humans', 'order', 'remain', 'true', 'task', 'God', 'silent', 'Why', 'course', 'Noah', 'was', 'wrong', 'all', 'along', 'God', 'had', 'never', 'set', 'task', 'God', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'sent', 'waters', 'God', 'sealed', 'door', 'ark', 'God', 'destroyed', 'mankind', 'God', 'gave', 'Noah', 'love', 'grandchildren', 'when', 'Noah', 'acted', 'love', 'when', 'God', 'responded', 'blessings.And', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'Bible', 'story']",N/A

He assigns Noah the task of building a huge ark, sufficient to withstand the flood (biblically 40 days and nights) and to house a male and female of every earth creature, so when it's all over, the earth's inhabitants can re-populate the earth.  The part of Noah is played well by veteran actor Russell Crowe.  Sir Anthony Hopkins plays a small sporatic role as Noah's father.  The chief bad guy is a very familiar bad-guy, I just can't recall his name.Outside of the biblical story are some fallen angels that God turned into rocks and they move like Transformers.  Although they were cool to watch, they distract from a religious-based movie.  Another outside story is that Noah becomes obsessive about what additional things he THINKS God wants and I really wish they had not gone that way.  There is one more event that does not seem possible it could happen in 40 days, but I will let you figure out what that is as you watch.All things considered, my son and I enjoyed the movie.

There is a clear desire to advance ideologies which in no way represent the &#34;spirit of the biblical account&#34;. The decedent of Cain proclaims that humans are meant to dominate the earth, and of course he bites the head off of a little animal as he is saying that. In the bible, God tells us to have dominion over the creatures of the earth, which includes caring for them and eating them...yup- deal with it. In &#34;Noah&#34;, it seems that only vegetarians should have been allowed to enter the ark. Later on, Noah becomes obsessed with the idea that the animals are pure, as in the garden, yet humans are evil and only deserve death, including his own family. Noah is portrayed as an agent of truth and justice, but also a homicidal bipolar tyrant. Character development is consistently lacking in the film. Apart from a multitude of inaccuracies in the retelling of this story, I found the special effects to be mediocre, and in the case of the rock giants, just plain silly. The acting is actually quite good, but the script is simply insufferable. Remember, it was the movie studio that stated this film is true to the heart and spirit of the biblical account.

These are really good, unique, imaginative, unsettling films and I don't recall the audience sniggering during them. They feature extraordinary performances, notably from women of a certain type: small, bird-like creatures with dark eyes who are strung with piano wire: Natalie Portman and Jennifer Connelly being fine examples.Aronofsky has made a new film: Noah. It is a Biblical epic. He has struck the tone a long way towards the Peter Jackson end of a spectrum which didn't exist before Peter Jackson invented it. He has taken large liberties with some aspects of the Genesis story, inventing rock-encrusted fallen angels and a Kingdom of brutish descendants of Cain, but he has kept faithful to others a modern fellow might have jettisoned: how much more fascinating an examination of the human and divine it might have been were some of those who perished noble and good. The general view is that this is some kind of environmentalist parable. It's a poor parable that chooses for its standard-bearer a glum misanthropic monomaniac.Connelly (for whom many men my age have a soft spot, having fallen in love at first sight of her in Labyrinth when we were twelve) has signed up, so too have the redoubtable Anthony Hopkins, Hermione Granger (another moody, compact and tensely-strung brunette of Aronofsky's type) and, well, Ray Winstone. They've all agreed to stand behind Russell Crowe, a man who has demonstrated great charisma and masculinity throughout a long Hollywood career, but never much of an inclination to act. Then again, given the films he's chosen to appear in, he's rarely needed one. And nor does he here.Things proceed disappointingly. The first spot of rain takes an hour and a quarter to fall. The birds and beasts arrive with a great digital flourish, but are swiftly sedated and play no further part in the film. Connelly (who has form for playing Russell Crowe's wife) is obliged to over-emote at every turn. She looks haggard and careworn, possibly from the effort. Hermione also emotes wilfully. Crowe mumbles portentously into his beard and stumps grumpily around the ark believing, upon scant grounds, that doing God's will involves ensuring the annihilation of his own family. I don't remember that from Sunday School. Villainous Ray Winstone is, oddly the one left to advance the point that Noah's is not an especially constructive outlook. The only one listening is Ham.We are left with a kitchen sink melodrama wherein Noah contemplates the almighty, Hermione wants to keep her baby, Shem and Japeth keep up the numbers (for all the effect that have they may as well have been sedated with the giraffes) and Ham simpers about wishing there was a chick left on God's wet earth he wasn't related to. Ray Winstone lasts longer than the Bible mentions, perhaps so someone is around to present a humanist perspective but we all know what must happen in the end. It's not especially edifying: on the Biblical view, there must have been quite a few unspeakable acts for any of his descendants to have made it as far as the theatre to hear the lessons of this primordial eco-warrior.Olly Buxton",2,"In Which Darren Aronofsky Jumps a Shark, an Elephant and a Kangaroo.",1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,3190,"['Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'directed', 'Pi', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Black', 'Swan', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'unique', 'imaginative', 'unsettling', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'audience', 'sniggering', 'feature', 'extraordinary', 'performances', 'notably', 'women', 'certain', 'type', 'small', 'bird-like', 'creatures', 'dark', 'eyes', 'who', 'are', 'strung', 'piano', 'wire', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'being', 'fine', 'examples.Aronofsky', 'made', 'new', 'film', 'Noah', 'Biblical', 'epic', 'struck', 'tone', 'long', 'way', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'end', 'spectrum', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'invented', 'taken', 'large', 'liberties', 'aspects', 'Genesis', 'story', 'inventing', 'rock-encrusted', 'fallen', 'angels', 'Kingdom', 'brutish', 'descendants', 'Cain', 'kept', 'faithful', 'others', 'modern', 'fellow', 'might', 'have', 'jettisoned', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'fascinating', 'examination', 'human', 'divine', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'were', 'who', 'perished', 'noble', 'good', 'general', 'view', 'kind', 'environmentalist', 'parable', 'poor', 'parable', 'standard-bearer', 'glum', 'misanthropic', 'monomaniac.Connelly', 'whom', 'many', 'men', 'age', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'having', 'fallen', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Labyrinth', 'when', 'were', 'twelve', 'signed', 'up', 'so', 'too', 'have', 'redoubtable', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'moody', 'compact', 'tensely-strung', 'brunette', 'Aronofsky', 'type', 'well', 'Ray', 'Winstone', ""'ve"", 'agreed', 'stand', 'behind', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'man', 'who', 'demonstrated', 'great', 'charisma', 'masculinity', 'long', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'never', 'much', 'inclination', 'act', 'Then', 'again', 'given', 'films', 'chosen', 'appear', 'rarely', 'needed', 'one', 'here.Things', 'proceed', 'disappointingly', 'first', 'spot', 'rain', 'hour', 'quarter', 'fall', 'birds', 'beasts', 'arrive', 'great', 'digital', 'flourish', 'are', 'swiftly', 'sedated', 'play', 'further', 'part', 'film', 'Connelly', 'who', 'form', 'playing', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'wife', 'obliged', 'over-emote', 'turn', 'haggard', 'careworn', 'possibly', 'effort', 'Hermione', 'also', 'wilfully', 'Crowe', 'portentously', 'beard', 'stumps', 'grumpily', 'ark', 'believing', 'scant', 'grounds', 'doing', 'God', 'will', 'ensuring', 'annihilation', 'own', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Sunday', 'School', 'Villainous', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'oddly', 'one', 'left', 'advance', 'point', 'Noah', 'not', 'especially', 'constructive', 'outlook', 'only', 'one', 'listening', 'Ham.We', 'are', 'left', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'melodrama', 'wherein', 'Noah', 'almighty', 'Hermione', 'keep', 'baby', 'Shem', 'Japeth', 'keep', 'up', 'numbers', 'effect', 'have', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'sedated', 'giraffes', 'Ham', 'simpers', 'wishing', 'was', 'chick', 'left', 'God', 'wet', 'earth', 'was', ""n't"", 'related', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'longer', 'Bible', 'mentions', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'present', 'humanist', 'perspective', 'know', 'what', 'must', 'happen', 'end', 'not', 'especially', 'edifying', 'Biblical', 'view', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'few', 'unspeakable', 'acts', 'descendants', 'have', 'made', 'as', 'far', 'theatre', 'hear', 'lessons', 'primordial', 'eco-warrior.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

Tubal-cain kills Noah's father with a hatchet blow to the head, with blood-squirting results. Noah kills quite a few assailants. When hunters have shot an animal, Noah plucks the sharp projectile from the beast's bleeding side and uses it to fight the four men when they turn on him. Other animals have their throats cut or their guts grotesquely spilled. In a bloody marketplace, live animals are torn apart and eaten raw. Noah has visions of countless drowned humans and animals, and he walks on ground saturated with blood. Noah, gets rip-roaring drunk, spending what would seem to be days guzzling down wine. He drinks until he passes out. Methuselah gives Noah some tea that appears to be drugged, leading to a strange vision. The Watchers emerge from the ground and rise up into giant rock creatures with glowing eyes (This Noah guy is not the same guy from the Bible.

Along the way, we got to meet &#34;the wicked ones&#34; who are bent on storming the arc and taking it over. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: &#34;Noah&#34; is the latest ambitious film from writer-director Darren Aronofsky, who most recently delighted us with &#34;Black Swan&#34; but has also brought us other top notch movies like &#34;The Wrestler&#34;, &#34;Requiem For A Dream&#34; and &#34;Pi&#34;. Of the little that I know of the old testament's story, I was thinking to myself &#34;how is this going to take 2+ hours to play out?&#34;, but Aronofsky has woven quite a few intricate moral dilemmas into the plot (which I won't detail further so as not to spoil anything). Second, the visuals of the movie are nothing short of stunning. When the arc is attacked by &#34;the wicked ones&#34; and defended by &#34;the Watchers&#34;, it is a CGI dream in heaven. And when the flood arrives, it gets even better. Third, the movie has created some controversy for straying from/adding to the old testament's story (which is only 3 chapters in Genesis). To which I say: this is not a history lesson, or a religion class. This is a Hollywood movie trying to entertain you, and at that it surely succeeds. Fourth, there is a reason this movie is rated PG-13, as there are several disturbing (if brief) scenes in the movie. So please don't take your 5 or 6 yr. old to see this (as I saw one couple do when I saw the movie today--surprise, surprise, they ended up leaving early). Last, but not least, check out the excellent soundtrack, courtesy of Clint Mansell (whose has scored all of Aronofsky's movies). Patti SMith (accompanied by the Kronos Wuarted) sings &#34;Mercy Is&#34; over the movie's closing credits.Bottom line: &#34;Noah&#34; is another ambitious movie from Aronofsky, and would we want it any other way? I thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish. The movie opened today, and I went to see it at an early evening screening here in Cincinnati. It was playing at a mega-size theater, but the screening was not well attended, I'm afraid. I also notice that &#34;Noah&#34; is available on Amazon Instant Video, which really surprises me, but if you're going to see this, this is the kind of movie that begs to be screen on the big screen. &#34;Noah&#34; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,Stunning visuals and moral dilemmas carry the movie,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,2791,"['34', 'Noah', '34', '2014', 'release', '138', 'min', 'big', 'screen', 'tale', 'how', 'Noah', 'instructions', 'Creator', 'vision/dream', 'prepare', 'end', 'times', 'build', 'arc', 'carrying', 'male', 'female', 'animal', 'species', 'earth', 'family', 'consisting', 'wife', '3', 'sons', 'girl', 'have', 'adopted', 'way', 'raised', 'own', 'way', 'got', 'meet', '34', 'wicked', 'ones', '34', 'who', 'are', 'bent', 'storming', 'arc', 'taking', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'spoil', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', '34', 'Noah', '34', 'latest', 'ambitious', 'film', 'writer-director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'who', 'most', 'recently', 'delighted', '34', 'Black', 'Swan', '34', 'also', 'brought', 'other', 'top', 'notch', 'movies', '34', 'Wrestler', '34', '34', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', '34', '34', 'Pi', '34', 'little', 'know', 'old', 'testament', 'story', 'was', 'thinking', 'myself', '34', 'how', 'going', 'take', '2+', 'hours', 'play', 'out', '34', 'Aronofsky', 'woven', 'quite', 'few', 'intricate', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'detail', 'further', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'Second', 'visuals', 'movie', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'stunning', 'When', 'arc', 'attacked', '34', 'wicked', 'ones', '34', 'defended', '34', 'Watchers', '34', 'CGI', 'dream', 'heaven', 'when', 'flood', 'even', 'better', 'Third', 'movie', 'created', 'controversy', 'straying', 'from/adding', 'old', 'testament', 'story', 'only', '3', 'chapters', 'Genesis', 'say', 'not', 'history', 'lesson', 'religion', 'class', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'trying', 'entertain', 'surely', 'Fourth', 'reason', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'are', 'several', 'disturbing', 'brief', 'scenes', 'movie', 'So', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', '5', '6', 'yr.', 'old', 'see', 'saw', 'one', 'couple', 'do', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'today', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'ended', 'up', 'leaving', 'early', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'check', 'out', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'courtesy', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'scored', 'Aronofsky', 'movies', 'Patti', 'SMith', 'accompanied', 'Kronos', 'Wuarted', '34', 'Mercy', 'Is', '34', 'movie', 'closing', 'credits.Bottom', 'line', '34', 'Noah', '34', 'ambitious', 'movie', 'Aronofsky', 'would', 'want', 'other', 'way', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'start', 'finish', 'movie', 'opened', 'today', 'went', 'see', 'early', 'evening', 'screening', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'was', 'playing', 'mega-size', 'theater', 'screening', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'attended', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'also', 'notice', '34', 'Noah', '34', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'really', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'kind', 'movie', 'be', 'screen', 'big', 'screen', '34', 'Noah', '34', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A
1599934,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B009NNM828,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[14, 26]","Nine Things about the Movie ""Noah"" (USA, 2014)1. This movie is loosely structured around the Old Testament story of Noah's Ark. But you should be warned, this is NOT the Bible story you grew up with. It was directed by Darren Aronofksy, who directed ""Pi"", ""Requiem for a Dream"", and ""Black Swan."" And he's an atheist. So if you were expecting a normal, safe Christian story, you need to learn your directors before you go see movies.2. Aronofsky takes the classic, flawed Bible story and turns it into a majestic, visionary work of art that transcends religion. It's a layered and sophisticated examination of human nature, ethics, religious mania, self-doubt, and sacrifice. It's allegory and philosophy, wrapped in a myth.3. In this movie, Noah is basically the world's first hippie. He and his family live in a wasteland straight out of the ""Mad Max"" movies. Noah's family takes care of all life, even flowers, while a distant relative - a descendant of the infamous Cain - is industrializing and destroying the earth. Oh, and there are some giant angry rock monsters living nearby, too.4. Noah gets bizarre visions about the destruction of all life on Earth. He goes to visit his grandfather, the mystic Methuselah, for help. Methuselah gives Noah a drug that came from the Garden of Eden. After tripping hard for awhile, Noah knows what he must do... or so he thinks.5. A barely-mentioned Bible character, Tubal-Cain, is the main bad guy - a warrior king who thinks that Noah might be crazy, but decides he wants Noah's stupid boat, just in case. So he prepares war on the family while raping and pillaging everything in his way.6. By treating the story of Noah as an archetypal myth, Aronofsky frees himself to use it to explore the human condition in a way the Bible never could. It also means he's able to ignore problems with reality - like how all the animals find the ark, or how they all fit in it, etc.7. Not only is the movie different than the Bible version, it openly contradicts it sometimes. To say too much more about the movie would be to give away spoilers that are best left discovered on your own.8. Not surprisingly, many ""traditional"" Christians are upset about the movie (in a delightfully subversive twist, parts of the Bible are quoted - by the bad guys). The Hollywood studio that financed the film was afraid of this and wanted to change the movie to make it more acceptable to Christian audiences. But Aronofsky fought them, and won. He was allowed to make it how he wanted.9. If you want a reverent, traditional Bible story that shows the courage and faith of a simple man who trusts in God during a time of darkness, then you need to find something else to see. Aronofsky gives us a daring and epic reinvention of the story that, while set 4000 years ago, is actually relevant today.",5,"A daring reinvention, not made for the ""traditionally faithful""",1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,2816,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', 'Noah', 'USA', '2014', '1', 'movie', 'loosely', 'structured', 'Old', 'Testament', 'story', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'NOT', 'Bible', 'story', 'grew', 'up', 'was', 'directed', 'Darren', 'Aronofksy', 'who', 'directed', 'Pi', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Black', 'Swan', 'atheist', 'So', 'were', 'expecting', 'normal', 'safe', 'Christian', 'story', 'need', 'learn', 'directors', 'go', 'see', 'movies.2', 'Aronofsky', 'classic', 'flawed', 'Bible', 'story', 'majestic', 'visionary', 'work', 'art', 'religion', 'layered', 'sophisticated', 'examination', 'human', 'nature', 'ethics', 'religious', 'mania', 'self-doubt', 'sacrifice', 'allegory', 'philosophy', 'wrapped', 'myth.3', 'movie', 'Noah', 'basically', 'world', 'first', 'hippie', 'family', 'live', 'wasteland', 'straight', 'Mad', 'Max', 'movies', 'Noah', 'family', 'care', 'life', 'even', 'flowers', 'distant', 'relative', 'descendant', 'infamous', 'Cain', 'industrializing', 'destroying', 'earth', 'Oh', 'are', 'giant', 'angry', 'rock', 'monsters', 'living', 'nearby', 'too.4', 'Noah', 'bizarre', 'visions', 'destruction', 'life', 'Earth', 'visit', 'grandfather', 'mystic', 'Methuselah', 'help', 'Methuselah', 'Noah', 'drug', 'came', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'tripping', 'hard', 'awhile', 'Noah', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'so', 'barely-mentioned', 'Bible', 'character', 'Tubal-Cain', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'warrior', 'king', 'who', 'Noah', 'might', 'be', 'crazy', 'Noah', 'stupid', 'boat', 'just', 'case', 'war', 'family', 'raping', 'pillaging', 'everything', 'way.6', 'treating', 'story', 'Noah', 'archetypal', 'myth', 'Aronofsky', 'use', 'explore', 'human', 'condition', 'way', 'Bible', 'never', 'could', 'also', 'able', 'ignore', 'problems', 'reality', 'how', 'animals', 'find', 'ark', 'how', 'fit', 'etc.7', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'different', 'Bible', 'version', 'openly', 'sometimes', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'are', 'best', 'left', 'discovered', 'own.8', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'many', 'traditional', 'Christians', 'are', 'upset', 'movie', 'delightfully', 'subversive', 'twist', 'parts', 'Bible', 'are', 'quoted', 'bad', 'guys', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'financed', 'film', 'was', 'afraid', 'wanted', 'change', 'movie', 'make', 'more', 'acceptable', 'Christian', 'audiences', 'Aronofsky', 'fought', 'won', 'was', 'allowed', 'make', 'how', 'want', 'reverent', 'traditional', 'Bible', 'story', 'courage', 'faith', 'simple', 'man', 'who', 'God', 'time', 'darkness', 'then', 'need', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'see', 'Aronofsky', 'daring', 'epic', 'reinvention', 'story', 'set', '4000', 'years', 'ago', 'actually', 'relevant', 'today']",N/A

1599944,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B009NNM828,Robin Simmons,"[13, 32]","Ever since I was a kid, the story of Noah and the Great Flood has been a source of fascination.  And I'm not alone.  After all, it's the most-told story on the planet.  By a casual count, there are about 200 independent ""flood"" stories that are organic to cultures both modern and primitive.  Of course, Christianity, Islam and Judaism share the same core story.  But was there a cataclysmic event at the far edge of history that accounts for all these rather similar stories about one family and the seeds of life surviving a deluge brought on by angry gods?  And what does it mean?  We still call big natural catastrophes like floods or earthquakes ""acts of God"" even though few of us believe it to be literal  -- or do we?The intensity of the story is so persistent numerous expeditions continue to search for the remains of Noah's ark on Turkey's Mt. Ararat, the region of the Biblical landing place.  During the 90s, I co-produced a segment of NBC's popular ""Unsolved Mysteries"" on the subject and shot footage around Ararat and interviewed eyewitnesses who saw something huge and manmade that has been preserved in the permanent ice cap of Greater Ararat.  I showed a special cut of this footage (RIDDLE OF ARARAT) at our local Short Film Festival a few years ago and was invited to show it in London.  Both screenings got wide attention and drew full houses.What is it about this story that still resonates with us on such a deep level?Darren Aronofsky has been working on his NOAH film for 15 years in one form or another.  He's known as a visualist and uncompromising filmmaker who loves stories about obsessive loners who are compulsively driven to the brink of madness in their quest to find God.  In NOAH, he has fashioned a $130 million epic film that reboots the Biblical myth with a bold look and modern sensibility.  The film has already raised the ire of some conservative religious groups that think they have the only interpretation of this scriptural disaster story.  They don't.  The power of myth is that it has relevance to each successive age and Aronofsky has delivered a film that's a fine fit for the 21st Century as well as a great return to the popular Biblical epics of 50 years ago.The fine cast features Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson and Ray Winstone.  Crowe is a wonderful Noah who may be fighting a private madness.  He is a dark and intense protagonist full of existential angst.  Who can't relate to that?  He does not exactly hear the voice of God, but get's the message of his mission and the impending disaster in an acid-like dream.  Anthony Hopkins is a scene stealing (and scenery-chewing) Methuselah who endorses his grandson's dream.  If there's an antagonist, it's Ray Winstone as Tubal-cain, an environmental raping leader of a rogue army who attempts to hi-jack the ark.  There's a terrific ten-minute battle sequence that looked like something out of Tolkien.The production design and art direction throughout are superb and I liked the computer graphics that made the migration of the animals and the horror of the flood vivid and hyper real.I hope this film makes connects with a global audience (and makes big bucks) so that other mythic and Biblical tales can be realized on the big screen with all the personal vision of artists like Aronofsky.  In many ways, he's the Kubrick of the 21st Century.Forget the negative things you may have read or heard about NOAH.  Be assured, it is not sacrilegious, even though it may not be what you expect, it is an authentic retelling of this ubiquitous, enigmatic and powerful story.  For those conservative believers who are uncomfortable with the movie's theme of environmentalism and stewardship of the planet, it might be helpful to read the Biblical book of Revelation that specifically damns those who ""destroy the earth.""But does NOAH have meaning?  Well, that's up to you.  For me, it's a potent reminder that we are one human family and the earth is our ark.  No matter how you look at it, we are truly all in the same boat.  But first and foremost, NOAH is a grand, big screen, spectacularly satisfying entertainment that dazzles the eye and provokes the mind.

As a 'secularist' (as my Christian friends call me) I couldn't give less of a hoot about about Biblical accuracy but I still found the movie rather annoying.To the positive,as is typical in most modern movies, the visuals were wonderful. A lot of the scenery was truly stunning and made me wish I did a lot more traveling. The CGI details of the ark in motion we well done enough and as a work of visual art the movie was pretty good. Also, as much as people complain about the &#34;rock monsters&#34; or &#34;transformers&#34; I found their origin story rather intriguing.To the negative, I tend to complain endlessly about unnecessary action sequences and this movie had plenty of them. I fail to see how the death and destruction depicted really moved the story along or why anyone bothered to include them. As a story, I tend to think that, ironically, it depended too much on the viewers previous knowledge of the Biblical version of events. I'm at least vaguely familiar with the original story and even with that knowledge I'm not sure why some things happened. It just doesn't hang together very well at all.In summary, as everyone else has said, if you're looking at this movie because you feel it to be somehow Biblical, don't bother. If you just want a good storyline, probably also don't bother. If you just like action for the sake of action, well go for it. It's got that but be warned that your action will be interrupted by some rather feeble attempts at a story.--As always I endeavor to make my reviews succinct and above all helpful as you make a buying decision.

The only things accurate were that there was a Man named Noah, he had three sons, and there was an Ark with some animals on it. I certainly expected the movie to take some creative liberties, but COME ON!! The only thing missing was a laugh track.Not only can I not recommend this movie for anyone, I'd actually say you should stay away from it if you value your time and money.This review will have some spoilers, but that in itself is really ironic, since it's hard to imagine the story of Noah could have anything that far off from the biblical story. Prepare to be surprised.On a positive note, the acting was superb as were the effects and the directing. However watching this movie, I continually felt embarrassed for the wonderful actors who poured their hearts out with this absolutely absurd script.This movie was like Gladiator meets Transformers, meets Godzilla, meets The Shining"", meets Galaxy Quest. I actually expected to see Shia LaBeouf run through a scene and before he drowns in the great flood, he gets saved by the transformer rock people.Lets look at some of the twisted plot themes that this movie included:Here's spoiler #1. Noah runs into these giant rock monsters (similar to the one in Galaxy Quest). These monsters are angels that rebelled against God and came down to earth because they wanted to help man. But the mean and terrible God got mad at them, and turned them into these terrible gigantic rock monsters. After they help Noah, God rewards these fallen angels by taking them back up to heaven. I'm not going to comment on this - anyone who knows the bible will see how distorted this is. And even those who don't know the bible will recognize the complete ridiculousness of it.Spoiler #2: Did you know that Noah was a baby killer? Did you know that God decided to let Noah kill off mankind? It's especially interesting when he takes on the likeness of Jack Nicholson in the Shining and his entire family has to fight him and beg him not to kill his newborn grandchildren. But Noah's hellbent on doing it!Spoiler #3: How about that evil stowaway on the ark! Did you know that the man who killed Noah's father made it on board the ark, and Noah's son fed him and tended to his wounds so that the bad man could fight and kill Noah, his evil dad who he was very angry at for letting his girlfriend of 10 minutes die?I could go on and on with the ridiculous sub-plots, twists, turns and characters.So what about people who aren't bible believing, and enjoy a good fantasy?

1599963,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B009NNM828,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[11, 26]","When it was first announced that Paramount had given Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan) the green light to tell his version of the Noah story, many familiar with the director's work wondered how he and frequent collaborator and scriptwriter Ari Handel were going to interpret it.The mainstream audience began popping up their heads a few months ago, when all they had heard was that Hollywood had made a soon-to-be-released BIG movie about Noah in the Bible.  Naturally, the Bible geeks were shivering with anticipation. The only surprise from the near hysteria which followed was that the pious made so much noise primarily after the premiere, rather than before. Naturally, true to form, there has been condemnation from some without even having seen the film, but not quite to the extent we have seen from evangelical audiences previously. Some have accused Paramount of duping Christians into seeing it with a misleading campaign. Perhaps, or perhaps the studio merely overestimated that faction of the American public.The cries from a plethora of American Evangelical Christians that Noah is ""blasphemous"" is, in fact, offensive in itself, but not entirely unexpected. The Noah story does not exclusively belong to evangelical Christians, as it is not of Christian origin. Rather, that version of the universal flood is derived from ancient Jewish and rabbinic writings. Even the writers of Genesis took the Noah account from preexisting narratives, such as the ""Epic of Gilgamesh.""The art of Biblical storytelling is an oral tradition, which predates written scripture. Aronofsky continues in that spirit of oral tradition. Indeed, it is a theme which gives the film its strength and edge. Aronofsky, long obsessed with making Noah (2014), proves erudite, giving his film flourishes of a primordial world not far removed, time-wise, from Eden. It is a world with memories of its Paradise Lost hauntingly intact (i.e. a visual reference to the Edenic river). In the middle of all this is the startling protagonist Noah (Russell Crowe), whom Aronofsky gives flesh, flaws and drama, removing him from the plaster pedestal. That seems to be Aronofsky's chief offense for the unimaginative, pious masses who wanted a film about a cardboard cutout, rosy-cheeked, bearded old white guy smiling sweetly as he loads happy sheep onto his velcro boat. The rainbow ending is, of course, up for grabs. Aronofsky's approach is far too serious for that and he creatively reworks scripture and rabbinic writings into a challenging work of art that approaches world literature.As with all great literature, it has elements of the reflective and the unexpected.  The non-canonical ""Book of Enoch"" is another source he draws on. Aronofsky and Handel write in the spirit of  ancient biblical writers, who had no issues mixing myth, parable, folklore, and poetry together with a sliver of historicity into one narrative. They were not bound by our ideas of hyper-realism or linear storytelling. The earliest Church fathers understood this, and did not take scripture as either exclusively literal or historical. They saw it as a collection of diverse literary forms, written by divergent, God-obsessed peoples trying to grasp divine concepts. The resulting efforts were often akin to infinite ideas described in inadequately finite language, which is why we sometimes have conflicting biblical views of God within the same paragraph. Advocates of biblical inerrancy will argue that the ancient writings are Spirit-inspired. Perhaps, but even then it had to be filtered through human hands and, therefore, the Bible is ""fallible"" in our contemporary understanding of the term.Aronofsky is not a believer per se, but despite claims of those who are trying to demonize him, he does not take the ""religion as the root of all evil"" route. Indeed, Aronofsky, of Jewish heritage and education, clearly seeks to express an idea in an admirably classic way that is also overwhelming, confounding and vital for the viewer: God as both maternal and paternal Creator. That is an idea too sacred for the secular and too secular for the pious.In one sense, it is refreshing that Noah is a challenging enough film to provoke and inspire debate. This makes Noah more than just a chalky Sunday School lesson. We do not have to worry about Aronofsky and Handel succumbing to the status quo (who seem forever intent on proving how little we have evolved in the past few millennium anyway).Of course, the arrogant assumption that all Christians are evangelicals subscribing to sola scriptura is the foremost offensive reaction to the film by disgruntled audiences. This is actually more of the ""either/or"" mentality that far too many fundamentalists succumb to: one either approaches biblical stories as history, verbatim accounts that happened exactly as written, or one does not believe. Aronofsky's Noah is further evidence of the evangelical reaction to anything which veers away from their expectations; reactions which are frighteningly similar to those we have seen from radical Muslims regarding certain films, art, etc. If Aronofsky  proves anything, he proves that one can respond to or be inspired by scripture without subscribing to it as monotone historicity. Aronofsky's God reaches out to the patriarchal line--from Anthony Hopkins as Methuselah to Crowe's Noah--via visions. The ""God"" terminology is provocatively ambiguous, and lest we forget, we do not find God being referred to, in name, until much later in the Bible. The concept of God as YHWH (et. al.) was not yet developed at this time, and the context here would have us see this God simply as the Creator. Projecting any other names onto God would have been sloppy interpretive work on the part of Aronofsky.Another theme is the fall of humanity and humanity's subsequent relationship to the environment. Oddly, Aronofsky's depiction of the Nephilim is one of those ""blink and you will miss it"" references found in the Hebrew Bible that the literalists actually prefer to be ignored. Perhaps its one of those references that reiterates a little too strongly fantasy elements inherent in the Bible.Aronofsky's film indeed is in line with much of Hebrew literature (at least where it matters) and contextually it may be one of the most bravely ""accurate"" film productions of the Bible to date. If unimaginative fundamentalists have hangups about it, it is, in the end, their hangup. Still, hearing some of the hackneyed protests against this film makes me wonder, what the hell is wrong with religion? Why is it so afraid of challenge and artistic interpretation?* addition, regarding how easily faith and hate go hand-in-hand: A friend, who manages an AMC theater, informed that each showing in his

1599964,A31ACI0E88ORDE,B009NNM828,The Great White Father,"[9, 19]","EDIT: I've edited my review vis-a-vis the original: upon first viewing this film, I was so taken by what it got right, so that it felt both innate, well-written, and true to the faith (except, again, for the adaptation of the one narrative that is actually in Genesis 6-9, but even that didn't ruin the film for me), that I was dumbfounded and upset that professed Christians not only hated this film (rather than just considering it problematic)--but worse, treated their views as though no other Christian (at least not a ""good"" Christian) could or should hold any other opinion, which sounds to me like mistaking their wills for God's will (which, interestingly, is related to one theme at work here). I still think five stars is a good rating, since I don't consider the flaws to go to the core and excessively mar what was good about this--but I must confess that I wrote this review so soon precisely to counter all the one-star reviews, especially those from professed Christians.However, I was wrong to review the haters of the film instead of the film itself, even while I was trying to be charitable to the haters of the film. Consequently I've shortened this review, and am now trying to focus primarily, if not solely, on the actual film as opposed to what other people think about it. Likewise, I did try to show that I don't mistake this for a perfect film--but as a Christian, I believe we shouldn't make the perfect the enemy of the good, and I believe this is a good film, perhaps even a great one.********This is not a perfect film--in fact, the one Scriptural narrative adapted here falls flat when it should have been more potent, especially given what was added to the film that wasn't in Genesis--but even that (which I consider the worst objective flaw of this film) wasn't enough to ruin it for me, which is why I didn't knock a star off for that.  There were other things I would have done differently but I didn't consider them debilitating flaws.  Even what I consider to be (at least potentially) objective flaws would be flaws of omission, not of commission--and The Passion of the Christ had flaws of omission as well.Quite frankly, there is only one criticism that I think even deserves to be addressed as such, even though I don't think the film deserves condemnation for it, that being what this film's depiction of Noah (wrongly) believes he must do, and tries to do, in order to (as he sees it) do the Creator's will, in an original thread not found in Genesis 6-9--that and some changes which don't technically go against Scripture but which you don't usually see in adaptations of the Noah's Ark story, changes which make this controversial story thread possible at all.  Any other criticism I consider not to be debilitating, at best, and at worst just plain silly.  I have no idea what God thinks of this film and I don't presume to speak for the Almighty on this matter.  I'm just trying to give my own opinion, informed by the faith.Theme-wise (especially since this is a new film I want to avoid spoilers in my review), I think this is in perfect keeping with the faith.  The real Noah did something (recorded in the Bible) that many of us might be outraged about, and another holy patriarch tried to do something similar to what Noah does here because it actually was God's will--and the movie actually bothers to tell us exactly what is in his mind and heart, so that this isn't coming from nowhere--nor does it conflict with the faith just by logic alone.  That is, I don't see this as blaspheming God or defaming a holy patriarch--especially given that this came before Christ, even the holiest wasn't completely free from sin.  God is Love, but we cannot appreciate Christ's atoning Sacrifice on the Cross if we ignore what He came to save us from--and this movie explains this in no uncertain terms, nor does it ignore God's Love.  (And it's refreshing that a story about the end of the world, everyone except eight people drowning in a Flood, is not reduced to kiddie fare for once--how did this story ever become kiddie fare anyway?)There are two related themes that I can see here, both consistent with the faith, and I thought they were manifested excellently in the film, so that nothing felt out of place for me, but it felt innate, as though the actual Noah's Ark story could have happened something like this:1) Justice vs. Mercy.  Both are virtues, coming ultimately from God, but because we are all conceived in original sin, in practice these often conflict with one another, and we are left wondering which virtue to follow in what circumstances, as either can be corrupted.  Holy justice can become a cold, unfeeling desire for death for other people or for ourselves--and so can become murder or suicide.  (If God didn't temper His justice with mercy, we would all deserve to die and go to hell--I know I would.)  Holy mercy can become a foolish enabling of wicked men to rise to power and commit every kind of atrocity, including betrayal of he who showed mercy in the first place.  (If God never exacted justice, who would respect Him rather than doing whatever they wanted?)  When must we show mercy, even to sinners who are our enemies, and when must we show justice, even to those about whom we care deeply?  It's not easy, and I appreciate the applicability of this theme to the audience.  A Biblical movie should take us out of our comfort zone--Christianity is about embracing our crosses.2) What does it mean to put God's will ahead of our own or anyone else's?  God is all-knowing, and all-loving, and so He (our Creator) knows better than we or anyone else what is best for us, and so it is important to trust to this even if we don't understand or imagine we know better.  We must put His will ahead of our own: besides, we are corrupted by original sin, and He is not and cannot be corrupted at all.  But what does this mean in practice?  Obviously, if you're trying to do something you don't want to do, and no one else wants you to do, you're putting something ahead of your will and anyone else's--but that doesn't automatically mean you're doing God's will.  In addition, while we are in competition with God every time we sin, He is not in competition with us, and we were created good, though we were later corrupted--so that sometimes our will coincides with God's will.  It is better to act for His sake rather than simply because it's what we want, but the point is, just because I want something doesn't mean it's against God's will for me to have it.  The Virgin Mary wanted Jesus to provide wine for the wedding feast at Cana, and even though His hour had not yet come, He provided--nor did He rebuke Her for sin in even asking.  Even perverted desires are a desire ultimately for something good, we're just attaching that good desire to something bad for us that won't satisfy it.  Again, I thought this was applicable and manifested well in the film: both Noah and his family come across sympathetically, though deeply flawed and in conflict with one another for the second half of the film.The most I'm willing to concede is that perhaps the execution could have been better than it was, but I didn't think it was horrible--realistically, there were probably options that Noah could have chosen to do other than what he decides to do in this film. Likewise, he fails to read the signs that he has indeed misinterpreted the Creator's will until after he has already acted in accordance with His will at the time when it truly matters--so that instead of realizing at this point that he was wrong, he believes that he was weak and failed, until he is made to realize otherwise, so that the movie is able to end happily after all. Again, perhaps this wasn't the best way to execute the ideas here, but I'm willing to be charitable.  If Noah fails to recognize God's mercy when he sees it, in the face of so much evil and God exercising His justice, can we blame him?  It's easy for us to get bogged down in all the evil going on in the world every day in this age, yet every time God doesn't strike us down for it He shows us mercy.  And mercy wins out in the end.  And inextricably linked to this, those whose wills are in true alignment with God's will get what they want, which shows that we are from God and therefore fundamentally good--just because we are sinful doesn't mean our wills always conflict with God's will.  Other than that, the worst thing about it is that we see relatively little of God, and less (at least overtly) of His love and mercy--but aside from that not being the same thing as God and His Love being absent entirely (no small difference!), any attempt to depict the Almighty is doomed to fall short, so that this may have been better anyway, especially since God's ordinary modus operandi is not to make Himself known in supernatural ways, and in no uncertain terms, anyway.  And besides the fact that you can't have everything, we can better appreciate God's love and mercy if we know where but for His grace we go.  And again, I thought that these themes go very well with the Noah story given what it is even in Scripture.I think this is what a Bible movie, or a religious movie, should be, and I hope it starts a trend of more such films--and it breaks my heart that professed Christians are against it rather than supporting it.  How do they expect Hollywood to take the faith or its practitioners seriously if an already minority religion divides itself further?  That's why I wrote this review so early--I only just saw the film for the first time two days before writing this review.  And the fact that the director is a self-proclaimed Jewish atheist makes it all the more to the glory of God that he produced something like this--indeed, many excellent Bible movies and religious movies were made by nonbelievers, and The Bible miniseries and Son of God show that just because you profess the faith doesn't mean you're going to make the best adaptation of it.Again, this film isn't perfect, and so I'm not comparing it with Jesus--but just as Jesus confounded expectations of what the Messiah is supposed to be, and self-professed ""children of Abraham"" rejected this and hated Jesus, so too does this film confound expectations of what a Noah movie is supposed to be, and self-professed Christians reject and hate this film.  Are they right, or are they mistaking their will for God's will?But don't listen to me, I'm not God--you go watch the film and decide for yourself.  But all I ask is that you keep an open mind and an open heart--that is, don't condemn the film for failing to meet your expectations rather than actually doing something wrong.  (And don't listen to anything anyone else says, positive or negative, including what I say here, in terms of evaluating the film yourself--although maybe take the themes I described above with you into the film and evaluate the film with that in mind.)  It may be hard to discern the difference between failing to meet our expectations and failing in adapting a Bible story faithfully at all, but we must discern the difference if we're going to put God's will ahead of our own, and thereby be good Christians.God bless and be with you all.P. S.  My heart goes out to those who aren't familiar with the faith and who are turned off to it by this (and to those who have witnessed this), but I don't see that as a flaw in the film either.  Many left Jesus when He said that we must eat His flesh and drink His Blood in order to have eternal life, and that unless we do we have no life in us--and Jesus didn't go after them but respected their free will.  How easy is it to accept, if we really think about it, that we must eat human flesh and drink human Blood or we'll die?  (Or that the bread and wine literally become the Body and Blood of Christ, rather than merely representing them?)  Maybe it's a flaw that this film isn't necessarily the best evangelization tool (or maybe the film isn't thus flawed), but I think that as long as a true and proper catechesis is going on, there shouldn't be a problem with this film.  Again, we Christians must show charity wherever we can, and we must not ignore the uncomfortable parts of the faith (our crosses) if we are to appreciate the Good News of Jesus Christ.",5,"As a

And Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast are wonderful.But you have to be careful or at least considerate when taking on a story from the Bible.  If Hollywood were to make a movie from the Koran with this kind of ""re-interpretation,"" there'd be another holy war engulfing the globe.  Wait.  There already is one or a couple going on, but there'd a new front along the California coast.At first, I was willing to overlook the political fable threatening to overtake the entire story (that I'm pretty sure is NOT in Genesis).  Noah and his family are the only vegans on the planet, trying to preserve a world where nobody eats meat or harms anything.  In fact, there are no plants, grass or trees left.  They've been destroyed by raging cannibal clans who have built great cities and probably vote Republican.  These cities are kept in the distance because, well, the filmmakers don't want you to see whatever industry it was that destroyed Earth's plant life (something we're still working on ourselves--and we can split the atom!), which is a little weird since everyone looks like they're living in the Stone Age.And then there are the rock people.  In the Bible they're described as fallen angels but in this movie they look like Transformers from a live action version of The Flintstones.  When the flood happens in a spectacular SFX sequence, I was ready to just ignore the weird scenes preceding it.But then the story takes a bizarre turn again.  It's the Bible...if Stephen King knocked out a draft or two, just before it was handed over to some Hollywood nephews.  Noah gets an odd notion and spends the last quarter of the movie skulking around the ark a little like Jack Nicholson in THE SHINING.  The man God chose to save humanity turns into a coiled lunatic who wants to kill his entire family.  For me, it derails the entire movie...and I'd been asked to put up with an awful lot up 'til then!I was reminded of Indiana Jones sarcastically asking the US Agents at the beginning of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK:""Didn't you guys ever go to Sunday School?""",1,The Old Testament--Hollywood-style!,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,2126,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'NOAH', 'spectacular', 'visuals', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'wonderful.But', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'least', 'considerate', 'when', 'taking', 'story', 'Bible', 'Hollywood', 'were', 'make', 'movie', 'Koran', 'kind', 're-interpretation', ""'d"", 'be', 'holy', 'war', 'engulfing', 'globe', 'Wait', 'already', 'one', 'couple', 'going', 'there', 'new', 'front', 'California', 'coast.At', 'first', 'was', 'willing', 'overlook', 'political', 'fable', 'threatening', 'overtake', 'entire', 'story', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'NOT', 'Genesis', 'Noah', 'family', 'are', 'only', 'vegans', 'planet', 'trying', 'preserve', 'world', 'where', 'nobody', 'meat', 'harms', 'anything', 'fact', 'are', 'plants', 'grass', 'trees', 'left', ""'ve"", 'been', 'destroyed', 'raging', 'cannibal', 'clans', 'who', 'have', 'built', 'great', 'cities', 'probably', 'vote', 'Republican', 'cities', 'are', 'kept', 'distance', 'well', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'industry', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Earth', 'plant', 'life', 'something', ""'re"", 'still', 'working', 'ourselves', 'can', 'split', 'atom', 'little', 'weird', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'living', 'Stone', 'Age.And', 'then', 'are', 'rock', 'people', 'Bible', ""'re"", 'described', 'fallen', 'angels', 'movie', 'look', 'Transformers', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'Flintstones', 'When', 'flood', 'spectacular', 'SFX', 'sequence', 'was', 'ready', 'just', 'ignore', 'weird', 'scenes', 'preceding', 'it.But', 'then', 'story', 'bizarre', 'turn', 'again', 'Bible', 'Stephen', 'King', 'knocked', 'out', 'draft', 'two', 'just', 'was', 'handed', 'over', 'Hollywood', 'nephews', 'Noah', 'odd', 'notion', 'last', 'quarter', 'movie', 'skulking', 'ark', 'little', 'like', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'THE', 'SHINING', 'man', 'God', 'chose', 'save', 'humanity', 'coiled', 'lunatic', 'who', 'kill', 'entire', 'family', 'entire', 'movie', ""'d"", 'been', 'asked', 'put', 'up', 'awful', 'lot', ""'til"", 'then', 'was', 'reminded', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'sarcastically', 'asking', 'US', 'Agents', 'beginning', 'RAIDERS', 'THE', 'LOST', 'ARK', 'Did', ""n't"", 'guys', 'ever', 'go', 'Sunday', 'School']",N/A

In this Middle Earth saga the watchers are huge rock creatures that look like they belong in Star Wars. This is a rather bizarre interpretation of Genesis 6:1-5, and was my second WTF moment after that dog with scales thing. In the bible, the Watchers had relations with humans and created a race of giants who apparently ruled over man...not in this film.Russell Crowe portrays Noah as a dark, bitter, dysfunctional, unlikeable person who obeys God through his dreams. (God doesn't even make a cameo.) The women, whose names aren't mentioned in the Bible are given expanded and important roles. All the time on the ark is spent on personal drama. No tending of the animals that are all living together in the hull of the ship.Another problem is that Tubal-Cain kills Noah's father Lamech, not to be confused with Tubal-Cain's father Lamech while Noah was a child.The Bible claims Lamech was born in the 182nd year of Methuselah and lived 777 years. This means he died 10 years before the flood. Noah was over 600 years old at the time of the flood. Do the math.There were a number of surprises, some I won't mention as I wouldn't want to &#34;spoil&#34; a millennia tale. That said, at the end, a son leaves the group before them all having children when clearly the families stayed together for a number of years and raised children until the Canaan/Noah incident which is not mentioned.Poor Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly acted their hearts out, reminding me of Sean Astin who gave a wonderful performance in &#34;Cabin Fever 3.&#34; Nothing like casting pearls before swine.From a biblical prospective, the film was a disaster and not inspirational. As an action adventure story, the rock creatures made me feel like I was watching Indian Jones with aliens. And I suppose people who liked the ending of that film might be attracted to this one.Oh yea, this thing was way too long. It had scenes which dragged on. It needed an editor.This is Razzy material.

Don't get me wrong, I love fantasy, special effects, the ancient world and the possibility of metaphysical beings interacting with ancient mankind.If you subscribe to literal or interpreted versions from the Bible, this movie will be a let down. It would be one thing if the movie tried to stay true to the original story, added some special effects to it, and pulled off a &#34;Ten Commandments&#34;. This didn't even come close. If you know nothing about the original story from the Bible, this movie is a complete waste of your time and money because you won't have enough background information to understand what is happening, and the film does nothing to tell the story adequately. Too many unanswered questions for those who have never heard the story, i.e. the filmmakers rely too heavily on your having familiarity with the story to begin with.If you're looking for some great delivery of lines by great actors, Russell Crowe & Anthony Hopkins, sorry, I'm sure even they were let down by the weak script.I understand taking a little creative license with an ancient story. When we say &#34;creative license&#34; - there is so much added in - things that were never in the original. Anthony Hopkins does his best in this movie supposedly as Methuselah who is made out to have magic powers, something not indicated in the Bible story. Noah going on a rampage to kill his grand children - wait what step-daughter ... Tubal-Cain as a stow-away on the Ark? What?  Fallen angels who become giant rock creatures? Seriously? And magic rocks that glow in the dark? Really?  Special knock-out incense to tranquilize the animals?So, as a film it does a weak job of telling a story. It has great special effects, which are only interesting in themselves - the effects don't really help to tell the story.I imagine there are multitudes of screenwriters who cringe at seeing crap like this pull in big budget money of $130-million when there are probably dozens of better films that could have been made with the money they wasted on this flop.",1,Bizarre Adaptation Of Original Story Disappoints,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,2076,"['Awful', 'Say', 'Don', 'Imus', 'would', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'fantasy', 'special', 'effects', 'ancient', 'world', 'possibility', 'metaphysical', 'beings', 'interacting', 'ancient', 'mankind.If', 'subscribe', 'literal', 'interpreted', 'versions', 'Bible', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'tried', 'stay', 'true', 'original', 'story', 'added', 'special', 'effects', 'pulled', 'off', '34', 'Ten', 'Commandments', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'know', 'nothing', 'original', 'story', 'Bible', 'movie', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'background', 'information', 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'film', 'nothing', 'tell', 'story', 'adequately', 'Too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'story', 'i.e', 'filmmakers', 'rely', 'too', 'heavily', 'having', 'familiarity', 'story', 'begin', 'with.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'delivery', 'lines', 'great', 'actors', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'sorry', ""'m"", 'sure', 'even', 'were', 'let', 'down', 'weak', 'script.I', 'understand', 'taking', 'little', 'creative', 'license', 'ancient', 'story', 'When', 'say', '34', 'creative', 'license', '34', 'so', 'much', 'added', 'things', 'were', 'never', 'original', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'best', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'Methuselah', 'who', 'made', 'out', 'have', 'magic', 'powers', 'something', 'not', 'indicated', 'Bible', 'story', 'Noah', 'going', 'rampage', 'kill', 'grand', 'children', 'wait', 'what', 'step-daughter', 'Tubal-Cain', 'stow-away', 'Ark', 'What', 'Fallen', 'angels', 'who', 'become', 'giant', 'rock', 'creatures', 'Seriously', 'magic', 'rocks', 'glow', 'dark', 'Really', 'Special', 'knock-out', 'incense', 'tranquilize', 'animals', 'So', 'film', 'weak', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'only', 'interesting', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'tell', 'story.I', 'imagine', 'are', 'multitudes', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'cringe', 'seeing', 'crap', 'pull', 'big', 'budget', 'money', '130-million', 'when', 'are', 'probably', 'dozens', 'better', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'money', 'wasted', 'flop']",N/A

Instead I'm here to talk about the film and why it is marvelous.The story -- We all know it, but it has changed, for the better. Had the ""original"" made it on screen it would have been much shorter, less epic, and not as thought provoking. The director/writer Darren Aronofsky used the first two acts of the film to tell us the story in a family friendly way, the use of the Watchers was brilliant (to make them basically Giant Rock-Giants). We often like to tell ourselves how things look in different periods in history but forget others also view things differently, so as a writer myself I can see why the director/writer chose this ""version"" of the Watchers on film.In the Third act we get a lot of ""what the!"" moments, such as when Noah feels he must kill his grandchildren, however he does not. The point of doing this was to make people see a number of things. One being that Noah is human, he has doubts, and concerns about his voyage and task. The other thing audiences should remember is that we don't truly know a lot about the story of Noah, and adding this shows the courage to both believe and doubt faith. And ultimately Noah chose to believe.The acting-- Crowe is good actor, sometimes great but in recent years hasn't gotten a truly great role (or accepted one), until now. This one challenges him, and gives him the ability to show off, imo. In my eyes no one is Noah but Crowe with this performance. He is gritty, delicate, and convincing not to mention powerful. The rest of the cast hold their own and bring Crowe to his feet for a role he will never top. As the story followed Noah so strongly it is hard to say how great, good, or even bad the rest of the cast were, but if I had to say I think every held their own.The directing/writing -- As I have already touched on the writing I'll mainly talk about the directing. The ark is beautiful, even though a majority of it is CGI, some is actually real and it shows. The set designs and locations used were great, if not the best I have ever scene in an Epic. Aronofsky shines with his ability to visually please the audience, especially when the flood begins and when the whole ""new life"" sequence begins. The only small complaint is some of the animals could have used some touch ups as they were all (except for a bird or two) CGI, and not real animals.All in all this is a movie that really moved me. It is beautiful, daring, thought provoking, and an achievement that will likely never be toppled in the biblical epic genre. Or even Epics in general.Many people disagree with the route the writers and director took but I believe it was important to show how fragile faith is and yet how rewarding it can be.

1599970,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B009NNM828,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[15, 32]","Noah is an epic fail both as Biblical drama and fantasy action film, ending up as a so-so cross between the two. It's long and silly, despite the eye candy visuals, and the &#34;Bible as Lord of the Rings&#34; style doesn't quite work. The film starts with great FX and eventually becomes a hokey shipboard soap opera. It's not terrible, but I was surprised at the letdown, considering the great cast and entertaining trailers. Many critics raved about &#34;Noah,&#34; but it's hard to see why either religious or non-religious audiences would like it. Believe me, big budgets aren't the fix for movies based on scripture or religion in general!The film didn't seem bad to me, just &#34;meh,&#34; and that's enough to ruin a Bible-based movie with enormous pretensions to artistry as well as a gigantic budget. The visuals are impressive, but the film is uneven and overlong, slowing to a crawl in spots whenever it runs out of CGI and tries to recover the familiar storyline. If you know even a little of the Book of Genesis, most of the battles and dramatic conflicts here are anticlimactic since you know his family survives the flood, and much of the rest feels like generic FX eye candy. If you don't know Genesis or have any religious affiliation, this movie is still a disappointment, as it fails to deliver anything you won't find in other generic blockbuster action films to better effect. If you want action, go see &#34;Captain America,&#34; not &#34;Noah.&#34;Like some other Hollywood religious films, &#34;Noah&#34; may the perfect film for a complacent agnostic, challenging him to think about God (who may exist, but is a real jerk if he does) in a way that deeply affirms his basic ambivalence toward religion. The film's attitude toward God and his servant Noah is deeply ambiguous. It's the sort of film that lets people off the hook for &#34;not knowing or not being able to know if God exists,&#34; rather than challenging them to take a stand one way or the other. Funny how these movies always get labeled as &#34;daring&#34; insofar as they depart from Biblical text, when what they are really doing is affirming the complacency of those who keep God at arm's length. The refusal to take any position on Judeo-Christianity's truth claims seems to be the popular meaning of &#34;artistic&#34; when it comes to religious films nowadays. Personally, I believe a truly counter-cultural film would be a creative adaptation of what the Bible actually says, like &#34;The Gospel of John&#34; in 2003. But I'm also a crank, which is a synonym in Hollywood for &#34;believer.&#34;I do appreciate director Darren Aronofsky's offbeat filmmaking tastes. There are things I liked in &#34;Noah,&#34; and I appreciated the efforts to inject creativity into a well-worn story. However, realism is not the word that springs to mind with this film, as an acquaintance put it after seeing the film: &#34;Tubal-Cain had a bazooka?!&#34; I'm not sure how this film can take the reality of the flood as a given, as some of its supporters claim, while treating the entire context of the flood as a fictional &#34;Middle Earth&#34;-style world with distracting modern technologies and magical elements like talking rock monsters. The problem isn't that this film treats the Bible as mythology, but that it invents too many magical elements for viewers to take Noah's human conflict very seriously. Although Russell Crowe does a great job portraying Noah's struggles, the film undermines his performance and our ability to take him seriously with its relentless sci-fi/fantasy cliches. Rather than being a &#34;pious cardboard cutout,&#34; Noah becomes an &#34;cardboard cutout antihero,&#34; and the scenes of Action Hero Noah (TM) killing dozens of men tend to undermine the believability of his inner struggle for me. I recommend seeing the movie at least once, as it may recall old religious feelings very strongly for some viewers, but most people will probably live a long and happy life without seeing &#34;Noah.&#34;",1,Epic disaster of a Bible movie,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,4023,"['Noah', 'epic', 'fail', 'Biblical', 'drama', 'fantasy', 'action', 'film', 'ending', 'up', 'so-so', 'cross', 'two', 'long', 'silly', 'eye', 'candy', 'visuals', '34', 'Bible', 'Lord', 'Rings', '34', 'style', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'film', 'great', 'FX', 'eventually', 'hokey', 'shipboard', 'soap', 'opera', 'not', 'terrible', 'was', 'surprised', 'letdown', 'considering', 'great', 'cast', 'entertaining', 'trailers', 'Many', 'critics', 'raved', '34', 'Noah', '34', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'religious', 'non-religious', 'audiences', 'would', 'like', 'Believe', 'big', 'budgets', 'are', ""n't"", 'fix', 'movies', 'based', 'scripture', 'religion', 'general', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bad', 'just', '34', 'meh', '34', 'enough', 'ruin', 'Bible-based', 'movie', 'enormous', 'pretensions', 'artistry', 'as', 'well', 'gigantic', 'budget', 'visuals', 'are', 'impressive', 'film', 'uneven', 'overlong', 'slowing', 'crawl', 'spots', 'whenever', 'CGI', 'tries', 'recover', 'familiar', 'storyline', 'know', 'even', 'little', 'Book', 'Genesis', 'most', 'battles', 'dramatic', 'conflicts', 'here', 'are', 'anticlimactic', 'know', 'family', 'flood', 'much', 'rest', 'feels', 'generic', 'FX', 'eye', 'candy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Genesis', 'have', 'religious', 'affiliation', 'movie', 'still', 'disappointment', 'deliver', 'anything', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'other', 'generic', 'blockbuster', 'action', 'films', 'better', 'effect', 'want', 'action', 'go', 'see', '34', 'Captain', 'America', '34', 'not', '34', 'Noah.', '34', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'religious', 'films', '34', 'Noah', '34', 'may', 'perfect', 'film', 'complacent', 'agnostic', 'challenging', 'think', 'God', 'who', 'may', 'exist', 'real', 'jerk', 'way', 'deeply', 'basic', 'ambivalence', 'religion', 'film', 'attitude', 'God', 'servant', 'Noah', 'deeply', 'ambiguous', 'sort', 'film', 'people', 'hook', '34', 'not', 'knowing', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'know', 'God', '34', 'rather', 'challenging', 'take', 'stand', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'Funny', 'how', 'movies', 'always', 'get', 'labeled', '34', 'daring', '34', 'insofar', 'depart', 'Biblical', 'text', 'when', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'doing', 'affirming', 'complacency', 'who', 'keep', 'God', 'arm', 'length', 'refusal', 'take', 'position', 'Judeo-Christianity', 'truth', 'claims', 'be', 'popular', 'meaning', '34', 'artistic', '34', 'when', 'religious', 'films', 'nowadays', 'Personally', 'believe', 'truly', 'counter-cultural', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'creative', 'adaptation', 'what', 'Bible', 'actually', '34', 'Gospel', 'John', '34', '2003', ""'m"", 'also', 'crank', 'synonym', 'Hollywood', '34', 'believer.', '34', 'do', 'appreciate', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'offbeat', 'filmmaking', 'tastes', 'are', 'things', 'liked', '34', 'Noah', '34', 'appreciated', 'efforts', 'inject', 'creativity', 'well-worn', 'story', 'However', 'realism', 'not', 'word', 'mind', 'film', 'acquaintance', 'put', 'seeing', 'film', '34', 'Tubal-Cain', 'had', 'bazooka', '34', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'film', 'can', 'take', 'reality', 'flood', 'given', 'supporters', 'claim', 'treating', 'entire', 'context', 'flood', 'fictional', '34', 'Middle', 'Earth', '34', '-style', 'world', 'distracting', 'modern', 'technologies', 'magical', 'elements', 'talking', 'rock', 'monsters', 'problem', ""n't"", 'film', 'Bible', 'mythology', 'too', 'many', 'magical', 'elements', 'viewers', 'take', 'Noah', 'human', 'conflict', 'very', 'seriously', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Noah', 'struggles', 'film', 'performance', 'ability', 'take', 'seriously', 'relentless', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'cliches', 'Rather', 'being', '34', 'pious', 'cardboard', 'cutout', '34', 'Noah', '34', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'antihero', '34', 'scenes', 'Action', 'Hero', 'Noah', 'TM', 'killing', 'dozens', 'men', 'tend', 'undermine', 'believability', 'inner', 'struggle', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'least', 'once', 'may', 'recall', 'old', 'religious', 'feelings', 'very', 'strongly', 'viewers', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'live', 'long', 'happy', 'life', 'seeing', '34', 'Noah.', '34']",N/A
1599971,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B009NNM828,Turfseer,"[8, 16]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***My question about 'Noah', Darren Aronofsky's bloated, CGI-effects laden Biblical epic, is whether it was worth making at all. The tale found in the Bible doesn't exactly lend itself to good drama. It's a simple tale that's actually taken from an earlier story from Mesopotamia. You all know the story: Patriarch saves all the creatures on earth (in pairs of two) by building an ark after God (known as the 'Creator' here) decides to destroy all of humanity, after they turn inexorably wicked.Russell Crowe can't be blamed much for another one of his grim-faced, ultra-serious performances (much like his dull 'Robin Hood'), since he's simply been directed to follow Aronofsky's (for the most part), dull script. Before Aronofsky serves up his version of the building of the Ark and subsequent flood, he introduces a human antagonist in the form of one Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) who is quite conveniently a descendant of Cain (all-time bad guy who killed good old brother Abel). Winstone actually is much more lively than Crowe as 'king' of the desolate realm he rules over. He gets wind of the Ark and God's plan to wipe out everyone, so he plans to kill Noah and take over his ship.The problem is how does Noah and his family defend himself against an entire Army? Aronofsky's 'brilliant' idea is to conceive of a coterie of fallen angels, 'The Watchers', who also happen to be rock monsters. You'll recall that the enjoyable sci-fi dramedy, 'Galaxy Quest', also featured a much more malevolent rock monster. But here, Aronofsky's monsters are much more benign--and are willing to defend the Ark from Tubal-cain's bad guy minions. If there's one thing that really ruins 'Noah', it's the presence of the ridiculous rock monsters, that reduces the film to feeling like one of those old, cheesy episodes, from the original Star Trek series or a clunky Transformers-like fest.If you're expecting some great flood scenes, with the Ark being tossed about in a turbulent sea, you will be disappointed. Noah and family are tossed about for a few seconds and the creature passengers remain undisturbed, as they enjoy their bucolic sleep. I'm sad to report that the storm (as storms go), ranks way below iconic disaster scenes, such as the twister in 'The Wizard of Oz'. Instead, Noah gets to duke it out with Tubal-cain, who manages to be the only one of his army, to slip on board the ark.Meanwhile, Aronofsky opts for melodrama to compensate for his lack of a good 'Poseiden Adventure' involving the Ark. Ila (Emma Watson), adopted by the family early on, suddenly finds she's 'with child' as a result of grandfather Methuselah's transcendent intervention (Anthony Hopkins has the only comic scene in the entire movie, with his successful quest to dine on a clump of delicious berries!). While Noah probably will get some great marks from animal activists, on the other hand, I have to no doubt he will receive failing marks from those concerned with female empowerment. Yes, religious zealot Noah actually has the idea that God wants him to murder Ila's twin newborns, to ensure that all mankind is punished for their transgressions. While he's trying to decide should he or shouldn't he (i.e. kill the babies), the character's likability factor goes down considerably (yes I know this is Biblical times, but it's hard to like a character who comes within one second of committing infanticide). What's more our modern sensibilities are offended when the womenfolk give him hugs afterward--it's hard to stomach the idea that Noah is forgiven so easily.That's about it folks. When all is said and done, 'Noah' is kind of a bore. On the positive side, there's some occasional good cinematography, including a nifty scene where Noah gazes upon Tubal-cain's tribe, as they do their 'Hieronymus Bosch' impersonation. Ultimately Mr. Aronofsky does not possess a creative enough spark to turn this antediluvian and post-antediluvian potboiler into compelling drama. We're stuck with clich&eacute;d battles attended by absurd rock monsters and a cringeworthy protagonist who spends a good deal of time contemplating the murder of his grandchildren. Time to get out my old copy of 'Ben Hur'--chariot racing seems a lot more exciting than both humans and animals getting tossed around in the hold of a ship, on a storm-tossed sea.",2,Aronofsky's rock monsters can't turn this antediluvian and post-antediluvian potboiler into compelling drama,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,4354,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***My', 'question', ""'Noah"", 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'bloated', 'CGI-effects', 'laden', 'Biblical', 'epic', 'was', 'worth', 'making', 'tale', 'found', 'Bible', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'lend', 'good', 'drama', 'simple', 'tale', 'actually', 'taken', 'earlier', 'story', 'Mesopotamia', 'know', 'story', 'Patriarch', 'creatures', 'earth', 'pairs', 'two', 'building', 'ark', 'God', 'known', ""'Creator"", 'here', 'destroy', 'humanity', 'turn', 'inexorably', 'wicked.Russell', 'Crowe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'blamed', 'much', 'one', 'grim-faced', 'ultra-serious', 'performances', 'much', 'dull', 'Hood', 'simply', 'been', 'directed', 'follow', 'Aronofsky', 'most', 'part', 'dull', 'script', 'Aronofsky', 'up', 'version', 'building', 'Ark', 'subsequent', 'flood', 'human', 'antagonist', 'form', 'one', 'Tubal-cain', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'who', 'quite', 'conveniently', 'descendant', 'Cain', 'all-time', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'killed', 'good', 'old', 'brother', 'Abel', 'Winstone', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'lively', 'Crowe', ""'king"", ""'"", 'desolate', 'realm', 'rules', 'over', 'wind', 'Ark', 'God', 'plan', 'wipe', 'out', 'everyone', 'kill', 'Noah', 'take', 'over', 'ship.The', 'problem', 'how', 'Noah', 'family', 'defend', 'entire', 'Army', 'Aronofsky', ""'brilliant"", 'idea', 'conceive', 'coterie', 'fallen', 'angels', 'Watchers', 'who', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'rock', 'monsters', ""'ll"", 'recall', 'enjoyable', 'sci-fi', 'dramedy', 'Quest', 'also', 'featured', 'much', 'more', 'malevolent', 'rock', 'monster', 'here', 'Aronofsky', 'monsters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'benign', 'are', 'willing', 'defend', 'Ark', 'Tubal-cain', 'bad', 'guy', 'minions', 'one', 'thing', 'really', ""'Noah"", 'presence', 'ridiculous', 'rock', 'monsters', 'film', 'feeling', 'one', 'old', 'cheesy', 'episodes', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'clunky', 'Transformers-like', 'fest.If', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'great', 'flood', 'scenes', 'Ark', 'being', 'tossed', 'turbulent', 'sea', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Noah', 'family', 'are', 'tossed', 'few', 'seconds', 'creature', 'passengers', 'remain', 'undisturbed', 'enjoy', 'bucolic', 'sleep', ""'m"", 'sad', 'report', 'storm', 'storms', 'go', 'way', 'iconic', 'disaster', 'scenes', 'such', 'twister', ""'The"", 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Instead', 'Noah', 'duke', 'out', 'Tubal-cain', 'who', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'army', 'slip', 'board', 'ark.Meanwhile', 'Aronofsky', 'melodrama', 'compensate', 'lack', 'good', ""'Poseiden"", 'Adventure', 'involving', 'Ark', 'Ila', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'adopted', 'family', 'early', 'suddenly', ""'with"", 'child', 'result', 'grandfather', 'Methuselah', 'transcendent', 'intervention', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'only', 'comic', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'successful', 'quest', 'dine', 'clump', 'delicious', 'berries', 'Noah', 'probably', 'will', 'get', 'great', 'marks', 'animal', 'activists', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'doubt', 'will', 'receive', 'failing', 'marks', 'concerned', 'female', 'empowerment', 'Yes', 'religious', 'zealot', 'Noah', 'actually', 'idea', 'God', 'murder', 'Ila', 'twin', 'newborns', 'ensure', 'mankind', 'punished', 'transgressions', 'trying', 'decide', 'should', 'should', ""n't"", 'i.e', 'kill', 'babies', 'character', 'likability', 'factor', 'down', 'considerably', 'yes', 'know', 'Biblical', 'times', 'hard', 'like', 'character', 'who', 'one', 'second', 'committing', 'infanticide', 'What', 'more', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'offended', 'when', 'womenfolk', 'give', 'hugs', 'afterward', 'hard', 'stomach', 'idea', 'Noah', 'forgiven', 'so', 'easily.That', 'folks', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'kind', 'bore', 'positive', 'side', 'occasional', 'good', 'cinematography', 'including', 'nifty', 'scene', 'where', 'Noah', 'Tubal-cain', 'tribe', 'do', ""'Hieronymus"", 'Bosch', 'impersonation', 'Ultimately', 'Mr.', 'Aronofsky', 'not', 'possess', 'creative', 'enough', 'spark', 'turn', 'antediluvian', 'post-antediluvian', 'potboiler', 'compelling', 'drama', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'battles', 'attended', 'absurd', 'rock', 'monsters', 'cringeworthy', 'protagonist', 'who', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'contemplating', 'murder', 'grandchildren', 'Time', 'get', 'out', 'old', 'copy', ""'Ben"", 'Hur', 'chariot', 'racing', 'lot', 'more', 'exciting', 'humans', 'animals', 'getting', 'tossed', 'hold', 'ship', 'storm-tossed', 'sea']",N/A
1599972,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B009NNM828,V. Berk,"[15, 30]","Human morality is brought to center stage in director Darren Aronofsky's ambitious epic Noah, which is a loose adaptation of the tale of Noah's Ark found in The Bible.  Already this movie has been dividing audiences with people of faith upset that it strays so far from the source material and atheists writing it off as ""religious garbage.""  Both sides are so caught up in their political agendas that they never stop to appreciate Noah for what it really is:  one of the best Hollywood epics I've seen in years.  People who are writing it off simply because it's loosely based on a Bible story need to just appreciate it as a well-made film from one of the more unique directors currently working.First off, what you need to know up front about this movie is that it makes no attempt at being a ""historical"" epic.  This is a high-concept fantasy film loosely based on a Biblical tale.  Here mankind has created an industrial society and has pillaged to earth to the point that they're basically living in a post-apocalyptic setting. This is the evils of mankind taken to their most extreme to the point that our own planet is practically inhospitable.""If you're a man you can kill.""  This quote from the film's antagonist sums up the moral and ideological questions at work in Aronofsky's interpretation of the Noah story.  It isn't simply a matter of basic right or wrong, but of human nature, and whether or not man can ever truly live in harmony with the creatures he co-inhabits the earth with.While its deviations from religious scripture are certain to ruffle a few feathers I believe Noah falls in line with a tradition of storytellers taking classic tales and reinterpreting them for new audiences and with new meaning.  I feel these changes make the story even more relevant to our times, and help create a new struggle as the character of Noah is forced to question whether or not the human race is worth preserving at all.All the Aronofsky tropes are here: a haunting musical score by Clint Mansell, trippy time lapses and character dreams/visions, with the most abstract and visually arresting one being Aronofsky's interpretation of the Adam & Eve story.  It's hard to describe it in words, but if you're at all familiar with his body of work you're going to be picking up on these things from the start.  Going in I was worried about how his style would translate to the source material, but he immediately washed those concerns away and I was hooked from beginning to end.And of course when the flood finally comes Aronofsky gives us an honest to goodness, no holds barred, Wrath of the Almighty apocalypse!  We're talking the earth cracking open, gigantic geysers springing up, trees being uprooted, people climbing over each other trying desperately to survive--the works!  The chaos of this sequence mixed with intense human suffering I felt made it far more impactful than your typical Hollywood disaster picture as Aronofsky deftly utilizes camera and computer generated effects to create this cataclysm.The characters of Noah could easily have been overwhelmed by Aronofsky's style and the visual effects, but every member of this cast holds their own.  Each character is given clearly defined motivations, and are performed believably, with Crowe being the standout.  His performance is enough to remind everyone why he is one of Hollywood's most sought after male leads nailing dramatic and physical demands of his role.If you're a person of faith looking for an accurate representation of the Noah story you probably won't be very happy with this film.  Noah needs to be viewed as its own story built up from the skeleton of the Biblical tale.  If you don't believe in the events of Noah's Ark that would be mighty short sighted.  This movie uses a Biblical tale to create a high-concept fantasy, and should be accessible to all regardless of whether or not they believe in scripture.I can honestly say that Noah is unlike any Hollywood epic or Biblical adaptation I've ever seen before.  Approaching this film with an open mind I believe there is a lot to enjoy about Noah.  It addresses universal questions about morality and man's place on earth, willing to show both the good, the bad, and the outright wicked.  Noah may be inspired by religious tales, but viewers shouldn't define the movie in those terms.  The film is a product of one Hollywood's best and should be appreciated as the work of art it is.",5,Biblical Epic: Aronofsky Style,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,4436,"['Human', 'morality', 'brought', 'center', 'stage', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'ambitious', 'epic', 'Noah', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'tale', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'found', 'Bible', 'Already', 'movie', 'been', 'dividing', 'audiences', 'people', 'faith', 'upset', 'so', 'far', 'source', 'material', 'writing', 'off', 'religious', 'garbage', 'sides', 'are', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'political', 'agendas', 'never', 'stop', 'appreciate', 'Noah', 'what', 'really', 'one', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'epics', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'writing', 'off', 'simply', 'loosely', 'based', 'Bible', 'story', 'need', 'just', 'appreciate', 'well-made', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'unique', 'directors', 'currently', 'working.First', 'off', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'up', 'front', 'movie', 'attempt', 'being', 'historical', 'epic', 'high-concept', 'fantasy', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'Biblical', 'tale', 'Here', 'mankind', 'created', 'industrial', 'society', 'pillaged', 'earth', 'point', ""'re"", 'basically', 'living', 'post-apocalyptic', 'setting', 'evils', 'mankind', 'taken', 'most', 'extreme', 'point', 'own', 'planet', 'practically', 'inhospitable', ""'re"", 'man', 'can', 'kill', 'quote', 'film', 'antagonist', 'sums', 'up', 'moral', 'ideological', 'questions', 'work', 'Aronofsky', 'interpretation', 'Noah', 'story', ""n't"", 'simply', 'matter', 'basic', 'right', 'wrong', 'human', 'nature', 'not', 'man', 'can', 'ever', 'truly', 'live', 'harmony', 'creatures', 'earth', 'with.While', 'deviations', 'religious', 'scripture', 'are', 'certain', 'ruffle', 'few', 'feathers', 'believe', 'Noah', 'falls', 'line', 'tradition', 'storytellers', 'taking', 'classic', 'tales', 'reinterpreting', 'new', 'audiences', 'new', 'meaning', 'feel', 'changes', 'make', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'times', 'help', 'create', 'new', 'struggle', 'character', 'Noah', 'forced', 'question', 'not', 'human', 'race', 'worth', 'preserving', 'Aronofsky', 'tropes', 'are', 'here', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'trippy', 'time', 'lapses', 'character', 'dreams/visions', 'most', 'abstract', 'visually', 'arresting', 'one', 'being', 'Aronofsky', 'interpretation', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'story', 'hard', 'describe', 'words', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'body', 'work', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'picking', 'up', 'things', 'start', 'Going', 'was', 'worried', 'how', 'style', 'would', 'translate', 'source', 'material', 'immediately', 'washed', 'concerns', 'away', 'was', 'hooked', 'beginning', 'end.And', 'course', 'when', 'flood', 'finally', 'Aronofsky', 'honest', 'goodness', 'barred', 'Wrath', 'Almighty', 'apocalypse', ""'re"", 'talking', 'earth', 'cracking', 'open', 'gigantic', 'geysers', 'springing', 'up', 'trees', 'being', 'uprooted', 'people', 'climbing', 'other', 'trying', 'desperately', 'survive', 'works', 'chaos', 'sequence', 'mixed', 'intense', 'human', 'suffering', 'felt', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'impactful', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'disaster', 'picture', 'Aronofsky', 'deftly', 'camera', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'create', 'cataclysm.The', 'characters', 'Noah', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'overwhelmed', 'Aronofsky', 'style', 'visual', 'effects', 'member', 'cast', 'own', 'character', 'given', 'clearly', 'defined', 'motivations', 'are', 'performed', 'believably', 'Crowe', 'being', 'standout', 'performance', 'enough', 'remind', 'everyone', 'why', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'sought', 'male', 'nailing', 'dramatic', 'physical', 'demands', 'role.If', ""'re"", 'person', 'faith', 'looking', 'accurate', 'representation', 'Noah', 'story', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'film', 'Noah', 'be', 'viewed', 'own', 'story', 'built', 'up', 'skeleton', 'Biblical', 'tale', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'events', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'would', 'be', 'mighty', 'short', 'sighted', 'movie', 'Biblical', 'tale', 'create', 'high-concept', 'fantasy', 'should', 'be', 'accessible', 'regardless', 'not', 'believe', 'scripture.I', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'Noah', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'Biblical', 'adaptation', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'Approaching', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'believe', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'Noah', 'universal', 'questions', 'morality', 'man', 'place', 'earth', 'willing', 'show', 'good', 'bad', 'outright', 'wicked', 'Noah', 'may', 'be', 'inspired', 'religious', 'tales', 'viewers', 'should', ""n't"", 'define', 'movie', 'terms', 'film', 'product', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'should', 'be', 'appreciated', 'work', 'art']",N/A
1599973,A2ZXCWUWXLVK6I,B009NNM828,"Vicky ""Vicky""","[5, 14]","I really wanted to like this movie. I knew that it wouldn't be the classic, Biblical tale, and that it would have some &#34;creative&#34; liberties taken with it. But I didn't have any idea just how far off the beaten path this movie would go. I know the Bible very well, and though I'm far from a &#34;purist&#34; when it comes to Biblical movies (hello, Ten Commandments!), when you take a Bible story and just... well... butcher it... comparisons will be made, whether we like it or not.*SPOILERS AHEAD*This is a long, long movie, and only the latter half actually deals with the Flood at all. The beginning is a very convoluted, rambling set up, consisting of fallen angel/rock monster thingies, Anthony Hopkins who is some sort of magical Methuselah who possesses divine powers, and a horde of savages led by Tubal-cain. Noah starts out as a loving, protective, confident father and husband, and we as the audience sit back and nod. &#34;Yeah... rock on, Noah&#34;.For some reason that isn't explained at all, Noah insists that God intends the Flood to wipe out all humankind, himself and his family included; he views their time on the ark as meant to be keepers of the animals only, and that the animals are meant to repopulate the earth, but no humans. There is no explanation of where Noah gets this idea from, and it doesn't make any sense, but it sets up this ridiculous, melodramatic tension for the rest of the movie. Noah believes his sons will be the end of mankind. A girl that they adopted years earlier and view as their daughter, is conveniently barren at movie's start, but then a touch from magical Methuselah and suddenly she's ripping her clothes off with Shem, and ta-da, she's pregnant. Noah views this as mankind trying to out-smart God's plan to wipe them out (which is laughable when you think about it, as if men can out-muscle God), and he goes from Loving Fatherly Noah into Psycho Brooding Noah. He plans to slaughter the child if it's a girl, in order to stick to God's plan of ending mankind.Oh, and even though the traditional story tells us that Noah's sons had wives already before the ark was even built, for some reason Ham and Japheth have no wives, and we toss in a teen-angsty side story of Ham trying to snag one of the heathen girls from their camp, but Noah refuses it and leaves her behind to die.And even though the ark was supposedly afloat for 150 days (5 months), the pregnant daughter in law is suddenly full term and in labor by the time the ark hits land.Not only that, but Tubal-cain apparently sneaks onto the ark as the rains hit, and Ham is so ticked off at his father, that he hides their former enemy and plots with him to kill Noah in revenge for leaving his would-be wife behind to die.

Leave them (with respect) to their thoughts, and move on.Aronofsky has done it again, with a spectacular rendering of the classic story of redemption - this time, not just redemption of mankind, but of one man, too. Translation from book to movie always involves artistic decisions. Translation from a story you can read in ten minutes to a two-hour movie demands a lot of filling-in of missing detail, too, and there's plenty of that here. (Suspended animation for the menagerie - well, that solves a whole bunch of problems.) And the whole human experience - well, I haven't checked my King James translation of the Greek translation of the Aramaic lately, but I don't remember a lot of emphasis on that, and it really has to be there to make the story come to life. And yes, it's there. Add in the best the effect-meisters can manage, having practiced on a big bunch of recent disaster flicks, and it makes for a show that's well above average. And, if the familial tensions get amped up a bit, I can't complain too much. Have you ever spent a long car trip cooped up with teenagers, let alone a claustrophobic boat trip covering months? A few moments of high feeling are to be believed - and we don't even live in an era when we accept people like Abraham (or this Noah) having voices in their heads telling them to kill their family members.Granted, this may have stretched the original text past its elastic limit, possibly to the yield point. But, when original means &#34;translation of a translation of a thousand years of oral tradition,&#34; or something even less solid, I can allow a fair bit of elasticity. Aronofsky's stop-animated interludes presented more of a stylistic leap than I could really follow. Outside of that, though, I found it a very workable imagining of the classic story.

1599979,AP3B615GM191G,B009NNM828,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[24, 53]","Whether you believe the biblical story of Noah's Ark to be truth or fiction, few could dispute that it is quite a fantastic tale.  I mean, a giant flood, two of every animal, and epic themes of man's wickedness.  Ready-made for Hollywood, right?  When the trailers first started hitting for this movie quite a while back, I thought it would be a surefire hit.  The one kink I hadn't expected: Darren Aronofsky's complete and utter incompetence in deciphering what this movie experience should have been about.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Noah (Russell Crowe), who is told by the &#34;Creator&#34; (or God) to build an ark to survive a flood that will wipe nearly all of wicked humanity off of the planet while saving the animals and righteous few.  So, Noah along with his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and sons (Douglas Booth, Logan Lerman), sets out to complete the task.  An orphan girl (played by Emma Watson) also joins the crew.  Nothing is &#34;smooth sailing&#34; about building the Ark, however, as Noah is constant tormented by Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone), leader of the ravenous human colonies.The only positive thing I can say about &#34;Noah&#34;?  It had an epic feel to it.  That is clear right from the beginning.  Oh yeah, and Emma Watson steals basically every scene that she is in.  However, Aronofsky screws things up so many times that by the end it turns into quite a mess.  For example...-Introducing the concept of the Nephilim (fallen Angels) is interesting...but not as rock-creatures that resemble the Ents from the Lord of the Rings.  A terrible choice right from the get-go.-The entire concept behind Noah and is Ark has NOTHING to do with environmentalism (no matter how much you try to force it, Darren).  Men were not wicked because they were eating meat.  They were wicked because they perverted God's ways and created a cesspool of humanity.  Also, God did NOT value the animals over the humans.  God basically just wanted to &#34;start over&#34; with two of each species, man or beast.  It has nothing to do with the animals being &#34;purer&#34; than men.-The biggest problem of the entire film, though, is how Aronofsky intimates that Noah thinks God wants ALL humanity to die, even going so far as to put the fate of future offspring in doubt.  There is NOTHING in the Bible that suggests this whatsoever, and even as a &#34;dramatized concept&#34; it is stupid.  To put it simply, God recognized that only the line of Noah remained pure in heart and devoted to him, so he saved Noah's line along with the general eco-system (animals) of Earth in order to &#34;wipe the slate clean&#34;.  The purpose most assuredly was NOT to wipe humans off the face of the planet.It has been quite a while since I have been let down quite this much by a film that I thought would have so much more potential.  Shame on you, Darren Aronofsky, for almost single-handedly destroying what could have been an epic masterpiece.  It saddens me that you were unable to stick to the story itself (which would have provided enough drama for anyone else) and instead had to inject your high-handed ideals into the mix.

Still, the movie is quite well-done.  It highlights the duality in mankind and raises questions about the sanity of the Old Testament god.  And this is why you have so many bad reviews here on Amazon.  The offended come out of their holes like zombies, not quite sure why they need to rant, yet certain they are hungry for blood.Which is not fair.  Noah is a great fairy tale brought to life.  It borrows from the Bible and makes substantial improvements.  To say that Noah is not entertaining is a lie.  The movie has quite a few unexpected twists and a lot of good action sequences.  The visuals are impressive, and the acting superb.I particularly enjoyed Hopkins' performance as Merlin--I mean Methuselah.  The way he exits the movie is stupid, but he is quite a mysterious mentor figure.Ray Winstone brings Tubal-Cain to life here, in a way that has you wondering if he is not a better leader than Noah.Russel Crowe is phenomenal as the arguably bipolar and psychopathic Noah.  His emotions and goals seem to change as much as his hair styles do.  Which is quite entertaining.  Sometimes you love him, sometimes you want him dead, sometimes you relate to him on a human level--imperfection personified.(Honestly, Noah goes from a Braveheart hairstyle, to a biker-Santa-Claus hairstyle, to a Carol-from-The-Walking-Dead hairstyle, to an 80's-pop-singer-Michael-McDonald hairstyle.  It gets distracting.  I like the Biker Santa do, myself.)The rock monsters are not rock monsters, as some say.  Those who say that have not paid attention.  These are some of the Watchers, punished by &#34;God&#34; for helping mankind.  They fall to Earth on their way to help, get transmogrified into &#34;earthly beings,&#34; and help us anyway.Watson is terrific, and plays off of Crowe really well.  Their characters embrace and clash.  In fact, the characters in this movie do not all see eye-to-eye, so be ready for some drama and violence.Plus, who doesn't want to see Watchers in battle?  They rock!This movie is a gritty, dark fairy tale that reminds one of Lord of the Rings at times, Ironclad at others, and Excalibur at others.  Weird, but true.  It's a great movie that will surprise you and delight you--and disappoint you.
