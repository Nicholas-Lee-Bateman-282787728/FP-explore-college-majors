I've been looking for this movie for awhile, but I couldn't exactly remember the title. I knew it had the words, ""Spell and Freedom"", but that was it. I'm happy my determination paid off. :) It was inspirational enough for me to have such an impact to remember this almost 20 years ago. I do hope they'll release it on DVD soon. There are just too many movies out there that haven't had their turn on the DVD list. I hope ""Girl who spelled Freedom"", is on one of the top lists.",5,One of my favorites,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,579,"['Boy', 'do', 'EVER', 'remember', 'movie', 'was', 'about', '10', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'remember', 'loving', 'so', 'much', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'movie', 'awhile', 'could', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'remember', 'title', 'knew', 'had', 'words', 'Spell', 'Freedom', 'was', ""'m"", 'happy', 'determination', 'paid', 'off', 'was', 'inspirational', 'enough', 'have', 'such', 'impact', 'remember', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'do', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'release', 'DVD', 'soon', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'turn', 'DVD', 'list', 'hope', 'Girl', 'who', 'spelled', 'Freedom', 'one', 'top', 'lists']",The Girl Who Spelled Freedom VHS
240488,A36AH31X84FIC8,630027635X,Brent Hilton,"[4, 5]","Have to agree with all the other reviewers on here, The Girl Who Spelled Freedom should be released on DVD. Soon along with Double Switch, The Not Quite Human series of films, The Leftovers, and Justin Case with George Carlin.Student Exchange, The Blue Yonder Aka: Time Flyer, the Undergrads, Bigfoot, The Richest Cat in The World, The Mr. Boogedy series, even Rock n' Roll Mom, The Liberators (if you have to put a stupid disclaimer on it because of a few racial comments in the film, but that language was part of the time in which the film was based on so I think it's ok,  release it and don't let that good one rot in a vault forever) it's about Liberators freeing slaves and giving them freedom it's quite a good and moving movie. And 14 Going on 30, I love that movie would love to see it again. Even Ask Max, Mark Twain and Me, Earth Star Voyager, The Thanksgiving Promise, Brat Patrol. Get with it Disney these films need to be released on DVD sometime and guess what people would buy them too. What are you afraid making a profit? This film The Girl Who Spelled Freedom is a very sweet tender and moving picture for all ages. Wayne Rogers does a great as one of the parents helping teach the Girl english, the scene that stuck with me all these years would have to the opening shot with Girl running through the jungle in the rain hiding with her family I believe and the spelling bee part near the end of film, Disney ought of proud of this title, it's about overcoming obstacles in one's life I have great memories of this film and the others films mentioned too. Please Get with it You guys at Disney. Also Where Song Of South?",5,Umm Disney Where is the DVD of this title and many others?,1245283200,"06 18, 2009",2009,1640,"['Have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Spelled', 'Freedom', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Soon', 'Double', 'Switch', 'Not', 'Quite', 'Human', 'series', 'films', 'Leftovers', 'Justin', 'Case', 'George', 'Carlin.Student', 'Exchange', 'Blue', 'Yonder', 'Aka', 'Time', 'Flyer', 'Undergrads', 'Bigfoot', 'Richest', 'Cat', 'World', 'Mr.', 'Boogedy', 'series', 'even', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'Mom', 'Liberators', 'have', 'put', 'stupid', 'disclaimer', 'few', 'racial', 'comments', 'film', 'language', 'was', 'part', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'think', 'ok', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'good', 'one', 'rot', 'vault', 'forever', 'Liberators', 'freeing', 'slaves', 'giving', 'freedom', 'quite', 'good', 'moving', 'movie', '14', 'Going', '30', 'love', 'movie', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'again', 'Even', 'Ask', 'Max', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Me', 'Earth', 'Star', 'Voyager', 'Thanksgiving', 'Promise', 'Brat', 'Patrol', 'Get', 'Disney', 'films', 'need', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'sometime', 'guess', 'what', 'people', 'would', 'buy', 'too', 'What', 'are', 'afraid', 'making', 'profit', 'film', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Spelled', 'Freedom', 'very', 'sweet', 'tender', 'moving', 'picture', 'ages', 'Wayne', 'Rogers', 'great', 'one', 'parents', 'helping', 'teach', 'Girl', 'english', 'scene', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'opening', 'shot', 'Girl', 'running', 'jungle', 'rain', 'hiding', 'family', 'believe', 'spelling', 'bee', 'part', 'end', 'film', 'Disney', 'ought', 'proud', 'title', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'one', 'life', 'have', 'great', 'memories', 'film', 'others', 'films', 'mentioned', 'too', 'Please', 'Get', 'guys', 'Disney', 'Also', 'Where', 'Song', 'South']",The Girl Who Spelled Freedom VHS

Despite the terrible war in her country, she and her family escaped the nightmare and later settled in north America. This Cambodian girl and her family knew nothing about US and english.

IMHO, wouldn't her background actually make her MORE likely to succeed in events like this, rather than less likely?

240491,A18ECWTWII1KSU,630027635X,susannah,"[0, 1]","Just saw this film again on VHS, after seeing it so many years ago, and it is still such a good film. I too wonder why it is not on DVD. I also think that it is very important for American kids to see this, now more than ever, as kids' feelings of  entitlement have gone through the roof. Linn is just heartbreaking, with her courage, spirit and amazing intelligence!The two things that bothered me, and I have seen this also in accounts of international adoptions from the 1970s, were that it didn't occur to the Thrashes to learn ONE word of Cambodian, in order to make even the most basic communication possible. There was a scene in the film where Mr. Thrash is learning the names of some body parts in Cambodian, but they had been there for many weeks by then, with no way to communicate, and it was done more as a game than as a basis for actual communication. People used to feel that English was the only language, and that those coming here had to learn it or lump it. I sincerely hope that people adopting internationally now have a more humane and accepting approach. The other thing that bugged was the Thrashes' daughter, who was absolutely spoiled rotten. She spoiled the movie for me the first time I saw it too. Even though she knew the level of deprivation and loss the Yanns had suffered, even though she knew of the courage and strength it took for them to come to a new world and try to survive, all she did was whine and complain about not getting new sneakers or because her mama wasn't there to see her cheerleading tryouts one time, as she continued to live in her comfortable home with everything she wanted around her. Poor baby!!!  I wanted her parents to have a ""come to Jesus"" meeting with her but they never did, just went on coddling and apologizing to her.Otherwise, great film, and after Googling, I have learned that all the Yann kids went on to successful lives!
