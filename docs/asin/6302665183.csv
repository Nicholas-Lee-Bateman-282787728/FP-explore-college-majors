While in the caverns a group  of soldiers are attacked and killed.Meanwhile Adrian (sp?) informs the  Doctor he wishes to return to his home in E-Space.  This angers the Doctor  since his only visit to E-Space was by accident.  The Doctor and his  companions are captured by the Earth force and all are attacked by a couple  of androids being controled by the Cybermen.After destroying the  androids and diarming a bomb planted by them, the Doctor discovers where  the bombs arming signal came from and he, his companions, and the Earth  force enter the Tardis and arive on a freighter bound for Earth.  It is  here that they discover that the Cybermen have a huge invasion force hidden  in the cargo areas of the ship.  Once the Cybermen take over the ship, they  force turn the freighter into a flying bomb to destroy Earth.  They force  the Doctor to take the Cyber-Leader and a guard on board the Tardis while  leaving the surving Earth force troops and Adrian on the doomed freighter.  Adrian manages to crack part of the Cyber controls which sends the ship  backward in time by 65 million years.  While attempting to crack the last  control, a damaged Cyberman destroys the ships controls and dooms Adrian as  the ship slams into Earth.If I'm not mistaken, this episode marks the  only time a companion of the Doctor has been killed.

327012,A11GO5VA74HD8K,6302665183,Crazy Fox,"[2, 2]","And for that matter, when did we last have the pleasure of viewing a Cybermen storyline on ""Doctor Who""? Okay, only a few months ago thanks to the technological magic of DVDs, but for audiences watching the show back when it first aired we're talking the better part of a whole decade. The first of the four episodes is cleverly structured too so that their return must have come as quite a shock (appropriately enough) at the time, an effect somewhat lost now--yep, there's no mistaking that big looming Cyberface on the DVD cover. But shock value aside and accounting for a few glitches, ""Earthshock"" still holds its own as a fine ""Doctor Who"" story.First things first, it's hard to go wrong with the Cybermen, ruthlessly cold cyborgs and quintessential ""Doctor Who"" villains who've traded in their individuality and emotional sensitivity for heightened physical prowess and sharp intellectual power (not that the transaction's always willing, since the Cybermen often propagate by assimilating others). Their standardized blank faces and level mechanized voices make for an eerie contrast with the Doctor's individuality and eccentricity as well as disturbingly questioning the effect of technological progress on our humanity (I say writing an online review on my computer after having watched this show on a DVD, but okay). Of course all of this helps account for why the Cybermen are compelling in general, but how about in this story in particular? Their updated look is excellent, remaining true to the classic design but newly emphasizing the fact that these are indeed cyborgs rather than merely robots. They are definitely more emotional than in past storylines, especially the Cyber Leader, and this seems gratingly odd throughout the story--granted that it's hard to get drama interacting with an IBM, and realistically speaking some trace of old human emotions like ambition and lust for power must be rattling around in there somewhere inspiring them to conquer, assimilate, and thereby establish Cyber empires. So their portrayal here is imaginably plausible if a tad unusual.The plot itself is interesting, combining a disarmingly contemporary premise of an enemy attempting to disrupt peace negotiations and alliance formations through what amounts to a terrorist attack with an intriguingly peculiar take on what wiped out the dinosaurs--the latter bit linking the very beginning and very end of the story in a cleverly foreshadowing manner. The directing is tight, dynamic, and fast-paced for ""Doctor Who"" of this time, giving the tale an unusually tense sense of suspense and, well, shock (which is also indicative of how dramatic conventions were gradually evolving, since this kind of directing and editing seems more akin to that of the current ""Doctor Who"" series than it does to that of the show prior). And there are lots of neat little touches, number one of which surely must be the Cybermen reviewing their files on the Doctor, giving us precious glimpses of classic episodes in the process--all as the Cyber Leader comments with audible irritation in his voice that for a supposedly non-interfering Time Lord this one calling himself the Doctor does nothing BUT interfere. There are quite a few glitches, too, I'm afraid, one of the worst of which is that Earth millions of years ago is made to look exactly like Earth today, as if there were no such thing as continental drift--this would be a fairly venial sin if the producer hadn't beforehand made a point of his intention to upgrade the show's scientific caliber. Finally, wrapping all of this up (the good and the bad along with the ugly) is a shockingly unpredictable conclusion that serves to remind us that the threats the Doctor and his companions deal with in their fantastic travels are real and potentially deadly.",4,"""When did you last have the pleasure of smelling a flower, watching a sunset, eating a well-prepared meal?""",1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,3808,"['matter', 'when', 'did', 'last', 'have', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'Cybermen', 'storyline', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Okay', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'thanks', 'technological', 'magic', 'DVDs', 'audiences', 'watching', 'show', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'aired', ""'re"", 'talking', 'better', 'part', 'whole', 'decade', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'cleverly', 'structured', 'too', 'so', 'return', 'must', 'have', 'come', 'quite', 'shock', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'time', 'effect', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'now', 'yep', 'mistaking', 'big', 'looming', 'Cyberface', 'DVD', 'cover', 'shock', 'value', 'aside', 'accounting', 'few', 'glitches', 'Earthshock', 'still', 'own', 'fine', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story.First', 'things', 'first', 'hard', 'go', 'wrong', 'Cybermen', 'ruthlessly', 'cold', 'cyborgs', 'quintessential', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'villains', 'who', ""'ve"", 'traded', 'individuality', 'emotional', 'sensitivity', 'heightened', 'physical', 'prowess', 'sharp', 'intellectual', 'power', 'not', 'transaction', 'always', 'willing', 'Cybermen', 'often', 'propagate', 'assimilating', 'others', 'standardized', 'blank', 'level', 'mechanized', 'voices', 'make', 'eerie', 'contrast', 'Doctor', 'individuality', 'eccentricity', 'as', 'well', 'disturbingly', 'questioning', 'effect', 'technological', 'progress', 'humanity', 'say', 'writing', 'online', 'review', 'computer', 'having', 'watched', 'show', 'DVD', 'okay', 'course', 'account', 'why', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'compelling', 'general', 'how', 'about', 'story', 'particular', 'updated', 'look', 'excellent', 'remaining', 'true', 'classic', 'design', 'newly', 'emphasizing', 'fact', 'are', 'indeed', 'cyborgs', 'rather', 'merely', 'robots', 'are', 'definitely', 'more', 'emotional', 'past', 'storylines', 'especially', 'Cyber', 'Leader', 'gratingly', 'odd', 'story', 'granted', 'hard', 'get', 'drama', 'interacting', 'IBM', 'realistically', 'speaking', 'trace', 'old', 'human', 'emotions', 'ambition', 'lust', 'power', 'must', 'be', 'rattling', 'around', 'somewhere', 'inspiring', 'conquer', 'assimilate', 'thereby', 'establish', 'Cyber', 'empires', 'portrayal', 'here', 'imaginably', 'plausible', 'tad', 'unusual.The', 'plot', 'interesting', 'combining', 'disarmingly', 'contemporary', 'premise', 'enemy', 'attempting', 'disrupt', 'peace', 'negotiations', 'alliance', 'formations', 'what', 'amounts', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'intriguingly', 'peculiar', 'take', 'wiped', 'out', 'dinosaurs', 'latter', 'bit', 'linking', 'very', 'beginning', 'very', 'end', 'story', 'cleverly', 'foreshadowing', 'manner', 'directing', 'tight', 'dynamic', 'fast-paced', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'time', 'giving', 'tale', 'unusually', 'tense', 'sense', 'suspense', 'well', 'shock', 'also', 'indicative', 'how', 'dramatic', 'conventions', 'were', 'gradually', 'evolving', 'kind', 'directing', 'editing', 'more', 'akin', 'current', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'show', 'prior', 'are', 'lots', 'neat', 'little', 'touches', 'number', 'one', 'surely', 'must', 'be', 'Cybermen', 'reviewing', 'files', 'Doctor', 'giving', 'precious', 'glimpses', 'classic', 'episodes', 'process', 'Cyber', 'Leader', 'comments', 'audible', 'irritation', 'voice', 'supposedly', 'non-interfering', 'Time', 'Lord', 'one', 'calling', 'Doctor', 'nothing', 'BUT', 'interfere', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'glitches', 'too', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'one', 'worst', 'Earth', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'made', 'look', 'exactly', 'Earth', 'today', 'were', 'such', 'thing', 'continental', 'drift', 'would', 'be', 'fairly', 'venial', 'sin', 'producer', 'had', ""n't"", 'beforehand', 'made', 'point', 'intention', 'upgrade', 'show', 'scientific', 'caliber', 'Finally', 'wrapping', 'up', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'shockingly', 'unpredictable', 'conclusion', 'remind', 'threats', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'deal', 'fantastic', 'travels', 'are', 'real', 'potentially', 'deadly']",Doctor Who - Earthshock VHS
327013,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6302665183,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[14, 15]","Earth, 2526.  Following an argument with Adric, who's tired of being teased, made fun of, not taken seriously, and who wants to go back to his home planet, the Doctor goes out to a cave full of fossilized dinosaurs in the walls.Meanwhile, soldiers under Lieutenant Scott enter the caves investigating the deaths of seven paleontologists and geologists, led by Professor Kyle, the survivor, who says the expedition was beset by faults and sabotage.  However, some troops become casualties of two shadowy and sleek androids whose weapons turn their victims into organic puddles.The Doctor is accused of being the murders of Kyle's colleagues, but then the androids attack.  They're defeated, but the Doctor traces their controllers to a freighter, whose captain, the irascible Briggs, is anxious to reach Earth to deliver a cargo of 15,000 silos and get a bonus.  But the Doctor and Adric are accused of murdering two crewmembers and sent to the bridge.  There, they discover that there have been brief power losses aboard the ship, and later, the controller of the androids.  Look at the video cover for the answer.The Cyberleader and the Doctor get into an interesting discussion on the weakness and strengths of emotions, and in my current state, I find myself siding with the CyberLeader.Cyberleader:  I see Time Lords have have emotional feelings.  Surely a great weakness in one so powerful.Doctor:  Emotions have their uses.Cyberleader:  They restrict and curtail the intellect and logic of the mind.Doctor:  They also enhance life!  When did you last have the pleasure of smelling a flower, watching a sunset?Cyberleader:  These things are irrelevant.Doctor:  For some people, small beautiful events is what life is all about.The Cyberleader ruthlessly demonstrates that the Doctor's concern for Tegan is a weakness and that he can bend the Doctor to his will by simply threatening to kill her.Many things succeed in this story, as the scene of Cybermen bursting out of their metal silos, the shot of them marching in unison at the cliffhanger of Episode 3, accompanied by a musical synthesizer march.  This redesign of the Cybermen has them in the silver fighter pilot-like outfits, which marks the debut of the contemporary Cybermen, and the portrayal of the CyberLeader and CyberLieutenant by David Banks and Mark Hardy.  Another is the way the Doctor immobilizes a Cybermen in a door like a fly caught in amber.Some flaws include the Cybermen's jaws, which are transparent and one can see the actors' mouths moving beneath.  Another is a scene in Episode 3, where Scott examines the dead freighter crew.  Down below, a woman can be seen reading the script!  Also, when Scott is contemplating which of two Cybermen to kill in Episode 3, his targets can be seen talking to each other, using chatty hand gestures.  So unlike rational Cybermen!This was the third and last time a companion was killed off in the series history, the first two being Katarina and Sara Kingdom in the no-longer complete Dalek Master Plan (1965).  Matthew Waterhouse (Adric) was so upset that he refused to speak to producer John Nathan-Turner for a few weeks.  Adric has been considered the worst Doctor Who companion, but that's hardly Waterhouse's fault.  It has to be said that Adric's character was poorly written and developed and Waterhouse did his best.  Waterhouse does have cameo appearances in two other Peter Davison stories.Despite the flaws and it being a simple action-adventure story, Earthshock works due to the return of the snazzily designed Cybermen and the unexpected death of Adric.",5,"So, we meet again...Doctor!",1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,3588,"['Earth', '2526', 'Following', 'argument', 'Adric', 'who', 'tired', 'being', 'teased', 'made', 'fun', 'not', 'taken', 'seriously', 'who', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'planet', 'Doctor', 'out', 'cave', 'full', 'fossilized', 'dinosaurs', 'walls.Meanwhile', 'soldiers', 'Lieutenant', 'Scott', 'enter', 'caves', 'investigating', 'deaths', 'seven', 'paleontologists', 'geologists', 'led', 'Professor', 'Kyle', 'survivor', 'who', 'expedition', 'was', 'beset', 'faults', 'sabotage', 'However', 'troops', 'become', 'casualties', 'two', 'shadowy', 'sleek', 'androids', 'weapons', 'turn', 'victims', 'organic', 'puddles.The', 'Doctor', 'accused', 'being', 'murders', 'Kyle', 'colleagues', 'then', 'androids', 'attack', ""'re"", 'defeated', 'Doctor', 'traces', 'controllers', 'freighter', 'captain', 'irascible', 'Briggs', 'anxious', 'reach', 'Earth', 'deliver', 'cargo', '15,000', 'silos', 'get', 'bonus', 'Doctor', 'Adric', 'are', 'accused', 'murdering', 'two', 'crewmembers', 'sent', 'bridge', 'discover', 'have', 'been', 'brief', 'power', 'losses', 'ship', 'later', 'controller', 'androids', 'Look', 'video', 'cover', 'answer.The', 'Cyberleader', 'Doctor', 'get', 'interesting', 'discussion', 'weakness', 'strengths', 'emotions', 'current', 'state', 'find', 'siding', 'CyberLeader.Cyberleader', 'see', 'Time', 'Lords', 'have', 'have', 'emotional', 'feelings', 'Surely', 'great', 'weakness', 'one', 'so', 'powerful.Doctor', 'Emotions', 'have', 'uses.Cyberleader', 'restrict', 'curtail', 'intellect', 'logic', 'mind.Doctor', 'also', 'enhance', 'life', 'When', 'did', 'last', 'have', 'pleasure', 'smelling', 'flower', 'watching', 'sunset', 'Cyberleader', 'things', 'are', 'irrelevant.Doctor', 'people', 'small', 'beautiful', 'events', 'what', 'life', 'about.The', 'Cyberleader', 'ruthlessly', 'Doctor', 'concern', 'Tegan', 'weakness', 'can', 'bend', 'Doctor', 'will', 'simply', 'threatening', 'kill', 'her.Many', 'things', 'succeed', 'story', 'scene', 'Cybermen', 'bursting', 'metal', 'silos', 'shot', 'marching', 'unison', 'cliffhanger', 'Episode', '3', 'accompanied', 'musical', 'synthesizer', 'march', 'redesign', 'Cybermen', 'silver', 'fighter', 'pilot-like', 'outfits', 'debut', 'contemporary', 'Cybermen', 'portrayal', 'CyberLeader', 'CyberLieutenant', 'David', 'Banks', 'Mark', 'Hardy', 'way', 'Doctor', 'Cybermen', 'door', 'fly', 'caught', 'amber.Some', 'flaws', 'include', 'Cybermen', 'jaws', 'are', 'transparent', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'actors', 'mouths', 'moving', 'beneath', 'scene', 'Episode', '3', 'where', 'Scott', 'dead', 'freighter', 'crew', 'Down', 'woman', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'reading', 'script', 'Also', 'when', 'Scott', 'contemplating', 'two', 'Cybermen', 'kill', 'Episode', '3', 'targets', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'talking', 'other', 'using', 'chatty', 'hand', 'gestures', 'So', 'rational', 'Cybermen', 'was', 'third', 'last', 'time', 'companion', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'series', 'history', 'first', 'two', 'being', 'Katarina', 'Sara', 'Kingdom', 'no-longer', 'complete', 'Dalek', 'Master', 'Plan', '1965', 'Matthew', 'Waterhouse', 'Adric', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'refused', 'speak', 'producer', 'John', 'Nathan-Turner', 'few', 'weeks', 'Adric', 'been', 'considered', 'worst', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'companion', 'hardly', 'Waterhouse', 'fault', 'be', 'said', 'Adric', 'character', 'was', 'poorly', 'written', 'developed', 'Waterhouse', 'did', 'best', 'Waterhouse', 'have', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'two', 'other', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'stories.Despite', 'flaws', 'being', 'simple', 'action-adventure', 'story', 'Earthshock', 'due', 'return', 'snazzily', 'designed', 'Cybermen', 'unexpected', 'death', 'Adric']",Doctor Who - Earthshock VHS

The acting is sound on all levels, with special credit due Peter Davison, whose performance raises the tension level as his realization of the true purpose of certain events adds to the overall mood of the piece. The redesign of the Cybermen was criticized by some, but the see-through mouthpiece adds to the effect of the Cybermen's menace, rather than detracting, by allowing us to see the transformed humanity within the outfit. This is one of the best ones to show to new Doctor Who viewers, as it is accessible to those who've never seen a Cyberman adventure, and has high emotional moments -- especially the ending, which works on every level. One of Davison's best by far, and definitely one of the best Cyber-Adventures. A must-own. Now if only they'd get rid of that ridiculous vunerability to gold, everything would be fine.

All the Doctor Who DVDs have great extras and are a large improvement over the earlier VHS versions.""Earthshock"" is one of my favorite Doctor Who stories of the Peter Davison era.  There are many reasons for this.  All Cybermen stories have a since of wonder, mystery, and terror all at the same time.  While not moving the history or culture of the Cyber race forward much, the story lives up to the wonder, mystery, and terror aspect.  From a costume standpoint the Cyber suits have been updated since ""Revenge Of The Cybermen"" and they look 100% better.  The story is a fast paced (by classic Doctor Who standards) mystery/adventure story that hooks you and doesn't let go.The incorporation of the storyline explaining that the Cybermen are responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs is pure brilliance!However, the greatest thing about ""Earthshock"" is the character development.  This is perhaps the best character development story in all of classic Doctor Who history.  This story begins with an arguement between the Doctor and Adric about returning to E-space.  During the course of the story the Doctor and Adrec make up and show their deep respect and friendship for each other in the process.  During the arguement Nyssa works to console Adrec and Tegan works to bring the Doctor around.  The whole Tardis family swings into action to mend emotional fences.  This seemingly simple storyline plays out so well that the audience is able to empathize and invest in the characters in a way that has never happenned before or since in the classic Doctor Who series.  Even better is the fact that all this character development takes place in the midst of an extremely compelling and action filled story.  The crown jewel of this episode is the death of Adrec at the end.  After we are taken down the path of learning to care about the Tardis family Adrec's death is even more devastating than it would have been at the end of any other Who adventure.",5,The Cybermen Are Back!!,1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,2067,"['review', 'mainly', 'story', 'Earthshock', 'not', 'extras', 'technical', 'aspects', 'DVD', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'DVDs', 'have', 'great', 'extras', 'are', 'large', 'improvement', 'earlier', 'VHS', 'versions', 'Earthshock', 'one', 'favorite', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'era', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'Cybermen', 'stories', 'have', 'wonder', 'mystery', 'terror', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'moving', 'history', 'culture', 'Cyber', 'race', 'forward', 'much', 'story', 'up', 'wonder', 'mystery', 'terror', 'aspect', 'costume', 'standpoint', 'Cyber', 'suits', 'have', 'been', 'updated', 'Revenge', 'Cybermen', 'look', '100', '%', 'better', 'story', 'fast', 'paced', 'classic', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'standards', 'mystery/adventure', 'story', ""n't"", 'let', 'go.The', 'incorporation', 'storyline', 'explaining', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'responsible', 'extinction', 'dinosaurs', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'However', 'greatest', 'thing', 'Earthshock', 'character', 'development', 'perhaps', 'best', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'classic', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'history', 'story', 'arguement', 'Doctor', 'Adric', 'returning', 'E-space', 'course', 'story', 'Doctor', 'Adrec', 'make', 'up', 'show', 'deep', 'respect', 'friendship', 'other', 'process', 'arguement', 'Nyssa', 'console', 'Adrec', 'Tegan', 'bring', 'Doctor', 'whole', 'Tardis', 'family', 'swings', 'action', 'mend', 'emotional', 'fences', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'storyline', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'audience', 'able', 'empathize', 'invest', 'characters', 'way', 'never', 'happenned', 'classic', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'Even', 'better', 'fact', 'character', 'development', 'place', 'midst', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'action', 'filled', 'story', 'crown', 'jewel', 'episode', 'death', 'Adrec', 'end', 'are', 'taken', 'down', 'path', 'learning', 'care', 'Tardis', 'family', 'Adrec', 'death', 'even', 'more', 'devastating', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'other', 'Who', 'adventure']",Doctor Who - Earthshock VHS

Firstly because they did NOT become extinct at the KT boundary and secondly because I don't believe it was an extraterrestrial collision with Earth of ANY kind which caused their extinction but the Biological Earth.Apart from this the story is interesting but I cannot say that I like the characters.

There was no cold  logic to their methods in this story, in fact, as the Doctor remarks,  &quot;This one is quite flippant.&quot;  The Cybermen are to Doctor Who  what the Borg are to Star Trek.  And the universe knows them to be a great  threat.  Thus the story involves the Cybermen disrupting a meeting of a  number of other worldly dignataries on Earth.  The story is so full of plot  holes and the pacing so slow, it's kinda painful to watch.  I give the  story three stars simply because of the handling of the death of Adric.

Dinosaur fossils provide a unexpected and uniting theme to the episodes.

Since it is obvious from the cover art that Cybermen are involved in the story, I'll comment on them a bit.  Like other stories filmed in the 1980's, the cybermen tend to be emotional, which is somewhat different from the way they have been portrayed before and after.

Loria,"[5, 7]","The return of an old enemy, the threat of annihilation of all life on Earth, and actual  death of a compianion, Earthshock finds the 5th and youngest Doctor, PETER DAVISON at his best in this 4 parter. He displays the same short temper and irritable nature as his first incarnation along with the humanity and vulnerability of the 2nd Doctor. This excellent 19th season story arc contains one of the most emotionally powerful finale in the show's original 26-year run. A scientific expedition in a cave system on 25th-century Earth is wiped out. An military rescue unit led by Lieutenant Scott (James Warwick) and sole expedition survivor Professor Kyle (Claire Clifford) go in to recover the bodies following a mysterious massacre, developing into tense action on a space freighter bound for Earth carrying a deadly cargo of Cybermen, absent from the series for 7 years (since Tom Baker's first season ( ""Revenge of the Cybermen""). At the time the return was kept fair  secret, as death of a regular character, by the time it aired in the US, both cats were out of the bag (which made the ""near misses""  even more effective than your usual Dr. Who story).With a moody dark mood remnisent of the movie ALIEN, and WITH action & Tight-pacing reminiscent of the movie ALIENS (which it predates), doesn't lead time to include some of the camp-moments sometimes blighting the series in the `80s, and with a notable, but over-the-top guest turn from Beryl Reid as the ship's captain, Earthshock is one of the 5th Doctor's finest adventures (along with ""Caves of Androzani""). Another problem of the 5th Doctors run is neatly solved, on many levels, the overfull TARDIS crew. Nyssa (and some guest-stars) being sidelined in the TARDIS for half of this very story since there is nothing for her to do illustrates why one companion had to go, and I think that the killing off of a companion was a bold and brilliant move by producer JNT. It defies reason, even in a fantasy series to have the Doctor's companions all survive and for them to be victorious in every episode. Plus, as the character everybody (at the time) loved to hate does die, in so heroic a fashion, it  redeems his irksome character ( an infinitely superior end compared to sparing Westley Crusher in ST:TNG).The story is first-class enough to overlook a few plot holes and by the end they simply won't matter; when the final credits roll in silence the effect is as powerful now as it was shocking to audiences back in 1981. The ending is brilliant. It's shocking, it's moving; it's just fantastic. The credits roll silently over Adric's destroyed badge, and you realise that the Doctor doesn't always win, and it makes you love him even more. From this point on in the fifth Doctor's era, there is the feeling that no one is safe...Doctor Who: Earthshock is presented in the original broadcast with a near-flawless picture. The extras begin with a strong 32-minute documentary, more retrospective than making-of. Then comes the commentary, with the complete TARDIS crew!:Peter Davison, Janet Fielding (Tegan), Sarah Sutton (Nyssa) and Matthew Waterhouse (Adric). It is much better than the Visitation commentary, although only Davison seems to know what his talking about, while the other cast members seem to remember very little, with Fielding enthralled by the fashion aspects of the crew. Both commentary and the episodes have optional subtitles. The documentary, ""Putting the `Shock' Into Earthshock"" is one of the most interesting produced thus far, featuring contributions from the cast & director Peter Grimwade, writer Eric Saward, Mark Gatiss, Steve Moffatt and others. Other special feature options include detailed on-screen information subtitles, an isolated musical score, and the ability to watch Earthshock with the original FX or with selected effects shots replaced with new computer graphics (don't worry it is very subtle but very effective, perfect for showing to someone who started watching in 2005). There's a scored, five-minute photo gallery that even includes a shot from the recording of the commentary, assemblage of footage shot on film and a 10-minute section ""Did You See?"" which looks back on the 40 year-old show's aliens.There are DVD 'Easter Eggs,' if you navigate down to the special features option on the first menu and press select, then move down to the 40th Anniversary Celebration option and hit left to highlight a hidden Doctor Who logo then hit select, you'll get a comedy sketch featuring a short clip from ""Earthshock"" that's been dubbed.Possible DW drinking games: (drink

Growing up I was introduced to the good Doctor through PBS' broadcasts of the old series.  I think just about every American Who fan cut their teeth on Tom Baker's incarnation, and he was definitely a great Doctor, but Davison just won me over more.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that I was getting older whenever I got a chance to watch Davison.  I do not know.  Well, on to this DVD.""Earthshock"" opens with the mysterious loss of members of an archaelogical dig team.  Naturally the Doctor, along with Nyssa, Tegan, and Adric, pops in and determines to help the surviving team members.  What they find are overly protective androids and a bomb strong enough to destroy Earth.  Who put it there and how can they be stopped?  Only the Doctor and his companions can find that out.This is by far one of the best Peter Davison era Who serials.  It features quick pacing, suspense, and two huge ""shocks"" for the viewer.  The first shock is the revelation of who the mysterious villain is.  The second one involves one of the Doctor's companions and how they foil the enemy's plans.Not only is this one of the best Who serials, it's also one of the best DVDs.  It's packed with all of the standard Who special features like ""Who's who,"" a wonderful commentary, and a photo gallery, but what sets this disc apart is the fun ""Did You See?"" episode that covers the Doctor's greatest and most loved (or feared) monsters and the documentary ""Putting The 'Shock' Into 'Earthshock'"" that includes interviews with the actors, production team, and fans.  Also of note is a hilarious easter egg from the JBC.This serial has aged better than most of the Doctor's classic adventures.  There are a few frames in the DVD transfer that reveal some wear but they don't interfere with the story.With excellent pacing, a legendary villain, and an ending that will leave the unaware in disbelief, ""Earthshock"" ranks high in the company of the greatest ""Doctor Who"" adventures.

Why this lame ""action""-adventure is more appreciated than cerebral stuff like The Aztecs and Kinda is a mystery to me...But then, I often disagree with those fans who like Doctor Who best when it's ""scary"" and focused on monsters. I've never found Doctor Who to be scary, and most of its action and horror sequences fall flat (with the exception of certain scenes from the Pertwee era, which had some nice stunt work). And though it may be tempting to compare Earthshock with Hollywood movies like Aliens, I'm afraid that Doctor Who becomes laughable when viewed on such terms.So, while Doctor Who often has very creative imagery, it is definitely not a spectacle-based program. To succeed, it requires brains and a (properly controlled) sense of humor. Earthshock is not particularly intelligent; the plot has massive holes, and the characters are underdeveloped. And it is almost totally humorless. Really, this plays out more like a bad episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation than Doctor Who, which typically has a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. Even in his Gothic horror episodes, Tom Baker was always ready with a quip and a smile; here, Peter Davison is so sincere that he comes across as a total snooze.Don't misunderstand me; I don't like it when Doctor Who is *too* goofy. But I also don't like it when the show tries to ape Hollywood action movies, as it does here, and trips up. It certainly doesn't help that the Cybermen are boring villains (they have no emotions ... yawn) with bland designs. All three of the Doctor's companions, meanwhile, are non-characters played by awful actors. Also (watch out - spoiler coming up, of the mild and dated variety), who cares that one of the companions dies at the end of this story? Why do fans get so broken up about the passing of a character no one likes, played by an actor so bad he makes us all cringe...?Fortunately, the DVD makes up for the story's shortcomings (somewhat). The making-of documentary features some interesting ""talking heads"" stuff, and there's a funny special feature featuring a claymation Adric under attack by dinosaurs. Less successful are the new CGI special effects, which barely improve on the originals; for a properly done special edition, see the more recent release of Day of the Daleks, which blows this away.",2,"Mediocre episode, good-ish DVD",1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,2384,"['Earthshock', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'overrated', 'episodes', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'ever', 'made', 'Why', 'lame', 'action', '-adventure', 'more', 'appreciated', 'cerebral', 'stuff', 'Aztecs', 'Kinda', 'mystery', 'then', 'often', 'disagree', 'fans', 'who', 'like', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'best', 'when', 'scary', 'focused', 'monsters', ""'ve"", 'never', 'found', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'be', 'scary', 'most', 'action', 'horror', 'sequences', 'fall', 'flat', 'exception', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Pertwee', 'era', 'had', 'nice', 'stunt', 'work', 'may', 'be', 'tempting', 'compare', 'Earthshock', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Aliens', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'laughable', 'when', 'viewed', 'such', 'terms.So', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'often', 'very', 'creative', 'imagery', 'definitely', 'not', 'spectacle-based', 'program', 'succeed', 'brains', 'properly', 'controlled', 'sense', 'humor', 'Earthshock', 'not', 'particularly', 'intelligent', 'plot', 'massive', 'holes', 'characters', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'almost', 'totally', 'humorless', 'Really', 'out', 'more', 'bad', 'episode', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'typically', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'sense', 'humor', 'Even', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'episodes', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'was', 'always', 'ready', 'quip', 'smile', 'here', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'so', 'sincere', 'across', 'total', 'snooze.Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'Doctor', 'Who', '*too*', 'goofy', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'show', 'ape', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'movies', 'here', 'up', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'help', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'boring', 'villains', 'have', 'emotions', 'yawn', 'bland', 'designs', 'three', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'meanwhile', 'are', 'non-characters', 'played', 'awful', 'actors', 'Also', 'watch', 'out', 'spoiler', 'coming', 'up', 'mild', 'dated', 'variety', 'who', 'one', 'companions', 'end', 'story', 'Why', 'do', 'fans', 'get', 'so', 'broken', 'up', 'passing', 'character', 'one', 'played', 'actor', 'so', 'bad', 'cringe', 'Fortunately', 'DVD', 'up', 'story', 'shortcomings', 'somewhat', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'features', 'interesting', 'talking', 'heads', 'stuff', 'funny', 'special', 'feature', 'featuring', 'claymation', 'Adric', 'attack', 'dinosaurs', 'Less', 'successful', 'are', 'new', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'barely', 'improve', 'originals', 'properly', 'done', 'special', 'edition', 'see', 'more', 'recent', 'release', 'Day', 'Daleks', 'away']",Doctor Who - Earthshock VHS
327026,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,6302665183,Matthew Kresal,"[0, 1]","It is hard to imagine the effect that Earthshock had on its original viewers back in 1982. With its plot twists now easily revealed on the art work for the VHS and now, of course, DVD versions of the story. Despite that fact Earthshock remains a well paced adventure that packs a punch for its viewers.Earthshock features some of the better performances from the TARDIS crew of the time.  Say what you will about an overloaded TARDIS with Peter Davison's fifth Doctor, Janet Fielding's Teagan, Sarah Sutton's Nyssa and Matthew Waterhouse's Adric but hear me out. For Davison and Waterhouse at least this would prove to be some of their best work in the series, particularly in parts three and four. With this being Waterhouse's final story, there seems to have been much emphasis placed on Adric and his relationship with the fifth Doctor which gives this story some distinction.  While this emphasis takes away from Teagan and Nyssa, the finale of part four gives everyone a chance to show off in what is one of the series (original or new series for that matter) biggest surprise endings.There's also a good supporting cast as well. Amongst the supporting cast are terrific performances from James Warwick, Clare Clifford, June Bland and Alec Sabin amongst others. There's also Beryl Reid as Captain Briggs of the freighter where much of the story takes place. While Reid (an award winning actress in her own right) gives a commendable performance there are certainly moments where her credibility is stretched very thin. Yet the true highlights of the supporting cast lies not in the people but in the ""surprise villains"" of the story: the Cybermen.After quite a few appearances in the 1960's, the Cybermen disappeared from Doctor Who after a rather abysmal appearance inDoctor Who - Revenge of the Cybermen. Seven years later Earthshock would reinvent and reintroduce the silver giants. In what would prove to be one of the defining moments of the series in the 1980's the Cybermen suddenly changed from the not so menacing men in suits of their previous appearance to be a truly menacing force. The ""new look"" Cybermen have a truly inhuman quality to them that makes them as impressive today as they were twenty-six years ago.  Much of that menace is given to them by the actors (especially David Banks and Mark Hardy) who make scenes that could have potential dull like the flashback sequence in part two seem exciting (try imaging the same scene with the Cybermen from Revenge Of The Cybermen for example).  At the end of the day it is a welcomed return that remains as impressive now as it was then.While all of the above are obviously important to how successful of a story Earthshock is, in my mind the success really stems from three men who gave this story its cinematic feel: writer Eric Saward, director Peter Grimwade and composer Malcolm Clarke.  Eric Saward crafted what is almost certainly his finest script for the series with fine dialogue and action combined almost perfectly. The perfect compliment to Saward's script is the direction of Peter Grimwade, who turns the script into a well paced and orchestrated action/adventure that also manages to pack an emotional punch. Last, but no least, is composer Malcolm Clarke whose music brings just the right amount of emphasis to a scene without it being either too intrusive or completely underwhelming. Together the works of these three men make Earthshock amongst the most cinematic Doctor Who stories.The special features wonderfully supplement this story. The highlight is the making of documentary Putting The Shock In Earthshock which proves to be wonderfully insightful on the making of this story. The audio commentary, while not as insightful,  is still a good listen as Davison, Fielding, Sutton, and Waterhouse reminisce about the story and their time on the show in general. There's also some new CGI effects which help to improve of the 1980's effects (especially those in the finale which need it). Then there's an absolutely hilarious DVD Easter egg if you can find it. Add on a few other things and the result is a rather outstanding DVD release.Earthshock features many things. It has terrific performances, to the Cybermen (at quite possibly their best), good writing, fantastic direction and a score to beat, amongst other things.  Above all it is a well paced adventure that packs a punch both action wise and dramatic wise.

J Krankka ""Whovian""","[2, 6]","Just got my copy yesterday of Earthshock.Set includes in the extra department an Audio Commentary with stars Peter Davison,Janet Fielding,Matthew Waterhouse,and Sarah Sutton,and I thought the audio commentary was very good.Peter Davison points goofs out to people such as someone in the back ground getting cought on camera reading a script.Also in the special features section-Putting the Shock Into Earthshock a new exclusive documentary,Location Film Sequences-Contain shots and dialogue cut from the broadcast version,Did you see?-A 1982 BBC review program takes a look at Doctor Who's most memorable monsters,music Only Option,Production Note Option,Photo Gallery and thats about it in the extra section.The DVD also contains two versions of the story the orginal 82 version with orginal 82 effects or a new CGI version with new effects such as a new CGI effect for the climax of the story.I thought Peter Davison's first season outing of Doctor Who was great.Seasons 18,19,20 and 21 was my favorite seasons of Doctor Who in the 80's.You couldnt ask for a better season ender for Tom Baker in season 18,and what a perfect start with Peter Davison in season 19.My only 2 complaints,my first was Adric,I did'nt think he was bad when he was with The 4th Doctor,but with the 5th he was terrible.Tom Baker was like a father figure to Adric,Adric never threw a temper tantrum in season 18,what happen?Well Tom Became Peter and 2 new girls became part of the Tardis crew.I dont think there was a single episode in season 19 that made you wish Adric would get a punch in the nose?No wonder they decided to kill him off in Earthshock.My other complant was Nyssa.It seem like the writers that John Nathan-Turner hired did not know what to do with her,it seemed like she was always getting stuck in the TARDIS.Like in Earthshock,she was only out side the TARDIS once in part One then the rest of the story she stayed in the TARDIS doing nothing.That was sad,because I thought she was perfect,Peter thought so too,and he was very upset when they wrote her out of the show in season 20.Well any way Peter Davison had 3 wonderfull seasons as The Doctor.And it was a great time for Whovians.After Peter left the show would never be the same again.Well that'a another story.Well any way The Earthshock DVD is a great DVD from a great era of the show.",5,Great

This 4-part adventure ranks behind only ""The Caves of Androzani"" among Davison's greatest stories.  Set in the 26th century and opening on Earth, ""Earthshock"" marks the return of the Cybermen to ""Doctor Who"" after an 8-year absence from the show.  Producer John Nathan-Turner had the return of the Cybermen kept secret until the program aired.  The public remained unaware of the Cybermen's involvement until the end of Episode One, when the CyberLeader commands the sentinel androids on Earth to take out the Doctor, his companions and the soldiers who are attempting to open the steel hatch which conceals a bomb.  This bomb could, as the Doctor points out, ""make life intolerable"" for those who survive the explosion.  The script is well-written by Eric Saward, who took the reins as DW's script editor following this story.  And director Peter Grimwade manages to get some great performances from his cast.  The bonus features include a making of featurette (""Putting the 'Shock' into 'Earthshock'""), a 1982 BBC review program looking at some of DW's most memorable monsters (""Did You See?"") and a CGI effects option.

Not seen for years since ""Revenge of the Cybermen"" (1975, during the Tom Baker years), the Cybermen have a new look and a new plan.  Using a bomb set deep within Earth, they will destroy the planet as its government is prepared to host an interplanetary summit aimed at - among other things - an alliance against evils like the Cybermen.  Unfortunately for them, their plan is discovered by The Doctor who luckily (for us) materializes on the scene in his space-time ship (the ""TARDIS"").  With their initial plan foiled, the Cybermen switch gears and hit on a new idea.  They hijack a huge cargo spaceship carrying a veritable army of Cybermen (originally intended to hold what's left of Earth when the bomb explodes), and aim it at Earth like a bomb. Tracing the source of the signal, the Doctor lands on the freighter and battles the Cybermen alongside a pitiful band of human soldiers and the ship's crew.  With his companions - the boy genius Adric, the young but wise Nyssa and the tough but lovely Tegan Jovanka - the Doctor fights a seeming losing battle against the horde of Cybermen holding the ship.This was a great episode on so many levels.  The redesigned Cybermen - see-through mouth-grille and all - are an improvement over the silver-wetsuits of ""Revenge"", and the script plays up on their strengths: their numbers and seemingly boundless cool and aggression.  Cheesy camera work exaggerates their numbers by having the image of a single column of Cybermen ""multiplied"" within a single shot - but we get the point.  (""Who"" fans who can't appreciate the ""see-through mouth"" because we now know that there are people behind the masks, are missing the point - the Cybermen aren't machines, they are mechanized people, the prototypes for the Borg.  We always knew that there was a person behind the mask, but the grille still hides what that person must look like after being ""assimilated"".  Also, individual Cybermen are more vulnerable here than they were in ""Revenge"" (their huge numbers wouldn't be as important if they were as bulletproof as they were in that story).  The scene introducing the Cybermen is perfect - with the cold invaders huddled like a coven of witches around a holographic viewer.  (They don't recognize the Doctor at first, but his spaceship tips them off)  Of course the biggest thing about this story is the end of Adric - there are hints of his leaving from the start of the serial, but the final moments are unforgettable anyway.IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN AN EPISODE OF DOCTOR WHO none of the above will make much sense (a man - a ""timelord"" actually - who changes his appearance every few years, traveling across space and time in a ship looking on the outside like a London police call box, accompanied by a constantly changing cast of companions and battling a wide array of menaces both alien and human).  Still, some episodes embody a sort of humanity that rises above the kooky continuity of the show, and this is one of them, so it's worth a look.  The tragic ending underscores the entire series - times runs out, even for timelords.",4,Man and the Cyberman,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,3149,"['serial', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'brought', 'back', 'favorite', 'menace', 'Cybermen', 'Not', 'seen', 'years', 'Revenge', 'Cybermen', '1975', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'years', 'Cybermen', 'have', 'new', 'look', 'new', 'plan', 'Using', 'bomb', 'set', 'deep', 'Earth', 'will', 'destroy', 'planet', 'government', 'prepared', 'host', 'interplanetary', 'summit', 'aimed', 'other', 'things', 'alliance', 'evils', 'Cybermen', 'Unfortunately', 'plan', 'discovered', 'Doctor', 'who', 'luckily', 'scene', 'space-time', 'ship', 'TARDIS', 'initial', 'plan', 'foiled', 'Cybermen', 'switch', 'gears', 'hit', 'new', 'idea', 'hijack', 'huge', 'cargo', 'spaceship', 'carrying', 'veritable', 'army', 'Cybermen', 'originally', 'intended', 'hold', 'what', 'left', 'Earth', 'when', 'bomb', 'explodes', 'aim', 'Earth', 'bomb', 'Tracing', 'source', 'signal', 'Doctor', 'freighter', 'Cybermen', 'pitiful', 'band', 'human', 'soldiers', 'ship', 'crew', 'companions', 'boy', 'genius', 'Adric', 'young', 'wise', 'Nyssa', 'tough', 'lovely', 'Tegan', 'Jovanka', 'Doctor', 'seeming', 'losing', 'battle', 'horde', 'Cybermen', 'holding', 'ship.This', 'was', 'great', 'episode', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'redesigned', 'Cybermen', 'see-through', 'mouth-grille', 'are', 'improvement', 'silver-wetsuits', 'Revenge', 'script', 'up', 'strengths', 'numbers', 'seemingly', 'boundless', 'cool', 'aggression', 'Cheesy', 'camera', 'work', 'numbers', 'having', 'image', 'single', 'column', 'Cybermen', 'multiplied', 'single', 'shot', 'get', 'point', 'Who', 'fans', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'see-through', 'mouth', 'now', 'know', 'are', 'people', 'masks', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'Cybermen', 'are', ""n't"", 'machines', 'are', 'mechanized', 'people', 'prototypes', 'Borg', 'always', 'knew', 'was', 'person', 'mask', 'grille', 'still', 'what', 'person', 'must', 'look', 'being', 'assimilated', 'Also', 'individual', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'here', 'were', 'Revenge', 'huge', 'numbers', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'important', 'were', 'as', 'bulletproof', 'were', 'story', 'scene', 'introducing', 'Cybermen', 'perfect', 'cold', 'invaders', 'huddled', 'coven', 'witches', 'holographic', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Doctor', 'first', 'spaceship', 'off', 'course', 'biggest', 'thing', 'story', 'end', 'Adric', 'are', 'hints', 'leaving', 'start', 'serial', 'final', 'moments', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'YOU', ""'VE"", 'NEVER', 'SEEN', 'AN', 'EPISODE', 'OF', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'none', 'above', 'will', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'man', 'timelord', 'actually', 'who', 'appearance', 'few', 'years', 'traveling', 'space', 'time', 'ship', 'looking', 'outside', 'London', 'police', 'call', 'box', 'accompanied', 'constantly', 'changing', 'cast', 'companions', 'battling', 'wide', 'array', 'menaces', 'alien', 'human', 'Still', 'episodes', 'embody', 'sort', 'humanity', 'kooky', 'continuity', 'show', 'one', 'look', 'tragic', 'ending', 'entire', 'series', 'times', 'out', 'even', 'timelords']",Doctor Who - Earthshock VHS
327032,A1RC7W0ZHJIJZW,6302665183,R. Sundquist,"[1, 1]","This serial comes very close to being excellent, and is by far one of the highlights of the Fifth Doctor's era. There's so much to like in this one: the tone is serious, and the direction is cinematic and very visual, uncommon for Eighties ""Who""; the design is terrific, with both the caves and the spaceship looking absolutely top-notch; the guest cast turn in good performances, and the Cybermen make a triumphant return after having gone MIA for almost ten years.There's a good deal of action, but it doesn't overwhelm the way the violence in later shows like WARRIORS OF THE DEEP or RESURRECTION OF THE DALEKS would. The overcrowded TARDIS is quite obvious: Nyssa spends a lot of time inside doing little, and Adric is bumped off at the end. Tegan, however, gets to change into a new costume, wield a gun, and shoot a Cyberman. She was always a favorite of mine, nevermind all the complaints she gets. The direction, as I mentioned above, is better than average, and the tension and mood are palpable.But then there are some not-so-good bits. First of all, writer Eric Saward decided he didn't like the emotionless Cybermen of old so he gave the Cyberleader more of a personality. That might make him a more engaging villain, but it also makes him generic. He could be anyone at all, and there's no reason whatsoever for the baddies to be Cybermen. That's disappointing when the story is as good as it is.Even worse is the role the Doctor plays in this. I quite like Peter Davison's Doctor, and I think he gets underestimated. His performance makes the Doctor a little more human and humane, someone we can believe in. The trouble is, so few writers were willing to give him anything to do. He's like a bystander, an observer in his own show. Take the Doctor out of EARTHSHOCK, and you'd get basically the same thing. This was a major flaw of the series in the Eighties, and would only be corrected when Andrew Cartmel became story editor and started making the 7th Doctor into a good character again. Peter Davison is great, but the Doctor needs to take charge!Other than those two caveats, this is a great one. Of all the Fifth Doctor's stories, it's among the best.",4,"So close, but not quite!",1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,2172,"['serial', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'excellent', 'far', 'one', 'highlights', 'Fifth', 'Doctor', 'era', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'one', 'tone', 'serious', 'direction', 'cinematic', 'very', 'visual', 'uncommon', 'Eighties', 'Who', 'design', 'terrific', 'caves', 'spaceship', 'looking', 'absolutely', 'top-notch', 'guest', 'cast', 'turn', 'good', 'performances', 'Cybermen', 'make', 'triumphant', 'return', 'having', 'gone', 'MIA', 'almost', 'ten', 'good', 'deal', 'action', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'way', 'violence', 'later', 'shows', 'WARRIORS', 'THE', 'DEEP', 'RESURRECTION', 'THE', 'DALEKS', 'would', 'overcrowded', 'TARDIS', 'quite', 'obvious', 'Nyssa', 'lot', 'time', 'doing', 'little', 'Adric', 'bumped', 'off', 'end', 'Tegan', 'however', 'change', 'new', 'costume', 'wield', 'gun', 'Cyberman', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'mine', 'complaints', 'direction', 'mentioned', 'better', 'average', 'tension', 'mood', 'are', 'palpable.But', 'then', 'are', 'not-so-good', 'bits', 'First', 'writer', 'Eric', 'Saward', 'decided', 'did', ""n't"", 'emotionless', 'Cybermen', 'old', 'gave', 'Cyberleader', 'more', 'personality', 'might', 'make', 'more', 'engaging', 'villain', 'also', 'generic', 'could', 'be', 'anyone', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'baddies', 'be', 'Cybermen', 'disappointing', 'when', 'story', 'as', 'good', 'is.Even', 'worse', 'role', 'Doctor', 'quite', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'Doctor', 'think', 'underestimated', 'performance', 'Doctor', 'little', 'more', 'human', 'humane', 'someone', 'can', 'believe', 'trouble', 'so', 'few', 'writers', 'were', 'willing', 'give', 'anything', 'do', 'bystander', 'observer', 'own', 'show', 'Take', 'Doctor', 'EARTHSHOCK', ""'d"", 'get', 'basically', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'major', 'flaw', 'series', 'Eighties', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'corrected', 'when', 'Andrew', 'Cartmel', 'became', 'story', 'editor', 'started', 'making', '7th', 'Doctor', 'good', 'character', 'again', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'great', 'Doctor', 'take', 'charge', 'Other', 'two', 'caveats', 'great', 'one', 'Fifth', 'Doctor', 'stories', 'best']",Doctor Who - Earthshock VHS
327033,AEXGGB9P0MOTN,6302665183,"Sarah Hadley ""I'm a graduate student and Engl...","[4, 7]","I'm a big fan of the Cybermen. They're easily my favorite monsters, terrifying the screen in '60s &quot;Who&quot; episodes such as &quot;Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Moonbase&quot;. Their return afer seven years in &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; disappointed a lot of fans, but for some reason, their release from another seven-year hiatus in &quot;Earthshock&quot; was very well-received. Personally, I don't understand it.&quot;Earthshock&quot; is, first and foremost, an action movie. Few scenes go by without a gun fight, or an attack, or the expendble soldiers being shot down by the enemy. It's very formulaic, and worse still, a formulaic homage: some dialogue exchanges are very reminiscent of past Cybermen stories, like &quot;The Moonbase&quot; or &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;, and the 'hatching' and subsequent march in episode two are a combined copy of &quot;Tomb&quot; and &quot;The Invasion&quot;. If you think that's disappointing, it's even sadder to realise that Eric Saward later copied those same cliches and attempts at homage in two more stories, &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;.This is not to say there aren't great elements or classic scenes that are also original. Peter Davison is completely on form, and the redesign of the Cybermen is very, very cool. The scene where they are first revealed was undoubtedly quite surprising to the original, uninformed audience, and the climax and final credits still bring a feeling of sadness. But these only make &quot;Earthshock&quot; an okay story, a decently good one - not a classic.",3,The return of the Cybermen - but is it really that great?,1009411200,"12 27, 2001",2001,1617,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Cybermen', ""'re"", 'easily', 'favorite', 'monsters', 'terrifying', 'screen', ""'60s"", 'quot', 'Who', 'quot', 'episodes', 'such', 'quot', 'Tomb', 'Cybermen', 'quot', 'quot', 'Moonbase', 'quot', 'return', 'seven', 'years', 'quot', 'Revenge', 'Cybermen', 'quot', 'disappointed', 'lot', 'fans', 'reason', 'release', 'seven-year', 'hiatus', 'quot', 'Earthshock', 'quot', 'was', 'very', 'well-received', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'it.', 'quot', 'Earthshock', 'quot', 'first', 'foremost', 'action', 'movie', 'Few', 'scenes', 'go', 'gun', 'fight', 'attack', 'expendble', 'soldiers', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'enemy', 'very', 'formulaic', 'worse', 'still', 'formulaic', 'homage', 'dialogue', 'exchanges', 'are', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'past', 'Cybermen', 'stories', 'quot', 'Moonbase', 'quot', 'quot', 'Wheel', 'Space', 'quot', ""'hatching"", 'subsequent', 'march', 'episode', 'two', 'are', 'combined', 'copy', 'quot', 'Tomb', 'quot', 'quot', 'Invasion', 'quot', 'think', 'disappointing', 'even', 'sadder', 'realise', 'Eric', 'Saward', 'later', 'copied', 'same', 'cliches', 'attempts', 'homage', 'two', 'more', 'stories', 'quot', 'Resurrection', 'Daleks', 'quot', 'quot', 'Attack', 'Cybermen', 'quot', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'elements', 'classic', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'original', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'completely', 'form', 'redesign', 'Cybermen', 'very', 'very', 'cool', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'first', 'revealed', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'quite', 'surprising', 'original', 'uninformed', 'audience', 'climax', 'final', 'credits', 'still', 'bring', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'only', 'make', 'quot', 'Earthshock', 'quot', 'okay', 'story', 'decently', 'good', 'one', 'not', 'classic']",Doctor Who - Earthshock VHS
327034,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,6302665183,Twiddles42,"[18, 23]","Episode 1 alone is overall terrific.  Mysterious caves being guarded for some important reason, Adric bickering, the androids' way of killing people, this is a very taut and exciting episode.  There is some rubbish technobabble about the device used to track the people in the caves, but otherwise this episode hangs together extremely well.  As for the cliffhanger, it was a jaw-dropper in 1982 and still holds up exceptionally well.Episode 2 isn't quite as tense, but still easily manages to retain excitement and interest despite a silly claim about the TARDIS' capabilities and how the main enemies in this story can see into the future where they go over the Doctor's bio/history record.  But that is a small point.  The moment leading to the cliffhanger is reasonably excellent as well.Episode 3 is now a full shift away from the wonderful claustrophobia of the caves of the first 1.5 episodes.  The freighter's interior is extremely well realized considering the show's budget (or even on a big movie budget, they got everything RIGHT) and provides some great tension for more than one gripping scene.  The cliffhanger, despite using a prismatic lens to make one row of enemies look like 3 rows, packs a decent punch as well.  I won't mention how kewl it was to see how the Doctor deals with the enemy force about to break into the freighter's bridge...  So far, the story is worth all of the praise it gets.Episode 4 is awesome, though the ending is flaky.  The ending involves the freighter entering time travel, which seems to be cheaply written in as an afterthought.  The reasons behind the ability of the freighter to do this don't cut it and they could have used some flimsy technobabble about the warp engines being the cause instead of the enemy machinery locking the ship's directional control panel.  But that's one small point.Episode 4 does end with another big surprise that you, depending on your point of view, will like...The story was augmented with modern computer effects.  I prefer the original effects, even if they are different than what was intended to be (for example, a spaceship exploding instead of crashing, though it can be said the spaceship exploded in the planet's atmosphere...).I expect that the video and audio quality will be comparable to the other Dr Who releases (except ""The Key to Time"", which the UK Restoration Team did not work on).  I gather the soundtrack is isolated, which is another BIG plus.One of my big problems with 80s Dr Who is not as much JNT but Saward.  Even from his earliest penned story ""The Visitation"", Saward loves using gore.  Indeed, in ""The Visitation"" he wanted to have the remains of the smouldering murdered family to be shown, but the director had enough guts to show well orchestrated fade-in clips of the empty house's interior that was far more effective... Fortunately, we're still in the 5th Doctor's early run so it's not so pronounced (by Davison's final year, Saward - both as writer and script editor - went out his way to ensure pointless gore was used.  But that's another story...)  The only real gore in this episode is how the androids kill people (the people turn into a liquified state which is horrific yet doesn't go out of its way to be shock value.  In other words, it's appropriate and maturely handled and properly tells us that the androids doing the killing shouldn't be reckoned with...  (in later years (Davison's final year and to an extent Colin Baker's first year), the gore was haphazardly thrown in, with any true atmosphere chucked out the window in name of sleazy shock value.  Colin's era did match gore with a coherent intent, but the purpose seemed to be excessive, resulting in the gore being just as pointless as in the prior season...)But I digress.  This is a WONDERFUL story, worthy of 5 stars and is ideal for showing to any potential fan.  Also, the enemy I spoke of is the Cybermen.  They were created in 1966 and had been disused since 1974.  As the story was made 7 years later, it was deemed that they should be re-introduced with as little fanfare as possible.  And it worked.  and it worked so well that subsequent viewings don't wear the concept down.  For a producer maligned with the stigma that he loved using continuity, the continuity works well in this story as it reminds of previous Cybermen history to whet our appetites (later stories merely use continuity to bury storylines, but Earthshock tells a story and uses references in a way that expands one's interest to become a fan, and doesn't pander to fans (who'd only nitpick any inaccuracies in continuity).The Cybermen were organic creatures who replaced more of their limbs and organs with technology.  They're like the Borg, only they'd been around long before the Borg were.  And ""Earthshock"" is possibly the best story they're used in, apart from ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"".  (""Tomb""'s plot is superlative but I don't think it was carried out well, apart from episodes 1 and 4.  There are some great performances, but the technobabble is grating, episode 3 is pure pointless padding, and the inclusion of Toberman as an indentured servant of all things is boggling, why couldn't he be an equal?  On the other hand, his contributions to the end of that story prove he is the most human of them all...  and as ""Tomb"" had also been released on DVD, it's worthy of pick-up as well.)",5,"CLASSIC!
