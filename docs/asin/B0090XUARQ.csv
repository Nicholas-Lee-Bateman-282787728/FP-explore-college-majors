Servants now had some recourse when conditions were bad and as the pool of available domestic help shrunk to meet war production the servant class would have ever more power and would ultimately disappear forever. Other minorities were less silent and hidden as well, in the case of this episode, lesbians, or the brilliant use of the old-fashioned term, inverts. Women also had a little more power over their bodies, though as we see, not yet enough to be safe.Social conservatives will hate this episode with its themes of lesbian love, abortion and upward social mobility, but Upstairs Downstairs handles all of these in interesting plot lines and in ways that are true to the times. The love story is affecting and well done. Also emotionally affecting is the plight of the Jewish refugees and the way that both government and individuals moved to cope with it.

The trouble with season two is that the writers tried to pack in everything scandalous they could think of, making the whole season one giant soap opera. The character of Hallam starts out an honorable family man, but suddenly and with no real explanation, takes a sharp turn the opposite direction. Meanwhile another character, Persephone, pulls off her dislikable role a little too well, making you want to turn off the TV. The closest thing to a non-hatable character is Lady Agnes, but even she frequently flip-flops between being a fair and caring woman and a spoiled snob.

1582410,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0090XUARQ,Byron Kolln,"[78, 81]","In this second set of episodes from the BBC's revamped UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS, the dark clouds of war once again start to gather over 165 Eaton Place.The year is now 1938.  Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes) has given birth to her second child, but mother and baby barely survived the ordeal.  Weak and fragile, Agnes returns to Eaton Place where she is taken under-wing by Dr Blanche Mottershead (Alex Kingston), Sir Hallam's aunt and the half-sister of the late Maud.  Following the death of Maud, Blanche has decided to remain in Belgravia indefinitely, and despite initial hostility from Hallam and the servants, she soon finds much to occupy her time - most importantly a ""Kindertransport"", with the assistance of Mr Amanjit (Art Malik).Sir Hallam (Ed Stoppard) also finds himself increasingly called away from his responsibilities at Eaton Place.  The Foreign Office is abuzz with rumours surrounding Hitler and his threats of war.  During a trip to Germany to smooth over relations with the Third Reich, he meets by chance his sister-in-law Lady Persephone (Claire Foy), now the kept mistress of a top-ranking Nazi official.  To his disappointment, Persie is as stubborn and wilful as ever before and refuses to return to England with Hallam - until the Hollands receive a frantic late-night phonecall from Germany - a terrified Persie is ringing from a phonebox whilst Kristallnacht explodes around her.Downstairs, things are being kept up to standard by the ever-exacting butler Mr Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough), in the absence of Rose (Jean Marsh), who is recovering from an attack of tuberculosis.  New nursery maid Beryl Ballard (Laura Haddock) has ambitions to create a better life and refuses to let a flirtation with chauffeur Spargo (Neil Jackson) derail her goals.As the prospect of all-out war becomes a question of ""when"" rather than ""if"", the familiar household patterns start falling apart - Hallam becomes distanced from Lady Agnes, not only because of his war duties but also through Agnes' new friendship with visiting American millionaire Caspar Landry (Michael Landes).  Ever the loose cannon, Persie continues her irresponsible flirtation with Germany; and during the annual summer Servant's Ball at the Royal Albert Hall, the inhabitants of 165 reach a shattering point of no return...This will sadly be the final series of the BBC's UPSTAIRS DOWNTSTAIRS revival, with the network cancelling the program altogether following disappointing ratings.  I am quite upset about this, firstly because I am such a fan (both of the classic series and this splendid sequel), but most importantly because the way things are left at the end of Series 2, there is no satisfactory conclusion given to the characters and their stories.  If Heidi Thomas and the production team were given some prior warning that the BBC was going to pull the plug, I'm sure the final episode wouldn't have ended on such an uncertain note.  It's like ""The House of Eliott"" all over again!A lot of unfortunate setbacks happened in real life shortly before filming started on Series 2 of the new UP/DOWN.  Jean Marsh suffered a stroke but still agreed to participate, appearing in two brief scenes (Rose's absence sadly takes away a lot of the authentic UP/DOWN flavour - although Ms Marsh's personal well-being must take priority).  Dame Eileen Atkins decided not to continue with the show, reportedly because she had problems with the direction that writers wanted to take her character - hence why Maud had to be killed off before Series 2 starts.

I found it difficult in the series' infancy to like most of the characters and this follow-up doesn't change that, although it does a fine job of begging compassion now and again.

1582475,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0090XUARQ,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[15, 15]","The new 2012 UP/Down series two finally. Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s and continues in 2 the new episodes, more like a cameo. Beware of confusion, the only difference between the old title and the new is the current series is missing the comma. 6 episodes advance the story in season 2. Much of the cast returns including Marsh, but not Eileen Atkins. You get the same house and music as the 1970s epic blockbuster and seasons of the modern continuation. Yet it progresses as a costume period drama, and in my opinion at the entertainment level of the standards set in the 1970s.No disappointment from me or my wife with 2010's 3 episodes or this season's additional 6. The current cast is believable, compelling stories and character delight. Rose and the house gives old fans past memories, even though the interior was redecorated to 1930's. I fell in love with the new upstairs and downstairs families of 165, just like I do with watching the old series. Both excellent casts.This series begins on the eve of WWII, 1938 a year ahead, but it's evident that war is certain. There is drama galore in the every day affairs, and I do mean affairs, of those society's family, as well as their house staff.This set includes huge stars making their own world-wide fame Upstairs and Downstairs. Of course Marsh. Maude (Dame Atkins) has died, sad not to see her return, but the cast is still excellent, and Atkins was never in any of the 1970s series.  Keeley Hawes, great as the Lady Agnes; Ed Stoppard as Sir Hallam, Neil Jackson, Claire Foy, Anne Reid (marvelous as the cook), Adrian Scarborough, Art Malik, & Blake Ritson each return in every episode  Alex Kingston is new to UD and in 5 episodes while Laura Haddock and Amy Metcalf newly appear in all 2012 episodes. Kingston and Haddock provide stellar performances upping the already fine level of acting on this series. Humor at time, mystery or suspense at others, romance, drama of course, & always entertaining. It's a keeper--proving to be as good as the original.SUBTITLES provided for all 6 2012 episodes.1 A Faraway Country About Which We Know Nothing.....Maude died & Blanche (Kingston) moves into 165 Eaton Place. War seems certain & EP does it's part to prepare. Disagreement over white feathers (CO).2 The Love That Pays the Price.....Agnes & Hallam entertain the Kennedy's. Cook resigns for a spell. Amanjit (Malik) and Blanche help rescue Jew kids while Persie (Foy) sees Jew brutality in Germany.3 A Perfect Specimen of Womanhood.....Blanche aghast when author publishes account of lesbian affair. Hallam appalled, staff divided, Portia desires a reunion, & there's an abortion.4 All the Things You Are.....Agnes models for Landry (Michael Landes) Stocking factory ads. 165EP gets represented in local boxing event, not the only testosterone fight looming.5 The Last Waltz.....War strained marriage sends Agnes to the country. Persie's affairs touch more than one at Eaton Pl. Toss in one more downstairs affair.6 Somewhere Over the Rainbow.....Spy Persie? Alcoholic Butler? Repentant Hallam? rose's end? War just days away?

I will admit to not knowing, chapter and verse, how a household in England and the people &#34;in service&#34; therein, were run on a day-to-day basis. But I'm pretty sure it was nothing like the sweetness and light offered up here. I have noticed several &#34;BBC America&#34; produced shows that seem to think we Americans will pretty much swallow anything shipped over here, as long as the accents are in place and there is at least one kindly, elder character with twinkly eyes and a remedy for anything that may happen. Did the Lords and M'Ladies really take this much of an interest in the lives and well-being of their staff? I doubt it. There are too many contrived and just plain unlikely plots with pat solutions, that seemed to fall out of the sky and now we're all smiling and happy.

This season brings forth multiple changes in the relationships in the family, the threat of WW II and issues within the staff of the home.Tremendous pressures are being put onto Hallam's shoulders with the threat of war and his efforts to prepare the British government and help to try to prevent the war.  Those pressures are affecting his family, his job and his well-being.I won't go into the season's details any more as many reviewers have already posted too many spoilers.  Let's just say that the story line is gripping and interesting and you will gain a lot of insights into prewar England and the life of the aristocrats in the government.  The details about the lives of the servants are also a major part of the story and their life is vastly different than that of their wealthy bosses.I really like this series and I am becoming addicted to British television drama.  At the present time the shows offered by the BBC are so much better than what is available from the American TV channels.

Lady Percy got on my nerves but I suppose she was meant to and why did Hallum have to have an affair with her...it made him look really stupid.

1582513,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0090XUARQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","A fervent admirer of the original ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" I was more than a little intrigued when an updated series rolled out in 2010.  With the original being a true piece of television history for five seasons (1971-75) of groundbreaking drama, the modernization certainly had a lot to live up to. So I was very surprised that Season One only had three episodes and that it was actually a sequel of sorts as opposed to a re-imagining. Well, the truth of the matter is that these episodes definitely lacked the bite and complexity of the preceding series. But with such a limited running time, I suppose that was to be expected. However, the resultant product (while perhaps not the stuff of TV legend) was a fitfully entertaining confection in its own right.  This likable introduction received six Emmy nominations and set the stage for further and more in-depth adventures.  Season Two is back with twice as many episodes (a whopping six) and this extra times gives each member of the ensemble cast a greater chance to shine.While Season One dealt largely with the reopening and rebuilding of 165 Eaton Place, Season Two sees its inhabitants adjusting while the world is on the precipice of war.  The Hollands (Ed Stoppard and Keeley Hawes) are up to their necks in international intrigue, both on the home front and abroad.  While conflict seems inevitable and certain preparations are being readied, you never feel that these two fully realize the horrific implications just around the corner.  Hawe's spirited (or should I say trouble-making) sister Persie (Claire Foy) even finds herself in need of rescuing and Stoppard plays the hero in hostile territory.  Alex Kingston joins the proceedings in the upstairs cast as a forceful new aunt Blanche with a secret that may bring scandal to the family.  As tensions escalate within the country, the family dynamics are also strained beyond all reason as the episodes progress and (surprise, surprise) Persie seems to be at the heart of matters that threaten to take everyone down.The downstairs cast also features a strong new member in the new nursery maid (Laura Haddock).  She brings a strong new energy to the proceedings and challenges the entrenched system of service almost from the moment she's in the door.  Like a breath of fresh air, she represents a modernization that can alternately be infuriating and revelatory to those around her.  Anne Reid, Adrian Scarborough, Neil Jackson, Nico Mirallegro all return as well and have a lot more to do in this extended season.  Scarborough as the fussy Pritchard and Reid as the feisty Mrs Thackery are a particularly effective match as they battle (mostly in a lighthearted way) for the upper hand in the house.  But that's the thing with this ""Upstairs, Downstairs.""  It always feels so sprightly, even as situations are growing more dire.  Bonus points, though, for one of the most offbeat comedy sequences of the year.  The pesky monkey from Season One is back and one episode, in particular, deals with him and made me laugh out loud at several moments.Remember, though, this is not meant to be a dark historical treatment.  The unpleasant backdrop is really secondary to the antics of the cast. It is entertaining soap opera mayhem set against the backdrop of history.  Glossy, well produced, and well acted--this version may be slightly superficial, but it sure is likable enough.  But now for the bad news, and I was devastated.  Two prominent Season One cast members (and coincidentally the two Emmy nominees) have been sidelined or eliminated altogether.  The original series' creator Jean Marsh (Rose) returned to the role she played in the seventies in a highly touted move, but she is seen only fleetingly within Season Two.  More detrimental is the vacancy left by Eileen Atkins (meant to be filled by Kingston as her sister).  As Stoppard's mother (and foil for Hawes), the indomitable Atkins stole every scene and my heart in Season One and her absence is glaring!  Still, this is a nice continuation and the character growth is appreciated.  Before I go, one more shout-out to the original series.  If you haven't checked it out, please do so.

But oh my sainted aunt; oh my paws and whiskers! What DID they do with Season Two? The characters are simply unrecongizable and the narrative goes from realistically uplifting to quite unbelievable trash.Hallum changes, with no warning, from a noble person with brilliant international insights to an idiot so enslaved to his nether regions that he sleeps with his sister-in-law and allows her to extract information for the Nazis, toward whom she is still sympathetic; Percy goes from being an understandably confused and spoiled adolescent to practically a psychopath. When it finally looks like Pritchard, that kind man, finds love, it is ripped away and he descends into alcoholism; the driver, who had rejected his Nazi leanings, now becomes a blackmailer and potential deserter; Beryl, who had begun to respect her mistress for her better understanding of the servants' situation, turns spiteful. And Eileen Atkins, alas, is put on the shelf (literally) and replaced by her sister--a very sensible, endearing, and wise woman, who, it is clearly implied, has romantic preferences for her own gender (stereotypically very male clothing, etc). Hardly unusual, but here it has to be drawn out and detailed explicitly with a lost lover and a bedroom scene or two. With all this, throw in a botched abortion, equally detailed, and the series becomes, as Lady Agnes puts is so succinctly in the end, ""a sordid affair."" Not that these issues should have been ignored, but it seems a great deal of valuable narrative time was was wasted on drawing them out melodramatically as a suddenly major focus--while viewers, I suspect, were wondering how the children refugees were doing, the step-daughter at school, etc., all of which were just dropped.Johnny, the likable footman lad, and the sweet housemaid with glasses, seem to be the only two who stay their kind and believeable selves (though Johnny is listed as 1-A for conscription, so of course such a good-hearted and outdated character will be killed in the war), along with Hallum's disabled sister, who makes a couple of charming appearances. At least the Indian manservant and the cook stay sensibly level-headed, while everyone else devolves into raving bonkers and you wonder if they will all be carted off to Bedlam Hospital. Agnes, in the end, decides, unselfishly, for the sake of the children and her household, to stay with her husband; but her love for Hallum, now esquery for the Duke of Kent after resigning his position at Whitehall, is extinquished.The last scene, with guns, attempted murder, and suicide--all neatly swept up by the returning Pritchard with an amazing lack of emotion for what has just happened--approaches farce; and is such a sad contrast to the first scene in the series, where the children's refugee home is established. The very fact that a viewer can actually sit through this second series until the end is due entirely to the truly brilliant actors, who had very little material to work with. It is almost as if the scriptwriters were taking their revenge for the series not being continued. Poor Jean Marsh; they really ruined her revival in Series Two. We wish her the very best in her recovery from her stroke, but I doubt the second series will help.
