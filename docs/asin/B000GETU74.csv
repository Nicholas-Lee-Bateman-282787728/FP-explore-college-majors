1002608,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000GETU74,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[3, 3]","Richie is an LA con artist. A bad one, apparently, since he has a thug pursuing him and the 10 grand debt. Luck smiles, as he is notified he is the last surviving relative of his rich Grandmother. But she's old and needs a caregiver, and lives in Harmony, TX, pop. 1208. Frank Whaley is superb & believable as grandson, changing from crude and uncaring to tender.Granny `Clyde' is even more impressively played by Marion Ross (""Happy Day's"" mom) and proves she has a bit more on the ball than grandson Richie anticipates. You'll laugh, you'll cry, with this character. His plan to get her money quickly falters. Gran gets a new lease on life after eye surgery clears vision and she has a suitor. Her date is played by Paul Michael, real-life sweetheart of Marion Ross.You'll find the ending not as predictable as you might guess.This is an honest yet touching portrayal of senior life style, its joys and difficulties. The story is funny, touching, romantic, and portrays change in people as well second chance opportunities. It is a typical Hallmark with some cast members deserving ""guest star"" status such as Keith Carradine playing the sheriff, Peter Michael Goetz (""Cavanaughs"") undertaker, and even Mary Beth McDonough (""The Waltons"" Erin) an eye surgeon.Expect memories of your own past with a Grandmother to be recalled after watching this excellent family film. It is priced at only $3.97...WOW. At that price, use it for a stocking stuffer, or in place of sending a greeting card to a friend needing a pick-me-up note.I found mine on a Hallmark Collector's Set V.3 for a little more and it comes with 3 other Hallmark Entertainment stories. A great value.
