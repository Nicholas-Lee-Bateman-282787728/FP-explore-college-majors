435720,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,630478578X,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 2]","This 1986 KARL LORIMAR videotape is recorded in SP mode, has HiFi sound and a sharp, full screen picture.Arthur Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning DEATH OF A SALESMAN played 742 times between 2/10/49 and 11/18/50. Its third and fourth Broadway revivals, both during 1984, was seen by 185 audiences. Of the subsequent TV cast, only Charles Durning and Anne McIntosh did not appear on stage.SYNOPSIS--Lately, traveling salesman Willie Loman hasn't been able to close deals like he once did. This naturally troubles Willie and may be the reason his mind is playing tricks on him. Willie often retreats into the past and relives -out loud- events long gone, including the day teenaged Biff came to Boston unannounced and caught him with his mistress.Ever since that surprise visit, Biff's done nothing with his life and now his suicidal dad has just lost his job after 32 years of loyal service and hard miles. Thirty-four-year-old Biff is back home after years away and the old resentments and arguments pick up almost where they left off. His dramatic confrontation with Willie just before this story ends is heart-rending.Hoffman and Malkovich are awesome as father and son, especially in that highly emotional climactic scene. They play off each other so well that what we see on screen at that moment ARE Willie and Biff Loman. It's theater art of the highest kind.RELATED ITEM:The original Willie Loman, Lee J.

435721,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,630478578X,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[1, 1]","Dustin Hoffman, John Malkovich shine in this now classic play. Like Nora in Ibsen's ""A Doll's House,"" we have characters confined by prescribed fate looking to climb out into their own.What is fate?In this case, Willy Loman is bound by his belief that personality alone, of being liked, is enough to make it to the American Dream. Unable to reconcile that those days never existed, and that hard work involved more than a firm handshake and a smile, he becomes despondent as he thinks of the lost potential. He is reminded in flashbacks and visions of relatives and friends who have succeeded.His two sons are also confined to Willy's delusions of grandeur. Biff, played by Malkovich, had a future as a football star, but was handicapped by his dad's inhibitions and lack of reality. When he realizes his dad is a failure without integrity, after idolizing him, he concludes he too will be a failure.Hap, on the other hand, Bif's brother, played by Stephen Lang, is a young Willy. He thinks his dad is right, and although he lives in futile mediocrity, believes dreaming is enough.Kate Reid plays Willy's wife, Linda. She knows Willy is a failure, but tries to exist within the lie. She never declares the truth, but instead allows Willy to dream without substance.Willy's hopes are shown worthless when he meets up with those, like Bernard, the nerdy math geek when Bif and Hap were children, and now practicing law in front of the Supreme Court. Willy asks what the secret is. His dream is nothing but the puff of a distortion of a Horatio Alger story, but he won't accept it. Bernard's father, Willy's neighbor, offers him a job, but Willy refuses.The conflict is about encountering reality, and who will meet the truth. Can Biff live his simple dream of working outside with his hands, but by doing so must destroy the family structure. He knows it, and so he struggles.Willy Loman's failure is like the hope of an old spiritual show follower, looking for salvation, but not willing to commit to what gets paired with it. It is a search for meaning. Despite a pessimistic premise, there is hope resident in this amazing film.I fully recommend ""Death of a Salesman.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",5,Hopeful Movie Despite a Pessimistic Premise,1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,2213,"['Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'shine', 'now', 'classic', 'play', 'Nora', 'Ibsen', 'A', 'Doll', 'House', 'have', 'characters', 'confined', 'prescribed', 'fate', 'looking', 'climb', 'out', 'own.What', 'fate', 'case', 'Willy', 'Loman', 'bound', 'belief', 'personality', 'alone', 'being', 'liked', 'enough', 'make', 'American', 'Dream', 'Unable', 'reconcile', 'days', 'never', 'existed', 'hard', 'work', 'involved', 'more', 'firm', 'handshake', 'smile', 'despondent', 'lost', 'potential', 'reminded', 'flashbacks', 'visions', 'relatives', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'succeeded.His', 'two', 'sons', 'are', 'also', 'confined', 'Willy', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'Biff', 'played', 'Malkovich', 'had', 'future', 'football', 'star', 'was', 'handicapped', 'dad', 'inhibitions', 'lack', 'reality', 'When', 'dad', 'failure', 'integrity', 'idolizing', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'failure.Hap', 'other', 'hand', 'Bif', 'brother', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'young', 'Willy', 'dad', 'right', 'futile', 'mediocrity', 'dreaming', 'enough.Kate', 'Reid', 'Willy', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Willy', 'failure', 'tries', 'exist', 'lie', 'never', 'truth', 'instead', 'Willy', 'dream', 'substance.Willy', 'hopes', 'are', 'shown', 'worthless', 'when', 'up', 'Bernard', 'nerdy', 'math', 'geek', 'when', 'Bif', 'Hap', 'were', 'children', 'now', 'practicing', 'law', 'front', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Willy', 'what', 'secret', 'dream', 'nothing', 'puff', 'distortion', 'Horatio', 'Alger', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'accept', 'Bernard', 'father', 'Willy', 'neighbor', 'job', 'Willy', 'refuses.The', 'conflict', 'encountering', 'reality', 'who', 'will', 'meet', 'truth', 'Can', 'Biff', 'live', 'simple', 'dream', 'working', 'outside', 'hands', 'doing', 'so', 'must', 'destroy', 'family', 'structure', 'so', 'struggles.Willy', 'Loman', 'failure', 'hope', 'old', 'spiritual', 'show', 'follower', 'looking', 'salvation', 'not', 'willing', 'commit', 'what', 'paired', 'search', 'meaning', 'pessimistic', 'premise', 'hope', 'resident', 'amazing', 'film.I', 'fully', 'recommend', 'Death', 'Salesman', 'Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",Death of a Salesman & Private Conversations VHS
435722,A3DD96LN8U1NM,630478578X,citygal,"[1, 2]","I love Death of a Salesman, and I was fortunate enough to see Brian Dennehy as Willy Loman in the Broadway version. Nothing has ever topped that performance since. Yet, even without that stellar performance to compare it with, I still would have been disappointed with Dustin Hoffman cast as Willy Loman in this movie version. Really, it annoys me that they cast Hoffman in that role when he clearly doesn't even look the part.  Hoffman would have been better cast as Charlie, but because he's a big star, I suppose he had to have the leading role.  They even changed some of the dialogue to suit Hoffman. For example, at one point in the actual play, Willy is telling his wife about an incident where he overheard some people making fun of him. The line mentions something about the people calling him a walrus. This fits Dennehy because he's such a big man (I'm not calling him a walrus, but he's big and tall). However, they knew how ridiculous that would seem coming from Hoffman, so they changed the lines so that Willy tells his wife that he overheard some people calling him a shrimp.However, John Malkovitch is superb as Biff, so it may be worth watching for his performance alone.",3,Wrong Casting Choice for Willy,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,1189,"['love', 'Death', 'Salesman', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Willy', 'Loman', 'Broadway', 'version', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'topped', 'performance', 'even', 'stellar', 'performance', 'compare', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'cast', 'Willy', 'Loman', 'movie', 'version', 'Really', 'cast', 'Hoffman', 'role', 'when', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'part', 'Hoffman', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'cast', 'Charlie', 'big', 'star', 'suppose', 'had', 'have', 'leading', 'role', 'even', 'changed', 'dialogue', 'suit', 'Hoffman', 'example', 'one', 'point', 'actual', 'play', 'Willy', 'telling', 'wife', 'incident', 'where', 'people', 'making', 'fun', 'line', 'mentions', 'something', 'people', 'calling', 'walrus', 'Dennehy', 'big', 'man', ""'m"", 'not', 'calling', 'walrus', 'big', 'tall', 'However', 'knew', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'would', 'seem', 'coming', 'Hoffman', 'changed', 'lines', 'Willy', 'wife', 'people', 'calling', 'shrimp.However', 'John', 'Malkovitch', 'superb', 'Biff', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'performance', 'alone']",Death of a Salesman & Private Conversations VHS

435725,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,630478578X,Linda Linguvic,"[9, 10]","This 1985 version was actually a TV movie using most of the original cast from the 1984 version of the Broadway play first written by Arthur Miller in 1949.  Since then it has been performed many many times with a variety of different casts.  A million years ago I even remember studying it in college.  I have always wanted to see the play and was thrilled that I discovered this video.Dustin Hoffman stars as Willie Loman, a fading traveling salesman who has made all the wrong decisions in his life.  A young John Malkovich plays his son, Biff, a jobless loser.  Steven Lang, is cast as his other son, Happy; Linda Reid plays Willie Loman's wife; and Charles Durning plays his neighbor, Charlie.  All have been nominated for a variety of awards and Dustin Hoffman won a Golden Globe for best actor that year.There is no doubt that this is a play, not a movie by the way it is staged. Flashbacks are achieved, for example, by the character Biff, coming on stage in a High School sweater. The characters often seem to be speaking directly to the audience also.  I found all this refreshing after watching so many movies where computerized cinematography and special effects are everything.This play doesn't need special effects.  It is all in the words and the acting.  And what fine acting it is!  I forgot how good a play can be! Especially one by Arthur Miller.  The Director, Volker Shloendorff, made his American debut with this production, his prior experience being only in France and Germany.

I read other reviews saying things  like Hoffman provides an &quot;insect&quot;-like portrayal of Willy...  well, I think it's PERFECT!  The chemistry between all the actors in this  is incredible.
