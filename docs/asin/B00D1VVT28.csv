Is so good to be able to stop, back up and replay a scene or interaction between the players to get a little something extra out of it or pick up on something you might have missed in the original showing on the air.

Now I can watch them in order and enjoy them back-to-back. The only problem with watching them endlessly is that I'v discovered that, although I think Abbey is a great character, her childlike persona whenever Gibbs is around is pretty darn annoying.  I REALLY hate that Ziva left.

There were warnings on the packages about close captions being on some of the disks,  Season 2 had closed captions on some of the disks which would not turn off when I tried to clear them with my machines viewing options. They appear to have been recorded with the closed captions on and it made them unable to be cleared,  That was a little annoying but all the other seasons played well.
