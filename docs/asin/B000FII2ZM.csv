991033,AM18CU72YEWH5,B000FII2ZM,A. J Terry,"[33, 33]","On viewing Series 3, I was struck by how well the producers targeted all three series to the late 20th-century-middle-class-working-woman-viewer.  The House of Elliott is all about work problems:  Establishing a career with insufficient formal credentials, working in a man's world, finding out who you can trust in business, working with people you dislike who are nonetheless valuable contributors to the business, supervising people who dislike each other, being hit on by male coworkers and business associates, juggling your demanding career with the often conflicting demands of a husband's or boyfriend's, juggling motherhood and work, and dealing creatively with work emergencies.  In Series 3, lower-class working conditions, and socialism as a potential solution, are major new themes.There is also more emphasis on the demands of motherhood (Bea and Tilly have babies) and on previously minor characters, especially on the home lives of House of Elliott employees. The pace is frenetic compared to the first two series, with lots of multiple plot lines and quick shifts back and forth between them, unnecessarily dramatic camera angles, dropped situations, and overall too much going on.  All the characters make major life and in some cases personality shifts. Tilly becomes clinically depressed. Bea's new boyfriend Daniel rapidly evolves from an arrogant, callous, resentful, self-centered, exploitative jerk (he's even a gigolo) to a sensitive, caring guy who makes major sacrifices for Evie. Evie's rejected boyfriend Miles apparently turns from being a sweet, caring, sensitive, generous guy to a shark trying to take over the House of Elliott.  Is this really a science fiction series where their brains got swapped in the night?Every single one of the plots ends up as a cliffhanger.  Will Tilly and Norm become employed again? Will Agnes leave the House of Elliott to become a full-time music hall singer? Will Jack succeed in his new career as a socialist politician, and will Bea be able to cope with being a politician's wife? Will Donald be happy with all the sacrifices he has made for Bea?  Will Miles end up running the House of Elliott?  And many more . . . but most of all, will the new rift between Bea and Evie (who throughout this show have always been closer to each other than to any husband or boyfriend) ever heal?Stay tuned for Series 4:  Except, as far as I can tell, there wasn't one.  Nonetheless, fans of Series 1 and 2 will certainly want to watch Series 3.Oh, and the clothes are great.",4,For the Modern Woman,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,2529,"['viewing', 'Series', '3', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'well', 'producers', 'targeted', 'three', 'series', 'late', '20th-century-middle-class-working-woman-viewer', 'House', 'Elliott', 'work', 'problems', 'Establishing', 'career', 'insufficient', 'formal', 'credentials', 'working', 'man', 'world', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'can', 'trust', 'business', 'working', 'people', 'dislike', 'who', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'valuable', 'contributors', 'business', 'supervising', 'people', 'who', 'dislike', 'other', 'being', 'hit', 'male', 'coworkers', 'business', 'associates', 'juggling', 'demanding', 'career', 'often', 'conflicting', 'demands', 'husband', 'boyfriend', 'juggling', 'motherhood', 'work', 'dealing', 'creatively', 'work', 'emergencies', 'Series', '3', 'lower-class', 'working', 'conditions', 'socialism', 'potential', 'solution', 'are', 'major', 'new', 'also', 'more', 'emphasis', 'demands', 'motherhood', 'Bea', 'Tilly', 'have', 'babies', 'previously', 'minor', 'characters', 'especially', 'home', 'lives', 'House', 'Elliott', 'employees', 'pace', 'frenetic', 'compared', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'lots', 'multiple', 'plot', 'lines', 'quick', 'shifts', 'back', 'forth', 'unnecessarily', 'dramatic', 'camera', 'angles', 'dropped', 'situations', 'overall', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'characters', 'make', 'major', 'life', 'cases', 'personality', 'shifts', 'Tilly', 'clinically', 'depressed', 'Bea', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Daniel', 'rapidly', 'arrogant', 'callous', 'resentful', 'self-centered', 'exploitative', 'jerk', 'even', 'gigolo', 'sensitive', 'caring', 'guy', 'who', 'major', 'sacrifices', 'Evie', 'Evie', 'rejected', 'boyfriend', 'Miles', 'apparently', 'being', 'sweet', 'caring', 'sensitive', 'generous', 'guy', 'shark', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'House', 'Elliott', 'really', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'where', 'brains', 'got', 'swapped', 'night', 'single', 'one', 'plots', 'up', 'cliffhanger', 'Will', 'Tilly', 'Norm', 'become', 'employed', 'again', 'Will', 'Agnes', 'leave', 'House', 'Elliott', 'become', 'full-time', 'music', 'hall', 'singer', 'Will', 'Jack', 'succeed', 'new', 'career', 'socialist', 'politician', 'will', 'Bea', 'be', 'able', 'cope', 'being', 'politician', 'wife', 'Will', 'Donald', 'be', 'happy', 'sacrifices', 'made', 'Bea', 'Will', 'Miles', 'end', 'up', 'running', 'House', 'Elliott', 'many', 'more', 'most', 'will', 'new', 'rift', 'Bea', 'Evie', 'who', 'show', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'closer', 'other', 'husband', 'boyfriend', 'ever', 'heal', 'Stay', 'tuned', 'Series', '4', 'Except', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'Nonetheless', 'fans', 'Series', '1', '2', 'will', 'certainly', 'want', 'watch', 'Series', '3.Oh', 'clothes', 'are', 'great']",House of Eliott - Series Three

IT JUST STOPPED. It left you hanging as if they cancelled the series right in the middle of production and never wrapped it up. It was extremely disappointing to watch the whole thing becoming involved with all the characters and then finding out they didn't have anymore episodes and everyone was still in embroiled in some new and unfinished turmoil. It was very upsetting to say the least.,1,Where's the rest?,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,523,"['loved', 'series', 'what', 'guess', 'was', 'last', 'episode', 'just', 'ended', 'everything', 'up', 'air', 'was', 'conclusion', 'IT', 'JUST', 'STOPPED', 'left', 'hanging', 'cancelled', 'series', 'right', 'middle', 'production', 'never', 'wrapped', 'up', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'becoming', 'involved', 'characters', 'then', 'finding', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anymore', 'episodes', 'everyone', 'was', 'still', 'embroiled', 'new', 'unfinished', 'turmoil', 'was', 'very', 'upsetting', 'say', 'least']",House of Eliott - Series Three

991038,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B000FII2ZM,Serene Night,"[7, 8]","Series 3 continues the long tradition of House of Elliot- 2 sisters who struggle to set aside their differences and run a fashion house. In this season the big challenges are Bea's pregnancy, Evie's growing selfishness and relationship with her struggling artist boyfriend. Jack enters politics, and the family become embroiled in a scandal which threatens all of their careers.Personally, while I enjoyed season 3 I found the interludes with Jack and the labor party boring. I found myself tired of Jack's character, and his on-again-off-again relationship with Bea. Evie's bf starts off as being a jerk and grows on you by the end of the season. I actually liked Miles, the artist who Evie spurned, and honestly think he was a better fit for Evie.Overall, a fun exciting series, but some of the subplots got away with them I think. Also, since there is yet to be a season 4 I have no idea what will happen to characters such as Tillie, Jack, Bea and Miles.",4,"Good, but Jack dominates a bit much...",1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,958,"['Series', '3', 'long', 'tradition', 'House', 'Elliot-', '2', 'sisters', 'who', 'struggle', 'set', 'aside', 'differences', 'run', 'fashion', 'house', 'season', 'big', 'challenges', 'are', 'Bea', 'pregnancy', 'Evie', 'growing', 'selfishness', 'relationship', 'struggling', 'artist', 'boyfriend', 'Jack', 'enters', 'politics', 'family', 'become', 'embroiled', 'scandal', 'careers.Personally', 'enjoyed', 'season', '3', 'found', 'interludes', 'Jack', 'labor', 'party', 'boring', 'found', 'tired', 'Jack', 'character', 'on-again-off-again', 'relationship', 'Bea', 'Evie', 'bf', 'off', 'being', 'jerk', 'grows', 'end', 'season', 'actually', 'liked', 'Miles', 'artist', 'who', 'Evie', 'spurned', 'honestly', 'think', 'was', 'better', 'fit', 'Evie.Overall', 'fun', 'exciting', 'series', 'subplots', 'got', 'away', 'think', 'Also', 'yet', 'be', 'season', '4', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'characters', 'such', 'Tillie', 'Jack', 'Bea', 'Miles']",House of Eliott - Series Three
