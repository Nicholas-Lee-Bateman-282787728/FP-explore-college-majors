You are exposed to a difficult way of life with many hardships, which force you to have to make choices to survive which change the characters forever.  I decided this was a very worthwhile movie, after reading Roger Ebert's review.  The movie is true and based upon a book.  The acting was exceptional by the main characters.  You could feel Lei's pain and confusion in Viet Nam, and America.  Her expectations with her new husband, Tommy Lee' Jones, who I feel is always flawless, in his acting ability, was more shocking and disappointing,(to her) I think than usual, because she understandably expected so much.  She was also torn between Buddism and Christianity which was a huge factor in the movie.  The concepts of both religions are so opposite and she tried so hard to meet his expectations, which was impossible.  He sank into such a deep depression, he was beyond help and the consequences were tragic and heart moving.  The entire movie, gave you so much to think about and understand an entire different culture, if you are American.  I definitely have to watch this movie one or two more times as I only viewed it once and there is so much to absorb.  I never realized Viet Nam was such a beautiful country before all the wars.  I was totally ignorant of the history, which was overwhelming.  I think pain and helplessness was a part of the theme along with heartache and finally some sort of acceptance and peace.  She was a very strong, and determined woman.  She fought to find salvation.  This movie is a must see, and as I stated, I must watch it a couple more times.  Maybe, I should have reviewed later on.  I feel my  thought,  even after one viewing, will change one's understanding of war, loss,  culture ,terror, fear, love and acceptance.",5,War and personal peace,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,1867,"['was', 'exceptionally', 'beautiful', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie', 'shall', 'always', 'carry', 'are', 'exposed', 'difficult', 'way', 'life', 'many', 'hardships', 'force', 'have', 'make', 'choices', 'survive', 'change', 'characters', 'forever', 'decided', 'was', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'reading', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'movie', 'true', 'based', 'book', 'acting', 'was', 'exceptional', 'main', 'characters', 'could', 'feel', 'Lei', 'pain', 'confusion', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'America', 'expectations', 'new', 'husband', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'feel', 'always', 'flawless', 'acting', 'ability', 'was', 'more', 'shocking', 'disappointing', 'think', 'usual', 'understandably', 'expected', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'also', 'torn', 'Buddism', 'Christianity', 'was', 'huge', 'factor', 'movie', 'concepts', 'religions', 'are', 'so', 'opposite', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'meet', 'expectations', 'was', 'impossible', 'sank', 'such', 'deep', 'depression', 'was', 'help', 'consequences', 'were', 'tragic', 'heart', 'moving', 'entire', 'movie', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'understand', 'entire', 'different', 'culture', 'are', 'American', 'definitely', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'times', 'only', 'viewed', 'once', 'so', 'much', 'absorb', 'never', 'realized', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'was', 'such', 'beautiful', 'country', 'wars', 'was', 'totally', 'ignorant', 'history', 'was', 'overwhelming', 'think', 'pain', 'helplessness', 'was', 'part', 'theme', 'heartache', 'finally', 'sort', 'acceptance', 'peace', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'determined', 'woman', 'fought', 'find', 'salvation', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'stated', 'must', 'watch', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'reviewed', 'later', 'feel', 'thought', 'even', 'one', 'viewing', 'will', 'change', 'one', 'understanding', 'war', 'loss', 'culture', 'terror', 'fear', 'love', 'acceptance']",Heaven & Earth VHS

The second is &quot;Born on the  Fourth of July,&quot; the point-of-view of an American Marine who leaves  one war -- paralyzed -- and only gets home to find a completely different  war going on - the war with ourselves.The third, &quot;Heaven and  Earth,&quot; is a view of the war from the other side -- that of a  Vietnamese rice farmer family.The main character is Lyn Lee, an  innocent Vietnamese girl, who respects her parents, her country and her  religion. Her life as a simple rice-patty worker changes when THE Vietnam  war begins. First, the cruel SVA Army, aided by the American Army, rapes  the simple village, and all that the farmers have worked so hard for. Then,  they are also bullied by the Viet Cong when the anti-communist forces  aren't there...and her brothers join their ranks.From then on, her life  changes forever. She becomes a cheap peddler in the streets of Saigon, and  also a prostitute. Her life is in the pits, that is, until she meets a  United States Marine Gunnery Seargent, played by Tommy Lee Jones. He treats  her very well, almost making up for all the hardships she has dealt with  her whole life. The two finally fall in love, and he brings her back to  America.When she reaches the U.S., she is amazed at everything --  including the amount of food that is practically there for the taking -- if  you have a nice big fridge, which she finds commonplace in America.Her  problems aren't solved, however, because the Marine she fell in love with  (played wonderfully by the great Jones), suffers horribly from  post-traumatic stress syndrome.While this movie emotionally drains you,  and gets a little boring at times, you sit back in your chair in awe; first  at how great the story is, second, what this poor Vietnamese girl went  through, and third, you are amazed at how much this film makes you thankful  for everything you take for granted.....and when you are done watching this  flick, you walk away feeling, of course, a little depressed, but you walk  away feeling that you have gained something.An excellent -- yet  depressing -- close to Stone's Vietnam trilogy.Reccomended.",5,Shows the OTHER SIDE,918345600,"02 7, 1999",1999,2307,"['quot', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'quot', 'third', 'Stone', 'Vietnam', 'Trilogy', 'first', 'being', 'quot', 'Platoon', 'quot', 'was', 'Nam', 'American', 'Infantryman', 'frontline', 'point-of-view', 'second', 'quot', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'quot', 'point-of-view', 'American', 'Marine', 'who', 'one', 'war', 'paralyzed', 'only', 'home', 'find', 'completely', 'different', 'war', 'going', 'war', 'ourselves.The', 'third', 'quot', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'quot', 'view', 'war', 'other', 'side', 'Vietnamese', 'rice', 'farmer', 'family.The', 'main', 'character', 'Lyn', 'Lee', 'innocent', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'who', 'parents', 'country', 'religion', 'life', 'simple', 'rice-patty', 'worker', 'changes', 'when', 'THE', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'begins', 'First', 'cruel', 'SVA', 'Army', 'aided', 'American', 'Army', 'simple', 'village', 'farmers', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'Then', 'are', 'also', 'bullied', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'when', 'anti-communist', 'forces', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'brothers', 'join', 'ranks.From', 'then', 'life', 'changes', 'forever', 'cheap', 'peddler', 'streets', 'Saigon', 'also', 'prostitute', 'life', 'pits', 'United', 'States', 'Marine', 'Gunnery', 'Seargent', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'very', 'well', 'almost', 'making', 'up', 'hardships', 'dealt', 'whole', 'life', 'two', 'finally', 'fall', 'love', 'back', 'America.When', 'U.S.', 'amazed', 'everything', 'including', 'amount', 'food', 'practically', 'taking', 'have', 'nice', 'big', 'fridge', 'commonplace', 'America.Her', 'problems', 'are', ""n't"", 'solved', 'however', 'Marine', 'fell', 'love', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'great', 'Jones', 'suffers', 'horribly', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'syndrome.While', 'movie', 'emotionally', 'little', 'boring', 'times', 'sit', 'back', 'chair', 'awe', 'first', 'how', 'great', 'story', 'second', 'what', 'poor', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'went', 'third', 'are', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'thankful', 'everything', 'take', 'granted', '..and', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'watching', 'flick', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'course', 'little', 'depressed', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'have', 'gained', 'something.An', 'excellent', 'yet', 'depressing', 'close', 'Stone', 'Vietnam', 'trilogy.Reccomended']",Heaven & Earth VHS
356086,A179SF1EZBSET8,6303101224,Gault,"[2, 2]","I love most Oliver Stone films, though some of them I would never want to watch again because of how gritty they are. ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Platoon"" come to mind - spectacular films, but I got a good enough eyeful at my first viewings of them. ""Wall Street"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" I do not wish to view again either, but for entirely different reasons.Then we have ""Heaven & Earth,"" the magnificent, very distressing, sweeping saga of Ley Ly Hayslip, a Vietnamese national who experiences the French occupation of her country, the atrocity of the Vietnam War, the immigration to America, the vicarious ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome, and the unanticipated return to her native village. This is Oliver Stone at his directorial zenith! This is Tommy Lee Jones at his frightening best! This is Hiep Thi Le's (Ley Ly), brilliant debut! And this is Kitaro with creative genius on the motion picture score!Le's narration adds particular melancholy to the film. She sounds like she could have literally experienced the horrors of the woman she portrays. Ley Ly goes through hell on earth, folks! She is caught between the forces of the north and the south - neither of whom trust her; she and her family are forced to suffer the consequences for it. Men only seek to exploit her, and for a good while they succeed. However she meets Steve Butler (Jones) who does not want to manipulate her, but desires her for his wife. She mistrusts him initially, but Butler is persistent and kind. So she acquiesces. They marry and then leave Vietnam during the furious over-running of the south by the Viet Cong.They happily arrive in America. Unfortunately, as time progresses Butler finds it much more difficult to adapt to life there than does his wife who is there for the first time. The demons of war that had been sleeping in his head come back to life, and wreak havoc for him and his family. The cataclysmic fallout eventually drives Ley Ly back home to her village in Vietnam, and she discovers her true worth and place in this world.This film will stay with me forever; I will watch it again and again. Of all the narration Ley Ly speaks, I liked best when she said in the movie's final moments:""If you walk only on sunny days you will never reach your destination.""",5,Oliver Stone at His Best!,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,2291,"['love', 'most', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'films', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'how', 'gritty', 'are', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Platoon', 'come', 'mind', 'spectacular', 'films', 'got', 'good', 'enough', 'eyeful', 'first', 'viewings', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'view', 'again', 'either', 'entirely', 'different', 'reasons.Then', 'have', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'magnificent', 'very', 'distressing', 'sweeping', 'saga', 'Ley', 'Ly', 'Hayslip', 'Vietnamese', 'national', 'who', 'French', 'occupation', 'country', 'atrocity', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'immigration', 'America', 'vicarious', 'ramifications', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'syndrome', 'unanticipated', 'return', 'native', 'village', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'directorial', 'zenith', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'frightening', 'best', 'Hiep', 'Thi', 'Le', 'Ley', 'Ly', 'brilliant', 'debut', 'Kitaro', 'creative', 'genius', 'motion', 'picture', 'score', 'Le', 'narration', 'particular', 'melancholy', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'literally', 'experienced', 'horrors', 'woman', 'Ley', 'Ly', 'through', 'hell', 'earth', 'folks', 'caught', 'forces', 'north', 'south', 'neither', 'whom', 'trust', 'family', 'are', 'forced', 'suffer', 'consequences', 'Men', 'only', 'seek', 'exploit', 'good', 'succeed', 'However', 'Steve', 'Butler', 'Jones', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'manipulate', 'wife', 'initially', 'Butler', 'persistent', 'kind', 'acquiesces', 'marry', 'then', 'leave', 'Vietnam', 'furious', 'over-running', 'south', 'Viet', 'Cong.They', 'happily', 'arrive', 'America', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'Butler', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'adapt', 'life', 'there', 'wife', 'who', 'there', 'first', 'time', 'demons', 'war', 'had', 'been', 'sleeping', 'head', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'family', 'cataclysmic', 'fallout', 'eventually', 'Ley', 'Ly', 'back', 'home', 'village', 'Vietnam', 'true', 'worth', 'place', 'world.This', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'forever', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'narration', 'Ley', 'Ly', 'liked', 'best', 'when', 'said', 'movie', 'final', 'moments', 'walk', 'only', 'sunny', 'days', 'will', 'never', 'reach', 'destination']",Heaven & Earth VHS
356087,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,6303101224,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 2]","... and shamefully true. Oliver Stone's 1993 film ""Heaven and Earth"" is based entirely on the published autobiography of Le Ly Hayslip. It's a rather different sort of film from Stone's other works, and a less successful drama than he usually creates. Much of the problem results from Stone's one major deviation from the facts of Hayslip's memoir; he chose to  amalgamate three men into one, the American who brings Le Ly to San Diego as his wife and who then turns abusive, the character named `Steve Butler' in the film. Actor Tommy Lee Jones strove valiantly to make Steve Butler convincing, but the effort was wasted. The guy in the film goes every which way at once, both too good and too bad to be believed.Since this is Le Ly Hayslip's story and film far more than Stone's, I think we need some knowledge of her as a real person, well-known in the California Vietnamese community. Hayslip was the youngest of seven children born and raised in Ky La, now Xa Hao Qui, a village in central Vietnam, near Da Nang. American military advisors arrived in her village when she was 12 years old. At 14, she was tortured in a South Vietnamese government prison for ""revolutionary sympathies"". After being released, she fell under suspicion in her own village, which was in fact supportive of the  North Vietnamese, of being a government spy. She was sentenced to death by the Viet Cong, but instead of killing her, her executioners raped her. She fled to Saigon, where she and her mother worked as housekeepers for a wealthy Vietnamese family, the `man' of which family seduced her. When her pregnancy was discovered, the `wife' of the family forced Hayslip and her mother fto flee to Da Nang. By the age of 16, Hayslip was supporting both her mother and an infant son while working in the black market, as a drug courier, and once as a prostitute. She worked for a while as a nurse assistant in a Da Nang hospital and began dating Americans. She had several heartbreaking affairs before meeting and marrying an American civilian contractor named Ed Munro in 1969. Although he was more than twice her age, she had another son with him. Hayslip moved to California with Munro and briefly supported her family as a homemaker. In 1973, Munro died of emphysema, leaving Le Ly a widow at age 24. In 1974, she married Dennis Hayslip. Dennis was a heavy drinker, clinically depressed, and full of rage. Her third and youngest son, Alan, was fathered by Dennis and born on her 26th birthday. The couple filed for divorce in 1982. Shortly thereafter, he was found dead in a parked van outside a school building. He had established a trust fund, however, that left his wife with some money. With this money, she began a series of investments in real estate, the stock market, and small businesses that would eventually make her quite well off. She went on to found the East Meets West Foundation, a charitable group dedicated to improving the health and welfare of the Vietnamese, and the Global Village Foundation for humanitarian and emergency assistance to the needy in Vietnam and some other countries of Asia. Oliver Stone's film ends with Le Ly returning to visit her mother and other relatives in her village, roughly thirteen years after the fall of the South Vietnamese government.The film begins with Le Ly's over-over description of her childhood prior to the battle of Dien Bien Phu and the partition of Vietname into North and South. Le Ly tells us that she was born in ""the most beautiful village in the world"" and simultaneously Oliver Stone's cinematography shows us exactly that, The Most Beautiful Village in the World! as an idyllic paradise in saturated colors, an Eden of Buddhist ""right living."" This is one of the awkwardnesses of the film; the scene is just too fairy-tale perfect not to alarm our skepticism; it does, however, set us up for the shock of seeing the village devastated by war, crushed under tank treads by day and ravaged by guerillas by night, as the South Vietnamese and Americans swap turns with the Viet Cong in brutalizing Le Ly's family and neighbors. The breathtaking beauty of the village also contrasts sharply with the ugliness and squalor of wartime Saigon, and the ugliness and prosperity of suburban San Diego.Yes, the Viet Cong are portrayed less as noble independence fighters than as violent and vengeful oppressors. Likewise, when Le Ly returns to her now-Communist homeland, all is far from utopian. Oliver Stone would make no bones, I'm sure, about declaring that the French and American colonial wars in Vietnam were shameful episodes of brutality and corruption. Most of the world would agree. The Vietnam War brought suffering and loss upon the people of Vietnam for which there was, and is, no excuse or justification. But Stone is not blind to the savagery of the Viet Cong or to the truth that the aftermath of the North Vietnamese victory was not the restoration of paradise.The portrayal in this film of the Americans in Vietnam during the War, however, is far more shocking. They are defilers of the Vietnamese culture as well as destroyers of the Vietnamese landscape. Unfortunately, that portrayal is entirely true, and the shame that it represents in American history needs to be admitted. No occupying army ever behaved more vilely than the Americans (no, of course, not ALL of them) in Vietnam. In this way, America is anything but ""exceptional.""The portrayal of Americans at home -- the Americans of Steve Butler's family -- is more embarrassing than shocking. And Steve Butler, once he asserts his real nature, is the ugliest American-who-brings-home-an-Oriental-wife any critic of America could imagine. This is Le Ly's story, however, and it represents Le Ly's honest perception of America and American values. It's not a flattering perception. One can howl in outrage that Le Ly is ungrateful, that she's damned lucky to have made it to the Land of Opportunity, and such outrage is partially fair. Only the worst of America is depicted in Le Ly's memories. I can testify from experience, however, that Le Ly's caustic perceptions of American culture have been the common perceptions of millions of immigrants, many of whom have felt no need to be grateful for being treated like dirt. Anyway, director Oliver Stone has let Le Ly hae her say, has been faithful to her revelations of self.Stone has alos been faithful to Le Ly's enunciation of Buddhist ethics. There's a lot of Buddhist ""wisdom"" expressed in this fil, both in Le Ly's words, in those of her father, and in the words of Buddhist priests whom Le Ly consults. One doesn't need to believe in reincarnation, or to have much understanding of Buddhist philosophy, to recognize that ""karma"" is a valid concept in judging Le Ly's life story, and even more valid when applied to the history of the Vietnam War. America acquired a copious stock of ""bad karma"" in that war; even the few people who still maintain the justice of it would ahve to agree. And that ""bad karma"" has been playing out in the violent, hate-raddled polarization of American politics and culture ever since.",4,"Awkwardly Made, Painfully Moving ...",1294963200,"01 14,

After being raped and molested and had her newborn child taken from her, Le Ly seemingly found happiness with U.S. Marine Dennis Hayslip(Jones), and the two got married and moved to Los Angeles to begin a better life, only for Le Ly to found herself being assaulted by Dennis and shunned by her in-laws. The DVD also has special features include a orchestra soundtrack by composer Kintaro, and a trailer for the film.

I watched this film and just thought: This is what life is about, yes!The past couple of years of my life, I have learned, like Le Ly, that you pay for your sins from this life--and even past lives. I have had to deal with great pain like Le Ly, and have questioned God's intent.Le Ly's story is inspirational in that she teaches us not to question our fate, but simply to give it our all. She is not a flawless human being, she is a human being. She will pay for what she's done, and continue to learn about the laws of life.This movie is somewhat long, but it's difficult to pick parts to delete, cuz it all works for the whole movie. The two lead performances were amazing, as well as the supporting cast.

356092,A1O3VS7ASC3FKU,6303101224,Joe from Illinois,"[2, 2]","Like most information rich Oliver Stone Movies - must be viewed three times. First, just watch the movie and its movie sound track. Second, watch the movie while listening to the commentary track. Third, watch the movie and its movie soundtrack a second time - now knowing the background information of the unexplained images that you now see - to understand in depth everything that transpired. Oliver Stone movies are generally very well researched and there is a lot of information in the images of the movies that you either already know about from your own knowledge, life experience, or you become informed about when listening to the move commentary. Like most of his movies, there is an issue cutting a movie to get close to the 1.5 hour attention span limit that Hollywood has determined. This one even goes a little longer than Hollywood might like.This movie is a sleeper in that, as explained at the end of the commentary track, it was released in theaters roughly at the same time as the movie Schindler's List. Plus movie goers are not able to listen to a commentary track. It might also be difficult at that time, for some to view a real life Asian perspective to the Vietnamese conflict. Just as in Schindler's List, depending on your perspective, is another real life story and a compelling look at the ROI of warfare capitalism.As Oliver Stone was a combat GI in Vietnam, his own story chronicled by Charlie Sheen's character in his movie Platoon, he has a deeper understanding of that conflict and that country as seen both through his own eyes as a young American GI. Later  through the eyes of a young Vietnamese girl - the main character of this film. This Vietnamese girl came up in a country in conflict. She first helped the Vietcong, then scratched out a living off the edges of the war business, then married an American GI (Tommy Lee's Character) and moved to the US. Complete culture shock.This movie is fascinating on many levels. War plays a part, but is not the main conflict. The conflict in this movie is more on a personal and spiritual level. You will think about this one after viewing. I would call it Stones second best - first being JFK and second being Nixon.Just my two cents",5,Oliver Stone's Sleeper,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,2217,"['most', 'information', 'rich', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Movies', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'three', 'times', 'First', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'movie', 'sound', 'track', 'Second', 'watch', 'movie', 'listening', 'commentary', 'track', 'Third', 'watch', 'movie', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'second', 'time', 'now', 'knowing', 'background', 'information', 'unexplained', 'images', 'now', 'see', 'understand', 'depth', 'everything', 'transpired', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'movies', 'are', 'generally', 'very', 'well', 'researched', 'lot', 'information', 'images', 'movies', 'already', 'know', 'own', 'knowledge', 'life', 'experience', 'become', 'informed', 'when', 'listening', 'move', 'commentary', 'most', 'movies', 'issue', 'cutting', 'movie', 'get', 'close', '1.5', 'hour', 'attention', 'span', 'limit', 'Hollywood', 'determined', 'one', 'even', 'little', 'longer', 'Hollywood', 'might', 'like.This', 'movie', 'sleeper', 'explained', 'end', 'commentary', 'track', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'roughly', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'Schindler', 'List', 'movie', 'goers', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'listen', 'commentary', 'track', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'difficult', 'time', 'view', 'real', 'life', 'Asian', 'perspective', 'Vietnamese', 'conflict', 'Just', 'Schindler', 'List', 'depending', 'perspective', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'compelling', 'look', 'ROI', 'warfare', 'capitalism.As', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'was', 'combat', 'GI', 'Vietnam', 'own', 'story', 'chronicled', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'character', 'movie', 'Platoon', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'conflict', 'country', 'seen', 'own', 'eyes', 'young', 'American', 'GI', 'Later', 'eyes', 'young', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'came', 'up', 'country', 'conflict', 'first', 'helped', 'Vietcong', 'then', 'scratched', 'out', 'living', 'off', 'edges', 'war', 'business', 'then', 'married', 'American', 'GI', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Character', 'moved', 'US', 'Complete', 'culture', 'shock.This', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'many', 'levels', 'War', 'part', 'not', 'main', 'conflict', 'conflict', 'movie', 'more', 'personal', 'spiritual', 'level', 'will', 'think', 'one', 'viewing', 'would', 'call', 'Stones', 'second', 'best', 'first', 'being', 'JFK', 'second', 'being', 'Nixon.Just', 'two', 'cents']",Heaven & Earth VHS

She had an idyllic life in her Vietnamese village once.  But first there were the French, and then there were the Americans and the Viet Cong.  She was mistreated by both sides, winding up in Saigon with a baby.  Eventually, she married an American serviceman and moved to America.  But her troubles didn't end there.Hiep Thi Le, cast as the woman, does an outstanding job.  And Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful in his role as the American serviceman.  The cinematography was excellent and all the actors seemed real and authentic.  I was fascinated by the story, which was indeed horrific.  There were some deeply moving moments too, especially as they applied to family relationships.  Most of all, though, it all rang true.Even though it was a little overlong, I totally enjoyed it.  I found myself really identifying with the Vietnamese people and admiring the strength of Le Ly as she struggled to survive.

Not only does he talk about the process of filming the movie, but also he talks at length about the plight of the Vietnamese, the destruction of Vietnam's infrastructure and Buddhism.As a Vietnam veteran and an author of articles and books in which I talk about Vietnam, I highly recommend this incredible film.",5,Magnificent,1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,911,"['what', 'film', 'making', 'powerful', 'moving', 'heartbreaking', 'beautiful', 'only', 'movie', 'where', 'wept', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'moved', 'was', 'beauty', 'land', 'majesty', 'score', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'trashed', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'was', 'captivated', 'cinematography', 'sense', 'Vietnam', 'Stone', 'captured', 'so', 'well.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'not', 'just', 'superiority', 'video', 'also', 'Stone', 'commentary', 'thought', 'comments', 'DVD', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'were', 'excellent', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'get', 'even', 'better', 'Not', 'only', 'talk', 'process', 'filming', 'movie', 'also', 'length', 'plight', 'Vietnamese', 'destruction', 'Vietnam', 'infrastructure', 'Buddhism.As', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'author', 'articles', 'books', 'talk', 'Vietnam', 'highly', 'recommend', 'incredible', 'film']",Heaven & Earth VHS

Of all the anti-war films I've seen about Vietnam, all where about young Americans  losing their inoccense, Oliver Stone's moving and humane film is the first  (that I've seen) to consider the other side. The Vietnamese.The story  revolves around Le Ly Hayslip (Hiep Thi Le), she is her father's favourite  child and the centre of attention in her family. During the film's stunning  first hour, her village will be visited by members of the Viet-Cong and  representatives of the Southern government, both spreading propaganda and  both capable of unspeakable brutality. As Vietnamese the people of the  village are more sympathetic to Veit-Cong, and indeed Le Ly's two brothers  go to fight for the north. But Stone wisely avoids making heroes  of the  Veit-Cong, in one particularly harrowing scene they rape Le Ly because of  her detention by the southern forces. Heaven and Earth is more concerned  about the tragic effect of the war on Veitnam.As the war goes on Le  Ly is forced to be a street vendor in Saigon, where she meets a gentle  American man Steve (Tommy Lee Jones). His attraction to Le Ly however is  not so much love, as it is a desire to be forgiven by all  &quot;Orientals&quot; as he calls them. But Le Ly desperate and poor is  blinded by his kindness and togather they go to America to start a new life  as a married couple. It is here that film looses its footing, Steve's  behaviour is explained by the script, but his transformation from a gentle  man to a confused and angry one is so rushed, it is inexcplicable. The film  does recover in the powerful closing scenes set in Vietnam.The most  touching relationship in the film is between Le Ly and her father.  Heartbroken by what the war has done to his family he tells her &quot;Don't  ask what is right or wrong, these are dangerous questions, there's is only  the goodness in your heart.&quot; He has been through too much suffering to  consider war as an idealogical matter, he only wishes for the safety of his  favourite child so that she can live on the land of her  &quot;ancestors&quot;.Heaven and Earth is not as poetic as Terrance  Malick's The Thin Red Line, the narration is not as lyrical, and its  structure is not perfect. But there are individual passages in this film  that will linger with you for a long time.

This movie was one that helped me to become a Buddhist, as it showed the acceptance of both the beauty and horror of life and how we as sentient beings take them both in stride.  It shows a young girl's experience in war torn Vietnam, she one of the fortunate ones that did not perish but instead learns to deal with the loss of innocence, her family, her way of life and her home.  She adapts to each tragic event and becomes stronger along the way.  The genius of the film is that it shows the extreme beauty of the country and the people alongside the extreme brutal nature of invaders and those trying to survive their circumstances in war. It deals with a young girl's search for love, torture, senseless killing, loss of family members, unwanted pregnancy, fitting into a new culture of insensitive people, domestic violence, suicide and finally a trip back to her home. Where she finds out about the way the new regime affected its survivors.  Finally making peace out of all she experienced good and bad.  I have never seen a more beautiful Oliver Stone movie.

Sobering and realistic, This true story follows a young vietnamese girl and her family torn apart by the horrors of war and chaos. This is about the scars of war, the remnants of war, about those directly and indirectly effected by war. Forced to fight for the VC brigades for a time, then against them at another, this young girl was raped, tortured, despised by her own village and seen as a traitor. Her story is only one of many such stories. Young women caught in the middle of death and horror so unbelievable that it seems very hard to comprehend to those of us who have never experienced such agonies. She meets a soldier played by Tommy Lee Jones who merely wants to find someone to embrace and care for. He takes her and her one very young child to live with him in america. Jones by the way gives such a powerful, touching and painfully honest performance as a man filled with love who cant come to terms with the horrors he was forced to commit in the time of war. His performance left me breathless, utterly breathless. The pain and utter feelings of ruin his performance delivers is freightening and truly heartbreaking. It had me in bitter tears. Indeed I cried through most of the the last half of this film. Its a very sad and painful story but also truly touching at the same time. It takes a bit of time to get used to the rythem of the film and the feel for the acting. Particularly people who are supposed to be playing Vietnamese villagers all speaking in clear english. But after awhile it grows on you. It was also nice to see Haing S. Ngor in this film.

This is Stone's first solo  script since &quot;Platoon,&quot; which I consider the best of the Vietnam  war films, and again presents his unique talent for film structure. He  takes us through the life of a Vietnamese woman who went through the  horrors of war, literally, went into dispair, found love and lost it, found  it again and lost it once more, and in the end stood triumphant above her  struggles. As is the case with most his films, &quot;Heaven And Earth&quot;  is based on a true story, and Stone brings it incredibly to life on the  screen. The images stay in your mind as do the characters. The story is  moving and effective and immensly powerful. Stone handles this film with  care and shows his true artistic talent of filmmaking (but then again, he  does that in all his films). With &quot;Heaven And Earth&quot; he completes  a trilogy that began with &quot;Platoon,&quot; continued with &quot;Born On  The Fourth Of July,&quot; and ends here. What is gripping about this film  is the performances and drama. Stone doesn't just show us a life as much as  he takes us into one. All his film vibrate with realism, they are active,  they are alive, and the same is here. &quot;Heaven And Earth&quot; is  moving, powerful, a true dramatic motion picture, and one of Stone's best  works because here he explores something deeper and more moving than in  other movies.

356108,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,6303101224,Shashank Tripathi,"[11, 20]","""Heaven and Earth"" is a lesser known sibling of other Vietnam-centric epics from Oliver Stone -- ""Platoon"" and ""Born on the 4th of July"". It is as brilliant a testament of Vietnam's devastatation as any of the others from Stone, but there is a reason why this film remains no more than a blip on international radars.The movie begins with the same stunning cinematography that you expect from Richardson, and pulls you in immediately. We follow the simple lives of Vietnamese rural folk (surrounding by idyllic fields, mountains, and a deliciously ordinary every-day life between the ""Heaven & Earth""). But this song and dance is jerked 20 minutes into the movie by the Viet Cong (VC) and other ""bad bad"" people on either side of the war -- the rebels on one side, and the US-aided forces on the other.  Stone leaves no stone unturned, no gruesome detail uncaught on tape, no rape missed -- it's gruesome to watch, and more so for some viewers because it requires you to think.But that's where the good stuff ends.The movie is loooong. Nearly 2.5 hours of mindbending mayhem, with a whole barrage of twists and turns. Our simple village girl from Vietnam escapes with Tommy Lee Jones, but finds that  US has communist contours of its own, where her overweight sister in law forces her to eat a lot of meat and food, where her husband's friend gratuitously talks about his ""fetish"" for ""Oriental women"" too, her husband is an arms dealer and a wife-beater, etc etc.The movie is full of platitudes. Sappy stuff like ""Different skin, same suffering."" The theme of war-time atrocities on the innocent,  the futility of war, are all very well but nothing new. This was supposedly the Vietnamese perspective, the ordinary person's perspective etc...but an hour into the movie it becomes difficult to care without much happening.The movie has a whiny, annoying actress for a protagonist. She simply does not measure up to the rigor and depth of the role, and surely seems like a sour spouse for Lee Jones.But the worst possible thing about the movie is it ending -- it beats you over the head with the point. For the most part fans of thrillers aren't dumb, although it seems the director doesnt realize that.A worthy rental for sure, but not a movie I could watch more than once.",5,"WHO'S THE ""COMMUNIST""?",1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,2273,"['Heaven', 'Earth', 'lesser', 'known', 'sibling', 'other', 'Vietnam-centric', 'epics', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Platoon', 'Born', '4th', 'July', 'brilliant', 'testament', 'Vietnam', 'devastatation', 'others', 'Stone', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'more', 'blip', 'international', 'radars.The', 'movie', 'same', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'expect', 'Richardson', 'pulls', 'immediately', 'follow', 'simple', 'lives', 'Vietnamese', 'rural', 'folk', 'surrounding', 'idyllic', 'fields', 'mountains', 'deliciously', 'ordinary', 'every-day', 'life', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'song', 'dance', 'jerked', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'VC', 'other', 'bad', 'bad', 'people', 'side', 'war', 'rebels', 'one', 'side', 'US-aided', 'forces', 'other', 'Stone', 'stone', 'unturned', 'gruesome', 'detail', 'uncaught', 'tape', 'rape', 'missed', 'gruesome', 'watch', 'more', 'so', 'viewers', 'think.But', 'where', 'good', 'stuff', 'ends.The', 'movie', 'loooong', 'Nearly', '2.5', 'hours', 'mindbending', 'mayhem', 'whole', 'barrage', 'twists', 'turns', 'simple', 'village', 'girl', 'Vietnam', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'US', 'communist', 'contours', 'own', 'where', 'overweight', 'sister', 'law', 'forces', 'eat', 'lot', 'meat', 'food', 'where', 'husband', 'friend', 'gratuitously', 'talks', 'fetish', 'Oriental', 'women', 'too', 'husband', 'arms', 'dealer', 'wife-beater', 'etc', 'etc.The', 'movie', 'full', 'platitudes', 'Sappy', 'stuff', 'Different', 'skin', 'same', 'suffering', 'theme', 'war-time', 'atrocities', 'innocent', 'futility', 'war', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'nothing', 'new', 'was', 'supposedly', 'Vietnamese', 'perspective', 'ordinary', 'person', 'perspective', 'etc', 'hour', 'movie', 'difficult', 'care', 'much', 'happening.The', 'movie', 'whiny', 'annoying', 'actress', 'protagonist', 'simply', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'rigor', 'depth', 'role', 'surely', 'sour', 'spouse', 'Lee', 'Jones.But', 'worst', 'possible', 'thing', 'movie', 'ending', 'head', 'point', 'most', 'part', 'fans', 'thrillers', 'are', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'director', 'doesnt', 'realize', 'that.A', 'worthy', 'rental', 'sure', 'not', 'movie', 'could', 'watch', 'more', 'once']",Heaven & Earth VHS

It is a good attempt, but the book is definitely better, When Heaven and Earth Changed Places, by Le Ly Hayslip and Jay Wurts.I wish the movie was mainly in Vietnamese though.

It's when they have to speak English when they are talking to Americans, but speaking English in Vietnam with other Vietnamese irked me a lot while watching this film.

356114,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,6303101224,Zack Davisson,"[45, 48]","""Heaven and Earth"" is a difficult movie to tackle.  The almost-true story of Le Ly Hayslip,  it is a beautiful, compelling story of a peasant girl caught up in the madness of the American/Viet Nam war, not knowing which side to take and ultimately attempting just to stay alive and find some happiness.Almost-true, because her amazing story needed to be condensed into a two and a half hour feature film.  Three men became one, years became weeks and vast sections of her life were neatly trimmed away.  This is understandable in any biographical film, but the result her is not so fluid as in other movies of this type.  Also, an odd decision was made to film the movie entirely in English, except when interacting with American soldiers when they slip into a sort of broken English.  Having the film be in Vietnamese, with subtitles, would have made for a more authentic experience.Tommy Lee Jones' character, the three men condensed into one, jumps too quickly from Hero to Monster to Victim, and one seeks for the core of his character in the movie.  Who is he?  It is difficult to tell.  Hiep Thi Le as Le Ly is also confusing, at one minute the innocent, wide-eyed girl looking to be loved and the next a sophisticated businesswoman who is willing to sacrifice everything for success and money.  As seen in ""Evita,"" this kind of transformation isn't impossible to tell but here it doesn't seem honest.  One looks for the sophisticate in the peasant or the peasant in the sophisticate, and doesn't find them.In spite of these criticisms, there is enough right about ""Heaven and Earth"" to make the film enjoying and captivating.  Telling the American/Viet Nam war from the point of view of the Vietnamese people is a jarring juxtaposition, and something I have never seen done before.  Such a daring feat would be almost impossible in today's political climate of the US.  Le Ly's story takes her through all walks of life and many aspects of the war, giving you something to think about at each stage.The cinematography is beautiful, and the colors and textures of Viet Nam make it seem like a paradise.  The paradise is shattered by wars, with the green rice being overrun by the green tank and soldiers.  In such a situation, it is difficult to tell who is right and who is wrong, with each side putting guns to your head ordering you to believe their ideology.I am glad to see this version of the DVD being released, with Hiep Thi Le on the cover instead of Tommy Lee Jones.  Good as he is, he is in only about 30 minutes of the film, and certainly doesn't deserve the cover.",4,A different side of the story,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,2583,"['Heaven', 'Earth', 'difficult', 'movie', 'tackle', 'almost-true', 'story', 'Le', 'Ly', 'Hayslip', 'beautiful', 'compelling', 'story', 'peasant', 'girl', 'caught', 'up', 'madness', 'American/Viet', 'Nam', 'war', 'not', 'knowing', 'side', 'take', 'ultimately', 'attempting', 'just', 'stay', 'alive', 'find', 'happiness.Almost-true', 'amazing', 'story', 'needed', 'be', 'condensed', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'feature', 'film', 'Three', 'men', 'became', 'one', 'years', 'became', 'weeks', 'vast', 'sections', 'life', 'were', 'neatly', 'trimmed', 'away', 'understandable', 'biographical', 'film', 'result', 'not', 'so', 'fluid', 'other', 'movies', 'type', 'Also', 'odd', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'movie', 'entirely', 'English', 'when', 'interacting', 'American', 'soldiers', 'when', 'slip', 'sort', 'broken', 'English', 'Having', 'film', 'be', 'Vietnamese', 'subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'authentic', 'experience.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'character', 'three', 'men', 'condensed', 'one', 'too', 'quickly', 'Hero', 'Monster', 'Victim', 'one', 'seeks', 'core', 'character', 'movie', 'Who', 'difficult', 'tell', 'Hiep', 'Thi', 'Le', 'Le', 'Ly', 'also', 'confusing', 'one', 'minute', 'innocent', 'wide-eyed', 'girl', 'looking', 'be', 'loved', 'next', 'sophisticated', 'businesswoman', 'who', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'everything', 'success', 'money', 'seen', 'Evita', 'kind', 'transformation', ""n't"", 'impossible', 'tell', 'here', ""n't"", 'seem', 'honest', 'One', 'sophisticate', 'peasant', 'peasant', 'sophisticate', ""n't"", 'find', 'them.In', 'spite', 'criticisms', 'enough', 'right', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'make', 'film', 'enjoying', 'captivating', 'Telling', 'American/Viet', 'Nam', 'war', 'point', 'view', 'Vietnamese', 'people', 'jarring', 'juxtaposition', 'something', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'done', 'before', 'daring', 'feat', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'impossible', 'today', 'political', 'climate', 'US', 'Le', 'Ly', 'story', 'walks', 'life', 'many', 'aspects', 'war', 'giving', 'something', 'think', 'stage.The', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'textures', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'make', 'paradise', 'paradise', 'shattered', 'wars', 'green', 'rice', 'being', 'overrun', 'green', 'tank', 'soldiers', 'such', 'situation', 'difficult', 'tell', 'who', 'right', 'who', 'wrong', 'side', 'putting', 'guns', 'head', 'ordering', 'believe', 'ideology.I', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'version', 'DVD', 'being', 'released', 'Hiep', 'Thi', 'Le', 'cover', 'instead', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Good', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'cover']",Heaven & Earth VHS
