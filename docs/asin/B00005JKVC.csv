591190,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00005JKVC,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","ALL THE RIGHT MOVES (1983) stars Tom Cruise as Stefen Djordjevic, an ambitious high school football cornerback who wants to be a design engineer, plus Craig T. Nelson as his coach. Also featured is an incredibly young Chris Penn. As a teen he was tall and thin and had a baby face. On first glance you wouldn't connect this kid with the man he later became.This film does have one good football sequence (plus some scenes of practice sessions), but it's mostly a sad drama of a crumbling Rust Belt steel mill town and the blue collar folk (young and old) who feel trapped there. For several ball-playing teens, escape is tangible. A college scholarship will do the trick. Cruise and Penn are two of these hopefuls. The dreams of both however may not come true.Their otherwise unnoteworthy high school has fielded State Championship teams on several occasions. The penultimate game of the season, where visiting scouts will be in attendance, is at a rival school with better facilities and middle class students who are privileged by comparison. The game turns tragic for the underdogs from Ampipe when with 12 seconds left and a few point lead, a fumble on their own 1 yard line allows the other team to score a winning TD.In the locker room, heartbreak and hard feelings abound, recriminations fly and when it's over Cruise is kicked off the team by a coach who later takes revenge (after his house and yard are vandalized) by destroying the boy's chances of any college offering him a football scholarship.Human nature being often stubbornly unforgiving, this one's happy Hollywood ending is unrealistic.(rated 5.7 at IMDb)",3,"Steff: ""You know, Nickerson, you are not God!

Stef has ambitions to leave the town by obtaining a football scholarship at a university, hence, achieving a better life. The steel mill, which seems to employ the entire population of the town, is also laying workers off.This is a very coming-of-age movie and focuses alot on teenagers and issues that they have to deal with as well as on people, who are ""stuck"" living in small towns or poor areas with limited future prospects. The title ""All the Right Moves"" translates really to making the right choices in this state of one's life.Stef, played by Tom Cruise, has to perform well in football games, impress scouts from universities, and deal with his loving girlfriend Lisa. Other minor characters in the movie are teammate Brian, who unintentionally impregnates his girlfriend which destroys his plan to attent USC on a football scholarship, and Vinny Salvucci, who gets involved in crime and winds up behind bars.The plot peaks in the movie when Stef gets into a conflict with his coach, who, as a result, uses his influance to discourage other colleges from offering Stef any scholarships. Can Stef still make it out of the dying mill town via a scholarship or will he be stuck in a factory for the rest of his life?The only thing I didn't like was the supposed dilemma presented by Lisa that she is stuck in the town because her parents have no money and no school offers scholarship in her desired specialty. I believe that is nonsense. Almost any person who wants to attain a higher education, can do so. There are many options such as working part-time, student loans, scholarships, financial aid, military, and others.

This film was especially touching for me due to the fact that about the time this film came out, I was heading off to college. In truth, at the time I mostly enjoyed this film for the famous, or perhaps infamous nude scene between Tom Cruise and Lea Thompson. Such as it is with most teenagers. As I grew older I developed a deeper appreciation for the story, beyond that one scene. All the Right Moves is a good title, but doesn't really fit the film, as the characters of the film, as in real life, make choices that are not always the best. Like most of us, the characters land on their feet like the cats we covet despite choices and circumstances. Overall this is a good film to recommend for the young adult.

To discover today this thirty year old film with a Tom Cruise who must have been hardly out of his teens at the time is funny but interesting to know what an important actor today was at the beginning of his career. You may recognize some of his facial and attitudinal ticks but he sure was young.The film itself is nothing to brag about. A High School football film again. Stef is a promising football player who could easily get a football scholarship in any college or nearly, if he could finish his senior year on the football team and even take the team to a victory.He does not because he makes a mistake he had been warned about several times on the last game he plays (the last but one of the season). In fact his team loses the game because he attacks a player who had the ball after he had passed the ball away. He was attacking the man instead of following the ball. Penalty and the game is lost.The coach is furious of course after the game but Stef is aggressive and in fact attacks the coach and makes him responsible. From this point to the catastrophe there was only one step and Stef crossed it. He is dropped from the team. Then he has to walk home, quite a good distance. So he thumbs a lift and is picked by a band of loafers from his city who decide to go spoil and soil the home of the coach and his cars. They manage to get Stef along and he is considered as responsible for it.He is dropped from all prospective colleges. Since he is from a steel industry city in Pennsylvania, he has no future except working at the mill.The film is supposed to teach us a lesson, just the way it does to Stef: apologize and forgive, but that's hard when you were wrong in the first place, though it is also hard when you get even with someone who is wrong by being wrong yourself, i.e. not forgiving and/or not apologizing. At the same time apologizing and forgiving may become a sort of encouragement to other people to go on being obnoxious.Life at times cannot go without some strife and tension and people have to learn to step over it and just put it behind. But fear comes back into the picture. When you are afraid of life you tend to look back behind yourself and then you cannot put the past behind. If you try too hard it might backfire, at least in your dreams.The myth in the film is that such strife and tension is typically masculine and it takes women to soften the situation: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and the medicine goes down. Really? I am sure I will trip my foot in the carpet if I tried that magic potion.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,A drop less morality would be good,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,2625,"['Curiosity', 'may', 'kill', 'cat', 'not', 'kill', 'nostalgia', 'discover', 'today', 'thirty', 'year', 'old', 'film', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'hardly', 'teens', 'time', 'funny', 'interesting', 'know', 'what', 'important', 'actor', 'today', 'was', 'beginning', 'career', 'may', 'recognize', 'facial', 'attitudinal', 'ticks', 'sure', 'was', 'young.The', 'film', 'nothing', 'brag', 'about', 'High', 'School', 'football', 'film', 'again', 'Stef', 'promising', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'get', 'football', 'scholarship', 'college', 'nearly', 'could', 'finish', 'senior', 'year', 'football', 'team', 'even', 'take', 'team', 'victory.He', 'not', 'mistake', 'had', 'been', 'warned', 'several', 'times', 'last', 'game', 'last', 'one', 'season', 'fact', 'team', 'game', 'player', 'who', 'had', 'ball', 'had', 'passed', 'ball', 'away', 'was', 'attacking', 'man', 'instead', 'following', 'ball', 'Penalty', 'game', 'lost.The', 'coach', 'furious', 'course', 'game', 'Stef', 'aggressive', 'fact', 'coach', 'responsible', 'point', 'catastrophe', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'step', 'Stef', 'crossed', 'dropped', 'team', 'Then', 'walk', 'home', 'quite', 'good', 'distance', 'lift', 'picked', 'band', 'loafers', 'city', 'who', 'decide', 'go', 'spoil', 'soil', 'home', 'coach', 'cars', 'manage', 'get', 'Stef', 'along', 'considered', 'responsible', 'it.He', 'dropped', 'prospective', 'colleges', 'steel', 'industry', 'city', 'Pennsylvania', 'future', 'working', 'mill.The', 'film', 'supposed', 'teach', 'lesson', 'just', 'way', 'Stef', 'apologize', 'forgive', 'hard', 'when', 'were', 'wrong', 'first', 'place', 'also', 'hard', 'when', 'get', 'even', 'someone', 'who', 'wrong', 'being', 'wrong', 'i.e', 'not', 'forgiving', 'not', 'apologizing', 'same', 'time', 'apologizing', 'forgiving', 'may', 'become', 'sort', 'encouragement', 'other', 'people', 'go', 'being', 'obnoxious.Life', 'times', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'strife', 'tension', 'people', 'have', 'learn', 'step', 'just', 'put', 'fear', 'back', 'picture', 'When', 'are', 'afraid', 'life', 'tend', 'look', 'back', 'then', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'past', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'might', 'backfire', 'least', 'dreams.The', 'myth', 'film', 'such', 'strife', 'tension', 'typically', 'masculine', 'women', 'soften', 'situation', 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious', 'medicine', 'down', 'Really', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'trip', 'foot', 'carpet', 'tried', 'magic', 'potion.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

This movie is more like a ""nice try"" picture.  As these types of pictures go, it is cliche ridden and dial down the center.  From the opening shot of the film one thing is clear:  there is a factory, and it does not look like a slap happy good time to work there.Young Tom Cruise plays Stef, a factory worker's son in a factory workers' town.  The only way out of this town, hence not working at the factory the rest of your life, is to get a football scholarship to college.  Stef happens to be good at football, so he won't have to work at the factory right?  Well, it is clear that he and the coach (Craig T. Nelson) are not always on the same page.  So, of course, the pressure is building.  The best schools aren't calling, his girlfriend (Lea Thompson) won't sleep with him, and his best friend (Chris Penn, also a football player) is having a baby (which means he will work in the factory).  Something has to give?  It does, in the big game. Where else?This movie is just perfectly ordinary.  The attempt to get into the characters mostly makes no sense.  And when it does it is just typical diologue we have heard a thousand times before. It seemed like Cruise was almost forced to self-destruct and then someone decided that it couldn't end on a downer. The ending is laughable it is so forced and out of place. With a cast like this, given they were young, I expected more.So why did Cruise do this movie?  Good question.  He made another film the same year that dealt with similar subject matter, a teenager trying to get into college and the powers that are working against him.

591204,A19W1FGD76MXOZ,B00005JKVC,Paul Haspel,"[0, 0]","""All the Right Moves"" should have made for a great, ""Rocky""-style sports drama of an underdog achieving success against all odds.  The source material -- an article titled ""Duquesne, PA"" by sports journalist Pat Jordan -- does a first-rate job of describing a Pennsylvania steel town where players on the high school football team see a college scholarship as the only possible way out of a bleak future in the industrial underclass.  The director, Michael Chapman, had made a name for himself through his brilliant cinematography on Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull,"" and the film is well-photographed; its filmed-on-location images of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, are so strikingly bleak that a number of Johnstown residents feel to this day that the filmmakers treated them and their hometown unfairly.  The film's stars -- Tom Cruise, Lea Thompson, Craig T. Nelson -- are all good at their work.  And yet, somehow, the film doesn't come together.  As ""All the Right Moves"" seeks to tell its story of a personal conflict between star player Stefen Djordjevic (Cruise) and Coach Nickerson (Nelson), each of whom is hoping for different reasons that football will get him out of a life sentence in a steel town, too much of the film's plot depends upon major characters making inexplicable decisions -- from a coach failing to have his quarterback kneel down with the ball on the last play of a close game, to a classmate of Stefen's suddenly turning to crime for no reason that is ever adequately explained.  As a result, the whole picture takes on a rather contrived feel, and what could have been an interesting study of character and social class in post-industrial America instead becomes a conventional Hollywood entertainment.",3,"Great idea for a movie, but flawed execution",1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,1746,"['Right', 'Moves', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'Rocky', '-style', 'sports', 'drama', 'underdog', 'achieving', 'success', 'odds', 'source', 'material', 'article', 'titled', 'Duquesne', 'PA', 'sports', 'journalist', 'Pat', 'Jordan', 'first-rate', 'job', 'describing', 'Pennsylvania', 'steel', 'town', 'where', 'players', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'see', 'college', 'scholarship', 'only', 'possible', 'way', 'bleak', 'future', 'industrial', 'underclass', 'director', 'Michael', 'Chapman', 'had', 'made', 'name', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'film', 'well-photographed', 'filmed-on-location', 'images', 'Johnstown', 'Pennsylvania', 'are', 'so', 'strikingly', 'bleak', 'number', 'Johnstown', 'residents', 'feel', 'day', 'filmmakers', 'treated', 'hometown', 'unfairly', 'film', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'are', 'good', 'work', 'yet', 'somehow', 'film', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'Right', 'Moves', 'tell', 'story', 'personal', 'conflict', 'star', 'player', 'Stefen', 'Djordjevic', 'Cruise', 'Coach', 'Nickerson', 'Nelson', 'whom', 'hoping', 'different', 'reasons', 'football', 'will', 'get', 'life', 'sentence', 'steel', 'town', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'plot', 'major', 'characters', 'making', 'inexplicable', 'decisions', 'coach', 'failing', 'have', 'quarterback', 'kneel', 'ball', 'last', 'play', 'close', 'game', 'classmate', 'Stefen', 'suddenly', 'turning', 'crime', 'reason', 'ever', 'adequately', 'explained', 'result', 'whole', 'picture', 'rather', 'contrived', 'feel', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'study', 'character', 'social', 'class', 'post-industrial', 'America', 'instead', 'conventional', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment']",N/A

Nelson is oft (been reading too many Game Of Thrones books) overlooked for his performance here and coming after Robby Benson's excellent One On One with a brittle but subtle performance by G.D. Spradlin...he takes the vindictiveness to new heights and paints a Coach's legacy that must have affected the boys who undoubtedly passed his way over the years psychologically long after they graduated from his reach.  At least Cruise decides to fight back.  Good movie of its time and swept under the carpet by the competition when it came out.  It's nice to go back and see the promise that Cruise exhibited here along with a moving portrayal by Lea Thompson (the mom in Back To The Future)as his small town girlfriend.  It also includes the infamous scene where Cruise exposes more than just his acting talent that made this an underground 'must' for certain segments of the audience back then (and that's just how it would have been referred to at that time).

That is a shame because Cruise's ""other"" coming-of-age film is a highly entertaining effort that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as his more high profile projects.Cruise plays Stefan Djordjevic, a high school football player who dreams of being awarded a college scholarship in order to escape a future in the steel mills.  However, Stefan's short temper often gets the best of him and his relationship with his high school coach (Craig T. Nelson) becomes strained after he participates in an incident that leaves the coach's house vandalized.  With the help of his high school sweetheart, Lisa (Lea Thompson), Stefan starts to get his act together and ultimately gets his life back on track.""All the Right Moves"" proves that Tom Cruise had tremendous screen presence from the very beginning.  His scenes with Nelson and Thompson provide dazzling hints of greater things still to come.  Nelson, who may be better known for his comedic side, turns in an especially strong supporting performance as the coach who is both Stefan's tormentor and supporter at the same time.  The story of the small-town kid dreaming to escape his surroundings for better things has been told so many times on television and film in so many different ways that it would be easy to dismiss ""All the Right Moves"" as just another tired re-telling.
