1675608,A156PASM83DS8J,B00FZURN3C,Ken Castillo,"[1, 1]","Ahhh another Mega Shark movie but this time around he goes up against Mecha Shark. I take it that this is Asylum's take on Godzilla vs Mega Godzilla. Anyway, the story lacks the fights I was kind of hopping to see between the two monsters but it was a decent fight. The story is also kind of sluggish but I will have to say that the CGI has definitely improved as the usual production for Asylums films are filmed within 2 weeks tops. I do have to hand it to them that they were will able to keep my attention on this one. Call me weird but yeah, I do like cheesy B rated flicks and it's all in good fun. This isn't one of the better Mega Shark films but Asylum Films is keeping the junk food Mock Busters alive. Would I recommend this movie to anybody?

1675612,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00FZURN3C,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[4, 5]","While transporting an iceberg to Alexandria, Egypt another Mega-Shark becomes thawed, alive and dangerous. The recently thawed creature is able to sling the tug boat through the air and knock off the head of the Sphinx 112+ miles away. They managed to create a Mecha-Shark to combat the creature because Mark 48 torpedoes always miss the mark and come back to sink the launching ship. Pony tailed Rosie (Elisabeth R&ouml;hm) is the pilot of the battery operated mechanical shark even though it has a computer that can do it. They create a second mechanical shark just because. After they tag the Mega-Shark with a GPS device, they still need Debbie Gibson to tell them where the shark is headed, because she adds a name to the DVD cover. Eat your heart out Danny Trejo.  Rosie has an awkward  flashback to a child that died, which really didn't work well in the film.Asylum continues its Navy insignia guessing game. In this film the admiral wore two ""surface warfare specialist"" breast pins on his lapels (no rank insignia) while a captain wears the breast pin on his shirt pocket (close but no cigar).The ending of the film was a big ""huh?"" Mild cheese factor. Bad dialog, and they had a great opportunity with a talking computer. The admiral knew someone who died on every boat, and made sure we knew too. Not the best Asylum Mega film out there. If you haven't seen the other ones, I would expect them to all be out soon on one DVD for $5.00.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",2,I HAVE THE STICK,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,1489,"['transporting', 'iceberg', 'Alexandria', 'Egypt', 'Mega-Shark', 'becomes', 'thawed', 'alive', 'dangerous', 'recently', 'thawed', 'creature', 'able', 'sling', 'tug', 'boat', 'air', 'knock', 'off', 'head', 'Sphinx', '112+', 'miles', 'away', 'managed', 'create', 'Mecha-Shark', 'combat', 'creature', 'Mark', '48', 'torpedoes', 'always', 'miss', 'mark', 'come', 'back', 'sink', 'launching', 'ship', 'Pony', 'tailed', 'Rosie', 'Elisabeth', 'R', 'ouml', 'hm', 'pilot', 'battery', 'operated', 'mechanical', 'shark', 'even', 'computer', 'can', 'do', 'create', 'second', 'mechanical', 'shark', 'just', 'tag', 'Mega-Shark', 'GPS', 'device', 'still', 'need', 'Debbie', 'Gibson', 'tell', 'where', 'shark', 'headed', 'name', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Eat', 'heart', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'Rosie', 'awkward', 'flashback', 'child', 'died', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'film.Asylum', 'Navy', 'insignia', 'guessing', 'game', 'film', 'admiral', 'wore', 'two', 'surface', 'warfare', 'specialist', 'breast', 'pins', 'lapels', 'rank', 'insignia', 'captain', 'breast', 'pin', 'shirt', 'pocket', 'close', 'cigar', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'big', 'huh', 'Mild', 'cheese', 'factor', 'Bad', 'dialog', 'had', 'great', 'opportunity', 'talking', 'computer', 'admiral', 'knew', 'someone', 'who', 'died', 'boat', 'made', 'sure', 'knew', 'too', 'Not', 'best', 'Asylum', 'Mega', 'film', 'there', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'ones', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'out', 'soon', 'one', 'DVD', '5.00.Parental', 'Guide', 'f-bombs', 'sex', 'nudity']",Mega Shark Vs Mecha Shark
