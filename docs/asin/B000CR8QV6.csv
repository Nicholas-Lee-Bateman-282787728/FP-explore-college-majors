Again during  a period of terrible unrest in Sicily with the local mafia and the courageous judges who try to make a difference in that faction torn region.La Scorta, the escorts, or actually the Bodyguards, tells the story of four diverse men detailed to guard the life of yet another Judge sent from the North to try and keep peace and justice in this faction riddled land.The men have some trouble getting along together but eventually end by forming a tight and close band dedicated to preserving the life of the Judge they are committed to protect.For who knows this period of Sicilian history the ending is plausible.

961434,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B000CR8QV6,Pork Chop,"[6, 10]","LA SCORTA, a movie released in 1993, played by Italianactors, is very much a European movie, that rolls all intoone many aspects of a small, ephemeral microcosm,surrounding an investigation into corruption and awardingof contracts based on special favors between businessmenand certain elected politicians, with the judiciary andlaw enforcement caught in the crossfire.It's not an action movie, considering that many personal,human sides of the officers are demonstrated, such asmoments with family, kids, birthdays, festivities, etc.It's not a humorous movie, either, considering the serioustopic it covers, deadly serious even, such as shown by anexplosive planted in a car, or 2 motocycle men doubling asexecutioners, the death of powerful politicians, etc.What this movie does, is portray the enormous frustration,confusion, and struggle that occurs when there aremillions of people, and large numbers of specialinterests, powerful people of all walks of life, each pullingin every direction, such that nobody is completelysatisfied at any time, in terms of meeting theirown objectives. This is a lesson learned early on by many,obviously, in life, and it has a lot to do with theparadox of each person wishing to walk along the righteouspath, do the right thing, yet having to blend in, and goalong with what everyone else is doing in society, and expects,so everyone can ""get along."" Call it the need to look the otherway, sometimes, because otherwise, perhaps society would beunworkable. Each is an individual. Each has his or her owngoals. Each goes about reaching them in different ways.Each has to win, in some way or another, maybe partially only,for the totality of the system to work.At the end, the special prosecutor is fired, because he'sinflexible in his rigid interpretation of the eliminationof corruption, alienating everyone around him.

961437,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000CR8QV6,Trevor Willsmer,"[22, 23]","La Scorta is one of the best Italian films of the 90s, although that hasn't stopped it from disappearing from circulation for years until Blue Underground's DVD release. Unlike the Eurotrash which is that label's main stock-in-trade, this is a powerful and sober crime drama (rather than an out-and-out thriller) about the small group of bodyguards protecting a judge investigating mafia and government corruption in Sicily. It's certainly not a glamorous portrait:  terminally underfunded, they only have two bullet-proof vests between them, and instead of armoured cars they get clapped-out unmarked vehicles the police can't even afford to keep the tanks full. There's not much in the way of action, but there's plenty of suspense over what MIGHT happen. Every abandoned car by the roadside could be a bomb, a stuck gate could be a prime opportunity for an assassin, so that when the expected does finally happen (and to the most obvious candidate in the most obvious fashion) it doesn't feel quite like such a cliche, more inevitability. The film does a good job of humanising its protagonists en route. While they all have the usual stereotyped dead meat trappings - families, girlfriends, pregnant wives - they spend much of the first half jockeying for position, making mistakes and inadvertently betraying their charge. Ricky Tognazzi directs with energy and imagination that belies the film's low budget and is well served by his ensemble cast.Sadly, the DVD transfer, while acceptable, is not great, although the extras - audio commentary by Ricky Tognazzi and Claudio Bonivento, documentary Judging La Scorta, US trailer and original Italian trailer - are good.",5,A forgotten classic well worth remembering,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,1672,"['La', 'Scorta', 'one', 'best', 'Italian', 'films', '90s', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'disappearing', 'circulation', 'years', 'Blue', 'Underground', 'DVD', 'release', 'Eurotrash', 'label', 'main', 'stock-in-trade', 'powerful', 'sober', 'crime', 'drama', 'rather', 'out-and-out', 'thriller', 'small', 'group', 'bodyguards', 'protecting', 'judge', 'investigating', 'mafia', 'government', 'corruption', 'Sicily', 'certainly', 'not', 'glamorous', 'portrait', 'terminally', 'underfunded', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'bullet-proof', 'vests', 'instead', 'armoured', 'cars', 'get', 'clapped-out', 'unmarked', 'vehicles', 'police', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'afford', 'keep', 'tanks', 'full', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'action', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'what', 'MIGHT', 'happen', 'abandoned', 'car', 'roadside', 'could', 'be', 'bomb', 'stuck', 'gate', 'could', 'be', 'prime', 'opportunity', 'assassin', 'when', 'expected', 'finally', 'happen', 'most', 'obvious', 'candidate', 'most', 'obvious', 'fashion', ""n't"", 'feel', 'quite', 'cliche', 'more', 'inevitability', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'humanising', 'protagonists', 'route', 'have', 'usual', 'stereotyped', 'dead', 'meat', 'trappings', 'families', 'girlfriends', 'pregnant', 'wives', 'spend', 'much', 'first', 'half', 'jockeying', 'position', 'making', 'mistakes', 'inadvertently', 'betraying', 'charge', 'Ricky', 'Tognazzi', 'energy', 'imagination', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'well', 'served', 'ensemble', 'cast.Sadly', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'acceptable', 'not', 'great', 'extras', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Ricky', 'Tognazzi', 'Claudio', 'Bonivento', 'documentary', 'Judging', 'La', 'Scorta', 'US', 'trailer', 'original', 'Italian', 'trailer', 'are', 'good']",N/A
