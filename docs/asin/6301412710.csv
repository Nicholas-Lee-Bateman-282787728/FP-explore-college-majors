Blackwood's novel of the same title inspired what was seen in this film. A bearded Philip is present at the arraignment of a young Romanian girl named Nina(Paulina Porizkova). Nina was accused of murder and was convicted. After Philip shaves his beard down to a moustache,he visits Nina in prison,dressed as a minister and bails her out. This is where their romance began.

251778,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6301412710,Bobby Underwood,"[30, 32]","Tom Selleck has spent his entire career after Magnum P.I. making entertaining movies that out-of-touch critics hate and the public loves. Here is one you may have missed from director Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy, Tender Mercies). It is gently moving and amusing, with some hystericaly funny moments along the way.Tom Selleck is mystery writer Phil Blackwood and William Daniels of TV's St. Elsewhere fame is his best friend and editor Sam. Blackwood hasn't had a bestseller in some time and has been living on his reputation far too long. He needs something to break his writers block, and he may just have found it in beautiful Romanian Nina (lovely Paula Porizkova). He meets the accused murderer in court while watching trials for inspiration, and decides to become her alibi.James Farentino is the cop who knows Blackwood is lying for the lovely Nina and decides to keep an eye on things so he doesn't get killed. Once Blackwood takes Nina to the estate his Peter Swift mystery novels have paid for, he turns every situation into fodder for his fictional Peter Swift, and you'll find youself laughing hard at Selleck's voice-over as he writes.Some European thugs are after Nina, and Blackwood becomes increasingly paranoid and begins to suspect the child-like innocence of Nina may be an act. There are some hilarious moments as he begins to wonder if she's out to kill him. William Daniels as his buddy Sam gives fine comic support and  Farentino has a good role as the cop who knows these guys are in over their heads!The film is full of old-fashioned charm reminiscent of films made during the 1930's. Patrick Wayne and Tess Harper as Blackwood's very worried family add some nice moments to this entertaining film. I won't give too much away, but there is one scene that takes place after a huge dinner that will have you laughing as hard as you ever have at the movies. It is absolutely hilarious!You'll like this movie a lot, especially if you like Tom Selleck, and who doesn't? It's a lot of fun to watch and since you can pick it up so inexpensively here on Amazon there's no need to wait.

251779,ACVBZF3GK3O45,6301412710,C. Davis,"[8, 8]","Her Alibi will never be a listed as one of the top 100 movies of the century.  It will never be considered a piece of art that will change your life forever.  However, it is a great choice for a delightful way to spend a lazy afternoon or quite weekend evening with your significant other.First of all, this movie is very funny.  Tom Selleck is a bit out of his typecast as a bumbling writer.  He narrates the novel that he is writing while the film shows the experiences that inspired the writing.  The contrast between reality and fantasy is hilarious.Second, the interplay between characters is touching and witty.  One never knows what is and is not true as the story unfolds.  Yet, some scenes are both touching and insightful.  Along those lines, the scene where Tom Selleck gets a haircut is more erotic than many more graphic scenes from movies made for today's more coarse society.Finally, this reviewer finds this movie interesting, at least to this viewer, as a case study in technology use.  This movie was made in 1989 a bit before cell phones, pda's, and desk top computers become ubiquitous.  It is interesting to see how many of these tools have become so imbedded in our lives that to view folks working and living without them is almost like a trip to some ancient culture.Overall, this movie is a nice and entertaining way to spend a few leisure hours.

As many may have noted from his recent appearances on &quot;Friends&quot; Selleck has a great feel for comedy and  its timing.In this movie Selleck plays struggling mystery novelist  Phillip Blackwood. It has been some time since Blackwood has produced a hit  book and his publisher is about to drop him. Looking for inspiration  Blackwood sits in the back of a courtroom observing cases. Along comes  Nina, a Romanian woman accused of a grizzly murder. Convinced of her  innocence, Blackwood provides an alibi to the beautiful foreigner to get  her released from jail. Suddenly he realizes that he may have just released  a killer from prison and the only thing standing between her and complete  freedom is him.Selleck is hilarious as the struggling writer who begins  to write a book based on the experiences he has with the stranger now  living with him. What makes this movie truly funny is watching the usually  macho Selleck living in fear of a woman barely half his size.

I haven't seen Tom Selleck in a long time. He used to be everywhere. In any case, it was a moderately good movie, but one I wouldn't watch again.It was a strange plot. An almost burned-out writer of detective stories was pressed to come up with something new. He visited a courtroom and discovered a delightful young woman who apparently only spoke Romanian and seemed unable to defend herself against a murder charge. Selleck thought she was obviously innocent of the charge. He gave her an alibi stating that they were having an affair and that she was at his place at the critical time. Everyone was skeptical, but couldn't prove otherwise and couldn't see his motivation for telling a lie. Well, okay, remember this is Hollywood. In any case, all went moderately well until Selleck himself began to doubt that she was, in fact, innocent. Then everything gradually turned out to be misunderstood. Somehow it was clarified and everyone lived happily ever ever, or something like that. The movie was partly a mystery and partly a comedy.

I don't know how director Bruce Beresford pulled this off, but it works if you are light hearted enough to overlook some really silly moments.  Written by Charlie Peters the movie is a pretty good idea.  I admit it; part of the appeal of this film is Tom and Paulina: both are such lookers you can't ignore them.  Phillip Blackwood (Selleck) the writer is completely charmed by this remarkable beauty Nina (Porizkova). She is appearing before the judge as a murder suspect and Blackwood is browsing a courtroom for story ideas.  He also sees her as a story that just might invigorate his sagging career.  He gives her and the police an alibi and two complete strangers go to Connecticut to the Blackwood estate.  I'll admit something else.  Blackwoods mansion is a character in this story.  It is so charming it just gets into your heart.  As does Nina get into Tom's heart. But he fears her also.  After all she is a murder suspect and she shows him she is very good with a knife. As she pads around the house acting really athletic and talented Phillp begins writing.  So Blackwood is a narrator on the track for his novel of Peter Swift.  As Nina acts so Phillip writes.  Blackwood's novel of Peter Swift is really corny, macho, and bad and also very funny.  A bad tale becomes good because of the situation.  So because two mysteries are moving along at the same time we get a new look at a movie. And of course love begins and a catchy mystery unfolds.

This was a cute, light hearted romantic comedy that slid by most movie goers and critics, barely making a blip on the radar.  Still, it was a nice bit of fluff just to spend a weekend with.Tom Selleck plays a mystery writer, Phil, who is in a rut.  He hasn't had a best seller in years because he's suffering from writer's block.  Trying to find some inspiration, he sits in with a flock of elderly people watchers (courtroom groupies on Medicare, but still courtroom groupies), when he sees a beautiful woman named Nina come before the judge.  She has been charged with murder, a mysterious stranger from Romania.  In a moment of inspiration, Phil decides to provide a false alibi - saying that the two of them are having an affair and that she couldn't have killed the victim in question because she was with him when it happened.  Phil takes Nina back to his Connecticut estate, living with the mysterious stranger who only the audience knows is being watched by some European thugs in the shadows.  What will happen?  Well, it's predictable.There are some cute comedy moments, mostly in the dinner party scene and the physical comedy mishaps.  Perhaps the funniest moments are the voice overs that Tom Selleck provides as he is writing his book in his mind, making him into the tough guy he hopes he is rather than that bumbling fool he is.  Otherwise, it's just a cute story your average watcher won't read too much into.",3,It is Per ... Per ...

The ending is also a little over the top silly but it draws the story together to a nice conclusion.  Lotsa of clean humor and laughs.,4,Light Entertainment,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,253,"['enjoy', 'humor', 'comedy', 'movie', 'Selleck', 'character', 'bit', 'lame', 'story', 'more', 'acceptable', 'ending', 'also', 'little', 'top', 'silly', 'story', 'together', 'nice', 'conclusion', 'Lotsa', 'clean', 'humor', 'laughs']",N/A
