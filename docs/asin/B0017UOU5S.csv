Nickel ""SunshineBVI""","[7, 7]","I have purchased other balance ball DVDs in the past & have been mostly disappointed by the lack of variety & simplistic workouts. However, this one really delivers! This is the first balance ball workout that I have found that successfully merges a cardio routine with the more standard balanceball toning moves.There are two options - a 30 minute & 50 minute workout. While the 30 minute routine is great for days when you're short on time, the 50 minute is awesome & really gets you sweating! I was surprised at how much cardio Tanja gets in with the ball - especially working on your abs/obliques.  I love how the cardio bursts are interspersed with toning moves, which you can make more challenging by adding weights.This is a truly complete workout & a fun break from your standard fitness programs.",5,Best balanceball workout yet!,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,805,"['have', 'purchased', 'other', 'balance', 'ball', 'DVDs', 'past', 'have', 'been', 'mostly', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'variety', 'simplistic', 'workouts', 'However', 'one', 'really', 'first', 'balance', 'ball', 'have', 'found', 'successfully', 'cardio', 'routine', 'more', 'standard', 'balanceball', 'toning', 'are', 'two', 'options', '30', 'minute', '50', 'minute', 'workout', '30', 'minute', 'routine', 'great', 'days', 'when', ""'re"", 'short', 'time', '50', 'minute', 'awesome', 'really', 'sweating', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'cardio', 'Tanja', 'ball', 'especially', 'working', 'abs/obliques', 'love', 'how', 'cardio', 'bursts', 'are', 'interspersed', 'toning', 'moves', 'can', 'make', 'more', 'challenging', 'adding', 'weights.This', 'truly', 'complete', 'workout', 'fun', 'break', 'standard', 'fitness', 'programs']",N/A

Background on me--I'm overweight, and exercise on and off, so I look for workouts that are not jarring to the back or knees.Here's what I like:* The instructor: she's high energy without being screamy. She obviously loves what she's doing. She reminds me a bit of Jennifer Lopez. Her cues are right on, and she makes sure to say things like, ""just do what you can,"" or ""if you have lower back problems, do it like this..."" That's very reassuring and helpful info.* It's a fun workout! Before I got this DVD, my balance ball had been collecting dust. I didn't realize how fun it is to use it...and how challenging!* There are 2 workouts to choose from, 30 minutes and 50 minutes in length. I've been doing the 30 minute one and it's work for me to get through it.What I thought could have been improved:* There are 2 people behind her exercising along with her. At one point, late in the 30 minute workout, she says, ""if you're a beginner, follow the guys behind me.""  It confused me if they were serving as modifiers all along or just for that one exercise. It seemed to be just for that one exercise, b/c they were pretty much doing the same as she was all through the rest of the workout.* The audio. I could hear her well enough, but she was a hair overshadowed by the music. When it got to the stretching portion, then I was able to hear her just fine. It could be my DVD player or the DVD I got. Like I say, she's certainly audible, just had to turn the volume up one or 2 notches more than normal. No biggie.This is a great DVD if you want to mix up your workout. I would definitely buy another DVD by this instructor.",4,"Great instructor, beautiful scenery",1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,1687,"['just', 'got', 'Cardio', 'Burn', 'Balance', 'Ball', 'have', 'been', 'enjoying', 'Background', ""'m"", 'overweight', 'exercise', 'look', 'workouts', 'are', 'not', 'jarring', 'back', 'knees.Here', 'what', 'like', '*', 'instructor', 'high', 'energy', 'being', 'screamy', 'obviously', 'what', 'doing', 'bit', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'cues', 'are', 'right', 'sure', 'say', 'things', 'just', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'have', 'lower', 'back', 'problems', 'do', 'very', 'reassuring', 'helpful', 'info', '*', 'fun', 'workout', 'got', 'DVD', 'balance', 'ball', 'had', 'been', 'collecting', 'dust', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'fun', 'use', 'how', 'challenging', '*', 'are', '2', 'workouts', 'choose', '30', 'minutes', '50', 'minutes', 'length', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', '30', 'minute', 'one', 'work', 'get', 'it.What', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', '*', 'are', '2', 'people', 'exercising', 'one', 'point', 'late', '30', 'minute', 'workout', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'follow', 'guys', 'confused', 'were', 'serving', 'modifiers', 'along', 'just', 'one', 'exercise', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'exercise', 'b/c', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'doing', 'same', 'was', 'rest', 'workout', '*', 'audio', 'could', 'hear', 'well', 'enough', 'was', 'hair', 'overshadowed', 'music', 'When', 'got', 'stretching', 'portion', 'then', 'was', 'able', 'hear', 'just', 'fine', 'could', 'be', 'DVD', 'player', 'DVD', 'got', 'say', 'certainly', 'audible', 'just', 'had', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', 'one', '2', 'notches', 'more', 'normal', 'biggie.This', 'great', 'DVD', 'want', 'mix', 'up', 'workout', 'would', 'definitely', 'buy', 'DVD', 'instructor']",N/A

(I am tired of wasting money on workout DVD's that sound good but end up being big disappointments. If your library offers this service, I highly recommend it.) I was really impressed with this workout. Most balanceball workouts I've bought are either too easy or too short and don't allow me to feel as though I got anything out of the workout. This one really delivers. I was sweating quite a bit and could feel the fatigue setting in.

I've been doing the Tracy Mallet series and LOVE it.  I was getting a bit bored and came in search of additional ball exercise tapes and tried this one based upon reviews of this trainer having great workout DVD's.  I've only done the 30 minute section of this tape and while I did break a sweat....it is more for beginners.  Not someone who exercises regularly.  I'm used to doing ball exercises with weights (Tracy Mallet's) and doing Tanja's arm exercises without any weights didn't appear to do a thing for me.  I also thought there wasn't much cardio involved.  She has some unique ball exercises that I enjoyed and I will do this again and try the 50 minute version, but honestly, I feel like I get 3x the workout in 30 minutes with my other DVD's as I am with this one in 30.  If I have to go 50 to get the same thing, then it's probably not what I'll continue to do.  Nice scenery, non-obnoxious music and Tanja was pleasant.

So I was surprised to find a dvd that incorporates the ball into both strength training and cardio exercises.  I thought it was challenging, but not exhausting, and I definitely felt the soreness in my legs the next day.  Also, I have lower back problems and this workout really tends to focus on strengthening these muscles without causing any pain (so long as you're careful not to overdo it!)My only complaint is that the cardio segments are a bit repetitive.  Still better than jogging or using a machine, but I wish she had come up with some different movements to make the time go by a little faster.
