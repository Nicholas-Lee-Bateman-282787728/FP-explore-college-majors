Plus, don't even get me started about how excellent Kathy Bates was in this!

605814,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLSK,A Customer,"[3, 4]","Summary:Warren R. Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) has just retired from an all but illustrious career as an actuary for the Woodmen of America insurance company located in Omaha, NE (as an interesting side note, he is replaced by my cousin, Matt Winston (I)).  His life is plain, ordinary, and boring.  All he has to look forward to is watching television and going out to eat with his wife, Helen (June Squibb); at least, so he thinks.This all changes with a couple of events.  First, he decides to participate in one of those 'adopt-a-child' programs where you send them $20 a month to help feed a child in Africa.  The child he adopts is named Ndugo.  In his welcome packet he is encouraged to write Ndugo a letter, including some personal information.  Well, Warren does just that... Of course, the letter is far too personal, including a very derogatory description of his wife, with whom he is now spending all of his time.  This comes back to haunt him as his wife suddenly dies from a stroke (or aneurism, not sure which).  Throughout the movie Warren continues to write Ndugo ""Dear Ndugo"", having found someone who will listen, though Ndugo obviously has no choice in the matter.Warren's only child, Jeannie (Hope Davis (I)), who has moved to Denver, comes for the funeral wither her fianc&eacute;, Randall Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney).  Jeannie seems to be fairly normal, but Randall, well, he is almost as memorable a character as is Warren.  His mullet is second to none and his job - wow - he's a used waterbed salesman who is constantly falling for MLM/pyramid schemes.But before Warren can do something about the wedding he discovers something else - Helen had an affair.  While going through her things he finds a bunch of letters written to Helen by his best friend.  So not only has he lost his wife and best friend, but he's also lost his image of his wife being true to him.With all of these changes occurring so suddenly Warren decides that he needs take control of his life.  The most immediate way he believes he can make this manifest is by stopping his daughter's wedding.  With the wedding just a few weeks away Warren decides he'll head to Denver early, in his Winnebago, and help them get everything organized.  When he calls Jeannie to tell her he's on his way she demands that he not come yet but follow the plans already made.  Not having anything to do back in Omaha Warren decides to go on a road trip.  He visits his birthplace, museums, etc. and even ends up making a drunken pass at a woman he meets in a campground.  All of this leads him to eventually come to better terms with the loss of his wife and what he is beginning to feel is a wasted life.  With renewed vigor he heads to Denver to stop the wedding.Once he arrives he is introduced to Randall's family, in particular his mother, Roberta (Kathy Bates).  They're, well, odd to say the least, which only reinforces Warren's desire to end this wedding before it begins.  However, his desire is never realized and he ends up telling them how happy he is for them before heading back to Omaha and his new perspective on life - which seems to be just an understanding of what his old perspective was without changing his actual behavior very much.My Comments:With the summary I just wrote you may think this movie is kind of slow.  Well, it is, in a sense, and normally I would consider this a major problem with a movie.  But in this case it works perfectly.  The movie even begins with time passing - Warren staring at the clock in his office as his career officially ends and his retirement begins.  The slow passage of time is also perfect for the setting of the movie, Nebraska.  For anyone that has ever driven through Nebraska you will quickly begin to understand that time crawls in that state.  So, the slow pacing is definitely intentional, but there is so much going on otherwise that it is not a detractor.Of course, what really makes this movie remarkable are the characters.  Despite some of them only having very brief screen time, each is well-developed and definitely very unique, at least in terms of movie characters.  Which is part of the reason this movie is so appealing - the characters seem so real, almost too real.  These are just ordinary people, but the movie is cast in a light that makes the events and their responses to them extraordinary.  Everyone of the actors is superb.As for the storyline, it just gets better and better as the movie progresses.  When the movie opens you're really wondering what could happen to make this movie interesting, to make it worth watching.  After all, isn't insurance about as boring a profession as there is (no offense intended)?  And an actuary of all people?  But it works and it works very well.  Warren is beginning to realize that his life has been boring and he's just been getting along, not really taking control and making his life any more than it absolutely had to be.This leads me to the message(s).  Is there a message to the movie?  Well, I'm sure there is but it's not so blatant that you can only come away with one message.  The movie is subtle, nuanced, and because a specific message is never really defined every person that watches this film could come away with something different; which to me is the major attraction of the film.  You can read into it pretty much what you want because you aren't really sure what Warren has learned when the movie is over, but he's had plenty of opportunities to learn.Overall, this is a remarkable movie with a very simple premise.  It is complicated, but only in the details and characters.  You're never really sure what is going to happen next, but each new chapter in the movie brings with it a wave of new ideas, characters, and developments.  For a particularly enthralling commentary on life you should see this movie.",4,Jack Nicholson in a very unique role,1056240000,"06 22, 2003",2003,5834,"['Summary', 'Warren', 'R.', 'Schmidt', 'Jack',

For some, it's a wonderful set of experiences early in life that allow them to better understand themselves. For others, such as insurance actuary Warren Schmidt, it's far more bittersweet. After spending most of his life at the same firm, Schmidt retires from his job and soon has to deal with the consequences of this decision--living full-time with a domineering, shrewish wife; being replaced at work without a hitch; and preparing to give away his daughter in marriage to a hillbilly idiot. Then his wife dies unexpectedly, and while sorting out her things he discovers a painful secret that makes him question what his whole life means, and what he's accomplished. So, he hits the road to revisit some of the pivotal places of his past, such as his childhood home (now a tire shop), his old fraternity, etc. He comes to the conclusion that his life has had little meaning, that he's touched no one, and that all he has left to do is wait for death (75% chance it will happen within 9 years, he tells us). But that's not the end of the movie.About Schmidt is not for everyone. The subject matter and approach it takes simply make that true. However, the movie's final note is not melancholy, but upbeat. Some might say that it's meant to offend red-staters, but that simply isn't true--Schmidt himself is well-drawn, and although the groom's entourage are not exactly rocket scientists, Warren's Nebraska friends are pretty much average folks.Jack Nicholson earns the lion's share of credit here. Everything about Schmidt is inoffensive--even his walk is timid. Nicholson sinks himself into this performance more than many of his others, and he really becomes this guy. Under Schmidt's surface, though, is a volcano of anger and fear, and Nicholson lets us know that, too. This is probably Jack's definitive film performance.Ultimately, this is a movie that deals with questions that, sooner or later, we all must face: What have I accomplished? What does it mean to be a success? And it assures us that our impact may be beyond what we imagined.

Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","Jack Nicholson plays a man just retired who, following the unexpected death of his no longer beloved but much needed wife, finds himself unbearably lonely, desperately seeking some good reason to keep going. No longer an assistant vice-president and no longer needed 'at the office', dead wife unable to keep annoying him, best friend found to have betrayed his trust, Mr. Schmidt's last 2 chances at relevance are saving his only daughter from what he considers an about to happen bad marriage and becoming a 'step father' by sending a $22 monthly check to a charity that promises to save a Third World child from disease and poverty and letters from the lucky kid.For about 2 hours, the movie chronicles the constantly desperate, exasperated, annoyed, disappointed Schmidt who watches his all hopes at 'meaning' or 'control' evaporating while interacting with the 'normal' world of today's - consumers at home, at their leisure, interacting with one another, some searching for some meaningful interactions but mostly busy consuming 'things' and each other, sometimes in a feeding frenzy.It's a honest movie with Nicholson honestly portraying what should be a familiar archetype, Kathy Bates at his side, doing a similarly great job of a female counterpart still dreaming the dream. It should be also a hard to watch movie, especially for anyone in their mid 50's or past and probably irrelevant to the 'under 40' cohorts. Superficially, it could be watched as a mild comedy, which is probably how most viewers are going to view it.Is 'About Schmidt' worth watching? I'm not sure. It may be but potential viewers should not expect any catharsis, happy-ending, suggestions on how one could live a better life. This is a movie about 'what is' so nothing is unusual or unexpected and everything is profoundly and irrevocably depressing.

the monotony of being an old and lonely man.But if you really look at this film, you can see that by the end, our man has found some small redemption,has laid down a little bit of proof, that yes, he once existed.Once you think about it, this facet of the movie becomes clear.Jack Nicholson is brilliant in a wonderfully subdued performance.He isn't just portraying Schmidt, he really is this man.He's bitter, and alone, and realistically flawed, but in the end, entirely human, totally believable and undeniable tender.He gets excellent support from the ENTIRE cast.Every single person in this film is pitch perfect, from Hope Davis who plays Schmidt's cold and contemptuous daughter, to Kathy Bates, totally winning in a brashly humorous role.About Schmidt takes a while to understand because it doesn't give away all its meanings.But About Schmidt is a film with great meaning, and the subtle details it provides throughout make it a worthwile experience.",5,"A subtle,poignant

I'd seen some previews, but didn't know what to exactly what to expect.  The film starts out with Jack's character, Warren Schmidt, sitting at his desk at work, staring at the clock.  Interesting way to start the movie -- it was hard to tell what direction the movie was going to go in -- luckily, I thought it went in a brilliant direction.  This Dramedy is so touching and heart-wrenching -- yet happy and sarcastic at the same time.  In the theater, there were very old people, very young people -- men, women -- a very broad range of audience members.  I think most people will either love it or hate it.  It may be too ""thought-provoking"" or ""sappy"" for some.  It was a long movie (atleast it seemed that way) but you get so caught up in Schmidt's life, you don't care.  He's an unpredictable character you never know what he's going to do or say next.The ""Dear Ndugu"" scenes were sad -- on the outside he seemed to be somewhat of a cheap, irritable and blunt man -- but deep down inside you realize he's actually more sad inside and lonely than anything else.  This movie covers everything -- it's a broad spectrum of Schmidt's life within a weeks time.  Jack is great in this role.  He WAS Schmidt.  He didn't say a lot in the movie -- but he didn't have to.  His face said it all.I could have done without the hot tub scene with Kathy Bates, but maybe some comic relief was in order at that time in the movie.  The part where he goes into Dairy Queen in the beginning of the movie and orders a blizzard was interesting ... random ... he ordered a Reese's & Cookie Dough Vanilla Blizzard.  Medium.  I wonder if there was some hidden meaning in that...Some people who wrote reviews on here didn't like the ending - I did.  I don't want to give too much away so I'll just say this: About Schmidt had a lot of depth.

Jack Nicholeson gives fantastic performance as retired insurance actuary. Most of the film is Jack trying to re-discover his lost life and narrating his life through the letters to his foster son Ndugu who is somewhere in starving Africa.Jack doesn't have really good passionate relationship with his wife. Neither his wife as we later discover she was having affair with Jack's friend. We see his wife self-centered (Excellent performance by her) and Jack, a passive nice guy. He is mostly devoted to his work and finds self-actualization there. When he retires and finds his wife dead, he finds himself lonely. He tries to find solace in doing noble deeds by adopting Ndugu. He finds his daughter is marrying a unfit salesman who comes from a family which has no social manners. We feel pity when Jack tries to help his own daughter but it is too late. He didn't have  bonding with her in the past(Her mother took care of her). We find his daughter cold to her father although father has good intentions of helping her. The scene where Jack falls for a woman in the RV is very embarrasing look into loneliness.Kathy bates gives electrifying performance in her role as nymphomaniac. He short presence as foul mouthed arrogant woman is amusing. Her encounter with Jack is hilarious. I literally rolled over my bed unable to control my laugh. The nude scene in the pool was unnecessary. Jack's inablility to sleep on water-bed was very funny.It is story of man who sought only materialistic things in life, not investing in relationships and finds himself lonely towards end of his life.In a way, it is depressing to watch otherwise kind hearted well mannered man. We don't see Jack as dogmatic person but one who just doesn't have any coping skills.The films lacks a good story line but rather a midwest suburban documentary of retired man. Except for Jack, rest of the characters lack depth and story build-up. Jack's journey into his past is depressing. Even in this journey in his RV, he doesn't find a single warm hearted person who listens to him. (How often people lend a kind ear to old people anyway in real life?). We desperately feel someone will to Jack. Kathy bates did in beginning but Jack finds her abnoxious later. The film has a message to young people about to marry 'Materialism alone can't bring happiness'. Time invested in relationship with genuine care give happiness later although there are no guarantees.We see the message in the end of the movie in a drawing sent by the young boy Ngudu to Jack.

605823,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B00005JLSK,Andrew Desmond,"[1, 2]","The trailer and advertising information for ""About Schmidt"" gave me the impression that this film is a comedy.  Indeed, most retailers stock it within the comedy section of their stores.  The film, however, is not a comedy but rather a melancholic stroll through the life of Warren Schmidt played by Jack Nicholson.Schmidt is a middle manager in the Woodmen insurance company who has just retired after a long career.  He is a conservative middle class man who has become slowly bored with his wife and, for that matter, his life.  When his wife suddenly dies, his life becomes rudderless as he tries to re-establish contact with his only daughter who is about to be married to a man that Schmidt believes is beneath her.  In fact, the whole family is uncouth and dysfunctional but the daughter plans to go through with the marriage regardless.  Reluctantly, Schmidt has no alternative but accede to the marriage.Having essentially explained the plot, the film is simply a study of characters, especially Schmidt.  Nicholson plays his part well.  Why would one expect anything less?  He is truly a sad and pathetic individual but, of course, the world is filled with such souls.  Each such person playing his or her part within a greater body of humanity.The film is slow and languid with few highs.

605824,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLSK,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","Going forward with `Jack Nicholson Friday', I'm going to review a film that brought me my FAVORITE Jack Nicholson performance.  `About Schmidt' is one of those tender, genuine and sincere comedies that is so soft and subtle one may not really understand or feel the depth of its riches upon a singular viewing.  I urge you to see this again and again if you must.  This film is the definition of beautiful for me; a stellar example of tenderness and honesty that moves me every time I see it.The film revolves around Warren Schmidt, a man who seems almost all too real.  We are first introduced at the man's retirement party, and while so many seem to feel as though Warren as `lived his life to the full' you can tell that he doesn't agree.  He is at a loss, for his life has been a failure in his own eyes.  He wants to make a difference, and better late than never, so he reaches out to sponsor a Tanzanian child named Ndugu.  Using this as an opportunity to vent his frustrations, Warren takes the time to write a letter detailing his concerns with his life and those who dwell within it.  When Warren makes his way home from mailing this letter though, his life is turned on its head.  His wife (the very one he was complaining about) has died.At that moment (which brought with it some scarring revelations) Warren decided to really connect with himself, and on his journey to make his daughter's wedding, Warren does just that.  He finds who he really is, who he's always wanted to be and who he's destined to become.For me, this film is carried magnificently on Jack Nicholson's shoulders.  I often tell my friends that this is the best Jack Nicholson performance where Jack isn't playing Jack (`The Shining' is most definitely the `Jack playing Jack' performance that trumps all others).  There is no part of Warren that calls to mind anything we've ever seen Nicholson do before.  He effortlessly sheds his own skin, his own persona, and becomes Warren.  There is such softness and downtrodden misery in his eyes; a desperateness that is too tired to manifest itself.  I love that about Nicholson here, for he really appears defeated; a quality that never really enveloped his prior performances.  There is such depth to his development, truly layering Warren with identifiable and honest emotions.Oh, and can I just add that this is probably the best use of voiceover narration in any film I've seen!As wonderful as Nicholson was, I have to really commend the film as a whole.  This is a beautiful `coming of age story' that proves that you are never too old to `come of age'.  As you watch Warren start to identify himself, to really see himself for the first time (through others eyes as well as his own) you can feel the warmth that comes from understanding who you are what you need to do to become who you want to be.  The script is so fluent and so sincere (and the side-plots never feel like a distraction, which is appreciated).  This is all part of Warren's journey, and we are so blessed to be a part of it.As most of you know (if you read my reviews regularly), I am an emotional guy.  I do tend to cry a lot when watching movies (my wife is always ragging on me about that).  This was no exception.  During the final frames, when Warren is staring at the painting from Ndugu, I lost it.  You can feel the swelling emotions etched on Nicholson's face and you feel everything he feels.I love Adrian Brody's performance in `The Pianist', but there is no doubt in my mind that the Oscar should have gone to Nicholson that night!",5,About life...,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,3547,"['Going', 'forward', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Friday', ""'m"", 'going', 'review', 'film', 'brought', 'FAVORITE', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'Schmidt', 'one', 'tender', 'genuine', 'sincere', 'comedies', 'so', 'soft', 'subtle', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'really', 'understand', 'feel', 'depth', 'riches', 'singular', 'viewing', 'urge', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'must', 'film', 'definition', 'beautiful', 'stellar', 'example', 'tenderness', 'honesty', 'time', 'see', 'it.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'man', 'who', 'almost', 'too', 'real', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'man', 'retirement', 'party', 'so', 'many', 'seem', 'feel', 'though', 'Warren', 'lived', 'life', 'full', 'can', 'tell', ""n't"", 'agree', 'loss', 'life', 'been', 'failure', 'own', 'eyes', 'make', 'difference', 'better', 'late', 'never', 'out', 'sponsor', 'Tanzanian', 'child', 'named', 'Ndugu', 'Using', 'opportunity', 'vent', 'frustrations', 'Warren', 'time', 'write', 'letter', 'detailing', 'concerns', 'life', 'who', 'dwell', 'When', 'Warren', 'way', 'home', 'mailing', 'letter', 'life', 'turned', 'head', 'wife', 'very', 'one', 'was', 'complaining', 'about', 'died.At', 'moment', 'brought', 'scarring', 'revelations', 'Warren', 'decided', 'really', 'connect', 'journey', 'make', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Warren', 'just', 'who', 'really', 'who', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'who', 'destined', 'become.For', 'film', 'carried', 'magnificently', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'shoulders', 'often', 'tell', 'friends', 'best', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'where', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'playing', 'Jack', 'Shining', 'most', 'definitely', 'Jack', 'playing', 'Jack', 'performance', 'others', 'part', 'Warren', 'mind', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Nicholson', 'do', 'before', 'effortlessly', 'own', 'skin', 'own', 'persona', 'Warren', 'such', 'softness', 'downtrodden', 'misery', 'eyes', 'desperateness', 'too', 'tired', 'manifest', 'love', 'Nicholson', 'here', 'really', 'defeated', 'quality', 'never', 'really', 'enveloped', 'prior', 'performances', 'such', 'depth', 'development', 'truly', 'layering', 'Warren', 'identifiable', 'honest', 'emotions.Oh', 'can', 'just', 'add', 'probably', 'best', 'use', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'As', 'wonderful', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'have', 'really', 'commend', 'film', 'whole', 'beautiful', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'are', 'never', 'too', 'old', 'come', 'age', 'watch', 'Warren', 'start', 'identify', 'really', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'others', 'eyes', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'can', 'feel', 'warmth', 'understanding', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'need', 'do', 'become', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'script', 'so', 'fluent', 'so', 'sincere', 'side-plots', 'never', 'feel', 'distraction', 'appreciated', 'part', 'Warren', 'journey', 'are', 'so', 'blessed', 'be', 'part', 'it.As', 'most', 'know', 'read', 'reviews', 'regularly', 'am', 'emotional', 'guy', 'do', 'tend', 'cry', 'lot', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'wife', 'always', 'ragging', 'was', 'exception', 'final', 'frames', 'when', 'Warren', 'staring', 'painting', 'Ndugu', 'lost', 'can', 'feel', 'swelling', 'emotions', 'etched', 'Nicholson', 'face', 'feel', 'everything', 'love', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'performance', 'Pianist', 'doubt', 'mind', 'Oscar', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'Nicholson', 'night']",N/A
605825,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005JLSK,Andy Orrock,"[2, 3]","Alexander Payne made a good movie here.  It's unfortunate that it in no way resembles the movie featured in any of the advertising or the widely-seen trailer.As with other Payne fare, 'Schmidt' does qualify as a comedy.  It's just very, very, very black.  But there's also death, depression, deep divisions between father and daughter, and other issues of serious import.The trailer skips around all that stuff to preview what would appear to be a loopy comedy.  It takes the 5 minutes or so of Jack Nicholson's impressive physical comedy skills and strings them together to present what appears to be a light-hearted look at a misfit family.  Did Payne have any say at all over the content of the trailer?  He had to be disappointed with that.At the show I went to, I heard a number of comments on the way along the lines of ""feeling duped.""  Payne delivers some stark, unadorned lessons in the film and because you're not expecting them, it feels like a gut punch...without being given a chance to tighten your stomach muscles.Two good things worth noting about 'Schmidt':- Nicholson's ""Dear Ndugu"" letters to his African 'sponsored child'.

Shane ""dresh""","[1, 1]","It takes about 1 second for Jack Nicholson to elicit the first laugh in Alexander Panyne's About Schmidt, and to remind us why he's one of film's all-time greats. Nicholson's ability to emote enormous amounts of information without saying a word is one of the central tools Payne uses to tell his story; and it's one hell of a powerful tool. Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt, an Omaha actuary who, upon retirement finds himself in an existential crisis. Essentially, the film is about the meaning of one man's life; it's a tough subject matter and one that Payne and Nicholson handle confidently and effectively.At the age of 65, Warren Schmidt finds himself with nothing to do but write hilariously overly detailed letters to his African foster kid, Ndugu. When his overbearing wife of 42 years dies suddenly, Schmidt decides to take a cross-country trip on the way to his daughter's wedding. Warren doesn't really have a good idea of what he's looking for on his journey and the trip itself is less than exciting (like Schmidt himself). But watching Nicholson inhabit this drab little man is a wonder. When he does eventually arrive in Denver and meets his future in-laws, the film becomes relentlessly hilarious. Kathy Bates is brilliant as the boozy ""free-spirited"" mom of Dermot Mulroney (giving a great little performance himself), Schmidt's dimwitted future son-in-law. And Howard Hesseman - due for a comeback - is very funny as an overly laid back aging hippy. But it's always Nicholson's reactions to these characters that really brings out the comedy here... and the pathos as well.About Schmidt is not a perfect film. The pacing is slower than it should have been and the first two acts drag on a bit too long. Frankly, without Nicholson's high-wattage brilliance, none of this would have been nearly as effective as it is. But with all the pieces where they are, About Schmidt succeeds more often than it fails and, in the end, presents one man's quest for meaning as both funny and surprisingly moving.",4,ABOUT SCHMIDT - The last GREAT Nicholson performance,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,2014,"['1', 'second', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'elicit', 'first', 'laugh', 'Alexander', 'Panyne', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'remind', 'why', 'one', 'film', 'all-time', 'greats', 'Nicholson', 'ability', 'emote', 'enormous', 'amounts', 'information', 'saying', 'word', 'one', 'central', 'tools', 'Payne', 'tell', 'story', 'one', 'hell', 'powerful', 'tool', 'Nicholson', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'Omaha', 'actuary', 'who', 'retirement', 'existential', 'crisis', 'Essentially', 'film', 'meaning', 'one', 'man', 'life', 'tough', 'subject', 'matter', 'one', 'Payne', 'Nicholson', 'handle', 'confidently', 'effectively.At', 'age', '65', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'nothing', 'do', 'write', 'hilariously', 'overly', 'detailed', 'letters', 'African', 'foster', 'kid', 'Ndugu', 'When', 'overbearing', 'wife', '42', 'years', 'suddenly', 'Schmidt', 'take', 'cross-country', 'trip', 'way', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Warren', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'looking', 'journey', 'trip', 'less', 'exciting', 'Schmidt', 'watching', 'Nicholson', 'inhabit', 'drab', 'little', 'man', 'wonder', 'When', 'eventually', 'arrive', 'Denver', 'future', 'in-laws', 'film', 'relentlessly', 'hilarious', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'brilliant', 'boozy', 'free-spirited', 'mom', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'giving', 'great', 'little', 'performance', 'Schmidt', 'dimwitted', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'Howard', 'Hesseman', 'due', 'comeback', 'very', 'funny', 'overly', 'laid', 'back', 'aging', 'hippy', 'always', 'Nicholson', 'reactions', 'characters', 'really', 'out', 'comedy', 'here', 'pathos', 'well.About', 'Schmidt', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'pacing', 'slower', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'drag', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'Frankly', 'Nicholson', 'high-wattage', 'brilliance', 'none', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'as', 'effective', 'pieces', 'where', 'are', 'Schmidt', 'more', 'often', 'end', 'one', 'man', 'quest', 'meaning', 'funny', 'surprisingly', 'moving']",N/A

The movies of Alexander Payne are very tongue-in-cheek.  He challenges those who watch his films.

Thing is, I found the ending incredibly uplifting and very redeeming.  I would easily rate it as one of the all-time great movie endings.  Nicholson really does give his best performance.  Kathy Bates is good (and brave to bare all).  The script, score, photography are all tops.  And the deliberately slow-pacing enhances the movie.  Ignore the negative reviews, go in with an open mind, and I guarantee you'll be moved by the ending.  As for the DVD, there's little here for special features (a director's commentary would be nice).  Just a handful of trailers, a (tongue-in-cheek) exercise for Paynes photographers and editors using Omaha's Woodman Tower, and a mass of deleted scenes that were all so good it's unfortunate they had to be cut.

Starting with the first half, it's probably the most perfect piece work I could've asked for. The setting is serene, calming, and settling; a refreshing change of scenery, considering the junk I've seen through many films that fail to comprehend the meaning of the idea what a film is supposed to be about. About Schmidt is relaxing, and quite enjoyable in the first half. Then, the second half came...I was mildly disappointed, if not disgusted. It was like the director wanted to spoil my mood, therefore my day. I just didn't like the feel of grossness and the perverseness, and I thought that was mainly for shock factor. It's disappointing. After that part got over with, seeing Warren Schmidt give a toast during the post-wedding celebration, I expected him to blurt out his true feelings but didn't. Actually, him lying through his teeth made that toast speech comical, to me, anyway. How About Schmidt ended is nothing short of impressive. I rather want to think of About Schmidt in full rather than dwell on parts, and I enjoyed the film a lot. Taking About Schmidt at face value, I probably relate to Warren Schmidt a lot and not so with everybody else. Masking his personal past is probably what makes About Schmidt so intriguing because there is a lot about Warren I don't know but can try to form my own conjectures. Speaking of performances, all of the players exhibited realism as I would anticipate in real life, and they were all outstanding. Jack Nicholson may have given one of the very best performances in his life; and that role was meant for him. Truly a remarkable film with outstanding performances, About Schmidt is an unforgettable piece of work. Mind you, About Schmidt was advertised as a comedy movie; sorry, I viewed the movie as a drama bit. This one made me laugh as I read this off on IMDB of About Schmidt. It reads as, ""When Jack Nicholson received the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama, he commented afterwards, `I'm a little surprised. I thought we had made a comedy.'"" Although not meant to be the next Death of a Salesman, About Schmidt was moving and touching portrait of the worthlessness of a man's life after a certain reflection of himself. Two unique things came out of About Schmidt. One was the sponsor of Childreach, an organization urging people to donate money to sufferers of third world countries. Because of this, I may seriously consider in doing that someday in future. Two is the showing of Warren Schmidt, getting incredibly stiff in the neck. Now, this is the first time I've seen this problem occur for a film. This happened to me once when I used to be a wrestler in my childhood days. Wrestling practices occurred nightly for me, and one night, I didn't feel fatigue or stiffness in my body. The next morning, I woke up (it was actually the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor) and found my neck unable to move. It was like as if my view was severely restricted to ninety degrees away from the usual position to the right. I couldn't even move back to the original position until few days later. The greatest dilemma of this ordeal was trying to sleep at nights, and I only could sleep in one exact position on bed.

605831,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JLSK,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[5, 6]","Lately Jack Nicholson seems to be developing a penchant for examining and exploring what the process of growing older means, and what the pitfalls and life-experiences associated with the process are likely to be. A few years ago, in a film noire about a retiring police detective entitled ""The Pledge"", Nicholson played an obsessive career detective whose life was his job, and his inability to let go leads to dismal results all around in a cycle of self-destructive behavior that is both tragic and yet avoidable, were he only to change his perceptions and let go of his obsessions.  Here Nicholson take son the role of feckless Warren Schmidt, a self-absorbed executive of an insurance firm who plans to reach for the gusto of retirement and yet has such unrealistic ideas about what it portends that he has no clue what lies before him.As quickly as he retires, the cycle of unintended events and circumstances begin to rip all of his facile and delusional ideas about his world and his place in it to shreds. His wife dies, and in so doing leads him to discoveries about her, his best friend, who had been ""servicing"" the wife in intimate ways for some time, and hiss daughter, all of which force him into a sort of self-examination about himself and all his assumptions that he otherwise might never have recognized. Still, the process as presented here is both tragic and very funny, and he attempts to make some sense out of this madcap set of circumstance, trying to use his old methods of perception that just help at all.And whether it is in coping with the loss of his wife's death, the realization that he had been systematically cuckolded by his best friend, or the belated recognition that his relationship with his daughter is perfunctory at best, Nicholson uses all of his cinematic presence to enchant us with his responses. Perhaps the most hilarious scenes involve Nicholson trying to understand and cope in some fashion with Kathy bates, playing his new son-in-law to be's mother, an unattached, free-thinking, sensuous, and horny earth Mother of a woman who wants to get down and dirty in the hot tub with the now free and footloose Warren. Needless to say, Ms. Bates comes as close as anyone can to stealing the scenes away from our boy Jack.In its essence, like the character Nicholson plays in ""The Pledge"", this is an extended character study which here meaningfully and quite much more humorously examines the life that up until now Schmidt has so scrupulously avoided doing. In this voyage toward the possibility of discovery and growth, Schmidt is not faring so well. Yet the end leaves one hope, and the film is an evocative and thought-provoking way of stirring us into a little look into our own presumptions and way of living. This is a film I can heartily recommend, especially for viewers old enough to see the possibilities our poor Mr. Schmidt is trying so desperately to avert his eyes from.

605832,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,B00005JLSK,Barry C. Chow,"[2, 2]","This film works only because of Jack Nicholson, but work it does, and well. The plot has been well summarized in other reviews, though this movie is not remotely about plot. It is really about Thoreau's thesis that ""the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation"", and how that desperation is internalized in modern society until it consumes us from the inside and turns us into hollow husks.The genius of the film is in its choice of Nicholson to play Schmidt. Jack Nicholson is a man who has never lived life quietly. Even at his most desperate, he has not gone about it quietly. Whether playing McMurphy in Cuckoo's Nest, Bobby Dupea in Five Easy Pieces, or even the Joker in Batman, his response to life's iniquities has been a finger held high in both hands. The key to his effectiveness as Schmidt is our very knowledge of his past roles. We keep expecting him to break out of his morass and puncture the stupid people around him with one of his devastating bon mots. What we get instead is a perfectly pitched performance that is played true to character.There is an honesty about this film that is refreshing coming as it does from the Hollywood mill. Schmidt is first shown to us as a pathetic middle manager literally counting down the seconds to his retirement. The retirement dinner speeches are carefully divided between the platitudes of his successor and the bitter but heartfelt tribute of his best friend. Later, this same best friend seems more devastated by the loss of Schmidt's wife than Schmidt, and the reason comes as a revelation in a later scene. The daughter is another character that hews closely to life. She seems bitter and remote, hardly the golden girl of her father's reminiscences and undeserving of the love he feels for her, until we see the way he tries to manipulate her after the funeral and then a confrontation before her wedding when she throws in his face his belated and ill-timed interest in her life. Every step of the way, our sympathy for this man is tempered by an understanding of the ways he has failed himself and those around him.Schmidt grows over the course of this film, but not in the usual Hollywood fashion. He has been a quietly desperate man for so long he cannot remember otherwise, and his growth is one befitting such a man. He finds it within himself to forgive, first others, then himself. He grows from quiet desperation to quiet acceptance--perhaps all that can be expected of a man who has waited too long and wasted too much of life. And when he fails to dissuade his daughter from going through with her marriage to ""this nincompoop"" whom he despises, he stumbles upon his epiphany. This is where the past personas of Jack Nicholson loom before us. With the eyes of the wedding party all turned to him, with the chance to tell them what he really thinks, with us half anticipating, half bracing for a classic Nicholson barb, he stands up, looks them in the eyes, and gives his daughter the only gift he has left to give: a moment of pure joy.""About Schmidt"" is the antithesis of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and Warren Schmidt is the man George Bailey would have been had he worked in the real world.

Playing Warren Schmidt, Nicholson is subdued, the most subtle and calm we'll likely ever see him, and his portrayal of a sad man who retires only to find that his humdrum life means nothing is so dead-on it reminds you of your simple, just-plain-nice uncle who pinches pennies and did decently well at an office job.Warren Schmidt's life as a boring, retired widower is so sad, though we laugh at how he tries to redefine himself in old age by jumping in his Winnebago, nudges himself into his daughter's life and ""adopts"" a Ugandan refugee boy named Ndugu. As he ""rebels,"" the audience isn't really given a hero to root for, though. Payne has fashioned ""About Schmidt"" as a cautionary tale, urging audience members to make more out of their lives than Warren has. At this point in his life, though he has his moments, Warren is largely useless and remains as such throughout the film.Though Kathy Bates' performance as the hippie divorcee Roberta is remarkable, much of the cast seems to come onto the film's landscape for only a moment and then disappear.Though her early scenes with Nicholson are good, Hope Davis' best moment in the film is when she serves as a sight gag, in the world's worst wedding dress, rather than by showing depth as Warren's daughter. Because the life she's chosen is a big, elaborate joke on class, as well, it's hard to place sympathies with her. And Dermot Mulroney suffers the same fate.Compared to the superior ""Election,"" ""About Schmidt"" is too much of a downer, despite excellence from Nicholson and occasional zingers in the screenplay.It's more of a drama than a comedy when it comes down to it, for Warren's life makes me laugh more than cry.",4,"Great Nicholson, great Bates.

The answers don't get easier as one gets older.  Doors that were open in the past aren't necessarily open now.  People that were at once receptive might no longer seem to care.  And you might find yourself truly alone in the world.  More alone than you were the day you were born (at least then you had your mother near).  While it seems hopelessly &quot;modern&quot; and self-absorbed, you can't but help think about these kinds of things because sometimes your mind puts those ideas and feelings into your head and you can't ignore them.  I guess that's why some people turn to vices, because you can't run from yourself.Anyway, to watch this character wait until he's 66--when he is truly and finally alone in the world--to deal with these emotions is a pretty rough ride.  The movie was promoted as something of a comedy--and it does have a sharp sense of humor throughout--but ultimately it is quite sad in its reality.  It's not exactly bleak, as some say, but its truth hurts.Jack Nicholson almost looks and sounds like a totally different person in this movie.  I think a big part of that is due to his weight gain.  I don't know if he put on the pounds for that role, or if that's how he is now (he looked thinner in previews for &quot;Anger Management&quot;), but he's practically unrecognizable.  He doesn't even resort to any usual Jack tricks or traits.  It's a very controlled performance, but not to the point to reducing the character to a deadened automaton.  I was afraid at the beginning that he was going to do just that, but at the movie unfolds so does his character's conscience.  It's really a perfect piece of acting, though you have to put aside the fact that Jack Nicholson himself--the most celebrated actor of his generation, who is STILL the epitome of cool, and who dates twentysomething Hollywood actresses while he's in his 60s--probably doesn't have to deal with feelings of being ordinary and disposable.  Not that he doesn't have his problems, but I doubt that he has ever felt like this character these past 35 years.  But put that aside and I think you'll find an interesting character inside what many people in the real world consider a dull straight white male.As for the rest of the cast, most of it is very good except for Dermot Mulroney.  He is a caricature and nothing more.  Kathy Bates is a hoot in a small yet significant role.Take a lesson from this ordinary man.  Take stock now, but keep moving forward with your life.  Unless you're Jack Nicholson, more and more opportunities escape you year after year.  Keep your list of regrets as short as you can.",5,Very moving if you are in the right state of mind,1059091200,"07 25, 2003",2003,2775,"['Which', 'was', ""'m"", 'only', '32', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'almost', 'time', 'find', 'occasionally', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where/how', 'fit', 'modern', 'society', 'answers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'easier', 'one', 'older', 'Doors', 'were', 'open', 'past', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'open', 'now', 'People', 'were', 'once', 'receptive', 'might', 'no', 'longer', 'seem', 'care', 'might', 'find', 'truly', 'alone', 'world', 'More', 'alone', 'were', 'day', 'were', 'born', 'least', 'then', 'had', 'mother', 'hopelessly', 'quot', 'modern', 'quot', 'self-absorbed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'kinds', 'things', 'sometimes', 'mind', 'ideas', 'feelings', 'head', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'guess', 'why', 'people', 'turn', 'vices', 'ca', ""n't"", 'run', 'yourself.Anyway', 'watch', 'character', 'wait', '66', 'when', 'truly', 'finally', 'alone', 'world', 'deal', 'emotions', 'pretty', 'rough', 'ride', 'movie', 'was', 'promoted', 'something', 'comedy', 'have', 'sharp', 'sense', 'humor', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'sad', 'reality', 'not', 'exactly', 'bleak', 'say', 'truth', 'hurts.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'almost', 'totally', 'different', 'person', 'movie', 'think', 'big', 'part', 'due', 'weight', 'gain', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'put', 'pounds', 'role', 'how', 'now', 'looked', 'thinner', 'previews', 'quot', 'Anger', 'Management', 'quot', 'practically', 'unrecognizable', ""n't"", 'even', 'resort', 'usual', 'Jack', 'tricks', 'traits', 'very', 'controlled', 'performance', 'not', 'point', 'reducing', 'character', 'deadened', 'automaton', 'was', 'afraid', 'beginning', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'just', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'so', 'character', 'conscience', 'really', 'perfect', 'piece', 'acting', 'have', 'put', 'aside', 'fact', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'most', 'celebrated', 'actor', 'generation', 'who', 'STILL', 'epitome', 'cool', 'who', 'twentysomething', 'Hollywood', 'actresses', '60s', 'probably', ""n't"", 'have', 'deal', 'feelings', 'being', 'ordinary', 'disposable', 'Not', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'doubt', 'ever', 'felt', 'character', '35', 'years', 'put', 'aside', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'interesting', 'character', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'consider', 'dull', 'straight', 'white', 'male.As', 'rest', 'cast', 'most', 'very', 'good', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'caricature', 'nothing', 'more', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'hoot', 'small', 'yet', 'significant', 'role.Take', 'lesson', 'ordinary', 'man', 'Take', 'stock', 'now', 'keep', 'moving', 'forward', 'life', ""'re"", 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'more', 'more', 'opportunities', 'escape', 'year', 'year', 'Keep', 'list', 'regrets', 'as', 'short', 'can']",N/A

I had previously seen Payne's feature Election, which is one of my favorite dark comedies of all time and the previews made this look like a followup. But what the movie ended up being was more thought provoking and less self-consciously hip than I was expecting and it was a welcome change.Payne's movie, loosely based on a book of the same name, examines the life of a newly retired and widowed insurance salesman from Omaha, who goes on a roadtrip to his daughter's wedding in Denver with vague plans of stopping it. On his way he bares his soul in a series of letters to an orphaned African child he sponsors through a relief organization. The movie tackles major themes, the ambivalence of grief, the search for purpose in an otherwise drab existence, and the baggage that families carry on from generation to generation. Yet it handles all of this with a light touch. The ""message"" of the movie is never overbearing. It is suggested rather than stated, aiming for nuance rather than typical Hollywood preaching. And as such, the message is much more potent. The final scene takes it all to a whole new level, redefining what true meaning in life actually is.The script does have some bumps. It takes a long time for things to get going...and the early parts of the road trip meander just a bit. The movie could have been better with some judicious editing. But on the whole it is quite well done.The performance from Jack Nicholson is superb. All of the familiar Nicholson cliches are in place (the smirk, the shifty eyes, the mumbling sneery voice) and yet they add up to more than the sum of their parts. Nicholson's Schmidt is a creature of contradictions, externally controlled and yet inwardly sad and lonely...even before his wife dies he has this hole in him. And there is a core of anger that never quite bubbles to the surface. These conflicting layers are held in tension and keep Nicholson's portrayal from sinking into caricature. You feel the humanity of the character, and, unlike Election, you feel a warmth and compassion for him. Supporting roles are also quite good. Kathy Bates stands out as an aging 60's earth mother with baggage of her own. I am particularly amazed at the actress' lack of self-consciousness in appearing briefly nude in the role. Dermot Mulroney manages to be both dimwitted and oddly appealing as Schmidt's future son-in-law. Hope Davis is extremely good as Schmidt's daughter. She manages to play the hysterical bride-to-be without lapsing into stereotype.All in all, this is a movie well worth seeing, albeit with a few flaws. But in a season that has given us National Security and Kangaroo Jack, this is a movie that treats the audience with respect and intelligence, and there's lots to be said for that.",4,Thought Provoking,1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,2841,"['went', 'movie', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'expecting', 'sardonic', 'laugh', 'fest', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'Payne', 'feature', 'Election', 'one', 'favorite', 'dark', 'comedies', 'time', 'previews', 'made', 'look', 'followup', 'what', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'was', 'more', 'thought', 'provoking', 'less', 'self-consciously', 'hip', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'welcome', 'change.Payne', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'life', 'newly', 'retired', 'widowed', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'Omaha', 'who', 'roadtrip', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Denver', 'vague', 'plans', 'stopping', 'way', 'soul', 'series', 'letters', 'orphaned', 'African', 'child', 'relief', 'organization', 'movie', 'major', 'themes', 'ambivalence', 'grief', 'search', 'purpose', 'otherwise', 'drab', 'existence', 'baggage', 'families', 'carry', 'generation', 'generation', 'light', 'touch', 'message', 'movie', 'never', 'overbearing', 'suggested', 'rather', 'stated', 'aiming', 'nuance', 'rather', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'preaching', 'such', 'message', 'much', 'more', 'potent', 'final', 'scene', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'redefining', 'what', 'true', 'meaning', 'life', 'actually', 'is.The', 'script', 'have', 'bumps', 'long', 'time', 'things', 'get', 'going', 'early', 'parts', 'road', 'trip', 'meander', 'just', 'bit', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'judicious', 'editing', 'whole', 'quite', 'well', 'done.The', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'superb', 'familiar', 'Nicholson', 'cliches', 'are', 'place', 'smirk', 'shifty', 'eyes', 'mumbling', 'sneery', 'voice', 'yet', 'add', 'up', 'more', 'sum', 'parts', 'Nicholson', 'Schmidt', 'creature', 'contradictions', 'externally', 'controlled', 'yet', 'inwardly', 'sad', 'lonely', 'even', 'wife', 'hole', 'core', 'anger', 'never', 'quite', 'bubbles', 'surface', 'conflicting', 'layers', 'are', 'held', 'tension', 'keep', 'Nicholson', 'portrayal', 'sinking', 'caricature', 'feel', 'humanity', 'character', 'Election', 'feel', 'warmth', 'compassion', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'out', 'aging', '60', 'earth', 'mother', 'baggage', 'own', 'am', 'particularly', 'amazed', 'actress', 'lack', 'self-consciousness', 'appearing', 'briefly', 'nude', 'role', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'be', 'dimwitted', 'oddly', 'appealing', 'Schmidt', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'extremely', 'good', 'Schmidt', 'daughter', 'play', 'hysterical', 'bride-to-be', 'lapsing', 'stereotype.All', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'few', 'flaws', 'season', 'given', 'National', 'Security', 'Kangaroo', 'Jack', 'movie', 'audience', 'respect', 'intelligence', 'lots', 'be', 'said']",N/A

His regimented life, shaped by his henpecking wife is inexorably altered by his retirement.  He gets thrown into further turmoil when returning home from running some errands he discovers that his wife has dropped dead.  Nicholson's only daughter played by Hope Davis arrives from out of town for the funeral with her morally bereft loser of a fiance played nicely by Dermot Mulroney.  Her upcoming betrothal is one strongly disapproved by Nicholson and a cause of friction between them.  They soon leave and Nicholson is left to fend for himself.Nicholson commences passing his time aimlessly.  While cleaning out his wife's possessions, he discovers love letters documenting an adulterous affair with his best friend. He is crushed and sees his very existence as an abject failure.  He has in his loneliness adopted an underprivileged foster child in a third world country through a televison ad.  He writes to the 6 year old child using a diary format sprinkled with some highly inappropriate verbiage.He decides to take a road trip in a large camper on his way to his daughter's wedding.  Upon his arrival in Colorado, he meets and stays with his future son in law's dysfunctional family headed by the terrific Kathy Bates.  Despite his objections, the wedding goes on without a hitch, highlighted by Nicholson's toast.  By this time, Nicholson is totlly crestfallen, convinced that his life has no meaning.His return home is met by the arrival of a letter from his foster child that reveals to him the true meaning of life, an absolutely wonderful ending to the movie.Nicholson richly deserves an Oscar for his performance but might get snubbed because his collection of statues is vast already.

Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[2, 2]","About Schmidt (2002) directed by Alexander PayneBased on a novel by Louis Bigley (written by Jim Taylor)About just as expected: a good performance by a resurgent Jack Nicholson, who had been in dumps as of late, with an occasional appearance in the front seat of a Lakers game. Here he comes to life as a crusty, relatively uninformed about life, leading a meaningless existence upon retirement. He is unable to connect with his nearest relatives, or anyone else. Not that he is stupid or lacking common sense; but he is clueless as to what a real relationship is about. His daughter is alienated, his son in law a luckless waterbed salesman who's trying to draw money from him for a pyramid scheme, and his wife slaves away like a domestic and soon dies of a blood clot. Schmidt's only connection to humanity is an adoption (by mail) of child from Tasmania, whose sponsor he becomes, sending him $22 (to adopt a child) campaign. He writes him passionate letters, opening his heart to him-as to an abstract confessor-but the real Schmidt is there. When his wife dies, he takes off in his Winnebago (which she had bought by selling her stock), and drives from Omaha to Colorado, to be present at his daughter's wedding-which he disapproves. There he is welcomed by the bridegroom's mother, who first invites him to have a Manhattan with her, and then reveals that she had her first orgasm at six; she later invites him to ""relax"" in her hot bathtub and readily jumps in herself, without a stitch of clothes on her.Despite his revulsion, Schmidt stays for the wedding, and gives a flattering to his audience speech as the guest of honor; then finds solace on his return trip home reading a letter from the boy's ward in Africa, telling how the six year old appreciated his help and made a drawing for him-which she encloses. It is a childish drawing of two persons holding hands. Story ends.Jack Nicholson gives a nuanced portrait of a man, not unintelligent, or ""bad,"" but one who is lost in a world of isolation, most of which he has created for himself. His self defense is principally the defense of his money from his daughter, to whom he has given little affection (though he was ""proud"" of her), and his future son in law, whom he calls a ""nincompoop,"" and from his friends at parties, who describe him as ""rich,"" a title he does not crave, for he lives modestly. He is constantly surprised when he yields and tries a relationship that has some meaning. While he travels, for instance, he meets a fellow traveler at a trailer park who invites him for dinner and Schmidt mistakes his wife's pity (""you look sad"") for passion and kisses her. Schmidt seems anchorless, amid a humanity he does not understand, mistaking a friendly welcome for real merit, and being constantly frustrated. Friends are nonexistent, relatives are repellent, new acquaintances flee, he is an ""island"" onto himself, rudderless-despite his skill in driving the Winnebago-but not without heart, or brain (after all he made money). He still sends checks to his failed daughter, and puts up a bright face to congratulate his worthless son in law. He is an example of modern alienation, but a letter from a young stranger, an irony of sorts, brings him into contact with life which he craved and never found.

The average anybody can succeed in gaining the nod of approval from family and society for comforming for the sake of security and creature comforts, only to end up coming to grips with the lack of any true sense of connection or fulfillment.  It's about real 'real' persons who might fail to reflect very much on what in life is the most meaningful until forced to do so near the end of the road.

605853,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JLSK,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[4, 5]","I've been a huge fan of Jack Nicholson for a while now and after watching `About Schmidt' I'm tempted to right the role of Warren Schmidt off as his greatest creation to date.  Laced with restrained humor and everyman humanity, Warren Schmidt come across as the guy everyone knows, the man everyone loves and the one who's always been taken for granted.  It's funny to me that while this movie progressed to the end where Warren is supposed to learn this big life lesson I couldn't help but rationalize and or relate to him, feeling that everyone around him was actually in need of the life lesson he was so inevitably searching for himself.Warren is a man who feels as though he's accomplished nothing with his life.  You first get this feeling while he's being saluted at his retirement party.  He sits with this faux smile while his supposed best friend rants on and on about knowing you've lived your life to make a difference, and in Warren's eyes you can see he feels he's failed.  It's soon after this that Warren decides to try and make a difference, and he does this by sponsoring a Tanzanian child named Ndugu.  Through his letters to Ndugu, Warren is able to finally vent about everything he hates in his life, from his retirement to his wife to his daughter Jeannie's (Hope Davis) decision to marry a complete idiot by the name of Randall Hertzal (Dermot Mulroney in a priceless role).  It's when Warren returns home from mailing Ndugu's first letter that his life is forever changed.Warren returns to find his wife Helen (June Squibb) dead on the floor.  This one moment catapults Warren into a journey to find meaning in himself and in his life.  He sets off to make his daughters wedding in the motor home he purchased at request of his late wife.  On the way he sees many different things and meets many different people, some of which include the Rusk's (Harry Groener and Connie Ray in a great cameo scene) but in the end it's himself who he finds.  When he reaches his daughter a few days before the wedding he has trouble connecting with his new family and this causes him to clash almost ferociously with his daughter.  Warren soon realizes that he hasn't been the easiest man to love and this has had lasting effects on his relationships with those closest to him.  In the end Warren is able to make peace, not only with those in his life but, more importantly, with himself.During the final frames, as Warren reads a letter back from Ndugu I found myself crying with Warren.  This film has had such a lasting impression on me, an impression I didn't expect to have when I first sat down to watch.  Thanks in large part to Nicholson, but also to smaller roles by Kathy Bates (whose priceless as Randall's crazy mother Roberta) and of course Mulroney, `About Schmidt' has instantly become one of my favorite Nicholson films to date, and maybe even one of my favorite films, period.  Like with `Sideways', Alexander Payne as infused enough humor, dry and outlandish, drama and sentimentality into this script to constitute this an all around well rounded and complete film.  `About Schmidt' is well deserving of all it's praise and should occupy a spot in any DVD collection.

605855,A2D4E93M8AIQEO,B00005JLSK,"Daniel Ari ""Ghas Phox""","[0, 2]","Horror films drive viewers to heights of emotion by easing tense-but-quiet violins into the background, by dimming the lights, and by isolating characters for long periods of time. Then they deliver the wallop: the knife to the noggin, the corpse in the closet, the witch in the woods.Comedies get audiences to laugh by priming them for something funny to happen. You get to know the goofy characters and their traits so that when they do something particularly crass, embarrassing, or outrageous, you can laugh along with them. Even if the particular joke or stunt isn&#65533;t telegraphed, you&#65533;re still set up to expect something funny to happen.Perhaps the most fascinating thing about About Schmidt is that it continually seems to set up some familiar dramatic scene, some caper, some revelation or bombshell, but almost never delivers. Though rife with both humor and drama, the keel on the film stays even. Several times during the movie, the Mrs. and I tried to predict what was about to happen. ""He&#65533;s going to steal his car."" ""He&#65533;s about to tell off all those people."" ""She&#65533;s going to seduce him."" Each time, we were wrong. No bombshells.Well, there were some surprises, just not anywhere we expected them. And they were the quiet kind, not flashy, melodramatic kicks, but regular life events or revelations that had just enough impact to change the course of the main character, Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson). Paradoxically, there is a surprise ending of sorts, but it&#65533;s so subtle, that you may miss it. The twist is that what you&#65533;d expect to happen under normal conditions really does happen. The twist is that there is no twist. My expectations as a viewer were foiled because, since this is a movie with Jack Nicholson, I expected something a lot wilder to happen.The only thing that keeps About Schmidt from being a celebration of normality is that normality isn&#65533;t much into celebrations. Though a few characters are ""hyper-normal,"" verging on satire of WASP culture, the scenario mainly stays in recognizable territory. Warren Schmidt has turned 66 and is retiring from the insurance game. A depressingly staid dinner, albeit well-intentioned, is held in his honor; and a friend of his, getting drunk, delivers a toast which almost becomes an embarrassingly maudlin rant, as you might find in an uproarious comedy, but doesn&#65533;t.Schmidt settles into his boring retired life, and, while watching teevee, is moved to sponsor an African orphan with $22 per month. When his packet arrives from the foundation, he is inspired to write a long, personal letter to Ndugu in Tanzania. His occasional letters to Ndugu reveal his internal monologue in contrast to his external surroundings. Inside, his colorless, passionless life has left him bitter and sad. Externally, he must deal with a funeral and the sub-optimal marriage of his daughter.Schmidt takes to his RV, trekking from Omaha to Denver to stop the wedding, and along the way, he reveals a lot about himself through small, awkward encounters. His in-laws-to-be turn out to be every bit as dysfunctional as his own family was.Through its portrayals of typical middle-American events and values, About Schmidt tells a tale of quiet desperation and nihilism. It doesn&#65533;t harp on satire, and, in case you were worried about Nicholson going soft, it is far too cynical to be precious. In the end, however, it is Schmidt&#65533;s inexplicable good deed done halfway around the world that offers the only real hint of salvation for the character. And as the sole ray of light in a life otherwise obscured with miserliness and withholding, it saves him.I have to say that Jack Nicholson is a very good actor. Unlike Ed Norton, John Cusack, Bruce Willis, and about two dozen other actors I could name, Nicholson never lets his own personality as a celebrity interfere with his portrayal of his character. You never see him peek around the dullard Schmidt to say, ""Hey, look, it&#65533;s really me, the notorious Jack Nicholson."" That&#65533;s quite a feat considering how low-key Schmidt is. Kathy Bates also turns in a well-textured performance.The Mrs., as I&#65533;ve mentioned, was rolling on the floor laughing at some scenes. I didn&#65533;t find it ROTFL-funny, but I was charmed by it in general.

Hamlow,"[3, 3]","After retiring as an actuary from Woodland Insurance in Omaha, where he built his entire career, Warren Schmidt (Nicholson) faces the usual post-retirement crisis.  What to do now that he has all this free time on his hand?  He begins seeing his wife in a new light, on how her quirks begin irritating him.  As he wonders, ""Who is this old woman who lives with me?""  She seems bubbly enough and an effective housekeeper.  He's also worried about his daughter Genie (Hope Davis), who is soon to be married to an incompetent nincompoop hippie named Randall (Dermot Mulroney).  Then, the unthinkable happens:  his wife keels over and dies.After the funeral, he travels to Denver for Genie's wedding, which he plans to stop, and along the way, gains new insights.  Most of it in particular involves Genie's in-laws, led by the hefty Roberta (Kathy Bates), who is quite a character but can be negative.  Only Larry and his wife Sandra seem to be the truly decent characters here.  The bottom line is that he's losing Genie to this new flaky family, quite a contrast from his staid household.He also decides to sponsor an African child for $22 a month after watching an ad on TV.  His letters to the six-year old Ndugu reveal someone whom he feels comfortable opening up to, much like the son he never had, although I wonder if Ndugu would understand any high-level words or aspects of American culture.  With Genie's association with Randall and his dysfunctional family, it's clear how precarious the father-daughter grip on her is slipping.  Ndugu is a new start for Warren, and Schmidt's letters to Ndugu, accompanied by his narration, reveal someone trying to connect, but held back by this uncertainty, doubt that he is making a difference.This is a very atypical film role for Jack Nicholson.  Never mind the rabble-rouser in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the misanthrope in As Good As It Gets, or the manically giggling Joker in Batman.  Warren Schmidt is a retiree, reserved, insecure, with years of anger repressed inside.  A Best Actor award for this movie would tie him with Katherine Hepburn for four total awards, but I somehow doubt he will get it, though he is right to be nominated.  And as for Hope Davis, she plays Genie as simultaneously assertive to start a life of her own, away from the restrained aura of her parents.About Schmidt is not only about the autumn-soon-to-be-winter years of a man, where he thinks, ""Well, what have I accomplished in my life?"", but brings forth questions on how a man is judged by the number people he can have an impact on, i.e. ""Do I matter to someone, not just on a superficial level?""  This is a similar theme explored in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, about a bureaucrat dying of cancer, who decides to leave behind a park for children.

605858,A1R60K9D56XYL,B00005JLSK,Danny Rizzi,"[0, 1]","I initially awarded this film 4 stars and titled my review ""One of the Best Films of 2002"".  And I really did feel that way after the first viewing.  But after my second viewing, I wasn't quite as enthused.  I so wanted to love this film as I had ""Election"" and ""Citizen Ruth"", Payne's earlier films, that my judgement became clouded.  And ""About Schmidt"" makes trying to like it a difficult task, to say the least.  I won't go into much detail regarding the plot as many have already done that just fine.  Simply put, this is a film about a man questioning his entire life upon his retirement and trying to make sense of it and trying to fit into a world that devalues, to a large extent, its senior citizens.First of all, the pacing of this film is horrendous and the film is extremely unkind to most of its characters, except for Schmidt.  Everybody is depicted as selfish and insensitive.  Schmidt is also depicted this way but in a humorous light.  The first half of the film is actually pretty good but it's when Schmidt takes to the road and finally reaches his daughters future in-laws home that the film really becomes an endurance test for the audience.  Paynes insistence on portraying these people as white-trash with little character shading made me more than a little uncomfortable.  I sort of felt like I was watching a re-make of Tod Browning's classic ""Freaks"".Ultimately, whether or not you like this film depends a great deal on how much good will you have toward Nicholson.  Like I said, he is wonderful and there are several scenes with Schmidt re-evaluating everything in his life and grappling with feelings of uselessness, which ring with a resounding truthfulness.  And there is also a touching poignancy found in the scenes where Schmidt writes his letters to the indigent boy Ndugu(sp) he begins sponsoring upon his retirement.  But these scenes don't really add up to much because after viewing ""About Schmidt"", you come away feeling that the whole is much less than the sum of its parts.",3,"""About Schmidt"" Makes It So Hard To Like It.",1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,2016,"['initially', 'awarded', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'titled', 'review', 'One', 'Best', 'Films', '2002', 'really', 'did', 'feel', 'way', 'first', 'viewing', 'second', 'viewing', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enthused', 'so', 'wanted', 'love', 'film', 'had', 'Election', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'Payne', 'earlier', 'films', 'judgement', 'became', 'clouded', 'Schmidt', 'trying', 'like', 'difficult', 'task', 'say', 'least', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'detail', 'regarding', 'plot', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'just', 'fine', 'Simply', 'put', 'film', 'man', 'questioning', 'entire', 'life', 'retirement', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'trying', 'fit', 'world', 'large', 'extent', 'senior', 'citizens.First', 'pacing', 'film', 'horrendous', 'film', 'extremely', 'unkind', 'most', 'characters', 'Schmidt', 'Everybody', 'depicted', 'selfish', 'insensitive', 'Schmidt', 'also', 'depicted', 'way', 'humorous', 'light', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'when', 'Schmidt', 'road', 'finally', 'daughters', 'future', 'in-laws', 'home', 'film', 'really', 'endurance', 'test', 'audience', 'Paynes', 'insistence', 'portraying', 'people', 'white-trash', 'little', 'character', 'shading', 'made', 'more', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'sort', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 're-make', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'classic', 'Freaks', '.Ultimately', 'not', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'how', 'much', 'good', 'will', 'have', 'Nicholson', 'said', 'wonderful', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'Schmidt', 're-evaluating', 'everything', 'life', 'grappling', 'feelings', 'uselessness', 'ring', 'resounding', 'truthfulness', 'also', 'touching', 'poignancy', 'found', 'scenes', 'where', 'Schmidt', 'letters', 'indigent', 'boy', 'Ndugu', 'sp', 'sponsoring', 'retirement', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'up', 'much', 'viewing', 'Schmidt', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'whole', 'much', 'less', 'sum', 'parts']",N/A
605859,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00005JLSK,David Baldwin,"[3, 7]","Jack Nicholson solidifies his position as one of our great actors with his portrayal of retired Midwestern actuary Warren Schmidt.  Essentially this is a character who has drifted through life with meagre accomplishments and a mundane marriage who upon the death of his wife and his daughter's impending marriage to a loser starts to take stock of things.  Nicholson imbues this character with quiet dignity and does not play Schmidt for pathos.  One of the best devices the film uses are the correspondence between Schmidt and an African orphan, which we hear in voice-over by Nicholson.  It's in these letters that Schmidt lays out all his hopes and disappointments.  Another moving sequence involves Schmidt toasting his daughter at her nuptials even though he thinks the marriage is a mistake.  Credit is to be given to Hope Davis for daring to play the daughter as not all that sympathetic.  Kathy Bates, though, as the groom's hippie mother did not really intrigue me that much.  I think she received her Oscar nomination for appearing nude and for which I'm still trying to forget.  Credit has to go to director Alexander Payne and co-scripter Jim Taylor for crafting such a knowing portrait of Middle America, particularly growing old in this country.

Warren Schmidt, a casually reserved midwestern business executive, is a man who basically has everything: a great job, a loving and understanding wife, a modest home, along with many friends and business associates who take to Mr. Schmidt like a fish takes to water. Now, if only he could see eye to eye with his stern yet precocious daughter, which is another story... Upon retirement, Warren sets out to find a life ""unfulfilled"" by travelling vicariously (with his wife) in his deluxe Winnebago mobile home. Just as he is about to savor life's victorious fruits, he loses his wife to a brain disease, thus suddenly and tragically finding himself alone. He relies on a faraway foster child from Africa named Ngudu (or is it Ndugu?), whom he has been writing to by means of conventional letters, to help Schmidt cope with his somewhat newly found struggle of meandering through life's ""highways and byways"". Aside from being an adventurous movie, ""About Schmidt"" contains a degree of tender, lighthearted comedy as well, and in healthy doses. And it's all intelligently and tastefully done in a grandesque Neil Simon-like fashion, which makes it a likely candidate for best motion picture of 2003. With this movie, it becomes exceptionally clear that Jack Nicholson is definitely back and is here to stay, and he's come full circle and then some in the process. Dermot Mulroney delivers a superb supporting role as well. Since ""About Schmidt"" is a grand dramatic and comedic eye-opener that's sure to catch even the most average moviegoer's attention, you'll want to sit through multiple viewings of this priceless cinematic gem.

The image of retired people is that they have plenty of time in hand and they can get to do whatever they want. The movie showed otherwise, as Schmidt failed to accept the truth that he had been replaced by a much younger successor. He also grew tired of his habitual relationship with his wife, but when she left him, he had missed her and realized that he should have cherished what she had done for him. It is really depressing that we usually do not know to treasure something after we have lost it.Sometimes when the elderly look back on their lives, they do not know what they are worth. As lots of things have been done and there are no other alternatives, it is very difficult to adopt self-acknowledgement in an old age. The movie vividly portrayed the loss when Schmidt took a trip before his daughter's wedding. His journey to self-discovery is colorful but sad.Schmidt was forced to grant his daughter's marriage with a man he held much contempt. My mother told me that it is extremely painful when parents find their children doing something absolutely wrong for they have brought the children up and have really devoted themselves in ensuring their safety and happiness. But when the children have grown up, few of them appreciate their parent's dedication or take them into consideration.Above all, I have learned a lot from watching this movie.

605864,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JLSK,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 2]","Warren Schmidt is 65 or 66.  He is sitting in his office at Woodman Insurance in Omaha, Nebraska (that would be Mutual of Omaha, one imagines) waiting for the second hand and the minute hand to go straight up signaling that it is exactly five o'clock and he can go home.  He is precise about this.  It is also his last day at work.  He is retiring.  There is a retirement party.  It is incredibly banal: the little speeches of appreciation about his loyalty and how much he did for the company, the lame jokes, the wooden chicken, etc.  It's so bad that at one point Schmidt has to slip out for a vodka.And now he is into the sheer terror of retirement itself.  He is having trouble figuring out what to do with himself.  Being around his wife all the time irritates him.  Not having something worthwhile to do bores him.  He grumbles.  He flicks the remote on the TV.  He sees an ad to be a foster parent of a child in Tanzania.  Twenty-two bucks.  And then his wife of 42 years drops dead.  The even more banal funeral.  Now he really doesn't know what to do with himself.  He lets the house go to ruin: trash all over the place.  He doesn't shave.  He doesn't get out of his bathrobe.  His only daughter is marrying a guy he considers a nincompoop.  He writes letters to his six-year-old foster child telling him about his circumstances, but with the rose-colored glasses on.  He has nobody to talk to.Jack Nicholson stars as Schmidt and gives a very fine performance.  He is still obviously Jack Nicholson, one of the great stars of our time, but he is also Schmidt and he portrays this hollow man as though he is filled with angry, repressed bile.  Nicholson has the theatrical ability to overact without seeming to overact, to huff and puff and make hurt faces that seem so natural and in keeping with his character that we watch transfixed.  Nicholson somehow makes this most commonplace man and his most ordinary life fascinating.What I was wondering as I watched was, how does this play in Peoria?  (BYW, that's Peoria, Illinois, which serves however reluctantly as the psychological and politically-correct heart of America--or at least it has since John Ehrlichman of the Nixon administration first used the term in 1970.)  Will Peorians be offended?  Will the stifling banality of Schmidt's life be seen as satire and criticism of the American way of life, the usual blue state effete snobbery inflicted on the heartland citizens of the red states?  Or will heartlanders see no satire, no sarcasm, and instead imagine that Schmidt is the embodiment of all that is right and proper (with a few understandable human peccadillos to round out his character)?So I checked out some reader reviews.  I couldn't find any reviewers that were offended.  The ones who didn't like the movie said they were just bored to tears, or actually bored to anger.  They wasted their time and money on this movie!  Well, that doesn't mean much.  Any movie without a constant stream of titillation is bound to bore some people.But the movie is sad.  Schmidt is a sad character.  He calls himself a failure and asks if he has made any difference in anybody's life and he concludes that he hasn't.  He is an empty shell of a man whose relationships with other people were invariably shallow including that with his daughter about whom he hasn't a clue.Yet the movie is funny.  Most of the humor comes from how perfectly director Alexander Payne got the insipid banalities of our culture and mentality:  The knickknacks that Schmidt leaves on the roof of the Winnebago.  The roadside museums with their self-important histories.  The bromides and platitudes from the groom-to-be (Dermot Mulroney) and his Ponzi scheme dream of wealth.  Schmidt's stupidity in mistaking a younger woman's pity for sexual desire.  His stupefying inability to have the slightest clue about anybody but himself.The supporting cast was very good, particularly Kathy Bates as Roberta the groom's earth mother with libido who fills the screen with her...uh, unmistakable presence, scaring Schmidt all the way back to Omaha.  And Hope Davis is excellent as the daughter who no longer has any patience with her father's selfish obtuseness.  The scene in which she tells him off in no uncertain terms is one of the best movie putdowns I've seen in years.But see this for Alexander Payne whose directorial credits include Election (1999) and Sideways (2004).

Sixty-seven year old Schmidt goes through the motions of his last day at the firm, watching the clock on the wall of his cleared-out office tick closer to 5:00 PM with the resignation and boredom one would expect from a man of ""wood"".  Once Schmidt's life at Woodmen draws to a close, with a perfunctory retirement party complete with insincere toasts and speeches extolling his personality and dedication, we begin to get the sense that Schmidt could care less.  His life is about to become meaningless without the anchor of nine-to-five employment.  The routineness of his life as exemplified by his scathingly critical expose of his wife and his unrealistic and sentimental memories of a daughter that thinks of him as a financial resource rather than a mentor/father back slides from 'drive' to 'reverse' when Schmidt's wife suddenly dies and leaves him cruelly alone with his sense of failure and no way to face the future.I found nothing vaguely amusing about this film.  Yes, there are some laughs, but they are tinged with a sour realism.  Nicholson's performance is perfection--his frugality of spirit underlined by his begrudged finacial endowments to his only daughter ironically are contradicted by his ability to revel his true self in letters to an unknown 6 year old African child  that he fosters through a 'Save the Children' organization.  Sadly, Schmidt can only emote from a distance and certainly not with family or friends. His film journey is one where he undergoes no real postive transformation.  Instead, as he struggles to find some meaning in his life, he is touched by something so far removed from his mid-western world, I wonder if his emotional catharsis at the end of the film merely signifies a further cracking of reserve and plunge into a deeper more despondant despair, rather than the herald of positive realization noted by the other reviewers.Kathy Bates' far too short and unpivotal role as Schmidt's daughter's future mother-in-law has gotten far too many kudos, most likely because of her rather daring naked display in a backyard hot tub. She and her cartoonish extended family merely serve either to emphasize Schmidt's emotional detachment or to epitomize the automatic human Schmidt was before his retirement, death of his wife and rejection of his daughter.As this film poses the big question, it is no means boring, nor should it be overlooked.  However, rather than uplift, it depresses and for this I subtracted 2 stars;it is certainly not a film I would want to watch over again and I will make sure I avoid it on video and cable.  I do not recommend this film to anyone who has lost a parent or a loved one as it will only excruciatingly detail all the anxiety and helplessness that anyone spiritually healthy would want to forget.",3,Nothing Comedic About It,1044835200,"02 10, 2003",2003,3104,"['opening', 'shots', 'huge', 'rectangular', 'Woodmen', 'building', 'towers', 'Omaha', 'skyline', 'view', 'structure', 'different', 'angles', 'nevertheless', 'presence', 'rest', 'scene', 'pretty', 'much', 'life', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'Willy', 'Loman', 'insurance', 'business', 'Sixty-seven', 'year', 'old', 'Schmidt', 'motions', 'last', 'day', 'firm', 'watching', 'clock', 'wall', 'cleared-out', 'office', 'tick', 'closer', '5:00', 'PM', 'resignation', 'boredom', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'man', 'wood', 'Once', 'Schmidt', 'life', 'Woodmen', 'close', 'perfunctory', 'retirement', 'party', 'complete', 'insincere', 'toasts', 'speeches', 'extolling', 'personality', 'dedication', 'begin', 'get', 'sense', 'Schmidt', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'life', 'become', 'meaningless', 'anchor', 'nine-to-five', 'employment', 'routineness', 'life', 'exemplified', 'scathingly', 'critical', 'expose', 'wife', 'unrealistic', 'sentimental', 'memories', 'daughter', 'financial', 'resource', 'rather', 'mentor/father', 'back', ""'drive"", ""'reverse"", 'when', 'Schmidt', 'wife', 'suddenly', 'cruelly', 'alone', 'sense', 'failure', 'way', 'face', 'future.I', 'found', 'nothing', 'vaguely', 'amusing', 'film', 'Yes', 'are', 'laughs', 'are', 'tinged', 'sour', 'realism', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'perfection', 'frugality', 'spirit', 'underlined', 'begrudged', 'finacial', 'endowments', 'only', 'daughter', 'ironically', 'are', 'contradicted', 'ability', 'revel', 'true', 'self', 'letters', 'unknown', '6', 'year', 'old', 'African', 'child', 'Children', 'organization', 'Sadly', 'Schmidt', 'can', 'only', 'emote', 'distance', 'certainly', 'not', 'family', 'friends', 'film', 'journey', 'one', 'where', 'real', 'postive', 'transformation', 'Instead', 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'touched', 'something', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'mid-western', 'world', 'wonder', 'emotional', 'catharsis', 'end', 'film', 'merely', 'further', 'cracking', 'reserve', 'plunge', 'deeper', 'more', 'despondant', 'despair', 'rather', 'herald', 'positive', 'realization', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewers.Kathy', 'Bates', 'far', 'too', 'short', 'unpivotal', 'role', 'Schmidt', 'daughter', 'future', 'mother-in-law', 'gotten', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'kudos', 'most', 'likely', 'rather', 'daring', 'naked', 'display', 'backyard', 'hot', 'tub', 'cartoonish', 'extended', 'family', 'merely', 'serve', 'emphasize', 'Schmidt', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'epitomize', 'automatic', 'human', 'Schmidt', 'was', 'retirement', 'death', 'wife', 'rejection', 'daughter.As', 'film', 'big', 'question', 'means', 'boring', 'should', 'be', 'overlooked', 'However', 'rather', 'uplift', 'subtracted', '2', 'stars', 'certainly', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'will', 'make', 'sure', 'avoid', 'video', 'cable', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'lost', 'parent', 'loved', 'one', 'will', 'only', 'excruciatingly', 'detail', 'anxiety', 'helplessness', 'anyone', 'spiritually', 'healthy', 'would', 'want', 'forget']",N/A

He is a selfish and delusional middle-class automaton, without any creative interests or authentic emotional feelings. And that's the biggest problem with ABOUT SCHMIDT: how are you supposed to sit and watch and take in the exploits of someone you hate for 125 minutes?Jack Nicholson's comb-over character lives in a big, suburban house. He secretly hates his wife, but suddenly loves her again after she dies. He has idealized views of his daughter that are not true. He's so pathetic and lonely that he starts sponsoring a third-world African kid named Ndugu and writing letters to him, detailing the horrors of his life. I'm not sure, but I think dysyntery and starvation are bigger problems then leading an empty, meaningless life in Nebraska.Schmidt hits the road in his Winnebago. He goes to boring museums for boring, empty people. He writes Ndugu with idealized visions of his road trip. He eventually ends up in Denver to help with his daughter's wedding, where we finally meet the groom's family, the only ray of hope in this dismal celluloid disaster. However, this family (led by Kathy Bates, who yes, does a nude scene) is viewed very condescendingly by Payne's camera, which is a shame. They may be caricatures, but at least they know what they want out of life.I don't have sympathy for empty people, people who rate success by their job title and annual income and nothing else. I don't care to see middle-aged schlubs trying to find themselves and lend some sort of meaning to their lives. Everything about Schmidt is a lie, and a boring lie at that.

To briefly recapitulate the story, Schmidt is a lifetime employee of Woodmen Insurance of Omaha who has risen through the ranks to an executive position. The movie begins with his retirement dinner, at which time he receives many accolades and testimonies of his value to the company. But once he is no longer working, he is at loose ends. Although he has been married for more than 40 years he has never been all that close to his wife, having been consumed with his work life. He finds many of her habits annoying, and so he begins trying to find things to do to occupy his time, including going back to check in on how things are going at the office.When he arrives he discovers (to his disappointment) that the office is functioning quite well without him and that he has been all but forgotten. On the way out of the building he goes past a trash area where, much to his chagrin, he sees that the files he has kept over the years have been discarded.Then his wife dies quite suddenly of a heart attack. He is even more alone than ever. Having just recently bought a Winnebago, which he had intended to use for cross-country trips with his wife, he sets out on a road trip of his own, one that will end up in Denver where his daughter is going to marry a rather average (at best) young man of whom he strongly disapproves. On the way, he stops by his fraternity house at the University of Nebraska (the scene is actually shot on the U. of Kansas campus), mistakes the kindness of a married woman at an RV park for sexual attraction and makes a fool of himself as a result, and finally arrives at his future son-in-law's house in Denver, where he meets the son-in-law's mother, an aging hippie type who is seemingly as liberated as Schmidt is uptight.As others have pointed out, ""About Schmidt"" is a slow-moving film. However, this is intentional. For Schmidt's life, now that he no longer has meaningful work, is slow moving and tedious. The film well captures this, as it also does the essential meaninglessness of his life now that he's no longer employed as well as his sense of abandonment and loneliness as an aging person.There is no happy ending to ""About Schmidt,"" as is true of many older people who find themselves increasingly left behind by a society that can get along well without them.

I've never seen Jack Nicholson in quite such a role as a ""regular Joe"" retiree - it's so unlike him yet he performed it as if it were no effort at all! He's the epitome of your gentle, conservative mid-western father/husband from a time when life wasn't so complicated yet typically boring, that is, until his world is turned upside down with two major events that ultimately happen in many folks life at the retirement age.In addition, both Kathy Bates and Howard Hesseman (of WKRP Cincinnati fame) deliver wonderful performances as they truly depicted the typical ""Washington Park"" Denver liberal free-loving folks that I so truly remember from my days living in Denver. By the way, the entire scenes shot in Denver were highly authentic all the way down to the streets, addresses and attitudes for the area they were in - a rarity in movies for non-typical big cities like Chicago, LA or NYC.The movie is all about transitions in the latter stages of life, what-if's, regrets, loneliness and looking to the future. It's a bleak movie with hints of promise and hope. I took my parents (both retired in past year) to the movie as they rarely go to movies and they seem to have thoroughly enjoyed it - dad mentioned that it was certain thought provoking for him! I chuckle as it's been a while since I've seen more gray hairs in a movie theatre than youngsters romping around with cell phones - it was refreshing! ;)One last piece that I'll not totally divulge - after watching the movie, you may be so compelled to want to give to a wonderful cause in making a different in someone's life! I'm not sure if it's Nicholson's passion but it's one that is noble.I'll add the DVD to my collection and highly recommend it. Oh - why not a 5 star?

Warren lives in Omaha, Nebraska, and he is put out to pasture after a long career with an insurance company.  Warren hates retirement, for which he is ill-prepared.  In addition, Helen, Warren's wife of forty-two years, irritates him with her annoying habits and idiosyncrasies.  Worst of all, Jeannie, Warren's beloved only child,  is engaged to a man whom Warren cannot stand.When Warren suddenly becomes a widower, he takes stock of his life, and he is appalled at how empty it is.  In desperation, Warren starts to write rambling letters to his Tanzanian foster child, Ndugu. (Warren sends the child twenty-two dollars a month in response to a television appeal).  Even though Ndugu is six years old and cannot read, Warren pours his heart into these letters as a means of venting his anger and frustration.Alexander Payne, who directed ""About Schmidt"" and shares credit for writing the fine screenplay, has done a commendable job of eliciting strong performances from an excellent cast.  Kathy Bates is a hoot as Jeannie's future mother-in-law, and both Len Cariou and Howard Hesseman shine in small roles.  The film, however, belongs to Jack Nicholson, who appears in practically every frame.Nicholson acts with his entire body.  He does wonders with a raised eyebrow, a half-smile, a gesture or a glance.  In one hilarious scene, Nicholson does battle with a waterbed and loses.  Nicholson captures the very essence of Warren Schmidt, a man who will never be ready for the first day of the rest of his life.

If anything, it commits the crime of being too realistic.  If you believe that the purpose of films should be for pure joyous escapism, you probably won't like it very much.  The meloncholic (sometimes manic) bitterness of Nicholson's charactor is so real its almost infectious... This isn't to say that some of the scenes aren't uncomfortably hillarious. I loved the guy who plays Schmidt's dumb schm*ck son-in-law, and Bates' in her spunky White Trash in-law from hell role.  In fact, I think an entire family of people could watch this film and each have a different reaction based on the charactor they identify with the most. - - and as bleak and depressing as the film can be at times, I imagine many viewers who identify with Nicholson's charactor as he copes with the loss of his wife, his sense of lonliness and his uneasy relationship with his daughter will find the film cathartic, even inspiring.  - - So what to say?  Well... Personally speaking, I like to go to the movies to feel cheered up and pure escapism... which is why I felt uncomfortable with it. However, why shouldn't movies present the same wide range of emotions as life, and be poignant ?  - - The call is yours.  - - Incidentally, if you enjoy this film, check out a British TV series called ""The Royle Family"" which also in my book commits the crime (almost brilliantly) of trying to present the humor of working class life, but so realistically you don't know whether to laugh at and with the charactors or head straight to the kitchen and stick your head in the oven while listening to the local publically funded Classical Music radio station.",4,Love it or hate it... no in between...,1073865600,"01 12, 2004",2004,1684,"['film', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'hate', 'anything', 'crime', 'being', 'too', 'realistic', 'believe', 'purpose', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'pure', 'joyous', 'escapism', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'much', 'meloncholic', 'sometimes', 'manic', 'bitterness', 'Nicholson', 'charactor', 'so', 'real', 'almost', 'infectious', ""n't"", 'say', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'uncomfortably', 'hillarious', 'loved', 'guy', 'who', 'Schmidt', 'dumb', 'schm*ck', 'son-in-law', 'Bates', 'spunky', 'White', 'Trash', 'in-law', 'hell', 'role', 'fact', 'think', 'entire', 'family', 'people', 'could', 'watch', 'film', 'have', 'different', 'reaction', 'based', 'charactor', 'identify', 'most', 'bleak', 'depressing', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'imagine', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'identify', 'Nicholson', 'charactor', 'loss', 'wife', 'sense', 'lonliness', 'uneasy', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'cathartic', 'even', 'inspiring', 'So', 'what', 'say', 'Well', 'Personally', 'speaking', 'like', 'go', 'movies', 'feel', 'cheered', 'up', 'pure', 'escapism', 'why', 'felt', 'uncomfortable', 'However', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'movies', 'present', 'same', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'life', 'be', 'poignant', 'call', 'yours', 'Incidentally', 'enjoy', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'called', 'Royle', 'Family', 'also', 'book', 'crime', 'almost', 'brilliantly', 'trying', 'present', 'humor', 'working', 'class', 'life', 'so', 'realistically', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'charactors', 'head', 'straight', 'kitchen', 'stick', 'head', 'oven', 'listening', 'local', 'publically', 'funded', 'Classical', 'Music', 'radio', 'station']",N/A

I loved this movie, and thought that it did a perfect way of drifting from comedy to drama throughout the entire film. Jack Nicholson was perfect in this movie, and it felt like his put in alot of work to master the facial expressions and the feelings of the main character Warren Schmidt. Kathy Bates was a comic genius and her timing was perfect as Roberta, and Dermet Mulronely had a perfect transformation from what he usually looks like, to what he looked like in this movie.As I said above, Jack Nicholson played Warren Schmidt, a sixty six year old recently retired man, who works at Woodmen of the World, or the insurence game as he calls it. Now he is at home everyday with his wife Helen, and he eventually begins to sponser a six year old boy named Ndugu Umbo. He writes to Ndugu in letters. But tradgy strikes Warren when he comes home to find Helen dead on the kitchen floor. After the funeral, he decides that he has to make the best of the rest of his time in this world. But when he finds out that Helen was having an affair years ago with his best friend Ray, Warren decides to go to Denver to see his daughter in the RV that he and Helen bought months earlier. His daughter Jeanie is getting married to that of Randell Hertz, a waterbed salesmen, who Warren feels is not right for his daughter. Warren and Jeanie planned that he would come up two or three days before the wedding, but Warren decides to come much earlier. Janie tells him to go home, so Warren decides to go on a trip to remember his past. When he finally makes it to Denver he meets Randell's mother Roberta, and her ex-husband and his wife Larry and Sandra. Warren is not happy with his new family and makes it his mission to convince Jeanie that she is getting ready to marry the wrong man, a point that adds more problems to their already tenuous relationship.I'll first discuss the letters that Warren writes to Ndugu. When Warren is writing the letters to him you'll hear him say Dear, Ndugu. When I saw this in the theatre, everybody started to laugh at that line. They laughed because you knew that whenever he was writing to Ndugu he was going to pour out all of his feeling. His letters to Ndugu allow him to express his feelings to somebody that he knows is not going to judge him or even respond with a clever remark. It is a six year old boy who does not speak English. Warren could tell him anything, and you could relate to his problems because everybody has gone through some of the problems that Warren goes through during this film.The actress who played Jeanie, Hope Davis, was doing her job just fine. She was supposed to be a character that you don't like, and the only thing that I thought about during the movie was that I didn't like her. That is the sign of a great actress. I want to see her preformance in &quot;American Splendor&quot; to compare. Nothing really happens in &quot;About Schmidt.&quot; I'm guessing that that is the reason that alot of peopel found it boring. It had useless infomation, but it was was nice to hear everything. &quot;About Schmidt&quot; was a very interesting character study. But alot of people who watch movies have to have instant storylines. This was a slow movie, I agree.

The main character, played by Nicholson, is not easy to like: he's hopelessly self-absorbed, cowardly, and basically pathetic.  During the course of the film he does manage to gain a fair bit of enlightenment and personal growth, but it's all too little too late: there are no magical, uplifting, tear-jerking transformations and irreconcilable differences reconciled, no unsurmountable problems surmounted, no crowd-pleasing Big Happy Ending to wrap it all up in a nice little bow.  Schmidt is an amusing and interesting character, yet so unvarnished that you really DON'T want to identify with him.Yet it's equally hard to DISLIKE this film, because it rings so true on so many different levels: plodding through our cutthroat corporate/work culture, the impenetrable sterility of life in the suburbs, selling out the best years of one's life and then being left with the sorry leftovers for a few years before kicking the bucket, an empty gray marriage chosen out of sheer laziness and fear...who isn't guilty of at least several of the preceding?  Bleak it is, but also brutally honest, uncompromisingly authentic.Without any flights of sentimentality or saccharine or wishful thinking, &quot;About Schmidt&quot; hits us with the end result of precisely such a wasted life: the enveloping grayness, emptiness, isolation and desolation of it all when two of our most powerful diversions are finally stripped away---the job and the spouse---and we can no longer run away from the lie and the farce that we've made our life into.Think of it as a wake-up call, a &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; movie in reverse: this film shows you precisely what happens when you DON'T seize the day but instead choose to waste your life away.",4,About as REAL as it gets...,1068768000,"11 14, 2003",2003,1776,"['quot', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'quot', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Nicholson', 'not', 'easy', 'like', 'hopelessly', 'self-absorbed', 'cowardly', 'basically', 'pathetic', 'course', 'film', 'manage', 'gain', 'fair', 'bit', 'enlightenment', 'personal', 'growth', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'are', 'magical', 'uplifting', 'tear-jerking', 'transformations', 'irreconcilable', 'differences', 'reconciled', 'unsurmountable', 'problems', 'surmounted', 'crowd-pleasing', 'Big', 'Happy', 'Ending', 'wrap', 'up', 'nice', 'little', 'bow', 'Schmidt', 'amusing', 'interesting', 'character', 'yet', 'so', 'unvarnished', 'really', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'want', 'identify', 'him.Yet', 'equally', 'hard', 'DISLIKE', 'film', 'so', 'true', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'plodding', 'cutthroat', 'corporate/work', 'culture', 'impenetrable', 'sterility', 'life', 'suburbs', 'selling', 'out', 'best', 'years', 'one', 'life', 'then', 'being', 'left', 'sorry', 'leftovers', 'few', 'years', 'kicking', 'bucket', 'empty', 'gray', 'marriage', 'chosen', 'sheer', 'laziness', 'fear', 'who', ""n't"", 'guilty', 'least', 'several', 'preceding', 'also', 'brutally', 'honest', 'uncompromisingly', 'flights', 'sentimentality', 'saccharine', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'quot', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'quot', 'end', 'result', 'precisely', 'such', 'wasted', 'life', 'enveloping', 'grayness', 'emptiness', 'isolation', 'desolation', 'when', 'two', 'most', 'powerful', 'diversions', 'are', 'finally', 'stripped', 'away', '-the', 'job', 'spouse', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'run', 'away', 'lie', 'farce', ""'ve"", 'made', 'life', 'into.Think', 'wake-up', 'call', 'quot', 'Carpe', 'Diem', 'quot', 'movie', 'reverse', 'film', 'precisely', 'what', 'when', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'seize', 'day', 'instead', 'choose', 'waste', 'life', 'away']",N/A

It is a dark, existential meditation on the mostly pointless life of a retired insurance executive, Jack Nicholson, whose only honest communications are with an orphaned six year-old boy he is sponsoring through an international aid agency.  I was struck by the care that went into every scene and the understated humor which, while often cruel, really struck a chord.  The characters are wonderfully quirky and well conceived (Kathy Bates is a total riot) and some brilliant makeup artist made Dermot Mulroney so unattractive as to be unrecognizable.  The camera often lingers mercilessly on Nicholson's face, which is made (or allowed) to look as puffy and creased as possible, and with this palate of aging flesh he is a master painter of facial expressions.  Nicholson's road trip across Nebraska also incorporates brilliant bits of Americana.  The deleted scenes are interesting, and accompanied by very revealing director's commentary.  Make sure to watch the one in which Jack Nicholson orders breakfast and the server tells him ""no substitutions,"" echoing the iconic scene from Five Easy Pieces.

Kim,"[2, 2]","If you're a fan of Jack Nicholson and are in love with the movies that he stars in (Five Easy Pieces, Chinatown, Batman, etc.), then you'll probably be pleasantly surprised with this one. About Schmidt features a different kind of Jack: he's not slick or witty or even charismatic. This time, he plays a retired man who has nothing to say or accomplish. He is convinced that he has made no difference at all in life. What happens to him AND around him doesn't seem to matter anymore (except when he tries to drag his daughter away from marriage). So with all the worthless free time, he decides to sponsor a foster child from Africa named Ndugu. During this time, he writes letters to the little boy and these are the only times he expresses his true feelings to another person. When his wife passes away and his life seems more worthless than before, Schmidt ultimately travels to Colorado just days before his daughter's wedding to meet his future son-in-law's eccentric family.This is a comedy-drama that simply works. Not only does it feature Jack in a drastic departure from his other performances, it also features life during the Autumn Years. It shows us a truer side to retirement and how it affects the mindset of the sort of people who don't find anything very exciting or worthwhile. The dramatic moments do work, as well as the comedic ones. Another thing that I like about this film is how the slow and quiet pace of the film resembles the main character's experience during retirement. Kathy Bates and the supporting cast do very good jobs. The only problem I have is the brief and unexpected nudity in one scene, which seems unnecessary and rather distracting. Other than that, this is a great film by both Jack and director Alexander Payne. And if you haven't seen this film yet, well, be prepared to be intrigued by the deep story and some TRULY authentic acting.Grade: A-",5,The Trouble with the Autumn Years,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,1890,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'are', 'love', 'movies', 'Five', 'Easy', 'Pieces', 'Chinatown', 'Batman', 'etc', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'one', 'Schmidt', 'different', 'kind', 'Jack', 'not', 'slick', 'witty', 'even', 'charismatic', 'time', 'retired', 'man', 'who', 'nothing', 'say', 'accomplish', 'convinced', 'made', 'difference', 'life', 'What', 'AND', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'anymore', 'when', 'drag', 'daughter', 'away', 'marriage', 'worthless', 'free', 'time', 'sponsor', 'foster', 'child', 'Africa', 'named', 'Ndugu', 'time', 'letters', 'little', 'boy', 'are', 'only', 'times', 'true', 'feelings', 'person', 'When', 'wife', 'away', 'life', 'more', 'worthless', 'before', 'Schmidt', 'ultimately', 'Colorado', 'just', 'days', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'meet', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'eccentric', 'family.This', 'comedy-drama', 'simply', 'Not', 'only', 'feature', 'Jack', 'drastic', 'departure', 'other', 'performances', 'also', 'life', 'Autumn', 'Years', 'truer', 'side', 'retirement', 'how', 'mindset', 'sort', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'very', 'exciting', 'worthwhile', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'do', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'comedic', 'ones', 'thing', 'like', 'film', 'how', 'slow', 'quiet', 'pace', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'experience', 'retirement', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'jobs', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'brief', 'unexpected', 'nudity', 'one', 'scene', 'unnecessary', 'rather', 'distracting', 'Other', 'great', 'film', 'Jack', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'well', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'intrigued', 'deep', 'story', 'TRULY', 'authentic', 'acting.Grade', 'A-']",N/A
605890,AYKELBZM1SH87,B00005JLSK,Erin O'Brien,"[6, 10]","Jack Nicholson is Warren R. Schmidt, an Omaha insurance executive being forcibly retired at the too-early age of 66.  He has lived to see his work literally binned by his firm.  His daughter Jeannie rarely visits.  His wife has become an unpleasant stranger.  He has some twenty years, give or take, left to live.(Social commentary everywhere.  Sixty-six is not what it used to be: Schmidt is entirely too lively and rugged to be permanently benched.)The formulae of literature classes suddenly spring to mind.  Schmidt is an honest-to-god Everyman: an Everyman who missed every flight to Hollywood.  He presents as if bleached, as if a personification of a second-greatest generation, a sum of values, not features.  He is The Minimalist Midwesterner: thrift, privacy, and industry incarnate.  His plight is memorable; critically, he is not.  Schmidt is such an intensely private character that not even the audience will know him entirely.The film begins as a subtle, well-executed comedy of insulted dignity, as Schmidt tries to find a way to occupy his hours.  He tries and fails to slip back to the office.  His wife has splurged on a luxury Winnebago and threatens ""lots of good times ahead"".Schmidt retreats to the television, clicks through channels, and sees a beseeching ad for ""Childreach"", a charity devoted to children in the Third World.  An announcer warns that, ""no, pity and guilt won't help"", and Schmidt calls in his pledge.A form letter arrives with a boldface name, and Schmidt, eyebrows raised, is delivered of a son, six-year old Ndugu of Tanzania.  Some $22 is expected of him per month, and the charity suggests a task: Schmidt should write the boy a letter of introduction with a few particulars about his own life in America.Schmidt pulls out a legal pad and begins to compose the majority of the film's script, an epistolary narrative of one-sidedness.  Schmidt takes to self-absorption with seriousness and therapeutic result.  It is through the letters that the film shifts gears, with comedy gradually decelerating into genuine pathos.His first letter to Ndugu complains about his wife, a banal asterisk of a woman, as matronly as Schmidt is stoically handsome.  Before they can take a single ""adventure"" trip, she fatally strokes out while a passive-aggressive Schmidt ""dillydallies"" over errands.  He finds her pitched forward on the carpet, as her vacuum-cleaner weeps gently on.Ever the actuary, Schmidt recalculates his life expectancy in light of his solitude.  The future looks bleaker and shorter.  He buries his wife, as his daughter will later discover, in the second-cheapest coffin available: thrift.The orphaned Schmidt clings tighter to his imaginary companion Ndugu, and he sets out in his Ark-sized trailer to rescue his daughter for the foolishness of her impending marriage, only weeks away. Her fianc&eacute; sports a mullet.  His opening salvo to Schmidt involved a transparent sales pitch with the reassuring tag, ""this isn't a pyramid scheme.""  The fianc&eacute; truly isn't good enough.Schmidt's first sign of life comes when he winningly decides to accept ""you sad, sad man"" as a sexual overture from a married woman he meets on his journey.  Her screams of rejection prompt a dark night of the soul.When Schmidt finally reaches Denver for the wedding, he joins his future in-laws, including the mother of Jeannie's fianc&eacute; (Kathy Bates).  Cultures collide.  Schmidt recoils from a ghastly brush with incest inflicted by Bates through her detailed revelations of Jeannie's sex life.  Apparently, ""the kids"" will hold their marriage together with their ""what goes on under the sheets.""Kathy Bates bursts out of her role as a clapped-out old hippie, weirdly blowing her timing in a number of lines.  It becomes abruptly clear that she is a great dramatist, not a comedian, and that she cannot be shoe-horned into someone else's film: her presence and talent register too profoundly.  Her infamous nude scene, as she joins Schmidt in a creepily snug hot-tub, is more unkind than clever, and is directed more like a stunt (Extreme Nudity) than a dramatic scene. She thrills momentarily as she flings down a chicken bone in disgust when her ex-husband, a pompous Toastmaster type, delivers a welcoming oration to Schmidt.At last, Schmidt receives a response from Tanzania, and its lessons come with the force of a body blow.  A Belgian nun has finally, kindly replied, explaining in a short note penned in creaky English that Ndugu is yet too young to read or write, but that she has shared the letters' contents.  Schmidt's money has provided medication to save Ndugu's eyesight.  Her gentleness, foreign to the rest of the film, has the same effect as violence, exploding like a bomb against Schmidt's identity, his delusions and pride.In exchange for Ndugu's vision, Schmidt finally experiences insight.  No more letters to be written with the demented obliviousness of a senile grandfather: ""I bet you're eager to cash this cheque and get yourself something to eat.""Schmidt, citizen of the First-World, needs tiny Ndugu more than he is needed.  The tactful Sister is somewhat puzzled by Schmidt's avalanche of confessional correspondence.  At best, Ndugu has been given a pr&eacute;cis of the contents.  Now Schmidt is more alone than ever.  But wait: the boy has enclosed a drawing of two stick figures, one small, one large, holding hands, conjoined against a rainbow.  Ndugu, the Earth's true future, will see, and Schmidt has found ties that bind.",5,All joking aside,1087516800,"06 18, 2004",2004,5511,"['Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Warren', 'R.', 'Schmidt', 'Omaha',

605891,A2Q8GDXZVUQX7N,B00005JLSK,"""essndee""","[2, 3]","First of all, I'd like to say something about a lot of the reviews of this movie. I notice that a lot of people cut back on stars because it's ""depressing."" Is this actually a good reason to give it a bad/average review? One person gave it 1 star because they said it was bitter, depressing, and puzzling. Sounds like this movie in reality was actually a 5 star to this person. A movie so subtletly powerful that can put you in a depressed state?Some people get scared to look beyond the simple ""It was sad and depressing, who would want to watch that?"" because of the extreme depth that the movie had that they can probably relate to themselves. It was a very depressing movie indeed, but it was magnicifent, rich, thought-provoking, and taught an extremely important life lesson.The movie is about a man named Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson), who has just retired and seems to be on some sort of journey to find his purpose in life. When his wife dies, he's left all alone with his confused emotions and a big trailer which he decides to leave in.I'm not going to get into extreme details of the movie, but I would like to address some of the important life lessons that it teaches. One way to look at it: the hypothesis of the movie was proposed by Warren's best friend at his retirement party. He claimed that what makes a man rich is being able to do your job well in life, therefore making Warren Schmidt a very rich man. For the rest of the movie, Warren seems to be challenging this idea. Is that was truly makes a man happy? I won't spoil it for you, but the outcome is something to truly ponder. A great movie for teenagers especially.Another life lesson is getting to know those whom you love as good as you can. When Warren's wife died; he had all of these questions. ""Did Helen really love me?"", etc. He even writes to Ndugu (a young boy in Africa who he sponsors), ""Young man, you need to cherish the things you have, while you have them."" Warren learns a valuable lesson of how quickly things can disappear and how you must take advantage every day while they are still there to cherish, love, and get to know them exactly for who they are.I loved the symbolism in the movie.

It was a powerful movie, and I'd regard it as more disturbing than entertaining. Jack Nicholson was, well, Jack Nicolson, and the rest of the cast backed him up superbly. Alexander Payne should have at least been nominated for Best Director for this film. ""About Schmidt"" was, well, it was about me, and I suppose a lot of other people would fit just as well with a few minor adjustments here and there. In a very personal way it fit me in a stunning way. I just retired after a 48-year career as a professor, just like Schmidt retired and with a lot of the same feelings. I recently lost my wife, not through death as with Schmidt, she just left me. I was now looking into the void euphemistically known as ""The Golden Years"" and wondering what to do. I watched Warren Schmidt going through much the same thing and I felt his pain. Intensely.Director Payne, together with Nicholson and crew, seemed to know and understand me at depth. They understood my feelings of depression and anxiety as my new era in life was unfolding. They especially seemed to know what I didn't particularly like and what things would irritate and annoy me and they dwelled on them. How could they possibly know all the quirky personalities and awkward small-time social situations that I'd cringe at? Then rubbed them in my face one by one throughout the movie. How could they know that I can't stand Winnebagos and then use one for a dominant movie set? It's uncanny. How could they know all the trivial things in life that tend to depress me and then turn them into major points in the movie? Well, the movie represents a superb job of writing, direction and acting, that's what it is. They seem to have had a deep understanding of the aging average American and they used it to the fullest.Was the movie entertaining? No, it wasn't, but it was very well done. A masterpiece. However, I doubt that I'll ever watch the movie again. It's too discomfiting. As a form of entertainment, I'd give it no better than three stars.

I just moved to Arizona from Kansas City after living there for 11 years and within the first few seconds of this film, I felt instantly transplanted back to a dull, gray, dead, miserable, boring, and uninspiring midwest landscape.  It was an odd reaction and the movie just started!  Not to knock the landscape, but in comparison to the mountainous desert range or ocean, the midwest is plagued with flat land and crops - all of which turns gray in the winter.  This is what you see in the opening of this film and it's important to recognize.We see a simple life, that of a man who has worked his way up at the same company for a long time and is now retired and adjusting to a new life.  Only now does Warren Schmidt feel like he can play an active role in the life of his daugther by trying to prevent her marriage.  This simple life is very common to the midwestern of a generation who is approaching retirement today.Schmidt's only outlet is from one I shall not give away but it's a chance for him to truly express how he feels considering he completely takes his wife for granted after 42 years of marriage and has no good way of communicating how he feels.Do the attempts fail or does he succeed at preventing his daughter's wedding?  I shall not tell but will say that the experiences he goes through in meeting their family are very funny and interesting in depicting a dysfunctional environment that the family considers very normal.If you're not from the midwest, this film might seem obscure to you...if you're retired, it might hit home....if neither (like me), just watch it to see some great acting and learn maybe it's good not to take life for granted.",4,accurately depicts midwestern life,1043366400,"01 24, 2003",2003,1789,"['Kudos', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'really', 'recreating', 'what', 'watching', 'days', 'go', 'working', 'job', 'midwest', 'just', 'moved', 'Arizona', 'Kansas', 'City', 'living', 'there', '11', 'years', 'first', 'few', 'seconds', 'film', 'felt', 'instantly', 'transplanted', 'back', 'dull', 'gray', 'dead', 'miserable', 'boring', 'uninspiring', 'midwest', 'landscape', 'was', 'odd', 'reaction', 'movie', 'just', 'started', 'Not', 'knock', 'landscape', 'comparison', 'mountainous', 'desert', 'range', 'ocean', 'midwest', 'plagued', 'flat', 'land', 'crops', 'gray', 'winter', 'what', 'see', 'opening', 'film', 'important', 'recognize.We', 'see', 'simple', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'worked', 'way', 'up', 'same', 'company', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'retired', 'adjusting', 'new', 'life', 'Only', 'now', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'feel', 'can', 'play', 'active', 'role', 'life', 'daugther', 'trying', 'prevent', 'marriage', 'simple', 'life', 'very', 'common', 'midwestern', 'generation', 'who', 'approaching', 'retirement', 'today.Schmidt', 'only', 'outlet', 'one', 'shall', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'chance', 'truly', 'express', 'how', 'considering', 'completely', 'wife', 'granted', '42', 'years', 'marriage', 'good', 'way', 'communicating', 'how', 'feels.Do', 'attempts', 'fail', 'succeed', 'preventing', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'shall', 'not', 'tell', 'will', 'say', 'experiences', 'meeting', 'family', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'interesting', 'depicting', 'dysfunctional', 'environment', 'family', 'very', 'normal.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'midwest', 'film', 'might', 'seem', 'obscure', ""'re"", 'retired', 'might', 'hit', 'home', 'just', 'watch', 'see', 'great', 'acting', 'learn', 'maybe', 'good', 'not', 'take', 'life', 'granted']",N/A
605901,A1QFH9H4VN0QJ5,B00005JLSK,"""hammershu""","[6, 7]","When this movie first came out, there were only two reasons that caught my attention and interest to it.  It starred the brilliant Jack Nicholson and was directed by the same intelligent director of Election (incredible movie).  After seeing the movie in the theater, I walked out with a sense of satisfication and happiness to how good this movie really is.  The other day I was browsing through cdnow.com and was thinking about getting this dvd.  When I saw the average customer review and some of the pathetic reviews from some vididiots (people who dont know a good movie from a bad one), I had to write a review to support this movie.  This movie is beautifully made in all aspects of film.  The script is phenomenal.  Some may say it's boring, but what it's doing is portraying everyday life conversation.  This movie is so real and not dopped up on Hollywood paparazzi.  So, if you think the script is boring, then your conversation in everyday life is equally not entertaining to watch because this script is as real as life.  The acting is superb.  As others say, the movie would be uncared for if Jack Nicholson didnt play the very dim-witted Warren Schmidt.  That statement obviously true.  He Schmidt with such reality and truth that you feel as if it's the 66-year old man that lives down the street from you.  Kathy Bates is also fantastic. She acts in one of her best roles ever.  Now about the movie.  Let's be honest, the movie is slow.  No getting around it.  This is a slow movie that is not for everyone.  The movie is so real it pains me to think about retirement.  Warren Schmidt has just retired and the problem is, he has always cared about financial problems and his job his entire life that he wonders what kind of difference or influence he will have on someone's life after he dies.  It is a question we will all ask when the time comes and we can only home we have made a difference in someone's life.  The movie is very creative and I give props to the director for making a movie so different from what we Americans see at the movie theater.  This movie is also very funny.  Now I'm warning you: this is not a stupid comedy.  The humor is very clever and witty.  It is not spoon-fed to you like many other comedies in America, such as any Adam Sandler movie (except for Punch-Drunk Love.  Another brilliant movie).  You have to go into this movie knowing it's not a fast-paced action movie.  This movie is not going to use a lot of cheap stupid gags to get you to laugh.  If you go into the movie knowing that, you will come out satisfied with no regrets.  I fear this is why some people didn't appreciate this movie.  We have been watching movies for so long that have a crumy plot, pointless action, and stupid comedy, that we have grown numb to tell the difference between a good movie from a bad one.  Film is a work of art.  A truely good film will give you a fantastic script and thoughtful characters along with the use of all aspects of film including specific camera shots to portray a meaning (&quot;The Graduate&quot;).  These seperate the good movies from the bad ones.

Well, watch it I did (all of it).This Schmiddy thing is b o r i n g.  It's one of those films that tries to be clever for the sake of being clever.  You can't miss it really.  I can't tell you how many times I shouted out loud, &quot;look how clever this film is!&quot;, but it was a bunch of times and usually had something to do with the camera focusing on inanimate objects or overemphasing certain sounds (if you don't believe me, just keep replaying the scene with the vacuum cleaner over and over and over again.  Clever I tell ya!  And artsy).  I couldn't really help thinking the filmmaker wanted everyone watching the film to be impressed with this aspect of it.  I found it distracting, which was alright since just about nothing else happens in the Schmidty thing.Basically, you get some really good acting from some top-notch folks (Nicholson is perfect and Bates is good as well) trying to tell the far-too common story about a wasted life and how one, slighly insane (face it, the Schmidt character is a not quite right) old guy deals with it.  And you get this Schmidt for over two hours.  As I said it's boring.  There are no chase scenes, some frightening partial nudity, a few curse words, and no action.  Zip.  There's very little dialogue either except for some notes written to a starving kid with a hard to pronounce name.  In essense, you have a book on tape that's on film.  Artsy.  Boring.

Married for 42 years, retiring as an executive from a company he's been with forever. His only daughter getting married. And all the wheels are falling off. Like most American males, Schmidt IS what his job declares him to be. After retirement he finds he isn't needed - despite the flowery retirement speeches on his value and contribution. His wife dies suddenly. He is alone in the big house he and his wife occupied during the pursuit of the American dream.Schmidt decides to drive his Winnebago to see his daughter for her marriage. He is searching for someone, anyone to acknowledge that he is needed.Anyone going through major life changes - what used to be called &quot;the mid-life crazies&quot; - should be able to identify with Schmidt.As for entertainment value of the movie, you'll either love or hate &quot;About Schmidt&quot;.

605905,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B00005JLSK,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[3, 4]","Earlier last evening, I saw Alexander Payne's new movie, ""About Schmidt,"" which opened in the Philadelphia area this Friday.  I have been hearing about it since its limited run began, particularly on talk radio, and some of the callers have dismissed it as ""what happens when Hollywood makes fun of Midwesterners and Midwestern values.""  Well, there's some of that in there, but I don't see the source so much as Hollywood, as much as a dead-on self-critique and self-reflection that could have only come from screenwriters who themselves are part and parcel of the Midwest Plains states.  Payne and co-scenarist Jim Taylor (who also co-wrote ""Citizen Ruth"" and ""Election"") have made a masterpiece of a character study in finding out what makes the stoic and enigmatic Warren Schmidt tick.When I was in high school, I had an English teacher who introduced me to a writer who would become my favorite novelist, Sinclair Lewis.  To me, ""Main Street,"" ""Babbitt,"" and ""Arrowsmith"" accurately captured the plain-spokenness and dry humor of the region, through Lewis' naturalistic writing style.  But Lewis was more than a recorder of the everyday people around him, he was a master of keen observation, and seeing the quirky denizens of Zenith and Gopher Prairie through his words filled me as a reader with the sense of what I call the ""inner adventure.""What Lewis had going for him as a novelist, I see in Payne's movies:  The same sense of wry observation, absurd humor that arises out of awkward and painful situations, and biting social commentary that never wallows into the territory of judgmental didacticism.  To me, Jack Nicholson's Warren Schmidt is, like Carol Kennicott of ""Main Street,"" an angry loner, who is dissatisfied with the world around him.  But, whereas ""Main Street"" follows Carol out of college and into a stifling marriage -- in which she can only survive by suppressing her innate sense of romanticism and adventurism -- ""About Schmidt"" catches its tragicomic hero at the tail end of his life, after decades of lonely emotional withholding have dried up the once puissant earnestness and ambition he once had.  He lives his life, as Thoreau penned, ""in quiet desperation.""I agree with many people, however, who have said ""I don't know what to make of this movie"";  Not that I don't know what to make of it, but I agree that *they* don't.  There are many times when Nicholson just keeps a stiff upper lip, and tries to sail through awkward situations by responding with pained silence.  And, although some genuine humor came out of some of those scenes (e.g., scene in the trailer, scene in the hot tub), many of the theatergoers in attendance laughed at each and every one of his silences, as if on cue, or as if waiting or expecting to be cued.  It is something I first picked up on when seeing ""Vertigo"" at an Austin theater a few years ago, that people break out into nervous laughter during awkward or silent moments.  It is a discomforting thing for people to have to face, and stirs the reflexive reaction of the viewer to equally awkward giggling or laughter, rather than having to face the protagonist's silence with their own.  Of course, as allegedly ""passive"" participants, it is unintentional on their part.  Yes, the ending to the movie was a poignant and cathartic moment, but it is the one moment when catharsis is permitted the viewer, inasmuch as we the viewers are handed a veritable table of permissible emotions.  Up to that point, Schmidt is a repressor, and likewise viewers repress any honest emotional response to his character.  That's where Payne really got his point across, in spades;  It was just as interesting listening to their reactions as it was watching Payne's characters on the screen acting out theirs.As for the movie as a whole, I enjoyed it thoroughly, and was both entertained and enlightened.  The supporting cast was excellent, though two-dimensional.  This is by design, because we are viewing these offbeat people through the subjective eyes of Warren Schmidt.  Dermot Mulroney as the loutish, Amway-pushing son-in-law-to-be is perfect casting, with his annoying ponytailed mullet and cheesy goatee.  Howard Hesseman and Kathy Bates also liven the cast with their aging-hippie-cum-white-trash characterizations.I especially enjoyed the hot tub scene with a nude Kathy Bates.  It took a lot of courage for Payne to do that, because Bates is overweight, aging and doesn't fit the image what the fashionistas tell us is beautiful. But lemme tell ya, she is one beautiful woman, and exudes so much self-assuredness and expressiveness.  I hope some able sculptor poses her for a Venus statue.  It would be much more alluring and fascinating than one of any of the current crop of pubebots People magazine tries to ram down our throats.Another nice touch is using Erik Satie's ""Three Pieces in the Shape of a Pear"" as part of the soundtrack.  Any other director would have used something more obvious, such as Debussy or even Chopin to convey the overwhelming sense of solitude and irresolution.  Satie's music melds seamlessly and beautifully with Nicholson's onscreen solitary wanderlust.""About Schmidt"" is not Alexander Payne's funniest movie (""Election"" wins that, hands down) nor is it his most satirical (""Citizen Ruth"" pushes the envelope a lot farther than this one).  However, through Warren Schmidt's journey into the undiscovered self, Payne has crafted a masterpiece of understated comedic drama on par with Woody Allen's ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" or Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore.""",5,Alexander Payne's Dramatic Masterpiece,1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,5552,"['Earlier', 'last', 'evening', 'saw', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'new', 'movie', 'Schmidt', 'opened',

605906,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JLSK,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[9, 12]","This film is a real feast of pleasure. Jack Nicholson is outstanding in the composition of his role and is marvelously seconded by Kathy Bates and other younger actors. The film is also fascinating due to its concentration on an essential moment in life for a man. His retirement and the quick loss of his wife, leaving him a young recently-retired widower. Some particular problems are explored with tact and truthfulness. His relation to his daughter at this moment, especially in the face of her marrying someone he considers as unfit. He will try to prevent it and yet will yield gracefully and in style. This conflict will bring up the difference between his vision of his daughter as a goddess in his life and the daughter's resentment at her father about his relation to her mother who happens to be his wife. What a man, an old man has in his mind does not always correspond to reality. Little by little he thus discovers that life was not what he thought it was and hoped it to be. He was retired by his firm and discarded, with nice words, by his successor as well as by the firm itself. He does not count any more. His wife had had an affair, some twenty-five years ago, with his best friend and superior in the firm. Thus he is led into going on a nostalgic trip, at first, across the US, but this trip becomes an initiation to solitude and to the awareness that should be his in a world that does not exactly correspond to his vision and desire. He thus learns, under the stars and in the night, all by himself and alone, how to cope with these necessary adjustments. And he does it marvelously. But in this epiphanic journey he is helped by the relation he voluntarily starts with a young African boy in Tanzania that he takes under his patronage for 22 dollars a month. This relation, and the drawing this child will send him, after his numerous and very personal letters, will make him realise that life demands a connection between him and someone else, and that this connection is in no way written down or programed in the big book of society. It can neither come from the past, nor from the immediate present of the people he meets along the way. It has to come from a wilful choice and action to help someone and not just to confide and submit or take. This help, and the hope that comes along with it, is the key to a balanced life after retiring, after entering old age solitude. Jack Nicholson is a marvelous actor in this part and does not in any way fall in the trap of his too common tricks : he does not look at all paranoid or psychotic or in any way deranged. He looks normal, banal, close to us, typical of what such people can be and actually are : definitely not a man who enters a phase of ranting and raving, of obsession and mental hyperventilation.

605908,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B00005JLSK,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[3, 3]","Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) is a man who's always wanted to accomplish more in life, but now he finds himself retiring from a dead end job having made no difference in the world around him. One day, on a whim, Warren calls Childreach and ""adopts"" an African orphan named Ndugu, who Warren uses as a sounding board to let out his feelings concerning what he feels is his wasted life. Shortly after his retirement, Warren's wife, Helen (June Squibb), dies reminding Warren of just how much he needed her. On his way to his daughter, Jeannie's (Hope Davis) wedding Warren takes a soul searching road trip in his RV before trying to convince his daughter to not marry the waterbed salesman (Dermot Mulroney) she's currently engaged to.Before winning the adapted screenwriting Oscar for his wine country dramedy, Sideways, and after his nomination for the excellent Election, Alexandar Payne cowrote and directed this underrated dramedy with his oft-writing partner Jim Taylor. Overshadowed by a notorious nude scene by Kathy Bates in the late second act of the movie, it's often forgotten that Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates were both nominated for Oscars and Jack Nicholson won a Golden Globe for best performance by an actor in a drama (to which Nicholson said during his acceptance speech, ""I'm a little surprised, I thought we had made a comedy""). First picking up this movie I can't really say that I knew what to expect going in, but that's also part of what made me pick up this movie in the first place.What I got, for all the fuss about Kathy Bates, was a poignant character study about a very ordinary man in his 60's. I'm sure a lot of people don't feel the same way, after all some of Warren's actions are deplorable, but he's a very human character. He's an ordinary man who wants to be extraordinary about him, and so inside he pines to make a difference in the world. The movie does a great job, as well as Nicholson playing the role to a tee, of showing a man that even at his happiest carries around the weight of never having accomplished anything in his life to be proud of as he also confronts his own mortality. In the end the movie reminds us that we don't have to do big great things to make a difference in the world, though, even small gestures can make the world around us a better place.While in the end the overall message of the movie can be considered slightly corny, I still have to say that I recommend this movie. At times it's quite funny, and the acting is phenomenal. Even with a corny message, which does not overbear the plot or tone of the movie, sometimes we do need to be reminded of these things at times. Give it a try, if you like Payne's other films like Sideways and Election you'll probably enjoy this, and it's also one of Nicholson's best later career performances.4/5",4,About Schmidt,1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,2817,"['Warren', 'Schmidt', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'wanted', 'accomplish', 'more', 'life', 'now', 'retiring', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'having', 'made', 'difference', 'world', 'One', 'day', 'whim', 'Warren', 'Childreach', 'adopts', 'African', 'orphan', 'named', 'Ndugu', 'who', 'Warren', 'sounding', 'board', 'let', 'out', 'feelings', 'concerning', 'what', 'wasted', 'life', 'Shortly', 'retirement', 'Warren', 'wife', 'Helen', 'June', 'Squibb', 'reminding', 'Warren', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'needed', 'way', 'daughter', 'Jeannie', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'wedding', 'Warren', 'soul', 'searching', 'road', 'trip', 'RV', 'trying', 'convince', 'daughter', 'not', 'marry', 'waterbed', 'salesman', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'currently', 'engaged', 'to.Before', 'winning', 'adapted', 'screenwriting', 'Oscar', 'wine', 'country', 'dramedy', 'Sideways', 'nomination', 'excellent', 'Election', 'Alexandar', 'Payne', 'cowrote', 'directed', 'underrated', 'dramedy', 'oft-writing', 'partner', 'Jim', 'Taylor', 'Overshadowed', 'notorious', 'nude', 'scene', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'late', 'second', 'act', 'movie', 'often', 'forgotten', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'best', 'performance', 'actor', 'drama', 'Nicholson', 'said', 'acceptance', 'speech', ""'m"", 'little', 'surprised', 'thought', 'had', 'made', 'comedy', 'First', 'picking', 'up', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'going', 'also', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'first', 'place.What', 'got', 'fuss', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'was', 'poignant', 'character', 'study', 'very', 'ordinary', 'man', '60', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'Warren', 'actions', 'are', 'deplorable', 'very', 'human', 'character', 'ordinary', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'extraordinary', 'so', 'make', 'difference', 'world', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'Nicholson', 'playing', 'role', 'tee', 'showing', 'man', 'even', 'happiest', 'weight', 'never', 'having', 'accomplished', 'anything', 'life', 'be', 'proud', 'also', 'own', 'mortality', 'end', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'big', 'great', 'things', 'make', 'difference', 'world', 'even', 'small', 'gestures', 'can', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place.While', 'end', 'overall', 'message', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'slightly', 'corny', 'still', 'have', 'say', 'recommend', 'movie', 'times', 'quite', 'funny', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'Even', 'corny', 'message', 'not', 'overbear', 'plot', 'tone', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'do', 'be', 'reminded', 'things', 'times', 'Give', 'try', 'like', 'Payne', 'other', 'films', 'Sideways', 'Election', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'also', 'one', 'Nicholson', 'best', 'later', 'career', 'performances.4/5']",N/A

He plays a character that has some of his typical Jack-isms, but this is a very solid, complete portrayal of Warren Schmidt that the performance is one of the best of the year.About Schmidt opens with Warren Schmidt finally retiring from his job at age 66.  He tries to settle into his life as a retired man but realizes that there is nothing fulfilling for him whatsoever.  Watching the television one night, Warren decides to sponsor a child.  This movie is a black comedy, so the humor is kind of underhanded and is more of a real life humor than anything outrageously funny.  The scenes that made me laugh were mostly Warren writing to the child that he sponsors.  Instead of writing a normal letter to a child, he writes rants on his life and on his family.  He yells, he complains and in the process we are given Warren's entire outlook on his life without having to resort to cheap flashbacks or weak exposition.  This was perfectly done and was a real treat to watch and listen to Warren write the letters.Warren's daughter, Jeannie (Hope Davis) is marrying a man that Warren does not approve of.  Randall (Dermot Mulroney) is the groom to be, and sporting a mullet he appears to be a perfect rednecked hick.  He is a sensitive momma's boy, though and is deeply caring about his family, especially his mother.  Randall's mother, Roberta (Kathy Bates) is a very down to earth, open, and free spirited woman.Warren's wife dies rather suddenly early in the movie and while Warren pretends that everything is fine, it is quite clear that things are falling apart.  He decides to drive (in a very big Winnebago) a bit early to the wedding in Colorado.  It isn't until quite late in the movie before Warren ever makes it to Roberta's house, but the entire movie is steeped in this slightly off beat humor.  At the same time, this is also a deeply sad movie that focuses on an empty man.One other thing to mention: the Katy Bates hot tub scene isn't as notable as some have suggested.  Yes, she gets naked.  You barely see her at all.  If this wasn't made such a big deal of, it wouldn't even be worth mentioning.  It fits perfectly with her character and in the movie and nothing more than that.Directed by Alexander Payne (Election), this is one of the better movies of 2002.  I don't think that I would call this the best of the year, but it is an award worthy film and is worth checking out.

605920,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00005JLSK,"John ""MovieAddict""","[3, 5]","""About Schmidt"" is a quirky, offbeat comedy about a man and his journey to find meaning to his life. Its name is true; ""About Schmidt"" is about...well...a man named Schmidt.Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) is your average Joe. Or, in this case, your average Warren. He lives a normal life. He has just retired at the age of sixty-seven, and he now stays at home with his wife, who Schmidt states he is growing tired of. He's tired of having to do everything his wife, Helen, tells him to do. He's tired of her cutting him off when he's talking. He's tired of the way she sits down. He's tired of the way she pulls out the keys to the car before they're even out the door. And he's tired of having to sit down when he goes to the bathroom.In a letter to Ntugu (his new ""adopted"" sponsor child), Warren spills his beans about life. That same day he comes home from mailing a letter to Ntugu, to find his wife, dead on the floor. We learn later that she died from a blood clot in her brain.Left on his own, Warren realizes how good his wife was, and how much he misses her. But then he finds out that twenty-five to thirty years ago she had an affair with an old friend of his, and in one of the most subtley funny moments in the film, dumps off her old belongings at a donation center.Warren, still missing his wife but truly bitter at what she did, eventually decides to go visit his daughter in the south, and packs up the 35-foot-long Winnebago with everything he needs. His daughter, who is about to be married to a complete loser, has different ideas, and tells Warren once he is on the road that it would be best if they stick to the plan and he comes down two days before the wedding. Left with about a week before the wedding, Warren takes a road trip back down memory lane. He visits his old childhood home - which is now a tire store. ""This is where the bedroom would've been,"" he tells a clerk, who looks on in awe.After that, Warren one way or another ends up eating dinner with a couple from the RV park he's staying in. When the husband goes out to get more beer, the woman says that she sees a sad, sad man in Warren. Afraid and angry.Once Warren arrives for the wedding, he realizes that his daughter is happy with the man she is about to marry, no matter how much of a loser he is. And in a scene that could have been played for laughs but wasn't (which is good in this case, making deep characters instead of flimsy ones), Warren makes a toast to his daughter and her new husband.And then Warren goes home. It's the end of the movie already. Not much has happened, and Warren tells Ntugu that his life has no point. His life has no meaning. Why go on? But then he gets a letter, and in the sense of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" Warren sees the meaning in his life.""About Schmidt"" isn't for everyone. People that cannot tolerate slow-moving films should not see this. Those that cannot appreciate characters that are deep, but yet still funny, should not see this movie. If people want a Jack Nicholson movie played just for laughs, with your average characters, I recommend ""Anger Management."" But if you want a classic example of fine storytelling, see ""About Schmidt.""The characters are funny, but not outrageous. They are not there to make us laugh. They are there to preach something, much like in ""It's a Wonderful Life."" But they do make us laugh, in the little quirks of life. Things we all do. The first forty minutes of this movie is an absolute hoot, and those forty minutes are probably funnier than any movie you'll see this year. But not outwardly funny; like I said, this isn't an Adam Sandler movie. This is a realistic movie with realistic characters doing real things that are funny. It's a self-parody for all the viewers. The little quirks all the different characters have will either a) remind you of someone you know, or b) remind you of yourself.Jack Nicholson is an absolute stand-out in this movie. I can't see anyone else playing him quite as well as Nicholson. And I must admit that I've never been a real fan of Jack, either. But when he is on screen in this film, we see a sad, lonely, angry and afraid old man who is wondering through life, living each day, but not for any apparent reason.Alexander Payne has crafted a wonderful life-parody/drama here. I didn't expect this much from ""About Schmidt,"" but I sure did get more than I bargained for.

And there are some impressive bookends to his contributions to our culture (at least if you don't count the science fiction b/w movies he started out with).""Five Easy Pieces"" depicts a young man's rebellion and struggle to achieve intimacy.  A great trope of that movie was his ""dualogue"" with his demanding, artistic and remote father, who has been struck dumb by a disease.  So Nicholson talks to his non-replying dad, pouring out his issues and trying to gain an understanding.The Bucket List says that an old man, knowing that he is dying, can do the things he's always dreamed of, given the right combination of money and companionship.  A zest for living is the trope.Then there's this one.  Warren Schmidt has had no dreams.  He has managed his life rather than living it.  He had no expectations, but to sigh deeply at the demands of his job, his wife, his daughter.  Life for Warren is duty, not joy.  Do the right thing and do it carefully.  This path will provide its own reward.Then he loses his wife.  Then he confronts not only the loss of his daughter (which has already mostly occurred), but also her complete alienation (by the doing of Warren's duty to counsel her not to marry the man she loves).Warren's soliloquoy at the end completes the cycle started with ""Five Easy Pieces.""  Imagine the father in that film able to speak...here's what he would say...Someday soon, either in a few days or in twenty years, I will die.  When I'm gone and everyone who knew me is gone, it will be as though I never existed.It's enough to make a grown man cry, and he does, finally.Folks below debate whether this is drama, a melodrama, or a comedy.  If it must be anything, I'd call it a divine comedy.  Watch and laugh if you want, but you know you're just whistling past the graveyard.

605924,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JLSK,Joseph Haschka,"[3, 4]","The first scene in ABOUT SCHMIDT was, for me, the most powerful. Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson), on his very last day of a lifetime pushing paper for the Woodman Insurance Co., sits in his painfully barren office in an Omaha high rise watching the second hand of the wall clock tick down to 5:00 PM, at which time it will be quitting time - forever. Warren is retiring. As he walks out of his space for the final time, he looks back through the open door, hesitates, and then clicks off the light. His sense of loss and bewilderment is almost palpable.In a culture where who you are is generally the answer to the question ""What do you do?"", Schmidt is suddenly nobody. He has no hobbies, pets, or outside interests. Only a wife of 42 years, Helen (June Squibb), with whom he feels only a fading connection, and one good male pal, with whom he has an apocalyptic falling out. An example of Warren's biggest thrill of an empty day is a sundae at the local Dairy Queen. Sure, he's recently purchased, at Helen's urging, a 35-foot Winnebago in which they'll tour the country. She's enthused; he's not. But it shortly becomes a mute point as Helen abruptly dies soon into the film. At the funeral, Warren is joined by his semi-estranged daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) and her fiance Randall Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney), both over from Denver for the burial. Once they've returned to Colorado, Schmidt's appearance and lifestyle deteriorates. Then he decides to set out in the Winnebago for Denver, ostensibly to attend his daughter's nuptials, but also with the hope of talking her out of marrying the ""numbskull"".Jack Nicholson turns in perhaps one of his best roles playing a man desperately seeking meaning and stimulation in a barren existence, certainly at 180 degree from the actor's own life. And he stumbles across more stimulation than he wants with Roberta Hertzel (Kathy Bates), the divorced and unabashedly irrepressible mother of Randall, in a hot tub scene that is tribute to the healthy self-image and self-assurance of Ms. Bates. Davis and Mulroney are both good as Hope and Randall respectively, the former who has Warren as a perpetual source of exasperation, and the latter who would cause clinical depression in any prospective father-in-law. And, lo and behold, there's Howard Hesseman as Larry, Randall's natural father.

Also, the movie portraits something not everybody is conscious about: life for older people. What to do when you think there's not much life in your life? Nicholson, in my opinion a young guy of 67, is very convinving as Schmidt, an old guy of 67. More, Nicholson transmits through the screen the immesurable sadness within Schmidt. The only flaw in Nicholson's performance is that Schmidt's voice tone and speed, his way of walking and the way he keeps rubbing his hands are much alike ""As good as it gets"" 's Melvin Udall.Also good performances by Hope Davis and Dermott Mulroney, but especially a great performance by Kathy Bates, including a nude scene(!).Director Payne is competent without trying to make an accrobatic direction: the movie is plain and quiet as Schmidt's late life.

Jack Nicholson is brilliant in the role of Warren Schmidt and we were not disappointed in his acting at all.  In fact, Kathy Bates was also very good as the mother of the future son-in-law. The cast did a great job, but the story was dismal and almost seemed like a documentary of a man who really didn't have much happiness or joy in his life.The story is exactly what the title says, about  Schmidt, who retires at the age of sixty-six from his job as an actuary for an insurance company. It's quite obvious that the job was his life. Schmidt is a bland, but seemingly pleasant man. His wife is a bossy drudge who rules the roost.  They live in the Midwest.  Their only daughter (Hope Davis) lives in Denver and is engaged to (Dermot Mulroney) a man who is not terribly bright, but seems sweet.  He is hopeless in the career department and Schmidt feels that his daughter is marrying beneath her.  They don't see the daughter too often, but her father is subsidizing her, and he sends her a monthly check. When Schmidt's wife dies shortly after he retires, his world falls apart even more. He attempts to visit his daughter before her upcoming wedding, but she tells him that she's too busy to see him.After watching a television commercial for an agency that helps needy children, Schmidt signs up and receives a photograph and information about Naugu, a six year old boy who lives in Africa. He begins writing letters to Naugu and from the letters comes the story of Schmidt and how he really feels about his life and family. The letters are the most creative and best part of the storyline.If you want to see Jack Nicholson in a fine performance, see this film, but know that this tedious story is not going to do much to make you feel good about growing older or life in general..",3,--Three Stars for Nicholson and the cast--,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,1974,"['ABOUT', 'SCHMIDT', 'tops', 'list', 'depressing', 'movies.I', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'months', 'husband', 'chose', 'watch', 'thinking', 'was', 'comedy', 'anything', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'acting', 'fact', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'mother', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'cast', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'story', 'was', 'dismal', 'almost', 'seemed', 'documentary', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'happiness', 'joy', 'life.The', 'story', 'exactly', 'what', 'title', 'Schmidt', 'who', 'age', 'sixty-six', 'job', 'actuary', 'insurance', 'company', 'quite', 'obvious', 'job', 'was', 'life', 'Schmidt', 'bland', 'seemingly', 'pleasant', 'man', 'wife', 'bossy', 'drudge', 'who', 'rules', 'roost', 'live', 'Midwest', 'only', 'daughter', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Denver', 'engaged', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'terribly', 'bright', 'sweet', 'hopeless', 'career', 'department', 'Schmidt', 'feels', 'daughter', 'marrying', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'daughter', 'too', 'often', 'father', 'subsidizing', 'monthly', 'check', 'When', 'Schmidt', 'wife', 'shortly', 'world', 'apart', 'even', 'more', 'visit', 'daughter', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'too', 'busy', 'see', 'him.After', 'watching', 'television', 'commercial', 'agency', 'needy', 'children', 'Schmidt', 'signs', 'up', 'photograph', 'information', 'Naugu', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'Africa', 'writing', 'letters', 'Naugu', 'letters', 'story', 'Schmidt', 'how', 'really', 'life', 'family', 'letters', 'are', 'most', 'creative', 'best', 'part', 'storyline.If', 'want', 'see', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'fine', 'performance', 'see', 'film', 'know', 'tedious', 'story', 'not', 'going', 'do', 'much', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'growing', 'older', 'life', 'general..']",N/A

605935,ABQPBY4VNK40Y,B00005JLSK,Karl Flaig,"[0, 0]","With writer director Alexander Payne About Schmidt held a bit of promise, even if it's saddled with over-actor extraordinaire Jack Nicholson. Knowing Jack's in the film, I approached it with more than a bit of trepidation. Lets be serious, Jack hasn't legitimately acted in well over a decade. Since the late 80's his ""characterizations"" have consisted of little more than mugging for the camera, raising an eyebrow and bellowing all sorts of un-PC things. From Batman to As Good As It Gets Jack exists on film to collect paychecks (and wink at the stupidity of Americans who still pay for his films).Director and writer Alexander Payne helmed a delicious dark comedy several years back, Election. That film, along with the little seen though utterly perverse and outrageously funny Freeway helped really launch Reese Witherspoon in my eyes. Guess ole Jack decided if Payne's quirky/acerbic take on the world could legitimize Witherspoon, maybe the director could do the same for the once great actor.Payne's new film involves Warren Schmidt (Nicholson), a recent retiree who now finds himself at a loss for meaning in his life. Truth be told not much existed prior to his retirement. After the event Warren's left with a wife he doesn't really have much in common with, a horrid, evil bitchy daughter on the verge of marriage and no life to speak of in any fashion. Worst of all, he's trapped in the Midwest! Warren's the epitome of every person's darkest nightmare life.Through a series of events Warren winds up traveling across the country in a new RV en route to his shrill daughter's wedding. Throughout the journey Warren pens pithy letters to a little boy he's sponsoring via one of those asinine Sally Struthers type feed the starving kids programs. The letters provide most of the film's comic relief and give an even more thorough view into Warren's simple mind. By the end of the film we know Warren probably better than he even knows himself. Great writing makes you pause and wonder why more filmmakers don't take the time to create fully realized people to populate a film.So About Schmidt's the bomb and that's that, right? No. Payne's written a nice little film and he infuses so much into Warren that many secondary characters end up as stereotypes. Also Warren's relationships to some of these characters - specifically his wench daughter - leave a weird sensation. Also, the film, while meant to be a meandering journey for the star dilly-dallies too much and drags at times. Furthermore, the film ends, as it logically should; however, the ending only offers viewers a sense of relief that they're not living Warren's life. This isn't the sort of plucky film you rewatch.Nicholson banishes almost all of his annoying crowd-pleasing antics and provides the most fully portrayed character of his career. He's not Jack. He's Warren. Through and through, we're seeing Warren Schmidt. From the shuffle to the dazed look to the inability to physically relate to his surroundings, Jack nails Warren so precisely it's shocking. Given the man's propensity for not acting, it's a revelation to see him really dig into this meaty personage.Kathy Bates and Dermot Mulroney seem to enjoy themselves immensely sloshing around in paper-thin role. These two great character actors steal scenes left and right with little tricks. Too bad they don't get better roles though.On the flip side, the poor man's Helen Hunt, Hope Davis delivers yet another screeching performance. Why does Davis 99% of the time make her characters sound, move and react in exactly the same manner. You can plop any Davis character (with the exception of Next Stop Wonderland) into any film with her and there will be no difference because she has zero range. Davis, like Hunt, plays mean.

The least that the writers of this film could have done is to give him a chance to use what he's got.  Yes, he's made the best of the script that he's been handed, and given us a very believable character, but his efforts are unfortunately overtaken by the lack of writing efforts that seem to have gone into (or not gone into) this movie.I was so amazed at the huge chunks of silence throughout the film, that I found myself being able to watch huge sections of this movie at 2X speed, and reading the subtitles.  Fearing I might have actually missed something, I occasionally went back and watched these sections in real time...and was rewarded with the knowledge that I hadn't missed anything...except the silence.  I'm confused as to whether this was intended to represent the character's reflection on his predicament, or provide me time to reflect how I got into the predicament of watching this movie.  The scenery and locations were nice, and very well filmed.  The direction seemed to get everything out of the actors you would expect.  And the story even seemed like it could work at times.  But overall, this movie was a general loser.  Even the ending, which was very predictable, doesn't play as well as similar endings in other films.If you're a hard-core Nicholson fan, and absolutely have to see it in order to complete your viewing catalog, fine.  But if you are looking for a good movie, this isn't it.  In fact, it's incredibly boring, and not at all worth the time.

605937,A2OF0Z2L9STEQF,B00005JLSK,Kevin Caffrey,"[5, 6]","Alexander Payne made one of the best films of the 90s with ""Election.""  ""About Schmidt"" feels very much like ""Election"" for an older crowd.  Jack Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt, a just-retired 66 year old who must face life alone after his wife of 42 years suddenly dies.  Having difficulty coping with everything from shopping to making lunch to keeping the house clean, Schmidt decides to travel from Nebraska to Denver in his Winnebago in order to stop his daughter from marrying a goodnatured ""nincompoop.""Payne's strength lies in making characters very realistic, much moreso than you will see in most Hollywood movies.  He doesn't disappoint here.  Schmidt is a sad man that feels as if his life has led up to nothing.  Things have frustrated him for years, but remaining silent about them for so long has rendered him almost completely ineffectual.  The one outlet he is able to use to vent his frustrations is in the letters he begins to write to his 6-year old adopted Tanzanian son, Ndugo.  In a role unlike nearly all of his others, Nicholson makes Schmidt a sympathetic loser that nearly everyone will be able to relate to.  All of the supporting actors do very good jobs in their quirky, yet realistic roles.  These are people that you know, as opposed to Hollywood's tendency to write characters that could only be found in a movie.  The only weak part of the film is a few scenes of Schmidt ""high"" on Percodan, that feels a little too over the top for this film.  However, Payne has gotten Nicholson to do many things in this movie that he has never done before, so I can't say I blame him for letting the cameras roll a little longer on things that might've been left better left out of the movie.Although very funny in parts, ""About Schmidt"" is a sad, reflective movie.  It will undoubtedly make you question your own place in life and the effect that you have on others as well as the effect you have on the world in the grand scheme of things.  Unfortunately, the DVD does not have a Director's commentary, which would've been great for this movie.  It does offer an extended series of deleted scenes with written introductions by Payne.

605938,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B00005JLSK,Kevin F. Tasker,"[1, 2]","About Schmidt is a well-executed, if overlong dark comedy chartering the decline and spiritual rebirth of the titular curmudgeon. Jack Nicholson is empathetic as Warren Schmidt, a disenchanted recent-retiree whose daughter is marrying a daft pony-tailed mama's boy and whose whose sole enjoyment seems to be had imparting wisdom (and sharing more than few rants) with a small boy in Africa. Nicholson's narration of letters he composes and presumably sends across the sea is perfect, comic and depressing in equal measure. The film teeters at times between slow meandering and genius scenes. Nicholson spends a bit too much time at Kathy Bates' house late in the film, for instance, and a little too much time preparing to go on the road. The first and third act of the film are enormously entertaining, particularly an early montage (signaling the first, and most detailed letter to Nicholson's pen-pal/surrogate son). Though it occasionally feels plodding and detached, About Schmidt manages to balance its pallor with spot-on examinations of married life, family life, and getting up and over the hill. Alexander Payne proves that he can push through spells of disillusionment, locating beautiful truths lurking amid all the grey thoughts and surface tension.",3,Long though endearing,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,1262,"['Schmidt', 'well-executed', 'overlong', 'dark', 'comedy', 'chartering', 'decline', 'spiritual', 'rebirth', 'titular', 'curmudgeon', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'empathetic', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'disenchanted', 'recent-retiree', 'daughter', 'marrying', 'daft', 'pony-tailed', 'mama', 'boy', 'sole', 'enjoyment', 'be', 'had', 'imparting', 'wisdom', 'sharing', 'more', 'few', 'rants', 'small', 'boy', 'Africa', 'Nicholson', 'narration', 'letters', 'presumably', 'sends', 'sea', 'perfect', 'comic', 'depressing', 'equal', 'measure', 'film', 'teeters', 'times', 'slow', 'meandering', 'genius', 'scenes', 'Nicholson', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'house', 'late', 'film', 'instance', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'preparing', 'go', 'road', 'first', 'third', 'act', 'film', 'are', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'particularly', 'early', 'montage', 'signaling', 'first', 'most', 'detailed', 'letter', 'Nicholson', 'pen-pal/surrogate', 'son', 'occasionally', 'plodding', 'detached', 'Schmidt', 'manages', 'balance', 'pallor', 'spot-on', 'examinations', 'married', 'life', 'family', 'life', 'getting', 'up', 'hill', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'can', 'push', 'spells', 'disillusionment', 'locating', 'beautiful', 'truths', 'lurking', 'grey', 'thoughts', 'surface', 'tension']",N/A

He is very good in this role and I also enjoyed Kathy Bates as his free-thinking future in-law.The drawback to this movie is that it is about a common man to whom nothing very interesting happens.

605945,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00005JLSK,Larry VanDeSande,"[3, 5]","The seeming Jack Nicholson character study, ""About Schmidt"", is actually a film about possibilities that approaches the most profound questions about life from the perspective of the Schmidt character. These questions include: Why am I here? What is my role? Do I make a difference?In the beginning of the film it is clear Nicholson's character has never asked these questions. A retired insurance actuary, his life has been managed by a dictatorial wife. She so controlled him he could not urinate at home without sitting down.When his wife suddenly dies, Schmidt's character is seemingly cast into a life of chaos. His home becomes a pig sty, his life order is gone, and all the rules he once lived by now seem abandoned. He later learns the staid predicatble life he enjoyed with his wife wasn't all that staid and predictable -- when he finds her old letters to his best friend that verify the affair the pair had during their marriage.With his life now is near complete disarray, Schmidt's attempt to play a larger role in his adult daughter's life is met with only tepid welcome. When he tries to tell her she's marrying the wrong man, she rejects his help.Schmidt's life becomes one of meandering to old haunts and new horizons. He travels repetedly in a Winnebago, looking at places and things he'd never seen before. Among the many new things he tries during this period of liberation is to give money to an organization that supports children in other nations. Through this he establishes a correspondence with a young African boy.When Schmidt returns from his daughter's faraway wedding, dejected that she rebuffed the help he offered as a loving parent, he sits in his world of emptiness and rejection. It is this time when Schmidt finally poses the question everyone asks in life: Why am I here? What difference do I make? If I die, does it matter that I ever lived?He resolves this in a way you may enjoy. My single complaint about this film is it took so long for Schmidt to come to this point and ask the $64,000 questions.

605946,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JLSK,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This film is about Warren Schmidt, a Nebraskan in his mid sixties, who is newly retired from his job as assistant vice president for an insurance firm. He is clearly a man who is not in touch with his feelings or his life, living it by the book, so to speak. He is disconnected from the reality around him, living as unobtrusively as he can. This is evident right from the beginning of the film.His life really begins when he retires, as a series of life jarring changes occur. His wife of forty two years, Helen (June Squibb), suddenly dies. She is a domineering woman whom he loved on some level but for whom he was unable to express much feeling while she was still living, even though there were many things about her that irritated him. She, however, managed to have had a secret life of which he had not been a part. It seems that she was not all that satisfied with Schmidt, herself. It is an unwelcome surprise that colors his world when he discovers it but, at the same time, serves to begin to ease the pain of separation for him. There are some funny scenes that segue from this discovery.Their only child, Jeannie (Hope Davis), lives in Denver, Colorado and is about to get married to Randall Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney), a dimwitted, waterbed salesman whom Schmidt cannot abide. He learns some truths about the real status of his own relationship with his daughter, Jeannie, and it is not the idealized relationship that he thought he had. In fact, he learns just how disconnected he is from his daughter, who is really a veritable stranger to him, as was his wife. Moreover, not even his best friend, Ray (Lou Cariou), was whom Schmidt thought him to be.When Schmidt travels to Colorado for the wedding, he stays with the groom's mother, Roberta Hertzel, a much married, earthy, and passionate divorcee, who is comfortable with herself and not afraid to express her feelings. She is a sort of flower child/earth mother holdover from the late nineteen sixties, early seventies. She tries to make a connection with him but this proves to be too much for Schmidt, as he scurries for cover to the Winnebago in which he travels.Lacking an emotional connection with any other human being, Schmidt sponsors a six year old, Tanzanian child through a charitable agency, and begins sending him letters, detailing his life as he sees it. It is more of a catharsis for Schmidt, rather than an attempt at real communication with a child. This contrivance also serves to tell the viewer just how Schmidt perceives his life. When he receives a letter with something the child has sent him, the idea that someone has actually thought of him opens the emotional floodgates for Schmidt and unleashes all those repressed feelings of anger, sadness, loss, pain, suffering, in one fell swoop.Jack Nicholson gives an excellent performance as the repressed Midwesterner who only begins to get in touch with his feelings the end of his life spectrum. He gives a good account of a man who is making his way in, what is for him, uncharted territory. Funny, poignant and sad, it is a performance that is well nuanced. June Squibb is perfectly cast in the role of the Helen, Schmidt's wife. Her apple cheeked countenance and dumpy, matronly look exemplify the stereotypic senior citizen housewife. Helen's penchant for order and cleanliness is brought home by Ms. Squibb's performance, and Helen fittingly dies while vacuuming the laundry room.Kathy Bates is wonderful as the somewhat bohemian, earth mother figure in the film. Her much talked about nude scene was natural and in keeping with her role. I applaud her courage in doing it, given the emphasis on thinness in Hollywood. While many reviled her for doing it, hers is a much more realistic reflection of what the body of a woman in her fifties or sixties actually looks like. Let me tell you, Jack Nicholson's body doesn't look much better either, but he was not reviled for it. There still continues to be a double standard for men and women, when it comes to excess avoirdupois.Dermot Mulroney is terrific as the sensitive, easy going groom to be who seems to lack the full quid. Mulroney makes his character quite a likable one. Unfortunately, Hope Davis, as Jeannie Schmidt, serves to make her character a thoroughly unpleasant one. It is unclear, however, whether this was the intended effect. Howard Hesseman is wonderful as the groom's father, Larry Hertzel, and he gets a lot of mileage out of this bit part. Lou Cariou is excellent as Schmidt's erstwhile best friend, Ray.All in all, this a film well worth watching. The baby boomers out there should take note. It is still not too late to avoid ending up like Schmidt.",4,THE UNEXAMINED LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING...,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,4672,"['film', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'Nebraskan', 'mid', 'sixties', 'who', 'newly', 'retired', 'job', 'assistant', 'vice', 'president', 'insurance', 'firm', 'clearly', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'touch', 'feelings', 'life', 'living', 'book', 'so', 'speak', 'disconnected', 'reality', 'living', 'as', 'unobtrusively', 'can', 'evident', 'right', 'beginning', 'film.His', 'life', 'really', 'when', 'series', 'life', 'jarring', 'changes', 'occur', 'wife', 'forty', 'two', 'years', 'Helen', 'June', 'Squibb', 'suddenly', 'domineering', 'woman', 'whom', 'loved', 'level', 'whom', 'was', 'unable', 'express', 'much', 'feeling', 'was', 'still', 'living', 'even', 'were', 'many', 'things', 'irritated', 'however', 'managed', 'have', 'had', 'secret', 'life', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'satisfied', 'Schmidt', 'unwelcome', 'surprise', 'world', 'when', 'same', 'time', 'serves', 'begin', 'ease', 'pain', 'separation', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'segue', 'discovery.Their', 'only', 'child', 'Jeannie', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Denver', 'Colorado', 'about', 'get', 'married', 'Randall', 'Hertzel', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'dimwitted', 'waterbed', 'salesman', 'whom', 'Schmidt', 'can', 'not', 'abide', 'truths', 'real', 'status', 'own', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Jeannie', 'not', 'idealized', 'relationship', 'thought', 'had', 'fact', 'just', 'how', 'disconnected', 'daughter', 'who', 'really', 'veritable', 'stranger', 'was', 'wife', 'Moreover', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'friend', 'Ray', 'Lou', 'Cariou', 'was', 'whom', 'Schmidt', 'thought', 'be.When', 'Schmidt', 'travels', 'Colorado', 'wedding', 'groom', 'mother', 'Roberta', 'Hertzel', 'much', 'married', 'earthy', 'passionate', 'divorcee', 'who', 'comfortable', 'not', 'afraid', 'express', 'feelings', 'sort', 'flower', 'child/earth', 'mother', 'holdover', 'late', 'nineteen', 'sixties', 'early', 'seventies', 'make', 'connection', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'Schmidt', 'cover', 'Winnebago', 'travels.Lacking', 'emotional', 'connection', 'other', 'human', 'being', 'Schmidt', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'Tanzanian', 'child', 'charitable', 'agency', 'sending', 'letters', 'detailing', 'life', 'more', 'catharsis', 'Schmidt', 'rather', 'attempt', 'real', 'communication', 'child', 'contrivance', 'also', 'tell', 'viewer', 'just', 'how', 'Schmidt', 'life', 'When', 'letter', 'something', 'child', 'sent', 'idea', 'someone', 'actually', 'thought', 'emotional', 'floodgates', 'Schmidt', 'unleashes', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'anger', 'sadness', 'loss', 'pain', 'suffering', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'excellent', 'performance', 'repressed', 'Midwesterner', 'who', 'only', 'get', 'touch', 'feelings', 'end', 'life', 'spectrum', 'good', 'account', 'man', 'who', 'making', 'way', 'what', 'uncharted', 'territory', 'Funny', 'poignant', 'sad', 'performance', 'well', 'nuanced', 'June', 'Squibb', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'Helen', 'Schmidt', 'wife', 'apple', 'cheeked', 'countenance', 'dumpy', 'matronly', 'look', 'exemplify', 'stereotypic', 'senior', 'citizen', 'housewife', 'Helen', 'penchant', 'order', 'cleanliness', 'brought', 'home', 'Ms.', 'Squibb', 'performance', 'Helen', 'fittingly', 'vacuuming', 'laundry', 'room.Kathy', 'Bates', 'wonderful', 'somewhat', 'bohemian', 'earth', 'mother', 'figure', 'film', 'much', 'talked', 'nude', 'scene', 'was', 'natural', 'keeping', 'role', 'applaud', 'courage', 'doing', 'given', 'emphasis', 'thinness', 'Hollywood', 'many', 'reviled', 'doing', 'hers', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'reflection', 'what', 'body', 'woman', 'fifties', 'sixties', 'actually', 'Let', 'tell', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'body', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'better', 'either', 'was', 'not', 'reviled', 'still', 'be', 'double', 'standard', 'men', 'women', 'when', 'excess', 'avoirdupois.Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'terrific', 'sensitive', 'easy', 'going', 'groom', 'be', 'who', 'lack', 'full', 'quid', 'Mulroney', 'character', 'quite', 'likable', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Jeannie', 'Schmidt', 'make', 'character', 'thoroughly', 'unpleasant', 'one', 'unclear', 'however', 'was', 'intended', 'effect', 'Howard', 'Hesseman', 'wonderful', 'groom', 'father', 'Larry', 'Hertzel', 'lot', 'mileage', 'bit', 'part', 'Lou', 'Cariou', 'excellent', 'Schmidt', 'erstwhile', 'best', 'friend', 'Ray.All', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'baby', 'out', 'there', 'should', 'take', 'note', 'still', 'not', 'too', 'late', 'avoid', 'ending', 'up', 'Schmidt']",N/A

For years we've seen him play charismatic roles, with an energy that just leaps from the screen.  In this role, however, he's cast as Warren Schmidt, a colorless retiree with an awkward gait and a withdrawn personality.When his wife dies suddenly, Schmidt is left floundering.  He's lonely and bored and depressed.  His only outlet seems to be the long letters he writes to an African child who he is sponsoring from a children's charity.  He spills out his guts to this child, as he gropes to make some sense out of his life.When he discovers an unhappy truth about his deceased wife, he is spurred into action and sets out on a journey, trying to go back to his childhood home but finding an America that is now mostly shopping malls.  Eventually, he gets to Denver, a few days before his daughter's wedding to a young man he considers a nincompoop. Kathy Bates is cast as the young man's mother and she, too, was nominated for an academy award for her performance.  She's a divorcee who can be warm and hospitable, but who can also be cruel and impatient with her ex-husband.  She's a product of &quot;new age&quot; thinking and, in one of the only real comical scenes of the film, Schmidt finds himself in a hot tub with her making romantic overtures to him.The film is slow, but that is in keeping with the theme.  The cinematography is excellent.

""Are my eyes deceiving me?"" I thought. ""This is Jack Nicholson, Hollywood satyr, squire of Lara Flynn Boyle, bad boy with a golf club!"" But then it dawned on me. No, this ISN'T Nicholson; this really is Schmidt, Warren Schmidt.Playing his real age, and not his PR reputation, Nicholson embodies a character who is finally coming to grips with his purpose in the universe. Having spent a lifetime in insurance, married to a woman who has become his jailer/nanny, Schmidt has played by the conventional rules. He put in his years on the job (valiantly staying until the stroke of Five on his final day)and has raised a daughter. Still, he wonders what is life all about.After his wife's unexpected, sudden death, he starts out on a road trip. Ostensibly, it's a way to get to his daughter's wedding in Colorado, an event that he bitterly opposes. Cinematically, it's a journey like the one that ""Harry & Tonto,"" ""Thelma & Louise,"" and the bikers from ""Easy Rider"" set off on. He's journeying outward to discover what's within.I know that sounds all ""hippie-dippy"" and New Age, but it isn't. The people that Schmidt encounters along his route to Denver teach him about his weaknesses, his flaws, and his lack of purpose. Ronald Reagan once joked that ""an unexamined life IS worth living."" No, not true at all.Schmidt considers his role in the world, and he faces down his moment of truth at his daughter's reception. Nicholson's performance as Schmidt trying to give a toast to his daughter's future, while simultaneously warning her about her impending doom, is beautiful and comical and uncomfortable to behold. It's perfect acting.The supporting players are all excellent. Kathy Bates nails her role as a woman who disports herself as though she were Cleopatra, a deluded would-be artist who thinks she is sophisticated and a siren. She's neither. She's bossy, loudmouthed, rude, and without boundaries.Hope Davis as Nicholson's daughter and the bride-to-be is not an object of sympathy. Though her father thinks she's selling herself short, her character seems determined (and happy) about becoming part of her new in-laws' clan. Dermot Mulroney (almost unrecognizable in his odd mullet hairstyle)is goofy, airheaded, a tad spaced-out, yet he truly loves his fiancee. He is also a huge proponent of self-help books and get-rich-quick schemes. Though he comes across as a T-shirted loser at first glance, there seems to be more to him beneath is button-down flannel shirt.A good film, a grand look at everyone who gets up in the morning and loses their way throughout the day--basically it's an examination of all of us. Does one life matter? Schmidt's recently acquired African orphan (""adopted"" through a TV Childreach advertisement) would say yes.

605953,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00005JLSK,Lleu Christopher,"[0, 1]","I call this movie a semi-comedy rather than a comedy-drama because I found the balance between satire and seriousness a little uneven. Unlike director Alexander Payne's earlier films, Election and Citizen Ruth  (both brilliant satires), About Schmidt comes across a little ambiguously. Many of the reviews for this film focus on Jack Nicholson's performance and what an achievement it is for him to play a downbeat character like retired insurance salesman Warren Schmidt. I agree that Nicholson gives a great performance, but we should consider the film on its own merits and not in comparison with other Nicholson roles. When Warren Schmidt's wife dies shortly after his retirement, the fabric of his life begins to unravel. Of course, he never had much to hold onto in the first place.  He reveals his thoughts through longwinded letters to an African boy he adopts by mail. It is unlikely anyone would write such letters, but that is the device the film uses to reveal the character to us. Schmidt's main concern after his wife's death is his daughter's  (played by Hope Davis) impending mariage to a man (Dermot Mulroney)  he believes is not worthy of her. He drives an enormous motor home to his daughter's home in Denver, having some misadventures along the way. Against a backdrop of a desolate Middle American landscape, we see Schmidt almost desperately trying to fill the void the absence of his wife and career has left him. The fact that neither his marriage nor his career were very fulfilling makes the scenario doubly sad. His interaction with his  wacky future in-laws  provides most of the film's comic elements. Mulroney is good as a salesman who tries to get Schmidt into a multi-level marketing scheme.  Kathy Bates is also amusing as Mulroney's outspoken mother. One problem is that, while the in-laws are silly and buffoonish, it's not clear that the downtrodden Schmidt has a right to look down on them. His daughter, meanwhile, is high strung enough to fit right in with her new family. I'm not completely sure if the ending is meant to show an emotional breakthrough for Schmidt or if it is a darkly satirical attempt to show how pathetic his life really is. In either case, the movie's overall effect is rather depressing. If About Schmidt has anything important to tell us, it's how easily life can fade into emotional oblivion.",3,"Well-acted, depressing semi-comedy",1055721600,"06 16, 2003",2003,2356,"['call', 'movie', 'semi-comedy', 'rather', 'comedy-drama', 'found', 'balance', 'satire', 'seriousness', 'little', 'uneven', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'earlier', 'films', 'Election', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'brilliant', 'satires', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'little', 'ambiguously', 'Many', 'reviews', 'film', 'focus', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'what', 'achievement', 'play', 'downbeat', 'character', 'retired', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'agree', 'Nicholson', 'great', 'performance', 'should', 'consider', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'not', 'comparison', 'other', 'Nicholson', 'roles', 'When', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'wife', 'shortly', 'retirement', 'fabric', 'life', 'unravel', 'course', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'hold', 'first', 'place', 'thoughts', 'longwinded', 'letters', 'African', 'boy', 'mail', 'unlikely', 'anyone', 'would', 'write', 'such', 'letters', 'device', 'film', 'reveal', 'character', 'Schmidt', 'main', 'concern', 'wife', 'death', 'daughter', 'played', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'impending', 'mariage', 'man', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'not', 'worthy', 'enormous', 'motor', 'home', 'daughter', 'home', 'Denver', 'having', 'misadventures', 'way', 'backdrop', 'desolate', 'Middle', 'American', 'landscape', 'see', 'Schmidt', 'almost', 'desperately', 'trying', 'fill', 'void', 'absence', 'wife', 'career', 'left', 'fact', 'marriage', 'career', 'were', 'very', 'fulfilling', 'scenario', 'doubly', 'sad', 'interaction', 'wacky', 'future', 'in-laws', 'most', 'film', 'comic', 'elements', 'Mulroney', 'good', 'salesman', 'who', 'get', 'Schmidt', 'multi-level', 'marketing', 'scheme', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'also', 'amusing', 'Mulroney', 'outspoken', 'mother', 'One', 'problem', 'in-laws', 'are', 'silly', 'buffoonish', 'not', 'clear', 'downtrodden', 'Schmidt', 'right', 'look', 'down', 'daughter', 'meanwhile', 'high', 'strung', 'enough', 'fit', 'right', 'new', 'family', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'ending', 'meant', 'show', 'emotional', 'breakthrough', 'Schmidt', 'darkly', 'satirical', 'attempt', 'show', 'how', 'pathetic', 'life', 'really', 'case', 'movie', 'overall', 'effect', 'rather', 'depressing', 'Schmidt', 'anything', 'important', 'tell', 'how', 'easily', 'life', 'can', 'fade', 'emotional', 'oblivion']",N/A
605954,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JLSK,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[1, 2]","This movie is about what can happen when mandatory (in some companies) retirement age rolls around. The movie in the beginning is as slow as Warren Schmidt's life. The beginning deliberately drags to make the point that Warren's life, which was once well-ordered and focused around work, suddenly has no meaning. For a short period of time, it seems that Warren's life will soon be filled with travel about The United States with his wife. Then comes one of those life-altering events (as though retirement wasn't enough) that suddenly crumples your world.During this portion of the movie Warren sponsors an African boy by the name of Ndugu. Through Warren's letters to Ndugu we learn what Warren is thinking, a rather clever way of letting Warren extensively espouse his feelings without hearing his thoughts directly. The only difficulty I had with the lengthy and complex monologues was that Warren had to be smart enough to realize that Ndugu would not have the slightest idea what Warren was ranting on about; a minor point and one that needs to be overlooked to stay up with the movie.At this point in the movie, Warren no longer has an anchor to reality, and perhaps sanity. The house becomes a total disaster. Warren has no routine. To grab onto any lifeline, Warren decides that he needs to go visit his daughter. However, his daughter is not interested in having him come that early for the wedding. Warren, already halfway to his daughter's house, decides to stay on the road, visiting old haunts. There are some poignant and funny points in this portion of the movie, along with the realization that, as we've all known, you can never go home.Eventually Warren ends up at the house of the mother of his daughter's fiance, Roberta Hertzel, well-played by Kathy Bates. It's as though Warren has stepped into some version of hell that he only suspected existed. Roberta's front yard is filled with junk. Sirens sound at all times of the day and night. Warren has to sleep on a completely unbaffled waterbed, and gets a major crick in his neck, which his daughter then believes was planned to ruin her wedding. Of course, we have discovered during Warren's road trip that Warren wants to stop the wedding. The contrast between Roberta Hertzel and her family and Warren's life is a huge contrast that provides several funny moments and a severe reality check for Warren.Because the best part of the movie is the end, for which you've had to patiently wait for about and hour and forty-five minutes, I'm going to stop providing details at this point. What I can tell you is that the entire movie hinges on the last few minutes of the movie, when meaning is restored to Warren's life through the tiniest of acts.Character studies about ordinary people often are boring to those who have difficulty placing themselves into the character's position. This movie will likely appeal to guys in their 40s and older who consider their work their main focus of life. Further, those who have a great deal of empathy will readily understand Warren's position. Warren goes through more travails in a few short weeks than most people will see in any five years of their life, probably more than in any ten years. Those travails strip away the facade that Warren has built about himself through his life, and we ultimately see Warren's core; it's not a pretty sight. However, Warren can be redeemed, though you have to journey the entire length of the movie to see whether his redemption is at hand. This movie and 'As Good as It Gets' prove that Jack Nicholson is an incredible actor, one of the greatest of our time.",5,Character Study Excellently Acted by Jack Nicholson,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,3610,"['movie', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'mandatory', 'companies', 'retirement', 'age', 'rolls', 'movie', 'beginning', 'as', 'slow', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'life', 'beginning', 'deliberately', 'make', 'point', 'Warren', 'life', 'was', 'once', 'well-ordered', 'focused', 'work', 'suddenly', 'meaning', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'Warren', 'life', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'filled', 'travel', 'United', 'States', 'wife', 'Then', 'one', 'life-altering', 'events', 'retirement', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'suddenly', 'world.During', 'portion', 'movie', 'Warren', 'African', 'boy', 'name', 'Ndugu', 'Warren', 'letters', 'Ndugu', 'learn', 'what', 'Warren', 'thinking', 'rather', 'clever', 'way', 'letting', 'Warren', 'extensively', 'feelings', 'hearing', 'thoughts', 'directly', 'only', 'difficulty', 'had', 'lengthy', 'complex', 'monologues', 'was', 'Warren', 'had', 'be', 'smart', 'enough', 'realize', 'Ndugu', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'slightest', 'idea', 'what', 'Warren', 'was', 'ranting', 'minor', 'point', 'one', 'be', 'overlooked', 'stay', 'up', 'movie.At', 'point', 'movie', 'Warren', 'no', 'longer', 'anchor', 'reality', 'perhaps', 'sanity', 'house', 'total', 'disaster', 'Warren', 'routine', 'grab', 'lifeline', 'Warren', 'go', 'visit', 'daughter', 'However', 'daughter', 'not', 'interested', 'having', 'come', 'early', 'wedding', 'Warren', 'already', 'daughter', 'house', 'stay', 'road', 'visiting', 'old', 'haunts', 'are', 'poignant', 'funny', 'points', 'portion', 'movie', 'realization', ""'ve"", 'known', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'home.Eventually', 'Warren', 'up', 'house', 'mother', 'daughter', 'fiance', 'Roberta', 'Hertzel', 'well-played', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Warren', 'stepped', 'version', 'hell', 'only', 'suspected', 'existed', 'Roberta', 'front', 'yard', 'filled', 'junk', 'sound', 'times', 'day', 'night', 'Warren', 'sleep', 'completely', 'unbaffled', 'waterbed', 'major', 'crick', 'neck', 'daughter', 'then', 'was', 'planned', 'ruin', 'wedding', 'course', 'have', 'discovered', 'Warren', 'road', 'trip', 'Warren', 'stop', 'wedding', 'contrast', 'Roberta', 'Hertzel', 'family', 'Warren', 'life', 'huge', 'contrast', 'several', 'funny', 'moments', 'severe', 'reality', 'check', 'Warren.Because', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'end', ""'ve"", 'had', 'patiently', 'wait', 'about', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'going', 'stop', 'providing', 'details', 'point', 'What', 'can', 'tell', 'entire', 'movie', 'hinges', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'when', 'meaning', 'restored', 'Warren', 'life', 'tiniest', 'acts.Character', 'studies', 'ordinary', 'people', 'often', 'are', 'boring', 'who', 'have', 'difficulty', 'placing', 'character', 'position', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'appeal', 'guys', '40s', 'older', 'who', 'consider', 'work', 'main', 'focus', 'life', 'Further', 'who', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'empathy', 'will', 'readily', 'understand', 'Warren', 'position', 'Warren', 'more', 'travails', 'few', 'short', 'weeks', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'see', 'five', 'years', 'life', 'probably', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'travails', 'strip', 'away', 'facade', 'Warren', 'built', 'life', 'ultimately', 'see', 'Warren', 'core', 'not', 'pretty', 'sight', 'However', 'Warren', 'can', 'be', 'redeemed', 'have', 'journey', 'entire', 'length', 'movie', 'see', 'redemption', 'hand', 'movie', ""'As"", 'Good', 'prove', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'incredible', 'actor', 'one', 'greatest', 'time']",N/A
605955,A2KSU7OOJ5C479,B00005JLSK,"Loren D. Morrison ""amateur_reviewer""","[4, 7]","There's a lot more to this movie than just the story of dull old Warren Schmidt's seeming inability to accept his retirement, the death of his wife, and the marriage of his daughter to a real loser.The opening scene sets the stage for a lot to come:  We see an expressionless Schmidt (played by Jack Nicholson) sitting in a barren office, everything packed up in storage boxes, watching a clock as the second hand moves slowly to exactly 5:00 p.m.  That's when Schmidt's retirement officially begins, and being the type of loyal employee that he is, he's not about to short his company by even one second.  You can tell that he was a true company man, and that he feels that, with retirement, his life has ended.He goes home to his dull, boring wife of over 40 years, whom he thinks he hates and resents.  Very shortly after his retirement, she dies suddenly while vacuuming up a few spots of dirt on the floor.  Thus another ending for Warren.His daughter comes home with the wheeler dealer loser she's about to marry, and Warren suffers another sort of loss when he realizes he means nothing in her life other than as a source of financial assistance.I'm going to skip over his Winnebago trip from his home in Omaha to his arrival in Denver for his daughter's wedding.  Additionally, I'm not discussing his letters to his ""foster-child,"" which form the narrative backbone of _ABOUT SCHMIDT_.  My skipping these important aspects of the film does not mean that I didn't enjoy them, but, in order to limit the length of my review, I am being a little selective.The future son-in-law is a waterbed salesman who pushes various pyramid schemes on the side, and Warren soon discovers that he is destined to sleep on a waterbed while in Denver. The waterbed provides him with the most uncomfortable night of his life.  The future son-in-law's mother, played by Kathy Bates, is a really weird woman (an understatement).  Because of Warren's aching back, she suggests he make use of the hot tub in the back yard.  He does, and is starting to feel better until he is joined in the tub by a nude Kathy Bates character who attempts to ""put the make"" on him.  For a man with a bad back, he gets out of the tub in one heck of a hurry.  This is one of the funniest scenes in a movie that effectively mixes equal doses sadness and humor.I think that one would have to see the movie to really get a feel for Warren's toast at the wedding, or for the depression he feels on his way back to Omaha in his Winnebago, or for the final uplifting moment just before the credits roll.I suppose I can understand why a lot of (probably) younger reviewers might have thought this was a slow or ""b-o-o-oring"" movie.  In my opinion that's probably because it was a rather introspective movie about feelings, and was light on the kind of action that makes up the bulk of many movies today.  This movie, like a good book, requires the viewer to apply a dose of his own imagination and feelings in order to get its full impact.  It gives nothing on a silver platter and is the better for these demands that it makes of the viewer.",5,ENFORCED RETIREMENT IS NOT A PRETTY THING,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,3099,"['lot', 'more', 'movie', 'just', 'story', 'dull', 'old', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'seeming', 'inability', 'accept', 'retirement', 'death', 'wife', 'marriage', 'daughter', 'real', 'loser.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'stage', 'lot', 'come', 'see', 'expressionless', 'Schmidt', 'played', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'sitting', 'barren', 'office', 'everything', 'packed', 'up', 'storage', 'boxes', 'watching', 'clock', 'second', 'hand', 'moves', 'slowly', 'exactly', '5:00', 'p.m.', 'when', 'Schmidt', 'retirement', 'officially', 'being', 'type', 'loyal', 'employee', 'not', 'short', 'company', 'even', 'one', 'second', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'true', 'company', 'man', 'retirement', 'life', 'ended.He', 'home', 'dull', 'boring', 'wife', '40', 'years', 'whom', 'resents', 'Very', 'shortly', 'retirement', 'suddenly', 'vacuuming', 'up', 'few', 'spots', 'dirt', 'floor', 'Thus', 'ending', 'Warren.His', 'daughter', 'home', 'wheeler', 'dealer', 'marry', 'Warren', 'sort', 'loss', 'when', 'nothing', 'life', 'other', 'source', 'financial', 'assistance.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'skip', 'Winnebago', 'trip', 'home', 'Omaha', 'arrival', 'Denver', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Additionally', ""'m"", 'not', 'discussing', 'letters', 'foster-child', 'form', 'narrative', 'backbone', '_ABOUT', 'SCHMIDT_', 'skipping', 'important', 'aspects', 'film', 'not', 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'order', 'limit', 'length', 'review', 'am', 'being', 'little', 'selective.The', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'waterbed', 'salesman', 'who', 'various', 'pyramid', 'schemes', 'side', 'Warren', 'soon', 'destined', 'sleep', 'waterbed', 'Denver', 'waterbed', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'night', 'life', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'mother', 'played', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'really', 'weird', 'woman', 'understatement', 'Warren', 'aching', 'back', 'make', 'use', 'hot', 'tub', 'back', 'yard', 'starting', 'feel', 'better', 'joined', 'tub', 'nude', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'character', 'who', 'put', 'make', 'man', 'bad', 'back', 'tub', 'one', 'heck', 'hurry', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'effectively', 'mixes', 'equal', 'doses', 'sadness', 'humor.I', 'think', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'Warren', 'toast', 'wedding', 'depression', 'way', 'back', 'Omaha', 'Winnebago', 'final', 'uplifting', 'moment', 'just', 'credits', 'roll.I', 'suppose', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'lot', 'probably', 'younger', 'reviewers', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'slow', 'b-o-o-oring', 'movie', 'opinion', 'probably', 'was', 'rather', 'introspective', 'movie', 'feelings', 'was', 'light', 'kind', 'action', 'up', 'bulk', 'many', 'movies', 'today', 'movie', 'good', 'book', 'viewer', 'apply', 'dose', 'own', 'imagination', 'feelings', 'order', 'get', 'full', 'impact', 'nothing', 'silver', 'platter', 'better', 'demands', 'viewer']",N/A

The movie shows him staring at the clock ticking on a bare wall.  This is his last day at work as an insurance actuary.  As the clock ticks 5:00 pm on the dot, Schmidt picks up and leaves and we see his work papers neatly packed in boxes marked ""Schmidt Archives"".  Later he is honored at a lackluster retirement dinner at a local Steakhouse.  Toasts by senior employees, soon to retire themselves, are rude and self-serving.  Fun is made of the new employees and no mention of any benefits that Schmidt has given to a company he has worked most of his life at.  Schmidt excuses himself and goes to a separate bar for a drink alone.There is also a sad scene when Schmidt visits his replacement, who needs no questions answered.  He gives Schmidt the bum's rush by saying he has an outside appointment and will be ""happy to ride down in the elevator with you.""  When Schmidt is leaving the area he sees his carefully archived documents in the trash.  They were not even looked at.From the narrative we learn that Schmidt is not happy with many things, with his wife of 42 years, Helen (June Squibb), or his daughter, Jeannie's (Hope Davis) upcoming marriage to a mediocre water bed salesman.  His wife is a stickler and a nag, from making him sit on the toilet to urinate to managing his errands ""don't dawdle.""  On one errand to the post office, he dawdles at Dairy Queen, and comes home to find his wife dead on the floor.Schmidt has started sending $22 a month and a correspondence to a six year old African Foster child, Ndugo Umbo.  Strangely he can be truthful once in his life on how he feels.  The letters are therapy for him and though they ramble they are searching for meaning.  The letters are an outlet, confessions, wandering thoughts and observations on the life he has.Schmidt has no job, no wife and his daughter is soon to be married and start her own life. He is at a crossroads and takes a rambling journey alone in his Winnebago.  His purpose is to talk his bitchy daughter out of her marriage to a lowlife  The adventures are sad and he looks uncomfortable and weary throughout.Warren begins -- perhaps for the first time -- to glimpse himself and the life he has lived.

It is a ""coming of age"" film for a 66 year old man, who is facing the realities of his ordinary life for perhaps the first time.  Prior to this, he always had his job to sustain him.  Not for one moment can you pity Nicholson (cast as Warren Schmidt), because you know of his secret life....That's the one where he is the sponsor and ""foster father"" of Ngudu, a six year old African Child.  Schmidt's letters to this child are the only place where he does not suppress his anger and sense of helplessness at the way his life turned out.And it is this sense of helplessness, almost a wistfulness, that the film is truly about.  Warren has to gulp back his distaste for his daughter's (Hope Davis) upcoming marriage.  If she goes through with it, will she have even less of a life than he did?  Davis gives us a skilled picture of the sense of exasperation that most adult children have with their parents.Nicholson is the most skilled actor of his generation.  Argue Anthony Hopkins and Sean Connery if you will - Nicholson is blessed with a face that can convey whatever he wishes it to. He's willing to act in farce and physical comedy as well as drama and action, and these types of comedy have given us some of the finest performances of his career.He's not alone here; in addition to fine work by Mulroney and Davis, he's joined by character actors Kathy Bates and the delightful Howard Hesseman. They are outstanding and believable as ""fringe"" baby boomers.As for the film quality - the editing sometimes misses its mark, but it is a gem, although probably too sad and depressing for some.  Small touches of irony revolve around things like Schmidt's dead wife, Helen, who was a terrific housewife, but even she had folded baskets of laundry scattered throughout the various rooms of the house.  How many of us do not?There's a ton of symbolism in the film as well - none better than the feature near film's end on the historical bridge monument at Kearney, Nebraska.  It helps Schmidt put all of our comfortable lives in perspective - when we compare our difficulties with those of the pioneers before us.There aren't enough words to convey how fine a movie is ""About Schmidt"".

605960,A2TBMX78M7PD5T,B00005JLSK,"Malvolio ""scott15724""","[2, 2]","When an acting icon plays against type, the results are usually either transcendent or disastrous. In About Schmidt, Jack Nicholson turns away from his usual swaggering, in-your-face characterizations - and fortunately achieves transcendence.Warren Schmidt is a new retiree, a 66-year-old former vice president and actuary of the Woodmen of the World life insurance organization. It's an apt career choice for Warren, who is himself a ""wood man"" - a stick, a laconic fellow who participates little in the lives of his family and associates. Instead, he watches. As the movie starts, we see Warren sitting at the desk of his boxed-up office, staring at the wall clock as the second hand sweeps toward 5 p.m. when he will officially retire. Later that evening, at his retirement party, he smiles politely and says nothing as he is toasted by his colleagues. Throughout the movie, nearly the only glimpses of his true feelings that we are afforded come through voiceover narrations of the letters he writes to Ndugu, a Tanzanian child Warren impulsively decides to sponsor through Childreach.Warren's immediate plan after retirement is to travel with his wife Helen in their cavernous Winnebago Adventurer, and attend the wedding of his daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis). Jeannie is engaged to Randall Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney), a sweet but dimwitted waterbed salesman whom Warren despises. Warren's world is thrown out of kilter when Helen dies suddenly, he discovers that she has been unfaithful to him with his best friend (Len Cariou), and he becomes estranged from Jeannie over her impending nuptials. Determined to mend matters with his daughter and talk her out of marrying Randall, Warren provisions the motorhome and sets out for Denver to visit Jeannie. When he telephones her to let her know he's on the way, she insists that he stay away until a day or two before the wedding. So, with time on his hands and no one at home, he charts a meandering course with the motorhome to various places from his youth - all the while accompanied by voiceovers of his letters to Ndugu. (Interestingly, Ndugu is a real Childreach child, though his name is actually Abdalla. He is supported by the About Schmidt production crew, who created a lifetime Endowed Sponsorship for him.)Warren undertakes his trip down memory lane to find a bit of meaning in a life gone unexpectedly amiss. Predictably, it's a disaster. Much of it - indeed, much of About Schmidt - is cliched material familiar from a host of other movies. The material is handled, though, in a fresh manner that elevates the movie above others of its genre. When he finds that the home of his birth has been torn down and replaced by a tire store, for instance, Warren doesn't fly into a rage or stoop to bitter sarcasm. Instead, he distills whatever pleasant reminiscence he can from the visit, even remarking with winsome irony on the tire swing that once hung in the yard.Portrayals that would fall into caricature in other movies are handled in About Schmidt with restraint and dead-on observation. A middle-aged couple Warren encounters in a campground might have stepped out of a Good Sam brochure. Randall Hertzel's extended family, while entertainingly eccentric, always stop short of buffoonery; and Kathy Bates as Randall's mother paints such a definitive portrait with a few deft strokes that you could swear you've known her all your life. The movie itself walks a fine line between cynicism and sentimentality, on the strength of Nicholson's perfectly balanced performance. At Jeannie's wedding reception, after trying so hard to convince her to give up Randall, Warren offers a conciliatory toast that reads like something from the end of a Shakespeare comedy; and you think, At last the movie has settled into its conventional happy ending. But then, as he pilots the motorhome back to Omaha, Warren narrates his bitterness to Ndugu over his failure to save Jeannie from her nitwit groom. Cynicism reigns. It is only at the true end of the movie - back in Omaha, when he reads his first return letter from his foster child - that Schmidt finds his desperately-sought shred of redemption. It is nothing more than a moment of recognition before the credits roll; but at last Warren grasps a rag of hope to banish the chill of wintry age.",4,The Winter of His Discontent,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,4302,"['When', 'acting', 'icon', 'plays', 'type', 'results', 'are', 'usually', 'transcendent', 'disastrous', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'away', 'usual', 'swaggering', 'in-your-face', 'characterizations', 'fortunately', 'transcendence.Warren', 'Schmidt', 'new', 'retiree', '66-year-old', 'former', 'vice', 'president', 'actuary', 'Woodmen', 'World', 'life', 'insurance', 'organization', 'apt', 'career', 'choice', 'Warren', 'who', 'wood', 'man', 'stick', 'laconic', 'fellow', 'who', 'little', 'lives', 'family', 'associates', 'Instead', 'movie', 'see', 'Warren', 'sitting', 'desk', 'boxed-up', 'office', 'staring', 'wall', 'clock', 'second', 'hand', 'sweeps', '5', 'p.m.', 'when', 'will', 'officially', 'retire', 'Later', 'evening', 'retirement', 'party', 'politely', 'nothing', 'toasted', 'colleagues', 'movie', 'nearly', 'only', 'glimpses', 'true', 'feelings', 'are', 'afforded', 'come', 'voiceover', 'narrations', 'letters', 'Ndugu', 'Tanzanian', 'child', 'Warren', 'impulsively', 'sponsor', 'Childreach.Warren', 'immediate', 'plan', 'retirement', 'travel', 'wife', 'Helen', 'cavernous', 'Winnebago', 'Adventurer', 'attend', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'Jeannie', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Jeannie', 'engaged', 'Randall', 'Hertzel', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'sweet', 'dimwitted', 'waterbed', 'salesman', 'whom', 'Warren', 'Warren', 'world', 'thrown', 'kilter', 'when', 'Helen', 'suddenly', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'best', 'friend', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'estranged', 'Jeannie', 'impending', 'nuptials', 'Determined', 'mend', 'matters', 'daughter', 'talk', 'marrying', 'Randall', 'Warren', 'provisions', 'motorhome', 'out', 'Denver', 'visit', 'Jeannie', 'When', 'let', 'know', 'way', 'stay', 'away', 'day', 'two', 'wedding', 'So', 'time', 'hands', 'one', 'home', 'meandering', 'course', 'motorhome', 'various', 'places', 'youth', 'while', 'accompanied', 'voiceovers', 'letters', 'Ndugu', 'Interestingly', 'Ndugu', 'real', 'Childreach', 'child', 'name', 'actually', 'Abdalla', 'supported', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'production', 'crew', 'who', 'created', 'lifetime', 'Endowed', 'Sponsorship', 'Warren', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'find', 'bit', 'meaning', 'life', 'gone', 'unexpectedly', 'amiss', 'Predictably', 'disaster', 'Much', 'indeed', 'much', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'cliched', 'material', 'familiar', 'host', 'other', 'movies', 'material', 'handled', 'though', 'fresh', 'manner', 'movie', 'others', 'genre', 'When', 'home', 'birth', 'been', 'torn', 'down', 'replaced', 'tire', 'store', 'instance', 'Warren', ""n't"", 'fly', 'rage', 'stoop', 'bitter', 'sarcasm', 'Instead', 'pleasant', 'reminiscence', 'can', 'visit', 'even', 'remarking', 'winsome', 'irony', 'tire', 'swing', 'once', 'hung', 'yard.Portrayals', 'would', 'fall', 'caricature', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'handled', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'restraint', 'dead-on', 'observation', 'middle-aged', 'couple', 'Warren', 'campground', 'might', 'have', 'stepped', 'Good', 'Sam', 'brochure', 'Randall', 'Hertzel', 'extended', 'family', 'entertainingly', 'eccentric', 'always', 'stop', 'short', 'buffoonery', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Randall', 'mother', 'paints', 'such', 'definitive', 'portrait', 'few', 'deft', 'strokes', 'could', 'swear', ""'ve"", 'known', 'life', 'movie', 'fine', 'line', 'cynicism', 'sentimentality', 'strength', 'Nicholson', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'performance', 'Jeannie', 'wedding', 'reception', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'convince', 'give', 'up', 'Randall', 'Warren', 'conciliatory', 'toast', 'something', 'end', 'Shakespeare', 'comedy', 'think', 'last', 'movie', 'settled', 'conventional', 'happy', 'ending', 'then', 'pilots', 'motorhome', 'back', 'Omaha', 'Warren', 'bitterness', 'Ndugu', 'failure', 'save', 'Jeannie', 'nitwit', 'groom', 'Cynicism', 'only', 'true', 'end', 'movie', 'back', 'Omaha', 'when', 'first', 'return', 'letter', 'foster', 'child', 'Schmidt', 'desperately-sought', 'shred', 'redemption', 'nothing', 'more', 'moment', 'recognition', 'credits', 'roll', 'last', 'Warren', 'grasps', 'rag', 'hope', 'banish', 'chill', 'wintry', 'age']",N/A

605963,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,B00005JLSK,Mat,"[3, 4]","Alexander Payne's 2002 film, About Schmidt, is just as much the transformation of it's star Jack Nicholson as it is the transformation of the character Jack plays ""Warren Schmidt."" Here Nicholson is no longer the swaggering, smart alecked, tough guy we have seen throughout his long, illustrious career but a quiet, shell of a nice guy trying to understand his life after retirement. Nicholson does such an amazing job portraying this loser of a character one wonders why he hasn't been playing this type all along.The movie begins with the retirement of Warren Schmidt. He is a typical Midwestern ""good guy"" who is retiring as an executive from an insurance company. Schmidt is an everyman schlub. He has worked hard to have a ""normal"" life. He has a good job, a long standing wife, and a nice daughter. Yet upon retiring, the death of a loved one, and his daughters imminent marriage Schmidt must take a harder look at his life. In doing so he comes to realize there isn't much to it, really. The bulk of the movie centers on Schmidt traveling to Colorado to try to stop his daughter from marrying a redneck boob.Theerer are numerous perfect spoofs of Midwestern living. From Schmidt's life, to his retirement plans of living in a trailer the details of a typical Midwestern life are just about perfect. While on the road, Schmidt stops at numerous Interstate museums that are so banal it is hilarious. Once he arrives in Colorado the characterizations of the fiancee and his family are both hilarious and frighteningly real. Dermot Mulroney plays the mullett wearing, salesman fiancee and Kathy Bathes plays the still living in the 60's time of free love soon to be mother-in-law. The family dinner before the wedding is reminiscent of real life, mixing hilarity and sadness with the eye of an artist. The actual wedding is so dead on perfect that I believe I have actually attended that very ceremony. From the off key singing of the schmaltzy ""Longer"" to the self written vows (I will love you every day, and when I say day I mean all 24 hours, and when I say hours I mean...) the ceremony is hilarious in its real life cheezeball hokeyness and yet manages to remain as sweet.This is what makes the film so memorable. While it pokes fun and satirizes everyday Midwestern life it is full of rich glowing love for that very life. Schmidt is an normal schmuck who has lived his life by the rules. While at the end of his life he begins to regret that simple life, I don't believe the film is suggesting that this type of life is meaningless.

The movie opens at the end of Schmidt's last day at work, before entering into the oblivion of retirement. We can tell by his body language and the look on his face that Warren is not a happy man. ""About Schmidt"" takes us on the quirky, sad, and funny journey of this man's new-found life, and manages to bring to the forefront a cast of unique, individual characters. The movie feels 'real', in a way that I haven't come across in cinema for a very long time.Jack Nicholson stars as Warren Schmidt, a man who, now that he has retired, has nothing to do. He isn't a terribly deep individual, and so there isn't a lot for him to take an interest in. He appears to have no hobbies, no passions. But he is not an empty man. One day, Schmidt sees a commercial which beckons him to become a sponsor for a poor, mal-nourished African child. He answers the commercial's call, and soon starts sending monthly checks to his sponsor child, Ndugu. We get to see a picture of sweet, little Ndugu, and Schmidt decides to start sending the youth regular letters, discussing the events currently going on in his life. This allows for a nice, connective narration for the film, and it is used to good effect.Schmidt's wife had bought an Adventurer for the two of them to travel the country in during their retiring years. Unfortunately, Mrs. Schmidt passes away, and Warren is left to his own devices. We see the stages of grief pass through the widower, and Nicholson excels with his portrayal of the troubled, lonely man. Eventually, Schmidt decides to take the Adventurer out by himself, and then the film becomes somewhat of a road movie. He meets some very interesting people along his journey, and visits some very real locales across the American midwest. The big event looming in Schmidt's life is the wedding of his daughter to a man that he can't stand, but seems unable to convince his daughter not to marry. The groom's family is a hoot. You'll have to see them to believe them.Everything comes together in this movie. Nicholson implodes exquisitely as Schmidt, and is both humorous and sympathetic to watch. June Squibb, as Schmidt's wife, is so very sweet. Though she isn't in the film much, her character leaves a lasting memory. I loved Dermut Mulroney as Schmidt's future son-in-law, Randall . He made that character his own. Randall's a sweet guy, but would be terrifying to any woman's father that he met. And we can't forget Kathy Bates. She is not in the movie much, either, but also leaves a marked imprint upon the film. Be prepared to see her dis-robed, however. It is quite... memorable.""About Schmidt"" is a near-perfect film. Understand that it is drama *and* a comedy. There are very rarely guffaw-inducing moments, but there are quite a few instances that will keep you chuckling to no end. This is one of the hardest kind of movies to do. To balance humor and solemnity is not an easy task, and all involved pull it off wonderfully. Alexander Payne deserves recognition for his screenplay, and also for his direction of the film. All of the actors make their characters seem quite real. We feel for them, and laugh along with them.And don't forget little Ndugu.

605966,A3OUKV8KBGUPS4,B00005JLSK,M. Casarino,"[1, 2]","Jack Nicholson's amazingly perceptive and ego-free performance dominates the quiet desperation of ""About Schmidt,"" a sad drama about a common man who gradually discovers that he just doesn't matter anymore. Schmidt has just retired from a job that anyone could do, and finds he has nothing to look forward to. In a small, almost defiant gesture, he sponsors an African child - and begins to send the boy letters along with his $22 check each month.Soon, tragedy and a certain freedom fall on Schmidt, so he hops in his massive Winnebago and hits the road to Denver, where his daughter (Hope Davis) will soon be marrying a well-meaning but dimwitted waterbed salesman (Dermot Mulroney). Ostensibly, his quest is to stop the marriage, but he's also seeking salvation and meaning on his trip. Unfortunately, every turn seems to confirm his invisibility.There's humor in every story, and ""Schmidt's"" director Alexander Payne finds it in Schmidt's seething anger and awakening and some wonderful character roles, particularly Roberta, his sister-in-law-to-be (played by the indispensable Kathy Bates). More important than humor, though, is empathy - if you don't identify with at least some of Schmidt's desperation, you're a heartier soul than I. ""About Schmidt's"" ambiguous ending only reinforces the theme, and places the blame for Schmidt's irrelevance squarely on his shoulders...if you want to avoid a life of quiet desperation, the film seems to ask, what are you going to do about it? Schmidt did almost nothing, so maybe he deserves his place in life.This is rough going for a lot of audiences. There are slow moments, particularly in the first act, and Jack's performance is so dead-on he's sometimes hard to watch. But ""About Schmidt"" is a rewarding experience, with a buried life-affirming message: Schmidt may be so common he might disappear, but Payne made a movie about him anyway.

A stranger to his soon to be deceased wife of 42 years, a stranger to his daughter, Jeannie (Hope Davis), a stranger to his co-workers at the Insurance company from which he has just retired; and more importantly he's a stranger to himself. Schmidt is emotionally and physically stopped up and without an outlet from which to vent the most private thoughts and demons that lay within. That is until he decides to sponsor a 6-year-old Tanzanian orphan by sending not only a [$$] check every month but also a litany of all his troubles and concerns. This litany becomes the narration that holds the movie together and allows Schmidt to reveal his innermost observations and take on things.Alexander Payne, who also directed the quirky and witty ""Election,"" directs here with a jaded, spoiled milk attitude directed at his Midwestern characters that is very much unlike, say the Coen brothers attitude towards the Minnesotans in ""Fargo."" Payne's mise en scene is cluttered with the detritus of small town life (or what we think of as small town life): open spaces, clean air, and supposedly unsophisticated people with out-of-date clothing. It's a clich&eacute; really and beneath Payne's talent.Jack Nicholson plays Schmidt without any of his usual baggage: snide comments, jocular attitude, arching eyebrows. But after all these years it is difficult to see him in a role that is without irony. We naturally assume he is kidding and as Schmidt we expect him to wink at us to let us know it's all a joke. But he doesn't and it isn't. And therein lays the genius of his performance.Kathy Bates is particularly strong as a new-age goddess, Roberta Hertzel who ""nursed Randall (Dermot Mulroney) until he was five."" She's an earth mother, ex-hippie who brings a large dose of life affirming fun to the proceedings.""About Schmidt"" is ultimately about unfulfilled dreams and wasted moments that somehow turn themselves into a lifetime before we know it.

605971,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JLSK,Miles D. Moore,"[0, 2]","A lovely balance of the satirical and the affectionate, Alexander Payne's ""About Schmidt"" is a perfectly calibrated comedy-drama. As in his earlier movies ""Citizen Ruth"" and ""Election,"" Payne proves himself a modern-day Sinclair Lewis as he depicts recognizable Middle American characters trying to break out of the stultifying patterns of their lives. Warren Schmidt, an Omaha insurance executive, is forced to face up to his long-unexamined life as he faces some jolting changes--retirement, the sudden death of his wife, the marriage of his daughter to a waterbed salesman. He pours out his (angry) feelings and (usually self-deluded) thoughts in his letters to the six-year-old African boy he sponsors through a charitable organization. These letters are a sure source of hilarity, as well as insight, throughout the movie, but they also lead to one of the most moving payoffs in any recent movie. The dialogue is perfect, the music (by Rolfe Kent) notably graceful, the cast impeccable--particularly the underrated Dermot Mulroney as Schmidt's low-life prospective son-in-law and Kathy Bates as Mulroney's Bohemian mother. But the real reason to see this movie is Jack Nicholson, giving what may be the finest performance in one of Hollywood's most illustrious careers. Nicholson divests himself here of his usual devilish shtick; his Schmidt is stubborn, blinkered, helpless as a baby in any situation that wouldn't occur in an insurance office. It's a magnificent performance, particularly in how Nicholson can change the whole tone of a scene with a single movement of his eyes.

Then his wife (June Squibb) of 42 years dies suddenly, and, without the routine that she provided, even his leisurely retirement life falls apart. Warren decides to take off on a road trip in the mobile home he and his wife had purchased, intending to surprise his daughter, Jeannie, by arriving weeks early for her impending wedding. But he and Jeannie (Hope Davis) are not on the best of terms, and when she makes it clear his early arrival would be unwelcome, Warren takes the long route instead, driving from state to state in search of very little but the opportunity to kill time and do something different. Through Warren's minor adventures and encounters with people along the way, we come to understand this abrasive curmudgeon as he comes to see his own life in a different light. Wandering about the countryside, far from anything familiar, Warren realizes how little he participated in his own life and how little attention he paid to the things and people around him. Finally, Warren must face his new in-laws and his daughter's wedding to a man he doesn't like. In spite of his renewed interest in everyday life, he comes to the realization that he really can't change anything.Based on the novel by Louis Begly and adapted for the screen by writer/director Alexander Payne, ""About Schmidt"" is an excellent character study of a typical -I've met a few of them, anyway- older middle-class man who must find some reason to do something now that he has no job and no wife, which forces him to examine what he has been doing all his life. Warren Schmidt is Jack Nicholson's best performance in years. Nicholson is really acting here and lapses into his usual schtick only a couple of times. But Hope Davis gives a truly remarkable performance. We see relatively little of her, but Davis is able to communicate how much like her father Jeannie is, as well as how she feels about her fiance and about herself without speaking directly to those subjects. Her words convey how she feels about her father, but somehow she conveys how she feels about everything else entirely between the lines. Kathy Bates also does a fine job as Roberta, Jeannie's future mother-in-law. The choice to have Warren reveal himself partly through voice-over narration and through other characters articulating his problems could be construed as lazy, but I think it really worked here and is woven seamlessly into the narrative.I highly recommend ""About Schmidt"" because a film of this type simply could not have been done better. But character studies are relatively uneventful, and this one is a little long.

605973,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B00005JLSK,Missing Person,"[2, 2]","""About Schmidt"" is a masterwork directed by Alexander Payne, and written by Payne with his usual co-writer Jim Taylor. The fact that this movie has received so many negative reviews from customers really speaks volumes. Certainly, ""About Schmidt"" is not a fast-paced comedy, and certainly there is a lot of pain and sorrow expressed from the Warren Schmidt character. ""About Schmidt"" is what you could accurately describe as a tragi-comedy--it does have many extremely funny moments, and it isn't just depressing for the sake of being depressing. Accusing it of having little or no plot is simply ridiculous and unfair. There's a great deal of wisdom to be found here--the movie is very intelligent, very *real*, and spiced up with some great black humor. It also serves as a powerful cautionary tale for twentysomething viewers who are willing to go along for the ride and give this film a chance.Following the sudden passing of his wife of over 40 years, as well as his retirement, the 66-year-old Schmidt goes through the emotionally wrenching process of seeing his life for what it has been, warts and all. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Warren Schmidt character is absolutely brilliant, and Kathy Bates is great also and extremely funny.  As with his previous movie ""Election"", Payne displays a fondness for making substantial use of spoken voiceovers, a tactic that pays off hugely here--Nicholson does a wonderful job with Schmidt's narrations of handwritten letters to a Tazmanian foster child named Ndugu, which serve as a brillant way of letting the viewer get inside Schmidt's mind and pave the way for the heart-wrenching closing scene. Even the musical score is expertly done and a lot of fun, complementing the sly transitions of the movie perfectly.If you're disappointed that ""About Schmidt"" isn't a lightweight comedy to watch while throwing down a few beers on your day off, then that's your loss--this is a powerful movie that serious viewers will appreciate and get a great deal of satisfaction from.Nicholson and Bates were each nominated for Academy Awards for their performances here, for best actor and best supporting actress respectively--neither won, but each of them certainly deserved to.",5,an achingly bittersweet and powerful story of self-realization from the point of view of an older man,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,2220,"['Schmidt', 'masterwork', 'directed', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'written', 'Payne', 'usual', 'co-writer', 'Jim', 'Taylor', 'fact', 'movie', 'received', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'customers', 'really', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'Certainly', 'Schmidt', 'not', 'fast-paced', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'lot', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'expressed', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'character', 'Schmidt', 'what', 'could', 'accurately', 'describe', 'tragi-comedy', 'have', 'many', 'extremely', 'funny', 'moments', ""n't"", 'just', 'depressing', 'sake', 'being', 'depressing', 'Accusing', 'having', 'little', 'plot', 'simply', 'ridiculous', 'unfair', 'great', 'deal', 'wisdom', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'movie', 'very', 'intelligent', 'very', '*real*', 'spiced', 'up', 'great', 'black', 'humor', 'also', 'powerful', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'twentysomething', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'give', 'film', 'chance.Following', 'sudden', 'passing', 'wife', '40', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'retirement', '66-year-old', 'Schmidt', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'process', 'seeing', 'life', 'what', 'been', 'warts', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'portrayal', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'character', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'great', 'also', 'extremely', 'funny', 'previous', 'movie', 'Election', 'Payne', 'fondness', 'making', 'substantial', 'use', 'spoken', 'voiceovers', 'tactic', 'hugely', 'here', 'Nicholson', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Schmidt', 'narrations', 'handwritten', 'letters', 'Tazmanian', 'foster', 'child', 'named', 'Ndugu', 'serve', 'brillant', 'way', 'letting', 'viewer', 'get', 'Schmidt', 'mind', 'pave', 'way', 'heart-wrenching', 'closing', 'scene', 'Even', 'musical', 'score', 'expertly', 'done', 'lot', 'fun', 'complementing', 'sly', 'transitions', 'movie', 'perfectly.If', ""'re"", 'disappointed', 'Schmidt', ""n't"", 'lightweight', 'comedy', 'watch', 'throwing', 'down', 'few', 'beers', 'day', 'then', 'loss', 'powerful', 'movie', 'serious', 'viewers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'get', 'great', 'deal', 'satisfaction', 'from.Nicholson', 'Bates', 'were', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'performances', 'here', 'best', 'actor', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'respectively', 'won', 'certainly', 'deserved']",N/A

It is the ability to look the viewer in the 'eye' and without uttering one single word, affect him/her, speaking tons and expressing many different emotions wihtout words.

Here an aging retiree, Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson), tries to rekindle his childhood memories after his wife dies and having bought a new RV. His future becomes more uncertain and he finds himself coming to terms with his daughter's marriage to a man he has no love for. Schmidt's estrangement takes him places in his RV and sees him doing things that his regular nine to five had hidden. The despair is neatly assorted with many comedy moments, mostly negligible instances that make for big scenes. Before we know it the audience finds themselves very much attached to a man who could be you!This is also Nicholson as you have not seen him before (and for a guy who has been in 60 movies, that is no small feat). There is no Easy Rider, George Hanson, here. Instead we see what appears to be one of Hollywood's most loved actors wearing granddad's hide and looking as if he might keel over at the next bend. You will have a tendency to laugh in horror throughout most of it.For this reason `About Schmidt' is mandatory viewing for all ages.

Having lived through my grandfather's depression after his retirement, I am in a good position to understand just how true Jack Nicholson's portrayal of this man is.Men are bred in today's society to display as little emotion as possible, to be detached and be &quot;The providers&quot;. It is less common nowadays, but it was certainly very true in Schmidt's generation and what we see through his eyes is the result of that.Schmidt is a man without a compass, dropped in the middle of an uncaring society-- he no longer is respected for the work of decades, his daughter is out of touch with him (and has become more of a denaturalized and unaffective daughter with caprices), his wife dies, and he feels he has left nothing in the world to mark his place, that he has done nothing right or given anything precious to anyone.This is more common than you think. This is the story of the common man at the sunset of his life.The move is about as much of a comedy as life is-- there are comic moments, there are tragic moments, and more or less they even out at the end when we look back at them. Don't be mistaken, this isn't your Hollywood glitz of Happily Ever After and the unrealistic couples and men we have seen in the big screen... aboutt Schmidt is about the average joe, as average as you can get. After a lifetime of passionate Hollywood-esque characters under Nicholson's sleeve, some may say his performance is not engaging--- quite the contrary. Have you watched your cubicle neighbour? your mailman? That's who Schmidt's concept is-- average, non-passionate, practical, unimaginative, unaffectionate, the typical male provider who has sacrificed his life for his family and has left very little time to cultivating himself or giving his life any meaning outside of his work and his role as the leader of the family. Nicholson's portrayal is amazingly insightful, and terribly subtle. It is not easy for a superb character actor as Nicholson to take on a role where minimalism and unremarkability are the keywords for a character, yet he carries it off magically-- he becomes Schmidt, it's not Jack Nicholson as Schmidt. It's simply... about Schmidt.The sad part is, the characters aren't as grotesquely imagined as you people have said... all you need to do to find Kathy Bate's character is take a good trip through the trailor homes near North Carolina and find your pick. She's not an 'evil' woman, or a harpy, or anything like that... she's just common, vulgar, base, with good feelings but a bad sense of direction, a fuzzy mental disposition and clearly an unfit mother. Nicholson's daughter's fiance is the typical sleaze you'll find in used car businesses or who tries to talk you into a deal that you know has feet of clay.About Schmidt explores the pathos of its main character through his relationship to the rest of the world and other people. It is a master work where you find your neighbours, your friends, and -to those to whom it applies and who are honest with themselves- sometimes even yourself. It is life... Bittersweet, like life, but by no means unredeemable. The last few seconds of the movie carry a tremendous message, yet it occurs only in a few seconds and without any dialogue, which may be lost in our short-attention-span american audiences of today, who are accustomed to three explosions and a body count at the end of each film.By all means, know what you're getting into when you watch this movie, but know that you are renting one of cinematography's jewels, and an undeserved underdog.

605987,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00005JLSK,Patrick L. Randall,"[1, 4]","Fans of Jack Nicholson who were led by the trailers to believe that they were getting another hilarious dose of Melvin Udall (from ""As Good as It Gets"") will be sorely, sorely disappointed by the meandering mess that is ""About Schmidt"".  Nicholson's brand of simmering anger is one of more appealing actor's trademarks in film today.  The trailers would seem to give the idea that ""About Schmidt"" would tap into that reservoir and create another endearing character for Nicholson's resume.  Unfortunately, this film fails miserably.  There is not a single legitimate funny moment in this film.  ""About Schmidt"" just runs the gamut from boring to depressing to downright cringe-inducing.""About Schmidt"" is the story of one Warren Schmidt, a man who toed the line and did everything exactly as he was supposed throughout his entire life, only to realize that it left him with a very empty life.  At a retirement party to honor his decades of service to a non-descript insurance company, Warren reaches the pinnacle of his life.  Despite everything, being honored by friends and co-workers makes it seem all worthwhile.  Yet, when he shows up at the office the following week to help his replacement assume his old job, Warren realizes just how quickly the company for which he toiled for so many years needed less than 48 hours to erase all memory of his work there.  The new guy tries to seem appreciative, but he doesn't really need Warren's help.  Realizing he is no longer needed by those he worked with, Warren has to face retirement with a wife that he realizes that he can't stand, not to mention a non-existent relationship with his daughter.  The only thing that even seems to give him the slightest bit of comfort is his `sponsoring' of one of those third-world children through one of those programs that used to be promoted by Sally Struthers and Pernell Roberts.Warren's already hopelessly boring life gets thrown into disarray when his wife suddenly dies one day.  At the funeral, he must deal with his daughter once again, and his daughter's complete loser of a fianc&eacute;.  Warren realizes that he's not very good at caring for himself and has lived a meaningless life to this point.  So, not long after the funeral, he decides to head out in a Winnebago that his wife bought for the two of them on a quest to stop his daughter from marrying that joke a boyfriend.  Before leaving, he discovers letters that reveal that his best friend had an affair with his wife many years earlier.  After confronting that `friend', Warren begins a long, strange journey across the country to meet his daughter and his future in-laws (and to stop the marriage).While the plot is depressing, one would think that, given the people involved, ""About Schmidt"" could still be turned into an endearing tale of self-discovery and resolution.  Alas, it doesn't even come close.  The confrontation with his `friend' over the indiscretion with his wife looked like it could have been darkly amusing from the trailers.  In actuality, it just seems mean and pathetic.  Warren's journey across the country has him encounter the staple of road-trip movies, the colorful characters.  Warren just succeeds in making a fool of himself and seemingly learning nothing while also failing to give the audience anything for that wasted time.  When he finally does reach his destination and sees his daughter and meets the in-laws, there is still nothing endearing about this film.  About the only thing slightly amusing was an uninhibited performance by Kathy Bates as the mother of his future son-in-law.  The rest of this gathering is uncomfortable and ponderous.  Why Warren is there is seems questionable and there never is any resolution to any of the problems in his life.

Jack immerses himself in the part and gives a good impression of a man living out his final years by trying to get in touch with himself. I would say that it is an excellent character study.I personally did not care much for the film story, though. Although the story flows well, I found it depressing, moody and without much entertainment value. Where there is humor it is of the dark sort. I realize this is my personal take on the film, but then ... that's what this review is. You may not agree with it - that's your privilege.The theme is one of social reality; this is the ""success story"" of most middle class Americans. Successful marriage, successful career with retirement, nice home, no financial worries. And what does it mean? Nothing at all because the inner human being is unsatisfied. We find (something I've known for years) that it is not what one does that causes regret late in life, but what one has failed to do. Schmidt has all the American trappings of success, but finds they are empty and without meaning. His wife is shrewish and dies shortly after he retires. He could care less about his comfortable house (to the extent that he abandons it and takes off in a motor home), his former employer has pensioned him off and does not want the value of his experience or advice. His friends turn out to be hollow. His daughter (whom he cherishes) seems put out by his attempts to visit and only really cares about the checks he regularly sends her.  Schmidt realizes that when he dies, no one will remember him but briefly.Quality of the dvd is good, though unremarkable. We have become used to the amazing quality of today's technology and generally only comment when the transfer is lacking in spite of it.Of the extras ... very much set in the mood of the movie. They consist primarily of various versions of the opening theme (a lukewarm tune in any event) and various views of ""Woodmen of the World"" insurance company headquarters in Omaha. Not very inspiring or interesting. I would have preferred an interview with Jack on his feelings about the part he played so well.With all this, why the three stars? Why not less? Because I do feel that the acting was good and the film well put together .. even if I didn't particularly care for it. I would say that if you are a JN fan, you'll want this. Otherwise, you'll probably be disappointed. On the plus side, you can usually find a copy for a couple of bucks .. so not much is lost if you don't like the film.***Recommended as a rental only***~pjm~",3,"Go ahead, bring on the arrows ...",1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,2647,"['bought', 'movie', 'having', 'read', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'extent', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'were', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'Jack', 'part', 'good', 'impression', 'man', 'living', 'out', 'final', 'years', 'trying', 'get', 'touch', 'would', 'say', 'excellent', 'character', 'study.I', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'film', 'story', 'though', 'story', 'well', 'found', 'depressing', 'moody', 'much', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Where', 'humor', 'dark', 'sort', 'realize', 'personal', 'take', 'film', 'then', 'what', 'review', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'privilege.The', 'theme', 'one', 'social', 'reality', 'success', 'story', 'most', 'middle', 'class', 'Americans', 'Successful', 'marriage', 'successful', 'career', 'retirement', 'nice', 'home', 'financial', 'worries', 'what', 'mean', 'Nothing', 'inner', 'human', 'being', 'unsatisfied', 'find', 'something', ""'ve"", 'known', 'years', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'regret', 'late', 'life', 'what', 'one', 'failed', 'do', 'Schmidt', 'American', 'trappings', 'success', 'are', 'empty', 'meaning', 'wife', 'shrewish', 'shortly', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'comfortable', 'house', 'extent', 'off', 'motor', 'home', 'former', 'employer', 'pensioned', 'off', 'not', 'want', 'value', 'experience', 'advice', 'friends', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'hollow', 'daughter', 'whom', 'put', 'out', 'attempts', 'visit', 'only', 'really', 'checks', 'regularly', 'Schmidt', 'when', 'one', 'will', 'remember', 'briefly.Quality', 'dvd', 'good', 'unremarkable', 'have', 'become', 'used', 'amazing', 'quality', 'today', 'technology', 'generally', 'only', 'comment', 'when', 'transfer', 'lacking', 'spite', 'it.Of', 'extras', 'very', 'much', 'set', 'mood', 'movie', 'consist', 'primarily', 'various', 'versions', 'opening', 'theme', 'lukewarm', 'tune', 'event', 'various', 'views', 'Woodmen', 'World', 'insurance', 'company', 'headquarters', 'Omaha', 'Not', 'very', 'inspiring', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'interview', 'Jack', 'feelings', 'part', 'played', 'so', 'well.With', 'why', 'three', 'stars', 'Why', 'not', 'less', 'do', 'feel', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'well', 'put', 'together', '..', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'JN', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'want', 'Otherwise', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'plus', 'side', 'can', 'usually', 'find', 'copy', 'couple', 'bucks', '..', 'so', 'not', 'much', 'lost', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', '***Recommended', 'rental', 'only***~pjm~']",N/A

No, he wasn't the president of the company, as he'd hoped, or even the vice-president, as he maybe deserved, but he did become the assistant vice-president.  A nice career, and he receives a nice send-off at his retirement dinner.While coming to terms with this, his wife of 42 years drops dead.  Schmidt starts to think about his life, what he has done, what his lasting effect will be, and he comes to a bleak conclusion.  ""One of these days I'm going to die,"" he says.  ""Maybe tomorrow, maybe in five years, maybe in ten years.  And once everyone else that knows me dies, nobody alive will remember me, or know anything about me.  I have gone through this world, and my existence has not changed it at all.""  Something like that.So he sees an ad on TV and decides to sponsor an African orphan.  He sends the kid twenty-five dollars a month and gets to send him letters.  A very nice device:  we get to hear Schmidt's thoughts as he sends the kid these letters.And he realizes that there is something that he can do after all:  he can stop his only child, his adult daughter, from marrying the ""nincompoop"" to whom she is engaged.  We in the audience are shown that, yes, the fellow is indeed a nincompoop.He goes to the nincompoop's home two days before the wedding, and finds that they are a family of nincompoops.  The mother, though kind, is an unmannered vulgarian, cursing at her ex-husband in the kitchen, demeaning to all at the dinner table, and plopping nude into the hot-tub where Schmidt is innocently trying to relax.  The ex-husband is a clown.  The brother of the groom seems to be in a drug-induced haze.  They live in a noisy and unpleasant neighborhood.Despite his desperate pleas--when he finally gets a chance to make them--Schmidt's daughter insists on going through with the wedding.It occurs.  And at the reception, sure enough, the toast made by the best man is clumsy and oafish.  The music is cheapo, disco junk.  It is finally Schmidt's turn, the bride's father--played by Jack Nicholson--to make his toast.  He thanks all of them, and then he says, with the camera in close-up and from several different angles, that he wants to say something more.  He looks at everybody, with his glass in the air, and we realize that it is the Nicholson moment.  We've been waiting for it.  Jack Nicholson is going to say something--in the sarcastic Jack Nicholson way we've come to know and love--about these people he despises.And he gives his speech.  I am not going to tell you anything more, except to say that to me, it is one of the most revelatory, powerful moments in film.  A slug to the head.After it is all done he goes home and finds that he has been sent a letter from the teacher of the little African boy.  Along with the letter there is a picture drawn by the little boy,  and Mr. Schmidt--played by the magnificent Mr. Nicholson--realizes that he has made a difference in this world after all.",5,"A Quiet, Moving Statement",1058313600,"07 16, 2003",2003,3005,"['Schmidt', 'insurance', 'executive', 'newly', 'retired', 'pretty', 'good', 'career', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'president', 'company', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'even', 'vice-president', 'maybe', 'deserved', 'did', 'become', 'assistant', 'vice-president', 'nice', 'career', 'nice', 'send-off', 'retirement', 'dinner.While', 'coming', 'terms', 'wife', '42', 'years', 'drops', 'dead', 'Schmidt', 'think', 'life', 'what', 'done', 'what', 'lasting', 'effect', 'will', 'be', 'bleak', 'conclusion', 'One', 'days', ""'m"", 'going', 'die', 'Maybe', 'tomorrow', 'maybe', 'five', 'years', 'maybe', 'ten', 'years', 'once', 'everyone', 'else', 'nobody', 'alive', 'will', 'remember', 'know', 'anything', 'have', 'gone', 'world', 'existence', 'not', 'changed', 'Something', 'that.So', 'ad', 'TV', 'decides', 'sponsor', 'African', 'orphan', 'kid', 'twenty-five', 'dollars', 'month', 'send', 'letters', 'very', 'nice', 'device', 'get', 'hear', 'Schmidt', 'thoughts', 'kid', 'something', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'stop', 'only', 'child', 'adult', 'daughter', 'marrying', 'nincompoop', 'whom', 'engaged', 'audience', 'are', 'shown', 'yes', 'fellow', 'indeed', 'nincompoop.He', 'nincompoop', 'home', 'two', 'days', 'wedding', 'are', 'family', 'nincompoops', 'mother', 'kind', 'unmannered', 'vulgarian', 'cursing', 'ex-husband', 'kitchen', 'demeaning', 'dinner', 'table', 'plopping', 'nude', 'hot-tub', 'where', 'Schmidt', 'innocently', 'trying', 'relax', 'ex-husband', 'clown', 'brother', 'groom', 'be', 'drug-induced', 'haze', 'live', 'noisy', 'unpleasant', 'neighborhood.Despite', 'desperate', 'pleas', 'when', 'finally', 'chance', 'make', 'Schmidt', 'daughter', 'going', 'wedding.It', 'reception', 'sure', 'enough', 'toast', 'made', 'best', 'man', 'clumsy', 'oafish', 'music', 'cheapo', 'disco', 'junk', 'finally', 'Schmidt', 'turn', 'bride', 'father', 'played', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'make', 'toast', 'then', 'camera', 'close-up', 'several', 'different', 'angles', 'say', 'something', 'more', 'everybody', 'glass', 'air', 'realize', 'Nicholson', 'moment', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'going', 'say', 'something', 'sarcastic', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'way', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'love', 'people', 'speech', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'anything', 'more', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'revelatory', 'powerful', 'moments', 'film', 'slug', 'head.After', 'done', 'home', 'been', 'sent', 'letter', 'teacher', 'little', 'African', 'boy', 'letter', 'picture', 'drawn', 'little', 'boy', 'Mr.', 'Schmidt', 'played', 'magnificent', 'Mr.', 'Nicholson', 'made', 'difference', 'world']",N/A

This is what I saw.About Schmidt is perfect for DVD or VHS. Images are totally clear, on-center, carrying little extraneous detail. Structure is likewise linear, one-thing-at-a-time-only, with each scene just a second too long, as if to give you time to eat TV Dinner while watching. Nicholson, at the center of every scene, carries the movie on his capable shoulders. The faults aren't his.Your typical Hollywood movie tries to go two ways on its themes. In a sense, this is true of About Schmidt. The basic plot is a thorough tragedy, but most scenes can be watched for laughs. In another sense, it's not. The tragedy is played out completely, with no happy end at all. The tragedy is that of a successful Man in The Gray Flannel Suit reaching retirement, and widowhood a bit later, and finding that neither in business nor in family has anyone any need at all for him, nor interest, except for his checks. Schmidt adapts to this by slowly but sincerely adopting the roles still allowed him, consumer and tourist.The view of American life behind this is that people meet and separate as if on a highway, with quick but superficial and exchangeable intimacies, leaving individuals with no roots and only three stable roles - hail-fellow-well-met, consumer and tourist. The problem with the view is that it's a nice High Concept but it's simply generally untrue outside Hollywood itself. About Schmidt is movie number 5432 about the Schtumps Out There, from the Glitter Factory People. To achieve its starkness, it needs a central character who never learned to listen to anyone, who is an habitual liar, and who has made an internal hobby of despising his wife, the only person on earth with a true, personal and loving interest in him. Schmidt reminded me of Dilbert's Pointy-Haired Boss. What the movie says about American life is not untrue but it's extremely partial, and Warren Schmidt fails as Everyman, where Willie Lomax succeeded in Miller's Death of a Salesman.There are other flaws. Schmidt's single child, a daughter, is getting married in her late thirties, and her in-laws are made completely over-the-top, for laughs at the level of America's Funniest Home Videos. From the first second, you can't understand why this woman of above-average intelligence would want to share her life with a waterbed salesman straight out of the Reagan era, whose dream of self-improvement is to succeed as an Amway distributor (Amway is not named).About Schmidt was launched in the Christmas season. It's a Christmas movie because of its obvious laughs and because at least in this season people have enough roots in their lives that the contrast with Schmidt will help them count their blessings.

The unexpected death of the wife triggered him to race against time to stop his daughter from marrying the loser boyfriend.  In some ways, we feel sorry for Jack's character but his character is very much a reflection of every day people, that we are victims of life circumstances.  It is not up to us.  Or that life is beyond our control sometimes.  Anyhow, towards the end, his generosity (albeit a small one)brought him an unexpected reward.  Perhaps, there's a silver lining across the rainbow afterall.  What is outstanding about this movie experience is Jack Nicholson's acting capability.

Because my secretary wanted me to share with her the movie &quot;About Schmidt&quot;, I watched it again tonight from a totally different perspective.  &quot;About Schmidt&quot; is a perfect film.  It has no flaws.  It is a masterpiece.  It will depress you if you are feeling old...will invigorate you if you are young.  If you have even an ounce of compassion and love, it will make you cry.  (I cried more this time than the first).Yes...Jack was nominated for Best Actor and the film was nominated for Best Picture of 2002.  In a league of his own, Jack Nicholson has never been more &quot;human&quot; than in &quot;About Schmidt&quot;.It is a story of life...aging...the meaning of life when you are young...when you grow old.  It is a story of loneliness...coping with it...and understanding that &quot;your&quot; life goes beyond &quot;your&quot; life.  I'm not making sense, huh?My dearest friend Darlene (who is on this e-mail trail with all of us) would appreciate this film more than I.  The two of us conjoined (what a great word for Darlene and I), when age first set in.  We were in our glory years (40ish), and we spent moments together that no one in the universe could replicate.  Jack Nicholson proved me wrong.  He sent me back in time and challenged me to grasp the meaning of life.  As he states so solemnly in this classic...&quot;Appreciate what you have while you have it.&quot;This movie is great therapy for troubled couples.  It is a masterpiece for the young and old.  You can look back, ahead...even at your current existence and come to the realization that &quot;About Schmidt&quot; is &quot;About You&quot;.Watch this flick with a box of Kleenex.  Jack will make you laugh...make you cry.  He is masterful in this masterpiece.You will never forget six-year-old Ndugu Umbo from Tanzania.You will never forget the hot tub scene when he goes to his daughter's wedding.You will never forget the scene where his wife of 42-years is vacuuming their home.In short...you will neve forget &quot;About Schmidt&quot;.  It is a perfect movie filled with life's thread.  It takes you on a path (young or old), where you have been, want to be, will be, and hopefully should be, to enjoy the total experience of life---as we know it.If there's one movie review you've read from me...please watch &quot;About Schmidt&quot;.

605996,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B00005JLSK,Publius,"[3, 4]","Unfortunately, the storyline in ""About Schmidt"" is repeated everyday throughout this nation.  In this movie, we have Warren Schmidt, a newly retired actuary, who realizes he wasted his life by attaining nothing but mediocrity.  The movie starts at the ending of Warren Schmidt's career as an insurance actuary.  Soon thereafter his wife has a stroke and dies.  After realizing his wife had an affair with his best friend, Warren decides to go on a long trip to clear his head.  His final destination is his daughter's wedding in Denver.  When he reaches Denver and spends some time with his daughter's future in-laws, he realizes his daughter is making a mistake in marrying into this family.  Unfortunately, Warren reaches this conclusion just before the wedding rehearsal dinner.  Despite Warren's pleas, the wedding goes ahead and Warren accepts the fact that he cannot change his daughter's life and because of his advanced age-he cannot change his own.  Warren seems to be a man who never had an original thought in his life.  In college, he may have had ambitions, but they were all sacrificed to live a life of comfortable mediocrity that his wife wanted and Warren just accepted.  He lived an insular life fueled by the inane babble of talk radio and all the trappings of the affluent society.  He sadly was also the victim of a dominant spouse.  We are left with the impression that Warren never did anything without the express approval of his wife.  Instead of an equal partnership between spouses, the dominant housewife is just as negative in a relationship as a dominant overbearing husband.  Overall, ""About Schmidt"" demands from its viewer to not turn your life into a charade.  If you chose to live a life dedicated to mediocrity, if you chose to be a slave to someone's else's beliefs about the way you should live, your life will just be a repeat of Warren's.

605997,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00005JLSK,"""qmlhcb""","[3, 4]","About Schmidt successfully examines the feelings of loneliness and dissatisfaction in life that many senior citizens feel at the twilight of their lives, all while providing plenty of humor amid the bleak atmosphere.Jack Nicholson plays William Schmidt, a recent retiree who loses his wife and feels that he didn't make much of a difference during his life. The film is a wonderful balance of humor and sadness, as Schmidt soon departs on a road trip on his way to his daughter's wedding in Denver. His search for a meaning in life takes him to new and old places until he finally arrives at the home of his daughter's future in-laws.Through gloomy overcast skies, deserted roads and plenty of silent moments, the film perfectly conveys what it feels like to be old and alone. But plenty of humorous moments manage to lift the viewer out of this despairing world and lighten the otherwise heavy atmosphere. It is, after all, a comedy, but one that is often laugh-out-loud funny while almost unbearably depressing. The combination somehow works wonders together. Helping the film flow is a series of letters Schmidt writes to Ndugo, a third-world child he sponsors in a feed the hungry program. It is through him that Schmidt most honestly shares his feelings and opens up to.But what drives this character film along is definitely Nicholson's portrayal of Schmidt. Gone are any of his over-the-top performances, here is plays a lonely old man so convincingly you can't help but wonder if Nicholson is emotionally well in real life. It's one of his best roles in his career, and definitely the best in recent memory. His Golden Globe win here was well deserved. Also Kathy Bates in a supporting role as his daughter's mother-in-law, is fantastic. She is such a fun character against Schmidt's bleakness.The film does suffer, however, from too long of a period prior to Schmidt's road trip. It begins to drag a bit before he finally jumps into his motor home and begins his trek. Also, though he has his share of adventures along the way, I would have liked to have seen a few more big moments on the road. His trip isn't quite as eventful as I believed it would be.About Schmidt, though, is still a wonderful movie that delves deep into the despair of growing old. Director Alexander Payne, who also helmed the film Election, shows again that he has some great talent. Though About Schmidt may not be as rewatchable as Election, due to is saddening and gloomy quality, it is no less of a great movie, and perhaps cinematically is even better. Definitely recommended, especially for Nicholson's award winning portrayal.",4,Nicholson's greatest role in years.,1043020800,"01 20, 2003",2003,2617,"['Schmidt', 'successfully', 'feelings', 'loneliness', 'dissatisfaction', 'life', 'many', 'senior', 'citizens', 'feel', 'twilight', 'lives', 'providing', 'plenty', 'humor', 'bleak', 'atmosphere.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'William', 'Schmidt', 'recent', 'retiree', 'who', 'wife', 'feels', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'life', 'film', 'wonderful', 'balance', 'humor', 'sadness', 'Schmidt', 'soon', 'road', 'trip', 'way', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Denver', 'search', 'meaning', 'life', 'new', 'old', 'places', 'finally', 'home', 'daughter', 'future', 'in-laws.Through', 'gloomy', 'overcast', 'skies', 'deserted', 'roads', 'plenty', 'silent', 'moments', 'film', 'perfectly', 'what', 'be', 'old', 'alone', 'plenty', 'humorous', 'moments', 'manage', 'lift', 'viewer', 'despairing', 'world', 'lighten', 'otherwise', 'heavy', 'atmosphere', 'comedy', 'one', 'often', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'almost', 'unbearably', 'depressing', 'combination', 'somehow', 'wonders', 'together', 'Helping', 'film', 'flow', 'series', 'letters', 'Schmidt', 'Ndugo', 'third-world', 'child', 'feed', 'hungry', 'program', 'Schmidt', 'most', 'honestly', 'shares', 'feelings', 'up', 'to.But', 'what', 'character', 'film', 'definitely', 'Nicholson', 'portrayal', 'Schmidt', 'Gone', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'here', 'lonely', 'old', 'man', 'so', 'convincingly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'Nicholson', 'emotionally', 'well', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'career', 'definitely', 'best', 'recent', 'memory', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'win', 'here', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'Also', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'supporting', 'role', 'daughter', 'mother-in-law', 'fantastic', 'such', 'fun', 'character', 'Schmidt', 'bleakness.The', 'film', 'suffer', 'however', 'too', 'long', 'period', 'prior', 'Schmidt', 'road', 'trip', 'drag', 'bit', 'finally', 'motor', 'home', 'trek', 'Also', 'share', 'adventures', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'more', 'big', 'moments', 'road', 'trip', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'eventful', 'believed', 'would', 'be.About', 'Schmidt', 'though', 'still', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'deep', 'despair', 'growing', 'old', 'Director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'who', 'also', 'helmed', 'film', 'Election', 'again', 'great', 'talent', 'Schmidt', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'rewatchable', 'Election', 'due', 'saddening', 'gloomy', 'quality', 'less', 'great', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'cinematically', 'even', 'better', 'Definitely', 'recommended', 'especially', 'Nicholson', 'award', 'winning', 'portrayal']",N/A

I think the Director of Sideways, Alexander Payne has helped the transition to more soulful, human characterizations.  Warren Schmidt is an insurance actuary crunching death statistics all day for a Nebraska insurance company.  The building is the tallest and only skyscraper in Omaha.  He goes to work.  He goes home.  He has a frumpy, frau-of-a-wife that waits on his every domestic whim and a grown daughter that lives in another city.  Hope Davis is always terrific and as a 30-something career gal that finally lands a man, a whacked-out waterbed salesman with a bizarre Denver family, she stoically handles her out of control retiree and widower dad.Yes, Schmidt is put-out-to-pasture.  He still wears a suit around the house, twiddles his thumbs, and buys a Winnebago for those retirement trips with the wife.  The wife has a heart attack just before the daughter's wedding.  Schmidt hits the road visiting some of those totems of remembrance like his childhood home that is now a tire store.  He has encounters or misadventures with Mid-Western glad-handers, moments of sexual desperation and loneliness with the likes of Kathy Bates and Cheryl Hamada.  The hot tub scene and the husbands away from the mobile home caper is a laugh.But I would be derelict of duty if I didn't mention the poignancy of Schmidt's predicament.  His only connection to reality is the twenty-two dollars he sends monthly to a little boy in an orphanage in Sumatra.  He writes long letters to the orphan five-year-old that reveals his concerns for his daughter's ill-suited boyfriend and recounts his lifetime of disappointments.  These letters are Schmidt's hopes and dreams turned upside down.  They indicate wistfulness, but not realities.Schmidt learns a life lesson by the end of the film.  A good script will do that.

The story is funny, humorous and entertaining though not that grandiose. It's simple yet appealing.It is about Schmidt and the struggles of life in the age of 66 or older. The film gave us a picture of how life goes on after retiremnet or we should say, how life goes on in the sunset of a man's life. The movie may not be appreciative for some of us but it gave us a notion of the struggles and thought-provoking concept of how one's life when he or she gets older. Schmidt realizes these things including the emotional and physical changes...he realizes his fears, angers, needs as being old that's why he longs for her daughter Jeannie to back-out from her wedding, trying to winning her back from her daughter's quirky fiance Randall and his eccentric family. We can understand from this film the very concept of getting old. The movie may be humorous but the message is serious...life is not that easy after all but life could be simple if we could only accept the reality of it's beauty and happiness and also the enourmous problems that life is encountering each day.I have never seen Jack Nicholson did a marvelous and outstanding performace of such a portrayal like Warren Schmidt. No doubt that he was honored as a Best Actor (from this film) for the The Golden Awards for a brilliant performance. I hope that Nicholson could  continue to do more simple portrayal or character such as Schmidt.Over-all, the movie is great, actors did their roles well, the direction is clean and understandable and the story is simple...It's a feel-good movie.

606001,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLSK,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 7]","""About Schmidt"" provides Jack Nicholson with a role virtually guaranteed to earn him another Best Actor Oscar to go along with the ones he garnered for ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""As Good as it Gets.""  Here he plays a 66-year old man coming to terms with the reality of his own aging and trying to figure out the meaning of the life he has lived.Warren Schmidt, like so many men his age, finds that the end of life is really made up of a series of losses - of careers, of spouses, of the hopes and dreams that come with youth.  Upon retirement, Warren feels not only that he has little purpose or direction left in his life, but that the insurance job to which he devoted almost all his time and energy was an empty enterprise, evidenced by the fact that all his old files have been thrown unceremoniously into the company junk pile (a metaphor for himself, perhaps) and that a young upstart has so quickly and so easily taken his place in the corporation.  Adding to Warren's misery is the fact that this newcomer treats Warren with the kind of patronizing dismissiveness that reduces the veteran to a complete nonentity.  Warren can no longer stand his wife of 42 years, a woman whose every idiosyncrasy drives him to distraction, yet her death early on in the film leaves Warren feeling utterly bereft and desolated.  Warren's daughter, whom he loves dearly, keeps a cool distance from the father whom she feels lost interest in her and her life many years back and, hence, no longer has the right to voice objections to the husband she has chosen for herself, a smooth-talking car salesman replete with a pigtail, a bottomless goatee, and a coterie of off-the-wall relatives.""About Schmidt,"" for much of its length, is structured like a road picture, as Warren takes to the highway in the mobile home he and his wife had bought for his retirement years but which he now travels in alone, stopping off at various locations in Nebraska and Kansas that played an important role in his early life, and ending up in Denver to try and talk some sense into his daughter on the eve of her wedding before she makes what he feels will be a fatal mistake in her life.  The best part about the Alexander Payne screenplay (based on the novel by Louis Begley), is that it feels generally spontaneous in nature.  The author is not afraid to take detours off the basic path of the story and he doesn't feel obligated to tie up all the loose ends into a nice, bright, prettily wrapped package at the end.  Warren comes to some pretty sober realizations about the minimal effect one individual's life can really have on the world around him.  Warren discovers that, painful as it may be to acknowledge, we all end up making compromises in this world which come to determine the kinds of lives we end up living.  In the end, with few exceptions, most of us achieve a kind of bland mediocrity that fills us with regret only after it is too late to do anything about it.  This is the direction Warren sees his daughter's life taking, and he wants desperately to help divert her on to a better path while there is still time.  Ultimately, however, he comes to realize that he is no position to affect that kind of radical change in another person's life and so he sadly conforms to the social amenities called for by the occasion and makes a ""heartfelt"" wedding reception toast to his daughter's happiness.  In fact, in the closing scene, he learns that it might be easier to actually leave one's mark on the world by going outside the confines of one's own immediate family and environment.  ""About Schmidt"" is almost brutally frank about such topics as the effects of aging on both the body and the spirit, the loss of love that occurs between husbands and wives after too long a time together, and the regret that comes with a life lived with no real passion or purpose.  Yet, the film itself is often slyly witty in tone, even though the humor is, occasionally, a bit more broad than it needs to be (Warren's slapstick struggle with a waterbed is a prime example).  Credit for bringing out the script's subtle comic richness goes primarily to Nicholson and the wonderful Kathy Bates, who plays Jeannie's eccentric future mother-in-law and manages to steal every single scene she is in.As director, Payne establishes a reflective, almost melancholy rhythm, one that allows the scenes to play themselves out with little sense of artificiality or hurry.  The bleak, Midwest landscape, through which Warren makes his epochal journey, provides an appropriately stark backdrop for this sad little tale, and Rolfe Kent's simple, haunting musical score enhances that feeling.Finally, of course, we have Mr. Nicholson himself.  Rarely before has this phenomenal actor seemed so at one with the character he is playing.  Stoop-shouldered and jowl-faced, Nicholson literally inhabits this man from first scene to last, making him a completely believable individual whose every action and reaction we can empathize with thoroughly and whom we come to care very deeply about by the end.  Nicholson's is a bravura, tour-de-force performance.Unlike most films, ""About Schmidt"" stays true to the seriousness of its subject, providing us only with a slight ray of hope at the end and some moments of sly humor along the way to help us through its dark, often painful reality.",4,top Nicholson performance,1042761600,"01 17, 2003",2003,5355,"['Schmidt', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'role',

The humor is aimed at those of us that can appreciate being older, feeling like life has gone by and we didn't exactly accomplish what we had hoped for.Jack Nicholson was a HOOT! From the beginning, at his retirement party, and the way he described his life, his wife and daughter, it was so real. Believable enough to be painful, but we laughed. I guess we like a movie that we can relate to the troubles of another, that we can feel that they truly understand.Life is funny, and to be able to laugh is a treasure. Poor dear, Warren Schmidt was a man that we, my hubby and I, could feel for, and laugh with, and root for.When he signs up for a Christian Children's Fund type child, the ones that you send money each month, and get a photo of a third world child, that's when I adored this man. Not going to tell you more about that - you have to see it!Kathy Bates, the wild and free mother in law, was hilarious. She was also insightful, sensitive, and she loved her boy. ""That boy is easy on the eyes, if I say so myself."" Laugh out loud funny! (her boy, was not that good looking, that's what was funny!) and the hot tub - OH My goodness!  Way too funny! then, poor Warren's back, and the waterbed, and the RV.. so much to love.I bought this DVD so I can watch it again, and again, and loan to my adult kids. not for little kids, language, nudity, and they just wouldn't get it!

He is no longer needed at work since his position was filled by a young and cocky man that rubs Warren the wrong way. In addition, he feels stuck in a passionless marriage to a woman he hardly knows and who frankly gets on his nerves. Soon after her sudden death Warren sets out in his 30-foot Winnebago to persuade his estranged daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) to not marry Randall (Dermot Mulroney), the doofus he feels is less than par for his daughter. Jeannie still holds a special place in Warren's heart despite their emotional and physical distance.What follows is an often very funny and witty sequence of events involving Warren, his Winnebago, and his desire to fill the void he fills in his heart. Upon his arrival in Denver Warren becomes acquainted with his future in-laws, most notably Roberta Hertzel (Kathy Bates). Wedding plans are in gear and Warren must face the fact that Jeannie is determined to marry Randall regardless of her father's opinion.There were several moments during ABOUT SCHMIDT that made me laugh out loud.

Very understated throughout, and a painfully funny portait of the futility associated with trying to underastand and/or cope with the meaning(lessness?)of life as many of us will know it.Nicholson gives a superbly sad and funny performance as Warren Schmidt, a recently retired widower who longs to find his place and purpose in a life basically long since past. It stirs up the feelings of doubt I'm sure we all have at one point or another, and begs the age old question - what IS it really all about? ARE we truly happy or are we just excepting the portions of drivel life serves us - and CAN we change it if we chose to?I hesitate to call this film a comedy - it can be viewed as such, but that is to only scratch the surface. It reminds me of the layered efforst in the songs of Minneapolis bands like the Jayhawks and the Replacements - it's a comedy in the sense that certain aspects of it are funny, but beneath the surface lies an ache.

606008,A1849F9YYYURV1,B00005JLSK,Sexual Harrassment Panda,"[1, 6]","Did Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, who wrote and directed together one of the true classics of 1999, Election, really write this movie? You've got to wonder. Whereas Election was uproariously funny, with interesting characters and situations, and left you wanting to watch it over and over again, About Schmidt is filled with pretty dull characters, a predictable story and overall it leaves you wanting to hurry up and get out of the cinema as soon as possible.The first hour and a half of this film is ridiculously boring. There was really nothing interesting that happened, the film was straightforward, had no real emotion and I was looking at my watch about every five minutes. It did have some good parts (Warren writing to Ndugu - his first letter is priceless) but it was looking at about 2-star territory.The last hour and a half is better. It's funnier and takes more chances on its characters. Though I still found myself quite bored and took my time during a loo break. The second half of the movie really deals with Warren seeing he has done nothing to change anybody or the world. Well, if he wasn't such a fat lazy slob in the first place he probably could've changed something - I really don't feel any sympathy for this man at all. Predictably it is shown that he ""changed"" Ndugu's life. I saw this coming a mile off and definitely didn't need that shoved in my face.The best part of this film is undoubtedly the wedding the second half of the movie. It's actually quite emotional. I was close to tears when Schmidt was giving his speech at his daughter's wedding, it didn't make me burst out into tears but I really do have a soft spot for Hope Davis, a terrific and underrated actress. She did excellent in that scene.The performances in this movie were actually quite disappointing. I was expecting the main standouts in the movie to be Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates. However this was not so. Jack Nicholson did a really good job but I don't understand how he gets an Oscar nomination when so many other actors who didn't get recognised in 2002 were so much better, like Mel Gibson or Richard Gere? He did a good job but just wasn't quite up to the standard I expected.Kathy Bates was quite dull really. It wasn't so much her fault as it was the script's fault. She really gets nothing much to do at all and shows up only for the last half an hour of the film to show her T&A.; That was truly one of the grotesque things the audience had to witness for the film, but you've gotta give Kathy Bates kudos, she has real guts and is a terrific actress. Just definitely not Oscar/Golden Globe worthy, and the critical acclaim she has been getting for a mere 15-minute role really is quite ludicrous.The main performance that really stood out for me in this film was Hope Davis. She is simply wonderful as Jeannie. I really have a soft spot for her performances, she was excellent in Hearts in Atlantis but didn't really get the chance to shine there. Here she plays quite a big part in the film and is the emotional anchor. She cries so well! One of the only times I was even close to feeling much emotion for any of the characters was at the wedding scene when she started to silently cry - that was very powerful and Davis deserves an Oscar much more than Kathy and Jack this year.There were a couple of other times I felt quite depressed or sad for the characters. One time was when Warren found out that his deceased wife had been cheating on him with his best friend - that's gotta ""be bad"". Another good emotional scene was when Schmidt talked to the heavens and asked for forgiveness from his wife. However I was not crying and hugging the person in the seat next to me like the men and women in this film. They all seemed to find it a jolly good cry-fest. Like I said before, I didn't feel too much sympathy for Schmidt so it was hard to get into the film as much as the people around me.The comedy in the movie is OK. Most of the jokes, gags or funny scenes were never laugh-out-loud funny, they were only kind of a ""ha"" from the bottom of my throat. There were a couple of scenes that had me laughing out loud though. Like when Warren first writes to Ndugu, he says some hilarious things about his wife and his life in general. Also when living with his wife, she commanded that Warren always sit down to urinate (also mentioned in the letter). Warren, when she's dead, enjoys the pleasure of standing up to ""urinate"", which is also pretty funny. The scene at the trailer-park with Warren going over to meet his new mate (played by The Mayor from Buffy, sorry, that's the only way I can remember him!) was really quite hilarious, especially the wife's facial expressions, and Warren thinking she wanted to get with him when she called him a ""Sad Sad Man!"" And Kathy Bates getting naked had me somewhere between gagging in horror and laughing out loud...This movie disappointed me. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't expecting it to be about a 4 star movie. The movie is pretty boring a lot of the time, and then it has a couple of interesting or funny scenes, and then there's some dramatic scenes, then it's back to bores-ville. I found it quite uneven to be honest. This movie was so very nearly almost a 2-star rating for me, but Hope Davis, the wedding scene and the laugh-out-loud scenes make it just above that rating.",3,Disappointing!,1050537600,"04 17,

606009,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00005JLSK,Shashank Tripathi,"[0, 2]","Great cinematography, couple of stellar yet subtle performances by Nicholson and Bates, and a very fluid Kubrick-like screenplay: what more can you ask for! The script could be argued to be fairly flat, which I'd say IS the point, but the movie stood my test of repeat viewing.About Schmidt is a depressing, cynical, condescending look at a retired person's life in the western world. The idea I guess was to depict the hapless introspection that an old man, Schmidt, finds himself in when he cannot handle a sorrow spree (retirement, wife's demise, discovery of wife's old affair with best friend) and his emotions are so bottled up that it looks like he's ready to explode at any minute. He begins to evaluate and undo everything he may have done wrong, things that were wrongly done to him, what he has accomplished, who he has lived for etc.The end result is a somewhat relaxed film, intentionally perhaps as things take their time to unfurl as in real life, but it is an intriguingly enjoyable experience.The furore over having both Nicholson and Bates in the buff -- frankly I figure the movie could really do without both of those occasions, they barely added anything to the script (no pun intended.)The DVD could surely have been better. There are long strings of text as preambles to the outtakes that we have to wade through before viewing them. So we're forced to read that material and we're forced to think about Schmidt's dilemma, not all bad, but it is so utterly depressing in the process that on balance we are not stimulated or entertained and if we don't have either of those we are not pleased with the experience.But that's no reason to skip the movie itself.

606010,A2IEUKEMM9QHOZ,B00005JLSK,Shelley Ashfield,"[5, 8]","Attention to visual detail and absolutely spot-on vignettes make this as perfect a film as I've seen in my 42 years.Schmidt's house, Schmidt's wife, Schmidt's corner office, Schmidt's paperwork, Schmidt's daughter - it becomes clear that none of them were ever his own. By its nature, you can't own your work in a corporation. But it was by his own hand that Schmidt forfeited ownership and a sense of stewardship over his personal life.Schmidt goes to visit the future in-laws and we discover the things Schmidt in fact does own - thriftiness, cleanliness and conventionality, politeness and graciousness, belief that it is virtuous to win and excell rather than just participate. We also see these virtues turn to dust when this thrifty Boy Scout turns into a tightwad, conventionality belies a poverty of creativity, cleanliness fosters a messy revolt, and politeness masks a smoldering discontent that can never quite find a way to dissipate.Schmidt also wrestles with a sexual drive that has no place to go. He is explosively and inappropriately macho with a stranger that expresses tenderness and clinical concern, yet he's alarmed and modest when confronted with too much closeness and disclosure by his future family members.What is appropriate and when have you crossed over the boundaries? That's what this movie is about. What are you really allowed in life? What can you take for yourself? What should you leave well enough alone? These are big and satisfying questions to chew on.Schmidt's daughter, too, is tortured by those same questions. She loses the one parent that validated her dreams and bucks her family's unspoken wish for her to embrace conventional virtue (which we know died somewhere in the '70s here on the East Coast, but still limps along somewhere in Nebraska). She faces her father's infantile provocations and emotional blackmail, his feeble attempts at forcing a closeness he never bothered to forge in her youth.I came away from the movie satisfied, yet unsatisfied. What would happen to Schmidt and his daughter after the credits rolled through? Would his one small act of generosity to an orphan (and more than anything, Schmidt is an orphan himself)  foster more than one magic moment for Schmidt? I don't know.I would buy this movie for my mother, I'd love for her to see it. But I won't.

Schmidt's wife dies unexpectedly, shortly before his daughters wedding. As he travels by RV to try and talk some sense into her, Schmidt contemplates the significance of his own long life along the way. The film skillfully transitions between outrageous laughs and Schmidt's sometimes unpleasant reflections.I noticed right away that About Schmidt is no ordinary comedy. I have a little trouble finding exactly the right words to describe it. At first it might seem like a black or dark comedy, and a good case could well be made. Still, that's not quite right to me, Schmidt lacks the irony I would normally expect from a dark comedy. Instead, I would describe the humor as natural, innate, uncontrived. It's the opposite of a situational comedy such as a romantic comedy or a buddy film. Schmidt has no setups and no punch lines. We simply witness Schmidt's rather ordinary life, and it just is funny.Schmidt is a man in his sixties and still adjusting to his new life of retirement when his wife dies suddenly. His life quickly descends into a total mess as he struggles to come to grips with his conflicting emotions regarding his late wife, and simple daily survival without her dutiful caretaking. Schmidt comes to focus on his daughters pending wedding to a man he considers a total loser and far beneath his little princess. He travels by RV to Denver for the wedding and has a few interesting adventures along the way. Nicholson does a fine job in his portrayal of Schmidt, a character well suited to his acting style. He spends much of the film in utter disbelief of the events going on around him, which appears to be the way he has spent his entire life. He vows to live out his remaining years to the fullest, like a new years resolution. One might jump quickly to the conclusion that Schmidt considers his life a failure. That may be, but more importantly he realizes that he cannot just turn it all around because he now has that knowledge. He's lived his life a certain way for sixty some odd years and making such a major life change after all that time is not as easy as it sounds. He can dutifully try to live it up in his remaining years but will probably find that he can't, he simply hasn't set his life up for an enjoyable retirement. Many of Schmidt's thoughts are revealed to us through his letters to Ndugu, an impoverished child he ""adopts"" from a TV charity. He reveals his innermost thoughts to this child, either not knowing or not caring that Ndugu most likely cannot read at all, and would not understand if he could.The supporting cast also does a fine job. Kathy Bates in particular provides much of the comedic relief as the mother of the clod Schmidt's daughter is marrying. I got a kick out of the scene in which she feeds soup to Schmidt, confined to his bed with neck pain. I could not help but be reminded of her role in Misery, in which she was considerably less compassionate to her ""patient"".",4,"A good, quirky comedy",1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,3037,"['Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'recently', 'retired', 'exciting', 'career', 'insurance', 'industry', 'Schmidt', 'wife', 'unexpectedly', 'shortly', 'daughters', 'wedding', 'RV', 'try', 'talk', 'sense', 'Schmidt', 'significance', 'own', 'long', 'life', 'way', 'film', 'skillfully', 'transitions', 'outrageous', 'laughs', 'Schmidt', 'sometimes', 'unpleasant', 'reflections.I', 'noticed', 'right', 'away', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'ordinary', 'comedy', 'have', 'little', 'trouble', 'finding', 'exactly', 'right', 'words', 'describe', 'first', 'might', 'seem', 'black', 'dark', 'comedy', 'good', 'case', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'made', 'Still', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'Schmidt', 'irony', 'would', 'normally', 'expect', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Instead', 'would', 'describe', 'humor', 'natural', 'innate', 'uncontrived', 'opposite', 'situational', 'comedy', 'such', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'buddy', 'film', 'Schmidt', 'setups', 'punch', 'lines', 'simply', 'witness', 'Schmidt', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'life', 'just', 'funny.Schmidt', 'man', 'sixties', 'still', 'adjusting', 'new', 'life', 'retirement', 'when', 'wife', 'suddenly', 'life', 'quickly', 'total', 'mess', 'come', 'grips', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'regarding', 'late', 'wife', 'simple', 'daily', 'survival', 'dutiful', 'caretaking', 'Schmidt', 'focus', 'daughters', 'pending', 'wedding', 'man', 'total', 'loser', 'far', 'beneath', 'little', 'princess', 'RV', 'Denver', 'wedding', 'few', 'interesting', 'adventures', 'way', 'Nicholson', 'fine', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Schmidt', 'character', 'well', 'suited', 'acting', 'style', 'much', 'film', 'utter', 'disbelief', 'events', 'going', 'be', 'way', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'live', 'out', 'remaining', 'years', 'fullest', 'new', 'years', 'resolution', 'One', 'might', 'jump', 'quickly', 'conclusion', 'Schmidt', 'life', 'failure', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'importantly', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'turn', 'around', 'now', 'knowledge', 'lived', 'life', 'certain', 'way', 'sixty', 'odd', 'years', 'making', 'such', 'major', 'life', 'change', 'time', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'can', 'dutifully', 'try', 'live', 'up', 'remaining', 'years', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', ""n't"", 'set', 'life', 'up', 'enjoyable', 'retirement', 'Many', 'Schmidt', 'thoughts', 'are', 'revealed', 'letters', 'Ndugu', 'impoverished', 'child', 'adopts', 'TV', 'charity', 'innermost', 'thoughts', 'child', 'either', 'not', 'knowing', 'not', 'caring', 'Ndugu', 'most', 'likely', 'can', 'not', 'read', 'would', 'not', 'understand', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'particular', 'much', 'comedic', 'relief', 'mother', 'clod', 'Schmidt', 'daughter', 'marrying', 'got', 'kick', 'scene', 'soup', 'Schmidt', 'confined', 'bed', 'neck', 'pain', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'reminded', 'role', 'Misery', 'was', 'considerably', 'less', 'compassionate', 'patient']",N/A

He is wiser, subtler, and quietly powerful. ... You feel as though you're cornered, like he has you all to himself.Yes it's that good!!Whilst Jack is of course, what the whole film centers around, don't let that the other performances are satisfactory. They're all wonderful, from Kathy Bates,who charms the movie with her in-your-face humor, to less well-known actors who add some ingredient to the movie. This movie is as real as it gets. People who said this movie was depressing, I find it I can't blame them. We get fed so much fluff fed to us over the course of modern cinema, that we can't accept it when a movie is made with no fluff,no glitz, and no multi-bazzilion budget written all over it. No doubt this movie takes patience, and an open mind. Now, I'm a 13 year old girl who fell in LOVE with this movie.But that's not saying much, since I may be perhaps one of the only 13 year old kids who actually did enjoy it. And maybe, many will be embarassed to go see this movie, as it circles mostly around the senior age group..., but that too may be what turned off all these people.

As Nicholson starts contemplating his life, his marriage, and his choices, his wife dies leaving him to make probably the most important choice of his life: to rediscover himself. And what does Nicholson's character do?  He jumps on a Winnebago and starts wandering about meeting other pointless characters having pointless conversations and drinking beer . The only thing he rediscovers is the highway (albeit a small part of it...)Nicholson seems to be dragged down by the numbingly flat script and gives a below par performance. In all honesty: were it not for Nicholson starring in this flick would there be any reason to remember it for? Absolutely not and even that is not enough of a motive to go see this.In fact, all the characters in the movie are unimaginative, boring, super-insignificant.. All, with the exception of Cathy Bates who is salvaged because of a couple of vibrant punchlines.Included are gimmicks such as the one where big Jack is updating an african kid about the developments in his life (to whom he's come in contact through a charity) by writting letters to him. This is utilised so we hear the character's thoughts as his life goes into turmoil but instead we get more boredom.The letters to ""Ndugu"" are used to introduce a humorous feeling to it all but that doesn't work either as the humor is B-level stuff at best.Perhaps the only thing that's truly funny about this film is that it caused oscar nominations.

Jack Nicholson's magnificent portrayal of Warren R. Schmidt. From beginning to tear-jerking finale(yes, I did indeed cry at the conclusion of this film), Jack shows why he is not only the greatest living actor in the world, but arguably one of the finest actors of all time. He hides pain, sadness, anger and confusion in the character of Warren so well, that I almost felt as if this were a documentary about an actual person. I have not seen such magnificent character acting since Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Lester Burnham in ""American Beauty."" I was so moved by Jack's performance and his ability to steal the spotlight of every scene that he is in. Alex Payne, much like he did in the absolutely hysterical ""Election,"" has brought a blistering sense of dark humor to the film, so much so that I had to pause the film several times because I was laughing so hard. Take for instance the letters between Warren and Ndugu, the 6 year old boy from Africa that Warren has 'adopted' for $22.00 a month. Warren writes down his inner most feelings in these letters - from his disappointing marriage, to the guy who replaced him at work to his thoughts about life and death. Of course a 6 year old would have no idea what he was talking about, but the manner in which Warren communicates is quite comical. These letters are also the cause for the heart-warming and teary-eyed finale. Overall, I found this character to be more realistic and easier to realte to than Adrien Brody in ""The Pianist.""

606027,A3NJCGROMKG9SR,B00005JLSK,"The Old Philosopher ""The Old Philosopher""","[4, 8]","About Schmidt is a man's story, and most women won't get it. The nuances of Schmidt's life are subtle, understated, the way men communicate emotions. When the story opens Schmidt is the henpecked and dominated husband dutifully supporting the arrogant self centered wife he has long since stopped loving and likewise long since accepted as his millstone of life. He works a thankless job in some insurance office with such high importance that after he retires they toss all his files in the trash and never misses him. His wife has decided that she would sell some of ""her"" stock to buy a large motor home and go traveling after his retirement. He doesn't want to, it's going to be more of the same labor to please her, but he gave up objecting many years before. Then one day wife just plops over dead while doing the laundry. Schmidt doesn't mourn nor celebrate, he just accepts. He's relieved to be free of the millstone around his neck, but at a loss to know what to do with his newly empty life.  He sees a TV ad for a program to support impoverished African children so he begins a correspondence with Ndugu, a pen-pal relationship that continues through the movie.He's got no job, no wife, no kids, and no particular reason to do anything.  That is except to go to his ungrateful daughter's wedding. She's marrying some underachieving young man in another state.  So Schmidt closes the big house and starts off in the motor home to find America and find himself.  Along the way he learns about dating modern women when a very flirtatious bimbo screams ""RAPE"" the first time he touches her. One morning he finds himself just parked along the side of a small river watching the world flow by.  He does a candle lit farewell ceremony for his departed wife on the roof of the motor home, and then drives away leaving the icons to slide off on the roadside.The mother of his future son-in-law tries to seduce him in her hot tub, and he's not ready for her yet. The other characters are not true to life, perhaps as seen through the eyes of Schmidt, a man who is re-learning to feel the world and to have his own life again.I found Schmidt to be a poignant story of every man who works all his life and buries his own needs and feelings to support his wife and family.  Though on the surface, it seem sad, beneath the surface ""About Schmidt"" is a celebration of all the things that are good about men.  Schmidt's whole life has been spend helping and caring for others. Like so many men he spent his life giving of himself, his time, his money, his feelings, and his love to others, even though they usually don't notice or appreciate him.  He's temporarily lost his way when he has nobody to give to or support any more, but even then he's giving to a poor child who needs him, Ndugu the African girl.  Schmidt is every man who works hard and sacrifices himself to help others, and finds his own simple rewards in knowing that they, not he, is being taken care of. It is a celebration of all that is good in every man.It's not boring unless you're so shallow you can't see beneath the surface.It's not about Nicholson's acting unless you're so shallow you miss the meaning of the story.It's not a sad story unless you overlook the celebration of the wonders of men.It's not empty unless you can't understand the lives of men.It's not comedy unless you can laugh at yourself and your own life.It's not about nude hot tub scenes unless you're so shallow that naked flesh is more important than life itself.It's not about a road trip unless you haven't been anywhere and don't know where you are.It's not a movie for young people because they probably won't understand yet.Yes, Nicholson's acting is superb, the actor disappears into the character, but that's not why you see the movie.  Yes, there are funny bits, and sad moments, but that's not what this movie is about.  It is a celebration of men, of every man, of husbands and fathers, of insurance salesmen and maintenance workers, of the guy who mows the lawn and takes out the garbage, of the lives of men, of every man who ever put someone else's needs before his own.  Don't see it unless you are a man, or love men.  The men have names, are not left for dead as body count, and matter.  It's a man's story, not a woman's story.  If you are a man, or love men, see this movie.",4,"A man's story, you either get it or you don't",1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,4336,"['Schmidt', 'man', 'story', 'most', 'women', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'nuances', 'Schmidt', 'life', 'are', 'subtle', 'understated', 'way', 'men', 'communicate', 'emotions', 'When', 'story', 'Schmidt', 'henpecked', 'dominated', 'husband', 'dutifully', 'supporting', 'arrogant', 'self', 'centered', 'wife', 'long', 'stopped', 'loving', 'likewise', 'long', 'accepted', 'millstone', 'life', 'thankless', 'job', 'insurance', 'office', 'such', 'high', 'importance', 'files', 'trash', 'never', 'wife', 'decided', 'would', 'sell', 'stock', 'buy', 'large', 'motor', 'home', 'go', 'traveling', 'retirement', ""n't"", 'want', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'same', 'labor', 'please', 'gave', 'up', 'objecting', 'many', 'years', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'wife', 'just', 'over', 'dead', 'doing', 'laundry', 'Schmidt', ""n't"", 'mourn', 'celebrate', 'just', 'accepts', 'relieved', 'be', 'free', 'millstone', 'neck', 'loss', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'newly', 'empty', 'life', 'TV', 'ad', 'program', 'support', 'impoverished', 'African', 'children', 'so', 'correspondence', 'Ndugu', 'pen-pal', 'relationship', 'movie.He', 'got', 'job', 'wife', 'kids', 'particular', 'reason', 'do', 'anything', 'go', 'ungrateful', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'marrying', 'underachieving', 'young', 'man', 'state', 'So', 'Schmidt', 'big', 'house', 'off', 'motor', 'home', 'find', 'America', 'find', 'way', 'dating', 'modern', 'women', 'when', 'very', 'flirtatious', 'bimbo', 'screams', 'RAPE', 'first', 'time', 'One', 'morning', 'just', 'parked', 'side', 'small', 'river', 'watching', 'world', 'flow', 'candle', 'lit', 'farewell', 'ceremony', 'departed', 'wife', 'roof', 'motor', 'home', 'then', 'away', 'leaving', 'icons', 'slide', 'off', 'roadside.The', 'mother', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'tries', 'seduce', 'hot', 'tub', 'not', 'ready', 'yet', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'true', 'life', 'perhaps', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Schmidt', 'man', 'who', 're-learning', 'feel', 'world', 'have', 'own', 'life', 'again.I', 'found', 'Schmidt', 'be', 'poignant', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'own', 'needs', 'feelings', 'support', 'wife', 'family', 'surface', 'seem', 'sad', 'surface', 'Schmidt', 'celebration', 'things', 'are', 'good', 'men', 'Schmidt', 'whole', 'life', 'been', 'spend', 'helping', 'caring', 'others', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'spent', 'life', 'giving', 'time', 'money', 'feelings', 'love', 'others', 'even', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'appreciate', 'temporarily', 'lost', 'way', 'when', 'nobody', 'give', 'support', 'more', 'even', 'then', 'giving', 'poor', 'child', 'who', 'Ndugu', 'African', 'girl', 'Schmidt', 'man', 'who', 'hard', 'help', 'others', 'own', 'simple', 'rewards', 'knowing', 'not', 'being', 'taken', 'care', 'celebration', 'good', 'man.It', 'not', 'boring', ""'re"", 'so', 'shallow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'surface.It', 'not', 'Nicholson', 'acting', ""'re"", 'so', 'shallow', 'miss', 'meaning', 'story.It', 'not', 'sad', 'story', 'overlook', 'celebration', 'wonders', 'men.It', 'not', 'empty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'lives', 'men.It', 'not', 'comedy', 'can', 'laugh', 'own', 'life.It', 'not', 'nude', 'hot', 'tub', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'so', 'shallow', 'naked', 'flesh', 'more', 'important', 'life', 'itself.It', 'not', 'road', 'trip', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'anywhere', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'are.It', 'not', 'movie', 'young', 'people', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'yet.Yes', 'Nicholson', 'acting', 'superb', 'actor', 'character', 'not', 'why', 'see', 'movie', 'Yes', 'are', 'funny', 'bits', 'sad', 'moments', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'celebration', 'men', 'man', 'husbands', 'fathers', 'insurance', 'salesmen', 'maintenance', 'workers', 'guy', 'who', 'lawn', 'out', 'garbage', 'lives', 'men', 'man', 'who', 'ever', 'put', 'someone', 'else', 'needs', 'own', 'Do', ""n't"", 'see', 'are', 'man', 'love', 'men', 'men', 'have', 'names', 'are', 'not', 'left', 'dead', 'body', 'count', 'matter', 'man', 'story', 'not', 'woman', 'story', 'are', 'man', 'love', 'men', 'see', 'movie']",N/A

606032,A22QPZWME85Z8T,B00005JLSK,"Timothy Hammond ""Movie Geek""","[3, 3]","""About Schmidt"" is certainly not a film for everyone. Those who want what passes for ""action"" these days, those who don't like films that make you think, and those who don't like to be forced to look at some of the more unpleasant aspects of life need not apply.  However, for the rest of us who like to be occasionally challenged by a film, ""About Schmidt"" is a veritable masterpiece, and in my eyes a powerful warning against the complacency and conformity that our society breeds.For the most part, we are taught to chase the so-called  ""American Dream"", a dream in which we go to college, graduate and get a job in some office where we work from 9 to 5 for the greater part of our lives.  When we get too old, we are replaced by someone younger, much like an old cog is replaced in a machine.  Not to worry though, for now we are finally free to enjoy life.  The problem is, at this point we have become so dependent upon routine, we don't know how to enjoy life or what to do with ourselves.  We are left feeling useless, lonely and forgotten, struggling to prove to ourselves that our lives actually mattered.This is where we find Warren Schmidt. He has been rendered numb by the banality of his existence within the ""American Dream"".  However, a series of life shaking events awaken him from his sleepwalking and force him to confront his very existence.  He begins a journey, slowly waking up to life while seeking to find some way in which he has made a difference in the world.Along the way, this film confronts these difficult issues and exlplores the alarming loss of humanity in the face of routine and conformity.  Should identity be sacrificed for the sake of keeping the machine humming along?

Suffice it to say that Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt, an aging Nebraskan whose life has been pretty meaningless. For the rest of the story, read the other reviews. But the acting was superb. Schmidt's soon-to-be son-in-law is a waterbed salesman. I've never seen the actor before but he was well cast. And his family is a blast, especially--was it is brother, who looks like he's half buzzed?Kathy Bates, as usual, can't be beat. She's flamboyant, inconsiderate, opinionated--and at the wedding wears an outfit that rivals the threads worn by Woopie Goldberg in ""Ghost."" Oh, and in the hot tub scene she's nude, busting anyone's porn fantasies.What I like about the DVD, though, is that the additional footage is relevant! There were scenes cut from the final, and the director describes why the scenes were cut. In the case of one, it was a little too ""film schooly"" for his tastes.

He struggles to become adjusted but after a traumatic incident he decides to go on a road trip in his new deluxe RV, the Adventurer.  Eventually on his trip he arrives in Denver to attend his daughter's wedding.  This is a pretty good movie with an excellent cast.  Some of the best moments involve Nicholson writing letters to a Tanzanian boy, Ndugu, who he sponsors and sends a check every month.  There are scenes that are hysterical and those that make you want to cry.Jack Nicholson is great as recent retiree, Warren Schmidt.  He does a perfect job of showing all sides of the man especially the crazy outbursts he has occasionally.  I believe he deserved the Oscar although Adrien Brody was very deserving.  Kathy Bates stars as Roberta, the mother of the man Warren's daughter is marrying.  She is eccentric in everyway, a kind of hippie stuck in a different generation.  Hope Davis plays Jeanie, Warren's daughter, very well while Dermot Mulroney stars as Randall, the groom.  The movie tries to portray him as a slimebag, but I actually liked his character.  This is a very good movie that does have a message even though several reviewers don't think so.  Warren asks himself,&quot; What difference have I made in other people's lives?&quot;  The ending is perfect for the movie.  Also, this movie does not think so highly of Midwesterners, but I do not think the producer set out to make a film that knocks midwesterners, it just happened that way.  The DVD is well worth the buy with widescreen presentation, several trailer, mini-documentaries on Omaha, and deleted scenes, several of which are very funny.

606035,A4JHEO7H330AF,B00005JLSK,Tom Brody,"[5, 5]","The film tells a story about an insurance company executive during his transition into retirement.  The film begins with the man's last hour in his office, empty except for a wall of boxes containing his recent work product, e.g., memos and reports. We see the hands of the clock inching their way to five o'clock.  The man (Jack Nicholson) sits for a minute, just staring at the empty walls of his office.  We see the man's retirement party, held at Johnny's Cafe.  (In a big city, Johnny's Cafe would be considered a sleazy dive, but in the mid-west, it is elegant.)  Shortly into the era of retirement, there are some other transitions, notably the death of the man's wife by way of a heart attack, and the marriage of his daughter to a dim-witted waterbed salesman.The overall theme of the story is one of impending loneliness and alienation.  First, Jack Nicholson faces retirement.  Second, it is apparent that his old company has no need for him any more, not even as a consultant.  Third, the daughter moves several hundred miles away to get married.  Fourth, the daughter marries a man who is intellectually inferior to Jack Nicholson, a situation that creates further alienation. Fifth, Jack Nicholson muses about the notion that he was never close to his wife, asking, ""Who is this old woman who lives in my house?""  He muses about her irritating habits, her Hummel doll collection, her practice of cutting off his attempts to talk when company is over, her large buttocks, and her instructions to Jack Nicholson that he must always sit down when micturating.  Sixth, alienation is further increased when Jack Nicholson discovers old love letters from his best friend (Ray) to his wife.  Seventh, alienation is also shown by the prolonged, three-second dwell time of the camera on an empty airport hallway, after his daughter boards an airplane.  Eighth, the bleak mid-western landscape further increases the sense of loneliness.  Ninth, a brief image of Jack Nicholson in the act of writing a letter to the orphan boy indicates that the character feels himself to be ""dead.""  Here, Jack Nicholson is shown writing the letter in his bathtub, where the scene in the movie mimics the murder painting, The Death of Marat, by Jaques Louis David (1793).As a band-aid for reducing the surge of loneliness and alienation, Jack Nicholson begins the practice of writing letters to an orphan boy in Africa.  Also, Jack Nicholson visits his boyhood home, boyhood school, and alma mater.  But as one might expect, the home was torn down and replaced by something else--a tire store.  While in the tire store, Jack Nicholson gestures to a location in the premises and exclaims, ""My tire swing was right over there.""  The background music is excellent at this point, as it contains the word ""sentimental""--Sentimental Lady by Bob Welch (""Sentimental gentle wind, Blowing through my life again, Sentimental lady, Gentle one"").The film concludes with Jack Nicholson receiving and reading a letter from a nun in Africa and a drawing from the orphan boy.  The drawing, which is a stick drawing of a boy holding hands with a man, strikes an emotional nerve in Jack Nicholson, and then the film concludes.  The entire film sets us up to understand Mr. Nicholson's momentary emotional upset, that is, his emotional reaction to a stick figure drawing.The film, About Schmidt, might be compared with Citizen Kane, with Orson Wells.  Both films derive their impact, in part, by the fact that an old man acquires spiritual strength from something that normally would be considered to be of little or no consequence (a drawing from orphan boy in About Schmidt; a childhood sled called ""Rosebud"" in Citizen Kane).This is about the excellent caracterization of the son-in-law character. The son-in-law talks trailer-trash talk, e.g., ""I'm really stoked!"" or ""How's it hanging?"" The son-in-law's bedroom contains colorful ribbons suggesting accomplishments as a teenager.  However, the ribbons are only for being a PARTICIPANT and not for actually winning.  Also, the bedroom wall shows a certificate for completing an electronics course.  But the camera pans down, and we see that the course was only TWO WEEKS LONG, and furthermore, the certificate was given for PERFECT ATTENDANCE.  Another subtle depiction of the lower social class family, is the disgusting roast beef at the wedding banquet.  The camera dwells lovingly for several moments on the jagged carcass, cloaked with slabs of white fat, reenforcing our understanding that the groom is from a lower social class.Every nuance of the son-in-law's trailer-trash family is an amusing delight, for example, their public speeches, their house decor, their susceptibility to pyramid schemes, and the true mark of the lower classes----the ease at which they fall into pointless bickering.Kathy Bates plays the son-in-law's mother.  Some reviewers have expressed surprise at her brief nudity scene while climbing into a hot tub.  However, she appeared in another brief nude scene in, At Play in the Fields of the Lord (1991).  Also, the director of the film should be commended in using persons of Asian descent in bit parts.  Fifty years ago, one might never encounter an Asian person in small towns throughout the mid-west.  But About Schmidt features two Asian persons in bit parts.It might be argued that the film, About Schmidt, is based on a false premise.  The script teaches or suggests that a man cannot derive ""meaning of life"" from being a business executive.  But a business executive's career is filled with many interesting interactions with other people, mountains of problem-solving, frequent exercises of creativity, and often a beneficial effect on society.There are comedic moments, one of which, is a reprise from AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  You might remember the Baltimore seafood restaurant scene, where Jack Nicholson pays Helen Hunt the ultimate compliment and then blows it.  The compliment was, ""You make me want to be a better man.""  The same sort of transition occurs in ABOUT SCHMIDT, where Jack Nicholson is getting cosy with another man's wife in her RV.Jack: I am kind of lonely.Wife: I knew it.Jack: Can I tell you something?Wife: I'm listening.Jack (reprising the scene in As Good As It Gets): I've only known you for an hour or so, and yet I feel like you understand me better than my wife Helen ever did, even after 42 years of marriage.(What happens next provides comic relief to this somber-toned movie.)There is yet another parallel with AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  In this movie, Jack Nicholson cries because he grows fond of a small dog.  In ABOUT SCHMIDT, Jack Nicholson cries because he received a charming drawing from an African orphan.The film deserves FIVE STARS for its splendid characterizations of the elderly business executive (Jack Nicholson), a middle aged couple in an RV (comedic scene), a politely arrogant young business executive (Nicholson's replacement), the lower class brother-in-law, and the brother-in-law's hippie mother (Kathy Bates).",5,"The film is based on a questionable premise, but the acting is superb.",1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,7025,"['film', 'story', 'insurance', 'company', 'executive',

606036,A2JA9LYSXZES1A,B00005JLSK,"""truthandjustice""","[2, 4]","This movie has a little bit of everything-comedy, sadness, happiness, all the things that we all face during our lifetimes.  Jack is really great in this movie, not at all what I expected him to be, though.  He has just retired as an executive at an insurance company and is at a loss.  When he volunteers to help the new guy ease into his old job, his help is politely refused, making him aware that he was an easily replaced employee.  After 42 years of a so-so marriage, his wife dies suddenly and Jack is in limbo.His daughter, who he has never been close to, is getting married and he doesn't think the man she is marrying is good enough for her.  He decides to take his Winnebago and go see her before the wedding to try and talk her out of it, but she makes excuses for him not to come too early and he decides to take a slow tourist trip, instead, to pass some of the time.  He is a rather boring sort of person.To help make him feel needed he has started writing and sending money to an orphan overseas.  He tells the boy all his problems, etc. in his letters, problems I'm sure the boy wouldn't understand, but it makes Schmidt feel better just to be able to tell someone what he has been feeling.Kathy Bates, plays the kooky, hippy to be mother-in-law and hosts Schmidt at her house for the wedding.  The hot-tub scene is hilarious.  Schmidt is a little bewildered and put off with the family his daughter is marrying into as they are oddballs and just watching his interactions with them makes you grin.I was impressed at his speech at the wedding reception and had a good chuckle, while still feeling a burst of admiration at how he expressed himself.Jack and Kathy Bates stand out in this movie along with a good cast of other characters.  If you enjoy easy, slow humor and drama then I think you will like the movie, but if you are looking for an action packed film, this is not it.  I enjoyed watching it, and although there were a few slow spots (why only 4 stars), I thought it was quite entertaining.

606037,A1K2ACRU9YJS17,B00005JLSK,"Tsila Sofer Elguez ""Tsila Sofer Elguez""","[0, 0]","As many of the former reviewers discussed the film's content, I would like to comment about several other aspects of this movie - First of all how refreshing it is to see a movie about older people and not to see another group of gorgeous young actors. Although I am not close to this age yet I think that many people around me, including myself, live their lives preparing for the ""retirement day"" in the sense they make decisions which are aimed at ""wanting to feel good about my life when I look back on it"". People are afraid of the day when you will need to answer to YOURSELF how you feel about the choices you made. The attempt this movie makes at trying to deal with this issue is noteworthy.The film does not leave you with a good feeling. One of the former reviewers has already noted that this is one film he is going to avoid watching again. I feel this is true - not because this is not a good film but as it deals with feelings you do not wish to feel: bitterness, despair, a sense of no direction, hopelessness and a lot of anger. A feeling that there is so little you can do to change... although presented by some as a comedy I think the only comic parts serve as a true ""comic relief"" when the diretor chose to let you laugh rather then cry (people at the theater laughed every time the words ""Dear Ndugu..."" were heard, but I don't think anyone really thought it is funny to have a far away 6 year old as your only close soul). Schmidt's character undergoes several stages of mourning - a mourning about his personal ""lost life"" - a life that was wasted in many aspects including lack of real communication, lack of love and a no real connection to people - not even those closest to him; a mourning of his inability to influence, to change (his daughter's marriage decision stands out in this regard - she is so indifferent to her father's opinion she does not even bother to ask what are his reasons)and also a mourning of Helen, his dead wife whose loss raises so many conflicting emotions - until a final ""reconciliation"" with her memory is acheived in the ""night outside"". However, this is not a reconcilliation the ""Hollywood style"". You do not feel that Schmidt looks back at Helen's memory with loving eyes. Helen's loss seems to me more of ""Schmidt's loss of himself as he knew himself"" rather then her loss as a unique person. Her loss forces Schmidt to think what HE wants to do now that she is gone, as she was probably the one who made the plans for their future and the caravan tour (which he did not seem to be so happy about). A scene that did not seem to get a lot of attention is the scene where Warren Schmidt visits his fellow campers and joins in on their meal in what seems to start as a heart warming scene of Schmidt finally reaching out and connecting to other people; this scene quickly turns into another case of miscommunication where Schmidt is overwhelmed by Vicki's ability to ""see through him"" and interprets her friendliness as an advance or maybe is so overcome by himself he reacts in the only ""closeness"" act he knows. His act causes such rejection he has no choice but to run away. This scene is also a good example of how truly unexpected this movie is. The scenes take an unexpected twist and are never what you expect. I for example was exepcting Schmidt to reach some sort of reconcilliation and understanding of his daughter's motives (re her marriage) and maybe some understanding of how her emotion-empty childhood led her to look for a warm (if somewhat crazy) family such as Randal's where Roberta and Larry, Randal's divorced parents and their constant fighting seem ""more married"" then Warren and Helen ever were - however, this is not what happens. Schmidt understands he has to put on a social show, which he succeeds in doing at jeannie's wedding. He hides his real thoughts and gives Randal's family a welcoming speech.

Looking for a way to fill his now empty days, he is persuaded  by a TV ad to give money to a charity to feed starving children in Tanzania. When the information packet arrives, it includes a photo of his new foster child and encourages him to write a letter to the boy to introduce himself. The film uses this letter writing as a vehicle for Schmidt to humorously and poignantly relect on his life. He and his wife have big plans to see America in their new motor home, but her sudden and unexpected demise puts an end to that. So, he sets off on a journey halfway across country to reconnect with his only daughter, who's about to marry an affable loser that he can't stand. While the story has its comical elements (the goofy future son-in-law and his eccentric parents), it will seem to many to be depressing in its portrayal of the average working stiff as a lost soul whose life is of little consequence in the grand scheme of things.

606045,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00005JLSK,wellwellwell,"[1, 1]","Jack Nicholson is one of those actors who, when in a movie, either makes the movie or breaks it.  In `About Schmidt', Jack easily makes the movie a worthwhile experience.  And although his latter blockbuster `Anger Management' seemed to have more success at the box office, his performance here is much, much better.  As it has been said, this is a very depressing movie from all angles.  So if you don't like gloomy, depressing movies (to begin with), don't watch this one.  It moves at a slow pace; a pace that works wonders for the type of movie this is.  A drama, that is.  Even with the endless bits of melancholy and sadness, Jack, with some help from Kathy Bates, manages to fabricate many humorous lines and situations that make it amiable enough for just about anyone to watch.  In the end though, it seems to be designed for a more mature audience (hence my title).  An overview...Jack Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt.  The movie begins with the retirement party for Warren, who, after countless years at the insurance agency office, is finally letting go.  He struggles over feeling useless and as if he is unneeded (or unwanted) in the big, bad world.  That feeling is the feeling that is used throughout the movie; a feeling you'll either attach yourself to from the start or hate.  He has one daughter, Jeannie (played by Hope Davis), who is engaged to a guy who in the mind of Warren, is a deadbeat underachiever.  The one stability in his life seems to be his wife.  She's always there for him, cooking for him, reminding him of things, and so on and so forth.  But even that bright spot in his life doesn't seem to help him cope with his unhappiness.  He even goes on a rant about all the things Helen (his wife) does that bother him.  That rant is part of an important piece of the movie's puzzle.  In order to try to fill the void left in Warren's spirit, he decides to donate $22 a month to a charity; helping one underprivileged child get medical care, food and whatnot.  Along with his checks, Warren inserts a letter to Ndugo (`en-do-goo') telling him about his life achievements and his feelings towards them.  Those letters are read in voiceover, and are very important.  They allow for us to learn about Schmidt (no pun intended) directly through his private thoughts rather than just his actions.  Those parts of the movie were some of the most amazing, and certainly the most informative.  After he writes his first letter to Ndugo, his wife dies.  As if being out of work and having a ""nincompoop"" of a son-in-law weren't enough, right?  So after the funeral, which Warren labels: ""well attended"", he hits the road in hopes of stopping his daughter from marrying that guy who's ""not up to snuff"".  Oh, but not before he finds out his wife of 42 years cheated on him 15 years ago with his best friend of 20 years.  With all the things already lagging him, that doesn't even seem to phase him.  In fact, it almost motivates him.  Along the way through Nebraska and Kansas he makes many stops at particular places (his childhood house, his former college, random museums, etc).  All of those stops are very unique as their results capture the ""lost"" feeling that Nicholson's character obviously possesses.  During his mobile home'd journey he continues writing letters to the child he sponsors, and eventually makes it to the Hertzel family home--the family of which Warren`s daughter is about to marry into.  Here we are introduced to the character of Roberta (vividly played by Kathy Bates).  Roberta is kind of a spontaneous individual; someone who says what's on her mind but maintains the same outlook on life.  Here role, beside Jack, is absolutely great.  Without her addition the film's prominence would've been greatly lacking.  The way those two interact is priceless.  I do have to make note that the R rating for `About Schmidt' is only because of Kathy Bates.  She uses countless swears and even appears nude for a few seconds, which was horribly nasty.  I didn't find that as funny as I think it was intended to be.  From there we see Warren struggle forward and backwards in his attempt to stop the wedding.  And that attempt is basically a concealed effort to do some good in a life he views as insignificant and overly useless.I think that is where I'll leave you.  I have some strong opinions about the ending and those opinions are the only things that keep the movie from being 5 stars (in my mind).  But I never like to spoil movie endings and this is no place to start.  A spoiler here wouldn't do justice to `About Schmidt' and its brilliance as a truly great film.  You have to see the movie to believe (and understand) it.  All the praise put over the head of this film is certainly supported by the script, the direction, and more importantly, the cast.  The performances by just about all the actors were great (at least the leading roles) to the point of categorically perfect.  So if you like Jack Nicholson, you'll love his performance just as much here as anywhere else; if not more.

606046,A18M68DE1Y6W51,B00005JLSK,Wendy Kaplan,"[2, 4]","Anything that stars Jack Nicholson and features a bravura comic turn by Kathy Bates can't be all bad, and such is the case with &quot;About Schmidt,&quot; which otherwise deals with a tired and hackneyed plot line.Nicholson plays Warren Schmidt, who, as the film opens, is forced into retirement at age 66 at the insurance company for which he has been an executive for lo these many years. Particularly galling to Warren is his replacement, a smarmily confident young man whse only asset, it seems, is his youth.Schmidt goes into the predictable post-retirement slump (put &quot;All My Sons&quot; out of your mind!), which is greatly exacerbated by the upcoming wedding of his beloved only daughter (and only child) to an idiot water-bed salesman. As Warren's depresssion deepens, his wife of 42 years dies suddenly and unexpectedly, and now we get to explore widow(er)hood as well as retirement.What saves the movie, as mentioned above, is Jack Nicholson's truly sensitive portrayal of the anguished and depressed Schmidt. He plays it with a large dollop of humor mixed in with the pathos, thus saving the movie from parody. As his character motors in an impossibly large Winnebago from Kansas to Denver, where his daughter's wedding is scheduled to take place, his has a number of improbable adventures that add to his despair.Once in Denver, he meets the groom's mother (Kathy Bates), who does a star turn as an over-the-top Colorado hippie who is still very much 16 in her mind. Bates deserves kudos for daring to bare it all (however briefly) in a hot-tub scene that, while it has the viewer roaring with laughter, is still sensitive and sad.The best part of the DVD, in my opinion, is the look at the deleted scenes. The director's comments are done in writing, almost in textbook form, before each scene, and for this viewer, it was almost like a course in film editing. I like to agree or disagree with the cuts from my armchair, and in this case, I agreed.Watch it for Jack and Kathy, both at their acting peaks.

606048,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00005JLSK,Wheelchair Assassin,"[4, 7]","""About Schmidt"" is, simply put, a milestone in American cinema.  Coming off ""Election,"" which was quite possibly the funniest movie of all time, director Alexander Payne delivered another classic here, but one of a different stripe.  With Jack Nicholson delivering a performance that's somehow both low-key and passionate, this character study relentlessly examines the darker side of human existence, plumbing the depths of despair and hopelessness.  However, the central character isn't a serial killer, a sex offender, or some similar paragon of depravity.  Instead, he's a quiet, 66-year-old newly retired actuary from Nebraska named Warren Schmidt.  That's what really makes this movie so depressing: someday, maybe not too far off, any of us could wind up like this movie's antihero, retired, widowed, and feeling useless.Alexander Payne's portrait of Midwestern suburban life is almost unrelentingly bleak, following its main character around and focusing on all the tiny indignities that steadily pile up on him.  The relentlessly self-analytical Warren has examined his life in search of some higher purpose, and he's come up lacking.  Looking back he can see only missed opportunities and pointless toil, and looking ahead he only glimpses loneliness and impending death.  He has only two things left that give his life any semblance of meaning: his attempts to prevent his beloved daughter from marrying a mulleted, fu-manchued waterbed salesman named Randall; and Ndugu, the Tanzanian orphan whom he starts supporting financially early in the movie.  Warren's letters to Ndugu serve as a perfect framing device, providing a window to the internal conflicts that roil beneath his quiet exterior.Since the monstrous shadow of ""Election"" looms over this movie for its entire two hours, comparisons are all but inevitable, and I might as well make mine now.  Both movies are allegorical tales set in white-bread Nebraska locales, but ""Election"" is a screwball comedy anchored by a serious plot, while ""About Schmidt"" is a dark tale of quiet desparation and self-reflection with some offbeat humor mixed in.  It's a good thing there are some laughs here too, or I might have wound up trying to hang myself with my belt after I first saw the movie.  Most of the humor to be found come from Dermot Mulroney's clueless Randall and, of course, Kathy Bates as Randall's mildly deranged motormouth of a mother.  Bates practically steals the show during her limited screen time, as her character's sincerity, her brutal honesty, and above all her tendency to reveal excessive details provides a much-needed counterpoint to Nicholson's reserve and bitterness.While I'll be the first to admit that ""About Schmidt"" isn't an easy movie to watch, it's not supposed to be.  What makes this such a rewarding movie is the challenge of watching such a thoroughly unremarkable man for two hours, following along with his path through despair, self-discovery, and ultimately a measure of redemption.  Sure, Warren Schmidt's just a retired geezer from Nebraska, but his sufferings are more universal than they may appear at first.  Warren's experiences make for such fascinating viewing precisely because there are so many people like him out there.",5,One of the best movies of all time,1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,3237,"['Schmidt', 'simply', 'put', 'milestone', 'American', 'cinema', 'Coming', 'off', 'Election', 'was', 'quite', 'possibly', 'funniest', 'movie', 'time', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'delivered', 'classic', 'here', 'one', 'different', 'stripe', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'delivering', 'performance', 'somehow', 'low-key', 'passionate', 'character', 'study', 'relentlessly', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'existence', 'plumbing', 'depths', 'despair', 'hopelessness', 'However', 'central', 'character', ""n't"", 'serial', 'killer', 'sex', 'offender', 'similar', 'paragon', 'depravity', 'Instead', 'quiet', '66-year-old', 'newly', 'retired', 'actuary', 'Nebraska', 'named', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'so', 'depressing', 'someday', 'maybe', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'off', 'could', 'wind', 'up', 'movie', 'antihero', 'retired', 'widowed', 'feeling', 'useless.Alexander', 'Payne', 'portrait', 'Midwestern', 'suburban', 'life', 'almost', 'unrelentingly', 'bleak', 'following', 'main', 'character', 'focusing', 'tiny', 'indignities', 'steadily', 'up', 'relentlessly', 'self-analytical', 'Warren', 'examined', 'life', 'search', 'higher', 'purpose', 'come', 'up', 'lacking', 'Looking', 'back', 'can', 'see', 'only', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'pointless', 'toil', 'looking', 'ahead', 'only', 'loneliness', 'impending', 'death', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'left', 'give', 'life', 'semblance', 'meaning', 'attempts', 'prevent', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'marrying', 'mulleted', 'fu-manchued', 'waterbed', 'salesman', 'named', 'Randall', 'Ndugu', 'Tanzanian', 'orphan', 'whom', 'supporting', 'financially', 'early', 'movie', 'Warren', 'letters', 'Ndugu', 'serve', 'perfect', 'framing', 'device', 'providing', 'window', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'roil', 'quiet', 'exterior.Since', 'monstrous', 'shadow', 'Election', 'movie', 'entire', 'two', 'hours', 'comparisons', 'are', 'inevitable', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'mine', 'now', 'movies', 'are', 'allegorical', 'tales', 'set', 'white-bread', 'Nebraska', 'locales', 'Election', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'anchored', 'serious', 'plot', 'Schmidt', 'dark', 'tale', 'quiet', 'desparation', 'self-reflection', 'offbeat', 'humor', 'mixed', 'good', 'thing', 'are', 'laughs', 'here', 'too', 'might', 'have', 'wound', 'up', 'trying', 'hang', 'belt', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'Most', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'come', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'clueless', 'Randall', 'course', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Randall', 'mildly', 'deranged', 'motormouth', 'mother', 'Bates', 'practically', 'show', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'character', 'sincerity', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'tendency', 'reveal', 'excessive', 'details', 'much-needed', 'counterpoint', 'Nicholson', 'reserve', 'bitterness.While', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'Schmidt', ""n't"", 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'What', 'such', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'challenge', 'watching', 'such', 'thoroughly', 'unremarkable', 'man', 'two', 'hours', 'following', 'along', 'path', 'despair', 'self-discovery', 'ultimately', 'measure', 'redemption', 'Sure', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'just', 'retired', 'geezer', 'Nebraska', 'sufferings', 'are', 'more', 'universal', 'may', 'appear', 'first', 'Warren', 'experiences', 'make', 'such', 'fascinating', 'viewing', 'precisely', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'there']",N/A
