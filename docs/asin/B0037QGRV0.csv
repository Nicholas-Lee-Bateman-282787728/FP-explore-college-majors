This is not slapstick, in-your-face humor that will make almost everyone laugh - and therein lies the beauty of it for me! It wasn't at all what I was expecting to see when I rented it.The relationship between Molly (Marisa Tomei) and Cyrus (Jonah Hill) - which consistently straddles the line between beautiful and disturbing - is rattled by the introduction of John (John C. Reilly) into their lives. The issues that arise are the crux of the humorous conflict that drives the story.It bounces back and forth between the feel of a quirky romantic comedy, a darkly humorous satire and a low-key drama. It all combines to make a subtly played-out, ludicrous and well-acted tale.

It's about his character looking desperately for a relationship after a dramatic break-up between him and his ex, so he stumbles across a woman while visiting a house party (while urinating on the ground outside, haha) and from there... weird things happen.The two hit it off, and he eventually meets the womans son, and it turns out the son has serious issues ""upstairs"" if you get my drift! Of course, John Reilly doesn't want to come right out and tell the boys mother that something is wrong with him because that's her precious baby boy and, as you can probably imagine, you absolutely can NOT stand between two family members! No way!!  Especially a mother and son!!He's 22 years old, and spends his days moping around the house and picking on John simply because he's the guy dating his mother. He likes to find ways to torment John Reilly's character either by stealing his things, or just messing with him mentally. He's almost never as clever as it appears, however.  I thought he was really darn smart at first but we eventually find out that's not exactly true.For the longest time, the plot development leads the viewers into thinking something is seriously wrong with the mother as well, because the way she communicates with her son is quite odd to say the least. They are both extremely close, and I was honestly waiting for a bomb shell announcement that her son was actually her boyfriend! No, that never happens, haha.There's a nice message at the end of the film though, but I won't spoil what it is because it relates to the plot.

John and Cyrus end up fighting with one another, but the film ends by suggesting some kind of reconciliation between the three of them.  What distinguishes Jay and Mark Duplass' film is its underlying sense of irony: just like Cyrus, John appears unable (or unwilling) to allow his nearest and dearest to live their own lives.  John is perpetually conversing with his ex-wife Jamie (Catherine Keener), while remaining blissfully oblivious to the fact that Jamie is about to marry Tim (Matt Walsh).  Like Cyrus, John cannot let go: the two protagonists are uncannily similar to one another.  It is only at the end of the film that both of them come to recognize their kinship.  The film is shot in quasi-documentary style, with the camera perpetually encircling the characters' faces, punctuated by occasional zooms.

1329784,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0037QGRV0,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 6]","The previews would have you believe this will be an over-the-top revenge farce, and certainly the presence of John C. Reilly (Step Brothers) and Jonah Hill (Superbad) would draw anyone to that conclusion. However, this 2010 film is far darker and melancholy than I expected. There are small-scale laughs, but the Duplass brothers, Mark and Jay, have something else in mind here. Sharing writing and directing responsibilities, they have created a movie where the three lead characters find themselves in an awkward triangle in which each struggles to come to terms with the situation at hand. With hand-held camerawork from Jas Shelton and the somewhat hesitant pacing set forth by the Duplasses, the resulting dramedy has a ramshackle tone with a surprising edge of suspense that undercuts the pervasive uncertainty in the story being told.The slight plot focuses on John, a depressed, middle-aged film editor living alone and still not over his divorce from seven years earlier. In fact, he still clings onto his patient ex-wife Jamie and is shattered to find out she is getting married again. She encourages him to go to a party where he immediately gets drunk on shots of Red Bull and vodka. After several failed attempts at conversation, he meets the woman of his dreams, Molly, who is as beautiful as he is socially inept. She finds herself drawn to John's honesty and tenderness, and things go swimmingly until he meets her grown son. His name is Cyrus, and he's actually close to 22, unemployed and still living at home. There is something unsettling about Cyrus whether it's the way he calls his mother by her first name or the pretentiously synthesized music he composes. When things turn serious between John and Molly, everyone starts to feel the co-dependencies unwind in their lives with unexpected ramifications.The Duplasses selected well in their casting. Reilly brings out the eager awkwardness in John without compromising the fact that he leans far too much on Jamie than either would readily admit. As always, Catherine Keener uses her sharp intelligence and no-nonsense manner effectively in the subsidiary role of Jamie. As Molly, Marisa Tomei balances a fine line between loving and permissive in playing a mother who only sees her son's seemingly vulnerable state, and as she did inThe Wrestler, she is not afraid to tread uncertain waters as a character actress. The big surprise is Hill in the title role. Heretofore known for likeable wiseacre parts mainly in the Judd Apatow comedy factory, he brings an unsettling stillness to what could have been purely a comically malevolent role. The plot threads tie up a bit too neatly at the end, but the provocative nature of the film keeps you guessing what exactly have the characters learned from their plight.",4,Engaging Triangle Dramedy Unexpectedly Delves into Some Unhealthy Co-Dependencies,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,2784,"['previews', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'revenge', 'farce', 'certainly', 'presence', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Superbad', 'would', 'draw', 'anyone', 'conclusion', 'However', '2010', 'film', 'far', 'darker', 'melancholy', 'expected', 'are', 'small-scale', 'laughs', 'Duplass', 'brothers', 'Mark', 'Jay', 'have', 'something', 'else', 'mind', 'here', 'Sharing', 'writing', 'directing', 'responsibilities', 'have', 'created', 'movie', 'where', 'three', 'lead', 'characters', 'find', 'awkward', 'triangle', 'struggles', 'come', 'terms', 'situation', 'hand', 'hand-held', 'camerawork', 'Jas', 'Shelton', 'somewhat', 'hesitant', 'pacing', 'set', 'forth', 'Duplasses', 'resulting', 'dramedy', 'ramshackle', 'tone', 'surprising', 'edge', 'suspense', 'pervasive', 'uncertainty', 'story', 'being', 'told.The', 'slight', 'plot', 'John', 'depressed', 'middle-aged', 'film', 'editor', 'living', 'alone', 'still', 'not', 'divorce', 'seven', 'years', 'earlier', 'fact', 'still', 'patient', 'ex-wife', 'Jamie', 'shattered', 'find', 'out', 'getting', 'married', 'again', 'go', 'party', 'where', 'immediately', 'drunk', 'shots', 'Red', 'Bull', 'vodka', 'several', 'failed', 'attempts', 'conversation', 'woman', 'dreams', 'Molly', 'who', 'as', 'beautiful', 'socially', 'inept', 'drawn', 'John', 'honesty', 'tenderness', 'things', 'go', 'swimmingly', 'grown', 'son', 'name', 'Cyrus', 'actually', 'close', '22', 'unemployed', 'still', 'living', 'home', 'something', 'unsettling', 'Cyrus', 'way', 'mother', 'first', 'name', 'pretentiously', 'synthesized', 'music', 'When', 'things', 'turn', 'serious', 'John', 'Molly', 'everyone', 'feel', 'co-dependencies', 'lives', 'unexpected', 'ramifications.The', 'Duplasses', 'selected', 'well', 'casting', 'Reilly', 'out', 'eager', 'awkwardness', 'John', 'compromising', 'fact', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Jamie', 'either', 'would', 'readily', 'admit', 'always', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'sharp', 'intelligence', 'no-nonsense', 'manner', 'effectively', 'subsidiary', 'role', 'Jamie', 'Molly', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'fine', 'line', 'loving', 'permissive', 'playing', 'mother', 'who', 'only', 'son', 'seemingly', 'vulnerable', 'state', 'did', 'inThe', 'Wrestler', 'not', 'afraid', 'tread', 'uncertain', 'waters', 'character', 'actress', 'big', 'surprise', 'Hill', 'title', 'role', 'Heretofore', 'known', 'likeable', 'wiseacre', 'parts', 'mainly', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'comedy', 'factory', 'unsettling', 'stillness', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'purely', 'comically', 'malevolent', 'role', 'plot', 'threads', 'tie', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'neatly', 'end', 'provocative', 'nature', 'film', 'guessing', 'what', 'exactly', 'have', 'characters', 'learned', 'plight']",Cyrus

This is the kind of movie for which video was meant. Anyone and everyone can have access at any time. You don't need to live near a highly populated area or an art house theater that could support this type of release.I was looking forward to seeing this but I wasn't prepared for just how good it would be. This is independent film making at its best. It's all writing and acting. There are only a few sets and characters here. The music is played by only a few instruments but it's great. It's shot and cut well so there are no distractions pulling the viewer away from what is happening on the screen.John C. Reilly has been divorced from Catherine Keener for seven years and has really never gotten over it. He meets Marisa Tomei at a party and things instantly begin to look up. As their relationship gets deeper a dark cloud appears in the form of her 22 year old son (played with major creepiness by Jonah Hill). He still lives with mom and they have a very peculiar relationship. Though it's a co-dependent sort of thing it becomes clear during the proceedings who the manipulator is. Will the love birds find true happiness in the end.The writing here is as good as I've ever seen. Certain scenes work on so many levels they require more than one viewing to digest them. I like Reilly but, for my money, this is far and away the best he's ever done. Likewise, I like Tomei, and again she shows herself to be one of the best actresses around. Jonah Hill has done well in his other outings but, again, here he's over and above.

1329786,A9TG2NFA614S9,B0037QGRV0,John F. Rooney,"[3, 6]","""Cyrus"" has some richly comic, hilarious moments and some touching (cloying?) ones as well. It has first-rate acting by the three principals. John (John C. Reilly looking as much like the ogre Shrek as ever) is a very lonely, vulnerable guy who thinks he's finally met the right woman for him after seven years in the single desert following his divorce. The woman, Molly, (Marisa Tomei) has an overweight twenty-one-year-old non-working son, Cyrus (Jonah Hill) whose very deep and complicated affection for his mom seems to be so strong it shuts out any hope for John to get in-between them.Cyrus calls his mother Molly and seems to be more of a rival than a son. Mother and son have a very tight relationship but not, I think, quite what you might have heard. Cyrus is a wily schemer who will do anything to drive a wedge between Molly and John. Does the bit with John's Nikes verge on the psychotic?At times the camera work is not that of the perfectly photographed motion picture. They use hand-held cameras, and the picture is sometimes out of focus and out of frame. It's directed and written by the brother Duplass known for their quirky movies made on the cheap.The movie is about relationships, how people cope with life. It is a universal situation even though this one has some weird elements. Two forms of love are vying for preeminence.Cyrus is not dumb, but rather is shrewd and manipulative. The movie says you have to go for it, give life and circumstances a try.Years ago there were small movies like ""Marty"" about losers who try to find love. This movie is similar in some ways but not quite as daring as the hype may have suggested, but it is very good. Some viewers may feel that there's a cop-out at the end. There is a scene in the movie, a bedroom scene where Molly is getting a call from John that you'll want to catch, but it goes by very fast.I loved the movie and went with the story willingly because it was engrossing, superbly acted, had a lot of laughs, and a tear or two.",5,Don't Believe the Hype,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,2003,"['Cyrus', 'richly', 'comic', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'touching', 'cloying', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'first-rate', 'acting', 'three', 'principals', 'John', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'looking', 'as', 'much', 'ogre', 'Shrek', 'ever', 'very', 'lonely', 'vulnerable', 'guy', 'who', 'finally', 'met', 'right', 'woman', 'seven', 'years', 'single', 'desert', 'following', 'divorce', 'woman', 'Molly', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'overweight', 'twenty-one-year-old', 'non-working', 'son', 'Cyrus', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'very', 'deep', 'complicated', 'affection', 'mom', 'be', 'so', 'strong', 'out', 'hope', 'John', 'get', 'in-between', 'them.Cyrus', 'mother', 'Molly', 'be', 'more', 'rival', 'son', 'Mother', 'son', 'have', 'very', 'tight', 'relationship', 'not', 'think', 'quite', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'heard', 'Cyrus', 'wily', 'schemer', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'drive', 'wedge', 'Molly', 'John', 'bit', 'John', 'Nikes', 'verge', 'psychotic', 'times', 'camera', 'work', 'not', 'perfectly', 'photographed', 'motion', 'picture', 'use', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'picture', 'sometimes', 'focus', 'frame', 'directed', 'written', 'brother', 'Duplass', 'known', 'quirky', 'movies', 'made', 'cheap.The', 'movie', 'relationships', 'how', 'people', 'cope', 'life', 'universal', 'situation', 'even', 'one', 'weird', 'elements', 'Two', 'forms', 'love', 'are', 'vying', 'preeminence.Cyrus', 'not', 'dumb', 'rather', 'shrewd', 'manipulative', 'movie', 'have', 'go', 'give', 'life', 'circumstances', 'try.Years', 'were', 'small', 'movies', 'Marty', 'losers', 'who', 'try', 'find', 'love', 'movie', 'similar', 'ways', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'daring', 'hype', 'may', 'have', 'suggested', 'very', 'good', 'viewers', 'may', 'feel', 'cop-out', 'end', 'scene', 'movie', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'where', 'Molly', 'getting', 'call', 'John', ""'ll"", 'want', 'catch', 'very', 'fast.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'went', 'story', 'willingly', 'was', 'engrossing', 'superbly', 'acted', 'had', 'lot', 'laughs', 'tear', 'two']",Cyrus
1329787,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0037QGRV0,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[9, 10]","A film starring John C. Reilly and Jonah Hill is going to attract a certain audience...And that is not the correct audience for this film. While Reilly is an accomplished dramatic actor, he's become well-known for appearing in successful comedies lately; Hill is best-known for his work in the Apatow-cannon. Cyrus is the type of film the average moviegoer dismisses as ""too weird"" or ""not funny,"" which both miss the point entirely. To use a term I'm not fond of, Cyrus is a ""dramedy,"" that seamlessly blends both comedy and drama avoiding cheap punchlines and dramatic, emotional cues. If you think Step Brothers is the ""best movie ever"" and you're expecting typical Jonah Hill-fare, this is not your movie. If you watch it with an open mind, you'll find it quite rewarding.John C. Reilly plays John, still wallowing in loneliness seven years after his divorce. Now, his ex-wife Jamie (Catherine Keener) is getting re-married and she takes John to a party in the hope that he'll find himself a girlfriend. He does, in the form of a beautiful woman named Molly (Marisa Tomei). When John becomes curious about Molly's secretive nature he follows her home and meets her 21-year-old son Cyrus (Hill). Cyrus comes off a bit weird, but friendly but John notices the relationship between Molly and Cyrus is rather unconventional; they share a close bond that borders on the near incestuous. John becomes suspicious of Cyrus' motives very quickly, but finds himself in a rut not wanting to damage his new relationship with Molly.The film moves at a very quick pace and boasts a solid script although writer/directors Jay & Mark Duplass do allow their actors a lot of room for improvisation. Their characters are rather unconventional, but realistic and the film plays off their reactions to the awkwardness around them perfectly. There's a refreshing dynamic between the characters too, especially between John and his ex-wife Jamie. This is not a bickering, spiteful former couple but a mature, supporting one. They have a camaraderie with each other that we don't see often and it doesn't seem like a stretch. The always reliable Catherine Keener is perfectly charming and believable as a woman who wants her ex-husband to find happiness and is willing to set aside important things in her life to lend an ear.Much of the film is an exercise in understatement. Reilly has proved his acting chops, but it's nice to see him take a break to do something a bit more down-to-earth. He nails the role of the confused, but well-meaning John who has finally found something special and is determined to make it work. Tomei is always good at playing sweet, but she has to add a level of maturity, dedication, and obliviousness with slightly Oedipal overtones into a convincing, subtle performance. In doing this, she makes a complicated role effortless. Hill hasn't gotten too much notice for his performance, but it's a substantial turn from his typical stuff. The role of Cyrus requires Hill to seem well-mannered, manipulative, and child-like while still getting an audience to empathize with him. This is a psychologically complex role that Hill really steps up to the plate for. His performance as Cyrus isreally something special and a small step into proving himself as an actor that can handle both comedy and drama. While he doesn't completely abandon that Jonah Hill persona, there are more layers to this performance than many will admit or give him credit for.The roles are well-written, but it's the understated performances that really bring these characters off the page. Had any actor made a slight misstep, it could've derailed the film's credibility. This is especially true in a film that relies on character interaction, where the slightest wrong nuance could've killed a whole scene's credibility. This is a film that relies on it's actors ability and there's some great comedic banter between John and Cyrus, each trying to gain the upper hand for Molly's affection juxtaposed with some very realistic, dramatic exchanges. The dialogue isn't flashy movie dialogue; it's very subtle, straight-forward and has much more of an impact in the loose, improvisational delivery.The film's cinematography (even for those who don't know what cinematography is) may take some getting used too. It makes frequent use of the zoom lens and feels amateurish, but it eventfully becomes apparent that it's perfectly suited for the tone of the movie. As I said, this is not a film for the people the marketing tried to gear it towards. Many will be disappointed, but you've been warned.Cyrus is a wonderful surprise. An understated, underrated, low-key blend of comedy and drama that provides chuckles and a fair amount of poignancy. It's a smart film that gives some terrific actors the chance to really make use of their skills and it's one of my favorite films of 2010. If you're in the mood for something a little different, you'll find Cyrus to be quite a treat.GRADE: A-",5,A Deft Blend of Comedy and Drama,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,4967,"['film', 'starring', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'going', 'attract', 'certain', 'audience', 'not', 'correct', 'audience', 'film', 'Reilly', 'accomplished', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'become', 'well-known', 'appearing', 'successful', 'comedies', 'lately', 'Hill', 'best-known', 'work', 'Apatow-cannon', 'Cyrus', 'type', 'film', 'average', 'moviegoer', 'too', 'weird', 'not', 'funny', 'miss', 'point', 'entirely', 'use', 'term', ""'m"", 'not', 'fond', 'Cyrus', 'dramedy', 'seamlessly', 'comedy', 'drama', 'avoiding', 'cheap', 'punchlines', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'cues', 'think', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'typical', 'Jonah', 'Hill-fare', 'not', 'movie', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'find', 'quite', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'John', 'still', 'wallowing', 'loneliness', 'seven', 'years', 'divorce', 'Now', 'ex-wife', 'Jamie', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'getting', 're-married', 'John', 'party', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'find', 'girlfriend', 'form', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Molly', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'When', 'John', 'curious', 'Molly', 'secretive', 'nature', 'home', '21-year-old', 'son', 'Cyrus', 'Hill', 'Cyrus', 'off', 'bit', 'weird', 'friendly', 'John', 'relationship', 'Molly', 'Cyrus', 'rather', 'unconventional', 'share', 'close', 'bond', 'near', 'incestuous', 'John', 'suspicious', 'Cyrus', 'motives', 'very', 'quickly', 'rut', 'not', 'wanting', 'damage', 'new', 'relationship', 'Molly.The', 'film', 'moves', 'very', 'quick', 'pace', 'solid', 'script', 'writer/directors', 'Jay', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'do', 'allow', 'actors', 'lot', 'room', 'improvisation', 'characters', 'are', 'rather', 'unconventional', 'realistic', 'film', 'off', 'reactions', 'awkwardness', 'perfectly', 'refreshing', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'too', 'especially', 'John', 'ex-wife', 'Jamie', 'not', 'bickering', 'spiteful', 'former', 'couple', 'mature', 'supporting', 'one', 'have', 'camaraderie', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'often', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stretch', 'always', 'reliable', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'perfectly', 'charming', 'believable', 'woman', 'who', 'ex-husband', 'find', 'happiness', 'willing', 'set', 'aside', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'lend', 'ear.Much', 'film', 'exercise', 'understatement', 'Reilly', 'proved', 'acting', 'chops', 'nice', 'see', 'take', 'break', 'do', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'down-to-earth', 'role', 'confused', 'well-meaning', 'John', 'who', 'finally', 'found', 'something', 'special', 'determined', 'make', 'work', 'Tomei', 'always', 'good', 'playing', 'sweet', 'add', 'level', 'maturity', 'dedication', 'obliviousness', 'slightly', 'Oedipal', 'overtones', 'convincing', 'subtle', 'performance', 'doing', 'complicated', 'role', 'effortless', 'Hill', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'too', 'much', 'notice', 'performance', 'substantial', 'turn', 'typical', 'stuff', 'role', 'Cyrus', 'Hill', 'seem', 'well-mannered', 'manipulative', 'child-like', 'still', 'getting', 'audience', 'empathize', 'psychologically', 'complex', 'role', 'Hill', 'really', 'up', 'plate', 'performance', 'Cyrus', 'isreally', 'something', 'special', 'small', 'step', 'proving', 'actor', 'can', 'handle', 'comedy', 'drama', ""n't"", 'completely', 'abandon', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'persona', 'are', 'more', 'layers', 'performance', 'many', 'will', 'admit', 'give', 'credit', 'for.The', 'roles', 'are', 'well-written', 'understated', 'performances', 'really', 'bring', 'characters', 'off', 'page', 'Had', 'actor', 'made', 'slight', 'misstep', 'could', ""'ve"", 'derailed', 'film', 'credibility', 'especially', 'true', 'film', 'character', 'interaction', 'where', 'slightest', 'wrong', 'nuance', 'could', ""'ve"", 'killed', 'whole', 'scene', 'credibility', 'film', 'actors', 'ability', 'great', 'comedic', 'banter', 'John', 'Cyrus', 'trying', 'gain', 'upper', 'hand', 'Molly', 'affection', 'juxtaposed', 'very', 'realistic', 'dramatic', 'exchanges', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'flashy', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'very', 'subtle', 'straight-forward', 'much', 'more', 'impact', 'loose', 'improvisational', 'delivery.The', 'film', 'cinematography', 'even', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'cinematography', 'may', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'too', 'frequent', 'use', 'zoom', 'feels', 'amateurish', 'eventfully', 'apparent', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'tone', 'movie', 'said', 'not', 'film', 'people', 'marketing', 'tried', 'gear', 'Many', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned.Cyrus', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'understated', 'underrated', 'low-key', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'chuckles', 'fair', 'amount', 'poignancy', 'smart', 'film', 'terrific', 'actors', 'chance', 'really', 'make', 'use', 'skills', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2010', ""'re"", 'mood', 'something', 'little', 'different', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Cyrus', 'be', 'quite', 'treat.GRADE', 'A-']",Cyrus

1329792,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0037QGRV0,Mark Turner,"[1, 3]","I've read recently that Hollywood has more or less abandoned making original films, instead opting for more safe bets like remakes, sequels or films based on marketable ideas such as comic books. Last year the only original film to make a splash was INCEPTION and the suits in Hollywood began by saying it wouldn't do go, then it wouldn't last and finally it was just a fluke. That's sad because there are some great stories out there that can be told. CYRUS is one of those.John C. Reilly stars as John, a depressed ex-husband who's still dealing with the loss of his wife 7 years after they parted ways. The ex, Jamie (Catherine Keener), shows up at his house one night to let him know she's going to be getting married and to invite him to a party where she hopes he can meet someone new.John finally gives in and goes, attempting to charm the women he meets and failing miserably. Until he meets Molly (Marisa Tomei). Molly sees John as something different than most guys, an honest man willing to express his feelings openly. The two end up sharing John's bed that night and the next with Molly mysteriously leaving before the end of the night. When John follows her the third night, he discovers why.It seems that Molly failed to mention that she has a son. Cyrus (Jonah Hill) is a 21 year old young man who still lives with his mother. While Molly is out, Cyrus invites John in and they begin to talk to one another. Molly arrives to find the two men in her life getting along and John stays for dinner and over night.All seems to be going well. With the exception that the next morning John's shoes are missing. Added to that are subtle signs that he begins to read coming from Cyrus. As the film progresses we realize that Cyrus appears fine with the idea of his mother becoming involved with John, but inside he wants things as they've always been, just the two of them alone.John's willing to fight for Molly, the woman of his dreams, but eventually he sees that there is little way for him to compete against Cyrus. What mother would take the word of a man she's just recently met over the word of her only child? Just how John can get back with Molly, discovering if there is a way to get around Cyrus and attempting to make true love work is the focus of the film.Reilly is a hit or miss actor. In some roles he is amazing and in others he just seems to be playing the same guy over and over again. Here he does a great job as an average guy who wants love so bad and is afraid of being hurt by losing it again.

Improbably, she digs him.  The only trouble is her grown up son, who lives at home and just can't quite let go of mommy, and she doesn't seem to see a problem with their level of intimacy and attachment.  It's not quite creepy, but it's not normal and not healthy, and it's not going to work out for John unless something gives.The Duplass brothers follow up their ultra-low-budget quirky independent filmsThe Puffy ChairandBagheadwith an off-beat romantic comedy.  While more conventional than their earlier efforts, and with a bigger budget and stars, the film still feels as fresh and intimate and real as anything they've done, and is funny without ever quite becoming the farce it initially seems it could become.  It is over-the-top - it falls squarely within the romantic comedy genre, after all - but it feels much more authentic than, say, something likeThe HangoverorSuperbadorKnocked Up.  In spite of a bigger budget, they are still working on a similar scale, and in a similar style as their previous two films, and remain focused on a situation defined by character rather than plot.  The performances, especially those delivered by the three main leads (John C. Reilly as John, Marisa Tomei as Molly, and Jonah Hill as her overly dependent son, Cyrus), are honest and raw and utterly convincing.  Jonah Hill is perfect in the title role that seems written for him, a role that tweaks his signature combination of vulnerability and rudeness, and makes it feel fresh and genuine.  The style and look, with intimate handheld camera work, fits the story that is being told.  In spite of its simplicity, and its spontaneous feel, the writing is actually quite clever - for example, in the way that the relationship between John and his best friend and ex parallels that between his new lover and her son, and the fact that his superficial similarity to her son Cyrus goes some way towards explaining why Molly is immediately drawn to John.  It feels too small to be a masterpiece or classic, but it's written well, it feels fresh and often funny. I liked it quite a bit, and will definitely look forward to what the Duplass brothers do next.",4,"Bittersweet story about a lonely man & a lonely woman & her highly dependent son - awkwardly funny, but remains real & not farce",1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,2258,"['John', 'middle-aged', 'down-on-his-luck', 'divorcee', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'way', 'league', 'Improbably', 'digs', 'only', 'trouble', 'grown', 'son', 'who', 'home', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'let', 'go', 'mommy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'see', 'problem', 'level', 'intimacy', 'attachment', 'not', 'quite', 'creepy', 'not', 'normal', 'not', 'healthy', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'John', 'something', 'gives.The', 'Duplass', 'brothers', 'follow', 'up', 'ultra-low-budget', 'quirky', 'independent', 'filmsThe', 'Puffy', 'ChairandBagheadwith', 'off-beat', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'more', 'conventional', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'bigger', 'budget', 'stars', 'film', 'still', 'fresh', 'intimate', 'real', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'done', 'funny', 'ever', 'quite', 'becoming', 'farce', 'initially', 'could', 'become', 'over-the-top', 'squarely', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'much', 'more', 'authentic', 'say', 'something', 'likeThe', 'HangoverorSuperbadorKnocked', 'Up', 'spite', 'bigger', 'budget', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'similar', 'scale', 'similar', 'style', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'remain', 'focused', 'situation', 'defined', 'character', 'rather', 'plot', 'performances', 'especially', 'delivered', 'three', 'main', 'leads', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'John', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Molly', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'overly', 'dependent', 'son', 'Cyrus', 'are', 'honest', 'raw', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'perfect', 'title', 'role', 'written', 'role', 'signature', 'combination', 'vulnerability', 'rudeness', 'feel', 'fresh', 'genuine', 'style', 'look', 'intimate', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'spite', 'simplicity', 'spontaneous', 'feel', 'writing', 'actually', 'quite', 'clever', 'example', 'way', 'relationship', 'John', 'best', 'friend', 'ex', 'parallels', 'new', 'lover', 'son', 'fact', 'superficial', 'similarity', 'son', 'Cyrus', 'way', 'explaining', 'why', 'Molly', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'John', 'too', 'small', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'classic', 'written', 'well', 'fresh', 'often', 'funny', 'liked', 'quite', 'bit', 'will', 'definitely', 'look', 'forward', 'what', 'Duplass', 'brothers', 'do', 'next']",Cyrus
1329799,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B0037QGRV0,Paul McGrath,"[2, 4]","Of all the prominent movie actors on the planet, it would be difficult to find one less appealing than John C. Reilly, with his bulbous nose, scrunched-in face, and unruly hair.  And he always seems to play a whining, put-upon, loser type, about as far from the leading-man ideal as can be.  Of course, this makes him perfect for the role he has in Cyrus.In it, he plays a pathetic sort of fellow who, although divorced for seven years, still hasn't made any effort to start a new relationship and who continues to cling to his ex-wife.  She's about to get remarried and in an effort to get him back on his feet, invites him to a cocktail party she has been invited to.  Surprisingly enough, given his clumsy, oafish efforts to mingle, he does meet someone who seems to like him:  the Marisa Tomei character, a mostly attractive but somewhat mousy and needy type.The complication is her twenty year old son, the Jonah Hill character, who lives with her and with whom she has a very, very close relationship.  No, it's not sexual, thankfully, but it is at least on the verge of being abnormal.  The creepy young adult has no desire to leave and she has no desire to push him out and they are casually intimate with one another in ways that don't normally befit a mother and son relationship.Into the picture slinks the discomfiting Reilly character, and the story is how the three of them begin to come to terms with their new relationship.  It is well-done and engrossing, and thankfully resists the temptation--although it verges on it--to become a typical, moronic Hollywood comedy, in which the two protagonists resort to playing increasingly outrageous pranks on one another.The characters are fascinating and the roles are well-played.  Reilly, of course, is cast perfectly, with his yearning oafishness.  Marisa Tomei is in real life a very attractive woman and one might wonder how her character would be unattached for so long.  But she pulls it off here;  playing her convincingly as a vulnerable, tentative, and somewhat fearful person.  Jonah Hill is also excellent.  Seemingly ineffectual at first glance, he is in fact scheming, manipulative, and bright.  His first scene with Reilly, in which he plays for him his electronic musical composition, is a fascinating little bit of drama, with both surreptitiously taking the measure of each other.If there is a flaw here, it is that the two male protagonists eventually become openly antagonistic with one another.  One can't help wonder how it is that they are both so needy and grasping in general, yet at the same time confident enough to engage in overt warfare.  It is said that some of the dialogue in this film was improvised.  It may be that the actors could not come up with anything more subtle.  Perhaps some additional direction was needed here.In any event, the irony of this is that as the Reilly character attempts to be the adult in his new relationship with Marisa Tomei and her moribund son, he is himself an unhealthy, adolescent  drag on the relationship between his ex-wife and her fiancee, calling her at all hours, making her go shopping with him, and allowing her unfettered access to his apartment.  And the ex-wife, as with the Tomei character, are classic enablers, allowing these grown boys to use them as they do.  Not sure what the point of all of this is, but it is a fascinating study.The ending is also interesting.  Although it lightly implies that the three had reached some resolution, one can't help but wonder whether the subterfuge will continue.  It may be that it's never going to end.",4,Retreating from Adulthood,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,3586,"['prominent', 'movie', 'actors', 'planet', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'find', 'one', 'less', 'appealing', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'bulbous', 'nose', 'scrunched-in', 'face', 'unruly', 'hair', 'always', 'play', 'whining', 'put-upon', 'loser', 'type', 'about', 'far', 'leading-man', 'ideal', 'can', 'be', 'course', 'perfect', 'role', 'Cyrus.In', 'pathetic', 'sort', 'fellow', 'who', 'divorced', 'seven', 'years', 'still', ""n't"", 'made', 'effort', 'start', 'new', 'relationship', 'who', 'cling', 'ex-wife', 'about', 'get', 'remarried', 'effort', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'cocktail', 'party', 'been', 'invited', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'given', 'clumsy', 'oafish', 'efforts', 'mingle', 'meet', 'someone', 'who', 'like', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'character', 'mostly', 'attractive', 'somewhat', 'mousy', 'needy', 'type.The', 'complication', 'twenty', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'character', 'who', 'whom', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'relationship', 'No', 'not', 'sexual', 'thankfully', 'least', 'verge', 'being', 'abnormal', 'creepy', 'young', 'adult', 'desire', 'leave', 'desire', 'push', 'out', 'are', 'casually', 'intimate', 'one', 'ways', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'befit', 'mother', 'son', 'relationship.Into', 'picture', 'discomfiting', 'Reilly', 'character', 'story', 'how', 'three', 'begin', 'come', 'terms', 'new', 'relationship', 'well-done', 'engrossing', 'thankfully', 'temptation', 'become', 'typical', 'moronic', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'two', 'protagonists', 'resort', 'playing', 'increasingly', 'outrageous', 'pranks', 'one', 'another.The', 'characters', 'are', 'fascinating', 'roles', 'are', 'well-played', 'Reilly', 'course', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'yearning', 'oafishness', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'real', 'life', 'very', 'attractive', 'woman', 'one', 'might', 'wonder', 'how', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'unattached', 'so', 'long', 'off', 'here', 'playing', 'convincingly', 'vulnerable', 'tentative', 'somewhat', 'fearful', 'person', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'also', 'excellent', 'Seemingly', 'ineffectual', 'first', 'glance', 'fact', 'scheming', 'manipulative', 'bright', 'first', 'scene', 'Reilly', 'electronic', 'musical', 'composition', 'fascinating', 'little', 'bit', 'drama', 'surreptitiously', 'taking', 'measure', 'other.If', 'flaw', 'here', 'two', 'male', 'protagonists', 'eventually', 'become', 'openly', 'antagonistic', 'one', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'are', 'so', 'needy', 'grasping', 'general', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'confident', 'enough', 'engage', 'overt', 'warfare', 'said', 'dialogue', 'film', 'was', 'improvised', 'may', 'be', 'actors', 'could', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'more', 'subtle', 'Perhaps', 'additional', 'direction', 'was', 'needed', 'here.In', 'event', 'irony', 'Reilly', 'character', 'attempts', 'be', 'adult', 'new', 'relationship', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'moribund', 'son', 'unhealthy', 'adolescent', 'drag', 'relationship', 'ex-wife', 'fiancee', 'calling', 'hours', 'making', 'go', 'shopping', 'allowing', 'unfettered', 'access', 'apartment', 'ex-wife', 'Tomei', 'character', 'are', 'classic', 'enablers', 'allowing', 'grown', 'boys', 'use', 'do', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'point', 'fascinating', 'study.The', 'ending', 'also', 'interesting', 'lightly', 'three', 'had', 'reached', 'resolution', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'subterfuge', 'will', 'continue', 'may', 'be', 'never', 'going', 'end']",Cyrus

The trailers for the film imply a small, but funny & antic comedy with Jonah Hill (SUPERBAD), John C. Reilly (STEP BROTHERS) and Marisa Tomei (MY COUSIN VINNY).  Why did I pick those movies to put next to each performer?  Because those are the kinds of performances that the trailers imply you will see.Instead, we get a small, wry and occasionally uncomfortable drama with moments of dry, self-effacing humor.  That's not a bad thing...but I wasn't prepared to laugh so LITTLE.  In fact, my wife and I laughed about 6 times, and that was 6 times more than the rest of the audience we saw it with.What I really should say is that the film stars Marisa Tomei (IN THE BEDROOM), John C. Reilly (MAGNOLIA), Catherine Keener (LOVELY & AMAZING) and Jonah Hill in an uncharacteristically serious performance.  Reilly is a loser, something he plays very well.  A nice but shy guy who still isn't over his dissolved marriage to Keener.  She invites him to a party, and despite some silly behavior, Tomei takes an interest in him, and the two start a relationship that is both tentative and passionate.  Reilly is the kind of guy who really needs a woman in his life to spark him to action.  And Tomei has the certain fragility that only Tomei can portray.  All would be low-key but fine, if it weren't for the fact that Tomei also has a grown son (Hill) who still lives at home.  Hill's level of ambition makes Reilly look like a power-broker...in fact, all Hill is good at is nurturing his uncomfortably close relationship with his mother.  He embarks on an effort to drive Reilly away from his mom.  Reilly understands what is happening, but is at least savvy enough to know that if he wants to fight back, he needs to do it in a way that will keep Tomei unaware.The cat-and-mouse game between Hill & Reilly is the primary plot of the film.  Hill is initially the aggressor (or passive-aggressor might be more accurate), but Reilly fights back admirably.  This battle may SOUND funny, but it is only very modestly amusing.  We may smile or chuckle at some of the games these two play...but really, it's deadly serious stuff for these two.  It's the opposite of the over-the-top battles for dominance that Reilly engaged in with Will Farrell in STEP BROTHERS.  We actually can believe that these are real people having these battles.Reilly is the heart of the film.  It's mostly told from his point of view, and he is a master of this kind of intelligent, shy, self-aware schlub.  He knows he's very, very lucky to be involved with a woman as gorgeous as Tomei.  But he's also very believable showing affection and interest.  He starts out as a loser that's very hard to like, but we see the more assertive and loveable version of him emerging as the film goes on.  It's one of his more nuanced performances in quite awhile.Hill is creepy, pure and simple.  His performance is mostly physical.  He stands a little too close to people.  He stares at them a little too long and intently.  He wanders into rooms when it's clearly inappropriate to do so.  He mostly speaks in a monotone that SEEMS friendly, but is laced with anger or dread or even malice.  He seems DANGERSOUS, not funny.  At any moment, you can imagine him snapping and literally trying to harm others or himself.  This is not the stuff of wacky comedy.Tomei is always a delight, and it's easy to see why these men are drawn to her.  I wouldn't say she brings anything new to the role...but she still brings her A-game.  Keener's role is relatively small, but she's always welcome in anything.  Her character is a little softer than some of the brittle, heartless women she's been asked to play recently.In the end, your enjoyment of CYRUS will mostly equal your enjoyment of the 3 starring performances.  Plot specifics won't stick with you for long.  There are few lines that stick to the memory.  For me, even though I really like Reilly, Tomei & Keener...there just wasn't quite enough substance to make me whole-heartedly embrace the film.  I appreciated that it was very dark and didn't mind painting unflattering pictures of these people.  That's a great thing.  But just embracing a non-traditional road does not always make for a journey worth taking.  I can only give the film my most marginal of recommendations.",3,Some nice performances don't overcome a too-slight story,1281657600,"08 13, 2010",2010,4392,"['ever', 'was', 'movie', 'viewer', 'adjust', 'expectations', 'going', 'CYRUS', 'trailers', 'film', 'imply', 'small', 'funny', 'antic', 'comedy', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'SUPERBAD', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'STEP', 'BROTHERS', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'MY', 'COUSIN', 'VINNY', 'Why', 'did', 'pick', 'movies', 'put', 'next', 'performer', 'are', 'kinds', 'performances', 'trailers', 'imply', 'will', 'see.Instead', 'get', 'small', 'wry', 'occasionally', 'uncomfortable', 'drama', 'moments', 'dry', 'self-effacing', 'humor', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'laugh', 'so', 'LITTLE', 'fact', 'wife', 'laughed', 'about', '6', 'times', 'was', '6', 'times', 'more', 'rest', 'audience', 'saw', 'with.What', 'really', 'should', 'say', 'film', 'stars', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'IN', 'THE', 'BEDROOM', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'MAGNOLIA', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'LOVELY', 'AMAZING', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'uncharacteristically', 'serious', 'performance', 'Reilly', 'loser', 'something', 'very', 'well', 'nice', 'shy', 'guy', 'who', 'still', ""n't"", 'dissolved', 'marriage', 'Keener', 'party', 'silly', 'behavior', 'Tomei', 'interest', 'two', 'start', 'relationship', 'tentative', 'passionate', 'Reilly', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'really', 'woman', 'life', 'spark', 'action', 'Tomei', 'certain', 'fragility', 'only', 'Tomei', 'can', 'portray', 'would', 'be', 'low-key', 'fine', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Tomei', 'also', 'grown', 'son', 'Hill', 'who', 'still', 'home', 'Hill', 'level', 'ambition', 'Reilly', 'look', 'power-broker', 'fact', 'Hill', 'good', 'nurturing', 'uncomfortably', 'close', 'relationship', 'mother', 'effort', 'drive', 'Reilly', 'away', 'mom', 'Reilly', 'what', 'happening', 'least', 'savvy', 'enough', 'know', 'fight', 'back', 'do', 'way', 'will', 'keep', 'Tomei', 'unaware.The', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'Hill', 'Reilly', 'primary', 'plot', 'film', 'Hill', 'initially', 'aggressor', 'passive-aggressor', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'Reilly', 'fights', 'back', 'admirably', 'battle', 'may', 'SOUND', 'funny', 'only', 'very', 'modestly', 'amusing', 'may', 'smile', 'chuckle', 'games', 'two', 'play', 'really', 'deadly', 'serious', 'stuff', 'two', 'opposite', 'over-the-top', 'battles', 'dominance', 'Reilly', 'engaged', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'STEP', 'BROTHERS', 'actually', 'can', 'believe', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'having', 'battles.Reilly', 'heart', 'film', 'mostly', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'master', 'kind', 'intelligent', 'shy', 'self-aware', 'schlub', 'very', 'very', 'lucky', 'be', 'involved', 'woman', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'Tomei', 'also', 'very', 'believable', 'showing', 'affection', 'interest', 'out', 'loser', 'very', 'hard', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'assertive', 'loveable', 'version', 'emerging', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'quite', 'awhile.Hill', 'creepy', 'pure', 'simple', 'performance', 'mostly', 'physical', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'people', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'intently', 'rooms', 'when', 'clearly', 'inappropriate', 'do', 'so', 'mostly', 'monotone', 'SEEMS', 'friendly', 'laced', 'anger', 'dread', 'even', 'malice', 'DANGERSOUS', 'not', 'funny', 'moment', 'can', 'imagine', 'snapping', 'literally', 'trying', 'harm', 'others', 'not', 'stuff', 'wacky', 'comedy.Tomei', 'always', 'delight', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'men', 'are', 'drawn', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'new', 'role', 'still', 'A-game', 'Keener', 'role', 'relatively', 'small', 'always', 'welcome', 'anything', 'character', 'little', 'softer', 'brittle', 'heartless', 'women', 'been', 'asked', 'play', 'recently.In', 'end', 'enjoyment', 'CYRUS', 'will', 'mostly', 'equal', 'enjoyment', '3', 'starring', 'performances', 'Plot', 'specifics', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stick', 'long', 'are', 'few', 'lines', 'stick', 'memory', 'even', 'really', 'Reilly', 'Tomei', 'Keener', 'there', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enough', 'substance', 'make', 'whole-heartedly', 'embrace', 'film', 'appreciated', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'painting', 'unflattering', 'pictures', 'people', 'great', 'thing', 'just', 'embracing', 'non-traditional', 'road', 'not', 'always', 'make', 'journey', 'worth', 'taking', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'film', 'most', 'marginal', 'recommendations']",Cyrus

1329806,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0037QGRV0,Turfseer,"[6, 7]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***No, I don't usually like movies that feature quite a bit of improvisation and jerky cinematography. Nonetheless, 'Cyrus' has enough crazy moments in it, that it's actually kind of funny. This is not your usual laugh out loud comedy. Rather, it's a farce where we're asked to laugh at (not with) a set of sharply defined, passive-aggressive character types.A central characteristic of the passive-aggressive personality type is that he/she rarely is able to express anger in a direct, forceful way. Instead, the anger is expressed in a series of short, aggressive bursts and passive retreats. The passive aggressive personality lives in a pressure cooker and inevitably must end up exploding. But once the explosion is over, they will end up where they started: in the same passive aggressive holding pattern, leading nowhere. Passive aggressives can also be thought of as belonging to the larger family of masochists who enjoy inflicting pain on themselves by not really letting go of their anger--by the same token, they appear to enjoy engaging in minor skirmishes, where they may win a minor battle or two but never can truly claim victory in an 'all out war'.At the outset of 'Cyrus', we see that we're dealing with some very screwed up passive aggressive types. John's ex-wife, Jamie, aggressively enters his house without telling him and then catches him masturbating. At first, her reaction is normal, heading for the door, shrieking with great embarrassment after catching him in the act. But after listening to his lame explanation that he had ""jock itch"", Jamie passively tells him she didn't see anything and the confrontation dies.If the characters in Cyrus were merely neurotic losers, the film wouldn't be very funny. Wisely, the film's scenarists, the Duplass brothers, also infuse their characters with some endearing qualities. John is spontaneous when he leads a group of party goers in the Human League's 80s hit, 'Don't you want me baby'; Cyrus has some great talent as a keyboardist/composer of electronic pop music; Molly is uninhibited and non-judgmental when she acts on her sexual impulses and Jamie is a supportive ex to John who suffers from low self-esteem.But despite all the endearing qualities, the Oedipal conflict is too strong from preventing the two male suitors from going to war over the affections of Molly, torn in her roles as both mother and lover. There's a great scene after John moves in with Molly where they're about to make passionate love in the living room when Cyrus (who has let himself in), casually turns on the light and in a deadpan delivery, blurts out, ""Sorry for interrupting"". Instead of expressing their true feelings of genuine anger over having their lovemaking interrupted, John meekly exclaims, ""Good to see you"" and Molly, in an even more weak and half-assed voice, whispers, ""Hi!""There are other moments where Cyrus will do something outrageous such as going into the bathroom while his mother is taking a shower and John passively stews but takes no action. Not all of Cyrus' stratagems are necessarily passive aggressive posturing. When he decides to move out of his mother's house, he's clearly trying to manipulate her and succeeds; she's so wracked with guilt that she welcomes him back with open arms when he informs John that he intends to move back in (there's also a short kiss on the lips betraying the incestuous relationship that exists between mother and son).Molly is also guilty of blatant passivity in the form of being a classic enabler. She's constantly making excuses for Cyrus by maintaining that he's been ""going through so much"" (taken in by his fake panic attacks and outright manipulative behavior). John's ex-wife, Jamie, also has a problem in confronting reality when she tells John that she believes Molly and Cyrus are perfectly normal--ignoring Cyrus' quirky behavior in ordering John to climb a tree, act like a 'jaguar' and scream at the top of his lungs.The Second Act 'dark moment' (if you can call it that), is when John and Cyrus get into a fight at Jamie's wedding. Cyrus explodes in a jealous rage over John and Molly's continuing relationship and John retaliates over Cyrus hiding his shoes. This incident actually causes John to step out of his passive aggressive ways and speak plainly to Molly, when he asserts, ""Open your eyes"". The acceptance of reality is short-lived: Cyrus passively begs John's forgiveness, invites him back to the house and John meekly accepts at the film's end. Presumably, this truce will be short-lived and one has the distinct expectation that the minor border war between John and Cyrus will pick up soon enough again.'Cyrus' is really a one joke idea focusing on the unhealthy relationship between the two male principals. The humor comes in the variations of the passive aggressive behavior of the characters. 'Cyrus' is not unlike Larry David's 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' which is another kind of study of the passive aggressive personality. Not everyone will dig the humor of 'Cyrus'; but for the more patient film-goer, there are moments of true mirth that will pop up, as this exercise in passive aggressive shenanigans, plods along to its fitful conclusion.",3,A Paean to the Passive Aggressive,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,5235,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***No', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'like', 'movies',
