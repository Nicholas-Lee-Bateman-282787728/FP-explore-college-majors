871588,A1ESUYMIG3TZT0,B0006OA9CE,Bobby  W.,"[71, 74]","First off, if you want a very helpful supplement to your studyof algebra, then you should consider buying this DVD. If youstick with it, this video will prove to be a big help at abargain price.One of the reasons I bought this product was to see howsomeone could cram ten hours of content into a DVD at sucha low price. I opened the case expecting to see a doublesided disc, but lo and behold, the entire course is on oneside!To achieve this, the video had to be drastically compressed,so the image has a lot of pixel swimming. The audio is clearenough to understand, but there is a buzz sound on most ofthe clips.In this day and age, the low video quality may turn off alarge portion of the potential audience. I would have gladlypaid more for a dual-disc set or double sided disc withimproved specs.My second quibble concerns the use of a dry-erase marker board.Watching the ""talking hand"" do its thing is O.K., but a lotof time is spent watching the board being erased. I wouldsuggest using an electronic tablet or filming the problemsbeing done onscreen in an appropriate computer application.Again, this would boost the cost of the DVD, but it wouldbe worth it.It seems that much of the verbal presentation is off the cuffand could have used more forethought - there is a least onesegment that is ended mid-sentence (there is even a humorousspot where the presenter stops the lesson to answer a ringingtelephone).There are points where the tutor makes an errorand catches himself, there are also a couple spots whereerrors slip through. Nobody's perfect, but a bit more pre-planning and post-production polish would have helped.Still, I'd buy this product again as-is, and if the authormade similar videos on other math topics with the same amountof content at the same price, I'd get them, even if they weredone in the same fashion as this one.",4,"A commendable effort, but...",1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,1850,"['First', 'off', 'want', 'very', 'helpful', 'supplement', 'studyof', 'algebra', 'then', 'should', 'consider', 'buying', 'DVD', 'youstick', 'video', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'big', 'help', 'abargain', 'price.One', 'reasons', 'bought', 'product', 'was', 'see', 'howsomeone', 'could', 'cram', 'ten', 'hours', 'content', 'DVD', 'sucha', 'low', 'price', 'opened', 'case', 'expecting', 'see', 'doublesided', 'disc', 'lo', 'behold', 'entire', 'course', 'oneside', 'achieve', 'video', 'had', 'be', 'drastically', 'compressed', 'image', 'lot', 'pixel', 'swimming', 'audio', 'clearenough', 'understand', 'buzz', 'sound', 'most', 'ofthe', 'clips.In', 'day', 'age', 'low', 'video', 'quality', 'may', 'turn', 'off', 'portion', 'potential', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'gladlypaid', 'more', 'dual-disc', 'set', 'double', 'sided', 'disc', 'withimproved', 'specs.My', 'second', 'quibble', 'concerns', 'use', 'dry-erase', 'marker', 'board.Watching', 'talking', 'hand', 'do', 'thing', 'O.K.', 'lotof', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'board', 'being', 'erased', 'wouldsuggest', 'using', 'electronic', 'tablet', 'filming', 'problemsbeing', 'done', 'onscreen', 'appropriate', 'computer', 'application.Again', 'would', 'boost', 'cost', 'DVD', 'wouldbe', 'worth', 'it.It', 'much', 'verbal', 'presentation', 'cuffand', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'forethought', 'least', 'onesegment', 'ended', 'mid-sentence', 'even', 'humorousspot', 'where', 'presenter', 'lesson', 'answer', 'ringingtelephone', 'are', 'points', 'where', 'tutor', 'errorand', 'catches', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'spots', 'whereerrors', 'slip', 'Nobody', 'perfect', 'bit', 'more', 'pre-planning', 'post-production', 'polish', 'would', 'have', 'helped.Still', ""'d"", 'buy', 'product', 'again', 'as-is', 'authormade', 'similar', 'videos', 'other', 'math', 'topics', 'same', 'amountof', 'content', 'same', 'price', ""'d"", 'get', 'even', 'weredone', 'same', 'fashion', 'one']",N/A

Of course not all information is covered in the DVD's. Think of it as an overview of hot topics. I have used these DVD's before I took a class and them reviewed them along the way. I also have purchased some of the idoit and dummy guides as a type of work book. They all together give you a different way to look at the math martial. Because as you know, most math books are written by brainy math folks, and they are not the easiest to follow.",5,Good stuff,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,544,"['have', 'DVD', 'lessons', 'are', 'great', 'cover', 'basics', 'are', 'important', 'class', 'course', 'not', 'information', 'covered', 'DVD', 'Think', 'overview', 'hot', 'topics', 'have', 'used', 'DVD', 'took', 'class', 'reviewed', 'along', 'way', 'also', 'have', 'purchased', 'idoit', 'dummy', 'guides', 'type', 'work', 'book', 'together', 'give', 'different', 'way', 'look', 'math', 'martial', 'know', 'most', 'math', 'books', 'are', 'written', 'brainy', 'math', 'folks', 'are', 'not', 'easiest', 'follow']",N/A

I was totally lost in my algebra course until I found this tool that has made my life so much easier (at least as far as algebra is concerned).  Jason Gibson takes us through each step of math and algebra in a clear, concise and understandable manner.  Each step is demonstrated with multiple problems.  If you still feel as if you don't get it, you can back the DVD up and go over it until you feel confident.Jason's voice is calming and assuring.  If you don't spend any money on any other tools to help you with math - spend it on this DVD.  I've purchased the next DVD's for the algebra series, The Algebra 2 Tutor, and I'm confident it will be just as good.This tool has saved my grade in algebra!",5,I rate this DVD a 10 star math-learning tool,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,756,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'positive', 'things', 'video', 'was', 'totally', 'lost', 'algebra', 'course', 'found', 'tool', 'made', 'life', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'algebra', 'concerned', 'Jason', 'Gibson', 'step', 'math', 'algebra', 'clear', 'concise', 'understandable', 'manner', 'step', 'demonstrated', 'multiple', 'problems', 'still', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'can', 'back', 'DVD', 'up', 'go', 'feel', 'confident.Jason', 'voice', 'calming', 'assuring', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'money', 'other', 'tools', 'help', 'math', 'spend', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'next', 'DVD', 'algebra', 'series', 'Algebra', '2', 'Tutor', ""'m"", 'confident', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'good.This', 'tool', 'saved', 'grade', 'algebra']",N/A
871592,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0006OA9CE,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","First, it should be noted that Jason has re-done this DVD and repackaged it as Algebra I parts I and II.  This version was the first one he put out, and has a very low production quality.  You basically just see his hand in front of a white board.  The re-released one is like all his other DVDs where you actually see him in the shot, and the audio and video are much much improved.  So, if you are looking for something at this level I would go for those.Substantively, the material is well presented and Jason walks you through step-by-step in how to do the problems.  In each problem he shows every step, does not skip anything no matter how easy or apparent it might be and as a result you really come away knowing the process of how to tackle the problems.  There are a couple instances where he makes a mistake in the math.  In his later videos when he makes mistakes he either corrects it in post-production or as he works out the problems.  In this one if he does not catch it, it bleeds through to the end of the solution.  Depending on your level you may catch those.  That is another reason you may want to go with the updated version.I rate most of Jason's material 5 star, but dropped this one down because of the rough audio, video and the mistakes that go through uncorrected.  Like one other reviewer said, if you do get this one, don't let it sour you on the others, because the overall production quality goes way up, and Jason's teaching style (provided you can learn by watching a recorded lecture) is excellent.  I have made it through the entire calculus sequence at my school with a 4.0 average due in large part to using Jason's DVDs as supplements.  While this will not teach you an entire pre-algebra or intermediate algebra course, it will teach you all the key concepts that you will need when you get to the material not covered on the DVD.",4,Very solid,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,1870,"['First', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Jason', 're-done', 'DVD', 'repackaged', 'Algebra', 'parts', 'II', 'version', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'put', 'out', 'very', 'low', 'production', 'quality', 'basically', 'just', 'see', 'hand', 'front', 'white', 'board', 're-released', 'one', 'other', 'DVDs', 'where', 'actually', 'see', 'shot', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'much', 'much', 'improved', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'level', 'would', 'go', 'those.Substantively', 'material', 'well', 'presented', 'Jason', 'walks', 'step-by-step', 'how', 'do', 'problems', 'problem', 'step', 'not', 'skip', 'anything', 'matter', 'how', 'easy', 'apparent', 'might', 'be', 'result', 'really', 'come', 'away', 'knowing', 'process', 'how', 'tackle', 'problems', 'are', 'couple', 'instances', 'where', 'mistake', 'math', 'later', 'videos', 'when', 'mistakes', 'either', 'post-production', 'out', 'problems', 'one', 'not', 'catch', 'end', 'solution', 'Depending', 'level', 'may', 'catch', 'reason', 'may', 'want', 'go', 'updated', 'version.I', 'rate', 'most', 'Jason', 'material', '5', 'star', 'dropped', 'one', 'down', 'rough', 'audio', 'video', 'mistakes', 'go', 'uncorrected', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'said', 'do', 'get', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'sour', 'others', 'overall', 'production', 'quality', 'way', 'up', 'Jason', 'teaching', 'style', 'provided', 'can', 'learn', 'watching', 'recorded', 'lecture', 'excellent', 'have', 'made', 'entire', 'calculus', 'sequence', 'school', '4.0', 'average', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'using', 'Jason', 'DVDs', 'supplements', 'will', 'not', 'teach', 'entire', 'pre-algebra', 'intermediate', 'algebra', 'course', 'will', 'teach', 'key', 'concepts', 'will', 'need', 'when', 'get', 'material', 'not', 'covered', 'DVD']",N/A
