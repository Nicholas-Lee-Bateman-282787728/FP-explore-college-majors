The writing was witty, sharp and had us men pegged down.Watching these episodes now makes me wonder if it were shown again following or during the lineup of TWO AND A HALF MEN and BIG BANG THEORY if it wouldn't be a hit?  There hasn't been a funnier scene in a comedy than watching Jamie making coffee in the first episode.These DVD's came quickly are in perfect condition.

When Scott Layne guest starred on this show, I felt that this was the best show of the entire series!! &#34;Men Behaving Badly&#34; showed how the typical chicanery of the single male manifested itself through getting involved in situations which they would not get into if they thought clearly... Even if your typical guy has a good head on his shoulders, he usually does not think with his head, what he thinks with is not very bright at all, BELIEVE ME!!.. The comic relief on this show was more than adequate for a prime time television slot, and most people I know really found this show to be extremely entertaining!!! &#34;Men Behaving Badly&#34; gets a definite thumbs up in my book!!",5,Badly means behaving like guys!!,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,798,"['thought', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'Ken', 'Marino', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'series', 'When', 'Scott', 'Layne', 'guest', 'starred', 'show', 'felt', 'was', 'best', 'show', 'entire', 'series', '34', 'Men', 'Behaving', 'Badly', '34', 'showed', 'how', 'typical', 'chicanery', 'single', 'male', 'manifested', 'getting', 'involved', 'situations', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'thought', 'clearly', 'Even', 'typical', 'guy', 'good', 'head', 'shoulders', 'usually', 'not', 'think', 'head', 'what', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'BELIEVE', 'ME', 'comic', 'relief', 'show', 'was', 'more', 'adequate', 'prime', 'time', 'television', 'slot', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'really', 'found', 'show', 'be', 'extremely', 'entertaining', '34', 'Men', 'Behaving', 'Badly', '34', 'definite', 'up', 'book']",Men Behaving Badly - The Complete Series

1034148,A33FCLUEQSUD68,B000KGH0A2,Claire,"[0, 0]","OK I guess that isn't really fair to call it toilet humor but that sounded better than calling it man humor that revolves around typical guy issues such as sitting around drinking beer and watching sports while discussing the female sex. This show reminds me why I really miss the tv sitcom in this day and age of fantasy or reality tv. This show was plain fun back in the days when ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" were still funny- and still on. Rarely do I find a show that makes me laugh out loud but I do believe every episode of this show made me about wet my pants. Unfortunately, when Ron Eldard (as well as Justine Bateman) departed the show, the laughter went too. That was too bad b/c this show was so well-written and so funny- the characters and the dialogue and the situations were nothing less than lovable and amusing. Even watching it over a decade later, I still find it just as funny as I did back in 1996. I have noticed that a lot of shows I loved when they were on are now not as good as ""way back when."" I still seem to find early eps of ""Seinfeld"" & ""Friends"" funny plus early eps of ""The Office"" & ""My Name Is Earl"" + ""Modern Family"" worth watching. ""Men Behaving Badly"" is a trip- if you are looking for some cheap funny entertainment that is ""cleaner"" than some of the more graphic shows on these days (i.e. ""The League"" is another funny man-show but more R-rated) you should invest in this show. A post-SNL Rob Schneider & a post-ER Ron Eldard are hilarious as best friends/roommates in this comedy adapted from the British sitcom. Too bad this one didn't last as long as its British sister (or brother?)show. As far as I'm concerned, once Ron Eldard left the show, it was over but with this set you are getting the whole series which continued to run for a few eps into a 2nd season with Eldard only guest-starring in the 1st ep to tie up the loose ends. So to make a long review even longer, this show is funny and well worth the $8 that I see it costs now. I paid $24.99 to get it when it first came out 3 years ago and I do not regret paying more. I still love laughing at this show. The quality is good. I had no problems with any dvds. There are no exciting extras so don't expect any commentaries etc. What you get is just the show but be glad since it took over a decade to get this amazingly funny show on dvd.",5,"Yes, even a chick can embrace toilet humor!",1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,2339,"['OK', 'guess', ""n't"", 'really', 'fair', 'call', 'toilet', 'humor', 'sounded', 'better', 'calling', 'man', 'around', 'typical', 'guy', 'issues', 'such', 'sitting', 'drinking', 'beer', 'watching', 'sports', 'discussing', 'female', 'sex', 'show', 'why', 'really', 'miss', 'tv', 'sitcom', 'day', 'age', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'tv', 'show', 'was', 'plain', 'fun', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'Seinfeld', 'Friends', 'were', 'still', 'funny-', 'still', 'Rarely', 'do', 'find', 'show', 'loud', 'do', 'believe', 'episode', 'show', 'made', 'wet', 'pants', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'as', 'well', 'Justine', 'Bateman', 'departed', 'show', 'laughter', 'went', 'too', 'was', 'too', 'bad', 'b/c', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'well-written', 'so', 'funny-', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'situations', 'were', 'nothing', 'less', 'lovable', 'amusing', 'Even', 'watching', 'decade', 'later', 'still', 'find', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'did', 'back', '1996', 'have', 'noticed', 'lot', 'shows', 'loved', 'when', 'were', 'are', 'now', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'still', 'seem', 'find', 'early', 'eps', 'Seinfeld', 'Friends', 'funny', 'early', 'eps', 'Office', 'Name', 'Earl', '+', 'Modern', 'Family', 'worth', 'watching', 'Men', 'Behaving', 'Badly', 'trip-', 'are', 'looking', 'cheap', 'funny', 'entertainment', 'cleaner', 'more', 'graphic', 'shows', 'days', 'i.e', 'League', 'funny', 'man-show', 'more', 'R-rated', 'should', 'invest', 'show', 'post-SNL', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'post-ER', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'are', 'hilarious', 'best', 'friends/roommates', 'comedy', 'adapted', 'British', 'sitcom', 'Too', 'bad', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'as', 'long', 'British', 'sister', 'brother', 'show', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'once', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'left', 'show', 'was', 'over', 'set', 'are', 'getting', 'whole', 'series', 'continued', 'run', 'few', 'eps', '2nd', 'season', 'Eldard', 'only', 'guest-starring', '1st', 'ep', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'So', 'make', 'long', 'review', 'even', 'longer', 'show', 'funny', 'well', '8', 'see', 'now', 'paid', '24.99', 'get', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'paying', 'more', 'still', 'love', 'laughing', 'show', 'quality', 'good', 'had', 'problems', 'dvds', 'are', 'exciting', 'extras', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'commentaries', 'etc', 'What', 'get', 'just', 'show', 'be', 'glad', 'took', 'over', 'decade', 'get', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'show', 'dvd']",Men Behaving Badly - The Complete Series
