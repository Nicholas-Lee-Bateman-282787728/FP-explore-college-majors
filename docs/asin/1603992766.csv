Episodes in this season touched on many life issues that are occuring today, like feeling towards voting, women's issues, classroom cheating, definitions of female beauty, bullying,students dealing with immature parents that run away leaving children to cope alone, and coping with school rivalries.  One episode concerning two high school students that marry seems dated as the average age for people marrying today has inched towards 30.:)As to the picture quality, it is better than the first seasons' boxed set.  However, just like the first season, the quality of the picture does not take away from the well written and acted stories.

193311,A2IS16K96YSFDV,1603992766,Eric Mayforth,"[6, 11]","In itsinitial season, ""Room 222"" garnered attention for tackling socially relevant issues in the setting of a racially diverse Los Angeles high school.  In its sophomore (1970-71) season, the show's 26 episodes follow history teacher Pete Dixon (Lloyd Haynes), guidance counselor Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas), principal Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine), and English teacher Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine) as they attempt to make a positive difference in the students' lives.Season Two had episodes on topics that were at the forefront in the early Seventies such racial issues, women's lib, drugs, and challenges to authority and tradition, but other episodes covered constants in teenage life such as the difficulties that different types of students have getting along, school elections, cheating, bullying, envy, teenage marriages and crushes, and rivalries between high schools.Perhaps the episode that seems most jarring from the standpoint of today is the one in which Mr. Dixon teaches about Lincoln by encouraging his students to take nothing at face value, examine all facts, and then come to their own conclusion--as a result of this he encounters opposition from a conservative.  In 2011, we live in a country where liberals have nothing to fear when they go to conservative college campuses, but conservatives have to travel with bodyguards, are shouted down, encounter draconian campus speech codes, and are vastly more likely to have their cars keyed; where Republicans hold presidential debates on MSNBC but Democrats refuse to do so on Fox News; and where liberals would shut down talk radio and Fox News in a heartbeat if they could get away with it, but no conservative would dream of muzzling any left-wing news outlet.  It was simply a hoot and a half from the standpoint of today to see the episode on Lincoln portray conservatism as the authoritarian ideology and to see liberalism portrayed as the ideology of open and free inquiry.Some complain about the picture quality on this DVD set, but I didn't see it as a big issue.  I didn't agree with every position that ""Room 222"" took, but the main characters are all likable and the show is a thought-provoking, engaging high school drama that is well worth the time spent watching it.",4,Room 222 Back in Session,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,2264,"['itsinitial', 'season', 'Room', '222', 'garnered', 'attention', 'tackling', 'socially', 'relevant', 'issues', 'setting', 'racially', 'diverse', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'high', 'school', 'sophomore', '1970-71', 'season', 'show', '26', 'episodes', 'follow', 'history', 'teacher', 'Pete', 'Dixon', 'Lloyd', 'Haynes', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'Liz', 'McIntyre', 'Denise', 'Nicholas', 'principal', 'Seymour', 'Kaufman', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'English', 'teacher', 'Alice', 'Johnson', 'Karen', 'Valentine', 'attempt', 'make', 'positive', 'difference', 'students', 'lives.Season', 'Two', 'had', 'episodes', 'topics', 'were', 'forefront', 'early', 'Seventies', 'such', 'racial', 'issues', 'women', 'lib', 'drugs', 'challenges', 'authority', 'tradition', 'other', 'episodes', 'covered', 'constants', 'teenage', 'life', 'such', 'difficulties', 'different', 'types', 'students', 'have', 'getting', 'along', 'school', 'elections', 'cheating', 'bullying', 'envy', 'teenage', 'marriages', 'crushes', 'rivalries', 'high', 'schools.Perhaps', 'episode', 'most', 'jarring', 'standpoint', 'today', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Dixon', 'Lincoln', 'encouraging', 'students', 'take', 'nothing', 'face', 'value', 'examine', 'facts', 'then', 'come', 'own', 'conclusion', 'result', 'opposition', 'conservative', '2011', 'live', 'country', 'where', 'liberals', 'have', 'nothing', 'fear', 'when', 'go', 'conservative', 'college', 'campuses', 'conservatives', 'have', 'travel', 'bodyguards', 'are', 'shouted', 'down', 'encounter', 'draconian', 'campus', 'speech', 'codes', 'are', 'vastly', 'more', 'likely', 'have', 'cars', 'keyed', 'where', 'Republicans', 'hold', 'presidential', 'debates', 'MSNBC', 'Democrats', 'refuse', 'do', 'so', 'Fox', 'News', 'where', 'liberals', 'would', 'shut', 'down', 'talk', 'radio', 'Fox', 'News', 'heartbeat', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'conservative', 'would', 'dream', 'muzzling', 'left-wing', 'news', 'outlet', 'was', 'simply', 'hoot', 'half', 'standpoint', 'today', 'see', 'episode', 'Lincoln', 'portray', 'conservatism', 'authoritarian', 'ideology', 'see', 'liberalism', 'portrayed', 'ideology', 'open', 'free', 'inquiry.Some', 'complain', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'big', 'issue', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'position', 'Room', '222', 'took', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'show', 'thought-provoking', 'engaging', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'well', 'time', 'spent', 'watching']",N/A
193312,A5FN3XCF75H2E,1603992766,Gerard Triano,"[2, 2]","This was a revolutionary concept for its time, late 1960s. With the success of Up The Down Staircase (book and film), this was a half hour series which depicted in a serio comedic way the issues surrounding a fictitious metropolitan high school, Walt Whitman High. Although the series' major focus was on the history teacher, Pete Dixon, and guidance counselor, Liz McIntyre, this was an ensemble effort with down the line top acting and writing. Principal Seymour Kaufman and student teacher turned tenured teacher Alice Johnson completed the nucleus of the cast. And assorted faculty and students completed the interracial ensemble. The stories are heartwarming and realistic, many of them more dramatic than comedic. Highly recommend first two seasons, when the show seemed to peak.

But this show came at a time when the children wanted answers and were unwilling to wait for when the adults felt like answering, if at all. My sister and I remember how my mother wouldn't allow us to see this show. We could never figure out why. Seeing how the students were not willing to accept the answer &#34;because I said so&#34;, I can see why.By today's standards this show is quite tame. But it is because these things actually occurred that that it is quite tame. And you need both seasons to really understand what happened back then.
