While his performance was certainly solid, it was by no means the oscar winning portrayal I was hoping to see. And for him to have said that the role was so disturbing that it was causing insomnia and a lot of his problems--he clearly had some emotional issues then, because the Joker was actually a lot more tame that I thought he was going to be.

Most movies these days are not worth the price of admission to a movie theater let alone the price of a blu-ray disc. Dark Knight is the exception to both statements. I won't prattle on about plot, story, Ledger, and so forth.The picture quality here is superb! I didn't see a single film-grain and that has been present in every other blu-ray I've purchased. Hell of a nice change there. The blacks are dark as pitch which overall helps the contrast of color in the movie immensely. The IMAX shots are breath taking. When Batman is in China and does his dive off the sky skraper I was sucked in - exactly what it was supposed to do in the theater but failed on me. One of the biggest perks here - no make up lines on the characters. The director knew this was the time of HD - I challenge anyone to find a flaw in this presentation.The single downside here is Batman. Christian Baille bale - wahtever - his voice as batman sounds like he just sucked down 3 packs of cigs while having larengitis. He might look like Batman/Bruce of the comics but he sounds like sh... really bad :)Bottom line - a great movie, great BD transfer, well worth every penny.

659106,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JPY0,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[18, 25]","(4.5 *'s) Everything is in place.  When a comic book action movie gets tipsy between the fortunes of good and evil, and one forgets the good guys are supposed to prevail, then you have a real comic adventure.  As tangible a menace as we could ever hope for (here played formidably by the late Heath Ledger), the Joker's every appearance rarely lets up with shock and surprise.  For these reasons, `The Dark Knight' is destined to become (along with `Spiderman 2') one of the greatest comic adventures ever made.Excellent performances, an intelligent script, and tension to match the riveting action, render `Batman Begins,' the acclaimed start-up, as just that--a beginning.  The only real fault I can find here is a resolution that lingers too long.  Too many winded speeches, while important and illuminating, take out some of the dramatic tension delivered in the movie's first two acts.  What the screenwriters accomplished in effective sound bites, turns the movie slightly too ponderous toward the end.  More a plus than a minus, though, just when you think the movie's over, it ain't over yet.The film wastes no time as Joker's clown-faced warriors hand glide across pulleys to rob a bank.  Treachery is in their ranks as the Joker has them kill themselves off ""so there will be less to split the share.""  The bills have been marked, however, and a would-be client of millionaire Bruce Wayne has them tracing it to an accountant from Hong Kong.  The Bourne element doesn't last too long, but once we're planted back at Gotham, the mob, the Joker, and the foreign gangsters, all have a stake in the bank money.  But as we're about to see, the Joker isn't after the city's money, he's after its soul.  ""Madness is like gravity,"" he chortles.  Actions speak louder than words; however, for surely it is chaos he covets.""A hero with a face"" (at least for now) Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham's District Attorney, a stalwart force to bring criminals to justice, jeopardizing his own life for the city's welfare.  The Joker will have none of it and breaks up a local crime meeting to instill a greater resolve among the crime syndicate.  With a menacing video, he threatens to kill targeted innocents unless the Batman is unmasked.  At Dent's side is fellow attorney and love interest, Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal), one with a keen sense of every situation and a steely resolve.  Constantly threatening the lives of key law-and-order figures:  The mayor, a judge, Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman), Rachel, and Harvey, the Joker makes a relentless and suspenseful shell game creating endless tension throughout the movie.  Whether dealing with individuals or groups, The Joker leaves burdening choices testing the nerves of the entire city.Heath Ledger is simply masterful.  Ledger restored the creepy, sinister menace as the Joker was originally intended.  It's hard to compare him with Jack Nicholson.  Nicholson gave us great entertainment, giving us both the Joker's malice and laughter.  His romp was admirable, but I have to give Ledger the edge.  His laughter and jokes only send chills up one's spine.  Indicative of his talent, it's at those knifepoint moments when the Joker shares three separate stories about his indelible smile that Ledger's magic works the best.  When the Joker asks his interrogator, ""How many of your friends have I killed?"" I thought I was listening to the Devil's voice in `The Exorcist'.  Rumors of a posthumous Oscar nomination are not token gestures.Christian Bale is slightly eclipsed, but he still brings a quiet, brooding appearance as he did previously.  Second honors, rather, should go to Eckhart who adds so much.  As a multi-faceted actor, he does good and evil with tremendous skill.  Gyllenhaal, who's had her fine moments, really delivers a truly round and believable Rachel as if someone forgot to tell her the movie had comic strip origins.  Michael Caine is a perfect Alfred, and Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, the second Alfred of Wayne enterprises without seeming extraneous.  None of the supporting players seem to falter, either.Screenwriters Jonathan and Christopher Nolan do a great job, except where I've indicated, but some of the plot points are going to lose some children [including me] along the way, and although they limit the clich&eacute;s, they're even smarter to make them count.  Both Nolan and editor, Lee Smith, deserve loads of credit for what they've created.  If they tightened up and hadn't gotten so ponderously philosophical near the end, they could have made a perfect film.  Here they come awfully close.(Although I'm from nearby Chicago, they transform the Windy City nicely enough to make us forget where the mayhem is actually transpiring.)",5,"""Either You Die a Hero or

659110,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00005JPY0,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[2, 6]","I never knew I could love a superhero movie so much. What made this film great was its action, story, and great characters with came together to form a near-perfect film. Usually I don't understand superhero movies; I watched all three Spider-Man movies and I still don't understand, I didn't get the second X-Men movie, and I didn't like Fantastic 4. But The Dark Knight takes a different approach for all movie goers. It's easy to understand (Usually I need a superhero guru of knowledge to explain things to me), it didn't focus too much on relationships (Unlike Spider-Man), and it was more about action than talking.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Batman (a.k.a. Bruce Wayne) is considered a fugitive by Gotham City, and is wanted despite his heroism and getting scum off the street like the mob groups. He eventually forms an alliance with the police and the district attorney Harvey Dent, and even his former girlfriend Rachel, and together they remove several mob groups and hundreds of fugitives are arrested. All seems to be well for a small period of time until a person known only as The Joker shows up and starts killing people, all in return for Batman to reveal himself or more people get killed. Batman becomes the most despised person in Gotham over the fact that people's lives are being taken every day because of him, and there is nothing they can do about it. So Batman must hunt down The Joker and save his friends and the citizens of Gotham City, only this movie doesn't end how you'd predict it to.MUSIC: The music is fantastic and goes great with the already near-perfect film.DISTURBING FACTOR: I never expected a superhero movie to be this creepy and disturbing. There are some scenes which make this film borderline an R-rating for how violent some of them are. Heath Ledger really does a great job at portraying Joker as a complete psychopath who you'd be terrified to come across.ACTION: Lots of shooting, lots of hand-to-hand combat, lots of vehicular mayhem, lots of explosions, and even more! This is one of the best action films I've seen in quite some time.ENTERTAINMENT: This film has a lot of unexpected scenes, even things occurred that I would have never been able to predict. This film is a roller coaster ride of plot twists, adrenaline-rushing action scenes, and it's even suspenseful, all the way to the bizarre ending. This is without a doubt one of the best films I've seen in quite some time, and is a definite must-see for any movie buffs. You don't even need to be a fan of superheroes to enjoy this kickass movie, just go watch it... NOW!OVERALL: The beginning of the movie is slow with some relationship problems and a few other things, but when the ball starts rolling it doesn't stop and you don't want it to end any time soon.THE GOOD: Great story, great actors, great action, surprisingly disturbing, little focus on relationship problems, and it's an overall kickass movie.THE BAD: The beginning is slow and goes into relationship problems, but it ends quickly at least.",5,THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!  9.25 OUT OF 10,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,3010,"['never', 'knew', 'could', 'love', 'superhero', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'great', 'was', 'action', 'story', 'great', 'characters', 'came', 'together', 'form', 'near-perfect', 'film', 'Usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'superhero', 'movies', 'watched', 'three', 'Spider-Man', 'movies', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'second', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Fantastic', '4', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'different', 'approach', 'movie', 'goers', 'easy', 'understand', 'Usually', 'need', 'superhero', 'guru', 'knowledge', 'explain', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'relationships', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Batman', 'a.k.a', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'considered', 'fugitive', 'Gotham', 'City', 'wanted', 'heroism', 'getting', 'scum', 'street', 'mob', 'groups', 'eventually', 'alliance', 'police', 'district', 'attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'even', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Rachel', 'together', 'remove', 'several', 'mob', 'groups', 'hundreds', 'fugitives', 'are', 'arrested', 'be', 'well', 'small', 'period', 'time', 'person', 'known', 'only', 'Joker', 'up', 'killing', 'people', 'return', 'Batman', 'reveal', 'more', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'Batman', 'most', 'despised', 'person', 'Gotham', 'fact', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'day', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'So', 'Batman', 'must', 'hunt', 'down', 'Joker', 'save', 'friends', 'citizens', 'Gotham', 'City', 'only', 'movie', ""n't"", 'end', 'how', ""'d"", 'predict', 'music', 'fantastic', 'great', 'already', 'near-perfect', 'film.DISTURBING', 'FACTOR', 'never', 'expected', 'superhero', 'movie', 'be', 'creepy', 'disturbing', 'are', 'scenes', 'make', 'film', 'borderline', 'R-rating', 'how', 'violent', 'are', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Joker', 'complete', 'psychopath', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'terrified', 'come', 'across.ACTION', 'Lots', 'shooting', 'lots', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'lots', 'vehicular', 'mayhem', 'lots', 'explosions', 'even', 'more', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time.ENTERTAINMENT', 'film', 'lot', 'unexpected', 'scenes', 'even', 'things', 'occurred', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'predict', 'film', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'plot', 'twists', 'adrenaline-rushing', 'action', 'scenes', 'even', 'suspenseful', 'way', 'bizarre', 'ending', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'definite', 'must-see', 'movie', 'buffs', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'be', 'fan', 'superheroes', 'enjoy', 'kickass', 'movie', 'just', 'go', 'watch', 'NOW', 'OVERALL', 'beginning', 'movie', 'slow', 'relationship', 'problems', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'when', 'ball', 'rolling', ""n't"", 'stop', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'time', 'soon.THE', 'GOOD', 'Great', 'story', 'great', 'actors', 'great', 'action', 'surprisingly', 'disturbing', 'little', 'focus', 'relationship', 'problems', 'overall', 'kickass', 'movie.THE', 'BAD', 'beginning', 'slow', 'relationship', 'problems', 'quickly', 'least']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659114,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005JPY0,A. Estes,"[1, 3]","Long have we waited for a Batman movie this good. It seems that the perfect Batman movie -- that which gets the legend right, does it intelligently and is still a complete thrill ride -- was beyond us from the get-go. Tim Burton tried, oh he tried, with ""Batman"" in 1989. Yeah, that movie was good. Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, a brooding Batman, blah blah blah. And then there was ""Batman Returns"" and if you like your Batman dark, well, this was a cup of black coffee. However, since dark and moody films don't sell action figures, Joel Schumacher was brought in for the next two, and decidedly campier sequels -- ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin"" -- effectively killing off the franchise and leaving it for dead for eight long years. When Christoper Nolan brought Batman back to the big screen in 2005 with the critically acclaimed (hey, Ebert liked it) ""Batman Begins,"" it was a breath of fresh air. With Christian Bale as the caped crusader, and a top-notch supporting cast, we were finally given a Batman film with class. The only downside is, it didn't quite deliver all the goodies one would expect from a Batman film. Enter 2008 and here we are with what is easily the most hyped movie of the year, and surely, the best action/adventure/comic-book/whatever to come out in years, ""The Dark Knight.""Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, with other ""Begins"" alumni Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman bringing their supporting roles back to life, too. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) Katie Holmes is too busy trying to keep Tom Cruise from going 'batty' again, so the much more credible Maggie Gyllenhaal has stepped into her previous role as Bruce Wayne love interest/Gotham City public servant Rachel Dawes, while Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent, a hero gone tragically wrong. However, the true centerpiece of this film, and that which it will go down in history for, is the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. No doubt, this is his legacy -- the role he will be remembered for -- and with so many great actors at hand, it's amazing how he just steals each and every scene he is a part of.As a sequel to ""Batman Begins,"" ""The Dark Knight"" ups the ante on everything. First off, Christian Bale is much more natural this time around as The Caped Crusader, while Gyllenhaal -- although downplayed -- lends the film a little more maturity than Holmes could have. Aaron Eckhart is the unsung hero of the film, overshadowed, to say the least, by Ledger's Joker. Eckhart handles the neccessary duality of the character with ease and keeps you sympathetic to his cause even through the final scenes. Now, as for Ledger's Joker, where do you begin? To say this is a far cry from Jack Nicholson's interpretation would be an understatement. Let's just say that this Joker makes Jack's version look like Cesar Romero. This version of the character is less interested in the usual criminal activities like getting money and killing innocent citizens. This Joker is more of a Tyler Durden in ""Fight Club"" character. He seems more interested in shaking up society and making the citizens of Gotham City question their most basic values and reasons for existing. Ledger gives the performance it's all, and it shows. He is mesmerizing in each scene and steals the show, whether he was trying to or not.As a director returning to the franchise, Christopher Nolan seems just as confident and consistent as he did with the first film. ""The Dark Knight"" keeps in tone and consistency with ""Begins"" and the anticipation we felt at the end of that film is delivered upon ten-fold. The action scenes themselves are a blast, and quite the step-up from before, I might add. As mature as this film may be, there are definitely some jollies to be derived from seeing The Joker handle a bazooka inside a moving vehicle. Nolan handles the action sequences with ease, and they are just as memorable as the characters themselves. Of course, this is a pretty violent and disturbing film at times, so you might want to think twice about bringing a small child to see it, even after you bought him those nifty Dark Knight underoos at Target.Now, as for the plot of the film, I'm not gonna dig into that. There are plenty of reviews that go into it, and as someone who purposely avoided any details of this film's plot as possible prior to it's release, I found that not having too much previous knowledge made it a much more enjoyable movie-going experience. To say the least, this is the definitive Batman film. I didn't need to write a review to tell you that, and you didn't need to read it to know it. It just is. It dwarves even Tim Burton's creation and more than makes up for abysmal failures of past. Some could take issue with it's length -- clocking in at over two and a half hours -- but the film is so good, I kept hoping against hope that it wouldn't end. There is simply so much going on in this film, so not only is the length a good thing, but it also warrants repeat viewings. If nothing else I have said has convinced you, let me just say this: Believe the hype.",5,Heroes and villains,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,5091,"['Long', 'have', 'waited', 'Batman', 'movie', 'good',

The acting in this film is superb, the cast incredibly well picked out, the script is intelligent, and the art direction is breathtaking.The two qualms I had withBatman Beginswere the casting of Katie Holmes as Rachel and the fact that the dialogue felt forced and comic book-like. Those two problems have been solved in The Dark Knight with the recasting of the part of Rachel - now given to the arguably less attractive, but much more talented actress Maggie Gyllenhaal and the dialogue contains less soundbites and is much closer to what real people would say in similar situations.Cinematically, the special effects, stunts, cinematography, and all visual and audio effects are exceptional and far more stunning than one would ever hope for from a summer blockbuster. The Dark Knight is an incredibly intense film, with multiple complex storylines, several villains, several heroes, and no mistakes of any kind. It's truly an artistic achievement.

All the ravers of this film are blinded. They idolize the spectacle before them because they want it to succeed. It is true, Batman Begins was a good movie. The Dark Knight does not equal or  match it, and it should.As I sat through this movie I noticed a strong resemblence to the 1989 film Batman with Michael Keaton. The staged feel of an already fake press, the marauding comic-like villians who fall on cue, the numerous subplots of Gothams crime bosses and alot of long, empty dialogue. Thats not to say theirs absolutely no good parts. Like in Batman 1989 some scenes really did shine. Jack Nicolsons Joker was pretty good with his, ""Wait'll they get a load of me"" stuff. And I harken back to that 1989 Joker who hung from a high perch and laughed while battling Batman. Was that same depiction in the Dark Knight?The Harvey Dent charactor was strained and boring. I couldnt believe how many times his name was uttered. What made it worse was that I could care less about his role. The nail in the coffin was Rachaels replacement. This woman was very unattractive in comparison to Katie Holmes(most guys agree)and drew zero empathy from me. The action scenes dissapointed on most levels. Sure, alot of swishes and booms took place but they were not cohesive. They were only there to fill the explosion quota. A good half of this film could have been removed to kill the dullness factor. I'm all for long substanative words but that element was missing. Scene jumping without relevance was another squasher.Ledger did put a worthwhile, unique spin on the Joker. I yearned for more of his charm. He did the same thing Nicholson did as it applies to outdoing everyone else. Its hard on a film when a superior actor alone carries it. This again is where it emulated Batman 1989. Ledgers excellent scenes are the only ones worth reviewing on the dvd and if your honest you'll admit it. Who's gonna play back Commissioner Gordons longwinded banter with anyone?Batman Begins had heartfelt quality dialogue that expounded on the personas of each the way a comicbook couldn't. I've seen some write that they have watched the Dark Knight over and over again. Something is wrong there. Only parts of this film can be watched over again and thats it. With all its shame, drudgery and forced hype it can only be left to you the viewer if we really want to continue down the road of regurgitating a 1989 Batman for this franchise.

First of all Heath Ledger pulls the Joker off really well, but Christian Bale's Batman is borderline silly with his over the to gravely voice, plus the film feels longer then it is, not to mention a little confusing. Some parts have good action, and they feel like a video game. But a good number of the movie is kinda dull, that's why this movie should have been called The Hype Knight, kinda reminds me of the story of the Emperor's New Clothes. Seriously The Joker is the best part, were as Two Face felt kinda unnecessary. They should have left him as Harvey Dent. Seriously Bolt was better then this, and i LOVE Bolt.

(As a side note, I challenge anyone to explain to me how the f*@# this movie landed a PG-13 rating).The film is not bad, and Ledger is absolutely mesmerizing in his Joker incarnation. However, the film suffers from massive flaws which show up early and often. The film dumps all semblance of narrative coherence about an hour in and begins to unravel. Sadly, this unraveling reveals an empty core inside an integument of glitz, glamour, explosions and depth. Characters are annoyingly beamed from one place to another with no explanation, only to have lazy, dull dialogue fill in the pieces. There is no focus, no tautness. Nolan attempts to serve a three course meal, when he might have been better served (no pun) focusing on a single course. One can imagine how much better the film would be if it focused on Batman's battles with the Joker, instead of twisting itself into a philosophical pretzel.More annoying than the lack of coherence is the attempted profundity of the dialogue. Every character babbles self-important, pseudo-deep nonsense. The peanut buttery flotsam of dialogue gets so thick it is hard to take seriously. Some lines border on being hillarious inspite of their best effort. Take this gem from the Joker:""You've changed things... forever. There's no going back. See, to them, you're just a freak... like me!""Yeah, I can really imagine a psychopathic lunatic uttering such nonsense! This is the type of analysis you expect from some vapid Freud wannabe. Even giving the Joker the benefit of the doubt as a symbolic character, it is a bit much.How about this precious line from Harvey Dent:""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.""Wow! This is less meaningfull than roasting a marshmallow in the bathtub and a lot more irritating. In fact, Harvey Dent's story is about as enjoyable as rubbing sandpaper on your forehead. Sadly, we are supposed to think of him as a hero. Unfortunately, like Victor Lanslow in Casablanca, we despise his white knight do-goodery.Aside from the margarine sticks called dialogue, the themes explored in The Dark Knight seem as if they were written down on a post it note by a sophomore who had just inhaled too much hippie lettuce (the duality of all people, collateral damage, greed, fate, the kinship between good and evil and so on. As another aside, although I don't think the Joker is a trope for Al Queda, there are less than subtle linkages between Gotham and post 9-11 New York). The semi-intelligent audience member can't help but feel like he or she is getting talked down to. Do we really need everything spelled out for us? And, if we do, does it really need to be so Coppolaesque?I was entertained through large swaths of this movie, but I found myself repeating one of the Joker's lines over and over: ""Why.....so......serious?""",3,Dissapointing and flawed.,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,2896,"['Flawed', 'masterpiece', 'No', 'Muddled', 'attempt', 'brilliance', 'Yes', 'side', 'note', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'explain', 'how', 'f*', '@', 'movie', 'landed', 'PG-13', 'rating', '.The', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'Ledger', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'Joker', 'incarnation', 'However', 'film', 'suffers', 'massive', 'flaws', 'show', 'up', 'early', 'often', 'film', 'semblance', 'narrative', 'coherence', 'hour', 'begins', 'unravel', 'Sadly', 'unraveling', 'empty', 'core', 'integument', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'explosions', 'depth', 'Characters', 'are', 'annoyingly', 'beamed', 'one', 'place', 'explanation', 'only', 'have', 'lazy', 'dull', 'dialogue', 'fill', 'pieces', 'focus', 'tautness', 'Nolan', 'serve', 'three', 'course', 'meal', 'when', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'pun', 'focusing', 'single', 'course', 'One', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'focused', 'Batman', 'battles', 'Joker', 'instead', 'twisting', 'philosophical', 'pretzel.More', 'annoying', 'lack', 'coherence', 'attempted', 'profundity', 'dialogue', 'character', 'self-important', 'pseudo-deep', 'nonsense', 'peanut', 'buttery', 'flotsam', 'dialogue', 'so', 'thick', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'lines', 'border', 'being', 'hillarious', 'inspite', 'best', 'effort', 'Take', 'gem', 'Joker', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'things', 'forever', 'going', 'back', 'See', ""'re"", 'just', 'freak', 'Yeah', 'can', 'really', 'imagine', 'psychopathic', 'lunatic', 'uttering', 'such', 'nonsense', 'type', 'analysis', 'expect', 'vapid', 'Freud', 'wannabe', 'Even', 'giving', 'Joker', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'symbolic', 'character', 'bit', 'much.How', 'precious', 'line', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'either', 'die', 'hero', 'live', 'long', 'enough', 'see', 'become', 'villain.', 'Wow', 'less', 'meaningfull', 'roasting', 'marshmallow', 'bathtub', 'lot', 'more', 'irritating', 'fact', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'story', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'rubbing', 'sandpaper', 'forehead', 'Sadly', 'are', 'supposed', 'think', 'hero', 'Unfortunately', 'Victor', 'Lanslow', 'Casablanca', 'despise', 'white', 'knight', 'do-goodery.Aside', 'margarine', 'sticks', 'called', 'dialogue', 'themes', 'explored', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'seem', 'were', 'written', 'down', 'post', 'note', 'sophomore', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'inhaled', 'too', 'much', 'hippie', 'lettuce', 'duality', 'people', 'collateral', 'damage', 'greed', 'fate', 'kinship', 'good', 'evil', 'so', 'aside', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Joker', 'trope', 'Al', 'Queda', 'are', 'less', 'subtle', 'linkages', 'Gotham', 'post', '9-11', 'New', 'York', 'semi-intelligent', 'audience', 'member', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'getting', 'talked', 'down', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'everything', 'spelled', 'out', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'so', 'Coppolaesque', 'was', 'entertained', 'large', 'swaths', 'movie', 'found', 'repeating', 'one', 'Joker', 'lines', 'Why', '..so', 'serious']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

I rate this in my top 5 movies of all time and I usually don't enjoy superhero movies as much. Once I heard everyone talking about how good this movie was I knew I had to see it. Even though the economy is terrible I still payed to see this movie twice that's how good this movie is. Christian Bale is awesome in the roll of batman but no one beats Heath Leger in the role of the joker. To me it was a tragedy that he died but for some reason he died making the best movie he ever made. There is just nonstop action here in this movie right from the beginning which I always didn't get that feel in the other batman movies. You got a feel that people were hoping the Joker was going to kill Batman because of how well the character was played. Batman got repetitive in the late 90's but after taking so many years off this was the perfect time to come back and it was refreshing. This movie is long but it doesn't seem like it is dragging on like some movies do. It was so surprising and you didn't know what was going to happen next. A great story line and I know the director is going to have a hard time topping this movie. With the greatest grossing movie money wise worldwide how could you not pick this DVD up?

659133,AVAHA06K08ZKK,B00005JPY0,Alwyn Lau,"[3, 12]","The Dark Knight, like many of Christopher Nolan's movies, is predicated on lies. The movie depicts a world which needs to be lied to, a society which cannot face a full-blown encounter with the truth. Hence, the hero - Batman himself - embodies deception in its purest. He has a secret identity known to less than a handful of people. The secret identity itself is based on people's uncanny fear of bats i.e. of a mammal with wings often used to cloak itself. Yet it's not simply that Batman has to maintain a lie. In order to save society, the District Attorney Harvey Dent had to pretend he was Batman; Dent had to lie to the city in order to save the city itself. In the end, of course, Batman returned the favour by willingly taking on the role as baddie, as Dent's killer, in order that the city would have a hero to celebrate. Dent (a good guy turned bad) was venerated and Batman (a great guy turned bat) was vilified - this was the solution the city had to be fed.The `Dark Knight', thus, refers to the falsely incriminated hero who takes on the sins of the real criminals so the city could continue life as normal believing in lies.The arch-villain, the Joker, on the other hand, is all about truth. He sought to expose the truth of Batman's identity, of love and dilemmas (was Rachel Dawes more worth saving than Harvey Dent?), of the superficiality of noble intentions (could a public figure/hero turn bad over the death of a loved one?), of human self-centeredness (could a group of people willingly blow up another group to save themselves?) and, most critically, the truth of what it takes for society to police itself. Towards the movie's end, Batman realized that the only way to apprehend the Joker was to rely on mass surveillance, effectively ending the privacy of Gotham's inhabitants. That is the price and the ground of peace - an exceptional act which takes the form of violence.Nolan also presents a stark and awkward contrast between the candor of evil and the superficiality of the good. The Joker never takes anything personally - perfect candidate for Prime Minister? Batman takes justice too personally - perfect example of a political whiner? The Joker uses anarchy to expose the lies the people tell themselves (of goodness, of heroes, etc.). Batman uses and perpetuates a lie - himself! - so people can continue believing in the illusory motifs of hope and justice. Batman wears a mask and disguises his voice. The Joker wears make-up, which is to say that he turns his face into a mask - i.e. the Joker becomes the mask he wears which is about as close to the truth as anybody can get (simply reflect on how many personalities we `put on' in our everyday dealings; the Joker, really, has only one face and is entirely transparent) - and doesn't bother faking his voice.Could the painful message of the movie therefore be that, in a world as messed up as ours, we often yearn to be lied to almost as desperately as we yearn for justice? Are we totally equipped to handle transparency and truth?When politics and power are concerned, we must reflect on the possibility that truth is something that must be discarded at times without which chaos would reign. Political governance is inseparable from the sacrifice of truth, the betrayal of heroes and the elevation of falsehood.

With the exception of a few, the same actors also reprise their roles from the last picture, with the main exception of Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, who is easily as beguiling as Katie Holmes last time in the same role.The movie is fast paced, with some necessary pauses for dramatic buildup but moves fairly steadily over the almost 2 hour run time, the gadgets get a little better but still remain vaguely believable as do Batman's abilities, in fact this time we actually see a few chinks in the armor.The support cast are excellent, particularly Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, and Bale is suitably beefed but suave and almost arrogant as our hero. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two Face is a nice distraction, but his place in the movie could arguably been trimmed or even sidelined for the next movie, and ultimately makes this picture unnecessarily overfilled with diverging storylines.But make no mistake, the movie belongs to Ledger, and at times it seems that every one else is simply along for the ride. Within the storyline you find yourself suspending disbelief quite readily as The Joker goes on his one man demolition job, without conscience or care, bringing a real edge to his characters deviant sociopathy.It's difficult not to compare Nicholson and Ledgers performances side by side, but on close scrutiny where the former had some of the quirky likeability and almost lovable psychosis (reminiscent even of Cesar Romero in the camp TV show), Ledger is firmly grounded and oozes malevolence, when you laugh, it's usually nervous laughter as the character is dangerously unpredictable.On the positive side the movie has plenty of action, good CGI and bone crunching fight scenes and gadgets, which should please the most ardent fan of the movie genre. It also has enough depth to keep the more discerning viewers interest.On the negative, too long, and I mean TOO long, nothing would have been lost had this movie been shaved by at least 25 minutes, and even moved to the next movie (for which I hear Bale is contracted to make). Testament to this is the fact that as the viewer you expect to have seen the end credits roll, on at least 4 occasions before they actually do. Also as mentioned earlier Nolan has tried to cram too many plotlines and individual character embellishments together and it gets a bit messy.Those minor complaints aside, this IS a good movie, and worth seeing for Ledgers performance alone, a powerhouse performance of character acting that will I'm sure be a strong, but strange epitaph to a tragic loss of talent.",4,Ledger Shines in Nolan's Sharp Sequel,1228953600,"12 11, 2008",2008,3381,"['So', 'Batman', 'back', 'time', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'more', 'shadow', 'more', 'danger', 'more', 'menacing', 'etc', 'etc', 'One', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'asking', 'things', 'amidst', 'morass', 'versions', 'popular', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'years', 'particularly', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'visionary', 'remake', 'back', '1989', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Joker.Now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'cave', 'somewhere', 'will', 'no', 'doubt', 'have', 'caught', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'particularly', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'psychotic', 'perennial', 'smile', 'wearing', 'criminal', 'so', 'bittersweet', 'untimely', 'death.Chris', 'Nolan', 'valiant', 'effort', 'here', 'follow', 'up', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'staying', 'same', 'characters', 'building', 'continuing', 'darker', 'side', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'crime', 'fighting', 'alter', 'ego', 'exception', 'few', 'same', 'actors', 'also', 'reprise', 'roles', 'last', 'picture', 'main', 'exception', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'who', 'easily', 'as', 'beguiling', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'last', 'time', 'same', 'role.The', 'movie', 'fast', 'paced', 'necessary', 'pauses', 'dramatic', 'buildup', 'fairly', 'steadily', 'almost', '2', 'hour', 'run', 'time', 'gadgets', 'get', 'little', 'better', 'still', 'remain', 'vaguely', 'believable', 'do', 'Batman', 'abilities', 'fact', 'time', 'actually', 'see', 'few', 'chinks', 'armor.The', 'support', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Bale', 'suitably', 'beefed', 'suave', 'almost', 'arrogant', 'hero', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Harvey', 'Dent', '/', 'Two', 'Face', 'nice', 'distraction', 'place', 'movie', 'could', 'arguably', 'been', 'trimmed', 'even', 'sidelined', 'next', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'picture', 'unnecessarily', 'overfilled', 'diverging', 'storylines.But', 'make', 'mistake', 'movie', 'Ledger', 'times', 'one', 'else', 'simply', 'along', 'ride', 'storyline', 'find', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'quite', 'readily', 'Joker', 'one', 'man', 'demolition', 'job', 'conscience', 'care', 'bringing', 'real', 'edge', 'characters', 'deviant', 'sociopathy.It', 'difficult', 'not', 'compare', 'Nicholson', 'Ledgers', 'performances', 'side', 'side', 'close', 'scrutiny', 'where', 'former', 'had', 'quirky', 'likeability', 'almost', 'lovable', 'psychosis', 'reminiscent', 'even', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'camp', 'TV', 'show', 'Ledger', 'firmly', 'grounded', 'oozes', 'malevolence', 'when', 'laugh', 'usually', 'nervous', 'laughter', 'character', 'dangerously', 'unpredictable.On', 'positive', 'side', 'movie', 'plenty', 'action', 'good', 'CGI', 'bone', 'crunching', 'fight', 'scenes', 'gadgets', 'should', 'please', 'most', 'ardent', 'fan', 'movie', 'genre', 'also', 'enough', 'depth', 'keep', 'more', 'discerning', 'viewers', 'interest.On', 'negative', 'too', 'long', 'mean', 'TOO', 'long', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'had', 'movie', 'been', 'shaved', 'least', '25', 'minutes', 'even', 'moved', 'next', 'movie', 'hear', 'Bale', 'contracted', 'make', 'Testament', 'fact', 'viewer', 'expect', 'have', 'seen', 'end', 'roll', 'least', '4', 'occasions', 'actually', 'do', 'Also', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Nolan', 'tried', 'cram', 'too', 'many', 'plotlines', 'individual', 'character', 'embellishments', 'together', 'bit', 'messy.Those', 'minor', 'complaints', 'aside', 'good', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Ledgers', 'performance', 'alone', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'character', 'acting', 'will', ""'m"", 'sure', 'be', 'strong', 'strange', 'epitaph', 'tragic', 'loss', 'talent']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

The main plotline is Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) having to deal with the fact that his persona as Batman has inspired many new acts of criminality -- both seemingly good and extremely bad. Yes, Rachel Dawes is back too. Only instead of Katie Holmes, we now get Maggie Gyllenhaal. I was one of those few when the first film came out that didn't think Holmes' performance was all that bad, but, after seeing Gyllenhaal in this, I now realize how -- although not that bad -- truly stiff Holmes' performance was. And, much to Bruce's chagrin, Rachel's love interest is no other than the compassionate, idealistic District Attorney Harvey Dent (with a performance by Aaron Eckhart that may be the best of his career to date). Of course, Bruce has to deal with this relationship as well (continuing their relationship fromBatman Begins (Limited Edition Gift Set)), all the while dealing with the newest criminal to grace Gotham's streets -- an anarchistic criminal who simply ""wants to watch the world burn"" and calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger). And the complicated relationship between Gordon, Dent and Batman (another comic book staple) is explored with great writing (again, taking a cue from their relationship inBatman: The Long Halloween.Now, let me just take this time to say that I'm definitely not one of those people who believes much in an actor or actress receiving awards just because they've passed away or because they're so old and the academies believe they'll be passing away soon (Yes, Martin Landau, for his performance in ""Ed Wood,"" I'm directing that statement at him; his performance in that film didn't even come close to Morgan Freeman's in ""The Shawshank Redemption""). However, regardless of Ledger's living status, I can truly say that he deserves an Academy Award for Supporting Actor nomination for his turn as The Joker, dead or alive. He is that good! Of course, being The Joker, he does have a few funny one-liners, however, unlike Jack Nicholson's Joker, Ledger's lines are so creepily delivered that you're not sure whether you want to, or should, laugh. And the complex relationship between The Joker and Batman -- one not being able to exist without the other -- that is a constant in the comics even to this day is added into the movie, which I was delighted about. Also, Ledger's Joker is always one step ahead of Gotham's police and Batman that he makes the perfect formidable foe that us fans know from the comics.Gary Oldman is also back as Lieutenant Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox; and all have good screentime and give great performances. Also, for those fans wondering, Cillian Murphy is also back for a brief cameo as The Scarecrow. The performances are all excellent but the true accolades should go to the writers, brothers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan, and David S. Goyer. They wrote what a Batman movie should be and perfectly showcase why all of us fans love Batman in the first place: the dark, gritty realism peppered with hope and lots of cool gadgets. The fact that director Christopher Nolan has finally brought the cool respect that was lost by his predecessors back to the Batman franchise is superb! The action is plentiful but doesn't take away from the drama that is also needed for a film of this caliber.I likedIron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)a lot, but The Dark Knight blows it and every other comic book-movie adaptation out of the water! I can only hope that there are more Batman movies planned for Nolan and crew, especially after all the money they've raked in (they broke the record for a midnight opening with $18.6 million, and that's not including any other showings; just the midnight ones)! Whether you're a comic book fan or not, I would recommend this movie! It's probably the best summer blockbuster I've seen in years! Immediately after seeing it, I wanted to see it again and felt bummed out that I couldn't. I won't write any more about the storylines or surprises in store as that would rob you of the full effect of the movie's greatness. Don't read any more into it. Just go see it and soak in the experience for yourself.",5,I'd give this 10 stars if I could - THE BEST comic book adaption movie EVER!!!,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,5305,"['Anyone', 'who', 'how',

Much bigger and more impressive than the previous film ""Batman Begins.""*Still an excellent filming style.*Production design is excellent still (the BatPod was cool).*Storyline is extremely intense! From start to finish, it's one big thing after another.  A vast number of twists and turns puts the audience on a truly turbulent emotional roller-coaster ride (it's almost too cruel!).*Characters continue to shine with complexity.  The film explores more intruiging issues with Batman's character.  As you've probably already heard, the Joker was downright awesome; he ranged from being funny to dramatic, but was always sadistic and wicked.  Harvey Dent (Two-Face) was a good serious character too.*Good music (but not as memorable as the last film).The Bad Things*Sorry for the spoilers, but the ending is quite bleak.  Rachel is dead, Batman becomes public enemy number one, Lucious Fox resigns...(but this could all be a good set-up for another movie).The Questionable Things*Much more violent than ever before.  It's more intense this way, but also much bleaker.*Choppy filming/editing still makes the fight scenes a little hard to see (but it's stylish and intense, too).*The storyline doesn't deal with any megalomaniac plots like all of the other Batman films (like in the last film, where the bad guys wanted to make everybody crazy and let the city destroy itself); this one is almost entirely about city politics and rampant crime/terrorism.  It's more believable and interesting this way, but I kind of miss the old-fashioned schemes.It's darker, bigger, more intense, more exciting, and more ambitious than ""Batman Begins."" It almost outdoes itself (and some people think it has).  But it still retains the same style and characterizations of the previous film, and therefore, is still a deep, complex, moving film.

659149,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00005JPY0,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[1, 2]","suffers the same sort of crap given to the 2-disc special editions of ""I Am Legend"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"".  There are only two documentaries, not even 30 minutes in total.  The most intriguing one for me was one devoted solely to Hans Zimmer's composition of ""Why So Serious?"", the nine minute Nine Inch Nails-like song, ""anthem"" or ""theme"" for the Joker.  The other is an entertaining look more at the physical aspects of the costumes and the Batpod and such.There's absolutely no insight into the making of the movie, the sort of things Heath Ledger went through to get into the role of the Joker, a memorial for Heath Ledger, designing such things as the Joker's face and Harvey Dent's ""Two-Face"" face.  I would have loved to see a documentary devoted solely to designing Two-Face's injury, and the complexities that would have been involved in getting the CG eye to move with Eckhart's real eye flawlessly.No deleted scenes either, and I already felt that we didn't get anywhere near enough of the Joker already.A questionable addition is the inclusion of several movie scenes and sequences filmed in Imax format included on the DVD.  From my view, the only difference in Imax is that its resolution is apparently far more gigantic than normal DVD.  Unfortunately for me, I don't own a gigantic screen, and I usually don't watch it on screens larger than 20 inches, so this is a useless addition for me.I don't yet throw this into the ""waste of money, eff you studio"" category yet because it does include six episodes of ""Gotham Tonight"" fictional news segments on the movie.  They don't seem too boring, but all together it seems like it would be enough content to spare a second disc to include.However, in totality (made up word?  Maybe), this ""special"" edition is not very ""special"", and gives us no insight into the film or its production beyond the two documentaries listed.  There's not even director commentary, a heavy disappointment for me after the great commentary track Christopher Nolan did for ""Memento"".I already reviewed this movie (under the DVD version) but I must review the Blu Ray specs:The picture quality is indeed an immense improvement, to a degree that I wonder if they intentionally ""sabotaged"" the DVD's picture quality just to get people to buy the Blu Ray.The Blu Ray is immediately a superior choice due to extra features not included in the DVD version.The video does indeed switch from 2:4:1 to 1:78:1 at random intervals (as in some of the widescreen shots fill the entire screen of a widescreen TV, whereas others widen it further so as to leave black bars).  This is the result of some scenes being Imax included into the full film.  This is in no way as distracting as you would think.Most important to recognize: This Blu Ray version does not have a main menu.  Nuh uh, uh huh, nope.  There is no main menu.  It starts the movie immediately.  I don't know about most Blu Ray players, but mine has a ""Pop-up Menu"" button, so I can use that.  It has a pop-up menu you bring up during the movie (though you can pause the movie from the menu) to access special features or other scenes or audio controls.Final comparison:The DVD is definitely better suited for the more ""stable"" viewing, in that it has a main menu to go to and access everything directly, and the screen's resolution stays the same size all throughout.The Blu Ray is definitely better suited for higher picture quality, though it could certainly jar some people with the constant switches from the two variations on widescreen.  The special features are the same as in the DVD version, and have a bonus documentary and bonus features via BD Live.",5,"Movie is instant classic, but 2-disc special edition...",1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,3678,"['suffers', 'same', 'sort', 'crap', 'given', '2-disc', 'special', 'editions', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'documentaries', 'not', 'even', '30', 'minutes', 'total', 'most', 'intriguing', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'devoted', 'solely', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'composition', 'Why', 'So', 'Serious', 'nine', 'minute', 'Nine', 'Inch', 'Nails-like', 'song', 'anthem', 'theme', 'Joker', 'other', 'entertaining', 'look', 'more', 'physical', 'aspects', 'costumes', 'Batpod', 'absolutely', 'insight', 'making', 'movie', 'sort', 'things', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'went', 'get', 'role', 'Joker', 'memorial', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'designing', 'such', 'things', 'Joker', 'face', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Two-Face', 'face', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'documentary', 'devoted', 'solely', 'designing', 'Two-Face', 'injury', 'complexities', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'getting', 'CG', 'eye', 'move', 'Eckhart', 'real', 'eye', 'flawlessly.No', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'already', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'anywhere', 'enough', 'Joker', 'already.A', 'questionable', 'addition', 'inclusion', 'several', 'movie', 'scenes', 'sequences', 'filmed', 'Imax', 'format', 'included', 'DVD', 'view', 'only', 'difference', 'Imax', 'resolution', 'apparently', 'far', 'more', 'gigantic', 'normal', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'gigantic', 'screen', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'screens', 'larger', '20', 'inches', 'useless', 'addition', 'me.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'throw', 'waste', 'money', 'eff', 'studio', 'category', 'yet', 'include', 'six', 'episodes', 'Gotham', 'Tonight', 'fictional', 'news', 'segments', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'boring', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'content', 'spare', 'second', 'disc', 'include.However', 'totality', 'made', 'up', 'word', 'Maybe', 'special', 'edition', 'not', 'very', 'special', 'insight', 'film', 'production', 'two', 'documentaries', 'listed', 'not', 'even', 'director', 'commentary', 'heavy', 'disappointment', 'great', 'commentary', 'track', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'did', 'Memento', '.I', 'already', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'DVD', 'version', 'must', 'review', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'specs', 'picture', 'quality', 'indeed', 'immense', 'improvement', 'degree', 'wonder', 'intentionally', 'sabotaged', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'just', 'get', 'people', 'buy', 'Blu', 'Ray.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'immediately', 'superior', 'choice', 'due', 'extra', 'features', 'not', 'included', 'DVD', 'version.The', 'video', 'indeed', 'switch', '2:4:1', '1:78:1', 'random', 'intervals', 'widescreen', 'shots', 'fill', 'entire', 'screen', 'widescreen', 'TV', 'others', 'widen', 'further', 'so', 'leave', 'black', 'bars', 'result', 'scenes', 'being', 'Imax', 'included', 'full', 'film', 'way', 'as', 'distracting', 'would', 'think.Most', 'important', 'recognize', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'not', 'have', 'main', 'menu', 'Nuh', 'uh', 'uh', 'huh', 'nope', 'main', 'menu', 'movie', 'immediately', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'most', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'players', 'mine', 'Pop-up', 'Menu', 'button', 'can', 'use', 'pop-up', 'menu', 'bring', 'up', 'movie', 'can', 'pause', 'movie', 'menu', 'access', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'scenes', 'audio', 'controls.Final', 'comparison', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'better', 'suited', 'more', 'stable', 'viewing', 'main', 'menu', 'go', 'access', 'everything', 'directly', 'screen', 'resolution', 'same', 'size', 'throughout.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'definitely', 'better', 'suited', 'higher', 'picture', 'quality', 'could', 'certainly', 'jar', 'people', 'constant', 'switches', 'two', 'variations', 'widescreen', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'same', 'DVD', 'version', 'have', 'bonus', 'documentary', 'bonus', 'features', 'BD', 'Live']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

The initial public response seemed to be very positive and the trailers that I saw of Heath Ledger as the Joker looked tremendous.  It's a pity that it didn't live up to expectations.""The Dark Knight"" is very different from other Batman films.  It is certainly darker and even more violent that its predecessors.  This is a plus.  In fact, Heath Ledger's Joker is far removed from the high camp earlier versions of Jack Nicholson and Caesar Romero.  This time the character has some depth and fear.  The Joker is a psychopath rather than a pure comic strip side show.As to the rest of the film, ""The Dark Knight"" is grossly over-rated.  Yes, I know that we need to take the plot with a grain of salt.  But, really, the plot ventures into the absurd.  I'm sure it appeals to a teenage audience.  However, as an adult, I found my credulity being strained to snapping point.  To be frank, I was glad when the film ended and the lights in the cinema came on.So, if you're a Batman aficionado, you'll probably find this film in the top of its class.

I think it's hard with a film like `The Dark Knight' because if you don't review it carefully then it may come across like just another superhero movie, and with `The Dark Knight', the film that has been hailed as the best superhero movie of all time you have to be able to relay that to the reader, prove to them that this is more than just an action film; that there is real stock in the claims that this is the `Godfather' of all superhero films.True, not everyone will feel the same way, but I feel an obligation to explain to you why I feel the way that I do.First I want to implore you, if you have not already, to watch `Batman Begins' before watching `The Dark Knight'.  The two are truly companion pieces and you will not be able to appreciate the full progression of character (especially within Bruce Wayne) that Nolan and Bale have created unless you first witness how it all began.  Sure, it is not necessary to see the first film in order to enjoy this film for the action/genre film that it is, but it helps you to see just how this film transcends the boundaries of its genre if you see it from the very beginning.What sets `The Dark Knight' apart from every other superhero film, and really any other genre film, is that if you strip away the costumes you still have a film.  This is not a movie about a superhero; this is a movie that contains a superhero.  This is a movie about the realities of destiny, our choices, our weaknesses, our loyalties and our failures.  It broaches those very human and very controversial subjects with an intelligence that is not often seen in a film of this nature.  I think that sadly too many critics of this film look at it as a superhero movie, and so they immediately shrug it off as nothing more, but if they were to search deeper into the root of this film they would see that this is far more than just another Hollywood Blockbuster.The film follows Bruce Wayne as he struggles to find a balance between his personal life (which he feels is leaving him) and his life as Batman, which is becoming more and more necessary as Gotham City becomes the target of a madman known as The Joker.  While the film follows a carefully crafted storyline of doublecrossment with The Joker offering Gotham's mob bosses a chance to keep their money and rid themselves of the Batman, the real story is all wrapped up in the conflicting sides of good and evil that manifest themselves in the characters that appear on the screen.  Everyone from Wayne to Joker to Gotham's new district attorney Harvey Dent are susceptible to this emotional corruption, and they all have different ways of dealing with that particular crisis.  The Joker introduces a new kind of madness to Gotham, a madness that knows no boundaries, and this proposes a question of ethics and morals within those who have to deal with this monster.The fact remains that the emotional punches this film throws your way are not those of your typical superhero movie; for they are far too real.The masterful performances by the cast only help elevate this film, added more layers of realism to the madness.  Bale reprises his role as Wayne and he does so with powerful conviction, especially as the film draws to a close and his own moral stance is jeopardized by his emotions.  I still haven't gotten used to the Batman voice, but his Wayne is by far the best Wayne ever displayed on screen; for he infuses Bruce with a humanity that has not been seen before.  Gary Oldman also returns as police lieutenant Gordon and this time raises the bar by inserting raw despair as the city falls to pieces around him.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also reprise their roles for this sequel and continue to astound, delivering significant aid to Wayne's personal transformation.  Newcomers include Maggie Gyllenhaal (who replaced Katie Holmes), Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger.  Gyllenhaal is a force here, never slinking into the background as did Holmes but making the character of Rachel front and center, providing the film the moral counterbalance to The Joker's influence.  Eckhart is magnificent as Dent, downplaying his own charms to give his character a sense of insecurity that only comes with the job.  Matched against Bale he is the perfect compliment to Wayne's insecurities masked over by an abundance of faux charm.But we all know that this movie is all about the late, great, Heath Ledger.  Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is a far cry from Nicholson's (we all know how I feel about that one).  Instead of portraying the fiend as a joke, Ledger sunk down into the darkness that corroded this mans sanity, and the result was an iconic look at the evils that exist in us all.  The Joker is an exaggerated look at the conflict wrestling in our own subconscious; the battle between good and bad that we all must struggle to win over.  Ledger manages to capture that without ever making it a mockery.I will not be one to say that this film has no weaknesses.  I feel that the film is a tad too long, I will give you that; and I was a little upset over the way the Two-Face character was give such little true treatment.  It could have easily worked itself into the third film, for the squeezing in of the character at the last minute seemed a tad rushed.That's it though.  I have no other complaints.The fact remains that `The Dark Knight' is a masterpiece.  It is a film that transcends the boundaries of genre and proves that you don't have to be a typical Oscar bait film to deliver a message.  Think back over the years of Oscar to the last time a superhero movie has garnered this much buzz and attention.I'm waiting.Nothing?Didn't think so.You see, `The Dark Knight' is unlike any other genre film out there.  Nolan and company have taken all that you think you know and turned it on its head.  The message within `The Dark Knight' is a bleak one, but it is given a glimmer of hope that we all do well to contemplate.  Yes, the world is a dark and dangerous place, but we have the opportunity to make the right choices regardless of how we are being conditioned.  We can stand up for what is right and fight the darkness that encircles us.  We can all be a superhero of sorts, for we all have the power of free choice.",5,This is so much more than your typical superhero movie...,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,6352,"[""'ve"", 'been',

People talked about how great it was, and I'll say it made me a bit skeptical about 'The Dark Knight.'About that, I have laughed at myself regularly since it opened.Without a shadow of a doubt, 'Knight' is one of the best movies in the history of film. Every time I think of what was my favorite scene, or my favorite line, I suddenly think of something else that was just as good or better. I cannot think of a movie that I have seen before that every single aspect makes me realize how much I want to see it again. Christopher Nolan has proved himself one of the best film directors and writers out there. The movie was tragic, funny and tense, almost all at the same time, but one could never question whether it flowed together as one, cohesive piece of story-telling.However, despite excellent performances from Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman, despite superb special effects and fights, in spite of an excellent screenplay...despite all these things...it is the performance of Heath Ledger that is the best aspect of the film. I had heard speculation that Oscar talks were merely sympathy because of Ledger's death, but those talks are certainly doing him a sad disservice. His performance is worthy of any award they can give him. The Joker truly is the ultimate villain, and Ledger made it that way.

When I thought that it couldnt get better then Batman Begins, I couldnt be more wrong. The only problem I had with the movie was the Rachel Dawes character played by Maggie Glynehall. They should have brought back Katie Holmes or they should have hired somebody a little better and younger looking then Maggie. This film is first rate Christopher Nolan has outdone himself again. If you really look closely at the film you will notice the paralell with our government. Sometimes as good guys you have to cross the lines just a little to get the bad guys. Remember the part when Bruce uses all the civillian cell phones as a giant sonar to locate the Joker? It reminds me of the Patriot Act that so many malcontent liberals are so against. I mean come on lets get real, most of us have no problem discussing in detail our personal lives so loud in front of other people in public locations with our cell phones, yet we are so worried about the government tapping terorist lines. If you are not a terrorist you should have nothing to worry about. The comparasions between Batman and President Bush are amazing. Batman has taken matters in his own hands by taking it to the criminals the same way Bush is taking it to the Terrorist, at the same time being villianized, despised, mocked and just about hated by the public. Sooner or later probably when he is dead we are going to give Bush our respect and gratitude for doing his best to keep us safe while sacrificing his public image and legacy. The same goes for Bruce Wayne. I hope the next installment of this franchise is even better yet. Johnny Depp can take over as the Joker and he can be as good if not better then Heath Ledger, remember the Joker is always in make up. They can make Depp look just like Heath, and Johnny will have no problem with the voice and persona. I hope they bring back the Penguin, Bob Hoskins will make a great Penguin. Dont you think?

I mean, what happened? Did you get your act together and deliver us one of the best bat-flicks ever?Seems so.And now you've done it again . . . times ten!Batman has made a difference in Gotham. Criminals are running scared. Underworld organizations are toppling. He has indeed become the symbol he set out to be.Now a psychotic clown-faced criminal is tearing his way through the Gotham City underworld, quickly establishing himself as the Clown Prince of Crime. His method: death, and lots of it. His motive: madness. But is he crazy? As he would say, ""I'm not. No, I'm not."" And he's right. He's not crazy. This man--this ""Joker""--is brilliant, and if he gets his way, Gotham will fall into his hands.Unless Batman can stop him.The Joker's reign of terror starts in the underworld but reaches deep into Gotham's social structure, various men strategically placed throughout the police, mayoral offices, everywhere. And they listen to him. Except for Gotham's White Knight, Harvey Dent, the do-gooding District Attorney who's dedicated himself to cleaning up Gotham and taking down the crime syndicates that have oppressed it for so long.Death reigns supreme in this movie. People die, and Batman is faced with the hard choice of becoming that which he hates . . . or risk losing Gotham and those he loves to this madman.I cannot say enough good things about this movie. Going into this thing back in 2008, and despite the crazy good trailers for The Dark Knight, I wasn't sure if Batman Begins could be beat or even tied. Batman Begins was what put serious superhero flicks back on the map in a big, big way. It was what restored the faith of us fans in DC Comics and gave us hope that they'd start the journey to taking down their number one competitor at the box office, Marvel. And with Superman Returns being just plain poopy, I hoped against hope they'd at least get Batman right a second time.And they did. They so did and me and everyone in that theatre were gushing with joy that not only was The Dark Knight as good as Batman Begins, it was even better.Christian Bale delivered another solid performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman. The new suit rocked hard. Loved the detail. Though he was less buff than the previous film--why? who knows? You'd think a crimefighter would maintain a fitness regime--he did a great job differentiating between the boring and dull playboy Bruce Wayne and the rage-filled-justice-driven Batman. My only issue was the voice. In Batman Begins, it was gruff, cool and tough. In this one, he sounded like he was growling the whole time and he had to force the words out to make them all gravelly. (And, FYI, WB, Batman's voice doesn't have to be like he's talking through pebbles and sand; Kevin Conroy proved that.)Heath Ledger's Joker was utterly amazing. Creepy. Gothic. Funny, but not comical (like Jack Nicholson's was). Eerie, disturbed, crazy--delicious. What I loved the most was two things 1) the clown make up was just that: make up. At first I didn't like this idea and wanted the Joker to have been a victim of an acid bath ala his comics backstory, but after watching the movie, I see why they went this route. Bringing us to 2) Joker was a genius. It was his brilliant criminal mind that enabled him to quickly establish himself as a powerful evil force in Gotham and the make up was his edge in doing that both in a scary-because-I'm-crazy way, but also it made others think he was merely a lunatic in turn making them drop their guard so he could move in.Once more, I really dug Gary Oldman's James Gordon and seeing him officially become commissioner in this was cool.Likewise Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and, eventually, Two-Face--hey, he did a good job on both sides of the, um, coin. My only thing with Two-Face in this flick was that I wasn't expecting him to show up. I thought this movie would establish the Harvey Dent character in turn setting him up to become Two-Face in the next one. So, yeah, that part was a bit rushed but them's the breaks.I enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes. Maggie's kind and cute, but can be rough and touch when she needs to. Worked well for Bruce's childhood friend/love interest, especially when that twist came that changed Rachel's future forever.My only other little quibble was the whole bat-sonar thing. That was venturing into Batman Forever territory and we all know how that one turned out, but the positives of this movie more than make up for the couple of minor issues I had with it.This movie is just tremendously good. Good fighting. Good story. Good stuff.Very recommended.A.P.

Sadly, Heath Ledger died less then a month after the first preview aired. The story is very good but it feels like they are trying to fit two films into one; I dont know if it was Ledger's death that caused them to change the way the film ended up. When The Joker shows up, he steals the scene and I was on the edge of my seat everytime he appeared. The movie kind of forgets the Joker towards the end of the film and focuses on Harvey Dent/Two-Face's role. The ending was pretty weak; What happened to the Joker? It just cuts him off with knowning what happened to him. I know they may have cut it out due to Ledger's death, if it was intended to go in anther direction. All in all, its still an excellent film.

659171,A32Y55Z00QI12S,B00005JPY0,ARK,"[35, 44]","I loved Batman Begins. It was fun, with wonderful characterization, cool Bat gadgets, and fun bad guys. A thrilling run from start to finish, and most certainly a movie I hope to someday own. So, needless to say, I couldn't wait to see The Dark Knight.I quickly discovered that The Dark Knight does not have the same spirit as Batman Begins. It is not a fun movie; it is a dark, ""heavy"" movie. Heavy themes, heavy thoughts, enough depth to drown in, carried by excellent actors and sharp dialogue and deep ethical questions. That's great. I usually look forward to movies like this -- movies coupling art with entertainment, one of the highest callings entertainment can aspire to and one of the hardest to achieve.That said, this is the only movie that I could not say simply, ""I liked it"" or ""I hated it"" after watching it. I simply felt drained after watching it, like I had just sprinted down a steep road for 2 1/2 hours and hit a wall face-first at the bottom. I thought that perhaps after a few days I'd figure out whether it was my thing or not. At the end, no. It's not my kind of movie. I must add one thought to this: I could also not say it's a bad movie by any means. In fact, in some ways, rating it below 5 stars is a crime.There's great acting here by everyone, even secondary and tertiary characters. Batman does have some unintentionally humorous moments with his rasping, slurring ""bat-voice"" -- sometimes you can't tell what he says, and it borders on over-acting -- but overall, he does a fine job. The Joker is downright perfect (perhaps a little too perfect) -- a character you'll love to hate.The characters are great, the plot is excellently crafted, and the dialogue is great. It's not just solid, it's a masterpiece.But do not be fooled by the title of this movie. This is the Joker's film from beginning to end. In fact, that's my main complaint. Where's Batman? Why is everyone so powerless in Joker's schemes? Why is Batman such a failure? Joker is a psychic; everything goes according to his plans, and I mean everything. He foresees every movement, every feint, and every plot. After a while, this gets very, very silly. As another reviewer so aptly stated, when he DOES get proven wrong, it seems more contrived than anything else -- merely a way to end the movie. The Joker gets more screen time than anyone else; Batman and all the other champions of Gotham City fail time and time again before his onslaught.Because of this constant struggle, with the ""good side"" never giving up and often so close to victory, the tension never drops for a second. Every moment the Joker is alive is a moment you can't relax. It's like a nightmare that never ends -- every time you think there will be a moment of brightness, the Joker backhands it and everything falls black again. It's tiresome. No, you can't stop watching it, but it's terribly draining and depressing.Harvey Dent is another con for me. He is Two-Face for such a short time that he doesn't deserve the moniker. That wasn't Two-Face; that was just a scarred up guy who killed, what, two people? Not scary, not very impressive, not worth a ""super villain"" title.Pacing is yet another con for me. As I stated before, it is constant, draining tension from start to finish. There's not a single moment of reprieve, not one -- false starts, sometimes, but never truly a moment to breathe. And there's almost never a positive moment to be had!In the end, this isn't entertainment. This is an experience and an exploration of the natures of good and evil. What I wanted, and thought I was going to see, was a fun ride with an uplifting end; what I received was a riveting, dark thriller that essentially states that evil is all-pervasive and nigh insurmountable. Even with the Joker captured, one has the sensation that he has won anyway -- every second he is alive, he wins. Indeed, according to The Dark Knight, there is no good -- only different kinds and different ""strengths"" of evil.In the end, The Dark Knight just not my kind of thing -- not for its lack of quality, and not because I deny the fact that ""evil's"" successes are more prevalent than ""good's"" -- but because I go to the movies to see evil smacked in the head at the end. I want to see something work for once. I want to see good triumph; I want to think there IS such a thing as good. I wanted Batman to win completely, without question.This is certainly no feel good movie; it has most certainly raised the bar for super-hero movies. There are more philosophical and ethical questions to ponder here than in many of the dullest art movies. However, I do hope that in the inevitable sequel, there are a few more bright points and positively charged thrills... and more of the Batman himself.",3,Where's Batman?,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,4744,"['loved', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'fun', 'wonderful', 'characterization', 'cool', 'Bat', 'gadgets', 'fun', 'bad', 'guys', 'thrilling', 'run', 'start', 'finish', 'most', 'certainly', 'movie', 'hope', 'someday', 'own', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Dark', 'Knight.I', 'quickly', 'discovered', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'spirit', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'not', 'fun', 'movie', 'dark', 'heavy', 'movie', 'Heavy', 'themes', 'heavy', 'thoughts', 'enough', 'depth', 'drown', 'carried', 'excellent', 'actors', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'deep', 'ethical', 'questions', 'great', 'usually', 'look', 'forward', 'movies', 'movies', 'coupling', 'art', 'entertainment', 'one', 'highest', 'callings', 'entertainment', 'can', 'aspire', 'one', 'hardest', 'said', 'only', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'say', 'simply', 'liked', 'hated', 'watching', 'simply', 'felt', 'drained', 'watching', 'had', 'just', 'sprinted', 'down', 'steep', 'road', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'hit', 'wall', 'face-first', 'bottom', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'few', 'days', ""'d"", 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'thing', 'not', 'end', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'must', 'add', 'one', 'thought', 'could', 'also', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'fact', 'ways', 'rating', '5', 'stars', 'crime.There', 'great', 'acting', 'here', 'everyone', 'even', 'secondary', 'tertiary', 'characters', 'Batman', 'have', 'unintentionally', 'humorous', 'moments', 'rasping', 'slurring', 'bat-voice', 'sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'over-acting', 'overall', 'fine', 'job', 'Joker', 'downright', 'perfect', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'character', ""'ll"", 'love', 'hate.The', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'plot', 'excellently', 'crafted', 'dialogue', 'great', 'not', 'just', 'solid', 'masterpiece.But', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'title', 'movie', 'Joker', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'fact', 'main', 'complaint', 'Where', 'Batman', 'Why', 'everyone', 'so', 'powerless', 'Joker', 'schemes', 'Why', 'Batman', 'failure', 'Joker', 'psychic', 'everything', 'according', 'plans', 'mean', 'everything', 'movement', 'feint', 'plot', 'while', 'very', 'very', 'silly', 'reviewer', 'so', 'aptly', 'stated', 'when', 'get', 'proven', 'wrong', 'more', 'contrived', 'anything', 'else', 'merely', 'way', 'end', 'movie', 'Joker', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'anyone', 'else', 'Batman', 'other', 'champions', 'Gotham', 'City', 'fail', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'onslaught.Because', 'constant', 'struggle', 'good', 'side', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'often', 'so', 'close', 'victory', 'tension', 'never', 'second', 'moment', 'Joker', 'alive', 'moment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relax', 'nightmare', 'never', 'time', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'moment', 'brightness', 'Joker', 'everything', 'falls', 'black', 'again', 'tiresome', 'No', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'terribly', 'draining', 'depressing.Harvey', 'Dent', 'con', 'Two-Face', 'such', 'short', 'time', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'moniker', 'was', ""n't"", 'Two-Face', 'was', 'just', 'scarred', 'up', 'guy', 'who', 'killed', 'what', 'two', 'people', 'Not', 'scary', 'not', 'very', 'impressive', 'not', 'super', 'villain', 'title.Pacing', 'yet', 'con', 'stated', 'constant', 'draining', 'tension', 'start', 'finish', 'not', 'single', 'moment', 'reprieve', 'not', 'one', 'false', 'starts', 'sometimes', 'never', 'truly', 'moment', 'breathe', 'almost', 'never', 'positive', 'moment', 'be', 'had', 'end', ""n't"", 'entertainment', 'experience', 'exploration', 'natures', 'good', 'evil', 'What', 'wanted', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'was', 'fun', 'ride', 'uplifting', 'end', 'what', 'received', 'was', 'riveting', 'dark', 'thriller', 'essentially', 'evil', 'all-pervasive', 'nigh', 'insurmountable', 'Even', 'Joker', 'captured', 'one', 'sensation', 'won', 'anyway', 'second', 'alive', 'Indeed', 'according', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'good', 'only', 'different', 'kinds', 'different', 'strengths', 'end', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'just', 'not', 'kind', 'thing', 'not', 'lack', 'quality', 'not', 'deny', 'fact', 'evil', 'successes', 'are', 'more', 'prevalent', 'good', 'go', 'movies', 'see', 'evil', 'smacked', 'head', 'end', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'work', 'once', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'triumph', 'want', 'think', 'IS', 'thing', 'good', 'wanted', 'Batman', 'win', 'completely', 'question.This', 'certainly', 'no', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'most', 'certainly', 'raised', 'bar', 'super-hero', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'philosophical', 'ethical', 'questions', 'ponder', 'here', 'many', 'dullest', 'art', 'movies', 'However', 'do', 'hope', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'bright', 'points', 'positively', 'charged', 'thrills', 'more', 'Batman']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659178,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B00005JPY0,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[4, 6]","The Dark Knight isn't your average superhero movie. It has little of the fantasy one often associates with such movies and instead creates an action thriller that has both your heart and mind racing to the finish. It's a movie that you have to watch several times to truly get everything out of. Everything is so thought-out and so intricate that a moment of unawareness from the viewer means they miss the connection later on. It's a smart film meant for smart people. While I quite miss the fantasy-aspect of previous Batman films (this even includes Batman Begins), this is undeniably a thrilling watch.Batman and Gordon attract the assistance of DA Harvey Dent to bring down the Gotham Mafia by cutting off their funds. Just as it looks like their plan is about to succeed, it's turned on itself by the mysterious Joker, an unhinged yet charismatic crook who single-handedly manages to push Gotham towards complete chaos, and Batman more and more towards the edge of the bad guy. Yet how to stop the Joker, when he's so unpredictable? Who will win? And at what cost?The first thing that jumps out at the viewer upon the start of the Dark Knight is how visually different it is from Batman Begins. No longer dark and claustrophobic, Nolan draws out the vastness of Gotham, perhaps emphasising the order that Batman has managed to inspire. Wide shots and open spaces are employed to great effect, allowing the viewer both to feel secure and helplessly alone, all depending on what's happening.The plot is a rocking roller coaster. It's nigh-on impossible to predict what's gonna happen next, and when it does you worry about will happen after that. Just like Gotham itself, the film starts out straightforward enough, then spirals more and more out of predictability and into - appropriately enough - chaos. At the centre of all this, of course, stands the Joker. The late Heath Ledger fully deserved his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor; his performance is mind-blowing to say the least. The Joker has never been a more fascinating character than here, in my personal opinion. You try to figure him out, then you wonder how you can; his two theories about his scars are enough to demonstrate this. A psychotically evil force, he manages to bring out the worst of everyone he comes into contact with, and somehow - and this is the real clinch - manages to keep his hands clean of the many miseries he causes. Perhaps what's most frightening about the Joker is how everything he says - terrible and crazy though it may be - somehow makes sense. His speech to Harvey Dent about chaos has me dumbfounded and terrified at how convincing it sounds.The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Christian Bale continues to develop his Batman, a far more three-dimensional Bruce Wayne than any of his predecessors could manage. Wayne is isolated, broken, even a little detached. Batman is the only way the true potential of his personality can be unleashed. Aaron Eckhart is perfect as white knight Harvey Dent, whose pure heart is perhaps in most danger from the Joker. His performance is electrifying and charismatic, yet always with a tangible sense of insecurity. That's not an easy balance to pull off and Aaron Eckhart did it with wonders. Maggie Gyllenhaal takes the role of Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes, and I must say that I like the exchange. Not only do she and Bale have much more believable chemistry as the two childhood friends, she inhibits the character really well in her bold determination to stand up to injustice. Michael Caine is wonderful as Alfred, is the root to reality that Bruce Wayne needs; a warm and compassionate father figure to keep him sane when things are at their worst. Gary Oldman then clinches the deal as Lt. Gordon, as incorruptible as Wayne. To be frank, each and every performance is spot on. There is not a moment of flat acting in this entire picture, and it sees many characters. Even Russian ballerina Natasha, who appears for about five minutes of the film, is an intriguing character.Powerful themes are dealt with in this film. Who is to blame? The one causing the miseries or the hero who refuses to give in to his demands? Batman often finds himself on the receiving end of the fear-tinged fury of Gotham, being an obvious target. Because the Joker deals in such deception, he is harder to target and thus easier to fear. So people turn on Batman if he refuses to give in to the Joker's ultimatum, promising order in Gotham if Batman turns himself in. This is a very interesting and sadly authentic human flaw that Jonathan Nolan has caught. Just whom should we be fighting against when we can't get to the one behind the misery? That doesn't just go for Batman. Nolan's script is truly superb, leading to a story that begs for repeated viewings. I spoke of how the film gets more and more chaotic. Believe me, after the film draws to a close, you are probably rooted to your seat.However, a number of factors rend the whole experience apart. At times the plot is completely unbelievable, and loses the audience with its rapid transitions. After Batman saves Rachel at the party, we cut to another scene. Wasn't the Joker still there? What, did he just decide to go home? Also, who are those ""five dead, two of them cops"" that Gordon talks about late in the film? Then there is a character who dies, only to turn out to have faked their death. The craziest thing, though, was how Batman somehow connected a fingerprint from a bullet at a murder scene to the location where the Joker kept captured guards and distracted the guards with a timed curtain. I don't see how anybody could make that connection and this remains the biggest problem I have with The Dark Knight.That's the problem with The Dark Knight, too. There's simply too much going on to keep track of, and there is often such suspension of disbelief. The film takes itself way too seriously. I miss the colourful, creepy Gotham city, including the one in Batman Begins. Gotham doesn't look or feel at all like Gotham, just like any random US city. The Joker, also, is too smart to be believable. He foresees absolutely everything that happens and this really starts to become silly after a while. While the performances are first-class and the action and deep-seated themes will root you to your seat, I think Nolan would do good to step back and retrieve more of the fantasy aspect of Batman, such as in the animated series.",3,Tries Too Hard,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,6434,"['Dark', 'Knight', ""n't"", 'average', 'superhero', 'movie', 'little', 'fantasy', 'one', 'often', 'such',

The Joker played by Heath Ledger is the new villain replacing Ra's al Ghul, the villain in Batman Begins. The Joker's unpredictable character leaves you wondering as to what he will do, while the Batman's response to the situations in the movie are no surprise. Even the more insignificant roles, such as Lieutenant Gordon and Rachel Daws, contribute to the plot while not being in many scenes. Rachel's frustration from Gotham asking for the Batman to give himself up and her not being able to tell who it is puts Harvey Dent in a spot where he thinks it would be best to say that he was the Batman. Since Harvey gets arrested all of the hundreds of criminals he caught would be freed. Gordon's needing to rely on harvey forces Batman to run away  at the end of the movie.The movie shows that people really only care about themselves. This is shown during a scene at the end of the movie. All of the people of Gotham were escaping on two boats. On one boat were all of the criminals and everyone else were on the other boat. The Joker put explosives on each boat and gave each boat the detonator to the other boat. If neither boat exploded the other the Joker would blow up both of the boats. Both boats were about to destroy the other until they are saved by the Batman.The Dark Night is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It is action pact with amazing visual affects. I would recommend for anybody who hasn't seen the movie to watch it immediately, despite the two and a half hour duration I would say that anybody nine or older can see the movie.

Nolan didn't want to make this third installment and it shows in that the script has no polish whatsoever.**** SPOILER ALERT Past this line ****Most of the critical scenes are absurdly contrived and pointlessly complex.a) Cat burgler steals Bruce Wayne's full set of fingerprints from a safe (and breaks into it for good measure). MUCH easer to get them from a beer bottle or can from the trash (he's a recluse with precious few people in the house to muddy the water).And, strangely, having prints from a beer bottle allows one access to billions in assets.... you know..... because that's how Hollywood stock markets roll with their security.b) The Stock market is invaded in a military attack to insert a program to run bogus trades. Whouldn't it be ALOT EASIER to just bribe a broker to enter the program (which, apparently, involves plugging in a laptop and, hitting the enter key).They literally stormed the stock market in broad daylight (automatic weapons, hostages, chase scenes, etc) just to plug in a laptop and hit the enter key.c) Attacking a CIA plane with a military cargo plane while in flight employing cables, a highly choreographed paramilitary acrobatic team and an inside man wearing a mask (which is never removed by his captors). This scene is ripped out of Stallone's film - Cliffhanger bye the way (and poorly adapted). If you had a month to prepare this flying circus, couldn't you just place a few sharpshooters around the Remote airstrip, shoot the agents before they took off, take the guy you came for, leave the mandatory corpse and then burn the evidence after the fact? Just saying.. 20 or 30 bullets is alot cheaper than the rental on a C-130.d) Fusion reactors are NOT fusion bombs as much as Hollywood wishes they were. Can they explode? .... Yes. On a vast scale? .... Not one that fits in a truck). The Joker said it himself - chemicals are cheap - just build a big bomb.Or, if you must be cataclysmic, MUCH easier to use a bunch of Dirty bombs (uranium Oxide ""cake"") that can be obtained in any number of unstable, easily bribed countries. Or buy a nuke off the black market in Eastern Europe. Mr. Nolan would know about these or a Hundred other plausible plot devices if he bothered to Ask someone like..... a TECHNICAL CONSULTANT. (Seriously, $200 million plus budget. Hire someone to do some basic homework.)e) How can a police force that can render a major city nearly ""crime free"" and yet be clueles to an army of insurgents.... Are we supposed to believe that these shaved chimps cleaned up crime That effectively without lacing up the old Hob-Nailed Boots to do so?f) Etcetera (and don't get me Started about a helicopter with the blades on the bottom and the top covered over).But All this can be forgiven if the charactors are well written and engaging.They aren't.Bruce/Batman is a self-destructive, self-loathing cripple(Alfred concurs with the first two, his doctor confirms the third - in case someone in the audience failed to notice the painful limp).Bane can't hammer a nail without orchestating a raid on Home Depot first.(And none of the employees would understand him when he demanded directions to thehardware section without the aid of a cheesy voiceover.)Both, yes Both of the female leads betray Bruce (Nolan Really has some issues there)There is No main character that one can admire, root for, care about.... keep your eyes open to watch while you're figuring out which artery to cut to make it all go away.Morgan Freeman is excellent as always but he can't hold this wrist-slasher together by himself.Michael Caine is excellent and I actually apprecied his advice when he prophetically walked

659183,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00005JPY0,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[5, 6]","Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins was an interesting take on an established character and franchise. Batman has always been one of the most morally complex 'superheroes' out there and Nolan used his movie to explore the psyche of Bruce Wayne in a manner that Tim Burton's earlier movies barely touched on. However, it was let down by a relatively unimpressive pair of villains, a weak ending and far too much stuff being shoehorned into the plot, resulting in bloat. For all of that, it was still an impressive film.The first film ended with the establishing of the alliance between Lt. Jim Gordon of the Gotham City police department and Batman, and the beginning of a crime spree by a shadowy figure known as the Joker. The second movie picks up a few weeks or months later, with the Joker rapidly becoming public enemy number one and Batman's attempts to locate and defeat him being unsuccessful, especially as his crimefighting crusade is becoming complicated by the emergence of ham-fisted copy-cat vigilantes. However, a new district attorney, Harvey Dent, has made it his business to bring down Gotham's criminals and after a series of major successes against important gangs and crime bosses, Bruce Wayne begins to let himself think that maybe he won't have to be Batman forever.Of course, this is only the beginning of the story. Batman, Dent and Gordon form an unofficial alliance to bring down and defeat the criminals of the city, but the Joker reacts by forming his own alliance of the various criminal elements against them. The result is an escalating series of complex, doublecrossing traps and counter-traps by both sides. The stakes are raised, lives are lost, and Gotham is brought into utter chaos as a result. And two men's souls and morals are caught in the balance.The Dark Knight is a fiendishly clever film which works on a thematic level that superhero movies have rarely operated at before. For this reason, the movie has already been hailed as the most important superhero movie to date, elevating the genre to a new level of credibility (possibly having the same effect on the genre that 2001 had on science fiction or Lord of the Rings on fantasy films). It's hard to argue entirely against this: The Dark Knight is a movie of impressive ambitions, but whilst from an artistic perspective it may indeed be worthy of the hype bestowed upon it, its role as entertainment accordingly suffers in several key areas.Much has been made of the late Heath Ledger's remarkable performance as the Joker. Taking on a role that Jack Nicholson had made memorable in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman movie was a challenge, but one that Ledger rose to by simply making his Joker an insane agent of chaos, an enigma, rather than a loud clown with a detailed (if unoriginal) backstory. The Joker gets no backplot here, nothing to make him sympathetic on a human level. He is a psychopath and a monster, one that Ledger portrays with brilliant intensity and some excellent comedic timing. However, his role in the film appears misleading. The heart of The Dark Knight is the war for the soul of Harvey Dent, and in that story the Joker is a catalyst. The Joker's significant amounts of screentime eat into the more compelling story of Dent (an almost-equally impressive performance from Aaron Eckhart), who is absent from the plot for long periods of time and his inevitable late-film transformation is not really given enough time to be fully convincing.A more basic problem is that the movie is too long, and several major climactic set-pieces take place some considerable time before the end of the movie. Hollywood CGI whiz and blogger Mojo has advanced a theory that The Dark Knight actually is an amalgamation of two films into one, and if the Joker and Dent strands had been separated (perhaps by having the Joker's antics and his late-movie plot involving two ferries, which come out of nowhere, as one film and the fall of Dent in another) both would have been stronger. As it stands, the latter third of the movie feels considerably less-developed than the rest, and the series of apparently-but-not-quite final moments in the movie begins to challenge Return of the King at times for its frustration.Performances are universally excellent. Eckhart and Ledger get special nods, but supporting hands from the first movie Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and especially Michael Caine all give excellent performances. Caine in particular impresses, with Alfred's experiences as a soldier giving him a moral authority that he uses to convince Batman to do the hard thing at times, paying off in a spectacular moment when Batman makes precisely the opposite decision to what the audience expects. Similarly, after a relatively minor role in the first movie Oldman steps up as Gordon and makes him a credible threat to the city's criminals. In a busy movie, Freeman's character of Lucius Fox even has time for an amusing subplot in which he discovers a Wayne Enterprises employee who has figured out where a chunk of the company's revenue is going and why. Maggie Gyllenhaall, taking over the Katie Holmes role from the first film (thankfully, as Gyllenhaal is a much better actress), also impresses. Christian Bale does good work as Wayne/Batman, but in a movie of stand-out performances from even the secondary cast, Bale merely settles for being pretty good.The Dark Knight (****) is an effective, impressive and dark film with stand-out acting and an interesting thematic arc, but occasionally it lacks focus and has some scripting and pacing issues. It is definitely one of the better superhero movies of recent years, but I'd hesitate about calling it the best. What is does do, however, is aim for something much higher than most superhero movies even think about achieving and if it falls short, it remains an impressive ambition.",4,"An excellent movie, but

And it's been over 2 years!Hold the applause, please...I'm a little rusty, so here goes.THE DARK KNIGHT is the direct sequel to BATMAN BEGINS, once again directed by Christopher Nolan.  Most of the cast is back; Maggie Gyllenhall replaces Katie Holmes and we have two new additions...the villains played by Aaron Eckhart and the late Heath Ledger.Before we start off, those of you that know me, I tend to be a stubborn reviewer.  I've written reviews that borderline egocentric bias and am usually brutally honest.  I come from the mid-80s when Michael Keaton was the coolest Batman and my thoughts were always ""I'll be damned if they ever find someone as good as him.""  I'm usually guarded and critical going into movies, especially those that pertain to my childhood.  I offer no apologies for the way that I write, but I think I do make an effort to be fair and just.That being said, I have to admit that I walked into BATMAN BEGINS with some skepticism and I really didn't like Christian Bale's Batman voice.  However, I feel I am content to say that THE DARK KNIGHT improves on the first movie in a lot of ways.  First off all...while I am not 100% comfortable with Christian Bale as Batman, he is starting to grow on me.  He's the first actor to start impressing me in the role since Michael Keaton, and if they make a third one he will have the role down perfectly.  Secondly, I liked Maggie Gyllenhall as a replacement over Katie Holmes.  I've never been a Katie Holmes fan (despite the fact that she's cute) and felt that her acting was flat in BATMAN BEGINS.  Maggie Gyllenhall has more depth to her, and the chemistry between she and Aaron Eckhart was convincing.The two standout actors that won me over in this movie were Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face and Heath Ledger as the Joker.  While the movie got a lot of hype because of Heath Ledger's untimely death, appraisal of his performance is WELL-deserved.  Eckhart brings out a really twisted Two-Face without being obvious, and his transformation into the character was smooth and well-developed.  Ledger was cynically funny as the Joker and what impressed me was they never bothered to develop the Joker's back story...something that allows me to disconnect his performance from Jack Nicholson's in the original Tim Burton BATMAN.  Ledger is a very quirky, cynical, but strangely loveable Joker, and I have to admit it's haunting knowing that Heath's career came to an abrupt end.  I especially liked his fight scenes with Batman, which was a slight reminder to Keaton and Nicholson battling it out in the original movie.Overall, I was genuinely surprised by the movie.  Great performances all around, great action scenes, and one of the darkest Batman movies to come in a long time (that end scene with Two-Face and Gordon was downright creepy!).  I also loved how they didn't go with the campy ""happy ending"" and left Batman as a protector of Gotham but still feared.  They did everything to improve upon BATMAN BEGINS and put Batman back on a solid, credible course.  I have great hopes for a third one.And while there was a lot of hype surrounding it, the movie certainly lives up to it.  It's good to know that the next generation can have a Batman series worth enjoying, and it will not surprise me if Heath Ledger gets---at least---an Oscar nomination for his performance.",4,"""YOU...COMPLETE...ME!""",1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,3396,"['Well', 'what', 'do', 'ya', 'know', 'Axel', 'Law', 'back', 'review', 'been', '2', 'years', 'Hold', 'applause', 'please', ""'m"", 'little', 'rusty', 'so', 'here', 'goes.THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'direct', 'sequel', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'once', 'again', 'directed', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Most', 'cast', 'back', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhall', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'have', 'two', 'new', 'additions', 'villains', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger.Before', 'start', 'off', 'know', 'tend', 'be', 'stubborn', 'reviewer', ""'ve"", 'written', 'borderline', 'egocentric', 'bias', 'am', 'usually', 'brutally', 'honest', 'come', 'mid-80s', 'when', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'was', 'coolest', 'Batman', 'thoughts', 'were', 'always', ""'ll"", 'be', 'damned', 'ever', 'find', 'someone', 'as', 'good', ""'m"", 'usually', 'guarded', 'critical', 'going', 'movies', 'especially', 'pertain', 'childhood', 'offer', 'apologies', 'way', 'write', 'think', 'do', 'make', 'effort', 'be', 'fair', 'just.That', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'admit', 'walked', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'skepticism', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'voice', 'However', 'feel', 'am', 'content', 'say', 'THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'first', 'movie', 'lot', 'ways', 'First', 'am', 'not', '100', '%', 'comfortable', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'starting', 'grow', 'first', 'actor', 'start', 'impressing', 'role', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'make', 'third', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'role', 'down', 'perfectly', 'Secondly', 'liked', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhall', 'replacement', 'Katie', 'Holmes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'fan', 'fact', 'cute', 'felt', 'acting', 'was', 'flat', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhall', 'more', 'depth', 'chemistry', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'was', 'convincing.The', 'two', 'standout', 'actors', 'won', 'over', 'movie', 'were', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Two-Face', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'movie', 'got', 'lot', 'hype', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'untimely', 'death', 'appraisal', 'performance', 'WELL-deserved', 'Eckhart', 'out', 'really', 'twisted', 'Two-Face', 'being', 'obvious', 'transformation', 'character', 'was', 'smooth', 'well-developed', 'Ledger', 'was', 'cynically', 'funny', 'Joker', 'what', 'impressed', 'was', 'never', 'bothered', 'develop', 'Joker', 'back', 'story', 'something', 'disconnect', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'original', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'BATMAN', 'Ledger', 'very', 'quirky', 'cynical', 'strangely', 'loveable', 'Joker', 'have', 'admit', 'haunting', 'knowing', 'Heath', 'career', 'came', 'abrupt', 'end', 'especially', 'liked', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Batman', 'was', 'slight', 'reminder', 'Keaton', 'Nicholson', 'battling', 'out', 'original', 'movie.Overall', 'was', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'movie', 'Great', 'around', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'one', 'darkest', 'Batman', 'movies', 'come', 'long', 'time', 'end', 'scene', 'Two-Face', 'Gordon', 'was', 'downright', 'creepy', 'also', 'loved', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'campy', 'happy', 'ending', 'left', 'Batman', 'protector', 'Gotham', 'still', 'feared', 'did', 'everything', 'improve', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'put', 'Batman', 'back', 'solid', 'credible', 'course', 'have', 'great', 'hopes', 'third', 'one.And', 'was', 'lot', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'certainly', 'up', 'good', 'know', 'next', 'generation', 'can', 'have', 'Batman', 'series', 'worth', 'enjoying', 'will', 'not', 'surprise', 'Heath', 'Ledger', '-at', 'least', '-an', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Chaney,"[3, 5]","I went to see The Dark Knight on opening night with my husband (who is the ultimate Batman fan) a little apprehensive because I grew up loving the original Tim Burton Batman which covered the same period in the Batman saga as ""The Dark Knight.""  I was thoroughly engaged by this movie (and I usually don't love action films).  It was visually stunning, darker than Burton's, and at times, edge of your seat intense.Heath Ledger's Joker is much darker and scarier than Jack Nicholson's, and the movie as a whole was much darker and less cartoon like.  In all Ledger really steals the film--you can't take your eyes off of him when he's on film.  The Joker is truly terrifying--when he torments his prey it is horror film intense.  Christian Bale is a cool, collected Batman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a suitable love interest.  I really enjoyed Aaron Eckhardt as Harvey Dent and wish the movie hadn't turned out the way it did for his character.  In all the action sequences were mesmerizing, although I did feel like the movie went on about 30 minutes too long, and the last action sequence was very, very long.I would recommend this movie if you've ever enjoyed a Batman movie, and are open to seeing a new interpretation of this classic character.

Memo to the world...THE DARK KNIGHT IS NOT EVEN A GOOD MOVIE! Having the veneer of seriousness, self-importance, and pomposity does not a good movie make! It is a sequence of quick, confusing, messy scenes with dialogue as juvenile as in any junk movie I've seen the last decade! There really isn't all that much action, as has been proclaimed and the action that it does have is barely entertaining and is convoluted as all get out. Seen it 3 times to TRY to find redeeming qualities. The first time, only Heath Ledger saved it for me and I found myself WAITING for him to appear just so I could enjoy part of the film. The 2nd and 3rd time? Even he became annoying and I actually don't think his performance is truly Oscar-worthy.The fighting scenes are very lazy. Looks like Batman and the bad guys are just doing kid karate chops at each other. The guy is a NINJA! He took out Al Ghul's highly trained ninjas in BATMAN BEGINS almost like it was nothing. He certainly ought to be able to more easily handle a bunch of low-level criminals, including the Joker. And what is with the uber-raspy voice and the ridiculous outfit? The voice wasn't nearly as raspy in BB and the outfit was much better in that film, too. What adds to the absurdity is that, for some odd reason, Nolan abandoned the Gothic city look in BEGINS to favor a REAL city look in TDK! Now, Joker and Batman REALLY look ridiculous in those outfits traipsing around the city.Except for Joker, ALL characters are one-dimensional and dull. In BEGINS, the main cast was smaller and were operating with an ACTUAL script! Also in BEGINS, there were essentially no minor or non-essential characters that were given spoon-fed dialogue to ruin the proceedings, unlike in this movie. So now in this sequel, you have the main cast, multiplied by 2, with crappy dialogue, along with an army of minor cliched, dull extras that add NOTHING to the movie.

659191,A2W5J2PHD9D65J,B00005JPY0,Bardwire777,"[5, 15]","First off I don't want to rain on anyone's parade.  I am glad this movie has done so well because Ledger deserves to go out with a bang.That said...this movie would not have held up half as well without Ledger.  Ledger is the only thing that comes close to genius in this movie.Granted Nolan did provide some of his vision.  While Nolan's obsession with his own bleak nihilistic themes is cutting edge it seems to have stolen his focus (ie. long nihilistic joker monologues)and his story didn't get enough attention.  Watching it I got the feeling that a pretentious self-important man is at the helm of this movie who at times is brilliant but for the most part is trying to hard to be POST-MODERN DARK.  Ok it's the DARK Knight, we get it already.  Let's move on.The plot is confusing and leaves HUGE holes in the story.  Sure, it's ultamitely a comic book movie but it seems Nolan prided himself on his realistic brutal take on the franchise - yet he makes huge jumps in logic.3 MAIN LOGIC JUMPS...1) Batman and Maggie's jump from the building.  The fall six stories survive and we never find out what happened with the mad serial killer joker who when we left him was still up in the penthouse terrorizing people!!!  Come on! Don't leave us hanging!PS. When did Batman become Superman?  He can bend the barrels of guns with one hand.  Crush the roof of a car as if he weighed 3 tons.2) The fake Gordon death.  Give Me A Break.  It was a plot twist for the sake of plot twists with no heed to any logic.  Gordon decided to fake his death so he could save Batman's life yet there is no way he could have possibly anticipted the events that would follow (Dent's confessing to be Batman, Batman not turning himself in...etc)  Gordon would have to have been pschycic to have pulled that off.  You might not agree but the whole affair seemed more than a little contrived.4) The hospital scene.  Heath Leger in the nurses dress was visionary and hilarious - especially since he's so sexually-ambiguous anyway.  But maybe somebody can tell me how the heck Harvey Dent can be convinced by this homicidal maniac WHO KILLED THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE that he should join him!!  COME ON!  Further more, how could the ritious and honerable Dent ever be convinced to try to kill Gorden's son.  Rediculous.  Maybe the reason I don't believe that the Joker convinces Dent to go to the dark side is because all the Joker is doing in that pivotal hospital scene is rambling off on some vague nihalistic rhetoric.  I could barely understand it let alone be convinced that he actaully had a point!!!  I was expecting Two Face to scream in his Two Face way ""GET OFF MY BED YOU PRETENTIOUSNESS PSCHYCOPATH!!!!!""In retrospect, maybe they should have let Two Face have the third movie to himself.  That would have given Dent a full two films to develop his villany and would have seemed less stuffed and rushed.SMALLER GRIPES1)  I have no idea why Nolan went with the campy Eric Roberts instead of James Gandolfini who was up for the role (that's a fact).2) The Scarecrow got ZERO respect and was made into another punk.3) The fake Batmans were rediculous and confusing.4) The action sequences were very messy and separated by LONG BORINGscenes of dialogue.5) Why would Batman have to use that fake deep voice around Morgan Freeman's character who knows who his real identity is?6)  Why does Batman have to kill Harvey at the end?  He didn't kill the Joker when he had a chance on that batcycle thing.  It seemed excessive and forced climax.  Just more of Nolan trying to push his nihalistic irony on us.7)  This is the second movie after Batman and yet Wayne is already trying to get out of the vigalante business?  Michael Corleone didn't try to get out of the family until the third Godfather film.  It was too soon to play that card.  Lets see some business as usual, huh?8)  Some have compared the opening sequence to Heat and Nolan to Michael Mann.  Well, yeah, it's a similar armed robbery scene with ak47s and masks, same music AND the guy who plays VanSandt plays the bank manager.  It's more like a tribute than a splash of originality.***(LOGIC ALERT) But maybe someone can also tell me how they were able to break through the back of the building and join a line of school buses unnoticed.  After a very realistic robbery scene that really yanked me out.All said and done....The movie is definitely an experience, a refreshingly dark blockbuster, which is impressive.  I'm glad the fanboys got something to rejoice over.  It is worth seeing and I will probibly see it again.  But stull, it has seious flaws in my book which are annoying and are emphisized by most people's unconditional love for this film.  I feel the need to lay down some perspective.  I found it was definitely cool but not ""GENIUS"" - it's a rich trip into darkness if nothing else.  Thanks Heath (RIP)",3,I can't ignore the flaws....

659192,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JPY0,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[4, 8]","Believe the hype. Very rarely does a movie generate so much hype, so much buzz, and so much acclaim that it lives up to it. Maybe it does for me more than others, but ""The Dark Knight"" delivers on everything it promises and then some. This is pretty heavy stuff and not suitable for the real young kiddies. Director Christopher Nolan and his amazingly talented cast and crew have put together a film that would almost seem an injustice to refer to as a ""comic book movie"" or a ""superhero movie"", because it just seems like it's not. It's a very dark, gritty, crime drama that just happens to have two people dressed up as a bat and a clown in it. If Michael Mann or Martin Scorsese directed a Batman movie, it might turn out looking something like this.Gotham City. It has Batman(Christian Bale), District Attorney Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhardt), and Lt. James Gordon(Gary Oldman), all trying to turn the crime rate on it's ear. Batman/Bruce Wayne sees hope in Harvey Dent, but hope seems to be ready to be destroyed when a madman wearing clown make-up and get up wanders into town ready to unleash his special brand of chaos and mayhem. This is the Joker, and Heath Ledger is ready to stun, amaze, frighten, and captivate you with his unbelieveable performance.The movie and it's taut, tight direction from Nolan is one for the books. A movie is only as good as it's cast, and this one is no exception from the amazing cast 'Batman Begins' had. First and foremost is Ledger. There is no denying the talent he had, and it's on full display here. This is not Cesar Romero or Jack Nicholson. This is something nobody has seen before. Ledger loses himself in the role and never resurfaces. What you are seeing is the Joker, alive and well in all his glory. His tics and delivery are spot on, and it is something that will stay with you long after the movie is over. There is definitley an Oscar nomination in the future for this portrayal. Elsewhere, Bale continues to be the solid footing for the whole epic event, and he is the best Batman, and a great Bruce Wayne. His growling Batman voice is still unsettling and a bit unnerving, but he is Batman. Maggie Gyllenhall takes over for Katie Holmes, and she does what she can, but the role still feels like just the ""female"" as in the first film. Michael Caine and Gary Oldman are as solid and dependable as ever, if only they had more to do.The movie looks great. I love the gothic look of Tim Burton's Gotham, and the very colorful, comic book dowsed Gotham from Joel Schumacher, but this Gotham takes place in the real world. This could be your city. Nolan obviously had a ball filming Chicago(as Gotham)and everything else, because the movie is a wonderful sight to behold. The action has been amped up, the movie and tone darker, and the ante has been upped in just about every way. The script is tight and holds itself together, something that doesn't always happen in comic bo....oh, there's those words again. The movie races from start to finish and is never boring, even if the rather long running time may have you thinking otherwise.""The Dark Knight"" is the, okay I'll say it, comic book and superhero movie that all others that come afterward should be measured. It raises the bar increasingly high. Marvel may seem to of gotten a lot of the spotlight here lately, but DC and Batman have now put the stamp on how it should be. It's a great movie.",5,A Knight To Remember,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,3403,"['Believe', 'hype', 'Very', 'rarely', 'movie', 'generate', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'so', 'much', 'buzz', 'so', 'much', 'acclaim', 'up', 'Maybe', 'more', 'others', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'delivers', 'everything', 'then', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'not', 'suitable', 'real', 'young', 'kiddies', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'cast', 'crew', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'would', 'almost', 'seem', 'injustice', 'refer', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'superhero', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'dark', 'gritty', 'crime', 'drama', 'just', 'have', 'two', 'people', 'dressed', 'up', 'bat', 'clown', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'directed', 'Batman', 'movie', 'might', 'turn', 'out', 'looking', 'something', 'this.Gotham', 'City', 'Batman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Aaron', 'Eckhardt', 'Lt.', 'James', 'Gordon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'trying', 'turn', 'crime', 'rate', 'ear', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'hope', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'hope', 'be', 'ready', 'be', 'destroyed', 'when', 'madman', 'wearing', 'clown', 'make-up', 'get', 'up', 'wanders', 'town', 'ready', 'unleash', 'special', 'brand', 'chaos', 'mayhem', 'Joker', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'ready', 'stun', 'amaze', 'frighten', 'captivate', 'unbelieveable', 'performance.The', 'movie', 'taut', 'tight', 'direction', 'Nolan', 'one', 'books', 'movie', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'cast', 'one', 'exception', 'amazing', 'cast', ""'Batman"", 'Begins', 'had', 'First', 'foremost', 'Ledger', 'denying', 'talent', 'had', 'full', 'display', 'here', 'not', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'something', 'nobody', 'seen', 'Ledger', 'role', 'never', 'resurfaces', 'What', 'are', 'seeing', 'Joker', 'alive', 'well', 'glory', 'tics', 'delivery', 'are', 'spot', 'something', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'movie', 'over', 'definitley', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'future', 'portrayal', 'Elsewhere', 'Bale', 'be', 'solid', 'footing', 'whole', 'epic', 'event', 'best', 'Batman', 'great', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'growling', 'Batman', 'voice', 'still', 'unsettling', 'bit', 'unnerving', 'Batman', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhall', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'what', 'can', 'role', 'still', 'just', 'female', 'first', 'film', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'are', 'solid', 'dependable', 'ever', 'only', 'had', 'more', 'do.The', 'movie', 'great', 'love', 'gothic', 'look', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Gotham', 'very', 'colorful', 'comic', 'book', 'dowsed', 'Gotham', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Gotham', 'place', 'real', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'city', 'Nolan', 'obviously', 'had', 'ball', 'filming', 'Chicago', 'Gotham', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'sight', 'behold', 'action', 'been', 'amped', 'up', 'movie', 'tone', 'darker', 'ante', 'been', 'upped', 'just', 'way', 'script', 'tight', 'together', 'something', ""n't"", 'always', 'happen', 'comic', 'bo', '.oh', 'words', 'again', 'movie', 'races', 'start', 'finish', 'never', 'boring', 'even', 'rather', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'may', 'have', 'thinking', 'otherwise', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'okay', ""'ll"", 'say', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'movie', 'others', 'come', 'afterward', 'should', 'be', 'measured', 'bar', 'increasingly', 'high', 'Marvel', 'may', 'seem', 'gotten', 'lot', 'spotlight', 'here', 'lately', 'DC', 'Batman', 'have', 'now', 'put', 'stamp', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'movie']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659193,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B00005JPY0,barry,"[3, 4]","The film THE DARK KNIGHT is amazing, a revelation to some including me but for those interested in the blu-ray version of a film there are many other questions.  How is the video?  How is the audio?  Is the blu-ray transfer worthy of a purchase.  The answer to both questions here is a resounding both are great and a purchase is a must.  Blu-ray allows much opportunity for crispness and clarity of picture - when done to its best a film takes on a life of its own.  And THE DARK KNIGHT can honestly be reviewed in two parts - the movie itself and the blu-ray version.  Critics have hailed the blu-ray version as one of the best examples of how blu-ray can shine.  This is not a quiet film in picture or audio.  There is much quick action, tons of important closeups and many dynamic shots created by director Christopher Nolan.  The clarity and crispness of the video on blu-ray never falters and will have you glued to your hd television.  Colors are vibrant, skin tones realistic and the ratio with blacks and whites superb.  All the explosions and effects shine and seem to pop from the screen.  The audio is also a masterpiece and provides the necessary accompaniment to such a perfect presentation.  Dialogue is perfect and action sequences very realistic.Of course one cannot review this film without mentioning the very sad aspect of Heath Ledger's untimely death.  How wonderful that his final role is such a true testament to the depth of talent he possessed.  He became THE JOKER in a way that ruled the film.  Just by his movements and way of speaking you got hints of the character's back story.  The performance was at the same time mezmerizing, perfection and terrifying.  This was an Oscar well deserved.  But we must also give huge kudos to director Christopher Nolan and actor Christian Bale.  Batman has been a comic, a television series and even done in film before.  Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the superhero take the story totally beyond comic book genre and presents Batman as a very real character with his own deep troubles and personal history.  This film is a story for the ages done well on all levels.  Acting, directing, writing all fall together for a deep, intense, scary story that will haunt you.  Heath Ledger's performance is worthy of a purchase alone but the film itself matches him at each level.  How often does this happen.Ans again, in regards to the blu-ray, this is a must purchase.

659197,A1JXE27STRRE0H,B00005JPY0,"Beardyjin ""beardyjin""","[0, 2]","This movie certainly is drawing a lot of comparisons.The Wall Street Journal compares it to No Country For Old Men, Rolling Stone magazine compares Bale's performance to Pacino in Godfather II and Ledger's performance to McDowell in Clockwork Orange, TIME magazine compares it to  Silence of the Lambs, a very astute comparison was made to the film HEAT by one reviewer at aicn.com [[...] and everyone else (the aforementioned included) compares it to Jack Nicholson's Joker in the 1989 Batman directed by Tim Burton.However, if comparisons must be made, I think director Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight would best be compared to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.Nolan, like Jackson, based his films on previous material and translated it to film in an engaging way that spoke to modern audiences while staying true to the source material. Tolkien's Middle Earth is an allegory much like Nolan's Gotham City is an allegory. The Gotham City of The Dark Knight bears much resemblance to a slightly more sinister post 9/11 America.Gotham is a city ensconced in fear (thanks in no small part to the events of Batman Begins, which gets a brief nod in the film's opening sequence) and while a trio of do-gooders (Lieutenant Gordon, D.A. Harvey Dent, & Batman) are working tirelessly to put away Gotham's crime bosses and eliminate the fear...along comes the Joker to exploit that fear.Much like Jackson's LotR films were not just simply ""fantasy films,"" Nolan's TDK cannot be accurately labeled as simply a ""superhero"" movie. TDK, like LotR, not only serves to re-invigorate a genre, but redefine it as well.Nolan has made an Epic/Action/Drama with TDK--a film that not only excites and astounds, but questions and examines. Nolan, like Jackson, examines not only good and evil, but the grey areas in between the two and how sacrifice is key to holding society together.Corruption, violence, terror--is modern American so accustomed to these things that it cannot withstand a full on assault of its founding democratic principles of truth, justice, and liberty?Or is society already lost? Have we all grown so accustomed to the violence and corruption of democracy that we ourselves have been corrupted to the point that we're all just dancing around each other, merely hiding our savage nature under a thin veneer of normalcy (or ""the plan"" as the Joker calls it)? The Joker believes the later and feels compelled to point out this veneer to the citizens of Gotham.Nolan would like to think we're not so close to the corrupted savages the Joker would make us out to be. Thus Batman. If Joker represents amoral savagery then Batman is conscience. Batman makes the choice that so many Americans have had to make in the face of an assault on our freedoms. Batman sticks to his principles (or ""rules"" as their referred to in the film) despite the fact his life would be so much easier/happier if he didn't stick to those principles. That's sacrifice.This need to sacrifice is underscored in a moving scene at the end of the film where a large group of Gotham's citizens is basically put in a maniacally malevolent experiment by the Joker where they must become mass murderers or die themselves. Joker is ultimately left disappointed in his experiment, but not without a cost to some of the film's characters--not without a sacrifice.Despite its many excellent action scenes The Dark Knight isn't one of those blockbuster movies where audiences leave the theaters feeling exhilarated an ""pumped up."" Instead you're more likely to feel drained as you walk out the door. The Dark Knight doesn't simply take you on an emotional ride, but on an ethical and ultimately introspective ride as well.",5,Comparing TDK to LotR,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,3694,"['movie', 'certainly', 'drawing', 'lot', 'comparisons.The', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Journal', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'Bale', 'performance', 'Pacino', 'Godfather', 'II', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'McDowell', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'TIME', 'magazine', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'very', 'astute', 'comparison', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'HEAT', 'one', 'reviewer', 'aicn.com', '[', '[', ']', 'everyone', 'else', 'aforementioned', 'included', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', '1989', 'Batman', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Burton.However', 'comparisons', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'think', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'would', 'best', 'be', 'compared', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy.Nolan', 'Jackson', 'based', 'films', 'previous', 'material', 'translated', 'film', 'engaging', 'way', 'spoke', 'modern', 'audiences', 'staying', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'Tolkien', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'allegory', 'much', 'Nolan', 'Gotham', 'City', 'allegory', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'much', 'resemblance', 'slightly', 'more', 'sinister', 'post', '9/11', 'America.Gotham', 'city', 'ensconced', 'fear', 'thanks', 'small', 'part', 'events', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'brief', 'nod', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'trio', 'do-gooders', 'Lieutenant', 'Gordon', 'D.A', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Batman', 'are', 'working', 'tirelessly', 'put', 'away', 'Gotham', 'crime', 'bosses', 'eliminate', 'fear', 'along', 'Joker', 'exploit', 'fear.Much', 'Jackson', 'LotR', 'films', 'were', 'not', 'just', 'simply', 'fantasy', 'films', 'Nolan', 'TDK', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'accurately', 'labeled', 'simply', 'superhero', 'movie', 'TDK', 'LotR', 'not', 'only', 're-invigorate', 'genre', 'redefine', 'well.Nolan', 'made', 'Epic/Action/Drama', 'TDK', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'astounds', 'questions', 'examines', 'Nolan', 'Jackson', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'evil', 'grey', 'areas', 'two', 'how', 'sacrifice', 'key', 'holding', 'society', 'together.Corruption', 'violence', 'terror', 'modern', 'American', 'so', 'accustomed', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'withstand', 'full', 'assault', 'founding', 'democratic', 'principles', 'truth', 'justice', 'liberty', 'society', 'already', 'lost', 'Have', 'grown', 'so', 'accustomed', 'violence', 'corruption', 'democracy', 'ourselves', 'have', 'been', 'corrupted', 'point', ""'re"", 'just', 'dancing', 'around', 'other', 'merely', 'hiding', 'savage', 'nature', 'thin', 'veneer', 'normalcy', 'plan', 'Joker', 'Joker', 'later', 'feels', 'compelled', 'point', 'out', 'veneer', 'citizens', 'Gotham.Nolan', 'would', 'like', 'think', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'close', 'corrupted', 'Joker', 'would', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'Thus', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'amoral', 'savagery', 'then', 'Batman', 'conscience', 'Batman', 'choice', 'so', 'many', 'Americans', 'have', 'had', 'make', 'face', 'assault', 'freedoms', 'Batman', 'principles', 'rules', 'referred', 'film', 'fact', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'easier/happier', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'principles', 'sacrifice.This', 'need', 'sacrifice', 'underscored', 'moving', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'large', 'group', 'Gotham', 'citizens', 'basically', 'put', 'maniacally', 'malevolent', 'experiment', 'Joker', 'where', 'must', 'become', 'mass', 'murderers', 'die', 'Joker', 'ultimately', 'left', 'disappointed', 'experiment', 'not', 'cost', 'film', 'characters', 'not', 'sacrifice.Despite', 'many', 'excellent', 'action', 'Dark', 'Knight', ""n't"", 'one', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'where', 'audiences', 'leave', 'theaters', 'feeling', 'exhilarated', 'pumped', 'up', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'more', 'likely', 'feel', 'drained', 'walk', 'door', 'Dark', 'Knight', ""n't"", 'simply', 'take', 'emotional', 'ride', 'ethical', 'ultimately', 'introspective', 'ride', 'as', 'well']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

First day, middle of the theatre, waiting patiently and anxiously.And if I am being totally honest with you, I was bored to tears.I didn't really think anymore about the movie, if I'm being honest with you, until, while bored one day, sitting alone in my apartment, I noticed my roommates copy of ""The Dark Knight"" sitting on the top of the Blu-Ray player. I thought to myself, ""well, maybe I was wrong and I was just letting the hype get in the way."" So I put it in and started it and watched the entire thing again.And was once again bored to tears.Now I know that many people view this film as some modern version of ""The Godfather"" or ""Casablanca"", but I just can't buy into it. What I see is a mediocre version of ""Heat"" with a great performance from the late Heath Ledger, but a movie where everyone else flounders with one dimensional roles and broad characterizations.Of the main cast only Ledger really brings anything interesting to his role, an astonishing thing seeing as the role he has is one note throughout. Christian Bale as Batman is a dull as Val Kilmer, while Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman both appear to be cashing checks. Aaron Eckhart plays his part as Harvey Dent surprisingly well, seeing as it is a different sort of role than what I have seen him in before (Neil LaBute movies mostly), but can't do much with his transformation as Two Face. Some of that may have to do with Maggie Gyleenhaal, usually a reliable actor, who looks bored and unsure of how to play her part in this movie.Storywise, I just wasn't engrossed with the story of ""The Dark Knight"". For the most part I wondered how much nonsense the Nolan brothers were trying to shove into one movie. The story continues on and on and seems like it's trying to say something major, but never does. To add to that, to me, it seems like anytime the narrative seems to be gaining steam, the movie throws in another action scene and it loses all narrative movement.To add to that, Nolan still has yet to find out how to shoot action scenes effectively and coherantly, and problem that also plagued the superior ""Batman Begins"".I wanted to like ""The Dark Knight"", I did. I just couldn't. I guess nothing is for everyone.

This movie only gets all the love because {and no offense intended} of Heath ledger's death, strip away the cgi effects, the 45 minute speeches. And you don't have a Batman movie, but a psychosis on Batman and the joker. Neither resembled the characters they were supposed to be based on, in fact. watching this movie, heath's joker reminded me of a character off of ""Criminal minds"". Not the joker, and this Batman is not a detective. Some of the people who applauded this movie, are the same ones who laughed at the ending to ""Superman the movie"" where he turns back time.

Who knows what 3D smell-o-vision VR format they will be watching their modern narrative films on, but, like classic novels, SOME movies from the last 100 years will be consumed by the general pubic? We are not talking about what the future film scholars will be watching (ie, ""Birth of a Nation""), but just really good films with popular appeal; eg Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Godfather, Star Wars trilogy, Annie Hall, Schindler's List...""fill in the blank"".  The list won't be long, maybe 10 to 20 films from the last 100 years, but The Dark Knight, IMHO, is certainly a candidate for that list.Let's be realistic; it is nowhere near the greatest story ever told on celluloid; but it is near perfect in theme & execution. It avoids all the common pitfalls of big budget 'Hollywood' movies and leaves one actually challenged to find fault with it. Yes, it is a comic book movie and with that comes an automatic simplification of human psychology & interaction compared to more esoteric films with gut-wrenchingly realistic human characters.But that was Shakespeare play field too; the dumbing down of real characters to fit into larger sociological themes encapsulating the zeitgeist of it's time & still remain entertaining. Any playwright scholar will tell you The Bard was the ""Summer Blockbuster"" writer of his time.So what leads a movie to be become a time capsule for the ages? A flawless story encapsulating dramatic characters, themes, cinematography, & soundtrack? Of course, but there is an 'It' factor that no one has yet to quantify but given the especially unusual enthusiastic embrace this film received from fans, critics, & people not usually drawn to the genre, the 'It"" factor can definitely be checked off that list. Did you find yourself discussing the film & what it's larger commentary was? When most viewers of the film are engaged in similar conversations coming out of the theater you know the film has more then just a 'popcorn movie' impact on the greater culture at large.How about fun & entertaining? Some of greats struggle to qualify on that level but yet they still remain great films people eagerly consume. But being 'fun' can only help its long term consideration. Is there any doubt The Dark Knight is a VERY entertaining roller coaster?So what is left to argued? Hard to say but time certainly plays a factor in how the culture ultimately digests a film & incorporates into the larger zeitgeist. There will be more Batman sequels to follow & those films will probably play a role in how The Dark Knight is viewed from a distance. The disasters of Jaws 2 through 4 did not effect the original's place in cinematic history, but yet many believe the Star Wars prequels or the last Indiana Jones film did permanent damage to the long term view of their franchises as a whole.So it's really all a big question mark for this films long term success but 99.99% of films, even good ones, do not even make it out of the starting gate of that race.

659210,A3KUEXN9M9FOMH,B00005JPY0,billy,"[6, 9]","So is this a full blown movement now?  Super pessimistic and dark movies where the heroes and villains are equally corrupt, where things end badly, and the viewer is left feeling like they've just watched their dog get shot?  We can call it New American Pessimism.  In the grand tradition of last year's critical darlings There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men, we have The Dark Knight.I won't summarize the plot, one because there is a ton of plot, and two because there are countless reviews where you can read it for yourself.  The Dark Knight is a well made and polished movie that has some weighty themes and some very good acting.  Yet somehow, for all of the superlatives lavished on it, it leaves me a bit cold.  On paper, this is the Batman I've always hoped for.  I prefer Frank Miller's or Allan Moore's take, and this movie is a bit of both.  We get the non-stop action and brooding psychology of Miller's Batman, and the next level psychosis of Moore's Joker.  So what's not to love?There is a ton to love about The Dark Knight.  First off, Heath Ledger owns this movie.  His Joker is much different than any other screen portrayal and his distinctive look and characteristics make his the definitive version.  It's like he channeled Moore's Killing Joke Joker, M's Peter Lorre's shuffling and ticks, and A Clockwork Orange's Malcom McDowell's bemused contempt for humanity in to one monster of a villain.  His look is also fantastic.  The broken makeup, the stringy hair, and the Glasgow Smile give me the creeps.  Ledger's Joker is completely impenetrable.  He's completely amoral, seemingly has no past, and all he seems to care about is causing chaos.  In Alfred's words, ""some people just want to watch the world burn.""  He's the perfect embodiment of the assertion that Batman and The Joker are two sides of the same coin.  Ledger expresses this in several disturbing speeches, about how they're both the same, how they're both excellent at what they do, and how they're destined to meet again and again because neither will back down or compromise in the slightest.  I've always wanted this to be explored in film, and at least from the Joker's side of things, I'm more than pleased.On the Batman side however, I'm slightly disappointed.  It's not that Christian Bale did a poor job, it's just they packed so much in to it that Batman's perspective on his relationship to the Joker seemed hurried and undeveloped.  He mused briefly about what he must become to stop the Joker, and thinks about quitting for about 10 minutes, and then he's off to do some death defying action sequences.  To me, it seems like another movie was planned where Batman's side was more the focus instead of the Joker's, but because of Ledger's untimely death they decided to give Batman some token philosophical musings.  Plus his voice was just painful.  Tone your growl down a bit for the next movie Christian.And that's a big problem in this movie, it's very overstuffed.  It's very long, and a very long movie has no right to be that crammed full of stuff.  Some of the plot points seemed to go by in a blur, and I admit that I sort of glossed over some of them.  But to it's credit, it does a heck of a lot better cramming in everything and the kitchen sink better than Spiderman 3, which felt corny and undeveloped.  I think the movie would have been more enjoyable if it was scaled back a bit.The supporting actors were mostly good.  Aaron Eckhart was a lot better than expected as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldmann, who's always good really, played James Gordon very well again, and Michael Caine did well with the little he had to work with.  Maggie Gyllenhall is getting a bunch of flack, and it seems mainly because of her looks, but she was miles better than Katie Holmes.  The action was generally well shot, but kind of chaotic.  Again, it suffered a bit from having a too much going on.  The opening sequence, with its direct references to Heat was amazing though.What I'm trying to understand is the purpose of the grim world view in movies like The Dark Knight and No Country for Old Men. Is it some attempt to articulate some great anxiety about the world we live in? You could always counter that it's just a movie, and just a comic book movie at that, but surely Christopher Nolan was aiming for art here, not just popcorn entertainment.So why such a bleak world view?  My guess is that villains like The Joker and Anton Chigurh are suppose to be symbols for indiscriminate violence and terrorism. They're more forces of nature than actual people. But the Joker isn't a terrorist with any specific political goals like a real world terrorist. He's more like mad scientist, arranging things just to see what happens, so the terror is the means and the end. But he's also portrayed as the criminal pushing back at the pressure Batman pushed on him, so in some ways Batman is responsible for The Joker. It's been said before than America is responsible for the threat of terrorism that it's under, so maybe this is commentary on America's ""vigilantism"" in the world.Anyway, The Dark Knight is definitely a fine film that deserves to be seen, especially for Ledger's iconic portrayal of The Joker.",4,A Mostly Excellent Movie with a Bleak World View,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,5210,"['So',

659213,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00005JPY0,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","Really, what can I say that hasn't been said already?? The Dark Knight is a wonderful movie that, definitely, lives up to all the hype that surrounds it. Perfect casting, superior storytelling and a unique take on The Dark Knight makes this movie seem spookily real. I got to admit, when I went to the big screen premiere, there were many times that I contemplated getting up and walking out during the movie 'cause the intensity was getting to me. Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker manages to hit you emotionally as a truly sadistic force that's evil and believable. When I first heard sometime back that Ledger was going to play The Joker; I, like everyone else, was wondering ""Why him?"". I've seen several of his movies but never seen him play a demented ruthless killer like The Joker before. I truly thought that he couldn't pull it off yet he more than did. He gave a performance that is definitely Oscar Worthy. The story itself goes a little something like this...Batman sets out to destroy organized crime in Gotham city with the help of Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They soon find themselves facing a ruthless criminal mastermind known as The Joker, who only has one intention on his mind...to bring an end to The Batman. The movie itself is supposed to take place mere days/weeks(it's unclear as to which) after the events in Batman Begins.I really love Chris Nolan's take on Batman. It's treated more seriously than anything else that's come before it. That's not to say that I never liked the other movies as I've got my favorites. With Nolan's take, you see how Batman is conflicted with the fact he's fighting an endless battle against crime. He's a broken and damaged person who's trying his best to make sense of what life he's been given. Again, in saying, making it all the more believable.The movie itself stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal. It's won all manner of awards thus far from The American Film Institue, The Golden Globes, Broadcast Film Critics Association, The People's Choice Awards, and more. It clocks in at  nearly two and a half hours and is a movie that I'd strongly suggest not letting the younger set watch. There's a ton of violence in the movie that might upset them if seen. Given, there's practically no blood in the movie but there are plenty of scenes of extreme intensity that will get to them, believe me. I've seen all mannner of intense and graphic movies in my time, especially horror movies, and not one ever got to me quite as much as this one did.I, like everyone else, can't wait to see the next movie to follow up to The Dark Knight. Hopefully, we won't have seen the last of Two-Face. Although evidence in the movie points to his demise.So, do I recommend this movie? Indeed, I do. You'll love it as much as I did.

This was one dark, violent, scary, intense and emotionally draining experience.  Obviously I had to see it again to absorb it all.  Such is the nature of Christopher Nolan's follow up to 2005's Batman Begins.  This is no mere comic book/superhero flick.  The film is as layered and complex as it is tense and entertaining.Much of the praise the film has received has been centered around the posthumous performance of Heath Ledger, and rightfully so.  This is Ledger's greatest performance in a career that was cut tragically short.  His portrayal of the Joker is one for the ages.  With his smeared clown makeup, greasy hair and scarred smile, the Joker dominates this film like few other villians have ever done.  Ledger loses himself deep within the skin of this character.  So convincing is his performance that you may find yourself wondering if it really is Ledger giving this performance.  What makes the Joker so memorable is his lack of motive.  With no backstory or psychological profile to give the audience any idea of who he is, he shows up in Gotham and starts wrecking havoc.  His only motivation seems to be the sheer anarchist kick he gets out of his actions.  As Michael Caine's Alfred puts it at one point, he just likes to watch the world burn.  Even more disturbing about the Joker is that he realizes that Batman is his counterpoint, the yin to his yang.  At one point he declares to the Caped Crusader that ""you complete me"".  It's funny....for about a second until you realize that the Joker is completely serious.  He needs Batman to challenge him and push him to new levels of depravity.  It's almost as if the Dark Knight is his muse.I could go on and on about the brillance of Ledger's performance, but the movie has a lot more going for it as well.  Nolan's direction is flawless.  He balances explosive action sequences and deeply emotional moments with the greatest of ease.  The screenplay grounds the film in realism and lends it an incredible amount of moral ambiguity and complexity.  The performances are stellar from the entire cast.  Christian Bale actually has the thankless task of keeping the hero from being completely marginalized by the film's fascinating villian, and he does a fine job.  There is also strong work from Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman and Maggie Gylenhall.When it is all said and done, Nolan and company have rewritten the rules for superhero films and Hollywood blockbusters in general.  This film proves that big budget films can be challenging, dark, disturbing and leave the audience with no easy answers.  And they can do this while being amazingly entertaining.  The Joker might have longed to give Gotham a better class of villian, but Christopher Nolan and company have given us a better class of commercial of filmmaking.",5,A new standard,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,2892,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'last', 'summer', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'was', 'one', 'dark', 'violent', 'scary', 'intense', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'experience', 'Obviously', 'had', 'see', 'again', 'absorb', 'Such', 'nature', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'follow', 'up', '2005', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'mere', 'comic', 'book/superhero', 'flick', 'film', 'layered', 'complex', 'tense', 'entertaining.Much', 'praise', 'film', 'received', 'been', 'centered', 'posthumous', 'performance', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'rightfully', 'so', 'Ledger', 'greatest', 'performance', 'career', 'was', 'cut', 'tragically', 'short', 'portrayal', 'Joker', 'one', 'ages', 'smeared', 'clown', 'makeup', 'greasy', 'hair', 'scarred', 'smile', 'Joker', 'film', 'few', 'other', 'villians', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'Ledger', 'deep', 'skin', 'character', 'convincing', 'performance', 'may', 'find', 'wondering', 'really', 'Ledger', 'giving', 'performance', 'What', 'Joker', 'memorable', 'lack', 'motive', 'backstory', 'psychological', 'profile', 'give', 'audience', 'idea', 'who', 'up', 'Gotham', 'wrecking', 'havoc', 'only', 'motivation', 'be', 'sheer', 'anarchist', 'kick', 'actions', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred', 'one', 'point', 'just', 'watch', 'world', 'burn', 'Even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'Joker', 'Batman', 'counterpoint', 'yin', 'yang', 'one', 'point', 'Caped', 'Crusader', 'complete', 'funny', 'second', 'realize', 'Joker', 'completely', 'serious', 'Batman', 'challenge', 'push', 'new', 'levels', 'depravity', 'almost', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'muse.I', 'could', 'go', 'brillance', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'as', 'well', 'Nolan', 'direction', 'flawless', 'explosive', 'action', 'sequences', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'moments', 'greatest', 'ease', 'screenplay', 'film', 'realism', 'incredible', 'amount', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'complexity', 'performances', 'are', 'stellar', 'entire', 'cast', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'actually', 'thankless', 'task', 'keeping', 'hero', 'being', 'completely', 'marginalized', 'film', 'fascinating', 'villian', 'fine', 'job', 'also', 'strong', 'work', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Maggie', 'Gylenhall.When', 'said', 'done', 'Nolan', 'company', 'have', 'rewritten', 'rules', 'superhero', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'general', 'film', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'challenging', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'leave', 'audience', 'easy', 'answers', 'can', 'do', 'being', 'amazingly', 'entertaining', 'Joker', 'might', 'have', 'longed', 'give', 'Gotham', 'better', 'class', 'villian', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'company', 'have', 'given', 'better', 'class', 'commercial', 'filmmaking']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659218,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JPY0,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 6]","Batman is back. And so is director Christoperh Nolan who directed the amazingBatman Begins. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's previous Batman film, I felt confident he'd never be able to surpass it. I was horribly wrong.The dark sets. The amazing acting (with one exception). The wonderful dialogue. It was a sheer joy to watch. And the fact that it was 152 minutes long didn't bother me in the slightest. The action was practically nonstop with enough plot twists, explosions, and funny lines to make one cringe and laugh at the same time.The big question, though, on many people's minds (including my own before I watched it) was ""Is Heath Ledger's performance that good or are the critics just being nice after Ledger's unfortunate death?"" Hollywood has a history of doing stuff like this where they honor someone for an achievement that really wasn't deserved, but they felt sorry for the performer's family, etc. and decided to throw them a bone by overly-praising a performance or a life that wasn't particularly notable. I was concerned that this might be the case for Ledger's Joker. But my worries were immediately stripped away as soon as The Joker made his appearance. Creepy. Funny. Line delivery that'll blow your mind (""See, I'm not a monster...I'm just ahead of the curve.""). Ledger's performance put all others in his shadow (yes that includes Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman).Christian Bale (3:10 to Yuma) has now become synonymous with what Batman means to movie-goers and comic book fans alike. He plays the cocky, rich, and uncompromising Bruce Wayne with the perfect amount of grace and toughness the role deserves. The only downside is his heavily whispered Batman voice that grates on the nerves after a short while.Michael Caine (Children of Men) and Gary Oldman (Harry Potter) reprise their roles and do so with the talent we've all come to expect from these two fine actors. Morgan Freeman (Gone Baby Gone) returns as Lucius Fox, Batman's weapons designer and conscious. Although not particularly riveting, his performance did help move the plot along.An addition to the cast was introduced with the arrival of Harvey Dent/Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart,Conversations With Other Women). Exquisitely incorporated into the story, the uncovering of Two-Face's origins is masterfully pulled into the story and given ample screen time.The only less-than-stellar performance came from Maggie Gyllenhaal (Stranger Than Fiction) who replaced Katie Holmes (First Daughter) in the role of Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne's love interest. Although no fan of Katie Holmes, I found Gyllenhaal's performance to be relatively unmoving in comparison to the rest of the cast. That's probably not a knock against Gyllenhaal considering the entire production held some of the strongest roles I've seen this year. But no one came close to Ledger and his wonderful performance, least of all Gyllenhaal.If you're looking for the action film of the year with one of the best performances by an actor that is no longer with us, The Dark Knight is the ticket.

Yet, some people are calling it the greatest movie ever. Get real. The good news is that all the zealous hype about Heath Ledger's performance is true. He's simply great as the Joker. Every single scene Ledger is in sings. Unfortunately, some of the non-Joker scenes feature a lot of what failed in prior Batman films.  The film suffers on a few fronts. One, there is little emotional connection between any of the characters (especially the limp love triangle emotional misfire). Two, the thirty minutes or so of the Two-Face revenge stuff just sap the energy gained by Ledger's Joker and screams ""overkill"" to me. Don't get me wrong, I consider it an enjoyable, dark movie that deserves a spot among anyone's top five comic adaptation lists.

Your eyes will be glued as every plot, every twist of storyline is revealed. Heath ledger RIP does deserves that Oscar no offense to Jack's Joker in the First Batman (Tim Burton Film) in 89, which was brilliantly done. But Heath nails the Joker's dark psyche to a tee. This is not a film that you should take any kid under 10, 11 yrs of age to, because it's dark and violent and may scare them to death (no pun intended) that being said, the violence is a lot tamer I think then Batman Returns and hardly shows any blood and shows no people directly getting shot (But the choice is in the parents hands if they want to take their kids to it). But this is one film that's a wonderful treat and for those of you who saw Batman Begins this one is even better. The cast does a wonderful job and the most reason to go is the action/stunts in this film, hardly any CGI in this film which is a good thing, because a lot of time usually computer generated effects can bog down a good action picture and make it look cheesy or plain stupid, in which stunts (the real thing) can deliver the goods and let us not forget a the story this screenplay is top notch.

I think at this point, if anyone doesn't already know it, they've been hiding in a cave somewhere.The movie is enjoyable; that's the real problem. It's merely ""enjoyable"".It's very big budget, and the production values are all right up there on the screen for all to see. The acting is first-rate; the special effects are awesome; the cinematography is Oscar level; I REALLY wanted to love this movie!The problem is, it's a sequel to a truly epic movie in the first installment, ""Batman Begins"". There was a broad and sweeping story arc in the first movie that simply isn't there in this one.As has been noted elsewhere, in this story we're essentially reduced to Batman dealing with the minutiae of battling a tough adversary, with none of the classic thematic elements of great drama. It's a small tale writ large.Yes, he runs into some logistical problems, but they seem to be addressed very facilely. His personal conflicts and love life are given very short shrift, which means his humanity as a character is undermined.But by far the biggest failure is in the philosophical underpinnings of the story. In the first installment, we watched his development at the feet of his mentor, who turned out to be a villain, and the conflict that entailed for Batman.There was an attempt in this film to raise similar issues in the guise of ""vigilantism"", but in trying to use such a nihilistic, chaotic and anarchic character as Heath Ledger's Joker as the foil, the effort failed... badly.What we end up with is a lot of cool gadgets, a lot of running around and shooting, a few attempts at misleading the audience with faked deaths, and not much else.Another unfortunate thought that occurs to me: so far, this series is following a similar pattern as the first series that started with Michael Keaton as Batman. A great first movie, in that case directed by Tim Burton at his peak. But that series went downhill episode by episode, until it ended up being almost as ""camp"" as the `60s TV series.I hope we're not seeing a repeat of that fiasco.",3,"Big budget, but a ""small"" story; nowhere near the scope of ""Batman Begins"".

Returning to the fold, as well, is Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon who enlists additional aid in the guise of Gotham's daring new District Attorney Harvey Dent. Dent, portrayed impeccably by the incomparable Aaron Eckhart, is hellbent on bringing down as many crime-lords as he possibly can. That campaign is quickly and boldly challenged by a rising criminal mastermind known only as ""The Joker,"" who aims to thrust Gotham City into ceaseless chaos and force its brooding Caped Crusader into crossing that fine line between praised hero and reviled vigilante.Make no mistake. This is every bit as gripping and character-driven as its immediate predecessor. You have Christopher Nolan's masterful storytelling coupled, once again, with the outstanding talents of a first-rate cast nobody could even remotely request any better of. The standout performance here, it should go without saying, is that of the late Heath Ledger. Forget everything you already know about Jack Nicholson's legendary Joker performance. Mr. Ledger takes the character to a brand new level of disturbing realism that no film in this franchise has ever previously explored. It's equal parts dramatic and, at some points, downright creepy. He really knocked it out of the park.The overall tone of this movie is what ultimately makes it so very satisfying.

As this movie spins more and more out of control toward total chaos, the tension ratchets up to an all but unbearable degree.  For me, the climax of this movie comes as Batman mounts his Batpod, an armored motorcycle, and chases the Joker through Gotham.  From this point on, the film becomes frantic, terrifying, intense, and mesmerizing.The whole city of Gotham is turned on its head in anarchy, as is the Joker himself finally, by Batman when he suspends the Joker from a cable upside down from a skyscraper in the dead of night.The proponent of chaos, the Joker, ends up hanging upside down, spinning and laughing maniacally in space, without any sense of direction--the perfect ending image for the nihilistic Joker.Heath Ledger is nothing short of brilliant with his chilling portrayal of the maleficent, unhinged Joker.  He cringes and leaps about like a dynamic psychotic fiend, propelling the nonstop action farther and farther into the abyss--from which there is no escape without Batman, the reluctant hero crippled by self-doubt.This is the best comic-book movie I've ever seen.

659244,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JPY0,Caleb Williams,"[1, 3]","There are many people that would gladly shut down this film saying it's surrounded by unjust hype simply because it's the last role of Heath Ledger. I have to say that a statement such as this couldn't be anymore false. Sure, the hype was bigger due to the untimely death of Ledger. But it was a movie and a role (Joker) that delivered on all levels. Batman Begins introduced us to the troubled man that is Bruce Wayne and told the story of how he becomes The Batman. Batman Begins, although very well put together and the story being told brilliantly; I found that at times it had moments when it would drag. The Dark Knight repairs those problems and gives us a movie of equal length, that manages to hold my attention throughout. My review will be split into three sections. The story, the characters and the verdict. This is to give you, the reader a fair and open opinion of the movie for which you can place your own opinion.The Story: A year after the chaos caused by Ra's Al Ghul, the Batman has become a symbol in Gotham for all citizens. It's a symbol to show that nobody needs to be afraid when confronted with the criminal underworld of Gotham. This is a problem for Batman as it's created a lot of copy cat vigilantes. Unfortunately, the copy cat attempts don't go as well as the Batmans attempts do. Batman has inspired even the law to fight against the mob underworld as the new District Attorney in town, Harvey Dent is determined to put the mob behind bars. The fight will be even harder than first thought as a man known only as the Joker, isn't interested in financial gain. He's just interested in creating chaos and he breeds a new class of criminal.The Characters: I'm not going to talk about the Batman character, as simply it's not the most interesting character in this film. Surprisingly. I am, however, going to talk about the ""supporting"" cast in this movie.The Joker (Heath Ledger): This is easily the most intimidating villain in movie history. Even more so than Hannibal Lecter portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. The voice, the look and the body language are all done superbly by Ledger. They blend together brilliantly in order to create a very believable psychopath. The back story of the Joker isn't touched in this film, as in the comic universe it's never been confirmed 100% of how the Joker came about. The Joker, in order to achieve his goal of killing the Batman he must employ the help of the mob. He doesn't have the money but he has the skill of intimidation and the callousness the frighten, even the mob into working for him.Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart): I have to admit, I've never been a fan of Eckhart as most of his movies preceding Dark Knight have been mediocre at best. He wins my vote in his role as Harvey Dent; the fearless District Attorney who, thanks to the work by Batman is willing to put his life on the line to put the mob behind bars. His transformation from respected DA into the broken ""Two-Face"" is inspiring and really seals him as a legitimate actor and a legitimate role.Gordon (Gary Oldman): Oldman plays a much bigger role as Gordon in this movie. He's someone who becomes more involved in shaping the Batman character from hero to vigilante. It's a much more likable role this time around and has bigger impact when confronted with the Harvey Dent alter-ego ""Two-Face""The Verdict: I honestly love this film. Unlike the first installment, this never stops. From the opening we're treated to a great bank robbery that gives us the genius and craziness of Joker. This has its truly heart wrenching moments, but I'm not going to mention them as they give away the plot. I was a little disappointed by the very small and quite frankly, pointless cameo of Scarecrow. Although a beaten shell of a man I would have liked to see him have a darker and more prominent role once again in this picture. Apart from that it's a non-stop genius picture and something that lives up to the hype. The role of Ledger lives up to the bill and is something that could win Heath his first and only Oscar. This makes it more unfortunate that we no longer have Ledger with us to feel the glory created by his Joker.",5,Amazing,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,4156,"['are', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'gladly', 'shut', 'down', 'film', 'saying', 'surrounded', 'unjust', 'hype', 'simply', 'last', 'role', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'have', 'say', 'statement', 'such', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'anymore', 'false', 'Sure', 'hype', 'was', 'bigger', 'due', 'untimely', 'death', 'Ledger', 'was', 'movie', 'role', 'Joker', 'delivered', 'levels', 'Batman', 'introduced', 'troubled', 'man', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'told', 'story', 'how', 'Batman', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'brilliantly', 'found', 'times', 'had', 'moments', 'when', 'would', 'drag', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'repairs', 'problems', 'movie', 'equal', 'length', 'hold', 'attention', 'My', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'split', 'three', 'sections', 'story', 'characters', 'verdict', 'give', 'reader', 'fair', 'open', 'opinion', 'movie', 'can', 'place', 'own', 'opinion.The', 'Story', 'year', 'chaos', 'caused', 'Ra', 'Al', 'Ghul', 'Batman', 'become', 'symbol', 'Gotham', 'citizens', 'symbol', 'show', 'nobody', 'be', 'afraid', 'when', 'confronted', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'Gotham', 'problem', 'Batman', 'created', 'lot', 'copy', 'cat', 'vigilantes', 'Unfortunately', 'copy', 'cat', 'attempts', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'well', 'Batmans', 'attempts', 'do', 'Batman', 'inspired', 'even', 'law', 'fight', 'mob', 'underworld', 'new', 'District', 'Attorney', 'town', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'determined', 'put', 'mob', 'bars', 'fight', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'harder', 'first', 'thought', 'man', 'known', 'only', 'Joker', ""n't"", 'interested', 'financial', 'gain', 'just', 'interested', 'creating', 'chaos', 'new', 'class', 'criminal.The', 'Characters', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'talk', 'Batman', 'character', 'simply', 'not', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'Surprisingly', 'am', 'however', 'going', 'talk', 'supporting', 'cast', 'movie.The', 'Joker', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'easily', 'most', 'intimidating', 'villain', 'movie', 'history', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'portrayed', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'voice', 'look', 'body', 'language', 'are', 'done', 'superbly', 'Ledger', 'blend', 'together', 'brilliantly', 'order', 'create', 'very', 'believable', 'psychopath', 'back', 'story', 'Joker', ""n't"", 'touched', 'film', 'comic', 'universe', 'never', 'been', 'confirmed', '100', '%', 'how', 'Joker', 'came', 'about', 'Joker', 'order', 'achieve', 'goal', 'killing', 'Batman', 'must', 'employ', 'help', 'mob', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'skill', 'intimidation', 'callousness', 'frighten', 'even', 'mob', 'working', 'him.Harvey', 'Dent', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'have', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Eckhart', 'most', 'movies', 'preceding', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'have', 'been', 'mediocre', 'best', 'vote', 'role', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'fearless', 'District', 'Attorney', 'who', 'thanks', 'work', 'Batman', 'willing', 'put', 'life', 'line', 'put', 'mob', 'bars', 'transformation', 'respected', 'DA', 'broken', 'Two-Face', 'inspiring', 'really', 'seals', 'legitimate', 'actor', 'legitimate', 'role.Gordon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Oldman', 'much', 'bigger', 'role', 'Gordon', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'involved', 'shaping', 'Batman', 'character', 'hero', 'vigilante', 'much', 'more', 'likable', 'role', 'time', 'around', 'bigger', 'impact', 'when', 'confronted', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'alter-ego', 'Two-Face', 'Verdict', 'honestly', 'love', 'film', 'first', 'installment', 'never', 'opening', ""'re"", 'treated', 'great', 'bank', 'robbery', 'genius', 'craziness', 'Joker', 'truly', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'moments', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'mention', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'very', 'small', 'quite', 'frankly', 'pointless', 'cameo', 'Scarecrow', 'beaten', 'shell', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'have', 'darker', 'more', 'prominent', 'role', 'once', 'again', 'picture', 'Apart', 'non-stop', 'genius', 'picture', 'something', 'up', 'hype', 'role', 'Ledger', 'up', 'bill', 'something', 'could', 'win', 'Heath', 'first', 'only', 'Oscar', 'more', 'unfortunate', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'Ledger', 'feel', 'glory', 'created', 'Joker']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659245,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00005JPY0,calvinnme,"[3, 7]","This film and Wall-E are the best of 2008 so far, in my opinion. They're certainly the only two I thought were worth going to the theater to see and the only two worth owning. Having received my copy of Wall-E, I still feel that way about that film. As for this one - not so much.""The Dark Knight"" is a very inventive film, though somewhat misnamed. I didn't think that Batman was that dark. That title goes to Batman's nemesis, ""The Joker"". A much talkier Joker than Jack Nicholson's 1989 incarnation, we see this Joker as someone who just enjoys destruction, a truly dark figure indeed whose jokes had me feeling uneasy with myself for laughing at them where Nicholson was obviously just trying to approach dark camp in his version. I doubt it will even get nominated for Best Picture - doubtless it will be nominated for those awards reserved for action films that the Academy doesn't deem worthy of its highest honor - Best Sound, Best Art Direction, etc. However, I hope that Ledger's Joker does not get overlooked. The greatness of his performance is not being overblown due to his untimely death. It just marries a great tragedy to a performance that I thought could not have topped what he accomplished in ""Brokeback Mountain"", but at least tied it.Now for the DVD. Warner Bros. usually puts out much better DVD presentations than this. This is exactly what you are getting in the two disc edition:Disc 1: The film and nothing else.Disc 2:1. Gotham Uncovered: Creation of a Scene- How Christopher Nolan and His team developed the new Bat-Suit and the amazing Bat-pod, AND Composer Hans Zimmer on musically characterizing the Joker's Reign of Chaos.2. The Dark Knight IMAX scenes - view these 6 action-packed sequences - shot on the largest format possible - in their original IMAX framing, just as they were intended: Prologue, Hong Kong, Armored Car Chase, Lamborghini Crash, Prewitt Building and Final Montage.3. Gotham Tonight - 6 Episodes of Gotham Cable's Premier News Program4. The Galleries - Poster Art, Production Stills, TrailersThus there is no commentary on the film at all and not much in the way of extra features. I can figure only two explanations for this:1. Warner Home Video is channeling MGM/UA for some reason and has suddenly forgotten that presentation matters.2. Warner Home Video feels like they are doing all of us non Blu-Ray customers a favor by even giving us a standard DVD presentation and this is all part of an effort to push us towards buying overpriced Blu for everything all of the time.My recommendation: Rent this film, do not buy it, especially if you are a standard DVD customer.I arrived at my score of 3 stars as follows:5 stars for the film2 stars for the presentationAverage = 3.5I round down to 3 because it couldn't have been that hard to put meaningful extras on such a recent film that Warners knew was likely to be a blockbuster.",3,5 star film is given a two star DVD treatment,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,2886,"['film', 'Wall-E', 'are', 'best', '2008', 'so', 'far', 'opinion', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'only', 'two', 'thought', 'were', 'worth', 'going', 'theater', 'see', 'only', 'two', 'worth', 'owning', 'Having', 'received', 'copy', 'Wall-E', 'still', 'feel', 'way', 'film', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'very', 'inventive', 'film', 'somewhat', 'misnamed', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Batman', 'was', 'dark', 'title', 'Batman', 'nemesis', 'Joker', 'much', 'talkier', 'Joker', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', '1989', 'incarnation', 'see', 'Joker', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'destruction', 'truly', 'dark', 'figure', 'indeed', 'jokes', 'had', 'feeling', 'uneasy', 'laughing', 'where', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'obviously', 'just', 'trying', 'approach', 'dark', 'camp', 'version', 'doubt', 'will', 'even', 'get', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'doubtless', 'will', 'be', 'nominated', 'awards', 'reserved', 'action', 'films', 'Academy', ""n't"", 'deem', 'worthy', 'highest', 'honor', 'Best', 'Sound', 'Best', 'Art', 'Direction', 'etc', 'However', 'hope', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'not', 'get', 'overlooked', 'greatness', 'performance', 'not', 'being', 'overblown', 'due', 'untimely', 'death', 'just', 'great', 'tragedy', 'performance', 'thought', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'topped', 'what', 'accomplished', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'least', 'tied', 'it.Now', 'DVD', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'usually', 'out', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'presentations', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'Disc', '1', 'film', 'nothing', 'else.Disc', '2:1', 'Gotham', 'Uncovered', 'Creation', 'Scene-', 'How', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'team', 'developed', 'new', 'Bat-Suit', 'amazing', 'Bat-pod', 'AND', 'Composer', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'musically', 'characterizing', 'Joker', 'Reign', 'Chaos.2', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'IMAX', 'view', '6', 'action-packed', 'sequences', 'shot', 'largest', 'format', 'possible', 'original', 'IMAX', 'framing', 'just', 'were', 'intended', 'Prologue', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Armored', 'Car', 'Chase', 'Lamborghini', 'Crash', 'Prewitt', 'Building', 'Final', 'Montage.3', 'Gotham', 'Tonight', '6', 'Episodes', 'Gotham', 'Cable', 'Premier', 'News', 'Program4', 'Galleries', 'Poster', 'Art', 'Production', 'Stills', 'TrailersThus', 'commentary', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'extra', 'features', 'can', 'figure', 'only', 'two', 'explanations', 'this:1', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'channeling', 'MGM/UA', 'reason', 'suddenly', 'forgotten', 'presentation', 'matters.2', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'feels', 'are', 'doing', 'non', 'Blu-Ray', 'customers', 'favor', 'even', 'giving', 'standard', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'part', 'effort', 'push', 'buying', 'overpriced', 'Blu', 'everything', 'time.My', 'recommendation', 'Rent', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'especially', 'are', 'standard', 'DVD', 'customer.I', 'arrived', 'score', '3', 'stars', 'follows:5', 'stars', 'film2', 'stars', 'presentationAverage', '=', '3.5I', 'round', 'down', '3', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'put', 'meaningful', 'extras', 'recent', 'film', 'Warners', 'knew', 'was', 'likely', 'be', 'blockbuster']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

(Incidentally, Dark Knight was filmed in Chicago, as was Wanted).  While the first movie established the Caped Crusader's origins and spiritual training (loved that part), Dark Knight gets right down to the business of fighting villains.""Saving Harvey Dent"" could be an accurate alternative title for the Dark Knight.  After all, most of the movie focuses on trying to protect Dent from the murderous attempts of the Joker.  If you're thinking that there must be something corrupt lurking under Aaron Eckhardt's square jaw and blonde good looks, well, you're right.The heroes and villains (at least the big ones) are clearly drawn enough, but there's a lot going on and the Joker orchestrates all of it.  The special FX are fantastic.  I loved the way they flipped the 18-wheeler, a 40 foot long trailer.  I liked the Joker's character best.  Once you've had a brush with a sociopath you recognize them immediately and the Joker's lines are true to form.  Of course his actions scream maniac, but some of his best acting is when he's not blowing things up.  True to psychopath form his goal is to elicit an emotional response from the normal folk around him and that response is not warm or fuzzy.  We see the Joker sitting in a holding cell, all hell breaking loose around him and he's as cool and collected as a cucumber.  Perfect.  But when the Joker isn't trying to break down the morals of Harvey Dent or Lt. Gordon, he's fixated on ""the Bat Man"" and trying to break him down.  A sociopath cannot stomach morality in others.  And you know how he got the smiley scars, right?  You will if you see the movie.There's a lot going on in this movie, so don't come half asleep.  I'll be glad when it comes out on DVD so I can see all the special FX extras and watch the movie without smelling the awful breath of the kid sitting next to me.

659256,A34JGR3LMV1I64,B00005JPY0,ceffalo,"[7, 10]","So, I finally saw The Dark Knight.This film attempts to do a lot. On some fronts it utterly succeeds. On several, though, it is blithely simple minded.The action is spectacular enough, but I don't really buy into the nearly perfect timing of everything, particularly around the character of the Joker. For those who don't know this film the Joker is deftly painted as Satan incarnate, and his resulting efforts at destruction are fully befitting the Evil One himself.But, the puzzle is a little too machine like, a little too perfect. There's nothing earthy about this film, as was in Batman Begins. There was far and away much more being attempted in TDK, and because they tried to do so much they actually did too much. The film suffers from repeated episodes of the bad guy doing bad things to good people over and over. I realize that in reality life very much emulates that, but in a two and half hour film I don't need to get the point more than once. Not that tragedy isn't wanted for understanding, but seriously how many versions of light versus darkness must we endure in order to finish a story?Perhaps I'm not far enough into comics to understand what's going on here, but I got the distinct impression that the writers of the film didn't want us focusing on Batman or the Joker, but on ourselves, and I came away feeling clipped like someone had just tackled me by the ankles with their feet. It just didn't come off well. It was very good action entertainment, and it packed a message anyone over the age of 14 should be able to grasp, but it was in no way worth the $500 million it earned at the box office. I think the American audience has lost it's respect for real art. What we want now are special effects and intricate plots and methods, but no actual substance. At least that's what we are getting. Films that attempt to do too much have been en vogue since Titanic came out.Perhaps I am too much of an old school entertainee. But, really, watch the original Star Wars again and recognize why these films were so good to begin with. That film did plenty with a not so obvious cast, unusual artistry in the production of action, and a budget that went for somewhat less than $20 million, even well done for 1977. And, the Star Wars enterprise could have easily taken on the concepts presented in this Batman film. In many ways it did, but the majesty of it is still unparalleled in film to this very day.

This is primarily because of people who either love the film but dislike the DVD transfer, or find the film ""overated"".Well friends, I'm here to tell you there's nothing overrated about THE DARK KNIGHT. It's not just the best superhero movie I've ever seen, but it's a truly great crime drama featuring gangsters, crooked cops and a murderous madman who calls himself The Joker!THE DARK KNIGHT picks up where BATMAN BEGINS left off, with Batman and Detective Lt. James Gordon fighting the mob. They are joined by new District Attorney Harvey Dent, who relishes the opportunity to throw Gotham's new crime boss Sal Marone and his pals behind bars. The three are successful for a while. That is, until The Joker takes over.And boy does he ever take over. He sends Gotham into chaos by challenging it's citizens into making dangerous, life and death decisions. And each major character in THE DARK KNIGHT faces their own difficult choices.The Joker is an unpredictable sociopath who compares himself at one point to a dog chasing cars...but this dog's bite is even worse than his bark. And the late Heath Ledger truly is a revelation in the role. This isn't some actor merely having fun playing an over-the-top cartoon character. Ledger is unrecognizable in voice and appearance and his performance runs much deeper than your typical screen villain. He reminds me a of the great gangster villains from the past played by the likes of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney, but much more twisted. In other words, the Joker I've always wanted to see.Aaron Eckhart is perfect as the handsome, charming and earnest prosecuter Harvey Dent. His face born for campaign ads and his political future limitless. Yet there's more than one side to Dent, and Eckhart also brings that certain edge to Dent which lends just the right intensity. His may be the underrated performance in the film. His Dent not only has a story arc well known to fans of the comic, but he basically becomes the heart of the film. We find ourselves invested in his character, which makes this movie a tragedy as much as it is a thriller.The rest of the main cast consists of mostly returning members: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are just as impressive as they were in BATMAN BEGINS. Much has been said of Bale's voice as Batman being too gravelly, but Bale has said he wanted Batman to be animalistic, which is good enough for me and besides, nobody would ever guess Batman is Bruce Wayne from the voice, that's for sure. Maggie Gyllenhaal steps in as Rachel Dawes and she comes across as a more mature version of the character than did Katie Holmes in BEGINS. She does a great job and, in at least one scene, breaks my heart.THE DARK KNIGHT has plenty of action, with mercifully few CGI effects. And fight scenes you can actually see (especially on my Blu-ray). The music is rousing, tragic and scary...ideal for THIS film! The cinematography is both intense and breathtaking. The screenplay is clever, complex and almost novelistic, with dialogue that doesn't insult your intelligence. Speaking of which, just about every line from The Joker is a masterstroke. It's a multi-layered script with multi-layered characters...even though they originate from the pages of a comic book.And this is definitely a multi-layered film thanks to Christopher Nolan's bold direction and his insistence on telling a good story. I thought his BATMAN BEGINS was excellent. This is brilliant. He pieced together a superhero story and turned it into a dark, disturbing, tragic, exciting masterpiece.

Just patting their selves on the back for making an awesome movie, it's CRAP that they would do that, if you want my opinion it's completely selfish and entirely RUDE not to mention him, also there are no interviews or comprehensive coverage of a whole lot of anything on the special features...  very disappointing, makes you feel like you wasted your money (on the 2 disc special)...

I thought the action scenes were better than Dare Devil but they weren't.  In parts they seemed to be honest, extremely slow, but perhaps that is because Batman himself doesn't really have any true super hero powers, just a desire to confront evil head on.The story line was good, but what made this movie great or parts of it great was Heath Ledger.  Prior to seeing this movie I was thinking that maybe they were considering him for a Academy Award/Oscar because of his unfortunate death.  Having now seen the movie, he certainly deserves it!He was not only convincing, but stole the show!  Much in the same manner that in Tombstone Val Kilmer who got robbed did as well!  This is definitely a movie that is worth seeing and a fitting movie to be in the Batman legacy and made even more so by the performace Heath Ledger delivered.Why Dare Devil wasn't considered by many a great movie I think has more to do with the STAR of it and his relations at the time with another Star... And not his performance which I found outstanding and true to any one that actually reads these things called comics.All the actors in this did a wonderful job and Heath if someone had to go on, left a performance I am sure seals his standing as an incredible actor.I again, wasn't impressed with the fight scenes.

I have been a Batman fan since I was old enough to read and I read my first Batman comic. I have been a major comic book geek since and have made it my goal to know everything there is to know about Batman. As a huge fan I was happy to see that this movie stayed as close to the comics as a movie can. The story was great and the action even better. There are a few discrepancies between how Two Face was born between comic mythos and the movie but it still was a great story. The casting is perfect and Christopher Nolan is the best director the Batman franchise has had.I am not a fan of Heath Ledger but in this movie he out did himself. He was the perfect Joker and It is heart breaking to see him pass. The joker is supposed to be dark and homicidal. Heath Ledger made the Joker I have grown up fearing in comics come to life on the big screen.Now the Blu-Ray release, this is a must have. The picture and sound quality on the right tv is 100 times better than the theater experience. The sound is incredible and makes you feel like you are in the middle of the action. The Blu-Ray also has special features not found on the DVD version. One of which is the hour long special from the history channel called Batman Tech. It is how Batman's gadgets could really be made with today's tech. It is well worth it to get this movie because of the great Blu-Ray features, and because the movie is worth it a million times over.

Yet, we need to slow down here.What DARK KNIGHT does, is takes the SUPERHERO movie model that has been thrown at us since the first BATMAN movie... where we're always complaining... too many villains, and drops it on its ear. There were 3 villains in DARK KNIGHT and that's not even including the table full of mob bosses and the television boss, yet what DARK KNIGHT did better than any movie is balance a dozen storylines and seamlessly morphed it into a brilliant storyline that had you on pins and needles.Then of course, Nolan had the brilliant idea to cast Ledger as JOKER. All it took was 1 or 2 scenes of the Joker and from that point on, everytime he appears on scene, you are not sure what is around the next corner, what he has up his sleeve or what maniacal, sadistic, plot he has put in motion. This, alone, makes Ledger's portrayal of the JOKER heartbreakingly brilliant. He moves beyond what a normal actor would have done with the part and becomes part of the viewers psyche. He is chaos. He is unpredictablility. He is Oscar-worthy.Unfortunately though, and what is the saddest part of the DARK KNIGHT, Ledger checked out before the world could hold him in that asteem. For ever though, DARK KNIGHT, will be the beacon to what can be done with superhero movies. You don't have to cater to children. They have cartoons.It was a 2 1/2 hour movie, and when the credits rolled, it took me some time to leave Gotham city. I was there. I was invested in the characters and their reality. There aren't too many movies that do that to me.

I think it's the greatest weakness. I thought ""Batman"" was supposed to be a comic book, an ongoing story that could only exist in outlandish DC Comic magazines. Director Christopher Nolan has made the entire concept too realistic, pretty much to the point of making a man dressed in a bat suit seem silly. It's an entertaining movie, no question, but it certainly isn't the ""Batman"" film I wanted to see; it's all melancholy and anger with almost no sense of fun. The filmmakers didn't even bother to create their own Gotham City, relying instead on the streets and skyscrapers of Chicago. This is the kind of film where I want an unrealistic city skyline with gothic architecture stretching hundreds of stories up. I want that because that's where Batman truly belongs.Despite the appearance of the Joker, ""The Dark Knight"" is not a remake of Tim Burton's (much better) 1989 version of ""Batman."" Nolan has started an entirely new film franchise, beginning in 2005 with ""Batman Begins,"" another entertaining but vastly overrated film. ""The Dark Knight"" continues to delve deeply into a completely rewritten Bruce Wayne; while he still broods over the wrongs of the past, he also thinks long and hard about the future, how the public perceives him and whether or not there's a point to what he's doing. While many perceive him as Gotham's hero, many more perceive him as a masked vigilante that does much more harm than good. The film revolves around the idea that a fine line exists between good and evil, one that Wayne threatens to cross every time his alter ego searches for crime to fight. Christian Bale's strong performance as the Caped Crusader makes this inner struggle perfectly clear.The basic plot involves Batman teaming up with Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to put a stop to organized crime in Gotham City. Their attempts prove successful, but at a heavy price--a new criminal mastermind is slowly but surely rising to power, and what's worse, he's using all three men as pawns in a twisted scheme to plunge Gotham into chaos. He's known only as the Joker (the late Heath Ledger), a makeup-wearing lunatic with greasy green hair and a custom purple-colored suit. He occasionally tells stories about how his face ended up so scarred, although I have no good reason to take the word of a homicidal maniac. For all I know, he cut up his own face while his abusive father had absolutely nothing to do with it.I'm sure a lot will be said about Ledger's next to last performance; many have already predicted an Oscar nomination. Indeed, he captured the Joker's insanity perfectly, with his messy makeup and bizarre voice and demonic cackles. What he did not capture, however, was the Joker's sillier side, the side that gleefully made use of electrocuting joy buzzers and phony flowers that squirt acid instead of water. This character is basically supposed to be a homicidal goofball. In ""The Dark Knight,"" he's just a crazy, unsympathetic clown with a bad face. This Joker is incomplete, although I blame the director for that more than I blame Ledger.Besides the Joker, Harvey Dent is the most significant side character, and this is only partly because of whom he ends up becoming; many consider him more of a hero than Batman, a white knight in a city infested with crime. But even though he wants to do the city good, something lurks deep within him, something darker and less trusting. He says he relies on chance, but the reality is that he makes his own luck, and this is something the Joker seems eager to expose and exploit. Dent has fallen in love with Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), once Bruce Wayne's love interest. Both she and Dent begin the film as strong characters that hold true to what they believe in. At one point or another, both are unsure about how they feel and are forced to make difficult decisions. To delve any further would give away too much, but rest assured it plays into the idea of what makes a genuine hero and what makes a vengeful vigilante. As Dent says during a very crucial restaurant scene, ""You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.""If only these ideas were explored in a film that was true to its origins. ""The Dark Knight"" is a fascinating crime drama, but it's not a comic book, and that's the biggest problem. Batman and the Joker are very unrealistic characters, and yet they're stuck in a film that looks, feels, and unfolds in a very realistic way. None of this is helped by heavy-handed commentaries on morality and heroism; while they do add depth and complexity to the story, they occasionally weigh the story down. Still, the cinematography is wonderful, the action is satisfying, and many of the actors are perfectly suited for a superhero film, such as Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. I'll go ahead and give it four stars. But don't ever expect me to consider it a masterpiece--in my mind, that distinction stays with Tim Burton's original film.",4,Chaos Curses the Caped Crusader,1216339200,"07 18,

659275,AN9J46667D80O,B00005JPY0,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[2, 4]","Christopher Nolan has somehow found a way to trump his previous success with Batman Begins and remakes the super-hero genre in the process, changing it from a simple battle between men in tights to something deeper, darker, and oh so much more interesting, which is saying quite a bit, because Batman Begins was an excellent film.The plot of The Dark Knight, one of the best-reviewed films of the decade, centers around the Joker, and his various games. Throughout he puts Batman and the rest of Gotham through a series of moral quandries and situations to test their ethics (and not incidentally provide some amusement for himself). Along the way, major characters die and one is horribly scarred.This film is unlike any previous super-hero movie. While things like Batman Begins, Superman, Superman II, Spider-Man 2, X-Men 2 and this summer's other great super-hero film, Iron Man (movies which are generally regarded by many, including myself, as being the best super-hero films to date), were excellent super-hero films, none of them have been exceptional artistic achievements.This film is. It tears apart the conventions of the super-hero world and peers, darkly, into our own world, showing a post-9/11 super-hero enviroment unlike any we've seen before. It's a world with a terrorist dressed in clown makeup, where the savior of the city is a man in a mask who monitors everyone's cell phone calls, and where even the whitest of knights can have the steepest of falls.There are serious layers to this movie, and a depth absent in most films, let alone ""genre"" pieces like this one. The film has received favorable comparisons to crime dramas like Heat, and LA Confidential, and though I've only seen the latter of the two, I can say that yes, it holds up favorably.Are there any real flaws to this movie? Some have criticized its 2 1/2 hour run time. I had no problem with that. Some thought Aaron Eckhart didn't make for a very convincing Harvey Dent. I mostly disagree there, though I would've liked to have seen more hints at a darker side. Though the only real complaint I have does center around his character in that I really wish his eventual fate would've been a little different.On a different note, all the praise you've heard for Heath Legder's performance is not exaggerated. Here's a man who has created a character every bit as memorable and twisted as Hannibal Lecter, but while Lecter at least had some rules, this fellow has none. You'll laugh at some of what he does, but a lot of that will be nervous laughter. If he doesn't get the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor next year, something is seriously wrong with the system. He deserves it completely. In fact, don't be surprised to see the film be nominated for Best Picture. It won't win, but it should, and probably will be, nominated.One final note, do NOT take your children to this movie. Not if they're younger than ten or so. This is an adult film with adult themes to it. The Joker alone is likely to give kids nightmares, as is what becomes of Harvey Dent. How the film escaped an R-rating, I'll never know, except that the MPAA is less likely to give one for violence than they are for sex. If there'd been some tits in this movie, now, that might've been a different story!So not for kids, but for everyone else? Go see this movie. Even if you don't like super-hero movies.

Whenever he's in the costume, he puts on this gravely voice that is so over the top, it totally destroys any scene he has to speak in.  He sounds crazier than Joker most of the time.  And the Batman costume looks like something you would see in a cheapo Godzilla movie.A lot of fuss was made about Ledger's performance - but its nothing special at all - just a combination of E.G. Robinson' Little Ceaser and Carey's the Mask.  If you don't believe me, rent Little Ceaser and you'll also see what a good movie is like at the same time.But the real prize for terrible acting and casting goes to Maggie Gyllenhaal who has absolutely no business being in feature films.  She is terrible in the part, and plain old hard on the eyes.  Who does she know?I've seen all of the Batman movies, but the Dark Knight is far and away the worst entry in the series.

659279,A3E0IFPCA7KKP9,B00005JPY0,Christopher J. Martin,"[0, 0]","I've seen this movie twice now, and honestly I believe this movie is already one of the top movies of all time.The basic story is based upon the comic book version of Batman as the original creators of the character envisioned him back in the days before World War II. If you're looking for a movie based on the Adam West or 1990s movie version of Batman, this is not it. This movie is faithful to the original creation and it's much better.Batman, played wonderfully by Christian Bale, of course is the protector of Gothmam City, a fictional version of New York City. In this movie, the Joker, played amazingly by Heath Ledger, is asked by the city's underworld to help them reclaim the city after gains against them by Batman and Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent.The action and fighting scenes are very well done. But this movie, to me, isn't about the action, it's about the story. In essence this movie is sort of a morality play under guise of an action flick. It's extremely enjoyable, but it's also a very thoughtful movie, which is why I think it'll stand up as one of the best of all time. Director Christopher Nolan is trying to tell the audience that Batman isn't a totally good hero, nor is he bad, it's all shades of gray. This undertone of thoughtfulness is what makes this movie absolutely engaging and amazing in my opinion.The only thing I didn't like about the DVD, and why it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is the complete lack of special features. There is no director's commentary or anything else we've become accustomed to on major DVD releases.

659287,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPY0,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 5]","With the unbelievable amount of hype, anticipation and unprecedented amount of revenue it made (come on, it was bound to be successful but this much?), it would be easy to label ""The Dark Knight"" as one of the most overrated movies of the year. After all, ""Titanic"" was the same way and it's directly in the way of this film being the most successful film ever and people haven't exactly been kind to James Cameron's mammoth over time. However, the sequel to ""Batman Begins"" is not only one of the best movies based on a comic book but simply a great movie period makes it quite a notable film. With a stellar case, exciting action and one of the most iconic villain performances in all of cinema, you can't exactly go wrong against this film.One of the central themes explored in the film is the idea of good people trying to live in an imperfect world and the people that are on the extreme sides and those that can move over to the other side. A new criminal has been seen in town, dubbed ""The Joker"" and instead of having an evil plot in mind, he just wants to create as much havoc and chaos as possible. Leading the charge against him and the mafia is Harvey Dent, a new District Attorney who's become the image of a hero for the city of Gotham. So much so that Bruce Wayne and his crime-fighting persona Batman might not be needed anymore but like always, not everything goes according to plan.Known for his mind-bending independent film ""Memento"", one would find it a strange choice for Christopher Nolan to being chosen as the director to bring Batman to the screen again after the awful attempts by Joel Schumacher. But while it did have its issues, ""Batman Begins"" felt like finally somebody GOT a comic book movie and knew how to not only tell the story well but also deliver the kicks that fans want to see. The sequel expands on this by not only having a lot more ambitious and layered storytelling but more exciting setpieces (the rescue of an armored truck being one) but the flaws, if there are any, are really just nitpicks. Sure the film feels a little long but when everything is so dynamic and intriguing, it doesn't matter all that much to me.Along with Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Terminator"" role and Sigourney Weaver and ""Ripley"", you can pretty much add Heath Ledger's role onto the list as a performance that will become not only iconic and legendary but even imitated and could even bring up imitators and naturally, Halloween costumes. No longer a vaudeville performer like Jack Nicholson's and even moving away from the demented kookiness of Mark Hamill in the animated series, this Joker is menacing, a bit disturbing and every bit as awesome as people make him out to be and wouldn't be surprised if he got nominated and even won. That's not to say that the entire cast is bad either since everyone brings their A game and there isn't that one weak link a la Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes from the first film. In fact, Maggie Gyllenhaal is such a better fit that I kind of lament watching Holmes' blandness when someone better would come later.But something can't be this perfect, right? Well yeah. The machinations of the planning of capturing criminals and the roundabouts and sleight-of-hand can be a little confusing as so much is needed and like Nolan's previous picture, the twist-laden ""The Prestige"", you have to really be on the ball the entire time otherwise you're left out of the loop. And let's face it, as great as he is as Bruce Wayne, his voice as Batman is near awful and you half expect him to start coughing and clearing his throat everytime he speaks. Yeah Batman needs to disguise his voice lest someone puts 2-and-2 together but really, he shouldn't talk like a cave troll.But the film rightly deserves its praises and it's easy to see why the film generated so much revenue and Ledger's performance will be remembered so.

659288,A1FJ1U5LKD87RA,B00005JPY0,"C. Lyles ""Movie Seer""","[4, 9]","Like the average and above average moviegoer, I had my expectations as the anticipation mounted and the butterflies in my stomach started to have the usual seizures.  I hoped to walk into my local movie theater and partake of a movie that would be awesome, inspiring, and breathtaking at the same time.  However, just before I entered the screening room, I realized something:  if I am truly going to get my money's worth, let go of the expectations.  It was hard to do, and in the end, the result was and is something more than satisfying.  It was an experience I will hold onto for years to come.I am not going to spoil the ride for those who still have yet to see this film by divulging details that they could see for themselves, but ""The Dark Knight,"" as far as I am concern, is a visionary masterpiece that appeals to just more than the imagination.  This film has quite a bit of everything:  drama, dark comedy, love, pain, suffering, and most importantly, truth.  Higher above all the emotional tones, truth really resonates with this film because of the insightful question that it asks:  how close to the line is our society from dangling over an edge into chaos or to walking through a stable field of social serenity?  The Batman character, from the comics to the big screen, is such an attractive character because he chooses to answer this question by helping society walk through a serene field instead.  But at what cost?  Are there really consequences for making the choices that we make, despite our good intentions?  These conundrums are just what Batman ponders each time he helps the citizens of Gotham. Christopher Nolan captures these riddles and places them with great avail in this film.  As we watch, the duel between the Joker and Batman personifies these themes, where the Joker clearly is archaic, social chaos and Batman the path to social serenity.  The battle between them is essentially the battle we all face in reality with our own society.  For these reasons, I agree with the countless other fans who enjoyed this film and offer my own high praise.Christian Bale is exceptional as Bruce Wayne / Batman.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman continue to shine in their supporting, heartfelt roles as Wayne's trusted confidantes, Alfred and Lucius Fox, respectively. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal is inspiring as Rachel Dawes.  As for the newcomers, Aaron Eckhart and the late Heath Ledger as Harvey Dent and the Joker are the characters that truly move this film.  Eckhart's performance is very exceptional.  He depicts a man whose only ambition is to bring a true sense of justice into his dark world.  Eckhart really makes you believe it, which is interesting in itself considering his character's catch phrase.  I too believe in Aaron Eckhart.  But, it is Ledger who really soars in this film.  His ""Joker"" is funny, frightening, psychotic, and ironically, genius.  Ledger's performance keeps you guessing to what the Joker will do next, and his performance raises the bar for how we can look at this character.  Ledger's death is tragic, and it is a tribute to his acting ability and career to have starred in this film.Therefore, forget those rantings of how poorly the film upholds to the comic book roots.  Forget that the Batcave is not there.  Forget that nonsense about how feasible Bale's Batman voice is.  Forget that Nolan has taken the film in a direction that the comics have not gone.  I did not pay to watch a regurgitation of what I can read in the comics whenever I feel like it.  I wanted to see something that I had not seen before, and frankly, ""The Dark Knight"" is just that.  It is something that no one until its release had seen before.  Go and enjoy it for yourself.

I saw The Dark Knight Rising on the opening midnight show (in Oklahoma) and I am planning on seeing it again tonight.  I am now even more in the mood.

(Part of the way through, I kept hoping that Spider-man would swing in and save the day!) Ordinarily, someone who appears in a costume in a movie is the hero. But in this case it's an embarrassment.

My next venture into the re-invented Batman genre by Christopher Nolan would be on blu-ray, and it was just spectacular.  The detailed clarity of this film is what the blu-ray format was intended to display, at its visual apex.  The soundtrack is equally engaging, and is appropriately married to the picture quality.A great bonus is how the movie shifts from Widescreen to Imax imaging, depending on the scene, shadowing the exact theatrical experience when you plop down your hard earned $$ for a movie show at actual theaters.  Bravo to the powers to be at Warner Bros. for duplicating this feature on blu-ray for the home theater audience.It is very obvious that Heath Ledger stole the show on this particular movie, nothing taken away from Christian Bale's performance.  Ledger's performance as the Joker, escalates Batman's nemesis to a level never explored, short of the masterful display done by Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's rendition of the series.  Ledger's portrayal exudes an evil that is not only physical, but psychologically tormenting, frightful & unpredictable.  As an audience, you realize that the Batman is in for the fight of his illustrious career against the likes of THIS Joker.Ever since Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale were hired to continue the franchise, their work as director and principal actor has reinvigorated the series with a realism and grittiness that truly defines the Black Knight.

In the long run he is a disappointment. Batman has always been a guy that could go toe to toe with Sherlock Holmes. A genius really. A driven genius. This is the second movie now where he gets other people to do his thinking for him. Lucious Fox for instance, and the Batmobile? It is nothing but a glorified tank. A military vehicle? The Batman I know designed and built all his own stuff. Then there is the lousy voice. It just has to go. I like Bale as an actor but can't they come up with a better voice than that?Then there is the Batsuit. He now looks like (and even kind of acts like) a big armored thug. The Batman I always knew was a guy who was vulnerable and not afraid to show it. He didn't have to wear a big clunky suit of armor.Heath Ledger was fine as the Joker. I still miss the way the REAL Joker looked but I can buy him. He does manage to do some very Joker like things in the film.Maybe the best Character and best acting job in the film though was Harvey Dent/Two Face. Trouble is that there just wasn't enough room for him. The film was too crowded. Just like they always do. Why not throw in 2 or 3 villans when one would do? Two Face needed more time to develop. He also LOOKED great! The most accurate (along with some refinements etc for the screen) by far. Great job on Two Face.Funny thing abut this film...... Out of all the characters The Batman ends up being the least interesting and portrayed the most poorly. It's not that I didn't like it at all. I enjoyed much of it but underneath it all I just couldn't shake the thoughts of ""that just isn't Batman."" I guess we still have to wait for his character to be done right. He has endured now for close to 70 years so I guess they have done something right. Too bad the film doesn't portray that.

Time and again I was told, by others, 'No, this time I really mean it, it's a GREAT film,' and time and again I would leave the theater angry or nauseous. But, now I am at the point where I feel the same way about ALL Hollywood tripe. As with the Spielberg crapfests, I was told how wonderful excrement like Brokeback Mountain and Crash were. They weren't. Similarly, almost all the reviews of The Dark Knight were glowing; especially praising the performance of Heath Ledger (the cock-mumbling hero of Brokeback Mountain) as the Joker. And with his demise shortly before last year's premiere of the film, the inevitable chorus of Oscar buzz for his performance rose, with him, indeed, snagging a posthumous Best Supporting Actor nomination and win (ala James Dean). So, was this the greatest film of all time? Was Ledger's performance one for the ages?No.In fact, not even close. And, as badly hyped as the Spielberg stool has been, and as nauseating as the PC films named above were, The Dark Knight, and Ledger's performance, have to be the two most over the top unbelievably hyper-hyped things Hollywood has ever unfurled. Why? Simple. The picture barely rises above mediocre, and Ledger is nowhere near as good a Joker as Jack Nicholson was, twenty years ago, in Tim Burton's Batman.The Dark Knight simply goes on for far too long- 153 minutes- and gets worse with each passing minute. It goes from a possibly good film, in its first hour, to a barely passable one in the span of the last hour or so. A good 45 minutes could have been lopped off with no discernible detraction from the film. In ten years, few people will care about this film, and Ledger's Oscar win will go down as one of those great WTF? questions wiser generations will chuckle over.

Rather than creating a sequel that relies entirely on action, Nolan has decided to go another route. The Dark Knight is even more intense, violent and psychologically complex than its predecessor.In the last few minutes of Batman Begins Lieutenant Gordon warned Batman of a new threat to Gotham's safety: The Joker. Now we learn how much of a threat he is. The Joker is revealed to be a psychotic criminal mastermind devoted to creating chaos whenever and wherever possible. And Batman becomes desperate to stop him. It's this desperation that drives him to use questionable methods in his nightly battle against crime. But The Joker is a master of manipulation and he's counting on Batman to up the ante. When he does The Joker takes advantage of the situation. He makes himself the central figure in Gotham's criminal underworld and soon even members of the mob become fearful of him. Batman begins to question whether or not he can endure such hardships without being weakened or corrupted. He sees that Gotham needs a new hero, a leader who will in any situation do the right thing for the people. He believes Harvey Dent to be that hero. Harvey is an idealistic D.A. and a social crusader. He's also dating Rachel Dawes, who still loves Bruce but cannot be with him so long as he is Batman. This is why Bruce begins to ask himself if the time has come to pass the torch on to another. But is Harvey Dent really the man to succeed Batman? Is he as noble as people believe him to be? Or is there something dark and terrible lurking in the psyche of ""Gotham's White Knight""? If so The Joker will only be happy to exploit it. And he does so in grand fashion. Tragedy strikes and someone close to Bruce is left dead (I'm not telling who) and Bruce decides that Batman is no longer needed, that he's become part of the problem and not the solution. Harvey's sense of justice is perverted and he becomes a maniacal vigilante who is obsessed with chance and flips a coin to determine his actions. It's clear that only Batman can stop him and The Joker, who delights in creating moral dilemmas for his victims before killing them. But can one man make a difference or is Harvey right? Is it just a matter of time before even Batman's corrupted?As with the first film, The Dark Knight features an extraordinary cast including Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Heath Ledger as The Joker, Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow. Other cast members include Eric Roberts, Anthony Michael Hall and Michael Jai White. Every member of the cast is great, but especially Maggie Gyllenhaal who replaces Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's love and Heath Ledger who is phenomenal as the psychopathic Joker. The Dark Knight is an amazing follow-up to Batman Begins and takes the ""comic book film"" to a whole new level of depth. It's easily one of the darkest superhero movies* I've seen, but that's what makes it brilliant. Christopher Nolan has made a disturbing, superhero tragedy that will in time redefine the genre. If Batman Begins was the philosophical Batman film then The Dark Knight is its sociological counterpart. There can be no knowing what the future holds for Gotham's Caped Crusader, but so long as Christopher Nolan is helming this series you can be sure that there are still many surprises in store.* = I would strongly advise parents to take caution before letting their children watch this film.

659301,A51IK68MWKV5R,B00005JPY0,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[5, 9]","I never intended to review this movie -- or, originally, even see it. It's just one more in the constant string of superhero films constantly fed out by Hollywood. But then The Dark Knight became one of the highest-grossing films of all time, and was suddenly declared the best film of all time by Internet Movie Database voters, and I just had to see what all the fuss was about and have my say.Because it's simply not all that. Other than a riveting -- probably a great -- performance by the late Heath Ledger, The Dark Knight has little going for it besides the expected high production values and some interesting directorial choices by Christopher Nolan (particularly during the lengthy chase sequence).Christian Bale has proven his acting abilities in numerous other films, but -- and this is the main problem with every film featuring the Caped Crusader -- he is given nothing to do here but react to events caused by the villains and the other characters. In a movie called ""The Dark Knight,"" shouldn't the focus be on Batman? Just call this movie ""The Joker"" and be done with it because, really, even Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart) is mostly forgotten by the time the credits roll.[Does no one else think it's a problem that role of Rachel Dawes (played by Katie Holmes in Batman Begins) was taken over by Maggie Gyllenhaal and, not only can you hardly tell but it also seems like an improvement? And what happened to Gary Oldman? He had challenging roles in the early 1990s, but here he mostly looks lost and confused while trying to look focused and determined.]To me, the huge success and unabashed acclaim of The Dark Knight is merely a symptom of the generally poor entertainment being produced by Hollywood these days. When someone comes out with a movie that is better than average, it is instantly hailed as a modern classic.

659304,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JPY0,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 2]","The Dark Knight is destined to be the greatest Batman film ever.  Perhaps even the best superhero film ever.  Perhaps even the greatest action film ever: in an era when anything is possible with CGI effects, director Nolan goes back to the old-fashioned method of actually creating the stunts in Dark Knight with wires, stuntmen, stunt drivers, and explosives.  He blows up an actual building for the Gotham General explosion.  He flips an actual 18-wheeler truck head-over-tail.  That's actually Christian Bale standing on top of a 100-story building.  This use of ""real"" effects/stunts is vital in a Batman movie, because the entire premise of the Batman is that he's a ""normal"" guy without superpowers.  This is the first key to why the Dark Knight is so great.The second key is the use of the Joker as the villain.  He is the ""main"" villain in the Batman pantheon, but he's always been problemmatic.  Because he's insane and can do anything, there's often a lack of consistency between stories and even within stories.  Heath Ledger's Joker does not fall into this trap.  Oh, he's certainly insane!  But as the film progresses, you begin to see the method in his madness.  Ledger's performance is certainly very good - worthy of the Oscar he won for the role.  But I'd like to point out additionally the fact that the story and screenplay writers, along with Ledger, have created a self-consistent version of the Joker, finally making him a worthy main foil for Batman.I think this film is most effective on first viewing - I really enjoyed the gradual unfolding of the Joker's master plan from seemingly random events.  I also enjoyed the relationship (often stormy) between the levels of Gotham's law enforcement - the D.A. Harvey Dent, the detective James Gordon, and the vigilante Batman.  The action is vicious and intense, but there's not too much of it.  The film slows down between its special effects extravaganzas to allow relationships to be viewed: relationships between Rachel and Dent, between Rachel and Bruce Wayne, between Gordon and the police commisioner, even between the Joker and his mobster allies.However, it is also enjoyable on repeated viewings, and there are many sequences that are so busy that you'll likely want to watch them repeatedly.  Hence, this is a good Blu-ray to get!  In addition, there are some nifty extras, the most interesting are the breakdowns on the action sequences, where you get to see the stuntmen in action.  There are also a number of ""Gotham Tonight"" interviews - a local public affairs program for the people of Gotham.  It features the characters of the movie (Dent, Bruce Wayne, etc.) basically giving their back stories.  The acting is a little forced in these, but they are entertaining nonetheless.",5,Best Superhero movie ever - and a very good Blu-ray set,1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,2763,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'destined', 'be', 'greatest', 'Batman', 'film', 'ever', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'best', 'superhero', 'film', 'ever', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'greatest', 'action', 'film', 'ever', 'era', 'when', 'anything', 'possible', 'CGI', 'effects', 'director', 'Nolan', 'back', 'old-fashioned', 'method', 'actually', 'creating', 'stunts', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'wires', 'stuntmen', 'stunt', 'drivers', 'explosives', 'up', 'actual', 'building', 'Gotham', 'General', 'explosion', 'actual', '18-wheeler', 'truck', 'head-over-tail', 'actually', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'standing', 'top', '100-story', 'building', 'use', 'real', 'effects/stunts', 'vital', 'Batman', 'movie', 'entire', 'premise', 'Batman', 'normal', 'guy', 'superpowers', 'first', 'key', 'why', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'so', 'great.The', 'second', 'key', 'use', 'Joker', 'villain', 'main', 'villain', 'Batman', 'pantheon', 'always', 'been', 'problemmatic', 'insane', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'often', 'lack', 'consistency', 'stories', 'even', 'stories', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'not', 'fall', 'trap', 'Oh', 'certainly', 'insane', 'film', 'begin', 'see', 'method', 'madness', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'certainly', 'very', 'good', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'won', 'role', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'additionally', 'fact', 'story', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'Ledger', 'have', 'created', 'self-consistent', 'version', 'Joker', 'finally', 'making', 'worthy', 'main', 'foil', 'Batman.I', 'think', 'film', 'most', 'effective', 'first', 'viewing', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'gradual', 'unfolding', 'Joker', 'master', 'plan', 'seemingly', 'random', 'events', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'relationship', 'often', 'levels', 'Gotham', 'law', 'enforcement', 'D.A', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'detective', 'James', 'Gordon', 'vigilante', 'Batman', 'action', 'vicious', 'intense', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'down', 'special', 'effects', 'extravaganzas', 'allow', 'relationships', 'be', 'viewed', 'relationships', 'Rachel', 'Dent', 'Rachel', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Gordon', 'police', 'commisioner', 'even', 'Joker', 'mobster', 'allies.However', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'are', 'many', 'sequences', 'are', 'so', 'busy', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'want', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'Hence', 'good', 'Blu-ray', 'get', 'addition', 'are', 'nifty', 'extras', 'most', 'interesting', 'are', 'breakdowns', 'action', 'sequences', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'stuntmen', 'action', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'Gotham', 'Tonight', 'local', 'public', 'affairs', 'program', 'people', 'Gotham', 'characters', 'movie', 'Dent', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'etc', 'basically', 'giving', 'back', 'stories', 'acting', 'little', 'forced', 'are', 'entertaining', 'nonetheless']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), Batman (Christian Bale) and Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) all fufiling their roles.

The anticipation for both this and its sequel were through the roof for everybody. Surely with such high expectations, you're bound to be letdown. Nothing can or will ever live up to that. Somehow, ""The Dark Knight"" lives up to those expectations and even exceeds them. The two hour and thirty two minute running time goes by in a blur as the film doesn't make time to drag and your eyes are glued to the screen the entire time. ""The Dark Knight"" is one of those films that once you start watching you have to watch the whole thing. Epic isn't a word that should be thrown around very often, but ""The Dark Knight"" is definitely epic.The cast is brilliant. The returning cast from the last film continues to be impressive. Michael Caine always manages to be charming and steal a few laughs as Alfred and the film wouldn't be the same without Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Christian Bale is still the best Batman to ever put on the cape. It was a welcome change from the first film seeing more Batman this time around than Bruce Wayne. The way he struggles with if continuing to be Batman is the right thing for Gotham still plagues him and is still equally as intriguing.Maggie Gyllenhaal brings a bit more of a spark to the role of Rachel Dawes in comparison to Katie Holmes, but is otherwise still kind of forgettable. Aaron Eckhart is the actor being overlooked here though. He's overshadowed by Heath Ledger whenever there's a conversation about this film. He has the best intentions for Gotham, but once he becomes Two-Face everything changes and he only wants to be the one who causes the bloodshed to those that wronged him. Those moments of him in the hospital bed are painfully beautiful and his temper lit by a short fuse only makes Two-Face that much more of a threat.Heath Ledger is this film's crowning jewel though. He steals every scene he's in. Whatever he tapped into and whatever kind of preparation he went through for this role is truly phenomenal. He was somehow able to embody The Joker in a way that is frightening, maniacal, and even hysterical all at the same time. You will wind up holding your breath and trying not to make a sound every time he comes on screen because you don't want to miss a second of his mesmerizing performance.Ledger apparently locked himself up in an empty apartment for a month to prepare for the role to get a true feel for the character; his body language, quirks, his voice, etc. He had The Killing Joke, The Man Who Laughs, and a few of the first issues of Batman that had appearances from the Joker as references. It truly shows that he put a lot of time into developing the character. The way he submerged himself in this character is almost beyond words. He deserves every ounce of praise that he gets.It is ridiculous how much praise ""The Dark Knight"" truly deserves. Even the most elaborate descriptions feel like they're still not doing the movie justice. The film is for Batman fans, for Christopher Nolan fans, for fans of good storytelling, for fans of good writing, for fans of amazing cinematography, for fans of some of the strongest acting performances ever to be filmed, and for fans of action, crime, or dramatic films; long story short, the film can and probably will be enjoyed by anyone.It is one of the only films to come out in recent years that not only lives up to the hype, but leaped over it and actually deserves every ounce of it. By the time you get to the end credits, you'll immediately want to see it again and you'll be just as excited the second time(and possibly third time) through. It's that good. These fingers can continue to praise this movie until they're purple from typing so much, but they'll leave it at this; it really was the movie of 2008. If it wasn't the greatest superhero film up until that point, it was at least the most captivating. It truly feels timeless and the type of film that'll stand up to greatness for eternity.",5,Epic...In Every Sense of the Word,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,4033,"['three', 'four', 'year', 'gap', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'film', 'always', 'eternity', 'anticipation', 'sequel', 'were', 'roof', 'everybody', 'Surely', 'such', 'high', 'expectations', ""'re"", 'bound', 'be', 'letdown', 'Nothing', 'can', 'will', 'ever', 'live', 'up', 'Somehow', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'up', 'expectations', 'even', 'two', 'hour', 'thirty', 'two', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'blur', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'time', 'drag', 'eyes', 'are', 'glued', 'screen', 'entire', 'time', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'one', 'films', 'once', 'start', 'watching', 'have', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'Epic', ""n't"", 'word', 'should', 'be', 'thrown', 'very', 'often', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'definitely', 'epic.The', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'returning', 'cast', 'last', 'film', 'be', 'impressive', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'always', 'be', 'charming', 'steal', 'few', 'laughs', 'Alfred', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'still', 'best', 'Batman', 'ever', 'put', 'cape', 'was', 'welcome', 'change', 'first', 'film', 'seeing', 'more', 'Batman', 'time', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'way', 'continuing', 'be', 'Batman', 'right', 'thing', 'Gotham', 'still', 'still', 'equally', 'intriguing.Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'bit', 'more', 'spark', 'role', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'comparison', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'otherwise', 'still', 'kind', 'forgettable', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'actor', 'being', 'overlooked', 'here', 'overshadowed', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'whenever', 'conversation', 'film', 'best', 'intentions', 'Gotham', 'once', 'Two-Face', 'everything', 'changes', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'bloodshed', 'wronged', 'moments', 'hospital', 'bed', 'are', 'painfully', 'beautiful', 'temper', 'lit', 'short', 'fuse', 'only', 'Two-Face', 'much', 'more', 'threat.Heath', 'Ledger', 'film', 'crowning', 'jewel', 'scene', 'tapped', 'kind', 'preparation', 'went', 'role', 'truly', 'phenomenal', 'was', 'somehow', 'able', 'embody', 'Joker', 'way', 'frightening', 'maniacal', 'even', 'hysterical', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'holding', 'breath', 'trying', 'not', 'make', 'sound', 'time', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'second', 'mesmerizing', 'performance.Ledger', 'apparently', 'locked', 'up', 'empty', 'apartment', 'month', 'prepare', 'role', 'get', 'true', 'feel', 'character', 'body', 'language', 'quirks', 'voice', 'etc', 'had', 'Killing', 'Joke', 'Man', 'Who', 'Laughs', 'few', 'first', 'issues', 'Batman', 'had', 'appearances', 'Joker', 'references', 'truly', 'put', 'lot', 'time', 'developing', 'character', 'way', 'submerged', 'character', 'almost', 'words', 'ounce', 'praise', 'ridiculous', 'how', 'much', 'praise', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'truly', 'Even', 'most', 'elaborate', 'descriptions', 'feel', ""'re"", 'still', 'not', 'doing', 'movie', 'justice', 'film', 'Batman', 'fans', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'fans', 'fans', 'good', 'storytelling', 'fans', 'good', 'writing', 'fans', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'fans', 'strongest', 'acting', 'performances', 'ever', 'be', 'filmed', 'fans', 'action', 'crime', 'dramatic', 'films', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'film', 'can', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone.It', 'one', 'only', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'years', 'not', 'only', 'up', 'hype', 'leaped', 'actually', 'ounce', 'time', 'get', 'end', 'credits', ""'ll"", 'immediately', 'want', 'see', 'again', ""'ll"", 'be', 'just', 'excited', 'second', 'time', 'possibly', 'third', 'time', 'good', 'fingers', 'can', 'continue', 'praise', 'movie', ""'re"", 'purple', 'typing', 'so', 'much', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'really', 'was', 'movie', '2008', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'superhero', 'film', 'up', 'point', 'was', 'least', 'most', 'captivating', 'truly', 'timeless', 'type', 'film', ""'ll"", 'stand', 'up', 'greatness', 'eternity']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659314,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00005JPY0,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 4]","When Batman Begins (2005) reenergized the franchise with its dark, brooding vision and Zen beginnings, it looked like the followup could be primed for even better results.  The higher expectations have not only been met, but are exceeded in The Dark Knight. Featuring a diabolical performance by the late Heath Ledger, this is a terrific film that takes the franchise to darker places, and it is a milestone in comic adaptations and certain to alter the course of such films in the future.An elaborate bank heist is engineered by the ruthless Joker who is stealing from and toying with the mobsters of Gotham City.  Batman (Christian Bale), the caped crusader, watches over the city aiding police Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman).  Although Batman is an outcast in society, his true identity is billionaire Bruce Wayne, Gotham's revered benefactor.  A new `face' in the form of District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), has arrived to clean up crime.  Dent is a supremely confident, dynamic `white knight' who means business, and he is dating Wayne's former love, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).  As Wayne Enterprise's Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) upgrades his armor and weaponry, Batman must confront the Joker, who consolidates his power and rule over Gotham's mobs and begins to target city officials including Dent for assassination.  When Dent sets himself as bait for The Joker, Batman must chase down and save the district attorney and Rachel from certain death.  Meanwhile, a new villain emerges from an unlikely source.  Racing against time, Batman is forced into a life and death choice, and he must decide if he should make a sacrifice that will forever change the course of Gotham's heroic avenger.Directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Momento) in arguably his most accomplished work, this mature, psychological movie takes its themes seriously and weaves subplots upon subplots.  For instance, how does a group of people respond when its morality and survival instincts are tested to the limit?  You may be surprised and thrilled by the answers. The plot twists are so numerous, you wonder, `am I really watching an action picture?' By the end, the franchise is launched into a new, uncertain direction.  Bravo to the filmmakers for not playing it safe.Whenever Ledger is onscreen, he is simply terrific.  There is not one false note or boring moment as he lights up the screen. With his body language, every inflection and facial expression all working in concert to create a horrifying persona, he is so convincing, you cannot imagine that it is Heath Ledger. He is complemented, as are the other leads, with a well written script full of memorable lines.  This Joker is a far cry from previous incarnations (Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson) of the clown prince of crime.  When Wayne tries to fathom The Joker's motivations, Alfred counsels him and states, ""Some men want to watch the world burn."" This Joker is grounded in real evil and is thus all the more menacing.  We get bits and pieces of Joker's sordid, traumatic past, which are totally credible in explaining his origins. Essentially an urban terrorist, he threatens the innocent and causes them to live in fear, and he kills with no remorse. There is no logic to his acts, and yet he is a brilliant, clever strategist.  Batman follows his own set of rules, but must he sink to Joker's level in order to combat him?If The Joker is like the devil, then Batman is almost a Christ-like figure, one with self doubt and who is willing to protect the innocent even if it means taking on or absorbing the sins and pain of the world around him.  Christian Bale continues to impress by portraying dual characters (Bruce Wayne/Batman) effectively and playing off the likes of Freeman and Caine, who make the most of their supporting roles.  Eckhart is convincing as Dent, a role much more developed and utilized than in Batman Forever. Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes) does quite well as Wayne's former flame.  Oldman is very good as Gordon which is quite the change of pace from having previously played evil villains (JFK).  In fact, Oldman, Freeman, and Caine form the moral compass of the film.With a talented cast bringing well rounded characters to the screen, Nolan keeps things grounded and never loses track of his story.  A Gotham car chase and Hong Kong escape are breathtaking sequences yet wholly believable.  You don't think of anything as computer generated or overdone, which is remarkable in this age of special effects. Are you listening Michael Bay (Armageddon, Con Air)?  There are several well composed shots that are iconic and haunting. The hardware is eye-catchy including the Batmobile and a scooter like none you've ever seen.  Pacing is methodical but it seems a bit choppy and jumpy by cramming in so much narrative material into a 2.5 hour running time.  The camerawork is at times quite fluid and dazzling by enhancing the mood or (in The Joker's case) madness.There are a couple of moments that are a bit misleading or confusing such as an assassination attempt that may have claimed a key character's life.  And the villain's fate is sort of, how shall I put this, left hanging?  But these are tiny quibbles in a film vastly richer than any comic book adaptation (Spiderman 2 and Iron Man are in this elite company) to date.  Rated PG-13, this is essentially an R rated film in spirit and not for younger children.  It is creepy and sustains an overall dark, violent mood throughout.  Go see The Dark Knight for a multi-layered story that challenges and surprises. Go see the wonderful acting and writing led by maestro Nolan. But most of all go see a burst of genius that was Ledger's brilliant, last hurrah.",5,The Masterpiece That Is THE DARK KNIGHT,1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,5718,"['When', 'Batman', 'Begins', '2005',

659316,A2G0KS2DQPFI9U,B00005JPY0,"cybergel78 ""cybergel""","[7, 11]","Batman has now entered the hallowed halls of cinematic legends. Not only it's smashing box office records worldwide, it's also THE film to catch this year.Chris Nolan has finally arrived at the A-list with this writhing and heart-wrenching cinematic outing. You couldn't ask for more from a superhero movie. No other superhero has ever aimed for this astronomical height of cinematic autuer brilliance. Spider-man 2, X2, Iron Man and even Superman Returns have tried but still fall short. There is still no pizzazz. Bryan Singer, Brett Ratner and Sam Raimi should see this film over and over and over, take notes and then try to improve on their film craft.Acting as a one-man show behind the scenes, Chris Nolan not only directed this film, he's also in charge of second unit direction (normally given to others) and he shares screenwriting credit with his brother. Both brothers have churned out equally smart and enigmatic scripts together: Memento and The Prestige. With this film, both brothers have sealed themselves as part of Hollywood legend.""The Dark Knight"" opens with a brooding establishing shot of Gotham City. The shot is somewhat reminiscent of 2019 Los Angeles of Blade Runner (Chris Nolan's favourite film). With a two-note soundtrack that sounds like chalk board screeching, the opening shot has already set the tone for the bleakest and most intelligent superhero movie ever made.A nod to Michael Mann's ""Heat"", the opening bank heist is shot in a brisk and efficient manner, even William Ficthner made a brief cameo as a bank manager once again. Here, the sociopathic criminal known as The Joker reveals his visage under a clown guise. The Joker is a fully developed character on its own. The late Heath Ledger disappears under his skin and emerges one of cinema's most memorable villians, alongside Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vadar.Sloppy, filthy, face caked with inche-thick makeup and a permanent scar from ear to ear, the Joker's face is something to behold. Even the voice and mannerism captured by Heath Ledger is something of a genius. This is obviously a maniac under the guise of a criminal genius.Instead of making the Joker a stereotypical supervillian, Nolan chose to make him a sociopath with a set of code and honour followed very strictly, something that would even please Atticus Finch. However, his downright dementia might trascend the vileness and the evil that transpires, as he says near the end of the film: ""A little social experiment"". From a sociologist's point of view, the man's work, neferious and evil, it may seem, serves to prove a point: Everyone has a breaking point.Taking a cue from Alan Moore's ""The Killing Joke"", the Joker wants to see if anyone could be driven insane based on ""a very bad day"" that happens on a person. The unfortunate victim here is Harvey Dent (a casting coup, Aaron Eckhert). To a certain extent, Bruce Wayne as well.Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is indeed a tortured soul. Filled with moral ambiguities and ethos that is akin to the Joker's anarchic and chaos theory. Both hero and villian are essentially mirror images of each other. The Batman universe could not really exist, with one another co-existing and feeding off each other.Bruce Wayne may very well be a schizophrenic. Under the guise of Batman, he becomes a totally different creature. A vigilante in the same sense that Harry Callahan and Paul Kersey. Gritty to the max, unafraid of consequences to self and others around them, and eventually, by the end of the film, everyone in the protagonist's world is somehow affected by the touch of evil (Kersey's family is practically wiped out, Dirty Harry loses a partner in almost all his ""adventures"")Taking matters into their own hands and thus sealing one's own fate seems to be a common theme in ""The Dark Knight"". Batman is not afraid to break someone's legs, Dent continues the duality theme and turned vigilante, the Joker, just being the Joker, takes everything into his own hands.By the end of this depressing film, the denouement offers a silver lining in its dark, gloomy clouds. Bruce Wayne allows himself to be the sacrificial lamb for the sake of the moral fiber of Gotham City.

Harvey Dent, determined to bring down the mob alongside honest cop Jim Gordon; and Batman, Gotham's mysterious--and hunted--crime fighter.  On the other side: the Joker, a mysterious madman who bursts on the scene like a plague of terror, leaving chaos in his wake.Christian Bale delivers another solid, near-flawless performance as the Caped Crusader.  Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon is thankfully given a larger role; Oldman is perhaps Hollywood's most talented chameleon, playing a wide range of roles, and capable of showing a full spectrum of human emotions.  His portrayal as Gotham's one honest cop is one for the ages.  Morgan Freeman, too, has a larger--and more fleshed-out--role, and I needn't tell you how talented he is.  Michael Cain gets to drop a few more hilarious one-liners as Alfred.  Aaron Eckhart, as Dent, is a welcome addition; you truly believe in him, you truly root for him...and you truly feel for him, as the movie progresses (yes, die-hard fans: Two-Face is here, and he's as bad as ever).It is, of course, Heath Ledger's performance that will draw the most attention.  This is largely fueled by his untimely death at such a young age; however, his performance would have stood as the movie's centerpiece, no matter what.  Let me make this statement as clear as I possibly can: Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is one of the greatest cinematic villains of all time.  Plain and simple.  He is psychotic, he is unpredictable, he is thoroughly evil--and yet, despite it all, he is undeniably human.Which is at the heart of ""The Dark Knight.""  Note that word: ""dark.""  This is not a movie for the faint of heart.  You will think about it afterwards.  You will dream about it.  You will walk away feeling slightly dingy, as if you've stepped in a puddle of mud and can't get the dirt off.  The movie explores the depths of human deprevity (the Joker's favorite past-time is forcing people to choose who lives and who dies), and no one--not Gotham's white knight, Harvey Dent, or its dark knight, Batman--is exempt.  After all, even Batman, behind the leather and armor, is human.  And that's what ""The Dark Knight"" is all about: not monsters, not murder, not even mayhem--it is about humanity.  And that makes it a thoroughly gripping, and truly disturbing, cinematic experience...that just so happens to feature a comic book character.",5,What doesn't kill you makes you stranger...,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,2408,"['so', 'game', 'one', 'side', 'new', 'Gotham', 'D.A', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'determined', 'bring', 'down', 'mob', 'alongside', 'honest', 'cop', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'Batman', 'Gotham', 'mysterious', 'hunted', 'crime', 'fighter', 'other', 'side', 'Joker', 'mysterious', 'madman', 'who', 'scene', 'plague', 'terror', 'leaving', 'chaos', 'wake.Christian', 'Bale', 'delivers', 'solid', 'near-flawless', 'performance', 'Caped', 'Crusader', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'thankfully', 'given', 'larger', 'role', 'Oldman', 'perhaps', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'talented', 'chameleon', 'playing', 'wide', 'range', 'roles', 'capable', 'showing', 'full', 'spectrum', 'human', 'emotions', 'portrayal', 'Gotham', 'one', 'honest', 'cop', 'one', 'ages', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'too', 'larger', 'more', 'fleshed-out', 'role', 'need', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'talented', 'Michael', 'Cain', 'drop', 'few', 'more', 'hilarious', 'one-liners', 'Alfred', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Dent', 'welcome', 'addition', 'truly', 'believe', 'truly', 'root', 'truly', 'feel', 'movie', 'yes', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Two-Face', 'here', 'as', 'bad', 'ever', '.It', 'course', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'will', 'draw', 'most', 'attention', 'largely', 'fueled', 'untimely', 'death', 'young', 'age', 'however', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'stood', 'movie', 'centerpiece', 'matter', 'what', 'Let', 'make', 'statement', 'as', 'clear', 'possibly', 'can', 'Ledger', 'portrayal', 'Joker', 'one', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'villains', 'time', 'Plain', 'simple', 'psychotic', 'unpredictable', 'thoroughly', 'evil', 'yet', 'undeniably', 'human.Which', 'heart', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Note', 'word', 'dark', 'not', 'movie', 'faint', 'heart', 'will', 'think', 'afterwards', 'will', 'dream', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'dingy', ""'ve"", 'stepped', 'puddle', 'mud', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'dirt', 'movie', 'depths', 'human', 'deprevity', 'Joker', 'favorite', 'past-time', 'forcing', 'people', 'choose', 'who', 'who', 'one', 'not', 'Gotham', 'white', 'knight', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'dark', 'knight', 'Batman', 'exempt', 'even', 'Batman', 'leather', 'armor', 'human', 'what', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'not', 'monsters', 'not', 'murder', 'not', 'even', 'mayhem', 'humanity', 'thoroughly', 'gripping', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'just', 'so', 'feature', 'comic', 'book', 'character']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659324,AIR1OLVTVMI3Y,B00005JPY0,Daniel Mendoza Villa,"[2, 3]","Most superhero stories have relevance to politics and current events, and The Dark Knight can certainly be interpreted as a strong moral commentary on our troubled times. The telecommunications issue, terrorism, fighting evil and public perception is all directly addressed. The message appears to be that saving innocent life is the absolute priority for leadership. In pursuing that agenda, Batman resorted to a type of wiretapping and allowed his image to be forever tarnished. He even welcomed his fall from grace, recognizing early on that he could never fight evil effectively and remain popular to the public. Press and citizens in a free society will easily pick a part leaders making tough decisions and fighting tough fights--partially because those decisions and fights are not going to be popular--there is no perfect way to make those choices and execute those battles--and partially because there is no other visible lightning rod for public perception. In devising the story, Nolan hit upon a truth that the entire press corps seems to have forgotten: principle is more important than popularity. Having a squeaky clean image and saying all the right things are no substitute for the willingness or character to fight evil.But regardless of whether you like the politics of The Dark Knight or prefer to just zone out and watch the mayhem, Warner's BD is a must-have for your collection. The film is truly unique and riveting, and Warner did a great job integrating the IMAX footage for 1080p.Some of us think this is the best superhero movie of all time to date, great story, excellent direction of the film, good actors and one of the best performances of an evil character: The Joker interpreted by Heath Ledger, from my point of view this Joker is way better than the one play by Jack Nicholson.The Joker of Jack is kind of childish, a great performance by Nicholson, but also kind of incredible; on the other hand the one played by Ledger is more credible, possible if you may say so, it stays also more true to the character invented for the comic realm, this guy is really sick!  Nothing childish about him, it is also kind of scary, and that's the point of it, the Joker is a mad man with no specific object in mind, he does as he please.This is the content of the  BD:Disc 1: Gotham Uncovered--a mish-mash of standard definition and high-def content, clocking in at one hour, this multi-part documentary replaces the need for an audio track and focuses on the unique elements that went into the creation of the sets, props and the use of IMAX cameras. It's a trove of information that no fan of The Dark Knight should miss.Focus Points--a rather hidden picture-in-picture option available in specific episodes that turn out to be the above-mentioned documentaries. Those who find PIP to be distracting will prefer to watch the content as Gotham Uncovered.Disc 2: Batman Tech--as part of three hours worth of documentaries, this featurette explores the many weapons and utilities designed for Batman. Most of them are based on military equipment.Batman Unmasked--subtitled The Psychology of The Dark Knight, this documentary focuses on psychotherapeutic analysis of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Frankly, this content would have been more appropriate for Batman Begins, never the less it is appreciated here.Gotham Tonight--a series of six newscasts averaging about eight minutes each. They all explore Batman and Bruce Wayne, as presented by ""Gotham Cable's Premier News Program"". The CNN-like news show played a role in several scenes of the main feature, but on its own, the newscasts for me seem a bit boring.Galleries--watching the Joker cards rain down after the assassination of a judge in The Dark Knight, it is clear that many different types of cards are used. Here, they are all on display, along with TV spots and trailers, concept art, poster art and production stills.While not perfect, this content features enough interesting documentaries and extracurricular activities to keep one occupied for hours on end.

The story line is superb, the cast is amazing (Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar for his performance as Joker), and the action is breathtaking. The Dark Knight takes place immediately after Batman Begins. Batman is starting to make Gotham City peaceful and safe, until the Joker comes in and creates chaos for Batman. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is amazing and terrifying. Ledger shows that Joker is sadistic, homicidal, insane, and of course, funny in a horrifying way. Heath Ledger will forever be remembered as the greatest comic villain ever. I highly recommend The Dark Knight  to anyone who wants to experience a thrilling action movie!!!",5,The Best Comic Book Movie Ever Made,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,711,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'story', 'line', 'superb', 'cast', 'amazing', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Joker', 'action', 'breathtaking', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'place', 'immediately', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Batman', 'starting', 'make', 'Gotham', 'City', 'peaceful', 'safe', 'Joker', 'creates', 'chaos', 'Batman', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Joker', 'amazing', 'terrifying', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'sadistic', 'homicidal', 'insane', 'course', 'funny', 'horrifying', 'way', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'remembered', 'greatest', 'comic', 'villain', 'ever', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'anyone', 'who', 'experience', 'thrilling', 'action', 'movie']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659326,A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,B00005JPY0,Dan McKinnon,"[5, 7]","After leaving the theater in 2005 nearly wiping tears from my eyes after watching the genius of Batman Begins, I said ""part of me wishes they would never make another film because there's no way they could come close to the perfection of this movie"".I was wrong.For the past 2 years I have been awaiting The Dark Knight with more excitement than any other movie in my life.  Searching the net daily for new information, watching the trailers around 500 times (no exaggeration) and following the genius viral marketing plan online, I knew that The Dark Knight would be an amazing effort and my expectations were through the roof.  I expected a nearly perfect movie and my expectations were EXCEEDED.To avoid spoiling this work of genius, a short recap is all I will provide.  After the events of Batman Begins the city is in chaos and a new threat emerges in the form of the psychotic Joker.  Wanting to inflict anarchy and disorder, the Joker has no real ulterior motives other than to cause trouble and misery for the residents of Gotham.  With the help of Lt. Gordon and newly elected DA Harvey Dent, the Batman faces his toughest nemesis ever as he tries to saved his beloved city so he can one day take off his mask for good and Bruce Wayne can be with his true love Rachel.Cast/Production Opinions------------------------GENIUSHeath Ledger - Ledger's performance as The Joker quite simply is THE definitive take on the clown prince of crazy and a genius display of acting.  All the hype that has been directed at Ledger is not without merit.  Not only does Ledger give the greatest villain performance I have ever seen, he LIVES The Joker.  The little nuances, walks, grunts, etc. is absolute CANDY for the viewing audience.  If you have wanted a menacing Joker that cares about nothing and just wants to cause mayhem, this Joker will become THE Joker forever.  So much more than just a character, Ledger gives one of the great performances in film history.PERFECTIONGary Oldman - The 2nd best performance in the TDK and another amazing performance as Lt. James Gordon.  For anyone that is a fan of Batman Year One and the comics, you will appreciate Oldmans work nearly as much as Ledger.  Quiet, subdued, and wonderful, you CARE for Lt. Gordon and you are happy when things go his way.  This is an amazing work and can't be ignored.Location - Chicago really was a perfect place to film these movies.  The city looks amazing and you really feel like you are in Gotham.NEAR PERFECTIONChristian Bale - Fantastic Bruce Wayne, perfect as Batman, obv the movies don't work if he doesn't.  On par with the greatness of his work in Batman Begins.  I don't think it's better work here, I think in both movies he is amazing equally.Michael Caine - Wonderful as Alfred as per usual.Christopher Nolan - Another wonderful job directing.  The IMAX shots really add to the film and the opening shots in IMAX make you go WOW.  Is Nolan capable of making a bad movie?Writing - Great script which is very dense.  This might not be for everyone but having a dense story done right only adds to the longevity of the film over time.Gadgets - The new Batpod and other cool stuff are still realistic and not over the top.  Any technology that is introduced in the movie serves a good purpose and makes sense.GREATAaron Eckhart - Great performance that makes you CARE about Harvey Dent and what he is trying to do for the city of Gotham.  At the end of the movie when he's not the same person that he was at the beginning he still gives a great performanceMorgan Freeman - Such a great actor and he builds on his character from Batman Begins, very solidGOODMaggie Gyllenhaal - This is one of the only weak parts of the movie.  I never criticized Katie Holmes in Batman Begins because I thought she did a fine job acting and her baby faced innocence I thought was a good match for Bruce Wayne.  I just thought she was too young.  I think Gyllenhaal was in a tough spot with this role.  She comes into TDK with a character already created and she doesn't seem sure how to act accordingly.  Does she be Dawes as Katie Holmes or a new version?  I think she's good in the movie but I would have rather had Holmes return.  She could have done so much more but I felt she was lazy in this role.The Dark Knight is THE definitive ""super hero"" movie but it is so much more.  You don't have to like Batman or super heroes to enjoy this film and it will be the quickest 2 1/2 hours of your life.  Any time Ledger is on the screen it's pure candy and he's on the screen just enough, making you yearn for more.Great story, incredible directing, amazing/great performances and the genius of Heath Ledger make this not only the best film of 2008 but one of the great movies of all time.  In terms of sequels it might BE the greatest sequel ever (I would put Godfather Part II and Aliens right up there as well) and it DOES live up to the hype.See The Dark Knight in IMAX if you can to enjoy the scenes filmed in this format, but make sure you see this movie over and over again.A masterpiece.***** NEAR PERFECTION",5,The Dark Knight: Near Perfection,1216684800,"07 22,

659331,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B00005JPY0,D. A. Reed,"[7, 14]","I read a Robert Downey Jr. interview a couple months ago. He was saying how bad this movie was and that it didn't have a plot. Well, Mr. Downey Jr., maybe if your superhero movie was anywhere near decent and had a fully developed villain, then this reviewer would've given yours a chance (and I don't really like Marvel and another point: he wouldn't have said any of this if Iron Man had made nearly one billion dollars instead of The Dark Knight) Anyway, I've seen every incarnation of Batman: The 40s serials (good for they're time period), the 60s series and film (again good for the time), the Burton/Schumacher films (like the Superman movies, films one and two great; three and four, not really), his animated series and films (from Filmation and the silly Super Friends all the way to the now entertaining but yet respectable treatment on Brave and the Bold) and Batman Begins (just awesome) and I knew this was one I was going to see. And when I went to see it, I kept in the back of my head that, it being a sequel (which don't always do that hot) it may not match up to the first. And I was a little skeptical about when they cast Heath Ledger as the Joker, as I, believe it or not, didn't even know who he was. Boy was I wrong. The story was one of the most powerful, gripping and emotional of any superhero film out of any I had ever seen. I'm not a big fan of them but even though Marvel has more of their properties on the screen and I've seen all the X-Men and Spider-Man movies and the first Fantastic 4, those stories just couldn't compare to what this was. And the saying, a hero is only as good as the villain, holds true. Ledger's portrayal is the most accurate I've seen next to the 90s animated version (though due to TV standards for a cartoon was toned down) and its a shame that Ledger passed on and advance his talent. This was such an amazing movie that I really can't say anymore because its already been said.

With critical acclaim and almost 159 million at the domestic box office, this movie has proclaimed itself the box office champ of the summer, smashing records left and right in only a couple of days.Improving upon the components that made ""Batman Begins"", its predecessor, this film surpasses the first and raises the bar for all other comic book movies from this point on.  This Batman is dark, a hero but not the perfect savior that we tend to see in Superman or Spiderman.  Christian Bale does a great job as playboy billionaire Bruce Wayne, a charming lady killer by day and a brooding vigilante by night.  Surrounding Bale is the ever-talented duo, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman as Alfred the Butler and Lucius Fox, respectively.  Caine is charming as Wayne's loyal friend and right hand man, who often guides the young man through many of the difficult choices he must make.  And Fox, also a moral center for Wayne, runs Wayne Enterprises and helps aquire all those fancy gadgets and amazing vehicles and suits that aid the Batman in his fight against crime.Aaron Eckhart plays the suave, handsome Harvey Dent (and eventual villain Two Face), a charasmatic D. A. who is dating Wayne's former flame Rachel (now played by Maggie Gyllenhaal).  And there is also Gary Oldman, playing Lt. Gordon---all three doing a great job in their prospective roles.  It is, however, the late Heath Ledger that shines as the Joker, a sadistic sociopath who decides to use Gotham as a lab for his experiment in cruelty and fear.  Ledger's Joker ups the anty, besting Jack Nicholson's version of the villain and guaranteeing himself a posthumous Oscar nomination for a truly inspiring performance.  This villain is pure evil at heart; not tempted by money but instead entertained at the pain he causes in all around him.  Ledger creates a character that would equally fit in a good horror movie, the kind of demented evil that sends a chill down your spine.  The greatest sadness is that Heath Ledger never lived to see his amazing performace appreciated by both fans and critics alike.At almost 2.5 hours running time, ""The Dark Knight"" is well worth every minute spent.  The special effects are incredible, as expected, and the story, characters and performances are beyond reproach.  Nolan is an amazing director (as he has proven before with films such as ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"") and deserves his share of the credit.  This film is lucky to have that perfect combination of ingredients needed to make a really great film---director, actors and story, all well done and appealing to a mass audience.  Highly recommended to all...Batman fans or not.

659335,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B00005JPY0,Davewise,"[0, 3]","This is among of the best superhero movies ever. In fact, if it wasn't for Batman's suit and Batmobile, you could easily argue this is among the best detective movies. It has an engaging storyline, spectacular action sequences, great characters portrayed wonderfully by a talented cast, and great direction (as usual) from Christopher Nolan. It's a crime this movie wasn't at least nominated for Best Picture in 2008. Here you have a rarity - a movie which the public and critics alike almost universally praised.Christian Bale again does a great job as Batman, supported by Michael Caine as Alfred and Gary Oldman as Gordon. Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox with a host of new gadgets for Batman, including a modified cellphone which can act as a kind of sonar. The standout performance though goes to Heath Ledger as the Joker. He brings a dark and maniacal quality to the character which matches how he was represented in many of the Batman comic books, as a dangerous lunatic. In many of the scenes the Joker is both amusing and terrifying at the same time. When holed up in the same room alone with the Batman, it is clear the Batman has met his match, which forces Batman to consider actions he previously would've shied away from.Batman starts out by cracking down on organized crime. Seeing him as a major threat, the crime bosses bring in the Joker to deal with him but are unable to control him. Even the crime bosses quickly become afraid of the unpredictable Joker. The Joker targets several officials, including Harvey Dent, the up-and-coming District Attorney who has been using official channels to stamp out crime even as Batman uses his unofficial methods. Dent has one other thing in common with Batman - he's dating Rachel Dawes, the woman Batman still loves but won't become involved with fearing it'll make her a target. Ironically, she soon becomes a target because of her association with Dent. Those familiar with the Batman storylines from past comics, TV shows, and movies will also know Dent as the one who changes to become Two-Face. When targeting officials isn't enough, the Joker manages to pit regular people and hardened criminals against each other in an attempt to show man's nature.The chase scenes in the movie are some of the best action sequences I've seen. ""The Dark Knight"" provides a great mix of action and psychological drama. It adds a touch of romance with the ill-fated love of Batman for Rachel. And the Joker provides many funny moments, even while he's being menacing. In short, this movie has something for everyone.

I'll weigh in by saying inspired and leave it at that.  What puzzles me is that in all the hype for the film little is mentioned of Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent.  Discretion dictates that I not give too much away, not that there's many out there that haven't seen ""The Dark Knight"", but Eckhart's work here is of great complexity and in my mind equals if not surpasses Ledger's.

His hope of a normal life hinges on the ""white knight of Gotham City,"" DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who can act in the light and within the system; if he can take Batman's place, it will be a powerful indicator that Gotham has become a healthy city.  This transition appears to be on track until the Joker (Heath Ledger) begins his rise in the criminal underworld.  He is anarchy and unrestrained self-interest incarnate, pure and simple.  The Joker and Batman are opposites, and the soul of Harvey Dent becomes their battlefield, thereby setting the stage for a tragedy.Director / co-writer Christopher Nolan has surpassed his excellent first film of this series.  Everyone brings their A-game.  I  confess that I found the script to be unfocused and chaotic at times, but I was completely won over by the time the credits rolled for two primary reasons.  First, the film's last act, and particularly its final moments, brings all the thematic threads together in an unexpected fashion.  Secondly, the episodic nature of the screenplay made me feel that Batman and the Joker had a history of conflict by the end of the film, rather than one big encounter.  It seemed like a more faithful adaption of their relationship from the comics.If another Batman film is never made, I will feel completely satisfied.

Even someone as cynical as  I cannot find a way to explain the poverty of imagination in this film as well as in the minds of the critics who extol its virtues. I was bored instantly and never recovered. Where to begin? In the first place, the film's strength, the acting of Heath Ledger as good as it is is not remotely as exciting as has been reported. He is good but doesn't develop very much from start to finish. In the end, it is indeed an over-the-top performance worthy of note but not at all a nuanced performance worthy of comparison to the great dramatic roles awarded Academy prizes through the years. That he is even being considered a prize is driven by sentimentality and commercial hype. Bale is passable - his oddly altered tough-guy voice is inaudible and weird. There is no set; the entire film takes place in a hodgepodge collection of locations across the country. Two stand-outs are the Port Authority of New York City and the Wrigley building of Chicago. These scenes are collectively known as Gotham City. I saw nothing in the performances of the various supporting actors deserving of attention. The film is overly long, the dialog is standard comic-book, neither witty nor fun. The invincibility of the Joker is a joke in itself; just how and why the Joker is capable of defeating the entire Gotham City police department and Batman is never made clear. Is he brilliant, superhuman, gifted or what? The love interest is boring. The theme of corruption and corruptibility is old-hat and witless.

659349,A14PS3LPIO7UF8,B00005JPY0,"Dawoud Kringle ""Renegade Sufi""","[2, 4]","I thought everyone did a magnificient acting job in this.Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman / Bruce Wayne was actually quite subtle. As Wayne, he was suave and confident; and at the same time, unassuming. As Batman, he came across as determined and unstoppable; and, as the Joker said, incorruptible. His conversations with the Joker revealed his own inner pain. And that is what Batman is really all about: darkness, pain, and obsession.Aaron Eckhart did marvelously as Harvey Dent. The transformation from the DA committed to law and order into a ruined man incapable of dealing with his own pain and loss, and determined to impose his own new ideas about chaos upon the world was brilliant.But it was Heath Leger as the Joker who really stole the show. Unlike the flamboyant interpretation Jack Nicholson did in 1989, his was an irredeemable and scruffy psychotic. Totally insane. Pure evil. Zero empathy. A sociopath ""agent of chaos"" that would have had Hannibal Lechter raising an eyebrow; and at the same time brilliant and insightful.The real difference between Nicholson's Joker and Ledger's Joker was that Nicholson's Joker was a flamboyant criminal: Ledger's was a completely unhinged sociopath. Utterly subhuman, like the Bush administration (oops! Did I say that??? Sorry). These are two completely different kinds of insanity. I guess it depends upon what you envision that role should be.And its an open question. Batman's origins we know about. Batman is the product of fear and obsession. The origins of Nicholson's Joker were no mystery; but Ledger's Joker we haven't a clue. A completely unpredictable lunatic with facial scars and warpaint / makeup (which he used not only as a psy-op weapon, but to hide whatever he was inside), and no evidence of any traceable history. Nicholson's Joker wanted attention and money: Ledger's Joker didn't care about anything but chaos and destruction.Ledger's Joker had some other interesting traits. He was totally twisted, but knew exactly how to push other people's psychological buttons. His henchmen were mentally unstable men who he had essentially brainwashed (can you imagine what it would be like to work for him?). During the interrogation scene, the Joker knew all of Batman's weaknesses, and the undeniable fact that he was, in the long run, all alone. This proved true at the end when the whole city turned against him. He understood Batman better than Batman understood himself - or would admit to himself. And his conversation with Dent in the hospital was really the final push that sent Dent into complete insanity. The Joker essentially brainwashed him.When he was apprehended by the police, he exploited the main weakness the police had: they treated him like a criminal. He was not a criminal by any stretch of the imagination. he was a psychopath: which is very different from a criminal. He was also a formidable adversary. A skilled fighter, brilliant improviser, and was incapable of caring what happened to him. Every time he was face to face with pain or death, he laughed.The lines he delivered were unbelievable: ""You won't kill me because of some misguided sense of self righteousness, and I won't kill you because you're just too much fun!""I am inclined to believe that the role may have been instrumental in Ledger's death. Any actor must face the danger of becoming too deeply immersed in the character he / she is playing. Daniel Day Lewis is a perfect example. Ledger went deep into a realm of utter madness to develop the Joker and convincingly play him. Maybe too deep. It was probably hard for him to come back to being Heath Ledger; and he underestimated the effect the role had on his psyche.There seems to be another subtext to this movie.Harvy Dent was the ""Hope"" of the new order; but proved himself to be a ""two face"" as some suspected him to be, when things turned on him. Batman is the vigilante who, in the end, takes the hatred and frustration of Gotham City upon himself as an act of self-sacrifice for the greater good. Could this be an allegory for the Bush administration, whose figurehead took upon himself the hatred of the whole world as a similar act of self-sacrifice? Wouldn't that place the ""new"" administration, whose foundation of ""hope"" is well known, in the role of the ill fated Harvey? And wouldn't that make anyone who thought outside the rhetoric of this ""new order"" a dangerous lunatic like the Joker? Is ""The Dark Knight"" mere political propaganda disguised as action entertainment?No; that's too outlandish an idea. I shouldn't even write such things.",4,You know the thing about chaos?

The story is so deep it's impossible to take it all in on the initial viewing.  Heath Ledger plays the Joker to maniacal perfection.  He is by far the best Joker I've ever seen (sorry Jack).  He is the first actor to make the Joker frightening.  As much as it pains people to know they will have to replace Ledger in subsequent chapters as this was just the beginning of the Joker and Batman.  I also thought including the cameo of Scarecrow was a nice touch.As usual Christian Bale was an excellent Batman, but I feel that something is lacking in his portrayal of Bruce Wayne.  It may not be his fault even.  I've always viewed Bruce Wayne as a tormented soul who views the mantle of the bat as a bane in his life.  Nolan's Batman almost seems uncomfortable as Bruce Wayne and would rather be the bat and leave his life as Bruce Wayne behind.The film is dark and brooding as a Batman movie should be.

659365,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00005JPY0,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 3]","Finally, at long last, we get a superhero movie that lives up to the dynamism and creative vigor of the original comicbook medium!  This second installment in the rebooted ""Batman"" franchise is easily the best Batman movie yet, with an intelligent, surprising, suspenseful script, a fluid sense of action, and vastly superior acting.The first glimmer of how much this film (and its director) really ""get it"" comes early on, when we see that Maggie (oh, god, yes!!) Gyllenhaal has been cast to replace Katie (please make it stop!!) Holmes in the role of district attorney Rachel Dawes. Similarly, Aaron Eckhart brings just the right tone to his performance as the public crusader Harvey Dent, and Gary Oldman has completely nailed Police Commissioner Jim Gordon (as the character has evolved in recent years, particularly in the late series, ""Gotham Central."") And, of course, Heath Ledger is absolutely stunning as the Joker. What a cruel tragedy that he is dead and can no longer excel in this role: he lights up the screen and makes it crackle with terror every second he's on screen. He, and this film's version of Two-Face, are the first Hollywood supervillains -- ever -- that actually feel feel terrifying and real. Director Christopher Nolan is in no small part responsible for this amazing success, and although he's been handicapped by losing a star (and by plot choices described below) I have no doubt that he will continue to breathe vitality and life into this genre: this guy is the future of comicbook movies. Warner, please keep him happy.SPOILER-LAND:---------------As thrilling as I found this film, I was disheartened to find that the end (really just the last five minutes) fell flat, and in particular that it fell into one of the major faults that has plagued many other Hollywood comicbook adaptations. The decision to kill Two-Face at the end of the film was a mistake. The same mistake was made in the first Batman film (with the Joker apparently killed at the end) and has been replicated in several subsequent films.  I honestly don't know why the studios seem to feel that audiences need this kind of blunt closure in these films, or why they assume that every super-film has to be so big and grandiose, and have such a decisive finality at the end. Killing these characters doesn't make sense: it unnecessarily hamstrings future scriptwriters, and it doesn't give audiences what they want. We **don't want** to see a great, creepy character like Two-Face die -- we want to see him again, in the next film, and we want to see Eckhart reprise his role! It's not necessary to kill the villains -- just throw them in jail, let them break out later, and cause lots of mayhem.  Also, Dent's death is used as a dramatic pretext to put Batman ""on the lam"" at the end... Like the decision to kill the Two-Face character, Batman's melodramatic response rings false and was a big misstep on the part of the studios -- it just feels dramatically forced and doesn't add anything to the overall direction of the franchise that wasn't there already, with Batman being a costumed vigilante, etc.It's my belief that too much pressure is being placed on creative teams to make these films overly-epic, when really comicbook stories are plenty exciting on their own, and don't need the added layers of mythologizing and grandiosity. What's great about this film is that, until the lame ending, it almost entirely avoided the top-heavy pretentiousness and leaden storytelling of previous super-films. It's my hope that the studios will learn from this success, and loosen up a little bit. When they learn to tell these stories with the same sort of prolific abandon as the comicbook companies themselves -- when making super-movies becomes more normal and more routine -- then perhaps they can just settle down and deliver some spectacular pyrotechnics and dynamic, mind-blowing action and leave the clunky exposition and too-all-encompassing story arcs behind. Really, we just want to see the super-dudes battle it out. And we want it to be fun. This film delivers on all fronts.

I have never been in a 2-1/2 hour movie that was paced so well and just got better and more exciting as it went on.  No one could ever predict everything that was going to happen there were so many twists and surprises along the way.  The actors were impressive, some more than others, and the characters they represent are astonishing.  Of course we knew Heath Ledgers performance of the Joker was going to be Oscar worthy - and it is with ease.  But even Eric Roberts (a big time B-movie star) even pulled off some ok acting in this one.  I must say Christian Bale's performance was fine, but not show-stealing and was a little buried in the part, but only cause he had some great competition.Aside from Ledger's performance, the story might be the best thing going for this film.  It is very complex, and I'm just not sure I got it all in, definetly one of those movie I'd want to watch more than once to fit things together better each time.  Seriously though, the story and theme alone can compete with some of the best dramas out there.  In fact, I'd say there wasn't as much action as I expected but it was not missed and/or needed.  But speaking of action, it was done so well.  There is never an overabundance, only what is really necessary, yet at the same time it is huge.  This includes scenes with the Tumbler and Bat-Pod that I am referring to.  As far as fights go, there are a few and nothing flashy nor lengthy, but yet again, not really missed or needed.If you are a fan of Batman villains, of course you are in for a treat with the Joker played by Heath Ledger.  The current argument is ""Is he better than Jack Nicholson's Joker?""  Honestly they are both quite different and really shouldn't be compared, but I do believe this Joker made a much much bigger impact in the film, not just because of great acting, but the kind of Joker he is and what he accomplishes.  But, if you thought Joker wasn't enough &lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILER BEGIN>>> Harvey ""Two Face"" Dent makes an appearance and gets more screen time as the villain than I expected.  Of course the Joker was so well done I didn't feel the need for another villain, however, Aaron Eckhart gives us quite a bonus, as this Two-Face is (well duh) so much better than the Tommy Lee Jones Two-Face.&lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILER END>>>I never thought I'd say this cause I feel like part of the crowd, but seriously this is going to be one of my favorite films for a loooong time to come.  I would certainly watch this one over and over again, and yes mainly to see and study Heath Ledger's excellent performance.  The world has truly lost a very blessed and gifted actor, and no doubt he needs to be recognized for a nomy.

It just didn't ""flow"" with the rest of the story line, and was distracting and stupid.  Perhaps this side-story, after the character is injured and turns to the dark side, should have been the main plot of a different film.  The writers should have left this character in the hospital, and his fate (and face!) a mystery, and carried on with the rest of the film.  AND beause of this cumbersome and ridiculous side-story, the film was just too long!  Heath Ledger's ""Joker"" was more than enough to carry the entire film, and his performance was riveting. The cat-and-mouse between Batman and the Joker was excellent, although at times it stagnated, and should have been streamlined to make the chase more urgent and suspenseful.  This film did not have the excellent and ""believeable"" special-effects the first one had; some scenes were cartoonish and silly (cartoonish and awkward? the Bat-cycle's vertical turn-in-place! YUCK!).  The first film, ""Batman Begins"" was more mature and had a VERY sharp edge to it, and this film lost that edge completely, and became a ""typical"" action film, which disappointed me tremendously.

Williams,"[4, 6]","Ive never been much of a fan of Heath Ledger, or been interested in mostly anything hes done before ""Dark Knight"" but there cannot be a higher honor than to say that with his untimely death, there will never, ever be another Joker again. If anyone in hollywood, for the sake of greed or money, thinks they can just pick up and put anyone, no matter how good they are, back into this role that Ledger now owns, then they are severely and terribly mistaken. Remember, this is coming from a non-Ledger fan, at least until now.His Joker portrayal can be included in the ranks of villains that you just hate to love, and although we're not supporting of or endorse the actions of these baddies in film, we cannot seem to shake the charisma or strange likeability that these bad guys possess. Darth Vader, Hannibel, Lex luthor (Hackman not Spacey), Robert Deniro's master thief (Heat) just to name a few. And now, we have Ledgers Joker to join this evil and esteemed list.This movie is so much more than a fluff fest that most ""superhero"" movies tend to be (Ghost Rider, Daredevil) and yet it cannot be simply classified as a superhero movie, nor a horror movie, nor a crime drama, nor an action movie. Although others here have put it more eloquently than I plan to, this is the best of all combinations of the aforementioned genres.Christian Bale is the only Batman Hollywood. This isnt James Bond with 10 different actors playing the part. There is only one Batman now, and lets just say it sure as hell isnt George Clooney.There is only one Commish Gordon now, and his name is the much underrated and excellent Gary Oldman.The list continues with Freeman and Eckert (Sp.) , the always delightful M. Caine, and of course now the late H. Ledger.I would love to see a third installment to this wonderfully serious series, but none of these players above can nor should be replaced.The standard has been set high, and to continue it would be like climbing mt. Everest. Hopefully Nolan knows that and declines to make a cheap, lazy buck like those INdy Jones guys this year (Spielberg and Lucas).If Nolan feels he can continue to master this genius, then by all means, please continue, but if not, then please leave the masterpiece alone and refuse to sell out.One last point. Some here seem to be complaining that this new ""Dark Knight"" series is too dark and violent for kids. This isnt meant to be a family film folks to take the kiddies to, dont you have enough of ""Wall-e"" and that Panda thing to take care of that, among so so many more yet to come?This is an adult film, with certain fantasy elements, but well set into a most realistic, and sometimes brutally so, world.

I think we all remember Jack Nicholson as The Joker in Burton's Batman and while he is a terrific actor and did a great job with the character, Heath Ledger took the character and turned him into a force of nature that has to be reckoned with. Ledger's Joker is one of the many highlights of the film and he does a terrific job with the character. He is a smart psychothic killer who only wants to see the world burn. Is too bad that this was Ledger's final role becuase he was a fantastic actor and it clearly shows here. As terrific as Bale is in the role of Batman, ha can't help but get overshadowed by Ledger. In fact, everything and everyone in the film are overshadowed by him. He created a fantastic, timeless character.Still, every other single aspect of the film deserves praise, the cast, the imax sequences, the action, the plot, etc., TDK is a fantastic film that will keep you at the edge of your seat every time you see it. It's bigger than BB but also darker and one of the best sequels ever made. An excellent film through and through.Video & Audio:TDK boasts a terrific video presentation in HD. First the aspect ratio will switch in the Imax scenes to make you relive the experience. It's not the same but it's a fantastic alternative. The presentation is strong, with a high resolution, excellent contrast and with no compression artifacts whatsoever. A fantastic transfer.Likewise, the 5.1 Dolby TrueHD is dynamic, clear and potent.Bonus material:This is a 2-disc BD set that has a lot of insightful materia. You have a documentary about the Imax proces and the production of the film in general and a PIP presentation on key scenes. On disc two you have hours of material that delves with the technology, the psychology of Batman, trailers and galleries.Everything is interesting and should not be missed.Closing Thoughts:TDK is Nolan's finest film to date. With an amazing plot, a spectacular cast, great action sequences and awesome special effects, this movie is a must-own for everyone. Warner's BD has a terrific P/A presentation and great and insightful bonus material.

Magical moments, memories and faces routinely come and go on the silver screen, but a role this iconic only comes around once or twice a generation, and the power of his appearance has been amplified over the years. Ledger deserves every bit of the credit he reaped for the part, even if his untimely demise may have heightened the hype to superhuman levels. The things his character gets to do, say, and imply are downright remarkable, and really elevate this from a very good superhero movie into a brilliant social commentary that just so happens to revolve around a man with a cape, cowl and vast personal armory. As in Batman Begins, the supporting cast is heavily peppered with brilliant performances from Hollywood's heavy-hitters, with particularly excellent showings from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckhart, and once again Christian Bale masterfully inhabits the dual roles of Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's a great action movie, detective story, political thriller, superhero flick and moral tragedy, never feels half as long as its 152 minute run time lets on, and sticks the landing in every single important scene.

With writing more complex than any comic book movie before it, perfect casting and equally perfect acting, masterful directing, and breathtaking cinematography and special effects make this movie a watershed achievement, not only in its genre but in the history of filmmaking.Returning from Batman Begins is writer/director Christopher Nolan and co-writer David Goyer, whom continue their dark, gritty, and startlingly real approach to the Batman mythos, but Christopher's brother Jonathan joins the team after cowriting The Prestige with Chris to craft a superhero story that goes beyond the typical ""good vs. evil"" story. The Dark Knight dares to relate its protagonists and antagonists to moral and society issues regarding war, terrorism, hope, despair, good men making compromises ""for the greater good"" that our own world currently faces, and dares to suggest that there are no easy answers or tidy resolutions to our problems.Of course, the film's standout performance belongs to the late Heath Ledger, whose Joker is no over-the-top cartoon like Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the character in the Tim Burton film. Ledger is captivating in his nuanced turn as Batman's greatest foe; a frightening anarchist whom wears smeared, cracking, caked-on clown make-up and licks his Glasgow smile scars with a flicking tongue reminsicent of the evil serpeant that tempted Eve with the apple. Like the shark in Jaws, this Joker strikes quickly and without warning and brings a simmering, looming threat to the film that remains even when he is not on screen. Some more cynical minds believe that the Oscar buzz the performance has received (and the films' $530 million box ofice take) is due to Ledger's very sudden and very public demise, but those people downplay Ledger's horrfyingly brilliant performance.Ledger may be getting the most praise, but the rest of the A-list cast deserves much credit too. Christian Bale once again proves why he is the best Batman of them all, a man who is conflicted between his quest for justice and his desire to live a normal life, and finds his own moral codes and dedication to the mission tested by a nemesis whom follows no rules and knows no fear. Though a lot has been made of Bale's use of a very raspy voice when in his cape and cowl, but I personally didn't have a problem with it. It seems like a logical choice by a man trying to conceal his identity to change his voice. But others found it distracting.Aaron Eckhart would give the film's other breakthrough performance as Harvey Dent, Gotham's championing District Attorney, determined to clean up Gotham's streets. But Dent's story is a tragic one, transforming him into the murderous Two-Face, a scarred madman whom decides the fate of his enemies with the flip of a coin.Gary Oldman returns as Jim Gordon, the only good cop left in a city overflowing with corruption, whom must make compromises and even deceive his own family to get the job done. Michael Caine reprises his role as Bruce Wayne's butler and erstwhile mentor Alfred, Morgan Freeman returns as Wayne Enterprises' CEO and Batman's tech supplier Lucius Fox, and Maggie Gyllenhall takes over for Katie Holmes as Bruce's love interest Rachel Dawes. Though Gyllenhall isn't as attractive as Holmes, she doesn't seem as out of place among such high-caliber actors as Holmes did.The only reason this Blu-Ray gets four stars instead of five is because of its paltry special features. Sure, there are the cool ""Psychology of Batman"" and ""Batman Tech"" features and the ""Gotham Tonight"" faux news clips featuring Anthony Michael Hall's Mike Engel character that made their rounds on the internet during the film's brilliant viral marketing campaign. But the DVD and Blu-Ray ""boast"" only three hours of behind-the-scenes footage, and in an age where movies like Lord of the Rings feature hours and hours and HOURS of behind-the-scenes footage and special features, it's a major disappointment that The Dark Knight only has around three hours of special footage. And even worse, no on-set interviews or pieces featuring Heath Ledger himself. I know Warner Bros. was afraid that people would accuse them of trying to capitalize on Ledger's tragic death, but to not even include some interviews of him or a documentary in memoriam is a disservice. The two-disk offering of The Crow featured Brandon Lee's final interview, so I don't see why Warner Bros. wouldn't include an interview of Ledger. I hope they're not saving it for future editions of the DVD/Blu-Ray, because that would truly be opportunism on their part.So in all great movie, but the Blu-Ray leaves a little to be desired.",4,"Best Superhero Movie Ever, but deserves more special features",1229731200,"12 20, 2008",2008,4708,"['What', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movie', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said',

659388,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00005JPY0,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","In ""Batman Begins,"" Christopher Nolan managed to do what few directors could do -- create a dark, gritty atmosphere around an all-too-human Batman, who fights for the oppressed with quiet intensity.That moody murk is only intensified in the breathtaking, harrowing ""Dark Knight,"" which fills itself with blasts of action, psychological twists and a shocking tragedy. Nolan pulls no punches for our dark knight or his ever-endangered Gotham City, but brilliant acting of the hero and villains is what truly elevates the second of Nolan's Batman movies to a work of cinematic art.Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is continuing to fight the good fight for Gotham, even when he gets hurt in a fight against Scarecrow and some Batman impersonators.So unsurprisingly, he's is feeling fairly in his crimefighting abilities, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. He starts blackmailing Batman by killing Gotham citizens, and saying he won't stop until Batman turns himself in.But even when captured, the Joker has an ace up his sleep -- Dent and Rachel Dawes' (Maggie Gyllenhaal) lives. And after a devastating loss, Batman finds himself dealing with the Joker taking all of Gotham hostage, and the maddened and disfigured Dent bringing vigilante justice to all those whom he thinks have wronged him. Only Batman has a chance of stopping even one of them -- let alone both -- but doing so may tarnish the Dark Knight forever.Most directors would have given this movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in ""The Dark Knight"" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.And Nolan's skills are even more polished this time around -- lots of kinetic action, vicious dogs and car chases, including the rather silly-looking Batpod and the tanklike Batmobile. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (""That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people"","" Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.This is especially true whenever the Joker's corrosive presence is onscreen, since he's all too happy to stick pointy objects in people -- he's creepier than a thousand boogeymen. And Nolan is not afraid to further darken the storyline by inflicting yet another personal tragedy on Batman. His direction is painfully delicate as he explores Wayne's sorrow and guilt.But the most striking aspect of ""The Dark Knight"" is Nolan's delvings into morality -- The Joker has none and Dent's becomes horribly perverted, but we're reminded that there are some who will not be corrupted even if they lose what is most precious. It's almost a doom'n'gloom movie, but the faint hints of optimism and hope keep it from being TOO overwhelmingly dark.Christian Bale is simply perfection as Bruce Wayne/Batman, using his handsomely chiseled face and piercing eyes to best advantage -- even in the most tragic scenes, where you can practically see Wayne's soul bleeding. And he has a difficult character to wrangle with -- not only does he have to expose Batman's pain and struggles, but also his inner incorruptibility.On the flipside, the late Heath Ledger is blindingly brilliant as the sadistic, creepy, gleefully malign Joker, and he chews the scenery as few actors could.

659393,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JPY0,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 5]","Among the many satisfying surprises within this elaborately produced 2008 film, the primary one is that it is at heart, a first-rate, character-driven psychological thriller that uses the familiar franchise to ask hard questions about our individual accountability at a time when anarchy and terrorism are running rampant. With this propulsive sequel, director/co-writer Christopher Nolan far surpasses the stoic murkiness that plagued most of 2005'sBatman Beginsbecause myth exposition is not necessary this time. Moreover, he doesn't forget this is also a derring-do adventure and wastes no time in establishing the tone with one of the most Machiavellian of bank robberies. The meticulously planned heist was masterminded by Batman's anarchic adversary, the Joker, a villain so wrapped up in his own psychosis of evil that he is without fear of repercussion. However, this is just the tip of a moral iceberg as Gotham City is cloaked in a crime spree by the city's major syndicates.On the side of justice is not only the Batman but also the city's charismatic district attorney, Harvey Dent, who symbolically plays the story's white knight. Under the guise of his billionaire alter-ego Bruce Wayne, Batman is quite impressed with Dent's seemingly intractable sense of decency. So is assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes, Wayne's lifelong friend whose office romance with Dent gets serious. Of course, a romantic triangle ensues, but this is only one component of the complex storyline that has the Joker taking over the city with his merciless acts of destruction, while Batman becomes a more ambiguous figure teetering between heroic and vengeful. With his brother Jonathan as co-scenarist, Nolan provides a boldly intellectual perspective to this movie that never gives into easy answers, and the complexities are compounded by the intense feelings that fluctuate between what we expect our heroes to do and what we should expect from ourselves.It's a precarious line that Nolan balances with edgy conviction, and the classic good-versus-evil dynamics become upended for something that cuts much deeper. Without giving much else away, the pivotal scene with the ferries perfectly epitomizes the slippery slope all of us find ourselves in a post-9/11 world. Four of the key actors from the first film return starting with Christian Bale's covertly charged performance in the elusive title role. Not only does the character present physically demanding challenges but emotional ones as well since Batman remains a stubbornly recessive figure hiding under a familiar costume. Yet, in his innate resistance to court audience sympathy, Bale manages to cut a far more compelling character in which his internal struggles shift most uneasily to the outside. Ironically, it's his moments as Wayne that seem comparatively prosaic in conveying his outward cynicism.Had the film been made fifteen years earlier, I have a feeling that Gary Oldman would have been cast as the Joker. However, he submerges his natural edginess to play Lt. James Gordon as an island of decency. Michael Caine returns as Wayne's devote manservant Alfred, as does Morgan Freeman as gadgetry whiz Lucius Fox, who helps Wayne build all the technology hardware the Batman needs to stave off the bad guys. Neither is particularly challenged here, but both perform with their usual authority. There are three new faces among the principals. As Dent, Aaron Eckhardt effectively manages the film's biggest character arc, and he is really the one whose inevitable transformation most clearly illustrates the story's central themes. With a more no-nonsense manner that nicely counterbalances her standard damsel-in-distress situation, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a marked improvement over Katie Holmes' girlish turn as Dawes.The tabloid frenzy around the late Heath Ledger has somewhat obscured what makes his performance as the Joker so effective. With his fearsome scar-faced grin, it's a grandly idiosyncratic performance full of shrewd wit and opera-level flourish. The tortured soul that the press would lead you to believe is onscreen is not as evident to me. I see a sharply talented actor having the time of his life. Not surprisingly, all the production values are great with the architectural splendor of Chicago more obviously subbing for Gotham City this time out. Flaws are relatively minimal and actually carry over from the first film. The film is almost too oppressively dark, at least visually, and in the action sequences, Nolan still uses too many close-ups and quick edits that impinge on the clarity of the action presented. Regardless, the film is an impressive achievement, and along with Jon Favreau'sIron Manearlier this year, may represent the pinnacle of DC and Marvel Comics on celluloid.",5,Post-9/11 Accountability

659396,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,B00005JPY0,"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real""","[20, 33]","Of course, I'm being provocative (again).  The title of this review implies that I didn't enjoy ""Dark Knight"" which is not at all true.  However, there are so many glowing endorsements of this film here at amazon.com that I decided the only way I could possibly add anything that would help the 12 people who haven't yet seen this, would be to temper their expectations by pointing out some areas I had trouble with.  In this way, they may enjoy the film without wasting thought on the details that bugged me.  I'll still indulge myself by reinforcing some of the things that are undeniably cool about ""Dark Knight"" but my goal is to prepare you to enjoy it despite its problems.-GOTHAM POLICE FORCE; WORST EVER.Be prepared for police ineptitude on the grandest of scales.  Ironically, it's not the difficult detective work or the ability to run an efficient bust they have problems with.  It's the stuff that goes on right under their noses that boggles the mind.  Explosives in huge quantities and in improbable places get moved around this city without suspicion.  The Gotham Police criminal handling protocol would delight any felon with aspirations of escape.  Also apparent is the complete lack of an internal affairs department or any oversights at all for that matter.  Be ready to suspend logic for these aspects or you might be disappointed.-THE JOKER; MOUTH-READY MAYHEM!!Be prepared for some twisted yet improbable conundrums from the Joker.  Remember those explosive I told you about?  Well, never is it explained or eluded to how so much volatile material gets moved through the city so quickly and unnoticed (police ineptitude not withstanding).  Never mind the cost of the explosive extravagance; I just wondered how The Joker got such elaborate plans to work without any disruption.  As elaborate as the plans were, they were always mouth-ready and waiting to be deployed as the need arose.  Obviously, you have to give him credit as a criminal genius.  But I think the grand scale of his plans would be more palatable if some sense of time were introduced into the story; it seems like it all takes place by magic instead of grand planning.  Some plans are so grand that they raised serious questions of plausibility.-O.A.D.; OBSCURE ACTION DISORDERLike ""Batman Begins"", ""Dark Knight"" suffers from OAD.  If you need your action to appear discernable from its surroundings or you need to understand how a fight took place, this film will not completely satisfy you.  Luckily, the fight scenes were almost reduced to tools for moving the plot instead of showpieces in themselves.  However, some were staged as set pieces and were less than stellar.  With flashing lights, way too close, always in the dark, obscure action, you will never know exactly how Batman defeated his foes.  Admittedly, this is a pet peeve of mine for any film.  Yet, it was a minor inconvenience when you look at the picture as a whole.-THE SCARY THING IS IT COULD HAVE BEEN LONGER. (mild spoilers)About an hour and a half into the film, the Joker is in jail along with most of the other bad guys.  The problem is we have another hour to go.  At this point the film started to feel long.  When you think about my complaints and what it would take to fix them, we're talking about a 4 hour movie.  As complete and compelling as the story is, could it have been 2 films?  I'm pushing it here, but it might have been 2 great films instead of one really good film.-FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH; HEATH LEDGER DESERVES AN OSCAR BID.I'm just chiming in on this point.  You've probably read the same thing a dozen times by now.  I don't believe winning an Oscar is always indicative of great work; sometimes it's more of a legacy award.  In cases of death, sometimes the Oscar is a sympathy award given posthumously.  In this case he earned it.  In fact, I would argue that he threw himself so completely into this psychotic role that it contributed to his demise.  Ironically, this role will define his career.-REINFORCING THE GOODBesides Heath Ledger, the one thing that makes this film so compelling is the story.  It is complex but not intellectual.  It questions our humanity without preaching.  Most importantly, it explores our willingness to comply with the corrupt status quo.  ""Dark Night"" depicts so clearly how jarring it would be to actually uproot corruption from our everyday existence to the point that we may not ever want it to happen; talk about ironic.Despite the cinematic proliferation of computer graphics, the visual effects are so convincing that you are left questioning ""how did they do that?""  Can you remember the last time you said that?  The car stunts are unique and entertaining while all of the actors pull more than their weight.  In fact, if I didn't complain about it, it was well done.-VIGILANTE VERDICTThis is by far my favorite Batman film.  I purposely raised a lot of complaints and criticisms to the point of stretching the limits.  My goal was to temper your enthusiasm so you will lower your expectations for ""Dark Knight"".

I went into the movie worrying that Batman's character would be tainted in his pursuit of Joker but nothing could have been further from the truth. Batman is the same Batman that he was in Batman Begins.  He just shows us futhermore in this movie just how noble he is.  The Joker was what made this movie so dark.  He is a formidable enemy played brillaintly by Heath Ledger.  The choices people are forced to make by the evil mastermind add an element to the story not often found in newer movies, even the good ones.

659399,A3RU2P4FAACQ1J,B00005JPY0,"Elton Pinto ""Eptiger""","[3, 7]","THE MOVIEI'm going to be keeping this spoiler-free, so don't be afraid to keep reading. I hate it when reviewers give away key plot details, it really hurts the movie experience. Speaking of which: you need to see this movie in IMAX if it all possible (they're doing a re-release in January 2009). It's worth the extra few bucks, trust me. Christopher Nolan shot at least 6 scenes in the movie using IMAX cameras, and it shows.In case you've been living under a rock: this movie is a direct sequel to Batman Begins and is not at all related to the prior Batman films. The main premise is that the organized crime in Gotham, under siege from Batman, turn to The Joker for help and, naturally, chaos ensues. This movie is hands-down the best comic book movie ever made. It took my high expectations and just shattered them. This movie doesn't just blow awayIron Man, it really outshinesBatman Beginsin its dialogue, pacing, and action scenes. This is Batman the way it was meant to be experienced and really combines the elements that make Batman my favorite comic book/animated series.There's so much to love about this movie that I'm not sure where I should start. I think I'll go with the acting: Heath Ledger steals the show as Joker among an already incredible cast. He doesn't just portray the Joker, but for 2 and a half hours he is the Joker. I can't think of the last time I saw an actor nail a role so well that I couldn't even believe it was them in the role. I'm not saying I thought he was a bad actor before, but just the voice and makeup and everything transforms him into a completely different person. He's so good that I'm sure Jack Nicholson will see it and say, ""Wow, he was good!"" If you go to this movie for no other reason it should be to see Ledger in his best role ever. It's so sad to know that he can't come back in a future Batman film or any film at all. If you ever doubted his abilities as an actor, this movie will embarrass you.The rest of the cast doesn't disappoint either. Christian Bale is an even better Bruce Wayne than before and really takes on a darker, grittier Batman. This movie is really dark, and Bale doesn't shy away from this. Michael Caine IS, well, Alfred. He was in the first movie and he is here also; he defines what it means to be Alfred. If you've seen the first one (which you really should before walking into this one, but don't absolutely have to) then you know what to expect here. Maggie Gyllenhaal really steals Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes because it will amaze you that Katie Holmes ever could have been Rachel Dawes. I always felt that Gyllenhaal was underrated and it shows in this film. Aaron Eckhart was the perfect man to play Harvey Dent. The concept of a DA with a passion for justice is not lost on Eckhart. He starts off as being not bad and then progressively just gets deeper and deeper into the role. Morgan Freeman's character is given more screen time in this one and while I would've loved to have seen his character fleshed out a little more I appreciate their time restrictions also.Speaking of which: the worst thing you can drudge up about this movie is how dense it is. It's 2 and a half hours long and a lot happens, but I feel like it's paced well enough so that you'll always want to know what happens next and you can't possibly be bored. You probably will laugh, cry, and jump in your seat (or squirm) during this movie, it's just that powerful. I love the dark humor because I love dark humor in general, and the delivery is always impeccable. The dialogue in this movie is decidedly more mature when compared to its predecessor, which I think is saying a lot (probably because David Goyer was not a part of writing this one, just in conceiving it). Getting back to my point though: there are several plots throughout this movie that do all tie together but can get confusing if you don't pay attention. Of course, I just look at this as giving more re-watch value to the film. There's so many little details to appreciate and the cinematography is so spot-on that you can't help but want to watch certain scenes again and again. The special effects are never too heavy and are always just welcome inclusions.This movie should not be seen by small children. Seriously, if you're under 14 then you have no business seeing this movie. It's not curse words or violence (though there's not much cursing and there's absolutely no nudity), but rather the themes that this movie revolves around. They're dark, complicated, and involve a lot of moral gray area. Besides, the Joker would probably seriously creep out anyone that young (I'd be surprise if he didn't give some adults bad dreams). The haunting imagery in this movie will likely stick with you, but you have to appreciate the fact that these characters are likely to stick with you. You really care about them and feel involved in their lives.I give this movie an A+ with my highest recommendation for you to run out and see it right now. Please, go see it in IMAX if you can, and Blu-ray if you can't. If you are above the age of 16 and you do not see this movie then something is wrong with you. Yes, it's that good.THE BLU-RAY SETDoes it look every bit as good on Blu-ray as it did on the big screen? For the most part, yes. I think that when you watch a movie with as dark as palette as this one the scenes with a lot of black don't look as good as you may remember on the big screen. The IMAX scenes are pretty much breathtaking. I was a little disappointed with how they enforced the IMAX aspect ratio: the IMAX shots will take up your whole screen whereas the rest of the movie will have black bars at the top and bottom. Since my other Blu-ray movies don't do that, it makes me feel a little cheated. Still, they're fairly thin bars and the quality is pretty amazing for the rest of the movie also. The only flaws you're really going to find in the other scenes in the movie are just noise in the backgrounds occasionally, but you pretty much have to walk right up to your TV (which I hope is HD if you buy this on Blu-ray) to notice this noise. The edges are razor sharp all around and I can't recall seeing any artifacts. I think it doesn't look as good asWall-Esimply because the colors in the movie itself aren't as vivid, but they're definitely crystal clear and ensure that you won't miss a single detail in a single frame. So don't buy too much into what some critics are saying, I still think it's worth your money video quality-wise (I can't speak for the DVD version though because I haven't seen it). The sound is even better though. Even on my simulated surround sound, it never comes close to disappointing. It gives you that true movie theater experience with explosions you can almost smell and gunfire that's almost too realistic. The score shines pretty well also.Now for the weakest part of this set, if you can even call it that: the extras. I didn't try out the digital copy, but I did try out BD Live and perused the other extras on both discs. The BD Live content is nothing particularly exciting. You can create and watch video commentary, which I think is kind of a gimmicky. You can also do live chats. The other main feature is the ability to watch movie trailers and other video content that should've been on the disc but wasn't because it wasn't good enough. There were a couple of videos that I was kind of peeved didn't make it on the Blu-ray because they were actually interesting, but the others were animated shorts that added audio to frames of a comic book that was created for the movies. I only watched a couple, and they were terrible. The artwork was just fine, but the dialogue did not sound like Batman at all (I mean the writing, not the voice acting). What's worse about this stuff is that the video size is only a quarter of your screen, are lacking in quality, and buffer terribly. It's best to start playing one, pause it immediately, and then go make yourself hot cocoa while it buffers the video so that you can actually watch it continuously. My cable Internet isn't the bad, but I can stream videos just fine on my laptop. I would've liked to have seen a trivia game or something else on BD Live.The other features are pretty good though. There's no commentary track, which I didn't mind because I rarely listen to those, but you can trigger featurettes at various parts of the movie when you see the appropriate icon, or watch them all entirely outside of the movie. There's about 90 minutes worth of that stuff, and they're pretty fascinating overall. I had never seen an IMAX camera before watching the featurette on it, and it's incredible to imagine how they filmed any action on that thing. On disc 2 you'll find a couple of documentaries that no one has seemed to point out originally aired on the History Channel in the weeks leading up to the release of The Dark Knight: Batman Tech and Batman Unmasked. So when you read reviewers talk about how strange it was that neither of these documentaries include non-trailer scenes from The Dark Knight and only scenes from Batman Begins, you can be a smarty pants and correct them. I thought that they were pretty well-done and great ways to lend another level of realism to this character and world on top of what the movie has to blot out the abominations of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. I especially liked the Unmasked one, a psychological analysis of Batman, because part of what I always liked about him was how dark and gritty and real he would always feel and that he was even thrown into Arkham himself once. There are also some episodes of a Gotham news program that were movie cheesy, but still useful addition in that they help ground the film in what feels like reality. They're almost like deleted scenes, in a way. The other features you have is a smattering of photographs and concept art, and all the trailers and TV spots, which I always love to have to watch long after a movie was released and I'm always bothered when DVDs don't include them. The concept art is pretty awesome, and I really wish that had taken the initiative to let you view them picture-in-picture with the film as an optional layer.Overall, this is definitely something worth buying. Even though it's not a monstrous amalgamation of special features, it's a pretty healthy amount that will take even longer than the movie itself to go through, and the quality of everything (besides the BD Live content) was excellent.ADDENDUM: LIVE CHAT EVENTI participated in the live chat event with director Christopher Nolan on December 18 and it was awesome! It was text only, not video. At first I was disappointed, but actually text chat lets you enjoy the movie fully and only tune in to what Nolan is saying when/if you want. It's actually a text box at the top of the screen that's readable without being too big and has a somewhat transparent background so that you can see whatever part of the movie it covers. You ask questions on the WB BD Live site (you had to be logged in, so only people in the chat could ask questions), and Nolan (or perhaps a third-party) goes through and asks as many of the best as quickly as possibly.Sometimes, he picked ones that I thought were kind of dumb or already answered in other features on the disc, but there were a lot of insightful questions answered about the casting, nuances of the story, origins and inspirations, etc. I didn't get any of mine answered, unfortunately, but the event could only support 100,000 people and with 600,000 copies sold on the first day alone (I imagine a significant number from pre-orders), I imagine a number of people were excited about this event a week afterwards.I don't know how often they're going to be doing this, but it was cool. It was the only BD Live feature that I thought was creative and on par with some of the stuff Disney is trying out. I'd love to see them do more live events with actors from the film or even Batman comic experts.",5,The Best Movie of 2008 Looks Great on Blu-ray,1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,11976,"['MOVIEI',

659402,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B00005JPY0,Enjolras,"[1, 1]","I'm not generally a fan of superhero movies, but wanted to see this movie because of all of the hype surrounding Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. I remember watching Jack Nicholson's Joker as a kid and being scared to go to bed. However, Heath Ledger takes the joker, and acting in the villain role, to a whole new level. Ledger achieves what few actors playing villains ever have - he has created a character so repulsive and deranged, but at the same time complicated and unpredictable. In the Dark Knight, Ledger's Joker is a sadistic anarchist who devises sick games to force people into making wrenching moral choices. My favorite one is where he plants explosives on two ferries, one with convicts and the other with civilians, and gives passengers on each ferry a detonator to the bombs on the other ferry - and forces them to make a decision by midnight! I won't spoil what happens, but the outcome was surprising.The rest of the movie was good, but sometimes seemed a bit to into itself. At times, the plot twists and turns seemed a bit too intricate and unrealistic (yes, I know, we're talking about Batman, but still). At too many points it seemed the villains (and sometimes the heroes) managed to install dynamite, find people, and perform other tricks by magic. The movie uses ""corrupt cops"" as an excuse to drive the plot too many times, rather than actually explaining how, for example, the Joker takes over an entire building, plants dynamite on two ferries, knows exactly where all of the main characters are. Why were dogs such a problem for Batman - and how did Joker know to exploit them? And by the way, how did Dent escape from the hospital when it blew up? There were just a few too many leaps. Overall it was a fun movie, with great drama, tension, and fighting scenes, but it could have been better.More seriously, I thought the sound quality was poor. At times, I could barely understand Christian Bale when he was Batman. He sounded muffled and coarse. Some of the other voices didn't come across well. I have a pretty good sound system that I've used with many other movies, so it seems like the problem stemmed from the film recording itself.",4,"Wow, Heath Ledger really could act!",1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,2180,"[""'m"", 'not', 'generally', 'fan', 'superhero', 'movies', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Joker', 'remember', 'watching', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'kid', 'being', 'scared', 'go', 'bed', 'However', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'joker', 'acting', 'villain', 'role', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Ledger', 'what', 'few', 'actors', 'playing', 'villains', 'ever', 'have', 'created', 'character', 'so', 'repulsive', 'deranged', 'same', 'time', 'complicated', 'unpredictable', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'sadistic', 'anarchist', 'who', 'sick', 'games', 'force', 'people', 'making', 'wrenching', 'moral', 'choices', 'favorite', 'one', 'where', 'plants', 'two', 'ferries', 'one', 'convicts', 'other', 'civilians', 'passengers', 'ferry', 'detonator', 'bombs', 'other', 'ferry', 'forces', 'make', 'decision', 'midnight', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'what', 'outcome', 'was', 'surprising.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'bit', 'times', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'intricate', 'unrealistic', 'yes', 'know', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Batman', 'still', 'too', 'many', 'points', 'seemed', 'villains', 'sometimes', 'heroes', 'managed', 'install', 'dynamite', 'find', 'people', 'perform', 'other', 'tricks', 'magic', 'movie', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'excuse', 'drive', 'plot', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'rather', 'actually', 'explaining', 'how', 'example', 'Joker', 'entire', 'building', 'plants', 'dynamite', 'two', 'ferries', 'exactly', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Why', 'were', 'dogs', 'such', 'problem', 'Batman', 'how', 'did', 'Joker', 'know', 'exploit', 'way', 'how', 'did', 'Dent', 'escape', 'hospital', 'when', 'blew', 'up', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'leaps', 'Overall', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'great', 'drama', 'tension', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.More', 'seriously', 'thought', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'poor', 'times', 'could', 'barely', 'understand', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'when', 'was', 'Batman', 'sounded', 'muffled', 'coarse', 'other', 'voices', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'across', 'well', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'sound', 'system', ""'ve"", 'used', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'problem', 'stemmed', 'film', 'recording']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659404,A3A6O7SC8LKXDL,B00005JPY0,EPA316,"[1, 2]","I really enjoyed this movie; it may have even topped the 1989 Batman movie in my mind. I liked the pacing of the movie, especially in the second half. The action then just won't let up. There are some overly talky moments, but even that is important for plot exposition. This one doesn't end with Batman the hero, on top of the world. Batman is a hunted fugitive, which is how I think it really should be. No police force in the world would accept a vigilante the way Gotham PD does in the beginning of the movie.Heath Ledger did a great job here, and I don't feel he stole the show like Jack Nicholson did. The scene with him in the hospital with Two-Face was so funny, and also afterward when he blows up the hospital. How ironic that they let the Joker live to the end of this movie, then the actor that played him passed away.I did kind of miss the gothic Tim Burton sets that we have grown used to seeing, but it was interesting seeing Batman operate in a modern skyscraper jungle. As for his gadgets, the tumbler/cycle thing was cool, but his cell phone seeing-through-walls vision thing that Fox (Morgan Freeman) quit over was ""give me a break"" in my opinion. So, at the end of this movie, Batman has lost all his toys, his most trusted associate, and is wanted (for real) by the cops.

659406,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B00005JPY0,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[4, 8]","What can I say? Is it an improvement over Batman Begins? Absolutely. But is it the greatest motion picture ever made?You're kidding, right?As a life-long fan of Batman, from reading the comics in the late 70's & early 80's, to watching reruns of the 60's show, through the movies of the 90's, finishing with the Nolan revival film of today, there's no doubt that Batman is one hero no one can deny. Each one of his many incarnations have had value to me and The Dark Knight is no exception. But to me, is it the ""be all, end all"" of Batman films. Well, I guess it could be if that's what you're after.Truth be told, I found this as much ""fun"" as Batman Begins. From the realistic robbery beginings to the depiction of corruption within a police force, this movie to me played out like ""Batman:The True Story"". Gone was all the flash and spectacle of the original films, replaced with a feel of realism that made you almost frightened to see it. I guess it's just a sign of the times, with the whole world outside the theatre on a forever terrorist alert, that the film take on that vibe on as well. But don't I go to movies to escape that?Heath Ledger was good in this, yes better than Jack Nicholson, but was the performance Oscar worthy? Again, to me, no. In fact, if I didn't see the Joker make-up on his face, I would have assumed he was any generic killer/bad guy from a '00's film wanting to destroy the world in his terrorist-like path. Bale did his usual Batman part just fine, letting the suit do most of the talking, but is it me or does this guy need to reach in his utility belt for a bat-cough drop quick? And as for Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Two-Face, I thought he was great in the part, up until he actually became Two-Face, because through all his portrayal of good guy Dent, I kept wondering how could he go that crazy, dead girlfriend/burnt face and all? Oh, and I almost forgot, why was S*******w in this again? Guess they still have a few toys left over that didn't sell from the first film.Other things I noticed was the lack of a musical score, replaced at times with the most annoying ambient ""eeeeeeeeeeee"" buzzing sound that I quite didn't get, but it did prepare me for some bad things acomin' as an audio cue. And honestly, a good 30 minutes of the film dragged like no tomorrow, and could have been taking out (especially the overseas part).But was I entertained? For the most part yes. The explosions were loud and well shot, the action when on the screen was very visual, and each actor took to their part like it really was them. But does it erase or tarnish my memories of the 90's films that didn't take the material as serious as TDK? No, not even close. Again, it's just a different era. This movie is a reflection of the current times, and these times are alot darker than they used to be and when it comes to Superhero movies, to be taken seriously appearently you need to get real damn serious, and The Dark Knight does in spades. But did it lose something in achieving this goal? Yes, because this movie was not ""fun"" in the least. Amazing, Visual, Expensive, Frightening, Action-Packed...all of these, but ""fun""...no. Why so serious, Batman?Oh yeah, because the world's a cesspool and we're all swimming in it. Thanks for reminding me.Overall, as faithful as the Batworld created by Frank Miller's 1989 The Dark Knight Returns, and very riveting to see and hear.

659409,A1E0APHODMK896,B00005JPY0,"Eric Hildebrand ""Flapdoodle""","[7, 16]","This movie moves faster and is far more entertaining than its predecessor, Batman Begins. But that doesn't say much. Batman Begins was thunderously dull, pretentious and oppressive: its central conceit, that the character of Batman can be made plausible if one spends hours and hours exploring every iota of emotional trauma and angst, and hours and hours more explaining where Batman gets his batsuit, batmobile and other gear, was ludicrous from the start.Conversely, the Dark Knight is not bogged down by any attempt to relate the characters and events to any known reality. Moon-size plot holes, too numerous to count, and cardboard characters populate this film.Batman is portrayed as a boy billionaire, scion of the super-rich, affecting a bored and callous exterior that allegedly conceals profound depths of emotion. He is dependent upon the aid and counsel of 2 old men, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, who run his home and personal life, his finances, and provide him with all the wondrous bat-gizmos.Batman is relentless, and while he allegedly is troubled by the fact that his pursuit of criminals is resulting in collateral damage amounting to the destruction of half the city, he does not let it stop him. He eventually becomes reviled by the citizens he is sworn to protect, but ultimately he keeps his 'resolve.' The Joker is referred to, multiple times, as a 'terrorist.' The Joker himself says he is a 'wild dog,' not motivated by greed or power, merely the joy of destruction. He cannot be rehabilitated, nor can he be appeased by the liberation of a people, nor can he be bought off.Ultimately Batman's pursuit of the Joker results in Batman literally tapping into every cell phone in Gotham City, and in the destruction of much of the supporting cast and a hospital full of patients. Oh, and Batman tortures now. But of course Batman is ultimately successful, and this completes this sadistic bedtime story.Writing this now, having had a shallow boy millionaire and 2 old men 'protecting' me for 8 years, having had them tap my phone and email, and having had them blowing up 2 nations and killing a couple million people in the process, I was not pleased by the results. So pardon me, Chris Nolan, if I happen to think you are unimaginative and cowardly for using your bully pulpit to write this $200 million love letter. A lot of creative people use their position to challenge the status quo, or to promote peace and tolerance, but apparently violence and sadism are more your cup of tea.

It is a great Batman movie, though perhaps it has received more praise than it deserves as a ""philosophical statement."" Primarily it is a great action movie that does not cheat characterization and motivation of the characters.My comments here are on the technical quality of the DVD visuals. I watched on a 900x1440 monitor, and while some scenes looked very good, on other scenes there was easily visible quantization noise (mosquito-like noise) and detail was washed out in some background items like buildings -- i.e. they looked a bit blocky. This looked like a careless transfer to DVD to me, compared to other hit movie DVDs I've seen.I have not seen the Blu-Ray, but from all accounts it is very good. Based on what I see, I will probably wait until I have a Blu-Ray player before I purchase this movie, unless I can pick up a used DVD copy for a few bucks.It's a five-star film, but the DVD is average, at best, in transfer quality. So let's make it a four-star rating on the DVD package.

Milillo ""Emills86""","[4, 6]","Batman is back, taking on the worst villain Gotham City has ever seen, the Joker, marvelously played by Heath Ledger.Critics have been hailing Ledgers performance for weeks now and they are 100% correct.  He is nothing short of amazing, aptly playing a psychopath, a real menace to society, afraid of nothing.  He really stole the show giving the best and most memorable performance of his career.  Ledger should at least be nominated if not win an Oscar for his role in this film.The first time we saw Batman battle the Joker was in 1989 with Tim Burton directing.  Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the original, but if you compare this film with ""The Dark Knight"", its like night and day.  Michael Keaton to me will always be remembered for being the original Batman and Jack Nicholson was so perfect for the Joker.  The film is a classic.  Looking back on it, however, the original seems a bit childish.  Nowadays, a Joker prancing around in a purple suit with dyed green hair and a Batman that can execute a few martial arts maneuvers just doesn't cut it.In a generation that demands action, ""The Dark Knight"" delivers to the tenth degree, giving the most explosive, heart pounding, thrill ride Batman has ever endured.  Not too mention a few plot twists here and there.  Easily the best film of the year.  Fans of the original Batman will not be sorely disappointed, in fact nobody will be.

I am not sure if Heath Ledger surpassed Jack Nicholson as The Joker but he at least equaled him in my opinion!Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent/Two-Face was definitely an improvement from Tommy Lee Jones' version in ""Batman Forever"" though to be fair, TLJ had a lousy script to work with! Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman were their usual solid selves as Alfred and Lucus Fox respectively.The only performances that I thought were just okay were Maggie Gylanhal's performance as Rachel Dawes and Christian Bale himself as Bruce Wayne/Batman! I actually thought Bale was better in ""Batman Begins"" and Katie Holmes was better as Rachel in that film as well.I loved the plot and the way it was just relentless with only a few breaks in the action. The only part that I have a bit of trouble with is the ending. But then again, this is another interpretation of Batman and may not be the Batman we are used to so I will respect what Christopher Nolan has put together.Other than that, I think this is a great blend of action/drama/adventure but I will say that this Batman adventure might not be suitable for young kids. I know if I had children, they'd have to wait to see that one.Now, as for the extras on the two-disc set, I purchased the Blu-Ray version and this is what I found:Disc 1 - The movie itself is on this one. This also has The Dark Knight IMAX scenes that you can watch along with the film or seperately. They are Prologue, Hong Kong, Armored Car Chase, Lamborghini Crash, Prewitt Building and Final Montage.Disc 2 - I am going to break down what's on here:Batman Tech - Originally seen during the Summer of 2008 on The History Channel, this special discusses the weapons and technology that makes Batman the comic legend he is and shows which gagets are actually possible in real life!Batman Unmasked: The Psychology Of The Dark Knight - This was also on The History Channel during the summer and it discusses the psyche of Batman as if he were a real person with both comic writers and psychologists! Batman's enemies such as Two-Face, The Riddler, The Penguin, Catwoman and The Scarecrow are also discussed. Bats' greatest enemy, The Joker, gets his own segment and is discussed as well!Gotham News - Six segments which are done in the style of newscasts and discusses a lot of things not seen in either Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. It also makes things in TDK a lot clearer as these ""news segments"" take place after B.B. and before TDK.My Blu-Ray experience was crisp and clean! An awesome experience with an awesome movie! The only stories that I ever saw that made me feel like this was the animated feature ""Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker"" and The Passion Of The Christ.

I should have known that he had the chops for it by his stunning performance as a gay cowboy in Brokeback Mountain... somehow I guess I had forgotten.The Dark Knight had a darker, more sinister touch to it and it had darker psychological undertones.  There were twists on top of twists on top of even more twists that kept you guessing, too.  Not an easily figured out plot.

The blu-ray version translates the action sequences into a stunning quality fit for anyone who wants to experience the movie as much as possible.  This version, a rather fun variant from the others, features a Joker cover with a fun Joker oriented display on the back detailing the movie.The two villains in the film are, of course, The Joker and Two Face with a few occurrences of Scarecrow.  Batman is effectively pushed aside by Heath Ledger's performance of The Joker, and it's truly a tragedy that Ledger will be unable to play the part again in the future, or any part for that matter.  For this to be his last performance is sadly ironic since it was done so very well. To have pushed Batman aside, however, is forgivable since The Joker is the arch nemesis after all.  It's just unfortunate that Heath's character stops at the end of the film.  One other peeve is how they took care of Harvey Dent's Two Face.

659423,A26NLSTT75FMJM,B00005JPY0,"finulanu ""&#34;the mysterious&#34;""","[6, 8]","In the weeks leading up to its release, The Dark Knight quickly became one of the most anticipated movies of my lifetime, rivaled only by the Lord of the Rings movies. I was quite impressed by Batman Begins, a dark, imaginative reshaping of the Batman franchise after it shot itself in the foot with Batman and Robin, one of those proverbial ""so bad, it's good"" films. But this movie was much better than Batman Begins. It's an unbelievably good movie. It's more than just a superhero movie: it's a crime drama that gives us a good, hard look at the human psyche.First and foremost, the late Heath Ledger's last completed performance as the Joker must be  praised. His Joker describes himself as ""an agent of chaos"" and ""a dog chasing cars [who] wouldn't know what to do with one if [he] caught it."" He has no code of chivalry, no ideals, no goal. He just destroys for the sake of destroying, with little regard for his own safety and none at all for anyone else's. In fact, he goes as far as dubbing an event that could result in the death of hundreds a ""social experiment."" I will never look at a pencil the same way after seeing this film. If you've witnessed the Joker's ""magic trick,"" you'll know what I mean. This general sense of insanity makes him a dangerous villain......and a good opponent for Batman. Christian Bale takes up the Batsuit once more, and he's back in the tortured pathos of the classic role. The Joker really helps exploit Batman's darker side. The central conflict here is in Batman's head - should he abandon his code and do away with the Joker, or is he truly incorruptible? Or will he not kill Joker for a second, more obvious reason: does Batman feel that Joker completes him, the way Joker feels about Batman? That's the point of the movie. Balance. Good and evil can never defeat each other, for one cannot truly exist without the other.Enough philosophizing, though. There's more to praise about this film. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) deserves praise as Gotham City's White Knight. But when a horrible accident occurs, Harvey changes. In another exploration of the darker corners of our minds, the film reveals just what lengths some people will go to bring wrongdoers to justice. Eckhart's transition to Two-Face, and his subsequent conversation with Joker, is one of the many highlights of a spectacular movie.Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are excellent supporters for Batman. Alfred, one of my favorite characters of the whole franchise, drops several nuggets of wisdom throughout the film, and Lucius oozes cool by adding a dry sense of humor. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), the good cop with an edge, is one of the most flat-out likable characters in the series. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is a much better Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes and quite good in her own right - she's tougher, more self-sufficient, more interesting, less of a stock character.The cast is excellent, and the primary reason why I love this film so much. The Joker especially provided many memorable lines. But there's more than just that. The direction and set pieces are stunning. Most of the action takes place at night, in Gotham's slums, which makes the film seem even darker. And the soundtrack is appropriately creepy. The plot is simple - Joker causes chaos, Batman tries to stop him - but it's not the story itself, but what happens within the story, that counts here.I am in awe of this film. I saw it twice in one weekend, and I never see films multiple times. I have friends who don't even like superhero movies that loved The Dark Knight. It's definitely my pick for the best film of 2008 thus far, and it's one of my all-time favorites as well.

659424,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00005JPY0,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[2, 3]","By the time I had finally got around to watching this movie, the hype had already cemented itself in my head. 'It's the greatest super hero EVER!', 'It's one of the greatest movies EVER!' Of course, such hype rarely lives up, but I went in wanting to love this movie. While certainly a great uncharted dimension for super hero movies, certain to shape the future of the genre for the foreseeable future (Superman is already to tread the path towards the dark), it does fall short in key places. So first off, my criticisms on why this movie as a whole doesn't live up to the hype. Unfortunately, to fully explore this qualms that seem to solely bother me, I will have to give a spoiler or two.Firstly, the movie strikes a dark and twisted realism that is very well done, giving a certain tone to the film that separates it from others. It's gritty and chilling to say the least. However, with some glaring moments, Nolan leaves some farcical moments in the movie, for me at least, tarnishing the experience, mainly the unrealistically incometent police force. For example: Leaving the Joker with idiotic guard, going into a known death trap under the overpass... the list just goes on. Now of course, the Gothom City police has never been the brightest, but never to this ridiculous extent.Secondly, while it would be inconsistent with the comics, and a few key themes of the movie, I'm just one of those guys that believes in killing the bad guy so he doesn't come back for a sequel, especially in this case. Now, in the 3rd installment if there's even a passing mention of The Joker, or lack of one, you're going to have a massive elephant in the room... because that's right kids, The Joker, terrorist and mass-murderer at large, lives to see another day. Now I might write this off had Ledger not died, but since his unfortunate death, Nolon knew he couldn't bring the character back in any form, so why not just dispense of the character, especially since this presents no inconvenience, since in the last scene, he's on his way down anyhow. Just let him go, and there's no elephant. Also, A Dark Knight would imply some murder to his methods, as is, he's more of a white knight, because he captures and brings to justice.Speaking of the late great Heath Ledger, his performance is not only his best, but worthy of all the hype. If he doesn't win a post-humous Oscar for this role, it would truly be a crime. Ledger not only gives a creepy and psychotic performance that sends chills down your spine, he completely rewrites the book on the character/psychopathic personality. Hannibal Lector almost looks like Santa Clause comparitavely. The rest of the cast is eqally excellent, from Bale to Gyllenhaal, from Caine to Freeman. Aaron Eckhart on the other hand gives a severely underrated performance, as he gives equally spine-chilling scenes... just not to the caliber as Ledger.Just for kicks, I watched the original 1989 ""Batman."" Comparitevely, the once heralded movie now looks even more of a farce, and an all-out comedy. From tone to acting, to story and everything else, there's no comparison as Nolan has taken Batman from farce to brilliant charactacher. But that doesn't mean this movie is the great, as I would even argue Batman Begins is a little better, and Iron Man still ranks as the greatest super hero movie so far. While putting up excellent performances and quite a few jaw-dropping moments, Dark Knight doesn't follow through, and leaves some rather large elephants in the room. Odds are you'll love this movie, but I'd personally would probably only watch it once.",4,The White Knight Dressed In Black,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,3591,"['time', 'had', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'movie', 'hype', 'had', 'already', 'cemented', 'head', 'greatest', 'super', 'hero', 'EVER', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'EVER', 'course', 'such', 'hype', 'rarely', 'up', 'went', 'wanting', 'love', 'movie', 'certainly', 'great', 'uncharted', 'dimension', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'certain', 'shape', 'future', 'genre', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'Superman', 'already', 'tread', 'path', 'dark', 'fall', 'short', 'key', 'places', 'first', 'off', 'criticisms', 'why', 'movie', 'whole', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'Unfortunately', 'fully', 'explore', 'qualms', 'seem', 'solely', 'bother', 'will', 'have', 'give', 'spoiler', 'two.Firstly', 'movie', 'dark', 'twisted', 'realism', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'giving', 'certain', 'tone', 'film', 'others', 'gritty', 'chilling', 'say', 'least', 'However', 'glaring', 'moments', 'Nolan', 'farcical', 'moments', 'movie', 'least', 'tarnishing', 'experience', 'mainly', 'unrealistically', 'incometent', 'police', 'force', 'example', 'Leaving', 'Joker', 'idiotic', 'guard', 'going', 'known', 'death', 'trap', 'overpass', 'list', 'just', 'Now', 'course', 'Gothom', 'City', 'police', 'never', 'been', 'brightest', 'never', 'ridiculous', 'extent.Secondly', 'would', 'be', 'inconsistent', 'comics', 'few', 'key', 'themes', 'movie', ""'m"", 'just', 'one', 'guys', 'killing', 'bad', 'guy', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'sequel', 'especially', 'case', 'Now', '3rd', 'installment', 'even', 'passing', 'mention', 'Joker', 'lack', 'one', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'massive', 'elephant', 'room', 'right', 'kids', 'Joker', 'terrorist', 'mass-murderer', 'large', 'see', 'day', 'Now', 'might', 'write', 'off', 'had', 'Ledger', 'not', 'died', 'unfortunate', 'death', 'Nolon', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'character', 'back', 'form', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'dispense', 'character', 'especially', 'inconvenience', 'last', 'scene', 'way', 'down', 'anyhow', 'Just', 'let', 'go', 'elephant', 'Also', 'A', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'would', 'imply', 'murder', 'methods', 'more', 'white', 'knight', 'justice.Speaking', 'late', 'great', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'worthy', 'hype', ""n't"", 'win', 'post-humous', 'Oscar', 'role', 'would', 'truly', 'be', 'crime', 'Ledger', 'not', 'only', 'creepy', 'psychotic', 'performance', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'completely', 'book', 'character/psychopathic', 'personality', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'almost', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'comparitavely', 'rest', 'cast', 'eqally', 'excellent', 'Bale', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Caine', 'Freeman', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'other', 'hand', 'severely', 'underrated', 'performance', 'equally', 'spine-chilling', 'scenes', 'just', 'not', 'caliber', 'Ledger.Just', 'kicks', 'watched', 'original', '1989', 'Batman', 'Comparitevely', 'once', 'heralded', 'movie', 'now', 'even', 'more', 'farce', 'all-out', 'comedy', 'tone', 'acting', 'story', 'everything', 'else', 'comparison', 'Nolan', 'taken', 'Batman', 'farce', 'brilliant', 'charactacher', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'great', 'would', 'even', 'argue', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'little', 'better', 'Iron', 'Man', 'still', 'greatest', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'putting', 'up', 'excellent', 'performances', 'quite', 'few', 'jaw-dropping', 'moments', 'Dark', 'Knight', ""n't"", 'follow', 'rather', 'large', 'elephants', 'room', 'are', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', ""'d"", 'personally', 'would', 'probably', 'only', 'watch', 'once']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Ledger did a good albeit OVERLY frightening job as the Joker but Nicholson SMOKES him in acting the part AND staying true to the COMIC BOOK origins of the Joker! Mr. Bale made Bruce Wayne seem like a total A-HOLE who I couldn't even root for. And the ridiculous ""voice"" when he was in Batman mode...silly. I am sure I hear the chuckles of the pompous, self-assured detractors of my point of view now, but allow me to state one more simple fact. This character came from a comic book. These things that apparently only twenty-something, career minded nerds or wealthy middle aged men can afford to buy were, in my day, MADE FOR KIDS!!! In, say...1973 I could go to any five and dime, buy a Batman comic for 20 CENTS and go home and read it!! Was it sometimes ""cheesy""? Yes. Campy? Yes. It was geared for an 11 year old boy!! I would not allow my 11 yr old to see this because it is much too disturbing and ""adult"". Once again I remind you Batman is a COMIC BOOK character.

659427,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00005JPY0,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 2]","THE DARK KNIGHTWhen the Batman franchise was reopened I unlike a lot of other people around was excited for the possibilities of the film. If someone could come in and make a real good Batman film that would be great plus to be honest [here it is] I never hated any of the Batman films. The old school one is just that and that makes it fun, the first two Burton ones were really good in my opinion, and the final three were very cartoon/comic style fun. There I said it I found a reason to like each one even though they got less great as they went along. Then came ""Batman Begins"" which is arguably the best in the series and of all comic book films, I can see the case made for it.So after that one I knew the next would be just as good if not better with the inclusion of the Joker. The hype surrounding this film was extraordinary but I think it was well deserved as I loved this film. Now sure there was a lot of additional hype since one of the stars passed away right before the films release but even without that I think this film would still have done the numbers it did. I mean sure that added some I am sure but there is all the batman fans, DC comics fans, comic fans in general, fans of the film before this one, action fans and well fans of just good movies. There was a lot this film had going for it and thankfully it delivered on all fronts.With excellent writing and picture perfect direction from Christopher Nolan this film could not help but be great. The best thing about it still is the performances and of course you know who I mean. Heath Ledger did an outstanding job on this film with his portrayal of the Joker. Now the Joker is very arguably the greatest villain in all of comics, in fact I really thing he is. But he could also be the greatest villain in all creative history, especially this version of him. Now the comparisons started immediately with Ledger's Joker and Nicholson's Joker but to be honest you can not compare the two. They are two different versions of the same character in two different films, each one very much compliments and steals the show in their respective film.Aside from Ledger [I could go on about his performance but every one else has] there is our lead Christian Bale who like in the first does a great job here. Aaron Eckhart is absolutely wonderful as Harvey Dent better known as Two Face, great performance there. Michael Caine once again is the perfect Alfred for these new films as is Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the new Rachel and a better one I think, and of course the always brilliant Morgan Freeman is just that, brilliant. On a side note I loved that Cillian Murphy reprised his role of the Scarecrow in this film, brief but great.I am sure you all know the story by now, a crazed madman [I guess they mean the same thing] comes lurking into town and offers the mob his services in killing Batman. His name is the Joker and he knows what he is doing, he is very good at doing that in which is what he does. Basically he knows how to cause chaos better than any one ever, and he is very very good at it. Enter Batman who is there to take up the challenge but Joker has a side game going, one that involves a man named Harvey Dent. When all is said and done the Joker will be changing the outlook of this city.The reviews are many on this film so for more in depth details about any of this read those, I am very late to the party reviewing this mainly because I never felt the need to repeat every one else. But alas here I am stuck in my ways and have to get something out there. So here it is world I very much recommend this film and if you have yet to see it, BUY IT NOW.",5,ONE OF THE BEST COMIC FILMS EVER,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,3681,"['DARK', 'KNIGHTWhen', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'was', 'reopened', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'was', 'excited', 'possibilities', 'film', 'someone', 'could', 'come', 'make', 'real', 'good', 'Batman', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'be', 'honest', '[', 'here', ']', 'never', 'hated', 'Batman', 'films', 'old', 'school', 'one', 'just', 'fun', 'first', 'two', 'Burton', 'ones', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'opinion', 'final', 'three', 'were', 'very', 'cartoon/comic', 'style', 'fun', 'said', 'found', 'reason', 'like', 'one', 'even', 'got', 'less', 'great', 'went', 'along', 'Then', 'came', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'arguably', 'best', 'series', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'can', 'see', 'case', 'made', 'it.So', 'one', 'knew', 'next', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'inclusion', 'Joker', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'film', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'loved', 'film', 'Now', 'sure', 'was', 'lot', 'additional', 'hype', 'one', 'stars', 'passed', 'away', 'right', 'films', 'release', 'even', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'done', 'numbers', 'did', 'mean', 'sure', 'added', 'am', 'sure', 'batman', 'fans', 'DC', 'comics', 'fans', 'comic', 'fans', 'general', 'fans', 'film', 'one', 'action', 'fans', 'well', 'fans', 'just', 'good', 'movies', 'was', 'lot', 'film', 'had', 'going', 'thankfully', 'delivered', 'fronts.With', 'excellent', 'writing', 'picture', 'perfect', 'direction', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'great', 'best', 'thing', 'still', 'performances', 'course', 'know', 'who', 'mean', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Joker', 'Now', 'Joker', 'very', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'villain', 'comics', 'fact', 'really', 'thing', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'greatest', 'villain', 'creative', 'history', 'especially', 'version', 'Now', 'comparisons', 'started', 'immediately', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'be', 'honest', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'versions', 'same', 'character', 'two', 'different', 'films', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'compliments', 'show', 'respective', 'film.Aside', 'Ledger', '[', 'could', 'go', 'performance', 'one', 'else', ']', 'lead', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'first', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'better', 'known', 'Two', 'Face', 'great', 'performance', 'there', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'once', 'again', 'perfect', 'Alfred', 'new', 'films', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'new', 'Rachel', 'better', 'one', 'think', 'course', 'always', 'brilliant', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'just', 'brilliant', 'side', 'note', 'loved', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'reprised', 'role', 'Scarecrow', 'film', 'brief', 'great.I', 'am', 'sure', 'know', 'story', 'now', 'crazed', 'madman', '[', 'guess', 'mean', 'same', 'thing', ']', 'lurking', 'town', 'mob', 'services', 'killing', 'Batman', 'name', 'Joker', 'what', 'doing', 'very', 'good', 'doing', 'what', 'Basically', 'how', 'cause', 'chaos', 'better', 'one', 'ever', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Enter', 'Batman', 'who', 'there', 'take', 'up', 'challenge', 'Joker', 'side', 'game', 'going', 'one', 'man', 'named', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'Joker', 'will', 'be', 'changing', 'outlook', 'city.The', 'reviews', 'are', 'many', 'film', 'so', 'more', 'depth', 'details', 'read', 'am', 'very', 'late', 'party', 'reviewing', 'mainly', 'never', 'felt', 'need', 'repeat', 'one', 'else', 'here', 'am', 'stuck', 'ways', 'have', 'get', 'something', 'there', 'So', 'here', 'world', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'film', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'BUY', 'IT', 'NOW']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659429,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B00005JPY0,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[2, 3]","The Dark Knight is the next installment in the Batman series right after Batman Begins. Unless you lived in a cave, you knew that there was quite a bit of hubbub about the movie's opening in the box office last year. The film's hype lasted quite awhile, and the movie was a huge success by both critics and in sales. It is second only to Titanic as the highest grossing film of all time. With that said, perhaps the bigger question is whether years down the road this film will have a place with the great films of all-time.More so than any other Batman film, The Dark Knight seems to examine and dissect the psychology of good and evil. Unlike many other villains, Heath Ledger's Joker does not seem to have any driving force behind his apparent madness and evil. He is just evil for the sake of it, just to be on the opposite side of justice.  Morgan Freeman's character probably sums up the Joker the best when he says that ""some men just want to see the world burn."" Being that Batman and the Lieutenant can't put a finger on this force of evil, stopping the Joker's destruction and antics becomes one of his biggest challenges. This Joker is adept at understanding others, and his seems to have a knack for pitting humans against each other, and getting to the root and instinctual evil in others; he knows how to get under one's skin. This makes him a truly profound villain.Moreover, this is a film that truly epitomizes darkness in its symbolic sense. Chaos becomes a part of Gotham makeup once the Joker takes over, but chaos and evil are depicted as an idea as much as a crime. Unlike many of Batman's dilemmas in other films, this is one where there is no perfect answer. In this way, this film, much like its predecessor, Batman Begins, involves the hero having to look inward into his soul to find strength, as oppose to using sheer physical prowess to try to vanquish the dark side. And, thus, the ending leaves us to have to interpret whether Batman truly did make the right decision.The Dark Knight is a fantastic film which definitely lives up to its hype: something hard to do in today's era of movie making.",5,Good vs. Evil,1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,2126,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'next', 'installment', 'Batman', 'series', 'right', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'lived', 'cave', 'knew', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'hubbub', 'movie', 'opening', 'box', 'office', 'last', 'year', 'film', 'hype', 'lasted', 'quite', 'awhile', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'success', 'critics', 'sales', 'second', 'only', 'Titanic', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'time', 'said', 'perhaps', 'bigger', 'question', 'years', 'road', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'place', 'great', 'films', 'all-time.More', 'so', 'other', 'Batman', 'film', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'examine', 'dissect', 'psychology', 'good', 'evil', 'many', 'other', 'villains', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'driving', 'force', 'apparent', 'madness', 'evil', 'just', 'evil', 'sake', 'just', 'be', 'opposite', 'side', 'justice', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'probably', 'sums', 'up', 'Joker', 'best', 'when', 'men', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'world', 'burn', 'Being', 'Batman', 'Lieutenant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'force', 'evil', 'stopping', 'Joker', 'destruction', 'antics', 'one', 'biggest', 'challenges', 'Joker', 'adept', 'understanding', 'others', 'have', 'knack', 'pitting', 'humans', 'other', 'getting', 'root', 'instinctual', 'evil', 'others', 'how', 'get', 'one', 'skin', 'truly', 'profound', 'villain.Moreover', 'film', 'truly', 'darkness', 'symbolic', 'sense', 'Chaos', 'part', 'Gotham', 'makeup', 'once', 'Joker', 'chaos', 'evil', 'are', 'depicted', 'idea', 'as', 'much', 'crime', 'many', 'Batman', 'dilemmas', 'other', 'films', 'one', 'where', 'perfect', 'answer', 'way', 'film', 'much', 'predecessor', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'hero', 'having', 'look', 'inward', 'soul', 'find', 'strength', 'oppose', 'using', 'sheer', 'physical', 'prowess', 'try', 'vanquish', 'dark', 'side', 'thus', 'ending', 'have', 'interpret', 'Batman', 'truly', 'did', 'make', 'right', 'decision.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'fantastic', 'film', 'definitely', 'up', 'hype', 'something', 'hard', 'do', 'today', 'era', 'movie', 'making']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659436,A11EQY5UW4GNL8,B00005JPY0,Gaetano Brown,"[0, 1]","Christopher Nolan returns for this sequel to Batman Begins.The story pretty much picks up where Batman Begins left off. We see Bruce struggling with his normal life and his life as Batman. However, now he has a new villian on his hands The Joker. The Joker is a sick and twisted character who tells everyone he wants Batman to take off his mask or innocent people will die. This turns the city against Batman. The story also involves Harvey Dent (Two-Face), Gothams District Attorney, who Bruce sees as the person that Batman can never be and believes in Harvey Dent to bring order to the city.Like most Batman films, this film is very uneven with its plot and a lot of it is rather tough to keep up with. I really felt they should have saved Two-Face for a sequel because there was already so much story with the Joker and it just felt way too crowded when they brought in Two-Face.From an acting standpoint, this is probably one of the best Batman movies in that department. The acting is very oscar worthy with actors like Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, and of course Heath Ledger dominanting the screen. I have to be honest, i had my doubts about Ledger playing the Joker because his track record in film didn't really inspire a lot of confidence for a character like the Joker but Ledger performance is absolutely legendary. Aaron Eckhart is also very good as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, he does have his moments when he can be over the top but for some reason that works very well.  But some bad acting does manage to hit the screen and this is mainly from Christian Bale. Bale, on his own, is a very good actor but for some reason his acting ability seems to fall straight south when it comes to playing Batman.

That alone makes the newest The Dark Knight a cinematic event that must be seen by any cinema lover.I liked the latest in the series of Batman movies a lot. It is dynamic, appropriately dark and bleak, it is shot amazingly, staged artistically, the music by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer truly adds to the atmosphere. On the top of it, it is cleverly written and gives each character time and chance to become interesting and compelling. With all that said I don't believe that The Dark Knight is the best movie ever and deserves its present #1 spot on the list of Top 250 film on IMDb.com. As the story of Bruce Wayne goes, I liked the previous Nolan's movie ""Batman Begins"" where Christian Bale had much more to work with better. There were also the moments in the film that made me laugh while laughing was not exactly the emotion expected in the particular scenes. It has to do with the habit of one of the characters to flip a coin while deciding on very grave matters. When the character flipped the coin third or fourth time, I was ready to address him, ""Call it, firend-o"".But - where the movie truly fascinates is without a doubt Heath Ledger's performance. He is a reason enough to see the movie. I noticed that when he was not on screen, I could not wait for him to appear; the film seemed to lose its appeal without him. All actors were very good, especially Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart, and their characters were not caricatures but interesting deep persons but Ledger towered everyone. It was his show and he ran it. His Joker that reminds a lot another fun loving villain, ""horoshiy mal'chik Alex DeLarge, is absolutely brilliant and sadly the last work of the young actor who never got a chance to see his triumph on the screen and who without doubt will become a cult figure, an icon as it had happened with James Dean over 50 years ago4.5/9 or 9/10",4,"Bruce Almighty against the Man who laughs at his own jokes or Call it, Harvey...",1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,2184,"['Not', 'day', 'month', 'even', 'year', 'movie', 'up', 'first', 'weekend', 'jumps', 'number', '1', 'position', 'list', 'best', 'movies', 'decided', 'international', 'movies', 'watching', 'community', 'leaving', 'such', 'giants', 'Godfather', 'II', 'Wait', 'second', 'practically', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'alone', 'newest', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'cinematic', 'event', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'cinema', 'lover.I', 'liked', 'latest', 'series', 'Batman', 'movies', 'lot', 'dynamic', 'appropriately', 'dark', 'bleak', 'shot', 'amazingly', 'staged', 'artistically', 'music', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'truly', 'atmosphere', 'top', 'cleverly', 'written', 'character', 'time', 'chance', 'become', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'present', '1', 'spot', 'list', 'Top', '250', 'film', 'IMDb.com', 'story', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'liked', 'previous', 'Nolan', 'movie', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'where', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'work', 'better', 'were', 'also', 'moments', 'film', 'made', 'laughing', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'emotion', 'expected', 'particular', 'scenes', 'do', 'habit', 'one', 'characters', 'flip', 'coin', 'deciding', 'very', 'grave', 'matters', 'When', 'character', 'flipped', 'coin', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'was', 'ready', 'address', 'Call', 'firend-o', '.But', 'where', 'movie', 'truly', 'fascinates', 'doubt', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'reason', 'enough', 'see', 'movie', 'noticed', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'screen', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'appear', 'film', 'seemed', 'lose', 'appeal', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'caricatures', 'interesting', 'deep', 'persons', 'Ledger', 'towered', 'everyone', 'was', 'show', 'ran', 'Joker', 'lot', 'fun', 'loving', 'villain', 'horoshiy', ""mal'chik"", 'Alex', 'DeLarge', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'sadly', 'last', 'work', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'triumph', 'screen', 'who', 'doubt', 'will', 'become', 'cult', 'figure', 'icon', 'had', 'happened', 'James', 'Dean', '50', 'years', 'ago4.5/9', '9/10']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

A great ensemble cast mixed with fantastic a fantastic writer and composer turns this movie into more than just a great superhero flick but a cinematic achievement!The film may be a little overhyped but it definitely deserves the ratings it receives. Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne/Batman (despite his somewhat amusing voice as Batman), Gary Oldman really shines as Jim Gordon (in fact I view him as the best part of the film), Aaron Eckhart surprises us all as Harvey Dent along with his alter-ego. Heath Ledger does a very memorable performance as The Joker. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine also does great in their roles and adds icing to the already very delicious cake! The film is a great mix of action, drama, and a bit of comedy(just a bit).

Dowling,"[3, 4]","This is a review of the Blu-ray not the movie (per se), but I'm sure I don't have to convince anyone reading this that the movie is brilliantly done.  Terrific comic book story done as a gritty, realistic, and often terrifying tale of morality, corruption, and the choices we make.  Heath Ledger deserved his posthumous Oscar for making the Joker a true figure of evil, as it is not enough for him to be evil himself and do evil, but he must prove everyone else is as evil as he is by placing them deliberately in situations where they have to make impossible choices.  ""Die a hero or live long enough to watch yourself become the villain"" says Harvey Dent (Two Face) who sadly lives up ton this passage.  For as hyped as the movie was, it was till underratedn and delivered in every respect.  Bale is superb once again. Gyllenhall is a fine replacement for Katey Homes (did anyone actually miss her?), Eckhart is heartbreaking as Dent.  Gary Oldman (cast against type) is a remarkable everyman hero in the story as Gordon.  Ledger (aided by the brilliant screenplay) does not make the Joker another over the top, try hard to be entertaining villain...He's a true Boogeyman.  Terrifying, sadistic, and utterly beyond all redemption.  ""The Dark Knight""  lets good and evil have a lot of shades of gray.  Unlike the recent ""Avatar"" which  never takes the risk of letting it's characters occupy middle ground (a lazy exercise really).  In Avatar, the baddies are bad and the goodies are good.  There's no room for characters to make choices, making for s story far less involving.  ""The Dark Knight"" has us more involved in the story than the effects or technical elements.  That's where the movie's longevity as one of the greats will come from.  ""Avatar's"" will wear off after the technology is exceeded and we are left to reconcile the story.Now for the BD cut.  The standard dvd was a darn handsome transfer with a ribust soundtrack.  This high def version is stunning to behold.  Crisp, detailed, razor sharp imagery.  The colors and blacks are inky and fully saturated.  The change between IMAX and 2:35 is awesome and makes the film more of an experience.  There is no digital noise, aliasing, halos, or banding present.  Blacks are beautifully rendered and never crushed, which is quite something given how dark the movie is.  The sound is a pulverizing Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The bass is foundation shking, with exhilarating ambient and directional sound effects.  Dialogue is crisp and never muddled.

He gets hurt, and he feels real pain-physical and emotional.Secondly, there is a love triangle-Bruce, Rachel and Harvey.  Rachel is torn between her love for Bruce, her childhood sweetheart, who she knows is Batman, and Harvey who is every woman's White Knight who is fighting for truth and justice in the judicial halls of Gotham with danger and enemies on every side.  Harvey is as pure as they come in true comic book lore.Thirdly, every hero needs their personal entourage.  Batman has Alfred and Lucius. Harvey has Rachel and Jim Gordon.Fourthly, every hero needs a nemesis.  The usual assortment of 30's type gangsters are for comic relief.  The real nemesis, antagonist, for both Batman and Harvey Dent is the Joker, a psychotic rogue.  The Joker's insanity is his genius, a pure sociopath who was abused by his father.Fifthly, you have the citizens of Gotham who both Batman and Harvey are pledged to protect, even though, there are moments when you wonder why since truth and justice to the citizenry is great as long as they don't have to sacrifice themselves for it. This film shows human nature at its worst and its best.Sixthly, the noble elements of morality, friendship, love, and sacrifice have their part in a saga which plays out in the lives projected on the screen before us. Like a Greek tragedy we are shocked and silently weep for the heroes as they march to their fate, predestined by the gods for their own amusements.The Dark Knight is a dark, disturbing piece of film fiction.  Children would find the images haunting their sub consciences for decades to come.  It is an intense film which brings a number of motifs together in a cohesive script.All great stories share elements of triumph and tragedy.  A hero's personal lost can take many forms.  Both Batman and Harvey react differently to their mutual lost.The ideal hero is not always the hero presented to the public.  One classic example of this is THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE. Sometimes, the lie is more important than the truth.In the end Batman makes an unalterable decision like Harvey Dent.  Batman's ultimate sacrifice for Gotham City is a testament that sometimes a hero must become the villain for the greater good.Jim Gordon becomes the bridge between the truth and the lie of these two true human heroes.",5,The Dark Knight,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,2423,"['Dark', 'KnightFirst', 'Dark', 'Knight/Batman', 'not', 'super', 'hero', 'very', 'human', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'super', 'hero', 'feats', 'hurt', 'real', 'pain-physical', 'emotional.Secondly', 'love', 'triangle-Bruce', 'Rachel', 'Harvey', 'Rachel', 'torn', 'love', 'Bruce', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'who', 'Batman', 'Harvey', 'who', 'woman', 'White', 'Knight', 'who', 'fighting', 'truth', 'justice', 'judicial', 'halls', 'Gotham', 'danger', 'enemies', 'side', 'Harvey', 'as', 'pure', 'come', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'lore.Thirdly', 'hero', 'personal', 'entourage', 'Batman', 'Alfred', 'Lucius', 'Harvey', 'Rachel', 'Jim', 'Gordon.Fourthly', 'hero', 'nemesis', 'usual', 'assortment', '30', 'type', 'gangsters', 'are', 'comic', 'relief', 'real', 'nemesis', 'antagonist', 'Batman', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Joker', 'psychotic', 'rogue', 'Joker', 'insanity', 'genius', 'pure', 'sociopath', 'who', 'was', 'abused', 'father.Fifthly', 'have', 'citizens', 'Gotham', 'who', 'Batman', 'Harvey', 'are', 'pledged', 'protect', 'even', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'wonder', 'why', 'truth', 'justice', 'citizenry', 'great', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sacrifice', 'film', 'human', 'nature', 'worst', 'best.Sixthly', 'noble', 'elements', 'morality', 'friendship', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'have', 'part', 'saga', 'out', 'lives', 'projected', 'screen', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'are', 'shocked', 'silently', 'weep', 'heroes', 'march', 'fate', 'predestined', 'gods', 'own', 'amusements.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'piece', 'film', 'fiction', 'Children', 'would', 'find', 'images', 'haunting', 'sub', 'consciences', 'decades', 'come', 'intense', 'film', 'number', 'motifs', 'together', 'cohesive', 'script.All', 'great', 'stories', 'share', 'elements', 'triumph', 'tragedy', 'hero', 'personal', 'lost', 'can', 'take', 'many', 'forms', 'Batman', 'Harvey', 'react', 'differently', 'mutual', 'lost.The', 'ideal', 'hero', 'not', 'always', 'hero', 'presented', 'public', 'One', 'classic', 'example', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'SHOT', 'LIBERTY', 'VALANCE', 'Sometimes', 'lie', 'more', 'important', 'truth.In', 'end', 'Batman', 'unalterable', 'decision', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Batman', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'Gotham', 'City', 'testament', 'hero', 'must', 'become', 'villain', 'greater', 'good.Jim', 'Gordon', 'bridge', 'truth', 'lie', 'two', 'true', 'human', 'heroes']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Even before I entered the cinema to see this film, I was pretty certain that it wasn't actually going to be better than ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and watching it simply served to confirm this fact. Nevertheless, based on the hype, I did expect to see an above average movie and I left the cinema feeling disappointed. Not only is ""The Dark Knight"" not the best film of all time, it is also not the best Batman movie (I still think ""Batman Returns"" is better) and it's not even Heath Ledger's best film (that would be ""Two Hands"").The problem with ""The Dark Knight"" lies in writer/director Christopher Nolan's lack of restraint. ""The Dark Knight"" is essentially two movies joined together - one about the Joker (Heath Ledger) and the other about District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who ultimately becomes the villain Two Face. If Nolan had simply chosen one of these stories and focussed on it, this could have been a good film, but instead, by shifting from the Joker story to the Two Face story mid-way through the film, Nolan causes the film to lose focus and reduces the impact of the final battle between Batman and the Joker, which should have been a lot better than it is.Furthermore, within each of these stories, there is a lot of extraneous material that should have been cut out. ""The Dark Knight"" is over 2  hour long and feels it. A lot of the scenes in the film, although interesting if taken on their own (such as the boat scene at the end of the film), do not contribute to the overall story. If Christopher Nolan was as great a film maker as many people claim that he is, then he should have recognized this and removed them. Instead he self-indulgently leaves them in, proving what I have always thought, that he one of the most over-rated directors of recent years.",2,Self-Indulgent and Unfocussed,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,1958,"['time', 'writing', 'review', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'currently', 'number', '1', 'film', 'IMdB', 'Top', '250', 'beating', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Godfather', 'Even', 'entered', 'cinema', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'certain', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'going', 'be', 'better', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'watching', 'simply', 'served', 'confirm', 'fact', 'Nevertheless', 'based', 'hype', 'did', 'expect', 'see', 'above', 'average', 'movie', 'left', 'cinema', 'feeling', 'disappointed', 'Not', 'only', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'time', 'also', 'not', 'best', 'Batman', 'movie', 'still', 'think', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'better', 'not', 'even', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'best', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Two', 'Hands', '.The', 'problem', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'writer/director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'lack', 'restraint', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'essentially', 'two', 'movies', 'joined', 'together', 'one', 'Joker', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'other', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'ultimately', 'villain', 'Two', 'Face', 'Nolan', 'had', 'simply', 'chosen', 'one', 'stories', 'focussed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'instead', 'shifting', 'Joker', 'story', 'Two', 'Face', 'story', 'mid-way', 'film', 'Nolan', 'film', 'lose', 'focus', 'impact', 'final', 'battle', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'is.Furthermore', 'stories', 'lot', 'extraneous', 'material', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'Dark', 'Knight', '2', 'hour', 'long', 'feels', 'lot', 'scenes', 'film', 'interesting', 'taken', 'own', 'such', 'boat', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'contribute', 'overall', 'story', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'maker', 'many', 'people', 'claim', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'recognized', 'removed', 'Instead', 'self-indulgently', 'proving', 'what', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'one', 'most', 'over-rated', 'directors', 'recent', 'years']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

After a terrific chase scene involving several truck's and the Bat-cycle (or however you want to call it) I started to think perhaps we were at the end of the movie, little did I know the entirety of Act III was still ahead of us and with it the floor was about to be taken from under our feet again and again.

I haven't seen any of the 'modern era' Batman movies, just one of Superman and the first Spiderman. I haven't seen the Hulk, the Iron Man, or the Catwoman, either, so maybe my opinion isn't worth much, but I was bored by The Dark Knight. I wanted it to end long before the final rampage, and especially before the preachy and inconsistent climax on the two ferries, when ordinary people turn out to have good-guy core values even after they've proven just the opposite all the way through the film.Okay, so Heath Ledger was brilliantly weird. Why he should be regarded as a supporting actor I can't comprehend, since he was the only person who was 'acting' in the whole flick. The others were just wearing their make-up and trying to remember their blocking. Ledger's performance was not enough to shed human interest on the special effects, particularly since they were so corny. There was no humanity, no human issue, in this film. Even Spiderman had plausible human dilemmas.There was a lot of blatant ""moral philosophy"", however. A lot of jabber and symbolism about 'good and evil', and since it was the part of the film that, people told me, raised it above the ordinary, I think I have at least an outsider's right to react to the morality being preached, which was an extreme version of the Objectivists' 'special person' quasi-Nietzschean superman morality, the same morality as that of Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment, the morality that claims the authority to defy society for society's good. It's the morality of Jack Bauer, the torture specialist in the TV show 24. Closer to real time, it's exactly the morality of Mohammed Atta, Timothy McVeigh, and Dick Cheney. It's not good enough for the kids who read comics and it's not good enough for the adults who have to make sense of modern times.

You do the math.Everybody knows the story.  Everybody knows the characters.Let's talk about the product itself.  It comes with two Blu-Ray discs plus an ""electronic"" copy for your computer.  The first disc is the ""money disc"".  It holds the movie and over an hour of special features that could stand on their own -- without the movie.  The special features pull back the curtain on the movie-making process and reveal some remarkable facts about this movie.  (no spoilers here!) I replayed several portions of the special features.  Ok, one non-spoiler is how they prepared for the Hong Kong stunts.  A stuntman actually leaps off of a building while attached to a bungee cord...which is connected to a helicopter.  The video shows the man doing a swan dive off a huge building (had to be 30+ stories).  You see him just fly through the air and appear to be heading directly into the side of another building.  The helicopter takes up the slack and the guy just floats in the air waving to people down below.  The shot is just...it took my breath away.Ok, one more.  Another segment shows how the semi flipped in the downtown scene.Oh, and the ""wacker drive"" chase is taken apart piece by piece.  You get to see several camera views that were not in the movie.Disc 1 is a goldmine.There is also a BD-Live component that I didn't test.  It involves something about adding your own commentary or clips.  Nothing spectacular.The second disc has more fluff and filler on it.  There's an hour long piece on how Batman developed and claims to delve into Batman's psychology.  In truth, it was poorly produced and poorly written.  The amount of comics involved also turned me off to it.  The other piece on disc 2 was so uninteresting that I've already forgotten it.Packaging is up to par.

It's full of literally hundreds of lapses in plot, logic, realism, consistency, fidelity to the comics, etc...Christian Bale and not-Katie-Holmes have attended the Matrix School of Non-Acting. Morgan Freeman plays the SAME CHARACTER THAT HE HAS PLAYED IN EVERY MOVIE THAT HE HAS EVER BEEN IN. The plot is simply impossible to follow and has holes ranging from the timing of the bank robbery to the decision to blame Batman for deaths that he could not have possibly caused (like the driver of the car that was transporting Harvey). Batman can fall from literally any height and suffer no injuries whatsoever as long as he lands on a car. The cars in Gotham City are apparently made of pillows. Gun barrels seems to be made of similarly flimsy material. Cutting someone's cheek open kills them instantly. The Joker is the most inconsistent character ever written. He wants to kill Batman, then he doesn't. He has some high-minded ideology about Gotham deserving a ""better class of criminal"", then has no ideology except wanting to watch the world burn. He hatches impossibly elaborate plans and plots that would put even the Riddler to shame, then talks about how he has no plans and just likes to annoy people who do have them. WTF. The ""save Harvey or save not-Katie-Holmes"" thing was a TOTAL ripoff of the Green Goblin's similar stunt in Spider-Man 1... which was, in turn, a ripoff of a similar scene in Batman Forever. Harvey's conversion to the ""dark side"" was even more sudden and unconvincing than Anakin's in Revenge of the Sith (""Let's see, do I kill the guy who killed my girlfriend, or kill the guy who tried to save her? Gee, that's a tough one! I think I'll toss a coin to decide""). The only believable thing about Two-Face was the makeup/CGI job, which was outstanding and flawless, and is the REAL Oscar material of the movie. The nonsense with the ferry boats was cheap and annoying, and carried no real suspense. And instead of winding up to a climax, the story just dragged on and on and on... and on. And on.The Joker of the comic books had genuinely white skin and green hair as a result of a toxic chemical bath, used lethal pranks like the acid-squirting flower and a joy buzzer that electrocuted people, and liked to use a special gas/venom that caused its victims to laugh themselves to death. The Tim Burton/Jack Nicholson Joker lived up to this. The Chis Nolan/Heath Ledger Joker is just some deranged guy in makeup who has nothing to do with the comic books. Of course, neither of them came close to Mark Hamill in the animated series, but that's a whole different discussion...All of this covers less than ten percent of what is wrong with The Dark Knight.The whole thing is a mess and a disappointment.",1,Most overrated movie EVER,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,2784,"['easily', 'most', 'overrated', 'movie', 'time', 'full', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'lapses', 'plot', 'logic', 'realism', 'consistency', 'fidelity', 'comics', 'etc', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'not-Katie-Holmes', 'have', 'attended', 'Matrix', 'School', 'Non-Acting', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'SAME', 'CHARACTER', 'THAT', 'HE', 'HAS', 'PLAYED', 'IN', 'EVERY', 'MOVIE', 'HE', 'HAS', 'EVER', 'BEEN', 'IN', 'plot', 'simply', 'impossible', 'follow', 'holes', 'ranging', 'timing', 'bank', 'robbery', 'decision', 'blame', 'Batman', 'deaths', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'possibly', 'caused', 'driver', 'car', 'was', 'transporting', 'Harvey', 'Batman', 'can', 'fall', 'literally', 'height', 'suffer', 'injuries', 'whatsoever', 'as', 'long', 'car', 'cars', 'Gotham', 'City', 'are', 'apparently', 'made', 'pillows', 'Gun', 'barrels', 'be', 'made', 'similarly', 'flimsy', 'material', 'Cutting', 'someone', 'cheek', 'open', 'kills', 'instantly', 'Joker', 'most', 'inconsistent', 'character', 'ever', 'written', 'kill', 'Batman', 'then', ""n't"", 'high-minded', 'ideology', 'Gotham', 'deserving', 'better', 'class', 'criminal', 'then', 'ideology', 'wanting', 'watch', 'world', 'burn', 'impossibly', 'elaborate', 'plans', 'plots', 'would', 'put', 'even', 'Riddler', 'shame', 'then', 'talks', 'how', 'plans', 'just', 'likes', 'annoy', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'have', 'WTF', 'save', 'Harvey', 'save', 'not-Katie-Holmes', 'thing', 'was', 'TOTAL', 'ripoff', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'similar', 'stunt', 'Spider-Man', '1', 'was', 'turn', 'ripoff', 'similar', 'scene', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'Harvey', 'conversion', 'dark', 'side', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'sudden', 'unconvincing', 'Anakin', 'Revenge', 'Sith', 'Let', 'see', 'do', 'kill', 'guy', 'who', 'killed', 'girlfriend', 'kill', 'guy', 'who', 'tried', 'save', 'Gee', 'tough', 'one', 'think', ""'ll"", 'toss', 'coin', 'decide', 'only', 'believable', 'thing', 'Two-Face', 'was', 'makeup/CGI', 'job', 'was', 'outstanding', 'flawless', 'REAL', 'Oscar', 'material', 'movie', 'nonsense', 'ferry', 'boats', 'was', 'cheap', 'annoying', 'carried', 'real', 'suspense', 'instead', 'winding', 'up', 'climax', 'story', 'just', 'dragged', 'on.The', 'Joker', 'comic', 'books', 'had', 'genuinely', 'white', 'skin', 'green', 'hair', 'result', 'toxic', 'chemical', 'bath', 'used', 'lethal', 'pranks', 'acid-squirting', 'flower', 'joy', 'buzzer', 'electrocuted', 'people', 'liked', 'use', 'special', 'gas/venom', 'caused', 'victims', 'laugh', 'death', 'Tim', 'Burton/Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'lived', 'up', 'Chis', 'Nolan/Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'just', 'deranged', 'guy', 'makeup', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'comic', 'books', 'course', 'came', 'close', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'animated', 'series', 'whole', 'different', 'discussion', 'less', 'ten', 'percent', 'what', 'wrong', 'Dark', 'Knight.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'mess', 'disappointment']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

There are great performances, notably the sadly late Heath Ledger's performance as the joker.  It is extremely memorable, and lives up to its hype.  Ledger doesn't copy Nicholson's campy, silly performance in the original movie.  He completely goes the opposite way, and creates an extremely creepy and quite unsettling character.  He really steals the film, and it's sad to watch because he died of a stupid drug overdose, and this is his last major work.  Oldman is quite subdued (and excellent) as the commissioner, Bale is good as Batman, Eckhart is good as Two-Face/the DA, Michael Caine brings dignity to the role of Alfred, and Maggie Glynenthal is good as well.  Morgan Freeman, as great as he is, is really wasted here.  His character is completely superfluous.There is some great dialogue, but there's also a lot of awful dialogue.  I know it's a comic book movie, but if you try and apply any real logic to this film, it falls apart.  We never see the Joker set up any of his elaborate schemes, and considering he's a completely pyschopath and enjoys killing people at random, who would really want to work for the man?  The Joker's schemes are so outlandish that you can't believe them for a second.  How does the Joker manage to convince so many people to work for him?  Does he have that much pull?  Does the mob have all that pull?  It's probably best not to think about it all.  The film is meant to operate on a visceral level, methinks.  I haven't read the original comic books, but perhaps I should.  Maybe they made more sense.  The action scenes are, for the most part, perfunctory.  They don't have any real drive or creativity.  In fact, they're rather dull, surprisingly.The film runs 2 1/2 hours, and it should have been trimmed a bit, perhaps to two 1/4 hours.  There's quite a lot of boring, expository dialogue here, and overall the film feels lengthy.  However, the climax is excellent, surprising, and a good conclusion to the film.  So, overall, it's worth seeing, but it's a very mixed bag.  It doesn't live up to its hype, but it's still worth checking out, especially for Ledger's excellent performance.",3,"A very mixed bag, brilliance mixed with blandness....",1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,2217,"['Well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'honestly', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'heard', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'notably', 'sadly', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'joker', 'extremely', 'memorable', 'up', 'hype', 'Ledger', ""n't"", 'copy', 'Nicholson', 'campy', 'silly', 'performance', 'original', 'movie', 'completely', 'opposite', 'way', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'quite', 'unsettling', 'character', 'really', 'film', 'sad', 'watch', 'died', 'stupid', 'drug', 'overdose', 'last', 'major', 'work', 'Oldman', 'quite', 'subdued', 'excellent', 'commissioner', 'Bale', 'good', 'Batman', 'Eckhart', 'good', 'Two-Face/the', 'DA', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'dignity', 'role', 'Alfred', 'Maggie', 'Glynenthal', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'as', 'great', 'really', 'wasted', 'here', 'character', 'completely', 'superfluous.There', 'great', 'dialogue', 'also', 'lot', 'awful', 'dialogue', 'know', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'try', 'apply', 'real', 'logic', 'film', 'apart', 'never', 'see', 'Joker', 'set', 'up', 'elaborate', 'schemes', 'considering', 'completely', 'pyschopath', 'killing', 'people', 'random', 'who', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'work', 'man', 'Joker', 'schemes', 'are', 'so', 'outlandish', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'second', 'How', 'Joker', 'manage', 'convince', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'work', 'have', 'much', 'pull', 'mob', 'have', 'pull', 'probably', 'best', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'meant', 'operate', 'visceral', 'level', 'methinks', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'original', 'comic', 'books', 'perhaps', 'should', 'Maybe', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'perfunctory', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'drive', 'creativity', 'fact', ""'re"", 'rather', 'dull', 'surprisingly.The', 'film', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'bit', 'perhaps', 'two', '1/4', 'hours', 'quite', 'lot', 'boring', 'expository', 'dialogue', 'here', 'film', 'feels', 'lengthy', 'However', 'climax', 'excellent', 'surprising', 'good', 'conclusion', 'film', 'So', 'overall', 'worth', 'seeing', 'very', 'mixed', 'bag', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'especially', 'Ledger', 'excellent', 'performance']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659459,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,B00005JPY0,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[3, 8]","I know, it sounds crazy, but that's the feeling I got many times while watching this movie. It's obvious that it's a commentary on human nature, the limits of decency, the naivete of innocents, torture, real threats and real evil, and the War on Terror - but it's a commentary that favors Bush, especially the last few minutes, where the Batman willingly takes on the vilification of the masses for their own good.The movie is astounding; so many questions, so many interesting answers, as you can see from the above. Should torture - or at least the American versions of it, such as making terrorists listen to Rod Stewart - be used when lives are at stake? The movie says ""yes."" Should leaders make tough choices that are necessary but unpopular? Ditto there. Should we be yanked around by the demands of terrorists? ""No."" Should security be a top priority? ""Yes."" And on and on it goes - almost an apologia for this President.Even the strange feature of the Joker's changing ""origin stories"" brought to mind Osama Bin Laden's changing explanations for bringing about 9/11 (first, it was because of the American presence in the Middle East, then, much later, when he realized his mistake, he added that it was for the Palestinians).Ledger's performance is also astounding, as are most of the cast. Maggie Glyenhall is annoying, but that's because her character is. She will pay the price for her unrealistic idealism (or is it?). The Batman has a moment of decision which seems to all of us to be capitulation. Again, a comment on terrorism - and you know everyone in the theater is thinking, ""NO, don't give in to his demands!"" Harvey Dent is willing to push the envelope to get answers, although the Batman reveals that he had an intelligence failure. Not sure where that goes.There is a possible message about terrorists trying to bring us down to their level, and what we choose. But on the balance, we are made to understand that some people just cannot be reasoned with. They have a worldview which means our destruction, period. No matter how much we insist that they're wrong and just don't understand themselves, that deep down they're really just like us, they don't need therapy or understanding; they need to be fought.These are my impressions, and I'm sure more thoughts are percolating about this complex movie right now. But it's another amazing achievement that these messages slipped right past the usual suspects - the ring of critics that hates Bush, yet applauded this movie. Perhaps that should give us hope, that in the end we will stand united against all cults of death.UPDATE: It's not just me! Andrew Klavan also noticed it. See his interview at Uncommon Knowledge.""There seems to me no question,"" wrote novelist and screenwriter Andrew Klavan this past summer,that the Batman film 'The Dark Knight'...is at some level a paen of praise to the fortitude and moral courage shown by George W.

659465,A2Z18HU7O1JBJ7,B00005JPY0,"G. Watson ""The Unknown""","[1, 4]","The Dark Knight is by far the best movie I have seen this year. My parents did not believe me when I told them that The Dark Knight was going to be the dominating movie this year. Look where it is now. It stole the #2 spot away from Star Wars on the highest grossing film list recently. Of course, all that has to go to Heath Ledger, may he rest in peace. By the way I think he does deserve an Oscar for his Joker because he was that good. There were a lot of amazing moments in this movie and a lot of surprising moments too.I would have to say that Christopher Nolan may be the best Batman film director, but I may have to battle that thought because of Tim Burton. But their films are different from one another. Tim Burton has directed a dark Batman, but Christopher Nolan puts Tim Burton to shame with his Batman. As for Joel Schumacher, his movies are a different category: cheesy and colorful, not dark. Not the best but some Batman fans will be appeased by them. Heck I own all 5 films so far (not including The Dark Knight, which I do plan to own when it comes out).In closing I hope that if Christopher Nolan does make another Batman, I hope that it's as good as his two previous films. It may not make as much money as The Dark Knight, but then again. They're thinking of putting The Riddler and The Penguin in there now? Surprising, but interesting. Anyway in the end my parents think that Iron Man was better than The Dark Knight. They thought that The Dark Knight was just a little too dark. I think they're both nuts.

659467,A2D0PI4CACTE7I,B00005JPY0,"happydogpotatohead ""happydogpotatohead""","[10, 28]","Unpleasant, dark (as in, poor lighting!), and needlessly violent, this is not at all the definitive Batman film that many fanboys would like to make it out to be, and in fact is one of the worst screen versions of the Batman since George Clooney donned the cowl.Bale, as Batman, is a failure. As Bruce Wayne he hardly seems authoritative, or, indeed, very interesting. His ""Batman voice"" just sounds as if he just had some sort of throat operation. Bale has always been a stiff, inexpressive actor, and he is never more so than here. His Batman is so unhuman that it makes you wonder why Gordon trusts him at all; the viewer certainly doesn't. This Batman's outbursts of hyperviolent, uncontrollable rage - a trait completely counter to the original comic book version of Batman - are the final touch in making this Batman, and Bale, very dislikable.The flatness that Bale brings to the screen makes Heath Ledger's Joker that much more of a contrast. Ledger's Joker is not an Oscar-worthy performance. To be blunt, he's chewing the scenery at a level that would have been hilarious if it were not for the fact that he died shortly after making the movie. Ledger's performance is not one for the ages, as too many claim. It is easy - far too easy - to play a psychotic, over-the-top villain. It takes little acting skill. The hype that has surrounded Ledger's performance here has to do with his death, not his skillfulness in the role.In all truth, his performance is no better or worse than Jack Nicholson's in the Tim Burton Batman. Yes, Ledger brings a collection of tics, glares, twitches, and cackles to the part that are somewhat entertaining - but that can't be counted as acting. The hype that Ledger explored his ""dark side"" for this role is just so much urban legend tripe. He's overacting, in a movie that was written for him to overact in. The Joker gets all the obvious water-cooler-quote/internet-worthy lines. The combination of Ledger's overacting and the obviousness of the script becomes tiresome.Maggie Gyllenhaal seems lost in this mess. She seems the only real human in a movie full of phony, hyperextended male egos. The less said about Aaron Eckhart's completely predictable Harvey Dent/Two-Face, the better. He provides a third, completely unnecessary, hyper-egotistical psycho for the script, and as such serves as a fifth or even a sixth wheel, slowing the script and providing unnecessary complications and false drama.The action scenes are, as usual these days, too loud, too long, too violent, and too hard to see. Everything is always too dark.To sum up, this is an unpleasant movie that panders to its fanboy audience and makes up for its severe shortcomings through bluster, volume, and just plain ugliness. It's unworthy of the Batman legacy. And it is unworthy to be counted among the best superhero movies. In spite of all the hype, The Dark Knight does not hold a candle to the Marvel superhero movies - Spiderman and Iron Man outdo it in almost every way. In spite of the fact that few people will agree with me, I would not be able to recommend this movie to anyone. Overhyped, underacted, and badly written, it's a mess.",2,Low point,1269475200,"03 25, 2010",2010,3159,"['Unpleasant', 'dark', 'poor', 'lighting', 'needlessly', 'violent', 'not', 'definitive', 'Batman', 'film', 'many', 'fanboys', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'fact', 'one', 'worst', 'screen', 'versions', 'Batman', 'George', 'Clooney', 'donned', 'cowl.Bale', 'Batman', 'failure', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'hardly', 'authoritative', 'indeed', 'very', 'interesting', 'Batman', 'voice', 'just', 'just', 'had', 'sort', 'throat', 'operation', 'Bale', 'always', 'been', 'stiff', 'inexpressive', 'actor', 'never', 'more', 'so', 'here', 'Batman', 'so', 'unhuman', 'wonder', 'why', 'Gordon', 'viewer', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Batman', 'outbursts', 'hyperviolent', 'uncontrollable', 'rage', 'trait', 'completely', 'counter', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'version', 'Batman', 'are', 'final', 'touch', 'making', 'Batman', 'Bale', 'very', 'dislikable.The', 'flatness', 'Bale', 'screen', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'much', 'more', 'contrast', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'not', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'be', 'blunt', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'level', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'died', 'shortly', 'making', 'movie', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'not', 'one', 'ages', 'too', 'many', 'claim', 'easy', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'play', 'psychotic', 'over-the-top', 'villain', 'little', 'acting', 'skill', 'hype', 'surrounded', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'here', 'do', 'death', 'not', 'skillfulness', 'role.In', 'truth', 'performance', 'better', 'worse', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman', 'Yes', 'Ledger', 'collection', 'tics', 'glares', 'twitches', 'cackles', 'part', 'are', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'counted', 'acting', 'hype', 'Ledger', 'explored', 'dark', 'side', 'role', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'urban', 'legend', 'tripe', 'overacting', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'overact', 'Joker', 'obvious', 'water-cooler-quote/internet-worthy', 'lines', 'combination', 'Ledger', 'overacting', 'obviousness', 'script', 'tiresome.Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'lost', 'mess', 'only', 'real', 'human', 'movie', 'full', 'phony', 'hyperextended', 'male', 'egos', 'less', 'said', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'completely', 'predictable', 'Harvey', 'Dent/Two-Face', 'better', 'third', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'hyper-egotistical', 'psycho', 'script', 'such', 'serves', 'fifth', 'even', 'sixth', 'wheel', 'slowing', 'script', 'providing', 'unnecessary', 'complications', 'false', 'drama.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'usual', 'days', 'too', 'loud', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'violent', 'too', 'hard', 'see', 'Everything', 'always', 'too', 'dark.To', 'sum', 'up', 'unpleasant', 'movie', 'fanboy', 'audience', 'up', 'severe', 'shortcomings', 'bluster', 'volume', 'just', 'plain', 'ugliness', 'unworthy', 'Batman', 'legacy', 'unworthy', 'be', 'counted', 'best', 'superhero', 'movies', 'spite', 'hype', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'movies', 'Spiderman', 'Iron', 'Man', 'almost', 'way', 'spite', 'fact', 'few', 'people', 'will', 'agree', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'Overhyped', 'underacted', 'badly', 'written', 'mess']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659471,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JPY0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 3]","Once in a while, brother. Every once in a while, a movie lives up to the hype and the buzz. THE DARK KNIGHT not only is a near-perfect superhero film but it also happens to be one of the best crime dramas I've ever seen. I hear people are comparing it to HEAT and even to THE GODFATHER II (which, okay, might be reaching). Irregardless, it's already a modern classic.The Batman has at last established himself as Gotham City's dark protector. His intimidating influence and reputation are such that, nowadays, organized crime syndicates conduct their meetings in broad daylight. A triumvirate of the Batman, honest copper Jim Gordon and crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent has managed to put away a sizable chunk of Gotham's criminal element. Hope dawns on the horizon.Then the Joker makes big noise and abruptly shatters the status quo. The film opens with the Joker masterminding a daring daytime bank robbery, which is only the opening salvo in his plan to unleash total chaos on Gotham City. Contracted by the mob to eliminate the Dark Knight, he broadcasts an ultimatum: remove the mask, Batman, and turn yourself in or people will begin dying. When he doesn't, they do.Bruce's lifelong friend and former flame Rachel Dawes remains the Batman's incremental personal ray of hope; the dream of being with her, once Gotham is redeemed, is in part what keeps him going in his unrelenting war against crime. But Rachel has moved on and is seeing Gotham's golden boy, Harvey Dent. Very crucial to the plot is the charismatic Dent, and his operatic fall from grace. Maggie Gyllenhaal,  replacing Katie Holmes, and Aaron Echkart are good, in a cast of luminaries.THE DARK KNIGHT, despite its superhero trappings, is serious cinema. It has your geek-out moments, delivering its share of charged action sequences and Easter eggs for those comic book fans who know what to look for (one thug's attempt to take off Batman's mask, for example, is right out of the Hush story arc). But its flawless craftsmanship renders it the most grown up superhero movie yet. The complex screenplay, deftly written by Director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, touches on very dark themes and calls into question what it means to be Gotham's guardian. And, with the Joker's entrance, the audience is rapidly thrown off its comfort zone. Although marked by the absence of gore and bloodletting, there is startling violence and unremitting tension.Christian Bale reprises his understated role as Bruce Wayne and Batman, but he is almost, almost, reduced to secondary relevance, behind the Joker. If you take out all the hubbub surrounding Heath Ledger's passing, what's left is still one of the most glittering performances ever accomplished by a film actor. Ledger sinks utterly into his role; all we see is the creepiness, the unpredictabilty, and the vicious intelligence of the homicidal clown. Alfred, in a conversation with Bruce Wayne, perhaps best sums up the Joker's defining characteristic: ""Some men aren't looking for anything logical. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn."" Hands down - with mad respect to Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and even Mark Hamill - this is the best interpretation of the Joker yet. Should Ledger be nominated for an Oscar? Absolutely! The Golden Globes has already put him on the ballot.This is not to devalue the performances of the rest of the cast, because each actor here is pitch perfect. But consider Heath Ledger as the first amongst the peerless. Gary Oldman is superb, and I'm so glad that, this time, Jim Gordon isn't relegated to afterthought status, and Michael Caine and my dude Morgan Freeman are, as ever, class acts.But I can't stop talking about the Joker. Heath Ledger's take is that the Joker isn't a common criminal as much as an anarchist, and a deranged anarchist, at that. The Joker doesn't care about ill-gotten gains; he cares about tearing down Gotham's governing infrastructure. And he dearly longs to obliterate the values of man, to deconstruct the way man looks at himself. His two main targets are Harvey Dent and the Batman, and he tries his mightiest to mold them into his personal philosophy: ""You either die a hero. Or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" It's fascinating how he constructs twisted scenarios and pits his victims against impossible choices. As his psychological games escalate to more horrifying stakes, the question becomes: to what depths will the Batman, Dent, Gotham's Finest, and the citizens of Gotham steep to, to survive? And, in light of what the Batman ends up doing, it's rather hard to deny that he's as much a very disturbed vigilante as he is a caped crusader. Irregardless, the Dark Knight ends up tarnished.I like that we never do learn the Joker's backstory. All we're left with is a handful of stories, as spun by the Joker himself, about the origin of his ghastly scars. None of these stories match. It's better that way. The Joker is unpredictable and unreadable. Like chaos. And if the Joker symbolizes evil and chaos, my thinking is that the Batman in turn doesn't necessarily represent the good in man but, rather, that tiny sliver of hope (and good) in man. Did that make sense?THE DARK KNIGHT is endowed with great one-liners (mostly from the Joker) and several perfect scenes, from the bank heist sequence at the start of the film to the Joker's crazy whimsical exit from the hospital to the Joker's verbal manifesto delivered whilst hanging upside down. The pencil vanishing trick is terrific, not only for its shock value but for the charge it sends up the audience's spine. After seeing that, I no longer had doubts that this Joker would be something awesome.The film is near-perfect. Near-perfect because there are some things which bugged me. As I put on my nitpicking hat, I can't help but be bothered by Bale's guttural Batman voice, which seems to channel Clint Eastwood, if he were a chain smoker. I know that it takes time to rebuild the Wayne mansion and the Bat Cave (destroyed in BATMAN BEGINS), but I miss them, anyway. And, while I dig Batman's motorbike and its massive tires, I question the practicality of wearing a cape while riding this thing. The Joker is truly diabolical this time out, so diabolical that the Batman is reduced mostly to re-acting to his ploys, which is very unBatman-like. And I don't think much of his cowl/helmet, either. But, like I said, I'm nitpicking. To me, these are tiny flaws.I was expecting more from the special features. No audio commentary, no bloopers, no documentary about Heath. Disc 1 has the featured presentation. Disc 2 has these: ""Gotham Uncovered: Creation of a Scene"" focuses on two segments ""The Sound of Anarchy"" (the score and sound design, as tailored to the Joker's insanity) and ""The Evolution of the Knight"" (about the Batman costume and gadgetry and the IMAX effect); The IMAX-related sequences are presented in their original frame (includes sequences in the opening bank robbery, the Batman's aerial flight in Hong Kong, the armored car chase, Bruce's Lamborghini getting effed up, Batman and the Joker's face-off at Chicago's Prewitt building near the end, and the final scene); ""Gotham Tonight"" - 6 cleverly done (and fake) television broadcasts from Gotham Cable's Premier News Program, nicely hosted by Anthony Michael Hall and real-life (and very hot) L.A. TV news reporter Lauren Sanchez, and offering in-depth looks at and interviews with several of the main characters, as well as fleshing out the storyline even more (I got a bit of a chuckle at Jim Gordon's explanation for the Bat beacon, when asked by the press); and the galleries (poster art and production stills) and 3 DARK KNIGHT trailers.When you exit from this film, my guess is you won't be doing cartwheels or skipping to the park with mad abandon. It's simply not a feel-good movie. As THE DARK KNIGHT ends, Gotham's future is still tainted and, even though Batman defeats his villains, the values he's compromised and the things he's had to do leave one wondering if the Joker hadn't won out after all. A personal dichotomy is that while I consider THE DARK KNIGHT to be a masterpiece and while I relish and appreciate its brooding theatrics, I don't quite prefer it to the likes of SPIDER-MAN 2, SUPERMAN II and IRON MAN, which are sunny celebrations of the superhero mythos. THE DARK KNIGHT provokes, in its bleakness and ambiguity and stark exploration of madness and motivation and the meaning of heroism. And, as a comic book junkie, I'm not sure I'm mature enough to handle that.Even as I'm compelled to see it for a fourth time.",5,"A chilling Batman motion picture - somewhere, Adam West just made a

He is convincing in his role which makes up for the silly voice that is used when Christian Bale is ""Batman"".

In this sequel, Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale (Reign of Fire, Empire of The Sun, American Psycho, Batman Begins) is still fighting crime in Gotham City, taking down the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) early in the film, but running across copycats dressing like him who hurt more than help. The new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart (Thank You For Smoking) is putting criminals behind bars, mainly the mob, which is having problems of its own, in the form of the mysterious criminal known only as the Joker (Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain, A Knight's Tale, Ten Things I Hate About You), who is literally robbing the mob blind. The film works as not just a superhero movie, not just a Batman movie, but as a Crime-Drama epic in the tradition of Heat. Several solid actors provide terrific support, including Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, TV's The Dead Zone) as a sleazy tabloid reporter and Eric Roberts as crime boss Sal Maroni. Three actors return from the first Nolan Gotham City Protector project-Gary Oldman (Bram Stoker's Dracula, Air Force One) returns as Lieutenant Gordon; Oscar Winner Michael Caine (The Cider House Rules) is back as Bruce Wayne's loyal butler, Alfred and Oscar Winner Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Kiss The Girls, Along Came A Spider, The Shawshank Redemption) returns as Batman's version of ""Q"" Lucius Fox. The only character who has had a facelift is Rachel Dawes, originally played by Katie Holmes, but filled in by Maggie Gyllenhal for this film.

But I think ""The Dark Knight"" struck a chord in me. The three major reasons why:1. The Dark Knight keeps you at the edge of your seat when you watch it for the first time. There are so many surprises as the story rapidly changes scene to scene that you want to stay focused on the screen--something that'll happen when you watch many of Christopher Nolan's other movies as well.2. Heath Ledger's last performance may have been his best. The Joker is ""a psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy"" in the words of Ledger himself. Basically, he is the ultimate villain, and you will probably hate him with all your might as you watch this film.3. The soundtrack is perfect. It intensified the already suspenseful scenes, and it really helped you get into the movie if you already weren't. Listening to the soundtrack afterwards makes me nostalgic for the scenes.Of course this film doesn't have everything. We don't really know why the Joker is murdering left and right aside from his obvious psychological problems. Many of the characters are a bit ""stiff"", and people might not find them charming. However, I think the way these characters behave, and the fact that we don't know everything about them is appropriate for the mood set in the movie.",5,The Joker is the ultimate villain,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,1374,"[""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'fan', 'superhero', 'flicks', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrillers', 'saw', 'movie', 'think', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'struck', 'chord', 'three', 'major', 'reasons', 'why:1', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'edge', 'seat', 'when', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'surprises', 'story', 'rapidly', 'scene', 'scene', 'want', 'stay', 'focused', 'screen', 'something', ""'ll"", 'happen', 'when', 'watch', 'many', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'other', 'movies', 'well.2', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'last', 'performance', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'Joker', 'psychopathic', 'mass', 'murdering', 'schizophrenic', 'clown', 'zero', 'empathy', 'words', 'Ledger', 'Basically', 'ultimate', 'villain', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'might', 'watch', 'film.3', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'intensified', 'already', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'really', 'helped', 'get', 'movie', 'already', 'were', ""n't"", 'Listening', 'soundtrack', 'afterwards', 'nostalgic', 'scenes.Of', 'course', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'Joker', 'murdering', 'left', 'right', 'aside', 'obvious', 'psychological', 'problems', 'Many', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'stiff', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'charming', 'However', 'think', 'way', 'characters', 'behave', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'everything', 'appropriate', 'mood', 'set', 'movie']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Since I didn't see any of the nominees, I could not honestly say that one of the five should be withdrawn so this movie could have taken its place.  But it was worthy of a nomination.I read a movie reviewer say that the book can be closed on the Joker after such an effective performance.  This was in '89, speaking of Jack Nicholson's performance.  I bet that reviewer is eating his words after the late Heath Ledger's deserved supporting actor nod.  Actually, though, the Joker as portrayed by Nicholson and Cesar Romero (as well as the animated version voiced by Mark Hamil) focused on being the clown side, while Ledger's portrayal was more like the Joker in a card deck, an unpredictable wild card.This movie was full of effective plot twists.  Thus, I will not be dealing much with the plot because I hate spoiling surprises.The main point is this movie makes you think.  There are many quotable sound bites in this picture.  There have been other comic book movies that succeeded at being thoughtful (such as the X-Men series, especially X-3), but this sets the bar.I will say this movie deserves its PG-13 movie.  I feel this movie is inappropriate for children, and I would recommend parents see this with their teens instead of letting them go with their buddies, because this not only has graphic violence (though not R-rated, but close), but there are great discussions that a parent can have with their teenager as a result of this movie that shouldn't be missed.",5,Using Comic Book Action To Deal With Real Issues,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,1540,"['Should', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'best', 'picture', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'nominees', 'could', 'not', 'honestly', 'say', 'one', 'five', 'should', 'be', 'withdrawn', 'so', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'was', 'worthy', 'nomination.I', 'read', 'movie', 'reviewer', 'say', 'book', 'can', 'be', 'closed', 'Joker', 'such', 'effective', 'performance', 'was', ""'89"", 'speaking', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'bet', 'reviewer', 'eating', 'words', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'deserved', 'supporting', 'actor', 'nod', 'Actually', 'Joker', 'portrayed', 'Nicholson', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'as', 'well', 'animated', 'version', 'voiced', 'Mark', 'Hamil', 'focused', 'being', 'clown', 'side', 'Ledger', 'portrayal', 'was', 'more', 'Joker', 'card', 'deck', 'unpredictable', 'wild', 'card.This', 'movie', 'was', 'full', 'effective', 'plot', 'twists', 'Thus', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dealing', 'much', 'plot', 'hate', 'spoiling', 'surprises.The', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'think', 'are', 'many', 'quotable', 'sound', 'picture', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'succeeded', 'being', 'thoughtful', 'such', 'X-Men', 'series', 'especially', 'X-3', 'bar.I', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'feel', 'movie', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'would', 'recommend', 'parents', 'see', 'teens', 'instead', 'letting', 'go', 'buddies', 'not', 'only', 'graphic', 'violence', 'not', 'R-rated', 'close', 'are', 'great', 'discussions', 'parent', 'can', 'have', 'teenager', 'result', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659485,A319SKSB556033,B00005JPY0,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[5, 10]","Three and a half years after the hype, sycophantic reviews, and mass hysteria have died down I am now ready to review this film with a level-headed opinion. Is it good. Yes, quite. Is it the icon of intelligent summer movie perfect that the fanboys proclaim it to be? No, certainly not. The Dark Knight has faults, not the least of which is the unjustifiably bloated running time.With criminals in Gotham now looking over their shoulders (or should I say to the sky) for Batman, the crime-rate is gradually falling. But when anarchic, nihilistic Joker appears to stir things up between the cops and crooks the fight against crime is cranked up to the max. The Joker is out to create as much chaos as possible, not caring for himself or others. Meanwhile District Attorney Harvey Dent tackles the criminals as honestly as he can with Rachel Dawes glassy-eyed and Bruce Wayne competing for her affections. This is spread out over 153 minutes, and in long stretches you'll begin to feel every second of it.Much of this film's running time could have been trimmed and many scenes jettisoned. I know I am not alone in admitting that a sequence midway through the film involving dead bodies in an apartment and the re-building of a shattered bullet just confuses me. The sequence seems to come out of nowhere. I know Batman is supposed to be a detective but this was just nonsense. Nolan could have come up with a better method of leading Bruce Wayne to the trap with the window and sunshade. Also, there is a moment near the end when Salvatore Marone tells Commissioner Gordon that he knows where the Joker's going to be. Nothing becomes of this.You'd have to be pretty stupid not to connect the dots when it comes to the corrupt cops who sell-out Gordon at every opportunity too. Real lazy writing there. I just couldn't get involved with Harvey Dent either. His story, struggle, and motivations did not interest me in the slightest and I found the character flat and boring. Gary Oldman as Gordon also bored me to tears. What exactly are we supposed to like about this character? With the exception of temporally faking his own death he never once proved himself to be competent. I longed for the Joker to show up and put them all out of my misery. Not much of the dialogue is memorable. It sounds as if the characters are talking out to the audience while none of the words actually gel and no eye-lines connect. Little of it feels like a realistic conversation. It's virtually all just perfectly rehearsed movie dialogue from over-written comic-book characters.I wish that Nolan would stop shying away from violence. When you watch the movie closely you'll notice you never actually see anything. The pencil trick happens fast (and off-screen), no blood effects follow gunfire, few of the punches are seen connecting. I understand the need to keep it a PG-13 but come on! Aside from a car and helicopter explosion there aren't many deaths seen occurring onscreen, most of the time leaving you wondering what happened (as with Gambol's death).There are entertaining and breathtaking spectacles within The Dark Knight, but take away Bruce Wayne and the Joker and you're left with nothing at all that could identify this story or setting as something that truly belongs in the Batman universe.Like Batman Begins, it's all so straight and brick-faced.

This time Batman and his allies Police Commissioner James Gordon and Gotham City's District Attorney Harvey Dent are up against the Mob and are trying to shut them down for good, so that Gotham City can finally be free of their criminal menace. But the stakes are raised when the Mob teams up with criminal mastermind and psychotic villain The Joker, who is irritated by the fact that Batman hides behind a mask and so no one knows his true identity, and so threatens on TV to start killing high ranking Gotham City officials if Batman doesn't reveal who he is. And thus the madness begins, as The Joker attempts to turn Gotham City into a lawless hell on earth where chaos rules and no one is safe. Underpinning this film is the ever-present truth that Batman is not seen as a hero by the denizens of Gotham City but rather as an out of control vigilante who thinks he is above the law. Batman knows that this is how he is perceived, and makes it clear to D.A. Harvey Dent that Dent is the real hero that the people of Gotham City look up to, and so he must never fall and become a villain, no matter the temptation, or all will be lost. But The Joker wants the D.A. to fall and give in to darkness, to prove his theory that deep down everyone is evil, that there is no real good in anyone, and to kill off all hope in Gotham City that there can be an end to crime and lawlessness, that a better day can one day dawn. And the terrible things he does to Dent mean that he might succeed in his goals, and not even Batman might be able to save the day. A very dark and brooding vision from director Christopher Nolan, with exceptional performances from Heath Ledger as The Joker, Christian Bale as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent and Gary Oldman as Police Commissioner James Gordon. There are also good supporting performances from Maggie Gyllenhaal as Gotham City's assistant District Attorney Rachel Dawes (played by Katie Holmes in the first film) who is in love with both Bruce Wayne and D.A. Harvey Dent, Morgan Freeman as CEO of Wayne Enterprises Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth. The film expertly contrasts the madness of The Joker with the grim righteousness of our misunderstood anti-hero Batman and is almost unbearably tense at times, as Heath Ledger's Joker rains death, destruction and anguish all around because he loves anarchy and wants to see the world burn, and Batman seems almost powerless to stop him. Batman and the other heroes in this film struggle with their moral codes and indeed Batman is taunted by The Joker with regard to the fact that he has a moral code, whereas the Joker doesn't have one and so is free to do whatever he wants. All in all this film is an exceptional vision that has a few, minor flaws, but these do not detract from the fact that this is film-making of the highest order.

It's clear that participants are not fans of the comic books, and more than likely have not even read a single issue. This shines through the entire two and half hour film. The Dark Knight is just another mob movie, but with Batman characters in it. It is not a Batman film. All the characters could be switched out with other fictional mobsters, cops, and insaine killers. This does allow the film by itself to be an alright film, but to declare it as part of the world of Batman; it is a complete flop. Gadgets, actual Batman vehicle, and the cave is omitted. Batman does not act like the character from the graphic novels, and does not move like him when faced by criminals. Two Face is so wittlessly created and his representation by the actor and by the film itself is so poor. The director should have at least had the camera focus solely on the coin being flipped in the air and then landing on Two Face's hand. Heath Ledger does a good job at representing the Joker written for this film; but it is not the Joker readers of Batman have come to love and be intrigued by from the graphic novel. Joker is portrayed as a scary insaine killer with some light humor, not at all a mix of a crazed humorous clown with the willingness to brutally take a life. The problem with this film is like most of other comic book films, live action looks amazing if done correctly but it is so restrictive in bringing a graphic novel's world to life. The closest motion pictures to do so acurately have been animations for cartoons can do what humans and objects can't do in the ordinary world.

659493,A21XG7UVD2ABKS,B00005JPY0,Jack R. Tallent,"[4, 6]","This should be the last Superhero film that is ever made. There is no way to follow ""The Dark Knight"".I was originally a critic of the choice of Heath Ledger as the Joker, but I come out of this film an admirer. His performance in this movie is truly disturbing--giving no sense that there is a human being (much less an actor) behind that makeup.The word ""dark"" is thrown around a lot nowadays to describe movies. They called the first Batman movie ""dark"", because Tim Burton directed it. But it was only dark compared to the television show. What ""Dark Knight"" is, is ""brutal""-- a cross between ""Saw"" and an Ayn Rand novel.It is also a great action film. Much of the fighting is bone-crushing, hand-to-hand combat, perfectly in keeping with the tone of the film.One of the greatest things about ""Dark Knight"", though, is that, despite its ""darkness"", it  resists the easy path of being merely a nihilistic freak show. It pays tribute to heroism and asserts a core goodness within humanity that makes this film, ultimately, uplifting.The character of Batman has long appealed to many as an ""anti-hero"", a force against evil who is only arguably better than the evil he fights. I believe that, in the ""Dark Knight"", Batman is finally portrayed as a TRUE hero, dropping, finally, the ""anti."" He is, literally, a Knight. (The Joker, of all people, is able to discern this about Batman when he correctly identifies him as being ""incorruptible."")This is really what the film is all about, I think. Deep down, people want TRUE heroes, worshiping anti-heroes only because they are afraid to believe in the real thing.What is a Knight, but a hero you can really believe in?",5,Batman's Ascent from Anti-Hero to Knight,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,1666,"['should', 'be', 'last', 'Superhero', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'way', 'follow', 'Dark', 'Knight', '.I', 'was', 'originally', 'critic', 'choice', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'come', 'film', 'admirer', 'performance', 'movie', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'giving', 'sense', 'human', 'being', 'much', 'less', 'actor', 'makeup.The', 'word', 'dark', 'thrown', 'lot', 'describe', 'movies', 'called', 'first', 'Batman', 'movie', 'dark', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'directed', 'was', 'only', 'dark', 'compared', 'television', 'show', 'What', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'brutal', 'cross', 'Saw', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'novel.It', 'also', 'great', 'action', 'film', 'Much', 'fighting', 'bone-crushing', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'perfectly', 'keeping', 'tone', 'film.One', 'greatest', 'things', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'darkness', 'easy', 'path', 'being', 'merely', 'nihilistic', 'freak', 'show', 'tribute', 'heroism', 'core', 'goodness', 'humanity', 'film', 'ultimately', 'uplifting.The', 'character', 'Batman', 'long', 'appealed', 'many', 'anti-hero', 'force', 'evil', 'who', 'only', 'arguably', 'better', 'evil', 'believe', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Batman', 'finally', 'portrayed', 'TRUE', 'hero', 'dropping', 'finally', 'anti', 'literally', 'Knight', 'Joker', 'people', 'able', 'discern', 'Batman', 'when', 'correctly', 'being', 'incorruptible', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'think', 'Deep', 'down', 'people', 'want', 'TRUE', 'heroes', 'worshiping', 'anti-heroes', 'only', 'are', 'afraid', 'believe', 'real', 'thing.What', 'Knight', 'hero', 'can', 'really', 'believe']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659495,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JPY0,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 7]","Finally the new generation of Batman films has arrived and he is on the run. The film is long and there are many moments when no action happens, when the hero or the people are there to reflect upon events, to go down deep into themselves, to show us their feelings, their fears, their hopes. The film becomes a lot more psychological, mental even. It is talking of people, real people and how they react and live in a tense situation. The best moment of the film is when the people themselves have to decide who is going to die, them on one side or the others on the other side. They can do it on both sides and neither sides do it. They vote overwhelmingly for killing the others and yet they don't carry out their decision. Democracy is the worst imaginable regime because a majority is always found for the least ethical decisions that more or less demagogically please the masses, caress them in the right direction. And yet it remains the best because in these worst situations imaginable the people kind of react against the horror and the terror and do not follow the majority rule or reveal another layer of majority rule deeper and finer, well hidden but always ready to come out. The film shows how what is at stake is not what the masses are going to do in a crisis situation. It is what are the few individuals who have power and the means to use that power going to do, or rather become? And there the answer is super-negative. Individuals are always corrupted by the forces behind the terror that swoops down onto the masses. That's politics and that's well seen. And yet that's false when the film pretends these few corruptible people can be stopped. At least not the way the film says. They are never corrupted alone and they move into that corrupted state along with quite many people, armed forces, security forces and even more. The film is deeply reflecting on recent events but the diagnosis is wrong and the solution is wrong too. It will not be enough to get rid of the corrupted individual. It will not even be enough to get rid of him and the inner circle of his legion. You will have to explain why at a certain moment that man captured a vast majority of the people in elections or just public opinion. And you'll have to provide a way to reverse that fact and to prevent it from happening again. And then you will find you cannot prevent that because such massive support to evil when it is draped in a long shining armor of good is long lasting, very long lasting. The next solution is to turn that corrupted person into a dead hero. But then you have to turn your best friend into the fiend the masses require. Think of president Saakashvili in Georgia. He took the decision to send troops into Ossetia. That was a bad decision showing how he had been corrupted by his re-election and the anti-Russian feelings of some. You can even say he had been influenced if not directly manipulated by the Russians, or even by the West which more or less promised support, even military, another manipulation of course. His mind got corrupted and he provoked the big northern neighbor and he got what he deserved: his two military bases destroyed, the main airport destroyed, the main harbor destroyed, the basic infrastructures disrupted, the pipelines stopped. A military, economic, social and political catastrophe. Then what? Oust him and turn him into a hero? Follow the call of the hard liners among the people and start a guerrilla warfare adventure, provided the Russians decided to stay in Georgia? Send Bush to burry him deep and under a thick layer of concrete? Punish the Russians with isolation, as if they gave a damn about it because we, in the West, need their natural gas and their oil, not the reverse. This film is thus discussing this fundamental issue of what do we do with corrupted leaders who have commanded at some time in their careers vast support from the masses? The solution proposed is unrealistic. But the film is superb, especially because the Joker is really vicious and dangerous, really blood curdling and sickening, whereas with Jack Nicholson he was a funny clown. This time he is not a clown at all. And that is true: terrorism, even criminal terrorism and not political terrorism, is not funny, is not a game, is not a show. And it has means to get under the skin of most people. And then there is no solution, except an innocent fiend who will be on the run forever, like Ben Laden? We can wonder if our enemies, fiends are not such illusive evil beings who are not that evil but are necessary for the real evil ones to be kept in place. And are there even really alive, are they really real?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Evil

It will not change the world and it will not change your life. It may, however, change your perspective of the world and of human nature. And that is more than what you can say about most films.This movie isn't that violent and deserves its PG-13 and not R rating. Its action sequences, although good, are nothing special by today's standards.  Nevertheless, I was disappointed with the fight sequences. As a martial arts practitioner, I felt many of the previous Batman movies, such as the Batman Begins, had far better fighting sequences and more elaborate choreography.This movie deserves its all time best ranking as a superhero film along with the Superman (1977) and Spiderman 2 (2004). Just don't expect it to blow you away unles you are less than 16 years old.Finally, I do not understand all the adulation of Heath Ledger. My guess is he is lionized because of his role in Brokeback Mountain. But I think we need to see him as he was.

The story takes the characters in directions that show an extraordinary level of directorial skill that frankly makes Tim Burton's previous films almost amateur by comparison. The opening sequence is one of the most engaging first 10 minutes of a movie I think I've ever seen, quickly establishing The Joker as a formidable villain. The rest of film is both equally complex and completely gripping as the stakes are continuously raised.The most amazing part of the movie is Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. I've rarely been terrified by fictional villains but Ledger makes his character grotesque and perfectly in control as a master strategist. There are genuinely points in the film where his goals are so far ahead of the good guys that he seems completely invincible. And in creating his Joker, he's made it a character than nobody else is ever going to be able to live up to - truly the hallmark of an extraordinary actor.The Dark Knight is as complicated, entertaining, thought-provoking and well-formed as cinema gets. Once a decade, a director produces a film that transcends the limits of the screen and creates something truly iconic. It's a testament to Nolan's skill that he can add such depth to the material and deliver something so finely balanced that it's impossible to think of how it could be better.",5,"A cinematic masterpiece that combines depth, intelligence and masterful storytelling",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1489,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'several', 'times', 'original', 'release', 'movie', 'stronger', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'much', 'many', 'other', 'film', 'classics', 'story', 'characters', 'directions', 'show', 'extraordinary', 'level', 'directorial', 'skill', 'frankly', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'previous', 'films', 'almost', 'amateur', 'comparison', 'opening', 'sequence', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'quickly', 'establishing', 'Joker', 'formidable', 'villain', 'rest', 'film', 'equally', 'complex', 'completely', 'gripping', 'stakes', 'are', 'continuously', 'raised.The', 'most', 'amazing', 'part', 'movie', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Joker', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'been', 'terrified', 'fictional', 'villains', 'Ledger', 'character', 'grotesque', 'perfectly', 'control', 'master', 'strategist', 'are', 'genuinely', 'points', 'film', 'where', 'goals', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'good', 'guys', 'completely', 'invincible', 'creating', 'Joker', 'made', 'character', 'nobody', 'else', 'ever', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'up', 'truly', 'hallmark', 'extraordinary', 'actor.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'as', 'complicated', 'entertaining', 'thought-provoking', 'well-formed', 'cinema', 'decade', 'director', 'film', 'limits', 'screen', 'something', 'truly', 'iconic', 'testament', 'Nolan', 'skill', 'can', 'add', 'such', 'depth', 'material', 'deliver', 'something', 'so', 'finely', 'balanced', 'impossible', 'think', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'better']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659503,AMN010NPLJW4X,B00005JPY0,Jamison,"[1, 1]","MOVIE. The best cinematic adaptation of a comic book story.  It is also one of the best sequels ever made, right up there with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  Sections are inspired by quality elements of genre greats like HEAT and the James Bond series.  Rare in-camera visual effects work.  The first BATMAN film, with Nicholson's Joker, doesn't have anything on this version.  Stunning.VIDEO. Filmed partly in 70mm Imax and 35mm, this is a tour de force in crime genre filmmaking, and the best filmed superhero movie ever.  The 35 scenes don't look as good as the 70 scenes, but it's a surprisingly subtle shift.  Altogether the filming is comparable to Kubrick's photographic innovations.  Fully utilizes the capabilities of Blu-ray in transferring what is likely the greatest technical achievement in filmmaking in recent years.AUDIO.  The fact that the score is by TWO of the best film soundtrack composers working today seems under-appreciated or overlooked in the reviews I've read.  This unique collaboration between Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is reason enough to own the BD.  Some have complained that Batman's voice doesn't sound right, which is incorrect.  Batman uses a voice synthesizer to change his voice to be menacing and untraceable.  There is plenty of LFE and while the soundstage could have used some more kick and surround in some parts, it was overall very good.  It's unfortunate that the BD defaults to ""Dolby Multi"" 5.1 rather than the superior TrueHD audio track.EXTRAS.  Amazingly there are no audio commentary tracks.  The ""focus point"" shorts on disc one are the best extras, demonstrating how some of the incredible pieces of this film came together.  The special features disc is pretty fluffy, though parts of the HD documentaries were enjoyable.  The Gotham news scenes dragged on but there are a couple highlights, like Bruce Wayne's comments whilst eating sushi.  The design of the case and sleeve deserve mention as they are the most creative I've seen on any BD or DVD.  The slipcase looks normal while the case underneath features the joker on front and his graffiti on the back, defacing what was presented normally on the sleeve.OVERALL.  It's a fun movie to watch.

They are the modern day equivalent of epic poems and campfire tales, illustrating the moral dilemmas of fighting evil with evil and contemplating whether the world still needs heroes at all.Clocking in at just over two-and-a-half hours, the theatrical cut is slightly weighed down by several brooding speeches. However, the Joker's relentless assault never lets you rest. Make no mistake, The Dark Knight is an action film. However, the film also delivers as a thought-provoking tragedy and, in doing so, sets itself apart from every superhero film that came before it.P.S. Parents need to use caution. The PG-13 rating hardly reflects the film's violence and sadism. I couldn't recall another PG-13 film that had as much implied violence even though much occurs off screen. Teenagers can handle the dark crime story but this superhero film is not suitable for young children.As the parent of two sons, a 6-year-old and a 4-year old, I turn to these other, more age-appropriate Batman DVDs for my die-hard superhero fans:Batman - The Animated SeriesandThe Batman.

Though I didn't find the imagery of this movie as drab overall as say in the first movie, the story line certainly does set the mood.Once again, outstanding performance by the leads in this movie.  I can't imagine why anyone other than Christian Bale has ever played Batman.And, yes, Heath Ledger was eerily fantastic.I can't add too much in the way of original thought here as I've been too overexposed to other opinions, but the following is my two-cents worth.While I overall enjoyed the movie, I walked away with these thoughts (hence the 4-star rating which averaged between 3- and 5-star elements of the movie):Pros:1) Christian Bale.  Great actor and easy on the eyes.2) Cool gadgets.3) Crazy stunts.4) Gross but cool magic scene involving pencil.Cons:1) I was ready to leave when we first see Two-face (thought it was a set up for the next movie...wrong) --2.5hr movie felt like 5 hours and 3 movies rolled into one.  I felt the same way about Spiderman 3.  What is with comic film producers that they want to cram as much in as possible?2)Get off the soap box--There must have been a min. number of monologues provision for the actors.  I was growing weary of hearing the tedious (and often cliched) explanations for insanity and doing what's right and doing what one thinks is right though is insane to others.  I didn't need the Joker talking so overtly about chaos and all that.  His character demonstrates it just fine.  And if the audience was paying attention then they caught the two different stories of how he got his scars...a classic tell-tale sign of a compulsive liar and sociopath.Overall an entertaining flick, but doesn't hold up to its predecessor which, IMHO, is hands down the best of all the Batman films thus far.",4,Just When I Didn't Think It Could Get Darker,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,1830,"['newest', 'installment', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'good', 'promises', ""'darkness"", 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'imagery', 'movie', 'drab', 'overall', 'say', 'first', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'certainly', 'set', 'mood.Once', 'again', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'leads', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'anyone', 'other', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'ever', 'played', 'Batman.And', 'yes', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'was', 'eerily', 'fantastic.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'original', 'thought', 'here', ""'ve"", 'been', 'too', 'overexposed', 'other', 'opinions', 'following', 'two-cents', 'worth.While', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'walked', 'away', 'thoughts', 'hence', '4-star', 'rating', 'averaged', '3-', '5-star', 'elements', 'movie', 'Pros:1', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Great', 'actor', 'easy', 'eyes.2', 'Cool', 'gadgets.3', 'Crazy', 'stunts.4', 'Gross', 'cool', 'magic', 'scene', 'involving', 'pencil.Cons:1', 'was', 'ready', 'leave', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'Two-face', 'thought', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'next', 'movie', 'wrong', '2.5hr', 'movie', 'felt', '5', 'hours', '3', 'movies', 'rolled', 'one', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'Spiderman', '3', 'What', 'comic', 'film', 'producers', 'want', 'cram', 'as', 'much', 'possible', '2', 'Get', 'off', 'soap', 'box', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'min', 'number', 'monologues', 'provision', 'actors', 'was', 'growing', 'weary', 'hearing', 'tedious', 'often', 'cliched', 'explanations', 'insanity', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'doing', 'what', 'one', 'right', 'though', 'insane', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'Joker', 'talking', 'so', 'overtly', 'chaos', 'character', 'just', 'fine', 'audience', 'was', 'paying', 'attention', 'then', 'caught', 'two', 'different', 'stories', 'how', 'got', 'scars', 'classic', 'tell-tale', 'sign', 'compulsive', 'liar', 'sociopath.Overall', 'entertaining', 'flick', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'predecessor', 'IMHO', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'Batman', 'films', 'thus', 'far']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659511,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B00005JPY0,Jason Bean,"[5, 7]","I was one of the VERY few people who came out of the movie theaters disappointed when 'The Dark Knight' released in 2008. I realise any film that's hyped this much is going to disappoint, but even movie critics were calling 'The Dark Knight' one of the best films ever made. Now I've bought the film on Amazon demand and watched it a second time, because lets face it if so many people are still praising it I feel like I must've missed something.I think a lot of the hype of this film came from Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. On second viewing I will say his performance is even more impressive. It's still amazing catching all his little gestures quirks that shows really how talented Heath Ledger was. In fact the acting (and casting) in this film is quite good. Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart really bring weight to their characters and along with Ledger their performances stick with you long after the film is done.For me the biggest draw-back of this film was it's screenplay. The overall plot of 'The Dark Knight' is actually very well observed (especially of post 9/11 society) and very intelligent especially for a superhero film, but it's logic and characterizations fall surprisingly short. Bruce Wayne comes off as petty and unlikeable and his 'Batman' behaves more like a cranky 'Jack Bauer' who breaks a criminal's legs when he doesn't get his way (to no avail I might add). In fact nothing Batman or the police did seemed to have much logic behind it. You can say 'Hey, it's just a comic book film' but when you have these dazzling scenes of the Joker robbing a bank (which was a GREAT opening!) in linear detail to all of a sudden have a character fake their death or suddenly get kidnapped OFF-screen it seems the filmmakers were only logical when it was convenient for the story.... and I guess we're just supposed to take the rest for granted. It also didn't help that the dialogue was pretty artificial (the screenplay loves it some exposition) and the love-triangle, much like the rest of the story felt tacked-on for convenience.My disappointment wasn't just in the hype for 'The Dark Knight'. I loved 'Batman Begins'. In fact it's STILL my favorite superhero movie which I can watch over and over again. It's more thoughtful, has more class and I had a LOT more fun watching it than 'The Dark Knight'.Despite my complaints about it's story, I will say 'The Dark Knight' has some well-staged (if bafflingly edited) action scenes. The fight in a Hong Kong Skyscraper, the car-chase through the underground tunnels, and especially the final scene with Batman using the cell phone technology to save hostages and fight off both the Joker AND the police was jaw-dropping! The scenes look amazing on digital transfer. I don't know how the DVD looks but if you liked this film you WON'T be disappointed with the Blu-ray or even digital download.Sorry to rant so much. I know I'm still in the minority here. I'm not a film critic and I won't pretend I know what makes a good movie. However as a movie-goer and comic book fan I found 'The Dark Knight' unworthy of it's praise.

659512,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B00005JPY0,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[3, 4]","Batman has always been my favorite of the comic book heroes. Unlike the most Batman is human, he has no super powers unless you count his amazing self control and brilliance. In the past, this very human character has been placed in a very supernatural world surrounded by villains that seem like they don't belong, possess supernatural powers, or are too comic to believe they could be nothing more than a fly bothering an elephant. The city too gothic or colorful to be taken seriously, but this all changed with Batman Begins, a movie that showed Batman as a very human crime fighter, in a very real world.The Dark Knight takes everything up a notch, creating a brutal world, in a very realistic city. This new saga, from the creators of Batman Begins, doesn't try to be a comic book movie, but instead tries to be something greater and succeeds in spades. Don't expect the bubblegum pop of past comic book movies, this movie transplants comic book characters into a gritty crime drama that feels like it could actually happen. Forget the comic book, no one is safe and nothing's sacred here. From the opening scene this movie picks you up and won't let you down until the credits start to roll, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat from start to finish. In this world, our hero isn't past breaking legs to get the information he needs, and our villain is as scary as anything you've seen in Silence of the Lambs or Se7en.The movie opens up with a bank robbery, and you learn just what kind of person The Joker really is. (The hype is underplayed, Heath Ledger is beyond amazing as he literally disappears into the role of a lifetime. Ironic, and unfortunate, that his best performance should be his last.) Here we watch an amazingly choreographed bank robbery as The Joker's ""allies"" drop like flies. This is a man who cares about nothing, not even the money he's stealing, he's just having fun pulling one over on everyone. We also hear him utter one of the greatest lines of the whole Batman series: ""I believe in one thing: what doesn't kill you, makes you stranger."" This opening scene not only sets the tone for the rest of the movie, but is also one of the most amazing opening scenes of any action/drama movie ever.Currently, in our saga, Jim Gordon and Batman are doing their best to put an end to the mob's rule in Gotham city with a little help from the new DA Harvey Dent, the city's new White Knight. Harvey Dent is a pure man in a dirty world (once again played excellently by the always welcome Aaron Eckhart) and could also be Bruce Wayne's chance to put down the cape and cowl once and for all. Here we see Bruce as a man torn, the true antihero. I thought Christian Bale was good in Batman Begins, here he exceeds all expectation.While our trio of good tries to take down the mob, the mob turns to the man who's been robbing them blind to take care of The Bat: The Joker. It's just too bad for the mob that they had nowhere else to turn to. With the mob relying on him, and the cops and Batman going after the mob, The Joker now has free reign on the city. Here The Joker has no true agenda, at least no rational agenda, and that's something Batman can't understand because in his mind every criminal wants something. What do with someone who is absolutely insane (he tells the story of how he got his scars several times, each time telling a different story, and each time believing the story with every fiber of his being) and so hellbent on destruction and anarchy? Maybe you have to use the criminals methods to fight them. (You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.)This movie takes on some very weighty and deep issues, but never loses steam. It might be two and half hours, but it flies by. It's one of the most entertaining movies in the multiplex right now, and I would recommend you see it in the theater, some things will lose their visual luster on the small screen (a night time fly around the skyscrapers of Hong Kong comes to mind).

Of all the Batman films I've seen, ""The Dark Knight"" is the most violent and the most depressing.  The Joker represents everything that is wrong with humanity.  He is vile, amoral, sadistic and cruel; he shows no mercy as he dispatches friend and foe alike.""The Dark Knight"" is extremely entertaining . . . for adults.  It is non-stop violence from beginning to end.  There are intense scenes involving the taking of hostages, and their subsequent tortures and deaths.  There are numerous terrorist acts where buildings explode.  Major characters betray, deceive, and seek bloody vengeance.  ""The Dark Knight"" is not a movie for children.  It should have been rated ""R.""  Otherwise, the violence should have been toned down in order to give it a ""PG-13"" rating.The original Batman movies, starring Michael Keaton as Batman and directed by Tim Burton, were geared more for children.  They had a gothic feel and appearance that distinguished the mythical Gotham City from New York, Las Angeles, and other big cities of the real world.  I missed the gothic elements.  ""The Dark Knight"" reminded me of action movies such as the ones found in the ""Die Hard"" series.  Gone was the comic book adventure found in ""Fantastic Four"" and ""The Incredible Hulk.""If you enjoy violent action thrillers, then you must see ""The Dark Knight.""  The Joker is a diabolical street thug with a witty, dark sense of humor.  We never learn his true identity, which adds a delightful sense of mystery to the film.  Who is he and what does he want?  He tells different versions of how he obtained his scars.  He is an insane, pathological liar.  I hope to see him in another sequel.

659516,A2CB0DNKYCIQE8,B00005JPY0,J. C. Amos,"[3, 7]","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  Probably not much, but I'll say it all anyways.  This is a fantastic movie.  There are lots of movies that top box office records and get tons of hype and media attention; they come and they go, I buy them on DVD and eventually they just blend into my collection to be watched only occasionally.  This is not one of those movies.  This, among only a handful of others that I can think of, I can watch and then a day or two later, I already get the craving to watch it again.  It just may be my favorite movie of all time.Where do I begin my justification for this opinion?  I'll start with the plot:  it's complex, it's concise and it's amazing.  The movie feels almost more like a crime drama than it does a super hero flick, and it's much more entertaining as a crime drama than most crime dramas I've seen.  The fact that the main protagonist wears a bat costume is what reminds you that you're watching a Batman movie.  Batman and his allies (mainly Harvey Dent and Gordon) are just trying to take down the mob.  And I think this reason is why I was so quickly engrossed by the movie.  I don't really have to suspend much belief to be wrapped up in it.  Batman Begins has a great plot as well, but Ra's Al Ghul's goal was pretty ridiculous and in the end, it still felt like a Batman movie, even if it was the best until now.The acting here is terrific.  I wasn't too fond of Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance here; her take on the Rachel character wasn't too believable to me, even though I do like her as an actress.  And Christian Bale himself, one of my favorite actors, didn't really get a whole lot of screen time as Bruce Wayne, but that's due to the fact that the movie is packed with characters.  But Gary Oldman is great, even though this role is incredibly tame for his skills, Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman and can't be argued against, and Aaron Eckhart is awesome here and I'm now a fan of his.Now enter the Joker:  the film's dark and wonderfully twisted centerpiece.  Remember all of those other actors that I mentioned?  I don't either after watching Ledger play this role.  This is by far the most demented, sadistic and amazing take on The Joker that has ever been done in the Batman universe.  I applaud Nolan, Ledger and whoever else was a creative force behind this character.  The Joker is the best movie character I have ever seen and I am not exaggerating that point.  If you infused the unrelentingly merciless villain Anton Chygur from No Country for Old Men with a very disturbing sense of humor and a bit of psychotic schizophrenia, you might have an idea of what this rendition of the Joker is like.  Jack Nickelson's Joker, while iconic in his own way, doesn't even come to mind when drawing comparisons to Ledger's.  Nickelson's villain in the Departed is a closer comparison than his Joker.The way The Joker character is written into the movie is also genius.  Rather than give him a back story and explain who he is, Nolan chose to have him simply appear, explaining that The Joker doesn't need an explanation, he just arrives.  It does, in a vague way, explain his rise to power as he starts with ripping off the mob and eventually getting them in his pocket.  I love the fact that at the very beginning of the movie, The Joker is considered small time and unimportant and the main story focuses on the mob.  One scene at a time, he changes everything, working each side to his own whim.As if I haven't raved about The Joker enough, the best part about his character are his bizarre ticks and his incredible dialogue.  Almost everything he says in the movie is quotable and even stuff he doesn't say is up for imitation.  The way he messes with his tongue as he speaks (I assume Ledger worked that in as a habit the character would have developed after getting his mouth scars), the way he gives a different story every time he explains how he got his scars, the facial expressions he makes, all of these things together to make him a truly amazing character to watch (and in my case at least) become border-line obsessed with.I don't have any real problems with the movie, and although I absolutely love it, nothing is perfect.  For me, it does lose a little bit of it's momentum toward the end and that's not for lack of action.  The tone of the movie changes a little bit in the last action sequence, and that could just be because the film is reaching a conclusion and can't quite end on the same note as the rest of the movie, but it just doesn't quite feel right.  The Joker's final plot and Batman trying to stop him is just a little hokey to me, though still not nearly as campy as a traditional Batman flick.  My only other complaint, and I appologize if I'm spoiling anything here, is the resolution with Harvey Dent's character.  We all know he becomes Twoface, but I thought his transformation into that character would've been better saved for the end as a hint toward the next film, or perhaps earlier in the film so we could've seen more of him.  He is one of Batman's trademark villains, but as far as the plot is written, he's pretty much served his purpose and it sounds like he's not coming back.  To me, this is kind of dissapointing, but at least we still got to see him.There may be little purpose to this review as I'm sure 90% of its readers have already seen the film, but I felt compelled to write it anyways.  So watch The Dark Knight for the story, watch it for The Joker, or just watch it because you like Batman, but watch and enjoy this movie.  For once, there is a reason for the hype.",5,I know why you're afraid to go out at night...,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,5620,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said',

But let me start off by saying that The Dark Knight was a cinematic adventure. It was a movie in which after you watched it, you talked about it. Yes, there's Heath Ledger--and he did a phenomenal job; and yes, he died and that beefed up the box-office numbers.But, people are forgetting something. The Dark Knight had a great script, a great cast, AWE-INSPIRING CINEMATOGRAPHY, a great score; it was emotional, entertaining, thought provoking, DARK, funny, sad, scary; it felt like Michael Mann's Heat mixed with The Godfather mixed with Silence of the Lambs.TWO COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:1. Heath Ledger made the film.Response: no, Christopher Nolan made the film (no pun intended). Have you seen his track record lately?2. Heath Ledger only won an oscar because he died.Response: no, Heath Ledger won an oscar because it was one of the greatest performaces in history, period, and the Academy Awards would have been stoned to death for ignoring his performance whether dead or alive. Heck, they were almost stoned to death for not giving the film and Nolan an oscar nomination as it was.HOW COULD IT NOT BE A 5/5:Well, some people don't like to think. My Aunt didn't like the movie because it was too confusing. (This is the director of Memento, must I remind you.) People who don't like to think may not like this movie. It's as simple as that.Also . . . people might lie and just give this a bad score because The Dark Knight is considered one of the greatest films of ALL TIME. Check the IMDB top 250. Thousands and thousands of voters must share a common feelings, that TDK is a pretty fricken awesome film.BLU-RAY:Surprisingly I think the Batman Begins Blu-Ray has more features than The Dark Knight Blu-Ray, but seriously, does it matter? All that matters is that you can watch one of the greatest, most thought-provoking, most entertaining films ever.P.S.

It's nothing more than an action/car chase movie centered around a lunatic serial killer.  It's my least favorite of ALL the Batman movies.  The screenplay is a mess, the photography is mediocre, and the DVD is grainy and badly transferred.  Heath Ledger didn't deserve an Oscar for this role, he obviously won it via the sympathy vote.  He deserved the Oscar for ""Brokeback Mountain""!  I find it disturbing that the masses today make heroes out of psychopaths and find them funny or amusing.  At least Hitchcock made his movies (including ""Psycho"" and ""Frenzy"") with grace, style, intelligence and coherent scripts.  The ending of this movie is one of the worst in film history - it abruptly stopped, like they ran out of film.  It left far too much unresolved - plus it pinned the blame on the only true hero in the movie!  It shows a warped sense of morality - and a very cynical view of the world!

659521,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00005JPY0,Jean E. Pouliot,"[1, 2]","First off, Heath Ledger fully deserved his posthumous Oscar for his over-the-top performance as The Joker. He was manic, intelligent and philosophical and vicious, often simultaneously. He provided the most frightening of villains - the one motivated not by greed or power, but the sheer thrill of introducing chaos into civil society. This made him the ultimate criminal -- one thoroughly unlike the rest of us, and therefore more frightening.There were plenty of fireworks and thrills in the movie, and plenty of chases and explosions. But ""The Dark Knight"" needed to plumb the depths a little more to make it as memorable overall as Ledger. Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name addressed issues of a middle-aged hero trying to push his aging body to perform as it once had. It also pushed the moral limits of vigilantism to the breaking point. What kind of strange morality allows a hero to break bones, permanently maim and terrorize criminals to get his way, but will not let him kill? As it is Christian Bale's Batman suffers a few scratches and cuts. But never has to face the existential questions faced by the rest of us -- inevitable aging and the gradual diminution of strength and purpose.""The Dark Knight:"" would have been a more fully-realized movie had it tackled these question, but it was satisfying nonetheless. Great makeup/CGI work to provide us with a believable Two-Face.

659524,A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,B00005JPY0,"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff""","[2, 3]","Okay, other than being one of the last remaining members of the human race to finally see this unbelievably fantastic movie, against ALL odd's it actually lived up to the incredible hype that preceeded it--which almost NEVER happens (at least not to ME). Allow me to explain: When the first Batman (with Michael Keaton) was released, by the time I finally saw it-some 3 months after it came out-the advance hype was SO high that other than enjoying Jack Nicholson, I rather disliked the film...and besides, if you want ME to accept the premise of a regular guy-as-a-superhero, honestly, you MUST be taller than ME in order to get me to swallow an actor as Batman (read: Keaton--and I actually like him otherwise).The sequel was horrific. The ONLY original Batman movie I tolerated was with Val Kilmer, and let's not even get into how bad the George Clooney disaster was...fast-forward to the release of Batman Begins and I fought against going to see it because my previous experiences with this particular superhero just wasn't good. I lost the fight and (very reluctantly) agreed to see it. Wow was I surprised. Part of that certainly may be the result of having such incredibly LOW expectations that even a half-decent movie would have been pretty good. Consequently, by the time the Dark Knight came out, and the near-mythic hype that accompanied the release, well lets just say there was a LOT to live up to.I wanted to see it in the theaters--I REALLY did...however my wife is NOT a fan of superhero movies...ANY of them. So we ended up seeing just about everything BUT the Dark Knight. I kept thinking, 'I'll go see it NEXT weekend...' but that never came to be. Eventually it left the big screen and came out on DVD and gratefully my son brought it home and I finally saw it. FINALLY!! But could it possibly live up the unbelievably HUGE amount of hype that I had read and heard about for almost 9 months straight? I braced myself for the worst--and yet I still expected it to be awesome. The major praise for the film coming almost exclusively on behalf of the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, and hearing everyone speak of his performance in almost hushed, reverance and awe, saying stuff like Golden Globe and Oscar, made me even MORE skeptical. I mean, WHO thinks of roles like the Joker would EVER receive a nomination, let alone an actual win, huh? Besides, those types of roles simply aren't Academy Award material to begin with, right?WRONG. BIG time. Not only was Heath's performance jaw-droppingly good, but easily the best performance from ANY Batman film to date--including Jack Nicholsons. REALLY. And that's saying just ONE small part of this very well-made, violent thriller/drama. It almost re-wrote the book on superhero movie-making...on second thought, it DID. And the Joker is just one tiny part of what you have to love within this fantastic film. The story was clever and loaded with twists--some that were downright surprising, and some which just made me think: Oooh, that was cool.All I can say afterwards is basically this: Christopher Nolan proved me wrong--and I have never been so happy to admit it. While the Oscars recognized Ledgers performance (as they should have), Nolan amongst others have been snubbed, almost embarassingly so. The Academy is notorious for denying superhero films nominations of ANY kind (outside of special effects, costumes and whatnot), and I wonder had Heath Ledger not passed if they would have even given him a nod at all? I am glad they DID because he deserves it (not to mention he deserves to win), but I can't help but wonder...The Dark Knight was simply put the best film of 2008 and is hands down my favorite movie featuring a superhero, and has earned every single bit of the praise it received...in fact I think maybe, possibly it didn't get enough--if that's even possible.",5,A RARE sequel that literally outshines the fantastic original,1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,3863,"['Okay', 'other', 'being', 'one', 'last', 'remaining', 'members', 'human', 'race', 'finally', 'see', 'unbelievably', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'ALL', 'odd', 'actually', 'lived', 'up', 'incredible', 'hype', 'preceeded', 'almost', 'NEVER', 'least', 'not', 'ME', 'Allow', 'explain', 'When', 'first', 'Batman', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'finally', 'saw', 'it-some', '3', 'months', 'came', 'out-the', 'advance', 'hype', 'was', 'SO', 'high', 'other', 'enjoying', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'rather', 'disliked', 'film', 'besides', 'want', 'accept', 'premise', 'regular', 'guy-as-a-superhero', 'honestly', 'MUST', 'be', 'taller', 'ME', 'order', 'get', 'swallow', 'actor', 'Batman', 'read', 'Keaton', 'actually', 'otherwise', '.The', 'sequel', 'was', 'horrific', 'ONLY', 'original', 'Batman', 'movie', 'tolerated', 'was', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'let', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'how', 'bad', 'George', 'Clooney', 'disaster', 'was', 'fast-forward', 'release', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'fought', 'going', 'see', 'previous', 'experiences', 'particular', 'superhero', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'lost', 'fight', 'very', 'reluctantly', 'agreed', 'see', 'Wow', 'was', 'surprised', 'Part', 'certainly', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'having', 'such', 'incredibly', 'LOW', 'expectations', 'even', 'half-decent', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'Consequently', 'time', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'came', 'out', 'near-mythic', 'hype', 'accompanied', 'release', 'well', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'LOT', 'live', 'up', 'to.I', 'wanted', 'see', 'theaters', 'REALLY', 'did', 'however', 'wife', 'NOT', 'fan', 'superhero', 'movies', 'ANY', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'just', 'everything', 'BUT', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'kept', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'go', 'see', 'NEXT', 'weekend', 'never', 'came', 'be', 'Eventually', 'left', 'big', 'screen', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'gratefully', 'son', 'brought', 'home', 'finally', 'saw', 'could', 'possibly', 'live', 'up', 'unbelievably', 'HUGE', 'amount', 'hype', 'had', 'read', 'heard', 'almost', '9', 'months', 'straight', 'braced', 'worst', 'yet', 'still', 'expected', 'be', 'awesome', 'major', 'praise', 'film', 'coming', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'behalf', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Joker', 'hearing', 'everyone', 'speak', 'performance', 'almost', 'hushed', 'reverance', 'awe', 'saying', 'stuff', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Oscar', 'made', 'even', 'MORE', 'skeptical', 'mean', 'WHO', 'roles', 'Joker', 'would', 'EVER', 'receive', 'nomination', 'let', 'alone', 'actual', 'win', 'huh', 'Besides', 'types', 'roles', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'Academy', 'Award', 'material', 'begin', 'right', 'WRONG', 'BIG', 'time', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Heath', 'performance', 'jaw-droppingly', 'good', 'easily', 'best', 'performance', 'ANY', 'Batman', 'film', 'date', 'including', 'Jack', 'Nicholsons', 'REALLY', 'saying', 'just', 'ONE', 'small', 'part', 'very', 'well-made', 'violent', 'thriller/drama', 'almost', 're-wrote', 'book', 'superhero', 'movie-making', 'second', 'thought', 'DID', 'Joker', 'just', 'one', 'tiny', 'part', 'what', 'have', 'love', 'fantastic', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'clever', 'loaded', 'twists', 'were', 'downright', 'surprising', 'just', 'made', 'think', 'Oooh', 'was', 'cool.All', 'can', 'say', 'afterwards', 'basically', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'proved', 'wrong', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'happy', 'admit', 'Oscars', 'recognized', 'Ledgers', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'Nolan', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'snubbed', 'almost', 'embarassingly', 'so', 'Academy', 'notorious', 'denying', 'superhero', 'films', 'nominations', 'ANY', 'kind', 'special', 'effects', 'costumes', 'whatnot', 'wonder', 'had', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'not', 'passed', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'given', 'nod', 'am', 'glad', 'DID', 'not', 'mention', 'win', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'simply', 'put', 'best', 'film', '2008', 'hands', 'down', 'favorite', 'movie', 'featuring', 'superhero', 'earned', 'single', 'bit', 'praise', 'received', 'fact', 'think', 'maybe', 'possibly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'even', 'possible']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

The first hour was better than I expected, but then it was as if the producer said, ""Wait a minute!  There haven't been enough explosions or car-chases!""

659527,A10BWW5GU19AD,B00005JPY0,Jeff Wiley,"[15, 24]","(This is a review of the film, not the DVD and its specific features)The first thing one should know about The Dark Knight is that it is not, by any stretch, a children's movie. Director Christopher Nolan has made another Batman film for adults, and it did not disappoint.What Nolan has done, with two deft strokes of his cinematic brush, is take the first four Batman films ('Batman', 'Batman Returns', 'Batman Forever', and 'Batman & Robin'), and rendered them all amateurish and unwatchable. The current series ('Batman Begins', and now 'The Dark Knight') are not so much comic book movies as they are crime dramas, cut from the same cloth as Michael Mann's best work in films such as Heat and Collateral (both personal favorites of mine).The core cast from Batman Begins remains intact, with the exception of Maggie Gyllenhal, replacing the horribly miscast Katie Holmes as assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart is added as district attorney Harvey Dent, who bring a John F. Kennedy-esque quality to the part.It is a fair statement to make that Heath Ledger's performance as Batman's arch-enemy, The Joker, has not been overhyped. Ledger deserves every accolade and ounce of praise he has received for this role. He will, in time, be on every ""Greatest Movie Villain"" list, and has rendered Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the same character to be both buffoonish and irrelevant. Nicholson's Joker was cartoonish, where Ledger's was psychotic and frightening. Early on during the movie, the viewer forgets that he is watching an actor, and gets drawn into the nightmarish persona that only Batman is equipped to confront.Tim Burton's first Batman film suffered from a lack of confrontations between Batman and The Joker. This movie did not make that same mistake, as The Joker's cat-and-mouse game -- a game he seems to be playing not only with the Guardian of Gotham, but the entire world -- unfolds over the course of the film.The story is airtight, and the acting is top-notch. My biggest beef with the film is that Bale's voice, as Batman, is extremely exaggerated. That was a surprising faux pas, as Nolan seemed to take small details such as that into account for 'Begins'. It is not, however, a dealbreaker for this movie.This is a very intense film, and certainly not meant for children. There are several white-knuckle moments throughout the movie, and I could count at least four points where I thought the movie had reached its end. It clocks in at about 2 1/2 hours, but they roll by quickly and in a satisfying manner.It is not essential that one sees Batman Begins prior to seeing this movie, but there are small references throughout this movie to the first (for example, you might wonder why there is no Batcave if you see this without seeing 'Begins'). None, however, that would prevent the viewer from enjoying the movie, or cause them to feel lost. Give this one a ten out of ten, or two thumbs up, or five stars. Whatever your rating system is, this movie will become the measuring stick for comic book movies going forward.

It does not justify, in this case, a mesmerizing performance in the league of award winners across the board. You put a fool in the makeup of the Joker, and you have a talking Mime worth a couple of laughs. Put a cool devil in the same, Picasso-like make-up and you have Old Nick with tons of Puns and one liners. I never thought in a thousand years that anyone would see the seriousness of Batman and then get financed to make a summer film, and then have the numbers and resumes to some of todays finest actors. What you have here is Heath Ledger, manipulating what was commonly associated to what we thought belonged to the Joker. Somehow, the Joker had become the cliche for maniacal counter heroes and with one landmark performance we have those illusions of believe shattered and now I see the light. Nothing deserves credit here for my high, desperate acclaim to all to see this film, but seeing Heath Ledger, or the JOker. I don't care about the Imax battle sequencing, the new uniform (new!

My husband didn't think so and thought it should of been called ""The Coming of the Joker"" Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our Caped Crusader as he struggles between his 2 personalities of being a rich heir and an upholder of justice which also puts his relationship with Rachel Dawes on the rocks.Aaron Eckhart also did an amazing job as ""white knight."" His sense of justice was also what brought him and Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal) together. However, the loss of his love and with Joker's mind-playing, he was drove to insanity and became the villain that he would have previously hated. Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent's as he struggles with emotions, justice and insanity brought Half-face to another level. Maggie Gyllenhaal did great replacement for Katie Holmes as Wayne's love interest Rachel Dawes, as she shows more sensitive and caring side towards Bruce but chose Harvey in the end. Michael Caine (Alfred) also delivered as the loyal butler who cares and took care of Bruce as well as Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox), aiding Batman in the remake of his bat suit, bat mobile and use of equipments and technology. Gary Oldman ( Lt. James Gordon) also deserves an applaud as Batman's sidekick and police officer as both track down Joker.In short, this is probably one of the best 2008 films but not without its flaws. Firstly, there were quite a number of characters for the given time. Both Joker and Batman were supposedly the main cast but so was Harvey. I wished that he was given more screen time as half-faced because the ending seemed a little rushed. There should be more acknowledgements to his role. Secondly Batman's voice was very irritating to listen to, to the point that it sound all force and unnatural.I feel that this film will appeal to audiences of a larger age group or those who read the comics. Teenagers might find it hard to understand. I had problems with it initially but after the movie, when I pieced everything together, then it started to make sense.

Hansen,"[0, 1]","It's amazing what happens when you bring a practically no-name director and allow him the ability to spend millions and millions of dollars on a franchise like Batman. To some extent, I think of Christopher Nolan as George Lucas. He hasn't directed more than 6 films, and yet he's brought in millions for the movie studios. The Dark Knight, in my opinion, is completely worth the fanfare it received.Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, etc. all did a fantastic job. The storyline is extremely well thought out, and truly expands upon Batman's growth. What really sets it apart (and Batman Begins is the same way) is that the story is more real to life versus the previous Batman movies. The previous Batman movies were more comedic.Now, on to the Blu-Ray portion of this movie, and if it's worth it. Similar to others, I did feel the 2-disc set was a little disappointing in terms of the amount of special features content, but what was there definitely was interesting. The little shorts on making certain portions of the film were extremely interesting to me. Some for instance, were that they really crashed a lamborgini, really blew up a building when they ""blew up"" the Gotham hospital, really crashed a helicopter, etc.Finally, blu-ray really shows how amazing a movie can be.

659540,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B00005JPY0,Jiang Xueqin,"[1, 13]","On one hand it's the easiest thing to make a comic book movie -- the characters, the plot, the fan base are already there. On the other hand it's the hardest thing to make a comic book movie -- the characters, the plot, the fan base are already there.There is an inherent contradiction in ""Batman"": a billionaire vigilante who prowls the streets to beat up poor thugs must be a psychopath, megalomaniac, and narcissist -- yet he accepts most social norms, the most important being that murder is wrong. Batman's a psychopath with a conscience -- he's an impossible contradiction.Nearly everyone before has chosen to ignore this contradiction but the director Christopher Nolan chooses to confront it outright in ""The Dark Knight"" by asking what a hero is, and what kind of a hero society needs.Strangely enough Mr. Nolan chooses to ask these questions by showing what a hero is not -- the real star of the movie is Batman's arch-nemesis the Joker, who in his actions and logic begins and drives the plot of the movie.The strangest thing about a villain named the Joker is that he's not funny. And he's certainly not mad, otherwise he would make sense. In a hospital scene with another villain Two-Face the Joker tries to explain his motivations -- and is completely incoherent. Joker rails against those ""with a plan"" and the order of things but unlike Tyler Durden in ""Fight Club"" doesn't point any fingers.Because he's an amoral thinker and tinkerer of the human condition the Joker would be better off calling himself ""Philosopher"" or ""Professor."" Remember how in college you attended classes where a very serious man stood on the lectern and lectured on endlessly with big words and complicated syntax? You have to believe he was talking about something serious but you just don't know what he's talking about, and in the end you have to believe he doesn't know either -- well, that's the Joker in ""The Dark Knight.""After two and a half hours we learn absolutely nothing concrete about the Joker -- and he's just implausible. He's brilliant but incoherent. He can plan the perfect bank heist, and kill anyone he wants -- but he can't articulate his motives. So we're stuck with this brilliant villain who likes to kill and maim but doesn't know why -- and we all know that what brilliant villains can do best is rationalize -- Hitler and Stalin and Mao all thought they were saviors and saints.It is impossible to watch the Joker, and not think that this is Heath Ledger playing the Joker. Heath Ledger gives a marvelously subtle performance in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" and you have to believe he's trying his best to articulate something in ""The Dark Knight"" -- possibly re-create Milton's Satan for the 21st century? -- but either the script or the director or the producer doesn't co-operate, and he's left with saying nothing whatsoever. He's trying and he's talking but he's been muted -- isn't that one of the most frustrating, unsatisfying positions an artist can find himself in?Because of Heath Ledger's death we'll all remember the Joker, and what will we remember about the Joker? That when the whole world was paying attention he said nothing at all.And how about the director Christopher Nolan? His debut ""Memento,"" though rough and jagged and excessive, is still nevertheless powerful and shocking -- one of the best films ever made. And with ""The Prestige"" -- his best film to date -- he shows what a very skilled craftsman he is. And ""The Dark Knight"" is competently made -- the music is superb, the various subplots weave together nicely, and the cinematography is stunning and innovative. But the director is clearly unsure of what kind of movie he wants to make, or capable of making. Does he want to make eye candy, and delight the 16-year old boys who are the cornerstone of the Summer Blockbuster industry? Or does he want to make a thought-provoking character study that will affirm his status as one of Hollywood's best young filmmakers? Unfortunately he wants both, and the result is thoroughly unsatisfying. He asks hard questions but gives easy answers; he wants to be an artist but he wants to appeal to popular tastes.And thus the consistent and competent Mr. Nolan may be stuck making consistently competent films all his life, and already Mr. Nolan must be asking: why? ""The Dark Knight"" says nothing, and even worse it tries too damn hard to say something.And then there's Christian Bale. He's proven himself a brilliant actor in ""American Psycho"" and ""The Machinist,"" and why he's chosen to play a Phallus for two and a half hours is an even harder question than why Joker chooses to kill and why Christopher Nolan chose to direct ""The Dark Knight."" At least the Joker must enjoy killing and Christopher Nolan enjoy directing but Mr. Bale does not look happy playing Batman -- he looks bored out of his mind. Neither Batman nor his alter-ego Bruce Wayne has any personality -- he's a hero, and he's not allowed to have any flaws.And so let's end with the question we began with: just who is Batman? Again, in our popular culture, Batman is one of the great contradictions. But more importantly he's one of the greatest inventions. Boys all think it'd be cool to be powerful and unique -- they all think they can be a superhero. Parents and teachers rightly are concerned that this aspiration unchecked could easily lead some very special children to become mass murderers. So adults imbue every comic book superhero with a conscience, and adults always tell kids it's this conscience that makes the superhero really a superhero.Now do kids really buy this? Is a superhero with a conscience really cool? But -- wait a minute -- does a superhero with a conscience make any sense? Isn't the point of having superpowers to do whatever you want, to kill whomever you choose? What's the point of being God if you have follow human laws and rules?Well, adults get away from these difficult questions by making Batman cool. How? By outlawing him -- by branding him a vigilante, and trying to arrest him. Batman is a misunderstood superhero -- and for kids that's really cool, and if their misunderstood superhero has a conscience that's okay because he's being chased by the police.That ultimately is how ""The Dark Knight"" ends. By becoming a fugitive and being outlawed Batman shows he's cooler than the Joker. We may not know the difference between what's good and what's evil but we certainly know the difference between what's cool and what's not -- and that's more important. Isn't it the coolest thing in the world not to kill but to have everyone think you killed? You have a clean conscience, and you have the respect of all your peers. That's why we can leave the movie theater exhausted but smiling -- we were right to cheer for Batman all along.",2,Boring and Pointless,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,6782,"['one', 'hand', 'easiest',

The Dark Knight however is even better than I hoped for.Batman (Christian Bale), Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) team up to bring down criminals. They aren't doing a bad job; a new criminal named the Joker (Heath Ledger) just might be more than they can handle though. He's a twisted and creepy villain with no compassion for anyone. He threatens to kill a different person until Batman reveals who he is. Which starts to become too much for Bruce Wayne since people he cares about start to become targets.The movie is an ingenious masterpiece with many twists and turns. You never know what to expect from the movie. Despite being a super hero film it also works as a mob/thriller. Sometimes I even had a hard time convincing myself that Michael Mann wasn't the director lol.Comic fans should still be pleased though. Heath Ledger is amazing as the Joker and it's sad that he won't have a long career of playing the part. He's creepy, twisted, funny and menacing in the role. What makes Ledger better than Nicholson is he does a better job at totally transforming himself into someone else. You look at Jack's Joker and see Jack but you look at Ledger's Joker and barely can tell it's Heath Ledger. It's also smart that we don't even know what made him the way he is. He tells two different stories on how he got his scars but neither of them are probably even true. Which is smarter than just seeing him fall in green chemicals.What also helps the movie is that everyone other than Ledger are in top form as well. While Christopher Nolan knows how to handle having more than one villain, unlike Sam Raimi with Spiderman 3.

It is almost a perfect transition movie that is made from a comic book story into a full length feature film.  The storyline is very good and well written and the acting is spot on with a great cast of actors.  I like Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in this movie and Alfred (Michael Caine) just plays the perfect role.  The Joker (Heath Ledger) plays the role of the new criminal mastermind who is raising chaos in the streets of Gotham.  I also liked seeing Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) again in the movie as he is always a great actor.The Joker's evil plans play Batman against the mob and the citizens of Gotham. The movie is filled with action and suspense and as the Joker's plans play out and you wonder how it will end.  I like this movie and have watched it several times.  I recommend it to you as a great film and if you are a Batman fan then it is a must see film.

659548,A4GPHAI2LRIQI,B00005JPY0,"JJD ""John""","[7, 13]","Now that four years have passed since the hype and elation of my first viewing, I feel I can now write objectively about this film, and Nolan's overall Batman approach.I love Batman. I have since I was a kid. I'm also old enough to have been age appropriate in the 80s when Frank Miller's masterpiece ""The Dark Knight Returns"" was released and turned the comics industry on it's ears. That was a Batman that was dark, gritty, and someone to fear. ""The Killing Joke"" is, IMO, the greatest Joker story ever written and also demonstrated the depth of the Joker's psychosis and overall sociopathic tendencies.Now...On with the review of The Dark Knight.Like many others here...I actually saw this twice in theaters. Both times I walked away just exhausted and swearing up and down that it was the best superhero movie ever made. I would now like to strike that statement from the record as I am now able to be objective about it (post hype). I watched it this past weekend for the first time since early 2009. Yes....I watched it once upon it's initial DVD release...and then lost interest. I often asked myself why the change of heart and sudden disinterest and, until now, couldn't put my finger on it.After doing a great deal of thinking after watching it recently, I have come to the conclusion that it is an incredibly overwrought movie. In an attempt to bring Batman into the real world, thus making his exploits all the more relatable to the viewer, Nolan has removed the fantasy elements that make Batman so great! Sure, there are some fantastical elements,as there are most action films, but Nolan also seems to want to deny the fact that Batman is a comic book character. He's not James Bond or Jason Bourne. The film plays no differently than a Bourne or Bond film...and, quite honestly, I feel it should.Not to downplay Heath Ledger's stellar performance...but Joker should be somewhat likeable. Yes...I know he's a psychopath and a mad dog killer...but in the comic books his exploits are fascinating and inventive. All Nolan and company have provided us with is a disfigured anarchist. No depth or color to him whatsoever. I have read Batman stories for decades and I assure you...the Joker I know would NOT JUST BURN piles of money to illustrate the randomness of his exploits. There is almost always an angle with him/something to be gained. While Ledger hit the mark on many aspects, the written character is more off putting and maniacal as opposed to scheming and often finding humor in almost every aspect of his own tortured existence.Christian Bale's Batman, while well played, really needs to find a way to channel the Batman without making his dialogue so unintelligable that you really need to listen carefully to understand half of what he says. Kevin Conroy, who voiced Batman for two decades now, does this subtly..but convincingly enough to make his Bruce Wayne and Batman as different as night and day. He does so without rasping his voice to the point of whispered gibberish.My third and final issue with this movie is the running time. At times, the movie just seems to go nowhere. Between the Dent plotline (and killing Dent was a criminal mistake by the filmmakers), the mobsters, the Chinese money launderer, Rachel Dawes, and the ferry boat fiasco (which simply isn't plausible as a boat filled with hardened criminals would surely have pulled that trigger every bit as quickly as a boat of law abiding citizens would to save their own lives...let's be honest), the film just seems to go on and on without a real payoff.All in all...It's a good film as far as action dramas go. In terms of ""comic book"" movies, it falls short. I know I'm sure to get lambasted by the Nolan apologists for this opinion, but it's just an opinion folks....",3,Finally able to be objective about this movie...,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,3768,"['Now', 'four', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'hype', 'elation', 'first', 'viewing', 'feel', 'can', 'now', 'write', 'objectively', 'film', 'Nolan', 'overall', 'Batman', 'approach.I', 'love', 'Batman', 'have', 'was', 'kid', ""'m"", 'also', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'age', 'appropriate', '80s', 'when', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'masterpiece', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'was', 'released', 'turned', 'comics', 'industry', 'ears', 'was', 'Batman', 'was', 'dark', 'gritty', 'someone', 'fear', 'Killing', 'Joke', 'IMO', 'greatest', 'Joker', 'story', 'ever', 'written', 'also', 'demonstrated', 'depth', 'Joker', 'psychosis', 'overall', 'sociopathic', 'tendencies.Now', 'review', 'Dark', 'Knight.Like', 'many', 'others', 'here', 'actually', 'saw', 'twice', 'theaters', 'times', 'walked', 'away', 'just', 'exhausted', 'swearing', 'up', 'was', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'would', 'now', 'strike', 'statement', 'record', 'am', 'now', 'able', 'be', 'objective', 'post', 'hype', 'watched', 'past', 'weekend', 'first', 'time', 'early', '2009', 'Yes', '.I', 'watched', 'once', 'initial', 'DVD', 'release', 'then', 'lost', 'interest', 'often', 'asked', 'why', 'change', 'heart', 'sudden', 'disinterest', 'now', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'it.After', 'doing', 'great', 'deal', 'thinking', 'watching', 'recently', 'have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'incredibly', 'overwrought', 'movie', 'attempt', 'bring', 'Batman', 'real', 'world', 'thus', 'making', 'exploits', 'more', 'relatable', 'viewer', 'Nolan', 'removed', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'make', 'Batman', 'so', 'great', 'Sure', 'are', 'fantastical', 'elements', 'are', 'most', 'action', 'films', 'Nolan', 'also', 'want', 'deny', 'fact', 'Batman', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'not', 'James', 'Bond', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'film', 'differently', 'Bourne', 'Bond', 'film', 'quite', 'honestly', 'feel', 'downplay', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Joker', 'should', 'be', 'somewhat', 'likeable', 'Yes', 'know', 'psychopath', 'mad', 'dog', 'killer', 'comic', 'books', 'exploits', 'are', 'fascinating', 'inventive', 'Nolan', 'company', 'have', 'provided', 'disfigured', 'anarchist', 'depth', 'color', 'whatsoever', 'have', 'read', 'Batman', 'stories', 'decades', 'assure', 'Joker', 'know', 'would', 'NOT', 'JUST', 'BURN', 'piles', 'money', 'illustrate', 'randomness', 'exploits', 'almost', 'always', 'angle', 'him/something', 'be', 'gained', 'Ledger', 'hit', 'mark', 'many', 'aspects', 'written', 'character', 'more', 'putting', 'maniacal', 'opposed', 'scheming', 'often', 'finding', 'humor', 'almost', 'aspect', 'own', 'tortured', 'existence.Christian', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'well', 'played', 'really', 'find', 'way', 'channel', 'Batman', 'making', 'dialogue', 'so', 'unintelligable', 'really', 'need', 'listen', 'carefully', 'understand', 'half', 'what', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'who', 'voiced', 'Batman', 'two', 'decades', 'now', 'subtly..but', 'convincingly', 'enough', 'make', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Batman', 'as', 'different', 'night', 'day', 'so', 'rasping', 'voice', 'point', 'whispered', 'gibberish.My', 'third', 'final', 'issue', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'times', 'movie', 'just', 'go', 'nowhere', 'Dent', 'plotline', 'killing', 'Dent', 'was', 'criminal', 'mistake', 'filmmakers', 'mobsters', 'Chinese', 'money', 'launderer', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'ferry', 'boat', 'fiasco', 'simply', ""n't"", 'plausible', 'boat', 'filled', 'hardened', 'criminals', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'pulled', 'trigger', 'bit', 'as', 'quickly', 'boat', 'law', 'abiding', 'citizens', 'would', 'save', 'own', 'lives', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'just', 'go', 'real', 'payoff.All', 'good', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'action', 'dramas', 'go', 'terms', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'short', 'know', ""'m"", 'sure', 'get', 'lambasted', 'Nolan', 'opinion', 'just', 'opinion', 'folks']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Batman's toys are weak, his character's inner struggle absent, and his eminence poorly challenged.This movie was an injustice, unworthy of the Dark Knight title.

Every single Batman film (from the fraudulent Mr. Burton onward) up until ""Batman Begins"" was irredeemable trash on its best day.True Be lievers need not be disappointed. Though the 'origin story' of Bruce Wayne-qua-Batman left something to be desired, it was, at last, dark enough, and scary enough, to be believed.Let's begin with Christian Bale. In addition to being a talented actor and great looking, he's able to strike the balance that the Bruce Wayne of Frank Miller had to strike: playboy, millionaire, ill at ease in high-falutin' situations. Wayne should move easily in rarefied air, and carries on his shoulders the mantle of his father's legacy. As an orphan, however, he cannot ever move easily at those heights and instead cultivates the declasse mannerisms of the parvenu. He is the Prince of Orphans, and plays it effectively.Bale's ""Batman"" is physically menacing, and dispenses entirely with Kilmer's Boy Scout veneer and Keaton's pure idiocy. He's a true heart as well, which gets lost in the focus on the psychopathia that a vigilante would have to actually wear just under the skin.Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance of the Joker, and well it should be. Though I was determined not to enjoy it, Ledger wears the mantle of the Joker with a frightening authenticity. Matching him with pretty boy Eric Roberts was a masterful stroke; his veiled psychopathy counters with the cultured pretense of the old world mobster role. There's no comparison between Nicholson's ""Joker"" to Ledger's. Nicholson's characterization was of a cartoonish oaf; Ledger's Joker is a strange and frightening fuel-air mix of pure combustion. To be sure, the writing is outstanding and plays upon the ""You Made ME!"" Gothic trope. It's beautifully executed by Messrs. Nolan and Nolan.Aaron Eckhart also redeems the Harvey Dent character. Played (and the emphasis is on ""played"") earlier by Tommy Lee Jones, Eckhart's Two-Face is rooted in an idealism run afoul. There's no mystery to Two-Face's murderous spree, and the course is set between bespoiled honor and heroism in Batman's ultimate flight. Messrs. Nolan clearly were the first to take Frank Miller's limning of Batman as an outlaw. It's about time, and I'm jealous of you if you are about to see the results for the first time.",4,Finally...A 'Dark Knight' worthy of the title,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,2404,"['Batman', 'Begins', 'True', 'Believers', 'everywhere', 'held', 'out', 'hope', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'could', 'be', 'vitalized', 'single', 'Batman', 'film', 'fraudulent', 'Mr.', 'Burton', 'onward', 'up', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'irredeemable', 'trash', 'best', 'day.True', 'Be', 'lievers', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'origin"", 'story', 'Bruce', 'Wayne-qua-Batman', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'last', 'dark', 'enough', 'scary', 'enough', 'be', 'believed.Let', 'begin', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'addition', 'being', 'talented', 'actor', 'great', 'looking', 'able', 'strike', 'balance', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'had', 'strike', 'playboy', 'millionaire', 'ill', 'ease', 'high-falutin', 'situations', 'Wayne', 'should', 'move', 'easily', 'rarefied', 'air', 'shoulders', 'mantle', 'father', 'legacy', 'orphan', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'ever', 'move', 'easily', 'heights', 'instead', 'declasse', 'mannerisms', 'parvenu', 'Prince', 'Orphans', 'effectively.Bale', 'Batman', 'physically', 'menacing', 'entirely', 'Kilmer', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'veneer', 'Keaton', 'pure', 'idiocy', 'true', 'heart', 'well', 'lost', 'focus', 'psychopathia', 'vigilante', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'wear', 'just', 'skin.Much', 'been', 'made', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Joker', 'well', 'should', 'be', 'was', 'determined', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Ledger', 'mantle', 'Joker', 'frightening', 'authenticity', 'Matching', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'was', 'masterful', 'stroke', 'veiled', 'psychopathy', 'counters', 'cultured', 'pretense', 'old', 'world', 'mobster', 'role', 'comparison', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'Ledger', 'Nicholson', 'characterization', 'was', 'cartoonish', 'oaf', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'strange', 'frightening', 'fuel-air', 'mix', 'pure', 'combustion', 'be', 'sure', 'writing', 'outstanding', 'Made', 'Gothic', 'trope', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'Messrs.', 'Nolan', 'Nolan.Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'also', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'character', 'Played', 'emphasis', 'played', 'earlier', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Eckhart', 'Two-Face', 'rooted', 'idealism', 'run', 'afoul', 'mystery', 'Two-Face', 'murderous', 'spree', 'course', 'set', 'bespoiled', 'honor', 'heroism', 'Batman', 'ultimate', 'flight', 'Messrs.', 'Nolan', 'clearly', 'were', 'first', 'take', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'limning', 'Batman', 'outlaw', 'time', ""'m"", 'jealous', 'are', 'see', 'results', 'first', 'time']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659556,A24JQTKGA5RAKX,B00005JPY0,JoeAZ92,"[2, 5]","When a film comes around that's as good as The Dark Knight, you simply can't miss it. This movie has not only one or even a few amazing aspects; every way you look at it it's impossible to call it bad. It goes over the top in almost all areas, especially in its crazy, suspenseful story, incredible buildup of suspense, and unrelenting depiction of evil.(WARNING: This review contains many SPOILERS so I advise you to not read it unless you've seen the movie).The Dark Knight tells an intense, suspenseful, and crazy story. Batman (a.k.a. Bruce Wayne) has continued to strike at the criminals of Gotham since we left him at the end of Batman Begins, and the outlaws are now getting desperate. The Joker then comes up with a brilliant idea to get these outlaws out of their mess: kill Batman. His price to carry out the job is pretty much half of the money this group of bad guys has, and he gets his way by threatening to pull the string off a grenade right in their midst. Of course, the Joker walks away with the promise of a fortune, which he couldn't care less about, and then begins to have some `fun.' To get to Batman, he decides to make him reveal his identity, and every day he stalls, people die. The stakes are raised even higher when the Joker is captured and his insane acts of evil continue to the very end, even after his final defeat.One of the things that makes this film so memorable is the pure evil that is the Joker. Heath Ledger did a simply amazing job of portraying this character, and it's a shame that he'll never know he did the best acting job of the year. He portrays a villain that reveals the darkest corners of the human heart, a place I now have caught a glimpse of thanks to his incredible performance. The Joker is so brutal and merciless, blowing up a hospital being only one of his evil deeds. Yet despite his sheer brutality, he is absolutely hilarious as well. With lines such as ""You complete me, you're just so much fun"" and ""I think we're destined to do this forever,"" (both of which are said to Batman) Joker's performance shows comedic genius and also depravation of all that is good.Another interesting character is Harvey Dent. He is really a key figure in the plot, and he ends up teaching one of the more important lessons to glean from the film. He is Gotham's new district attorney, and ends up putting hundreds of criminals in prison within the course of a few days. His character and inspiration is portrayed in many scenes, and the court scene where he takes the guy's gun shows what he's like in his position and is also laugh out loud funny. But Gotham's White Knight (as they call him) ends up losing his future wife, and that on top of getting half his face burned off and a nice talk with the Joker contributes to him descending into madness. Throughout the final scenes of the film, Dent is seen killing people he finds responsible for the death of his beloved, and even shoots the Dark Knight himself. Dent is a clear portrayal of how people can go bad; how no man is good within his own power. If you think about it, Dent is also contrasted by the criminal who throws out the detonator in the ferry at the end of the film, a `bad guy' who does the right thing. I found that very interesting.And of course, who could forget the Dark Knight himself? Again excellently portrayed by Christian Bale, Batman has many struggles in this film. Throughout the entire film, he is being pressed to reveal his identity, all the while struggling to protect the people of Gotham. Christian Bale makes a perfect Batman; he does a great job of portraying the wasteful billionaire by day and the dark, shady, rough-voiced Batman by night.The entirety of The Dark Knight is centered around suspense. The buildup of tension is incredible, and I don't think I've ever seen a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat more than this. There's always the question of ""Who is the Joker going to target next?"" or ""When will Batman reveal his identity to stop the killings?"" or ""Is he really going to blow up the hospital?"" And the sequences of the film are all done so well that it really keeps you into it every moment and never loses you attention for a single breath.The tension also builds up by way of sound. Hans Zimmer composed the score for The Dark Knight, and in that lies some incredibly epic pieces of music and some aggravating, yet tension-building, sounds. These noises hard to describe, actually, but they build up the suspense in an extraordinary way the likes of which I have never heard before. The music is just plain epic, giving you that hair-raising feeling that either something terrible is about to happen or Batman is about to do something insanely awesome. Or both.The Dark Knight also has some fantastic visual effects. The explosions are spectacular, Batman's stunts are very entertaining, and everything seems totally realistic. The effects are quite plentiful too, but sometimes you forget they are effects because they just look so real.Before I continue ranting and raving about how ridiculously awesome The Dark Knight is, I think I should end this review. The Dark Knight is one of the very best movies I have ever seen with its fantastic and deep story, amazing visual effects, quality acting, epic soundtrack, and buildup of suspense. The suspense is really one of the film's strongest points, and the ways in which that is done can be looked to as an example for future films. When it's all said and done, The Dark Knight is just 2  hours of awesomeness.SCORE: 10/10",5,"When it's all said and done, The Dark Knight is 2  hours of awesomeness",1252022400,"09 4,

It wasn't the real Joker. This is the real Joker through and through, but re-envisioned with a dose of realism. And by saying this, I dare you to find Heath Ledger anywhere in that mad man on the silver screen.The script is sharp, delves into Batman's psyche better than any cinematic endeavor to date (except for one game:Batman: Arkham Asylum.

659561,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00005JPY0,John F. Rooney,"[1, 5]","In this latest Batman outing, it is the brilliant acting by the late Heath Ledger as the Joker that becomes the core of the movie in probably his greatest role. He embellished the part with quirky mannerisms like poking the corner of his mouth with his tongue. His face, even with its thick make-up, expresses the deep resentment and pain within him. The funniest scene is when he's in a nurse's dress walking away from his horrific bombing of a hospital.Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne does a creditable job. Christian Bale and Christian Slater: two leading actors of the day with the first name Christian, and both have run afoul of the law; no wonder people have difficulty differentiating between the various current cookie-cutter young actors.Bale, when he's in the Batman costume, presents a problem. Batman is wrestling with his conscience about the lost lives he has cost, but when his voice is a deep croak and when he's encased in that ridiculous new bloated, mechanistic costume that takes away all humanity; his soul-searching becomes meaningless. If he is made to look like a machine, how does that jibe with his deep angst over his human conscience?Subsidiary characters are very well-acted; Michael Caine is the butler, Morgan Freeman plays a character like the armorer Q from the James Bond flicks, Gary Oldman plays police lieutenant Gordon, and Gary Eckhart plays crime-fighting Harvey Dent. This movie has two supervillains because it also features Two-Face with his coin tosses from the comic books. The scarred half of his face features an eye like a big marble.Watch for spectacular vehicular mayhem with trucks, creative camera work featuring the eerie and forbidding cityscape with a scale that dwarfs human beings. Explosions and fires, characters defying gravity by spectacular flights--this movie entices the senses, and gives us lots of WOW moments. After all the smashing of windows in this picture, why would anyone in the flick stand by big wall sized windows again?But the movie is too long by about twenty minutes. It could have been tighter, less repetitive and more gripping with a faster pace. The last fourth has too much pontificating and preaching. Also at the end it steps out of chronological sequence. The movie keeps too many plot strands running.I saw it on an Imax screen, but it was not in three D format necessitating glasses. This is a fine movie, but its length and repetitiveness are off-putting.

659564,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00005JPY0,John Kwok,"[3, 5]","""The Dark Knight"" is more than a mere crowd-pleasing summer action-adventure film. It is really a stylish, brutal, and emotionally gripping, thriller which asks how far a crime-fighting vigilante, the Batman, will descend the same moral slippery slope occupied by the Joker and his band of ruthless homicidal Gotham thieves.  To watch this film in its entirety is to see just how far Bruce Wayne/the Batman will become Gotham's ""Dark Knight"", relying on every possible means to prevent the Joker from terrorizing the city via his homicidal criminal war against it. Christian Bale excels in showing the multifaceted, twisted and tormented, person that Bruce Wayne/the Batman has become. However, as others have noted, the film's emotional core truly belongs to the diabolical Joker, chillingly portrayed by Heath Ledger in a stellar performance that deserves a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Ledger's portrayal of this homicidal lunatic should go down in history as one of the great onscreen portrayals of villains in the movies. And yet, neither Heath Ledger nor Christian Bale remain the only reasons to see ""The Dark Knight"". Gary Oldman's Gotham police lieutenant Gordan deserves ample praise to for its emotional complexity, as does Aaron Eckhart's brilliant performance as the crusading young Gotham district attorney Harvey Dent, who is transformed eventually into another homicidal lunatic, Two-Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite convincing too as Wayne's long-time friend, Rachel Dawes, while Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman return again to offer excellent performances as the butler Alfred, and Wayne Corporation technological guru Lucius Fox. Director/writer Christopher Nolan never lets loose his tight-fisted reins on the picture itself, offering us not a single wasted shot of unnecessary dialogue or gratuitous violence; every scene works remarkably well.

However, a fiendish clown crook named The Joker (Heath Ledger) with his clown goons have been commiting terror throughout the city with his sick twisted sense of humor and mayhem. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) join forces with our hero to put a stop to his hideous crimes once and for all.Co-starring Maggie Gyllenhall, Michael Caine, Eric Roberts, Michael Jai White, Cillian Murphy and Anthony Michael Hall, this is truly one of the best movies in recent memory. This is one of those rare sequels that can actually be better then the original and can be a masterpiece, while ""Batman Begins"" which rebooted the Batman series thanks to Christopher Nolan was the appetizer then get ready for the main course which is this movie. This one is more action packed, more smarter and more emotional then the last one as it with a great performance by the late Heath Ledger who passed away when the film was done filming, which is kind of tragic for a very good actor like him to die so early for he gives a performance of a lifetime as everyone's favorite Bat-villain more then Jack Nicholson or Caesar Romero. Co-writer, producer and director Christopher Nolan has proved to himself to be one of the greatest directors in recent memory for he reinvented the superhero movie genre much like Richrd Donner did with ""Superman 1 & 2"", Bryan Singer with ""X-Men 1 & 2"" and Sam Raimi with ""Spider-Man 1 & 2"" but making it more of a gritty adult crime action drama then just a comic-esque type of film. The movie includes the origin of Two-Face which Dent becomes as this portrayl puts the Tommy Lee Jones version to shame, i'm suprised how the film got away with a PG-13 rating since it was a violent film with some dark humorous moments like the pencil trick to the eye scene as it's both disturbing and funny at the same time. This is a more grown-up Batman movie then before with the exception of ""Batman Begins"" as it proves that even a comic book movie can be a great masterpiece.This Blu-Ray contains brillaint picture and sound with the action sequences that will blow your home theater away!

Certainly the previews looked good, and the viral marketing campaign was interesting though not compelling.This film was, is, and will forever be anchored by Ledger's performance as The Joker.  Too bad the rest of the film doesn't match his level.  Truthfully, I liked ""The Dark Knight"" a lot.  Saw it several times in the theatres.  But it most certainly has its flaws.  There are plenty of lapses in logic (narrative flow, not ""realism"") and several moments that are just not done very well.Many fans of this movie are touting director Christopher Nolan as a ""genius"" for the way he crafted this movie.  ""Genius""?  Please. Let's ease up on the fanboy hyperbole, shall we?  He did a competent job but he is no genius.  Any one of several talented writer/directors could have done equally well if not better.Don't let your enthusiasm for the product, which was quite possibly stimulated and inflated by well over a year of pent-up excitement for the film's release, color your objectivity.The previous Nolan ""Batman"" film ""Batman Begins"" suffered from some choppy editing that was jarring and distracting.  This film has slightly less of that but still has pacing issues.  The movie feels more like a series of moments strung together rather than a story with a smooth flow.During my first viewing of this film I was thoroughly entertained by several segments of it but thoroughly bothered by moments that we handled lazily, sloppily, and even amateurishly.This film is an improvement over ""Batman Begins"", but it is bouyed by a much more interesting villain.

659573,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B00005JPY0,Joker,"[0, 0]","This review is about the movie itself, and not about the DVD and its features.We all know that The Dark Knight was an overwhelming success, practically grossing $1 billion worldwide at the box office. A lot of it has to do with Heath Ledger's death sparking an intense interest in the film, but also the fact that the iconic villain The Joker is in the movie, no matter who plays the character. I feel the movie doesn't quite live up to the hype, though it ALMOST does. The feeling I get watching this movie is like I'm watching some crime drama on Wednesday nights on ABC television. The new Christopher Nolan Batman series has that feel and atmosphere. Very modern, realistic, and dark. It doesn't quite have that ""Batman comic book movie"" feel to it, when I compare these new movies to the 1960s TV series and Batman: The Movie (1966) and the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher films.The highlights of this movie are the performances of Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two Face and Heath Ledger as The Joker. I thought Ledger's performance was good.  He definitely ""became"" another person or character to the point where you would never know it's Heath Ledger under that makeup, because he drastically changed his voice and mannerisms in his own portrayal of The Joker.  It's also hard to recognize Ledger PHYSICALLY because the black makeup around his eyes makes it harder to tell it's him, versus if he had white makeup around his eyes, like Jack Nicholson did.  I must say that Jack Nicholson's Joker would have been even better if he would have changed his voice and mannerisms so it would be harder to tell it was him underneath that makeup.  Anyway, in my opinion, Ledger's Joker was not truly Joker-like overall, even if his portrayal is how the comic book Joker ""supposedly"" is (that's very debatable).  His portrayal of The Joker was adequate for this realistic modern Batman movie.  Cesar Romero's version was good for the campy 1960s TV series and the 1966 movie, and Jack Nicholson's version was good for the 1989 movie. But I often think of Ledger's famous line, ""Why so serious?"" I think that's a legitimate question he could have asked HIMSELF - ""Why so serious?"" In my opinion, his portrayal of The Joker was way too serious.  Not enough laughing and clowning around for my tastes.  No gadgets.  No hand buzzer.  No squirting lapel flower. That's why I like the Romero and Nicholson versions better.  Ledger did a good job ACTING, but the Joker should be funnier and live up to his name, The Joker.  In other words, crack some jokes.  There should be a balance of evilness and dark humor.  The Heath Ledger Joker was 85% evil, 15% funny.  In contrast, the Jack Nicholson Joker was about 50% evil, 50% funny.  But in defense of Ledger, he had to do what Christopher Nolan wanted him to do, for the most part.It was nice to see that this movie gave a tip of the hat to Cesar Romero during the bank robbery scene at the beginning of the movie.  Heath Ledger is wearing a mask that is nearly identical to the one that Cesar Romero wore during the TV series episode The Joker Is Wild (1966).  Romero wore the mask while singing opera at The Gotham City Opera Company during the Pagliacci performance.I thought The Joker stole the show in this movie, even more so than in the 1989 Batman movie. Christian Bale took a back seat as Batman.  Ironically, the movie is called The Dark Knight, but Batman certainly wasn't on center stage.  This movie should have been named The Joker Emerges or something like that.  In comparison, Michael Keaton in the 1989 movie didn't take as much of a back seat to Jack Nicholson, even though Nicholson stole the show. In my opinion, Christian Bale is mediocre as Bruce Wayne and Batman in this movie. That I've-been-smoking-for-40-years voice of his has got to go.  His voice is even deeper than it was in Batman Begins.While I like Katie Holmes a little better than Maggie Gyllenhaal in the role of Rachel Dawes, Gyllenhaal's performance was good.  But one thing I noticed is that the Rachel Dawes of The Dark Knight has a different personality than the Rachel Dawes of Batman Begins.  Rachel in Batman Begins seems feisty, sassy, confident, and has sort of an attitude.  Rachel in The Dark Knight seems more reserved, polite, non-sassy, and less confident.  To me, Gyllenhaal looks kind of like Carrie Fisher.I don't understand why the cops, after capturing The Joker, didn't wash the makeup off The Joker's face so they could see who's underneath the makeup.  I would think that would be the first thing they'd do, but they didn't do it.  Don't the cops want to try to identify the guy?If you like comic book movies with a lot of realism and seriousness to them where humor is almost nonexistent, then this will be your cup of tea. This movie has everything -- explosions, references to DNA, the latest technological gadgets, you name it. You know the setting is in 2008 when you watch it. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it fell short as far as having a true Batman comic book movie feel to it and for the lack of humor.  I think this movie is way too serious and humorless.  It tries to be so realistic, yet we've got Harvey Dent walking around with open wounds on his face, half of which is missing.  Apparently there's no such thing as infections in this realistic world of Gotham City in The Dark Knight.  Also, in a ""realistic"" world, if there was a guy roaming the streets wearing greasepaint on his face, people would laugh at him and not take him seriously and he'd get arrested easily, just like that ""real life Spiderman"" guy from a few years ago who appeared on the news climbing buildings.  Any kook like that gets arrested.  Easily.  The same can be said about Batman, a guy dressed in a bat suit.  People in a ""realistic"" world would laugh at him.  If you're going to make a movie based on comic book characters, make it look like a comic book movie, not something that looks like a realistic and serious cop drama on primetime TV.  On the other hand, if you insist on taking the ""realistic"" cop drama approach, you might as well go all the way with it.  In other words, don't have anything in the movie that's unrealistic or unbelievable, such as Harvey Dent's face.  Otherwise, the realism starts to get diluted and leaves you scratching your head.Tim Burton got it right.  He took the approach of making a comic book movie look like a comic book movie, which allowed him to get away with unrealistic and unbelievable things.  Why is it that Christopher Nolan is ending the series after three movies, with The Dark Knight Rises being the final movie?  It's very simple - he's running out of believable villains that he can use in his ""realistic"" crime drama world he's created.  You can't have The Penguin in the realistic world he's created.  You can't have Mr. Freeze, either.  You can't have Poison Ivy, and on and on and on.  Those are vintage comic book villains that simply would not fit into Nolan's Gotham City, which, by the way, looks too ordinary.  Why does the Ledger Joker wear greasepaint on his face and green dye in his hair instead of being a guy who has white skin and green hair as a result of falling into a vat of chemicals?  The answer is because in the realistic Nolan world, chemically discolored skin and hair couldn't happen.  Why doesn't the Ledger Joker use a squirting lapel flower, a hand buzzer, etc.?  The answer is because in Nolan's realistic world, these things would come off as unrealistic and campy.  When you think about all the things I've mentioned, you can easily see that Nolan has sucked most of the character, life, feel, and atmosphere out of the Batman that we knew from the time period circa 1940 - 2005.  Look at what he's done to the characters as well, including the iconic Joker.  In my opinion, Batman movies should always have a comic book feel to them, not a crime drama feel to them.The Dark Knight?

659575,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00005JPY0,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[2, 4]","Wow, what a summer. Its only halfway over and already I've been treated to two incredible super hero films, The Incredible Hulk [Theatrical Release] and the masterpieceIron Man (Special Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] which, to me, is one of the top three super hero films of all time along side the likes ofSpider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)andBatman Begins (Widescreen Edition). From deeper then expected films likeWall-E [Theatrical Release] to the resurrection of the Indiana Jones franchise in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull [Theatrical Release], this has been one incredible summer for movies. But as good as those films were, they pale miserably when compared to the newest installment of to the Batman franchise, The Dark Knight, staring the recently deceased Heath Ledger. Where Iron Man brought the super hero genera back to life with its wit and satire after the incredible flop that wasSpider-Man 3 (Widescreen Edition), The Dark Knight manages to combine beautify choreographed action sequences, dark and grotesque hummer, and just the right amount of moral philosophy to make this film meaningful without making it self important and preachy.Gotham City isn't the same it once was. Where crime lords and thugs once walked the streets at night unopposed and unchallenged, now they cower in fear, hiding their faces at night. Where Gotham City in the first film was a bleak, lifeless, hell hole, it has undergone a change of lighting which has transformed it from an almost mythical city to something a little more realistic and relatable. Gotham has always seemed, to me at least, considering the various comics, animated shows and films, to be somewhat, I don't know, demonic and unreal. It never seemed like a real place to me, just somewhere for crazy villains to run around and fight the Dark Knight; not so in this new movie. This could very easily be any large city in the US. The great lengths the craters put into making even the nuttiest villains, such as The Joker and Two Face, believable is outstanding. Remember the insanely stupid Two Face fromBatman Forever? He's given a complete overhaul in this film, given character and personality as well as some wicked awesome makeup.But the real story of this film isn't Two Face, its Joker. Because of the untimely death of Heath Ledger The Dark Knight became not just another summer blockbuster but also a homepage to a great actor. I remember something my friend said a few months back about this film which made me smirk, ""It better be good, or else he's always going to be remembered as the gay cowboy guy."" Ha, well, there's no fear of that, he will be forever remembered as the man who gave us the best super villain acting of all time. His performance as Joker is nothing short of incredible. Joker is utterly terrifying, not simply creepy or maybe disturbing like many other comic book bad guys, but down right bone chilling. Let me put it this way, HE SCARED ME TO DEATH! Its not so much the face paint, the scares on his cheeks, or the way he constantly smacks his lips together; its his maddening attention to detail, his complete disregard for life including his own, its the glee he shows while watching his victims die; but most of all its his unpredictable, spontaneous, and chaotic nature which scares me to death. See, Joker isn't like your typical criminal who commits crime for the sake of money, wealth, or power. No, as he said himself, ""there are two things I like; gunpowder and knives, and both are cheap."" He simply likes watching the world burn; he gets a kick out of showing off the hypocrisy of modern society by stripping us of our security and watching us destroy one another out of fear. He doesn't want anything, he simply wants to prove that, deep down, we're no different then he. He's not crazy, he tells us, he's simply ""ahead of the curve.""We fear Joker because he doesn't have a plan; he simply does things almost at random.""I'm like a dog chasing a car, I have no idea what I'd do if I actually caught it, I just do things.""""People never panic when things go according to plan. If I say a truck full of soldiers will die tomorrow, no one panics, because its part of a plan. But if I say I killed the mayor, then everyone goes crazy.""In a way, Joker isn't just a crazy anarchist; he's a symbol of what we humans really are deep down inside. We don't just fear him out of his disregard for human life, we fear him because, in a way, he reminds too much of ourselves, of what we'd like to pretend we're not. He's an animal who wants to show the rest of us that we are too, that when push comes to shove, the animalistic nature in all of us will win out and consume us. That's his goal all along, that and simply having a little fun.""Either you die a hero, or you live long enough to turn into the villain.""Words of wisdom indeed. The three main characters in this film, Batman, Joker, and Two Face, each symbolize something different; Batman, absolute good, a protector of the weak, the ""hero we deserve, but don't necessarily need,"" the moral compass which tells us right from wrong; Joker, absolute evil, anarchy, the evil nature of us all; and Two Face, the wary soul caught in between. He is us, the common man stripped of everything he values. With just the right push, gravity takes hold and he plummets into a downward spiral. His double face isn't merely the punch line of a bad joke as it was in Batman Forever; it's a tragic symbol of our own humanity.""Evil is beyond the reach of no man.""-Emmanuel Kant.But as Joker would say, ""Why so serious?"" I could talk all night about the philosophical ideals and truths of this film, but this is still a super hero movie is it not? Shouldn't I say something about the action? No need to fear my little Batman loving minions, The Dark Knight may be a deep moralistic film but that doesn't mean it neglects the action. True, he doesn't use his little throwing bats that much, but from sonar eyes one really awesome motorcycle, the Bat carries enough gizmo's and gadgets to satisfy even the most avid fans.I could go one and on about how this is one of the best movie I've ever seen. From the political spin it puts on the issue of warentless wiretapping, its commentary on the war on terror, the contrast between doing the right thing because of ones convictions as opposed to simply doing it out of fear for the consequences, to its aggressive attack on the hypocrisy of our modern society, The Dark Knight doesn't cut any corners. This is quite likely the best film of the year, and if its not nominated for best picture at the end of the year I'm going to throw a fit.In the end, when we mankind is stripped of its security and possessions, we are nothing more then the most dangerous of animals.",5,Quite possibly the best movie of the year,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,6780,"['Wow', 'what', 'summer', 'only', 'halfway',

Batman is an urban sort of myth that fights crime and injustice but now he will have to face Gotham's most dangerous and deadly criminal, The Joker.The movie contains plenty of political sub-plots that are very interesting and add something special because it adds a dark feeling to the viewing experience. Also, the action sequences are extremely well done and make the movie spectacular.ar The acting is simply great. Christian Bale delivers a more humanistic but aggressive Batman. He gives emotions to the character and that's why he's likable. But Heath Ledger steals the show with his wicked and deep performance as the devilish and disturbed Joker. This performance is now a classic and will never be forgotten in Pop Culture.The action is just excellent, a delight for everyone. Since the first shooting at the bank scene you know what to expect.

659577,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B00005JPY0,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[1, 3]","Although it looks like a simple movie in the beginning, ""The Dark Knight"" is a complex film that plays on the fear of anarchy.The movie opens with a bank heist. Each hoodlum with a clown face shoots the other until the Joker arrives to take his money for himself. However, the Joker is not interested in money. He is more interested in spreading fear and anarchy.Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne, works with Police Lieutenant Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. Although Harvey is dating Bruce's ex-girlfriend, Bruce is certain that Harvey would be the person to bring peace and justice to Gotham City.And for awhile, it seems that the three-man team took down the mob, which had connections with a Chinese businessman and some other Gotham gangs. However, the Joker plays a trump card--he kills the two people involved in the prosecution and gets close to killing Harvey.After the disaster, the Joker makes matters worse, with attempts to kill Gordon and Harvey. The Joker also plans other murders beforehand, revealing them in a ruthless interrogation scene. Batman is forced to make decisions to choose which person he needs to save, and even that decision may not be the right one.This is not an easy superhero film to watch. To give people a hint on the ending, let's just say that hearts will be shattered in many situations.Batman may be a hero, but he never does everything perfect. This is one of the few films that shows that a superhero is vulnerable, and he puts so many things at risk to do his job. Is it worth it for him to fight as a hero when he could lose everything? Who knows. But for whatever reason, he's still fighting.

The very talented and amazing Heath Ledger really out does himself as the Joker. It's a real pity that this will be the last film we will ever see him in, the Joker was scary and psychotically entertaining, he pretty much stole the entire show. The Joker is bent on creating mass hysteria, mayhem and chaos with no real goal in mind other than to destroy the city of Gotham. Between himself and the local mafia and other gangs, he convinces (in so many words) to devise a plan to, ""kill the Batman"". Bruce Wayne puts his faith into the ""Golden Boy"" Harvey Dent to clean up the city, but perhaps placing all of his cards in one basket was a bad move? In the end, his hopes and dreams burn (along with the man he wanted to see in office and Rachael) and becomes someone who literally looses his mind and is reborn as Two-Face and hell bent on vengeance. I don't want to give too much of the film away, but this is not to be missed on the big screen. Spectacular action, a superb cast and a mesmerizing story will maintain your attention the entire time. You don't have to be a Batman or comic book fan to like this film, it's really that good. Best of all, see Heath Ledger put on a great performance as one of the best comic book character icons of all time. I'm a fan of the Tim Burton Batman films, but this is a much darker rendition of the Dark Horse Batman series and done very well might I add.

659590,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B00005JPY0,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[1, 1]","Honestly, ""The Dark Knight"" is a very good movie.  It's dark, dramatic, full of rich themes, unexpected developments, and great performances.  Note my star rating.  It's not, however, the second coming.  Just to pull everyone back down to Earth a little, here are a few discussion points of the ""not quite gushing with praise"" variety:The movie is overstuffed and, plotwise, it's all over the map.  I'm convinced there were three or four hours worth of usable material when all was said and done and that director Christopher Nolan and his editors ""found"" the movie in the editing room, chipping away at the granite until they had a coherent movie.  And it IS coherent.  But I think the film would have flowed better and had more momentum if the final story was nailed down at the script stage instead.While previous ""Batman"" movies killed us with too much production design, to the point that a fantastic character like the Batman didn't even stand out against all the weird buildings and statues populating Gotham City, ""The Dark Knight"" went to the opposite extreme and, for the most part, just shot on ordinary streets in real cities (mostly Chicago).  I don't know, as much as I complained about the over-production in the previous movies, using nothing but ordinary, pre-exisitng locales this time out came off as sort of low-budget looking to me.  For the record, I think the previous movie, ""Batman Begins"" was the most successful Bat-film in striking the right balance between moody constructed sets and location shooting done on real streets.Moving onto the Two-Disc Special Edition, two things underwhelmed. For one thing, the picture quality was only okay.  Perfectly acceptable, but only that.  Where was the sharpness and the detail?  It was almost bad enough for me to believe the conspiracy theorists who are saying that Warner Brothers wanted to subtly push everyone toward buying the pricier Blu-Ray disc by not working too hard to make the standard DVD edition look all that great.  Secondly, where are all the great special features?  You get a few items of interest, but ultimately things are pretty sparse for a two-disc set.  I guess the extra digital copy of the movie for your computer didn't impress me much.So, those are my qualms.  I like the movie a lot, but I think you'll enjoy it more if you lower your expectations a little (that last comment goes out to the four people who haven't yet seen the movie in theaters and will be catching it for the first time on disc).  And the Two-Disc Special Edition probably isn't worth the extra expense; just get the single-disc edition and save a few dollars.When all is said and done, see ""The Dark Knight"" for Heath Ledger, a few good set pieces, the brooding music, and a couple unexpected shocks.  And, in the end, I guess that's enough.",4,"Don't avoid by any means, but both film and DVD do have a few shortcomings",1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,2812,"['Honestly', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'dark', 'dramatic', 'full', 'rich', 'themes', 'unexpected', 'developments', 'great', 'performances', 'Note', 'star', 'rating', 'not', 'however', 'second', 'coming', 'Just', 'pull', 'everyone', 'back', 'down', 'Earth', 'little', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'discussion', 'points', 'not', 'quite', 'gushing', 'praise', 'variety', 'movie', 'overstuffed', 'plotwise', 'map', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'were', 'three', 'four', 'hours', 'usable', 'material', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'editors', 'found', 'movie', 'editing', 'room', 'chipping', 'away', 'granite', 'had', 'coherent', 'movie', 'IS', 'coherent', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'flowed', 'better', 'had', 'more', 'momentum', 'final', 'story', 'was', 'nailed', 'down', 'script', 'stage', 'instead.While', 'previous', 'Batman', 'movies', 'killed', 'too', 'much', 'production', 'design', 'point', 'fantastic', 'character', 'Batman', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'stand', 'out', 'weird', 'buildings', 'statues', 'populating', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'went', 'opposite', 'extreme', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'shot', 'ordinary', 'streets', 'real', 'cities', 'mostly', 'Chicago', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'as', 'much', 'complained', 'over-production', 'previous', 'movies', 'using', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'pre-exisitng', 'locales', 'time', 'out', 'came', 'off', 'sort', 'low-budget', 'looking', 'record', 'think', 'previous', 'movie', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'most', 'successful', 'Bat-film', 'striking', 'right', 'balance', 'moody', 'constructed', 'sets', 'location', 'shooting', 'done', 'real', 'streets.Moving', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'two', 'things', 'underwhelmed', 'one', 'thing', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'only', 'okay', 'Perfectly', 'acceptable', 'only', 'that', 'Where', 'was', 'sharpness', 'detail', 'was', 'almost', 'bad', 'enough', 'believe', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'who', 'are', 'saying', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'wanted', 'subtly', 'push', 'everyone', 'buying', 'pricier', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'not', 'working', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'standard', 'DVD', 'edition', 'look', 'great', 'Secondly', 'where', 'are', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'get', 'few', 'items', 'interest', 'ultimately', 'things', 'are', 'pretty', 'sparse', 'two-disc', 'set', 'guess', 'extra', 'digital', 'copy', 'movie', 'computer', 'did', ""n't"", 'impress', 'much.So', 'are', 'qualms', 'movie', 'lot', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'more', 'lower', 'expectations', 'little', 'last', 'comment', 'out', 'four', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'movie', 'theaters', 'will', 'be', 'catching', 'first', 'time', 'disc', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'probably', ""n't"", 'worth', 'extra', 'expense', 'just', 'get', 'single-disc', 'edition', 'save', 'few', 'dollars.When', 'said', 'done', 'see', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'few', 'good', 'set', 'pieces', 'brooding', 'music', 'couple', 'unexpected', 'shocks', 'end', 'guess', 'enough']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659595,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005JPY0,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","When a film attains the success of The Dark Knight, it becomes hard for people to look at the film objectively. This is the third highest grossing film of all time, unanimously praised by critics and audiences alike; if someone calls it overrated, you can hardly blame them. I hadn't seen this film since it's theatrical release and decided to watch it again recently to see if was still as good as I remembered it...It was better.With Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan brought new life to the Batman franchise. That film was a very strong film, but The Dark Knight is a complete change in tone from it. They could be stand-alone films barely sharing the same genre. The Dark Knight is neither an action film nor is it a traditional comic book film, but a crime-drama more in the vein of Heat and The Departed than Batman Begins.What struck me about the film watching it again was how well written it is. The script (by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan) is very tight; every scene in the film is absolutely necessary to advance the plot and even with a 2  hour running time, the film never seems long. Since his career began, Nolan has proved himself a born storyteller and The Dark Knight only further validates his ability with dialogue that is at times reminiscent of old Hollywood and scenes that are already iconic only two years after the film's release. As a director, Nolan can do it all and here he balances drama, suspense, and elaborate action sequences (with a remarkable lack of CGI) effortlessly. The film's terrific opening scene shows off Nolan's skill in both of these areas of filmmaking, as it's one of the most memorable opening scenes of the last several years setting the tone for the film and serving as an incredible introduction to the Joker.The film is extremely well-made with an epic score (by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard), striking cinematography (by Wally Pfister), and an elaborately detailed production design (by Nathan Crowley) particularly standing out.Much of the cast from Batman Begins returns here and have all settled nicely into their roles. Michael Caine (Alfred) and Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) are as charming and fatherly as ever. Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon is very impressive, bringing a great deal of humanity and likeability to a role that many actors couldn't convey. Cillian Murphy returns briefly as the Scarecrow seemingly to remind people that this film is a direct sequel. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as Rachel and has a much meatier role here, one that Holmes likely wouldn't have pulled off as well. Christian Bale solidifies his status as the best Batman to grace the screen balancing the charming, arrogant Bruce Wayne and the angry, violent Batman. Bale shows this character as the haunted soul that he is and really gets under the skin of Bruce Wayne, the man and what drives him. It's an impressive performance of an iconic comic-book character to say the least. While much has been made about his Batman voice (although it seems the blame should be placed more on post-production editing than Bale), I was never bothered by it. Is it excessive at times? Yes. But if a well-known billionaire playboy was also a masked vigilante, he'd probably have to make good and sure no one would recognize his voice.Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's district attorney Harvey Dent (and later Two-Face, of course) really shines here. Eckhart does an extraordinary job taking a complicated character with an unbelievable character arc and making it believable. He really does not get enough credit for what he's done here.Now, I must discuss Heath Ledger...Because everyone else has to whether saying anything new or not. Heath Ledger became the second person to win a posthumous Oscar for his performance, which has arguably attracted the most attention to the film. His Oscar win was not a sympathy vote nor does this sympathy play into the unanimous acclaim, nor the endearing popularity of this performance. Dead or alive, Ledger's performance would have been met with the same reaction as its a true revelation. As the most psychopathic, anarchic super-hero movie villain ever Ledger disappears into the role physically and otherwise. It's one of the best, most fascinating screen performances of the last decade. If anyone had attempted what Ledger does here it likely would've seemed campy and over-the-top. Ledger brings such nuance, control, energy, and presence to the screen. Look no further than the fundraiser scene between the Joker and Rachel for evidence. This was an actor who had not even begun to show the world what he was capable of and, in one of his final roles he created one of the most iconic, memorable screen villains in cinematic history.The Dark Knight is one of the few summer blockbusters that actually stands as a great film, because of brilliant writing and brilliant performances. Ignoring its box-office take and all the hype that still surrounds it, it's clear that the film is not `overrated, it's just go good it can't be ignored. The Dark Knight is a high-minded popcorn movie, but most high-minded dramas aren't even this well-made. Yes, you will read at least one person anywhere talking about how ""overrated"" this movie is, but don't let that affect your own opinion of it. It's not one of my favorite films of all time, but it's a very good, very rich film that is a truly masterful piece of filmmaking. It's not a perfect film, but it's a superhero/comic book movie that transcends that genre. Objectively, you'd be hard-pressed to admit that this is not the best superhero movie ever made.GRADE: A-",5,A Masterful Piece of Filmmaking,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,5604,"['When', 'film',

The movie's plot line eventually goes off in a hundred different dizzying directions, totally confusing and boring this viewer. I found myself nodding off for two minute intervals throughout.  I'm giving it two starts for the special effects, but even they weren't anything I haven't seen before in other movies.  Maybe I'm just getting old and jaded, but this Batman seemed like a wimp.

659601,A1IIMZRF7G2JT7,B00005JPY0,J.P Williams,"[0, 0]","After ""Changing The Game"" that comes with making comic book Films in ""Batman Begins"" (2005), Christopher Nolan once again delves deep into Bruce Wayne's own tortured psyche and focuses the story on his own motivations for fighting crime as Batman in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008).What can I say that hasn't already been said about this film? The acting performances are great, the IMAX SHOTS are excellent, Heath Ledger's Joker was quite simply hypnotic, Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent/Two Face was inspired, it fell in line with Jim Loeb and Tim Sale's ""The Long Halloween"" Comic Book. Eckhart's ""Dent"" wants to make Gotham safe for all its citizens and means business when it comes to Law and Order.The best part about Nolan's  ""Dark Knight"" is the fact that we get to see Harvey's own gradual but personal descent into madness. Even his own ""flipping of the coin"" motif is vital to Harvey and his character even before his transformation is complete. Christian Bale's Batman is once again on par (if not better) than he was in ""Batman Begins""! Even though his ""Bat Growl"" makes him sound like he's got Throat cancer, Bale brings a seriousness to Batman, one that is welcomed among Bat-fans, like myself. We also see the tragic downfall of Batman as well, as his actions to save Gotham actually have real consequences for many its citizens, especially Rachel.Michael Caine once again provides the suitable heart of the film as Alfred Pennyworth.  Alfred remains as the conscience of Bruce, and his warnings to him about being Batman provide some real weight and foreshadowing for the entire film's plot.In Addition, Maggie Gyllenhall is very good as Rachel Dawes (even though I though that Katie Holmes was better in the role). I felt that she brought a warmth and cadence to her performance. Rachel clearly wants what's best for Bruce, despite the fact she can no longer wait for Bruce to resign as Batman. Morgan Freeman once again delivers as Lucius Fox. Freeman brings an excellent sense of comic relief (Caine does the same with Alfred as well). Fox supplies Bruce with a cool new Bat-suit that is both more flexible and grounded in reality.Other Notable Actors include Michael Jai White(who does a fine job as Gambol despite his small amount of screen time; blink and you might miss him), and Eric Roberts who does an equally excellent job as Sal Maroni. Roberts brings a ""old style"" flair to his performance, giving audiences the vibe of a distinguished Mob boss in a similar style, yet different way from Tom Wilkinson's Carmine Falcone in ""Batman Begins""(2005).David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan's story is well done, which pits Batman against an enemy that he can't ""fully understand"". The plot twists and turns make this film truly enjoyable to watch over and over again, and each time I see  it, the movie itself still feels fresh and new, even five years since its theatrical release. The Interrogation scene between Batman and Joker is an example some of the greatest conflict dialogue ever put on film.My favorite scene in the film is still when Joker interrupts the ""broad daylight"" mob summit! ""If we don't deal with this now...Soon...Little Gambol here, wont be able to get a nickel for his grandma.""-The Joker says during the summit. I love how he lies about his origin story to Gambol, Rachel, and even Batman himself during certain scenes in the movie, which is also in line with Joker's own ""multiple choice origin story"" aesthetic from the comics. Clearly Joker's arch in the film is to mess things up in Gotham, and break down Batman and Gotham's citizens, as well as destroying Harvey's reputation as the city's ""White Knight"".The IMAX SHOTS (despite being few and far between in some moments in the movie)  bring a tremendous amount of drama and weight to the now iconic action and landscape scenes that have become synonymous with Nolan's ""Batman"" Trilogy. The  shots make me wish that the entire movie was shot in IMAX, instead of a 35 mm format with some special shots for good measure. My favorite IMAX sequence is when Joker is chasing Harvey's police convoy down the lower fifth street tunnel and the Tumbler joins the party! That was an amazing scene! Oh, and by the way, the Bat-pod is the coolest motorbike on two wheels. Don't leave home without it!If you haven't seen this film, than what are you waiting for? This film wasn't just an ""eye opener"" for comic book films, it was the film that set the standard for future films in this genre, regardless of their characters, or their continuity. Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" was not just a good movie, but the centerpiece of a great Batman Trilogy. Without it, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" would have no cause to exist. This is a movie that no fan should find themselves without.5 out 5 Stars!

Though it probably won't happen Bale, Ledger, and director Nolan should all get nominated for best actor and director respectively. This movie is definitely multiple OSCAR worthy.I have been a big fan of comic book hero/movie adaptations my whole life and I thought Spider Man II set the bar and still is an incredible movie but Dark Knight may have surpassed Spidey II.The chemistry between the actors and the way the script flows was simply amazing and the special effects were extremely well done without being a bit too absurd like they were in Revenge of the Sith and yes I loved that movie too.In the end though this movie stands on its on. Heath Ledger's performance was just simply amazing. He brought a personality and bone chilling cold ruthlessness yet compelling take of a villain that made me hate him yet understand why Joker acts the way he does in order to get his way. Heath Ledger will be missed by me. This role alone will always make him remembered for generations to come.Christian Bale as Batman is my Batman out of all the characters who have played him. He really shows the problems Batman has to confront both as billionaire Bruce Wayne and protecting Gotham at night as Batman. In this movie you really see him struggle with internal conflicts and he almost goes over the edge yet Bale gives Batman enough soul to keep him going and to carry on despite all the pain and suffering Batman endures.I want to also give props to the supporting casts and say that I loved the actor's performance who played Harvey Dent. Aaron Eckhart was superb in this role as he will be a great villain for the next movie. Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain, and Gary Oldman all bring their roles to life as Lucius Fox, Alfred, and Commissioner Gordan. I did however miss Katie Holmes take on Rachael Dawes but her portrayal by the beautiful Maggie Gyllenhaal was marvelous still.Finally Christopher Nolan has raised the bar for directing as at first I thought nobody would come close to Tim Burton's classic take of the first Batman. Nolan has done that and in my mind rescued Batman from certain death at the movie theater. He brings out all the emotions one can from the dark streets of a crime filled Gotham night to the inner struggle the characters face every day just like ordinary people face. I simply can't say enough about the quality this man has brought to Batman movies and out of everybody he is most deserving of any and all awards associated with this movie.Go see it, its worth the hype it received and even people who hate these types of movies will like them.

The moral choices along with Batmans personal struggles all draw you in.  The tone of the movie is dark and it hardly ever comes out of that even in the end but there is a little light.  I was never a big fan of Heath Ledger or his movies but I have to say I think now I am gonna miss him.  I really had no idea of how talented he really was until I got to the end of the movie and said ""Wow"".  Though he is not even recognizable I found the Joker to be one of the best played out characters of all time. I did notice that at certain moments though intentional or not when Batman was not Bruce Wayne he talked in this weird throaty voice which I guess might of been intentional but sounded weird.  The movie left me a lot of room to really think about Batmans struggle and the way he handles himself in those situations to either be a hero or slowly turn to being a villain.  The choices and decisions that are before Batman presented by the Joker are just so well played and so well thought out the eventual solutions Batman takes and the results all play nicely together.  I did like the fact this movie did not have a whole bunch of CG and everything revolved more around the human element and the reasoning of human nature.  Don't get me wrong CG is not bad but this movie had a lot more going for it than pretty effects.  I do wish Two Face had a bigger role and I figured when I heard certain phrases close to the beginning of the movie I figured they would repeat later as some sort of lesson or something.  I found the ending to be relatively weak and kinda came to a quick end after yet another moral choice brought by Two Face.

659606,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B00005JPY0,J. SHARP,"[1, 2]","You've heard it all. Dark. Brooding. Expansive. Heath Ledger rocks the house. Gary Oldman rules as a good guy for once. Aaron Eckhart is surprisingly competent.This is an impressive movie. It will have a lasting effect on you, trust me. It's extremely ambitious in both its visual and thematic conception. It hits the target on the former. It has qualified successes in the latter.But, again, you've heard all the raves. Why am I giving it four stars?Three reasons, and they all involve Batman himself. All are character issues and two figure significantly in the plot.First of all, Batman seems to exist in the story mainly as a contrived counterpoint to The Joker. He's not developed much and he's not really that important to the movie if you step back and break it down. Eckhart's Harvey Dent is.**SPOILERS** (For the twenty-three of you who haven't seen it.)Second, he faces a false dilemma in this movie that drove me nuts as I watched him grapple with it. Essentially, The Joker announces that he will start killing people until Batman reveals himself. Batman/Bruce Wayne agonizes over this. ""It's all my fault! People are dying because of me! He won't stop until I turn myself in!"" He then shuts down the Batcave and destroys all his Batstuff.Huh? Dude, the Joker was killing people BEFORE he made this little ultimatum. He will go on killing AFTER you turn yourself in. What's to agonize about? He's the bad guy, not you. Go catch him. Problem solved.I hated that gimmick and rolled my eyes as it played out. I didn't believe a minute of it. The only possible explanation I can come up with was that he was looking for an excuse to ""retire"" and The Joker gave him one. Like he'd calmly ride off into the sunset with Rachel Dawes as the Joker took over the city? Right. That ended up being a moot point, anyway.

To me that was the kicker, I thought Heaths Joker was great (but maybe overhyped by fans and critics due to the tragedy that befell him, after all very few will speak ill of the dead) but, Jack's Joker carried the movie, he was stellar and he was as smart or smarter than batman. Thats always been the kicker for Batmans and the Characters, they are often ordinary people, few powers, but the villians are maniacal (with both Heath and Jack do fantastic), and intellictual, which come out in the writing of the Joker but I did not see in Heath's portrayal. So to me this movie is so much more complete, however has two flaws, 1. I am disappointed that anyone states Heath is better than Jack, and 2.

659609,AWQO3BM1FAOZA,B00005JPY0,"J Smith ""J""","[4, 11]","There is no doubt that Dark Knight is well written and features an incredible performance from Ledger.The underlying story is dull. The amount of crime in one city is far fetched. The characters endure forever as with almost every other comic. The idea that Batman simply doesn't have the gull or the anger to just kill the Joker seems ridiculous. How many die so that Batman can live by his ""code""? Also, the idea that no one knows that all that high tech equipment Batman uses could only be produced by the richest man in town, also seems absurd. But as with almost all science fiction, we take it for what it is: glimpses of reality disguised in fantasy.It takes liberties from the original comic, but we don't really mind because it sets in a seemingly more realistic approach instead of relying on a vat of acid, for instance. Clearly, there is still a sense of whimsy without taking from the comic completely. Overall it is dark and grimacing, as it should be. This includes the headache waiting for you from the deep looming ""music"" that instills a sense of distress in the viewer. (a reason I wish I'd waited and seen it at home)Dark Knight raises deep morally rooted questions for which it gives some insight but lets you decide. It leads us through disconcerting circumstances that are no doubt amplified to shine a light to the very essence of our being. Through the darkness there is a morbid bit of comedy which goes right back to mimicking the balance that is an unavoidable part of reality. It plays with themes of balance, fate, fear, chaos, and desire. The way it was written toys with us so cleverly.The stunts are inconsequential in comparison with the performances and writing. However, the acting of Bale and Gyllenhaal make them seem as though they simply worked out okay for the movie but are not perfect. Bale doesn't show us the remorse or the loneliness when the time comes for him to do so.Is it worth seeing in the theater? I would say no, because most of the excitement comes in the dialogue which is truly masterful.

Ledger was so good, that I did not even recognize him in the trailer.  Bale is quite possibly the best Bruce/Batman ever on the big screen.  He really pulls you into his character, and differentiates Batman with a growling almost feral demeanor.  The writing was good enough that the movie did not have to depend on special effects.  Why then the 4 stars?  I think this was a horrible transfer to blu ray.In the opening scene it is full screen, and after the robbery scene, we get the black bars at the top and bottom.  This switches back and forth several times throughout the movie!  And it is very annoying.  I kept trying to play with my buttons on my remote to fix it, and to no avail.  IMO, if you are going to show something in one format, stick with it throughout the movie!! Do not keep flipping back and forth.  Yes the picture looks very sharp and crisp, but it drove me nuts when they kept switching the format in the movie.  Sad thing is that this is not even Bale at his best though.

I know the special features on the blu ray are very lacking but it doesn't take away from this special feature.If you are as interested in the villains Batman has as much as I am, you will know they are a central part of how successful The Dark Knight has become since his creation over 70 years ago.In ""Batman Unmasked: The Psychology of the Dark Knight"" different former editors and writers for DC Comics as well as several psychologists and private investigators link the connection between Batman's most famous villains and real life criminals such as Jeffrey Dahmer, the Una bomber, and many more. The Joker and The Riddler are some of the most interesting villains they discuss. Heath Ledger's absolutely amazing performance as The Joker reminds us how amazingly cynical the character is. This kind of behavior is connected to some other horrible criminals in real life history and how their behavior is similar to the Joker's, who has no remorse for wrongdoings.Batman is very interestingly compared to Theodore Roosevelt who had a similar life style to that of Bruce Wayne. Roosevelt's wife and mother both died on the same day and shortly after he went out in the streets as what the documentary stated as sort of a night patrol. His father was also a very caring man and is compared to Thomas Wayne.I was really blown away by this special feature so I went ahead and reviewed it so nobody would overlook it and leave it to the side.

659615,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B00005JPY0,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[1, 3]","""The Dark Knight"" is an archetypal story of a Hero on a Quest to save the kingdom and marry the princess. He encounters obstacles along the way but has the guidance, in this story, of two Wise Old Men.Carl Jung named the archetypes to show the universal nature of the collective unconscious that we all share. ""The Dark Knight"" is the ongoing story of one Hero--Bruce Wayne who becomes Batman, a supernatural force who combats the evil destroying Gotham City. According to archetypes, the Hero finally overcomes the evil, saves the kingdom, and marries the princess. This marriage is explicitly part of this story. However, Rachal wisely understands that there will NEVER be a time when Batman is not needed. Evil is inherent in human nature.The human Hero is Harvey Dent, the district attorney, who battles evil through the legal arm of the law, unlike Batman who uses ""supernatural"" powers and even breaks the law. Although the two don't work together, they do respect what the other does.On the other hand, the Wise Old Men educate and influence Batman/Bruce. Michael Caine (looking more handsome than in his youth) explains that sometimes evil doesn't have a cause or a reason--it just is. He tells a story of his youth in which a villain is caught. He and his men had to burn down a forest to capture him. Does it take extreme measures to control evil? Morgan Freeman tells Bruce that he will not be part of illegal operations. He is the morality factor.Of course, there's Heath Ledger, who gives an award-winning performance as the Joker, the wild card, the chaos factor. Only an excellent actor can move through heavy make-up to use facial expressions, hair, body language to personify the purity of evil, or chaos, as he explains it.""The Dark Knight"" far exceeds its reputation in illustrating a morality play through archetypes. Those who don't quite see how Harvey Dent was utterly changed fail to recognize that he was literally stripped of half of his face value, exposing raw nerves and incredible pain. The question is not What are good and evil, but how they are used--to what end, for what purpose? Relative values or eternal? The purity of archetypes or the blurred lines of actual life? It is definitely fodder for debate.",4,Better than I expected,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,2240,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'archetypal', 'story', 'Hero', 'Quest', 'save', 'kingdom', 'marry', 'princess', 'obstacles', 'way', 'guidance', 'story', 'two', 'Wise', 'Old', 'Men.Carl', 'Jung', 'named', 'archetypes', 'show', 'universal', 'nature', 'collective', 'unconscious', 'share', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'ongoing', 'story', 'one', 'Hero', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'who', 'Batman', 'supernatural', 'force', 'who', 'evil', 'destroying', 'Gotham', 'City', 'According', 'archetypes', 'Hero', 'finally', 'evil', 'kingdom', 'princess', 'marriage', 'explicitly', 'part', 'story', 'However', 'Rachal', 'wisely', 'will', 'NEVER', 'be', 'time', 'when', 'Batman', 'not', 'needed', 'Evil', 'inherent', 'human', 'nature.The', 'human', 'Hero', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'district', 'attorney', 'who', 'legal', 'arm', 'law', 'Batman', 'who', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'even', 'law', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'together', 'do', 'respect', 'what', 'other', 'does.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Wise', 'Old', 'Men', 'educate', 'influence', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'looking', 'more', 'handsome', 'youth', 'sometimes', 'evil', ""n't"", 'have', 'cause', 'reason', 'just', 'story', 'youth', 'villain', 'caught', 'men', 'had', 'burn', 'down', 'forest', 'capture', 'take', 'extreme', 'measures', 'control', 'evil', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Bruce', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'part', 'illegal', 'operations', 'morality', 'factor.Of', 'course', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'who', 'award-winning', 'performance', 'Joker', 'wild', 'card', 'chaos', 'factor', 'Only', 'excellent', 'actor', 'can', 'move', 'heavy', 'make-up', 'use', 'facial', 'expressions', 'hair', 'body', 'language', 'personify', 'purity', 'evil', 'chaos', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'far', 'reputation', 'illustrating', 'morality', 'play', 'archetypes', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'how', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'was', 'utterly', 'changed', 'fail', 'recognize', 'was', 'literally', 'stripped', 'half', 'face', 'value', 'exposing', 'raw', 'nerves', 'incredible', 'pain', 'question', 'not', 'What', 'are', 'good', 'evil', 'how', 'are', 'used', 'what', 'end', 'what', 'purpose', 'Relative', 'values', 'eternal', 'purity', 'archetypes', 'blurred', 'lines', 'actual', 'life', 'definitely', 'fodder', 'debate']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659616,A2E1QTFS01GT4P,B00005JPY0,"J. Urban ""U2fan4ever76""","[2, 4]","The Dark Knight is proof positive that a great movie can be made based off of comic book source material. Other movies (Iron Man, X-Men, Spiderman, etc.) have come close to depicting utterly ridiculous (in the context of the real world) characters as characters that actually become believable due to the settings and character development. It's no small feat making a character that dresses up like a bat believable or the world he inhabits, but Christopher Nolan (and his brother) succeed. Their first Batman movie (Batman Begins) was the shot in the arm for re-imaging a movie franchise. The Dark Knight continues in that tradition and ups the ante ten-fold.All of the praise and accolades it has been receiving are all on point and not overblown. I went into it with high expectations and left feeling like all were met. Not many movies have had that success (i.e. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, for one). The movie starts with a bang (literally) and never lets up with the action set pieces, the top-notch acting and story, and great musical score (by the always great Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard).In short, the movie opens with a bank robbery that leads to the reveal of the Joker and his interest in filling the void of leadership of the criminal element of Gotham. Heath Ledger is completely absorbed into the makeup and character to where you have to shake your head to realize it really is Ledger. (His voice and mannerisms are all Joker.) He did an absolute job and I will be shocked if he isn't nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Jack Nicholson defined the Joker in the late `80's. Ledger has defined the Joker for the present and future. THIS is the Joker from the comics. He is a self-indulgent, unethical, immoral maniac who has no real goal other than, to quote the movie, ""Watch the world burn."" This type of villain forces Bruce Wayne/Batman into having to re-evaluate his own code as the Joker will do anything to wreak utter havoc on Gotham. Will Batman be able to do everything possible (and then some) to counter the Joker? This was brought up in Batman Begins with the villain Ras Al Ghultelling Bruce Wayne literally that. It was a question of how far was the hero willing to go.The movie is rather long (2hrs and 20+ minutes) and at times quite violent. This is clearly not a kids' movie and I have to say I am bothered by how many parents I saw bring little kids (a lot younger than 13) into the movie. There are some scenes of violence and cruelty that, frankly, are going to scare the heck out of the kids and the parents bringing real young children to this should be ashamed. Find a babysitter or don't complain about a psychiatrist's bill later in life!SPOILERS START:Perhaps the best kept secret for the audience (unless you are a super-fan who read all the websites) was the origin of Two-Face. The end result was gruesome and a little over-the-top. For a minute, I forgot who the director was, as I had to swear it was Sam Raimi. That was one of two gripes I had with the movie. The other being, Rachel Dawes character is so one-dimensional, that I hardly cared when she met her fate. The subsequent events also caused me to feel a bit conflicted as to the resolution an ultimate ending of the movie.END OF SPOILERS:If you see one movie this summer (not to sound like a movie tagline), see The Dark Knight. It is a crime drama, not unlike a combination of The Godfather and Heat, with the Caped Crusader up against some overwhelming odds. The story, acting, music, and special effects are all top-notch (Chicago makes a great setting for Gotham). This is the Dark Knight as he was intended to be and I can only hope that there is a third one, as good as this one and Batman Begins.",5,"The Best Batman Movie, But Parents, Don't Bring Your Little Kids To It",1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,3746,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'proof', 'positive', 'great', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'source', 'material', 'Other', 'movies', 'Iron', 'Man', 'X-Men', 'Spiderman', 'etc', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'depicting', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'context', 'real', 'world', 'characters', 'characters', 'actually', 'become', 'believable', 'due', 'settings', 'character', 'development', 'small', 'feat', 'making', 'character', 'up', 'bat', 'believable', 'world', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'brother', 'succeed', 'first', 'Batman', 'movie', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'shot', 'arm', 're-imaging', 'movie', 'franchise', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'tradition', 'ups', 'ante', 'ten-fold.All', 'praise', 'been', 'receiving', 'are', 'point', 'not', 'overblown', 'went', 'high', 'expectations', 'left', 'feeling', 'were', 'met', 'Not', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'success', 'i.e', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'one', 'movie', 'bang', 'literally', 'never', 'up', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'story', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'always', 'great', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', '.In', 'short', 'movie', 'bank', 'robbery', 'reveal', 'Joker', 'interest', 'filling', 'void', 'leadership', 'criminal', 'element', 'Gotham', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'makeup', 'character', 'where', 'have', 'shake', 'head', 'realize', 'really', 'Ledger', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'Joker', 'did', 'absolute', 'job', 'will', 'be', 'shocked', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'defined', 'Joker', 'late', '80', 'Ledger', 'defined', 'Joker', 'present', 'future', 'THIS', 'Joker', 'comics', 'self-indulgent', 'unethical', 'immoral', 'maniac', 'who', 'real', 'goal', 'other', 'quote', 'movie', 'Watch', 'world', 'burn', 'type', 'villain', 'forces', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'having', 're-evaluate', 'own', 'code', 'Joker', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'wreak', 'utter', 'havoc', 'Gotham', 'Will', 'Batman', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'everything', 'possible', 'then', 'counter', 'Joker', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'villain', 'Ras', 'Al', 'Ghultelling', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'literally', 'was', 'question', 'how', 'far', 'was', 'hero', 'willing', 'go.The', 'movie', 'rather', 'long', '2hrs', '20+', 'minutes', 'times', 'quite', 'violent', 'clearly', 'not', 'kids', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'bothered', 'how', 'many', 'parents', 'saw', 'bring', 'little', 'kids', 'lot', 'younger', '13', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'violence', 'cruelty', 'frankly', 'are', 'going', 'scare', 'heck', 'kids', 'parents', 'bringing', 'real', 'young', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'Find', 'babysitter', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'psychiatrist', 'bill', 'later', 'life', 'SPOILERS', 'START', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'kept', 'secret', 'audience', 'are', 'super-fan', 'who', 'read', 'websites', 'was', 'origin', 'Two-Face', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'gruesome', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'minute', 'forgot', 'who', 'director', 'was', 'had', 'swear', 'was', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'gripes', 'had', 'movie', 'other', 'being', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'character', 'so', 'one-dimensional', 'hardly', 'cared', 'when', 'met', 'fate', 'subsequent', 'events', 'also', 'caused', 'feel', 'bit', 'conflicted', 'resolution', 'ultimate', 'ending', 'movie.END', 'SPOILERS', 'see', 'one', 'movie', 'summer', 'not', 'sound', 'movie', 'tagline', 'see', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'crime', 'drama', 'not', 'combination', 'Godfather', 'Heat', 'Caped', 'Crusader', 'up', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'story', 'acting', 'music', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Chicago', 'great', 'setting', 'Gotham', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'third', 'one', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'Batman', 'Begins']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659617,A1ZXYVYPOEDGTV,B00005JPY0,Jus B. Cuz,"[1, 1]","Chris Nolan delivers a perfect follow-up to ""Batman Begins."" We last saw Batman handed a Joker card from then, Lt. Gordon in the closing scene in the first of the trilogy, Batman Saga. To open ""The Dark Knight"" with the Joker's roots as a common criminal, with psychotic intentions, was intense. No less important than Bruce Wayne's decent into the role of the Batman, out of the pain and rage of witnessing his parents murders as a youth in the prior film.Ledger's performance as the Joker was brilliant! He is sullen, mad and drunk by the potential to bring total chaos to Gotham City. Truly sad that we lost him to substance abuse and future roles on the big screen. As the Joker unwinds his seemingly random acts of disruption to the city, the usual suspects of criminal warlord corruption are in scatter due to Batman's grip. Visions of opportunity, the Joker squeezes out the confused standards. His psychosis deepens, yet he has goals and monumental methods. Ledger offers us insight into the dark corners of the mentally disturbed mind. While he shows some underlying humor, he is spot-on as to a personality unchecked, sick and in need of those padded rooms.To try to deal with this mental monster, Bruce realizes what he must allow Batman to become. Drive himself deeper into his own darkest places he resides. The very places that he fears most that conjured the Batman initially. Fully crossing the line himself, Batman, trained by the ""The League of Shadows"", is now the anti-hero. Sought by the law too, Batman reaches down to the Jokers' level and plays by his rules, one who has no rules.In the middle of the struggle, is both Rachel Dawes, Bruces' lifelong friend and love, and Harvey Dent. Gotham's ""White Knight."" Dent, who had rounded up most of the scum Gotham spit out, did so without a cape or cowl. Batman considers folding the cape for good as he believes in Dent's honor. But this is a very dark and gritty film from the Frank Miller storyline. Nothing good lasts forever or for long.Once the Joker plays his cards on Dent, the bet is ""Two-Face."" Telling lies about his facial scars, the Joker is believable about every lie. Seemingly innocent as he claims, ""just a dog chasing cars"", he quickly turns Dent/Two-Face against all he once stood for. Loosing Rachael, both Dent and Bruce have lost love, forever. The Joker's not so planed, plans, work to his advantage. In the ultimate and proverbial battle of good over evil, the Joker and Batman duel using Gotham and it's citizens as weapons.Now Commissioner Gordon, Gary Oldman continues to maintain his belief that Batman is attempting to bring justice to Gotham. Even if the means are cruel and punishing. Oldman is a fantastic actor with a career of award winning performances! He keeps Commissioner Gordon humble, just, honorable and quirky. Most of all, faithful to the character in true form. An old fashioned cop with values and principals, he is a family man first and foremost. Uniquely acted out in the final scenes as the three, Gordon, Dent and Batman face off with a loaded gun pointed at his family.In this showdown, the revelation of what is about to transpire is like the ""gunfight at the O.K. Coral."" Of course Batman cannot be hurt via bullet, he takes the shot from Dent. Then the gun turns to Gordon's son. Batman leaps into action one last time and both he and Dent fall to Dents' death. With Gordon's son watching, Batman makes his final moral choice. So as to not allow the scum back onto Gotham's streets, letting Dent's ""Two-Face"" half come to light, both Bruce and Batman decide to become the hunted. He can be the ""bad guy"" for now. Because he and Gordon know Batman stand for something greater. Morality, ethical values and a stance for justice. For the time being, Gotham will see Batman as the ""Ultimate Outsider.""I understand that many didn't appreciate the direction that Chris Nolan took the Batman and Joker characters. Saying they were too dark and disconnected. I disagree.  I rather like the Frank Miller stories. A darker Batman, a Dark Knight is exactly what we were ready for. The time for the campy versions had been done time and again. This is a grown-up Batman. A man with serious, unresolved issues, who seeks shelter and comfort under a cowl. He has the wealth to hide himself away and use it to do what the present law force cannot or will not. The Joker symbolized, with stylized elegance, how little attention is paid to mentally disturbed. Given the slimmest opportunity, a patient slips out of Ayrkham and creates a monster of devastating proportions. An equally devastating monster under the guise of a Bat is born to reel him in. Maybe some felt uncomfortable with this film because it wasn't ""comic-booky"" enough.Sure, there were many plot loop-holes and storyline drop offs. Much was left to the imagination and strictly movie magic. An adaptation based on some hard-core Dark Knight graphic novels that were best sellers! By far, these first two films (and The Dark Knight Rises) are the best trilogy of any Superhero or anti-hero, hands down! Be it from DC or Marvel. I think those who give this film 5 Stars DID get it!",5,The Dark Knight-The Ultimate Outsider...,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,5153,"['Chris', 'Nolan', 'perfect', 'follow-up', 'Batman', 'Begins',

659618,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JPY0,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 2]","Three years ago, director Christopher Nolan (""The Prestige"") successfully resurrected the `Batman' franchise after its unfortunate demise at the hands of Joel Schumacher (""Batman Forever"" & ""Batman & Robin""). Nolan's vision for Gotham City's dark hero was grounded in a more realistic world than the previous four movies had been, gone was the camp and unnecessary nipples on the batsuit from Schumacher's version, and in was an authentic, true to the comic book interpretation of the brooding hero, complete with darker villains, much more realistic weapons and gadgets, and some of the best acting and storytelling of any of the Bat's incarnations this side of its comic book origins. After ""Batman Begins"" sustained a solid run at the box office and on DVD, fans eagerly awaited to see just what this new franchise would do with the story that was setup in the final moments of `Begins' when Lt. Gordon showed Batman the Joker card. Now, here we are in 2008, and the anxiously anticipated sequel has been released and let me tell you ""The Dark Knight"" definitely delivers, successfully building upon the outstanding groundwork that had been laid by ""Batman Begins"" and going beyond my own, and many others, expectations to create an awesome experience at the movies.""The Dark Knight"" picks up sometime after the events depicted in the previous film, as Batman (Christian Bale) is continuing his crusade to take back Gotham City from the evil, corrupt men that have held sway over it for so long. Assisting Batman in his fight for justice are his trusted allies Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), his former love and Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhall), his butler Alfred (Michael Caine), his tech supplier Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and a newly appointed District Attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). With as much help and support as Batman is getting in his quest, it would seem that victory over the forces of darkness may actually be possible; however, a new evil is emerging in the form of the maniacal Joker (Heath Ledger). A twisted man with the simplest of intentions, to plunge Gotham City into complete and utter chaos, and God be with anyone that gets in his way. As this new threat tests the limits of not only Batman, but the very citizens of Gotham City, it seems that perhaps evil may finally have the last laugh.Wow. ""The Dark Knight"" is one of the best comic book inspired movies ever put in front of a camera; in fact calling it a comic book movie is almost inaccurate as this movie has more in common with a crime thriller than your standard comic book film. Sure, the movie features characters that are somewhat larger than life, and the main character dresses himself up in a batsuit; but the storytelling is done in such a realistic fashion that it allows the movie to transcend the barriers that typically surround the traditional comic book movie. Gaining respect and acclaim from critics all throughout Hollywood, a new concept for most comic book inspired creations, ""The Dark Knight"" may possibly be the first of its kind to be viewed more as a respected mainstream action/drama than just another comic book movie.The screenplay for ""The Dark Knight"" as crafted by director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, based on a story by Christopher and David S. Goyer (writer of the `Blade' franchise), is an excellent follow-up to the terrific work this team of talented individuals had done with ""Batman Begins"". The story is so full of intensity, twists and turns, and a hefty dose of the unexpected, that you really need to see the movie more than once in order to fully appreciate all of the various elements that comprise this entertaining slice of pop culture. The story for ""Batman Begins"" was focused primarily on the origin of Batman and his initial appearances in Gotham City, with ""The Dark Knight"" the story focuses much more on the escalation of evil around the city that has been inadvertently caused by Batman's continuing quest for justice. This shift in focus allows the movie to become much darker than the previous one, and more of a character study as each of the characters, primarily the hero, are forced to take a good look at themselves and what his or her actions may be having on the increased problems plaguing the city, and whether their contributions are worth the price or not.The talented cast assembled for this movie is such an incredible ensemble of Hollywood's A-list that it's amazing the story was capable of giving the appropriate amount of attention to them all without some getting lost in the shuffle. Christian Bale delivers what is easily the best portrayal of the duality of Bruce Wayne/Batman, expertly playing the opposing nature the character has with his playboy lifestyle as Bruce Wayne, compared to the intensity and violence that consumes his life as the Batman. Matching wits with Batman this time around is the maniacal Joker, played to cackling perfection by the late Heath Ledger (""A Knight's Tale""). Heath's performance as the Joker is by far the definitive version of the character outside of the comic books, making all others that have played him pale in comparison. From every facial tick, to the trademark laugh, to his odd pattern of speech, everything about this character is spot on; and Heath has masterfully created one of the most iconic villainous performances in modern cinema, that it may even rival Anthony Hopkin's chilling creation of Hannibal Lecter in ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Supporting the two lead actors, if you can truly call them that, as the story gives equal time to almost every one of the primary characters, are returning cast members Gary Oldman, who gets to do so much more with Jim Gordon than he was able to in ""Batman Begins"", Michael Caine (""Secondhand Lions"") as trusted butler Alfred, who provides the unwavering support that Batman needs in his continuing war on crime, and Morgan Freeman returning as Lucius Fox, the man that provides all the necessary technology that Batman needs to take back the streets of Gotham City. Joining the series for the first time is actor Aaron Eckhart (""No Reservations"") as Harvey Dent, a man who has a thirst for justice almost as intense as Batman's, although his methods are more by the book than the Bat's; and actress Maggie Gyllenhall (""World Trade Center"") replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, a former love of Bruce Wayne's and assistant D.A. to Harvey Dent. This time Rachel is given much more screen time, and a more fleshed out story than she previously had in ""Batman Begins"", which is probably a testament to Maggie Gyllenhall being a somewhat better actress than Katie Holmes, not to mention she doesn't come with the baggage that is Tom Cruise.""The Dark Knight"" is, as I said earlier, one of the best comic book adaptations, if not the best (in my opinion), and may also be viewed as more of a crime thriller than a comic book movie. Comprised of intense storytelling (much more so than any of its predecessors), excellent acting, white knuckle action sequences, and numerous twists, turns, and surprises that will leave you begging for more as the credits begin to roll.""The Dark Knight"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",5,"Out of the Darkness, Comes the Knight...",1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,7229,"['Three', 'years',

659619,A26X2TG93OTXVU,B00005JPY0,Justin Heath,"[641, 764]","Christopher Nolan has a vision. And whether you agree with it or not, he undeniably completes it in ""The Dark Knight""--a vicious, engrossing, overwhelming, intelligent event- film that re-defines 'comic-book-flicks'. In Nolan's grim, dark-depiction of Gotham-City (the crime-ridden hell protected by legendary superhero Batman), the director strives to make everything real (something he began in the well-received ""Batman Begins""). He makes it plausible, possible. And yet there's more to it: just as 'Begins' was a dissection of myth, the nature of symbols and heroes, 'Knight' is the escalation of that notion. It's a biblical- confrontation of 'good-and-evil', yet as 'good-and-evil' really exist: a conflict of ideals, something that can't be purely-defined but that is relative to a viewpoint. In Nolan's world, the line of villainy and heroism isn't crossed... it's non-existent. The bad-guys don't see themselves as bad-guys, and as such something so unnervingly-real comes across it might fly past some people's minds (no insult to anybody, it's just common that people don't look deep into 'popcorn-flicks'): the battle is a complete ambiguity.The film runs at nearly 2.5-hours, yet never ceases to lose interest or momentum. It doesn't waste a scene or moment; every event is utilized and necessary. 'The Dark Knight' tells a story worth telling and it takes the proper amount of time to tell it. Action-sequences are frantic, old-school, eye-grabbing stunts (vastly superior to 'Begins') and in their chaotic intensity we see that they serve purpose to the story, yet more interesting are not played for pure entertainment-value: we are meant to watch, petrified, simply hoping that the outcome will go the hero's way. Attention is never lost because we are immersed in a breathtaking, almost completely-unpredictable story (it packs many a shock), that makes us think and more importantly gains our emotional-investment. We come to care for the characters, because they are believable, developed, and personified fully.Everyone has great-chemistry together. Maggie Gyllenhal is a more mature Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes. Morgan Freeman provides his authoritative presence to the role of bad- gadget-inventor/Wayne-Enterprise CEO Lucius Fox, and under anyone else's portrayal, the part would be less-memorable. Gary Oldman underplays his world-wearied lawman with such honest-nobility, you never feel for a second any of its forced-acting. The irreplaceable Michael Caine makes a gentle, reassuring, father-like presence as Alfred, and the movie would surely fail without his strong-presence and interjected-moments of light-humor.And while everyone (rightfully) pours the praise unto Bale and Ledger, I think most are glancing-over Knight's breakout-performance. As Harvey Dent, Aaron Eckhart does more than hold himself in the company of such a renowned-cast. He makes his presence known, whether he's playing on the easy-going charisma of Gotham's 'White-Knight' or the broken and damaged, twisted-soul of Two-Face. He achieves a full-impact with the tragedy that comes unto his character, and so closely connects with Dent, that he makes his pain tangible for us: we sympathize even as we become terrified. He captures both facets of each personality flawlessly.Now, some people cite that 'Knight' has a potential fatal-flaw in the supposedly wooden- acting of Christian Bale. Admittedly, his development is not as grand as in 'Begins' (yet that film gave us such a good psychoanalysis of Wayne, we hardly need more), yet what Bale pulls off is admirable. Wayne is not an eccentric personality. He is a disillusioned man who can hardly find any joy in having no family, giving up his love-interest and spending his life fighting a battle that may never end. He's dark and conflicted, and Bale plays up on that brooding-mood by making Wayne look as though a thousand dark-things were on his mind. He's not wooden...he's a humorless, quiet individual. Even when Wayne is acting as a frivolous playboy for the public, every now and then Bale offers us a powerful glance that reminds us its all a faade; that deep down, something more disturbed irks him. Occasionally he offers a broken-smile when exchanging banter with Alfred, letting us know that beyond the dour depression of the Caped-Crusader lies a damaged human-being. It is only in the guise of a growling masked-man, that he can unleash his true, ferocious personality.Finally, who could forget Heath Ledger. Now, when he was first-announced for the part, I was (along with many other people) asking myself: ""Why?"". Mr. Ledger had proved with 'Brokeback Mountain' he could deliver a potent performance. But he hadn't before. It is only, after seeing this film, that I know the answer to 'why?': I see the significance of his loss.When Heath appears in this movie, he is completely unrecognizable. His voice is distinctly-altered; a near-whiny, pedophile-like tone that sends shivers down the spine. His face is completely splattered with makeup that renders him both freakishly-nightmarish and strangely-funny. And when you see him, you don't think it's him. In this, his final performance, Ledger proved he was a chameleon. His two iconic performances in this, and 'Brokeback', could not be more different. I am convinced he could have been anything in his career. He commits so intensely to character that the line of actor/portrayal dies. His every tick and gesture only further-enhances his character. Heath never hams the role up or goes for something cheap: he delivers a fully-immersed display of psychotic madness...or do we just label him that to feel safer? The movie writes the character brilliantly; blending terrifying truth into his every social-accusation, and making us question why we laugh at his sick-jokes.'The Dark Knight' has had an incredible-amount of hype running for it, from the get-go, mounting ever-higher, until Heath Ledger's too-soon death. And the finished-product does more than exceed all of the near-impossible expectations placed on it. It becomes something much richer than a super-hero-franchise-saga. Christopher Nolan has opened a new door in cinema: allowing action-flicks to become more serious, capable of intelligence. He has transformed this into a piece of artwork, full of beauty, terror, moral-conundrums. This movie has changed things...forever.There's no going back. 10/10",5,The Dark Masterpiece Surpasses the Hype,1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,6398,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'vision', 'agree', 'not',

659622,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B00005JPY0,kaduzy,"[2, 3]","The trick Warner Bros. manages to pull off with this DVD release is to give me as little content as they can possibly get away with and still call this a ""special edition,"" and yet still make me feel as if I got my money's worth as a consumer.  This has literally never happened to me before.  I've written a number of reviews decrying the rampant Hollywood custom of the ol' special-edition ""bait-n-switch"": 1 disc's worth of content spread over two, key features missing, the list goes on and on.There's plenty missing here.  Director's commentary.  Cast interviews.  A memorial of some kind to Heath Ledger.  A movie this epic in scale obviously has much more to it than what is presented here, which means that another even more super special ultra deluxe edition is just waiting to be released sometime far enough into the future that many of us will probably find some thin reason to justify its purchase.  Ordinarily I would be livid about this, but several things mollify me enough to instead sit back and appreciate the product I now have for exactly what it's worth.The first thing is that I always felt this film would be even better if it was rated R.  When another edition is released, I am holding out hope that it will be unrated, and that we'll be privy to the more grisly elements of The Joker's crimes.  For instance, what happened to William Fichtner's gun-toting bank executive after The Joker drove away?  Is it possible that would have been our first glimpse of his infamous ""Joker venom"" had the effects not been too ghastly for a rating of PG-13?Second, this was the best movie of 2008 and one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, period.  I didn't buy it for the extras.  I saw it three times in theaters, twice on opening weekend and once on IMAX.  And in the 36 or so hours since I've owned my copy, I've watched it another 3 times.Third, the extras that ARE present are good enough to distract you from what is NOT.  There's an excellent mini-feature on the creation of The Joker's signature two-note theme (Even knowing that it's an electric cello doesn't remove the tension and anxiety that one sound creates in your spine when you hear it.) and another on how they constructed the Bat-pod and the suit.  The latter feature drew my attention to the fact that this is the first Batman movie I've seen where the suit looked like something a man could actually create for himself (with the right resources) and not just some movie costume.  Every extra has captions, which is a huge deal for me because I've so rarely seen film companies have the foresight to add captions to the special features.There are trailers!  For a trailer junkie like myself, this is a big deal.  The trailers for this movie were terrific, and it's nice to finally see a studio include a great trailer with a great movie.  They even throw in that phenomenal ""Watchmen"" teaser, but unfortunately you can't access it directly; you have to just put the DVD in and let it play before the menu comes on.  There are IMAX-formatted clips of the movie.  They are nice to look at, but the effect is, needless to say, somewhat diminished when you're not watching on a 60-foot screen.And the bestest most hilariously insightfully imaginative wonderful extra of all is the collection of ""Gotham Tonight"" clips.  The fictional show we caught snippets of during the film takes us in real time from the events of Batman Begins to the events of this movie, creating an entire world in the space of forty minutes thanks to savvy writing and some fantastic acting.  Anthony Michael Hall fleshes out his role as the Anderson Cooper-esque reporter Mike Engel, and spends four ""episodes"" interviewing his fellow cast members and commentating on the action.  Seeing so much of him makes it personal and wrenching when he winds up becoming one of The Joker's unwilling victims.  Everyone is in character and the scenes are obviously not improvised, so I can only assume that the Nolan brothers wrote these little vignettes too.  (Great lines include: ""A man with six fingers is strange, Mike.  This is alarming."")  You don't have to be a news junkie -- or even a FAKE news junkie -- to get a kick out of these pieces, but it sure helps.  Everything about them feels authentic, from the scrolling headlines at the bottom of the screen to the cheesy music and the angry pundits.  If you pay attention to every detail, a lot of things are revealed or clarified about the Gotham City that was reinvented for the relaunch of this franchise.  For instance, Alfred is Bruce's legal guardian and at one point, he actually had Bruce declared dead.  Some of what we learn is silly (One of Dent's supporters is working on a musical about his life called ""The White Knight""!) but it also inspires sobering thoughts.  Mike is a harsh critic of Batman, and points out in one interview that Batman could likely be the cause of the escalating violence, as criminals react to him and/or try to top him.  The idea that Batman may be causing the harm he's sworn to put an end to is a very dark thought indeed.Even the packaging on this set won me over.  Most special-editions I've purchased senselessly kill trees with a glossy cardboard slipcover that is EXACTLY THE SAME as the plastic cover underneath it.  Someone at Warner Bros. decided to shake that up a bit.  Compare your two covers when you buy the disc and see for yourself.  It's just nice to know that the $995 million they made off this movie hasn't gone completely to waste.  Plus there's a digital copy of the film so that you can watch it on your iPod at no extra charge, and if you buy it here at Amazon for a limited time they'll lease you the right to watch it on this website for like 6 months, for free.  I don't really see the point of that offer, but whatever -- it's something for ""free"" so I'm not complaining.I'm not complaining about anything related to this movie these days, which is why I've granted a perfect score to an imperfect package for the first time ever.  My only complaints will be if the Oscars don't rightfully recognize this come nomination day.  In fact, there's a thought -- think of this release as your own personal Academy Award screening copy.  It has everything you need to know so that you can nominate it for Best Score, Visual and sound effects, and costumes.  As for the rest of the categories -- well, the movie speaks for itself.  And it speaks loudly enough to cover up any shouting about how disappointing this DVD is.

To give you a context for my remarks, know that I love movies, almost without regard to genre. A good movie stands on its own merits. I liked Batman Begins quite a lot, and I loved Iron Man.What really knocks the wind out of THE DARK KNIGHT is that at 2  hours, it's about 1  hours too long. It's serious all the time but not in a gripping, edge-of-your-seat way. I loved the Operation Skyhook scene and only one other that I can't now recall. The rest was plodding and predictable. Yes, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was inspired, but I think he was on-screen way too much.As always, Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain are wonderful, and I like Gary Oldman, although he's only around briefly. Aaron Eckhart is good as Harvey Dent, but his turn as Two Face was short and confusing. Maggie Gyllenhaal was just blah, and Christian Bale was just there.Maybe I've been spoiled by the wonderfulness that is Iron Man, but THE DARK KNIGHT kept me looking at my watch.",2,A Dark Night For The Dark Knight,1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,1062,"['Based', 'reviews', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'am', 'nearly', 'alone', 'disliking', 'film', 'give', 'context', 'remarks', 'know', 'love', 'movies', 'almost', 'regard', 'genre', 'good', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'liked', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'quite', 'lot', 'loved', 'Iron', 'Man.What', 'really', 'wind', 'THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', '2', 'hours', '1', 'hours', 'too', 'long', 'serious', 'time', 'not', 'gripping', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'way', 'loved', 'Operation', 'Skyhook', 'scene', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'now', 'recall', 'rest', 'was', 'plodding', 'predictable', 'Yes', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'portrayal', 'Joker', 'was', 'inspired', 'think', 'was', 'on-screen', 'way', 'too', 'much.As', 'always', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Michael', 'Cain', 'are', 'wonderful', 'like', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'only', 'around', 'briefly', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'good', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'turn', 'Two', 'Face', 'was', 'short', 'confusing', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'was', 'just', 'blah', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'just', 'there.Maybe', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoiled', 'wonderfulness', 'Iron', 'Man', 'THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'kept', 'looking', 'watch']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659628,A1AKQ1YUS4BT82,B00005JPY0,"Katie Babs ""Katiebabs""","[4, 7]","After seeing The Dark Knight, I left the theater, literally shaking because what I had just witnessed was movie making at its very best. This is how movies should be made. There is enough action, twists and turns that your head just spins. The acting alone should make you sit up and take notice because the actors are no longer just players on a stage, but rather they are the embodiment of the characters they have become.I now finally understand about the three separate movie posters that each show Batman, the Joker and Harvey Dent with half their faces being covered as they hold up something against one side of their face, while the other side has nothing to hide. These are three men with totally separate goals. One is goodness and everything righteous; the other tries to work for good but is caught between two different worlds; the third has no morals or reason for his madness, he just does what he does because he enjoys it. He is like a dog that chases after a car, knowing he will never catch it just because it is fun to do, or so The Joker tries to explain to Harvey his reasons for the chaos and anarchy he causes.The Dark Knight begins where the last movie has left off. If you haven't seen Batman Begins, no worries, because the director, Chris Nolan, has done a wonderful job of catching the audience up to speed. The first 45 minutes or so are a casual build up, and I admit I was a bit antsy during this time because I was expecting mind numbing action and explosions right away. They come later, and when they do, your heart will be beating a mile a minute.Gotham's criminals have pretty much been inactive mainly because of Batman. There are still some petty crime and the Mob are in control to extent, but things are pretty ho-hum in the villain department. But then a man with a maniacal laugh and a face painted haphazardly with clown makeup makes his entrance. Gotham will never be the same.There is a new District Attorney in town and he is Harvey Dent who is a good guy, deep down to his core. Bruce Wayne is not sure about Harvey, in part, because Harvey has stolen away his old love, Rachel Dawes. Harvey is everything Bruce wishes he could be but can't. In order for Bruce to fight crime as Batman, he must do some things that are not very lawful. Bruce has major issues because of his conscience. How far can he go and should go to keep peace and order? Batman is going to have quite the wake up call because The Joker will shake up the order of things in ways you will not see coming.Whereas Harvey is the face of law and order and is willing to go as far as he can to a point, Batman is given an out because he is a vigilante. Others will turn and look the other way if he has to kill or cause his own chaos to save Gotham. But because Batman has a conscience, unlike The Joker, he will not step over that line even if it means saving the most important people in his life that he cares about. The Joker knows Batman's weaknesses and will do his best to cause total and utter meltdown in Gotham, mainly to get Batman to admit that he has a very dark place inside, that he may have to reach down into, thus becoming The Dark Knight.The Dark Knight is a very, very dark picture. There is so much death and destruction, and the funny thing is, The Joker is responsible for the set up, but he places the decisions in everyone else's hands, and not his own. He may be the cause, but he is not the effect. Batman and The Joker are very much like the pieces on a chessboard. Because they are each other's nemesis and essentially equal, they are always at a checkmate. Wherever The Joker goes, Batman will follow and visa versa. The odd man out is Harvey and again The Joker uses one of Harvey's weaknesses to get him to do what he wants. The Joker is that little demon on your shoulder that tells you want you want to hear even though it may be so very wrong.The Dark Knight is not your childhood Batman. Many issues arise where a person's moral being comes into play. Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent are very moral people, but when a man like The Joker comes along, who has no rhyme or reason for the destruction he causes, how can these two men not sink down to his level? That is the main question asked and with the end of The Dark Knight, and future installments of this Batman series, this moral dilemma will be the main focus and a foreshadowing of things to come.Visually, The Dark Knight is perfect, but the most important reason to go see a movie such as this, even if you are not a fan of superheroes or comic book action, is the acting. Forget about Michael Keaton; Christian Bale has really succeeded in this role where Michael hasn't. I had hoped the direction of what Batman has to become would be a darker and more unstable individual, and Christian has tapped into Batman's psyche wonderfully. Aaron Eckhart almost took over this movie with his portrayal of Harvey Dent. He even outshined Christian in a few scenes.Last but not least, and I purposely saved the best for last is Heath Ledger. What an incredible way to leave this Earth and on such a high note. I never really appreciated Heath's acting until Brokeback Mountain. I thought he was just another pretty boy actor. I was very much mistaken. If you put all of Heath's scenes together as the Joker, his total on screen running time is about thirty minutes. But those thirty minutes show a true master at work. So many actresses and actors don't have the skill or the inclination to stretch their abilities to the maximum in their work. There are a very select few who vanish as that individual we come to know outside of their professional capacity. They become their character to the point that they disappear in that role. Heath has done so with The Joker. Take the homicidal tendencies of Alex from A Clockwork Orange, with a smidgen of Dr. Hannibal Lector's intuitiveness from Silence of the Lambs, and the face of Gwynplaine from The Man Who Laughs, and you have Ledger's Joker.I could go on with the praise about Heath Ledger's acting mainly because of the tragedy of his death, but quite honestly, The Dark Knight is a group effort with the three men of, Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger. I have only touched upon a small part of why The Dark Knight is such a wonderful viewing experience. Some may this movie success lies because of the skills of director and his players. Perhaps it is the hardcore fans, or it may possibly be the death of an actor who died so young.I say this is a fine movie by people who know what they are doing. It is refreshing to know that there are still professionals in the movie industry that want to give the public quality entertainment, and The Dark Knight is such a movie.Katiebabs",5,"Dark, Visual and

659630,ATKQLQ3NLFW1H,B00005JPY0,Kay,"[0, 1]","I won't comment on the format because I saw this movie in theaters and haven't bought it yet. But don't worry; even though it's been months, I haven't forgotten a single thing about it. It's one of those movies that sticks in your head.When Heath Ledger died and his last movie, this one, received a huge amount of attention I figured that his death was being used to create hype for the film and I thought it was pretty low of all involved. Now I think it's an awful pitty he wasn't around for it's release. He would have had a right to be proud.Honestly, I haven't seen most of Ledger's movies, only a few(including A Knight's Tale which I really liked) so I didn't realize he was such an amazing actor and wasn't expecting him to totally re-invent the Joker rather than reprise Jack Nicholson's role(the Joker's origin is never made clear here but, obviously, it's not the same as from the comics, various series' or the original Batman movie). His portrayal is completely original and different but so right for the character!But Heath Ledger's performance is only one reason why The Dark Knight was so fantastic. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are back, of course(Katie Holmes is barely missed), and then there's Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face(also re-invented and brilliantly;Tommy Lee Jones was awful as Two-Face in Batman Forever. Still, to be fair, Jim Carey was worse as Riddler) and a whole host of other actors that I can't even begin to name who give this movie amazing depth. Also, another thing that sets The Dark Knight apart from most other superhero movies, and even most fiction, is the smooth way everything flows and seems so easy to believe. With this movie characters that some of us have known forever came alive like never before. The characters have completely overshadowed their origins.The tragedy here manages not to bog down the story which was surprisingly steady and consistent, and the Joker is funny in a sick kind of way. Also, in contrast, there is a certain ironic optimism toward humanity that kind of lightens the mood (the convicts vs. the citizens part for instance). And still they managed to pose some interesting questions concerning Batman's morality, sense of justice, and the possible overall impact of his very existence(batmen with machine guns, anyone?).It's pretty mind-blowing, isn't it, to realize that these characters originated with Batman himself in kid's comics in the 1940's, over sixty years ago.

659632,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005JPY0,K. Driscoll,"[5, 7]","The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan's (Memento) follow-up to his first Batman film,Batman Begins.  The series of films is a frustrating but entirely understandable reset of thenot-so old series of filmsstarted strongly by Tim Burton in 1989 and finished off infamously by Joel Schumacher in 1997.  Nolan has made a dark and real character out of Batman, kind of like writerFrank Millerdid with Batman in the comic books.The Dark Knight follows Gotham City billionaire Bruce Wayne and his night time vigilante alter-ego Batman (Christian Bale) as a new kind of enemy hits Gotham hard.  The enemy is the demonic and vile Joker (Heath Ledger), a character whose only motive is to concoct schemes to cause massive chaos in every facet of Gotham's society.  Meanwhile, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) has become Gotham's ""white knight"" as a District Attorney in fighting against the forces of organized crime that still persist from the first film.  Dent is dating Wayne's long-time friend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).  There are many other elements that I could get into that may lead to some spoilers.It is very important to note that the cast here is very strong.  Bale is great again as Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Eckhart is a pleasant surprise as Dent and shows remarkable depth.  Gyllenhaal is taking over for Katie Holmes in the role of Dawes and she is definitely a more compelling performer.  Michael Caine plays Alfred Pennyworth, Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman plays Lieutenant Gordon.  All three actors are without question among the best at their craft and deliver effectively here.  However, it is easy to get overlooked with Heath Ledger playing the Joker and making Jack Nicholson's performance from the 1989 film look like Cesar Romero from theold Batman television series.  Ledger plays him as an authentic and resourceful psychopath.  It reminded me of stories likeThe Killing JokeandArkham Asylum.  He is the best film villain since Hannibal Lecter and if Ledger weren't dead I would be waiting to see what he does next.  That tells me he is deserving of all the hype and will hopefully be recognized.I don't want to play my excitement while seeing this film down one iota; I believe it is to comic book movies whatStar Warswas to science fiction and whatThe Lord of the Ringswas to fantasy adventure, and I sincerely hope it gets the appropriate recognition for this.  I always try to view pulp like this as more than kitsch when it is executed with absolute perfection.  Everything about The Dark Knight delivers so I recommend seeing it twice at your nearest theater but be warned, it is probably too dark for most kids younger than eleven or twelve.",5,"""A single tiny candle, shining in the ugly dark.

659641,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00005JPY0,Kevin Killian,"[2, 6]","We watched this over several evenings, our big screen TV fed us too many images at each sitting to watch the picture for very long at one time.  Thus, my experience of the film was discombobulated, but I realize, that's just the way it is nowadays, and partly that's due to the DVD format, which encourages pausing and exiting and resuming according to the customer's convenience.  Maybe I would have enjoyed this one more if forced to see it in one clump, but who has the time for that nowadays?  It would have struck me as crazy long.Christian Bale stars as Bruce Wayne, my God, I'm tired already just starting to type that sentence.  Suffice it to say that you all know most of the casting already, and since I'm a Johnny come lately to this show, most of you have seen the darn thing already.  Good, then maybe you can help me.  When Bale is playing Bruce Wayne he talks nearly normal, but when he is the Batman he adopts a deep fuzzy basso voice that makes him sounds more profound.  Is this his real voice and the Bruce Wayne one the performance?  All I could think of, in the last part of the picture when Batman's feeling sad for one reason or another (sometimes it feels like the weight of the whole world is against him) doesn't he ever just revert to his regular voice, especially when overcome by emotion the way Bale often plays it?  Just saying is all, though the switch from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenhall is so startling that I, for one,was wondering why Bruce Wayne even regretted losing Rachel to Harvey Dent.  Not that Holmes is so beautiful but Maggie, well, it would be an offense to chivalry to say more.  Gyllenhall otherwise rendered a beautiful performance, and it almost seemed from reel to reel that she had not only watched, but understood, the first picture.The actors have gotten lots of praise in general, but most of them seemed like they were phoning it in, or playing to green screens that made them seem particularly vacant, Michael Caine.  People seem to love Gary Oldman in this, but I don't know.  As for Heath Ledger, drugs fueled his performance as the Joker, and drugs carried him off at the end, so caveat emptor.  Why is every superhero movie nowadays about public opinion?  That's what I don't understand.  Moviemakers have given us a new fictional universe in which the wants of the general populace sway every turn of the plot (Gotham citizens deciding Batman a vigilante, etc--or look at the new issues of Buffy Season Eight in which slayers are perceived as evil for some reason); this account of the way the world works has literally nothing to do with the real world, in which a handful of corporations and banks control what happens to all of us from birth to death, and that's just the way it is.

It has it all!A few things struck me in this movie that didn't in the others.First, gotham has a 'real city' feel to it this time. Not so unrealistic as in the other movies with oddly shaped buildings and dark skylines. This city is glass and concrete, proportional to other large cities and similar in appearances.Second... the Joker. Sad note here is we'll never have Heath Ledger as the Joker again. Truly sad because he took this character into a malevolent level that had never been done before. The insanity of this character came shining through.Third... Two Face! What a great adaptation of this villian! I haven't read the comics since I was a child, but the earlier series of Batman movies gave this character a different flow into the story line.

659645,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JPY0,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 7]","Crime no longer pays in Gotham City.  With the arrival of the Batman, criminals, thugs and crime bosses have found it rather hard to ply their trade.  The grip of corruption is also loosening in the city's police force.  Top it all off with the new DA, golden boy Harvey Dent, and you quickly find that a crook's wages are quickly getting poorer.So what's a crime boss to do?  That's easy. Eliminate the Bat.  Who's insane enough to take the job?  A heartless, maniacal, lethal and much-more-intelligent-than-he-looks villain who goes by the name on his calling card:  the Joker.  He lives by no rules and creates chaos for no other reason but to create chaos.Christopher Nolan picks up where his wonderful ""Batman Begins"" left off in ""The Dark Knight.""  Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and delves even deeper into the psyche of the character.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also return.  Neither of them skips a beat in their respective roles as Alfred and Lucius Fox.  Cillian Murphy makes a brief (but still cocky) appearance as the Scarecrow.  Another returning face is Gary Oldman as quite possibly the most sane person in the entire film, Lt. Gordon.Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes in ""Batman Begins.""  I felt that Holmes' performance was the weakest in ""Batman Begins"" and was actually glad to see her not return in this film.  Gyllenhaal brings a much more believable performance to the screen.  She's torn between two men that she legitimately loves.  One is Bruce Wayne and the other is Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).Eckhart hasn't received much publicity for his role in this film when compared to another newcomer, but he is just as brilliant in the role of Dent.  He's one of the more sympathetic characters in the film, and he rides an emotional rollercoaster throughout this story.Of course, all eyes were on Heath Ledger as the Joker.  All of the hype is true.  Ledger's performance as the Clown Prince of Crime is the most sinister and cruel performance I've ever watched on the big screen.  He makes you forget that this film is based on a comic book series that features a man in a batsuit and his boyish sidekick in red and yellow.  Ledger is simply chilling.  He's also quite hilarious in a sadistic way.  You know you shouldn't laugh at him, but you just can't help it at times.The film also features a number of other film and television stars in lesser roles.  Keep an eye out for the photographer (Nestor Carbonell) from ""Just Shoot Me,"" the geek (Anthony Michael Hall) from ""Sixteen Candles,""  Julia's estranged brother (Eric Roberts, as a slimeball crime boss) and the highly underrated William Fichtner as a gun-wielding banker.The film is tense.  Characters are given multiple choices, most of which are lethal no matter what they decide.  There are also a number of surprises in this film.  One in particular caught me completely off guard.Without revealing anything else, I have to say that if you see one movie this summer (or buy one DVD within the next year), ""The Dark Knight"" is the film you want.  It has a very, very hard PG-13 rating for a number of good reasons.  Part of me wished that the film had gone ahead with an R-rated release, but don't let that keep you from watching this film.  It's excellent, and I highly recommend it.",5,When Chaos Comes To Town,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,3336,"['Crime', 'no', 'longer', 'Gotham', 'City', 'arrival', 'Batman', 'criminals', 'thugs', 'crime', 'bosses', 'have', 'found', 'rather', 'hard', 'ply', 'trade', 'grip', 'corruption', 'also', 'loosening', 'city', 'police', 'force', 'Top', 'off', 'new', 'DA', 'golden', 'boy', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'quickly', 'find', 'crook', 'wages', 'are', 'quickly', 'getting', 'poorer.So', 'what', 'crime', 'boss', 'do', 'easy', 'Eliminate', 'Bat', 'Who', 'insane', 'enough', 'take', 'job', 'heartless', 'maniacal', 'lethal', 'much-more-intelligent-than-he-looks', 'villain', 'who', 'name', 'calling', 'card', 'Joker', 'rules', 'chaos', 'other', 'reason', 'create', 'chaos.Christopher', 'Nolan', 'up', 'where', 'wonderful', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'left', 'off', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'role', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'delves', 'even', 'deeper', 'psyche', 'character', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'also', 'return', 'beat', 'respective', 'roles', 'Alfred', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'brief', 'still', 'cocky', 'appearance', 'Scarecrow', 'returning', 'face', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'sane', 'person', 'entire', 'film', 'Lt.', 'Gordon.Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'role', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'felt', 'Holmes', 'performance', 'was', 'weakest', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'actually', 'glad', 'see', 'not', 'return', 'film', 'Gyllenhaal', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'performance', 'screen', 'torn', 'two', 'men', 'legitimately', 'One', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'other', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', '.Eckhart', ""n't"", 'received', 'much', 'publicity', 'role', 'film', 'when', 'compared', 'newcomer', 'just', 'as', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Dent', 'one', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'film', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'story.Of', 'course', 'eyes', 'were', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'hype', 'true', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Clown', 'Prince', 'Crime', 'most', 'sinister', 'cruel', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'big', 'screen', 'forget', 'film', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'man', 'batsuit', 'boyish', 'sidekick', 'red', 'yellow', 'Ledger', 'simply', 'chilling', 'also', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'sadistic', 'way', 'know', 'should', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'times.The', 'film', 'also', 'number', 'other', 'film', 'television', 'stars', 'lesser', 'roles', 'Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'photographer', 'Nestor', 'Carbonell', 'Just', 'Shoot', 'Me', 'geek', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Julia', 'estranged', 'brother', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'slimeball', 'crime', 'boss', 'highly', 'underrated', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'gun-wielding', 'banker.The', 'film', 'tense', 'Characters', 'are', 'given', 'multiple', 'choices', 'most', 'are', 'lethal', 'matter', 'what', 'decide', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'surprises', 'film', 'One', 'particular', 'caught', 'completely', 'guard.Without', 'revealing', 'anything', 'else', 'have', 'say', 'see', 'one', 'movie', 'summer', 'buy', 'one', 'DVD', 'next', 'year', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'film', 'want', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'number', 'good', 'reasons', 'Part', 'wished', 'film', 'had', 'gone', 'ahead', 'R-rated', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'keep', 'watching', 'film', 'excellent', 'highly', 'recommend']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659653,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,B00005JPY0,King of Controversy,"[0, 7]","Author Esther Vilar once wrote, ""In a country where man is exploited as unscrupulously as the USA, a movement that fights for more women's rights is reactionary, and, as long as the screaming for female equality does not stop, man will never get the idea that he is actually the victim"". I'm a big fan. It would be interesting, however, to review The Dark Knight from a feminist perspective. Women for the most part don't exist in this movie and when they do it's as someone to be fought over or protected. It's better than not being fought over or protected (at any cost), I suppose.Though they are unseen objects, the characters who we see rise or fall according to their relationships with the fairer sex. The Joker is the way he is, psychotic, because his wife has left him and he's become disfigured. The district attorney goes from Gotham's greatest hope to it's scariest villain when his girlfriend is killed and he's disfigured. This is a sort of an archaic mindset...? in our real world heterosexual expression is gradually criminalized? and an effort is made to separated men from their children for all except financial attachments? The world presented in The Dark Knight is fantasy in more ways than one.The strength of this movie is in Heath Leger's portrayal of the Joker as an agent of chaos and somehow also as a super master-mind criminal. He channels a bit of the TV series Joker as well. The completely unbelievable, or at least the unlikely, is made believable and realistic. The Joker merely has to utter a single hint and citizens across Gotham are turned into raving mad-men, frightened, and eager to do his bidding. Perhaps on some level we identify with the Joker. When Batman and the Joker are together Batman's voice turns a bit psychotic or disturbed as well, as if the two may be opposite sides of the same coin. It kind of bothered me that this 'moral ambiguity' or these moral dilemmas were being played out, not as a morality play but as a means to give the movie 'depth' or gravitas. Unfortunately, I didn't see the end of this very engrossing movie so my review is incomplete. I may have given it 4 stars (although I may have noted an objection to it's 'message' or something here also).I see why people liked Batman Begins... for the realism I guess, but I wasn't a huge fan of that one. This has been the best Batman movie I guess. I must say I liked the original series and original campy movie more than all of the Batman movies since I think.This film had one scene that was completely ridiculous. A lot of great, legendary movies do have one scene in them that's a bit far-fetched? In Steven Spielberg's, ET, it's when the young boy's bicycle begins to fly. When the Batmobile (the new one is kind of ugly i must say) when the Batmobile is chasing a Semi-truck down the freeway and the occupants of the truck are just about to launch a missile at a SWAT team truck carrying commissioner Gordon, Batman, who can't even see inside the truck from where he is behind it, he hits a button inside the Batmobile and it leaps into the air and somehow deflects the missile at the exact moment it's fired.My review is intended to be offensive toward women, by the way.There are so few chances to be a hero these days.",3,Don't tell me the ending.,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,3247,"['Author', 'Esther', 'Vilar', 'once', 'wrote', 'country', 'where', 'man', 'exploited', 'as', 'unscrupulously', 'USA', 'movement', 'more', 'women', 'rights', 'reactionary', 'as', 'long', 'screaming', 'female', 'equality', 'not', 'stop', 'man', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'idea', 'actually', 'victim', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'however', 'review', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'feminist', 'perspective', 'Women', 'most', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'movie', 'when', 'do', 'someone', 'be', 'fought', 'protected', 'better', 'not', 'being', 'fought', 'protected', 'cost', 'suppose.Though', 'are', 'unseen', 'objects', 'characters', 'who', 'see', 'rise', 'fall', 'according', 'relationships', 'fairer', 'sex', 'Joker', 'way', 'psychotic', 'wife', 'left', 'become', 'disfigured', 'district', 'attorney', 'Gotham', 'greatest', 'hope', 'scariest', 'villain', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'killed', 'disfigured', 'sort', 'archaic', 'mindset', 'real', 'world', 'heterosexual', 'expression', 'gradually', 'criminalized', 'effort', 'made', 'separated', 'men', 'children', 'financial', 'attachments', 'world', 'presented', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'fantasy', 'more', 'ways', 'one.The', 'strength', 'movie', 'Heath', 'Leger', 'portrayal', 'Joker', 'agent', 'chaos', 'somehow', 'also', 'super', 'master-mind', 'criminal', 'bit', 'TV', 'series', 'Joker', 'well', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'least', 'unlikely', 'made', 'believable', 'realistic', 'Joker', 'merely', 'utter', 'single', 'hint', 'citizens', 'Gotham', 'are', 'turned', 'raving', 'mad-men', 'frightened', 'eager', 'do', 'bidding', 'Perhaps', 'level', 'identify', 'Joker', 'When', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'are', 'together', 'Batman', 'voice', 'bit', 'psychotic', 'disturbed', 'well', 'two', 'may', 'be', 'opposite', 'sides', 'same', 'coin', 'kind', 'bothered', ""'moral"", 'ambiguity', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'were', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'not', 'morality', 'play', 'give', 'movie', 'gravitas', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'end', 'very', 'engrossing', 'movie', 'review', 'incomplete', 'may', 'have', 'given', '4', 'stars', 'may', 'have', 'noted', 'objection', ""'message"", 'something', 'here', 'also', '.I', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'liked', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'realism', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'one', 'been', 'best', 'Batman', 'movie', 'guess', 'must', 'say', 'liked', 'original', 'series', 'original', 'campy', 'movie', 'more', 'Batman', 'movies', 'think.This', 'film', 'had', 'one', 'scene', 'was', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'lot', 'great', 'legendary', 'movies', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'scene', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'ET', 'when', 'young', 'boy', 'bicycle', 'fly', 'When', 'Batmobile', 'new', 'one', 'kind', 'ugly', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'when', 'Batmobile', 'chasing', 'Semi-truck', 'freeway', 'occupants', 'truck', 'are', 'just', 'launch', 'missile', 'SWAT', 'team', 'truck', 'carrying', 'commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Batman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'truck', 'where', 'button', 'Batmobile', 'air', 'somehow', 'missile', 'exact', 'moment', 'fired.My', 'review', 'intended', 'be', 'offensive', 'women', 'way.There', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'chances', 'be', 'hero', 'days']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

They say this is the best super hero movie ever. Fan boy's, Critics and Movie goers  say Heath Ledger as The Joker was phenomenal. And they are absolutely 100% right.Me and my family went to the movies early today at 11:10 am to go see the anticipated movie : The Dark Knight. I never thought going into the movie theater that my heart would be beating so fast and hard because I have been waiting for this specific movie for a long time. Just when the movie was about to start the entire room just started to clap because they all knew two things going into TDK. First, they knew one of the best movies was starting. Last, they were all looking forward to Heath to bring us a Joker we wouldn't forget and one that caused some anarchy. Getting into the movie. The Joker was so evil and menacing that people just clapped at what he did. I was scared a couple of times through the movie. From him causing mayhem from him explaining how he got his scars. The action was a lot better than Batman Begins. I cant believe a lot of those sequences were not cgi even though I know Nolan doesn't like using cgi. Two-Face did look cool and I'm glad he brought his coin along. Everyone from the last Batman film came back with even more sparks and passion. They all seem so real with there character.  It also did get shocking. From the beginning to the end I was never bored. Maybe a little tired from the running of the movie.I definitely recommend this movie. It is one of the greatest movies of all time.

I am a big comic fan so I love how the movie stayed true to the relationship between Batman /Joker, and how one can't do without the other in Gotham. Also being a chicago native, I thought it was great to see the many shots of Chi-town as batman fought with his villains.

659666,A2FW9CW8LIOGA8,B00005JPY0,Kyle Rosenkranz,"[3, 3]","Just when it seemed that Marvel was going to take DC out of the picture with Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk (Two very good movies), The Dark Knight blows both of them out of the water. In fact, Iron Man and TDK have been looked at as a new breed of comic book films. No longer do the characters seem extraordinary that we can't believe that they're real. And the best part is that Dark Knight cements this.Above all I have to say that the film is most notable in its fine acting. Bale continues to prove that he is a virtuoso actor as the dashing Bruce Wayne and the ever brooding Batman. Gyllenhaal also gives a stellar performance that is far superior to her predecessor (Katie Holmes). Aaron Eckhart is both dashing as Harvey Dent and disturbing as Two-Face. And of course I cannot even forget the highlight of the film as its villian, The Joker (The late Heath Ledger). Ledger proves he gave his all and possibly is life to bring this legendary villian to the big screen in a superior performance over Nicholson's previous Joker 9 years ago. It is a guarantee that he should receive an Oscar nod.To begin with, Batman has grown to be somewhat of a boogeyman to the criminals of Gotham City and has given the citizens of Gotham a new reason to feel relieved. Add a new and successful District Attorney like Dent and the dawn seems to be closer than expected. However, where there is light, there is darkness, which comes in the form of the Joker. The Joker plans to set an example for Gotham and attack not only those who defend Gotham, but the very soul of the city, creating chaos and panic everywhere. After his first confrontation, Bruce realizes the lengths he must go in order to stop men like The Joker and wishes to end the situation before things get out of hand. And knowing he Joker, things will get out of hand.As said before the film features an all star cast and crew that deserves every award they can get their hands on. The Nolans have made a tight, though lengthy story that gives the audience a sense of true morality throughout Gotham that the previous movies have never shown before. This is top quality writing and directing, which should garner plenty of attention. Once again Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard have devised a terrific and haunting score that even makes the Joker seem more unnerving. I was impressed by the numerous CGI effects that don't even appear like computer animated images at all and the heavy cinematography and editing. All together this is a great film that has even made history already as the second highest grossing film of all time. There have been assurances on an inevitable third film, which may feature The Riddler, Catwoman, or Bane as the chief villian. Either way I expect great things.",5,Nolan Gives Us a New Class of Comic Book Films,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,2755,"['Just', 'when', 'seemed', 'Marvel', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'DC', 'picture', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Two', 'very', 'good', 'movies', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'water', 'fact', 'Iron', 'Man', 'TDK', 'have', 'been', 'looked', 'new', 'breed', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'No', 'longer', 'do', 'characters', 'seem', 'extraordinary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'re"", 'real', 'best', 'part', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'cements', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'most', 'notable', 'fine', 'acting', 'Bale', 'prove', 'virtuoso', 'actor', 'dashing', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'ever', 'brooding', 'Batman', 'Gyllenhaal', 'also', 'stellar', 'performance', 'far', 'superior', 'predecessor', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'dashing', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'disturbing', 'Two-Face', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'forget', 'highlight', 'film', 'villian', 'Joker', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Ledger', 'gave', 'possibly', 'life', 'bring', 'legendary', 'villian', 'big', 'screen', 'superior', 'performance', 'Nicholson', 'previous', 'Joker', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'guarantee', 'should', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nod.To', 'begin', 'Batman', 'grown', 'be', 'somewhat', 'boogeyman', 'criminals', 'Gotham', 'City', 'given', 'citizens', 'Gotham', 'new', 'reason', 'feel', 'relieved', 'Add', 'new', 'successful', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Dent', 'dawn', 'be', 'closer', 'expected', 'However', 'where', 'light', 'darkness', 'form', 'Joker', 'Joker', 'set', 'example', 'Gotham', 'attack', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'defend', 'Gotham', 'very', 'soul', 'city', 'creating', 'chaos', 'panic', 'everywhere', 'first', 'confrontation', 'Bruce', 'lengths', 'must', 'go', 'order', 'stop', 'men', 'Joker', 'wishes', 'end', 'situation', 'things', 'get', 'hand', 'knowing', 'Joker', 'things', 'will', 'get', 'hand.As', 'said', 'film', 'star', 'cast', 'crew', 'award', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'Nolans', 'have', 'made', 'tight', 'lengthy', 'story', 'audience', 'sense', 'true', 'morality', 'Gotham', 'previous', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'shown', 'before', 'top', 'quality', 'writing', 'directing', 'should', 'garner', 'plenty', 'attention', 'Once', 'again', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'have', 'devised', 'terrific', 'haunting', 'score', 'even', 'Joker', 'seem', 'more', 'unnerving', 'was', 'impressed', 'numerous', 'CGI', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'computer', 'animated', 'images', 'heavy', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'together', 'great', 'film', 'even', 'made', 'history', 'already', 'second', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'assurances', 'inevitable', 'third', 'film', 'may', 'feature', 'Riddler', 'Catwoman', 'Bane', 'chief', 'villian', 'way', 'expect', 'great', 'things']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Undeniably, the movie of summer '08 and possibly of this year. If there's one movie you see this summer, it'd damn better The Dark Knight.The Dark Knight's storytelling is definitely one of its highlights that distinguish it from the dozens of others in its genre - it's downright gritty & serious. Rather than treating itself like a summer movie, it's a compelling suspenseful crime drama filled with dynamic plot and handles it well. You may catch a lot of details you may have missed the first time so it's definitely rewatchable. Themes about morality, anarchy, and justice exist beneath the plot which left me thinking about the points Dark Knight brings up during and after the projector light goes down.Effects? Yeah Dark Knight's got great ones but not the CGI heavy ones we're so used to. CGI still can't be some good ol' stunt work that give action scenes a little more depth and realism, in my opinion. Luckily, the effects work doesn't make the mistake of becoming saturated and detract from the experience.Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard present the perfect music score for Dark Knight. The music that accompanies the film is mostly orchestral but there's just enough synthesized elements, such as the vigorous suspenseful buzzing-like sound, that it doesn't become annoying - excellent.Last but not least is the amazing casting. Christian Bale makes a solid Bruce Wayne and Batman. The lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal breathes more life into her character Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes could into Tom Cruise's career. Thank You For Smocking's confident Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent will make you believe in him because it's just fine acting. Lieutenant Gordon is back and so is his actor Gary Oldman who gets a chance to show off how great his acting is to characterizing the busy righteous cop. Finally the late Heath Ledger had the hardest but best performed role as the Joker. Never have I seen a villain so menacing as the Joker - a man who truly ""like(s) to watch the world burn.""The Dark Knight IS Oscar quality work. Christopher Nolan has taken superhero & comic book movies to new heights and maturity. He's going to get nominated for director and with his brother Jonathan, the screenplay.

I'll break it down into 2 parts: the movie and the blu-ray.The MovieI've watched The Dark Knight 4 times now and it still doesn't disappoint.  It has taken the comic book genre and the Batman series to another level.  The standout performance obviously is Ledger, in an unforgettable performance that will definitely stay with you days or even weeks after.  This is the joker's movie.  I can still hear his catchy little quotes in my head (""Why so serious"", ""Here weeeeee go"", etc.).  He has left us with gift and I'm sure his career was only going to get better.  What a tragedy.Bale slightly edges out Keaton as Batman, but I preferred his performance better in Batman Begins, which offers much more depth to the character.  Be of the rich plot and excellent action sequences, TDK is a better movie, but Begins is a better ""Batman"" movie.Overall, this is the best movie of the year...quality acting and an epic story.The Blu-rayThere is a lot of controversy among HD fans about the use of edge enhancement (EE) on this transfer.  On my Panasonic 42"", it looks flawless.  The aspect ratio changes do not hinder the experience but only add to it.The thing that is lacking the most is the special features.  No true behind the scenes featurettes, no Ledger tribute, and no behind the scenes footage of his performance for that matter.  A total letdown.

Not sure which character Michael Caine plays though.The biggest give away is the capture of the international money launderer .. it starts with James (er, sorry Bruce), on a yacht with a bunch of beautiful women, and ends with a skylift from the top of a tall building.Unlike your typical JB movie, which stretches the boundaries of believableness (is that a word?), this breaks those boundaries and turns into a true fantasy, where our hero has almost no limits to what he can do .. but that's ok, because our villain also has no limits to his ruthlessness (that is a word), being able to set bombs off at will anywhere in the city he pleases, without anyone having the slightest inkling that those barrels will explode if ignited.The movie makes you concentrate in order to follow the plot, which others have pointed is flawed in so many places, but then so are the plots of most JB movies. My biggest gripe is reserved for the last scene, where 2 ferries are battling it out to see which will crack first to blow up the other. It's just silly. Even if one person cracked, they would be responsible for the deaths of 100's of people and almost certainly sentenced to the death penalty, so Mr. Joker .. your game is flawed from the start. Not only that, but why would a ferry that is capable carrying several hundred people be full of convicts? I could not imagine it possible to leave several tons of explosives on any public ferry in the world without someone asking the question .. 'er, anyone know why our hold is full of explosive barrels?' Oh yes, and throwing what looks like a home-made (unstable) detonating device out of a porthole into the water .. what are the chances that is going to cause the detonator to go off (Or was that the point, and I missed it?)In summary .. if you like fast-moving thinking JB movies, and taking the stunts and fantasy to an extreme does not bother you, this movie is great.

The small screen will put a lot of people off but it was a new experience.As for the movie itself the Dark Knight was brilliant.  There are some things which stretch believability, for example, the Joker places bombs pretty much where he wants.  In a post September 11 world this is bizzare.  Batman's gadgets are cool and Christian Bale does a fine job as Batman not being a typical hero.  Heath Ledger as the Joker was inspired.  The producers have accidently dug a hole for themselves with Heath's death.  He will never be able to return for a sequel, and it's difficult to see anyone equalling him.

I would say that the Ledger Joker got the personality right & made up it's own history, while the Nicholson Joker went of one of the accepted stories of the Joker's creation. Reguardless of my cons outweighing my pros, it's the best Batman movie I've seen & I do recommend it.PROS: Unlike the Nicholson Joker, Ledger's Joker personality is more canon; the devotion to messing with Batman, the lust for elaborately planned carnage, the amboguous sexuality, the lack of fear in dying, the suggestiveness that he knows but doesn't care that Bruce Wane is Batman & the way he sees Wayn as Batman's mask & the Bat as the real thing, the way he enjoys twisting people's minds into insanity, his expencive taste in clothing, his nonchalantness in offing his own henchmen, the way he conciders killing hostages a game. The Joker of today is said to be supersane, pretending to be a nutcase to avoid the death penalty, & Ledger seemed to be going with that.CONS: This Joker has a slit-mouthed smile. Where did that come from? He also wears make-up instead of his face being chemically transformed. That probably came from The Dark Knight Returns book. The Joker's fashion sence is characteristicly expencive, but the Joker's fashion sence is supposed to be stuck in the past. The suit he wears in today's comics is a Ringmaster inspired Zoot Suit. Also, the Joker is not supposed to be responsible for Harvey becoming Two Face. Ledger's Joker barely fakes being nutty by talking to himself, cracking lame jokes, or rambling on about nothing to hostages. Commissioner Gordon DID have a wife named Barbara, but the wife that gets shot was Sarah. The Barbara the Joker nearly killed was Gordon's daughter.",4,"Finally, a movie about the Joker, costaring Batman.",1226707200,"11 15, 2008",2008,1876,"['Heath', 'Ledger', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'fantastic', 'Joker', 'movie', 'Joker', 'personality', 'background', 'have', 'foundation', 'comic', 'history', 'even', 'Joker', 'solid', 'background', 'would', 'say', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'got', 'personality', 'right', 'made', 'up', 'own', 'history', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'went', 'one', 'accepted', 'stories', 'Joker', 'creation', 'Reguardless', 'cons', 'outweighing', 'pros', 'best', 'Batman', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'recommend', 'it.PROS', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'personality', 'more', 'canon', 'devotion', 'messing', 'Batman', 'lust', 'elaborately', 'planned', 'carnage', 'amboguous', 'sexuality', 'lack', 'fear', 'dying', 'suggestiveness', ""n't"", 'care', 'Bruce', 'Wane', 'Batman', 'way', 'Wayn', 'Batman', 'mask', 'Bat', 'real', 'thing', 'way', 'twisting', 'people', 'minds', 'insanity', 'expencive', 'taste', 'clothing', 'nonchalantness', 'offing', 'own', 'henchmen', 'way', 'killing', 'hostages', 'game', 'Joker', 'today', 'said', 'be', 'supersane', 'pretending', 'be', 'nutcase', 'avoid', 'death', 'penalty', 'Ledger', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'that.CONS', 'Joker', 'slit-mouthed', 'smile', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'also', 'make-up', 'instead', 'face', 'being', 'chemically', 'transformed', 'probably', 'came', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'book', 'Joker', 'fashion', 'sence', 'characteristicly', 'expencive', 'Joker', 'fashion', 'sence', 'supposed', 'be', 'stuck', 'past', 'suit', 'today', 'comics', 'Ringmaster', 'inspired', 'Zoot', 'Suit', 'Also', 'Joker', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'responsible', 'Harvey', 'becoming', 'Two', 'Face', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'barely', 'being', 'nutty', 'talking', 'cracking', 'lame', 'jokes', 'rambling', 'nothing', 'hostages', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'DID', 'have', 'wife', 'named', 'Barbara', 'wife', 'shot', 'was', 'Sarah', 'Barbara', 'Joker', 'nearly', 'killed', 'was', 'Gordon', 'daughter']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Now onto the review. I thought i would do a comparrison review for the dark knight blu ray and dvd. Now it is no secret that Christopher Nolan's addaptation to the batman comic book mithology is a masterpiece, but lets see how the dvd and blu ray affair at bringing the film to the small screen.Movie Rating: 10/10 (all rating will be out of ten).Packaging: The packaging for both the dvd and blu ray are practicly the same. You get your normal Dark Knight slip case with Batman on his Bat Bod while the actual case has the joker on the front and a Jokerised version of the text on the back. Inside the two discs look the same though the blu ray has a third disc which is a digital copy. The only way that the dvd case would be better is becasue it has more pictures from the film, but it really doesn't matter. Packiging score: 10 on blu ray and dvd.Picure/transfer: The Transfer is amazing on Blu Ray. It has great image in colors, framerate, and black images. The real hd however comes from the select sequences shot in imax that have their apperance during the movie on the blu ray while the dvd has it on the 2nd disc. The imax scenes have some of the best hd in a blu ray disc ever. It is incredible!!!! However the dvd version is dissapointingly flawed with some bad color image at points and sometimes poor framerate. The imax scenes are also only featured on the second disc and not during the movie. It doesn't even look much better though, so the blu ray will win this round. Picture/transfer rating: blu ray: 10. DVD: 7Sound: The sound however is approprietly room shaking for both versions. The suround sound really has a great balance and will summon the cops to your door for a small gang war happening in your living room. Both versions have great surround sound, however the blu ray is slightly better because it has an hd mix witch mixes it a little more than the dvd, but they still both have great sound. So turn up the volume and wake the neighboors. Sound Rating: Blu Ray: 10. DVD: 9.Extras: The bonus features on the blu ray are not the best, but are still better than the dvd version. The first disc has movie focus points which have Gotham uncovered scenes. these are how the scenes are made like the imax chases, the first scene, the explosions, the batpod, bat suit, and more. These are very nice for a look at how your favorite scenes came to life. These are also on the dvd, but not all of them are on there, and are only on the second disc instead of watching them during your favorite parts of the film. The rest of the features on the blu ray have two documentrys from batmans gear and a psychology route on batmans inner struggle. These aren't in the dvd which is a dissapointment. I also wish that for both versions that they showed behind the scenes fottage at the making with heath ledger. That would be awesome. In addition, there is some nice BD Live content with downloads and documentrys you can make which are great. The features also have four galleries on blu ray, and two on dvd. There are also the theatrical trailers for the dvd and blu ray, and on the blu ray there are some tv spots. The features do not have heath ledger which is dissapointing,and the dvd features do not even have half of what blu ray has, but the features are still great on both, thought the dvd could have done a lot better. Each also has a digital copy to put on your ipod or computer too which is nice, so that sort of makes up for it. Extras rating: Blu Ray: 9. DVD: 7Overall, The Dark Knight is good enough to buy on either version, but the Blu Ray still stands in front for its quality, bd live, and features. still both are worth buying and you will enjoy each version. Dark Knight fans should probaly smile to the dvd, but wil say ""Why so serious? Because we seriously love this blu ray"".

659700,A2ODFNHZF5I7R1,B00005JPY0,"Luke ""When hello ended, you let me go...""","[3, 7]","First off, let me say my rating is for the package as a whole. The movie gets an easy five stars, but when you couple it with the lazy job the folks at Warner Bros. did here, it ultimately demeans the whole value of the package itself.It's pretty safe to say that The Dark Knight was 2008's most anticipated DVD release. I know how I have been up until the clock hit midnight and I had my copy in my grubby little hands. I was rabid, to say the least, and I got home and was salivating even as the opening credits graced my 52 inch television. The Dark Knight has something so special about it, and for me, that lies within Heath Ledger's final role as The Joker.Indeed, that is where the charm is with this film. Heath Ledger pretty much carries this whole film on his back, delivering what I can honestly say is one of the most chilling, accurate, and breathtaking performances I have ever seen in my life. There is something so real about The Joker, and it's hard to believe that this man is not real, because that is the spirit that Ledger brought to the role. He made you actually fear this madman walking down the streets of Gotham with a machine gun, and every bit of dialogue that Ledger had as The Joker was menacing, even if it was just the tiniest line.Now, we can't attribute all the credit to Ledger, as much as we would all like to. We have to give it up for hands down the best Batman ever- Christian Bale. It would have been hard to imagine anybody else playing this role if Bale had indeed been the first man to play The Dark Knight in any of Tim Burton's films, and it says something that he can surpass Kilmer, Keaton, and Clooney without ever even trying. Bale brings such a depth of realism to Batman and to his alter ego Bruce Wayne. And there, I say Wayne is the alter ego because throughout the course of this film we see just how much Wayne has actually become Batman.Aaron Eckhart is more than worthy of mention here as well. His performance as Harvey Dent was certainly a much-needed element to the story. Gotham needed a White Knight, and they got him in what could easily be described as his best performance yet. Course, Eckhart is no stranger to political roles, having played a spokesman for a tobacco company in Thank You For Smoking and a detective in The Black Dahlia, and credit has to be given to those roles he portrayed in order to create such a likable character in Dent who, when he falls, we in a way fall with him.The rest of the cast is excellent, as always, most notable Maggie Gyllenhaal filling in for the absent Katie Holmes. She didn't have very big shoes to fill for this one, considering that Katie Holmes can't act her way out of a paper bag, but Maggie did excellent with what little she had to work with. Michale Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman all return from Batman Begins and do even better in this film.However, the reason for the 3 1/2 stars for this package is that Warner Bros was simply LAZY with this 2 disc 'collectors edition'. There's about a total of 25 minutes of behind the scenes footage. Yeah. Even Batman Begins had about an hour if not close to an hour and a half. They discuss only a few things, like the score, the redesign of the suit, and the Batpod. Where's the behind the scenes of flipping the semi? Blowing up Gotham General? Where is any behind the scenes that was actually worth watching? Yeah, we get the IMAX scenes, which don't really matter unless seen on an IMAX screen, and six episodes of GCN, which are only interesting if you're really into politics, and the three trailers for the film. Wow. Warner Bros, thank you for making me pay $25 for something that should have been no more than $20. I guess they think the digital copy more than makes up for it's lack of anything else.As I said before, the film gets an easy five stars but the package is lack something EXTREME, and while it's okay, fans who were rabid at the mouth for the DVD release, like myself, are certainly feeling the punch that Warner Bros delivered to our spirits.",4,3 1/2 stars,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,4033,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'rating', 'package', 'whole', 'movie', 'easy', 'five', 'stars', 'when', 'couple', 'lazy', 'job', 'folks', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'did', 'here', 'ultimately', 'whole', 'value', 'package', 'itself.It', 'pretty', 'safe', 'say', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', '2008', 'most', 'anticipated', 'DVD', 'release', 'know', 'how', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'clock', 'hit', 'midnight', 'had', 'copy', 'grubby', 'little', 'hands', 'was', 'rabid', 'say', 'least', 'got', 'home', 'was', 'salivating', 'even', 'opening', 'credits', 'graced', '52', 'inch', 'television', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'something', 'so', 'special', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'final', 'role', 'Joker.Indeed', 'where', 'charm', 'film', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'film', 'back', 'delivering', 'what', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'accurate', 'breathtaking', 'performances', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'something', 'so', 'real', 'Joker', 'hard', 'believe', 'man', 'not', 'real', 'spirit', 'Ledger', 'brought', 'role', 'made', 'actually', 'fear', 'madman', 'walking', 'down', 'streets', 'Gotham', 'machine', 'gun', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'Ledger', 'had', 'Joker', 'was', 'menacing', 'even', 'was', 'just', 'tiniest', 'line.Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'attribute', 'credit', 'Ledger', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'Batman', 'ever-', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anybody', 'else', 'playing', 'role', 'Bale', 'had', 'indeed', 'been', 'first', 'man', 'play', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'something', 'can', 'surpass', 'Kilmer', 'Keaton', 'Clooney', 'ever', 'even', 'trying', 'Bale', 'depth', 'realism', 'Batman', 'alter', 'ego', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'there', 'say', 'Wayne', 'alter', 'ego', 'course', 'film', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Wayne', 'actually', 'become', 'Batman.Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'more', 'worthy', 'mention', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'performance', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'was', 'certainly', 'much-needed', 'element', 'story', 'Gotham', 'needed', 'White', 'Knight', 'got', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'described', 'best', 'performance', 'yet', 'Course', 'Eckhart', 'stranger', 'political', 'roles', 'having', 'played', 'spokesman', 'tobacco', 'company', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'detective', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'credit', 'be', 'given', 'roles', 'portrayed', 'order', 'create', 'such', 'likable', 'character', 'Dent', 'who', 'when', 'way', 'fall', 'him.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'excellent', 'always', 'most', 'notable', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'filling', 'absent', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'one', 'considering', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'Maggie', 'did', 'excellent', 'what', 'little', 'had', 'work', 'Michale', 'Caine', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'return', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'do', 'even', 'better', 'film.However', 'reason', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'package', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'was', 'simply', 'LAZY', '2', 'disc', ""'collectors"", 'edition', 'total', '25', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'footage', 'Yeah', 'Even', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'had', 'hour', 'not', 'close', 'hour', 'half', 'discuss', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'score', 'redesign', 'suit', 'Batpod', 'Where', 'scenes', 'flipping', 'semi', 'Blowing', 'up', 'Gotham', 'General', 'Where', 'scenes', 'was', 'actually', 'worth', 'watching', 'Yeah', 'get', 'IMAX', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'seen', 'IMAX', 'screen', 'six', 'episodes', 'GCN', 'are', 'only', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'really', 'politics', 'three', 'trailers', 'film', 'Wow', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'thank', 'making', 'pay', '25', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', '20', 'guess', 'think', 'digital', 'copy', 'more', 'up', 'lack', 'anything', 'else.As', 'said', 'film', 'easy', 'five', 'stars', 'package', 'lack', 'something', 'EXTREME', 'okay', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'rabid', 'mouth', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'certainly', 'feeling', 'punch', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'delivered', 'spirits']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659704,A3JX5C8CIOJ5L5,B00005JPY0,macdougallgreen6,"[0, 0]","Everything about this film is genius. The visual effects, the story, the characters, and, of course, Heath Ledger's career role as The Joker. From the moment we first see the eternally smiling villain, we are captivated by him, partly because of the way he looks and that he seemingly has no past, and partly because of the downright amazing performance by the ill-fated actor.Nolan himself said that Michael Mann's crime thriller Heat was a heavy inspiration on his second installment, and it's easy to see what he means. Like Mann's 1995 classic, this film has intense scenes of mayhem, violence, and peril, but what really makes them both so great is that they have so much time to breathe, to be calm before the storm. It is in these moments of quiet that hide the real intensity, and what made Nolan's trilogy so suspenseful.The DVD itself is just fine, it's a bare-bones presentation of the film, with no director's commentary or special features, which is fine. While I do love most of Nolan's special features the single-disc version can't be beat because of the price. However if you so desire stepping it up to get the two-disc set just for the bonus features isn't a bad idea.

Cooperstein,"[3, 7]","Having been convinced to see this megextravaganza in IMAX, my comments maynot be popular.In ""A Face in the Crowd"", the main character depends upon a slow-witted accomplice to inform him when a political candidate was boring. In my case, my buttocks provided the same information, squirming in the seat.My senses being captivated by the IMAX Vista, the technology and expectedly decent performances by Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman, I was admittedly overwhelmed by Heath Ledger's Joker. Why then, was my anatomy signaling that something was wrong?I found the answer in searching my memory to the most recent Indiana Jones. The same fidgeting occurred, breaking into my bonding with the film and intruding into my experience. In Indiana Jones, quite unlike myself, I found myself mentally screaming during some of the action sequences (paraphrasing Elaine's character in Seinfeld watching ""The English Patient"") ""End already! End already!""There is a balance between action and storyline. Where Nolan was sensitive to this in his first Batman outing, he seems to have fallen prey to ""if five minutes of action is good, it stands to reason that ten would be twice as good."" Unfortunately, this line of reasoning is false. If I want action with no or a weak storyline, I'll watch Stallone. My expectations were far higher in this case.Although it was to be expected that this would be a dark and brooding film, even though I viewed it on an enormous screen I could not see the action clearly as it faded into shadowy blurs. IMAX was clearly unnecessary unless you enjoy a few seconds of vertigo in overhead helicopter shots.Where was Christian Bales? The Joker was more the lead in this film. This was yet another imbalance. In his statements, the Joker speaks of his  love of chaos. Oddly, his chaos was so systematic and well planned that its very nature contradicts itself. Setting that faux pas aside, the Joker and Batman represent two poles of human nature: Chaos versus control. The Joker is more consistent with the chaos but Batman, to give him greater depth, should lose some of the compulsive rigidity he shows. The closest to this he demonstrates was when he permitted a criminal (Eric Roberts)to drop to the ground, obviously injuring his legs. At that moment, there was a sense of wanting to clap my hands as Batman finally showed some of his dark side.The film was worth seeing--not in IMAX, but as DVD. I have concerns about the director, who seems to be moving more in the direction of Hollywood glitz and away from the more symmetrical action/storyline shown in his first Batman.One final note: As a viewer I applaud Ledger's performance; as a psychologist I cannot help but wonder what the impact of his role had upon his psyche in such close proximity to the filming. If my suspicions are correct and his performance wins an Oscar, the cost will have been far greater than the limelight or salary he earned.Christian Bales, despite what some others believe, has shown himself to be an actor capable of extraordinary depth. The conflict between Batman and Bruce Wayne is often lost in quick transitions from one to the other or moments of silent reflection when one can only wonder what conflicts/thoughts are being processed at that moment.",3,Heath Ledger: The Light in the Dark Night,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,3271,"['Having', 'been', 'convinced', 'see', 'megextravaganza', 'IMAX', 'comments', 'maynot', 'be', 'popular.In', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'main', 'character', 'slow-witted', 'accomplice', 'inform', 'when', 'political', 'candidate', 'was', 'boring', 'case', 'buttocks', 'provided', 'same', 'information', 'squirming', 'seat.My', 'being', 'captivated', 'IMAX', 'Vista', 'technology', 'expectedly', 'decent', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'was', 'admittedly', 'overwhelmed', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'Why', 'then', 'was', 'anatomy', 'signaling', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'found', 'answer', 'searching', 'memory', 'most', 'recent', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'same', 'fidgeting', 'occurred', 'breaking', 'bonding', 'film', 'intruding', 'experience', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'quite', 'found', 'mentally', 'screaming', 'action', 'sequences', 'paraphrasing', 'Elaine', 'character', 'Seinfeld', 'watching', 'English', 'Patient', 'End', 'already', 'End', 'already', 'balance', 'action', 'storyline', 'Where', 'Nolan', 'was', 'sensitive', 'first', 'Batman', 'outing', 'have', 'fallen', 'prey', 'five', 'minutes', 'action', 'good', 'reason', 'ten', 'would', 'be', 'twice', 'as', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 'line', 'reasoning', 'false', 'want', 'action', 'weak', 'storyline', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'Stallone', 'expectations', 'were', 'far', 'higher', 'case.Although', 'was', 'be', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'dark', 'brooding', 'film', 'even', 'viewed', 'enormous', 'screen', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'action', 'clearly', 'faded', 'shadowy', 'blurs', 'IMAX', 'was', 'clearly', 'unnecessary', 'enjoy', 'few', 'seconds', 'vertigo', 'overhead', 'helicopter', 'shots.Where', 'was', 'Christian', 'Bales', 'Joker', 'was', 'more', 'lead', 'film', 'was', 'yet', 'imbalance', 'statements', 'Joker', 'speaks', 'love', 'chaos', 'Oddly', 'chaos', 'was', 'so', 'systematic', 'well', 'planned', 'very', 'nature', 'contradicts', 'Setting', 'faux', 'pas', 'aside', 'Joker', 'Batman', 'represent', 'two', 'poles', 'human', 'nature', 'Chaos', 'versus', 'control', 'Joker', 'more', 'consistent', 'chaos', 'Batman', 'give', 'greater', 'depth', 'should', 'lose', 'compulsive', 'rigidity', 'closest', 'was', 'when', 'permitted', 'criminal', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'drop', 'ground', 'obviously', 'injuring', 'legs', 'moment', 'was', 'sense', 'wanting', 'clap', 'hands', 'Batman', 'finally', 'showed', 'dark', 'side.The', 'film', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'IMAX', 'DVD', 'have', 'concerns', 'director', 'who', 'be', 'moving', 'more', 'direction', 'Hollywood', 'glitz', 'away', 'more', 'symmetrical', 'action/storyline', 'shown', 'first', 'Batman.One', 'final', 'note', 'viewer', 'applaud', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'psychologist', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'impact', 'role', 'had', 'psyche', 'such', 'close', 'proximity', 'filming', 'suspicions', 'are', 'correct', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'cost', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'greater', 'limelight', 'salary', 'earned.Christian', 'Bales', 'what', 'others', 'believe', 'shown', 'be', 'actor', 'capable', 'extraordinary', 'depth', 'conflict', 'Batman', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'often', 'lost', 'quick', 'transitions', 'one', 'other', 'moments', 'silent', 'reflection', 'when', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'conflicts/thoughts', 'are', 'being', 'processed', 'moment']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659706,AK9UPC78LIPIR,B00005JPY0,maelje,"[1, 2]","I cannot help but agree with the many critics and viewers who have declared that ""The Dark Knight"" is the best-ever superhero movie. In fact, in my opinion, nothing else even comes CLOSE.This is, quite simply, excellent moviemaking, with great characters, unforgettable visuals, and (thank GOD!) a story that actually works. That last element is the one most superhero -- indeed, many genre -- movies lack. Too often, the script is just poor -- lazily written, no character development, nonsensical. Here, though, we get a terrific, if not terribly original, story: The Joker appears, intent on wreaking havoc on Gotham City, apparently just because he can. He doesn't really need a reason, which works because it reflects the senselessness of our Age of Terror. Meanwhile, a good man named Harvey Dent is going bad, transforming into the hideously burned Two-Face.And, worst of all, Batman -- never trusted that much anyway -- may just have to take the fall for everything that goes wrong.Christian Bale's Batman is more nuanced and yet more powerful in this sequel. Aaron Eckhart brings true pathos to his depiction of Harvey Dent/Two-Face; you genuinely feel for him because of the torment he suffers, and yet at the same time, he horrifies.Best of all, though, was Heath Ledger as the Joker. It truly was a performance for the ages -- and would have been recognized as such even if the actor had not died not long after completing the role. Ledger is just fantastic in conveying the Joker's arrogance, pain, viciousness and, yes, wicked amusement at all he does.Director Christopher Nolan, whose work I've always liked (see ""Memento"" if you haven't!) is superb here -- and I say that as someone who is NOT a fan of shifting aspect ratios. I don't really know how he did it, but he makes it work here. In the theater, the aspect ratio shifted from 2.40:1 to 1.43:1 for the IMAX scenes. Nolan can't do that on the home-theater version, but does make use of the contrast between 2:40 and 1.78:1 on the blu-ray version. I should absolutely hate this -- it's not a technique that's used much, but when it has been, I have found it jarring and unpleasant. Here, it didn't bother me in the slightest -- I just watched the movie and was carried away by it.I also agree with those who say the movie is too long -- and yet, having seen it once in the theater and several times at home now, I'm usually at a loss to say what I think should have been cut out.""The Dark Knight"" is an extraordinary experience.

659707,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JPY0,magellan,"[1, 1]","I felt this movie had a lot in common with the pathbreaking graphic novel of twenty years ago by Frank Miller.  Well, it does have the same title, and no doubt it derives its inspiration from that book. (If you know more about this than I do, please feel free to leave me a comment). To recap a bit, Batman, then 50, had come of retirement to try to save Gotham city from powerful criminal masterminds. But we see a darker, more troubled Batman, not so different from the darker, more troubled Gotham City he has come out of retirement to protect. Batman is reviled in the press as a lawless, out-of-control vigilante, the city district attorney is hounding him, and even public opinion is turning against him. Batman seemed to have no allies in his lonely fight against crime but his old friend the Commissioner, who himself is increasingly beleaguered in his attempts to defend and help Batman.In this movie, we see that brilliant vision brought to the silver screen by Christopher Nolan. With an outstanding cast, a hard-hitting script, great performances all around, and spectacular special effects, it's hard to find a serious flaw anywhere in this cinematic recreation of the classic comic-book story. Oldman is outstanding as the Commissioner (interesting to see him playing a good guy for once), Heath Ledger as the Joker is simply over-the-top and brilliant, and Christian Bale, although perhaps not my first choice for this type of role, is excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Michael Caine and also Morgan Freeman have lesser roles but their performances are no less commendable for that. But it's Ledger's role that is clearly the standout. As the wise-cracking, lip-smacking, exasperated, and truly diabolical bad guy, his performance has few equals if any in the entire action genre.And if you like special effects, you won't be disappointed there, either. But for me the movie's fast, intense, non-stop scene-by-scene development was a joy to watch. It takes superb direction, writing, and editing to get this tight a movie, and all too often action thrillers suffer from too many special effects and not enough intelligent direction, script-writing, and editing. But this movie isn't one of that ilk.The Joker's motivation and character is also interesting. At first it seems he's after the big money just like everyone else. But instead he can't, like most criminals, be bought. Instead, he is a force for chaos--both for law and order and the other high profile criminals in the town. He is beyond the law, beyond normal rational behavior, and even beyond any possible monetary reward--a truly different and fascinating criminal mastermind.And if it isn't going too far to generalize from this Frank Miller story about Batman,  another reason I liked this movie is that it shows that in this world, evil usually wins out unless good is very, very careful. Similarly, in this movie, isn't enough to be good. For good to win, a heroic and indefatigable super-hero--Batman--had to fight it out to the very end with the forces of evil.I thought this movie was one of the surprises of the whole year. I wasn't expecting much, and came away with far more enjoyment than I normally expect from a typical action thriller. This movie delivers the goods.

659710,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00005JPY0,"Maine Writer ""David""","[13, 24]","Long, dark, and highly mechanical in execution, The Dark Knight suffers from many flaws, ranging from pseudo-intellectualism, overwrought seriousness, sloppy storytelling, and average acting.  Yet, almost all of these flaws are made up for by an astonishing performance by Heath Ledger.  When he appears, the screen lights up, figuratively, of course, since most of the film is barely (and poorly) lit.  His is the only character in the film of substance, and the only character worthy of sustaining an audience's attention as the film drags on and on and on.  In Ledger's hands -- and with dialogue that seems too good for the rest of the script, and suggests he might have been responsible for many of his own lines -- the Joker becomes a quasi-supernatural force.  He is a man without a past or future who is truly life's court jester, a trickster whose only driving force is to smash the status quo with a superior intellect, a pointed sense of humor (both literally and figuratively), and a grim visage that seems drawn directly from our collective unconscious.  He is the clown writ large, and he savors every word of his dialogue as his eyes, lips, and tongue dart and flash.In the end, you can't help but like this Joker, side with him, or at least feel comradeship with or sympathy for him.

The Dark Knight is that movie, with a scorching performance by the late Heath Ledger as The Joker which will rank as one of the greatest ever (think Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lector only in fading greasepaint); a terrific Christian Bale solidifying his legitimate claim as the best Batman ever; and a stunning supporting cast including Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman (who will go sadly underrated for his work here) and Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Not to mention the greatest script for a comic book movie ever, but to call it a comic book movie is to miss the point.

659715,A1IBKANWDYYFMV,B00005JPY0,Marc Klein,"[0, 1]","Christopher Nolan is a genius. In Batman Begins, we didn't see Batman until an hour into the movie which is usually a bad sign. However, Nolan was doing something that was never dealt with completely in other Batman movies and that is the origin story which was very well done. Well, Batman Begins was hailed as Batman's comeback but how do you top that? Can it be topped? The answer is YES.Unless your a Batman fan, you'd never know that The Dark Knight was a Batman movie and why Nolan chose to take that out of the title is anyone's guess but it really doesn't matter as this is the film BATMAN fans have been waiting for. This is a film that really explores the real batman and who he is as a character. This is more of a psychological film for Batman thanks in part to the Joker played by the wonderful late Heath Ledger.When Ledger was first cast, many wondered how he could top Nicholson's performance. It's hard to compare because they are two different types of movies with the 89 version showing Joker's origin and Nolan's showing him already as a lunatic psychopathic guy. Ledger really gave it his all in the role and if this was his final performance (It's not that went to Dr Parnassus)he went out on top. This was the role of his career and one of the best. Ledger will always be known for it.Anyway, Joker plays with Batman's mind alot here and none more so then with the police interrogation scene where Batman is seen as an angry pistoff guy who really, really wants to kill Joker right then and there but his morals won't allow it.  It is a very, very strong and powerful scene and well done by Bale and Ledger.There's so much going on story wise that it's sometimes hard to keep track of what's what but it does top Begins in every single way possible. Christopher Nolan has reinvigorated the character by doing what he wants and not listening to the fans. He chooses the villains based on the story and based on where Batman is right now. He feels (and I agree) that villains need to test superheroes and Batman, in my opinion, is more of a psychological character. He's not really a superhero. Maybe misunderstood. Maybe a vigilante. Maybe, as Bruce Wayne said in Batman Begins ""he's just a nut in a costume with issues"".The Dark Knight excels on every level possible that I can go on and on in this review but I won't. I'll just say that The Dark Knight is one of the best movies ever made and should be considered a classic.

The camera moves in a different angle or goes to another scene.Heath Ledger who plays the Joker did such an amazing job that I was angry that the movie ended and I wanted him to be in the finale so bad.If you don't know the Joker-he's a villian duh; lunatic at heart, unpredictable, charismatic (in his own sick twisted way) and that's why I love him so much.

There's a reason I stick to family entertainment, I truly enjoy it.Which is why I was so surprised I enjoyed Batman Begins when it hit the theaters three years ago.  Despite the dark tone of the preview for this movie, I decided to see it.  I'm sorry I did.The criminal element in Gotham City is on the run.  It's really a triple effort thanks to Batman (Christian Bale), Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman), and new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).But just as they are centering in on the leaders of organized crime, a new villain emerges.  The Joker (Heath Ledger) is attempting to become the next leader, getting all the other criminals behind him.  And as he wins their confidence, things get worse in the city.  Can Batman save the day?The movie started out fine with a few laughs to lighten the mood and an interesting story.  But as it progressed, it really fell apart.Part of the problem was the overly gruesome nature.  Oh, I'll grant you that there was little if any blood.  But there were still some images that were truly horrific.  How this movie escaped the R rating it deserved is beyond me.Then there are the story issues.  The writers bit off more story then they could chew, even in two and a half hours.  Complicating the problem is the random nature of the Joker.  The end result is a movie that feels so scattered in the final hour it's hard to figure out what any one's motives are any more.One of the things I enjoyed the most about the last movie was the character development.  Here, it's completely lacking.  It would have taken away too much from the gruesome images and explosions, I guess.  Instead, we get a few attempts at development, all of which come across as forced and trite.But I can't blame that on the writer alone.  I honestly felt like most of the cast was just going through the motions, making it hard for me to find anything to grab on to.  Potential love interest Rachel Dawes was one of my favorite characters in the first movie.  The roll is taken over here by Maggie Gyllenhaal who is only passable.  One of the few exceptions was Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent.The other exception was the late Heath Ledger.  He was brilliant as the Joker.  I couldn't look away when he was on screen even if I wanted to.  All the praise he has gotten for the part is well deserved.  In fact, his acting job earns the movie its second star.Now I know what you are thinking, ""What did you expect from a movie with Dark in the title?""  And you're right, I have only myself to blame for sitting through it.

659723,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00005JPY0,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 3]","Superhero films represent an area of compromise at our house: I like good ones while my better half generally doesn't bother with them at all.  The hype around the release of ""The Dark Knight"" not only tempted Cindy into watching - it colored both of our perceptions while watching it during the original release.See - the hype told us that Heath Ledger had given a once-in-a-lifetime performance that was dark - VERY dark - as The Joker.  Then, just before the release Mr. Ledger died suddenly from an accidental drug overdose, and there seemed to be a between-the-lines insinuation that he had taken the dark portrayal of The Joker to an emotional place where, perhaps, the drug-related death wasn't accidental.So when we first viewed the film in 2008 we couldn't help but wonder if we weren't watching a man careening toward self-destruction, and our stomachs were twisted into knots.  We agreed that the hype was correct - his performance is electric - and no one was surprised a few months later when Ledger joined the exclusive club of actors who earn the Academy Award posthumously.  But we weren't eager for another viewing.Nearly two years later I was ready to view The Dark Knight again, and I came away with a new appreciation not only of Ledger's performance, but of the entire film.  It is interesting that Ledger completely re-invented a characterization of a role previously blistered by Jack Nicholson.  Twenty years ago who would have thought that someone could give us another vision of The Joker that was more disturbing and vivid than the Nicholson who burns Jack Palance alive in the original Batman?Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, and the dual nature of Billionaire Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego are even more pronounced in this version than in ""Batman Returns"" as Batman has many fans for his vigilante crime-stopping activities, but he also knows that his activities are squarely outside of legal law enforcement.  But this Gotham City is dark - very dark - and Citizen Bruce Wayne knows that the People need someone they can believe in who doesn't wear a mask.  Gary Oldman returns as James Gordon, en route to becoming the familiar commissioner and apparently the only honest cop in Gotham City.  Aaron Eckhart is brilliant as Harvey Dent, an equally rare uncorrupt District Attorney.  Dent's willingness to take personal risks combating Gotham City's organized crime figures makes him something of a white knight in the city's consciousness, and Bruce Wayne is plenty willing to let Dent be the hero.  Katie Holmes is ably replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, childhood friend of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City Assistant D.A., and one of the key sequences of the film involves Batman and the police being placed into a position of choosing between saving the D.A. or his assistant.  Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine return as trusted Bruce Wayne employees Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox.  Both actors are incapable of a bad performance, and both lend weight and wisdom to their respective roles: Fox becomes uneasy when Wayne turns all Gotham cell-phones into eavesdropping mechanisms in an attempt to flush out the Joker and Alfred acts as a trusted carrier of a letter between Rachel and Bruce.The villains are again formidable here: Eric Roberts' Sal Maroni has taken over the old Falcone mob.  Ng Chin Han plays Lau, a mob accountant who takes it upon himself to spirit away the mob's money to Hong Kong just ahead of closing lawmen.  Cillian Murphy returns as Scarecrow.But all villains collectively take a back seat to the force of nature of Ledger's Joker.  Ledger's performance is so unhinged it seemed that the other actors were truly frightened of him, especially when armed with a knife.On a second viewing ""The Dark Knight"" becomes so much more than a superhero movie.  It is the best crime drama since ""The Departed"" and the fact that Bruce Wayne is a well-armed costumed vigilante barely impinges on the ""real"" elements of the film.  By the end of The Dark Knight I was still gasping for breath.

659726,A17BUUBOU0598B,B00005JPY0,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[1, 3]","The Dark Knightis a very impressive follow up toBatman Begins.  This is one of those rare movies that can be enjoyed by fans of the original comic book series and those completely oblivious to the various sub-plots of Batman's legacy.  The acting is largely very well done and most of the story elements are very well put together.THE STORYThis installment in the series re-introduces Heath Ledger as ""The Joker"" in a role that will be often discussed and deservedly so.  But the story is more complex than the Joker alone, and plays on the various psychological games that he plays on Gotham's various groups, including the public, the police, organized crime and Batman himself.  In that sense, there is a great deal of depth to the story that makes it easy to suspend disbelief considering not everybody is quick to believe comic-book plot-lines.But there are also several unanswered questions about the story and the fates of some of its characters.  Long time Batman fans will be more aware of some of the minor departures from the original stories, but it's impossible to discuss them without spoiling the plot.  By and large, the areas where the story is altered are well done.  Just be prepared for some nagging questions at the end that are certain to be answered by one or more sequels.THE CASTThe casting is top notch.  Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Christian Bale and Gary Oldman turn in great performances in their roles, mostly static carry-overs from ""Batman Begins.""  And Aaron Eckhart is wonderful in his role as Harvey Dent, so much so that he could have certainly been nominated for several awards as well. But perhaps the one role that I was not entirely happy with was that of Rachel, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.  While she is certainly a capable actress, I found most of her scenes showed little range or emotion.  I have to wonder if the part was written that way or if she simply underplayed the role.  In any case, these are very small details considering that her role is still serviceable and doesn't detract from the story.THE CAMERA WORK AND SOUNDThe other element that should be considered with this movie is the extremely dark colors and shadows used throughout the film, perhaps to symbolic effect.  ""Batman Begins"" was very dark, but this takes that morbid darkness to another level.  The camera work and lighting are excellent.  But the quality of your home screen will greatly influence your ability to appreciate the visuals of this movie.  Be prepared to watch this movie in absolute darkness.  Also be ready for a sound mix that alternates somewhat between low dialogue and the loud sounds of gunfire and explosions.THE SPECIAL FEATURESThe Two-Disc Special Edition includes some extras and a ""Digital Copy,"" a convenient way to get a DRM accepted version of the film for your mobile devices.  You still have to enter in a special code, which is included, in order to obtain and access the copy.There are also six individual scenes from the IMAX wide-screen, though you have to play them one by one.  Standard galleries are included with production stills and poster art. We also have the ""Gotham Tonight"" news features with surprise appearances by none other than Anthony Michael Hall.  Those features are actually great to watch with those less familiar with the Batman story before watching the movie.The ""Gotham Uncovered"" extra includes two parts: ""The Evolution of the Knight"" covers some of the details on the new suit and Bat-pod, and ""The Sound of Anarchy"" includes a nice discussion on the score as created by Hans Zimmer, which is very good. The thing that I noticed most about ""The Sound of Anarchy"" is Hans Zimmer's impressive editing and mixing workstation.But the extras of disk two may still fall short of the impressive extras that were included with theBatman Begins (Limited Edition Gift Set).  So while this is still a very good release, many will want to buy the widescreen edition for now and save their money for the next special edition that is likely to come or the Blu-Ray release.CONCLUSIONThis film is an achievement.  I only wish that I could have seen it in the IMAX release. This may be a movie worth upgrading to high-definition Blu-Ray for.

659727,A829MQB4JIOBJ,B00005JPY0,"MarkusG ""Markus""","[8, 19]","I'm so disappointed with ""The Dark Knight"". The film is just such a pointless mess that it's hard to begin to explain why. The special effects and photography is excellent, but that's about it. Here are the main flaws, as I see it:First of all: It's not believable. With this I don't mean that a movie about Batman must be totally realistic. But the problem here is that after watching an hour or something, I get the feeling that 'anything can happen' in this particular Gotham-universe. And that is a problem because if 'anything can happen' there is no logic to anything and that makes me lose interest (even fantasy worlds like Tolkien's or Lovecraft's have a certain logic that makes them 'believable' - you feel you are there as a viewer/reader). The Joker can do what he wants, he's like some kind of supernatural being, and after a while it's just tiresome to see him blowing everything up and implement totally implausible plans (where are his allies, there must be millions of them, with clairvoyance and time machines and stuff like that...?). It all feels like a confusing dream where people die and come back, pop up in the most implausible locations and where time and gravity is totally out of joint. In a bad way.Second: Too much action crammed in. Big events and extreme situations are just heaped upon one another in such a pace that it just becomes tiresome.Third: the characters are uninteresting. In ""Batman Begins"" the plot was less chaotic and the characters were more interesting. I mean, the Joker may be the result of a lot of creative effort from a Ledger and make up artists, but in the end I don't care about who or what he is. Also, I don't care about Batman, Bruce, Alfred, Gordon, Dent or anyone else either. They are, again, not believable in any way and the 'anything can happen-universe' contributes to this.Fourth: Why does Batman has to speak with a silly voice? (Here I'm asking the same question as the Joker: - why so serious?)Fifth: the movie is too long for its own good.In the end I actually think ""Iron Man"" is a far better movie! And talking Batman I think ""Batman Begins"" is superior to this barely watchable mess.The picture on the DVD is good, and there is also a whole extra disc with extra material. The problem is I don't have the energy to watch any of this. I will give away this DVD, the question is to whom?

Before we get into the review, you need to know that this movie is long. It clocks in at 2 hours and 30 minutes and there are times where you might feel it. I think I checked my cell phone twice to see what time it was. I came out of the theater feeling like I had been watching Batman all night. But I felt that way because of the early hour.I was excited to see the early reviews for this monster - Rotten Tomatoes had 100% positives. I was anticipating this movie like a 10 year old waiting for his birthday!Having said that, this movie is dark. I would not recommend taking small children to see this movie. It isn't promoted like Spider-man and is nothing close to Spider-man. While mainly bloodless, there are countless deaths.You feel despair from the first bank robbery.Christian Bale does a fine job as Bruce Wayne and The Batman. The problem comes with his ""Batman voice"". We heard a small amount of it in Begins while he yelled and gave us one word phrases, but with Knight, Batman is giving longer speeches and his hoarse/gruff ""be afraid of me"" voice comes across as a bit silly.The other actors, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart do fantastic jobs in their roles. The issue continues to be the Rachel Dawes character played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. For some reason I just don't enjoy any screen time with her - for both movies. For The Dark Knight, she's dating Harvey Dent (Eckhart) while waiting for Wayne to quit being Batman.Wayne sees his chance in Harvey Dent. Dent is the new District Attorney for Gotham and is cracking down on the mob. The citizens have a ""hero with a face"" and cheer him on in his quest.Enter The Joker. Heath Ledger is the master of this movie. Any time he isn't on screen, you're wishing he was. And when he is on screen, his performance is so disturbing you never want it to end...Makes one feel a little dark for enjoying the crazy antics of the psychotic killer.Because The Joker has no deep, hidden reason for what he does, anyone can be killed in this movie at any time...anyone.

I like that the Joker is never referred to as the Joker, although we know he's the Joker.  It gives the character more depth and meaning without the label.  And honestly, as you go further back in time in the Batman legacy, the Joker gets campier and campier.  I think abandoning the label was brilliant.The exploration of community and crowd mentality was brilliantly shown in the scene with the ferries.  There was a lot of thought put into the instinctual nature of the crowds on both ferries.I do agree with some other reviews that the Harvey Dent character could have used more thorough exploration of his transformation.

The tension and suspense that builds up to the final minutes is in tremendous amounts and the action is a plenty. As we all know, Heath Ledger's Joker is big in popular culture right now, and his performance is not overrated at all, i think. He truly makes this film scary with his acting chops and makes it hard to believe that such a young actor portrayed him with such twisted and dark brilliance. This role will always be remembered.

659739,A3JZ5L52FM318H,B00005JPY0,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[1, 1]","The film:OK, let's get the problems out of the way first: The Joker's plot is ridiculously convoluted. It's about 20 minutes too long (cutting the Hong Kong subplot would have tightened the film considerably). Harvey Dent's transformation is a bit pat, difficult to believe such a diametrical change in personality so quickly. The cell phone deus ex machina at the end is a little tough to believe.That's about it for the problems. Here's what works:-The setting. Nolan uses even more beautiful Chicago locations than in the first film, making for both a Chicago lover's dream movie (second only to Blues Brothers) but also rooting this film with a sense of reality that makes the tension and fear ramp up all the more.-The acting. Every player invests their character with a seriousness and an internal life that makes the movie sing as a thriller. Particularly good are Eckhart, Ledger, and Gyllenhall. Ledger in particular pulls off the impossible - besting Jack Nicholson's Joker with a truly chilling, psychotic vision.-The action sequences retain a believability but also deliver in terms of size, thrills, amazingness. The chases are all thrilling, and some of the large set pieces (flipping the truck, hang gliding in Hong Kong) are truly great.So it is the greatest comic book film? I would submit that it is. The other true greats, Superman(1978), Batman(1989), X-Men, and Spider-Man, all fall short in one of the above aspects. ""Superman"" is hampered by a somewhat silly climax. ""Batman"" is a bit too long, and the world teeters on the brink of not feeling real. ""X-Men"" also suffers on the realism side. ""Spider-Man"" is close, but some of the acting is not up to snuff. ""The Dark Knight"" really delivers in spades on all of these levels. Like the first Nolan film, it works as a movie, without requiring a love for the character. It works as a thriller - I recall my palms sweating in the theater. It's just excellently made, despite a few story logic issues (say, how did they sneak all those explosives onto those boats?).The Blu-Ray:This is a reference quality disc. It switches between 16:9 and 2.35:1, replicating the aspect rations of everything shot for the film - some sequences were shot in the wider aspect ratio for IMAX presentation (note: an IMAX frame is actually ""taller"" than 16:9, almost 4:3, but Nolan and the DP say that they composed the shots to be shorter than that, since information that the very top and bottom of frame are hard to see anyway in an IMAX theater, and usually are out of focus anyway). These sequences are really awe-inspiring in terms of the detail and scope they provide. Nonetheless, both ratios display lots of detail. Cloth textures, facial pores, fine hairs, and a very light film grain are all visible. Black levels, important in a film like this, are rock solid and very deep, but still allow lots of shadow detail. I will say, there were one or two instances of jagged edges on high contrast lines (I believe I noticed it in the ""new batcave""). But it wasn't pervasive, probably 10 seconds worth of artifacts in 2:30.Be sure to calibrate your display for watching this! (I recommend Digital Video Essentials, but the Lucasfilm THX calibrator found on Star Wars and Indy DVDs works in a pinch). Audio is very strong, with a TrueHD 5.1 channel mix that delivers both big noise as well as subtle dialogue. To put it simply, this is in the top 5 Blu-Ray discs yet released.Extras are also very strong. Although there is not an audio commentary, there are an hour of ""focus points"" which can be accessed during the film or as a complete documentary. The second disc contains 2 extensive HD documentaries, some fake Gotham news clips which were edited way down for the film, and a large picture gallery. All in all, you're looking at about 3 full hours of extra content. A ""digital copy"" disc for your laptop or iPod rounds out the set.***********If you're a fan of action, you should get this. If you love comics, you should get it. If you love top notch HD, you should get this.It really is a must-own for any Blu-Ray collection. The only reason not to get it is if you can't stand visceral, in your face thrillers with a lot of violence and tension. This may not be a film for a 5 year old.

DaVega ""pop culture historian""","[10, 15]","Well, we know now that The Dark Knight was the top ticket-taker of the year, possibly even the whole decade, and kudos to it for that accomplishment. But just simply being the highest-grossing movie of the year is not the same thing as being the best. In all honesty, TDK is one of the worst highest-grossing films in history. Don't get me wrong, TDK is still a decent movie, but it defies logic and reasonability that it became the biggest movie of the year. The primary reason it took in so much money was because of the immoderate and inordinate hype surrounding it due mainly in part to Heath Ledger's death. People were understandably curious about seeing it after so much hype was pumped into it. Well, we all know what they say about great expectations. I saw this movie and I can't say I see what all the damn hype is about.The Dark Knight is above-average as far as comic book movies go, but it is simply undeserving of the excessive praise and ridiculously extravagant claims that it is 'the best movie of all time' as I've heard some people state or that it's oscar-worthy. It's not. Sorry, but it really isn't. It was good, but it was no better than any other professionally-mounted movie of the year. Several other comic-book/action movies of the year such as Iron Man, Indiana Jones, Hellboy II and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor ALL had FAR better stories. That was one of my main grievances with TDK in that it just didn't have a very interesting or involving enough story. Parts of it lagged and there were too many scenes of long, extraneous dialogue that were, well, boring. I even found myself glancing at my watch more than once, I'm sorry to say. The one term I keep hearing everyone say over and over about this film is that it is 'layered' and that's part of its problem because it has too many subplots and is too busy to focus on any one thing in particular. 'Layered' is just a fancy term for 'crammed full of too many subplots' (The Joker, Batman and Bruce Wayne, Harvey Dent's crusade to save Gotham, Gotham's organized crime syndicates, Bruce Wayne and Rachel, Harvey Dent/Two-Face) and that's certainly the case here. There's even an unnecessary early subplot in the film where Bruce Wayne must travel to Hong Kong as Batman to catch a white-collar Chinese criminal that could have ----- and SHOULD have ----- been avoided. I also didn't care much for Maggie Gylenhaal as Katie Holmes' replacement of Rachel Dawes, as her character was responsible for a large portion of the afforementioned longwinded, boring dialogue and marginal acting. She was unattractive, wasn't that great and I wasn't impressed with her. There's literally enough material in TDK for a good two movies at least, and shoehorning them all into one makes me not care about any of them. The movie ends up being a tad overly long as a result and honestly needed to be about 35 to 40 minutes shorter. Christopher Nolan could have at least deferred and stretched some of TDK's material over into the next movie.I did like Heath Ledger as the Joker and while there's certainly nothing wrong with his performance, it's not oscar-worthy and it's less fun than Jack Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker in the original 1989 Batman. (By the way, it's going to start sending a bad message if every actor who dies on set of a movie during filming or immediately thereafter automatically gets considered for an oscar.) Too many of the Joker's traits and comic-book trademarks were unecessarily compromised for this film. I didn't like the fact that Ledger's Joker isn't like a gleeful clown-pimp with bone-white skin anymore, he's just a homicidal maniac in face paint. Jack Nicholson's Joker wasn't just a nutzoid freak in white makeup and Courtney Love-inspired red lipstick, his skin was actually bleached white that way and his face frozen in a Sardonicus-like grin from his fall into the acid in the 1989 film, which was much more true to the comic-book origin. Ledger's Joker didn't have a hideous frozen grin on his face, his mouth is just carved into grin and his constant asking of ""you wanna know how I got my scars?"" throughout the movie got on my nerves. While Ledger's Joker is unique and watchable, overall I have to say that Jack Nicholson's Joker was more spot-on and stayed truer to the comic book.TDK does have enough redeeming qualities to make it worth seeing, however. Like its predecessor, Batman Begins, TDK has the same impressive sets and marvelously done visuals that made the first film good. There are nice compositions and color scales that effectively duplicate the garish look of a comic book without going so far as to make it unbelievable. It has great visual style and definite real-world texture and feel to it. To the movie's credit, one particular scene near the climax is very exciting, where Batman must fight his way through a high-rise building filled with the Joker's goons, hostages and SWAT team police to get to The Joker at the building's top, mapping his way with a sonar imaging camera all the way throughout the building. But Christopher Nolan just isn't really adept at action sequences ; this scene was for the most part too dark and the editing done too fast to tell what was going on. While TDK has many of the same good elements from BB, the biggest one that is missing from the first film is the excellent characterization of Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins. Batman is barely even a supporting character in this movie, taking a backseat to the monstrousness of the Joker and Harvey Dent's crusade and plight as newly crowned District Attorney of Gotham City. Christian Bale's Batman in this movie doesn't really seem like Batman, he just comes across as a big, super-armored thug as few other reviewers have already mentioned. I also found his raspy, gravelly voice he uses as Batman to be irritating and distracting. Why does he insist on doing this? Does he do this so no one will recognize Bruce Wayne's voice? Who the hell else in Gotham City could afford a hundred-thousand dollar kevlar batsuit??!? Please. And why would he use the voice as Batman around other characters who already know his secret identity anyway??!!?For me, TDK's biggest flaw ------ one that I'm surprised more people haven't noticed ------ is its near-total lack of any element of fun. Yeah, I know it's supposed to be dark, grim and gritty but there's next to no comic-relief or humour present. What very little humour there is comes courtesy almost exclusively via deadpan performances and lines from Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, not coincidently in the fact that they were both two of the best things about Batman Begins. Sorry, but the 1989 Batman beats TDK out in the fun department.Overall, TDK is an above-average action movie but seriously overrated and far from flawless. I probably would have actually enjoyed this film MORE if everyone hadn't killed it for me before I even saw it through so much inordinate praise and hype. It's not the outstanding masterpiece so many people have suggested it is and trying to place this movie in the same category of film excellence such as Citizen Kane or Bridge on the River Kwai is not only a discredit to this movie itself but also to individuals themselves making such preposterous, extravagant claims. TDK's excessive praise goes beyond exaggeration, it has reached the point of just plain absurdity. TDK is above average as a comic-book movie, but it's just that and ONLY that ----- a comic book movie. Let's not try to make it into something that it's clearly not.",3,Biggest DOES NOT Equal Best.,1228953600,"12 11, 2008",2008,7580,"['Well', 'know', 'now', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'top',

I mean, this movie has been lauded as one of the greatest of the decade.  And truthfully speaking, it is a good movie; better than some others I've been forced to endure.  But it's not ""great"".  That's what this review will tell you - why I say the movie isn't ""Great"".Background - I did watch, and quite enjoyed, Batman Begins.  If you haven't seen that movie, you don't need to in order to understand the events of Dark Knight, though some experiences are made better if you did (such as the relationship between Wayne and Rachel).  But what Batman Begins did right is the backstory; how Batman got his training and expertise, as well as his morality and sense of justice.  Also, his basic understanding of the criminal mind is briefly explained here, and his development of the various tools of the trade that he now uses to dole out the justice.  Because of that, it's a good idea to watch Batman Begins first, even if not required, because it sets the stage nicely.  A friend of mine who is a DC comics fan couldn't stand Batman Begins, because, as he put it, ""Batman isn't supposed to be that serious"".  Maybe not from the comic book world, but the comic book world is designed to be lighthearted so it can be catered to kids.  When you translate that across to a more mature audience, you need to make the character that much more mature.  This is important, because the same methodology applies to Dark Knight, if not more so.Without spoiling anything, the whole deal behind Dark Knight is that Batman encounters a character who is his exact polar opposite: He's serious, yet treats things such as killing very lightly.  He has no code, no morals, no ethics...only a means to an end.  This is expressed throughout the movie, as the Joker goes to any length to get what he wants.  During the movie this is believed to be a simple crime, but it eventually turns out to be a total twist - proving a point to Batman and in the doing, making Batman violate some of his moral code in order to stop him.  All of this is done very well; in fact, it's clear that the very happy-happy ending of Batman Begins was not appealing to someone in the writer's office, because this one never gets happy-happy.  Some of it is downright depressing, which I suppose is the intent of the movie.What the movie does right: Christian Bale does a good job of playing Bruce Wayne and Batman respectively.  Bruce Wayne is not involved in this movie nearly as much as the first one and in fact, feels like an afterthought.  There's a lot more focus on Batman this time around, which is as it should be.  Heath Ledger, who I doubt you've not heard about, plays the Joker extremely well.  What some people claim is an inaccurate portrayal, again, is simply a rendition of the comic book character changed to a more mature setting, and it comes across well.  Joker knows exactly what he's doing, but just does not feel remorse for any of it.  He doesn't stick himself into a funnel with some moral code; he does what needs to be done, and understands that in order to stop him, everyone, even the most ethical, would do the same thing when pushed to that limit.  Aaron Eckhart, who some might recognize from ""The Core"", enters into the story as Harvey Dent, a prosecutor who relies on chance (evident by Dent's frequent flipping of a two-headed coin) to get through his profession.  All of the other actors play their parts decently well, but Ledger stands out above the rest, followed shortly by (in my opinion) Bale, and then Eckhart.  I know Christopher Nolan would have you believe that Eckhart is the shining star, but his performance was marred by a part that effectively was not done properly (more on that in the next section).What the movie does WRONG: It's all subjective, but there was quite a bit I didn't care for.  First, Batman Begins did a great job at telling a story that was easy to follow along with.  Dark Knight attempted to continue this story by introducing a darker side of Gotham, but in the process did way too much in too short a time.  I don't like when movies attempt to rush what they're doing, or throw too much into the 2 hour slot, and that's exactly what Dark Knight did.  In effect, it was two different movies overlapping one another.First, there was the Joker storyline - the center of the movie.  This was done well for the most part.  Then, you had the Two-Face substory, which they treated as an offshoot of the Joker storyline.  In the end it seemed like a good idea, but was horribly implemented - the Two-Face substory should have been a separate movie altogether, because that's how intricate the real story between Wayne and Dent really is.  They had significantly more history than Wayne and Joker.  It ended up being about 20 minutes total of Two-Face action, which I found unacceptable, seeing the reason Two-Face even came into existence according to the movie.  The ending wasn't too great either.My next complaint had to do with Scarecrow, played again by Cillian Murphy.  There was some association with Joker which was never fully explained, but what really bothered me was the fact that it felt like he was just thrown in without any rhyme or reason.  First it seems like he's trying to help Batman, then it seems like he's trying to help Joker.  On top of all of this it's never explained how he got out of Arkham Asylum in the first place.  Then he's just dismissed without a second glance.  Made no sense to have him in the movie.Finally, there were a lot of things going on that also were not fully explained or justified.  I can't say anything without spoiling, but suffice it to say, some characters died who didn't really die, some characters got arrested who weren't really arrested, some people get shot but not hurt, some people got stabbed but not hurt, some people just disappeared without a trace.  At the end of the day, some of the things just didn't make any sense.  Like I said, it felt like they were trying to do too much at once instead of just breaking this apart into two movies - which I can tell they could have done and ended up with two pretty good movies instead of one good one.I still recommend the movie; but it's not for everyone.  Those who were fans of the more story driven Batman Begins might be a little disappointed.  Action and CGI junkies will fall over themselves on this movie; there's a lot going on at almost all times.",4,Really it's 3 and a half stars.

659754,A1AYN3IIUNQCIA,B00005JPY0,"Melanie Edwards ""book worm""","[3, 6]","After three years, months of overwhelming hype, and a tiny dose of scandel, The Dark Knight was finally released in theaters nationwide and open the flood gates for what would become the biggest film since Titanic first sailed into theaters almost eleven years ago. Going far and beyond a simple comic book film, The Dark Knight is a twisty, layered crime drama that delivers on all fronts.Taking place directly after Batman Begins left off, we find the Caped Crusader making quite the impact on the city of Gotham. The once powerful mob has been all but erradicated and slowly the city is now reclaiming its former glory, thanks not only to Batman but also the new district attorny Harvey Dent, who is just as determined to clean up the scum of Gotham, with Bruce's love intrest Rachel Dawes assisting him in his quest, both professional and romantic. The dreams that Bruce Wayne's father once had for the city now becoming reality with every passing day. But alas, in the world of Batman, nothing good last forever. Out from the recesses of Gotham's mean streets come the sadistic and elusive criminal known only as the Joker. Armed with just a pocket full of knives and a devilish sense of humor, he seeks to destroy everything Batman and Dent have tried to build and bring it all crashing to the ground.So what can I possibly say about this film that others have? For starters, I do confirm that the film was definently worth the hype, to a point. While I agree with all the reviewers, my one problem is that, although the movie is good, the whole action and comic book aspect of it all seemed to have been skimmed out compared to the last Batman movie. And like many before this, the film does suffer from what I call 'movie jet lag', and by the last hour or so of the film, you find yourself checking your watch more often then before waiting to see when it might be over. I just feel that Lee Smith (the film's editor) could have cut out about twenty or so minutes worth of film and then it would have truley made the movie very powerfull by the last frame.Other then those few comments, the film, as a whole, is absolutly superb and definently one of the best of the year so far. Christopher Nolan and Jonathon Nolan successfully weave in numerous subplots and characters without feeling convulted or bogged down. Each actor potraying their role to a tee, with the obvious stand out, of course, being the late Heath Ledger's role of the Joker. Completley immersing himself in the role, he makes Jack Nicholson's potrayel to seem buffonish, and thank god for that, cause a villian like the Joker truley desrves a great performance and Ledger delivers on all fronts, from the voice, the twitchy movements, everything just works. Bale is able to hold his own through out the whole film and Maggie Gyllenhaal acts as a pleasant surprise in filling in for Katie Holmes, which by the way I will say that I am one of the rare few who didn't think she did a bad job in the role. But hey, that is just me.No doubt Ledger will be on the short list for Oscar consideration, but who's to stop there? I see no reason why this film should go up for some of the even bigger awards like Best Picture, Directing, and Screenplay, who agrees with me? Cuase lets face it, it has been a long time since we've had a major blockbuster in the forefronts of the Oscar race, the last of which I am referring to being the last Lord of the Rings film.There really is nothing else I can say about the film because, like stated before, everything has already been said and I would basically just be repeating everyone elses words. What you have to do is see for yourself, which by the way if you haven't seen the film yet, where have you been this whole time? Anyway, see the film for yourself and judge for yourself.

659755,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00005JPY0,Melissa Niksic,"[5, 8]","I don't want to spoil the plot of ""The Dark Knight"" for anyone, so I won't even bother trying to summarize it. I also don't want to rehash what everyone else has already said about this movie, so I'll just say that yes, it's very good, and it's definitely the best Batman movie ever made, at least so far. I'm giving this movie a five-star rating, but quite honestly, the last 45 minutes of the film were a bit disappointing.First of all, Heath Ledger steals the show in this movie. The late actor's performance as the Joker is disturbing, amusing, and completely riveting. Unfortunately, I don't think Ledger was given nearly enough screen time. There were so many other things going on in this movie, and so much time was devoted to Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart) that the Joker didn't get to hog the spotlight as much as he deserved to, in my opinion. Let me backtrack and say that all the Two-Face stuff is great, and Eckhart delivers a fantastic performance as well. However, it was just a little too much for one movie. The producers probably figured that Ledger would be around to play the Joker in future films, but sadly, that's not the case, and I don't think any actor will be able to fill Ledger's shoes in a future Batman film, so the Joker never reached his maximum potential. I think the Joker should have been the focus of the film, and we should have seen Harvey Dent turn into Two-Face at the end of ""The Dark Knight"" and then be the focus of the next Batman movie.Another thing that bothered me about the movie was Batman's strange cell phone spy machine. All those weird holograms and the Caped Crusader's glowing blue eyes were kind of annoying and definitely unnecessary. Also, both Ledger and Christian Bale got carried away with their scary, muffled character voices. I couldn't decipher a few of the Joker's lines and about a fourth of what Batman said because it sounded like both men had cotton in their mouths. WTF? Finally, ""The Dark Knight"" was just too darn long. It could easily be about 40 minutes shorter without sacrificing the integrity of the story.All my griping aside, though, this was a very entertaining film. The performances were excellent all around, the stunts were incredible, and the Joker scared the crap out of me at one point and I yelled ""S**T!"" really loud in the theatre. (That alone is a testament to the effect this film had on me!) I also really enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance as Rachel. She is a much, MUCH better actress than Katie Holmes (although I guess that really isn't saying much), who was the worst part of ""Batman Begins,"" so I'm glad that situation was rectified. (However, given what happens to Rachel in ""The Dark Knight,"" I almost wish Holmes had been in the movie so all that could have happened to her, ha ha!)Anyway, the bottom line is that, yes, ""The Dark Knight"" is a really, REALLY good movie...maybe not QUITE as good as all these hyperactive moviegoers are making it out to be, but this is definitely a film you should see on the big screen.",5,"Screw Batman, the Joker rocks!",1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,3023,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'plot', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'anyone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'trying', 'summarize', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'rehash', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'already', 'said', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'yes', 'very', 'good', 'definitely', 'best', 'Batman', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'least', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', 'five-star', 'rating', 'quite', 'honestly', 'last', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'were', 'bit', 'disappointing.First', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'show', 'movie', 'late', 'actor', 'performance', 'Joker', 'disturbing', 'amusing', 'completely', 'riveting', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Ledger', 'was', 'given', 'nearly', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'going', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'Two-Face', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Joker', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'hog', 'spotlight', 'as', 'much', 'deserved', 'opinion', 'Let', 'backtrack', 'say', 'Two-Face', 'stuff', 'great', 'Eckhart', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'movie', 'producers', 'probably', 'figured', 'Ledger', 'would', 'be', 'play', 'Joker', 'future', 'films', 'sadly', 'not', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actor', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'fill', 'Ledger', 'shoes', 'future', 'Batman', 'film', 'Joker', 'never', 'reached', 'maximum', 'potential', 'think', 'Joker', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'focus', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'turn', 'Two-Face', 'end', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'then', 'be', 'focus', 'next', 'Batman', 'thing', 'bothered', 'movie', 'was', 'Batman', 'strange', 'cell', 'phone', 'spy', 'machine', 'weird', 'holograms', 'Caped', 'Crusader', 'glowing', 'blue', 'eyes', 'were', 'kind', 'annoying', 'definitely', 'unnecessary', 'Also', 'Ledger', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'got', 'carried', 'away', 'scary', 'muffled', 'character', 'voices', 'could', ""n't"", 'decipher', 'few', 'Joker', 'lines', 'fourth', 'what', 'Batman', 'said', 'sounded', 'men', 'had', 'cotton', 'mouths', 'WTF', 'Finally', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'darn', 'long', 'could', 'easily', 'be', '40', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'sacrificing', 'integrity', 'story.All', 'griping', 'aside', 'though', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'performances', 'were', 'excellent', 'around', 'stunts', 'were', 'incredible', 'Joker', 'scared', 'crap', 'one', 'point', 'yelled', 'S**T', 'really', 'loud', 'theatre', 'alone', 'testament', 'effect', 'film', 'had', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'much', 'MUCH', 'better', 'actress', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'guess', 'really', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'who', 'was', 'worst', 'part', 'Batman', 'Begins', ""'m"", 'glad', 'situation', 'was', 'rectified', 'However', 'given', 'what', 'Rachel', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'almost', 'wish', 'Holmes', 'had', 'been', 'movie', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'ha', 'ha', 'Anyway', 'bottom', 'line', 'yes', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'really', 'REALLY', 'good', 'movie', 'maybe', 'not', 'QUITE', 'as', 'good', 'hyperactive', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'making', 'be', 'definitely', 'film', 'should', 'see', 'big', 'screen']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Add Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" to this list.As a lifelong fan of comic book superheroes, there are quite a few that i've taken to my heart: Superman, Spiderman, The Fantastic Four, X-Men,the Hulk, etc, etc. I've always loved Batman. Even through the numerous comics, which i still read to this day, the cartoons, even the campy 60s tv series, as well Tim Burton's great, dark reimagining of the mythos in the late 80s, Batman remains one of my all-time favorites.What Nolan has created with ""The Dark Knight"" cant truly be put into a few, simple sentences. Impossible. This film is one of the few true definitions of a masterpiece. It's intelligent, cold, unrelenting, extremely dark and at times disturbing and it's these adjectives that, for me, make it perfect.In the brilliant ""Batman Begins"", Nolan dissected and broke down the origin of The DC Comics vigilante, giving us a glimpse of the very twisted, emotional elements that drove one man to assume the identity of a creature of the night. He presented this as a character study of a man, seemingly normal on the outside, with wealth, power, and influence, yet tortured, driven, disturbed, trying to find a way to unleash his demons upon those who live to choose to break the law and destroy the moral fabric of ""society"".In ""The Dark Knight"", we go a few levels further....into the very bowels of HELL. This time, Batman struggles not just with the questionable choices he has made to protect Gotham City, with many people divided over how they feel about his presence, he also must face a new criminal who spreads anarchy and uncontrolled chaos all over town, the Joker.Now, we all know much has been written and said about the late Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker....BUT HE'S SOOOO GODDAMN BRILLIANT!!!! This is the Joker the way he should be portrayed. As much as i loved Jack Nicholson's Joker from Burton's '89 film, hes a punk compared to what Ledger created. Ledger's Joker is cold, calculating evil in its purest form....a man so unfeeling, so depraved, so demonic...he doesnt commit crimes for reward, notoriety, or what we'd consider intimate pleasure; he does because he simply wants to, plain and simple. He sees the world as a place to be broken and manipulated, consequences be damned. Scary, aint it? Think of the killers of Columbine, or V-Tech, even the Unabomber. Even Satan. No conscience. Evil for evil. Ledger won a very deserved posthumous Oscar for his work.The great Christian Bale is the ultimate Batman for our time. Driven, dark, cold-blooded but not without a sense of honor. He digs deeper into the psychology of Bruce Wayne, creating a portrait of someone fighting a war he might never win, a war that creates more demons and more pain than he can stop, yet doesnt give in to the monsters he opposes. Bale and Ledger are magnificent together.As great as they are, its the supporting performances that help them shine. Overall, theres not a bad performance from anyone, AT ALL. Only the best caliber of actors dominate this film. Gary Oldman's Detective James Gordon is a picture of powerful moral conviction and simple passion as he stands by Batman in the fight against crime; Michael Caine's Alfred is the deep, fatherly, yet caring voice of no-nonsense reason to Wayne/Batman; Maggie Gyllenhall makes a more intense Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes; Morgan Freeman is dignity personified as Lucius Fox. Special mention should be made, though, for Aaron Eckhart, who plays D.A. Harvey Dent/Two Face. Like Batman and Gordon, he wants to wipe out crime in Gotham City, yet he suffers from a fatal flaw: he's idealistic. Its this flaw that the Joker will exploit and twist and ultimately damage, and it leads to Dent becoming Two Face, a scarred, deranged, hopeless man broken and twisted almost as much the Joker himself.There are no easy answers in this film, with its nihilistic view of good and evil and how sometimes, even good men can be pushed to their moral limits. Thats what i loved about this film. Nothing is simple, nothing is easy, and isnt that the way life is? Films about superheroes are a mixed breed: some are great, some not. I love the original Superman w/Christopher Reeve, and Spiderman, and Bryan Singer's X-Men, yet ""Dark Knight"" is, to me, the epic for our troubled times. Intelligent, huge, well written and acted. It's a film that in my opinion as a movie-goer, has a 70s style aesthetic that will remind you of the great crime epics of that period like Serpico, Godfather 1 and 2, and even modern ones like Goodfellas and The Departed. Director Christopher Nolan takes his place among the newest generation of filmmakers who dont treat their audiences like simple-minded children. A powerful film from a powerful visionary.",5,The Greatest Superhero Film Of Our Time.,1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,5165,"['When', 'movie', 'more', 'movie', 'When', 'can', 'transcend', 'very',

In fact, after watching it a second time, I gave my DVDs of both this film and BATMAN BEGINS to my son.Why didn't I like it?(1) The movie looks great, but it is also too long.  I was checking my watch after the first 40 minutes.  I think we could have easily done without The Joker's final caper.(2) There are so many plot threads that many of are not well developed.(3) With the exception of the opening bank robbery sequence, the action sequences may be flashy, but they are also over-extended to the point where they become tiring.(4) Christian Bale may be a fine actor, but as Bruce Wayne/Batman he is so dour that he's dull.  I kept waiting for the movie to cut back to The Joker.(5) When I was watching the film in the theater, like everybody else, I was very impressed with Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker.

I really thought there was no hope for Batman after the horribly brain-numbing ""Batman & Robin,"" but I was happy to see that I was dead wrong when I saw ""Batman Begins.""  Like that film, we are given more dimensions and character complexity to what could have been just a regular superhero movie.It turns out that Batman's new gig doesn't come without its consequences, as he sees copycats trying to take matters into their own hands.  Not only that, but he's struggling with his own inner demons and doubts.  Which makes this the most opportune time for The Joker to take full advantage, and boy does he ever have some big plans in the works.  He may be a dangerous psychopath, but that's not to say that there isn't a reason for his actions.  Chaos is his talent, and with that he will do whatever it takes to corrupt squeaky clean District Attorney, Harvey Dent; and attempt to make Batman break his one and only rule.  And if he can make Gotham City tear itself to shreds, well then that's just fine with him.  All of this leads to an explosive film where answers don't come easily and actions don't come without a price.""The Dark Knight"" cannot be seen only once.  I know for me I couldn't fully appreciate it the first time because I was so blown away by Heath Ledger's menacing performance as ""The Joker"" that I couldn't focus on or appreciate anything else.  The more I watch this movie, the more I fall in love with almost every aspect.  I love how Nolan creates a great balance between action and story.  You come to know and care about the characters as if you were watching a serious drama.While the entire cast does a remarkable job, it cannot be avoided that Heath Ledger simply steals the show.  I was as fascinated by his performance as I was with Anthony Hopkins in ""Silence of the Lambs"" (and that is not a comparison that can easily be made in most cases).  You want to know everything about him and you cannot wait until you see him on the screen again.  Still, it must be stressed that the entire cast did a great job.""The Dark Knight"" on Blu-Ray looks FANTASTIC.  I actually tried to watch this on DVD (since I wasn't getting it on Blu-Ray for Christmas), and I had to stop it because I thought it was such a poor transfer, or at least that's how it looked on my TV.  On Blu-Ray, it is crystal clear.  What they've done specifically for the Blu-Ray version is enhance the aspect ratio during the sequences shot in IMAX and then return to it's normal theatrical aspect ratio.  There's a chance that this may put some people off but to the people who have seen it on IMAX, this is the way we saw it and I welcome it with open arms.  There's some nice extra features, although sadly I didn't see any deleted scenes when I was skimming the extras.  I would've loved to see some deleted scenes of Ledger.Maybe it's my imagination or I need a better surround system, but I could swear that they have cleaned up Christian Bale's voice as ""Batman"" so it isn't as overpowering as it was when we saw it in the theatres.  He's still raspy, but it seems a lot more tolerable and less distracting.  That was always something that bothered me.  Well, if they cleaned it up for the DVD and Blu-Ray release, then much kudos to them!""The Dark Knight"" is a dark and complex tale that shows that superhero movies do not have to be without substance.  You do not have to be a fan of Batman to appreciate this movie, and it's even fine to watch this without seeing ""Batman Begins.""  I really enjoyed it and it is something that I love more and more with each viewing.  Give it a chance.

Tresca ""Talien""","[6, 9]","It took a long time for me to get around to seeing Batman, but thanks to the second-run theater near me, I was finally able to see it.  It was worth the wait.This movie has been reviewed enough to make going over the plot pointless, so instead I'll focus this review on The Dark Knight's symbolism.  In chess, the Dark Knight (Batman, played by Christian Bale) is opposed by the White Knight (Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart).  They are powerful pieces in chess, capable of skipping over other pieces, striking from behind Pawns to attack opponents and then jumping away. In that sense, Knights are somewhat more chaotic than the other pieces; every other piece moves in a linear fashion, but the Knight moves forward and to the side.  Although it may seem to be one of the weaker pieces of chess, when combined with any other piece it is one of the most powerful.In a similar fashion, Harvey Dent and Batman are more powerful because of their pawns.  Dent's pawns include the media, Gordon, and a mostly corrupt police force. For Batman, it's the corporate boards, Gordon, and yes even the police force. Which is the first hint that the simple dichotomy between Batman and Dent isn't quite accurate.  Dent isn't the flipside of Batman, he's the same version with different characteristics illuminated.  Dent is Batman as a civil servant, minus the angst.Batman's true nemesis, the real White Knight, is of course the Joker (Heath Ledger). And now we truly see the opposite of what Batman stands for.  Where Batman is cold, measured, and consistent the Joker is brutal, offensive, and chaotic. And yet they are two sides of the same coin: ""You crossed the line first, sir,"" says Alfred, referring to the criminal organizations Batman hunts. ""You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation. And in their desperation they turned to a man they didn't fully understand."" Just like the police turned to Batman. Joker is a criminal form of vigilante justice.If there's an overriding message in The Dark Knight, it's that in a war of escalation, everyone loses.  The ultimate response to the Joker is a massive show of force, a sacrifice of values, and then ultimately a withdrawal from the public.  Superheroes and villains taken to an extreme are basically just terrorists blowing up a neighborhood.  The human cost is too steep for anyone to operate like that out in the open, a lesson the Joker teaches Batman the hard way.Caught in the middle are the victims: Rachel Dawes, Lucius Fox, and Dent's sanity. When Two-Face arrives, it is the cracked mirror of Batman, a hero-turned vigilante who, instead of the Knight that strikes from the shadows, moves in a straight line from one victim to another as judge, jury, and executioner. Two-Face is finally done right in this movie (better than even the cartoon, and that's saying something), and his horrific appearance is so disturbing that my wife felt it pushed the film to an R-rating.The Joker is so unnerving, so malevolent in action, and so utterly amoral in his goal of protecting the Batman-ideal, that Ledger and Nolan have made their indelible mark on the character.  This is the Joker comic book fans always knew from ""The Long Halloween"" and ""The Killing Joke."" And he's nothing to laugh about.Yes, it's long.  Yes, it's violent.  But ultimately, Nolan's masterpiece is both a meditation on the comic book genre and modern day society.  To stop a terrorist, are we willing to bend every civil liberty, burn down every forest, no matter what the cost? It's a bold, uncompromising vision that will haunt you long after the movie ends.",5,The Most Powerful Chess Piece,1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,3611,"['took', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'seeing', 'Batman', 'thanks', 'second-run', 'theater', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'see', 'was', 'worth', 'wait.This', 'movie', 'been', 'reviewed', 'enough', 'make', 'going', 'plot', 'pointless', 'instead', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'review', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'symbolism', 'chess', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Batman', 'played', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'opposed', 'White', 'Knight', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'are', 'powerful', 'pieces', 'chess', 'capable', 'skipping', 'other', 'pieces', 'striking', 'Pawns', 'attack', 'opponents', 'then', 'jumping', 'away', 'sense', 'Knights', 'are', 'somewhat', 'more', 'chaotic', 'other', 'pieces', 'other', 'piece', 'moves', 'linear', 'fashion', 'Knight', 'forward', 'side', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'one', 'weaker', 'pieces', 'chess', 'when', 'combined', 'other', 'piece', 'one', 'most', 'powerful.In', 'similar', 'fashion', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Batman', 'are', 'more', 'powerful', 'pawns', 'Dent', 'pawns', 'include', 'media', 'Gordon', 'mostly', 'corrupt', 'police', 'force', 'Batman', 'corporate', 'boards', 'Gordon', 'yes', 'even', 'police', 'force', 'first', 'hint', 'simple', 'dichotomy', 'Batman', 'Dent', ""n't"", 'quite', 'accurate', 'Dent', ""n't"", 'flipside', 'Batman', 'same', 'version', 'different', 'characteristics', 'illuminated', 'Dent', 'Batman', 'civil', 'servant', 'angst.Batman', 'true', 'nemesis', 'real', 'White', 'Knight', 'course', 'Joker', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'now', 'truly', 'see', 'opposite', 'what', 'Batman', 'Where', 'Batman', 'cold', 'measured', 'consistent', 'Joker', 'brutal', 'offensive', 'chaotic', 'yet', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'coin', 'crossed', 'line', 'first', 'sir', 'Alfred', 'referring', 'criminal', 'organizations', 'Batman', 'hunts', 'squeezed', 'hammered', 'point', 'desperation', 'desperation', 'turned', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'Just', 'police', 'turned', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'criminal', 'form', 'vigilante', 'justice.If', 'overriding', 'message', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'war', 'escalation', 'everyone', 'loses', 'ultimate', 'response', 'Joker', 'massive', 'show', 'force', 'sacrifice', 'values', 'then', 'ultimately', 'withdrawal', 'public', 'Superheroes', 'taken', 'extreme', 'are', 'basically', 'just', 'terrorists', 'blowing', 'up', 'neighborhood', 'human', 'cost', 'too', 'steep', 'anyone', 'operate', 'out', 'open', 'lesson', 'Joker', 'Batman', 'hard', 'way.Caught', 'middle', 'are', 'victims', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'Dent', 'sanity', 'When', 'Two-Face', 'cracked', 'mirror', 'Batman', 'hero-turned', 'vigilante', 'who', 'instead', 'Knight', 'shadows', 'moves', 'straight', 'line', 'one', 'victim', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'Two-Face', 'finally', 'done', 'right', 'movie', 'better', 'even', 'cartoon', 'saying', 'something', 'horrific', 'appearance', 'so', 'disturbing', 'wife', 'felt', 'pushed', 'film', 'R-rating.The', 'Joker', 'so', 'unnerving', 'so', 'malevolent', 'action', 'so', 'utterly', 'amoral', 'goal', 'protecting', 'Batman-ideal', 'Ledger', 'Nolan', 'have', 'made', 'indelible', 'mark', 'character', 'Joker', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'always', 'knew', 'Long', 'Halloween', 'Killing', 'Joke', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'about.Yes', 'long', 'Yes', 'violent', 'ultimately', 'Nolan', 'masterpiece', 'meditation', 'comic', 'book', 'genre', 'modern', 'day', 'society', 'stop', 'terrorist', 'are', 'willing', 'bend', 'civil', 'liberty', 'burn', 'down', 'forest', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'bold', 'uncompromising', 'vision', 'will', 'haunt', 'long', 'movie']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659773,A2V2XET6WEPJ0Q,B00005JPY0,Michael Romero,"[1, 2]","In the last scene of ""Batman Begins"" Batman flips over a card and it turnes out 2 B the Joker Card. When I left the theatre I thirsted for a sequal & when I found out that there was going 2 B 1 I kept going on the Internet 2 C who they cast as The Joker. It turned out Heath Ledger was cast as The Joker. As many Batman fans were back then I questioned whether or not Heath could play The Joker. It wasn't until I saw the 1st trailer that I started bouncing off the walls and began counting down the days until the film's release.Then Heath died, I as many fans out there mourned his death and wondered if he had completely finished filming The Dark Knight. WBs put everyone's fears 2 rest & assured everyone that the film was finished filming & was set 2 B released as scheduled.After I saw Iron-Man I wondered how could TDK top this movie. I found out the day of its release. 1st off The film leaves you @ each & every moment on the edge of your seat (I swear I thought I was going 2 fall off my chair). Christian Bale still proved that he was indeed the greatest Batman of all time. Aaron Eckhart gave a gr8 performance as Harvey Dent & even gave a chilling performance as Two-Face (that made Tommy Lee Jone's performance in ""Batman Forever"" look really bad). Gary Oldman continued 2 WOW me as lieutenant Gordon(who later becomes Commisioner). Maggie Gyllenhal made Katie Holmes look really bad as she took on the role of Rachel Dawes (That Holmes played in ""Batman Begins"").But, I think that the performance that really overwhelmed all of these gr8 actors was Heath's Portrayal of The Joker. Now I must admit I loved Jack Nicholson as The Joker in the 1989 movie ""Batman."" However, after seeing this movie Heath made Jack Nicholson's Joker look like 1 of those clowns that entertains @ children's B-day parties. Heath's Joker was Dark & extremely disturbed and loved causing mayhem in Gotham by blowing up hospitals in a nurse's outfit (LOL), poisoning the police commissioner with sulfuric acid, making a ""Pencil Disappear,"" & blowing up the Major crimes unit building w/ a bomb implanted inside another prisoner. Heath's Joker looked more like he's represented in the comics 2day. He has no backstory (however, U find out bits & pieces of his backstory in some of his scenes), he's deadly, & even more insane than ever before. His look was extremely different also he had a carved smile on his face & long greasy green hair, & his make-up looked like it had been applied & didn't look like he had fallen into a vat of chemicals. Oh, and I almost 4got 2 mention this but this Joker gets the last laugh.The movie is centered around 3 men: Batman/Bruce Wayne, Jim Gordon, & Harvey Dent. Joker sets his sight out on all 3 men but mostly on Harvey Dent & in a way ""turns"" Harvey in2 Two-Face & leads in2 an emotional confrontation Btween all 3 men.This movie makes Batman face the ? if whether or not he is really doing any good in Gotham or if he is the cause of all the mayhem that is happening in Gotham City.2 months after the movie's release it has made over $500 million dollars making it the 2nd highest grossing movie of all time(beating all Star Wars films WOW)but still comming short 2 Titanic. Now talks of a 3rd Batman movie R comming up but 2 me it really doesen't matter if they come out w/ a 3rd movie or not. ""The Dark Knight"" left you w/ a conclusion and unlike ""Batman Begins"" didn't leave U wanting a sequal.Now I know I probably wasted a whole page writing about my favorite movie of all time but all I have 2 say about it now is that if U didn't get 2 C this movie in theatres see it now buy the DVD, sit back & B prepared 2 B WOWED. The movie is about 3hrs. long but believe me there's so much going on it doesen't even feel like its 3hrs.

While not quite as good as Batman Begins,The Dark Knight is clearly a movie that gets everything right. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is beyond spectacular. It's worth watching this movie for the Joker alone because Ledger is that good in the role. The Joker has always been the strongest Batman villain and the Dark Movie is no exception. The plot itself is one of the best and most complex we've had in the Batman franchise. And the character development of Batman is awesome. In a way,Batman makes a major sacrifice at the end of the film because he believes he can be most useful to Gotham by being the fall guy. And like Batman Begins,The Dark Knight is a dark and serious movie from start to finish. Nolan's Batman films get away from the horrible campiness and stupidity of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin and return Batman to dark realm of the Burton films. But Nolan's films take it to another level because they feel more realistic than Burton's.

659776,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,B00005JPY0,"Michelle L. Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[2, 3]","Maybe it was the hype of the movie, or Heath Ledger's untimely and tragic death, or both, but I was anticipating MORE. Ok, maybe it was the time of day that I watched it (almost 10pm) and I was tired, and a tad bit sleepy, or maybe I should have seen it on the big screen, in the theater, or maybe Bale's brush with the law distracted from the movie (although I don't think people remember that), but I was just expecting a little more. Now don't get me wrong, I am not saying that it wasn't good, but it just didn't knock me off my feet, like the first Batman did. It seemed that Bruce Wayne's character was really developed in the first one (Batman Begins), while it wasn't this one (he seemed at times to be just going thru the motions). I will admit that in Batman Begins we learn the genesis of Batman and his life as Bruce Wayne so there was no need to restate it, but none of the other characters were really developed in this one, we only got snippets into what led to their development. For example, you did begin to understand who the Joker was, but I don't think that there was anything to really explain some of his psychotic behavior besides the fact that he was crazy. The same goes for Dent's character...yes, I understood why he became ""Two-Faced), but I didn't think enough was there really explain how a person who fought so hard for justice would suddenly (although the loss of a loved one could do it) turn so wrong.Quickly, I will add to my list of what I liked and disliked about the movie.1. While I don't think Batman ""evolved"" much, I do enjoy how Christian Bale plays the role. He effortlessly waivers between being a ""playboy"" (Bruce Wayne) and brooding/conflicted superhero (Batman). What I really liked about Bale's portrayal is that you can feel the internal conflict between being a superhero and being yourself. He constantly seems to be questioning should he continue his crime fighting ways/living with a secret/alone/no tangible family (with the exception of Alfred and Fox) or settle down and start a family (virtually giving it all up). I would seem being Batman costs Wayne everything including his love. And while he struggles to balance his desire to save ""Gotham"", with his desire to be normal, you sympathize. And while his dilemma is not different than Spiderman's, Superman's or any other super hero, you like his take on it.2. I know that people are going to comment, but I preferred Katie Holmes over Maggie Gyllenhal as Rachel Dawes. I thought Katie bought a certain innocence that Maggie attempted to recreate but didn't do it successfully. Did that merit my average rating? No. Who played Rachel's character really didn't make a difference, although her character was vital to the storyline and explained the evolution of ""Two-face"".3. I still enjoyed Gary Oldman as the dedicated Police Lieutenant, and although I was saddened by his character's fate, I definitely think that he was one of the shining stars in the first Batman and in this one.4. To me, Heath Ledger gave an interesting spin to the Joker character. While Jack Nicholson was an effective Joker years ago, Heath seemed more tortured because he was not just a pretty face in makeup (with a drawn on smile), but a disfigured and relatively angry bad guy with issues.5. Gadget man Lucius Fox (played by the earring wearing Morgan Freeman) was brilliant and captivating as usual. I especially like the relationship between he and Batman. When the caped crusader (or is it masked) asks him to ""create a suit where I can turn my head"", I smiled. There definitely seems to be a mutual respect and admiration between them.6. Michael Caine, as Bruce Wayne's handy assistant (Alfred), and guardian of Batman's truth, was equally brilliant.7. Aaron Eckhart, as the dedicated and incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent was great, as was genesis to ""Two Face"".While I know some don't think this is necessarily the place to ""review"" movies, I do think that the ""average"" consumer would want to know more than ""was the quality of this DVD worth buying""? When I look in Amazon, I want to know both what the movie was about and the quality of the product. Meaning I am buying the movie, not just the DVD itself. With that said, I have found that unless you buy the two disc editions, you are always going to be cheated on the extras. In the past, the extras were almost as good as the movie itself, but now, unless you pay a little extra (note the difference between $15 or so dollars, and $24 dollars), you aren't going to get the alternate endings, outtakes, interviews, etc.. So if you want all that, you will have to pony up the extra bucks to get it. I for one find that once I see a movie, I rarely pull it out (unless it is one of my absolute favorites) again and re-watch it although I have paid the money, which explains why I now go to ""on demand"" or rent it.But after all is said and done, I would give this a solid 3.5 or 4.",3,Torn!

I also remember that during Frank Miller's ""Dark Knight"" comics, in which he essentially reinvented and revitalized Bob Kane's character, there was talk floating of Clint Eastwood playing the character, which would have been AMAZING. The ""Dark Knight"" Batman was older, and in many ways, just as messed up as The Joker. Eastwood could have nailed it, but it never hapened.""The Dark Knight"" was released under the shadw of the untimely and sad passing of Heath Ledger. Ledger didn't do the campy, jovial buffoon of the late-sixties DC comics era, and he didn't do the over-the-top, scenery-chewing nutcase that Jack Nicholson portrayed in the Tim Burton film with Michael Keaton. Ledger's portrayal of the the character is based on a man who is GONE, and ain't comin' BACK.Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nothing more than a placeholder for Batman. Michael Keaton did well with the brooding, angry, insular world of the millionaire crimefighter, but Bale's Wayne lacks any true joy, charisma, joie de vivre...he's just marking time before the next time he puts on the suit.It's really Ledger's film. He's the reason to watch, he drives the plot, he has the best lines, he is the protagonist. He plays the character as if he's constantly on meds, flipping out only one time in the film (and when he does it's pretty chilling). If Cesar Romero played the role as Bozo the Clown, Ledger played it as John Wayne Gacy.It really is a decent Batman offering. I thought the first Bale film was weak, and I haven't seen the third.

659781,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00005JPY0,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Anyone who is reading this by now has likely seen the movie multiple times.  On the off chance that you are one who has not, these are my thoughts.As much as Batman Begins resurrected the Batman movie franchise, this one proved the series could sustain without a letdown.  While I thought that the story in this one was the weakest overall in the Nolan Batman trilogy (I think both Batman Begins and Dark Knight Rises have better ""beginning to end"" stories in their respective movies), Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker made this movie an instant classic.  He not only stole every scene he was in, he owned every scene he was in.  He played the psychopath perfectly, and gave you the impression that he was insane yet totally in control of what he was doing.  It was not only the best portrayals of the Joker ever (at least in a tv/film version of Batman) but one of the best acting performances ever.I would have liked for the movie to use Two Face more than they did.  I think Aaron Eckhart did a good job with the character, but he was really only in the last 45 min or so of the movie.  Personally I would have liked them to keep him alive but locked away and then revisit the character in Dark Knight Rises.  I think he would have been perfect in the role they gave Dr. Crane in Dark Knight rises (or even an expanded version of that role).  That said however, I think they did a good job with the character for the limited time he was used.I think what is great about this movie is that it appeals to a wider audience than just fans of superhero movies.  I think that the first Batman movie back in 1989 did that, as well as Batman Return (although to a lesser extent).  After that, only hardcore superhero and/or comic book fans were going to be the ones seeing the Batman movies.  Everyone knows how Batman Forever and Batman and Robin nearly killed off the franchise.  Because of Nolan's great storytelling, the superb acting and bringing an element of realism to the story (as much as possible anyway) that had been lost, this movie is well worth adding to your collection.",5,A great movie,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,2089,"['Anyone', 'who', 'reading', 'now', 'likely', 'seen', 'movie', 'multiple', 'times', 'off', 'chance', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'are', 'thoughts.As', 'much', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'resurrected', 'Batman', 'movie', 'franchise', 'one', 'proved', 'series', 'could', 'sustain', 'letdown', 'thought', 'story', 'one', 'was', 'weakest', 'overall', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'trilogy', 'think', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'have', 'better', 'beginning', 'end', 'stories', 'respective', 'movies', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Joker', 'made', 'movie', 'instant', 'classic', 'not', 'only', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'owned', 'scene', 'was', 'played', 'psychopath', 'perfectly', 'gave', 'impression', 'was', 'insane', 'yet', 'totally', 'control', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'portrayals', 'Joker', 'ever', 'least', 'tv/film', 'version', 'Batman', 'one', 'best', 'acting', 'performances', 'ever.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'use', 'Two', 'Face', 'more', 'did', 'think', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'character', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'last', '45', 'min', 'so', 'movie', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'keep', 'alive', 'locked', 'away', 'then', 'revisit', 'character', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'role', 'gave', 'Dr.', 'Crane', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'even', 'expanded', 'version', 'role', 'said', 'however', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'character', 'limited', 'time', 'was', 'used.I', 'think', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'appeals', 'wider', 'audience', 'just', 'fans', 'superhero', 'movies', 'think', 'first', 'Batman', 'movie', 'back', '1989', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'Batman', 'Return', 'lesser', 'extent', 'only', 'hardcore', 'superhero', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'ones', 'seeing', 'Batman', 'movies', 'Everyone', 'how', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'nearly', 'killed', 'off', 'franchise', 'Nolan', 'great', 'storytelling', 'superb', 'acting', 'bringing', 'element', 'realism', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'anyway', 'had', 'been', 'lost', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Gotham City is at the mercy of mobsters, its criminal justice system inadequate to deal with the scope of the corruption, when a new menace comes along: The Joker (Heath Ledger) is an extravagant sociopath and self-described ""agent of chaos"". Crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) cracks down on organized crime, and the crime bosses turn naively to The Joker to save them and kill Batman (Christian Bale). But The Joker cares nothing for money; he only cares for chaos.""The Dark Knight"" is thematically ambitious but not quite successful. The Joker is a character without motive, which makes him a two-dimensional villain. His role is purely to represent the chaos that everyone, even the criminals, fears: random violence, theft, and destruction, without any root in any recognizable value system. Batman, police Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and D.A. Harvey Dent grapple with decisions about how far they should go to stop The Joker. At what cost order? Batman is a vigilante free to abandon his self-imposed codes of behavior if he chooses. Dent could let someone else do the dirty work and remain unscathed. These are relevant issues in today's world, but the film handles them with more convolution than complexity.It smartly recognizes that modern people fear unpredictability more than anything. But as for what values people should be willing to throw out the window to restore order, or to give the appearance of stability, well, the characters change their minds a lot, and so does the film. At 2 1/2 hours, it's much too long. It should lose some of the talkiness. The Joker suffers from being simply a thematic device. I found him unpleasant to watch until his havoc-wreaking became perversely charming. At least he looks like he's having fun. Batman's efforts to disguise his voice are distracting, and one action sequence in a building under construction is completely incoherent.

I wont hesitate to say that I loved the first two Batman movies. I wont claim that they are flawless(no superhero movie is) but they were fun and when I have a ball watching a movie I'm willing to look past its flaws. The Joel Shumacher movies made me roll my eyes but later on those movies became a guilty pleasure because their bizarre awfulness lends a certain charm to them(In a what-the-hell-was-Joel-thinking way). I didnt know of Batman Begins existence until a friend mentioned it in 2007. I saw it for free and fell in love with it instantly. Nobody at the job that I had mentioned it, nobody I knew mentioned it and I dont really watch TV so I would have never seen a trailer for it. Since then I have the DVD and have seen it six times about to be seven. This movie on the other hand.... I had a feeling this movie would fall short of Batman Begins but I didnt think it was going to be this bad. This movie should have been called Jokers Wild because it was more about The Joker than Batman. Batman seemed to be an afterthought in his own movie.TDK doenst have much of a plot except for The Joker(Heath Ledger) causing mayhem in Gotham and Batman(Christian Bale) and Commissioner Gordon(Gary Oldman) team up with the Gotham police force to stop him. Christian Bale is boring as both Batman and Bruce Wayne and that voice... Does he really think he sounds menacing? He sounds like Nick Nolte doing a really bad impression of Tone Loc. He spends the majority of this movie with an unintelligible look on his face that screams hangover. A huge change from the phenomenal Batman/Bruce Wayne that he played previously in Batman Begins.Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman(who all did well previously in Batman Begins) sleepwalk through THE ENTIRE MOVIE! Aaron Eckhardt is bland as both Harvey Dent and Two-Face. His Two-Face is a level higher than Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face but only by default(which is nothing to brag about really). Maggie Gyllenhaal is weak as Rachel Dawes, playing her like some high school girl swooning over Bruce Wayne. Arguably she has done better work in the past but her Rachel Dawes comes across as a silly little girl in dire need of better priorities. Totally different from the Rachel Dawes of Batman Begins. Heath Ledger is not bad as The Joker but he did not deserve the obscene amount of hype he got. His character was a one-dimensional nut job who when he is not killing people he is foolishly philosophizing like some stupid emo-goth freak(I was ready for him to start talking about the misery of human existence while going through a pack of smokes). This Joker has no back story, rarely smiles or laughs and is predictable to a fault. So how exactly is he better than Jack Nicholson's Joker? In Burton's movie, The Joker had a back story. He was more than some wacko killer and you knew from the beginning that he is going to do his crimes with style. He is a tad goofy but unpredictable. He is fun to watch. In TDK he has no style or surprises. He just kills people and he is not having any fun doing it. YAWN!Flaws, contradictions and just plain plot holes in The Dark Knight:*Too many meaningless subplots that never connect*People get punched, kicked, bitten by dogs and knocked around by explosions and walk away without cuts, bruises, bumps or blood*Does Bruce love Rachel Dawes or not?*Batman is an expert in Martial Arts but is knocked on his rear end easily by The Joker*A convict carrying a bomb in his stomach without setting off the metal detectors or dying from the surgery* A guy carries a gun with him to court(without setting off any metal detectors) in order to shoot Harvey Dent(can't a modicum of reality seep into the story? Sheesh!)*The sonar imaging using 30 million mobile phones in Gotham is the biggest WTF moment in movie history. This scene not only taxes the credibility of the story being told, it also contradicts the reality that Christopher Nolan was trying to produce throughout the film. Do the people that fawn over this movie realize that?* Too lengthy for its own good and at the same time not lengthy enough for the amount of material in it. There was too much going on in this movie but not enough time was dedicated to each part.* The trip to Hong Kong to nab some non sequitur character was just pointless. He wouldnt be missed if that scene was cut.* The whole mob subplot was completely superfluous and should have been cut.* What happens after the Joker crashes the party? This is one of the many scenes that just ends and leaves you uncertain about what happens afterward.* The Joker explaining to Harvey that he didnt kill Rachel when we all know he did* Harvey taking him into consideration* Where are the scenes that show Bruce Wayne wanting to quit being Batman and live a normal life?*Why does he feel that Harvey Dent should be his successor?* Why call him the Dark Knight when he is willing to throw in the towel so easily?*How does Harvey know about Batman wanting to quit being Batman someday?*How does Commissioner Gordon know about why Batman does what he does at the end of the movie?* The weirdo on TV that claims he knows who Batman really is* What were the main characters of TDK up to at the climax of the movie?* The climax was not built from the narrative. It was invented. Even the ending of this movie seemed tacked on.*Nobody notices thousands of gallons of flammable liquid in the engine rooms on the ferry boats?*How did The Joker wire the largest hospital in Gotham with explosives without nobody noticing? Take as long as you like figuring that one out. Grab a snickers while you're at it.*The whole hospital is evacuated except for Harvey Dent.*SWAT protecting a high profile criminal with police all around but The Joker comes around in a trailer truck and they all become bumbling idiots unable to protect the person they are transporting.* Batman going by Commissioner Gordon's house to see his family served no purpose since the audience knows that Gordon is only faking his death to lure the Joker out.*Commissioner Gordon's faking his death scheme doesnt work. He would have had to know what street The Joker was going to shoot him at and where the shot was going to be fired in order to jump in front of the bullet.* The Joker's henchman are made of the psychos and schizos from Arkham Asylum. The fact that they are competent and obedient puts a bigger strain on the credibility of the story being told.*The Joker dressing up as a nurse in an EVACUATED hospital(I know what your response is going to be).*Even if some of the hospital staff didnt leave right away who could The Joker possibly fool looking the way he does?I could go on but this review would be a lot longer than it needs to be. Such obvious mistakes kill the claims that this is the greatest superhero movie of all time. Batman Begins had its flaws but still managed to be a great movie. This movie has none of what made Batman Begins entertaining and interesting. It is a colossal bore that really believes its a moral compass but all the pseudo-philosophical and pseudo-intellectual rambling end up with somebody getting punched or shot. I could have easily looked past its over the top obvious flaws if it was fun but its not. This movie ruined Batman for me and made me lower my stance on movies that I panned before. Dont get me wrong. A bad movie is still a bad movie but if it offers you some form of relief(in the form of unintentional laughter) then its a lot better than this dull pompous spectacle. You know a movie is bad when it makes you reflect on previous movies that you bashed in hopes of seeing if you were fair in your judgment. TDK was written by a writer that gave us such gems as Nick Fury Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Blade Trinity and Death Warrant(a movie about a killer that wouldnt die) and a director that has given us much better work previously. The action sequences suck(a bunch of annoying quick cuts shots and 360 degree camera angles like this was some Michael Bay flick), the dialogue is a joke and story is convoluted to a fault. Now I know that this review will get 300 unhelpful votes and lots of vitriolic comments. Go ahead Im not going to respond to you or read your comments but feel free to vent all you like. I wouldnt want to deprive you of the only thing you have left in this world: your pride. As for the people that didnt fall for the hype(not just for this movie but any movie) continue being who you are and would somebody PLEASE tap the emperor on the shoulder and tell him he is wearing no clothes!",1,Why so happy?

659787,A2UL0A8GJB4318,B00005JPY0,mljkb,"[4, 6]","It's easy to imagine Batophiles, like myself, experiencing nirvana when watching ""The Dark Knight:"" director Christopher Nolan and his sibling writing partner Jonathon deftly weave in influences from Batman tales spun from the likes of Alan Moore, Frank Miller and the team Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale.  Tidbits from ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" ""The Killing Joke"" and ""The Long Halloween"" find their way into the narrative, and long-time fans can spend many early morning hours dissecting all the homages from past scribes of the caped crusader.  And it's that respect and admiration for the legacy of the Batman character that powers ""The Dark Knight.""  No mere hodgepodge of all the material that predated it, this film instead draws strength from Batman's rich legacy, marshalling all the weight of nearly 80 years of literary gold (and not the previous movies in the fanchise, sans ""Begins"") to create a movie of undiluted power and astounding resonance.  It's all there: the Gotham mob seeking to maintain control on the city's infrastructure, a disease of corruption that infects into the police force, legal system and corporate boardrooms and that fearsome angel of vengeance known as Batman, who tirelessly protects the city from destroying itself.  34 year old Christian Bale, reprising his role as Batman, digs deeper than anyone has ever dared dreamed, finding the wounded soul of a traumatized boy who's stoically willing pay the cost to shoulder the stinking sins and nightmarish horrors of a city gone to hell; no matter how high the cost to himself.But Batman's good intentions backfire.  At first, all seems well, as the mob is running scared from a police force led by the straight-backed Lt. Jim Gordon (a stupendous Gary Oldman, who makes virtue look cool) and a bull-dozing new DA named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, given the trickiest role as a righteous man doomed to fall), flanked by Bruce Wayne's old flame Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gylennhall, replacing Katie Holmes).  The besieged mob, desperate, turns to the anti-batman, a gleefully anarchic and sadistic psychopath who sees pure moral and ethical chaos as the only true way to live.  Everything else is a sick joke.  In other words, they turned to the Joker.  As played by the late Heath Ledger, this Joker makes Jack Nicholson look tame, even cuddly.  He smears his face with moldy looking make-up, talks with a sneering croak, tells contradictory stories of how he got his ghastly facial scars and works hard to convince everyone that he a loose cannon reacting instead of planning in advance to events around him, all evidence to the contrary.  This isn't so much the anti-batman as the anti-christ manifested as a hysterically happy bringer of existential terrorism and destruction.  As for Ledger, in his last complete role, he turns a performance as the Joker that ranks with the finest performances, by anyone, anywhere, in history.From there, ""The Dark Knight"" begins a crescendo of operatic intensity, masterfully orchestrated by Nolan, who here stakes a claim as the best director of his generation.  He chronicles a struggle not just for the turf of Gotham City but for its very soul, and you'll be riveted at the sheer amount of directorial skill Nolan amasses to accomplish this.  The Joker seeks to tear down all that Batman, Gordon, Dent and Bruce Wayne's parents have fought and died for.  Gotham and its knights of all shades are pushed to the limit, facing the prospect of compromising their own souls and ethics to stop the demonic jester from hell.  No character will emerge unscathed, some will perish and evil won't be defeated entirely.  It's a rousing, complex and emotionally draining ride.

659791,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00005JPY0,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","In one of the great sequels, Christopher Nolan returns at the helm of middle segment of his trilogy.  This time joined by his brother, Jonathan Nolan as co-writer of the screenplay, Batman (Christian Bale) gets even darker.  The key players return, except that Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes.This time out we get a picture of Batman's most ardent villain, The Joker.  This Joker is played by Heath Ledger in his Oscar winning performance.  After watching this version earlier I went back to watch the first (and best) of the earlier live action ""Batman"" (1990) films to catch Jack Nicholson's Joker.  At the time, I thought both the film and Nicholson were very good.  Now Jack's Joker seems quaint.  Ledger brings the black humor, but does it in a very sinister fashion.  Pay attention to the earlier scenes when Ledger as the Joker confronts the mobsters in their roost.  This guy is scary good and sets the tone for the later more amplified scenes.As Batman and now Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) face off against The Joker, they confront a different kind of villain.  He's not concerned so much about power or money.  He doesn't want anything other than chaos.  The film's plot involves the good guys not only having to deal with the maniacal Joker but with the fleecing of the financial wealth stolen from Gotham.  In a great sequence, The Bat chases Lau (Chin Han), a Chinese kingpin who had returned to his presumed safety in Hong Kong.  Without giving away too much, the kidnapping is beautifully staged, if improbable, and has an appropriately cutesy conclusion.If there is a fault with ""The Dark Knight,"" one could argue that the long chase sequence involving the kidnapping of Dent falls into the ""been there done that"" category and takes away from the tone of the film.  The ending places Batman into an even darker corner which sets up the final act of the trilogy.  Make no mistake this is a well made film on every level, but Heath Ledger's performance is what makes it exceptional.  This was my favorite film of 2008.This Blu ray disc is a complicated transfer but not problematic for most viewers.  The original film had certain scenes shot in an IMAX format which is larger and has a different aspect ratio than the majority of the film.

659792,A3MADEFLE1QN0,B00005JPY0,molly,"[5, 7]","Walking into the theater at one in the morning to see this movie, my heart was pounding as though pumping sparks - I had never in my life anticipated a movie this highly, nor been so excited to see it and certain that it would be fantastic. And of course, in normal circumstances, I would have been setting myself up for disappointment.And yet...The Dark Knight so far surpassed my wildest hopes and expectations, so grandly fulfilled the enormous hype it set up for itself and then some, that I can't think of enough words to praise it. Dark and deep, filled with pathos and action, and possessing some of the best writing, best cinematography, best directing, and best acting seen in any movie, this may be my favorite film...ever.But ah, yes, the acting.At the risk of parroting back the sentiments of every other review currently on this page, Heath Ledger may be the greatest villain in film history (he is in my eyes, anyway) and most certainly takes the award for greatest comic book movie villain. (Even though calling this film a ""comic book movie"" is vastly incongruous with what it truly is). From the moment he appears onscreen, from his first ""pencil trick"" to the line I used for the title of this review, Ledger IS the Joker, and the Joker is the most menacing, disgusting, fascinating villain I have ever seen played out onscreen. He's the agent of chaos and disorder. He has no desire for money, for power - all he wants is for people to realize how truly depraved they are, and despair. Because of this, some of his favorite jokes are giving people the choice of ""who to save?"" and ""kill or be killed"". He considers himself the only truly sane person in the world, the only one willing to accept his human nature (hence the telling lines near the beginning - ""You're crazy!"" ""No. No, I'm, I'm not."")And opposite the Joker, trying to maintain order and bring peace and safety to Gotham, is Batman. The Dark Knight. Christian Bale plays the tormented vigilante wonderfully, as he struggles between his desire for a normal life and the knowledge that the Joker will keep killing, keep destroying, keep wreaking havoc, all because it keeps Batman in the game with him.The rest of the cast is remarkable, too, and they all shine in their roles - most notably Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent (both of whom deserve massive accolades in their own right), but also Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman as Rachel, Alfred, and Lucius Fox.Oh, and did I mention the score? Truly beautiful, powerful, and haunting music, with a strong feeling of danger and things hovering on the brink.Overall, I don't think I have ever seen a more perfect movie than this, nor one that hit so many emotional chords. Themes of human redemption, strength and endurance, and sacrifice are shown again and again, never too heavy-handed. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. It's a masterpiece, a true perfection, and worth every bit of hype it's gotten, and then some. This is a true classic, one to be remembered. This is how movies should be.Rating: Masterpiece",5,"""...I just want my phone call.""",1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,3107,"['Walking', 'theater', 'one', 'morning', 'see', 'movie', 'heart', 'was', 'pounding', 'pumping', 'sparks', 'had', 'never', 'life', 'anticipated', 'movie', 'highly', 'been', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'certain', 'would', 'be', 'fantastic', 'course', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'setting', 'up', 'disappointment.And', 'yet', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'so', 'far', 'surpassed', 'wildest', 'hopes', 'expectations', 'so', 'grandly', 'fulfilled', 'enormous', 'hype', 'set', 'up', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'enough', 'words', 'praise', 'Dark', 'deep', 'filled', 'pathos', 'action', 'possessing', 'best', 'writing', 'best', 'cinematography', 'best', 'directing', 'best', 'acting', 'seen', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'film', 'ever.But', 'ah', 'yes', 'acting.At', 'risk', 'parroting', 'back', 'sentiments', 'other', 'review', 'currently', 'page', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'villain', 'film', 'history', 'eyes', 'anyway', 'most', 'certainly', 'award', 'greatest', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'villain', 'Even', 'calling', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'vastly', 'incongruous', 'what', 'truly', 'moment', 'onscreen', 'first', 'pencil', 'trick', 'line', 'used', 'title', 'review', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'Joker', 'most', 'menacing', 'disgusting', 'fascinating', 'villain', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'played', 'out', 'onscreen', 'agent', 'chaos', 'disorder', 'desire', 'money', 'power', 'people', 'realize', 'how', 'truly', 'depraved', 'are', 'despair', 'favorite', 'jokes', 'are', 'giving', 'people', 'choice', 'who', 'save', 'kill', 'be', 'killed', 'only', 'truly', 'sane', 'person', 'world', 'only', 'one', 'willing', 'accept', 'human', 'nature', 'hence', 'telling', 'lines', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'crazy', 'No', 'No', ""'m"", ""'m"", 'not', 'Joker', 'trying', 'maintain', 'order', 'bring', 'peace', 'safety', 'Gotham', 'Batman', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'tormented', 'vigilante', 'wonderfully', 'desire', 'normal', 'life', 'knowledge', 'Joker', 'will', 'keep', 'killing', 'keep', 'destroying', 'keep', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'Batman', 'game', 'him.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'remarkable', 'too', 'shine', 'roles', 'most', 'notably', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'whom', 'deserve', 'massive', 'accolades', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Rachel', 'Alfred', 'Lucius', 'Fox.Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'score', 'Truly', 'beautiful', 'powerful', 'haunting', 'music', 'strong', 'feeling', 'danger', 'things', 'hovering', 'brink.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'more', 'perfect', 'movie', 'one', 'hit', 'so', 'many', 'emotional', 'chords', 'Themes', 'human', 'redemption', 'strength', 'endurance', 'sacrifice', 'are', 'shown', 'again', 'again', 'never', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'enough', 'masterpiece', 'true', 'perfection', 'worth', 'bit', 'hype', 'gotten', 'then', 'true', 'classic', 'one', 'be', 'remembered', 'how', 'movies', 'should', 'be.Rating', 'Masterpiece']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

The Dark Knight is the best film of the year (so far), with some impressive acting from everyone, a top notch screenplay, a great musical score and a little someone called Heath Ledger. Make that a BIG someone. His Joker performance has been praised by critics and fans over and over again by now, and he deserves every bit of the constant accolades. His presence dominates the whole film. The first time you see movie, you really have no idea when he is going to pop up and bring his bag of crazy chaos. This is stuff of legends folks.Christian Bale is in full gloom mode here, but he pulls it off as only an actor of his calibur could. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a better actress than Katie Holmes, so that was a good trade-off. She did get on my nerves at times, and I hate to say it, but it is hard to believe all these men would want her. I thought Aaron Eckhart made a very good Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are all amazing actors and elevate the supporting roles they are given.Kudos to the limited use of CGI and attention to detail from director, Christopher Nolan.The Dark Knight will remind you of the epic crime drama Heat at times, but it doesn't lose the crowd pleasing action of a comic book film. Just wait until you see The Joker's disappearing pencil trick. Maybe I'm a little twisted, but it brought a huge smile to my face.The Blu-ray and DVD release will likely break all sales records and I already have mine pre-ordered.

659796,A2X68A4CORTII2,B00005JPY0,Monkey Deathcar,"[9, 22]","I realize I'm an outlier in this one, but The Dark Knight was easily the most overrated movie I've seen in years. There are so many great ideas stuffed into the picture but the film never comes together. In this case, the whole really is less than the sum of its parts.The grim, realistic portrayal of the Batman mythos is an interesting idea; I'm just not sure it works. Even in the comics, Batman was always somewhat larger than life, like a pulp fiction character. By treating Batman like an actual person, Nolan invites the audience to question all of the implausibilities in the story. And there are many.For example, at one point the Joker kidnaps two key characters, but the kidnapping occurs entirely off-screen - we're just told the Joker has them and left to wonder how that happened. Batman also uses cell phones to spy on all of Gotham City; this is just not possible. The Joker's henchmen are supposedly insane, but they manage to pull off several daring heists. Then the Joker kills them, which seems like it would discourage new recruits. You get the idea.If Nolan treated the material like a comic book, none of this illogic would matter. But, he treats the entire movie like a realistic crime drama ... until it's inconvenient, then he glosses over major plot points with comic book logic. I guess my big problem is that Nolan wants to have it both ways. The Dark Knight is gritty and realistic at times, but also expects us the audience to overlook some huge inconsistencies and major plotholes. It just didn't work for me.The whole tone of the movie is so dark and grim it started to become oppressive after awhile. I was never a fan of the Adam West style campy Batman, but even in the darker comics the character at least had a sense of wry humor. Not in this film. Heath Ledger makes a great Joker but the whole conception of the character is off. Unlike say Alan Moore's ""The Killing Joke,"" the Joker in this movie is insane and dangerous, but not particularly charismatic or funny or even all that witty. He's just a sociopath. I've seen it in other movies, it's not fresh.The film is also at leats 30 minutes overlong and Nolan still has no idea how to film an action sequence. It's bad enough he made a movie about a vigilante detective who does no actual detective work. What's worse, Nolan made a movie about a crimefighter who's basically a martial arts, but he can't shoot an action seqeuence to save his life. To cover up this glaring deficiency, Nolan shoots most of the action scenes in this sloppy, quick edit style that's more disorienting than thrilling.The acting is uniformly good and there are so many great ideas floating around. The Joker is clearly a metaphor for terrorism here - a destructive force that can't be reasoned with or appeased. The movie touches on ideas like the value of torture, rendition, wire-tapping, etc. when confronted with this kind of enemy. Nolan obviously has a vision - he just doesn't have the right story.2 1/2 stars.",2,An ambitious failure,1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,2989,"['realize', ""'m"", 'outlier', 'one', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'easily', 'most', 'overrated', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'ideas', 'stuffed', 'picture', 'film', 'never', 'together', 'case', 'whole', 'really', 'less', 'sum', 'parts.The', 'grim', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'Batman', 'mythos', 'interesting', 'idea', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'Even', 'comics', 'Batman', 'was', 'always', 'somewhat', 'larger', 'life', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'character', 'treating', 'Batman', 'actual', 'person', 'Nolan', 'audience', 'question', 'implausibilities', 'story', 'are', 'many.For', 'example', 'one', 'point', 'Joker', 'kidnaps', 'two', 'key', 'characters', 'kidnapping', 'entirely', 'off-screen', ""'re"", 'just', 'told', 'Joker', 'left', 'wonder', 'how', 'happened', 'Batman', 'also', 'cell', 'phones', 'spy', 'Gotham', 'City', 'just', 'not', 'possible', 'Joker', 'henchmen', 'are', 'supposedly', 'insane', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'several', 'daring', 'heists', 'Then', 'Joker', 'would', 'discourage', 'new', 'recruits', 'get', 'idea.If', 'Nolan', 'treated', 'material', 'comic', 'book', 'none', 'illogic', 'would', 'matter', 'entire', 'movie', 'realistic', 'crime', 'drama', 'inconvenient', 'then', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'comic', 'book', 'logic', 'guess', 'big', 'problem', 'Nolan', 'have', 'ways', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'times', 'also', 'audience', 'overlook', 'huge', 'inconsistencies', 'major', 'plotholes', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.The', 'whole', 'tone', 'movie', 'so', 'dark', 'grim', 'started', 'become', 'oppressive', 'awhile', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'Adam', 'West', 'style', 'campy', 'Batman', 'even', 'darker', 'character', 'least', 'had', 'sense', 'wry', 'humor', 'Not', 'film', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'great', 'Joker', 'whole', 'conception', 'character', 'off', 'say', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'Killing', 'Joke', 'Joker', 'movie', 'insane', 'dangerous', 'not', 'particularly', 'charismatic', 'funny', 'even', 'witty', 'just', 'sociopath', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'fresh.The', 'film', 'also', 'leats', '30', 'minutes', 'overlong', 'Nolan', 'still', 'idea', 'how', 'film', 'action', 'sequence', 'bad', 'enough', 'made', 'movie', 'vigilante', 'detective', 'who', 'actual', 'detective', 'work', 'What', 'worse', 'Nolan', 'made', 'movie', 'crimefighter', 'who', 'basically', 'martial', 'arts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'action', 'seqeuence', 'save', 'life', 'cover', 'up', 'glaring', 'deficiency', 'Nolan', 'most', 'action', 'scenes', 'sloppy', 'quick', 'edit', 'style', 'more', 'disorienting', 'thrilling.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'good', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'ideas', 'floating', 'around', 'Joker', 'clearly', 'metaphor', 'terrorism', 'here', 'destructive', 'force', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'reasoned', 'appeased', 'movie', 'touches', 'ideas', 'value', 'torture', 'rendition', 'wire-tapping', 'etc', 'when', 'confronted', 'kind', 'enemy', 'Nolan', 'obviously', 'vision', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'story.2', '1/2', 'stars']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659798,A2XVA2OGDYKKD,B00005JPY0,Monsieur Valentine,"[14, 30]","(Spoilers)Dark Knight is to be applauded for its effort to transcend the genre. As a comic adaptation, Christopher Nolan tries very hard to retain the philosophical and social commentary that comic books often possess. There is a depth to each character, even if it is just a caricature. An evolution of each, with a cerebral reason for their existence, not just a physical presence but a intellectual metamorphosis.To put it mildly, just like people who wish for peace and all things good, there are others who want chaos and destruction. Enter the Joker. He has no socio-economic reason to be evil. Its not greed for money or power. Its not even his motivation to contest Batman. His sole aim is to see the collapse of civilization and for 'society' to face the brutal truth which is... (what he thinks) the buried primitive instinct of our humanity. If anything, he wishes his nemesis batman to be his spectator.This premise works for me. Heath Ledger is simply amazing. Not because he has passed away, but because his presence on camera is captivating. His interpretation leaves Jack Nicholson empty handed. I say this after I had previously said, no body can do Joker like Nicholson. Amazing.I hate to say it but there is truth in the saying ""want an oscar... play a mad man"". It wont win him an Oscar, but nevertheless he alone propelled this movie high into the stratosphere!But this movie wasn't about Joker alone. Joker was only a third of this movie, which was a shame in hindsight.What is worse than katie Holmes...A woman that kinda looks like Katie Holmes...Has more of a droopy face than Katie holmes... is more winy ... more demanding... and more selfish than Katie Holmes.You know... back in the ol days they knew what to do with a whiny character like that. They would get rid of her all together for the Sequel. Remember Kim Basinger's character.Girl2: ""What happened to Rachael....""Butler: ""Oh ... they broke up. they argued too much"".... And that was that!Christian Bale had a limited role as Bruce Wayne in this sequel. We saw more of him as Batman, and to be quite honest... I felt Batman was actually quite lifeless and dull. His voiceover is distracting to say the least, maybe because the content of his dialogue was not very absorbing.Two face was an oddball. An oddball of motives, of creation and of reaction. I didn't quite understand the reasoning for his transformation as a character. Yeh his face got burnt... but why all the hate towards the commissioner in the end. The connection between his fate with `chance' and his action to flip a coin everytime didn't have the same feasibility as Batman or Joker's introductions. I understood the importance of two face in this movie, but I wasnt as entertained in his presence. Could this have been better without him? Im not sure.The 2.5 hour story itself was a bit of a mish mash, I found the pacing of the movie was very loose. Parts which were too fast, parts which were too drawn out. Lets just say... I wasn't in this for the big bang action scenes... so I felt like some of the action scenes were lost on me. Christopher Nolan doesnt do action sequences well.

First of all I will give a &lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILER>>> warning right away.  I thought it was a good movie, but far from great.  Ledger gives an amazing twisted performance.  The movie starts off with a bang, and moves along nicely for most of the running time.  But now to my problems with it.  I have a lot, so I will just go over a few of the major ones.  I thought it had a bad ending (Batman wanting to be chased), they don't even spend a second trying to make us believe Gordon dies, so there's no effect when he comes back.  And my biggest problem is that they can't get the voice right.  First of all Bale's dark voice sounds incredibly stupid, but worse than that the director doesn't know what he's doing with the voice. The dark voice is his normal voice. He became mad at the world and criminal activity and became the dark knight. When he's around people who don't know he's Batman he uses the nice voice, which is fake. When he's around people who know he's Batman, he uses the dark voice, which is his normal voice. Now if the voice thing was my only problem with the movie, then I probably would have loved it, but unfortunately the movie is riddled with holes. I liked the first movie A LOT more. And am I the only one that noticed that Two-Face looks like a skinless Terminator?  And one more thing, I have to go over the action scenes.  The non fight scenes are pretty spectacular.  I can't knock those at all.  But the hand to hand fight scenes are not that great.  I liked the first fight.  It doesn't have the extreme editing that Batman Begins had, but every fight seems to have the same choreography.  And that correlates with another problem I had with the movie.  A lot of scenes seem rushed.  Really a shame.  So while it's a good movie, just don't go into it like I did thinking it will be one of the greatest movies ever made.Rating- 3.5/5",3,I will never go into a movie with high expectations ever again,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,1919,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'let', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'hype', 'First', 'will', 'give', 'lt', 'lt', 'lt', 'SPOILER', '>', '>', '>', 'warning', 'right', 'away', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'far', 'great', 'Ledger', 'amazing', 'twisted', 'performance', 'movie', 'bang', 'moves', 'along', 'nicely', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'now', 'problems', 'have', 'lot', 'will', 'just', 'go', 'over', 'few', 'major', 'ones', 'thought', 'had', 'bad', 'ending', 'Batman', 'wanting', 'be', 'chased', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'spend', 'second', 'trying', 'make', 'believe', 'Gordon', 'dies', 'effect', 'when', 'back', 'biggest', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'voice', 'right', 'First', 'Bale', 'dark', 'voice', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'worse', 'director', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'voice', 'dark', 'voice', 'normal', 'voice', 'became', 'mad', 'world', 'criminal', 'activity', 'became', 'dark', 'knight', 'When', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Batman', 'nice', 'voice', 'fake', 'When', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'Batman', 'dark', 'voice', 'normal', 'voice', 'Now', 'voice', 'thing', 'was', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'then', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'riddled', 'holes', 'liked', 'first', 'movie', 'A', 'LOT', 'more', 'am', 'only', 'one', 'noticed', 'Two-Face', 'skinless', 'Terminator', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'have', 'go', 'action', 'scenes', 'non', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'spectacular', 'ca', ""n't"", 'knock', 'hand', 'hand', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'liked', 'first', 'fight', ""n't"", 'have', 'extreme', 'editing', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'had', 'fight', 'have', 'same', 'choreography', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'lot', 'scenes', 'seem', 'rushed', 'Really', 'shame', 'So', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'did', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.Rating-', '3.5/5']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

This film has reached a masterpiece status among it's many fans and I think they're watching this film through rose colored Bat-glasses!This is a fine film, but it's flawed on many levels. For one thing it's inconsistent, as this is supposed to be a Batman film that is realistic...right? Well, is it realistic that Batman and Rachel Dawes could fall from a skyscraper and crush a car with their impact without even being injured or somewhat slightly dazed!? I know it's a comic book film and I usually don't pick apart superhero movies for these types of things because it's fantasy, but 'The Dark Knight' is supposed to be something more...isn't it? I thought this was the ""adult superhero movie""?...not my words,...just what I've heard.Another problem with this film is Batman/Bruce Wayne(Played by a the ever-capable Christian Bale)is so one dimensional in this film. The Batman voice borders on absurd and Bruce is not much more the a stereotypical ""rich guy"". Heath Ledger gives an excellent twisted performance as the Joker, but it's not Oscar worthy! While I like Nolan's direction, the film suffers from not really having much plot and being painfully long! I'm also a little put off too by the fact that Spider-Man 3 took such hard criticism, when this film has received so many rave reviews.Lets compare the two films. I really should compare it to Spider-Man 2, but that would be a landslide in Spidey's favor.Spider-Man 3  VS  The Dark Knight1)Spider-Man/Peter Parker VS  1)Batman/Bruce WayneWinner - Spider-Man/Peter Parker has so much more depth and character development. We understand and feel his problems. Which continues in all three films.Loser Dark Knight - Batman Begins was a great origin, but the evolving character development was completely forgotten in The Dark Knight.VillainsSandman/Green Goblin/Venom  VS  Scarecrow/Joker/Two faceWinner - Spider-Man 3 The villains are so much more developed.The Dark Knight - This was close, but as much as I admire the realistic villains of this film, I didn't feel they were well developed, very good performances by the actors no doubt, but I need more than the Joker telling how his father cut his mouth or more random babble to get a grasp of his character. Scarecrow is nothing more than an amusing cameo and Two Face only come into the film in the last act(much like Venom in Spider-Man 3). I guess he'll be back in part 3?PlotsSpider-Man 3Parker/Spidey's on going balancing act between juggling his personal life and his superhero alter ego. Now being affected by alienation of his best friend(who thinks he killed his father), estranged girlfriend and the symbiote trying to take over his mind. Not to mention fighting the Sandman(who really killed his uncle) and Venom who hates Parker for ruining his life! Whew!....I know, I know that's a lot to chew on!The Dark KnightBatman is thinking of giving up crime fighting to be with the woman he loves.......I guess?Winner - Spider-Man 3 - We know everyone's motives and they make sense, it may have been an ambitious undertaking, but I think it was pulled off fairly well. I know a lot of people thought that Venom was under used, but so was Two face in The Dark Knight.Over allThe Dark Knight is a very impressive film with some great FX and cast! Both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight have a feel like no other super hero films. Ya see?....I'm a fan, I just don't want to be told something is a flawless masterpiece when it's obviously not. Regardless of it's flaws, it's still a very good movie. I'm glad I own it and I can't wait to see part 3!UPDATE ON DVD AND FEATURESThe Two Disc edition is really a disappointment, the picture isn't great and the sound goes from whispering voices to extremely loud explosions.

659806,A1NMUSODK9RHAT,B00005JPY0,Mr. Maybe,"[2, 4]","This is one of those rare films where my expectations were not only a bit higher than normal, but they were also equally fulfilled.Nolan is giving us a number of stories here, almost more like a Gotham Chronicles story than JUST a Batman story. This film is as much about Jim Gordon, Harvey Dent and even the every day people of Gotham as much as it is about Bruce Wayne/Batman or the Joker.What impressed me about the writing is how Nolan was able to convey, in a very real-world sense, the anxiety and life-questions that a man like Bruce Wayne would have to make as a true, living breathing crime fighting vigilante. There was cause and effect of being such a figure and his impact had more repercussions than he foresaw. The psychological warfare between Batman and the Joker (even Dent) is mostly well-handled and illustrated, adding a nice layer of richness to the film's finished product. However, sometimes Nolan tries to include TOO MUCH, and there's times where scenes are left a bit unfinished or have loose ends, which is too bad, but mostly forgivable.On the flip-side of ""real-world"" sensibility, one personal disappointment is that the credo of Nolan's Batman about ""realism"" (technically and physically) is nowhere to be found here. All the care and effort to explain Batman's gadgets, his trials and errors as a rooftop leaping vigilante all are gone. We don't see the time it takes Wayne to develop something of Fox's into his Batsuit or repertoire. In one scene he's shown it, the next he's using it in almost unbelievable scope and fashion. Much of the action demands much more suspension of disbelief (unlike in Begins), and a lot of it plays out like a James Bond film. In fact, this is more or less ""Batman 007"", which ultimately, isn't such a bad thing since we're talking comic source material here. Nolan makes up for this deviation with purely satisfying Batman fanfare action sequences and capturing our hero at his best.The film is a bit bleak and very dark in tone - Nolan doesn't pull a lot of punches and the result is plenty of moments of grim suspense and anticipation. This is wholly satisfying for many Batman fans, especially the Joker, who is played at his darkest core. I found myself holding my breath with anticipation at a few moments, and Nolan seems to change up the outcomes JUST enough to keep you guessing. I wouldn't recommend this to kids under 12 or so. Not so much gory, as it is intense subject matter and mature themes.I found the performances of all the cast to be top-notch. In fact, the Joker (exceptionally well-played by Ledger) begins the film as a question mark, and ends it just the same, which I think was sort of the angle here. His purpose is more or less to force Batman to question his own limits and reasons for purpose, using madness for this reason above logic, making him Batman's most enigmatic foe.We also get to see the promotion of Jim Gordon to Commissioner, which was anticipated given his lesser badge status in Begins. Oldman steps up his game from Begins, and his role serves as the best view for the audience.Maggie Gyllenhaal is a more watchable Rachel Dawes, but her character is little more than a device here. By the end of the Dark Knight, it's clear her purpose was far better suited in Begins as Bruce's childhood friend. Still, Gyllenhaal is plenty serviceable and doesn't take an ounce away here.Harvey Dent is perhaps, the biggest surprise of the story and I was impressed with Aaron Eckhart's performance. His story is perhaps the greatest arc of the film, although I thought his ""point of no return"" was a little rushed and hard to believe.Morgan Freeman is back as our new favorite ""Q"", Lucias Fox, offering up new technology for Batman's disposal...but we also get to see a bit of his role as head of Wayne Corporation and his own personal convictions and responsibilities.In the end, I would qualify the Dark Knight as the the best Batman film to date, going back as far as you want to. I can also say this is quite possibly the best COMIC film to date. But what surprised me, was that this was one of the best CRIME films I've seen in a long time.The Dark Knight offers plenty of bang for your buck.",4,"More carelessly told than Begins, but Dark Knight redefines the comic genre in film",1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,4195,"['one', 'rare', 'films', 'where', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'bit', 'higher', 'normal', 'were', 'also', 'equally', 'fulfilled.Nolan', 'giving', 'number', 'stories', 'here', 'almost', 'more', 'Gotham', 'Chronicles', 'story', 'JUST', 'Batman', 'story', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'even', 'day', 'people', 'Gotham', 'as', 'much', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'Joker.What', 'impressed', 'writing', 'how', 'Nolan', 'was', 'able', 'convey', 'very', 'real-world', 'sense', 'anxiety', 'life-questions', 'man', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'would', 'have', 'make', 'true', 'living', 'breathing', 'crime', 'fighting', 'vigilante', 'was', 'cause', 'effect', 'being', 'such', 'figure', 'impact', 'had', 'more', 'repercussions', 'foresaw', 'psychological', 'warfare', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'even', 'Dent', 'mostly', 'well-handled', 'illustrated', 'adding', 'nice', 'layer', 'richness', 'film', 'finished', 'product', 'However', 'sometimes', 'Nolan', 'include', 'TOO', 'MUCH', 'times', 'where', 'scenes', 'are', 'left', 'bit', 'unfinished', 'have', 'loose', 'ends', 'too', 'bad', 'mostly', 'flip-side', 'real-world', 'sensibility', 'one', 'personal', 'disappointment', 'credo', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'realism', 'technically', 'physically', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'care', 'effort', 'explain', 'Batman', 'gadgets', 'trials', 'errors', 'rooftop', 'leaping', 'are', 'gone', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'time', 'Wayne', 'develop', 'something', 'Fox', 'Batsuit', 'repertoire', 'one', 'scene', 'shown', 'next', 'using', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'scope', 'fashion', 'Much', 'action', 'much', 'more', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Begins', 'lot', 'out', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'fact', 'more', 'less', 'Batman', '007', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'thing', ""'re"", 'talking', 'comic', 'source', 'material', 'here', 'Nolan', 'up', 'deviation', 'purely', 'satisfying', 'Batman', 'fanfare', 'action', 'sequences', 'capturing', 'hero', 'best.The', 'film', 'bit', 'bleak', 'very', 'dark', 'tone', 'Nolan', ""n't"", 'pull', 'lot', 'punches', 'result', 'plenty', 'moments', 'grim', 'suspense', 'anticipation', 'wholly', 'satisfying', 'many', 'Batman', 'fans', 'especially', 'Joker', 'who', 'played', 'darkest', 'core', 'found', 'holding', 'breath', 'anticipation', 'few', 'moments', 'Nolan', 'change', 'up', 'outcomes', 'JUST', 'enough', 'keep', 'guessing', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'kids', '12', 'so', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'gory', 'intense', 'subject', 'matter', 'mature', 'themes.I', 'found', 'performances', 'cast', 'be', 'top-notch', 'fact', 'Joker', 'exceptionally', 'well-played', 'Ledger', 'film', 'question', 'mark', 'just', 'same', 'think', 'was', 'sort', 'angle', 'here', 'purpose', 'more', 'less', 'force', 'Batman', 'question', 'own', 'limits', 'reasons', 'purpose', 'using', 'madness', 'reason', 'logic', 'making', 'Batman', 'most', 'enigmatic', 'foe.We', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'promotion', 'Jim', 'Gordon', 'Commissioner', 'was', 'anticipated', 'given', 'lesser', 'badge', 'status', 'Begins', 'Oldman', 'up', 'game', 'Begins', 'role', 'best', 'view', 'audience.Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'more', 'watchable', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'device', 'here', 'end', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'clear', 'purpose', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'suited', 'Begins', 'Bruce', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Still', 'Gyllenhaal', 'plenty', 'serviceable', ""n't"", 'take', 'ounce', 'away', 'here.Harvey', 'Dent', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'story', 'was', 'impressed', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'performance', 'story', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'arc', 'film', 'thought', 'point', 'return', 'was', 'little', 'rushed', 'hard', 'believe.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'back', 'new', 'favorite', 'Q', 'Lucias', 'Fox', 'offering', 'up', 'new', 'technology', 'Batman', 'disposal', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'bit', 'role', 'head', 'Wayne', 'Corporation', 'own', 'personal', 'convictions', 'responsibilities.In', 'end', 'would', 'qualify', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'best', 'Batman', 'film', 'date', 'going', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'want', 'can', 'also', 'say', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'COMIC', 'film', 'date', 'what', 'surprised', 'was', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'CRIME', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'plenty', 'bang', 'buck']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659819,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00005JPY0,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[16, 26]","Warning: some spoilers ahead.Superhero epics rarely get better than The Dark Knight, a sequel that not only outshines Batman Begins, but completely obliterates it.  Christian Bale returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne, and soon learns that the warning Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) gave him at the end of Batman Begins about escalation was ever so true as the psychotic Joker (the late Heath Ledger, in a brilliant and Oscar worthy performance) makes an impact on Gotham City's criminal underworld.  In his personal life, Bruce also finds his true love Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes) in the arms of new district attorney and Gotham's proclaimed ""white knight"" Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who swears to clean up the corruption running rampant in Gotham; no matter the cost.Epic in scope with brilliant direction from Christopher Nolan (whose orchestration of an opening bank heist is nearly flawless), The Dark Knight takes us places that superhero or comic book-based films rarely take us.  It's an intelligent, dark, and surprisingly violent ride that features wonderful performances from nearly everyone involved, and the handling of Dent's tragic descent is as memorable as almost any thing else featured in the film.  However, it is the performance of Heath Ledger that really puts The Dark Knight on such high a plateau.  Ledger's Joker is by and far the best treatment of a villain you will ever find in a comic to film adaptation: he's sickly funny and incredibly frightening in a performance that truly is for the ages.  Bale himself seems more comfortable in the role of Batman, and is by far the best Caped Crusader to grace the screen. Eckhart is fitting as Harvey Dent, and his tragic transformation into Two-Face is, as said before, respectful and believable.  Everyone else, from a returning Michael Caine as trusty butler Alfred and Morgan Freeman as the brilliant Lucius Fox, are small miracles by themselves.All in all, The Dark Knight is certainly the best Batman film to ever see the light of day.

659820,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B00005JPY0,Newton Ooi,"[1, 2]","What makes a great comic book story?  Cool gadgets, great fight scenes, a snazzy disguise, unassuming sidekicks, an unfathomable villian, an incorruptible hero and everyone else caught in between.What makes a great movie?  Great, realistic dialogue.  Unpredictable drama.  The occasional comedy that is not contrived, and not felt like it was purposely written into the script for laughs.  A doomed romance.  An ensemble cast of multiple protagonists and antagonists.  And a haunting soundtrack.Given these two descriptions, one can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is probably the greatest comic book movie of all time, and one of the greatest movies of all time.  Unlike ""Batman Begins"", there is no exotic locales.  No supernatural powers or allusions to myth like in the Superman, X-Men, Spiderman or other comic book genres transplanted to the big and small screens.  No, what Christopher Nolan created here is a perfect mix of Hill Street Blues, Law & Order, Heat, and the Godfather trilogy into a 2.5 hour movie set in a major metropolis that feels and looks like Chicago in the summertime.Of all the movies dealing with crime, the police, psychopaths, and heroes; none so perfectly blends intimate human emotions with the subtle and overt features of office politics, city politics, and mass propaganda.  The scenes between DA Harvey Dent and James Gordon epitomize bureaucratic turf protection like few other films.  The contest between Batman and the Joker represents the ultimate chess match; except played out over an entire city.  And the on-screen wiles of James Gordon, Lucius Fox, and numerous other characters reveal that superheroes did not get to where they are thru sheer personal talent; but instead rely on well-honed teams of dedicated individuals.  Probably the most insightful feature of this film is the subtle but unceasing display of ownership.  Almost every single major location of this film is owned by some individual or institution; often to the ignorance and surprise of the general public.  Whether it is the opening scene in the mob-owned bank, to the dinner scene in the restaurant owned by Bruce Wayne, this unseen ownership of place and time by unseen actors in higher (or lower) positions is the ultimate feature of modern society; one that makes organized crime feasible and profitable.  And it is this feature that is the icing on the cake that is this great movie.  So overall, this is Hollywood perfection and a must watch film.",5,Movie perfection,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,2473,"['What', 'great', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'Cool', 'gadgets', 'great', 'fight', 'scenes', 'snazzy', 'disguise', 'unassuming', 'sidekicks', 'unfathomable', 'villian', 'incorruptible', 'hero', 'everyone', 'else', 'caught', 'between.What', 'great', 'movie', 'Great', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'Unpredictable', 'drama', 'occasional', 'comedy', 'not', 'contrived', 'not', 'felt', 'was', 'purposely', 'written', 'script', 'laughs', 'doomed', 'romance', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'multiple', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'haunting', 'soundtrack.Given', 'two', 'descriptions', 'one', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'probably', 'greatest', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'time', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'exotic', 'locales', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'allusions', 'myth', 'Superman', 'X-Men', 'Spiderman', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'genres', 'transplanted', 'big', 'small', 'screens', 'what', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'created', 'here', 'perfect', 'mix', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Law', 'Order', 'Heat', 'Godfather', 'trilogy', '2.5', 'hour', 'movie', 'set', 'major', 'metropolis', 'feels', 'Chicago', 'summertime.Of', 'movies', 'dealing', 'crime', 'police', 'psychopaths', 'heroes', 'none', 'so', 'perfectly', 'intimate', 'human', 'emotions', 'subtle', 'overt', 'features', 'office', 'politics', 'city', 'politics', 'mass', 'propaganda', 'scenes', 'DA', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'James', 'Gordon', 'epitomize', 'bureaucratic', 'turf', 'protection', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'contest', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'ultimate', 'chess', 'match', 'played', 'out', 'entire', 'city', 'on-screen', 'wiles', 'James', 'Gordon', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'numerous', 'other', 'characters', 'reveal', 'superheroes', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'where', 'are', 'thru', 'sheer', 'personal', 'talent', 'instead', 'rely', 'well-honed', 'teams', 'dedicated', 'individuals', 'Probably', 'most', 'insightful', 'feature', 'film', 'subtle', 'unceasing', 'display', 'ownership', 'single', 'major', 'location', 'film', 'owned', 'individual', 'institution', 'often', 'ignorance', 'surprise', 'general', 'public', 'opening', 'scene', 'mob-owned', 'bank', 'dinner', 'scene', 'restaurant', 'owned', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'unseen', 'ownership', 'place', 'time', 'unseen', 'actors', 'higher', 'lower', 'positions', 'ultimate', 'feature', 'modern', 'society', 'one', 'organized', 'crime', 'feasible', 'profitable', 'feature', 'icing', 'cake', 'great', 'movie', 'So', 'overall', 'Hollywood', 'perfection', 'must', 'watch', 'film']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Due to, from past experience, the lack of substance that a movie will have once completed and in theaters.  More times than not a movie with such over hype usually is just a way for studios to try to gain money from the audeince who doesn't know any better and once it is seen it falls away into oblivian. That was my concern about this movie.  That it would suck so bad that it completely destory Batman as a comic book character that has been around since the early 20th century.  Just because studios think that the masses are just dumb sheep who will make a hit out of a movie just because of a lot of advertising was put behind it.However, I was pleasantly proven wrong about this movie.  What Christpher Nolan did with Batman Begins he built upon in this one.  We see a city still in dispair to the point of breaking.  Yet there is hope on the streets and fear starting emerge in the hearts of criminals, all because of Batman.  Along comes the Joker.  He is a sucidal maniac who wants to prove to the world that it sits on a thin thread between chaos and order.  Thinking that most of society, at its heart, is chaotic is oout to take down the only thing standing between him and complete anarchy, Batman.  To take down the Joker and his diabolical plans Batman, LT. Gordon, and newly appointed D.A.  Harvey Dent team up.  Although, the heroes of this story try to take down the Joker through moral ways he makes it very difficult for them to make the right decision and become a symbol of hope for the city of Gotham.In the end the movie blew me away and then some.

Did those Kellogs morons not realize that this character is a MASS MURDERER in a realistic setting?)Don't get me wrong.The movie was not bad.For a rental.But there was very little about this that was Batman...The Batman of the comic book world, for the many ignorant people who are promoting this movie, is many things...most importantly ""The World's Greatest DETECTIVE"".That's how Bob Kane, the creator, made it, in Detective Comics number 27.Do I sound like a fanboy when I type this?I hope so.Because this is a great character and it is sickening to see how Nolan ""reinvented"" this character into a realistic setting while not understanding one important, the most important, aspect of the character:this is the most UNREALISTIC character ever!He's completely contradictory.He's the world's greatest detective and a mystery himself, he's a loner and a super social smooth-talker, he's a Justice League member and non-super-powered, he's the richest man in the world and gets the most hardship.This contradiction of a character is awesome in comic book form.But it's not a character that can ever be real and therefore, never be well-represented on film.What else.I could list the ways in which this film messes with the comic book details.And I'm not talking about the Justice League stuff.I'm talking about the ""dark"" realistic Batman stories.It couldn't even get simple facts like Two-Face's love life correct.Or the fact that Joker never mentioned a father figure in the comics.Or, like I've already said, the fact that the most notable part of Batman is not that he's ""dark"", but that he's a DETECTIVE.Nolan could have made a vigilante film in which a rich boy decides to go heroically crazy and help a sick city.But he didn't need to screw up the nature of Batman for that goal.There are so many rich guy anti-heroes...Iron Man, Robin Hood, Zorro (whom Batman was based off of, in part) to name a few.A good comic book film is one that is either fun, has beautiful special effects, or brings something to the screen that would be hard to bring to the screen.Does The Dark Knight do any of these things?No.And it definitely was not fun...a bunch of brooding and

I would have liked a bigger scene for Cillian Murphy (scarecrow) but his character wasn't really necessary in this movie.I give this 4 out of 5 because the movie is awesome...minus 1 for the LACK of special features.,4,"Great Movie - ""OK"" Dvd",1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,865,"['have', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'ripped', 'off', 'special', 'edition', 'features', 'was', 'basically', 'same', 'stuff', 'could', 'see', 'HBO', 'when', 'were', 'doing', 'special', 'movie', 'Where', 'are', 'interviews', 'Heath..', '..Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'Heath', 'filming', 'scenes', 'etc', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'anything', 'respect', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'disrespectful', 'other', 'reason', 'might', 'be', 'are', 'waiting', 'release', 'ANOTHER', 'special', 'edition', 'people', 'buy', 'movie', 'again', 'new', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'tick', 'off.The', 'movie', 'everyone', 'already', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'bigger', 'scene', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'scarecrow', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'movie.I', 'give', '4', '5', 'movie', 'awesome', '1', 'LACK', 'special', 'features']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659829,A4FG1EZ8FBOFA,B00005JPY0,"Nova ""Pierre""","[1, 3]","Easily best movie of 2008, and the most riveting comic book adaptation ever. This was written as more of a detective or mob movie then a high flying special effects parade, and i loved that about it. I was expecting a continuation of the dark brooding version of the last film, but i wasn't expecting such an improvement on the genre. This is the Batman we love, faced with tough choices and personal turmoil he still must don the cape and do whats right.The cast from Batman Begins is back. Christian Bale reprises his role as the MIllionaire playboy Bruce Wayne by day, and intimadating crusader by night. Joined with his loyal friends Lucious fox, played by Morgan freeman, and Alfred the butler, played my micheal Caine. Gary oldman gets a little more development, as lieutenant/commissioner Gordon, as a lawman who sees corruption all around him and can only trust in a vigilante to get things done.Welcome additions are Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gylenhaal. Aaron plays District attorney Harvey Dent who becomes the villian two-face. His part might not have been as insane as The joker ( more about him later) or as slick as the batman, but its was very essential to the plot. It's quite an arch to see someone good go bad, and how it happens is both exciting and miserably saddening.Maggie Gylenhaal takes over for Katie Holmes as The love interest for both Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent. It's a messy triangle, that is key to understanding the minds of Bruce Wayne and Two-face. Honestly i think mrs. Cruise would have been a bit out of her league with these Oscar & golden globe nominated scene stealers.But lets get to the character of the hour or more less the Villian of the decade. Heath ledger's psychopathic Joker. I knew Heath was a great actor and was just on the cusp of more stellar work ( see his oscar nominated turn in Brokeback Mountain as proof) but i had no idea what i'd see on screen. This Joker is the sickest character i've seen in a while. Heath, once again, dissapears and lets this creature run wild all over the film. This joker is not into entertain other people he's only in it to entertain himself. And what Makes the joker laugh... absolute disorder. He'll pin man against man just to see how far you're willing to go to survive. There's no acid shooting flowers, no chemical bath, and no laughing gas (however there is one heck of a magic trick ). The party is all in his head, and Gotham is worse for it. He licks his facial wounds as a reminder of the monster he's become. He enjoys knives because of the prolonged agony they inflict. He doesn't even fear his own death. What an incredible nut-job.This joker has no sympathy, no reasoning, no purpose other than to watch the world burn ( as Alfred suggests). What a character to introduce and pit against the man of justice. For the first time i understood why the joker was his greatest arch nemesis. I thought it was more superficial...serious and shadowy vs. playful and showy, but its really order vs. chaos, The joker is a lone figure who intimdates and frightens people into doing harm to one another for no better reason then he feels it should be that way. The batman is a lone figure who intimidates and frightens people into doing whats right and making them pay for their crimes because he feels it should be that way. 2 sides of the same coin. Amazing.The action sequences are pretty killer, especially a car chase scene that introduces the bat-pod, a killer little 2 wheeler, that batman unleashes on the joker. The acting is top notch, and the story is really consuming. the 2 hour 32 minute run time is a bit much, but it's hard to imagine cutting anything without hurting the film as whole.the good news is that the movie exceded the hype. I was waiting a while and i was more then satisfied. The bad news is that i'm not sure how this feeling could ever be revisited. Heath Ledgers's passing becomes even more sad after having created another iconic figure. We'll never see THIS Joker again. I also have no idea how they could top The Dark knight, or any other comic book movie again. The bar has officially been raised.Heath Ledgers oscar whispers, should be screams at this point. Dead or alive, he deserves the award for this performance. But i will possibly go further, I think This movie should be a serious contender during award season. The whole production should be regarded for it's work from the haunting score,screenplay, amazing direction, special effects and sound.if there is a ballot this tops my list.RIP Heath ledger",5,Uncontrollable force meets immoveable object,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,4538,"['Easily', 'best', 'movie', '2008', 'most', 'riveting', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'ever', 'was', 'written', 'more', 'detective', 'mob', 'movie', 'then', 'high', 'flying', 'special', 'effects', 'parade', 'i', 'loved', 'was', 'expecting', 'continuation', 'dark', 'brooding', 'version', 'last', 'film', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'such', 'improvement', 'genre', 'Batman', 'love', 'faced', 'tough', 'choices', 'personal', 'turmoil', 'still', 'must', 'don', 'cape', 'do', 'whats', 'right.The', 'cast', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'back', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'role', 'MIllionaire', 'playboy', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'day', 'intimadating', 'crusader', 'night', 'Joined', 'loyal', 'friends', 'Lucious', 'fox', 'played', 'Morgan', 'freeman', 'Alfred', 'butler', 'played', 'micheal', 'Caine', 'Gary', 'oldman', 'little', 'more', 'development', 'lieutenant/commissioner', 'Gordon', 'lawman', 'who', 'corruption', 'can', 'only', 'trust', 'vigilante', 'get', 'things', 'done.Welcome', 'additions', 'are', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Maggie', 'Gylenhaal', 'Aaron', 'District', 'attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'who', 'villian', 'two-face', 'part', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'insane', 'joker', 'more', 'later', 'as', 'slick', 'batman', 'was', 'very', 'essential', 'plot', 'quite', 'arch', 'see', 'someone', 'good', 'go', 'bad', 'how', 'exciting', 'miserably', 'saddening.Maggie', 'Gylenhaal', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'love', 'interest', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'messy', 'triangle', 'key', 'understanding', 'minds', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Two-face', 'Honestly', 'think', 'mrs.', 'Cruise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'league', 'Oscar', 'golden', 'globe', 'nominated', 'scene', 'stealers.But', 'get', 'character', 'hour', 'more', 'Villian', 'decade', 'Heath', 'ledger', 'psychopathic', 'Joker', 'knew', 'Heath', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'was', 'just', 'cusp', 'more', 'stellar', 'work', 'see', 'oscar', 'nominated', 'turn', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'proof', 'had', 'idea', 'what', ""'d"", 'see', 'screen', 'Joker', 'sickest', 'character', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'Heath', 'once', 'again', 'dissapears', 'creature', 'run', 'wild', 'film', 'joker', 'not', 'entertain', 'other', 'people', 'only', 'entertain', 'Makes', 'joker', 'laugh', 'absolute', 'disorder', ""'ll"", 'pin', 'man', 'man', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'far', ""'re"", 'willing', 'go', 'survive', 'acid', 'shooting', 'flowers', 'chemical', 'bath', 'laughing', 'gas', 'however', 'one', 'heck', 'magic', 'trick', 'party', 'head', 'Gotham', 'worse', 'facial', 'wounds', 'reminder', 'monster', 'become', 'knives', 'prolonged', 'agony', 'inflict', ""n't"", 'even', 'fear', 'own', 'death', 'What', 'incredible', 'nut-job.This', 'joker', 'sympathy', 'reasoning', 'purpose', 'other', 'watch', 'world', 'burn', 'Alfred', 'What', 'character', 'introduce', 'pit', 'man', 'justice', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'understood', 'why', 'joker', 'was', 'greatest', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'superficial', 'serious', 'shadowy', 'vs.', 'playful', 'showy', 'really', 'order', 'vs.', 'chaos', 'joker', 'lone', 'figure', 'who', 'people', 'doing', 'harm', 'one', 'better', 'reason', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'way', 'batman', 'lone', 'figure', 'who', 'people', 'doing', 'whats', 'right', 'making', 'pay', 'crimes', 'should', 'be', 'way', '2', 'sides', 'same', 'coin', 'Amazing.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'killer', 'especially', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'bat-pod', 'killer', 'little', '2', 'wheeler', 'batman', 'unleashes', 'joker', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'story', 'really', 'consuming', '2', 'hour', '32', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'bit', 'much', 'hard', 'imagine', 'cutting', 'anything', 'hurting', 'film', 'whole.the', 'good', 'news', 'movie', 'exceded', 'hype', 'was', 'waiting', 'while', 'i', 'was', 'more', 'then', 'satisfied', 'bad', 'news', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'feeling', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'revisited', 'Heath', 'Ledgers', 'passing', 'even', 'more', 'sad', 'having', 'created', 'iconic', 'figure', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'THIS', 'Joker', 'again', 'also', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'could', 'top', 'Dark', 'knight', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'again', 'bar', 'officially', 'been', 'raised.Heath', 'Ledgers', 'oscar', 'whispers', 'should', 'be', 'screams', 'point', 'Dead', 'alive', 'award', 'performance', 'i', 'will', 'possibly', 'go', 'further', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'serious', 'contender', 'award', 'season', 'whole', 'production', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'work', 'haunting', 'score', 'screenplay', 'amazing', 'direction', 'special', 'effects', 'sound.if', 'ballot', 'list.RIP', 'Heath', 'ledger']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

However, the more I saw the movie quoted online, the more I became impressed with the quality of the script, and for me good writing will excuse quite a few pencils in eyeballs.The Dark Knight is unusually well crafted for a superhero/ action movie:  I admire its restraint in not reveling in the violent aspects-- actually, it's pretty non-graphic-- and I appreciate its ability to convey intensity and emotion without an excessive amount of swearing.  It doesn't even treat us to a shoehorned in sex scene, because there isn't time to bring the action to a screeching halt.  Every scene moves the plot forward and honestly, for two and a half hours you barely notice the passage of time.I'm not going to carry on about Heath Ledger's Joker, because he did a brilliant job and we all know that already.  Nor am I going to criticize Christian Bale's acting, because he did a fine job-- Batman just isn't the standout character in this movie.  For me, at least, the movie is really about Harvey Dent, because it chronicles his rising influence in Gotham and his fall into despair and madness when he loses faith in the world and himself.  The Dark Knight is dense with philosophical talking points, but if I had to choose a main theme then I'd say it's about personal responsibility.  Batman doesn't have to answer to anyone but himself, so he can make the sacrifices and tough calls but there are some lines he will not cross.  Lt. Gordon is hampered by the rules of Gotham's police department and can't effectively combat an evil as chaotic as the Joker.  And Harvey Dent, after seeing the tragic outcome of everyone's muddled efforts, refuses to take responsibility for anything at all.  What ends up happening to Rachel could be all of their faults or out of their hands, and there's no way to be sure who should have done what.I haven't seen the other movies in the trilogy, and I'm not going to.  The Dark Knight is comprehensible to anyone with a basic understanding of the Batman mythos, or in other words to almost anybody anywhere.  Though incredibly dark in tone, the movie ends on sort of an idealistic note with the Joker's attempt to corrupt the people of Gotham being thwarted by the people themselves.  On the other hand, there's Harvey Dent.I have no idea what more I would need to say; to sum up, I was impressed.  I'm probably going to watch the movie again and then bug all my friends by talking about it for the next two weeks.  If you still haven't seen it, you should.

659832,A27ZCU9LK0CMQ5,B00005JPY0,"Obiturized ""Metal fan""","[0, 0]","When it comes to superhero movies, I'm not really much of a fan, most of them I find to light and fluffy, but Christopher Nolan's Batman series is totally different, because they are dark, very realistic while still retaining the fictional part obviously, and they aren't filled with stupid comedy like most superhero movies, the plots and dialog are as serious as you can get for superhero movies, lets face it, they aren't meant to be real obviously, but like I said, this series is as real as you can get for the genre.First off, lets start with the acting, because to me, that is the most important thing for me to enjoy a movie, and everybody here delivers excellent performances, of course starting with Christian Bale who of course plays Bruce Wayne/Batman, you can tell he really feels at home playing the character, he knows when to make the right facial expressions and when, also the way he talks, a very good actor anyways, but he really shines in this role, Heath Ledger as Batman's nemesis The Joker, and they could not have picked anybody better to portray him, you can tell like Christian Bale portraying Bruce Wayne that he really took care in making this character likeable (in a bad way) and that he was really into this story and character, his Joker is just menacing, and totally psychotic, I honestly believe that he earned the Academy Award for this, R.I.P., and Gary Oldman returns as Gordon, and if you read the comics, and look at Gary Oldman, he really does look like the character, and I've always liked the way Gary Oldman acts, he usually plays a bad guy, but in this series of course, he plays a good guy, and does a really good job, and Michael Caine plays the butler Alfred, and he really fits the role like he did in Batman Begins, perfect accent, and solid acting, Morgan Freeman of course returns as Lucious Fox, and not much needs to be said about Morgan Freeman, a phenominal actor, and I really like him in this role, it's made for him, and a special shoutout to Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two-Face, and does a really good job, this was the first movie I'd seen him in, and he really brings life to these characters, and another special shoutout to Eric Roberts, who I always thought was an underrated actor anyways, he plays the mob family boss, and it really works well, just his appearence, and the way he talks, so whoever did the casting for this movie (as well as Batman Begins) does a great job.Now onto the story, now I saw this movie before I ever saw Batman Begins, so when I first saw it, I liked it, I just wasn't crazy about it since I never saw the first one, but then I bought them both recently, and watched Batman Begins first (which I loved) then I watched this, now that I understand where Bruce Wayne came from, amongst other things, I absolutely love this movie now, I guess I just really needed to see the first one, and the story in this one is great, with a few twists and turns, and it really keeps you interested, and just enough action to keep it going, not just action every 5 minutes like a lot of movies today.And I should do a special section on the special effects and set design, Christopher Nolan likes to stay away from a lot of CGI, and I think that's a good idea, so a lot of what you see here, is designed and built, and they did a great job, and you can really tell they took a lot of time is designing all this, from the wonderful shots of Gotham City, to the action sequences, it just looks great, and if you watch the movie on Blu-ray, they look even more stunning, this is a great movie to show off on blu-ray, the detail, the colors, the sets just come to life (looks good on DVD too though).So my final verdict, this movie nails 5/5, I still don't know which one I liked better Batman Begins or this one, I guess it's pretty close for me, now I will have to play the waiting game and wait for The Dark Knight Rises to come out on DVD and Blu-Ray, I don't go to theatres, so hopefully they will have it out on home video by Christmas, which I'm sure that's their plan, I can't wait!",5,"I'm not too big on

659838,A1MZW5Z6RFSIZI,B00005JPY0,"Old School Gamer ""What the hell's a gigawatt!?!""","[7, 12]","The Dark Knight is something of a rarity in the current stream of comicbook movies flooding the theaters. The amazon review hits dead-on when it says that it is great not because its the best comicbook movie ever, but simply because you forget its eevn fantasy.Batman has always been and will always be the most believable superhero of the plethora that exist because he isn't ""super."" Batman Begins set up a hero grounded in real-world rules in the best way I think possible, the comics, I'm sad to say, don't even compare in my opinion. Forget that the continuity has been ruined for the Batman comics time and time again, the background of Bruce Wayne has never felt more realistic and full than it does now, thanks to Batman Begins. The Dark Knight brings to the fold possibly the greatest villian of any comicbook out there and the writers for the movie pull no punches with his truelly psychotic, chaotic, and ingenius persona. The Joker is made real by a performance that is simply put, awe-inspiring. I was never particularly in love with Heath Ledger as an actor and yet now I sit here wishing that there were any way possible to bring him back so that we did not have to lose such a gifted actor. I've never in my life watched a movie and actually felt chills or thrills from a ""bad guy"" in a movie, and I am an extreme movie buff. Ledger's characterization is both wretched and beautiful. He takes a character already so well loved by the Batman fans worldwide and takes it as his own.I don't want to make it out to be like he is the driving force behind the movie, but I don't think there is any other way, thanks to the unfortunate circumstance in which he appears in this, his panultimate acting role. I love absolutelly EVERY actor in their respective roles and can't give enough credit to Bale, Freeman, Cane, or Oldman. They are so perfect in their roles.My favirote aspect of the two new Batman films is the perfect conjuction of writing and directing. This team has to be commended for its work. The usually campy and platitude filled script of a comicbook film is still somewhat presented, as it was in Batman Begins, but it never feels that way, partly due to each actor's delivery, but moreso to the perfect setup. You have never seen a movie of this type with more suspense and intelligence in the way the events unfold. As good as the actor's are, without the careful planning done by Nolan and, perhaps moreso, David Goyer, then none of this makes sense or seems impacting in any way. I can't even stomach the original Batman films anymore thanks to these two films, they are a complete joke.I can't say enough good thigns about The Dark Knight and the people who don't like this movie, did you choose not to like just because you did not WANT to like it? I don't know one person myself who does not fully understand exactly what an incredible piece of filmmaking The Dark Knight really is.I just hope that Nolan and Goyer decide to stay for at least one more, but another four would please me even moreso.",5,Seen it twice and still blows me away.,1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,3031,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'something', 'rarity', 'current', 'stream', 'comicbook', 'movies', 'flooding', 'theaters', 'amazon', 'review', 'hits', 'dead-on', 'when', 'great', 'not', 'best', 'comicbook', 'movie', 'ever', 'simply', 'forget', 'eevn', 'fantasy.Batman', 'always', 'been', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'most', 'believable', 'superhero', 'plethora', 'exist', ""n't"", 'super', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'set', 'up', 'hero', 'grounded', 'real-world', 'rules', 'best', 'way', 'think', 'possible', 'comics', ""'m"", 'sad', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'compare', 'opinion', 'Forget', 'continuity', 'been', 'ruined', 'Batman', 'comics', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'background', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'never', 'felt', 'more', 'realistic', 'full', 'now', 'thanks', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'fold', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'villian', 'comicbook', 'there', 'writers', 'movie', 'punches', 'truelly', 'psychotic', 'chaotic', 'ingenius', 'persona', 'Joker', 'made', 'real', 'performance', 'simply', 'put', 'awe-inspiring', 'was', 'never', 'particularly', 'love', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'actor', 'yet', 'now', 'sit', 'here', 'wishing', 'were', 'way', 'possible', 'bring', 'back', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'lose', 'gifted', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'never', 'life', 'watched', 'movie', 'actually', 'felt', 'chills', 'thrills', 'bad', 'guy', 'movie', 'am', 'extreme', 'movie', 'buff', 'Ledger', 'characterization', 'wretched', 'beautiful', 'character', 'already', 'so', 'well', 'loved', 'Batman', 'fans', 'worldwide', 'own.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'driving', 'force', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'way', 'thanks', 'unfortunate', 'circumstance', 'panultimate', 'acting', 'role', 'love', 'absolutelly', 'EVERY', 'actor', 'respective', 'roles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'credit', 'Bale', 'Freeman', 'Cane', 'Oldman', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'roles.My', 'favirote', 'aspect', 'two', 'new', 'Batman', 'films', 'perfect', 'conjuction', 'writing', 'directing', 'team', 'be', 'commended', 'work', 'usually', 'campy', 'platitude', 'filled', 'script', 'comicbook', 'film', 'still', 'somewhat', 'presented', 'was', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'never', 'way', 'partly', 'due', 'actor', 'delivery', 'perfect', 'setup', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'type', 'more', 'suspense', 'intelligence', 'way', 'events', 'unfold', 'As', 'good', 'actor', 'are', 'careful', 'planning', 'done', 'Nolan', 'perhaps', 'moreso', 'David', 'Goyer', 'then', 'none', 'sense', 'impacting', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'stomach', 'original', 'Batman', 'films', 'anymore', 'thanks', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'complete', 'joke.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'thigns', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'did', 'choose', 'not', 'like', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'WANT', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'incredible', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'really', 'is.I', 'just', 'hope', 'Nolan', 'Goyer', 'decide', 'stay', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'four', 'would', 'please', 'even', 'moreso']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

The Gotham Tonight spots are kind of interesting and flesh out some back story, but this is the kind of thing that's usually put last on the list of DVD Extra Features.I wanted a LOT more JOKER!

There is a lot of jumping from tall buildings photographed from the point of view of the jumper (and am told vertigo-inducing in the giant-screen Imax version), and lots of big explosions, including the controlled demolition of a hospital. There is an eye-popping crowd scene of a funeral procession by uniformed policemen in downtown ""Gotham"" (Chicago), and more, much more. That one, like many other sequences in city streets, did leave me wondering: ""How did they do that? It's just CGI? Can't be!""And the movie can be really, really scary at times (so: not for young children).There is also what passes for deep pondering of issues existential and moral, and explicit and implicit mediations on the ambiguities of human nature; of good, evil, moral purpose versus nihilism, and so forth. These profound issues are discussed (whenever cars are not being demolished, people shot dead point-blank, and buildings blown up) mostly between a psychopath with the face smeared with runny clown's paint and a man in tights wearing a bat costume.There is humor, unremittingly black, delivered non-stop by the ""Joker"", which is fair enough. But that is all the humor there is.Since the original Tim Burton's ""Batman"" movie that started the franchise, the plots have grown progressively darker, more angst-ridden, and more self-conscious. This later movie not only tops them all as far as darkness goes, but also adds a huge helping of sadism for good measure. And it does so without the saving grace of a young Michelle Pfeiffer cavorting in a tight Catwoman costume.I am not going to go as far as to say that one must like bare-fist boxing to fully enjoy this movie, but it might help. I should add that I am a fan of Quentin Tarantino's movies, so violence per se does not turn me off. The real issue is whether violence is there as just one ingredient in an ingenious mix of dark and light, sweet and sour, spiced with brilliant dialog and some hot ass-kicking beauties, as in most QT's movies, or -- as it seems to me was the case here -- the team that produced it put the almost non-stop sadistic violence in their reimagining of the original superheroe vs. supervillain comic books, because they could.But this is just a one-man's opinion.

Mob activity is at an all time high even with the work Batman has completed. There appears to be hope on the horizon however as the new D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is fearless in his pursuit of criminals everywhere and with the help of Batman has secured a witness that may break the crime ring in Gotham forever. Batman is so focused on breaking the ring that he almost overlooks a new criminal element. After all, it's only one man. However The Joker (Heath Ledger) quickly becomes a much greater concern than originally thought...I have to throw in with the masses on this one and say that ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie. For those who weren't clued in by the title ""The Dark Knight"", this sequel is darker in both tone and look when compared to it's predecessor. This is a suitable environment however in which to introduce Batman's most notable nemesis the Joker.The Good: Great acting all around. It always seems that when a tragedy is the back-story for a movie that often times undue praise is heaped upon the victim of said tragedy. I have to say that isn't the case here. Heath Ledger left us with a masterful performance and I feel for any actor who attempts the role of the Joker in the future as he will have some big shoes to fill. Performances by Christian Bale and Aaron Eckhart shouldn't be over looked as both turned in great performances as well.The cinematography for this film worked for me. The darker edgier look echoed the darker themes of the movie. The special FX and action sequences were all up to par as was expected and we also get another new Bat-gadget to view.The Bad: The movie felt a hair long and with a running time of 152 minutes I guess that should be expected.Overall: Batman fans and non Batman fans alike should give this a watch.

659846,A1ZMCLGK23FZIT,B00005JPY0,"Patrick Hodges ""Flame""","[14, 24]","They've nailed it. They've absolutely nailed it. My long-going, seemingly insurmountable level of anticipation (three years worth) has been shattered. I am just blown away by the brilliance of Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. Yes, masterpiece.The Nolan brothers and David Goyer created a story that is wonderfully complex and truly gripping. They drew pieces from some of the best parts of Batman classics like The Long Halloween, The Man Who Laughs, The Killing Joke, and surely many others (those are just what came to mind as I watched) and made something possibly even better. This isn't your usual throwaway piece of pop culture entertainment. It's much closer to art. The screenplay says so many intriguing things about humanity. Where is the proverbial line? How far can it be pushed to achieve what is ultimately a good and honorable goal? What is true heroism? When the chips are down, how will people react? These are the questions we're faced with. The Dark Knight doesn't presume to answer them for us, but it challenges us to discover the answers for ourselves. I've read several articles that go so far as to say that they think the film is being political, but I argue otherwise. I can't speak for the filmmakers, so maybe I'm wrong. However, the challenging topics of this film have been explored in countless Batman stories over a span of 70 years. These aren't new ideas to the Batman mythos. If anything, this just proves how relevant Batman continues to be, generation after generation.As for the film's technical aspects, let's talk about the guy most responsible for this film: Christopher Nolan. Can this guy make a bad film? Film by film, Nolan's been cementing himself as one of the great directors of our time. Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige.... these are all amazing, top-tier films. And now, with The Dark Knight, I think everyone is going to finally realize just how good this guy is. And how about Wally Pfister's cinematography? Just gorgeous, gorgeous stuff. The score is very well done, too. It feels like a natural progression of the themes presented in Batman Begins. The new, much talked about one-note-based theme for The Joker works exceptionally well. And, of course, this wouldn't be a Batman film without some great action. Aerial stunts, car chases, explosions, and plenty of fight sequences.... The Dark Knight is a jolt of caffeine that keeps your heart racing from start to finish.While the action sequences and stunts are amazing, the more intimate scenes are the heart of the film. As a prime example, an interrogation scene between The Batman and The Joker honestly just shocked me. I figured their interaction would be good.... but it's much, much better than that. It's amazing to see such great character work in a blockbuster. And not only is it great character work, but the fabled complex relationship between Batman and The Joker is portrayed perfectly. At one point in the film, The Joker says this to Batman: ""You won't kill me, out of some misguided morality, and I won't kill you because you're just too much fun. I think we're destined to do this forever."" Just perfect. Talk about a Batman fan's dream come true....One thing I don't think I can say enough about (and can't really do justice for anyway) is this interpretation of The Joker. After this performance, The Joker is definitely Ledger's. I can't imagine his take ever being topped. The Joker has always been one of the classic literary villains just aching for an accurate big-screen portrayal and man, Heath did it better than I could've ever hoped. He's somehow managed to pull off being funny, sadistic, charismatic, and downright frightening all at once. You can't take your eyes off the guy. And you can't decide whether you want to laugh or throw up when you hear his jokes. And often when he does make you laugh, you feel bad for doing so. That, my friends, is The Joker. And most importantly, this Joker is the perfect opposition for The Batman.... a true and constant threat that challenges him in nearly every way imaginable. Everyone's talking posthumous Oscar for Heath and I sure hope he not only gets nominated, but that he wins. This performance is just that good.I also really, really appreciate the other new central character: Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Eckhart's Harvey is noble, yet cocky and angry enough before the accident to really sell it when Harvey is horribly injured and unleashes his darker side. I have to give some serious credit to the writers here, as well, for adapting the character so well. The tragic side of the character comes across perfectly. The rest of the performances are solid, too. I love the way Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman have elevated these films. These guys are some of the best we have and never seem to disappoint. Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a welcome addition to the cast replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Going in, I think I would've preferred Katie Holmes to stick around just for continuity sake, but Gyllenhaal does such a fine job that it's really not an issue.But who is this picture about? The Batman, of course, and they're continuing to get him absolutely right. Christian Bale is just an excellent Bruce Wayne. He's perfected the ""fake Bruce Wayne"" by acting like a silly rich drunkard, womanizer, and egomaniac. He's hilarious a lot of the time, but we never forget just how selfless of an act it really is. He also embodies the real Bruce Wayne which only Alfred and Rachel (and Fox to some degree) truly know. And last, but definitely not least, he's a heck of a Batman. In The Dark Knight, you can tell Batman is maturing. He's becoming the signature Batman who pushes the line of what's decent and acceptable. He walks the razor's edge every night. He's also becoming more self-sufficient. We see him doing more detective work. We see him making technological advances with little or no help from Lucius Fox. As for the title of the film: Batman truly becomes The Dark Knight in this story. The decisions he makes throughout the film show us this progression. And the decision he makes at the end of the film is one of the most refreshing takes on heroism and selflessness that I've ever seen put on film.I think it's safe to say that after this no one will ever look at the ""comic book genre"" the same again (if it's even fair to label this artistic vision as such). This is the father -- or The Godfather, as many critics have said -- of the genre. Look, I love Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and The Godfather. Those are fantastic films that I could watch over and over again. But I'm going to go ahead and say it: this is the best film I've ever seen. Yes, probably all of those films (and many others) will always have a bigger impact on the history and future of filmmaking, but the quality of this film -- groundbreaking for the genre -- combined with my love of the Batman character and his world leave me completely unable to say otherwise. The film also, of course, dethrones the great Batman Begins as my favorite film of all-time. Begins did a magnificent job exploring the origins of the character, but along with its main theme, ""escalation,"" The Dark Knight just takes things to a whole new level. Finally, we've gotten the film that will almost certainly be met with unanimous agreement as the definitive take on the character. This is The Batman.... this is The Dark Knight.",5,He's the hero that Gotham deserves...,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,7488,"[""'ve"", 'nailed', ""'ve"", 'absolutely', 'nailed', 'My', 'long-going',

Like anything else in pop-culture, for every ten people who love it there are ten more who think it's terrible, or boring, or too violent.The movie is not terrible.  It is fast-paced and entertaining.  Nolan starts with a number of threads at the beginning and brings them all together by the mid-point of the picture.""The Dark Knight"" is faster paced than ""Batman Begins"" but that is to be expected because with any good comic-book or superhero adaptation...the first movie should always be about the backstory or how Batman came to be Batman.  Sometimes it is done well like in ""Iron Man"" or ""Batman Begins"" and sometimes you get ""The Fantastic Four""These movies are almost like the James Bond movies in that the movie is only as good as its villian.  In this regard it is Heath Ledger that takes this movie the extra mile.  Many in here have said that if he didn't die soon afterwords there would have been no big deal over his performance...that could not be more untrue.  His performance has nothing to do with his death.  He delivered the most chillingly real picture of evil on the screen since Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs.""  The performance was picture perfect, from the designer suits, to the unkept hair, to the tick of sticking out his tongue like a serpent.Helping balance the chaos on that side are real grounded performances from Christian Bale and Gary Olman (I defy anyone to find a movie in which he gived a subpar performance!)The special effects are fantastic, but they never become a crutch for Nolan because at its heart this is a character study.  Some would probably have liked 2+ hours of mayhem, but those are probably the same people who hated ""3:10 to Yuma"" because there were not enough shoot-outs.  These movies are about the men behind the action, not the action itself.I am dissappointed by the lack of features.

The real world is in a dark place: The economy is failing, terror-wars are raging, and the climate is threatening our existence. Usually superheroes help us escape the bitter pill of our reality. This is not the case with The Dark Knight. The film takes us on a hellish nihilistic ride that is never soothing yet somehow manages to be darkly beautiful and strangely entertaining. Perhaps this movie reflects our real fears in the controllable enviroment of a movie theater. There is an uneasy sense of safety sitting in one's seat as a world worse than our own goes down in flames.I don't know which is scarier in this film: Heath Ledger's soul scorching performance as The JoKer(how much of this was really acting?) or watching good guy Harvey Dent's fall from grace. Either way, both are more important to the core of this film than the hero, Batman. Batman serves as a foil for the nihilistic JoKer. Batman's life seems to be the only one the Joker cares about.

He showed promise with Brokeback Mountain and in The Dark Knight he cements the fact that he was more than just that guy from that teen movie that was based on a work by Shakespeare, but it won't happen.Oddly enough, this isn't the only saddening part about the film; pretty much every aspect is, other than Ledger's pitch perfect performance.  It needs to be said: Christian Bale cannot act; ok he did a marvelous job in The Prestige, but that's a one time deal apparently.  He's a horrid batman, not as bad as Clooney, but he's still unwatchable.  Batman's supposed to have a gruff voice, I know this, but it's not supposed to sound like he's belching his lines, it's that simple.For a film that's over 2 hours long it sure promised a lot, built up a great deal of expectations and then just completely fizzled by the end of it.I'm sick of Morgan Freeman always, ALWAYS, playing the same role; the old wise man with an insightful perspective and reserved manner; does the man have no range?  Please, someone give me a pointer to a film where he doesn't do the same old.  Maggie Gyllenhall was absolutely awful as well, my lord, the bad performances are everywhere, so much so that they basically could have just edited it to the point where it's all Ledger's show and nothing else.The directing was nothing special, the story wasn't anything they couldn't have fit into a 23 minute episode of the cartoon, and the attempt to resonate a deep philosophical perspective is marred by the fact that it's just not well written or acted or directed.

Christian Bale reprises the role as Batman/Bruce Wayne in this dark take on Batman. With the help of  Lt. Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent Batman hopes to bring down the new villain in town, the psychotic Joker. When the Joker takes Bruce's love interest (Rachel Dawes) hostage Batman takes a darker turn and all hell breaks loose. This is one of the best Batman films to ever come out. The disturbingly yet amazing dark performance from Heath Ledger makes The Dark Knight a must own blu-ray.

What is happening with the world and it's understanding of what makes a great film or a classic? The past few years have given the world a whole slew of highly praised films that are pretty much just good but not great. All the buzz got me really excited, but this film hardly resembles the dramatic praise everyone has been chanting about it.The script is at times downright stupid, predictable, and inept. Christian Bale is not the worst Batman eve, but runs a close second, and his Batman alter ego voice is so bad I found my self laughing hysterically at how bad it was. Gary Oldman, a wonderful actor, is lovable but miscast as Gordon in my opinion. Heath Ledger(R.I.P)is brilliant but not anywhere as interesting as Nicholson's rendering of the character. Ledger's performance was good but nothing to blab about really. But Nicholson's Joker was wonderful.And finally, the stellar talent of great actors like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are wasted here in this critically overblown outing of the Batman saga. One only needs to refer back to Tim Burton's two classic Batman films to understand why I didn't care for this attempt so much. Both of Burton's Batman films were full of movie magic, memorable action, well cast actors, twists and turns at every corner, and lots and lots of some of the finest film making ever done for a comic book to screen movie. Some actors here were so wooden I could barely stand it.I absolutely cannot believe how many people have called this film ""The greatest film of the year"", ""The best movie I have ever seen"", ""A masterpiece"".

659884,A2B8G7W3JXKMZA,B00005JPY0,"Randolph Bradley ""RBJ""","[2, 4]","After hearing and reading all that is said about the Dark Knight, I can add that there are strong performances from all actors.  The Joker is the best I've ever seen, because he is defined as a ""moralist,"" and not just a madman.  His conviction is no worse than any belligerent nationalist, dictator, or ultra conservative.  In my understanding, everyone is either a madman or a saint; it depends on who needs what you have.  Nevertheless, Batman is as mysterious as ever, showing his human weaknesses, which makes him more charming.  Policeman, Lt. Gordon, doesn't distract from the big picture, but facilitates sympathy for the police department, and innocent citizens, maintaining sanity, while everybody else is variable.  Lucius Fox, gadget genius, is dedicated to always doing the ""right thing,"" and solidifies the trio of himself, Batman, and Alfred, the manservant, who all work together to keep Batman alive.  The district attorney, Harvey Dent, is as memorable as the Joker is, because he has a yin/yang quality, some light and dark all rolled into one that, when viewed objectively, makes their choices inevitable.  We just should be thankful that our environment hasn't driven us to such extremes.  I can feel some pity for the Joker, because he sees the corruption of government just as that of organized crime, and is truly ""mad"" trying to even the playing field.  Of course, he just adds to the problem, but the point is that the good guys are not all that good; they just fight on that side.All in all, this is a great movie.  I saw it in IMAX, which just adds more length and width to the screen, and more decibels to the speakers.  A regular-sized theater screen is probably just as good.  This film would be great viewing on even an iPod.In conclusion, The Dark Knight is like a finely blended alcoholic cocktail, made with 200 Proof liquor (100% liquor) and fresh fruit juices.  Although the natural juices will disguise the strong booze taste, in a little while, you will be affected by the liquor.  I left the theater feeling a little more deranged by the dynamic sounds, visions, and morality of it all.",5,Strong Performances From All,1217721600,"08 3, 2008",2008,2126,"['hearing', 'reading', 'said', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'can', 'add', 'are', 'strong', 'performances', 'actors', 'Joker', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'defined', 'moralist', 'not', 'just', 'madman', 'conviction', 'worse', 'belligerent', 'nationalist', 'dictator', 'ultra', 'conservative', 'understanding', 'everyone', 'madman', 'saint', 'who', 'what', 'have', 'Nevertheless', 'Batman', 'as', 'mysterious', 'ever', 'showing', 'human', 'weaknesses', 'more', 'charming', 'Policeman', 'Lt.', 'Gordon', ""n't"", 'distract', 'big', 'picture', 'sympathy', 'police', 'department', 'innocent', 'citizens', 'maintaining', 'sanity', 'everybody', 'else', 'variable', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'gadget', 'genius', 'dedicated', 'always', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'trio', 'Batman', 'Alfred', 'manservant', 'who', 'work', 'together', 'keep', 'Batman', 'alive', 'district', 'attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'as', 'memorable', 'Joker', 'yin/yang', 'quality', 'light', 'dark', 'rolled', 'one', 'when', 'viewed', 'objectively', 'choices', 'inevitable', 'just', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', 'environment', ""n't"", 'driven', 'such', 'extremes', 'can', 'feel', 'pity', 'Joker', 'corruption', 'government', 'just', 'organized', 'crime', 'truly', 'mad', 'trying', 'even', 'playing', 'field', 'course', 'just', 'problem', 'point', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'just', 'fight', 'side.All', 'great', 'movie', 'saw', 'IMAX', 'just', 'more', 'length', 'width', 'screen', 'more', 'decibels', 'speakers', 'regular-sized', 'theater', 'screen', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'viewing', 'even', 'iPod.In', 'conclusion', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'finely', 'blended', 'alcoholic', 'cocktail', 'made', '200', 'Proof', 'liquor', '100', '%', 'liquor', 'fresh', 'fruit', 'juices', 'natural', 'juices', 'will', 'disguise', 'strong', 'booze', 'taste', 'little', 'while', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'liquor', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'little', 'more', 'deranged', 'dynamic', 'sounds', 'visions', 'morality']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Heath Ledger as the joker. and what can be said? the man was amazing. he is THE Joker. this role solidifies his stance as one of todays best young actors, if not the best. his death truly was a tragedy. when watching this movie, you may forget thats Heath Ledger behind all the make up, he is so into character its not even funny.Christain Bale, Morgan Freeman, and everyone else were as solid as possible. Maggie Gyllenhall was a massive improvement over Katie Holmes as well.

659900,A3OQF09LQFQGEB,B00005JPY0,Resident55011,"[1, 3]","First let me state I am a big Batman fan. When the 1989 Tim Burton Batman movie was announced like a lot of people I was thrilled and couldn't wait to see it. It promised to be dark and edgy and I couldn't wait to see Batman on the big screen finally done right. Then I saw it and well...I was very dissapointed. I personally felt it had a lot of campiness and although Jack Nicholson as the Joker was fun to watch he was too comical and never felt like that big a threat to Batman. Then the following movies just got worse, especially when Joel Schumacker took over it became the TV series all over again. I was saddened by this because a lot of good comic book movies were coming out and yet I still had not seen a Batman movie the way I thought it should be.Then I read about Batman Begins coming out and what it was suppose to be about. I was excited in one way but I was also very concerned it would be screwed up yet again. I saw it at midnight showing and was glued to my seat. This movie was GREAT. No campiness the Scarecrow (who at first I admit I wasn't excited about seeing) was scary and actually made my girlfriend jump in her seat. I could now see clearly why bad guys feared Batman. This movie was so good I went and saw it again the following morning. the part and at the end when Batman holds the Joker card made you eager for the sequal. Although I desperately couldn't wait to see the sequal to this I was worried, I thought ""How could it possibly be as good as the first one?""Then The Dark Knight was released. I avoided watching previews or listening to hype because I wanted to be surprised, sometimes in previews they show the best parts of movies and I wanted to avoid that. I went with a large group of friends also all eager to see this movie and it wasn't as good as Batman Begins...it was better. They bring out Gordons concern of escalation in a huge way in this movie. Heath Ledger as the Joker although a huge concern for me when I first heard he was going to play him turned out great. I literally forgot I was watching Heath Ledger and only saw the Joker. To me he was perfect. He had the craziness the Joker needed, he was scary and very, very evil. He is supposed to be Batmans primary nemesis and in this movie he truly was. Batman had to break rules to catch him. Aaron Echart also did a terrific job as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. You see although he is Gotham's white Knight he isn't exactly stable and is capable of breaking wich of course he does. Although I felt Two-Face should have been in it a bit more his presense was great and he is the best looking/scariest Two-Face I have ever seen. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel was also great. She did a great job and much better than Katie Holmes. I do not think Katie Holmes is a bad actress but she just wasn't as good as the other actors in Batman Begins so she stood out. Casting Maggie in this movie was a good move. I also respect that she had to fill the shoes of someone who had played her before and give off existing feelings for Bruce wayne, I felt she did that very well and I had no problem accepting her as Rachel. Miahcal Caine and Morgan Freeman always do an outstanding job and they continue to do so in this movie. One of my favorate scenes in the movie is when Batman is using his sonar vision and Fox is explaining to him what is going on. This movie has a lot of emotion in it, it shows the best and the worst parts of all of us but in the end shows we can be great. It illustrates this well but doesn't beat you over the head with it. I personally loved this movie but as stated earlier I am a batman fan.If you haven't seen this movie yet or you are thinking about buying it, I suggest the Blu-Ray version. The picture on the standard definition is really bad and you can tell Warner Bros. threw everything (picture wise) into the Blu-Ray release. One thing that is interesting is some shots are filmed on an Imax camera. During these shots in the Blu-Ray version the aspect ratio changes, it is not distracting and you only notice if you are specifically looking at the black bars. I watched this with my Girlfriend and brother and neither of them noticed. I am not really sure why they did this though because the Imax shots are suppose to look sharper and better but to me the entire movie was sharp and the Imax scenes did not seem any sharper or clearer than the rest of the movie. But that is just my opinion.Bottom line is, if you haven't seen this movie yet please do not listen to hype or reviews or anything else, go see it for yourself. It may suprise you.",5,Batman and Joker the way it should be.,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,4570,"['First', 'let', 'state', 'am', 'big', 'Batman', 'fan', 'When', '1989', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman', 'movie', 'was', 'announced', 'lot', 'people', 'was', 'thrilled', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'promised', 'be', 'dark', 'edgy', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Batman', 'big', 'screen', 'finally', 'done', 'right', 'Then', 'saw', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'dissapointed', 'personally', 'felt', 'had', 'lot', 'campiness', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'too', 'comical', 'never', 'felt', 'big', 'threat', 'Batman', 'Then', 'following', 'movies', 'just', 'got', 'worse', 'especially', 'when', 'Joel', 'Schumacker', 'took', 'became', 'TV', 'series', 'again', 'was', 'saddened', 'lot', 'good', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'were', 'coming', 'out', 'yet', 'still', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Batman', 'movie', 'way', 'thought', 'should', 'be.Then', 'read', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'coming', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'was', 'excited', 'one', 'way', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'concerned', 'would', 'be', 'screwed', 'up', 'yet', 'again', 'saw', 'midnight', 'showing', 'was', 'glued', 'seat', 'movie', 'was', 'GREAT', 'No', 'campiness', 'Scarecrow', 'who', 'first', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'excited', 'seeing', 'was', 'scary', 'actually', 'made', 'girlfriend', 'jump', 'seat', 'could', 'now', 'see', 'clearly', 'why', 'bad', 'guys', 'feared', 'Batman', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'went', 'saw', 'again', 'following', 'morning', 'part', 'end', 'when', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'card', 'made', 'eager', 'sequal', 'desperately', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'sequal', 'was', 'worried', 'thought', 'How', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'Then', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'released', 'avoided', 'watching', 'previews', 'listening', 'hype', 'wanted', 'be', 'surprised', 'sometimes', 'previews', 'show', 'best', 'parts', 'movies', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'went', 'large', 'group', 'friends', 'also', 'all', 'eager', 'see', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Batman', 'was', 'better', 'bring', 'out', 'Gordons', 'concern', 'escalation', 'huge', 'way', 'movie', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'huge', 'concern', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'turned', 'out', 'great', 'literally', 'forgot', 'was', 'watching', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'only', 'saw', 'Joker', 'was', 'perfect', 'had', 'craziness', 'Joker', 'needed', 'was', 'scary', 'very', 'very', 'evil', 'supposed', 'be', 'Batmans', 'primary', 'nemesis', 'movie', 'truly', 'was', 'Batman', 'had', 'break', 'rules', 'catch', 'Aaron', 'Echart', 'also', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'Harvey', 'Dent/Two-Face', 'see', 'Gotham', 'white', 'Knight', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'stable', 'capable', 'breaking', 'wich', 'course', 'felt', 'Two-Face', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'presense', 'was', 'great', 'best', 'looking/scariest', 'Two-Face', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Rachel', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'much', 'better', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'bad', 'actress', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'other', 'actors', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'stood', 'out', 'Casting', 'Maggie', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'also', 'respect', 'had', 'fill', 'shoes', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'give', 'off', 'existing', 'feelings', 'Bruce', 'wayne', 'felt', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'had', 'problem', 'accepting', 'Rachel', 'Miahcal', 'Caine', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'always', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'movie', 'One', 'favorate', 'scenes', 'movie', 'when', 'Batman', 'using', 'sonar', 'vision', 'Fox', 'explaining', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'lot', 'emotion', 'best', 'worst', 'parts', 'end', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'well', ""n't"", 'beat', 'head', 'personally', 'loved', 'movie', 'stated', 'earlier', 'am', 'batman', 'fan.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'are', 'thinking', 'buying', 'suggest', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'picture', 'standard', 'definition', 'really', 'bad', 'can', 'tell', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'threw', 'everything', 'picture', 'wise', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'One', 'thing', 'interesting', 'shots', 'are', 'filmed', 'Imax', 'camera', 'shots', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'changes', 'not', 'distracting', 'only', 'notice', 'are', 'specifically', 'looking', 'black', 'bars', 'watched', 'Girlfriend', 'brother', 'noticed', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'did', 'though', 'Imax', 'shots', 'are', 'suppose', 'look', 'sharper', 'better', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'sharp', 'Imax', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'sharper', 'clearer', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'opinion.Bottom', 'line', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'listen', 'hype', 'reviews', 'anything', 'else', 'go', 'see', 'may', 'suprise']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659902,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B00005JPY0,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[3, 5]","""The Dark Knight"" is brilliant.This is the Superhero flick evolved: once thirty minutes or so of screen time elapses the realisation suddenly dawns on you that this is A. not just another flashy movie full of staid dialogue and cheesy FX, and B. it's extremely enjoyable.Christopher Nolan's tense, brooding follow-up to his own canonical ""Batman Begins"" hits home runs on almost all fronts, not least of which are the visuals: his bald-faced, unpretentious way of showcasing the blazing action set-pieces, or the more reigned-in scenes of human conflict, is excellent: there are no cheap camera tricks (or at least, no noticeable ones) here and Nolan manages to create a very real sense of Gotham-on-the-edge with his camera. The breathless excitement in the film's opening bank sequence sets the tone: without any help from fake-looking CGI we're thrown headlong and without explanation into the midst of a very tense and visually pleasing robbery set-piece. Happily, most of the rest of the movie follows suit.Acting is top-drawer, Bale gives another fantastic performance as Bruce Wayne, and, while he still comes off slightly stiff as Batman, that's not really his fault: the voice manipulator makes him sound sort of like a broken Terminator. But that's a small quibble: Bale is a very great actor and does a very great job as Gotham's protector.Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman make for a skilled and hugely successful supporting team: their roles are small and somewhat perfunctory but the actors don't let them slide as such; rather, Commissioner Gordon,  Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox turn out to be very memorable secondary characters from a fantastic movie, and without whom certainly ""The Dark Knight"" wouldn't have recaptured the same sense of fullness as ""Batman Begins"". Maggie Gyllenhaal is similarly memorable as assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes: her interrogation scene, as one example, shows Rachel as a powerful, intelligent, bright woman, and this provides a great counterpoint to Bale's Bruce Wayne. Aaron Eckhart is a truly great Harvey Dent, there's no sentimental or cloying ""Good Guy"" aspects to his thoroughly good-and-moral character - as a secondary villain in a movie whose cast roster is already overflowing Eckhart's talent means Harvey Dent is one of ""The Dark Knight's"" more memorable characters.Joker is whole and satisfying and enthralling, and Ledger's performance should get him awards. I didn't once think of Heath Ledger when watching the Joker, and, considering the tragedy surrounding the actor, that's high praise indeed: Ledger's strength of performance lifts you out of reality and throws you into the madness that is Gotham City at his mercy. Without any nostalgia, without the media frenzy over his death, without any leniency or tendency towards misty rose-coloured glasses for the actor himself: he's incredible, and brilliant. These are words I do not use often when reviewing films :-)Music is occasional and beautiful, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer are to be congratulated on a fine and affecting score to match a fine and affecting movie. Nathan Crowley's production design continues a trend from ""Batman Begins"" - ""The Dark Knight"" looks mostly plausible and very real. Witness Joker's deeply unsettling look, the utilitarian realism of the new ""Batcave"", the way the Hong Kong setpiece borders on James Bond but never leaves us rolling our eyes for unbelievability.So what's wrong with ""The Dark Knight""?Well, the story's a little confused towards the ending: there's two sets of story climax and only one of them really works, by the time Batman is dashing through a construction site the plot has, unfortunately, taken a back seat to the visuals, and this is out-of-character for the rest of the film. Still, this is one relatively short scene and doesn't ruin the overall movie at all. Also, we do not get enough of Two-Face - particularly since Aaron Eckhart's just so very good in the role - and this potentially excellent villain winds up as a sort-of afterthought.Some major character-related events occur and we don't get to see much of how this affects the others: this is slightly unreal - and particularly so, since ""Batman Begins"" was in large part about dealing with interpersonal relationships and how they affect us. And there are one or two jarringly hi-tech bits of equipment that Batman uses which appear to be very out-of-place and scream ""Merchandise! Merchandise!"" at us.But who cares? These bad points don't ruin the overall enjoyment and theme of ""The Dark Knight"" - not at all - and if they weren't present then ""The Dark Knight"" would be the all-time pinnacle of the Superhero movie. As is, ""The Dark Knight"" is a truly brilliant experience - a movie for adults that just happens to have a Superhero theme running through it as opposed to a children's movie made to sell toys and videogames.Get to the cinema! I can't recommend this one highly enough: definitely my best summer movie and one of the best I've seen all year.

659906,A3L3OKIPMLGAUK,B00005JPY0,Ricardo C.,"[5, 9]","Let me start off by saying that I was not impressed by the dullness of Batman Begins. The Dark Knight, despite it's deperate attempt to have meaning, come off as far too self-important. The only thing has seemed to improve between the two films is the action and the characterizations still remain limp.The opening action sequence reflects this workman-like character of the Joker. What is a fine opening for a Micheal Mann action thriller, and bearing very simular photography, just reflects the films un-remarkable nature. The Joker, Batman's greatest foe because he is the antithesis of rational thought in all aspects of life, is a very conservative terrorist for ""chaos"" in Nolan's interpretation. Going back to this bank heist, he murders his accomplises by having them kill each-other or shooting them personally. This is a very efficient villian but not the Joker. His murders like these thugs and liquidating the mob's power with deceit and explosives is boring for such an off-the-wall maniac who's most famous episodes in comic books included selling poisoned fish and running for Govenor. Joker spouts his prententious messages constantly as the bringer of chaos but in a not so chaotic matter. He seems to be operating for the sake of nothing in this film, it's not chaos but more like who he dosen't want to see running Gotham. Joker claims Batman completes him but there interaction in this film is almost nil. They have a few breif personal, and painful, encounters but why would Joker be fascinated by Batman in particular ? True he did foil of his encounters at one point but it was a loud, noisy, chase, through-out the streets of Gotham, the intimacy wasn't present; Cleary the writers took advantage of the fact that Batman and The Joker have been enemies in the comics for decades so why bother to establish their relationship.Another thing is Joker seems none too interested in being a serial killer or even a public harm. He scares them and kills one civilian dressed up as Batman but it all relates to the forces between ""good"" and ""evil"", it's not the common man. The finale was the only time he was after people but he still came off as a common and un-remarkable terrorist and more of the writer's desperate attempt to hammer in post-9/11 themes; We all know people can be sick and cruel, etc. so to try and sell this tripe to an audience of living adults is fruitless. The Joker should have committed, real random acts of crime for the sake of his own pleasure, a perverted ""clown"" who decided that has his fun with the public and the Batman. Heath Ledger comes off as a living, breathing, psycho and a feeling uncomfort does crawl on one's skin but his part is written so un-remarkably; A fine preformance that derserved better writing.The secound villian introduced here is Harvey Dent who becomes the villian Two-Face at the climax of the film. He is pratically a non-entity in this film who, like everyone else in this film, LOVES spouting the obvious like ""You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time. But you were wrong. The world is cruel, and the only morality in a cruel world is chance.""Haven't we had enough of that from The Joker who also was hammering that theme already ? As the crusading DA he is as robotic as the Bale Batman, not too concerned about being torn between his loved ones and just out for justice. Hollywood needs to see that just because a handsome man is with a beautiful woman, that is enough to call it a ""relationship"". I also can't believe how he evolved during the course of this film. Sure there was foreshadowing to his turn to evil by privately interrogating and nearly killing a man but why would he attack Batman and Gordon ? His beef was with the mob. Yes, I know it's all about how he blamed himself and others but that dosen't make much sense when he believed it was Sal Maroni who maimed him and killed Rachel Dawes.I would liked to have seen Dent transform much earlier in the film so he could attack the mobsters without consequence; The role the writers decided, incorrectly, the Joker should occupy.There is not much to cover with Dawes or Alfred. I mean they really layed on the prentention for both of them. Everytime Alfred speaks it's only something corny about Batman doing good in the world even when, I think, he was suppose to be consuling Bruce Wayne when Harvey Dent is killed and Rachel Dawes died. Dawes herself is still just a talking head but now shes conflicted between having Harvey or Bruce and I can't say I have any sypathy when these characters are so robotic.Overall, the film improves on the action which was pretty badly done in the previous Nolan effort. However Batman himself is just as bland and brooding as ever, scarficing himself at the end but not for much reason. It's clear how much this film borrows from Jeph Loeb's brilliant graphic novels The Long Holloween and Dark Victory but they got everything mixed up for this film. It was Dent who should have been the main villian and Joker his accomplice who should have eventually fractured him, that would have been perfect. Above all, the ending was idiotic. Batman was suppose to be the symbol of Gotham's hope. True he seems a bit more human here trying to possibly retire from the role as Gotham's savior and have Harvey Dent as DA taking the responsibility. However, Dent became a killer and died and now the Batman must scarifice himself to look like a villian ? A dead matyr can only last for so long so essentially Batman's actions at the conclusion of this film were obtuse. A fine action film with some spectacular stunts, some of the most creative years, but a very shallow film that tries to be a lot more than it is.",2,A good action film,1283558400,"09 4,

I knew that Christopher Nolan would get this right once again, but even that wasn't enough.In 2006 we saw the first image of the new Joker. Then was time for Harvey Dent. My God. I trembled. It all seems like it was yesterday, and I feel like Heath Ledger is still alive.The whole cast shines here.Christian Bale was perfect in Batman Begins, and here he continues to impress. His Batman is what we all waited to see on the big screen: haunting! Scaring! Intimidating. Bale gives Batman the right feel, the right personality, he simply shines on this role. Every time he is Bruce Wayne he does the suave executive of Wayne Enterprises with a tragic and well known past. But when he becomes Batman, thugs, beware!! He does someone that knows no fear and no bounds to make justice. Also, he does that angry and gritty voice to show his anger and to intimidate his foes. Bale here is a hell of a star. As the movie goes on, he realizes that he will have to embrace his cowl for the rest of his days to make justice. It's very beautiful how, in the end, he decided to turn into the ""bad guy"" to save everyone and to save the image and reputation of that man who in that moment was the hero the city needs, and not what it deserves. He becomes a truly Dark Knight. Bravo!As for Ledger, his incarnation of the Joker is masterful! It won a well deserved Golden Globe and an Oscar. His Joker is haunting, scaring, funny in a dark sense. He intimidates even the worst hitman of the mob. Ledger's Joker have no past, no reason to do what he does, and that's that. He is just a force of evil, an agent of chaos, as he defines himself. And he brings hell, even to Batman, turning himself into Batman's distorted reflect in the mirror, or in his other side of the card, as it shows in the end of the movie, in the outstanding confrontation between both.As for the other cast, Aaron Eckhart is a very competent Harvey Dent and the perfect incarnation of Two-Face! Oldman is the perfect Gordon, and he shows that since Batman Begins. Maggie stands as the best version of Rachel Dawes. Cillian Murphy returns as the Scarecrow and continues to do his wonderful job he started in Begins.All in all, this is a truly masterpiece of crime, drama and tragedy. A dark masterpiece, inspired by the bonds of the very best noir and police productions of all time.So, forget about the fact that the DVD is very limited and watch it of what it have best: The Dark Knight!",5,Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,2525,"['followed', 'whole', 'internet', 'campaing', 'movie', 'wait', 'was', 'horrendous', 'knew', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'would', 'get', 'right', 'once', 'again', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough.In', '2006', 'saw', 'first', 'image', 'new', 'Joker', 'Then', 'was', 'time', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'My', 'God', 'trembled', 'was', 'yesterday', 'feel', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'still', 'alive.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'shines', 'here.Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'perfect', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'here', 'impress', 'Batman', 'what', 'waited', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'haunting', 'Scaring', 'Intimidating', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'right', 'feel', 'right', 'personality', 'simply', 'role', 'time', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'suave', 'executive', 'Wayne', 'Enterprises', 'tragic', 'well', 'known', 'past', 'when', 'Batman', 'thugs', 'beware', 'someone', 'fear', 'bounds', 'make', 'justice', 'Also', 'angry', 'gritty', 'voice', 'show', 'anger', 'intimidate', 'foes', 'Bale', 'here', 'hell', 'star', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'embrace', 'cowl', 'rest', 'days', 'make', 'justice', 'very', 'beautiful', 'how', 'end', 'decided', 'turn', 'bad', 'guy', 'save', 'everyone', 'save', 'image', 'reputation', 'man', 'who', 'moment', 'was', 'hero', 'city', 'needs', 'not', 'what', 'truly', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Bravo', 'Ledger', 'incarnation', 'Joker', 'masterful', 'won', 'well', 'deserved', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Oscar', 'Joker', 'haunting', 'scaring', 'funny', 'dark', 'sense', 'even', 'worst', 'hitman', 'mob', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'have', 'past', 'reason', 'do', 'what', 'just', 'force', 'evil', 'agent', 'chaos', 'hell', 'even', 'Batman', 'turning', 'Batman', 'distorted', 'reflect', 'mirror', 'other', 'side', 'card', 'end', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'confrontation', 'both.As', 'other', 'cast', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'very', 'competent', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'perfect', 'incarnation', 'Two-Face', 'Oldman', 'perfect', 'Gordon', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Maggie', 'best', 'version', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'returns', 'Scarecrow', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'started', 'Begins.All', 'truly', 'masterpiece', 'crime', 'drama', 'tragedy', 'dark', 'masterpiece', 'inspired', 'bonds', 'very', 'best', 'noir', 'police', 'productions', 'time.So', 'forget', 'fact', 'DVD', 'very', 'limited', 'watch', 'what', 'have', 'best', 'Dark', 'Knight']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

J Rey,"[1, 2]","Director Christopher Nolan and star Christian Bale continue to keep the Batman franchise strong in the highly anticipated summer blockbuster ""The Dark Knight"". With the help of Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Batman (Bale) seeks to take down organized crime in Gotham City. Batman soon finds himself facing a psychopathic criminal mastermind known only as the Joker (Heath Ledger) who unleashes a wave of terror that plunges Gotham City into fear and chaos. ""The Dark Knight"" is a thrilling and fully engrossing comic book spectacle that ranks as one of the best films of 2008. With its well crafted storyline, serious tone and strong moral dilemmas, director Christopher Nolan delivers an exciting thrill ride that truly redefines the standards of the comic book movie. The action sequences and visual effects are excellent. Christian Bale and Heath Ledger give memorable performances. The cast also includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts, Nestor Carbonell, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine.Warner Bros. certainly put some effort in the Blu-Ray release of ""The Dark Knight"". The 2008 record-setting comic book blockbuster is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is truly exceptional. This is one great looking Blu-Ray. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD sound is very dynamic. ""Gotham Uncovered: Creation of a Scene"" is an extensive behind-the-scenes featurette that offers abundant information in the development of the movie. Other special features include two in-depth featurettes, six short clips of the fictional newscast ""Tonight in Gotham"", picture galleries, theatrical trailers and TV spots.

659915,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B00005JPY0,RJ Smoove,"[2, 3]","Where do I begin? The Dark Knight is not only the best sequel, it's arguably the best comic book adaptation ever made. It picks up right where Batman Begins left off with the Joker's calling card in Jim Gordon's (Gary Oldman) evidence baggie. There's not much that I can say about this movie that has not been said over, and over, again. One thing I can say is, if you did not like this movie at all, then this definitely isn't the genre you should be experimenting with. I'm definitely no judge of tastes in film, because a couple of my guilty pleasures are the widely hated G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The Dark Knight has so much more to like than the average comic book film. Rather than focusing on setting up spectacular action set pieces like most movies of the genre, Christopher Nolan puts drama and chaotic suspense at the heart of this one. We've all seen the original Batman, so there's no need for the Joker to run around Gotham with a Tommy gun like he did in Tim Burton's take. Without saying too much, I'll say that the Joker has a much bigger agenda in this film than he did the first time. From the start we are introduced to him in the midst of a well planned, and well choreographed bank heist, shot with state of the art IMAZ cameras. The picture is crystal clear in the IMAX scenes. That is definitely cinematography at its absolute best, thanks to not only Chris Nolan, but also his DP, Wally Pfister.Off the bat, we are meant to see just how intelligent the Joker really is, despite being the most qualified for a life sentence in Arkham Asylum. He has to be one of the most cold and calculating villains that I have ever seen. This Joker has no compassion, and nothing for the audience to sympathize with. He is truly a ""villain"", in every sense of the word. Never have I seen an actor capture the essence of a character from literature, and then expand upon it, as perfectly as Heath Ledger did with his. There has been much debate as to which actor was the best Joker. In my opinion neither came close to Mark Hamill's voice work for the animated series. All jokes aside, the performances in both movies are beyond amazing. I don't even find it necessary to label one as better, because they are both great. I honestly believe Heath Ledger would not have won Best Supporting Actor if he was still living due to Academy politics, but he more than deserved it, and I'm glad he won it post-mortem. We get all hung up on the joker, but all of the other actors in The Dark Knight did phenomenal jobs as well, especially Aaron Eckhart as Harvey 'Two Face' Dent. My only gripe was Katie Holmes not returning for her role, but over a billion dollars later, that's her problem. Christian Bale's Bat-growl was fine to me. That's a common complaint that I consider unnecessary nitpicking.I also have to mention my second favorite composer, Hans Zimmer returning from Batman Begins. The musical score in the two movies was another thing that I thought was damn near flawless. The plot of The Dark Knight addressed my only complaint about Batman Begins. There isn't anything I can think of in this movie that was too unrealistic in the advanced world we live in today. The premise is believable, and the story draws you in without ever letting go. No spoiler intended, but the way it ended left so much to the imagination. It appeared that the Joker would have had a guaranteed spot in the third film, but now I think they should just leave that character alone. Chris Nolan has a large task on his hands for The Dark Knight Rises, but as the saying goes, ""In Nolan I Trust."" Topping this sequel will be a challenge. Enough about the film, because by now we all know that The Dark Knight will be talked about for many years to come. As far as the transfer goes, it's pretty much reference material. As I mentioned before, the IMAX scenes are amazing. The standard scenes are great, but not on par with the IMAX ones. The audio is all you could want, and then some. As far as the extras go, there should have been a commentary, because this is such a landmark film. There should have been a memoriam for Heath Ledger. I would have appreciated a more in-depth ""making of"" documentary. But alas, what we have is what we have. I could go on and on, but there's really no point. Enough has been said about it.

659916,A3GB6RKLASF9HB,B00005JPY0,"R. Kearns-White ""rockiw""","[2, 3]","The Dark Knight was a brilliant movie despite being about 15-minutes too long. The movie was dark, philosophical, fast paced and action packed. Some critics will state that The Dark Knight was too dark or too philosophical for a ""funny book"" movie. People who say that are not too familiar with the world of comic books, and the alternate realities in which superheroes live. Never confuse a comic book with the bright bang-pow, drink-your-milk and say-your-prayers type of heroes in the Sunday papers' comic strips. Comic book heroes (and villains) who are brought to life on the big screen come with much depth and baggage that is ripe for exploring.The Dark Knight explores the yin and yang relationship of the Batman and the Joker. Good versus Evil. Order versus Anarchy. Without the existence (even the theoretical existence) of one, the other cannot exist. The Joker, with his scarred mouth and whacked-out make-up, points this out with glee to Batman. Batman as the vigilante hero has created a villain who elicits as much fear as Batman does hope. The Joker, with his guns and bombs, has thrown the Gotham City into a tailspin. The police, the mobsters, and the everyday folks don't know how to capture him. Batman and District Attorney Harvey Dent (a scene-stealing Aaron Eckhart) fight to control the chaos through the rules and laws they've privately and publicly promised to uphold.To say anymore would give away too many of the surprising and excellent plot twists. As Heath Ledger's more-than-excellent Joker keeps pushing the envelope of evil deeds, the audience stays riveted to their chairs and their eyes to the screen. Each time the Joker appears, the audience whoops in disbelief at his mayhem. Oh, s**t! Did the Joker just do that?  The audience struggles with Christian Bale's Batman and Harvey Dent's dilemma of stepping outside the boundaries of their laws to bring down the Joker.The actors all do a very fine job in their roles. Bale is an excellent Bruce Wayne, hamming it up as the millionaire playboy in order to keep is true identity a secret. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a sexy and fiery A.D.A and love interest of both Dent and Wayne. Aaron Eckhart, with his strong jaw and a cartoon superhero's chin, brings depth to his character's arc. And of course, there is the late Heath Ledger who is unrecognizable as he is so steeped in his character. He fully embodies the insanity of the Joker making him scarier than Jack Nicholson's over-the-top cartoonish performance from nearly 20-years-ago. You never look at this Joker and say ""Heath does a good Joker.""Christopher Nolan has made some very fine character movies, Memento and The Prestige, and he does great with the characters in this new Batman franchise. Unfortunately, it is hard to follow the action sequences. You get the idea in theory of what is happening, but you don't understand what you're seeing. That is the main flaw of The Dark Knight. Well, that, and the fact that you won't see anymore face-offs between the Joker and the Batman that is hinted near the climax of the movie.",4,Brillant Character Studies Brought Home,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,3067,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'being', '15-minutes', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'was', 'dark', 'philosophical', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'packed', 'critics', 'will', 'state', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'too', 'philosophical', 'funny', 'book', 'movie', 'People', 'who', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'familiar', 'world', 'comic', 'books', 'alternate', 'realities', 'superheroes', 'live', 'Never', 'confuse', 'comic', 'book', 'bright', 'bang-pow', 'drink-your-milk', 'say-your-prayers', 'type', 'heroes', 'Sunday', 'papers', 'comic', 'strips', 'Comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'villains', 'who', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'come', 'much', 'depth', 'baggage', 'ripe', 'exploring.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'yin', 'yang', 'relationship', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'Good', 'versus', 'Evil', 'Order', 'versus', 'Anarchy', 'existence', 'even', 'theoretical', 'existence', 'one', 'other', 'can', 'not', 'exist', 'Joker', 'scarred', 'mouth', 'whacked-out', 'make-up', 'points', 'out', 'glee', 'Batman', 'Batman', 'vigilante', 'hero', 'created', 'villain', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'fear', 'Batman', 'hope', 'Joker', 'guns', 'bombs', 'thrown', 'Gotham', 'City', 'tailspin', 'police', 'mobsters', 'everyday', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'capture', 'Batman', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'scene-stealing', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'fight', 'control', 'chaos', 'rules', 'laws', ""'ve"", 'privately', 'publicly', 'promised', 'uphold.To', 'say', 'anymore', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'surprising', 'excellent', 'plot', 'twists', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'more-than-excellent', 'Joker', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'evil', 'deeds', 'audience', 'riveted', 'chairs', 'eyes', 'screen', 'time', 'Joker', 'audience', 'whoops', 'disbelief', 'mayhem', 'Oh', 's**t', 'Did', 'Joker', 'just', 'do', 'audience', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'dilemma', 'stepping', 'boundaries', 'laws', 'bring', 'down', 'Joker.The', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'fine', 'job', 'roles', 'Bale', 'excellent', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'hamming', 'up', 'millionaire', 'playboy', 'order', 'keep', 'true', 'identity', 'secret', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'sexy', 'fiery', 'A.D.A', 'love', 'interest', 'Dent', 'Wayne', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'strong', 'jaw', 'cartoon', 'superhero', 'chin', 'depth', 'character', 'arc', 'course', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'who', 'unrecognizable', 'so', 'steeped', 'character', 'fully', 'insanity', 'Joker', 'making', 'scarier', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'over-the-top', 'cartoonish', 'performance', 'nearly', '20-years-ago', 'never', 'look', 'Joker', 'say', 'Heath', 'good', 'Joker', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'made', 'very', 'fine', 'character', 'movies', 'Memento', 'Prestige', 'great', 'characters', 'new', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'Unfortunately', 'hard', 'follow', 'action', 'sequences', 'get', 'idea', 'theory', 'what', 'happening', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'main', 'flaw', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Well', 'fact', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anymore', 'face-offs', 'Joker', 'Batman', 'hinted', 'climax', 'movie']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659919,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JPY0,RMurray847,"[7, 18]","Five minutes in to THE DARK NIGHT, I'm asking myself, ""What's happened to Gotham?!?!""  In BATMAN BEGINS, the city was almost a character itself.  Dark, glossy, seedy.  It had islands and elevated subways.  It felt like SIN CITY on a huge budget.  Now it looks like downtown Chicago, or LA or Toronto.  An ""ordinary"" city.  I knew then that director Christopher Nolan and his gang were going to try to make Batman realistic...to make him a part of OUR world.Big mistake.I'll acknowledge right here and now that I'm not a huge ""comic book"" fan.  I pretty much see all the movies...but I never drool in anticipation of them either.  With the recent exceptions of the surprisingly entertaining IRON MAN and the fabulously inventive HELLBOY II...there hasn't been much that's gotten me excited in this genre.  XMEN and SPIDERMAN (and the sequels) were mostly fluffy entertainment.  Not that there's anything wrong with that...it's fine.But prior to seeing DARK KNIGHT, I've been hearing from critics and co-workers alike that this was a movie unlike any other.  One friend said, ""I think it may be the best movie I've EVER seen!!!,"" and his eyes were aglow with fervor.  So I guess it was my mistake waiting until Monday after opening to see the film. I tried to resist the hype and the expectation of a life-changing event...but clearly I bought into it some, because the movie was a pretty significant letdown.Not only were the settings mundane (heck, Batman even goes on a little sidetrip to Hong Kong!)...but I found several key plot developments to be difficult to buy into because the characters hadn't earned my belief.  I don't want to spoil much of the plot, but suffice it to say that I never really saw that Harvey Dent passionately loved Rachel...and thus subsequent events in his life simply didn't ring true psychologically.Let me backtrack.  The plot...or at least the skeleton.  Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, has turned Gotham into a much safer city.  Criminals are on the run.  Regular citizens (some dressed as Batman) are fighting back and trying to reclaim their city.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the new DA, and he appears to be honest about his desire to root out crime.  Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman) is still virtuously carrying on HIS fight against crime.  In fact, Bruce Wayne is actually thinking of hanging up the old batsuit and throwing his support behind the new DA, so that crime can be fought out in the open.Enter The Joker...a maniacal evil-genius with a grotesque face and an even more horrible penchant for murder and mayhem.  Always once step ahead (or two or three) of anyone trying to stop him, and apparently without any motive other than to bring about chaos...he begins to unravel all the plans of these noble men.A complicated series of plot developments ensues...some quite exciting to watch.  Midway through the film, we're treated to a lengthy car & truck chase, followed by Joker's brief but memorable incarceration.  Those few scenes, when  he's interrogated by various ""forces of good"" while clearly all the while hatching a scheme to cause even more death and destruction, are thrilling, tight and have several terrific payoffs all at once.  It is worth the entire 2.5 hours to enjoy those 20 minutes or so.Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker.  It is certainly an inventive and even compelling performance.  But he's an outrageous character in a world that Nolan is trying so hard to make feel like our own.  Ledger is playing on a different wavelength from his fellow actors.  What makes me admire his performance is that Ledger, at least, understood how this story SHOULD have been placed tonally.  Joker is ""askew"" and the film should have been too.  The Joker never changes throughout the film...he's always evil and maniacal...thus, the performance doesn't quite deserve the accolades heaped on it.  I know Ledger's untimely death was tragic...but I think it has clouded the eyes of some to the performance.  (Before you send hate mail...the performance IS very good.  He's a treat to watch, and when he dons a nurse's uniform, he truly takes this role into another level.  His glee is palpable, as is his menace.)Sadly, almost all other performances are off the mark.  Christian Bale is boring as Bruce Wayne (and makes Wayne quite unlikeable) and the voice he's chosen to use for Batman is SO distracting.  Maggie Gylenhaal (who CAN be quite luminescent and wonderful), is terrible and annoying.  Gary Oldman (another fine actor) has a silly accent and not much else to offer.  And poor Aaron Eckhart.  Here's a guy who can be PERFECT in the right role (think THANK YOU FOR SMOKING).  If you need a smooth, glossy, faux sincere politician...this is your guy.  If you need a lovestruck, insecure man...he can't pull it off.  And if you need histrionics or thunderous theatrics...he's completely out of his league.  Michael Caine is enjoyable in a much reduced role as Arthur, Wayne's butler and moral compass.  Morgan Freeman is featured a little more...but mostly looks dewy-eyed at Wayne.  (You know who DOES get where the tone of this movie should be?  Eric Roberts, in his smallish role as a local mob leader.  He overacts just a smidge...and it's just right!)I believe Nolan is trying to make the film a rumination on how fine the line between righteous action and fanatical action are.  How good intentions can turn sour so easily.  It might be a stab at ""anti-terrorism"" fervor...the very tired question of ""are our actions to root out terrorism just making us into our own brand of terrorists.""  But the efforts to illuminate this philosophical musing sometimes lead to some dead-ends dramatically.I'm still giving the film 3 stars...because it dares to try a lot.  It isn't afraid to make a very complex story, both psychologically and in terms of plot.  It doesn't talk down to the audience.  But in attempting so much...it misses more than it hits.  Yet it has the great Joker sequences in the middle, incredible special effects for the character of Two-Face, and it does feature Nestor Carbonell as the Mayor of Gotham.  Why is that good.  Because once upon a time, Carbonell was featured in the live-action TV series THE TICK.  His character?  Batmanuel.

659922,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JPY0,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 4]","The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008)Okay, the simple fact of the matter is that everything about The Dark Knight simply screams ""Oscars"". Even if it weren't, as of this writing, sitting at #1 on the IMDB top 250, even if it didn't have a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes (the other 6% are all from New York City, oddly), even if it weren't simply the best damn thing since sliced bread. While The Dark Knight may not be the best comic book adaptation ever brought to screen-- that honor still goes, and will likely always go, to Akira-- it's certainly the closest I've ever seen to pushing the king off the hill.Nolan's relentlessly dark thriller has all the main cast returning from Batman Begins with the exception of Katie Holmes, who's replaced by a slightly-less-dead-looking Maggie Gyllenhaal. So right off the bat you have Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman reprising their roles. Put those four in a movie and I'm going to see it, no matter what it is. (Cillian Murphy also returns, but in a different role.) Then you add on Gyllenhaal, Aaron Eckhart, Eric Roberts, Anthony Michael Hall (yes, Batman Howser, MD!), William Fichtner, Michael Jai White, and a host of others; do you really need anything more than the cast sitting around shooting the bull about last night's Lakers game to make this riveting? In case you do, cinematographer Marcus Pfister, whose work was nominated for a well-deserved Oscar for Batman Begins, also returns, and this time, the Nolan Brothers wrote the screenplay themselves. You know, the guys who wrote Memento. Yeah, that got an Oscar nomination, too (and was robbed-- come on, are you really going to tell me you can defend Gosford Park?).And then there's Heath Ledger. If ever there were a gimme for Best Supporting Actor...I admit that going into the movie I assumed, having watched more than enough Heath Ledger movies in my time, that much of the flap surrounding Ledger's performance was based on the fact that the man had recently died. (Thus the gimme angle above.) I mean, the guy's done some good work, but really, all those raves? Is he really that good an actor and no one ever noticed? Well, the answer is ""yeah, he really is that good"". I've never seen anything in Ledger's earlier movies that even hints he could have pulled off something like this. As a piece of acting, it's truly a revelation, and makes it all the more depressing that his life ended so early. Like River Phoenix, Ledger suddenly got good, then shuffled off.Given that, what's most surprising is that Ledger's performance overshadows exactly no one here (in the way, say, that Nicholson overshadowed Keaton in Tim Burton's twenty-year-old version); Nolan gave his main ensemble enough space in this two-and-a-half-hour movie that they could all shine. (Or flop, though only one of them does.) I do wish some of the parts had been larger (the great, and highly underrated, William Fichtner got totally robbed), but you get what you get, and I can't really complain. Well, okay, I can. Bale seems awfully emo here after Robert Downey Jr.'s peppy Iron Man, and it's not just his acting; other characters in the film comment on it. Okay, fine, brood, brood, brood. And it's not that Bale's not good at brooding, viz. the wonderful El Maquinista, it just seems a bit... overdone, you know? (Never forget that Nolan is the guy who directed the awful, overwrought remake of Insomnia.) However, Nolan plays off Batman's relentless brooding with a bunch of characters who basically spend the entire film saying ""cheer up, emo kid"", including Freeman, Caine, and Gyllenhaal (and Eckhart, once the two of them get to know one another). It injects a much-needed note of comedy into the film at times.Here I am two-thirds of the way through a thousand-word review I had no idea was going to be a thousand words, and I haven't said word one about the technical details. If this movie doesn't sweep the tech Oscars, something is very, very wrong. Pfister's cinematography is just as good as it was last time, if not better. The set design is about as impressive as any I've seen recently (the closest comparison I can make is to Dark City, or perhaps The City of Lost Children for the more fantastical aspects). Nolan's direction is a bit heavy-handed, but who cares? This is not a movie that will in any way tickle your subtle bone; it's a face-to-the-floor action thriller, awash in violence that I can in no way call ""cartoon"" with a straight face. Jack Nicholson's joker was appropriate for the time, twenty years ago, when Tim Burton made the first modern Batman adaptation; he was cartoonish, obnoxious, somewhat shallow, and absolutely the bad guy to Michael Keaton's troubled, but still golden, boy. Heath ledger's joker is something entirely different, and far more mentally disturbed. Some critics have argued that the film's unrepentant, and unrelenting, nihilism is going to teach the youth of America bad stuff. I ask whether that's a bad thing, and point out that all this movie does is reflect the climate in which it was made. Christopher Nolan has not created a fluffy piece of escapism here. He's created a thoughtful, if angry, film about a guy who was never a golden boy in the first place, except maybe on television. The Dark Knight is a phenomenal film, easily one of the best I've seen this year (including a large number of classic movies). Is it the best movie ever, as IMDB's voters would lead us to believe? I don't think so. But then, Billy Wilder's (arguably) best flick, Ace in the Hole, was raked over the coals by contemporary critics.

659923,A361LE16VBQDP8,B00005JPY0,Robert Bezimienny,"[11, 31]","Do you want to read a comic book for two and a half hours?  Perhaps that's a relevant question to ask prior to signing on board this film.  Leaving the cinema, I felt strangely empty.  Rather than providing ideas to further consider, or an imaginary world to inhabit, the film throws at you chaos and abstractions, which for a time linger like isolated frames from a comic book and then fade to leave you (or at least it left me) with nothing or very little.The Joker is the most striking presence in the film.  He is, in the best comic book tradition, an abstraction.  As the embodiment of inhuman chaos, he approaches the god-like.  He is not believable as a human character, however twisted, nor is he meant to be - rather he is a single human trait or inclination amplified and made animate, namely a chaotic drive towards cruelty and destruction, a trait that transcends the human and speaks of the forces of fate.  Heath Ledger conjurs a fearful representation of this god - in make-up and costume he appears iconic; unaltered and unalterable by events, like the intricate and colourful outlines of the goddess Kali in Hindu myth, he materializes and rematerializes serially.  The very fact that he is not portraying a human limits the boundaries of his performance - he is forced to play one note, louder or softer, bending the tone this way and that, but still bound to the one note; Ledger stays true to this, refusing to humanize or complicate his role, and this makes for a chilling display.  The Joker is not a character so much as an abstract force.In contrast to The Joker, Batman does have his human side.  Once in costume he battles The Joker on almost equal terms, becoming an inhuman force himself, embodying something like a drive for justice, which balances on the edge of becoming a thirst for vengeance.  Out of costume, Bruce Wayne is human, but only just - his wealth, his isolation, and his omnipotence rendering him a fantasy.  Like a little boy all-powerful in his little childhood world, Bruce Wayne has a position in the alleged real world that insulates him from any interaction that could affect him.  For practical purposes, he can be a solipsist.  The one flaw in this bubble is his attraction to Rachel Dawes.  The film deals uneasily with this love interest, for it is the only element in the fim which operates at an ordinary human level.  At a thematic level, it is in danger of being overwhelmed and overshadowed by the grand forces of malevolence and justice that sweep through the film; at a visual level, how can a meaningful exchange of looks compete with swirling special effects.  Ultimately, given the small window offered onto Bruce Wayne's humanity, it is hard for the audience to empathize - it is easier to sit back at a distance and watch him become Batman and go forth to do battle in the arena of the gods.The battle is what you watch, cast in a dark arena, for most of the time.  The visual effects are suitably spectacular.  I'm not sure that they come as too much of a surprise - the look of the film, for all its competence, is familiar, its ancestry running through Blade Runner, Dark City, Alien, and the preceding Batman Begins.  There is no innovation on the level of Sin City, a film which otherwise shares some common bonds.  The tension is maintained, with little relief, for the entirety - it is a gripping ride.Watching a contest for two and a half hours can be enthralling.  The Dark Knight delivers on these terms.  But having been enthralled, by this film, or by a boxing match, or a game of football, or a hackneyed crime thriller, or a tale of battle between Greek gods, I often feel drained and disappointed with how I've spent my time.

He has a number of secret allies, but one of them submits to bitterness and becomes truly evil.  On the other side is the Joker, who is amazingly portrayed by Heath Ledger - a force for chaos, extremely clever, and realistically dangerous as he creates dilemmas for normal people to prove they are capable of evil.  As I watched it, I actually suspended my disbelief and completely enjoyed the world that the film creates.  This is very very rare for me these days, mostly I watch things for the sake of my kids.

It is the black glass building that occupies the top half of the frame.  It is also the building in which I work.  A substantial portion of this movie was filmed within a couple of blocks of where I work with the old Post Office doubling for a variety of locations, depending on the angle of the cameras.  People I know served as extras in the film, including the wife of a coworker, who can be easily spotted in a bar scene.  I watched a few scenes get set up and possibly filmed (it is always hard to tell when they are actually filming and when they are just milling about).  Unfortunately, none of the scenes that I'm confident were actually shot ended up in the final cut of the movie.On a less personal note, this film is notable for its absolutely astonishing action sequences and for the astonishing performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker.  The rest of the film doesn't come up to the level of those two items, something that I'm not sure most people who see the film take note of.  The script, for instance, is a bit of a mess, comprising one of the most nihilistic stories seen in recent years.  The film is also plagued by a spectacularly weak ending.  Precisely why the clay-footed Harvey Dent had to be preserved as a symbol for Gotham escaped me.  Insisting that Harvey represented something above the ordinary seemed about as accurate to me as that sports heroes are role models.  I mean, thank God I never employed O. J. Simpson as a role model.  The sudden shift at the end, when Batman wanted to protect the image of the villainous Harvey Dent by (in Christ-like fashion) becoming the scapegoat for Dent's crimes struck me as incongruous and flat out bad writing.  The movie had already been marred by persistently weak writing, but had it not, it would have been marred by the ending.Nonetheless, the action sequences in this film and the special effects are so spectacular, as is Heath Ledger's final performance that most filmgoers didn't seem to notice that this wasn't an especially good film.  There were some extraordinary moments, but there were also some especially weak ones.  Still, the good definitely outweighs the bad.  My complaint is that too many people are ignoring the bat and insisting that the movie is Oscar material, which it most assuredly is not.  It is not, in fact, anywhere near the best superhero movie of the summer, let alone of all time.  Both IRON MAN and HELL BOY 2 surpass it in the genre, and even the flawed THE HULK comes close to matching it.Still, despite its flaws, this is an extremely easy movie to enjoy and an easy one to forgive for its sins.  As a Chicagoan I especially enjoyed it.  As I mentioned above, a healthy percentage of this film was made only a few blocks from where I work in the south Loop.  It is interesting that they used Chicago very differently in this film than in BATMAN BEGINS.  In that film the technique was to take shots of Chicago and then substantially alter it with CGI.  In that way a host of buildings in the Loop were augmented and enhanced and the EL became a striking two-tiered affair.  In THE DARK KNIGHT, however, there was very little alteration of the city by CGI.  Instead of Gotham being CGI-Chicago, it was pretty much just Chicago.  I'm not sure why they decided to take this very different approach.  Perhaps economics?  CGI has gotten less expensive but it is still not cheap.  But this doesn't come across like a movie on which many corners were cut.  Whatever the reason, the approach in THE DARK KNIGHT was very, very different.  It was a lot of fun seeing places like Lower Wacker employed in the film.  And despite the fact that a huge hunk of the film was shot within a block or two of the Sears Tower, you'd have no idea that it even existed, so careful were they to exclude it.The film is renowned for Heath Ledger's final performance and even had he lived a great deal longer it would have been the performance of a lifetime.  Just as his Joker lets everything go to become an anarchic presence so here he throws everything away in becoming a homicidal maniac.  The literary/mythic predecessor for his Joker is easy to locate, Loki of Norse mythology.  Ledger's Joker is pretty much the Norse God of chaos incarnate in Gotham.  He even displays Loki's sense of mischief and humor.  It is on every level an amazing performance and it is almost impossible to imagine that Ledger will not be rewarded with a posthumous Oscar.  He dominates the movie, as Christian Bale does not.  And that leads to one of the other problems in the film.  Although Bale was decent enough in the previous movie, he was largely lost in this one.  In fact, whether caped or in a tux Bale was simply not very memorable.  If you watch IRON MAN and THE DARK KNIGHT back to back, see which lead character you remember more.  His story was simply not made very interesting and was hurt by the implausible ending.  In fact, apart from Ledger, no one really gives an especially memorable performance.  Gary Oldman is impressive for not being anything like his typical roles.  It definitely increases my respect for him as an actor to see him playing a nonpsychopath.All in all this is a fun film to see.  I do think that with time people will come to realize that this simply is not a great movie.  It is a superior summer blockbuster type film, depending heavily on striking special effects and startling stunts, and buoyed by an amazing supporting performance.  And trust me, if there was ever a movie that I hoped would be a masterpiece, it is this one.  I walked by so many of the sets and saw so many of the accoutrements of the film that it really did feel like my neighborhood film.  It contains many impressive moments, but unfortunately the central story is not as good as the stunts, sets, and special effects.  And ultimately that is what makes a great movie.",4,A better than average summer blockbuster,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,6161,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'pride', 'morbidity', 'have', 'point', 'out',

I'm speaking of Heath Ledger's personification of the ""The Joker"".  He made an impossible to believe character come alive in an eerie, frightening and, hauntingly manner.  Heath Ledger gave us a once in a lifetime performance.  Unfortunately, it was the last role of his much too short life.  If Ledger's Joker performance was of the nature we could have expected, then his untimely death was a triple tragedy.He will be missed.As for the movie, it is a fast paced, enjoyable ride brought to life, BELIEVABLY, by great characters, superb acting and, a really good script.  And, this is the kind of movie that if missed in theaters (or seen in one), demands to be viewed from a Blu-Ray  High Definition disc.

659933,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00005JPY0,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[1, 3]","Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale team up again in this riveting action-drama to 2005's 'Batman Begins.Batman/Bruce Wayne is most ideally suited to help track down Gotham's now-unleashed arsenal of criminals. This is simply because he, like them, is also teetering on the edge. This superhero is NOT some clean-cut 'Al American' type.It goes without saying that the real screen steals go to Heath Ledger. He plays the Joker--whose characterization more than one-ups the previous 'update' which Jack Nicholson previously provided. THIS incarnation does not have one shred of humanity inside of him, killing IS glee. Becoming Batman's most infamous enemy, the 'clown prince' of crime's random crime waves concern the Dark Knight on numerous levels.Unlike the now-vanished Scarecrow, the Joker apparently lacks a specific motive for committing his incidents.  And watching those powerful line deliveries, you can easily forget that a real and reportedly caring human being had died when Ledger's own life was accidentally self-ended. He definently will deserve all of the award nominations for the seat gripping performance provided throughout the screenplay!Maggie Gyllenhaal has assumed the role of Bruce's love/Assistant DA friend Rachael Dawes. She does a generally convincing job in the part. I had just liked seeing Katie Holmes stretch out her acting chops so convincingly during that earlier movie.But I was soothed because Gary Oldman and Morgan Freedman DO reprise their previous roles as Batman's buddies. Gordon and Fox's moving up in their respective bureaucracies now give them the critical leverage to help conquer crime and corruption in Gotham. And Batman himself gets some new toys to come up against his new enemies.Nolan's screen play magic briefly fades through a recasting/retelling of Harvey Dent/Two Face. This character itself having been horribly butchered during the Schumacher years yes, does receive some critical repair here. Like several other instances in this screenplay, the character is also a powerful illustration of the duality between good abd evil within the same person. Two-Face is starting out as Assistant District Attorney Harvey Dent, and a friend of Bruce Wayne, assuming his criminal persona after an unfortunate (and later) accident.  But I just honestly did not feel the compelling need for the attempted telling of a romantic triangle which I just as easily could have seen on a television soap.Overall, this is a good movie and recommended for people who can't find anything they currently like on TV.",4,"""Dark Knight"" rescues a boring summer!",1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,2553,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'team', 'up', 'again', 'riveting', 'action-drama', '2005', ""'Batman"", 'Begins.Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'most', 'ideally', 'suited', 'help', 'track', 'down', 'Gotham', 'now-unleashed', 'arsenal', 'criminals', 'simply', 'also', 'teetering', 'edge', 'superhero', 'NOT', 'clean-cut', ""'Al"", 'American', 'type.It', 'saying', 'real', 'screen', 'steals', 'go', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'characterization', 'more', 'one-ups', 'previous', ""'update"", 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'previously', 'provided', 'THIS', 'incarnation', 'not', 'have', 'one', 'shred', 'humanity', 'killing', 'IS', 'glee', 'Becoming', 'Batman', 'most', 'infamous', 'enemy', ""'clown"", 'prince', 'crime', 'random', 'crime', 'waves', 'concern', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'numerous', 'now-vanished', 'Scarecrow', 'Joker', 'apparently', 'specific', 'motive', 'committing', 'incidents', 'watching', 'powerful', 'line', 'deliveries', 'can', 'easily', 'forget', 'real', 'reportedly', 'caring', 'human', 'being', 'had', 'died', 'when', 'Ledger', 'own', 'life', 'was', 'accidentally', 'self-ended', 'definently', 'will', 'deserve', 'award', 'nominations', 'seat', 'gripping', 'performance', 'provided', 'screenplay', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'assumed', 'role', 'Bruce', 'love/Assistant', 'DA', 'friend', 'Rachael', 'Dawes', 'generally', 'convincing', 'job', 'part', 'had', 'just', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'stretch', 'out', 'acting', 'chops', 'so', 'convincingly', 'earlier', 'movie.But', 'was', 'soothed', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Morgan', 'Freedman', 'DO', 'reprise', 'previous', 'roles', 'Batman', 'buddies', 'Gordon', 'Fox', 'moving', 'up', 'respective', 'bureaucracies', 'now', 'give', 'critical', 'leverage', 'help', 'conquer', 'crime', 'corruption', 'Gotham', 'Batman', 'new', 'toys', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'enemies.Nolan', 'screen', 'play', 'magic', 'briefly', 'fades', 'recasting/retelling', 'Harvey', 'Dent/Two', 'Face', 'character', 'having', 'been', 'horribly', 'butchered', 'Schumacher', 'years', 'yes', 'receive', 'critical', 'repair', 'here', 'several', 'other', 'instances', 'screenplay', 'character', 'also', 'powerful', 'illustration', 'duality', 'good', 'abd', 'evil', 'same', 'person', 'Two-Face', 'starting', 'out', 'Assistant', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'friend', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'assuming', 'criminal', 'persona', 'unfortunate', 'later', 'accident', 'just', 'honestly', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'compelling', 'need', 'attempted', 'telling', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'just', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'television', 'soap.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'recommended', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'currently', 'like', 'TV']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Widely praised by international reviews and nearing $1 billion in global revenue, this Blu-ray DVD continues this excellence in every department -- image. sound and extras.  But alas, no Christopher Nolan or Christian Bale commentaries.The image quality and sound are as good as technically possible.  Hard to imagine a better looking  movie.  Especially the opening Imax-filmed bank heist.  There is not a more immersive image-capturing system available and on a high-end TV, the transfer is eye-popping.Although Warner Bros. rarely makes DVD sales public, I'm willing to bet this is the first million selling Blu-ray disc.The theme of this movie resonates deeply.  First, there's iconic terrorist imagery, especially regarding Sept. 11 (silhouette girders in smoke). The ideas of ""chaos for the sake of chaos"" and ""how do you fight an evil that has no rules"" is intelligently as well as viscerally exploited.  ""Some people just want to see the world burn.""  Exactly.  Ring a bell?Also, there is always the problem of killing in the name of a moral cause.  How much innocent death is justified? Issues of war in Iraq come to mind.This brilliant film is packaged cleverly with an outer sleeve mockingly vandalized by the Joker.The extras are succinctly edited and are generous.  They cover key movie elements.  I was especially taken by an inside look at Hans Zimmer's music as well as the blending of miniature with full size practical effects.  On Disc 2, there's a terrific examination of Batman from a psychoanalytic perspective.When all is said and done, the haunting portrayal of The Joker by heath Ledger remains in the memory.  No doubt he will be posthumously nominated for an Academy Award. He'll probably win.  He deserves it.  Shedding this role is probably what led to his demise.Strongest recommendation.

659936,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPY0,Roland E. Zwick,"[16, 24]","****1/2Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" reminds us that even a product of mass-market pop culture can, if done correctly, be a work of art.  This thrilling, densely plotted and beautifully crafted sequel to 2005's ""Batman Begins"" is, quite possibly, the finest comic book superhero movie ever made.  In addition, it boasts, in the performance of Heath Ledger, one of the definitive screen villains of all time.As the movie begins, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart)  - with the unofficial aid of the ""vigilante crime fighter"" known as Batman (Christian Bale) - is getting ready to indict most of Gotham City's most notorious criminals and gangsters on racketeering and money-laundering charges.  The fly in the ointment is the psychotic, face-painted super villain, self identified as The Joker, who's joined forces with the seedy criminal elements of the city to bring both Batman and the terrorized inhabitants to their knees.  Meanwhile, billionaire Bruce Wayne is trying to find a way to render his Batman alter ego unnecessary by finding an incorruptible civic leader who will be able to rid the city of its criminal elements through wholly legal means and, thus, become the heroic figure for the city that Batman himself can never be.  He alights on Dent as the man for that job.As writers, the Nolan brothers, Jonathan and Christopher, have created a work that is so dark and despairing in its probing of the evil that infests our world that it makes the 1989 Tim Burton version look like an episode from the campy TV series in comparison.  The forces of good in this movie are entirely at the mercy of the forces of evil, so terrifyingly embodied in the Joker figure.  With his face painted into a ghoulish grin, Ledger's Joker strikes terror not merely into the characters in the movie but the audience as well.  Not since Anthony Hopkins did his turn as Hannibal Lecter (a character Ledger himself cited as a primary source of inspiration for this role) has one actor imparted such a quality of dread and menace to the character he was playing.  It is, indeed, a tribute to Ledger's greatness as an actor that, even after all the myriad screen villains we have encountered over the years, he has the power to makes us cringe every time he appears on screen.  Indeed, so convincing is Ledger in the part that we sometimes wonder if even Batman himself will have what it takes to defeat him (and isn`t that the measure of a truly effective bad guy?).  For this Joker's true strategic advantage lies not in all the weapons of destruction he has at his disposal, but, rather, in his astute understanding of human psychology, particularly in his knowledge of how to make terror and fear work to get him what he wants.  His delight in mind games, his devotion to torture, and his love of violence for its own sweet sake make him a figure fit to haunt one's dreams.There are other fine performances as well in the movie, including Eckhart as the honest D.A.,  Maggie Gyllenhaal as Bruce's former (and the D.A.'s current) flame, Gary Oldman as the ever reliable Lieutenant Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Wayne Industries` most erstwhile employee, and Michael Caine as Wayne's devoted and down-to-earth butler.  It's inevitable, perhaps, that Bale, as the good guy of the piece, would fall under the shadow of Ledger's towering achievement, but he provides the strength and solidity the picture needs to keep it from going out of whack.Using what would appear to be a minimum of CGI effects, Nolan has mounted his film with a fine eye for detail and a great deal of  jaw-dropping visual artistry.  The cityscapes alone are enough to take the audience's breath away.  Moreover, the screenplay weaves seamlessly between full-throttle, pull-out-all-the-stops action sequences and intense, highly intimate exchanges between characters.Like all movies that run a little longer than they should, ""The Dark Knight"" does hit a point of diminishing turns long about its last half hour, as the story loses its way a bit and the thematic point-making threatens to run it into the ground.  Heck, even Ledger's performance loses some of its edge towards the end, as the novelty begins to wear off due to overexposure (he is probably in one or two scenes too many in the final analysis).Still, these are minor quibbles about a movie and a performance that will go down as classics in their respective categories.",4,A Towering Achievement,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,4410,"['Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'even', 'product', 'mass-market', 'pop', 'culture', 'can', 'done', 'correctly', 'be', 'work', 'art', 'thrilling', 'densely', 'plotted', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'sequel', '2005', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'quite', 'possibly', 'finest', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'addition', 'performance', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'one', 'definitive', 'screen', 'villains', 'time.As', 'movie', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'unofficial', 'aid', 'vigilante', 'crime', 'fighter', 'known', 'Batman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'getting', 'ready', 'indict', 'most', 'Gotham', 'City', 'most', 'notorious', 'criminals', 'gangsters', 'racketeering', 'money-laundering', 'charges', 'fly', 'ointment', 'psychotic', 'face-painted', 'super', 'villain', 'identified', 'Joker', 'who', 'joined', 'forces', 'seedy', 'criminal', 'elements', 'city', 'bring', 'Batman', 'terrorized', 'inhabitants', 'knees', 'Meanwhile', 'billionaire', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'render', 'Batman', 'alter', 'ego', 'unnecessary', 'finding', 'incorruptible', 'civic', 'leader', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'rid', 'city', 'criminal', 'elements', 'wholly', 'legal', 'means', 'thus', 'become', 'heroic', 'figure', 'city', 'Batman', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'Dent', 'man', 'job.As', 'writers', 'Nolan', 'brothers', 'Jonathan', 'Christopher', 'have', 'created', 'work', 'so', 'dark', 'despairing', 'probing', 'evil', 'world', '1989', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'version', 'look', 'episode', 'campy', 'TV', 'series', 'comparison', 'forces', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'entirely', 'mercy', 'forces', 'evil', 'so', 'terrifyingly', 'embodied', 'Joker', 'figure', 'face', 'painted', 'ghoulish', 'grin', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'strikes', 'terror', 'not', 'merely', 'characters', 'movie', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'did', 'turn', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'character', 'Ledger', 'cited', 'primary', 'source', 'inspiration', 'role', 'one', 'actor', 'imparted', 'quality', 'dread', 'menace', 'character', 'was', 'playing', 'indeed', 'tribute', 'Ledger', 'greatness', 'actor', 'even', 'myriad', 'screen', 'have', 'encountered', 'years', 'power', 'cringe', 'time', 'screen', 'Indeed', 'convincing', 'Ledger', 'part', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'even', 'Batman', 'will', 'have', 'what', 'defeat', 'isn', 't', 'measure', 'truly', 'effective', 'bad', 'guy', 'Joker', 'true', 'strategic', 'advantage', 'not', 'weapons', 'destruction', 'disposal', 'rather', 'astute', 'understanding', 'human', 'psychology', 'particularly', 'knowledge', 'how', 'make', 'terror', 'fear', 'work', 'get', 'what', 'delight', 'mind', 'games', 'devotion', 'torture', 'love', 'violence', 'own', 'sweet', 'sake', 'make', 'figure', 'fit', 'haunt', 'one', 'are', 'other', 'fine', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'including', 'Eckhart', 'honest', 'D.A.', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Bruce', 'former', 'D.A', 'current', 'flame', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'ever', 'reliable', 'Lieutenant', 'Gordon', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Wayne', 'Industries', 'most', 'erstwhile', 'employee', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Wayne', 'devoted', 'down-to-earth', 'butler', 'inevitable', 'perhaps', 'Bale', 'good', 'guy', 'piece', 'would', 'fall', 'shadow', 'Ledger', 'towering', 'achievement', 'strength', 'solidity', 'picture', 'keep', 'going', 'whack.Using', 'what', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'minimum', 'CGI', 'effects', 'Nolan', 'mounted', 'film', 'fine', 'eye', 'detail', 'great', 'deal', 'jaw-dropping', 'visual', 'artistry', 'cityscapes', 'alone', 'are', 'enough', 'take', 'audience', 'breath', 'away', 'Moreover', 'screenplay', 'seamlessly', 'full-throttle', 'pull-out-all-the-stops', 'action', 'sequences', 'intense', 'highly', 'intimate', 'exchanges', 'characters.Like', 'movies', 'run', 'little', 'longer', 'should', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'hit', 'point', 'diminishing', 'turns', 'long', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'story', 'way', 'bit', 'thematic', 'point-making', 'threatens', 'run', 'ground', 'Heck', 'even', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'edge', 'end', 'novelty', 'wear', 'off', 'due', 'overexposure', 'probably', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'too', 'many', 'final', 'analysis', '.Still', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'movie', 'performance', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'classics', 'respective', 'categories']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Everyone does a spectacular job except the film editors.  The fight scenes are impossible to see because the jump cuts are so close that nothing can be seen.  There is more property destruction than normally seen in these movies but enough to satisfy even the most jaded teenager.  The acting is very well done by all participants but Heath Ledger's Joker is an academy award performance if I have ever seen one.  It was rumored that this part left him depressed which was why he overdosed on pain and anti-depressants.  After seeing this movie I can easily believe that portraying this socio-path would have left even the most stable person depressed.  The Joker is the most realistic villain I have seen in any movie.  This is not only an evil person Leger brings him to life in such a way that he is totally believeable.  There is no comic book villain in this performance but a truly evil psychopath.  I felt the addition of ""Two Face"" was unnecessary and actually detracted from Leger's performance but that doesn't detract from the quality of the acting.

The depiction of the story in a gritty urban millieu gives it much greater gravitas than the standard superhero film. At times, it feels like one is watching a legal procedural drama like Law and Order. The Dark Knight acts chiefly as a showcase for the Joker character, played by the late Heath Ledger.  Ledger's performance is solid, but the other characters are ill-served by a script that places them firmly in supporting roles.  After awhile, the omnipotence (and omnipresence) of the Joker in this long film becomes truly annoying. He seems to be everywhere, planting hundreds of fifty-gallon drums of gasoline and fuses faster than Batman and the police can react.  The film also suffers the ""two-villain syndrome"" of most Batman features; attorney Harvey Dent is an integral part of the plot, but his Two-Face alter-ego is a late afterthought.  Two-Face's skeletal half-face is certain to traumatize impressionable children long afterwards.

If you're like me and not really a fan of such hyper-violence, this might not be the movie for you, in spite of the good reviews it has received.I also didn't find Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker quite as arresting as many others have. He licks his lips and sinuously justifies his misanthropy with a startling version of the now rather conventional excuse of child abuse. This attempt to humanize a cartoon figure is not altogether successful. It might have been better to let cartoon violence remain wholly inhuman, inexplicable, Jack Nicholson-hammy.Then there isn't much continuity or plot here. All kinds of themes and characters are introduced, only to evaporate. Gangster syndicates, Asian cartels, and minor evil-doers of every stripe come on stage to threaten a while - then exit to the wings. These villains fight and are fought fantastically. I know this is all meant as ultra-fiction, but I still prefer some logical process behind the action. I would like to know how The Joker could plant so many explosives and blow up so many structures in such short order.The acting turns provided by movie veterans such as Michael Caine do provide an adult element to this special effects extravaganza. And the film is indeed visually striking, with Chicago making a gleaming obsidian Gotham. But in the end, this is still a cartoon and the characters are more action figures than actors.

I went to the first midnight showing of that movie and the auditorium wasn't close to half full. To be honest that movie didn't have the advantage of a big name villain and it really didn't have the advantage of having one of its stars die six months before it opened.Now we have ""The Dark Knight"" a movie that has broken allrecords including highest opening day, highest opening weekend, and the quickest movie to reach $300 million at the domestic box office. Well this movie did have plenty of hype and plenty of publicity. The question now does the movie live up to the hype? The answer, I would have to say (after three viewings) is YES!There is a lot of thought that went into this screenplay. Batman (played by Christian Bale) has become so good at beating the bad guys that they villains turn to desperate measures. Enter The Joker (played by Heath Ledger). He believes that Gotham City is deserving of a better class of criminal. The Joker isn't as much as a criminal though as he is a psychotic who enjoys chaos and destruction.What can be said about the Joker that hasn't been said yet? Heath Ledger literally does disappear into this role. If I had gone into this movie now knowing any of the cast members I would never have guessed that as Ledger. The Joker is portrayed as a man with no conscious who is willing to let people die and lives be destroyed for the sake of his own amusement. Even if Ledger hadn't of died I would still say this role was worth of an Oscar nomination as his vile character brings a new level of violence and chaos to a crime movie.The Joker's agenda is to physically and psychologically destroy the lives of those who try to bring law and order to Gotham City. This not only includes Batman but district attorney (Harvey Dent), the girl caught in the middle of a love triangle (played by Rachel Dawes), and Police Commissioner Gordon, played by the always brilliant Gary Oldman. The Joker even messes with Gotham Cities other criminals including mob boss in an underrated performance by Eric Roberts.Every scene the Joker is in is an attention grabber as he sets out to prove that underneath all the laws and moral codes people are all bad. I am usually disinterested in movies in which the villain stops the action to explain to the hero (usually for the benefit of the audience) how evil he is. This time I didn't mind as The Joker had some pretty interesting things to say. Not only does he deserve an Oscar nomination, but so do the writers.Even though I have mostly written of the Joker that's not to say the role of Batman is downplayed. He has to make some choices that come very close to crossing morale lines, including eavesdropping on 30 million of Gotham's citizens, much to the dismay of Lucius Fox, played by Morgan Freeman.And let's not forget Michael Caine. He plays Alfred, Bruce Wayne's loyal butler who provides the sanity that contrasts against all the chaos in this movie. He plays the role with great patience and concern as he worries that each time Bruce Wayne leaves may be his last.""The Dark Knight"" is a compelling entertainment that last two and a half hours and is not boring for a moment. There are plenty of moments of drama and suspense in which characters have to make life altering choices. And of course, there is plenty of action and a car chase through the middle of Gotham City in which we see get to see the Batcycle. This seen is a hoot.A lot of people have compared Heath Ledger's Joker to Jack Nicholson's Joker, and a lot of critics have compared this new movie to Tim Burton's ""Batman"".

Throughout the film a seemingly sloppy Joker based on the appearance of his makeup coldly pushes all the right buttons and carefully turns Gotham on itself and its hero in Batman and new DA in Harvey Dent who is cracking down on organized crime. He tells Harvey Dent he is no mastermind in a scene at Gotham General Hospital but we all know that he is in that great scene. There are numerous fabulous scenes where Heath Ledger plays like Iago planting the seeds to turn Harvey Dent from a hero to a villain. Heath is outstanding throughout.Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent is even more charismatic than Christian Bale as Batman and you will want him to be the true hero he seems to want to be. But as it is in life it is not uncommmon for people to have multiple conflicting ideas of where they stand in the world. There confidence in not unwavering. The seeds of doubt can be planted so easily when you are dealt with tragedy as The Joker torments Harvey with.People that play important roles in Gotham society are ruthlessly murdered in targeted assassinations and The Dark Knight world is a world gripped in a terrorized state ruled by the Joker. Much like The Empire Strikes Back this movie is hopefully the darkness before the dawn of the next sequel because it will leave you in awe but hollow to the core because there truly is no final resolution by the end of the film. But trust me you will want more like one yearns for in lust or hunger after a great meal.From a technical standpoint I wholeheartily love the picture quality and from an audio standpoint a scene where a hospital literally explodes was so mesmerizingly earthshattering that I couldn't help grinning maniacally like The Joker.Stop reading.

This is a very serious treatment of a super hero, and rightly so, because Batman is arguably the most complicated comic book character, even more so on philosophical and psychological basis. In Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"", the Joker smiles a lot, but is even more deranged and sadistic than even before. Heath Ledger's brilliant performance is utterly phenomenal but very troubling, which is even more of an indication of Nolan's commitment to regard this film as a character study, and an exploration of ethical and moral issues, and not merely a superhero movie. He succeeds on many fronts, bringing complexities and intricacy not just to the hero and the man behind that hero, but to the villains themselves. This is great achievement, as the film transcends comic book sensibilities and becomes something else: a film noir, a character study, a high brow and intellectual entertainment.

659955,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B00005JPY0,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[7, 11]","I admit that one of the main reasons I watched this action film twice at a premium-priced cinema was to admire the gorgeous, chiseled facial features and toned chest muscles of the lead actor, Christian Bale. (Even my next door neighbor, a woman in her late 60s, admitted a similar motivation in taking her grandchildren to The Dark Knight, calling Bale ""beautiful to look at."") That admiration aside, what a tour de force!  The Dark Knight sets a new standard for action films in general and adaptations of comic books in particular. My ex-boyfriend (with whom I am thankfully still on very good terms) introduced me to the world of DC comics and took me to Batman Begins, filling me in on the synopses of the Batman legend, culled from years spent poring over the comic books created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger and then revisited by Frank Miller.This movie is a wonderful second installment of the new Batman movies.  The ensemble cast was top-notch, and the untimely death of Heath Ledger makes his rendition of the Joker especially memorable.  It was impossible not to mourn for Ledger while watching this very distinct characterization of the Joker.  This wasn't Tim Burton's comical Joker whom only Jack Nicholson could portray.  This was a tragic, dark villain who desperately needed psychiatric services (but not from Dr. Crain/The Scarecrow!).  You get that there's a backstory of abuse that shaped this character's personality, though the Joker told serveral different versions of the origin of his ""smiling"" scars, so we're never sure about what really happened.Warning: SpoilersBatman wanted to hand over his role of Gotham's protector to the district attorney, Harvey Dent, a man who seemed unmarred by the city's corruption.  Though Bruce believes in Harvey Dent's integrity, the two vie for the love of Rachel.  Rachel had promised Bruce that once he puts the caped crusader behind him, she would be interested in a romantic relationship.  Rachel's condition for a relationship becomes a huge motivation for Bruce to appoint a new ""knight"" to carry the torch of Batman. However, those conditions become compromised when Rachel accepts Harvey's marriage proposal.  Unbeknownst to Bruce, Rachel's feelings have shifted, and she writes him an (undelivered) letter to express her changed sentiments.At a pivotal moment, Harvey Dent publicly claims, ""I am the Batman,"" thus continuing to obscure Bruce Wayne's secret identity.  Later, the Joker arranges for both Rachel and Harvey to be taken hostage, with Batman choosing which person to personally protect.  Of course, Batman follows his heart and tries to rescue Rachel, but the subterfuge of the Joker switches locations, and Rachel is lost.  For a man who boasts that he doesn't make plans, the Joker seems to have his chaos agenda well in hand, being at the right place at the right time to bring about the greatest amount of destruction.  Harvey Dent is not the same after Rachel's death, and the Joker's cynicism seems to be realized in Harvey's moral decline. The Joker gloats to Batman that even the best of men can be brought down under the right circumstances.  (To be honest, I think that if you alter someone's brain chemistry--that is, neurotransmitters are out of whack and the limbic system hijacks the frontal lobe, the area of the brain responsible for higher reasoning and judgment, you can bring out the worst in that person and distort what s/he is really like.  But I don't share the Joker's savage misanthropy and cynicism.)  Batman is devastated by Harvey's retaliatory killing spree, and thinks that he must sacrifice his own reputation to keep people's faith in the good in man.Here's where I have a bone to pick with the storyline in terms of logic.  James Gordon knows the truth about the killing spree, and this ""good cop"" doesn't think that those deaths can be covered up.  Umm, yes, it's called attribute those deaths to the Joker himself and his henchmen.  There was so much confusion and chaos at that time, that I think Batman's sacrifice is both unnecessary and nonsensical. I don't think it'd be much of a stretch for the citizens of Gotham to believe that the Joker was behind those deaths. I see the heroism in being willing to take the blame for things you didn't and wouldn't do while being faulted for characteristics that you don't have, but...  If Bruce Wayne himself, and not through the safe distance of his alter ego, was accused of things he didn't and wouldn't do, I don't think he'd be able to bear it (as taking on this blame runs much deeper than the ""irresponsible party boy"" image that he promotes as a ruse to keep his Batman identity hidden). There are few things more painful than a false accusation, i.e., being blamed for things you didn't and wouldn't do. Furthermore, Batman was the larger-than-life protector of Gotham, a fusion of technology and the supernatural.  It would be just as devastating if not more devastating for the citizens of Gotham to realize that their caped hero was the villain--that would really shake up their confidence in the good in man and lend credence to the Joker's cynicism.  They love this ethical ""outlawer"" more than the district attorney.  I think that keeping Harvey's reputation in tact shouldn't be at the expense of Batman.  If Harvey Dent, the ""White Knight"" with his reputation untainted, is dead and gone, and Batman has become a senseless murderer, how is that of comfort to the citizens of Gotham?  How is this new state of affairs going to help Gotham feel safe and protected, while encouraging people to believe in the best in themselves and others?Don't ask me, I didn't write the script. Maybe the next installment will make sense of Batman's sacrifice. But I did appreciate the intelligence, Oscar-caliber acting, and action of this blockbuster. And of course, the physique of Bruce Wayne (my friend and I said in almost perfect synchronicity, ""Oh my God"" the first time Bale took off his shirt!).",5,"A wonderful sequel, but the plot line

659958,A2AFM0SLLFPSJ1,B00005JPY0,"Savant11 ""Savant11""","[19, 90]","I had really been looking forwards to this film, while I enjoyed Batman Begins, I found that there were problems with it, which I had  thought would be remedied with this film. Coupled with the hype sorounding The Dark Knight I thought that I would be in for a treat.Instead I was tremendously disappointed.The Dark Knight  is more like a glorified episode of `The Sheild' or `The Wire', in which a cops and lawyers try to apprehend a psychopath. The movie is more about Gordon, Dent and The Joker than it is about Batman. In fact Batman is hardly in the film at all, and when he is featured there is no depth to his appearance or performance.  In fact if Batman had been taken out of it, or his part replaced with a maverick cop or private eye the film would have not been changed. Batman being in the film had no consequence to the film.  In retrospect the film really should have been called `The Joker' because the film  is more about him than anyone else.Here are some of the problems I had with the film.*In Batman Begins, Bruce said that he traveled the world to understand the criminal mind. Are we supposed to believe that he never came across a psychopath during his travels? I also guess that in the Nolan Batverse we are to believe that Stalin and Hitler and other such monsters never existed. Which is why it explains his complete surprise that someone like the Joker could exist, and his inability to get a handle him.* Batman is supposed to be well versed in the martial arts which above all  else instills discipline and focus. Yet he allows the Joker to needlessly provoke him into loosing his temper, wasting precious time while his  two friends are in mortal danger.* Batman has been on the job at most a year, yet he is able to order the Gotham City Police Department to do his bidding. I almost choked when I saw him lecture a cop about not contaminating the crime scene.*The Jokers' success in the film is contingent on most of the characters behaving stupidly and having no common sense.* In Batman Begins, Bruce was committed to being Batman, now in the TDK he wants to throw in the towel and quit at the first sign of trouble.  I would have thought that Batman would have a stronger spine.* Bruce deciding that he can give up being Batman because he now has Dent to take his place. How can that be the case when he and Dent do two completely different jobs? Batman is a vigilante who helps to apprehend criminals. Dent is a prosecutor who tries criminals, he does nothing to apprehend criminals he has to rely on the cops to do that.* Bruce saying that Dent is his successor despite the fact that Dent already had a bad reputation to begin with. Wasn't Batman supposed to have done research?* Dent's speech at dinner about Batman wanting to give up being Batman someday. How is Dent supposed to have come by this information?* Dent's sudden transformation to Two Face, because of the death of his girlfriend.*If the Joker is hell bent on confusion and destruction and human misery, why is he taking the time to explain to Dent that he had nothing to do with the death of his girlfriend?* The whole scene with the ferry. The notion of a group willing to sacrifice themselves until death for another group of people is unrealistic. Self-preservation is the number one rule of all human beings. Also if people are as self-sacrificing and nice as Nolan wants to suggest in that scene. Then what do they need Batman for?*Two Face whining about the what's fair, yet trying to justify trying to kill Gordon's family.* The notion that Batman is setting himself up as a sacrificial lamb at the end of the film because 'that's what the people' need is a lame attempt to draw an equation between Batman and Jesus Christ. It was extremely tacky and contrived. Nowhere is it written in any of the Batman books that Batman's  intent is to take the punishment for the people.*The Hong Kong scene was stupid and pointless, as was the useless car chase.And of course the self-important, pseudo intellectual verbiage that piled out of every characters mouth, No one spoke in this film. They just gave grandiose speeches. I just found it hard to take seriouslyThis is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life.  Clearly Nolan has no understanding or respect for Batman.",1,Disappointing....A Huge Disservice To Batman,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,4291,"['had', 'really', 'been', 'looking', 'forwards', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'found', 'were', 'problems', 'had', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'remedied', 'film', 'Coupled', 'hype', 'sorounding', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'treat.Instead', 'was', 'tremendously', 'disappointed.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'more', 'glorified', 'episode', 'Sheild', 'Wire', 'cops', 'lawyers', 'try', 'apprehend', 'psychopath', 'movie', 'more', 'Gordon', 'Dent', 'Joker', 'Batman', 'fact', 'Batman', 'hardly', 'film', 'when', 'featured', 'depth', 'appearance', 'performance', 'fact', 'Batman', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'part', 'replaced', 'maverick', 'cop', 'private', 'eye', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'changed', 'Batman', 'being', 'film', 'had', 'consequence', 'film', 'retrospect', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Joker', 'film', 'more', 'anyone', 'are', 'problems', 'had', 'film', '*In', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Bruce', 'said', 'traveled', 'world', 'understand', 'criminal', 'mind', 'Are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'never', 'came', 'psychopath', 'travels', 'also', 'guess', 'Nolan', 'Batverse', 'are', 'believe', 'Stalin', 'Hitler', 'other', 'such', 'monsters', 'never', 'existed', 'Which', 'why', 'complete', 'surprise', 'someone', 'Joker', 'could', 'exist', 'inability', 'get', 'handle', '*', 'Batman', 'supposed', 'be', 'well', 'versed', 'martial', 'arts', 'else', 'discipline', 'focus', 'Joker', 'needlessly', 'provoke', 'loosing', 'temper', 'wasting', 'precious', 'time', 'two', 'friends', 'are', 'mortal', 'danger', '*', 'Batman', 'been', 'job', 'most', 'year', 'able', 'order', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Police', 'Department', 'do', 'bidding', 'almost', 'choked', 'when', 'saw', 'lecture', 'cop', 'not', 'contaminating', 'crime', 'scene', '*The', 'Jokers', 'success', 'film', 'contingent', 'most', 'characters', 'behaving', 'stupidly', 'having', 'common', 'sense', '*', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Bruce', 'was', 'committed', 'being', 'Batman', 'now', 'TDK', 'throw', 'towel', 'quit', 'first', 'sign', 'trouble', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Batman', 'would', 'have', 'stronger', 'spine', 'Bruce', 'deciding', 'can', 'give', 'up', 'being', 'Batman', 'now', 'Dent', 'take', 'place', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'case', 'when', 'Dent', 'do', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'jobs', 'Batman', 'vigilante', 'who', 'apprehend', 'criminals', 'Dent', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'criminals', 'nothing', 'apprehend', 'criminals', 'rely', 'cops', 'do', '*', 'Bruce', 'saying', 'Dent', 'successor', 'fact', 'Dent', 'already', 'had', 'bad', 'reputation', 'begin', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Batman', 'supposed', 'have', 'done', 'research', '*', 'Dent', 'speech', 'dinner', 'Batman', 'wanting', 'give', 'up', 'being', 'Batman', 'someday', 'How', 'Dent', 'supposed', 'have', 'come', 'information', '*', 'Dent', 'sudden', 'transformation', 'Two', 'Face', 'death', 'girlfriend', '*If', 'Joker', 'hell', 'bent', 'confusion', 'destruction', 'human', 'misery', 'why', 'taking', 'time', 'explain', 'Dent', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'death', 'girlfriend', 'whole', 'scene', 'ferry', 'notion', 'group', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'death', 'group', 'people', 'unrealistic', 'Self-preservation', 'number', 'one', 'rule', 'human', 'beings', 'Also', 'people', 'are', 'self-sacrificing', 'nice', 'Nolan', 'suggest', 'scene', 'Then', 'what', 'do', 'need', 'Batman', '*Two', 'Face', 'whining', 'what', 'fair', 'yet', 'trying', 'justify', 'trying', 'kill', 'Gordon', 'family', '*', 'notion', 'Batman', 'setting', 'up', 'sacrificial', 'lamb', 'end', 'film', ""'that"", 'what', 'people', 'need', 'lame', 'attempt', 'draw', 'equation', 'Batman', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'was', 'extremely', 'tacky', 'contrived', 'written', 'Batman', 'books', 'Batman', 'intent', 'take', 'punishment', 'people', '*The', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'scene', 'was', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'was', 'useless', 'car', 'chase.And', 'course', 'self-important', 'pseudo', 'intellectual', 'verbiage', 'piled', 'characters', 'mouth', 'one', 'spoke', 'film', 'just', 'gave', 'grandiose', 'speeches', 'just', 'found', 'hard', 'take', 'seriouslyThis', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'entire', 'life', 'Clearly', 'Nolan', 'understanding', 'respect', 'Batman']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
659959,AK6LJZZPKEUN5,B00005JPY0,S. B. LANDER,"[9, 13]","I am very sorry to disagree with the masses but this movie was sub-par at best.  I completely agree with RBR Crazywater's review.  Where shall I begin?The action was too confusing.  It appeared and begun too haphazardly and perhaps, in an unpredictable manner, TOO randomly.  Do you remember how people would make fun of Batman's utility belt having just the right gadget for every possible scenario?  It was the same here for the Joker.  He always had the perfect set-up.  He just happened to be disguised as his own henchman?  He just happened to have a bomb planted in a criminal who just happened to be arrested and brought to the same jail?  He just happened to have 4000 pounds of explosives planted at the right place at the right time?  he just ALWAYS happened to have the right ""paid off"" cop in the right place at the right time?  It was a little too much....even for a comic book movie.  The Marvel movies never were that absurd with inserting thier reality into thier comic book universe.Christian Bale was not good at all.  He was surrounded by greatness.  Heath Leger, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and even Eric Roberts were all great.  Bale was not.  Poor screenplay was a factor as Bruce Wayne's lines were trite, mostly irrelevant, and outright uninteresting.  One of the most important componants of ANY BAtman story is the psychology of Bruce Wayne and how it affects Batman's decisions and actions and hence, his environment and supporting cast.  This was completely absent from this movie.  Bruce Wayne was as important to the plot as one of the common thugs.What is up with Batman's voice.  It was so intential that it was annoying and disgusting.  STOP IT!!!!This was NOT a Batman movie.  It was a James Bond installment.  With the last movie I was upset enough that Batman didn't invent his own ""toys"" like in all previous incarnations, but this movie was just too much.  Christian Bale was James Bond and Morgan Freeman was basically Q.  Combine that with the schene in Hong Kong so as to add international intrigue and suspense, and it is a 007 flick.Summation of the bad points.  I love the character of Batman but he was a non-factor in this movie.  It was dark, visually confusing, had a non-linear plot (anything that happened could have happened at any point.) and basically left me feeling depressed and unsatisfied.there are a few good points however. Although not his best role ever, I still think that Gary Oldman is the greatest and most talented actor in the world today.  Also, in line with what everyone has ever said, Heath Leger's performance was probably the greatest acting performance I have EVER seen in my life.  HE and HE alone WAS the movie.  Please...he deserves the Oscar (and not just because of his tragedy.)Watch this movie if your are a comic book /superhero geek like me.  Watch it if you want to see an incredible portrayal of the Joker. Please do not tell me it is a 5-star movie, or that it is the best comic book movie ever, because you would be way way way way off. (I choose Spiderman 1, or 1978's Superman 1)Again, sorry to disagree with the masses, but I have been a DC comic and Batman fanatic for over 30 years.  Please weigh my opinions accordingly.

659961,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B00005JPY0,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[2, 3]","There's no doubt that Christopher Nolan took great care in his creation of ""The Dark Knight"".  He corrected one of the key mistakes he made in ""Batman Begins""--shooting the fight sequences from the outside of the fights as opposed to being in the middle of the rumbles.But what seems lost in the many discussions of this movie--the performance of Ledger, whether or not Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent was necessary (I believe he was), and the length of the movie--is how Christopher and Jonathan Nolan meshed three Batman tales--""The Dark Knight Returns"" (Which has become a base for ANY Batman story), ""The Killing Joke"" from 1988, and the ""No Man's Land"" storyline from 1999--and have made not just a superhero movie, but a masterful character study of Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne.The basis of the Batman/Joker dynamic is, and always has been, that Batman never gets a pure victory over the Joker, that somehow the Joker always--especially in this production--has the proverbial card up his sleeve.  I strongly believe that Bob Kane would approve of that view.  Being as that Bale's Wayne is not so much millionaire with a secret identity as he is a man with split (if not multiple) personas, this seems unsettling.  What the Nolans have done in the screen play is shown three Bruces--the playboy who dates models and ballerinas and sleeps at board meetings, the gravel-voiced vigilante we all know and love, and the Bruce who controls the two--the one who wants to get Gotham going in the right direction, and then settle down to a life with Rachel Dawes (Embodied with much more spunk here by Maggie Gyllenhal than Katie Holmes).This is what makes this movie fascinating to watch from a psychological standpoint.  Bruce is fighting for the better Gotham, but also for his own better life.  But the city is so far gone--something Rachel understands--that not even Bruce's belief in Harvey Dent can save Wayne, and by extension, the city.  Throw into the mix an agent of chaos--the Joker--and this movie becomes a dark, melancholy work that ultimately is heroically sad.Once again, this is a well-acted story.  Bale--who follows this by becoming John Connor this year in ""Terminator:Salvation""--isn't ducking the emotionally/mentally scarred characters, and is throwing his physical presence into them.  Ledger...may permanently have wiped the image of Cesar Romero in the 1960's pancaking his face to hide his mustache, or the ""Jack as Joker"" in 1989.  Michael Caine's Alfred is a far more active and thoughtful character than Micheal Gough's Alfred in the Burton/Schumacher series; certainly more the surrogate father many of us are used to in the storyline.  Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon is also a notch up--world-weary, knowing, and understanding his working relationship with the Bat...isn't normal, but a necessary evil.  Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox is fun--that he knows and openly works with Bruce on tech for Batman's usage (Something not acknowledged for years in the print lineage) is a hoot.  As I said, I strongly believe that Aaron Eckhart's turn as Harvey Dent is pivotal.  Dent is the embodiement of what Bruce wants to believe Gotham could and should be.

659962,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JPY0,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 3]","How can you review Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" without starting with Heath Ledger?  Not only does Ledger, as the Joker, give one of the best performances ever in a ""comic book movie,"" he does so with perhaps one of CB's greatest villains and in his final complete film performance?  The Joker has been hammed up for decades in the ""Batman"" TV series, comics, and movies, but Ledger turns the character into something completely sinister and original . . . we've seen this character a thousand times, but we've never seen this before.Ledger's Joker is an agent of chaos - all he wants is to mess with the established order, to be a burr under civilization's saddle.  Money is a mere tool to buy dynamite, bullets, and stupid henchmen, and as the Joker says, ""they come cheap.""  This Joker is not going to play silly games just to leave a calling card - he wants nothing more than to take down the best and brightest civilization has to offer.Interestingly, the Joker (and the filmmakers) choose to make the best and the brightest neither Bruce Wayne or the Batman, but instead Harvey Dent (played perfectly by Aaron Eckhart), Gotham's crusading district attorney.  Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, grimly charismatic as always) sees Dent as his means to return to a normal life - with Dent cleaning up the streets, the city won't need Batman any more.  And if he gives up the mask, he can marry sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a welcome replacement for Katie Holmes).The fact that Dawes may be in love with Dent doesn't really play into Wayne's plans at first . . . but eventually it does.While Wayne's affairs of the heart are playing out, the Joker is consolidating his power on Gotham's crime scene.  Using ingenious means only available to the criminally insane, the Joker unites the various crime families in an effort to bring down the Batman.  Not necessarily kill - the Joker has something far more sinister up his sleeve.  It's no surprise that every time the Joker looms on screen, the soundtrack cranks up a creepy, grinding sound that is only tangentially related to music, but sets the perfect tone for this madcap murderer.This excellent plot gives plenty of opportunities for Nolan to set up fantastic action scenes in the streets of Gotham (actually Chicago, a nice replacement for New York).  Nolan also gives plenty of opportunities for the stellar cast - that also includes Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and the sainted Morgan Freeman - to do some serious acting.Parents should be warned - if you're looking for a second movie for a super-hero double feature for the kiddies to go alongside ""Ironman,"" you should probably watch this movie first without your kids around.  While ""Ironman"" goes for the ""safe"" kind of cartoonish violence, ""The Dark Knight"" is grim stuff and definitely not for every kid.  My older daughter is only 5, and while she's enjoyed many PG movies, I won't let her anywhere near this one.  This is not a criticism - just an acknowledgement that ""The Dark Knight"" is a movie where the villains play hardball.The superhero movie is definitely in a Golden Age, and ""The Dark Knight"" belongs on the list of Great Comic Book Movies ever.",5,"""Dark Knight"" is a superb comic book film, but elevated to greatness by the Ledger tragedy",1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,3190,"['How', 'can', 'review', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'starting', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Not', 'only', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'give', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'so', 'perhaps', 'one', 'CB', 'greatest', 'villains', 'final', 'complete', 'film', 'performance', 'Joker', 'been', 'hammed', 'up', 'decades', 'Batman', 'TV', 'series', 'comics', 'movies', 'Ledger', 'character', 'something', 'completely', 'sinister', 'original', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'character', 'thousand', 'times', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before.Ledger', 'Joker', 'agent', 'chaos', 'mess', 'established', 'order', 'be', 'burr', 'civilization', 'saddle', 'Money', 'mere', 'tool', 'buy', 'dynamite', 'bullets', 'stupid', 'henchmen', 'Joker', 'come', 'cheap', 'Joker', 'not', 'going', 'play', 'silly', 'games', 'just', 'leave', 'calling', 'card', 'nothing', 'more', 'take', 'down', 'best', 'brightest', 'civilization', 'offer.Interestingly', 'Joker', 'filmmakers', 'choose', 'make', 'best', 'brightest', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Batman', 'instead', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Gotham', 'crusading', 'district', 'attorney', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'grimly', 'charismatic', 'always', 'Dent', 'return', 'normal', 'life', 'Dent', 'cleaning', 'up', 'streets', 'city', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'Batman', 'more', 'up', 'mask', 'can', 'marry', 'sweetheart', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'welcome', 'replacement', 'Katie', 'Holmes', '.The', 'fact', 'Dawes', 'may', 'be', 'love', 'Dent', ""n't"", 'really', 'play', 'Wayne', 'plans', 'first', 'eventually', 'Wayne', 'affairs', 'heart', 'are', 'playing', 'out', 'Joker', 'consolidating', 'power', 'Gotham', 'crime', 'scene', 'Using', 'ingenious', 'means', 'only', 'available', 'criminally', 'insane', 'Joker', 'various', 'crime', 'families', 'effort', 'bring', 'down', 'Batman', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'kill', 'Joker', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'sinister', 'sleeve', 'surprise', 'time', 'Joker', 'screen', 'soundtrack', 'up', 'creepy', 'grinding', 'sound', 'only', 'tangentially', 'related', 'music', 'perfect', 'tone', 'madcap', 'murderer.This', 'excellent', 'plot', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'Nolan', 'set', 'up', 'fantastic', 'action', 'scenes', 'streets', 'Gotham', 'actually', 'Chicago', 'nice', 'replacement', 'New', 'York', 'Nolan', 'also', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'stellar', 'cast', 'also', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'sainted', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'do', 'serious', 'acting.Parents', 'should', 'be', 'warned', ""'re"", 'looking', 'second', 'movie', 'super-hero', 'double', 'feature', 'kiddies', 'go', 'alongside', 'Ironman', 'should', 'probably', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'kids', 'Ironman', 'safe', 'kind', 'cartoonish', 'violence', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'grim', 'stuff', 'definitely', 'not', 'kid', 'older', 'daughter', 'only', '5', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'PG', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'anywhere', 'one', 'not', 'criticism', 'just', 'acknowledgement', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'movie', 'where', 'villains', 'play', 'hardball.The', 'superhero', 'movie', 'definitely', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'list', 'Great', 'Comic', 'Book', 'Movies', 'ever']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

659967,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B00005JPY0,Sean Curley,"[4, 8]","In 2005, Christopher Nolan relaunched Warner Brothers' dormant Batman franchise with ""Batman Begins"", an exceptionally well-made film that took a realistic, detailed approach to the origins of DC's biggest hero (arguably the most popular hero in the world).  Now, three years later, Nolan and his star Christian Bale return to the property, and they deliver what is perhaps the greatest superhero film ever made (and a great film, besides), on ethat will become the model all others will look up to.The first movie ended on an optimistic note: Batman had saved the city, and had ""really started something"", in Gordon's words: however, one tease at the end (the Joker's playing card) hinted at the violent chaos to come in the next movie.  And here, Nolan delivers on that, in the form of the late Heath Ledger, in a performance that is already becoming legendary.  Gordon closed the last film with a prediction that Batman's presence would lead to escalation in the criminal community.  He was right.  The desperate Gotham mafia (a coalition of Slavic, African-American, and Italian gangsters) turn to the Joker to deal with Batman before he brings them all down.  The Joker enacts a campaign of terror designed to smoke Batman out: the caped crusader and his chief allies, DA Harvey Dent and Police Commissioner Gordon (the first film's Commissioner Loeb is among the Joker's first victims), along with assistants Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox, must deal with this embodiment of chaos.  Dent, as well, is romancing Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a superior replacement for Katie Holmes).Nolan and his screenwriters draw on several different comics sources to create their vision of Batman, the Joker, and Gotham.  The most obvious among these are Alan Moore's ""The Killing Joke"" (perhaps the seminal Batman vs. Joker story) and Jeph Loeb's ""Batman: The Long Halloween"", which involved Harvey Dent and the struggle between Batman and the mob.  Moore's Joker was conceived of as having no fixed origin, and Nolan follows throuhg with this: the Joker has no origin, though he offers several different versions to different people.Conversely, the film diverges noticeably from the comics in its depiction of Two-Face.  There is no split personality in evidence, nor any of the psychological problems that said personality springs from.  Two-Face has more or less been cut down to his gimmick, and then a new rationale for the gimmick constructed to suit the themes of the film.  Eckhart is very compelling as this version, which also sports some effectively grisly makeup/effects.""Batman Begins"" was notable for being the first Batman film to really be about Batman, instead of being a showcase for various freakshow villains; this is dialled back a bit in this film, where the villains take more of a centre-stage.  Batman still has a significant character arc, but the story is less about him; notice that the buzz surrounding the movie centres on Ledger, not Bale.  That Batman is less of a focus is not a bad thing in and of itself, so long as the villains are well-done, which they are.  Caine, Freeman, Oldman, and Gyllenhaal are all effective supporting cast.One of the most notable things about this film is its ability to make the audience doubt the outcome, bringing the storytelling styles that have flourished in the comics industry for at least twenty years to the big screen at last; Spider-Man succeeded in 2002 where he failed in the comics in 1973, but now the audience is never sure whether Batman's allies will reliably make it out alive.  It's a jolt that one hopes will allow future comics adaptations to reach the greater diversity of outcomes that the comics currently enjoy.A bravura effort from all involved.",5,Nolan delivers the greatest superhero film yet.,1218844800,"08 16, 2008",2008,3735,"['2005', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'relaunched', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'dormant', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'exceptionally', 'well-made', 'film', 'took', 'realistic', 'detailed', 'approach', 'origins', 'DC', 'biggest', 'hero', 'arguably', 'most', 'popular', 'hero', 'world', 'Now', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'Nolan', 'star', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'return', 'property', 'deliver', 'what', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'become', 'model', 'others', 'will', 'look', 'up', 'to.The', 'first', 'movie', 'ended', 'optimistic', 'note', 'Batman', 'had', 'saved', 'city', 'had', 'really', 'started', 'something', 'Gordon', 'words', 'however', 'one', 'tease', 'end', 'Joker', 'playing', 'card', 'hinted', 'violent', 'chaos', 'come', 'next', 'movie', 'here', 'Nolan', 'form', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'already', 'becoming', 'legendary', 'Gordon', 'closed', 'last', 'film', 'prediction', 'Batman', 'presence', 'would', 'lead', 'escalation', 'criminal', 'community', 'was', 'right', 'desperate', 'Gotham', 'mafia', 'coalition', 'Slavic', 'African-American', 'Italian', 'gangsters', 'turn', 'Joker', 'deal', 'Batman', 'down', 'Joker', 'campaign', 'terror', 'designed', 'smoke', 'Batman', 'caped', 'crusader', 'chief', 'allies', 'DA', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Police', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'first', 'film', 'Commissioner', 'Loeb', 'Joker', 'first', 'victims', 'assistants', 'Alfred', 'Pennyworth', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'must', 'deal', 'embodiment', 'chaos', 'Dent', 'as', 'well', 'romancing', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'superior', 'replacement', 'Katie', 'Holmes', '.Nolan', 'screenwriters', 'draw', 'several', 'different', 'comics', 'sources', 'create', 'vision', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'Gotham', 'most', 'obvious', 'are', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'Killing', 'Joke', 'perhaps', 'seminal', 'Batman', 'vs.', 'Joker', 'story', 'Jeph', 'Loeb', 'Batman', 'Long', 'Halloween', 'involved', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'struggle', 'Batman', 'mob', 'Moore', 'Joker', 'was', 'conceived', 'having', 'fixed', 'origin', 'Nolan', 'throuhg', 'Joker', 'origin', 'several', 'different', 'versions', 'different', 'people.Conversely', 'film', 'noticeably', 'comics', 'depiction', 'Two-Face', 'split', 'personality', 'evidence', 'psychological', 'problems', 'said', 'personality', 'springs', 'Two-Face', 'more', 'less', 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'gimmick', 'then', 'new', 'rationale', 'gimmick', 'constructed', 'suit', 'themes', 'film', 'Eckhart', 'very', 'compelling', 'version', 'also', 'sports', 'effectively', 'grisly', 'makeup/effects', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'notable', 'being', 'first', 'Batman', 'film', 'really', 'be', 'Batman', 'instead', 'being', 'showcase', 'various', 'freakshow', 'villains', 'dialled', 'back', 'bit', 'film', 'where', 'villains', 'take', 'more', 'centre-stage', 'Batman', 'still', 'significant', 'character', 'arc', 'story', 'less', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'Ledger', 'not', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'less', 'focus', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'so', 'long', 'villains', 'are', 'well-done', 'are', 'Caine', 'Freeman', 'Oldman', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', 'effective', 'supporting', 'cast.One', 'most', 'notable', 'things', 'film', 'ability', 'make', 'audience', 'doubt', 'outcome', 'bringing', 'storytelling', 'styles', 'have', 'flourished', 'comics', 'industry', 'least', 'twenty', 'years', 'big', 'screen', 'last', 'Spider-Man', 'succeeded', '2002', 'where', 'failed', 'comics', '1973', 'now', 'audience', 'never', 'sure', 'Batman', 'allies', 'will', 'reliably', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'jolt', 'one', 'will', 'allow', 'future', 'comics', 'adaptations', 'reach', 'greater', 'diversity', 'outcomes', 'comics', 'currently', 'enjoy.A', 'bravura', 'effort', 'involved']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

Much has been made of Ledgers take on the iconic Joker and he does not dissappoint.  When I heard a couple of years ago that he was Nolan's choice for the joker, I was like..""What the f?!!"", Heath Ledger!!!, but he really infuses the character a sinister darkness.  At first, I was not crazy about his grunge look, with the greasy hair and smeared makeup, but as the movie progressed, the look was perfect.  The one on ones between the Joker and Bale's pent up Batman, really made the movie for me, the way the Joker taunts him and makes him look at his own demons is just great acting on Ledgers part.  Maggie Gyllenhaul is a real upgrade from the limited Holmes and Aaron Ekhart is perfect as Harvey Dent, with his chisled features and Redford hair, he cuts the perfect white knight image, though I was surprised at his look as he becomes Two-Face, it was unnerving, but really not as scary as it should have been.  Frankly, the only thing negative i can say about this film, is that with all the millions spent, couldnt they have come up with a hospital that didnt look like a regional medical center in some little backwater, it looked nothing like what a big city hospital looks like, I was shocked at the cheapness of the scenes there, it was incongruent with the rest of the movie, it was like an alien from another much cheaper B movie.  Overall, great movie, the best Batman movie by far...and Batman Begin was very good so that's saying a lot.

Tim Burton's two films Batman and Batman Returns were very entertaining. Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever was fair at best, and Schumacher's Batman and Robin was absolutely atrocious (think the TV series).The Dark Knight is so head and shoulders above what Burton did that it makes the Schumacher movies look like a bad 60s TV show. The Dark Knight even outdoes Batman Begins, and that's saying a lot!Just as the title of Batman Begins was the best description of that movie, so is the title The Dark Knight for this one. In Batman Begins we saw exactly why and how Batman became Batman. In The Dark Knight we see a superhero with a seriously darker personality than his alter ego Bruce Wayne. And the Dark Knight must battle with some seriously dark, conflicting moral issues as well as dealing with a seriously dark villain.Heath Ledger will get big awards for his portrayal of The Joker...mark my words. And not because he died and to honor him. No. He'll get awards because every aspect of the role was delivered perfectly. Creepy. Genius. Crazy. Brilliant. From his vocal inflictions to that eerie way he kept licking his scars when he talked. Ledger will be sorely missed going forward.Both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger make you believe that Batman and The Joker are real. The rest of the cast is perfect too. All of the familiar faces are back from Batman Begins with the exception of Katie Holmes (replaced quite un-noticeably by Maggie Gyllenhaal...and I meant that as kind of a back-handed compliment).The special effects, cool devices and toys are back too...including an updated Tumbler (in keeping with Batman Begins, out are the stupid nicknames Batmobile, Batcycle, Batcave, Bat-etcetera).The Dark Knight is suspenseful, scary at times, very emotional at times and most importantly well-acted. The entire cast took their roles very serious and it made the movie that much more believable, real and...well...just awesome.

659990,A1XUNEVQG3YMYC,B00005JPY0,"smarmer ""smarmer""","[99, 125]","First of all, this is a GREAT film, not just a great Batman film.Others have compared Christopher Nolan's two Batman films to the Tim Burton Batman films, so I won't repeat their observations.  Let me simply say that everything about this movie, from the script to the casting to the CGI to the acting and ultimately the directing is superb.Now to Plato.  The meta-message of The Dark Knight is a meditation on the nature of good and evil, the veneer of civilization, the virtues of principle and the necessity and the danger of bending principle in emergencies, the differences between evil for gain or power and evil for mere destruction and chaos, and the tension between public duty and private loyalty.  Finally there is the question of the place for facts and the place for ""sacred"" myth.(Caution: this review refers to specific scenes and characters.)The mafia in Gotham is evil for gain and power.  They want money and they want influence.  They also want order.  When the manager of the bank objects to the robbery he complains that the usual rules and courtesies among criminals are being violated.  The corrupt police officers are evil for gain as well.  They too need general acceptance of rules and procedures.The Joker is evil for evil's sake.  He sows chaos and disorder and wants to expose the thin veneer of civilization.  He seeks only to unmask what he sees as contradiction and hypocrisy in human nature and to demonstrate that so-called good citizens are really evil underneath.Scarecrow, who was featured in Batman Begins and has a minor role in the drug bust scene in The Dark Knight, is a deranged psychiatrist whose evil comes from desire for power over others as he uncovers the weaknesses in the minds of others.The Mayor is out for power but does not resort to evil.  Police Lieutenant James Gordon represents incorruptible good.  This is ultimately stressed when Gordon must make a choice between public duty and personal relationship.  Batman faces that same dilemma when he must decide whether to rescue Harvey Dent or Rachel Dawes.  Likewise, the passengers in the ferries must choose between what they are told will be personal survival and the deaths of others, in another of The Joker's nefarious experiments.  When the Wayne Industries accountant is about to reveal the identity of Batman, The Joker announces that the accountant must die, and citizens try to assassinate him.  Personal safety trumps adherence to the good sometimes, but not all times.Batman seems weaker than The Joker because he adheres to rules.  The Biblical injunction, ""Justice, justice shall you pursue,"" has been understood as demanding that justice be pursued justly.  Evil, especially evil for its own sake, makes no such demand.  We see this every time terrorists deliberately target innocents and hide themselves behind children knowing that those in pursuit will not purposely aim at innocent bystanders.  This gives evil a huge temporary advantage.Yet sometimes the good must bend and even break the rules.  Abraham Lincoln suspended the right of habeas corpus during a critical interval during the Civil War.  Batman asks Lucius Fox to preside over such a broken rule to locate and catch The Joker.  When and how can we know when good can break rules to catch evil?  Batman answers by creating a mechanism to restore the rules as soon as the crisis is over.Alfred Pennyworth indirectly poses the question, ""Knowing that evil, if attacked, will double its efforts and create even more destruction, is it really wise to go after evil?""  The bad guys cause huge destruction after Batman and Gordon squeeze the mafia, creating enormous conflict and guilt in Batman.  But without disturbing the hornet's nest, evil would prevail anyway.  So the battle must be joined in any event.Harvey Dent is extremely complex.  He berates Gordon for compromising his police unit by accepting some corrupt officers to his staff.  Gordon answers by claiming that sometimes those who know corruption can be the most effective in fighting it.  Dent is identified as the ""White Knight"" whose public persona will rally the public against evil.  But Dent himself participates in an untruthful diversion to help trap The Joker.  Even he compromises good for the sake of fighting evil.When Rachel and Dent are being held in danger Batman and Gordon each race to save them.  Batman declares he is going to save Rachel but is tricked into going to Dent's location.  Rachel dies and Dent is severely injured.  In a brilliant make-up creation the right side of Dent's face remains normal and the left side is severely and dramatically changed.  He has physically transformed from a White Knight into his derisive nickname, ""Two Face.""  Reminiscent of Jekyll and Hyde, Dent's nature is now permanently divided.The death of Rachel has destroyed Dent's belief in good and has dissolved his commitment to the public's welfare.  Now he only thinks of his own personal pain and loss.  But he is not a creature of pure evil.  His hurt and grudge turn him into a near nihilist.  The lucky coin with two heads has been transformed.  One side is now ruined and becomes for him the oracle of ethics.  Life and death depend solely on chance; solely on the flip of a coin.Furious at Gordon for the actions of the corrupt police officers in Gordon's unit who betrayed Rachel, Dent finds Gordon's wife and children.  Recognizing that Gordon's young son is dearest to him, Dent demands that Gordon reassure the son as Dent flips his coin to decide the boy's fate.Batman, for whom good and evil, life and death, are not decided by chance, intervenes.  In their fight Dent and Batman both plunge to the ground from a height.  Batman survives and tells Gordon that the myth of Dent's goodness must become the rallying point for the city.  Dent remains the White Knight, while Batman allows himself to become The Dark Knight, spurned by the public, identified wrongly but necessarily as the source of evil, who can then secretly work for the good.  Only Gordon and his son know the true story behind this myth.  Gotham thus gets the hero it deserves.The Joker is captured but his fate is left hanging, literally and figuratively.  We do not even know for certain whether Dent died, or unconscious, has survived his fall.  All we know for sure is that the complexity of fighting evil and the compromises permitted for good are unsolved.  Civilization continues but only barely.  The Joker has destroyed Rachel, transformed Dent, and caused everlasting turmoil and doubt within Batman.The need to resort to myth over facts after arguing previously for the absolute value of Truth, ends Plato's Republic, with the famous story of the myth of the cave.  We too are left in the dark, in the company of The Dark Knight, at the end of this superb film.We can only wonder what the sequel might have been, with The Joker and Two Face challenging Batman, had Heath Ledger survived.Speaking of Heath Ledger I want to mention a few things about his performance as The Joker.  There is a small pantheon of presentations of psychiatrically deranged individuals in film.  Among the best are Olivia Thailand in Snake Pit, Gregory Peck in Spellbound, Jack Nickelson in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight.  Ledger's perhaps surpasses them all.For those with a psychiatric or medical background like myself, the use of his slight head tics and the seemingly random movement of his tongue suggest that The Joker has been in a psychiatric institution and medicated with drugs that left him with a case of tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious and irreversible movement disorder that can be a side effect of certain psychotropic medications.  This touch, which I believe was meticulously and masterfully added to the portrayal by Ledger, makes The Joker both more convincing and more dangerous.I am told that Ledger immersed himself in The Joker's state of mind before and during the filming.  It is not unknown for an actor to have difficulty extricating himself from such a wrenching and demanding role.  Joaquin Phoenix and Faye Dunaway have each spoken about this as they worked to emerge from Johnny Cash and Joan Crawford.  If this was so for Ledger then The Joker got an undeserved bitter laugh while we have only tears.Addendum July 23, 2008:  One of The Joker's henchmen must have gotten into my spell checker to change Olivia De Havilland into Olivia Thailand.  Sorry for that.I want to expand on one point distinguishing Batman from Dent.  When The Joker reveals the locations of Rachel and Dent, Gordon asks Batman which location he is going to.  Batman says Rachel's but I believe he is aware of The Joker's double crosses and switches, and knowingly goes to Dent's location.  That Batman expresses no surprise at finding Dent rather than Rachel confirms this view.  Bruce Wayne would have rescued Rachel but Batman, a true hero, puts his public duty above his private preferences.After Rachel is killed Dent loses his sense of public duty and loses faith in goodness.  Batman, equally in love with Rachel and equally convinced she will marry him, retains his public duty and goodness, though he is burdened with grief and guilt.  Perhaps a White Knight cannot endure crushing disappointment.  Perhaps only a Dark Knight, who has already experienced the crushing loss of viewing the murders of his father and mother, and holding himself responsible for that tragedy, can make his way through darkness without losing his way.A final note, in response to a commenter who took issue with my portrayal of Gordon as incorruptibly good, I agree that Gordon made pragmatic choices, and refer to them in the essay.  But as a person he is beyond bribery and never loses sight of his duty to the citizenry.  So how about personally incorruptible but one who made some seemingly necessary but ultimately unwise alliances.",5,Batman channels Plato's Republic,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,9903,"['First',

And over the years grew addicted to comic movies.  I loved Batman Returns, had fun with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and even grooved on Dolph Lundgren's Punisher.  But suddenly, I grew a brain and discovered that most, if not all of these films lacked one thing; depth and substance.  I wanted more than mindless action and 30 seconds of character development.  I waited and waited, and was given very few choices that gave me that depth and stayed basically true to the feel of the comic.  I waited for Batman Forever and was disappointed, likewise with Batman & Robin.  I followed many others with the very occasional jem.  Spiderman and Spiderman 2, Hellboy and Hellboy 2, Hulk (not Incredible Hulk, which was NOT incredible but okay) and Sin City to name the very few.  But never any word on a new Batman.I began to loose hope, that it would be made, and if so if it would be good. Then 2005 came around and I was finally treated to an almost (not quite, but almost) pitch perfect Batman film.  Batman Begins delivered what I wanted, a flesh and blood retelling of Batman.  Why did he become Batman, how did he become Batman, and what could have kept him from slipping into insanity while keeping a duel life.  I was impressed that Chris Nolan (director of both BB and TDK) didn't go the easy way and use a very famous villian, but instead used a more ethereal choice; with Ra's A Ghol'.So, knowing that he would make a sequel, I waited.  Soon, i was blessed with the opportunity to see The Dark Knight.  And finally I had that PERFECT Batman film I'd so longed for.  From the choice of actors, to the deep and dark storyline, Chris Nolan made a perfect film.  Christian Bale, shows us what it's like to be Batman.  The questioning and sad hero, who fights day to day to seek some reason to continue his emotionally and physically exhausting quest.  Aaron Eckhart, gives a suave, stubborn and sweet performance as D.A Harvey Dent, and does just as well showing the despair and mania that is Two-Face.  He is; next to Heath; the best part of the film.  I felt for him when he lost his love, and could understand how he could be manipulated with that pain.Other cast did wonderful as well.  Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine show why their Oscar winners.  Kudos really needs to go out to Gary Oldman, who wonderfully fleshed out Detective/Comissioner Gordon.  He did a marvelous job showing Gordons guts in his job, his intelligence and his fear for the people of Gotham's safety.  Maggie Gyllenhaul did something with Rachel Dawes character that Katie Holmes didn't, made her a real person, not just someone acting the part. I could understand her confusion in her love of both Bruce and Harvey.  A confusion that put her in great danger.  But to the man of the hour.  Heath Ledger's performance of The Joker is one for the books.  He may not have been dumped into chemicals that turned his hair green and his face white, he may not have used the practical jokes that many wanted to see, but he did what others have tried to do with the character.  He made him scary, manical, intelligent and worty of being Batman's Clown Prince of Crime.  Heath deserves an Oscar nod, if not the award itself. (let the comments begin)The films action sequences were also very impressive, from the opening bank heist to the freeway chase, to the ever impressive big rig flip and bat-pod sequence.  The action is there also.  There was also something else, that depth that had so eluded me.  You felt for the character's; were invested in the outcome and moved or angered by the choices they willingly or were forced to make (the ferry sequence comes to mind).  The Dark Knight is not your kids version of the caped crusader, it's a violent, visceral and brutally real look at the choices we make or have made for us and how those choices can lead to chaos.  It's also a close look at the essence of good and evil and how evil can twist one's good intent.So, in short, after many years of waiting; with a few exceptions, I finally found the comic book film that I longed for. A dark, brutal version of what it means to be a hero.  What it means to keep fighting even if you don't know why, and a film that properly shows what the fight would be like in the real world.

Oh how wrong I was.  This film is simply superb.It is dark without descending into a parody, it has humour but without being in poor taste, action scenes to rival any other films made at this time and a plot that is actually engaging and which is lacking from most actions film and other films in the Batman franchise.  The fact that Heath Ledger is as good as everyone says (and more) is simply the icing on the cake.I was worried that everyone was only saying how good Ledger was due to his untimely death, but he really is excellent in this film and you will never see a bad guy played with such style, menace, humour and twisted charm.  He is spellbinding every time he is screen.Bale is OK as Batman, but his gravely voice made me laugh out loud at numerous points.  He may be able to carry off the kicks and punches, but he is hilarious as an action hero.  Caine is great as Alfred and Gary Oldman and Maggie Gyllenhaal round out the impressive cast very well indeed.Hans Zimmer supplies a suitably brooding, but strangely aimless soundtrack.  I like it (and have bought it) but it doesn't seem to reach any great crescendo like with his other soundtracks.  It has a very similar feel throughout.  Never-the-less it suits the film well.This film has thrills and spills and kept me highly entertained for the duration and it is a film I could easily watch again for Ledgers performance alone.

660000,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00005JPY0,S. Rhodes,"[7, 10]","In 2005, Christopher Nolan rebooted the Batman franchise with Batman Begins.  The former film went on to be labeled one of the best comic book movies ever made.  It was no surprise that a sequel was in order.  Much like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is helped out by having a stellar cast, with new cast members being even more memorable than many of the returning ones.The Dark Knight begins with a bang.  Where a bank robbery begins and as you might have guessed, the Joker has a little something to do with it.  But it's also the perfect introduction to someone who is quite possibly the most terrifying villain I've ever seen in a movie.  Just from this opening sequence alone, you know exactly what to expect from the Joker.  And that is quite simply: You don't know what to expect.  And this plays on throughout the entire movie with one twist after another as the Joker continually stays one step ahead of Batman in several instances.  At first it seems like the Joker has a simple goal.  Get Batman to reveal who he really is.  And if he doesn't reveal who he is, people will die.On the other end of the spectrum however, a new hero is rising in Gotham.  And his name is Harvey Dent.  If Batman is the Dark Knight, Harvey Dent is the White Knight.  Where as Batman is a vigilante, Harvey uses the law as his weapon, and it proves effective when he's able to put an entire mob in jail.  This catches the attention of the Joker.  What unfolds is a movie of such epic proportions, to say more than what I've already stated would be taking away from an experience that every movie goer should experience.Let's just say one thing about the movie.  It's as unpredictable as the Joker himself.  With one plot twist after another and a plot that keeps you guessing until the very end, The Dark Knight not only manages to thrill you and keep you on the edge of your seat, but you barely notice that you've actually spent 152 minutes in a theater being glued to the screen.  The Dark Knight focuses very heavily on its characters, and it's a good thing they're all played by fine actors.Is Heath Ledger as good as everyone says he is?  You better believe it.  Not only does Heath Ledger outperform Jack Nicholson, but he manages to turn the Joker into a terrifying villain.  One you know you shouldn't mess with.  You're completely convinced that The Joker is crazy.  A nutcase.  Ledger performs all too well and you never once get the idea that he's overacting, either.  He comes off as vicious, scary and has a lot of dark humor to him.  This is the Joker as he was meant to be portrayed and Ledger tackles it head on.  Ledger does such a good job that almost any time Batman and The Joker confront each other you're actually praying, just hoping that Batman will kill him because the Joker is just that evil.  Equally impressive is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent.  He's got the charisma for the role and the delivery.  We know who Harvey eventually becomes, and the movie presents it all too well as it plays perfectly into the themes and character study that The Dark Knight is.  And as he makes his transformation into a fairly terrifying figure himself, he too begins to come off as all too convincing.  Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart do such a great job in their roles that they out perform and the likes of Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.There are also several impressive visual effects though out the film and some of the most intense action sequences I've ever seen.  Throughout the entire movie I was on the edge of my seat, even wondering at times how Batman was going to get out of certain situations.  Despite being over two and half hours long, the movie moves along at an excellent pace and keeps your eyes glued to the screen.  The movies overall dark mood is perfect as well and is played throughout.  There's some humor thrown in there, but much of it is fairly dark, fairly ironic humor--much of it from the Joker.  However, in terms of dark, The Dark Knight easily fits the title given to it.If there's one movie you need to see this summer, it needs to be The Dark Knight.  It easily outdoes Batman Begins and is easily one of the best films of 2008.",5,"""Why So Serious!?""",1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,4198,"['2005', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'rebooted', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'former', 'film', 'went', 'be', 'labeled', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'surprise', 'sequel', 'was', 'order', 'Much', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'helped', 'out', 'having', 'stellar', 'cast', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'being', 'even', 'more', 'memorable', 'many', 'returning', 'ones.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'bang', 'Where', 'bank', 'robbery', 'might', 'have', 'guessed', 'Joker', 'little', 'something', 'do', 'also', 'perfect', 'introduction', 'someone', 'who', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'terrifying', 'villain', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'Just', 'opening', 'sequence', 'alone', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'Joker', 'quite', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'entire', 'movie', 'one', 'twist', 'Joker', 'continually', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Batman', 'several', 'instances', 'first', 'Joker', 'simple', 'goal', 'Get', 'Batman', 'reveal', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'who', 'people', 'will', 'die.On', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'however', 'new', 'hero', 'rising', 'Gotham', 'name', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Batman', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'White', 'Knight', 'Where', 'Batman', 'vigilante', 'Harvey', 'law', 'weapon', 'effective', 'when', 'able', 'put', 'entire', 'mob', 'jail', 'attention', 'Joker', 'What', 'movie', 'such', 'epic', 'proportions', 'say', 'more', 'what', ""'ve"", 'already', 'stated', 'would', 'be', 'taking', 'away', 'experience', 'movie', 'goer', 'should', 'experience.Let', 'just', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'as', 'unpredictable', 'Joker', 'one', 'plot', 'twist', 'plot', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'not', 'only', 'thrill', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'barely', 'notice', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'spent', '152', 'minutes', 'theater', 'being', 'glued', 'screen', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'very', 'heavily', 'characters', 'good', 'thing', ""'re"", 'played', 'fine', 'actors.Is', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'as', 'good', 'everyone', 'better', 'believe', 'Not', 'only', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'outperform', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'turn', 'Joker', 'terrifying', 'villain', 'One', 'know', 'should', ""n't"", 'mess', ""'re"", 'completely', 'convinced', 'Joker', 'crazy', 'nutcase', 'Ledger', 'performs', 'too', 'well', 'never', 'once', 'get', 'idea', 'overacting', 'either', 'off', 'vicious', 'scary', 'lot', 'dark', 'humor', 'Joker', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'portrayed', 'Ledger', 'head', 'Ledger', 'good', 'job', 'almost', 'time', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'confront', 'other', ""'re"", 'actually', 'praying', 'just', 'hoping', 'Batman', 'will', 'kill', 'Joker', 'just', 'evil', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'got', 'charisma', 'role', 'delivery', 'know', 'who', 'Harvey', 'eventually', 'movie', 'too', 'well', 'perfectly', 'themes', 'character', 'study', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'transformation', 'fairly', 'terrifying', 'figure', 'too', 'come', 'off', 'too', 'convincing', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'out', 'perform', 'likes', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal.There', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'impressive', 'visual', 'effects', 'film', 'most', 'intense', 'action', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'even', 'wondering', 'times', 'how', 'Batman', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'certain', 'situations', 'being', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'movie', 'along', 'excellent', 'pace', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'movies', 'overall', 'dark', 'mood', 'perfect', 'well', 'played', 'humor', 'thrown', 'there', 'much', 'fairly', 'dark', 'fairly', 'ironic', 'humor', 'much', 'Joker', 'However', 'terms', 'dark', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'easily', 'title', 'given', 'it.If', 'one', 'movie', 'need', 'see', 'summer', 'be', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'easily', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2008']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

His personal loss was tragic but well-conceived. His physical loss due to the prior event was unrealistic.

660003,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00005JPY0,S. Schell,"[1, 3]","It's nice to know that a film with such high expectations has finally met them.  It's record-breaking box office sales certainly do serve to highlight this very thing, having raked in $66.4 million on its opening day and accruing a whopping total of $155 million its opening weekend, breaking both records set by 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"".  With five scenes filmed with IMAX cameras, the untimely death of one of its lead actors and talk of the film being THE summer blockbuster of 2008, it makes one want to buy that extra-large tub of popcorn because it's worth the experience.And experience it you will.  ""The Dark Knight"" has set a new precedent for comic book movies and fan boys everywhere will be gushing praise for Christopher Nolan's artsy and dignified portrayal of one of the oldest and most classic hero-villain combos of all time.The movie kicks off with, appropriately enough, a bank heist, Nolan gearing his audience up for the ride of their lives.  The perps are donning ghoulish clown masks as they spray gunfire about the building and load up cash from the vault.  As they scramble to make their getaway, one by one they systematically kill each other, their group impregnated with a sinister paranoia.  Ultimately there is just one left standing at the end of it all and he makes a grand exit in a school bus, disappearing into the traffic-riddled metropolis whilst law enforcement arrives moments too late.Meanwhile, under the assumption that Gotham's most serious threats are now subdued and/or gone (Ra Al Ghul and the Scarecrow from ""Batman Begins""), Batman seeks to share the load by joining forces with Lt. Jim Gordon (Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart), the man whom Bruce Wayne would most like to appoint as Gotham's new and legitimate savior.  Gordon's and Dent's staunch approach to upholding the law is just what the city needs in order to dismantle its organized crime, but their dynamic triumvirate proves to be no match for the machinations of a criminal mastermind known only to the public as The Joker.  In the instant that the Joker appears, he makes his demands known to the criminal underworld and then proceeds to swoop in and take what he wants by force, despite their refusal to collaborate.  Unlike the parasitic monsters that had plagued Gotham in the past, The Joker is after a much bigger prize: the capitulation of Batman and the subsequent surrender of Gotham's citizens to his inconstant wiles.  In his fight to stop him, Batman will come face to face with good and evil and in the end has to choose between maintaining the delicate equilibrium of Gotham or romancing the unattainable.Director Christopher Nolan (who co-wrote the script with his brother Jonathan, the man responsible for the story behind 2000's ""Memento"") strayed from Burton's gothic surrealism and instead created a brooding and subdued metropolis in the previous film (Batman Begins); he continues this sultry but perilous landscape in ""The Dark Knight"" and this is the feel that ""Batman"" was meant to have all along.  An original score by James Newton Howard (The Sixth Sense) and Hans Zimmer (Gladiator) breathes even more life into the enthralling action, and with Wally Pfister's superb cinematography and effective editing from Lee Smith, Nolan and crew have created a perfectly-paced, heart-stopping thriller that will have you completely oblivious to its 2 hour and 30 minute time frame.Christian Bale is the best of the caped crusaders yet, his personification of Bruce Wayne the enigmatic and somber soul that has always been portrayed within the pages of DC Comics.  Where Burton never dared to venture, Nolan has Bruce Wayne savoring his elite businessman lifestyle by cavorting around with beautiful women (at one point, Wayne is aboard a yacht with the entire female entourage of the Russian ballet).  I'm sorry to say however that Bale, despite being a great actor, is overshadowed not only by Ledger's spectacular turn as the Joker but also all the mystic buzz that Ledger's death inspired.  Despite it all, he gives Batman/Bruce Wayne grace and dignity, along with an emotional wound that serves to once again spur his waning battle against terror.Maggie Gyllenhaal, as said by many critics, is an improvement over the bland Katie Holmes (though I'm sure some would've loved to see Holmes sitting in the proverbial ""hot seat"" near the end of the film); she shows a bit more spunk and tenacity and the chemistry between herself and Bale is certainly more believable.  Caine is dignified and sentimental as Alfred (the best Alfred yet) and Morgan Freeman gives another stately performance as Lucius Fox, Batman's highly skilled supplier of all his ""wonderful toys"".Who really gets a chance to show some diabolical skills is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, the man who would ultimately become Two-Face.  Eckhart's make-up job combined with additional CGI is grotesque and awesome in all its glory, combined with a spellbinding portrayal of a man who becomes as cold-blooded as the psychotic who disfigured him.  Credit must also be given for a superb and subtle Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, the man who would be Gotham's future Commissioner.Though Jack Nicholson was a real hoot as the Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 adaptation, 28-year-old Ledger blows him off the map with an exceedingly strange, devilish and frightening portrayal of madness personified.  This Joker is not someone to be trifled with - his ""magic trick"" involving a pencil will induce shock and disgust, and this is in only the first thirty seconds that he is introduced face-to-face with the audience.  Upon further introduction, none will be able to turn their eye from the haphazardly applied make-up which only serves to highlight his disfigurement rather than conceal it, the nasally and freakish intonations, the queer lip-licking and the unpredictability of his reflexive malice.Heather Ledger is, quite simply, marvelous.This will no doubt earn him a posthumous nomination for Best Actor come 2009's Oscars, possibly even a posthumous win (co-star Michael Caine has made a similar statement).  That makes watching Ledger cause his audience to shiver that much more bittersweet - it evokes the same ""what might've been"" sadness that River Phoenix, another young promising talent, did with fans when he died suddenly from a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993.  I didn't want the movie to end because I knew that there would never be a reprise from this actor so young yet so adept at his craft, let alone a repeat performance of the maniacal Joker in a potential sequel.Bottom Line: A tour-de-force on all levels.  Though you be an action fan, a comic book nerd, a movie-goer or simply a fan of the many talented actors and actresses within ""The Dark Knight"", all elements of the film will have you lying in wait eagerly for a sequel.  It just can't get here soon enough.",5,Heroic Masterpiece,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,6883,"['nice', 'know', 'film', 'such', 'high', 'expectations', 'finally', 'met', 'record-breaking', 'box',

I saw it first in theaters when it first came out but after seeing it again and having more time to reflect on this story I believe it is the best batman movie ever made. It shows  what I believe is the true raw essence of batman is. He is on the fine line of what is right and wrong and is almost willing to cross over to see justice prevail. Even after the love of his life dies he hold to the true values of a hero and does what he believes is the right thing to do. His conviction is the strongest of any of the other characters except the Joker who totally commits to chaos and anarchy at all costs even to the point of letting Harvey Dent possibly kill him.

660007,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B00005JPY0,Steffan Piper,"[13, 17]","I usually scribble out a few thousand words for the bulk of my reviews, but I really don't feel it necessary for this film. I'll try to be brief.I'll be honest and admit that several times during the film, I considered that it wasn't as good as the first film, but then the longer it progressed, the more I began to wonder if I was being dragged into a bear-trap device against my will. What I mean was that, somewhere, I suspected that something darker was going on below the surface, which wasn't obvious - which is a good thing, because by the time the ending wrapped up I got that incredibly overwhelmed sensation of tingling run down my spine like a chill realizing that I - only now, fully understood. And I think that was the way it was meant to be grasped. I also think that's what a lot of other folks saw in this film as well.Watching, I wondered what a lot of the elements had to do with each other, why did we have to wrap up business with `The Scarecrow', why did they have to keep mentioning `Falconi' and his influence, why did Bale's Batman now seem completely detached, emotionally void and at times robotic? Why were some of the fight scenes `rough' and lacking flair, looking too much like a `real' fight scene? Why was Bale growling his dialogue and now gaunt, unlike the fleshy faced Bale of `Begins' and `The Prestige'?Then as everything came to a close, again, I understood. I understood just what was going on with the actual development of the character and not just artificial development that comes off as trite, like Tony Stark sobering up from a long night of partying, no ... nothing like that at all. This was actual real, flesh and bones story-telling of some of the best caliber.Christopher Nolan goes against the grain by offering up something as grand as this in a serialized, comic-book action movie and making something vastly superior to a lot of other `dramatic' films in the market. With an intensely obscene budget of $185 million, the film pulls no punches.But maybe like Gordon said, maybe this is the Batman that's needed for these times and in this circumstance. Not a hero, but a protector, a guardian ... a dark knight.Some are upset, again, that Christopher Nolan fails to deliver a Director's Commentary, but I don't think he ever will. I firmly believe `The Prestige' is a modern day masterpiece much in the same line as Blade Runner, and we were left dangling without a commentary on that, I didn't expect to see one here, but I guess a lot of other people did.Last -- The Blu-Ray version of this movie is everything that modern technology have it hyped up to be.

Instead I honestly felt that it was a dark, disturbing and much too graphic movie. Mental illness, terrorism and graphic violence were the focus of this movie. If that appeals to you, then this is for you.There were so many deaths happening (and very horrifically) to innocent people that I was really contemplating turning it off. While I did want to see what would happen just enough to hang on and watch it to the end, it felt more stressful than exciting.The character development, personal relationships and the inner conflict of Bruce Wayne that have made the prior batman movies so interesting took a back seat to the psychotic mind of the joker. Batman was almost the supporting actor to the joker and it was more disturbing than fascinating. The prior Batmans (Val Kilmer, Michael Keaton...) had so much more to work with. While Christian Bale did a good job with what he had, he didn't have much to work with.Even the action sequences were not that intriguing. I was almost bored at times.I've enjoyed many of Heath Ledger's films, and I agree that he did a wonderful job. Yet it was difficult to watch. I think that if you like slasher movies and horror flicks you may like this. This is absolutely not for kids. Someone was comparing it to Ironman, and there's no contest.

660010,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00005JPY0,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 6]","Batman and company have been appearing in live-action adaptations through movies or tv for decades now, but 2005'sBatman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition)was the first (and long-awaited) appearance in live-action of a Batman and a Gotham City that resemble the comic book versions of the modern age.  ""The Dark Knight"" carries on this tradition, picking up about a year after ""Batman Begins"" with the Bat's war on crime in full swing and Carmine Falcone's once all-encompassing crime empire battered but plowing on.  Two major new forces enter in the form of new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's on his own full-speed-ahead crusade to clean up the city, and a madman clown calling himself The Joker (Heath Ledger, of course) who takes on good guys and bad guys alike in malicious glee.  Despite Joker's initial attacks on interests of the crime family, they end up taking him up on his offer for help against Batman because they feel the Bat poses the greater threat to their continued existance.  Joker's tactics wind up pushing Batman, Dent, and the GCPD closer to the edge.  Batman, Dent, and Jim Gordon - the three key figures in the battle to bring the city back from the brink it's been on for years - all wind up having to navigate situations where the line between right and wrong, and how to respond to different threats, isn't all that clear.Heath Ledger has justifiably gotten tons of praise for his portrayal of the psychotic Joker, and rightfully so - I feel it's equal to his performance inBrokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)- but the other performers have consequently gotten a little lost in the hype, and not gotten the credit they're do.  ""The Dark Knight"" features an outstanding ensemble cast, with Christian Bale making a great Batman, and Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox), Michael Caine (Alfred Pennyworth), Maggie Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes) and Eckhart (Dent) all bringing their characters to life.  This movie gives all the so-called 'supporting' characters, as well as the overall situation in Gotham, and the role of the city itself, important parts in building up the whole.  For a long time, I've felt that pretty much all modern comic book series are in reality ensemble books, with the character in the title (Batman, Superman, Hulk, whoever) being more the flagship character of the cast, instead of totally dominating things.  And ""The Dark Knight"" has done things that way too, has let different players and different facets of the story get good sceen time instead of just being the backdrop for Batman Vs. Joker.Visually, the film is incredible, and captures the comics's look incredibly - a couple of images look just like the photorealistic paintings of Alex Ross in a book likeJustice, Vol. 1.  The action is fantastic and tense.  The look of the city, the design of the Batmobile, everything on this level has been expertly crafted.As for flaws?  There are very, very few.  Some might argue that the Joker is in some ways different from in the comics - i.e. he wears white face paint instead of actually being a death white, things like that.  I think the thing that mattered was that they really got the character's mindset right was what mattered - he's not, despite his name, supposed to be a 'comedic relief' character, and he's not simply a criminal mastermind with an outlandish costume.  He's a hyperviolent psychopath who's arguably the most totally devoid-of-conscience enemy Batman's ever faced, and this comes across on screen.  The exact specifics of his appearance, etc. have varied over the years, but what's important, whether it's in the comics, the movies or elsewhere, is to get the character's core right.  The way Batman's handled is also excellent, and he's certainly built up more convincingly than in most of the pre-2005 movies, although I did find one glitch - the scene in which he thwarts one of the Falcone family's henchmen by seizing the gun barrel and bending it back.  It's very important to remember that Batman does Not have superhuman strenth, nor does his armored costume give him any special 'powers'.  This kind of thing only happened the once so it's no big drawback, but it is something the filmmakers might want to be conscious of so it doesn't get out of hand next time around.It certainly doesn't take away from the movie being one of the year's best though.  And without giving anything away, the ending only makes one more eager for the next chapter.

660012,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00005JPY0,Steve Douglas,"[1, 2]","So many have previously analyzed the movie, its special effects and the acting of Heath Ledger and everyone else involved that I will dispense with creating redundancy and only focus on the quality of the Blu Ray disc itself.There are two discs, the first with the feature film has several extra features showing how many scenes were created, details behind the suit and pod designs and the planning of the film.  The 2nd disc carries on with a very good psychological examination of the mythology and analysis of Batman as a human being displaying his commonalities with all of us.  The extras were really quite interesting and will take a special sitting just to watch them all. This set also came with an Ultra Violet download you can assess via your computer.  I did not attempt to do so however.The Dark Knight on Blu Ray.  I do have the film on Standard Def and it was really quite good, but the video on BluRay definitely surpasses it with a very strong contrast, deep coloration and realistic skin tones.  Even in the many dark scenes there was no disturbing grain or artifacting at all.  The one, very small problem, occurred in the very beginning of the film when there is a panning overhead shot of Gotham City itself.  In one of the vents and windows I did notice some stair stepping.  This lasted but a couple of seconds and is really nit picking on my part and barely worth mentioning.  In my opinion, this film's transfer to Blu Ray is most DEMO worthy.The Dolby True HD 5.1 audio defaults to lossy DD 5.1 when the disc is inserted so be sure to go to the audio setup menu first to change it to the lossless audio.  The lesser compression with Dolby True HD really makes a difference for all Blu Rays in terms of clarity and audio transparency.  It would be a hard pick for me to decide whether the audio or video transfer is the star so lets call it a draw.  The audio is great in all areas using both the front and rear sound stages for panning and quite a bit of discreet channeling and directionality for all 5 channels.  The audio also has some of the deepest bass for your LFE sub channel that you will hear on any Blu Ray disc.  This is especially apparent when the hospital blows up.  If your sub is set up correctly and is not set too high so that you hear it as a separate speaker, you will be immersed in some powerful bottom end.  The audio for this film is totally demo worthy.This is certainly a good BluRay to have in your collection and the cost has come down.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,The Dark Knight on Blu Ray-2 discs,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,2686,"['So', 'many', 'have', 'previously', 'analyzed', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'acting', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'will', 'dispense', 'creating', 'redundancy', 'only', 'focus', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'are', 'two', 'discs', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'several', 'extra', 'features', 'showing', 'how', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'created', 'details', 'suit', 'pod', 'designs', 'planning', 'film', '2nd', 'disc', 'very', 'good', 'psychological', 'examination', 'mythology', 'analysis', 'Batman', 'human', 'being', 'displaying', 'commonalities', 'extras', 'were', 'really', 'quite', 'interesting', 'will', 'take', 'special', 'sitting', 'just', 'watch', 'set', 'also', 'came', 'Ultra', 'Violet', 'download', 'can', 'assess', 'computer', 'did', 'not', 'attempt', 'do', 'so', 'however.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'do', 'have', 'film', 'Standard', 'Def', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'video', 'BluRay', 'definitely', 'very', 'strong', 'contrast', 'deep', 'coloration', 'realistic', 'skin', 'tones', 'Even', 'many', 'dark', 'scenes', 'was', 'disturbing', 'grain', 'artifacting', 'one', 'very', 'small', 'problem', 'occurred', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'panning', 'overhead', 'shot', 'Gotham', 'City', 'one', 'vents', 'windows', 'did', 'notice', 'stair', 'stepping', 'lasted', 'couple', 'seconds', 'really', 'nit', 'picking', 'part', 'barely', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'opinion', 'film', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'most', 'DEMO', 'worthy.The', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', '5.1', 'audio', 'defaults', 'lossy', 'DD', '5.1', 'when', 'disc', 'inserted', 'so', 'be', 'sure', 'go', 'audio', 'setup', 'menu', 'first', 'change', 'lossless', 'audio', 'lesser', 'compression', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', 'really', 'difference', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'terms', 'clarity', 'audio', 'transparency', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pick', 'decide', 'audio', 'video', 'transfer', 'star', 'so', 'call', 'draw', 'audio', 'great', 'areas', 'using', 'front', 'rear', 'sound', 'stages', 'panning', 'quite', 'bit', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'directionality', '5', 'channels', 'audio', 'also', 'deepest', 'bass', 'LFE', 'sub', 'channel', 'will', 'hear', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'especially', 'apparent', 'when', 'hospital', 'up', 'sub', 'set', 'up', 'correctly', 'not', 'set', 'too', 'high', 'hear', 'separate', 'speaker', 'will', 'be', 'immersed', 'powerful', 'bottom', 'end', 'audio', 'film', 'totally', 'demo', 'worthy.This', 'certainly', 'good', 'BluRay', 'have', 'collection', 'cost', 'come', 'down.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

660014,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B00005JPY0,Steve,"[1, 3]","This movie looses so much from big screen to small, and it wasn't because I was watching it on a 9"" bedroom model. When I walked out of this movie this past summer, I was truly wowed, wowed like I hadn't been since perhaps Jurassic Park or Saving Private Ryan. Those movies, like this one, were huge rushes of emotions and action and swept you up in their intensity. Watching it at home was fun but it certainly wasn't the same, and in that lowering of excitement, I was able to view it more objectively. That said this movie is still the best of the entire Batman legacy. Then again, I think the original Adam West version is second on the list if only because of the shark scene and the bomb disposal one. Forget the schizophrenic Tim Burton visions or the two follow-ups to his pair. Burton tried too hard to be dark and scary yet couldn't resist the colors and flash of comic books, and the Kilmer and Clooney versions sacrificed all sincerity and gravity at the altar of camp and smugness. The first of these newer Batman movies wasn't bad but it lacked a really great villain. Of all the potential possibilities, we are given an effeminate Scarecrow and a horribly hackneyed mob boss. For criminals to work in the comic book world there has to be a connection between the superhero and the villain. With Spider-Man and Doc Ock, there was the scientist link and the struggle between using brains and/or skills for good or evil. With Batman, there is the damaged orphan who eternally fights his own darker, angrier side and thus the ideal villain is someone who plays up to that turmoil.  Michelle Pfeiffer did a good job engendering some sympathy to go along with her psychosis with her strong turn as Catwoman, but any interplay between the two was undermined by the fatal inclusion of DeVito's disgusting Penguin character and the devotion Burton gives to the inane plot. As the maniacal and insidious Joker, however, Heath Ledger hits it out of the park. Indeed, The Dark Knight succeeds purely on the performance and writing for The Joker character. What makes it so wonderful is that the Joker is a character who cares not for the traditional bad-guy vices: money, power, or fame. He simply wants to inspire chaos for the sheer joy of seeing people devolve to the basest part of our collective human nature.As for the rest of the cast, the one thing that can be said is that they can't carry the movie on their own. Again, that's why Batman Begins was merely okay and not great. I've never been sold on Christian Bale, and his grunting ""in-character"" speech is just silly. With all his high-tech skills, are you telling me he can't rig up some voice augmentation? Please. Michael Caine is good but largely reduced to wise-cracking/wisdom dispensing clich&eacute;, Morgan Freeman is much the same, and Gary Oldham is relatively unspectacular. As for Maggie Gyllenhaal vs. Katie Holmes, what difference does it make? Neither does any more than Kim Basinger, Nicole Kidman, or anyone else in the bland, thankless role as Bruce Wayne/Batman's gal pal. Batman's girl was never as integral to the plot as M.J. or Gwen Stacy is to Peter Parker/Spider-Man, so why waste time with female interests? I actually like Bruce Wayne's skanky playboy vibe, the whole two-gals-at-a-time thang that gives the rather dour character some levity, so why mess with that by trying to create depth? Bruce Wayne is already quite a piece of work who doesn't need a woman to give him demons. He's already chock full of `em. Besides, if I am to believe Batman's ethos, I need to know that he has neither the time nor interest in romance because the world needs saved from itself and there just ain't the time for serious relationships. Love `em and leave `em, Batsy, there's evil to fight.In the end, however, this is a movie about The Joker and how this delectable character, arguably the best villain in comic book history, brings his toxic insanity to full bear on the world of Batman. In the hands of Jack Nicholson, I couldn't stop seeing R.P. McMurphy after a few too many mocha lattes. Nicholson played it so over-the-top that the whole movie sagged under the weight of his wink-wink portrayal. It was so clearly an actor hamming it up in a juicy role rather than something believable. With Ledger, the actor is lost in the character and we see The Joker as the man he is, a raging ""agent of chaos,"" wrapped up in a creepy, wicked leer. The Dark Knight excels because Ledger left us with one bravura swan song, a character portrayal that accomplishes what so few comic book movies have been able to do; transcend the limitations of the comic book and create a character as memorable and frighteningly lovable as Hannibal Lecter or any of the many other great ones in cinematic history. When Nicholson's Joker died at the end of the first of Burton's movies, I was glad because it was a case of good riddance to ham acting. When Heath Ledger laughs in utter joyful mania while dangling from the skyscraper, I was sad because I knew that we'd never again get the chance to see more of this brilliant character in any of the

To my surprise, I ended up loving the experience.There are a number of reasons why I don't usually watch the genre. The characters are often shallow and we don't know their true origin and motivations. Acting is cheesy and deliberately over the top. The need for humor means that I'm likely to be assaulted by childish jokes. The plot is there as an excuse for cool special effects and a lot of action. In short, I don't believe in the characters or the world in which they live.The Dark Knight overcomes all of those problems and delivers something special.The characters are far from shallow. After seeing the movie, I made a point of seeing Batman Begins, in which Nolan shows us how Bruce Wayne became Batman. We see the training that allows him to fight criminals. His wealth enables him to develop weapons, vehicles and protective clothing that could actually exist. The acting is superb and many of the cast are Oscar-winners or nominees. Instead of making The Joker an unbelievable character such as the one depicted by Jack Nicholson in 1989, Nolan and Ledger invent a character who could be walking around in New York or anywhere else. He's psychotic, but we understand his twisted logic. When he makes a threat, we believe that it's possible and that he could pull it off.Nolan's world is totally logical and could easily exist in reality.The Dark Knight has enough thrills and action to satisfy fans of the genre, but it's much more than that. It works as a character study and as a police procedural. It's also a thriller, with elements of romance.If there's one movie that transcends the genre, The Dark Knight is it.",5,The best superhero movie ever made,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,1912,"['Dark', 'Knight', '2008', 'Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', '152', 'minutesDirected', 'Christopher', 'NolanStarring', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Aaron', 'EckhartI', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'superhero', 'movies', 'rule', 'only', 'watched', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'could', 'confirm', 'belief', 'hype', 'was', 'unjustified', 'surprise', 'ended', 'up', 'loving', 'experience.There', 'are', 'number', 'reasons', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'watch', 'genre', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'shallow', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'true', 'origin', 'motivations', 'Acting', 'cheesy', 'deliberately', 'top', 'need', 'humor', ""'m"", 'likely', 'be', 'assaulted', 'childish', 'jokes', 'plot', 'there', 'excuse', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'lot', 'action', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'characters', 'world', 'live.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'problems', 'delivers', 'something', 'special.The', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'shallow', 'seeing', 'movie', 'made', 'point', 'seeing', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Nolan', 'how', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'became', 'Batman', 'see', 'training', 'fight', 'criminals', 'wealth', 'develop', 'weapons', 'vehicles', 'protective', 'clothing', 'could', 'actually', 'exist', 'acting', 'superb', 'many', 'cast', 'are', 'Oscar-winners', 'nominees', 'Instead', 'making', 'Joker', 'unbelievable', 'character', 'such', 'one', 'depicted', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', '1989', 'Nolan', 'Ledger', 'invent', 'character', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'walking', 'around', 'New', 'York', 'anywhere', 'else', 'psychotic', 'understand', 'twisted', 'logic', 'When', 'threat', 'believe', 'possible', 'could', 'pull', 'world', 'totally', 'logical', 'could', 'easily', 'exist', 'reality.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'enough', 'thrills', 'action', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'genre', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'police', 'procedural', 'also', 'thriller', 'elements', 'romance.If', 'one', 'movie', 'genre', 'Dark', 'Knight']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
660016,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,B00005JPY0,Steven A. Peterson,"[3, 9]","I just saw ""The Dark Knight"" today.  What a roller coaster ride! This time around, in the rebirth of the ""Batman"" franchise (which Val Kilmer and George Clooney just about killed off), we have two tortured souls--Batman (Bruce Wayne) and The Joker. The duel between these strange personae defines this movie.A couple questions that readers might have: Was Heath Ledger the real deal as The Joker? Answer: Yes! He may not win an Oscar, but he at least warrants some consideration.  He does more credibly than Jack Nicholson's ""over the top"" portrayal of the same character. Indeed, Nicholson never created a character; Ledger does. Was Christian Bale able to compete with Ledger's characterization? Answer: Yes, at least in my opinion.  Bale is even darker in this movie than in his first effort at portraying Batman.First, the other characters.  Bale and Ledger do well.  Aaron Eckhart as the crusading DA, Harvey Dent, who gives Batman the possibility of withdrawing from his vigilante career, does well, but he is at a lower level in this movie than some of the other actors. His descent to ""Two Face"" is more credible than when Tommy Lee Jones essayed the same character (ugh).  Maggie Gyllenhaal creates a credible Rachel Dawes. Gary Oldman reprises his role as James Gordon. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman do credibly as well.Lots of deaths. Lots of violence.  And it ain't cartoon stuff. There is a hard edge to this movie, with many characters threatened--and a number of those dispatched with extreme prejudice.The plot? Not of great moment.  The Joker tries to muscle in on the crime scene in Gotham City (Chicago gloriously portrays Gotham City--note the river, Marina Towers, and so on and so on).  But he is not so interested in money (watch him burn, with little care, the zillions of dollars in ill gotten gain from the crime bosses); he is more someone who wants to shake things up, a criminal anarchist, if you will. Again, quite a juxtaposition with Jack Nicholson's character.Indeed, the movie has the same problem as the first Batman movie with a Joker--it wanders on too long.  There was a natural close--and then the movie went on an extra 30-45 minutes (I use my cell phone as a watch, and I had to turn it off, so I could not time the extra segment) without really adding all that much. Also, to have a second ""bad guy,"" ""Two Face,"" was probably one more tortured character than we needed.Nonetheless, this is one of the better Batman movies.  The franchise clearly has survived the awful Val Kilmer/George Clooney pieces.",5,Gotham City's Dark Side,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,2547,"['just', 'saw', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'today', 'What', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'time', 'around', 'rebirth', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'George', 'Clooney', 'just', 'about', 'killed', 'off', 'have', 'two', 'tortured', 'souls', 'Batman', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Joker', 'duel', 'strange', 'personae', 'defines', 'movie.A', 'couple', 'questions', 'readers', 'might', 'have', 'Was', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'real', 'deal', 'Joker', 'Answer', 'Yes', 'may', 'not', 'win', 'Oscar', 'least', 'warrants', 'consideration', 'more', 'credibly', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'top', 'portrayal', 'same', 'character', 'Indeed', 'Nicholson', 'never', 'created', 'character', 'Ledger', 'Was', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'able', 'compete', 'Ledger', 'characterization', 'Answer', 'Yes', 'least', 'opinion', 'Bale', 'even', 'darker', 'movie', 'first', 'effort', 'portraying', 'Batman.First', 'other', 'characters', 'Bale', 'Ledger', 'do', 'well', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'crusading', 'DA', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'who', 'Batman', 'possibility', 'withdrawing', 'vigilante', 'career', 'well', 'lower', 'level', 'movie', 'other', 'actors', 'descent', 'Two', 'Face', 'more', 'credible', 'when', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'essayed', 'same', 'character', 'ugh', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'credible', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'role', 'James', 'Gordon', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'do', 'credibly', 'well.Lots', 'deaths', 'Lots', 'violence', 'ai', ""n't"", 'cartoon', 'stuff', 'hard', 'edge', 'movie', 'many', 'characters', 'threatened', 'number', 'dispatched', 'extreme', 'prejudice.The', 'plot', 'Not', 'great', 'moment', 'Joker', 'muscle', 'crime', 'scene', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Chicago', 'gloriously', 'Gotham', 'City', 'note', 'river', 'Marina', 'Towers', 'so', 'so', 'not', 'so', 'interested', 'money', 'watch', 'burn', 'little', 'care', 'zillions', 'dollars', 'ill', 'gotten', 'gain', 'crime', 'bosses', 'more', 'someone', 'who', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'criminal', 'anarchist', 'will', 'Again', 'quite', 'juxtaposition', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character.Indeed', 'movie', 'same', 'problem', 'first', 'Batman', 'movie', 'Joker', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'natural', 'close', 'then', 'movie', 'went', 'extra', '30-45', 'minutes', 'use', 'cell', 'phone', 'watch', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'could', 'not', 'time', 'extra', 'segment', 'really', 'adding', 'much', 'Also', 'have', 'second', 'bad', 'guy', 'Two', 'Face', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'tortured', 'character', 'needed.Nonetheless', 'one', 'better', 'Batman', 'movies', 'franchise', 'clearly', 'survived', 'awful', 'Val', 'Kilmer/George', 'Clooney', 'pieces']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
660017,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B00005JPY0,Steven Hancock,"[1, 4]","Christopher Nolan's much-hyped follow-up to ""Batman Begins,"" ""The Dark Knight"" is a rousing, action-packed and emotionally exhilarating sequel, filled with twists and surprises that few will see coming.The acting is fantastic. Once again, Christian Bale proves that he IS Batman, and gives him further emotional depth in this film. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman return from the first film, and give terrific performances as well.Maggie Gyllenhaal, who replaces Katie Holmes as Rachel, does a good job, though she tries too hard to be like Katie, and doesn't bring too much new to the table. Aaron Eckhart is fantastic as Harvey Dent, and his transformation to Two-Face is handled perfectly. But the best performance in the movie is, you guessed it, Heath Ledger as the Joker. He brings a truly menacing, psychopathic presence to the character, bringing just the right amount of humor to make him fascinating. Ledger's performance is truly terrifying, showing the talent he truly had, and makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like a stupid clown.But, does all this mean that it's a better film that ""Begins?"" For me, it is a great sequel, but isn't as good as the previous entry. There are a few moments where the film tends to drag. They could have edited out an additional five to ten minutes without losing much. Also, I feel that Harvey Dent/Two-Face was a great character; there was no need to kill him off at the end. But these two drawbacks are minor, and the terrific writing and fantastic performances make up for it immensely.

660018,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JPY0,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[8, 11]","""The Dark Knight"" is arguably the very best comic book hero film of all time.  I used to think it wasSpider-Man 2, but no longer.The storyline, in brief, is that Bruce Wayne, AKA Batman and played with great depth by Christian Bale, sees that his goal of having citizens be hero's themselves and combat injustice is fulfilled in the newest District Attorney Harvey Dent, convincingly played by Aaron Eckhart, and now considers Batman's run against injustice to be near an end.  Wayne hopes it isn't too late for him and Rachel Dawes, formerly played by Katie Holmes and replaced by the far better actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, but she's near to being committed to Dent and has pretty much given up on a relationship with Wayne.Well, Dent, considering himself something of an intellectual ""untouchable"" aims to bring down the mob and to do so with limited use of Batman whom he does not trust and wisely warns may become the villain himself one day.  Dent hands down the law and the crap hits the fan quickly.  The new leader of the mob is Salvatore Maroni who is played to the slimy hilt by Eric Roberts (Julia's troubled brother) appears to be about to take a big fall when the Joker, Heath Ledger's last and probably best performance of his career, comes on board just to create anarchy for fun.  His Joker is far more evil and interesting than Nicholson's brilliant, but at times over-the-top performance in Tim Burton'sBatmanwhich while dark, atmospheric and a slam bang good time, was also rather comic book in style whereas Nolan's two Batman films seem to strive for more realism while exploring the psychology of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The rest of the reliable cast fromBatman Beginsreturn for this installment.  Gary Oldman returns as Gordon in a much meatier role than his last outing, while both Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine return to their roles as Lucius Fox, Wayne's humorous gadget man, and Alfred, the wise butler, but in smaller roles this time around, but no less forgettable or supportive.Christopher Nolan's latest entry into the Batman franchise is flawless.  He wisely focuses on his characters, even the smallest supporting ones, and is merciful in his limited use of CGI effects.  In addition, his script is nothing less than brilliant and is the best written of any super hero film I have ever seen.  Bale gives an Oscar nomination worthy performance, as does Oldman in his supporting role.  Naturally, much attention goes to Heath Ledger's Joker.  This is the best written villain I've seen in a comic book film and Ledger is destined for an Oscar nod if not an all out win for his last performance and it will NOT be out of pity over his untimely death, but because he is truly brilliant in this role that has no back story at all.  The joker himself changes the reasons for his scars every time he tells someone how he got them.  Perhaps it is because it doesn't matter as his scars are only a reflection of the scarred soul he so proudly hails as only wanting chaos for the fun of it.This film lives up to all of the hype it received and is, in fact, even better than the hype.  I was floored by how good this film is and although some may laugh at the next comment I make, I do stand by it:  This film is positively worth a nomination for Best Picture and nods should also go to Nolan as director and screenwriter as well as the various actors I mentioned earlier.

Not only is the movie one of the best super hero movies ever, it is also one of the best movies I have ever seen.  And wouldn't you know it, the very actor that made this movie such a thrill ride has, to my sincere sadness, has passed on.  What a character and a film to go out on though.  If Heath was here today he would become the new golden boy in hollywood.  I never cared for Heath or most of his movies.  He's always shown himself to be a great actor but now, after watching him as the joker, I must say he has proven brilliant and oscar bound.  Funny enough, his death had nothing to do with the fact that his portrayal of the joker surpasses all of my favorite movie characters of all time including Jack Sparrow, John McClane, Sgt. Dignum, ect.  It may have drawn people in to come see it, but when the crowd walks out of this movie they will find themselves ""joker"" fans or even Heath Ledger fans, and will not even think about his death.  Although Heathe is gone, in a miraculous way, his last character will never die and will be remembered and watched forever.  Sorry Mr. Nicholson, you're one of my favorite actors but you are no longer the joker.  As you can see I have mentioned nothing of all of the other actors including Christian Bale.  Well that is because the show was stolen by the villian.  Everyone does fantastically and the joker is out of this world brilliant and captivating.

660020,AYKM1B74OLEVC,B00005JPY0,Story Charts,"[0, 0]","The Dark Knight is the crown jewel of Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy. It is a story that is leaps and bounds ahead of average Batman Begins and not even from the planet as the garbage The Dark Knight Rises.The Dark Knight is about the same idea as Batman Begins. The idea that justice trumps vengeance. The Dark Knight takes this idea to extremes to suggest that justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs. It demonstrates this idea with the main plot of Save Gotham's Soul. This is supported by an internal plot that takes place within Harvey Dent, his seeking of revenge or justice, which is irreversibly broken when the Joker kills his girlfriend Rachel. Joker's actions ruins Harvey and Rachel's chance at love and sets Dent on the path to destruction. Finally, Batman is not only the main driver of fights to save Gotham, he also sacrifices his reputation to Save Gotham's Soul. Thus, the idea that justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs is demonstrated. Justice as an ideal must be protected even with Rachel's death, with Dent's false hero status, and with Batman giving up his reputation.It's a great story and a triumph of movie making in the age of fluff and crap.

Patchin,"[7, 9]","What follows read like CliffsNotes from Michael Mann's filmography: with the hero caught in a love triangle the mob hires a dangerous psychopath to bump off public officials and turn it's DA into an instrument of revenge. As a whole it's convoluted, pedantic and uncharacteristic of ever having been Batman. Christian Bale's reprisal of the character is unsympathetically wooden, a hero ready to throw in the towel at the first hint of unpopularity (as opposed to an unrelenting crusader). Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is dumbed down to a plot point leaving the notion that anybody set on fire with murdered loved ones will become a raving lunatic (as opposed to deep-seeded demons being the cause). And while Ledger's Joker is indeed brilliant it's no help to Christopher Nolan who does his best to turn him into a run-of-the-mill psychopath.Nolan has never cared for pathos. In fact any there is he attempts to beat you over the head with as a tired cops & robbers epic. Arkham Asylum is never mentioned in the sequel because Nolan & Co. don't like a villain that when accused of being crazy simply boasts, ""Gloriously so!"" They'd rather not explore the underbelly of madness that Gotham attracts nor have The World's Greatest Detective do any detecting. Nolan's at a loss: as long as ethnic mafiosa stereotypes are sneering at the camera he's happy. The Gotham City here is the most gullible metropolis in America, jumping at the idlest of threats and driven to murder with a mere phone call.What story conveyed weaves along from impossible circumstance to impossible circumstance bordering on character omnipotence. Sad too that Ledger's Joker drives that plot to nowhere and, with what little screentime he's given, is still the only likable character in the movie. His is a villain so cunning and grounded you realize not only could this Batman never beat him but he's the only character that knows what's going on.",3,The Subtle Summer Blockbuster,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,1920,"['What', 'read', 'CliffsNotes', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'filmography', 'hero', 'caught', 'love', 'triangle', 'mob', 'dangerous', 'psychopath', 'bump', 'off', 'public', 'officials', 'turn', 'DA', 'instrument', 'revenge', 'whole', 'convoluted', 'pedantic', 'uncharacteristic', 'ever', 'having', 'been', 'Batman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'reprisal', 'character', 'unsympathetically', 'wooden', 'hero', 'ready', 'throw', 'towel', 'first', 'hint', 'unpopularity', 'opposed', 'unrelenting', 'crusader', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'dumbed', 'down', 'plot', 'point', 'leaving', 'notion', 'anybody', 'set', 'fire', 'murdered', 'loved', 'ones', 'will', 'become', 'raving', 'lunatic', 'opposed', 'deep-seeded', 'demons', 'being', 'cause', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'indeed', 'brilliant', 'help', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'who', 'best', 'turn', 'run-of-the-mill', 'psychopath.Nolan', 'never', 'cared', 'pathos', 'fact', 'beat', 'head', 'tired', 'cops', 'robbers', 'epic', 'Arkham', 'Asylum', 'never', 'mentioned', 'sequel', 'Nolan', 'Co.', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'villain', 'when', 'accused', 'being', 'crazy', 'simply', 'Gloriously', 'so', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'explore', 'underbelly', 'madness', 'Gotham', 'attracts', 'have', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Detective', 'do', 'detecting', 'Nolan', 'loss', 'as', 'long', 'ethnic', 'mafiosa', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'sneering', 'camera', 'happy', 'Gotham', 'City', 'here', 'most', 'gullible', 'metropolis', 'America', 'jumping', 'idlest', 'threats', 'driven', 'murder', 'mere', 'phone', 'call.What', 'story', 'conveyed', 'weaves', 'impossible', 'circumstance', 'impossible', 'circumstance', 'bordering', 'character', 'omnipotence', 'Sad', 'too', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'plot', 'nowhere', 'what', 'little', 'screentime', 'given', 'still', 'only', 'likable', 'character', 'movie', 'villain', 'so', 'cunning', 'grounded', 'realize', 'not', 'only', 'could', 'Batman', 'never', 'beat', 'only', 'character', 'what', 'going']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

(or Canada for that matter, because at times, I would have swore that Toronto, Ontario, was standing in for Gotham City) the cops all look like any cops off of TV, as do the henchmen, with the exception of the Joker and his grease painted face (which, like I mentioned before, stands out like a sore thumb in this world, and not for the right reasons either).You see, when I go to see a Batman movie, I want to feel like I'm living in the comic book world of Batman and his Gotham City, for the 120 or so minutes that I'm there, I don't want to feel like I'm looking at stuff happening in my own world (like I said, TV does a more than adequate job of that, with shows like CSI, Law and Order, etc.) but sadly, that's what this movie only seems to aspire to, trying to make Batman and the Joker fit into our world instead of creating a world that they fit into.Also, for some reason in this film, it was decided that anytime Batman spoke, no matter that it be to Gordon, Rachel or a crook, that his voice have this, ""Nails on a Chalkboard"" kind of electronic vocal enhancement, added to his already gruffly whispered voice, which made listening to him talk, almost unbearable.As well, the sound effects guy must have gone in after the initial sound mix had been done, and over tweaked his sound effects, because there are a lot of instances during the film, where I was franticly trying to hit the, ""Subtitle"" button on my remote, only to remember that this was a theater, and not equipped with such conveniences (oh, and in case you're wondering about the status of my hearing, I have to where ear plugs at concerts because it is so acute, and even then, I can still hear every note being played, and further more, my wife complained of the same thing after the film).So in closing, it's an okay movie, but a not so great comic book inspired film (I'll take Tim Burton's flawed but stylistic vision of the caped crusader, over this new incarnation of the dark knight, any day).",3,"BATMAN MOVIE TURNED INTO A MAINSTREAM CRIME DRAMA (EXCEPT FOR THE GUY IN A CAPE, AND THE GUY WEARING GREASE PAINT)",1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,2746,"['Yep', 'right', 'took', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', 'turned', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', '.First', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'indeed', 'make', 'outstanding', 'psychotic', 'bad', 'guy', 'actuality', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'make-up', 'sadly', 'where', 'movie', 'failed', 'him.Because', 'see', 'movie', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'mainstream', 'crime', 'drama', 'distance', 'beginning', 'comic', 'book', 'Heath', 'Joker', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'seem', 'place', 'pretty', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'accomplish', 'roles', 'costuming.Gone', 'sense', 'comic', 'book', 'stylization', 'replaced', 'instead', 'mundaneness', 'crime', 'drama', 'TV', 'show', 'where', 'city', 'city', 'U.S.A.', 'Canada', 'matter', 'because', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'swore', 'Toronto', 'Ontario', 'was', 'standing', 'Gotham', 'City', 'cops', 'look', 'cops', 'TV', 'do', 'henchmen', 'exception', 'Joker', 'grease', 'painted', 'face', 'mentioned', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'world', 'not', 'right', 'reasons', '.You', 'see', 'when', 'go', 'see', 'Batman', 'movie', 'want', 'feel', ""'m"", 'living', 'comic', 'book', 'world', 'Batman', 'Gotham', 'City', '120', 'so', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'feel', ""'m"", 'looking', 'stuff', 'happening', 'own', 'world', 'said', 'TV', 'more', 'adequate', 'job', 'shows', 'CSI', 'Law', 'Order', 'etc', 'sadly', 'what', 'movie', 'only', 'aspire', 'trying', 'make', 'Batman', 'Joker', 'fit', 'world', 'instead', 'creating', 'world', 'fit', 'into.Also', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'decided', 'anytime', 'Batman', 'spoke', 'matter', 'be', 'Gordon', 'Rachel', 'crook', 'voice', 'have', 'Nails', 'Chalkboard', 'kind', 'electronic', 'vocal', 'enhancement', 'added', 'already', 'gruffly', 'whispered', 'voice', 'made', 'listening', 'talk', 'almost', 'unbearable.As', 'well', 'sound', 'effects', 'guy', 'must', 'have', 'gone', 'initial', 'sound', 'mix', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'tweaked', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'lot', 'instances', 'film', 'where', 'was', 'franticly', 'trying', 'hit', 'Subtitle', 'button', 'remote', 'only', 'remember', 'was', 'theater', 'not', 'equipped', 'such', 'conveniences', 'oh', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'status', 'hearing', 'have', 'where', 'ear', 'plugs', 'concerts', 'so', 'acute', 'even', 'then', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'note', 'being', 'played', 'further', 'more', 'wife', 'complained', 'same', 'thing', 'film', '.So', 'closing', 'okay', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'comic', 'book', 'inspired', 'film', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'flawed', 'stylistic', 'vision', 'caped', 'crusader', 'new', 'incarnation', 'dark', 'knight', 'day']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

I have been following this film ever since Lt. Gordon pulled out that fateful card at the end of a brilliant ""Batman Begins"". Following this trail has been a 3 year affair and as a die hard Batman Fan(atic), I was actually more nervous than excited at the prospect of finally seeing this film. On hand I knew that Christopher Nolan and ""Cast & Crew"" wouldn't really muck it up but on the other, it takes one greedy studio executive with an ego to decide the fate of the product delivered...thankfully, that was not the case!!From the 1st trailer to the 2nd to the 3rd, the prospect of this film making history becomes more and more apparent. As for the marketing, to have one half of perfectly sane people paint their faces and parade around town in the guise of lunacy coupled with the other half campaigning in their city's for a non existent District Attorney is nothing short of  PURE GENIUS! The Viral Campaign (which I followed closely too) made the film all the more intriguing and by the time 18th July '08 came, a final question was still lingering in my mind: Would The Dark Knight live up to the Hype?To my luck and too my wishes, The Dark Knight Crushed! The filmmaking was Grade ""A"", the story (which filmmakers have a tendency to go overboard with sequels) was the finest balance that could have been struck between comic and film, the actors were nothing short of amazing and most importantly the product on the whole delivered 100%30 seconds (literally) into the movie, I knew I was in for the ride of my life and by the end credits, I was ready to go on this ride for the second time.Heath Ledger's Joker shone, just as Christian Bale's Batman did in Batman Begins (and in The Dark Knight for that matter) There are no words that can fully express the magnitude of his performance, but I will say this in a staunchly heterosexual way: ""I couldn't get my eyes off The Joker."" Aaron Eckhart was superb in portraying Harvey Dent's tragic struggle with duality. The physical scarring looks Dead On! (no pink paint this time round thankfully) Maggie Gyllenhaal made a much better Rachael Dawes the Katie Holmes, probably comes largely from the fact that the character itself is not superfluous like she was in the last one. Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman do tend to make anything look good and this was no exception .A special thanks to Gary Oldman for giving me The Commissioner I've always wanted to see done right. Watching him play Gordan page for page is nothing short of raw pleasure.To the filmmakers, rather than merely supporting their film to the hilt (which I am as you can see) I really would like to genuinely thank Christopher Nolan and Crew for giving me 2 of the greatest films I've seen and for literally bringing Batman's Universe to life.

First an introduction for newcomers, then ""The dark knight"", ok?- Introduction for newcomers:Since Tim Burton took one of the most famed superhero sagas and masterfully portrayed the nocturnal atmosphere in a well-balanced comic book transcription to cinema back in 1989, his stunning and stylised vision and concept including the bleak and soaring urban waystelands, and the somber super-human vigilante dressed in the best accomplished design for the legendary bat-suit till date, degenerated in Joel Schumacher's colorful, fanciful toy-store fantasy, a desperate all-senses barrage of cheap stimulations that no serious fan could bear. Since dignity was not an issue for that last lame effort that destroyed the audiences's interest in the saga raised with love and effort by Mr. Burton, Schumacher's annoying mass-oriented disaster did ended the industry's attention in the continuity of the diffuse and declining Batman series. And nobody complained about it, for obvious reasons.Christopher Nolan's cerebral style, full of intensity and focus towards the psychology of his tormented and demented characters, didn't seemed like an expected choice for the directing of the awaited return of the dark cape crusader to theaters in 2005. His previous masterpiece ""Memento"", a gem of intellectual originality, showed him in a whole different filmic category, for some a higher level away from comic book paraphernalia. However the results were astonishing: As a true visionary, Nolan didn't continue neither improved the previous crippled franchise, but resurrected and  reintroduced with stunning originality and talent, the legacy of Batman unto audiences again. Though the new design was a little bit jarring, Nolan and writer David Goyer turned their backs to Burton's more compact, comfortable direct transcription and created a melancholic dark universe ruled by an angry mean millionaire crimefighter, played to perfection by gifted actor Christian Bale. The detailed, dramatic but interesting evolution of the classic character portrayed on ""Batman begins"" along with the incredible imaginative script and full action sequences, ranks among the most compelling scenes ever filmed for this sub-genre, giving to DC comics the worthy outing to compete with the  more effective Marvel adaptations on screen.- The Dark Knight review (no spoilers):This sequel of the solid previous outing, is by all means the consolidation of Nolan's new, better, more in-depth portrayal of the legend and graphic myth of Batman. Glorious in its perfect detailed approach of the new dark paralel universe named Gotham City, outstanding in the search for strong emotions trought the focus on the double life and inner struggle of the haunted-by-the-past superhero, relentless in the conceptualization of violence and demented fear inflicted by the new and more psychotic than ever Joker, who turns out to be the closest more effective representation of the character's true essence: the macabre contradiction between goofy circus-humor and pure evil homicidal schizophrenia. A true sociopathic sense of humor about loving mayhem.Nolan's design concepts continue to provoque the classic fans, going against the old adopted previous stereotypes. Costume design moved forward, but Heath Ledger's goulishly and gleeful makeup style annoyed more than one. But the truth is that Batman's nemesis is in top form, inspired, stronger and more disturbingly sinister than any other known representation, including Mr Nicholson's over the top performance. The scar-faced epileptic buffoon lives outside the Joker costume, wearing his make-up as a battle flag, declaring his inner insane purposes as values of life: Total Chaos.It's proven that changing actors for the same role is not recommended, but Maggie Gyllenhaal taking over Rachel Dawes's  character from Katie Holmes was almost a good idea. The introduction of district attorney Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart) was an unexpected benefit for the whole plot, bringing coherency and dramatic sense of irony to the development of the movie.The story is not extremely complicated but full of interesting twists among the obvious advance to the final comfrontation, the battle between good and evil, with a catastrophic scenario of Gotham city turned into a battlefield of raging gangs and maniacal criminals. The performances of Christian Bale (the disguise and fake voice tend to cancel his great effort) and Gary Oldman are Amazing as usual, and the action is restless, when the tireless war against the hordes of  violent antisocials turn the streets of Gotham City into complete chaos. This movie fills the expectations in every possible way, giving the viewer a complete, gritty and astonishing ride into the phenomenal world of the Dark Knight and his quest for order and vengeance. And let's not forget the amazing grandiose music score, covering every important scene with a sonic layer of epic proportions. An orchestra of darkness.- APPRECIATION 1: In Tim Burton's cartoonish version, the use of heavy machinery and artillery, call it high-tech vehicles like armored cars, jets, boats equiped with machine guns and missiles, seemed admirable and visually spectacular. In Nolan's more realistic self-justified version where action and substance require a little bit more explanation, a superhero who don't kill but stun his enemies with martial arts techniques and uses fear as a primary weapon, never lets technology eclipse the main figure. The original simplicity and effectiveness of the original concept,the dark bat silhouette terrifing criminals with a haunting music score, prevails with great balance in that matter. After all, tools are only that, a mean to a purpose, no further function but the benefit of a great tech-show.-APRECIATION 2: The first movie was about the birth and evolution of batman in both physical and spiritual ways, it was about growth and the overcoming of fear and fear itself (scarecrow, bruce wayne and bats, etc,). There were powerful concepts behind the expected action movie. This movie is more about Batman and the Joker and pushing the limits of each character, the portrayal of an epic battle in wich parallel stories don't loose importance, cause there's no ramifications in the straight forward solid plot. Humanity is essential to accomplish deepness of characters and realism in the situations, in order to drag the audiences into magnified but serious events. That's why Nolan didn't choose mutants between Batman's enemies but people on the edge like the main character, astonishing visuals are just a consequence of behaviour, of logic or emotional choices, and that's the goal here: Aproach, empathy, the stuff that makes a movie an experience beyond senses.Having saying everything without telling nothing, i suggest you run to your local theather to see for yourselves. Your money's worth is guaranteed, no doubt. SPECTACULAR viewing, in every single possible aspect. Nolan's ingenious, artful but prudent use of the camera in big and small takes is amazing, such effectiveness turns every situation and place into an event to behold.Missing half star? Nolan's best is still to come, and believe it or not, he didn't played his entire game. I like to think the next chapter will be a flawless, complete achievement. But make no mistake: This movie is beyond a superhero movie, an absolute standard breaker.",4,The consolidation of Nolan's injected majesty to the saga.,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,7617,"['4.5',

660030,AHL3ES7DCWZJC,B00005JPY0,TaRan,"[2, 4]","This is one of my favorite movies. The acting in The Dark Knight is magnificent. Christian Bale plays the best Batman next to Adam West and Michael Keaton (and he was definitely the best choice for the ""dark knight"" batman). But as good as Bale is, he doesn't compare to the scary good role Heath Ledger plays as the Joker.When I first heard that The Dark Knight was going to reprise the role of the Joker, I was a bit upset. In my mind, no one could top the wonderful job that Jack Nicholson did in the original Batman. However after seeing the movie, I quickly changed my mind and gained a whole new respect for Ledger as an actor. The two Jokers are quite different (as are the Batmans).The movie itself is great. It's entertaining and will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.

The one thing I liked about the original Michael Keaton version is how dark it was. Not like all the violence or killings in this one but the atmosphere the original had. Like the two muggers counting out cash on the roof and the one is nervous about the Bat and didn't feel safe being up there. The new batman just comes off like some guy dressed in a costume when the original the bad guys didn't know what he was and were afraid. None of these bad guys seem nervous about The Bat in this one other than the fact they just don't want to go to jail or lose money. Not to mention this new joker doesn't really even joke or hardly laugh. He has no joke gadgets like flowers that spray acid or giant handguns. He just seemed like your average lunatic but not really even trying to be funny. This one seems to try too hard to be realistic about a guy dressed as bat fighting crime.

660041,A2ICYTQK3ZCX0Z,B00005JPY0,The Great Rocky Hill,"[4, 6]","...that hasn't already been said, but I won't back down from the challenge.I saw it last Sunday. It's breaking box-office records. It is THE summertime smash everyone thought it would be. Which is interesting considering how thoroughly in love with the dark it is.If you told me ten years ago that teen heart throb Heath Ledger would play the Joker and in doing so haunt me with that performance for the rest of my life, I would say that you were on LSD.I guess the word that keeps coming up for me is...haunting. There are so many ghosts surrounding this movie all due to Heath Ledger's untimely passing. I hate to say it, but the fact that Ledger died shortly after making this movie adds something to it. Ledger's Joker is Sid Vicious meets Euronymous. Rather than linger, he explodes, and while you know by film's end that The Joker is still alive, there's still a finality to it all. Who else could play The Joker now? Who else could trump Ledger's anarchist take on this character? Ledger, I believe took The Joker to his grave with him.Insanity is another word that easily comes to mind. What takes someone over the edge? What keeps someone from falling into that abyss? Christian Bale's leading role in American Psycho is recalled here somewhat. You see the duality between Bruce Wayne and Batman as much as you do the two Patrick Batemans. Aristocrat and Demon, except in The Dark Knight, that Demon is pushed into being a force of right in what is in many ways a Hell On Earth (Gotham City) with the leash of conscience holding him from the brink.The twisted Joker/Batman comedian/straight man relationship is also sweepingly explored here. You are left with the impression that all involved in making this film were inspired by modern tales such as Moore and Bolland's classic Batman graphic novel The Killing Joke, in which all buffoonery is further extinguished when it comes to The Joker, and the somewhat perverse relationship between villian and hero is examined. Your laughter is a nervous one, because you just don't know what act of swift, shocking, violent cunning awaits you. The Dark Knight thusly becomes as much a horror or psychological thriller as it is a heroic fantasy swathed in dusk, both figurative and literal. More than ever in any media aside from the comic book realm, we are shown how heroes and villians define each other. Who defines you? Who is your opposite number? What do you stand for, and who stands against that? Do we need enemies? Do we need them in order to show us who we are and what we need to be and do? Or are we not all that different than our foes? What keeps Batman, and all decent men and women from succumbing to The Joker's manic nihilism?As far as the film itself, there were a few things I didn't like. For example...*Some of the fight scenes are disappointing and hard to follow and the makers could and should have taken some lessons from the comics in that area.*As brilliant as Ledger's Joker is, I kept hoping for an even more maniacal performance. A really sinister laugh, REALLY depraved, would have sent the film deeper into the netherworld. I was almost redirecting Ledger in my head at times as I felt that he may have been ever so slightly holding back. I wanted to see that punk/black metalist inside of The Joker just scream and let it all out. Again Ledger's performance is frighteningly sublime, but I kept wanting Alice Cooper on heroin, and we almost got that. It was far different than Jack Nicholson's equally good gentleman Joker from nearly 20 years ago, and I wanted to see that kind of reinvention, but in my opinion, there was something very minute even unnameable missing. Spasticity perhaps? Would that have been too over the top? Had Heath Ledger survived, would his Joker still torment our imagination? Would he still be that bogeyman?*While Ledger's performance, and it could just be me, seemed just a touch restrained, I did feel that at certain points Christian Bale tried too hard to be demonic, his growl even making me wince here and there because it seemed forced. As a long time follower of the Batman mythos, I am aware of how Bruce Wayne alters his voice when in the cape and cowl. However, and again it was just in certain spots, and I can see where Bale was coming from in his portrayal and what discomforts he had to endure, but I felt that he overacted. Some of his lines as Batman sounded as if they were voiced by a pro wrestler.*The Batman headgear wasn't totally to my liking. The hood was too round I thought. When you see Batman up close, he looks slightly silly to my eyes. I also think the eyes should have been covered by clear lenses as they are in the comics. I didn't like seeing the black makeup around the eye.*It may seem like a logical extension, but I really don't like seeing a gliding Batman. It's too obvious.*Do we need another dead female love interest?*I'm not totally sure I liked the makeup running off of the Joker like it did. I prefer the chemically defaced Joker, although I did like that his origin was kept ambiguous and rooted in a brutal, abusive reality.But I nitpick. Is it the purist in me complaining?All of the performances range from good to absolutely superb and Ledger's and Bale's tiny missteps (Is it just me?) are made up for through their respective skills and conviction. The script, the direction, the cinematography, and the special effects all conspire to captivate the viewer with a gloomy, occult grandeur.The Dark Knight is about a lunatic who wallows in and embraces his psychosis and the Grim Hunter who desperately tries not to fall off of the cliff himself while in pursuit. It's about one man who has nothing to lose versus one who has lost everything, gotten it all back, and doesn't want to lose it again; one man who doesn't care at all versus one man who almost cares too much, who carries the weight of his own swarthy, nearly irredeemable world upon his armoured shoulders.Evil vs. Good, Chaos vs. Order, Sanity vs. Madness, it's all here in spades and is what makes The Dark Knight such a magnificent cinematic feast.Thank you Heath. You have given us a career finale that I doubt will ever be rivaled. Thank you for this last gift, one that will continue to haunt us all for generations.",5,I can't think of what to say about The Dark Knight...,1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,6255,"[""n't"", 'already',

It continues the ultra gritty Batman reboot and is the 2nd entry in a trilogy. It is a powerhouse and arguably the best installment in the series.  The first film was titled Batman Begins and chronicled the origins of the caped crusader and his various adventures sweeping the crime ridden streets of Gotham City.  The Dark Knight quickens the pace and takes the story even further in depth.  Christopher Nolen did an excellent job creating a Batman presentation that seems very realistic.  THe story appears to follow the Batman comic legend very well.  There are many excellent actors that returned for this film and there was also a few characters introduced.  The true twist introduced in The Dark Knight is the Joker played by Heath Ledger.  The introduction of this character set the stage for a simple premise: The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and Batman is trying to protect it.  This very simple and straight to the point plot is driven to classic film heights with the likes of Christian Bale & Health Ledger battling it out for true comic book character actor supremacy.  The Joker brought a unique brand of pure danger & energy to the big screen that is rarely seen. This character essentially became a cult film figure overnight. The Dark Knight is really a true blockbuster film. It is entertaining, unsettling, and intriguing all at once.  Health Ledger will always be remembered for stepping into this world and playing the classic Joker role with the conviction & dedication.  This film was a high order success and a worthwhile venture into the heart of Gotham City.You... you just couldn't let me go could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. You are truly incorruptable aren't you. You won't kill me because of some misplaced sense of self-rightousness. And I won't kill you because...you're just too much fun. I get the feeling that you and I are destined to do this forever. - The Joker.",5,The Empire 5 Star 500 - #131,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2078,"['Does', 'villan', 'need', 'motive', 'Dark', 'Knight', '2008', 'film', 'directed', 'produced', 'co-written', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'ultra', 'gritty', 'Batman', 'reboot', '2nd', 'entry', 'trilogy', 'powerhouse', 'arguably', 'best', 'installment', 'series', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'titled', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'chronicled', 'origins', 'caped', 'crusader', 'various', 'adventures', 'sweeping', 'crime', 'ridden', 'streets', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'pace', 'story', 'even', 'further', 'depth', 'Christopher', 'Nolen', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'creating', 'Batman', 'presentation', 'very', 'realistic', 'THe', 'story', 'follow', 'Batman', 'comic', 'legend', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'many', 'excellent', 'actors', 'returned', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'few', 'characters', 'introduced', 'true', 'twist', 'introduced', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Joker', 'played', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'introduction', 'character', 'set', 'stage', 'simple', 'premise', 'Joker', 'trying', 'destroy', 'Gotham', 'Batman', 'trying', 'protect', 'very', 'simple', 'straight', 'point', 'plot', 'driven', 'classic', 'film', 'heights', 'likes', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Health', 'Ledger', 'battling', 'out', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'actor', 'supremacy', 'Joker', 'brought', 'unique', 'brand', 'pure', 'danger', 'energy', 'big', 'screen', 'rarely', 'seen', 'character', 'essentially', 'became', 'cult', 'film', 'figure', 'overnight', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'really', 'true', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'entertaining', 'unsettling', 'intriguing', 'once', 'Health', 'Ledger', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'stepping', 'world', 'playing', 'classic', 'Joker', 'role', 'conviction', 'dedication', 'film', 'was', 'high', 'order', 'success', 'worthwhile', 'venture', 'heart', 'Gotham', 'City.You', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'could', 'what', 'when', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'meets', 'immovable', 'object', 'are', 'truly', 'incorruptable', 'are', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'kill', 'misplaced', 'sense', 'self-rightousness', 'wo', ""n't"", 'kill', ""'re"", 'just', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'destined', 'do', 'forever', 'Joker']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
660043,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JPY0,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[7, 16]","Electrifyingly darker than even Tim Burton's original vision, Batman: The Dark Knight is certainly no family film. Packed with explosive action, heavy-hitting violence, and diabolical maniacs, the masked vigilante has never looked or felt more intense. But despite the many attempts at seriousness, realism still evades the Dark Knight, as inexplicable technology comes to the rescue and a jarring lack of security allows villains to plot elaborate schemes. And despite a flawless performance by Heath Ledger as Batman's archrival The Joker, the film weakens as Two-Face steals screen time from what was plenty enough mayhem for a single superhero.The gangsters who run the underworld of Gotham City are continually under the scrutiny of the mysterious vigilante Batman (Christian Bale). Aided by a new district attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and his lawyer girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the town begins to crack down on organized crime, forcing the mobsters to turn to extreme measures. And that's when they let the clown out of the box.A horribly disfigured psychotic masochist who dons face paint and a purple suit, known as The Joker (Heath Ledger), hires himself out to the warring gangs to dispose of Batman. But in his attempts to kill the pesky vigilante hero, he proves uncontrollable and unstable, and continues to spread panic and pandemonium through the streets of Gotham. Firstly targeting everyone close to Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), The Joker terrorizes the city with explosives and death, and proves to everyone that he is absolutely not a laughing matter.And indeed, the most impressive aspect of The Dark Knight is Heath Ledger's performance. Made up with a truly sinister appearance, including hideous scars and devilish clown makeup, the film wastes no time with giving this notorious antagonist a backstory. Opening with a bank robbery scene that rivals the intensity in Heat's unforgettable holdup, Dark Knight leaps right into the action and rarely lets up. Despite the comic relief provided by Michael Caine's Alfred and Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox, the film stays deadly serious so much of the time that it's difficult to see any light at the end of the tunnel.The unrelentingly baleful tone of the film makes The Dark Knight a perfect match to Batman Begins, and a real treat for fans itching for stark realism; but much of the over-the-top fun of the character has altogether vanished. It is no longer friendly for younger audiences. But despite the severe switch in target audiences, adults may find themselves questioning the ease with which The Joker is able to move around the city, plant bombs, and avoid gunfire. And sadly, as Spider-man 3 single-handedly proved, having too many villains can be dreadfully detrimental. Fears are confirmed when the enraged Harvey Dent starts to transform into his alter ego, Two-Face. The creative team behind The Dark Knight went to great lengths to achieve realism with the scar tissue and makeup for The Joker, but went drastically overboard on Two-Face. Believability is completely discarded for the sake of shocking.With amazing action sequences, a new Batcycle toy to play with, thrilling car chases, awe-inspiring stunts, bazookas, the demolition of buildings, and generally entertaining anarchy, The Dark Knight may be too mortifying for some, and just right for others - but Batman films always prove to be box office gold.- Mike Massie",3,The Dark Knight Movie Review by The Massie Twins,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,3459,"['Electrifyingly', 'darker', 'even', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'original', 'vision', 'Batman', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'certainly', 'family', 'film', 'Packed', 'explosive', 'action', 'heavy-hitting', 'violence', 'diabolical', 'maniacs', 'masked', 'vigilante', 'never', 'looked', 'felt', 'more', 'intense', 'many', 'attempts', 'seriousness', 'realism', 'still', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'inexplicable', 'technology', 'rescue', 'jarring', 'lack', 'security', 'villains', 'plot', 'elaborate', 'schemes', 'flawless', 'performance', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Batman', 'archrival', 'Joker', 'film', 'Two-Face', 'steals', 'screen', 'time', 'what', 'was', 'plenty', 'enough', 'mayhem', 'single', 'superhero.The', 'gangsters', 'who', 'run', 'underworld', 'Gotham', 'City', 'are', 'continually', 'scrutiny', 'mysterious', 'vigilante', 'Batman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Aided', 'new', 'district', 'attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'lawyer', 'girlfriend', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'town', 'crack', 'down', 'organized', 'crime', 'forcing', 'mobsters', 'turn', 'extreme', 'measures', 'when', 'let', 'clown', 'box.A', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'psychotic', 'masochist', 'who', 'face', 'paint', 'purple', 'suit', 'known', 'Joker', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'warring', 'gangs', 'dispose', 'Batman', 'attempts', 'kill', 'pesky', 'vigilante', 'hero', 'uncontrollable', 'unstable', 'spread', 'panic', 'pandemonium', 'streets', 'Gotham', 'Firstly', 'targeting', 'everyone', 'close', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Joker', 'city', 'explosives', 'death', 'everyone', 'absolutely', 'not', 'laughing', 'matter.And', 'indeed', 'most', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Made', 'up', 'truly', 'sinister', 'appearance', 'including', 'hideous', 'scars', 'devilish', 'clown', 'makeup', 'film', 'time', 'giving', 'notorious', 'antagonist', 'backstory', 'Opening', 'bank', 'robbery', 'scene', 'intensity', 'Heat', 'unforgettable', 'holdup', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'right', 'action', 'rarely', 'up', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'film', 'deadly', 'serious', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'difficult', 'see', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel.The', 'unrelentingly', 'baleful', 'tone', 'film', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'perfect', 'match', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'real', 'treat', 'fans', 'itching', 'stark', 'realism', 'much', 'over-the-top', 'fun', 'character', 'altogether', 'vanished', 'no', 'longer', 'friendly', 'younger', 'audiences', 'severe', 'switch', 'target', 'audiences', 'adults', 'may', 'find', 'questioning', 'ease', 'Joker', 'able', 'move', 'city', 'plant', 'bombs', 'avoid', 'gunfire', 'sadly', 'Spider-man', '3', 'single-handedly', 'proved', 'having', 'too', 'many', 'villains', 'can', 'be', 'dreadfully', 'detrimental', 'Fears', 'are', 'confirmed', 'when', 'enraged', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'transform', 'alter', 'ego', 'Two-Face', 'creative', 'team', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'achieve', 'realism', 'scar', 'tissue', 'makeup', 'Joker', 'went', 'drastically', 'overboard', 'Two-Face', 'Believability', 'completely', 'discarded', 'sake', 'shocking.With', 'amazing', 'action', 'sequences', 'new', 'Batcycle', 'toy', 'play', 'thrilling', 'car', 'chases', 'awe-inspiring', 'stunts', 'bazookas', 'demolition', 'buildings', 'generally', 'entertaining', 'anarchy', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'mortifying', 'just', 'right', 'others', 'Batman', 'films', 'always', 'prove', 'be', 'box', 'office', 'gold.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

That movie was all Jack Nicholson as the Joker.  Michael Keaton pulled it off but his scenes weren't as well developed and were less interesting than Jack's.  Still, a monster hit.  Tim Burton directed the sequel, which had even LESS action and more weirdness.  I can't even remember the name of that one, just the boredom of seeing it once.Was Val Kilmer next?  BATMAN FOREVER.  Tim Burton moved on and the franchise was handed a slow, horrible death at the hands of Joel Shumacher.  Watching his Batman films was like watching an alternative theatre troupe in San Francisco stage a Caped Crusader cabaret show.  The bad guys were so flamboyant that I wondered if Waylon & Madame from the old Hollywood Squares was going to show up to menace Gotham City.  Street gangs wore glow in the dark pastel face paint.  The bat suit got nipples.  Everyone blamed George Clooney for killing the Batman franchise...no...it was the director.So Warner Brothers let the (sparkling) dust settle and revived the franchise with Christopher Nolan.  Excellent choice.  BATMAN BEGINS wasn't just the reboot the series needed, it was the first GOOD Batman movie ever made.That winning streak continues with THE DARK KNIGHT.  You don't get the feeling you're watching just a comic book movie, you're seeing genuine characters who inhabit a semi-believable world of shifting lines and shadows.  Everything is top of the line.  Yes, it's long.  It almost feels like two films.  But it's great and it blows away all the other films put together.  It's a tragedy that Heath Ledger is gone because his Joker is someone you can't get enough of.  (I don't think I would've even know it was him if he had been unbilled!).Thank you, Christopher Nolan and the rest of the team!

660045,A3OWUMRVHG0VGT,B00005JPY0,The Lou,"[2, 3]","Mr. Nolan & Mr. Goyer master piece is nothing less than riveting. This high octane power house movie excels where most other block busters flop on the beach. The direction, acting and story strive to be as believable as possible in this hyper reality setting. The affect draws the viewer closer to this classic icon and all the emotional highs and lows that come with being The Dark Knight.Story: My jaw is still on the floor in the movie theater I saw the TDK at(I should really go pick it back up). The writing is original, witty and stays in the realms of what is possible even it's not very probable. Basic story is good vs. evil and all the trials confronting true evil entails.Acting: Heath Ledger should at the very least be nominated for an Oscar. I've never been a fan of his but wow he simple stopped being human on screen and turned into the essence of evil. I found his character scary because he was so believable in his role (Who was the last guy to play the Joker? Jack somebody oh it doesn't really matter because no one this century is going to out due Heath's approach to the Joker). His performance alone ranks for me personally as one of the top ten screen performances I've ever seen. Not mention the other half a dozen actors whose performances are nothing less than powerful on screen.Originality: Most sequels are a lesser version of their predecessors or they simply suck. This is typically due to a lack of new ideas and directions. The story still played off the first movie BB premise but added new depths and character struggles (these movies tend to have the basic man vs. man, man vs. nature theme around every corner).Special effects: Good special effects are the ones you don't know existed because they look so real. This movie has a great blend of actual action and special effects. Everything is finely crafted and looks awesome on the big screen. The bat pod was a great extra touch as well.Music/Sound: The score is captivating and keeps the intense story going strong. Great sound effects also especially on the bat pod.Fun: This movie was a great ride that surpassed all my expectations. It is however a very long movie that could easily be worth watching over two days instead of cramming it all into one sitting. Despite its length this movie never lets up the action or has any flaws that tend to surface during most extra long movies.Last take: TDK took me on a roller coaster ride and I loved every minute of it. That being said I'm already a huge batman fan and especially liked Christopher Nolan's take on this recent installment. This movie is rated PG-13 but really pushes the envelope is this area (basically this isn't kids movie). TDK isn't the usual batman concept that all about being campy and fun. This movie takes you into the depths of darkness/evil and some viewers might not really enjoy visiting this dreary place. Despite the movie never losing its quality beware the length is a lot to take in one sitting. This is sure to make it onto all top critics top one hundred best movie lists nuff said.Extra Note: Regarding the movies extras they are malnourished to say the least. You get a cool video on the batpod and the batsuit and thats about it. There is also a Gotham news special hosted by Anthony Michael Hall(He basic plays his TDK character again) that's ok but nothing to write home about. I didn't lower my score concerning the TDK depsite this section clearly lacking depth but be warned there isn't all the juicy extras most of us love paying extra for in this two disc set. I only paid $18 dollars for my new TDK set leaving me without that burned feeling some of the other reviewers have.",5,A must see but not for everyone,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,3662,"['Mr.', 'Nolan', 'Mr.', 'Goyer', 'master', 'piece', 'nothing', 'less', 'riveting', 'high', 'octane', 'power', 'house', 'movie', 'excels', 'where', 'most', 'other', 'block', 'busters', 'flop', 'beach', 'direction', 'acting', 'story', 'strive', 'be', 'as', 'believable', 'possible', 'hyper', 'reality', 'setting', 'affect', 'viewer', 'closer', 'classic', 'icon', 'emotional', 'highs', 'lows', 'come', 'being', 'Dark', 'Knight.Story', 'jaw', 'still', 'floor', 'movie', 'theater', 'saw', 'TDK', 'should', 'really', 'go', 'pick', 'back', 'up', 'writing', 'original', 'witty', 'stays', 'realms', 'what', 'possible', 'even', 'not', 'very', 'probable', 'Basic', 'story', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'trials', 'confronting', 'true', 'evil', 'entails.Acting', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'should', 'very', 'least', 'be', 'nominated', 'Oscar', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'simple', 'stopped', 'being', 'human', 'screen', 'turned', 'essence', 'evil', 'found', 'character', 'scary', 'was', 'so', 'believable', 'role', 'Who', 'was', 'last', 'guy', 'play', 'Joker', 'Jack', 'somebody', 'oh', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'one', 'century', 'going', 'out', 'due', 'Heath', 'approach', 'Joker', 'performance', 'alone', 'personally', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'screen', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Not', 'mention', 'other', 'half', 'dozen', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'nothing', 'less', 'powerful', 'screen.Originality', 'Most', 'sequels', 'are', 'lesser', 'version', 'predecessors', 'simply', 'suck', 'typically', 'due', 'lack', 'new', 'ideas', 'directions', 'story', 'still', 'played', 'off', 'first', 'movie', 'BB', 'premise', 'added', 'new', 'depths', 'character', 'struggles', 'movies', 'tend', 'have', 'basic', 'man', 'vs.', 'man', 'man', 'vs.', 'nature', 'theme', 'corner', '.Special', 'effects', 'Good', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'existed', 'look', 'so', 'real', 'movie', 'great', 'blend', 'actual', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'Everything', 'finely', 'crafted', 'awesome', 'big', 'screen', 'bat', 'pod', 'was', 'great', 'extra', 'touch', 'well.Music/Sound', 'score', 'captivating', 'intense', 'story', 'going', 'strong', 'Great', 'sound', 'effects', 'also', 'especially', 'bat', 'pod.Fun', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'ride', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'however', 'very', 'long', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'two', 'days', 'instead', 'cramming', 'one', 'sitting', 'length', 'movie', 'never', 'up', 'action', 'flaws', 'tend', 'surface', 'most', 'extra', 'long', 'movies.Last', 'take', 'TDK', 'took', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'loved', 'minute', 'being', 'said', ""'m"", 'already', 'huge', 'batman', 'fan', 'especially', 'liked', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'take', 'recent', 'installment', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'really', 'envelope', 'area', 'basically', ""n't"", 'kids', 'movie', 'TDK', ""n't"", 'usual', 'batman', 'concept', 'being', 'campy', 'fun', 'movie', 'depths', 'darkness/evil', 'viewers', 'might', 'not', 'really', 'enjoy', 'visiting', 'dreary', 'place', 'movie', 'never', 'losing', 'quality', 'length', 'lot', 'take', 'one', 'sitting', 'sure', 'make', 'top', 'critics', 'top', 'one', 'hundred', 'best', 'movie', 'lists', 'nuff', 'said.Extra', 'Note', 'Regarding', 'movies', 'are', 'malnourished', 'say', 'least', 'get', 'cool', 'video', 'batpod', 'batsuit', 'thats', 'also', 'Gotham', 'news', 'special', 'hosted', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'TDK', 'character', 'again', 'ok', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'did', ""n't"", 'lower', 'score', 'concerning', 'TDK', 'depsite', 'section', 'clearly', 'lacking', 'depth', 'be', 'warned', ""n't"", 'juicy', 'most', 'love', 'paying', 'extra', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'only', 'paid', '18', 'dollars', 'new', 'TDK', 'set', 'leaving', 'burned', 'feeling', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

660047,A3NQSMTG612AF,B00005JPY0,TheTruthHurts,"[0, 1]","3.5 StarsI suppose that the hype is as good a place as any to start, and in this arena, ""The Dark Knight"" is no slouch. Quite possibly the most overhyped film in all of history, furthered by the death of Heath Ledger, this film had more publicity going in than anything I can recall (even more than ""Star Wars: Episode One,"" if that's possible). Why? Supposedly, not simply because it was the latest comic book spectacle (and the ""biggest"" so far), but because it was a true ""masterpiece"" containing depth the likes of which we'd never seen (in a comic book film [not saying much]), ""masterful"" performances (namely Ledger's, an actor not especially well known for his talent before ""Brokeback Mountain""), and ""darkness"" and ""rawness"" never before witnessed in a major ""blockbuster."" I'll agree with the third contention; however, that said, making a film as dark as possible simply to escape the perceived comical attitude of the earlier Batman pictures doesn't necessarily make for an entertaining, ""deep"" picture, nor one that is particularly memorable.Reverting to this concept of ""depth,"" I beg of you, what precisely was so ""deep"" about this film? Despite the fact that a good deal of the film is dialogue-driven, it revolves around a fairly typical story that we've heard a million times before (good corrupted by evil, yawn bla bla yawn...). While I know that I'll be crucified for this statement, and despite the obligatory Academy Award nod, Ledger's portrayal of ""The Joker"" was, in my opinion, unfortunately nowhere near as ""masterful"" as fanboys would proclaim, and only slightly more memorable than Murphy's portral of ""The Scarecrow."" Christian Bale (yes, the main draw of the film before Ledger's death) was virtually invisible in the film, especially as Bruce Wayne, and Rachel, aside from being relatively homely (not that Mrs. Cruise is extraordinarily attractive anymore, either, but...), didn't concern me with her death...at all.Ultimately, this is a pretentiously long, barely ""above-average"" film that, while watchable, was nowhere near as engaging as it should have been, and in my opinion, it is no more successful than ""Batman Begins"" in breaking away from the modern comic book mold. Personally speaking, I have found virtually every comic-book film produced this century to be almost completely devoid of any real soul or substance, and ""Batman Begins,"" while a step in the right exception, was no exception to this stance. That said, with ""The Dark Knight,"" they moved away from the (marginally interesting) character exploration we found in the prior film, made Christian Bale a supporting actor, and focused on a character that aside from being ""insane,"" simply wasn't all that interesting to watch, and again, I just didn't care all that much about his actions or his fate. That said, ""Two Face"" was somewhat appealing, if only because his character was spewed forth from one of the film's protagonists and was based on an action that we'd witnessed earlier on...but not enough to engage me with his death, or be genuinely concerned by it.There seems to be a movement within Hollywood to promote films (especially of the comic book variety) that substitute real depth and emotional connection (see: ""Superman,"" still the best comic book film ever created) with tremendously overproduced action sequences (usually CGI-based, though apparently, ""TDK"" avoided this fate, generally speaking), and apparently, this is not only good enough for the masses, but exactly what they're after (given that this film made over $500 million [similarly to ""Star Wars: Episode One"" almost entirely based on hype (particularly Ledger's)]). Well, it doesn't work for me, and it simply isn't good enough to earn my money (I spent $1 to rent this picture from RedBox, and I'd state that that was a fair price), and I'd wager that the majority of the people that paid to see this film in the theater (perhaps not IMAX, because in that arena, you're there strictly for the visuals) were sincerely disappointed upon its conclusion (not that they have the courage to admit it).Clearly, neither film audiences nor critics are what they used to be...and they seem to have forgetten what a truly ""great"" movie consists of (and I, for one, believe that critics have become more susceptible to hype, and less able to resist it (by being honest) within the last decade [Roger Ebert is a perfect example; he awarded four-star (""masterpiece"") ratings to both ""Spiderman 2"" and ""X-Men 2,"" both outwardly mediocre pictures]). For me, it's one that makes me care about the characters and their fates and has some real character exposition and meaning (not the emptiness we find with 2000-era comic book films)(again, look to ""Superman"" for a comic book film containing all of these traits).Now, on to the Blu-Ray push behind this film (indirectly [though consciously] inspiring literally hundreds of ""five-star"" reviews here [and everywhere else where Blu-Ray is discussed]); this is THE Blu-Ray that the BDA is praying will push Blu-Ray into the mainstream, and with the shoddy DVD that Warner Bros. released (low bitrate, weak features, etc.), the strategy just might work. For those viewing the film on Blu-Ray, you might not be aware that the DVD contains not one, not two, but THREE Blu-Ray advertisements before the film begins. Mind you, I OWN A BLU-RAY PLAYER (NOT a PS3). In most cases, the Blu-Ray version isn't worth two or three times the money, but in this case, as the DVD has been produced substandardly (if they were concerned with its quality, they would have split the film into two discs, added DTS-ES and PIP commentaries, and increased the bitrate to at least 8 mbps), again, it most certainly is.In conclusion, I'd strongly suggest that you rent this film (on Blu-Ray, if possible) before throwing $[...] dollars away; though decent, it is generally unworthy of its absurd hype, Ledger's performance isn't as memorable as Nicholson's (though with the current state of the lack of integrity within the Academy, Ledger's virtually guaranteed to receive the award simply out of obligation and for the sake of the Academy's public image), and I simply don't think (unless you absolutely LOVE 2000-era comic book pictures) that you'll find it to be as enjoyable as you'd expected. It is, at best, an exercise in tedium that overextends its welcome by at least thirty pretentious minutes and, despite all of its ""darkness"" and ""reinvention,"" ultimately doesn't succeed with flying colors to engage the viewer and leave any real impact.In a word (I'll say it a third time): pretentious.",4,"Overhyped, overrated, and overcooked...",1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,6598,"['3.5',

The acting was wooden, the violence gratuitous, the plot disgusting and disturbing.I don't want to have man's inhumanity to man rubbed in my nose when I watch a movie for entertainment.  I don't want a 100+ body count or graphic views of a woman being blown to smithereens.Sorry, let's leave The Smithereens out of this.  They rock!This movie dragged on and on, it had zero humor in it, and the acting was strictly second-rate compared to the benchmark of the original Batman series of movies.I recommend those.  Jack Nicholson, Jim Carey, Danny DeVito, Tommy Lee Jones all played GREAT villains and stole the movies.  They were evil but believable, and most of all they were FUNNY.Ledger was NOT funny and NOT believable.  Sorry, but no insane guy is going to keep coming up with HUGE blow-em-up scenarios one right after the other, particularly when constantly being chased by a badly acted Batman.

660051,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPY0,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 12]","When I was a little boy, my father took me to the theater to see a great film, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and I was so impressed by the experience that I figured all 'summer films' would be as good. Little did I know I was in for many years of disappointment. My mother saw my permanent frown and asked ""Why so glum?""After watching ""The Dark Knight"", my permanent frown is now a smile as wide as possible. My faith has been restored. But will my smile slowly disappear as one filmmaker after another submits a series of bad films for our perusal, wreaking havoc with my mind?""The Dark Knight"" is a great film. A film better than any fans had any right to expect or hope for. It is the rare summer sequel that will cause people to eagerly anticipate more summer fare. Maybe this isn't a good thing because the majority of summer films we are subjected to aren't worth the trouble and will inevitably let us down.All of the best superhero movies feature both strong heroes and strong villains. And Christopher Nolan understands this. He also ups the ante considerably. But in doing so, he has created a massive film that breaks a lot of rules and is pretty challenging, for summer fare; you will actually have to pay attention to the labyrinth story and characters. But the film is also better because Nolan tries these things and accomplishes. In fact he has set the bar so high, it is now clear that all future superhero films will be measured against the first two ""Spiderman"" films or maybe ""Iron Man"". Nolan's vision of Batman has transcended the genre of superhero film.""The Dark Knight"" is darker, much darker in tone than ""Batman Begins"" and this is something most summer films stay away from. Summer is a time for lighter fare, so making a film with a dark subject matter is a rule breaker. The fact that it works is all the more rewarding to the viewer.A void has been created in Gotham City. Batman (Christian Bale) has been so successful in his allegiance with Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman), the underworld has gone in to hiding. All Gordon has to do is turn on the Bat Signal and criminals go into hiding. Recognizing this void, a psychotic named the Joker (Heath Ledger) steps in, ready and willing to create havoc and make things miserable for Batman and the new shining, white knight of Gotham City, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Dent isn't afraid of the underworld and sets about trying to clean up the city with the help of his assistant, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who is also Bruce Wayne's former girlfriend. Wayne relies on the sage advice of his butler, Alfred (Michael Caine) and his inventor, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). As the Joker's crimes become more elaborate and deadly, everyone tries to work together to put a stop to his actions. But there will be consequences.Nolan, who has created an impressive roster of films, adds ""The Dark Knight"" to this list and it is every bit as impressive as you can hope for. What really struck me about this film is how many different facets of it shouldn't work, but do. And this success stems from the director's skill. And also the screenplay he wrote with the aid of his brother, Jonathan. Both areas are crafted in such a way to make sure everything fits together and works.""The Dark Knight"" is an involving, convoluted, long film. But it is also a film with a crystal clear message. And this message is both subtle and extremely in our face. All of the moments we watch are meant to illustrate this message and to provide further depth to the story. This in turn makes the story deeper, more interesting and the idea really hits home. When the Joker steps into the void that is Gotham City and begins to create havoc, he recognizes that he and Batman are two sides of the same coin. This is why he becomes so intent on exposing ""the Batman"", because he is convinced that no one is that good, someone who rides around in a cape and mask helping people, must have something to hide. And he wants this 'hero' exposed. He frequently provides a death toll of what he perceives are Batman's actions when they meet. This is the more subtle presentation of this theme. When Bruce Wayne meets Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), he is mildly jealous because Dent and Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal taking over the same role from Katie Holmes) are now a couple. But he also recognizes a kindred spirit and someone who can help his alter ego clean up the streets of Gotham. So Dent, with the help of Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and his friend, Batman, begin to arrest all of the crime lords of Gotham. Dent is everything Wayne wishes he could be, but without a mask and cape. Dent is even referred to as ""The White Knight"" on more than one occasion, an overt reference to how he and Bruce Wayne/ Batman are also two sides of the same coin. But Nolan isn't content to stop there and takes the theme even further, by introducing us to the villain Two Face. Two Face is a crazy mo-fo (all of which is understandable as you watch the film, we see his 'creation' during the course of the narrative) and he uses a two-headed coin to determine the fate of his victims.This brings me to my one small complaint about ""The Dark Knight"". In every great superhero film, we see the birth of both the hero and the villain. Obviously, while watching sequels, we have already seen the birth of the hero, so the film would concentrate on the birth of the villain and how the hero reacts to this. In ""Knight"", we see the creation of a villain, Two Face, but this happens late in the film. Much earlier, the Joker (Heath Ledger) explodes on the screen and begins his reign of terror. The Joker is a force to be reckoned with and Ledger gives a bravura performance and makes the character his own. Consider how difficult a task this must have been given he is following Jack Nicholson and even Cesar Romero in the same role. But Ledger explodes on the screen behind the Joker's greasy, gray green hair and his wickedly painted face. Scraping his hair back from his face with his knife razor as he licks his lips, you recognize this guy has a seriously twisted frame of mind. During the course of the film, he makes a few mentions of how he became the Joker, but you begin to doubt the validity of these claims and wonder if this isn't part of the psycho's modus operandi. In the end, Ledger's performance is so powerful you don't even mind that we don't have a back-story for the character. Another example of Nolan making something that shouldn't work successful.The Joker is what a villain should be. Scary, unpredictable and ruthless. And he sets the bar for all others to follow. Even a brief appearance by Cillian Murphy, returning as the Scarecrow, only serves to show how much better Ledger is as the Joker. Murphy was good in ""Begins"", but he pales in comparison.Christian Bale returns as Batman and Bruce Wayne and seems more conflicted. He is dealing with his feelings for Rachel, who is now dating Harvey Dent. He has to push this feelings aside because he feels Dent holds real promise for the city, so he resorts to making mild, playful jabs at both of them, trying to win Rachel back. As Batman battles the Joker, he has to deal with a bunch of other forces at the same time; suspected corruption in the police force, protecting the city officials, trying to help round up the underworld leaders. He brings a heightened level of intensity to the character, giving us a deeper feeling for what Wayne is experiencing.Michael Caine returns as Alfred, Wayne's butler, who is always ready to provide some sage advice. Caine is a great actor and it is nice to see him in a supporting role like this because even though Alfred doesn't have the biggest role in the story, he actually sort of does. He is the man who helps Wayne stay centered, stay calm and make the right decisions.Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox, the brains behind Wayne Industries. Sort of like Wayne's own personal ""Q"", Fox prepares all of the tools Batman needs to fight the baddies. He also helps Wayne run the huge corporation he owns and gives him the support he needs.Maggie Gyllenhaal steps into the role of Rachel Dawes and does a very good job. You see how tough this woman is, how unwilling she is to put up with anything, how determined she is to help Harvey beat the bad guys. Don't forget, she is one of only a handful of people who know the true identity of Batman and she remains true to this knowledge, protecting it even from Harvey. Whenever she appears within feet of Bruce Wayne, you can see the pain in her face, the pain of their breakup. Gyllenhaal is certainly a different type of look than Katie Holmes and I think the fit is a little better. Tall and lanky, much like some of the classic sirens of the 40s (I'm thinking Rita Hayworth or Gene Tierney), she just seems to be a better fit for Wayne and Dent.Gary Oldman also returns as Lt. Gordon, an honest man who is as intent on cleaning up the city as Dent and Batman. He will do whatever it takes.Nolan has assembled a great cast, each of whom brings a special quality to their portrayals of these characters. But he has also assembled a top-notch creative crew as well, and the film is as technically beautiful and accomplished as the performances.One thing that stuck out to me was the sound design of the film. In a handful of moments, a great panoramic view of Gotham pops up accompanied by slight white noise. No music. Then, as the scene begins, you would expect the music to swell and give us cues to how we should feel. But it doesn't and we continue to hear a slight bit of white noise as the characters battle it out. This is a great way of showing us what the characters are experiencing, what is driving the Joker mad, what is making Batman all the more anxious to have a normal life. There is noticeably less music in this film than most big budget actionIt has been widely reported that Nolan shot the action scenes for this film with an IMAX camera. Does this add anything to the film? It provides a wider canvas for the action, giving us bigger, crystal clear images, more information and more to look at. Quite honestly, the action scenes are fantastic and watching Bale's Batman speed through Gotham in the Batmobile or on the Batbike are just the beginnings of much more complicated action scenes. Much of the film takes place at night and even these scenes are beautiful to watch because they are slightly moody, yet we never lose sight of the actors or the action.Watching ""The Dark Knight"" is an exciting thing. It is the rare film that breaks so many rules, yet you don't feel like you have been cheated. So, we have two villains in an already overcrowded film. But they work together as two distinct parts of the story. We have a convoluted story, requiring the viewer to pay attention, to keep track of everything that is going on. How many other 'summer films' can you think of that did this? Probably less than you can count on one hand. There is a lot of story in ""Knight"" but it all points to one theme, as discussed before, and all of this story helps to reinforce the main ideas. The cast is filled with superlative actors, giving each of the characters depth we wouldn't normally expect from 'popcorn fare'. And the film is dark, darker than its predecessor.""The Dark Knight"" is the summer film we all want and hope for every time we plunk down our hard earned dollars for a film. Now that we have had the pleasure of experiencing this work, we will be expecting more summer films to be this good. I'm not sure if that is a good thing, because we are inevitably in for more letdowns.What have you done to us, Christopher Nolan?",5,"""The Dark Knight"" Is Going to Spoil Us...",1216684800,"07 22,

In fact, Tim Burton's 1989 resurrection ofBatman, with its dark and gritty futuristic Gotham now looks quaint in comparison...and I LOVED what he did with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. The difference? Heath Ledger makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like Cesar Romero fromThe 60's Batman TV series.Ledger's Joker is a lip-smacking psychotic killer clown. He's a sadist/masochist/anarchist who likes to burn things just to see them burning, to paraphrase Alfred. And with ""The Dark Knight"" basically picking up close to where ""Batman Begins"" lets off, Christian Bales' Bruce Wayne is still coming to grips with the Batman part of his psyche. The Joker is happy to jam his rusty humor into Batman's dementia and twist it as hard as he can. Ledger sets up traps more diabolical than any of Jigsaw'sSawmachinations. As the movie jumps from plateau to plateau, the thrill ride is a pure adrenal rush. Add in The Joker's scary/funny interaction that finally drives Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, looking regal) over the cliff into becoming Two Face, and this movie jiggers the characters' personalities with enough force to transcend the ""comic-book"" movie tag.While all the supporting actors do the jobs well (wait, Eric Roberts AND Anthony Micheal Hall are in this?!?!), this movie belongs to Bale and Ledger. In fact, Ledger owns this movie. He is crazy/brilliant as The Joker, with his crime meeting magic trick setting the tone for the entire film and not letting up after.

That night, multiple Batman impersonators interrupt a meeting between mobsters and the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy). The real Batman (Christian Bale) shows up and puts a quick end to the mallee .Batman and Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) decide to being in newly elected district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in on their plan to eradicate the mob, with the possibility that Dent will become the hero to the people that Batman cannot be. At the same time, Bruce Wayne and Harvey are both competing for the love of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).The mob bosses meet to discuss how to handle Batman, Gordon, and Dent, while a Chinese mobster accountant, Lau (Chin Han), lets the gang leaders know he has taken their money to Hong Kong to prevent the police and the district attorney from seizing it in an imminent bank raid.The Joker arrives at the meeting and proposes to kill Batman for them, convincing them that Lau will give them all up to the police if he is caught...When fellow filmmaker Kevin Smith called TDK the Heat of the comic book film genre-he wasn't exaggerating...Director Christopher Nolan breaks new ground for the comic book film here.Creating one of the most sophisticated and intricate films of its kind ever produced. The script lays out the struggle between good and evil in such a way as to make it seem fresh--without being obvious and cliched. The script from Nolan and his brother Jonathan is just top notch reminding me once again why I love their work--they don't try to dumb things down for the sake of the viewer--taking them for granted. Even though we're dealing with a few fantastic characters who do fanciful things. The world of TDK is grounded in reality--Thanks in no small part to the performances...Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne continues to impress-giving us reason to see him truly the way he was created...complex and tortured....Meanwhile, Ledger is superb as the Joker-dialing down the over the top-ness of say Jack Nicholson from Batman of nearly 20 years ago (which fit the tone of that film and the times) and instead as a maniac could send a chill through you without saying a word. With a manipulation of his vocal inflection--Ledger's clown prince is quite creepy...Is it Oscar-worthy? I say Yes...Gyllenhaal's Rachel is miles ahead of the way that Katie Holmes played her in Batman Begins. While Eckhart is a perfect fit as Dent...Oldman, Morgan Freeman as Fox and Michael Caine as Alfred offer able support as always.The film boasts a spectacular cycle/car/truck chase and a nifty aerial stunt...The story indeed may offer some viewers a few unexpected twists and the set-up is there for a third film...And while Ledger's death earlier this year was tragic, the movie will forever stand as a reminder of what an actor could do in a ""comic book movie"" to help make it great...I can't wait to see TDK again...!",5,A Knight's Tale,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,3178,"['Dark', 'Knight-', 'everything', 'been', 'said', 'sequel', 'true', 'one', 'superhero', 'movie', 'up', 'hype', 'film', 'mysterious', 'criminal', 'known', 'only', 'Joker', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'mob-owned', 'Gotham', 'bank', 'double', 'crosses', 'accomplices', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'money', 'night', 'multiple', 'Batman', 'impersonators', 'interrupt', 'meeting', 'mobsters', 'Scarecrow', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'real', 'Batman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'up', 'quick', 'end', 'mallee', '.Batman', 'Lieutenant', 'James', 'Gordon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'decide', 'being', 'newly', 'elected', 'district', 'attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'plan', 'eradicate', 'mob', 'possibility', 'Dent', 'will', 'become', 'hero', 'people', 'Batman', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'time', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Harvey', 'are', 'competing', 'love', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', '.The', 'mob', 'bosses', 'meet', 'discuss', 'how', 'handle', 'Batman', 'Gordon', 'Dent', 'Chinese', 'mobster', 'accountant', 'Lau', 'Chin', 'Han', 'gang', 'leaders', 'know', 'taken', 'money', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'prevent', 'police', 'district', 'attorney', 'seizing', 'imminent', 'bank', 'raid.The', 'Joker', 'meeting', 'kill', 'Batman', 'convincing', 'Lau', 'will', 'give', 'up', 'police', 'caught', 'When', 'fellow', 'filmmaker', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'called', 'TDK', 'Heat', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'genre-he', 'was', ""n't"", 'exaggerating', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'new', 'ground', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'here.Creating', 'one', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'intricate', 'films', 'kind', 'ever', 'produced', 'script', 'out', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'such', 'way', 'make', 'seem', 'fresh', 'being', 'obvious', 'cliched', 'script', 'Nolan', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'just', 'top', 'notch', 'reminding', 'once', 'again', 'why', 'love', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'dumb', 'things', 'down', 'sake', 'viewer', 'taking', 'granted', 'Even', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'few', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'who', 'do', 'fanciful', 'things', 'world', 'TDK', 'grounded', 'reality', 'Thanks', 'small', 'part', 'performances', 'Bale', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'impress-giving', 'reason', 'see', 'truly', 'way', 'was', 'created', 'complex', 'tortured', '.Meanwhile', 'Ledger', 'superb', 'Joker-dialing', 'top-ness', 'say', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Batman', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'fit', 'tone', 'film', 'times', 'instead', 'maniac', 'could', 'send', 'chill', 'saying', 'word', 'manipulation', 'vocal', 'inflection', 'Ledger', 'clown', 'prince', 'quite', 'creepy', 'Oscar-worthy', 'say', 'Yes', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Rachel', 'miles', 'ahead', 'way', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'played', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Eckhart', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Dent', 'Oldman', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Fox', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfred', 'offer', 'able', 'support', 'always.The', 'film', 'spectacular', 'cycle/car/truck', 'chase', 'nifty', 'aerial', 'stunt', 'story', 'indeed', 'may', 'offer', 'viewers', 'few', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'set-up', 'there', 'third', 'film', 'Ledger', 'death', 'earlier', 'year', 'was', 'tragic', 'movie', 'will', 'forever', 'stand', 'reminder', 'what', 'actor', 'could', 'do', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'help', 'make', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'TDK', 'again']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

660062,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00005JPY0,Tom Benton,"[7, 9]","Just as Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" was clearly a product of the violence and confusion that arose in the mid-1970s, Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is unmistakably spawned from the gloom and doom attitude America has adopted in recent years.  It is like looking through murky glass at a beautiful dream ruined, a vision brought to its knees and humiliated.  More cynical Americans would say this has happened to America.  ""The Dark Knight"" is about dealing with the destruction of that dream.  Should we abandon that dream?  Should we hold on to its tattered remains?  Or should we continue on, remembering that vision, following it as best we can, even though it no longer exists as once we dreamt it?If it sounds absurd to dig so deep into a superhero movie, you've never read a comic book.  Around the mid-80s, comics became literature, thanks to authors like Alan Moore, whose comic ""Watchmen"" (soon to become a film directed by ""300"" director Zach Snyder) was listed by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest novels of the 20th century.  Just as it took comic books over 40 years to become mature, complex, and relevant, it's taken the film industry about 30 years to make a superhero film that transcends clever self-awareness and intense action sequences.  ""The Dark Knight"" is a film without pretension or self-consciousness, the Batman film comic book readers have hardly dared dream of.  It is the best film since Richard Donner's classic ""Superman"" in 1978.  In fact, it's much better.  This is the greatest comic book film of all time, because this is a comic book film that makes you forget it's a comic book film.  Everything in this movie falls past fantasy and into the world of terrifying reality.Warner Bros. and the film's producers made a brilliant decision hiring Christopher Nolan to re-start the Batman franchise back in 2005.  Nolan had previously made three immensely artistic and acclaimed independent films, chiefly 2000's ""Memento.""  He was and is a director who will never compromise his vision.  He may be the most skilled director in the business.  He's also one of the most cerebral directors, which is perfect for dealing with a character as psychologically complex as Bruce Wayne - a.k.a. Batman.  Tim Burton depicted Bruce Wayne as an eccentric, quirky, and mysterious millionaire in his films, where Wayne was portrayed by Michael Keaton, while Joel Schumacher depicted him as a rich playboy with no depth whatsoever for his two disastrous films in the late-1990s, which starred Val Kilmer and George Clooney.  Nolan's Wayne, played by the peerless Christian Bale, is a character who cannot escape his past, and who has built himself a vehicle to clear a path for a bright future.  That vehicle is Batman.  What Wayne does not realize is that Batman is destroying his future in the process.  Can Bruce Wayne escape Batman?  Should he escape Batman?  Or should he accept Batman as the life he has chosen?Wayne is in love with Rachel Dawes, who is now played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She was previously played very unconvincingly by Katie Holmes in 2005's ""Batman Begins.""  Gyllenhaal is a much more satisfying actor, and she brings much more plausibility to the character.  Rachel Dawes represents the perfect life that Bruce Wayne dreams of, the life that he feels Batman will give him.  So is he in love with Rachel, or what she represents?Somehow, Gotham City's new district attorney, Harvey Dent, seems to be the answer to all these questions.  Batman fans know where this is headed.  The Harvey Dent storyline is a fan favorite, set-up in Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" in which Dent was played by Billy Dee Williams, and then executed in a gruesome fashion in Joel Schumacher's dismal ""Batman Forever,"" in which Dent was played by Tommy Lee Jones.  Here, however, the storyline is beautifully adapted for the big screen by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, with whom he wrote the screenplay.  Nolan emphasizes the idealistic and optimistic friendship between Dent, Batman, and Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), especially its tragic consequences for the three of them.  Aaron Eckhart is perfectly cast: he has a genuine, all-American strength that's just what the role requires.  Eckhart's Harvey Dent is to Gotham City as Barack Obama is to America - which makes Dent's tragic fate hit audiences even harder.  Eckhart's only previous acclaim-garnering performance was in 2005's ""Thank You for Smoking""; if ""The Dark Knight"" is any indication, he's one of the most undervalued actors in Hollywood.But not many people have seen ""The Dark Knight"" for Christian Bale, or for Maggie Gyllenhaal, or for Aaron Eckhart.  They're seeing it for Heath Ledger, whose death - ghastly as it sounds - has aided the hype surrounding this film in ways that nothing else could.  It's especially bizarre, and, its own way, awesome, that Ledger's final performance is as a character so chilling and unforgettable as the Joker.  Last played by Jack Nicholson in 1989, the Joker is Batman's nemesis, and may be the most famous of all comic book villains.  Nicholson's Joker made audiences a little uncomfortable at times, but for the most part, he was a blast, adding all the over-the-top comic relief Burton's film needed.  Ledger's Joker is a whole different character.  He is the Joker as comic book fans know him, a horrifyingly unpredictable, sadistic, enigmatic serial killer.  Ledger's Joker has long, gangly hair.  His makeup is gradually rubbing off.  He has an Irish grin (if you don't know what that is, look it up).  And Ledger's performance, well - those who say Ledger carries the film are missing the point, because there's so much more to the film, but it is certainly the highlight of the picture.  It is brilliant.  It is sensational.  If it doesn't win Ledger a posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar, then the film industry will see its equivalent of the L.A. riots of the 1990s.  Which is to say that infuriated fans will post nasty messages on Internet message boards.  But still - something to be avoided.Rounding out the cast are the returning vets.  Morgan Freeman is as delightful as ever.  Freeman's character, Wayne Enterprises C.E.O. Lucius Fox, has a sense of moral absolutism which is invaluable when Bruce Wayne needs grounding.  Even more delightful is Michael Caine, whose warm yet cheeky portrayal of Alfred, Wayne's butler/father figure, adds some much-needed comic relief to the film.Oh, and when I write ""much-needed comic relief,"" I mean it.  ""The Dark Knight"" is not called ""The Dark Knight"" for no reason.  Otherwise, it would be called ""The Bright Knight,"" and that just doesn't have the same grit.  Its title has a double meaning.  On the one hand, it is Batman's nickname, the ""Dark Knight,"" which is particularly fitting given some of the choices he's forced to make in this film.  On the other hand, it refers to the period of time depicted in this film as a ""dark night,"" so to speak.  This is a dark, dark film.  At one point, Harvey Dent uses the old saying, ""The night is darkest just before the dawn.""  That's the crucial line of the film.  If ""Batman Begins"" was dusk, then the inevitable third film must be dawn, because ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly midnight.  Hope prevails at its end, because, thankfully, hope springs eternal, but for the most part, this film is black and bleak.  This film makes one feel like hope and optimism are futile emotions.  Isn't there a similar feeling running through our country right now?Chris Nolan's last film, ""The Prestige,"" was a spectacular piece of filmmaking.  I thought it was his masterwork.  But without a question, ""The Dark Knight"" trumps it.  Nolan is at the top of his game.  His style shines through the film, but never rises above the character, a problem which plagued the previous Batfilms.  Instead, Nolan's style, dark, gritty, and heavy, blends with the character.  Nolan and Batman are a perfect pair.  Shot-for-shot, the film is perfect.  Despite its two and a half hour runtime, which will be heaven for some and a bit arduous for others, there is not a wasted moment.  This film deserves a Best Film Editing Oscar.  In all honesty, it deserves a shipload of Oscars.  The chances of it receiving them are pretty slim.Maybe, though, the Academy will rise up and realize what they have in their hands: a masterpiece.  It's a masterpiece of superhero films, staying true to the classic storylines, but also fully realizing the depth and psychological complexities of each and every character.  It has none of the self-consciousness which peeped out in Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" films (though that was fitting, considering their socially-awkward hero), and none of the lack of ambition which plagued Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns.""  And it's a masterpiece of cinema, period.  ""The Dark Knight"" is a film in the classical sense.  Its storylines are captivating, intriguing, grand, and clever.  It's technically flawless.  It has a historical relevance which many seem to be overlooking.  The mood of the film, its messages and observations, are so clearly a product of the troubled times we're living in.  Audiences are connecting with it, which is why it's now the second-biggest film of all-time domestically.  Lastly, it's a film very representative of America, both from a citizen's perspective and from the perspective of an outsider (F.Y.I., director Nolan is British).  Michael Caine said it best: ""Superman is the way America sees itself.  Batman is the way the world sees America.""If that's so, we have a long and dark path ahead of us.  But at its end, ""The Dark Knight"" suggests that there is only one way to go, and that's forward, no matter the cost, no matter the stakes.  It may not be a pleasant journey, but fortunately, moviegoers have films like this to help us on our way.",5,A knight for our darkening days,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,9827,"['Just', 'Martin',

660063,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B00005JPY0,Tom Birkenstock,"[1, 1]","By now we've been trained to expect a franchise's second film to be its darkest.  This precedent was arguably set by Empire Strikes Back, which managed to end on a surprisingly bleak note for a blockbuster film.  This trend continued with Back to the Future Part 2, which brought us the terrifying Biff controlled Hill Valley, Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, which introduced a heart collecting Thuggee cult, and D2: The Mighty Ducks, which placed our pee wee hockey team in the middle of geopolitical turmoil.  In this sense, The Dark Knight does not disappoint.  If in the first movie Batman struggled against questions of retribution and revenge, in The Dark Knight he confronts untethered chaos as embodied in Heath Ledger's Joker.The movie begins in media res, as the Joker's men rip off a bank housing the unjust enrichments of Gotham's mob.  The heist's ""punch line"" happens to be the fact that the Joker has told each thief that he should kill the others in order to cut down on the number of people who will eventually split the money.  The only thief who survives happens to be the Joker in disguise.  This is one of many robberies the Joker has committed, all of which targeted the holdings of Gotham's organized crime, a move so brazen that one of the bank's guards even asks ""Do you know who you're stealing from?""  I think it is safe to say that the Joker does in fact know who he's stealing from.This string of robberies stretches back to Batman Begins where Gordon tells Batman that a bank was ripped off by a lunatic who left a joker card as his calling, which means that the heist that opens the sequel does a nice job of connecting both films.  The Dark Knight further maintains the global scope of its predecessor.  Gotham's mob community (who have sorts of inter-familial meetings along the lines of the Algonquin round table) are involved in an international money laundering scheme that stretches across the globe to China.  In one of the film's best sequences, Batman decides to forcibly extradite Lau, the head of a Chinese corporation that is in league with Gotham's underworld.  Not only does Batman glide from one Hong Kong skyscraper to another, but he also devises a way for to hitch a ride with an in-flight airplane with Lau in tow.The series of decisions that lead up to this abduction lend the world of Gotham some real life weight.  Like an episode of Law and Order, the district attorney Harvey Dent confers with Lieutenant Gordon in order to determine how best to take down Gotham's mobsters.  The two then decide to rely on Batman's ability to perform an extra-legal extradition.  The police procedural aspect to the film accomplishes something that we rarely see in the comic books which are often concerned with flitting from one action panel to another: presenting the Gotham as a living, breathing city.  It is certainly in-keeping with Christopher Nolan's goal of grounding the superhero film in reality, an objective that is often achieved on the level of aesthetics, if not often on the level of plot.The Joker pulls off a series of criminal acts that look more like thought experiments than traditional crimes.  He threatens to continue killing Gotham's citizens until Batman reveals his identity to the public, and when Harvey Dent turns himself in as Batman in order to calm an agitated public, the Joker attacks Dent's SWAT team convoy in a dazzling set piece.  Later the Joker will make Batman choose between the life of Gotham's one true hero, the law abiding Harvey Dent, and Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes, graciously recast from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenhaal.  And in the film's climax two ferries, one containing everyday citizens and the other criminals, must decide whether or not they want to blow the other up in order to save their own lives.All of these Sophie's choices could have easily come across as the product of a freshman college student's philosophy 101 term paper, if not for the byzantine, contorted, and scene stealing performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker.  Despite the fact that Ledger's Joker only appears for a grand total of ten and a half minutes in the entire two and a half hour movie, he successfully hijacks the film.  I think it is safe to say that Ledger's performance would have received the same accolades even if it weren't for his untimely death.  Ledger frequently smacks his distended lips as if he is never quite satiated, and at times he moves in a waddle in what is some unknowable inside joke.  Perhaps the film's most iconic scene occurs when Joker swerves down a street in a stolen police car, stretching his head out of the window and enjoying the wind on his face.  It is in this moment that the Joker seduces the audience to his point of view.  For just a second we get to see the joy and absolute freedom of anarchic will.  I have always felt that a great portrayal of the Joker lies not in his body count (although there's plenty of that here), but in his ability to convince an audience that his form of freewheeling violence might be just a little enjoyable.As a villain, the Joker poses a problem that's distinct from the League of Shadows.  Where the League of Shadows was an ideological terrorist group bent on refashioning the world in their own image, the Joker is pure bedlam.  His reasoning is inscrutable and thus unpredictable.  Like in the best horror movies, a genre from which Nolan also borrows, the Joker is scary because he defies traditional Enlightenment notions of reason.  Where half of Batman Begins was dedicated to the origins of its title character, Joker is distinct because we are denied an origin story.  He does provide a shifting narrative of his scarred face, but he's an unreliable narrator switching out his traumatic beginning whenever he feels like it.If the League of Shadows represented Al Qaeda, then the Joker represents the anthrax attacks that followed.  Where the Twin Towers attack was a sickening spectacle, the anthrax attacks only furthered America's belief that violence could strike any one of us at any time and was arguably just as influential in convincing Americans that it was a good idea to invade Iraq as the 9/11 attack.  To this day, it is still entirely unclear who was involved in the anthrax attack and for what reason.  As the Joker tells a mentally and physically scarred Harvey Dent, ""If tomorrow I tell the press that like a gang banger, will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it's all, part of the plan.""  Likewise, Americans seemed perfectly comfortable with the idea of civilian and military deaths within a war zone half a world away, but the moment that our own sense of security comes under attack, then we readily sacrifice hundreds of thousands of innocent foreigners and thousands of our own soldiers just so we can open our mail in peace.The central idea of The Dark Knight, that we are willing to cross ethical lines when the personal safety of ourselves and loves ones is broached, is embodied in the character of Harvey Dent.  While we see shadows in the corners of Dent's personality early on--he is surprisingly tolerant of Batman for a DA--the film explicitly positions him as the opposite of the caped crusader, as a man who works within the system and still manages to put criminals behind bars.  At one point he is referred to as Gotham's ""white knight.""  But over the course of the film Dent becomes tarnished.  He begins bending rules, even threatening to shoot a suspect in order to garner more information.  When the Joker blows up half of Dent's face, then he goes into full on Inigo Montoya revenge mode.Any fan of Batman knows that Dent is playing the role of Two-Face, one of Batman's most complex villains.  While I'm sure most moviegoers were happy with Two-Face's appearance, as a longtime fan of the comics I was a little disappointed in his inclusion as a second tier villain.  The character also got short shrift in the campfest Batman Forever (again, playing second fiddle).  Even at two and a half hours, The Dark Knight feels increasingly overstuffed (I haven't even touched upon the subplot of the Wayne employee who uncovers his dual identity), and tacking on Two-Face feels like there are too many balls in the air.  Besides, when will this great character get the full spotlight he deserves?In some ways The Dark Knight is a messier film than its predecessor, but it more than makes up for it by being a much more ambitious film as well.  Arguably the greatest improvement between the first film and the second is Nolan's increased comfort shooting action scenes.  This is apparent in a showdown between the Joker brandishing a machine gun and Batman on a high tech motorcycle.  The scene becomes a clash of wills, the Joker employing Batman to break his code against killing, willing to sacrifice himself to prove man's infallibility.The Dark Knight ends on a note of nihilism.  Batman must become the villain in order to maintain Dent's role as a hero, because otherwise the masses would lose faith in social and government systems.  In Nolan's world there's a deep distrust of the people.  And while he does suggest that at times everyday people might surprise us and make the moral decision, ultimately this is overshadowed by the central characters who give in to a code of no code.  It is this anti-democratic point of view that not only makes the film an intriguing in its own right, but also makes it a unique blockbuster.  What other multi-million dollar success stories are as critical of the type of widespread populism that makes the summer blockbuster possible in the first place?  I may not agree with The Dark Knight's view of the world, and at times its theorizing can be incredibly thin, but it is a rare big budgeted film that makes us question our own moral fortitude.",4,Batman Fights Nihilism,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,9857,"['now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trained', 'expect', 'franchise', 'second', 'film', 'be', 'darkest', 'precedent', 'was', 'arguably',

660072,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B00005JPY0,trashcanman,"[5, 7]","Alright, so here it is, the most anticipated film of the year.  Hailed even before it's release as the superhero movie that transcends the genre, the unforgettable final performance of one of Hollywood's finest, the Batman story to eclipse all other adaptations, The Resurrection on film.  Does it live up to the hype?  Nothing on this planet could.  Sorry.  But as great as it is, what we have in ""the Dark Knight"" is not The Resurrection on film.  It's The Crucifixion.  This is not a comic book movie in tone or execution.  Even when it deliberately tries to be a superhero film, it's more of an annoyance that gets in the way of the story than the kind of elating thrill ride one expects from the genre.  Oh there are thrills, all right, but they're the kind that make you laugh out of sheer shock and discomfort or smile a black smile at the twisted self-aggrandizing swagger of arguably the greatest onscreen villain of all time (more on that later).  ""The Dark Knight"" is a turbo-charged crime drama filled with a blackness that is not necessarily of, by, or from it's villains, but from human nature itself.  The willingness of people to forgo their morality and principles for the sake of perceived security (extreme political relevance alert) and to turn on each other for the sake of personal safety, revenge, or just to have somebody to scapegoat.  When the chips are down, we are all sick individuals just waiting for an excuse to scratch that itch.  Or so Batman's nemesis would say.  The Joker didn't invent madness, he has simply perfected it as a weapon. ""I'm not a monster"", he insists at one point, ""I'm just ahead of the curve.""""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"" is another of the many lines in this film that are destined to become classics in the annals of comic filmdom.  That saying holds true throughout the events of ""The Dark Knight"".  While The Batman continues his underground war on crime -with some unwanted help from a gang of gun-toting copycat vigilantes- Gotham City's new hotshot District Attorney Harvey Dent is hailed as the city's White Knight.  By contrast, he is taking down the mob by the book, using the law to it's full extent to battle crime legally even as Batman continues to take justice into his own hands.  Impressed, Bruce Wayne -along with police chief Jim Gordon- throws his support behind Dent and hails him as the hero Gotham needs; one with a face.  To complicate matters, Dent is dating Wayne's old sweetheart, Rachel Dawes.  As the three (four?) very different crime fighters pool their resources, a new criminal is working over the mob his own way.  He doesn't want money, he doesn't want power, he's just got lint and knives in his pockets, and all he needs to rob this city of it's very soul is some gasoline and -borrowing from his favorite crimefighter- some theatrics of his own.So the good, then.  Heath Ledger is the one part of this film that lives up to the hype in every way.  This is not the lovably twisted loon of the classicThe Animated Series, nor is he the hysterical cold-blooded maniac of the comics, and he sure isn't the wonderfully cartoonish murderer thatJack Nicholsongave us all those years ago. This is The Joker as he has never been portrayed before; no electrocuting joy-buzzer, no acid-squirting corsage, sadly not even a trace of his trademark toxin that causes it's victims to laugh themselves to death.  In spite of these and other omissions from the character's storied history, I did not mind a bit because this character is utterly captivating as he is.  Ledger combined an often dry delivery, a vile and scraggly appearance, a black sense of humor, and a series of unnerving mannerisms to recreate an old legend as a new one.  Every scene a classic; the audience laughed out loud, they clapped, they cringed, they could not take their eyes off of this character for a minute, as though they were in the same room with this maniac and were afraid of what he might do if they looked away.  That is the very definition of a masterful performance.  The core of this character is complete: a psychotic killer who takes inspiration from Batman to create chaos where others would have order.  Murderous, unpredictable, bold, always a step ahead of everyone else, and oozing contempt for mankind's attempts at civility this man is.  The Batman or anyone else has little choice but to sink to his level to stop him, and that is exactly what he wants in the end.  The Joker wants every supposed hero in Gotham to become, in a sense, a villain and will use any means to accomplish that end. Meanwhile, turning the finest citizens of Gotham against each other is just an amusing bonus.  There's a reason the name ""Batman"" isn't in this film's title.  This is not his movie.The rest of the cast is an ensemble that drive the story whenever Ledger isn't onscreen.  Gary Oldman: legend. No actor is better at disappearing into his character (Jim Gordon in this case).  Morgan Freeman: legend. Like Wolverine, he's the best as what he does.  Christian Bale: brilliant as Bruce Wayne but not always convincing in cape and cowl.  Maggie Gyllenhaal: not as cute as Katie Holmes, but a convincing performance as a woman torn between two heroes.  Aaron Eckhart: a great underdog performance as Harvey Dent.  In fact, one could argue that the most compelling sequence of events involves The Joker's words and actions both directly and indirectly transforming Harvey Dent's harmless fascination with chance into a malignant entity in and of itself that only needs a violent shove to manifest itself.  After all, chance doesn't discriminate -the plotters and schemers, the politicians, lawyers, and criminals do that.  What better way to wash your hands of an act you know is wrong than leave it all up to fair an balanced chance?  The twin brother of chance: chaos.  Thus Joker gains a new partner in crime.  Duplicity is another central theme of ""The Dark Knight"".  How many comic book films get that deep?Now the bad.  The film feels too short.  Yeah, I said it: this story is too much for a mere 2 1/2 hours.  The action scenes are rushed through without an afterthought, The Scarecrow's cameo is nigh-meaningless where it could have been really cool, the cell-phone sonar bit -while ingenious- was overdone and got annoying during the film's climax, Batman himself gets short-shrifted and comes off as less than heroic at times (crashing your motorcycle, dude?  Come on!), the variety of twists may cause one's head to spin, and there is so much more depth in the Batman/Joker relationship that wasn't even touched upon. That last one is not so much a problem with the film as it is lamenting the passing of Ledger.  Awful business; I'd make a pencil disappear myself to see him reprise the role. The movie's ending really left me cold as well.  Five or ten more minutes to wrap things up would have done wonders and the conclusion of Batman's story was needlessly downbeat, as though Nolan was concerned that saving the day would ruin a perfectly depressing film. Don't get me wrong; I love the purported hopelessness of this film, but the messages in this movie are very mixed at times.  For example: was Nolan advocating Bush's unconscionable wire-tapping program or suggesting that individual people with the capabilities to do something wrong to accomplish something right should take it upon themselves? An interesting argument, but not as eloquently handled here as I would have liked.  Need to re-watch.If you made it all the way through my ramblings, I congratulate and heartily embrace you.  ""The Dark Knight"" did not live up to my impossible expectations and is not in my opinion the greatest superhero film of all time.  It is however, the most ambitious and broadest in scope, and for that I will applaud it until my hands hurt.  The boldness, blackness, and depth of character should serve as an example for the next film which I hope will keep it simple and not attempt the nearly impossible task of topping this one for sheer dramatic scale. Don't expect anybody to attempt to play The Joker for a long, long time. There's word of a three-hour director's cut and I plan on waiting for it because I really wanted more of this film that often felt rushed.4 1/2 stars rounded up for being, really, the first film of it's kind.",5,The battle for Gotham City's soul,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,8362,"['Alright', 'so', 'here', 'most', 'anticipated', 'film', 'year', 'Hailed', 'even', 'release', 'superhero', 'movie',

660073,A1DMC0SPWJSF7B,B00005JPY0,Travis Godbold,"[2, 5]","Many say cheesy Dark Knight, is one of the best films in ages, I think 1989's Batman is far better.There's something about Michael Keaton, as Batman, and Jack Nicholson, as the Joker, that just can't be beat with remakes. I've watched all the Batman films, and by far, Batman 1989, is the ideal Batman film.Michael Keaton is the best Batman. First off, Mike looks better in a Batman suit than any other actor, especially Christian Bale. Mike's features are aligned to the suit, while Christian's got this thin face, that makes the rubber kind of protrude out, he appears funny, makes viewers think apparently that the gloves do not fit. Keaton is Batman when we see him in the film. Also Mike's personality is darker, more intellectually savvy, and unique, than Christian Bale's attempts to fit into the character with the later Dark Knight film. Christian just can't pull off the part as good as Mike, even though he tries hard, and in all the latest films he's just a cheesy stereotype. Michael Keaton to me, fits the gloves of Batman, like no other actor in the history of the theme's film presentation.The same can also be said about Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker. Everyone's saying Heath Ledger's Joker is the best to ever grace the screen, but when I saw Dark Knight, I was like, that guy's just reading memorized lines he knows from a script, period, and acting out the part like a stereotype. Jack Nicholson, actually throws life into the character with his unique touch into the twisted personality, he adds a ton of glitz and makes the Joker appear more human, and more psycho in a realistic way. He becomes the Joker like no other actor can emulate on the screen. To me there could be no other Joker.There's so much of the 1989 film that is just stellar film making, including the Joker's crashing into an art museum, his mayhem accompanied by a boombox screaming Prince music, and Batman's whisking Vicky Vale away on a harpoon rope ride, that just can't be outdone. I was raised on this film as a kid growing up. I looked up to Mike's representation of Batman, and from then to even now, even after all the MANY films proceeding it, including ones that made me think, ""Who was crazy enough to produce such one star garbage for the screen"", there to me could not be a movie to outdo 1989's Batman.",2,"Great special effects, but acting, and movie events are cliche",1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,2321,"['Many', 'say', 'cheesy', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ages', 'think', '1989', 'Batman', 'far', 'something', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Batman', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'remakes', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Batman', 'films', 'far', 'Batman', '1989', 'ideal', 'Batman', 'film.Michael', 'Keaton', 'best', 'Batman', 'First', 'Mike', 'better', 'Batman', 'suit', 'other', 'actor', 'especially', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Mike', 'features', 'are', 'aligned', 'suit', 'Christian', 'got', 'thin', 'face', 'rubber', 'kind', 'protrude', 'funny', 'viewers', 'think', 'apparently', 'gloves', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'Keaton', 'Batman', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'Also', 'Mike', 'personality', 'darker', 'more', 'intellectually', 'savvy', 'unique', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'attempts', 'fit', 'character', 'later', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'film', 'Christian', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'part', 'as', 'good', 'Mike', 'even', 'hard', 'latest', 'films', 'just', 'cheesy', 'stereotype', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'gloves', 'Batman', 'other', 'actor', 'history', 'theme', 'film', 'presentation.The', 'same', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'Joker', 'Everyone', 'saying', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'best', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'when', 'saw', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', 'guy', 'just', 'reading', 'memorized', 'lines', 'script', 'period', 'acting', 'out', 'part', 'stereotype', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'actually', 'life', 'character', 'unique', 'touch', 'twisted', 'personality', 'ton', 'glitz', 'Joker', 'appear', 'more', 'human', 'more', 'psycho', 'realistic', 'way', 'Joker', 'other', 'actor', 'can', 'emulate', 'screen', 'could', 'be', 'other', 'Joker.There', 'so', 'much', '1989', 'film', 'just', 'stellar', 'film', 'making', 'including', 'Joker', 'crashing', 'art', 'museum', 'mayhem', 'accompanied', 'boombox', 'screaming', 'Prince', 'music', 'Batman', 'whisking', 'Vicky', 'Vale', 'away', 'harpoon', 'rope', 'ride', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'outdone', 'was', 'raised', 'film', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', 'looked', 'up', 'Mike', 'representation', 'Batman', 'then', 'even', 'now', 'even', 'MANY', 'films', 'proceeding', 'including', 'ones', 'made', 'think', 'Who', 'was', 'crazy', 'enough', 'produce', 'such', 'one', 'star', 'garbage', 'screen', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'outdo', '1989', 'Batman']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
660074,AE3OAGMSGIIUI,B00005JPY0,Travis,"[1, 3]","""The Dark Knight"" is more than a pop culture phenomenon; it is genuinely a great film.  The social implications of extremes such as Batman and The Joker are played out in the battle for Gotham City and Harvey Dent.  Christopher Nolan, along with writers David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan, has crafted a very thoughtful, engaging story chock full of symbolism and nuances.For such a juggernaut of a film, it is truly disappointing that the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD should be so spartan.  There are only two featurettes.  One is generic, and the other is little more than Hans Zimmer telling you how brilliant his two-note Joker theme is.  Otherwise, all you're getting are six Gotham News segments profiling lead characters (interesting, yes, but hardly a definitive bonus feature), three trailers and production stills.

Only three.The two Tim Burton movies were two of the most overrated piles of goat excrement of the 1990's and then Joel Schumacher turned those vile efforts and made it even worse.  I think I saw about fifteen minutes of the one where Robin is running around with George Clooney and vomit tickled into my expensive sofa.How frickin' hard can it be to make a entertaining movie about comic book heroes?  Batman is horrible and Spider Man is equally as horrible.  The old Superman movies by Richard Donner were pretty good...and then they ruined the memories of those by bringing in Richard Pryor and then Heman to battle the Man of Steel.I never saw `Batman Begins' as I saw no reason to.  It just seems like another desperate plea in Hollywood to make a quick buck because the creatives out there have nothing inside of their brains.I don't remember ever hearing anything good, bad or indifferent bout that movie, but `The Dark Knight' certainly got a lot of hype and there's nothing worth watching after combing the new release section at the video store, so I figured I'd check it out.I was VERY surprised as to how much I enjoyed this movie.  Most movies post `Star Wars' in the late 1970's that get all the hype never live up to it...or even come close to living up to it.  This movie does, and even exceeds it, in my opinion.The story is very good.  The cinematography is great (very important for a comic-book-related feature).  It's literally dark, meaning the villains are actually...villainous.  It's violent and it never makes you feel like it's going to end with a pretty little bow tied around it (and it doesn't) like so many other Hollywood productions do.  It's nice to see a movie end with a not so happy ending (still have a long way to go before anything competes with the end of John Carpenter's `The Thing', however).The only reason it's not five star quality is that, after awhile, it gets a little irritating listening to Christian Bale try to talk like Clint Eastwood in `Heartbreak Ridge' and I grew a little tired of all of the coin flipping of Aaron Eckhart's character....but that is really nit-picking, here.Highly recommended and it gives me a little hope for the future.

It builds on what made Batman Begins so great and totally meets all expectations.  The Dark Knight has a strong theme that runs through the whole movie about what it takes to make someone do the evil that we do.  Every character is faced with darkness and how they deal with it.  The choices we make do have consequences.  The only fault I have with The Dark Knight is the Harvey Dent story.  It was integral to the story, but I do not like how it was resolved.  I guess in the grand scale of the story, it makes sense, but the character was basically dismissed once that plot point was over.  Overall, as many have said, this movie was all about The Joker.

660080,A3O1IIU1HUWGY6,B00005JPY0,"truedub74 ""truedub74""","[5, 20]","The Dark Knight is about the Joker and his attempts to prove that hate, anarchy, selfishness and evil is more powerful than good in Gotham City.  I've never been a huge fan of this movie and it's taken me this long to figure out why: the film is a complete downer - which is actually fine - but it's just not entertaining enough to offset its bleakness.  Heath Ledger and his amazing performance IS the movie, and that's kindof the problem.  He's got all the best lines, the best makeup, the best clothes, all the comic relief - everything.  But he's also an evil rotten murderer.  But since no one else in the cast even registers, Ledger and his performace outshines everyone and you end up rooting for him!  After I watch this film I literally feel filthy.  Now, the premise of the flick is sound, and the telling of the story is competent but this movie could have been SO much better and so much more entertaining if they'd cast Viggo Mortensen as the Batman.  Christian Bale is just a cipher: he registers as nothing more than an entity.. a justification, sounding board or counterpoint to the Joker's evil. If the filmmakers would have had the sense to cast Viggo Mortensen as Batman everything would have fallen into place.Think about it: you can see Mortensen as an anti-hero.  He's got the jaw for it; the eyes and the teeth..  If you don't believe me watch the movie A History of Violence and check out the look on his (Mortensen's) face right after his son shotguns Ed Harris's character in the back.  Youtube it right now.  See what I mean?  You can see Mortensen's Dark Knight accidentally killing a bad guy and then going out, getting drunk and puking on his Lamborghini.  Remember that police station interrogation scene?  Where Christian Bale irritates us all by growling and yelling?  Great scene for Joker..  But put Mortensen in the Batman role; You can see his Batman pulling out a butterfly bat-knife and after a mettalic flourish stabbing it into that desk and talking to Joker about removing fingers and perforating nostrils.  I'd like to see Joker go on about 'just want(ing) to make a phone call' after the loss of a digit or two.With a script built around Mortensen as Batman this film would have been so much better! Everything would have been different: The first time we saw Luscious Fox he wouldn't have been going on about the batsuit or whatever.. He might have been giving Bruce Wayne a tattoo.  Maybe a tattoo of Scarecrow - his most recent caught villain.  At that dinner party with Harvey Dent, Bruce wouldn't have shown up with a bunch of blond headed supermodels in evening gowns, he probably have shown up with 3 or 4 brunette and red-headed whores dressed in mild s&m; gear smoking cigarettes and pulling pit-bulls on leather leashes.  Furthermore, the Batpod would have been chromed out and had a smoke screen.  And finally, much as I love Michael Caine, if you cast Mortensen as Batman, Caine would be out and you know who would play Alfred?  Peter O'toole.  A man who was filthy nasty dark down and dirty before most of the rest of the cast was even born.  THAT'S the Dark Knight I would have liked to see.Christian Bale's Batman was always going on about how Harvey Dent was the best one out of all three of them (Dent, Batman and Comm Gordon); I never understood that because in this movie Batman wasn't dark at all.  He pouted alot and growled alot but far as I could tell he was as good and pure a superhero as Gotham City could have asked for.  Bale's Dark Knight wasn't dark at all.  He was too pretty, to clean cut.. too boring to come across as the anti-hero.  For me that's the film's biggest flaw.2 stars.",2,VIGGO MORTENSEN,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,3658,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'Joker', 'attempts', 'prove', 'hate', 'anarchy', 'selfishness', 'evil', 'more', 'powerful', 'good', 'Gotham', 'City', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'movie', 'taken', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'film', 'complete', 'downer', 'actually', 'fine', 'just', 'not', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'offset', 'bleakness', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'amazing', 'performance', 'movie', 'kindof', 'problem', 'got', 'best', 'lines', 'best', 'makeup', 'best', 'clothes', 'comic', 'relief', 'everything', 'also', 'evil', 'rotten', 'murderer', 'one', 'else', 'cast', 'even', 'registers', 'Ledger', 'performace', 'everyone', 'end', 'up', 'rooting', 'watch', 'film', 'literally', 'feel', 'filthy', 'Now', 'premise', 'flick', 'sound', 'telling', 'story', 'competent', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', ""'d"", 'cast', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Batman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'just', 'cipher', 'nothing', 'more', 'entity..', 'justification', 'sounding', 'board', 'counterpoint', 'Joker', 'evil', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'sense', 'cast', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Batman', 'everything', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'place.Think', 'can', 'see', 'Mortensen', 'anti-hero', 'got', 'jaw', 'eyes', 'teeth..', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watch', 'movie', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'check', 'out', 'look', 'Mortensen', 'face', 'right', 'son', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'character', 'back', 'Youtube', 'right', 'now', 'See', 'what', 'mean', 'can', 'see', 'Mortensen', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'accidentally', 'killing', 'bad', 'guy', 'then', 'going', 'out', 'getting', 'drunk', 'puking', 'Lamborghini', 'Remember', 'police', 'station', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'Where', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'growling', 'yelling', 'Great', 'scene', 'Joker..', 'put', 'Mortensen', 'Batman', 'role', 'can', 'see', 'Batman', 'pulling', 'out', 'butterfly', 'bat-knife', 'mettalic', 'flourish', 'stabbing', 'desk', 'talking', 'Joker', 'removing', 'fingers', 'perforating', 'nostrils', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'Joker', 'go', 'about', ""'just"", 'want', 'ing', 'make', 'phone', 'call', 'loss', 'digit', 'two.With', 'script', 'built', 'around', 'Mortensen', 'Batman', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Everything', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Luscious', 'Fox', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'going', 'batsuit', 'whatever..', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'giving', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'tattoo', 'Maybe', 'tattoo', 'Scarecrow', 'most', 'recent', 'caught', 'villain', 'dinner', 'party', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Bruce', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'shown', 'up', 'bunch', 'blond', 'headed', 'supermodels', 'evening', 'gowns', 'probably', 'have', 'shown', 'up', '3', '4', 'brunette', 'red-headed', 'whores', 'dressed', 'mild', 's', 'm', 'gear', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'pulling', 'pit-bulls', 'leather', 'leashes', 'Furthermore', 'Batpod', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'chromed', 'out', 'had', 'smoke', 'screen', 'finally', 'much', 'love', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'cast', 'Mortensen', 'Batman', 'Caine', 'would', 'be', 'out', 'know', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'Alfred', 'Peter', ""O'toole"", 'A', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'filthy', 'nasty', 'dark', 'down', 'dirty', 'most', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'even', 'born', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see.Christian', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'how', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'was', 'best', 'one', 'out', 'three', 'Dent', 'Batman', 'Comm', 'Gordon', 'never', 'understood', 'movie', 'Batman', 'was', ""n't"", 'dark', 'pouted', 'alot', 'growled', 'alot', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'pure', 'superhero', 'Gotham', 'City', 'could', 'have', 'asked', 'Bale', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'was', ""n't"", 'dark', 'was', 'too', 'pretty', 'clean', 'cut..', 'too', 'boring', 'come', 'anti-hero', 'film', 'biggest', 'flaw.2', 'stars']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

660084,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00005JPY0,Turfseer,"[8, 52]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Unlike their first entry in their Batman series, the Nolan brothers juxtapose their comic book characters against a well-lit Chicago urban backdrop--they seem out of place in the real world and would have been much more at home in a make-believe noirish setting.The opening scene urges us not to take any of the antagonists seriously. As a bank robbery unfolds, the criminals end up double-crossing one another, shooting one another in the back. Only Health Ledger's Joker is left standing, collecting all the proceeds from the robbery. From the outset, the Joker faces no obstacles and appears almost omnipotent.The next thirty minutes consists of a series of very slow-moving expository scenes. There's a clash between mobsters and a few Batman wannabes show up (The leader of the wannabes is later captured by the Joker and in a repugnant scene is tortured in a video clip shown on the evening news). Cut to Bruce Wayne's 'Bat Cave' which looks more like a concrete bunker fitted with large high definition computer screens (so much for the neat old Bat Cave!). Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's affable butler has little to do except impart pithy advice to his boss. Then there's the relationship between DA Harvey Dent and his girlfriend Rachel, who Bruce has an interest in (the love triangle never seems to develop).After Dent invokes RICO laws, the mobsters agree to allow one of their own, Lau, a Chinese Mafia accountant from Hong Kong to hold all their cash outside the US where the DA can't get his hands on it. Wayne then makes his way to Hong Kong where Batman manages to break into Lau's impenetrable skyscraper, kidnap him and return him to the DA where he's placed under arrest. Of course, this sideshow has nothing to do with the main plot which involves the Joker approaching the mobsters and agreeing to take half their cash in exchange for killing Batman. After the bosses refuse to go along with the Joker's proposal, one of the bosses, Gambol, puts a bounty on the Joker's head. The Joker then gains easy entry into Gambol's lair in a body bag, only to jump out and then kill the hapless criminal by slashing his throat with a knife (the point is made that the Joker is a sadist and the Nolans appear to congratulate themselves by emphasizing that fact over and over again without regard for good taste or an economical narrative).The rest of the film's extremely convoluted plot mainly concerns the Joker's efforts to eliminate his nemesis, The Dark Knight. The Joker declares if Batman doesn't reveal his identity, people will die each day until he decides to act. When the Police Commissioner and Judge presiding over the mob trials are assassinated, the public blames Batman. DA Dent concocts a plan to draw the Joker out by claiming that he's The Dark Knight. As Dent is transported in an armored car, the Joker attacks but is captured by Batman aided by Lt. Gordon who is soon promoted to police commissioner as a result of his heroic efforts in capturing the Joker.We never see how it happens but Dent and Rachel disappear and soon turn up as hostages at a warehouse. Batman gets a little rough with the Joker in jail and it's revealed that some corrupt police officials (they seem to be all over the place) were the ones who kidnapped the DA and his girlfriend. It turns out that one of the Joker's associates who he was imprisoned with has a cell phone implanted in his chest (don't know why he wasn't put through a metal detector) and when the phone rings, there's a huge explosion and the Joker and Lau both escape. Batman is able to save the DA but is unable to rescue Rachel. Despite surviving an explosion Dent's face is maimed and now he becomes the second villain of the movie, 'Two Face'.The unlikeable Joker proves even less charming when he declares he has no interest in money and torches Lau who is tied up in a warehouse on top of a giant pile of cash. Then in the most ludicrous part of the movie, the Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to take revenge on all the corrupt people responsible for Rachel's death. How the good guy DA could morph into a sinister criminal so easily just proves how silly the whole story is (instead of honoring his girlfriend's memory, he too conveniently becomes a bad guy!).The finale features a bunch of convicts and upstanding citizens held hostage on two separate ferry boats. The boats are rigged with explosives (how did they get on the boats undetected?). Each person on the ferries have the ability to set off the explosions but out of the goodness of everybody's hearts, no one can bring themselves to act.Finally, in the most distasteful scene in the movie, Dent attempts to kill Commissioner Gordon's son by throwing him over the side of a building. The killing of a child is not something that should be shown in a story that's supposedly taken from a comic book.Despite the absurd, overlong plot, The Dark Knight wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers didn't take themselves so seriously. Did they really have to rehash their point ad infinitum--that criminals are sadistic? Somehow a little humor could have humanized all the comic book characters and made the film a lot more enjoyable. Instead, the Dark Knight is an example of lazy screen writing where there is no interest in explaining one implausible event after another.",1,Convoluted plot and lack of humor sinks overlong exercise

It has an epic and profound scale compared to his other movies.  Creating a Batman sequel and introducing Harvey Dent and The Joker is an extremely hard task.  But Nolan did the best job out of anyone out there who is qualified.  I don't know if anyone will ever surpass a Batman film in quality, even Chris Nolan for that matter.  The movie struck awe in America and we felt our benchmarks for films raising as we watched it.The film itself has an amazing twisted story.  The plot was definately worked on again and again and again.  After my second viewing more information was revealed to me, so it is a lot to take in.  This story is the ultimate tragedy and we find ourselves with the ultimate villains.Our actors could not have been better.  I usually dislike actor changes but Maggie Gyllenhaal  fit into the film very nicely.  Harvey Dent couldn't have had a more fitting actor.  Eckhart really impressed me this time through.  When he went through his transformation he really felt the angst of Dent.  Our returning actors surpassed their entry into the first film, but I won't delve into that so much.Our one actor that brought something new and shocking was Heath Ledger.  It is heartbreaking that he passed after the film and I am extremely upset that Warner Bros. refused to make light of it on the DVD.  Yes it would be upsetting for some people to remember that sad day.  BUT HEATH LEDGER SHOULD BE REMEMBERED.  We should see him as his normal self backstage to make ourselves feel better.  We got nothing about his performance.  You don't heal wounds by ignoring them!  In order for America to accept his death we have to see him.  And acknowledge that he existed.But I digress, other than that criticism I think the Blu-Ray Dvd looks amazing.  The Imax filming is perfect.  Special features might not impress a lot of people but I enjoyed them for what they were.  I would rather have more, but beggers can't be choosers.  The film itself doesn't need special features to beef its sales.Bottom Line: Everyone should have a copy of this.  Whether its DVD or Blu-Ray.  It is a landmark in movie history.  And we should all give respect to Ledger's performance and to all the other people who worked day and night to make this film extrodinary.  Thank you Chris Nolan.

Forget Spiderman, or even Superman. Everything pales in comparisson. The reason the film did so well is because it is not so unbelievable as it could have been. The emotions were real, the characters felt real and most importantly, Batman is not your typical superhero. He has no powers that are extraordinary or special. He made himself into what he is and that is the difference between this saga and all the wannabees.Once again, the acting makes the film, and this is no exception. Bale, Oldman, and of course Ledger are the reason this movie is so wonderful. You end up loving the characters, whether in a good way or not. Everyone just does a fantastic job and by the end you just want it to continue, to see and to know more about each character. This is not the type of film that after it's over, you just shrug and walk away. No, it leaves an impression behind and you can't help but think about it long after the viewing.The plot is a bit tricky to put into words and requires more than viewing to really appreciate all that is going on, but it really is a rich and engaging story that will probably feel as fresh ten years from now. This is more than a comic book movie, this is a drama/action/crime film all in one.

660092,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00005JPY0,V. Berk,"[5, 9]","The Dark Knight achieves greatness in ways that will leave the audience dazzled, and overwhelmed.  Christopher Nolan has made a film that I can't even place within the superhero genre.Since Batman Begins major changes have rushed through Gotham City.  Criminals hide from the streets at night, preferring to hold their meetings in the safety of light, and the citizens begin to stand up to and fight the mob that controls their city.  The source of these changes is no other then the dark vigilante, Batman.The film opens with a great bank heist scene, where thugs wearing clown masks begin to rob a Mob bank, systematically killing one and other once an individual loses his worth in the job.  It seems that the good that was started by Bruce Wayne's alter-ego has also brought the bad, in the form of a psychotic criminal mastermind who goes by the name ""Joker"".The Joker, played by the late Heath Ledger is without a doubt the shining performance of this magnificent film, providing moviegoers and fans of the Batman comics of recent years a dark, twisted, truly psychotic Joker.  This is the first time the Joker's twisted character has been brought to the big screen.As the movie goes on The Joker takes advantage of the mob in its time of desperation, with the promise that he can kill Batman, for half of their entire joint fortune.  Pressured by bold actions by the people of Gotham, Batman and rising ""White Knight, District Attorney Harvey Dent the mob leaders give into the crazed individual's demands.Armed with a large array of knives, make-up and a costume suit The Joker begins to terrorize the streets of Gotham, with a promise of killing until Batman reveals his true identity.  The Joker, who lives without rules soon, obtains a strong hold over the people of Gotham with his unpredictable antics. The political powers that people trust just don't have the power to overcome a man who doesn't even have a rule book of his own to follow.  Ultimately Batman must face off with this foe and be forced to choose between breaking his ""One rule"" and letting The Joker win, or overcoming this Harlequin of Hate who preys on the weak, turning them into agents of chaos.Every-single actor in this film is worth noting, not a single supporting cast member doesn't get in his/her moments, the most notable being Morgan Freemen, Aaron Eckhart, and Michael Caine.  The art direction, sets and overall feel of the film captures a perfect balance that makes these characters who have frequented comic pages for over sixty years seem very real.That's what makes this film great, and that is not a super hero film, it is a crime film that examines and studies human emotion and morals to an extent that very few movies have done in previous years.The fact that it mixes a deep plot in with things a mainstream audience appreciates, such as the action sequences, shows that it is perhaps the best film of the last ten years, and certainly succeeds where all other super hero films have failed.Without a doubt The Dark Knight is a great achievement in cinema and will be a classic.  That being said, this film is not for those with small children.  The plot is incredibly dark, and will no doubt haunt the nightmares of a majority of children under the age of thirteen, so I can not warn parents enough that this is not for the kiddies.  Even parents, who think their child can handle grotesque imagery, keep in mind that the plot is very complicated and probably won't be comprehended by young ones.My recommendation for parents who want to introduce Batman to their kids is the animated series from the 1990s and its theatrical movie `Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'.  There you can get Batman's dark undertones, without much need to worry for the child's well being, and they're enjoyable for all age groups.The Dark Knight = 10/10 Stars",5,The Dark Knight - Film Event of the Summer,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,3837,"['Dark', 'Knight', 'greatness', 'ways', 'will', 'leave', 'audience', 'dazzled', 'overwhelmed', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'made', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'place', 'superhero', 'genre.Since', 'Batman', 'major', 'changes', 'have', 'rushed', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Criminals', 'hide', 'streets', 'night', 'preferring', 'hold', 'meetings', 'safety', 'light', 'citizens', 'begin', 'stand', 'up', 'fight', 'mob', 'city', 'source', 'changes', 'other', 'then', 'dark', 'vigilante', 'Batman.The', 'film', 'great', 'bank', 'heist', 'scene', 'where', 'thugs', 'wearing', 'clown', 'masks', 'begin', 'rob', 'Mob', 'bank', 'systematically', 'killing', 'one', 'other', 'once', 'individual', 'worth', 'job', 'good', 'was', 'started', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'alter-ego', 'also', 'brought', 'bad', 'form', 'psychotic', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'who', 'name', 'Joker', '.The', 'Joker', 'played', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'doubt', 'shining', 'performance', 'magnificent', 'film', 'providing', 'moviegoers', 'fans', 'Batman', 'comics', 'recent', 'years', 'dark', 'twisted', 'truly', 'psychotic', 'Joker', 'first', 'time', 'Joker', 'twisted', 'character', 'been', 'brought', 'big', 'screen.As', 'movie', 'Joker', 'advantage', 'mob', 'time', 'desperation', 'promise', 'can', 'kill', 'Batman', 'half', 'entire', 'joint', 'fortune', 'Pressured', 'bold', 'actions', 'people', 'Gotham', 'Batman', 'rising', 'White', 'Knight', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'mob', 'leaders', 'give', 'crazed', 'individual', 'demands.Armed', 'large', 'array', 'knives', 'make-up', 'costume', 'suit', 'Joker', 'terrorize', 'streets', 'Gotham', 'promise', 'killing', 'Batman', 'true', 'identity', 'Joker', 'who', 'rules', 'soon', 'strong', 'hold', 'people', 'Gotham', 'unpredictable', 'antics', 'political', 'powers', 'people', 'trust', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'power', 'overcome', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'rule', 'book', 'own', 'follow', 'Ultimately', 'Batman', 'must', 'face', 'off', 'foe', 'be', 'forced', 'choose', 'breaking', 'One', 'rule', 'letting', 'Joker', 'win', 'overcoming', 'Harlequin', 'Hate', 'who', 'preys', 'weak', 'turning', 'agents', 'chaos.Every-single', 'actor', 'film', 'worth', 'noting', 'not', 'single', 'supporting', 'cast', 'member', ""n't"", 'get', 'his/her', 'moments', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'Morgan', 'Freemen', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'art', 'direction', 'sets', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'perfect', 'balance', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'frequented', 'comic', 'pages', 'sixty', 'years', 'seem', 'very', 'real.That', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'not', 'super', 'hero', 'film', 'crime', 'film', 'examines', 'studies', 'human', 'emotion', 'morals', 'extent', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'previous', 'years.The', 'fact', 'deep', 'plot', 'things', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'appreciates', 'such', 'action', 'sequences', 'perhaps', 'best', 'film', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'certainly', 'where', 'other', 'super', 'hero', 'films', 'have', 'failed.Without', 'doubt', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'great', 'achievement', 'cinema', 'will', 'be', 'classic', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'not', 'small', 'children', 'plot', 'incredibly', 'dark', 'will', 'doubt', 'haunt', 'nightmares', 'majority', 'children', 'age', 'thirteen', 'can', 'not', 'warn', 'parents', 'enough', 'not', 'kiddies', 'Even', 'parents', 'who', 'think', 'child', 'can', 'handle', 'grotesque', 'imagery', 'keep', 'mind', 'plot', 'very', 'complicated', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'comprehended', 'young', 'ones.My', 'recommendation', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'introduce', 'Batman', 'kids', 'animated', 'series', '1990s', 'theatrical', 'movie', 'Batman', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'can', 'get', 'Batman', 'dark', 'undertones', 'much', 'need', 'worry', 'child', 'well', 'being', ""'re"", 'enjoyable', 'age', 'groups.The', 'Dark', 'Knight', '=', '10/10', 'Stars']",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release

He also smacks his lips a lot as a natural consequence of having had his mouth slashed--the salivary glands are out of control.

660102,A2R1ZCS1UEVJYD,B00005JPY0,Warheart,"[6, 11]","Here it is, ""The Dark Knight"". Christopher Nolan's epic tour de force of action, drama, and the inner workings of the human psyche. Oh, and it's a sequel to Nolan's other Batman flick, ""Batman Begins"" too. ""The Dark Knight"" picks up about 6 months or so (maybe even a year) after the events of ""Batman Begins"". Batman with the help of Lt. Gordon and the newly elected district attorney Harvey Dent have been cleaning up the streets of Gotham City. BUT there's a problem. There's a new guy in town and he goes by the name the Joker. As teased at the end of ""Batman Begins"", the Joker has come to Gotham and all hell breaks loose. The Joker's mission is simple (yet complex): to challenge the limits of Batman. Batman follows a moral code, he doesn't allow anyone's life to be at stake unless it's his and he won't kill. The Joker knows this and unless Batman reveals himself, people will die. It is here that we have the best film of 2008 and one of the best films in recent years. We finally have a Batman film that gives what we want and more: a great story, action, drama, romance, and the performances of a a life time (cough-Heath Ledger-cough). So, there's no point in me going into the whole film so let's break it down into 2 sections: the film itself and this 2-disc DVD (which I'll also provide info on the Blu Ray edition).THE FILM:Pros:*Great story*Emotionally filled and action packed*Memorable performances from Christian Bale and Heath Ledger*An amazing score from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard (should have won the Oscar!!!)*An overall epic film unmatched by any other film of last year*Heath Ledger as the Joker*An ending like no other*Some truly amazing scenes and dialogueCons:*How can we continue the Joker if Ledger is dead?My Rating: 5/5, 100%, 11/10THE DVD REVIEW:Here is the 2-disc edition of ""The Dark Knight"". Here, you'll find the amazing movie on Disc 1 and the Special Features with Digital Copy on Disc 2. The special features are very lacking. There's only 2 behind the scenes features on here entitled ""Uncovering Gotham: Creation of a Scene"". One video is about the creation of the Joker's theme and the other is about the creation and design of the Batpod and the new Batsuit. All together it runs at about 24 minutes. THAT'S IT!!! Then there's 6 episodes of ""Gotham Tonight"" which helps bridge ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" and unless you saw these online or on Comcast in the months preceding ""The Dark Knight"", it's not much to fun. Then there's the 3 trailers and 2 photo galleries. Oh, and there's also the 6 IMAX scenes which is kinda pointless on DVD. The Blu Ray edition features all of those and more. The ""Creation of a Scene"" feature is actually about 11 videos on Blu Ray and offer inside looks into the creation of many of the stunts, explosions and such. It's really cool. Also, there's two Blu Ray exclusive videos, ""Psychology of the Dark Knight"", which goes into the mind of Bruce Wayne and his enemies, and ""Batman Tech"", which goes over some of Batman's hottest gadgets as seen in ""The Dark Knight"". Plus, there's more galleries and tv spots plus a hidden trailer easter egg. Oh, and the IMAX scenes are integrated into the film itself so you'll notice those scenes fill your screen and look amazing!! And really, no videos about how they crafted the Joker and Two Face?

If you grew up thinking of the Joker from the campy '60's TV show as played by the late Caesar Romero, get that out of your mind. If you thought of the Joker from Jack Nicholson's solid performance from the '89 film, forget that one as well.  Ledger does more than both of the previous two actors did with the Joker by making him scary, funny, psychotic, weird, and strange, all at the same time! Ledger also makes Christian Bale give one of the best performances in his career, because Bale had to match Ledger's scary charismatic Joker whenever Ledger was on the screen or not; Bale went toe to toe with Ledger, and he did well. It's a shame that Bale has never been nominated for an Academy Award: that is a bit odd in itself.The Blu ray version of this movie is miles ahead of the DVD version I bought when the movie came out on DVD, the audio is crisp, clean, and you don't hear any distortion.

660110,A1DORQXHAAR8J9,B00005JPY0,"William H. Kelsey ""seeker of truth""","[80, 144]","I know that because of Heath's untimely and highly tragedic (for his young daughter and family) death we all are supposed to be blown away by his Joker and this film in general. Sad to say, I was less than overwhelmed. Anyone who has studied acting knows that you don't play the ""crazy role"" at full blast the entire time. It becomes tiresome and overbearing on your audience. Unfortunately, this is exactly what Mr. Ledger did. While his Joker was light years above Nickleson's in terms of being a truly threatening criminal mastermind, I never understood the real reason why he was so determined to enslave Gotham City. Nickleson's Joker had pretty clear cut goals and motives; Ledger's seems to simply be a Loki type character that, while his story began interestingly enough, was not enough to carry a rather mediocre film and never really drew me in. People compared Ledger's Joker to Hannibal Lector, to me this is blasphemy. Lector has so many layers and so much depth that we never even scratch the surface of who he truly is at the core. The Joker never becomes that enigmatic and thus this viewer was never really drawn in or motivated enough to care what happens to the character or how he was created. An abused child? Sorry, that tale, while incredibly sad, is not enough to make me believe that it would transform someone into a being would wants to destroy everything civilized in favour of chaos.Speaking of unbelievable, the Harvey Dent character was probably the worst offender of this film in that regard. I don't care how much you love someone or how much life sucks because someone deformed you, you're not going to go from being Mr. Moral to threatening the murder of an innocent child whose father didn't even have anything to do with Rachel's death. Why not simply kill the freak who actually did it? Why believe the Joker, the one who you know has caused all of your pain, over someone who tried his best to help save you and your girl? It made no sense.Lastly, I loved Bale in ""Batman Begins"". He is the one and only Batman that I have ever liked or would believe as the character (who was the genius who came up wth the idea of casting Mr. Mom as Batman? Seriously, that was a crime against humanity). Michael Caine, as always, was excellent as Alfred and I really liked Morgan Freeman and his Michael Moore stance on wiretapping, but Bale was not used well here. His voice was beyond ridiculous, and it was pretty obvious that the director only cared about presenting one character in this film. It should had been called ""The Joker"", because this film has little to do with Batman. I wasn't thrilled with Maggie, but if Katie Holmes, like Vin Diesil, wishes to wreck her career by bowing out of blockbuster sequels in favour of straight to dvd quality films that no one sees then that's her business.To close, in my opinion had Heath not died shortly after production this film would never had received the kind of attention and praise that it did. It sounds cruel, but Heath's dying is the only thing that truly had the critics buzzing. No one wishes to speak ill of the dead. To me, this was not the deep psychological ride that everyone made it out to be and I was grossly disappointed. I know that people will write that I'm a twit and can't appreciate the depth of the film, but it simply rang hollow for me. The Joker's challenges were nothing new; there are four ""Saw"" films that use the exact same set up to show humanity's inner depravity when push comes to shove.

The rest of the time he stands around befuddled, delivering dialog that makes you want to run your cat's claws across a black board.And Heath?  Oscar nomination?  Please, everyone calm down and get a grip.  Every Joker scene is repetitive -- there is no depth of acting -- he does the exact same slobbering delivery in each scene.  At most, his Joker characterization is annoying.  To say the least, it is boring.And the action scenes?  Predictable.  Say what you will about the Mission Impossible series, but their actions scenes always carried an element of excitement and surprise.  The Dark Knight actions scenes are routine, and carry an element of looking at your watch and yawning.  Proof:  The two ferry boats scene.  Did you care in the least which boat blew-up?

660114,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B00005JPY0,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[103, 131]","Rarely has a film left me speechless, much less a comic book inspired film. Christopher Nolan's rendition of the DC comic character has. ""THE DARK KNIGHT"" may well be the best comic book film I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan, along with Jonathan Nolan has crafted a screenplay of nearly unbelievable proportions. The duo has taken the ""Batman"" mythos and has turned it into their own; what results is a film that captures the essence of the comic book and combines it to a truly gripping and engaging psychological crime drama-action-adventure. You heard that right, a psychological crime drama and an adventure.I'll get right to the point, you don't need to read any reviews, (including this one) just watch this film. It stomps Burton's rendition of the caped crusader to the ground and MAY well eat ""Batman Begins"" for breakfast, lunch and dinner; all the more evolving the concept of Gotham City's ""Dark Knight"".Still here, no trust? Ok then, here we go...Gotham City is the battle ground. The mysterious ""Batman"" has the crime element by its ear. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is an incorruptible force in court and Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) has his special unit to combat crime. Seems like a good time to be in Gotham, doesn't it? Wrong.A mysterious ""Joker"" (Heath Ledger) has surfaced and seemed poised to take Gotham's soul by creating mass hysteria and chaos. Gotham's population is at the mercy of this madman--and what does he want? To prove a point.Christopher Nolan has impressed me before, with his films; ""The Prestige"" and ""Memento"". But never as much this time around. The director has abandoned the idea that ""Batman"" has to have a comic book feel. The film goes for the comic book's soul. Nolan is armed with a near flawless script that exudes the spirit of Gotham City as well as its Dark Angel. If there are any holes in it then I cannot see it. The movie is unstoppable, the direction it went is awe-inspiring that it nearly gave me goose bumps. The movie not only portrays the usual Batman vs. Joker main event, it also defines the meaning of the word ""hero"" as well as the morality that surrounds the idea.""The Dark Knight"" has a lot of characters and the film develops each one. No one is a plot device, everyone has a purpose in the screenplay. Heath Ledger gives the performance of his career (Rest in Peace, Heath) and trumps Nicholson's portrayal. Ledger's ""Joker"" is very reminiscent of the Joker in the comic book ""The Killing Joke"". The maniac is not after money, he has no grand scheme but he wants to prove a point. This Joker isn't joking around, this villain is frighteningly twisted, maniacal and homicidal. Ledger performs as if he saw the adage: ""Crazy people don't know they're crazy"" and brings all to bear. There's no ""origin"" as to where he came from, although his past is suggested by his quippy remarks. The Joker will remain an enigma in this film, and I think it's a very smart move to do so. Christian Bale is still a great Bruce Wayne and as his cowled alter-go. Bale changes his voice to a raspy one when he is Batman.  Aaron Eckhart is an intriguing Harvey Dent, the district attorney is charismatic, heroic and the embodiment of Gotham's hope, until he--well, has a very bad day. Yes, Two-Face makes an appearance and not to worry, the character won't be one-dimensional.The film's success is that the plot has attained a life of its own. The characters can breathe and everything has a purpose. The film's main premise is not limited to our two nemeses. Even Gotham City itself has become a character in the movie as well as its inhabitants. Gotham is portrayed as a melting pot of chaos and disorder and one nudge towards the wrong direction may unbalance the city's moral fiber. Yes, the film has its bit of morality in it and explores the decency of everyday folk. Before, in ""Batman Begins"" James Gordon and Bruce's lost love Rachel (played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal) embodied this idea, but the concept is more widely expressed this time around. The Joker's target is the soul of Gotham and never more has the stakes been this high. The Mantle of the Bat is by itself a separate entity from Bruce and the concept is even given more depth, just what it means and what it is.The movie still has the tank-like Batmobile and a newer version of a Bat-cycle or in this case, a ""Bat-Pod"". The mantle of the Bat has undergone some updates to make it lighter but for me, it looked bulkier. Tim Burton's rendition of the Bat-suit may have the edge over this one but none are more accurate than the Bat suit in the fan film: `Batman Dead End"". If the film had a fault, is that the fight sequences need some smoothening up. They're not bad, it's just that it's not as hard-hitting as I would've liked and the camera work needs to hang back a little bit so the audience can see the fight a little more. The action sequences itself are exciting, the movie does have some very cool car chases which are intense and adrenaline-pumping; further complemented by Hans Zimmer's very powerful soundtrack. The proceedings have that somber but intimidating ""dark"" feel that the film's cinematographer needs to be commended. The visuals are great, the CGI doesn't look they're CGI  at all.There are cleverly placed bits of humor that help the film's pace. Alfred (Michael Caine) supplies the sarcasm that is reminiscent of his character. The sarcastic exchanges between him and Wayne give a lot of depth to their relationship. Morgan Freeman reprises his role as Lucius Fox and his character has a humorous exchange in sarcasm with a Wayne Enterprises employee. Fox also serves a significant role as a man who serves as Bruce's conscience almost as much as Alfred. Even ""The Joker"" adds some twisted bits of black humor--""I have a magic trick.."", boy, what a way to add an exclamation point to his character. The bits of humor help the film balance its darkness towards its gripping build-up to its end game.BATMAN is a dark character and he is arguably the most interesting character in DC's line of comic books. The man is an enigma and very mysterious. Obsessed? Crazy? a Genius? This man is an urban legend and Nolan and company has successfully represented all these factors. Ledger's performance may have taken the spotlight since this is his last film and he does somewhat steal the show from Bale--from Bale not the character itself.I'm not exactly sure how Christopher Nolan will be able to top this film. The promise of things to come and its climax has such an impact the way everything was structured through its storytelling. Comic book fans have a reason to rejoice, the director has taken the Batman myth to new heights. ""The Dark Knight"" is epic, deliciously exciting, unforgettable, groundbreaking, scary and manages to put the audience in the middle of the struggle between Gotham's Dark Knight and his arch-nemesis; The Joker. The film is very sincere and precise in its execution.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!

""W.T.""","[3, 7]","The Dark Knight is EASILY the best movie of the year and is the best superhero movie ever done (without a serious 2nd choice even worthy of consideration).  This is a very deep, very dark, psychologically disturbing nightmare transferred to film.  Heath Ledger's maniacal performance as the Joker is chilling.The closest film I can compare The Dark Knight to is A Clockwork Orange, except with a more structured plot.  There is a feel of anarchy for the sake of anarchy in the tactics of the Joker, so it reminds one of that earlier classic, but the difference is that while the Joker is clearly insane and full of love for chaos, he's also the smartest character in the film, and nothing happens from beginning to end that deviates from his carefully planned script.  That's the profound irony of the Joker.  And that's the most disturbing part of all.Fair warning.  DON'T let kids under 13 see this movie unless they are VERY emotionally mature.

660121,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JPY0,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 5]","In Christopher Nolan's first interpretation of the Caped Crusader, ""Batman Begins"", he hints at the notion that Batman will always be a controversial or vigilante figure, never fully accepted by society-at-large.  In this film, that theme is explored in-depth, as Batman comes face-to-face with his most difficult challenge: stopping a figure, The Joker, who is more like The Bat then Bruce Wayne (or, in turn, the audience) wants to admit.The central theme of this film, then, has the marvelously insane Joker (played brilliantly by the late Heath Ledger) pitted against our ""heroic"" Batman.  Of course, things are not that black and white.  As the movie begins, with Batman leading the police force's effort to crack down on mob crime, this creates a back-lash of sorts that makes Batman responsible for every nefarious deed committed by the Joker.  The conundrum is this: Although Batman created The Joker through vigilante methods, those same vigilante methods are the only way to stop the cackling madman.Essentially, every scene in this film is either a sight to behold, or gripping emotional drama.  Any scene featuring Ledger's Joker is brilliant, while Christian Bale takes his Wayne/Batman character up a notch in intensity from the first film.  The penultimate confrontation between the two will have you on the edge of your seat.  The action scenes are also a notch better than Nolan's first effort, as they are filmed with IMAX cameras that lend themselves to incredible, sprawling action.Finally, the ensemble cast featuring Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman are spot-on in their respective roles.If you are at all a fan of superhero movies, I can nearly guarantee that this film will top your list after viewing.  Even if you typically don't care for this genre, the acting is so tremendous, the action is so riveting, and the drama is so thought-provoking that you will feel like you just watched an Oscar-worthy masterpiece.

People are duped. DK's story and subplots add up to nothing more than a convoluted, unoriginal, non-sensible mess in no better shape than the Joker's face.The biggest plot problem is that DK fundamentally contradicts Batman Begins (a mediocre effort at best.)  In BB, on his return to Gotham, Bruce Wayne picks Bat as a symbol of hope for his beloved city because a symbol can not be corrupted.  In DK Bruce takes a 180 degree turn and intends to pass on his legacy to a District Attorney, who has been ridiculed as ""Two Face"" in police inner circle even before he turns to the real ""Two Face.""  It is preposterous that Batman would tarnish the Bat symbol to save the DA's ""good"" name at the end of the film.In BB, Batman was well trained in Martial Arts.  He loses his footing so easily when combating the Joker.Why does Commissioner Gordon fake his death, putting his family thru all the grief? It serves no purpose since it is really the DA pretending as Batman drawing out the Joker (in a long and boring car chase sequence, that has been done to death).What are the chances of all the mobsters in town use the same Chinese accountant to wash their money?  Would anybody in his right mind dare to move mobs monies without telling them first?  What are the mobs doing in the film anyway?  The Joke does not seem to need them and their monies since he knows about everything about everyone.  The entire mob subplot should have been cut.This brings me to the Joker.  What's with this Joker.  One moment he wants to kill Batman.  The next, he does not want to, because Batman completes him (what is this, Jerry Maquire?)  In the end, he prides himself for turning the Gotham DA into ""Two Face.""  Is that a such great accomplishment after all the troubles?  If I hear once more ""do you know how I got the scars?"" I will cut him myself.I would forgive and forget all these plot holes and inconsistencies if DK were exciting (like last years Transformers).  DK is as dreadful as a summer blockbuster can get.  I bet that Christopher Nolan has this secret agenda to destroy the grand summer popcorn action film tradition.  Nolan should not be given more than $500,000 budget for a film.  He should return to indie roots where he belongs.Fellow Amazoners, you can go ahead and vote this review unhelpful if you want to.  I have said my piece.  Unlike Alfred so patronizingly put it that Gotham deserves something better than the Truth, I think you deserve nothing less than the Truth, which is that Dark Knight is a stinker!",1,"Dark Knight is a joke!

Hmmm..another painted specter died within site of a films release. Brandon Lee and The Crow. A far better picture than this one. While Ledger's performance was good, it was far from the legendary status everyone is bestowing upon it. If he had not died The Dark Knight may very well have slid into sequel oblivion. Minus the first star.I loved Batman Begins. I avoided this one due to the fact that sequels are usually much less intelligent than the debut. This, while not as awful as Pirates of the Carribean and its ilk being to cute for its own good still became to familiar with its characters. Minus another star.The reason I had avoided this to begin with...Maggie Gyllenhaaaallll. Not even after a case of cheap beer. Katie Holmes is not perfect but Maggie is butt ugly. Only Zellwiger or Barrymore would have been worse. Her character was not at all in line with the Rachel portryed in Begins. Katie Holmes opted for a lame chick flick rather that stick with this. I guess she is as nutty as her husband. Minus two more stars for the choice of Gylenggaalllll.I have to leave one star, so I will not say anything else negative. There are some positives..though not enough to reclaim a star. Cinematography was killer. Wow scene in Hong Kong. Michael Caine is always great. I await the next installment and pray that the spirit a Rachel does not return to nauseate me.
