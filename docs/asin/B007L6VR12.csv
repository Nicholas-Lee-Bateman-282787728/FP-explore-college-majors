1533457,A3BHHSORGTDW8K,B007L6VR12,A customer,"[1, 1]","Best described as one part ""A Christmas Story"", one part ""Stand By Me"", and one part ""Lord of the Flies"", with an extra helping of young estrogen from newcomer Kara Hayward to help balance out all of the snakes and snails and puppy-dog tails. Confused? At the end of the day Moonrise Kingdom is a very unique movie, one that is worthy of the copious amounts of praise that is being heaped upon it.Set on a small, sparsely populated chain of island in the 1960s that has more boyscout camps on it than townspeople, a twelve year old boy and girl decide that even if nobody likes them that they love each other. They set off into the wilderness with a coon skin cap, bb-gun, a yellow pup tent, some french records, and a few stolen library books. When they turn up missing, their parents, the police, and fellow scouts set out to try to find them, even though in many cases they were the ones that drove them away in the first place.This is all done in a light-comedy, tongue in cheek kind of way, but because you end up caring about the characters so much the movie carries with it a fair amount of emotion. The funny scenes predominate, but there is also a lot of suspense towards the end when you realize the fate of the kids and the movie itself is entirely up in the air. It has been a long time since I've seen a film where I sensed it was about to end but did not know what was going to happen.Although littered with many well known stars for the adult roles, both of the leading kids are played quite well by unknown newcomers. Jared Gilman reminds me of Ralphie from ""A Christmas Story"", wearing thick glasses and relying on his Red Ryder as he tries to navigate the perils of both the wilderness and his tween years. He may be a little more take charge than Ralphie, having already taken Scutt Farkas' coon skin cap from the school of hard knocks, but you'll see many similarities. One of Kara Hayward's on screen brothers is also interestingly the spitting image of Ralphie's younger brother Randy.Hayward plays the female tween misfit in this backwoods Romeo & Juliet, and would remind you a little bit of Wednesday from the Addams Family if not for the fact that she wears all pink and carries a kitten with her instead of being dressed in black with a headless doll. But she definitely carries Wednesday's personality, dry wit and style. Whereas Jared Gilman plays an orphan, Kara's character comes from a dysfunctional family who makes her feel like she wishes she had none. When she tells this to Gilman he quickly responds ""I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about"". While sometimes seemingly vulnerable and filled with self doubt, her trusty pair of ""lefty-scissors"" are quick to leap into action when she's forced to defend her man against some jealous boyscouts who have played with too many GI Joes.While that may sound a little violent, this is all delivered in the very quirky tongue in cheek style of Wes Anderson movies. This is probably his most accessible work to date. It does not feel too highbrow, and does not come off like it is trying too hard. He has really created a movie that is incredibly hard to define, and the more you try to do so the more all of your efforts seem lacking; he's really made his own genre here, with a nostalgic light-comedy coming of age love story kitchen sink suspense backwoods adventure.Ultimately I can see some people describing this as a chick flick and others as a guy's movie. Both would be right.",5,Ralphie and his Red-Ryder fight for true love,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,3479,"['Best', 'described', 'one', 'part', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'one', 'part', 'Stand', 'Me', 'one', 'part', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'extra', 'helping', 'young', 'estrogen', 'newcomer', 'Kara', 'Hayward', 'help', 'balance', 'out', 'snakes', 'snails', 'puppy-dog', 'tails', 'Confused', 'end', 'day', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'very', 'unique', 'movie', 'one', 'worthy', 'copious', 'amounts', 'praise', 'being', 'heaped', 'it.Set', 'small', 'sparsely', 'populated', 'chain', 'island', '1960s', 'more', 'boyscout', 'camps', 'townspeople', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'girl', 'decide', 'even', 'nobody', 'love', 'other', 'set', 'off', 'wilderness', 'coon', 'skin', 'cap', 'bb-gun', 'yellow', 'pup', 'tent', 'french', 'records', 'few', 'stolen', 'library', 'books', 'When', 'turn', 'up', 'missing', 'parents', 'police', 'fellow', 'scouts', 'set', 'out', 'try', 'find', 'even', 'many', 'cases', 'were', 'ones', 'drove', 'away', 'first', 'place.This', 'done', 'light-comedy', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'kind', 'way', 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'fair', 'amount', 'emotion', 'funny', 'scenes', 'predominate', 'also', 'lot', 'suspense', 'end', 'when', 'realize', 'fate', 'kids', 'movie', 'entirely', 'air', 'been', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'where', 'sensed', 'was', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen.Although', 'littered', 'many', 'well', 'known', 'stars', 'adult', 'roles', 'leading', 'kids', 'are', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'unknown', 'newcomers', 'Jared', 'Gilman', 'Ralphie', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'wearing', 'thick', 'glasses', 'relying', 'Red', 'Ryder', 'navigate', 'perils', 'wilderness', 'tween', 'years', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'take', 'charge', 'Ralphie', 'having', 'already', 'taken', 'Scutt', 'Farkas', 'coon', 'skin', 'cap', 'school', 'hard', 'knocks', ""'ll"", 'see', 'many', 'similarities', 'One', 'Kara', 'Hayward', 'screen', 'brothers', 'also', 'interestingly', 'spitting', 'image', 'Ralphie', 'younger', 'brother', 'Randy.Hayward', 'female', 'tween', 'misfit', 'backwoods', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'would', 'remind', 'little', 'bit', 'Wednesday', 'Addams', 'Family', 'not', 'fact', 'pink', 'kitten', 'instead', 'being', 'dressed', 'black', 'headless', 'doll', 'definitely', 'Wednesday', 'personality', 'dry', 'wit', 'style', 'Whereas', 'Jared', 'Gilman', 'orphan', 'Kara', 'character', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'who', 'feel', 'had', 'none', 'When', 'Gilman', 'quickly', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'sometimes', 'seemingly', 'vulnerable', 'filled', 'self', 'doubt', 'trusty', 'pair', 'lefty-scissors', 'are', 'quick', 'leap', 'action', 'when', 'forced', 'defend', 'man', 'jealous', 'boyscouts', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'too', 'many', 'GI', 'Joes.While', 'may', 'sound', 'little', 'violent', 'delivered', 'very', 'quirky', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'style', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'probably', 'most', 'accessible', 'work', 'date', 'not', 'feel', 'too', 'highbrow', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'really', 'created', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'define', 'more', 'try', 'do', 'so', 'more', 'efforts', 'seem', 'lacking', 'really', 'made', 'own', 'genre', 'here', 'nostalgic', 'light-comedy', 'coming', 'age', 'love', 'story', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'suspense', 'backwoods', 'adventure.Ultimately', 'can', 'see', 'people', 'describing', 'chick', 'flick', 'others', 'guy', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'right']",N/A
1533458,ASZGADJQT6ET4,B007L6VR12,Adam Gagnon,"[3, 8]","From my site, [...]The audiences&#8217; enjoyment of Moonrise Kingdom really depends on their like for Wes Anderson movies. If only one thing can be said about Wes Anderson it&#8217;s that he definitely has his own style. Anderson movies are usually slower paced in oddly detailed environments with intelligent dialogue and a sense of comedy that is exceptionally dry. Moonrise Kingdom is no exception to these conventions, however it falls short because all of the oddities don&#8217;t amount to anything of particular interest this time.Moonrise Kingdom is a love story between children. Sam (Jared Gilman) is a Khaki Scout who leaves the organization to run away with a local girl, Suzy (Kara Hayward). When his escape is discovered by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) an investigation is started involving the rest of the scouts and the Captain of the local police, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are the Bishops, Suzy&#8217;s parents. The two are very confrontational and constantly get in the way of the search for the run away kids. There is never a sense of danger for the movie, that&#8217;s not what Moonrise Kingdom is about. It is a quirky love story set in a real enough era but with a surreal twist.The movie never ramps up enough that the audience is on the edge of their seat about anything. There is no question about the progression of the movie or the end results. Even when new elements are introduced to the audience it is clear where things are going to end up.Moonrise Kingdom boasts a very solid cast but no breakout performances. Gilman and Hayward are solid child actors but the deadpan delivery that comes with Anderson movies may be the cause for that. Bill Murray is a staple in Anderson movies and usually provides a good amount of the offbeat humor. In Kingdom he is more a placeholder than anything. Frances McDormand has never been a great actress, she got lucky with Fargo and that is the sole reason she continues to receive acting work. Edward Norton was probably the funniest performance of the movie. Norton is usually an edgy and very serious actor but in Kingdom he plays the complete opposite.Unfortunately the movie lacked substance so there isn&#8217;t much more to say. It&#8217;s one of Anderson&#8217;s weaker movies. In a year filled with amazing performances, break out stars, and truly original movies it is a complete mystery how Moonrise Kingdom got nominated for an Academy Award at all.",2,My Moonrise Kingdom Review,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,2473,"['site', 'audiences', '8217', 'enjoyment', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'really', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Wes', 'Anderson', '8217', 'definitely', 'own', 'style', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'slower', 'paced', 'oddly', 'detailed', 'environments', 'intelligent', 'dialogue', 'sense', 'comedy', 'exceptionally', 'dry', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'exception', 'conventions', 'however', 'short', 'oddities', 'don', '8217', 'amount', 'anything', 'particular', 'interest', 'time.Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'love', 'story', 'children', 'Sam', 'Jared', 'Gilman', 'Khaki', 'Scout', 'who', 'organization', 'run', 'away', 'local', 'girl', 'Suzy', 'Kara', 'Hayward', 'When', 'escape', 'discovered', 'Scout', 'Master', 'Ward', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'investigation', 'started', 'involving', 'rest', 'scouts', 'Captain', 'local', 'police', 'Captain', 'Sharp', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'are', 'Bishops', 'Suzy', '8217', 's', 'parents', 'two', 'are', 'very', 'confrontational', 'constantly', 'get', 'way', 'search', 'run', 'away', 'kids', 'never', 'sense', 'danger', 'movie', '8217', 'not', 'what', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'about', 'quirky', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'real', 'enough', 'era', 'surreal', 'twist.The', 'movie', 'never', 'up', 'enough', 'audience', 'edge', 'seat', 'anything', 'question', 'progression', 'movie', 'end', 'results', 'Even', 'when', 'new', 'elements', 'are', 'introduced', 'audience', 'clear', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up.Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'very', 'solid', 'cast', 'breakout', 'performances', 'Gilman', 'Hayward', 'are', 'solid', 'child', 'actors', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'may', 'be', 'cause', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'staple', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'usually', 'good', 'amount', 'offbeat', 'humor', 'Kingdom', 'more', 'placeholder', 'anything', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'never', 'been', 'great', 'actress', 'got', 'lucky', 'Fargo', 'sole', 'reason', 'receive', 'acting', 'work', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'was', 'probably', 'funniest', 'performance', 'movie', 'Norton', 'usually', 'edgy', 'very', 'serious', 'actor', 'Kingdom', 'complete', 'opposite.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'lacked', 'substance', 'so', 'there', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'much', 'more', 'say', '8217', 'one', 'Anderson', '8217', 'weaker', 'movies', 'year', 'filled', 'amazing', 'performances', 'break', 'out', 'stars', 'truly', 'original', 'movies', 'complete', 'mystery', 'how', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'got', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award']",N/A

It is a vision of a bucolic America that never existed, populated with famous actors, male and female.A word of warning: this is not a children's film, per se, even though it is about children and is told in a fabulist style that hews close to Walt Disney. This film features themes such as adultery, sexual awakening, loss, the nature of family, and so forth neatly interwoven into its innocuous and breathtaking landscapes.

It's complex. It has some dark aspects and implications. It ends in a way that will make you say, &#34;Oh.&#34;And then, if you're like me, you'll watch it again, a week later.I bought this because a friend suggested it, to get a better understanding of stereotypes and their use in stories.  This movie IS wall-to-wall stereotypes... and they're people we've all known and loved. Or hated.

Director Wes Anderson frames his takes like works of art -- each scene carefully set. However, the script by Anderson and Roman Coppola does not dazzle like ""The Royal Tenenbaums (The Criterion Collection),Rushmore (The Criterion Collection), orBottle Rocket (The Criterion Collection), where those films characters are memorable and liven up the story and screen. This film falls more in the same category with Anderson's lackluster filmsThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)andThe Darjeeling Limited (The Criterion Collection)-- films that are too artistic as well as lack any emotion in dialogue or acting. I loved the previous three andFantastic Mr. Fox (Ws), but this one contains not much that is memorable (including the two leads, Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward). Veteran actors like Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Harvey Keitel are wasted. The true standouts of the film are the Khaki Scout troop 55 boys; they had some of the best parts in the film. I think Anderson should re-team up with Owen Wilson on writing duties since his best work (""Tenenbaums,"" ""Rushmore,"" ""Bottle Rocket"") has been with him. Lately, Anderson seems more style than substance and while his films look great, it doesn't make them memorable for why they should be: for being a well-written, well-performed film.",2,Not as great as critics and audiences made it out to be.

1533478,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B007L6VR12,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Ah, the joys of adolescence.  You are hounded by your parents, chastised by your peers and scorned by your first love.  You are misunderstood, underappreciated and overprotected and at the end of the day, your life is just now starting to `begin' and you have a whole lot of life left to live, so you better get used to it now!I don't know why I'm drawn to movies about childhood, but I certainly am.  Maybe it's the fact that it is a part of my life I often reflect on, or maybe it is because I can see it starting to form in the eyes of my children, but the bottom line is that these films truly impress something upon me, truly speak to the core of me.  Like Jonze did in a more fantastical way, and Zietlin did in a more earthy way, Anderson proves that he understands the misunderstood in a more humorous and charming way.Yes, Wes Anderson understands what it means to be a child.I'm a fan of Wes.  I'm not a rabid fan.  I don't bow down at the altar of Wes Anderson.  I thought `Rushmore' was uneven and `The Life Aquatic' slightly vacant, but `Fantastic Mr. Fox' was fantastic (pun intended) and `The Royal Tenenbaums' is one of the best comedies of the past decade.  For me, `Moonrise Kingdom' is his finest film and, without question, a masterpiece!  A beautifully intricate screenplay (so much subtle depth), a brilliant ensemble (Willis!  Norton!  Swinton!), not to mention two leads that truly understood the balance needed to sell all aspects of their situation.  Gilman and Hayward were outstanding to say the least, full of such adolescent truth and wonderment mixed with the sparks of individuality that make themselves prevalent at that ripe age of change.  Mix in with that Anderson's keen use of visuals (the sets, the costumes) and the beautiful score and you have a pitch perfect film from start to finish.What makes `Moonrise Kingdom' so insightful is the subtle way in which Anderson is able to bleed his themes into all aspects of his film.  When you consider the core story regarding Sam and his relationship with Suzy (the birth of adolescence through the pangs of first love) and then you see that same central theme trickle into the depiction of the adults around him, whether they be the lonely Captain Sharp (a magnificent Bruce Willis) or the repressed Laura Bishop (McDormand) or the childlike innocence of Scout Master Ward (a beautifully toned turn from Edward Norton), Anderson took the time to develop so much substance behind every conversation.  There is so much to glean from the development of story here that it demands repeat viewings.The key being that this film is wonderful enough to deserve them!And that is certainly key here as well.  Wes Anderson has a distinct style of filmmaking.  He is clever and witty and possesses a charm that makes his films rest warmly on the palate.  Using his sharp sense of direction, Anderson creates such a welcoming format for his tale.  He has perfected his approach and delivered a film that is tonally perfect, one that pulls us in and holds us close and urges us to keep watching with gentle prods that assure us, like a parent does a child, that we truly want to see how this story unfolds.",5,Anderson's insightful look at growing up fills the soul!,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,3176,"['Ah', 'joys', 'adolescence', 'are', 'hounded', 'parents', 'chastised', 'peers', 'scorned', 'first', 'love', 'are', 'misunderstood', 'underappreciated', 'overprotected', 'end', 'day', 'life', 'just', 'now', 'starting', 'begin', 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'life', 'left', 'live', 'better', 'get', 'used', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""'m"", 'drawn', 'movies', 'childhood', 'certainly', 'am', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'part', 'life', 'often', 'reflect', 'maybe', 'can', 'see', 'starting', 'form', 'eyes', 'children', 'bottom', 'line', 'films', 'truly', 'impress', 'something', 'truly', 'speak', 'core', 'Jonze', 'did', 'more', 'fantastical', 'way', 'Zietlin', 'did', 'more', 'earthy', 'way', 'Anderson', 'misunderstood', 'more', 'humorous', 'charming', 'way.Yes', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'what', 'be', 'child.I', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Wes', ""'m"", 'not', 'rabid', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'bow', 'down', 'altar', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'thought', 'Rushmore', 'was', 'uneven', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'slightly', 'vacant', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'was', 'fantastic', 'pun', 'intended', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'past', 'decade', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'finest', 'film', 'question', 'masterpiece', 'beautifully', 'intricate', 'screenplay', 'so', 'much', 'subtle', 'depth', 'brilliant', 'ensemble', 'Willis', 'Norton', 'Swinton', 'not', 'mention', 'two', 'leads', 'truly', 'understood', 'balance', 'needed', 'sell', 'aspects', 'situation', 'Gilman', 'Hayward', 'were', 'outstanding', 'say', 'least', 'full', 'such', 'adolescent', 'truth', 'wonderment', 'mixed', 'sparks', 'individuality', 'make', 'prevalent', 'ripe', 'age', 'change', 'Mix', 'Anderson', 'keen', 'use', 'visuals', 'sets', 'costumes', 'beautiful', 'score', 'have', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'film', 'start', 'finish.What', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'so', 'insightful', 'subtle', 'way', 'Anderson', 'able', 'bleed', 'themes', 'aspects', 'film', 'When', 'consider', 'core', 'story', 'regarding', 'Sam', 'relationship', 'Suzy', 'birth', 'adolescence', 'pangs', 'first', 'love', 'then', 'see', 'same', 'central', 'theme', 'trickle', 'depiction', 'adults', 'be', 'lonely', 'Captain', 'Sharp', 'magnificent', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'repressed', 'Laura', 'Bishop', 'McDormand', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'Scout', 'Master', 'Ward', 'beautifully', 'toned', 'turn', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Anderson', 'took', 'time', 'develop', 'so', 'much', 'substance', 'conversation', 'so', 'much', 'glean', 'development', 'story', 'here', 'repeat', 'viewings.The', 'key', 'being', 'film', 'wonderful', 'enough', 'deserve', 'certainly', 'key', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'distinct', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'clever', 'witty', 'charm', 'films', 'rest', 'warmly', 'palate', 'Using', 'sharp', 'sense', 'direction', 'Anderson', 'welcoming', 'format', 'tale', 'perfected', 'approach', 'delivered', 'film', 'tonally', 'perfect', 'one', 'close', 'keep', 'watching', 'gentle', 'prods', 'assure', 'parent', 'child', 'truly', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'story']",N/A

The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I reserve that hallowed rating for my lifetime favorite movies, and this movie was not deep enough for that.  But this is a fun and extremely enjoyable movie -- at least for Baby Boomers like myself who enjoy remembering how our childhoods were very free in some ways -- we jumped off of roofs onto trampolines with no net and no supervision, and we never had pre-arranged ""play-dates,"" and yet we lived under the threat of things like the uniformed Miss ""Social Services,"" who loomed in the Orwellian background of Cold War childhoods.

Fans will love the story of childhood love set on a New England island called New Penzance in 1965. Sam and Suzy are 12-year olds who meet one summer. They write throughout the year and make a pact to sneak off together the next summer. Sam abandons his scout troop, and Suzy leaves her parents. The two kids meet up and share an innocent love while the entire island is looking for them.I've enjoyed all the Wes Anderson movies I've watched (only missed one), but I'm not an ardent fan or defender. His casts are always top notch, and this film includes Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, and Edward Norton. Fans of Anderson will find plenty to like in this quirky coming of age story.Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman steal the show as Sam and Suzy, two young kids who are in love. They share adventure, and a first kiss on a beach they call Moonrise Kingdom. I however, wanted to point out that I believe there is a little too much sexuality in the film concerning a 12 year old girl. I don't deny that it is realistic, or that it works in the movie. While on the beach, the two kids go swimming, stripping down to underwear. Suzy's bra shows tons of cleavage, and one shot basically shoots straight down her bra. Also, she asks the little boy to put his hand on her chest. I felt uncomfortable watching scenes on film that are usually depicted by actors at least 18 years of age.I went on Amazon affiliated IMDB to see other viewer's thoughts on this, and anyone who was critical of the sexuality in this movie was called every name in the book. I've never seen so much hate in my life. Fans of Anderson have every right to defend this movie. But as someone who considered watching this movie with my 11 and 9 year old kids, I'm sure glad I didn't. I'm writing this review to give a heads up to parents who may feel the same way I do. People may bash this review too, or think I'm a prude or out of touch. Trust me, I'm not.

It&#8217;s certainly not a revolutionary plot, but this movie is anything but run-of-the-mill. Quite the opposite actually &#8211; it&#8217;s fantastic. Equal parts quirky, charming, witty, and genuinely funny, it&#8217;s a deft and completely distinctive rendition of this well-worn tale.There&#8217;re just so many great things to say about this film. Right from the opening credits it establishes a very unique tone with the musical selection, setting, and (most notably) the camerawork. The cinematography remains consistently amazing throughout the movie, utilizing really creative, often symmetrical shot compositions and lots of side-tracking pans. The visuals play an integral role in setting the off-kilter and playful atmosphere of the film (think Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Anderson&#8217;s last film).The cast is also excellent across the board, and what&#8217;s really impressive is that the two child leads manage to steal the show from huge names like Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, and Bill Murray. And the success of the two leads isn&#8217;t just due to acting ability, it&#8217;s also simply because the characters are really well-crafted and endearing. They both have an unabashed eccentricity and deadpan humor (think Napoleon Dynamite) that just makes them very likable and easy to root for. The deadpan humor is also a very integral part of the success of the film. There&#8217;s definitely a serious message here about never compromising who you are to fit in with crowd, but it&#8217;s delivered in a very light-hearted, good-humored way that never takes itself too seriously.Overall, Moonrise Kingdom is a movie that gets nearly everything right. It&#8217;s a movie during which you just can&#8217;t help but smile from beginning to end and which is bursting at the seams with creativity, wit, and charm. The only real criticisms I can muster is that the middle third drags just a tad and that I wish there was a bit more resolution with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (the parent characters of the female lead). Aside from these minor quibbles though, the movie impresses on every level and is a thoroughly entertaining and heartwarming affair.4.5/5",4,"Bursting at the seams with creativity, wit, and charm.",1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2297,"['Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'story', 'two', 'troubled', 'misunderstood', 'kids', 'who', 'meet', 'bond', 'inability', 'fit', '8217', 'certainly', 'not', 'revolutionary', 'plot', 'movie', 'anything', 'run-of-the-mill', 'opposite', 'actually', '8211', '8217', 'fantastic', 'Equal', 'parts', 'quirky', 'charming', 'witty', 'genuinely', 'funny', '8217', 's', 'deft', 'completely', 'distinctive', 'rendition', 'well-worn', 'tale.There', '8217', 're', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'say', 'film', 'Right', 'opening', 'very', 'unique', 'tone', 'musical', 'selection', 'setting', 'most', 'notably', 'camerawork', 'cinematography', 'consistently', 'amazing', 'movie', 'utilizing', 'really', 'creative', 'often', 'symmetrical', 'shot', 'compositions', 'lots', 'side-tracking', 'pans', 'visuals', 'play', 'integral', 'role', 'setting', 'off-kilter', 'playful', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'think', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'Wes', 'Anderson', '8217', 's', 'last', 'film', '.The', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'board', 'what', '8217', 'really', 'impressive', 'two', 'child', 'manage', 'steal', 'show', 'huge', 'names', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'success', 'two', 'leads', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'just', 'due', 'acting', 'ability', '8217', 's', 'also', 'simply', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'well-crafted', 'endearing', 'have', 'unabashed', 'eccentricity', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'think', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'just', 'very', 'likable', 'easy', 'root', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'also', 'very', 'integral', 'part', 'success', 'film', '8217', 's', 'definitely', 'serious', 'message', 'here', 'about', 'never', 'compromising', 'who', 'are', 'fit', 'crowd', '8217', 's', 'delivered', 'very', 'light-hearted', 'good-humored', 'way', 'never', 'too', 'seriously.Overall', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'movie', 'nearly', 'everything', 'right', '8217', 's', 'movie', 'just', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'smile', 'beginning', 'end', 'bursting', 'seams', 'creativity', 'wit', 'charm', 'only', 'real', 'criticisms', 'can', 'muster', 'middle', 'third', 'drags', 'just', 'tad', 'wish', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'resolution', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Bishop', 'parent', 'characters', 'female', 'lead', 'Aside', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'movie', 'level', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'heartwarming', 'affair.4.5/5']",N/A

I wasn't crazy about Life Aquatic, though I can't really put my finger on why.  But Moonrise Kingdom was an enjoyable and lighthearted storybook style tale about two odd youths.  The first thing I want to point out is that the acting is terrific.  Anderson does seem to go for a campy style of film, and the actors all seem to be cast very well.  Edward Norton was my personal favorite in this film as the straight arrow scout leader.  I also enjoyed Bill Murray in his wonderful, yet small role.  And Bruce Willis has been hit or miss for me lately, but he was great in this film.  Folks might forget that he had a great early career with more comedic roles (Moonlighting for example).  And I can't forget to mention a wonderful Frances McDormand as well as a quirky and enjoyable Harvey Keitel in a rather fun role for him.Wes Anderson creates films that seem to be the film equivalent of a modern children's tall tale (at least his last two).  I would imagine that Anderson has a tiny little 6 year old tucked in his mind somewhere that he taps for storytelling.  Or he might just talk to kids a lot, who knows!  But what I know is that these films are grown up, but not in an adult way.  They are a bit more complex than a kids film, and with adult situations (though this one is more lighthearted than Royal Tenenbaums of course).  But I compare this a bit to Fantastic Mr. Fox (amazing film!) and Life Aquatic as well.The Blu-Ray transfer is very clean.  This set has the DVD version as well.  Just be aware that the Ultraviolet copy has several issues.  But any digital media is going to have issues with multiple devices.  And I understand that eventually the digital copy goes away (according to previous Ultraviolet releases).  My question is, why isn't Criterion marketing this?  I thought he had some kind of arrangement with them.  But regardless, the hardware is worthy.  Just don't count on the digital copy as being perfect.I don't think this film is going to appeal to everyone.  But those viewers who want a fun trip through childhood nostalgia will enjoy it.  The acting and direction are spot on.  There are a few slow moments to the film, but there is quite enough humor and just plain silliness to keep the viewer riveted.  I highly encourage purchasing a copy because it makes a great film to watch with friends and family.  Even for those folks who have not seen an Anderson flick, this would make a great introduction to his work.  One of the better, ultimately feel good films of 2012.  Perhaps a couple of Oscar nominations will be had.  Though the film will probably follow the typical Wes Anderson Oscar story: nominated, losing to a film less deserving (Royal Tenenbaums was better original screenplay than Gosford Park - which ripped off 'Rules of the Game' - in my humble opinion).  Is it the best Wes Anderson film?  Perhaps.  But it all depends on your preference.  Lets just agree that it is equally as good as anything he has created.",5,Youthful innocence plus Edward Norton in short shorts ~,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,3312,"['usually', 'only', 'review', 'older', 'films', 'especially', 'Criterion', 're-releases', 'owing', 'lot', 'banality', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'So', 'pen', 'review', 'recent', 'film', 'rare', 'think', 'owing', 'quality', 'film', 'add', 'one', 'more', 'positive', 'note', 'other', 'mostly', 'positive', 'reviews.This', 'terrific', 'vintage', 'Anderson', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'put', 'finger', 'why', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'lighthearted', 'storybook', 'style', 'tale', 'two', 'odd', 'youths', 'first', 'thing', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'acting', 'terrific', 'Anderson', 'seem', 'go', 'campy', 'style', 'film', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'cast', 'very', 'well', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'was', 'personal', 'favorite', 'film', 'straight', 'arrow', 'scout', 'leader', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'wonderful', 'yet', 'small', 'role', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'been', 'hit', 'miss', 'lately', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'Folks', 'might', 'forget', 'had', 'great', 'early', 'career', 'more', 'comedic', 'roles', 'Moonlighting', 'example', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'mention', 'wonderful', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'as', 'well', 'quirky', 'enjoyable', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'rather', 'fun', 'role', 'him.Wes', 'Anderson', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'film', 'equivalent', 'modern', 'children', 'tall', 'tale', 'least', 'last', 'two', 'would', 'imagine', 'Anderson', 'tiny', 'little', '6', 'year', 'old', 'tucked', 'mind', 'somewhere', 'storytelling', 'might', 'just', 'talk', 'kids', 'lot', 'who', 'what', 'know', 'films', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'not', 'adult', 'way', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'kids', 'film', 'adult', 'situations', 'one', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'course', 'compare', 'bit', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'amazing', 'film', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'well.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'transfer', 'very', 'clean', 'set', 'DVD', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'Ultraviolet', 'copy', 'several', 'issues', 'digital', 'media', 'going', 'have', 'issues', 'multiple', 'devices', 'understand', 'eventually', 'digital', 'copy', 'away', 'according', 'previous', 'Ultraviolet', 'releases', 'question', 'why', ""n't"", 'Criterion', 'marketing', 'thought', 'had', 'kind', 'arrangement', 'regardless', 'hardware', 'worthy', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'digital', 'copy', 'being', 'perfect.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'going', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'fun', 'trip', 'childhood', 'nostalgia', 'will', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'spot', 'are', 'few', 'slow', 'moments', 'film', 'quite', 'enough', 'humor', 'just', 'plain', 'silliness', 'keep', 'viewer', 'riveted', 'highly', 'encourage', 'purchasing', 'copy', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'friends', 'family', 'Even', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Anderson', 'flick', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'introduction', 'work', 'One', 'better', 'ultimately', 'feel', 'good', 'films', '2012', 'Perhaps', 'couple', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'will', 'be', 'had', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'follow', 'typical', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Oscar', 'story', 'nominated', 'losing', 'film', 'less', 'deserving', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'was', 'better', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'ripped', ""'Rules"", 'Game', 'humble', 'opinion', 'best', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'preference', 'just', 'agree', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'created']",N/A

DeRiemer,"[1, 1]","If Wes Anderson weren't as talented and original a writer-director as he is, many of his movies would die of eccentric cuteness, all wrapped in the comfortable cocoons spun by his friends for him. Some of his movies I like somewhat, but in many of these cases it's because of the actors. After watching Moonrise Kingdom, I'm inclined to watch again Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums and see if I were wrong.Moonrise Kingdom is an original, charming delight, not quite a pre-teen fairytale, not quite a fable for adults, but something that combines effortlessly reminiscences of what we might wish our reminiscences could have been with innocent delight, including the innocent delight of pre-teen love.The setting is an idyllic and stylized New England island. The adults, including parents, are eccentric and nice. The two leads, played by 13-year-old Jared Gilman and 14-year-old Kara Hayward, decide to strike out on their own together. He is an orphan, serious, direct, and capable. He brings camping equipment. She is rebellious, misunderstood and thinks. She brings books, her cat and a record player. Together, while the adults search, they hike, camp, cook fish and talk about things. He listens while she reads from her books. They sort of fall in love.The movie is upbeat and thoroughly enjoyable. It's also eccentric and original. The one moment of sexual happening is so honest and dealt with so quickly and directly that only a dried grape could keep from smiling. All the adult actors give fine, deadpan performances. Some of them include Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Bruce Wills, Edward Norton and Tilda Swinton.",5,"A charming and delightful movie, with no cuteness or sentimentality",1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,1630,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'talented', 'original', 'writer-director', 'many', 'movies', 'would', 'die', 'eccentric', 'cuteness', 'wrapped', 'comfortable', 'cocoons', 'spun', 'friends', 'movies', 'like', 'somewhat', 'many', 'cases', 'actors', 'watching', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'watch', 'again', 'Rushmore', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'see', 'were', 'wrong.Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'original', 'charming', 'delight', 'not', 'quite', 'pre-teen', 'fairytale', 'not', 'quite', 'fable', 'adults', 'something', 'effortlessly', 'reminiscences', 'what', 'might', 'wish', 'reminiscences', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'innocent', 'delight', 'including', 'innocent', 'delight', 'pre-teen', 'love.The', 'setting', 'idyllic', 'stylized', 'New', 'England', 'island', 'adults', 'including', 'parents', 'are', 'eccentric', 'nice', 'two', 'leads', 'played', '13-year-old', 'Jared', 'Gilman', '14-year-old', 'Kara', 'Hayward', 'decide', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'together', 'orphan', 'serious', 'direct', 'capable', 'camping', 'equipment', 'rebellious', 'misunderstood', 'thinks', 'books', 'cat', 'record', 'player', 'Together', 'adults', 'search', 'hike', 'camp', 'cook', 'fish', 'talk', 'things', 'books', 'sort', 'fall', 'love.The', 'movie', 'upbeat', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'eccentric', 'original', 'one', 'moment', 'sexual', 'happening', 'so', 'honest', 'dealt', 'so', 'quickly', 'directly', 'only', 'dried', 'grape', 'could', 'keep', 'smiling', 'adult', 'actors', 'give', 'fine', 'deadpan', 'performances', 'include', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Bruce', 'Wills', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Tilda', 'Swinton']",N/A

The two puppy lovers are both troubled youths, and it is only through the inattentions and inactions of all the adults around them that they are able to create, ultimately, a life-or-death crisis.  To what extent are the kids responsible for their perceived failings?  Moonrise Kingdom presents a compelling case that the kids are alright and it is the adults who are screwed up.The stars of Moonrise Kingdom are the two twelve year-old lovers, portrayed by child actors Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward.  Both do a more-than-credible job, and will have you rooting for them to succeed on their attempted escape.  The main adult roles fall to Bruce Willis and Edward Norton, who turn in fine performances of somewhat stereotyped characters: the sleepy town police chief, and the by-the-book scoutmaster.  The roles of Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are not significant enough to showcase the talents of those two accomplished actors.The movie takes place in director Wes Anderson's picture postcard-perfect alternate universe, a visually striking place in which everything (even including kids' play areas) is perfectly ordered and ready to be photographed.  Even Kara Hayward's 12 year-old runaway girl somehow maintains her neatly applied eye shadow during the course of a multi-day outdoor excursion.  Similarly, all of the characters aside from the two lovers are simplified stereotypes: the government bureaucrat, the bully, the loyal dog, even the narrator with perfect diction.

1533546,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B007L6VR12,C. Sawin,"[4, 6]","It can probably go on record that Wes Anderson has never made a bad film. Certainly some are better than others and everyone is going to have their favorite(s) that they connect to the most (cough ""Rushmore"" cough cough), but his films are always enjoyable. It's hard to believe that ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is Anderson's first live-action film in five years and it may be his most well-rounded and personal film to date.The film begins with a tour of the Bishop house, which is extraordinary. The camera pans from room to room as you're introduced to what seems like a life-sized dollhouse. The score of the film also enters the picture through Suzy's brother, Lionel's (Jake Ryan), battery operated record player. It's like a narrated introduction to the different types of instruments used in a full orchestra including harps, cellos, flutes, piccolos, electric and acoustic guitars, ukuleles, banjos, woodblocks, organs, and pianos among several other instruments. The score practically encompasses your senses and is very eclectic; the type of score that sticks to you like glue.One of the first scenes in the film is the ""flew the coop"" scene. Any movie that references ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in its opening moments should already be on your radar of greatness. Anderson is also able to create these magnificent plays within his films. ""Rushmore"" had several and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" has the Noah's Ark play where Sam meets Suzy for the first time. If schools were ever able to put on plays like this regularly, their audience would only expand over time. They're just so creative.The dancing scene on the beach is perhaps the one that has the most impact. Not only does it provide humor, but it's the first scene that really shows how far Sam and Suzy's relationship has actually escalated. The entire beach scene is just great anyway. It's not often that something of that length can be touching, memorable, and hilarious all at the same time. Only Wes Anderson can pull off something like that.""Moonrise Kingdom"" has all of Wes Anderson's trademarks including eye-catching cinematography, a fantastic score, intelligent humor, and an incredible cast. Many believe that this is Anderson's best work to date. The comedy-drama is certainly a welcome change of pace during a summer filled with blockbuster action and extravagant special effects. Although Bill Murray throws his shoe at Edward Norton and it's one of the best moments in cinema for the entire year. For once, ""leaving your brain at the door,"" doesn't really apply here. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is the type of movie that is charming for the soul and makes your brain happy in the process.

Various other scouts and assorted adults give chase.

Some do it better than others. Not everyone is a winner. Its stars - seven of them! - are all totally out of character. This is not a Bill Murray vehicle or an Edward Norton vehicle or a Bruce Willis vehicle. The stars fit in, almost as afterthoughts. It's the story that counts. Most impressively, it has style. From the opening shots of Susie, face on with her binoculars in various rooms of the house, you know this film will be stylish. And understated. It is worthy of any screen in the world, in a world where American films have become overpoweringly boring and repetitive and entirely predictable. This is the kind of film that France would have originated, and which Americans would have remade into a noxious overkill of action and adventure. It is therefore rare and precious.

Even though the story is your basic 'boy meets girl', Anderson's attention to detail and nuance balanced with deadpan humor and sight gags make this movie a delight to watch. Unpredictable at times, formulaic at others, it is a visual and auditory treat. The underpinning of the entire film is Benjamin Britten's ""The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra"" (a brilliant choice!) Even though the story takes place in 1965, don't expect any traditional 'Top 40 Hits' of that era -  Anderson is much too eclectic for that. This isn't necessarily a profound cinematic experience - but it is an entertaining, eccentric, funny, touching, and a visually and musically arresting one. (Rated PG-13 for 'sexuality and smoking'??? Come on, they were only kissing, and the girl was in her undergarments.

And that, ladies and gents, aptly demonstrates the highly nuanced, charming quirkiness of Wes Anderson's MOONRISE KINGDOM. Until seeing this film I was unaware of this director, but count me in as a fan now.  Anderson can make a film that not only is entertaining, charming, and downright funny--he can create images and sets and combos of colors that are as mesmerizing as they are haunting.MOONRISE KINGDOM is the story of two tweeners--an orphaned boy (Jared Gilman) who deserts his Khaki Scout troop, and a troubled girl (Kara Hayward) who runs away from home to join him in the wilderness of a New England island in the late summer, as a massive storm approaches.  The pair develops a budding camaraderie and romance (all tastefully done, I might add), and a firm determination to elude the considerable search that's been launched to find them.  Gilman and (especially) Hayward have considerable talent; I look forward to following their acting careers.Yet MOONRISE KINGDOM is peaked by its stellar ensemble cast, including Edward Norton as a gung-ho Scout Master, Bruce Willis as the island's lone policeman guiding the search, Bill Murray and Frances McDormand as the girl's frightened (yet dysfunctional) parents, Tilda Swinton as a stark, bureaucratic Social Services worker, and Harvey Keitel as a take-no-prisoners Scout Commander.  Special kudos to Bob Balaban, playing the story's deadpanned narrator that constantly had me in stitches.  In fact, if you don't have a grin on your mug from start to finish of the delightfully nuanced MOONRISE KINGDOM, then maybe you just need to lighten up.--D. Mikels, Esq.",5,Nuance.

1533567,A3OXW1R2RMDXBX,B007L6VR12,"Donna Anastasi ""Spin the Plate""","[309, 333]","Set in 1965, Moonrise Kingdom is a stylized coming of age film that delivers on its promise to bring the viewer of any age back to the intensity of just-entering-adolescence love. That alone makes this an extraordinary film. In addition, the music and imagery are beautifully orchestrated to delight the senses. The casting, characters, and acting are superb. It is rare to have a film that puts together this much talent and then taps it to the fullest.Heavy hitters include the brilliant Edward Norton (for once watching his language and holding his temper) as an anal but dedicated troop leader, Bill Murray who in stark contrast to the young stars in this film, fails to find any joy whatsoever in his work in the law profession, wealth, family or beautiful surroundings. His dissatisfied wife (Frances McDormand who was the psychiatrist in Norton's first film Primal Fear), is also an attorney (the lawyer banter are some of the funniest lines in the film). Bruce Willis (who plays very well with child stars as he has a bit of child still left in him) is the bachelor, island cop who goes head-to-head with the chilling Tilda Swinton (white witch from Narnia) known only as ""Social Services,"" as she callously plans to put ""the boy"" in juvenile refuge to undergo shock therapy as needed.Despite the exceptionally strong adult cast, the two main child stars Sam and Suzy not only keep pace, but outshine the grownups with their unfailing loyalty and unconditional love for each other, both express an unthinking complete giving of themselves to one other. The film captures beautifully in the persons of these two intriguing social outcasts the experience of moving from being trapped in isolation into discovering and developing a union with another. I love how the two of them are so adult and wise in one way and still very much children, with childlike reasoning and priorities, e.g., Suzy runs away and packs a suitcase full of books and her kitten but not a change of clothes.The cast is rounded out by a boyscout troop with scouts having inappropriately derogatory names as we did in my youth - such as lazy eye for the boy with the eyepatch. Also true to life was how dangerous and unsupervised our childhoods were then. Seeing the boy jump from two story height onto a trampoline without a surrounding net or a single spotter in sight, for example, really brought me back. And interactions with our parents really were pretty much restricted to being called to the table for dinner. I loved seeing Suzy's little brothers (Irish triplets) while away the time with all of the board and other none electronic games, fueled by a couple of dice or imagination.Wes Anderson spins a simple, sweet story - yet the viewer never knows exactly where it is headed. Throughout, the film is subtly hilarious. In trademark Anderson fashion, the lines are delivered in an almost deadpan way with all the characters completely oblivious to the irony and ridiculousness of the situation, dialog, and even their lives and themselves. I highly recommend purchasing this movie; it's one you'll want to watch again and again and share with other people.

Excellent scenery on ""New Penzance,"" a fictitious New England island without roads that seems to symbolize childhood itself or something like that.It's one of those films that makes a point of saying ""Childhood's real--adulthood's fake.""

It rewards those with the notion to read in between the lines, embraces the beauty of a natural setting, and cracks awkwardly funny stone-faced jokes at the most unexpected moments. The mood is decidedly childish, both in subject and in perspective, but for the most part that works to put the audience in the right mindset, rather than dumbing things down. It does occasionally overstretch itself, though, particularly as events begin to climax and believability abruptly becomes less of a priority.

This film is no exception. It is one of the most wonderfully weird flicks I've ever seen.Here's the scoop. Sam is an outsider in his scout troop. Suzy is an outsider in her home. The two meet, fall in love, and head for the road. The rest of the troop, the family and the local police band together to find the lovers.It's difficult to convey how entirely odd this film is. The characters, the sets, the story are all goofy beyond belief. But somehow it not only works, it makes its own sense. And all the actors seemed to get it. They all played their roles to a ""T."" Even Bruce Willis (this is not his usual fare) worked his part and made it happen. Now, to be fair, there were some heavy guns here. Ed Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, to name a few, are all veterans, so that should be a given. But the two kids are first timers and they managed their roles beautifully as well.The film is gorgeous. The opening doll house-like scenes, with their clean lines and primary colors, made me wonder (until I saw the moving bodies) if I were watching an actual set or some bizarre special effect. The outdoor scenes (this is set on an Island off New Hampshire) were idyllically filmed. I wanted to be there. The music score/sound track was great as well.There is nothing in this movie I didn't like. It reminded me how versatile the medium can be, and how it can fill an audience with a sense of wonder.

Sometimes the camera moves only laterally while it surveys a scene. The subjects in these scenes are like icons of an idea or of humans or personality types. It is as if Anderson is trying to deliver a cinematic art museum complete with Mona Lisa shots: the still shots of lovely Suzy (Kara Hayward) staring into the camera, and even a museum guide, narrator Bob Balaban.This is in stark contrast with  ""I want you in the room with them"" style of directing done with hand held camera action - the best example IMO being the very remarkable film `Biutiful"". In such films it's not icons but real people in your face.The story is a kind of fairy tale, of course, but amusingly and charmingly presented with the great music of Benjamin Britten adding to the artful atmosphere.

Beautifully staged and obsessively detailed sets and cinematography, great music, quirky storylines about underdogs who don't quite fit into society... and characters whose main defining trait is usually a deep and pervasive melancholy.In all these respects, Moonrise Kingdom is a ""typical"" Wes Anderson film.  However I don't think it quite lives up to his classics like Rushmore or The Royal Tenebaums.  The performances are excellent.  Many of Anderson's usual cast of players return, including Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman.  Edward Norton is hilarious as the scout troop leader who takes his responsibilities a bit too seriously.But this film really belongs to its 2 young stars, Jared Gilman as Sam and Kara Hayward as Suzy.  Both of them are excellent in their roles, although they are somewhat boxed in by Anderson's usual tendency of having his characters display very little emotion, or much enthusiasm for anything.  In a story about young first love, it would be nice if the 2 young people at least seemed a LITTLE bit excited about finding romance and a kindred spirit.  The flat affect does make the kids seem wise beyond their years, and it hints at the sadness that both have experienced - but I also think it detracts somewhat from the excitement and rush of that first adolescent romance.Like all Wes Anderson films, this one is enjoyable and fun to watch.  The supporting cast is excellent especially Norton, and also Bruce Willis playing against type as a quiet and lonely bachelor who ends up caring about Sam.

An Anderson fan, I hesitated to see this when it was released as mixed reviews (which usually happens in Anderson films anyway) many discounting it as ""a series of poses and postures"" often singling out the ""awful"" acting of the two leads discouraged me. Well, I was a silly goose, and those critics, as earnest as they may have been, couldn't have been more wrong in describing this thing if they'd tried.The leading couple, Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) are a pair of emotionally challenged 12 year olds who fall in love during a performance of Britten's Noye's Fludde. I couldn't imagine either role cast better than here, nor more nuanced performances coaxed by a director who actually ""gets"" kids - particularly troubled ones. The story begins when Sam, a highly decorated, though not well liked cadet Sam flees the confines of Camp Ivanhoe and his Khaki Troop (think Boy Scouts of America) to run away with unpredictable and misunderstood Suzy. Their inventory for survival includes a kitten in a basket (with accompanying cans of gourmet cat food), a battery operated record player and a suitcase full of stolen library books. My kind of kids. Living on a remote island (about to be hit by the storm of the century) they can't really escape far . . . or can they? Through (several) ensuing chases, unsuccessful captures, and re-escapes the story grows exponentially, layer by layer as it introduces us to the foibles, quirks and ticks of the residents as our Island Romeo and Juliet explore their burgeoning sexuality (all tastefully within the confines of its PG-13 rating).Speaking of Noye's Fludde, Anderson had me from the start, as any movie that bookends its opening and closing scenes with Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, has already got plenty going for it! And Britten's music (in addition to large chunks of Noye) looms large throughout, as does that of Schubert (An die Musick), Mozart (Cosi's Soave sia il vento) Saint Sans (Carnival of the Animals) and Hank Williams. So, too, does the score by composer Alexandre Desplat who pays tribute to Britten (remarkably directly in the closing credits, where his own ""Guide to the Orchestra"" is narrated by the film's hero).  Rarely does one find film music these days that is this integrally bound to the storytelling that it's virtually impossible to imagine the story without it.Anderson sets his tale circa 1965 on the fictional New England island of New Penzance. The nod to Gilbert and Sullivan is here more dramatic than musical, but nonetheless unmistakable. The parallels between Moonrise's young Sam, and Pirates' Frederic are plentiful. While entirely original, Moonrise nonetheless feels punctuated throughout as it evokes gauze-covered memories of other things. It was constantly conjuring fleeting instances causing my mind to race to discover connections between it and Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, The Keystone Cops, Lord of the Flies, and more. Robert D. Yeoman's remarkably nuanced cinematography makes every frame look like a page from an old family photo album, capturing summer camp, skinned knees and emotional secrets barely covered through veils of thin smiles. Moonrise Kingdom, indeed.Though Sam and Suzy are the heart of the film, Moonrise is truly an ensemble piece and Anderson is able to evoke marvelous, sometimes larger than life, performances from an inspired cast of Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Harvey Keitel and Bob Baliban (who serves as narrator/Greek Chorus), and all of whom create the believable, quirky, characters who populate this magical island town.In my estimation critics who found this ""stifling"" simply are never going to like films made by the likes of Mr. Anderson, directors who essentially eschew The Hollywood Way, as they put out beautiful, boutique films for small audiences willing (or wishing) to escape into the fantastic worlds they've created for us. For those not willing to do so, I suppose these films really can be, as one critic described Moonrise ""a long, dull exercise in alternative comedy."" For the rest of us . . . it's a dream.",5,Magical!,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,4311,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'down', 'one', 'most', 'whimsical', 'magical', 'films', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'many', 'moons', 'Anderson', 'fan', 'hesitated', 'see', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'usually', 'Anderson', 'films', 'anyway', 'many', 'discounting', 'series', 'poses', 'postures', 'often', 'singling', 'out', 'awful', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'discouraged', 'Well', 'was', 'silly', 'goose', 'critics', 'as', 'earnest', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'describing', 'thing', ""'d"", 'tried.The', 'leading', 'couple', 'Sam', 'Jared', 'Gilman', 'Suzy', 'Kara', 'Hayward', 'are', 'pair', 'emotionally', 'challenged', '12', 'year', 'olds', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'performance', 'Britten', 'Noye', 'Fludde', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'either', 'role', 'cast', 'better', 'here', 'more', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'coaxed', 'director', 'who', 'actually', 'kids', 'particularly', 'troubled', 'ones', 'story', 'when', 'Sam', 'highly', 'decorated', 'not', 'well', 'liked', 'cadet', 'Sam', 'confines', 'Camp', 'Ivanhoe', 'Khaki', 'Troop', 'think', 'Boy', 'Scouts', 'America', 'run', 'away', 'unpredictable', 'misunderstood', 'Suzy', 'inventory', 'survival', 'kitten', 'basket', 'accompanying', 'cans', 'gourmet', 'cat', 'food', 'battery', 'operated', 'record', 'player', 'suitcase', 'full', 'stolen', 'library', 'books', 'kind', 'kids', 'Living', 'remote', 'island', 'be', 'hit', 'storm', 'century', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'escape', 'far', 'can', 'several', 'ensuing', 'chases', 'unsuccessful', 'captures', 're-escapes', 'story', 'exponentially', 'layer', 'layer', 'foibles', 'quirks', 'ticks', 'residents', 'Island', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'explore', 'burgeoning', 'sexuality', 'tastefully', 'confines', 'PG-13', 'rating', '.Speaking', 'Noye', 'Fludde', 'Anderson', 'had', 'start', 'movie', 'opening', 'closing', 'scenes', 'Britten', 'Young', 'Person', 'Guide', 'Orchestra', 'already', 'got', 'plenty', 'going', 'Britten', 'music', 'addition', 'large', 'chunks', 'Noye', 'large', 'Schubert', 'die', 'Musick', 'Mozart', 'Cosi', 'Soave', 'sia', 'il', 'vento', 'Saint', 'Sans', 'Carnival', 'Animals', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'So', 'too', 'score', 'composer', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'who', 'tribute', 'Britten', 'remarkably', 'directly', 'closing', 'credits', 'where', 'own', 'Guide', 'Orchestra', 'narrated', 'film', 'hero', 'Rarely', 'one', 'find', 'film', 'music', 'days', 'integrally', 'bound', 'storytelling', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'story', 'it.Anderson', 'sets', 'tale', 'circa', '1965', 'fictional', 'New', 'England', 'island', 'New', 'Penzance', 'nod', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'here', 'more', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'nonetheless', 'unmistakable', 'parallels', 'Moonrise', 'young', 'Sam', 'Pirates', 'Frederic', 'are', 'plentiful', 'entirely', 'original', 'Moonrise', 'nonetheless', 'feels', 'punctuated', 'gauze-covered', 'memories', 'other', 'things', 'was', 'constantly', 'conjuring', 'fleeting', 'instances', 'causing', 'mind', 'race', 'discover', 'connections', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Tempest', 'Keystone', 'Cops', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'more', 'Robert', 'D.', 'Yeoman', 'remarkably', 'nuanced', 'cinematography', 'frame', 'look', 'page', 'old', 'family', 'photo', 'album', 'capturing', 'summer', 'camp', 'skinned', 'knees', 'emotional', 'secrets', 'barely', 'covered', 'veils', 'thin', 'smiles', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'indeed.Though', 'Sam', 'Suzy', 'are', 'heart', 'film', 'Moonrise', 'truly', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'Anderson', 'able', 'evoke', 'marvelous', 'sometimes', 'larger', 'life', 'performances', 'inspired', 'cast', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Bob', 'Baliban', 'who', 'narrator/Greek', 'Chorus', 'whom', 'create', 'believable', 'quirky', 'characters', 'who', 'populate', 'magical', 'island', 'town.In', 'estimation', 'critics', 'who', 'found', 'stifling', 'simply', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'like', 'films', 'made', 'likes', 'Mr.', 'Anderson', 'directors', 'who', 'essentially', 'eschew', 'Hollywood', 'Way', 'put', 'out', 'beautiful', 'boutique', 'films', 'small', 'audiences', 'willing', 'wishing', 'escape', 'fantastic', 'worlds', ""'ve"", 'created', 'not', 'willing', 'do', 'so', 'suppose', 'films', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'critic', 'described', 'Moonrise', 'long', 'dull', 'exercise', 'alternative', 'comedy', 'rest', 'dream']",N/A
1533604,A328S9RN3U5M68,B007L6VR12,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","MOONRISE KINGDOM addresses a problem that is prevalent at present in that we seem to be less educated about relationships, despite endless eBooks and blogs and regular books, and lectures/seminars from teams of goodwill popular gurus that can be hired for a price. Wes Anderson takes a different view by placing relationships under a microscope, using children to act out the fragilities and joys and consequence of allowing someone else into our heartspace. The result is a charming story about first love and coming of age that is respected by not only the writer/director Anderson, and the musical director Alexandre Desplat, but by a cast of both seasoned veteran actors as well as refreshing newcomers. It just works.Set on an island off the coast of New England in the 1960s, as a young boy Sam (Jared Gilman) and girl Suzy (Kara Hayward) fall in love they are moved to run away together into the wilderness. Their moments together reveal a growing love and as they carefully step into the territory of first love relationships they gradually become physical:  conversations occur - `Sam: It's possible I may wet the bed by the way. Later, I mean. Suzy: Okay. Sam: I wish I didn't have to mention it but just in case. I don't want to make you be offended. Suzy: Of course, I won't.' and when hugging each other and having their first kiss the very simple words are so memorably sensitive `Suzy: It feels hard. Sam: Do you mind? Suzy: I like it.'  A storm brews and the `adults' begin a frantic search for the youngsters - Suzy's parents (Frances McDormand and Bill Murray) who state ``Our daughter's been abducted by one of these beige lunatics!', the scout master (Edward Norton), the Social Services person (Tilda Swinton) and the local sheriff Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis).  And it is this hunt that the meanings of the film fall into place.When the youngsters are found, the conversations rings like `Sam: I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway. But something also happened, which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other, something happened to us. Captain Sharp: That's very eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying. But then again, I don't have to, 'cause you're 12 years old. Look, let's face it, you're probably a much more intelligent person than I am. In fact, I guarantee it. But even smart kids stick they're finger in electrical sockets sometimes. It takes time to figure things out. It's been proven by history. All mankind makes mistakes. It's our job to try to protect you from making the dangerous ones, if we can.'

Aside from the ""zany"" part, you'd be technically correct.  Did you like ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" or ""The Life Aquatic""?  If you did, then you're perfectly prepared for what this film has to offer.  If you didn't, then you should think about that before watching this film, because ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a close sibling to the other two, a trio of painfully shy, slow moving, detail obsessed movies;  It's funny, in parts, but it's a chuckle not a guffaw.For almost as long as Hollywood has been associated with movies, Hollywood has had a thing for playing kids as adults, and making their parents out to be childish.  This film takes that premise and makes it pretty much the backbone of the film.  Almost all the kids are more mature acting than any of the adults.  Other than that, it's essentially a story of outsiders among the conformist masses, with love instead of revolution at the center of their co-existence.  (""The Addams Family"" did much the same, but did it better).  It's a story that could be told in the present tense, but they decided to use the sixties and did well enough by it.  Yet, for me, the film didn't deliver..  I liked the ""Royal Tennenbaums"", and ""The Life Aquatic"", but ""Moonrise Kingdom"" didn't seem to make its story interesting enough to make me want to care about the characters.  The title didn't help, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" suggests much more fantasy than the film offered.  Certainly the buzz was overdone, and affected my experience.Fortunately, you can watch the DVD for a lot less money, without all the in-theater commercials, and you may well find it amusing.

I found Edward Norton preformance great for the character he was doing, along with Bruce Willis being a human being slash police officer and watching out for the boy so nothing bad would happen to the kid.  As for the movie itself I found myself laughing at mutiple scenes, remebering for me its was a middle school crush but not love.  But I could defently relate to the young love concept for the boy and girl in the movie.  I gave this movie a four star rating out of five because parts of the movie had me going you got to be kidding me, but overall a very amazing movie with a heartfelt message about a person's first love and what you would do to be with that first love.  I watch the movie with an open mind and heart and found myself actually ended up enjoying the movie so I disagree with some reviews because I might be 31 years old, but I still feel like a kid at heart at times in my life and movies like this help me remember my youth.

Pouliot,"[9, 11]","Who doesn't remember their first crush, when the first pangs of pre-adolescent loneliness and confusion resolve into the possibility of everlasting happiness? Director Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" gives us his typically-tilted take on young love. Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) plays a scout troop reject who, early in the film, decamps from the spit-and-polish Maine island campsite run by his super-efficient troop leader (Ed Norton). Sam sets off alone, decked in Davy Crockett-style coonskin cap and armed with an air rifle, determined to rendezvous with his true love. The object of his affections, Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward), is another disaffected 12-year-old who lives in lonely ennui with her doofus attorney parents, (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and her three, goofy classical-music-crazed young brothers. Suzy scans the horizon with her binoculars, obviously looking for something, or someone, to take her away from her boredom and problems. Soon, the pair of misfits has joined forces, and set off on a forest adventure while parents, fellow scouts and the island police (Bruce Willis) join in the search.I'm not usually a big Wes Andersen fan, but I found this film irresistible. Partly, because of the film's sometimes-cloudy plotline. Suzy's parents treat her adolescent poutiness as a sign of emotional disturbance, making them even more distant to her. Sam, too, comes from a tragic beginnings. He is a peculiar and nerdy kid (like an old college prof, he smoke a small corncob pipe filled with god-knows-what) but is essentially harmless. Sam and Suzy Set up camp in an isolated inlet, and express their love in mostly innocent ways - dancing, talking, reading to each other. Soon, we learn that her pursuers have problems of their own. Suzy's parents are having marriage problems, and the adults on the island seems to have settled for lives of quiet desperation. The search for Sam and Suzy is the shakeup that everyone needs to (maybe) shuck off old habits and take a new tack.Andersen's film, set in 1965 (though with a 1955 mindset) is shot in the pale hues of fade photographs. His signature cutaway houses make an appearance, as does the stilted, mannered acting style he directs onto the cast. He riffs lovingly on scouting and church theater. But what makes this film tolerable (and what was missing from the unbearable ""The Undersea World of Steven Zisou"") is the suffering at the core of the silliness. Suzy, Sam and the gang really are desperate for love. And it's a testament to Andersen's creative heart that he is able to hold the cute humor in check long enough to take their quest seriously.",5,The Island of Lonely Hearts,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,2635,"['Who', ""n't"", 'remember', 'first', 'crush', 'when', 'first', 'pangs', 'pre-adolescent', 'loneliness', 'confusion', 'resolve', 'possibility', 'everlasting', 'happiness', 'Director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'typically-tilted', 'take', 'young', 'love', 'Sam', 'Shakusky', 'Jared', 'Gilman', 'scout', 'troop', 'reject', 'who', 'early', 'film', 'decamps', 'spit-and-polish', 'Maine', 'island', 'campsite', 'run', 'super-efficient', 'troop', 'leader', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Sam', 'alone', 'decked', 'Davy', 'Crockett-style', 'coonskin', 'cap', 'armed', 'air', 'rifle', 'determined', 'rendezvous', 'true', 'love', 'object', 'affections', 'Suzy', 'Bishop', 'Kara', 'Hayward', 'disaffected', '12-year-old', 'who', 'lonely', 'ennui', 'doofus', 'attorney', 'parents', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'three', 'goofy', 'classical-music-crazed', 'young', 'brothers', 'Suzy', 'horizon', 'binoculars', 'obviously', 'looking', 'something', 'someone', 'take', 'away', 'boredom', 'problems', 'Soon', 'pair', 'misfits', 'joined', 'forces', 'set', 'off', 'forest', 'adventure', 'parents', 'fellow', 'scouts', 'island', 'police', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'join', 'search.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'big', 'Wes', 'Andersen', 'fan', 'found', 'film', 'irresistible', 'Partly', 'film', 'sometimes-cloudy', 'plotline', 'Suzy', 'parents', 'treat', 'adolescent', 'poutiness', 'sign', 'emotional', 'disturbance', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'distant', 'Sam', 'too', 'tragic', 'beginnings', 'peculiar', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'old', 'college', 'prof', 'smoke', 'small', 'corncob', 'pipe', 'filled', 'god-knows-what', 'essentially', 'harmless', 'Sam', 'Suzy', 'Set', 'up', 'camp', 'isolated', 'inlet', 'express', 'love', 'mostly', 'innocent', 'ways', 'dancing', 'talking', 'reading', 'other', 'Soon', 'learn', 'pursuers', 'have', 'problems', 'own', 'Suzy', 'parents', 'are', 'having', 'marriage', 'problems', 'adults', 'island', 'have', 'settled', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'search', 'Sam', 'Suzy', 'shakeup', 'everyone', 'maybe', 'shuck', 'off', 'old', 'habits', 'take', 'new', 'tack.Andersen', 'film', 'set', '1965', '1955', 'mindset', 'shot', 'pale', 'hues', 'fade', 'photographs', 'signature', 'cutaway', 'houses', 'make', 'appearance', 'stilted', 'mannered', 'acting', 'style', 'cast', 'lovingly', 'scouting', 'church', 'theater', 'what', 'film', 'tolerable', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'unbearable', 'Undersea', 'World', 'Steven', 'Zisou', 'suffering', 'core', 'silliness', 'Suzy', 'Sam', 'gang', 'really', 'are', 'desperate', 'love', 'testament', 'Andersen', 'creative', 'heart', 'able', 'hold', 'cute', 'humor', 'check', 'long', 'enough', 'take', 'quest', 'seriously']",N/A

Suzy is the only daughter of the odd characters played by Frances McDormand and Bill Murray, both lawyers who are certainly not vying for parent of the year award. They both seem distant and mildly depressed, and in general uninterested in their 4 children. Their home near the sea on a New England island is beautifully designed set featuring large perfectly symmetrical, brightly hued rooms. It seems like a perfect place for creative children to exercise their minds. The symmetry design is carried out throughout the film, almost to excess, but is certainly a defining feature.Sam is a 12-year old orphan, residing in a foster home and spending the summer in Khaki Scouts camp, lead by Ed Norton. Sam and Suzy carry on a pen pal correspondence for a while, before they agree to run away together. Sam has planned a scouting expedition in great detail, and Suzy brings along her battery operated phonograph and favorite books.

And, really, I've never seen anything like it.""Moonrise's..."" uh, sensibilities... are...whimsically nuts is one way to put it, I guess.  I'm really at a loss for words.But I can't recall when I last had so much fun watching a movie.SPOILER ALERT!  Essentially, this is a story about two twelve year olds (a boy and a girl) who run away from home.  Partly because they're misfits, but mostly because they've ""fallen in love.""Which is exactly the sort of story I'm predisposed to dislike.  In the main, I don't care for movies featuring kids.  Never have (with only rare, rare exceptions).But I think my bias in that regard was a non-issue with ""Moonrise,"" because even though it stars kids -- and its plot is centered upon them -- it's not really about  kids.  Having said that, though, I'm not completely sure what ""Moonrise"" was about.Director Wes Anderson took an inherently sad, melancholy --potentially tragic -- story about two kids who don't fit and made the audience (me, at least) smile and laugh while watching it.  Given that, then, I think ""Moonrise"" is much, much more than a charming little film about two endearing twelve year olds.As I said earlier, however, I'm at a loss for words in trying to describe this film.  It really overwhelmed me.  First chance I get, I intend to watch it another time or two, and then try again to organize my thoughts and feelings about it.  In the meantime, though, I'll say this in closing:  ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a gem of a film, and I can't begin to imagine anyone who sees it not enjoying it.Oh... almost forgot.  Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Ed Norton, Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton are all positively great in ""Moonrise.""  As were the two young actors.  The casting and acting in ""Moonrise"" are as good as it gets.* What follows was written an hour after I wrote the preceding and added in an ""edit""*Had to take a little more time to really digest this film.Clearly, ""Moonrise"" is social commentary.  But social commentary done with wit, insight and intelligence.Wes Anderson's caricatures of people like clueless parents, self-important attorneys, simple-minded, but well-meaning scout masters, and social workers who take themselves too seriously (to mention just some of the ""Moonrise"" adults) are spot-on.  And people such as those invite send-ups.  Which I thought Anderson did splendidly.  And with a sense of humor.In any case, I could go on at length about ""Moonrise.""  It worked for me on a number of levels.  Which is why I facetiously entitled this review ""Wes Anderson For President.""  Because, in my experience, it's rare, rare, rare to come across a film this well-done.I should point out, however, that until seeing ""Moonrise,"" that I'd never really heard of Wes Anderson.

1533658,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B007L6VR12,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[11, 15]","Moonrise Kingdom is the magical seventh film by Wes Anderson. It's undeniable that Anderson has carved a niche for himself, making highly evocative films that treat each frame as a canvas and tell the story with a perfect amount of wry humor and minimalism, but I've always had a love/hate relationship with his films. While I always admire his style and the unique vision he brings to every project, out of his previous six films I've loved only three. His skill as a director aside, he's a terrific writer with a great feel for character, a dry sense of humor, and a great penchant for subtlety. My gripes with him only arise when his style completely overrides substance and his film becomes a stylistic exercise in monotony. Thankfully, this is not the case with Moonrise Kingdom, the best film I've seen this year. It's too soon to say (and his greatest admirers may call it heresy), but this may be my favorite Wes Anderson film.The film takes place in 1965 on an idyllic island called New Penzance. The story centers around two young children, Sam Shakusky and Suzy Bishop (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, making their film debuts). Sam is an orphan attending a Khaki Scout summer camp on the island led by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). Suzy is staying on the island with her dysfunctional parents Walt and Laura Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and her three young brothers. Both are troubled, awkward social outcasts who met the previous summer and remained pen pals, ultimately agreeing to run away together on the island. This prompts a search posse for the two, led by Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). As is characteristic of Anderson's work, the adults in the story are just as dyspeptic as the children, if not more so.For me, Moonrise Kingdom is the summation of the cinematic techniques, stylistic vision, and depth of character that Anderson has honed in his previous films. He doesn't depart far from his formula in Moonrise Kingdom, but he puts all of his strengths on display and produces an adroit work of art that resonates on an emotional and visual level. With a directorial style that's so infused into the DNA of his films you can often identify his work by a single frame. He keeps his work from growing repetitious by expanding on and refining his talents; as a result, this may be his most beautiful film. A cynosure due to his impeccable use of a color palette that is rustic, vivid, and nostalgic, but never garish. He's worked with cinematographer Robert Yeoman since his debut Bottle Rocket and Yeoman's camera work has never more clearly had such a confident grasp on Anderson's visual aesthetic. Every frame looks like a great photograph. It's not only beautiful but atmospheric, particularly in the way it evokes the chimerical 1960s that exists in Anderson's head. Anderson is a master of style and setting, but is even more masterfully adept at using music to complement mood, style, and setting. Both the original compositions and time-specific music are essential to the spell this film casts.I've never questioned Anderson's ability to create a beautiful cinematic canvas, but what elevates Moonrise Kingdom is the script he co-wrote with Roman Coppola. It has the substance and the beauty necessary to validate the style. With style and substance working together in perfect harmony, he weaves a fairy tale tapestry of magical realism and whimsy that's effortlessly charming and likable. It helps that he never seems preoccupied with things going on outside the realm of his own creations. There's never the impression that anyone else on the island exists except for those directly involved in the mechanics of the plot. Keeping the focus solely on these characters gives them very distinct personalities and attributes. His characters are often quirky, reserved, and poetic, but they never feel rehashed from previous creations. What makes Moonrise Kingdom so heartfelt and poignant is that it's essentially a love story between two pre-teen children and it takes these characters seriously. By treating them with respect rather than as a foil, he captures the innocence and purity of young love in a way that's rarely captured so effectively and beautifully. I imagine he admires the lack of pretense that exists in these children, especially in relation to the story's dysfunctional adults that go through similar trials and reveal themselves as the more nave personalities.Anderson never falters on casting wrong and he pulls frequently from a troupe of actors well-versed in the rhythm of his films. There are familiar faces here; Jason Schwartzman, and of course Bill Murray, both of whom seem perfectly at home here. Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances in years; a succinct, quiet role that reminds us of his ability to go beyond ""action star"" when given the right material. Norton takes to Anderson's world natural, giving a quirky, alacritous performance as the timid Scout Master. Moonrise Kingdom is very funny, but in the most subtle way, never pining for laughs or acknowledging that something a character has said was supposed to be funny. Anderson really pulls great work from the two newcomers, Gilman and Hayward. They're both the same age as the characters they play and they bring that nave, yet perceptive quality that Hollywood films so often fail to capture by casting grown men and women as young people. The entire cast does great work and fit this grand puzzle perfectly.Moonrise Kingdom is an astonishing accomplishment that envelops you in its warm symmetry and entrances you in its spell. It's a light, funny, and feel-good film that I can't imagine viewers being able to easily disregard. In the coming months, it'll certainly remain one of the year's best films. It panders to the visual and auditory senses, but plays just as strongly on emotional and thoughtful level.

Moonrise Kingdom is a film you must watch on Wes Anderson's terms, or you won't enjoy it. The cast  has first rate character actors like Harvey Keitel, Bob Balaban and Tilda Swinton. Bruce Willis plays a lonely police chief who runs a one-man police department. Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are lawyers locked in an unhappy marriage. But the stars of this film are the two young actors who play the star-crossed lovers: Jared Gilman as Sam and Kara Hayward as Suzy. These two are drawn together because they are kindred spirits and feel unloved and rejected by their peers and families. Sam actually is a foster child. I won't provide spoilers, but it's fair to say they have a series of adventures and mis-adventures which will both amuse and touch you. The film has a dramatic theme, but Anderson maintains an undercurrent of humor throughout. This is the kind of film you will want to see more than once. It not only has a coherent plot, but also has a happy ending.

All strapped in ready for some side-splitting laughs and guffaws and yet these movies (Moonrise Kingdom, The Life Aquatic, Royal Tenebaums) really don't hold a candle to the original Rushmore perhaps due to the era in which they were released (Bush/Obama 2000s vs Clinton 90s).  I know they're not sequels or supposed to be related in an way even though many of the actors are the same.  It's just that as supposed comedies, there's a hell of a lot of down time between laughs, too many serious moments and an emphasis on cleverness and useless information that I just don't need.  These generally aren't funny movies, they're interesting movies, some scenes of which are wonderfully filmed and acted out.  Beautiful scenery, sets, imagination, special effects.  All the films have their humorous moments but for the most part, they seem to rely and focus on life's quirky little oddities, strange coincidences and the ""just keep it safe"" factor is in full swing, rarely venturing into LOL territory as Rushmore seemed to accomplish at all times.  Bill Murray has done a wonderful job over the past decade (or maybe more) of reprising his role as some kind of manic-depressive, mid-life crisis husband or divorced father of three who can't wait to frown on camera or say something average.

1533704,AOZFQAPPLMVOB,B007L6VR12,"Lone Alaskan Gypsy ""Lone Alaskan Gypsy""","[1, 1]","I purchased this lovely little DVD for $2.00 at my local store. It was originally supposed to be rented out, but no one rented it- and the poor little thing was left in a dusty pile in a 'sale bin'. Such an undeserving place for a magnificent film. I'd read many beautiful reviews about it online and always wanted to see it- but living in rural Alaska we don't have any place to buy such a thing (and I rarely buy movies anyways). So when I came across this at such a very affordable price, I snatched it up, carefully carried it home, and watched it almost immediately.I loved it dearly, but I know it has received some interesting view-points from its audience. The content, although childish, is quite mature. There are a few scenes many may find inappropriate. But I found them truthfully captured for what they are- an accurate portrayal of pre-adult love. They are tastefully captured, as not to exploit the children, but rather to simply show the world what they are experiencing. The awkward yet comfortable first experiences of finding 'the one' (or at least the one you think is 'the one').The scenery is magnificent and the acting by all people involved is exquisite. I was especially blown away by the younger characters and how well each one of them shown on screen. The dialogue, although quick-witted and sarcastically-humorous was delightful in it's own unique way. This is the first film I have seen by this director, but after watching it I look forward to viewing more of his work. I absolutely loved how simply the dialogue was, yet how complex the storyline it was involved in happened to be. It was a combination of amazing script writing and well-done filmography. All of the actors and actresses played their parts just right. I really couldn't imagine anyone else being cast for each of the parts. I fell in love with each and every character (aside from, of course, the social worker- who I'm fairly sure was not meant to fall in love with).For those who have not yet witnessed the movie and are reading reviews in hopes of an overview here is a short bit about what this movie is about: The movie takes place on a lovely little island. On the island there is a camp where boys meet and essentially become, what is similar to, boy scouts (in a more modern and less judgmental sense). One boy who attends this camp is a foster child, moved amidst many homes, and in dire need of a direction in life. On the other side of the island lives a family with two parental lawyers and four odd-in-their-own-way children. The eldest is a girl, whom I related to quite closely. A girl stuck in the position of moving forward to adulthood a bit too fast, being held back by parents who don't care as much as they should, yet too much in the wrong way. What more fitting couple than the lost foster child and the strong-willed daughter of a lawyer couple. So, alas, they run away together. And so the story begins. Young love in it's truest form, amidst not the most intelligent of decisions.The storyline was beautifully drawn out in a way that explores adolescent love for what it is; often condemned by adults and yearned for by those young and lucky enough to find it. I know that many people seem to think otherwise, and find the storyline to be inappropriate. The film does accurately portray some of the more... adult-themed actions of young adults. Many find this distasteful. But I found it honest, and the backdrop it was told amidst was just beautiful. I'm in love, and Moonrise Kingdom is among one of my very favorite movies. I can't really compare it to anything else- it's wonderful all on its own.",5,Beautiful Film Artistically Capturing Adolescent Love,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,3627,"['purchased', 'lovely', 'little', 'DVD', '2.00', 'local', 'store', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'rented', 'out', 'one', 'rented', 'it-', 'poor', 'little', 'thing', 'was', 'left', 'dusty', 'pile', ""'sale"", 'bin', 'undeserving', 'place', 'magnificent', 'film', ""'d"", 'read', 'many', 'beautiful', 'reviews', 'online', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'it-', 'living', 'rural', 'Alaska', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'place', 'buy', 'thing', 'rarely', 'buy', 'movies', 'anyways', 'when', 'came', 'very', 'affordable', 'price', 'snatched', 'up', 'carefully', 'carried', 'home', 'watched', 'almost', 'loved', 'dearly', 'know', 'received', 'interesting', 'view-points', 'audience', 'content', 'childish', 'quite', 'mature', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'many', 'may', 'find', 'inappropriate', 'found', 'truthfully', 'captured', 'what', 'are-', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'pre-adult', 'love', 'are', 'tastefully', 'captured', 'not', 'exploit', 'children', 'rather', 'simply', 'show', 'world', 'what', 'are', 'experiencing', 'awkward', 'comfortable', 'first', 'experiences', 'finding', 'one', 'least', 'one', 'think', ""'the"", 'one', '.The', 'scenery', 'magnificent', 'acting', 'people', 'involved', 'exquisite', 'was', 'especially', 'blown', 'away', 'younger', 'characters', 'how', 'well', 'one', 'shown', 'screen', 'dialogue', 'quick-witted', 'sarcastically-humorous', 'was', 'delightful', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'director', 'watching', 'look', 'forward', 'viewing', 'more', 'work', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'how', 'simply', 'dialogue', 'was', 'how', 'complex', 'storyline', 'was', 'involved', 'happened', 'be', 'was', 'combination', 'amazing', 'script', 'writing', 'well-done', 'filmography', 'actors', 'actresses', 'played', 'parts', 'just', 'right', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'being', 'cast', 'parts', 'fell', 'love', 'character', 'aside', 'course', 'social', 'worker-', 'who', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'sure', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'fall', 'love', '.For', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'witnessed', 'movie', 'are', 'reading', 'reviews', 'hopes', 'overview', 'here', 'short', 'bit', 'what', 'movie', 'movie', 'place', 'lovely', 'little', 'island', 'island', 'camp', 'where', 'meet', 'essentially', 'become', 'what', 'similar', 'boy', 'scouts', 'more', 'modern', 'less', 'judgmental', 'sense', 'One', 'boy', 'who', 'camp', 'foster', 'child', 'moved', 'amidst', 'many', 'homes', 'dire', 'need', 'direction', 'life', 'other', 'side', 'island', 'family', 'two', 'parental', 'lawyers', 'four', 'odd-in-their-own-way', 'children', 'eldest', 'girl', 'whom', 'related', 'quite', 'closely', 'A', 'girl', 'stuck', 'position', 'moving', 'forward', 'adulthood', 'bit', 'too', 'fast', 'being', 'held', 'back', 'parents', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'yet', 'too', 'much', 'wrong', 'way', 'What', 'more', 'fitting', 'couple', 'lost', 'foster', 'child', 'strong-willed', 'daughter', 'lawyer', 'couple', 'So', 'alas', 'run', 'away', 'together', 'so', 'story', 'Young', 'love', 'truest', 'form', 'not', 'most', 'intelligent', 'decisions.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'out', 'way', 'adolescent', 'love', 'what', 'often', 'condemned', 'adults', 'yearned', 'young', 'lucky', 'enough', 'find', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'think', 'otherwise', 'find', 'storyline', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'film', 'accurately', 'portray', 'more', 'adult-themed', 'actions', 'young', 'adults', 'Many', 'find', 'distasteful', 'found', 'honest', 'backdrop', 'was', 'told', 'amidst', 'was', 'just', 'beautiful', ""'m"", 'love', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'anything', 'else-', 'wonderful', 'own']",N/A

Ed Norton in a ""cub scout leader"" like uniform through the whole movie was just odd.

Their love story is very sweet, and the actors both in their first film are incredibly talented.  The girl, Suzy played by Kara Hayward reminded me of a young Abagail Breslin and the actor Sam, played by Jared Gilman was adorably odd and dorky with his slightly askew glasses and crooked smile.The scenes are set up beautifully and while the movie is slow, quiet and sweet, the love story of these two children affect all around them mostly for the better.I love the scenes of the two off on their own, making camp, fishing, taking inventory of their belongs and taking care of each other. Very sweet.There are a few scenes that I was uncomfortable with as the two youths (I sound like Joe Pesci), were 12ish during the filming and spend a bit of time in their underwear. I mostly imagine 70 or so people on the set while these two walk and dance around in their skivvies and how wrong that is.

It takes place during the summer of1965, on a sparsely populated island somewhere in New England. Twelve-year-old Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) has resigned his commission and gone AWOL with a miniature canoe and some supplies from a Khaki Scout camp under the command of Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). The local authority, police Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), goes looking for Sam only to discover that Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) is also missing from her parents' home. The young couple have apparently run off together, just as a hurricane works its way up the coast.Sam and Suzy have a hard time getting along with people, but they see themselves in each other and hit it off right away. In spite of their frustrations, they're full of youthful optimism and a yearning for adventure. And they go out and have that adventure, leaving the adults to worry and search frantically for them. These two young actors are very appealing, and their antics, however eyebrow-raising are sympathetic and funny. The adults are also sympathetic, if a bit disengaged from life until this incident galvanizes them. -With the exception of a woman representing social services (Tilda Swinton), who wants to have Sam committed. She seems to represent the menace of the mainland, where people do things differently than on the friendly, laid back island.I love the period touches -Suzy's minidresses and blue eye shadow, record player, and less neurotic, simpler, dispositions in general. But ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is not a period film. Anderson uses 1960s motifs when it suits him and anachronisms just as easily. Sam and Suzy are more romantically sophisticated than sheltered middle class kids were before the internet. Suzy's parents are both lawyers, which leaves me to wonder who takes care of her three little brothers if her mother works long hours. There were not many female lawyers in the 1960s, much less with young children. The couple is also old to have children that age by the standards of their generation.

1533739,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B007L6VR12,M. Oleson,"[9, 13]","What a nice surprise.  Somehow this traditional indi film escaped to the multiplexes and I had occasion to check it out.  For my taste Wes Anderson is a mixed bag when it comes to his projects.  I'm about 50/50 on the likability meter.  This is his best yet.  Co-written by Anderson and Roman Coppola, the cast contains some of the usual suspects including Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and Jason Schwartzman.The story, which takes place in 1965, revolves around a couple 12 year olds, both of which are seen as odd by their classmates and the adults around them.  Sam (Jared Gilman) is an orphan, seen as a troublemaker by his foster parents as well as his Scoutmaster (Edward Norton).  The girl, Suzy (Kara Hayward), likewise is a bit off-putting, has no friends and hates her parents (Murray and McDormand).  While watching a church play, Sam becomes smitten with Suzy dressed as a blackbird.  Suzy appreciates the attention and together they plot to leave their homes and go off together on a great adventure through the Rhode Island coastal wilderness.Bruce Willis is the local island cop who is also having an affair with Suzy's mom (McDormand).  I can't say enough about the cast.  Harvey Keitel plays a tight-assed Scout troop leader and Scoutmaster Ward's boss.  Tilda Swinton plays ""Social Services"" which is how she refers to herself.  Bob Balaban pops up here and there as The Narrator, keeping us informed as to time, location and an approaching storm.  Schwartzman is another Scout leader at another camp who agrees to help the young lovers for a bag of nickels.  Every character is wonderful and every actor delivers exacting performances.Having said that, much of the credit must go to first time film actors Gilman and Hayward.  Played with a straight face, their budding love feels right for their age.  Some of the best scenes are when Scout Sam (he says he has now resigned and is an ex-Scout) leads Suzy through the rocky hills and woods.

Last we heard from him, he brought us ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", a delightful stop-motion movie of all things. Now three years later, Anderson returns with this.""Moonrise Kingdom"" (94 min.) brings the story of 12 year olds Suzy and Sam, who have run away (she: from home; he: from scouts camp) on an idyllic island in the northeast in the summer of 1965. That is the starting premise of the movie, and to tell more would ruin your viewing pleasure. Several comments and observations: this movie captures a lot of things, but clearly tugs at the hearts of those who grew up in that era, now almost 50 years ago. It was a completely different world, where communication was not instant and not omni-present. In that sense, the movie is very nostalgic indeed. Second, the visuals of the movie are outstanding. Lots of brown and orange are filtered into the scenery, making it look even more idyllic that it already is. Third, the acting here is mostly superb, with lots of juicy performances from Bruce Willis (his best in years), Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and even Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel in short cameos (Swinton as the Social Worker, and Keitel as Commander Pierce).But the jewel piece in the movie goes to the 12 year old actors, Jared Gilman as Sam and even more so Kara Hayward as Suzie. She is simply amazing. I enjoyed this movie immensely. It is funny, poignant, and whimsical at its very best. I read that this movie was made on a $16 million dollar budget, which is less than 1/10th of many of the current blockbuster movies. It's amazing how much more can be achieved with so much less.

This story all begins on an island, and no one else seems to live there but the people involved.Suzy, played by Kara Howard lives with her family on this island. She seems to be the 'difficult' one in the family. On the same island is a Boy Scout camp, where Sam, played by Jared Gilman, an orphan, also seems to be the odd man out.  No one seems to like him, and strangely he and Suzy met last summer and have planned a rendezvous to run away together. This sets the wheels in motion for an adolescence hunt by some very strange people.  Bill Murray plays Suzy's father, and Frances McDormand plays her mother. Any film with McDormand amd Murray is sure to be a great one. We also have Bruce Willis playing the Island Policeman, Scoutman Ward payed by Ed Norton, and SocialServices played by Tilda Swinton. All these characters lead to an often time humorous film that deals with the turmoil of adolescence, the goodness of scouting, and the trials and tribulations of life.This film is all played with straight faces, none for laughs, and the children are as superb as the adults.

Elements of magical realism (like an impossibly high tree house, a character struck by lightning, or the strangely elaborate infrastructure of the fictional Khaki Scouts) help you suspend your sense of place and realize that you're in a fairy tale.And the soundtrack is inspired! the music switches back and forth between Benjamin Britten and Hank Williams, and it just works, propelling the story forward in a way that you just don't want it to stop.I dare you not to fall in love with this film.

Despite the presence of several top notch actors - Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, and others, its quirkiness is so over-the-top that it never rings true.  There is not a single character in the movie that acts in a realistic manner.  One could argue that since, after all, it is meant to be a fantasy film it need not be realistic, but any fantasy film still needs some grounding in some semblance of reality.I found the relationship between the two lead children, which some have characterized as whimsically innocent, to be only creepy.  What is their mutual attraction based on, simply that they both are weirdo outcasts?  There appears to be a sexual element which seems hardly innocent in two preadolescents.  The adult characters are all strange ducks - but not in any cute cuddly way - they all seem capable of being ax murderers in their lives off-screen (except for the Bruce Willis character).Finally, the characterization of the Boy Scouts in this film is so exaggerated, so stereotypically negative (whose leaders seem either Nazi control freaks or potential pedophiles) that it loses any sense of credibility.Critics seem to love indy director Wes Anderson, I find his quirkiness only annoying - witness Rushmore, The Royal Tenenabaums, and my most un-favorite, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.

Zwick,"[4, 7]","***1/2Highly original in both concept and style -as is customary with any Wes Anderson production - ""Moonrise Kingdom"" nevertheless proves that, even in the most skillful of hands, a little quirkiness can go a long way.Set in 1965, this surrealistic indie comedy focuses on two misfit children - one a twelve-year-old orphan and the other the daughter of two whacked-out parents - who run off to a remote New England island so they can live in isolation with one another, right as a hurricane is about to hit the area.The talented Jared Gilman and Kara Haywood play the two social outcasts, while the adults are portrayed by Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman and Harvey Keitel as an assortment of parents, troop leaders, detectives and social services officials. The irony is that most of the adults turn out to be even more bizarre and dysfunctional than the children who've run away because they just don't fit in.Co-written  by Roman Coppola and Wes  Anderson and directed by Anderson, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is overflowing with wit, striking imagery and on-the-mark deadpan performances. But the archness does get to be a bit much at times, and the atonal, emotionless line readings eventually take their toll on the audience.It's a clever and likable enough little trifle that, even at a relatively brief 94-minute running time, winds up overstaying its welcome.

Call it a neighborhood.Wes Anderson's films always remind me of the saying about Chinese food:  you feel full enough while seated at the table, but half an hour later you're hungry again.I would like to like this movie.  In fact, I'd like to like several of Wes Anderson's movies.  They generally start with an intriguing premise and a talented cast.  Opening scenes promise a strong story, characters we can relate to, situations that touch our emotions.  But then, somewhere along the line, the storyline blurs, characters lose their focus, connections between scenes become tenuous or downright missing.  The original concept becomes muddied, the victim of a director who can't seem to maintain his interest in a central theme for enough minutes to add up to a feature film.Moonrise Kingdom is like a book you pick up expecting a novel and instead find yourself reading a collection of vaguely related short stories.  There's no lack of humor or cleverness or emotional highlights.  But the pieces don't add up to a whole.

1533823,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B007L6VR12,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","Thanks to two appealing juvenile leads, Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" succeeds in engaging and sometimes moving us.  Set in coastal New England in 1965, it is about two misfit thirteen-year-olds who fall in love (each, it seems, intuiting the other's ""misfittedness"") and decide to run away together and set up a home/camp where they can live isolated from the world of their parents and other adult authorities.  Since the boy, Sam, has survival skills (he runs away from a scout camp) and the girl, Suzy, is as resourceful in her way (she brings the scissors and other things), they do pretty well.  Suzy's parents are two lawyers (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) who seem as indifferent to each other as they are to their children, and their marital conversation is mainly about the cases they're working on.  The fact that the mother communicates with her children via bullhorn is obviously both funny and pointed.  Sam is an orphan in foster care, and Edward Norton is the well-meaning scoutmaster of Sam's troop.  These three adults and the local sheriff (Bruce Willis) are the ones who have to deal with the fact that the young people have run off.All of that seems ordinary enough, but Anderson frames the story in interesting ways, both visually and dramaturgically.  The adult world of the scout camp and Suzy's home is presented in terms of a high degree of linear organization: rooms are boxy and behaviour is regimented to a cartoonish extent, and the regimentation of the scout troop is very clear, and the impression that the viewer gets is of two young people trying to get away from life in a cartoon and escape into something more authentic.  The parents and scoutmaster are emotionally incompetent to a comic degree, and the only adult who seems to have an inkling of the kind of freer life the young people want is the sheriff, who in a climactic scene faces down Social Services.  Tilda Swindon literally calls herself ""Social Services"" and that tells us all we need to know about the ""flattening"" of most of the adult figures in the movie.  Swindon is marvelous in the role, and Bruce Willis as her antagonist gives a performance of great charm.  Bill Murray here has a role that fits well with his usual deadpan affectless schtick, but he remains, for me at least, a very limited actor.  In the course of the movie most of the adults unfreeze to some extent.  McDormand, who is presented as being drawn to the sheriff, has a touching scene with her daughter at the end.Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward are Sam and Suzy.  Neither actually says ""There must be more to life than this"" as they view the adult world, but the seriousness with which they take both their escape (very carefully planned) and their affection is both funny and endearing.  They are trying to act as the kind of adults that they want to be -- not the kinds of adults who have shaped their lives thus far. The deadpan seriousness with which they take all this is funny -- they even go through a form of marriage and unembarassedly acknowledge their sexual feelings, which seem to them to have nothing to do with their love, which has more to do with their mutual recognition as misfits.  The young actors pull off Anderson's conceptions of their characters just about perfectly.  One way of understanding them, I think, is to say that they want a narrative, and it's no accident that Suzy takes half-a-dozen storybooks along on the escape, and we see her read aloud from them on several occasions.  This perhaps clues us to the idea that adult life in the movie has stopped -- it has no ongoing story, at least as far as the young people can perceive, and no story means no future, so they decide to create their own.  Maybe with the onset of adolescence we all do this -- adolescent ""rebellion"" is a bit of a cliche, but here Anderson manages to find a fresh way of representing it.  Maybe too the allusions to Britten's children's opera ""Noyes Flood"" (based on a medieval drama about Noah) are deployed to suggest this: the flood (looked at it one way) is a chance for a new start, and it is seeing Suzy dressed for the part of a raven in a local performance of the opera that wins Sam's heart, so to speak.  The movie ends after its own flood (a hurricane), and if Bob Balaban, the narrator who frames the whole story, is to be believed, it ushers in a sense of renewal that extends even to the crops in subsequent years.  With that suggestion, Anderson reminds us of the apparent natural magic of renewal, not only in the natural cycle but in the revelations that can follow crises in narratives.  (To put it like that sounds heavy-handed, but the movie itself avoids the portentousness that thematic analysis is prone to fall into!)I'll avoid spoilers, and say nothing about the fact that there are really two escapes, the details of the storm, the scout troop's pursuit of the runaways, or the sheriff's defense of Sam.  It's a comic movie, finally, and it clocks in at just about 90 minutes, so it doesn't drag.  The degree of stylization with which the adult world is presented keeps us at the distance required to appreciate both the pains of growing up, the dangers of having grown up, and the need to keep open the possibility of change and (if we're lucky) growth.",4,innocence and experience,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,5274,"['Thanks', 'two', 'appealing', 'juvenile', 'leads', 'Wes', 'Anderson',

It's not a perfect movie:  Jared Gilman, the boy lead, is uneven (he's best when not speaking), and the themes and execution are a little too close to another Wes Anderson gem, ""Rushmore.""  But if you can get past that, the movie is well worth your time.  Kara Hayward is sweetly teed off as Suzy, that girl from childhood you always hoped had the potential to grow to independence without instead disappointing you and becoming a self-loving twit, and I don't know that I've ever seen Bruce Willis or Edward Norton in better form.  Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Bob Balaban, and Frances McDormand are all used sparingly, and less really is more.  What of the plot?  To describe it here would rob you of the joy of simply experiencing it, but suffice it to say, in an age of ham-fisted garbage like ""The Notebook"" and ""Twilight,"" it's a refreshing coming-of-age comedy romance for the rest of us, much more ""Amelie"" than ""Titanic,"" thank goodness.  As a former Boy Scout (yeah, I sometimes have a hard time believing that, too), I'm also stunned at how well the movie captures the oeuvre of just what that means.  Sure, they're called the ""Khaki Scouts"" here, but there are the same kooky, pseudo-military attitudes mixed in with an aw-shucks saccharine purity -- Anderson steeps his production in such authenticity that I could smell the musty canvas tents again, feel the scratchy cotton of the heavy olive drab shirts.

1533828,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B007L6VR12,Steven Aldersley,"[9, 13]","***This review contains spoilers***I have to admit that I hadn't seen any Wes Anderson films until two or three years ago and Moonrise Kingdom is the first that I have had the pleasure of seeing in the theater.My first Anderson experience was Bottle Rocket, and it didn't strike me as remarkable the first time I saw it. However, I found myself thinking about it over the next few days and ended up buying the Criterion Blu-ray.I think there are a couple of important things to understand about Anderson's films:The first is the level of detail. It's an assault on the brain and I've come to appreciate subsequent viewings more than with most films. Many lesser comedies fall flat because they run out of ideas and end up repeating them until they approach 90 minutes. Anderson's films have so many ideas it's ridiculous, but five of his seven films are also over by the 94-minute mark. The difference is that they are crammed with ideas and feel fresh and original.The other major thing to note is the brand of humor. Call it offbeat or quirky, or whatever you like, but it's certainly distinctive. It's the type of humor that uses a phrase or situation which is familiar to you, but surprises you by giving it a different meaning. Think of Police Squad, Naked Gun, or Monty Python, and you'll understand what I mean. Like David Lynch, I think Anderson's mind makes unusual connections that most are incapable of. In order to appreciate his films, you need to investigate all of his worlds and understand the way that he thinks. It might be too much work for the casual viewer.Let's get to Moonrise Kingdom.The film is set in the 1960s on a small island off New England. It evokes a sense of nostalgia that's present throughout. This is a time in which cell phones and most electronic entertainment didn't exist. Take a look at the primitive record player for example. The story focuses on the budding romance between Sam (Gilman) and Suzy (Hayward). Sam is a scout and invites Suzy to run away with him, causing the small town to send out a search party.The supporting cast includes some big names and a few Anderson favorites. The local cop is played by Bruce Willis and he's particularly effective in the role. The Scout Master is played by Edward Norton, who has an exaggerated sense of his own importance. He provides a lot of the humor in the few scenes he is in. Look out for the homage to The Shawshank Redemption when he discovers that Sam is missing.Frances McDormand and Bill Murray play a married couple and both are lawyers. Jason Schwartzman's appearance is brief, but he makes good use of the time. One of my favorite characters is played by Tilda Swinton, and she is simply referred to as Social Services. Even Bob Balaban's narration is funny. It's hard to go into any more detail without ruining the entire plot, such as it is, so I'll stop there.I mentioned that Anderson's films require several viewings to take in all the details, but I have to say that Moonrise Kingdom had an immediate impact on me. This is my style of humor and it felt like a Coen brothers movie, such as Burn After Reading, at times. Nothing much happens, but it's the style that's important. If you like Anderson's other films, you will almost certainly appreciate this.I sometimes wonder what kind of childhood Anderson had. Are these characters based on his own experiences? Most are intelligent and suffered something of a troubled upbringing. When I think of Sam, or Max (from Rushmore), am I seeing the way Anderson views his own early life? Dysfunctional families are a favorite topic of his and Moonrise Kingdom is filled with them. Perhaps I had such an immediate connection to the film because it felt familiar after seeing his other work?I'll close by saying that Anderson's films won't have universal or even large appeal, but if you appreciate his quirky style, you might just end up loving everything he does. I know that's true for me. I'll always remember that I first watched the film on my 50th birthday with two friends I have known since I was 11. That was a great experience and I would like to watch Moonrise Kingdom again right now.Overall score 4.5/5 (with the potential to rise to 5/5 after repeat viewings).",5,A great way to spend my 50th birthday,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,4227,"['***This', 'review', 'contains', 'spoilers***I', 'have', 'admit', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'films', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'first', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'theater.My', 'first', 'Anderson', 'experience', 'was', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'remarkable', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'However', 'found', 'thinking', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'Criterion', 'Blu-ray.I', 'think', 'are', 'couple', 'important', 'things', 'understand', 'Anderson', 'films', 'first', 'level', 'detail', 'assault', 'brain', ""'ve"", 'come', 'appreciate', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'more', 'most', 'films', 'Many', 'lesser', 'comedies', 'fall', 'flat', 'run', 'ideas', 'end', 'up', 'repeating', 'approach', '90', 'minutes', 'Anderson', 'films', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'ideas', 'ridiculous', 'five', 'seven', 'films', 'are', 'also', '94-minute', 'mark', 'difference', 'are', 'crammed', 'ideas', 'feel', 'fresh', 'other', 'major', 'thing', 'note', 'brand', 'humor', 'Call', 'quirky', 'like', 'certainly', 'distinctive', 'type', 'humor', 'phrase', 'situation', 'familiar', 'surprises', 'giving', 'different', 'meaning', 'Think', 'Police', 'Squad', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'Monty', 'Python', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'mean', 'David', 'Lynch', 'think', 'Anderson', 'mind', 'unusual', 'connections', 'most', 'are', 'incapable', 'order', 'appreciate', 'films', 'need', 'investigate', 'worlds', 'understand', 'way', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'casual', 'viewer.Let', 'get', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom.The', 'film', 'set', '1960s', 'small', 'island', 'New', 'England', 'sense', 'nostalgia', 'present', 'time', 'cell', 'phones', 'most', 'electronic', 'entertainment', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Take', 'look', 'primitive', 'record', 'player', 'example', 'story', 'budding', 'romance', 'Sam', 'Gilman', 'Suzy', 'Hayward', 'Sam', 'scout', 'Suzy', 'run', 'away', 'causing', 'small', 'town', 'send', 'out', 'search', 'party.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'big', 'names', 'few', 'Anderson', 'favorites', 'local', 'cop', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'particularly', 'effective', 'role', 'Scout', 'Master', 'played', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'exaggerated', 'sense', 'own', 'importance', 'lot', 'humor', 'few', 'scenes', 'Look', 'out', 'homage', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'when', 'Sam', 'missing.Frances', 'McDormand', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'play', 'married', 'couple', 'are', 'lawyers', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'appearance', 'brief', 'good', 'use', 'time', 'One', 'favorite', 'characters', 'played', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'simply', 'referred', 'Social', 'Services', 'Even', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'narration', 'funny', 'hard', 'go', 'more', 'detail', 'ruining', 'entire', 'plot', 'such', 'so', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'there.I', 'mentioned', 'Anderson', 'films', 'require', 'several', 'viewings', 'take', 'details', 'have', 'say', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'had', 'immediate', 'impact', 'style', 'humor', 'felt', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'movie', 'such', 'Burn', 'Reading', 'times', 'Nothing', 'much', 'happens', 'style', 'important', 'like', 'Anderson', 'other', 'films', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'this.I', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'what', 'kind', 'childhood', 'Anderson', 'had', 'Are', 'characters', 'based', 'own', 'experiences', 'Most', 'are', 'intelligent', 'suffered', 'something', 'troubled', 'upbringing', 'When', 'think', 'Sam', 'Max', 'Rushmore', 'am', 'seeing', 'way', 'Anderson', 'own', 'early', 'life', 'Dysfunctional', 'families', 'are', 'favorite', 'topic', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'filled', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'such', 'immediate', 'connection', 'film', 'felt', 'familiar', 'seeing', 'other', 'work', ""'ll"", 'close', 'saying', 'Anderson', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'universal', 'even', 'large', 'appeal', 'appreciate', 'quirky', 'style', 'might', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'everything', 'know', 'true', ""'ll"", 'always', 'remember', 'first', 'watched', 'film', '50th', 'birthday', 'two', 'friends', 'have', 'known', 'was', '11', 'was', 'great', 'experience', 'would', 'like', 'watch', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'again', 'right', 'now.Overall', 'score', '4.5/5', 'potential', 'rise', '5/5', 'repeat', 'viewings']",N/A

The scriptwriter seems to have borrowed the technique of stilted dialog and quirky characters from ""Fargo"" but someone forgot that the audience has to care about the characters.  The single biggest flaw  of this film is the casting of the male lead, Sam, played by Jared Gilman. Sadly, this kid has no charisma.  How he made it through the screen test is a complete mystery; they could have probably dragged some random kid out of any 5th grade class in America and gotten someone more appealing.  It's hard to ""care"" what happens to him. In fact, he's close to unlikeable.  And so, there is a hole at the heart of the movie, for which all the other excellent actors--who do a good job with their roles--just can't compensate.  The second biggest flaw is the casting of his supposedly pre-teen love interest, who seems to have some sort of never-explained mood disorder. Once again, a little back-story might have helped, as would the casting of someone who looks and acts closer to age 11/12 than 17.  I might also say that whoever wrote the dialog for these kids apparently hasn't talked to a preadolescent in a looooong time.  Here's a clue:  kids don't talk like Wikipedia and if they do, it turns everyone else off.  There is a sort of semi-sex scene with these two kids late in the movie which as a pediatrician and child psychiatrist made my skin crawl.  It was unnecessary and gratuitous and frankly creepy.

1533838,A256QKS1DIQ54U,B007L6VR12,T. Bollinger,"[1, 4]","Idiosyncratic it may be, but a great film it most certainly is not. Wes Anderson&#8217;s &#8216;Moonrise Kingdom&#8217; is a (somewhat) heartwarming, yet not-so-innocent tale of two, young outcasts who find refuge in each other and eventually fall in love. But it is almost as much about the adult characters in the story, who both affect and are affected by the youngsters around which the story revolves.Most of the dialogue is funny and witty, as is the case with every Anderson flick. I was on board with the story for the first half of the film, but towards the end, things starting getting&#8230;um&#8230;stupid. Over-the-top natural disasters and slapstick comedy started to become too much to take in all at once. I felt that these events distracted from the central characters of the story, including the excellent performances turned in by Willis and Norton. The superstorm event is fine, but it goes on for far too long in such an over-the-top fashion.Another thing I would like to add is that the two child leads of the film, played by Gilman and Hayward, play their characters in a pretty uninspired fashion. In other words, the two lead characters are uninteresting, and in some cases, downright dull. Anderson seems to be under the impression that, just because characters are weird and quirky, they will automatically be interesting and we will automatically care about them. I would beg to differ. What made the idiosyncratic protagonists work in Anderson&#8217;s other films like &#8216;Rushmore&#8217; and &#8216;The Life Aquatic&#8217; was their depth and very human qualities. Gilman and Hayward do not embody those characteristics at all. I don&#8217;t really care about their problems because their personalities have no color and there&#8217;s nothing interesting about them, save that they both say weird and eccentric things. I do not understand what all the accolades are about regarding this picture, because there is virtually nothing special or particularly memorable about our two leads&#8217; weirdness. Assuredly, &#8216;Moonrise&#8217; has all the trademarks typical of every Wes Anderson drama, namely, cartoony and over-the-top violence (be it explicit or implied), oddball characters, very peculiar humor and dialogue, and a whimsical tone. I have a hard time believing that my lack of love for this film is due to my inexperience with Anderson&#8217;s filmography, as I loved &#8216;Rushmore&#8217; and had a great time with &#8216;The Life Aquatic.&#8217;By the end of the film, I actually found myself wishing the story had centered around Bruce Willis&#8217; and Edward Norton&#8217;s characters. We could have actually gotten to know more about the not-so-important-and-kind-of-a-wasted-opportunity that was Willis&#8217; affair with Francis McDormand, and we could have spent a lot more time with the whacky Khaki Scouts.So, taken together as a whole, I see this as an entertaining, yet ultimately unsatisfying drama. It was merely &#8220;better than average&#8221; when it could have and should have been great. I like Wes Anderson&#8217;s style and I hold several of his films in very high esteem, but this just isn&#8217;t one of them. It is not up to par with his best works on any level, save for its eccentricity, which alone cannot act as a selling point for this movie. Lots of people can relate to the feeling of not fitting in, or know someone whose individuality causes them to be isolated, but the trick is writing eccentric characters with narratives that we can relate to personally, and hopefully like. &#8216;Moonrise Kingdom&#8217; did not win me over.&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-SCORE: 6/10+ Some clever humor, Willis and Norton are fun, and Anderson&#8217;s trademark unique visuals work well.- The child leads are boring as hell.

1533857,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B007L6VR12,Tom Birkenstock,"[7, 10]","Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom opens with the sound of the composer Benjamin Britten's ""Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra,"" which breaks down, piece by piece, each section of the orchestra and then later builds it back up.  The work is reminiscent of opening up a pocket watch in order to see all of the gears working in conjunction.  It is not lost on the audience that as Britten's music is deconstructed, Anderson presents the inside of a household, using perfectly choreographed camera movements, that is itself immaculately designed by the eye of an idiosyncratic artist.  This got me thinking: is Wes Anderson one of our greatest creators of fantasy worlds?It might seem strange to suggest that Anderson should be mentioned alongside people like C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and George R.R. Martin.  You won't find dragons or magic spells in his work, but what you will find is a hermetically sealed universe that seems to jump wholesale out of the mind of a singular artist.  Is Anderson's fetish for vintage audio equipment that far removed from Tolkien's love of medieval verse?  While every one of Anderson's films is created in a world that is slightly out of step from our own, of all his live action work Moonrise Kingdom seems to rest out on its own plane of existence.And much of Moonrise Kingdom's potency comes from the understanding that children and adults inhabit distinct and separate realms.  The film takes place in the 1960s on a sleepy New England island, New Penzance, which is not only largely separated from the mainland but also bares a name that would look comfortable written on a map of a fantasy world.  This close knit community is frayed when two young children, Sam and Suzy, go on the lam, making their way deep into the woods of the island thanks to skills Sam has picked up attending the Khaki Scouts.  As the children retreat into the wilderness, the adults scramble to catch up with them.  As we move back and forth between the adult world and the world of children, we understand the distinct sort of dysfunction that infects both.  In the 1960s both Sam and Suzy might have been called ""trouble children.""  Sam is an orphan who doesn't fit in well with his foster family (in fact, his foster father decides that he won't invite him back to the house after hearing about his flight) and Suzy is prone to outbursts of violence and rage.  But where the children have trouble suppressing their emotions, the adults, in typical Andersonian fashion, hide their dysfunction under a laconic haze.  Suzy's mother and father (played by Francis MacDormond and Bill Murray) are mired in a loveless marriage, which has led her mother to take up with the local police chief, Sharp (Bruce Willis).Wes Anderson clues us into his interest in world making through a series of books that Suzy brings along on her retreat with Sam.  These books carry fantastical names like The Francine Odyssey, The Disappearance of the 6th Grade, and The Girl from Jupiter.  This need for escapism obviously parallels the children's flight into the woods.  To disappear into the world of fantasy isn't far off from dropping off the map and slipping out from under the expectations of adults.  Anderson constructs this universe with the help of a map as well as the narrating power of Bob Ballaban, who doubles as a wizard-like character who figures out how to catch up with Sam and Suzy.  As the film progresses, it becomes further and further detached from our world.  In fact, at times it seems as if Anderson is applying techniques he learned in his animated film, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, onto a live action palate.  This allows him to ratchet up the scope of his film towards the end by introducing a flood that seems to be borrowed from one of the world's most famous fantasy epics, The Old Testament.But of all the great fantasy writers out there, perhaps none pervade Anderson's universe more than the great artist, Charles M. Schulz.  Anderson, never one to be shy about his influences, even names a dog Snoopy.  In Peanuts, Schulz may have created one of the longest lasting fantasy worlds, stretching out over a half of a century.  And while he may have made the adults invisible (they only appeared in the TV specials as indecipherable and disembodied voices), he never ran away from adult concerns.  Where Anderson creates a world where two misfits can largely escape the dysfunctions of the adult world, Schultz had his prepubescent characters shoulder the crushing burdens of existential malaise.  And yet, there's something refreshing about the optimism found in Moonrise Kingdom, along with much of Anderson's work (an optimism that Schultz often struggled to find).  He manages to be both critical and highly empathetic towards his characters.  For Anderson, a fantasy world isn't so much a retreat as it is an invitation, and one that I am never hesitant to take up.",5,Wes Anderson's Fantasy Epic,1343520000,"07 29, 2012",2012,4895,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'sound', 'composer', 'Benjamin', 'Britten', 'Young', 'Person', 'Guide', 'Orchestra', 'down', 'piece', 'piece', 'section', 'orchestra', 'then', 'later', 'back', 'up', 'work', 'reminiscent', 'opening', 'up', 'pocket', 'watch', 'order', 'see', 'gears', 'working', 'conjunction', 'not', 'lost', 'audience', 'Britten', 'music', 'deconstructed', 'Anderson', 'inside', 'household', 'using', 'perfectly', 'choreographed', 'camera', 'movements', 'immaculately', 'designed', 'eye', 'idiosyncratic', 'artist', 'got', 'thinking', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'one', 'greatest', 'creators', 'fantasy', 'worlds', 'might', 'seem', 'strange', 'suggest', 'Anderson', 'should', 'be', 'mentioned', 'alongside', 'people', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'dragons', 'magic', 'spells', 'work', 'what', 'will', 'find', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'universe', 'jump', 'wholesale', 'mind', 'singular', 'artist', 'Anderson', 'fetish', 'vintage', 'audio', 'equipment', 'far', 'removed', 'Tolkien', 'love', 'medieval', 'verse', 'one', 'Anderson', 'films', 'created', 'world', 'slightly', 'step', 'own', 'live', 'action', 'work', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'rest', 'out', 'own', 'plane', 'existence.And', 'much', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'potency', 'understanding', 'children', 'adults', 'inhabit', 'distinct', 'separate', 'realms', 'film', 'place', '1960s', 'sleepy', 'New', 'England', 'island', 'New', 'Penzance', 'not', 'only', 'largely', 'separated', 'mainland', 'also', 'name', 'would', 'look', 'comfortable', 'written', 'map', 'fantasy', 'world', 'close', 'knit', 'community', 'frayed', 'when', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'Sam', 'Suzy', 'go', 'lam', 'making', 'way', 'deep', 'woods', 'island', 'thanks', 'skills', 'Sam', 'picked', 'up', 'attending', 'Khaki', 'Scouts', 'children', 'retreat', 'wilderness', 'adults', 'scramble', 'catch', 'up', 'move', 'back', 'forth', 'adult', 'world', 'world', 'children', 'understand', 'distinct', 'sort', 'dysfunction', '1960s', 'Sam', 'Suzy', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'trouble', 'children', 'Sam', 'orphan', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well', 'foster', 'family', 'fact', 'foster', 'father', 'wo', ""n't"", 'invite', 'back', 'house', 'hearing', 'flight', 'Suzy', 'prone', 'outbursts', 'violence', 'rage', 'where', 'children', 'have', 'trouble', 'suppressing', 'emotions', 'adults', 'typical', 'Andersonian', 'fashion', 'hide', 'dysfunction', 'laconic', 'haze', 'Suzy', 'mother', 'father', 'played', 'Francis', 'MacDormond', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'are', 'mired', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'led', 'mother', 'take', 'up', 'local', 'police', 'chief', 'Sharp', 'Bruce', 'Willis', '.Wes', 'Anderson', 'interest', 'world', 'making', 'series', 'books', 'Suzy', 'along', 'retreat', 'Sam', 'books', 'carry', 'fantastical', 'names', 'Francine', 'Odyssey', 'Disappearance', '6th', 'Grade', 'Girl', 'Jupiter', 'need', 'escapism', 'obviously', 'children', 'flight', 'woods', 'disappear', 'world', 'fantasy', ""n't"", 'far', 'dropping', 'off', 'map', 'slipping', 'out', 'expectations', 'adults', 'Anderson', 'universe', 'help', 'map', 'as', 'well', 'narrating', 'power', 'Bob', 'Ballaban', 'who', 'wizard-like', 'character', 'who', 'out', 'how', 'catch', 'up', 'Sam', 'Suzy', 'film', 'further', 'further', 'detached', 'world', 'fact', 'times', 'Anderson', 'applying', 'techniques', 'learned', 'animated', 'film', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'live', 'action', 'palate', 'ratchet', 'up', 'scope', 'film', 'end', 'introducing', 'flood', 'be', 'borrowed', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'fantasy', 'epics', 'Old', 'Testament.But', 'great', 'fantasy', 'writers', 'there', 'perhaps', 'none', 'pervade', 'Anderson', 'universe', 'more', 'great', 'artist', 'Charles', 'M.', 'Schulz', 'Anderson', 'never', 'one', 'be', 'shy', 'influences', 'even', 'dog', 'Snoopy', 'Peanuts', 'Schulz', 'may', 'have', 'created', 'one', 'longest', 'lasting', 'fantasy', 'worlds', 'stretching', 'out', 'half', 'century', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'adults', 'invisible', 'only', 'appeared', 'TV', 'specials', 'indecipherable', 'disembodied', 'voices', 'never', 'ran', 'away', 'adult', 'concerns', 'Where', 'Anderson', 'world', 'where', 'two', 'misfits', 'can', 'largely', 'escape', 'dysfunctions', 'adult', 'world', 'Schultz', 'had', 'prepubescent', 'characters', 'shoulder', 'crushing', 'burdens', 'existential', 'malaise', 'yet', 'something', 'refreshing', 'optimism', 'found', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'much', 'Anderson', 'work', 'optimism', 'Schultz', 'often', 'struggled', 'find', 'be', 'critical', 'highly', 'empathetic', 'towards', 'characters', 'Anderson', 'fantasy', 'world', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'retreat', 'invitation', 'one', 'am', 'never', 'hesitant', 'take', 'up']",N/A

Something that made you want to abandon your life and run away with them? Not me, but the same can't be said for two teens at the center of the latest comedy from the mind of Wes Anderson.It's 1965 and, on a small, picturesque island in New England, there are two very unhappy children. One of them, Sam Shakusky (played by Jared Gilman), is an orphan visiting Camp Ivanhoe with his troop of wilderness-oriented Khaki Scouts. The other, Suzy Bishop (played by Kara Hayward), lives on the island with her parents, Walt and Laura (played by veteran actors Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and three younger brothers. Walt and Laura (Murray and McDormand) are both attorneys who are struggling to maintain both their personal and their professional relationship. One year before the beginning of our story, Sam and Suzy meet backstage during a play which Sam is attending and Suzy is acting in. Despite the brevity of that encounter, the two find themselves inexorably drawn to each other and exchange letters during their separation. They vow to run away together the next summer. We fast-forward to '65 and Sam has vanished from Camp Ivanhoe and done it without alerting his scout master, Randy Ward (played by Edward Norton) or any of his fellow scouts. The search is well underway before the Sheriff, Captain Sharp (played by Bruce Willis) is made aware of the fact that Suzy has vanished as well. When the young lovers meet again, Sam has brought a multitude of camping necessities while Suzy brought books, her cat, records and a record player. They hike and camp for days until finding a deserted cove and make camp, naming their new home Moonrise Kingdom.Obviously, there is more to the story. There's the revelation that two of the adult characters are involved in a clandestine relationship of their own, additional details of Sam's life story are revealed, and his eventual confrontation with his former scout troop who see it as their responsibility to bring Sam back using any means necessary, including lethal. All this culminates in a scene that had me on the edge of my seat. More than likely, this film, like some of director Wes Anderson's previous efforts, will fail to resonate with the viewing public.

Others might say it's simply trivial. Perhaps the best assessment is somewhere in between. One thing for sure is that the cinematography is a visual feast. Set in 1965 on the fictional New England island of New Pezance, it was actually shot around Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island.'Moonrise' is formulaic up to a point. Quirky comedies usually feature protagonists who are outsiders, non-conformist, slightly emotionally unstable and victims of persecution by an established order. In this case, Sam Shakusky and Suzy Bishop fit the bill. A year before the break into the 'Second Act' where Sam and Suzy run off to their 'Moonrise Kingdom', they become pen pals after meeting at a church performance of Noye's Fluddle. A year later, Sam, who has a history of acting out behavior, finds himself ostracized by his Scout troop and then is dropped by his foster family after he disappears at his 'Khaki Scout' summer camp. Suzy comes from a more 'stable' family of dysfunctional attorney parents but also has behavior problems, and ends up running off with her 'soul mate', the equally troubled Sam.Quirky comedies also feature a group (or groups) who persecute our quirky heroes. In this case, Sam is the subject of vituperation by his scout troop. Similarly, Suzy is rejected by her parents, who have no tolerance for her rebellious ways. Perhaps the most unpleasant scene in 'Moonrise Kingdom' is when the Scout Troop attempts to chase down Sam out in the forest. Fortunately, director Wes Anderson later redeems his antagonists. The scout troop realizes that they've been bullying Sam and finally decide to help him. Suzy's parents also realize the error of their ways and employing their legal acumen, aid Captain Sharp as he adopts Sam and prevents the Social Services matron from hauling Sam off to the Juvenile Refuge.With both actors playing wondrously against type, Bruce Willis and Edward Norton as Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton), also play characters worthy of redemption. Sharp, who's been having an affair with Suzy's mother, Laura Bishop, ends the affair and later nobly adopts Sam. And Randy, who initially loses his scout troop after they split camp aiding Sam, saves his superior, Commander Pierce, after Pierce demotes him for incompetence. Only the Social Services matron, who represents bureaucracy, finds no redemption in Anderson's redemptive pageant.'Moonrise Kingdom' feels a bit too long especially when Sam and Suzy run away TWICE. And we also see one too many chases throughout the film. Nonetheless, Wes Anderson employs a number of great creative touches that distract us from the drawn out narrative. I'm referring of course to the fictional books he creates for Suzy as well employing the marvelous Benjamin Britten music.One must realize that Anderson's characters are farcical types--not meant to be at all realistic. Rather, he's gently poking fun at those neurotic type of adults who lack insight into their own behavior. Fortunately, Anderson ends things on a positive note, as most of the adults such as the Bishops and Captain Sharp, redeem themselves in the end.

1533875,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B007L6VR12,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[43, 49]","It is something of a challenge to write a review of a Wes Anderson film. How do you explain a film where the soundtrack includes pieces by Hank Williams and Benjamin Britten and yet they both fit perfectly?  Everything about Anderson's style is so unique, from the way the visual shots are composed and the way the dialogue is written to the way the actors deliver the dialogue, not to mention the myriad odd little background details that are worked in throughout.  It's almost impossible to simply describe the film and still do it proper justice.  The best I can really say about Moonrise Kingdom is that it's arguably the ultimate Wes Anderson film, his masterpiece at least to date. And I say that as someone who isn't - or at least wasn't prior to this film - a particular fan of his work.Written by Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola, Moonrise Kingdom takes place in the summer of 1965 on an island off the coast of New England, where two twelve-year-old misfits - Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) run off together into the wilderness because they've fallen in love.  In flashback, we learn that Sam, an orphan who's a member of Khaki Scout Troop 55, which has its summer camp every year on the island, and Suzy, whose utterly dysfunctional family has a summer house on the island, met the previous summer and felt an instant affinity for each other, which resulted in their corresponding over the year and hatching a plan to run away together when the two of them would again be on the island the following summer.  When they meet up, each brings what they think they'll need to survive.  Sam brings camping equipment; Suzy brings six books, her cat, and a portable record player.A search begins for the two runaways when their respective adults notice they're missing.  In the case of Sam, this is Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton), and in Suzy's case, her lawyer parents, Walt Bishop (Bill Murray) and Laura Bishop (Frances McDormand) , who in turn call in the island's local police chief, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), who we subsequently learn has been having a long-term affair with Laura that both realize is hopeless but neither has the strength to walk away from.I don't want to give away any more about the plot as a lot of the enjoyment of a Wes Anderson film is simply watching things unfold in delightful, unexpected and sometimes simply weird ways, and Moonrise Kingdom is no exception.  I will say that the ending was perfectly written and executed, bringing a number of plot threads and themes together in ways that you'll truly have to experience to appreciate.  If nothing else, Moonrise Kingdom truly merits an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.  The dialogue, the originality and the way in which the themes are developed in in which all of the intricate elements are tied together as the story plays out is truly a work of art. Not to mention all of the myriad little cultural cues and references worked into the visuals and the dialogue, from the more obvious ones like Noah's Ark and Peter Pan to the more obscure like Chief Joseph and the Flight of the Nez Perce.The performances are all top-notch, to the point that it's difficult to single out any one as being superior to the rest. Newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward turn in particularly deft performances as Sam and Suzy, more than able to carry the film's center as events swirl around them. Bruce Willis does a particularly nuanced job as the island's police chief, trying to do the right thing by the two runaways even when he can't manage to do it for himself, his eyes and his pauses delivering volumes about the things he doesn't say.  Bill Murray's Walt is a bleakly comic mix of bluster and despair, while Frances McDormand's Laura runs the family show, herding her kids around with a bull-horn (something apparently Anderson's mother actually did). Edward Norton's Scout Master Randy goes through one of the film's more interesting evolutions as events lead him out of his comfort zone of structure and order into swirling chaos and eventually to surprising self-discovery.  The boys who make up the rest of the Khaki Scouts in Troop 55 make an excellent supporting group-think character, as do the boys who play Suzy's three younger brothers.  In addition to the cast already mentioned, other notable actors who show up are Bob Balaban as the film's on-screen Narrator (who is also apparently the island's local historian and who gives a bizarre visual impression of having been one of Santa's elves in a past life), Jason Schwartzman as one of the scout's Cousin Ben, Harvey Keitel as Khaki Scout Commander Pierce, and Tilda Swinton as ""Social Services"" (it's one of the running jokes in the film).A lot of themes run through Moonrise Kingdom, particularly with regard to the question of whether there is any real difference between adults and children.  The adults in Moonrise Kingdom all experience private feelings of inadequacy in their roles as adults, and in fact act like children in their dealings with each other, but maintain the pretense nonetheless in the presence of the 'real' children.  The children in turn act like little versions of the adults, the only difference being that they're not yet aware of their inadequacies and hence do not feel inhibited by them.  A lot of this is played out in the dialogue and the way the actors deliver it, maintaining an even consistency in the level of vocabulary and in the rhythm of delivery, whether the words are coming from an adult or a kid, further erasing the boundaries we generally use to distinguish between the two.  The adults sound like the children and the children sound like the adults, but without the doubts.There are a number of memorable scenes in the movie, many humorous but some surprising in how they speak again to the issues of whether there really is any difference between adulthood and childhood.  And in the inadequacies adults feel in their roles as adults.  One of my favorites is a moment where Walt and Laura are lying awake in their summer house, unable to sleep with the two kids missing and the sound of the approaching storm beginning to rise outside. As they stare at the ceiling, Walt, in a moment of despondent candor, says ""I hope the roof flies off and sucks me into space.""  When Laura reminds him ""We're all they've got,"" Walt replies simply but tellingly ""It's not enough.""  Another great scene occurs when the other Scouts in the troop go searching for Sam, but only after arming themselves with every weapon they can find or make. It's darkly comic and appalling at the same time when you realize that the boys are just mimicking what they think adults are like.On a side note, the books in the film that Suzy takes with her - and from which she reads to Sam and to the other Scouts - are completely fictitious.  Or at least they were.  Anderson commissioned six artists to create jacket covers for the books, and then he wrote the passages for each of the books that Suzy ends up reading aloud. Anderson had considered creating animated segments to accompany the reading scenes, but in the end he chose instead to just have Suzy reading with the boys listening enraptured. After the film was completed and released though, Anderson decided to animate all six books and use assemble them in a video in which Bob Balaban, acting against as narrator, introduces the segment for each of the books.  This video may appear in the DVD/Blu-ray release as bonus material.All in all, I would highly recommend Moonrise Kingdom, both to fans of Wes Anderson as his best film to date, and to anyone else who enjoys quirky but highly engaging story-telling with masterful attention to every detail and fine performances by an extremely talented cast of actors.",5,Wes Anderson's masterpiece - and I'm not (or

Example- Frances McDormand just needed more to work with. Edward Norton was outstanding as the tense and challenged scout leader. I have never been overly impressed by Norton, but he nailed it with this movie role.The storyline of the movie is amusing, fast moving, sweet, nostalgic, and filled with great sense of the period. It is not hollywood style with the typical unrealistic stretch of sensibility. It tells a story and it tells it well.I would enjoy watching this movie again!

It comes across as an utterly low-key indie flick, but with boggling star power: Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, and Tilda Swinton. But even at that, the kids take the movie over, as they should.The couple, age twelvish, come across with authenticity that borders on painful. Each is disaffected, each wants more and sees it within reach, and each sees it within the other, somehow. They take off on their doomed trek, together, trusting in each other and not a lot else. And, along the way, they share some of the more awkward moments of young love - with utterly serious solemnity, as kids do when trying to act grown up.The thing is, they do it - at least sort of. They make enemies, and defeat them. They need allies, and make them. And, in the end, they win, sort of. The adult actors rise to the children's level, especially Swinton in the role of Social Services (apparently wearing what she found in a Pan Am stewardess's closet). But, don't worry. Nothing I can say can really be a spoiler. When something, even something very familiar, is done very well, it becomes a new thing. This is done very, very well. Even with its near-total lack of special effects, it's very special indeed.-- wiredweird",5,A true gem,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1328,"['Once', 'while', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'magical', 'way', 'describe', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom', 'one', 'such', 'across', 'utterly', 'low-key', 'indie', 'flick', 'boggling', 'star', 'power', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'even', 'kids', 'take', 'movie', 'over', 'should.The', 'couple', 'age', 'twelvish', 'come', 'authenticity', 'borders', 'painful', 'disaffected', 'more', 'reach', 'sees', 'other', 'somehow', 'take', 'off', 'doomed', 'trek', 'together', 'trusting', 'other', 'not', 'lot', 'else', 'way', 'share', 'more', 'awkward', 'moments', 'young', 'love', 'utterly', 'serious', 'solemnity', 'kids', 'do', 'when', 'trying', 'act', 'grown', 'up.The', 'thing', 'do', 'least', 'sort', 'make', 'enemies', 'defeat', 'need', 'allies', 'make', 'end', 'win', 'sort', 'adult', 'actors', 'rise', 'children', 'level', 'especially', 'Swinton', 'role', 'Social', 'Services', 'apparently', 'wearing', 'what', 'found', 'Pan', 'Am', 'stewardess', 'closet', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Nothing', 'can', 'say', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'spoiler', 'When', 'something', 'even', 'something', 'very', 'familiar', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'new', 'thing', 'done', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'Even', 'near-total', 'lack', 'special', 'effects', 'very', 'special', 'indeed.', 'wiredweird']",N/A
