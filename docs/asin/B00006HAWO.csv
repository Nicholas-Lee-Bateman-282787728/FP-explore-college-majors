Getting the progeny of the two heroes together as the new generation spies was as obvious as it was silly, and the writers couldn't resist the urge to make the show a parody of itself. There is no suspense, and it's impossible to take the characters at all seriously. On the plus side, it does feature an early appearance of the beautiful Salli Richardson, who has gone on to co-star in the Sci-Fi Channel's ""Eureka!"", as Scotty's daughter.",3,"Old TV show reunion, unsuccessful as usual",1033516800,"10 2, 2002",2002,662,"['exception', 'rather', 'long', 'series', 'Alien', 'Nation', 'reunion', 'movies', 'few', 'TV-movies', 'showing', 'old', 'stars', 'old', 'roles', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'success', 'funnied-up', 'resurrection', 'Kelly', 'Scotty', 'rule', 'Getting', 'progeny', 'two', 'heroes', 'together', 'new', 'generation', 'spies', 'was', 'as', 'obvious', 'was', 'silly', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'urge', 'make', 'show', 'parody', 'suspense', 'impossible', 'take', 'characters', 'seriously', 'plus', 'side', 'feature', 'early', 'appearance', 'beautiful', 'Salli', 'Richardson', 'who', 'gone', 'co-star', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Eureka', 'Scotty', 'daughter']",I Spy Returns

However, it picked up pace and the old camaraderie of Cosby and Culpcame through and the pace picked up. I bought it used for small change. I suggest getting it used and save a little money. I watched this show in reruns as a boy in the 1960's. I always loved Bill Cosby in this Mr. Soctt roll, and Culp was not bad either. Both men made the show the great 60's drama and sometimes comedy that it was. I suggest watching the original 83 episodes of the show on cable. It is currently on every afternoon...",5,I watched it right after Madlock and Murder she Wrote ! ;-),1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,576,"['enjoyed', 'reunion', 'so', 'speak', 'reunion', 'show', 'started', 'off', 'slow', 'However', 'picked', 'up', 'pace', 'old', 'camaraderie', 'Cosby', 'Culpcame', 'pace', 'picked', 'up', 'bought', 'used', 'small', 'change', 'suggest', 'getting', 'used', 'save', 'little', 'money', 'watched', 'show', 'reruns', 'boy', '1960', 'always', 'loved', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Mr.', 'Soctt', 'roll', 'Culp', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'men', 'made', 'show', 'great', '60', 'drama', 'sometimes', 'comedy', 'was', 'suggest', 'watching', 'original', '83', 'episodes', 'show', 'cable', 'currently', 'afternoon']",I Spy Returns
715865,A3IVIS1OPYUU0X,B00006HAWO,Henry Perkins,"[9, 9]","It was great to see Kelly and Scotty back together again after all these years.  However, there was a vital difference in the way things were handled for this reunion movie compared to the original series: the movie was played for laughs while the original was played straight.  Yes, they had lots of enjoyable banter as partners in the TV series, with plenty of joking around.  But (unlike ""Get Smart"", their competition at the time), ""I Spy"" took the espionage missions seriously.  Here the basic scenario is comic, with the retired agents bumbling about in an unofficial attempt to watch over their kids as they follow in their dads' footsteps.The movie ends with Scott being asked (about the job): ""Do you miss it?""His response: ""No -- just him.""As a bit of nostalgia this flick is wonderful.  As a movie, it's nothing special, which was disappointing; the original series really *was* something special.",3,"Nice to see them together again, but ...",1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,908,"['was', 'great', 'see', 'Kelly', 'Scotty', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'years', 'However', 'was', 'vital', 'difference', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'handled', 'reunion', 'movie', 'compared', 'original', 'series', 'movie', 'was', 'played', 'laughs', 'original', 'was', 'played', 'straight', 'Yes', 'had', 'lots', 'enjoyable', 'banter', 'partners', 'TV', 'series', 'plenty', 'joking', 'around', 'Get', 'Smart', 'competition', 'time', 'Spy', 'took', 'espionage', 'missions', 'seriously', 'Here', 'basic', 'scenario', 'comic', 'retired', 'agents', 'bumbling', 'about', 'unofficial', 'attempt', 'watch', 'over', 'kids', 'follow', 'dads', 'footsteps.The', 'movie', 'Scott', 'being', 'asked', 'job', 'Do', 'miss', 'response', 'just', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'flick', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'nothing', 'special', 'was', 'disappointing', 'original', 'series', 'really', '*was*', 'something', 'special']",I Spy Returns

Yes, they go with the silly 'the kids are taking over Dad's job, and Dad sneaks around to make sure they don't screw up' plot.  However, this really shines in the same place the original series did -- the interaction and dialogue between Cosby and Culp.  After all this time, they were still being those characters!  Yes, while the scene where they are tied up naked might have been a little more fun if they had been a bit younger *cough*, it led to a wonderful scene.  The young stars are pleasant enough, and do their best with what they're given.",4,"A nice reunion, but not perfect",1104278400,"12 29, 2004",2004,671,"['Reunion', 'movies', 'tend', 'have', 'faults', 'one', 'exception', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'better', 'average', 'Yes', 'go', 'silly', 'kids', 'are', 'taking', 'over', 'Dad', 'job', 'Dad', 'sneaks', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'screw', 'up', 'plot', 'However', 'really', 'same', 'place', 'original', 'series', 'did', 'interaction', 'dialogue', 'Cosby', 'Culp', 'time', 'were', 'still', 'being', 'characters', 'Yes', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'naked', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'fun', 'had', 'been', 'bit', 'younger', '*cough*', 'led', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'young', 'stars', 'are', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'do', 'best', 'what', ""'re"", 'given']",I Spy Returns

Robinson (Robert Culp) has a corner office at the CIA and college teacher Kelly Scott (Bill Cosby) barges in to confront his old pard about recruiting Scott's daughter.  Together, they follow the daughter and, as it turns out, Robinson's son, on their first mission to Paris.  They work well together, as always, remain convincinlgy light and amusing while tightening up for the confrontations with the bad guys when needed, and it is a satisfying reunion episode.
