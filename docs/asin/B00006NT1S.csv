721206,A2RQS7X7FI3C6E,B00006NT1S,AAI,"[3, 4]","Six Feet Under is one of those shows that will suck you in and become highly addictive by the end of the first episode.  The show revolves around the Fishers who operate a family owned funeral home.  All of the characters stand out and develop greatly on this show.  Sometimes you will watch this show and you will laugh up a storm other times you will watch it and the emotion makes you want to cry.Six Feet Under is written by Alan Ball and he directed American Beauty. American Beauty is one of my favorite movies and there are a few similarities in between both.  When I say similarities I mean that both American Beauty have a great sense of dark humor and great drama.  I found both of Alan Ball's works to be one that make you sit back and reflect on life.  After watching American Beauty you look around for the beauty of things on earth and in life.  The same applies with Six Feet Under but questions are brought up like ""Why do we have to die"".  I liked American Beauty and I felt right at home with Six Feet Under.The characters in this show are relatable and even though they have a different way of making a living I still found them relatable. The main characters I would say are Nate, David, Ruth, Claire, & Nate Sr.  Of course they are the Fisher family who own the funeral home.  Another few huge character on this show are Brenda and her brother Billy.  Of course there are other big characters but I can't name everyone.In the pilot episode the Nate Sr. dies in a horrible bus accident and he has to hand over the funeral home to his two sons Nate and David Fisher.  Even though he his dead Nate Sr. watches over his family and communicates with his family.  Alot of the scenes he appears in are hilarious.  Oh ya did I mention he is dead!  His sons both have good developing characters who are very different in their own ways.  David Fisher is a cool character who is very businesslike and is also gay.  He has a boyfriend named Keith is a cop. You will find there relationship evolve as the season goes on.  The other brother Nate, has never worked a day in the funeral business because he left for Seattle to pursue his own life.  Nate is a pretty cool character but his world is in a blender with the passing of his father and his relationship with his newly met girlfriend Brenda.  His girlfrend Brenda in my opinion is the star of the show.  She is full of crazy/cool energy and always has an appetite for sex.  You never know what to expect with her character.  The mother, Ruth Fisher is kinda of a control freak who seems very depressed, worn out, and saddened over the loss over her husband.  She snaps very quickly and she is too a memorable character.  Finally the Claire Fisher is another cool character.  She is the youngest of the bunch and she is a teenager in high school.  She is somewhat of a loner but she has alot of character and she is far from ordinary.  She drives a freakin hearse to school!!!  Enough about the characters I can't spill everything out or I will spoil the season for you.I know what your thinking.  Your like well ok thats great Adam but you know what, if I come home with this the wife will have my head on a platter.  I will admit it is pricey but I think Six Feet Under is a great enough show to where the quality over shadows the price.  It is on HBO so there is alot swearing, sex and other stuff you would never see on regular television.  I think HBO produces great television shows.  Just watch The Sopranos, Sex & The City, Oz or many of there other series.  You know it is quality and they are great television.  Well guess what Six Feet Under plays on that same field.  I find it to be my 3rd favorite television show behind 24 and the Sopranos.Well let me conclude by saying you will be satisfied with Season One of Six feet Under.  I haven't seen the other seasons of this show but I will definetly be buying Season 2 when it is released in June.  If you like quality acting, drama, and dark humor give this show a shot.",5,Another diamond series on HBO,1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,3996,"['Six', 'Feet', 'one', 'shows', 'will', 'suck', 'become', 'highly', 'addictive', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'show', 'Fishers', 'who', 'operate', 'family', 'owned', 'funeral', 'home', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'develop', 'greatly', 'show', 'Sometimes', 'will', 'watch', 'show', 'will', 'laugh', 'up', 'storm', 'other', 'times', 'will', 'watch', 'emotion', 'want', 'cry.Six', 'Feet', 'written', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'directed', 'American', 'Beauty', 'American', 'Beauty', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'are', 'few', 'similarities', 'When', 'say', 'similarities', 'mean', 'American', 'Beauty', 'have', 'great', 'sense', 'dark', 'humor', 'great', 'drama', 'found', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'works', 'be', 'one', 'make', 'sit', 'back', 'reflect', 'life', 'watching', 'American', 'Beauty', 'look', 'beauty', 'things', 'earth', 'life', 'same', 'applies', 'Six', 'Feet', 'questions', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'die', 'liked', 'American', 'Beauty', 'felt', 'right', 'home', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Under.The', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'relatable', 'even', 'have', 'different', 'way', 'making', 'living', 'still', 'found', 'relatable', 'main', 'characters', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'Nate', 'David', 'Ruth', 'Claire', 'Nate', 'Sr.', 'course', 'are', 'Fisher', 'family', 'who', 'own', 'funeral', 'home', 'few', 'huge', 'character', 'show', 'are', 'Brenda', 'brother', 'Billy', 'course', 'are', 'other', 'big', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'name', 'everyone.In', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Nate', 'Sr.', 'horrible', 'bus', 'accident', 'hand', 'funeral', 'home', 'two', 'sons', 'Nate', 'David', 'Fisher', 'Even', 'dead', 'Nate', 'Sr.', 'family', 'communicates', 'family', 'Alot', 'scenes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Oh', 'ya', 'did', 'mention', 'dead', 'sons', 'have', 'good', 'developing', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'own', 'ways', 'David', 'Fisher', 'cool', 'character', 'who', 'very', 'businesslike', 'also', 'gay', 'boyfriend', 'named', 'Keith', 'cop', 'will', 'find', 'relationship', 'evolve', 'season', 'other', 'brother', 'Nate', 'never', 'worked', 'day', 'funeral', 'business', 'left', 'Seattle', 'pursue', 'own', 'life', 'Nate', 'pretty', 'cool', 'character', 'world', 'blender', 'passing', 'father', 'relationship', 'newly', 'met', 'girlfriend', 'Brenda', 'girlfrend', 'Brenda', 'opinion', 'star', 'show', 'full', 'crazy/cool', 'energy', 'always', 'appetite', 'sex', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'character', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'Fisher', 'kinda', 'control', 'freak', 'who', 'very', 'depressed', 'worn', 'out', 'saddened', 'loss', 'husband', 'very', 'quickly', 'too', 'memorable', 'character', 'Finally', 'Claire', 'Fisher', 'cool', 'character', 'youngest', 'bunch', 'teenager', 'high', 'school', 'somewhat', 'loner', 'alot', 'character', 'far', 'ordinary', 'freakin', 'hearse', 'school', 'Enough', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spill', 'everything', 'will', 'spoil', 'season', 'you.I', 'know', 'what', 'thinking', 'well', 'ok', 'thats', 'great', 'Adam', 'know', 'what', 'come', 'home', 'wife', 'will', 'have', 'head', 'platter', 'will', 'admit', 'pricey', 'think', 'Six', 'Feet', 'great', 'enough', 'show', 'where', 'quality', 'price', 'HBO', 'alot', 'swearing', 'sex', 'other', 'stuff', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'regular', 'television', 'think', 'HBO', 'great', 'television', 'shows', 'Just', 'watch', 'Sopranos', 'Sex', 'City', 'Oz', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'know', 'quality', 'are', 'great', 'television', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'Six', 'Feet', 'plays', 'same', 'field', 'find', 'be', '3rd', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', '24', 'Sopranos.Well', 'let', 'conclude', 'saying', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'Season', 'One', 'Six', 'feet', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'seasons', 'show', 'will', 'definetly', 'be', 'buying', 'Season', '2', 'when', 'released', 'June', 'like', 'quality', 'acting', 'drama', 'dark', 'humor', 'give', 'show', 'shot']",N/A

Eby,"[2, 3]","It [is bad] not having HBO: I have to wait until TV's most talked-about shows, like ""The Sopranos"", ""Sex and the City"" and ""Oz"", come out on DVD to catch up on all the quality entertainment I'm missing.  The good thing is, once I get started, I don't have to wait a week to catch the next episode.  As I've begun the first season of ""Six Feet Under"", this has proved to be a very good thing indeed.This show is one of the most grimly funny I've seen in a long time.  The inanity of the funeral home business is given a perfect showcase in this ensemble drama, featuring some of the freshest acting and writing since, well, ""The Sopranos"".  If subplots and supporting characters occasionally seem to be weird strictly for weirdness' sake (the missing foot, Brenda's completely psychotic family), the real family dynamics - frustration, anger, confusion, love despite it all - are a joy to watch.  Though Peter Krause and Michael C. Hall, as brothers Nate and David Fisher, are given top billing and are essentially the main characters, the women steal the show every chance they get.  Frances Conroy is a neurotic joy as befuddled matriarch Ruth, Rachel Griffiths keeps the character of Nate's girlfriend Brenda from falling into the stereotype of complicated woman/child (which, in the hands of a lesser actress, would be especially noticeable in this airtight ensemble), and Lauren Ambrose is, to me, the true star as Claire, the youngest and most openly rebellious of the Fisher clan.  Ambrose does wonders as a conflicted teenager looking for meaning in the senselessness of death and grief she lives with.  This show is addictive; I've watched, on average, four a day, and am now impatient for Season Two to be released.

721209,A2V40DTEZLBNKD,B00006NT1S,Allison Kalman,"[1, 1]","HBO-less, I've been enthralled with the ideas behind Six Feet Under since it first began. I'd catch an episode at a hotel one night, another at a friends house, and each clearly hinted at the genius of the show and only made me want more.Finally, season one was released on dvd and over the course of three days, I watched every episode, enthralled.The show starts out interesting because of it's quirks but not quite there. Clearly, something is missing in the first few episodes. It keeps your interest because of it's uniqueness. No other show has ever explored death in quite the same way as Six Feet Under, and rarely have you seen the behind the scene workings of a funeral home. But this alone wouldn't sustain the show for long.Then, and few episodes in, something marvelous happens. The characters truely begin to reveal themselves to you, in all their glory. Each character is deeply troubled in many ways, and what else would you expect in a show that revolves around a death each week, but at the same time, you can relate to each and every one of them.The more out there characters, Brenda and her brother, are given real weight by the terrific actors portraying them.

The sound and picture quality are gorgeous; looking and sounding delish even without a fancy TV. However, at the this price point I expect a lot more featurettes, commentaries and behind the scenes footage. I don't understand why HBO charges so much, but I was lucky, I caught a special at a local retailer and got all 5 seasons for 100.00 bucks. Also if you're only seeing the show on Bravo you are missing out. I have seen two Bravo eps and I cringed at the bad dubbing and editing. It's definitely worth owning if you enjoy the show but try to catch it on the cheap; it's a series that tends to go on sale a lot and HBO did drop the price on the first three seasons to something around fifty dollars.

The problem:  I didn't get HBO back when ""Six Feet Under"" started and by the time I knew it was a good program I was years behind, and I watch a lot of TV, so never got around to it.  But now, as I get older, I am getting pickier.  I really only want to watch very good television.  Consequently for the last couple of months I've had nothing much to watch except ""Breaking Bad"" and now ""The Closer.""  So last night I suggested to my husband that we find this program and rent it online -- we couldn't stream it from Netflix and rented it from Amazon instead.  I was disappointed that I couldn't rent the whole season for a discounted rate, so back to Netflix to have the individual DVDs mailed to me.  But the series premiere did not disappoint.  It is now ten years old, and I could see where many of my favorite actors got a start and some of my favorite TV programs may have picked up a technique or two.

721222,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00006NT1S,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","The wonderful thing about cable TV is that it can get away with a lot more than primetime television. Most people know this from watching such things as THE SOPRANOS. Sex, drugs, gore. Nothing is ""too much"" for them.And SIX FEET UNDER follows this example but by focusing on the Fisher family, a truly messed up group of undertakers who own/operate a funeral home in southern California.Each episode opens with the death of someone, and this sets up the premise for that week's show.The very first episode starts with the death of the Fisher patriarch, Nathanial Fisher (Richard Jenkins, RUMOR HAS IT). He's driving home a new hearse when it is struck by a bus, killing him instantly. He leaves behind his wife Ruth (Frances Conroy, THE AVIATOR), his eldest son David (Michael C. Hall, PAYCHECK), his younger son Nate (Peter Krause, THE TRUMAN SHOW), and high school daughter Claire (Lauren Ambrose, PARTY OF FIVE TV series). This was a very effective way to get ""into"" the Fisher family from a viewer's standpoint. Nothing pulls a family together like the death of one of its closest members. Although they were coming together anyway for Christmas, the Fisher's are now forced to deal with each other on a very tight level. David has been working at the funeral home all his life and feels that his life may have been wasted. He also has to deal with his homosexuality and his inability to ""come out of the closet"" to his family and friends. His love for officer Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick, REUNION TV series) is felt throughout the series, and is on and off thanks to David's psychological hurdles. Matriarch Ruth comes out to the family on her own as she tells them about an affair she'd been having for some time with a hairdresser (male); this comes out during the viewing of her husband as he awaits internment.  Younger son Nate gets news of his father's death while having sex with a stranger (Rachel Griffiths, VERY ANNIE MARY) in an airport maintenance closet. We soon learn that her name is Brenda and with her comes an entirely new set of baggage for Nate in the form of love and a relationship he never thought possible. And finally we get young daughter Claire, a highschooler who learns of her father's death immediately after trying crystal meth for the first time.What made the show initially entertaining and oh-so-watchable, is the effects of death on all the characters. They deal with everyone else's grief better than their own, as they are distant from it; it's a business. But as the series rolls on, Nate learns that they are here to do more than business. The dead visit the family in ethereal form, teaching them very tough lessons (from how to stand up for yourself, to dealing with a SIDS death). Even the family's father Nathaniel, who started out dead in the beginning episode, turns up at crossroads and tries to help them deal with difficulties.The series starts out with a bang and keeps going for the first several episodes. Most viewers will be glued to their TV's, wondering what's going to happen next; a tribute to writer/director Alan Ball. But toward the latter half of the first season the series goes a bit astray. The initial enjoyment of watching how death affects the family is swapped for a more soap opera style plot that delves into how the characters effect other characters. Although this isn't horrible, it isn't as gripping as the show's initial premise. Gone are the dead's visitations (mostly), as are the quirky commercials for hearse sales and corpse foundation putty.But even with these issues there's still a certain pull that the series has thanks to some strong writing and the deadly subject matter. The big question, though, is is it worth going on to season two?",4,Nothing Brings A Family Together Like Death,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,3734,"['wonderful', 'thing', 'cable', 'TV', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'lot', 'more', 'primetime', 'television', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'watching', 'such', 'things', 'SOPRANOS', 'Sex', 'drugs', 'gore', 'Nothing', 'too', 'much', 'them.And', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'example', 'focusing', 'Fisher', 'family', 'truly', 'messed', 'up', 'group', 'undertakers', 'who', 'own/operate', 'funeral', 'home', 'southern', 'California.Each', 'episode', 'death', 'someone', 'up', 'premise', 'week', 'show.The', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'death', 'Fisher', 'patriarch', 'Nathanial', 'Fisher', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'RUMOR', 'HAS', 'IT', 'driving', 'home', 'new', 'hearse', 'when', 'struck', 'bus', 'killing', 'instantly', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'THE', 'AVIATOR', 'eldest', 'son', 'David', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'PAYCHECK', 'younger', 'son', 'Nate', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'THE', 'TRUMAN', 'SHOW', 'high', 'school', 'daughter', 'Claire', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'PARTY', 'OF', 'FIVE', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'way', 'get', 'Fisher', 'family', 'viewer', 'standpoint', 'Nothing', 'family', 'together', 'death', 'one', 'closest', 'members', 'were', 'coming', 'together', 'anyway', 'Christmas', 'Fisher', 'are', 'now', 'forced', 'deal', 'other', 'very', 'tight', 'level', 'David', 'been', 'working', 'funeral', 'home', 'life', 'feels', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'wasted', 'also', 'deal', 'homosexuality', 'inability', 'come', 'closet', 'family', 'friends', 'love', 'officer', 'Keith', 'Charles', 'Mathew', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'REUNION', 'TV', 'series', 'felt', 'series', 'thanks', 'David', 'psychological', 'hurdles', 'Matriarch', 'Ruth', 'out', 'family', 'own', 'affair', ""'d"", 'been', 'having', 'time', 'hairdresser', 'male', 'out', 'viewing', 'husband', 'internment', 'Younger', 'son', 'Nate', 'news', 'father', 'death', 'having', 'sex', 'stranger', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'VERY', 'ANNIE', 'MARY', 'airport', 'maintenance', 'closet', 'soon', 'learn', 'name', 'Brenda', 'entirely', 'new', 'set', 'baggage', 'Nate', 'form', 'love', 'relationship', 'never', 'thought', 'possible', 'finally', 'get', 'young', 'daughter', 'Claire', 'highschooler', 'who', 'father', 'death', 'immediately', 'trying', 'crystal', 'meth', 'first', 'made', 'show', 'initially', 'entertaining', 'oh-so-watchable', 'effects', 'death', 'characters', 'deal', 'everyone', 'else', 'grief', 'better', 'own', 'are', 'distant', 'business', 'series', 'rolls', 'Nate', 'are', 'here', 'do', 'more', 'business', 'dead', 'visit', 'family', 'ethereal', 'form', 'teaching', 'very', 'tough', 'lessons', 'how', 'stand', 'up', 'dealing', 'SIDS', 'death', 'Even', 'family', 'father', 'Nathaniel', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'dead', 'beginning', 'episode', 'up', 'crossroads', 'tries', 'help', 'deal', 'difficulties.The', 'series', 'out', 'bang', 'going', 'first', 'several', 'episodes', 'Most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'glued', 'TV', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'tribute', 'writer/director', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'latter', 'half', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'bit', 'astray', 'initial', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'how', 'death', 'family', 'swapped', 'more', 'soap', 'opera', 'style', 'plot', 'how', 'characters', 'effect', 'other', 'characters', ""n't"", 'horrible', ""n't"", 'as', 'gripping', 'show', 'initial', 'premise', 'Gone', 'are', 'dead', 'visitations', 'mostly', 'are', 'quirky', 'commercials', 'hearse', 'sales', 'corpse', 'foundation', 'putty.But', 'even', 'issues', 'still', 'certain', 'pull', 'series', 'thanks', 'strong', 'writing', 'deadly', 'subject', 'matter', 'big', 'question', 'worth', 'going', 'season', 'two']",N/A

So, instead of waiting for the next episode on Monday, I ran to Hollywood Video and rented the entire first season and over the course of a month, finished the entire season.The series begins with the death of the man that runs Fisher and Sons funeral home, Nathaniel Fisher. As they say, ""nothing brings a family better together than death"", Nathaniel Jr. flies from Seattle (Peter Krause), Ruth, with her recently destroyed potroast (Frances Conroy), David, with his numerous distractions (Michael Hall), and Claire, who's high on crystal meth (Lauren Ambrose) are binded together by the recent loss of a husband and father. The pilot itself is one of the best things I've seen on television, or in a theatre for that matter. The only thing about the season that bothered me were the funeral supplies commercials, and I'm glad they did away with those in the beginning (they were humorous, just a little distracting).Throughout the course of the season, there is a period where it does get a little dull, but of course the show redeems itself. A few episodes that really stand out for me are:Pilot:This episode was flawless. Everything about it was enjoyable, and like I said, one of the best things I've seen on television, or in a theatre for that matter. I especially liked the ending, that was when I knew I had to finish the rest of the season.The Trip (Episode 11):Very humourous and enjoyable. I liked the pregression of Billy and Brenda's relationship.A Private Life (Episode 12):Best episode of the season (Pilot was a close second). Everything was brilliant, especially Billy's storyline. Poor guy.Those episodes that didn't stand out:Familia (Episode 4)I didn't care for the 'gangster' storyline, it got a little dull.Overall, I'd highly reccomend this season to anyone. There are some diversity issues, so not everyone will be able to enjoy this because some people are offended by some of the shows content.MPAA Rating: TV-MA (No Discriptions)My Rating: 16+ for Sexual content, including brief nudity, coarse language, some scenes of violence, including grotesque imagery, and some drug content/references.Notes: I think this series is appropriate for mature teenagers. Charactors drink and smoke, and there is occasional usage of majiuana, and one or two uses of crystal meth and cocaine. There is some suggestive dialouge, sex scenes (some graphic), and nudity (male and female). Charactors swear, however I don't really think of it as a big issue since most teenagers hear these words every day. There is some violence, but the thing that might frighten some sensitive viewers are some scenes involving mutilated bodies.",5,Enchanting and thought provoking,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,2805,"['had', 'finished', 'watching', 'pilot', 'Bravo', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'HBO', 'was', 'instantly', 'enticed', 'shows', 'gripping', 'storylines', 'likeable', 'charactors', 'amazing', 'acting', 'So', 'instead', 'waiting', 'next', 'episode', 'Monday', 'ran', 'Hollywood', 'Video', 'rented', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'course', 'month', 'finished', 'entire', 'season.The', 'series', 'death', 'man', 'Fisher', 'Sons', 'funeral', 'home', 'Nathaniel', 'Fisher', 'say', 'nothing', 'family', 'better', 'together', 'death', 'Nathaniel', 'Jr.', 'flies', 'Seattle', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Ruth', 'recently', 'destroyed', 'potroast', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'David', 'numerous', 'distractions', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'Claire', 'who', 'high', 'crystal', 'meth', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'are', 'binded', 'together', 'recent', 'loss', 'husband', 'father', 'pilot', 'one', 'best', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'television', 'theatre', 'matter', 'only', 'thing', 'season', 'bothered', 'were', 'funeral', 'supplies', 'commercials', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'away', 'beginning', 'were', 'humorous', 'just', 'little', 'distracting', 'course', 'season', 'period', 'where', 'get', 'little', 'dull', 'course', 'show', 'few', 'episodes', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'flawless', 'Everything', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'said', 'one', 'best', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'television', 'theatre', 'matter', 'especially', 'liked', 'ending', 'was', 'when', 'knew', 'had', 'finish', 'rest', 'season.The', 'Trip', 'Episode', '11', 'Very', 'humourous', 'enjoyable', 'liked', 'pregression', 'Billy', 'Brenda', 'relationship.A', 'Private', 'Life', 'Episode', '12', 'Best', 'episode', 'season', 'Pilot', 'was', 'close', 'second', 'Everything', 'was', 'brilliant', 'especially', 'Billy', 'storyline', 'Poor', 'guy.Those', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'Familia', 'Episode', '4', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', ""'gangster"", 'storyline', 'got', 'little', 'dull.Overall', ""'d"", 'highly', 'reccomend', 'season', 'anyone', 'are', 'diversity', 'issues', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'people', 'are', 'offended', 'shows', 'content.MPAA', 'Rating', 'TV-MA', 'No', 'Discriptions', 'Rating', '16+', 'Sexual', 'content', 'including', 'brief', 'nudity', 'coarse', 'language', 'scenes', 'violence', 'including', 'grotesque', 'imagery', 'drug', 'content/references.Notes', 'think', 'series', 'appropriate', 'mature', 'teenagers', 'Charactors', 'drink', 'smoke', 'occasional', 'usage', 'majiuana', 'one', 'two', 'uses', 'crystal', 'meth', 'cocaine', 'suggestive', 'dialouge', 'sex', 'scenes', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', 'Charactors', 'swear', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'big', 'issue', 'most', 'teenagers', 'hear', 'words', 'day', 'violence', 'thing', 'might', 'frighten', 'sensitive', 'viewers', 'are', 'scenes', 'involving', 'mutilated', 'bodies']",N/A

I had heard about SFU, and being curious about the days and nights of a family that owns a funeral home, I bought it. HBO charges an arm and a leg for 13 episodes, so I got mine used, which is fine by me. I immediately fell in love with the fishers, and the people who by grim circumstances happen to wander in and out of their lives. I like the 1950's throwback decoration of the house, and the struggles that the brothers have at first when they have to share the responsibility of the business after the death of their father. The ""ghosts"" that talk to the characters, are maybe their own consciences or a higher power either way, it's an amazing way to tell their stories and show their fears. I wasn't a huge fan of Rachel Griffiths, I had seen her in Muriel's Wedding and wanted to take piano wire to her neck, but this character deserved someone who was both hardened and soft of heart and soul and she pulls it off wonderfully. This season introduces us all to the family dynamic, the controlling mother who has a problem censoring her thoughts, the gay brother with the gorgeous boyfriend whom he alienates by not being open, the prodigal son who is forced to face his demons and finds true love maybe, the little sister who isn't so innocent (she sucks toes) and is desperate for someone to ""need"" her, and the talented embalmer who isn't blood family, yet feels as though he owes them his loyalty. You get to see dead people, but not so much in a way that makes you turn your head, you look out of curiosity and fascination, and in the case of the dead porn star laugh out loud. The episode with the baby was the only one that made me shrink into the couch. I like the story line of the struggling family owned business trying to be forced to sell to the giant corporation Kronos, its humorous yet appropriate for our times.

Why would you want to watch a show with this subject matter? Why, indeed.At the beginning of every show, there is usually someone who dies and it can go from the normal, to strange. One woman smacks her non-stop talking husband over the head with a pan then goes on to eat her breakfast. She claimed that he was ""boring."" Usually, that client is brought to the funeral home, and we are introduced to the characters.In the first episode, the owner and father of this family, dies. His sons (ie, Fisher and sons) are left to take over the business. David, who is the responsible one of the family tries to manage the home while hiding his boyfriend on the side. Nate comes back from Seattle to help out his brother and meets Brenda, on the same day his dad dies. They quickly become a couple without much thought. Claire, still in highschool, seems to have missed a lot since she's a lot younger. She is a creative sort who drives a green hearse and is mostly a loner at school. My favorite character of all would be the mom, Ruth. You look at this woman who seems as if she could live in Victorian times. The more you get to know her, the more you know she is anything but Victorian.She is hilarious, constantly trying to get to know her children, catching up on what she missed. Her whole lifetime with them seemed to pass by when she wasn't paying attention.I have nothing to say but good things about this show. All of the characters have some aspect of likability to them (including those that I found annoying beforehand--Lauren Ambrose has redeemed herself in my eyes.)The whole dysfunctional aspect keeps it interesting and the friends of the family, boyfriends, girlfriends, etc, are all amazing actors as well.Well acted and never boring, I'm now obsessed and trying to get through all of the episodes that I missed.Alan Ball is a genius.",5,What took me so long???,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,1953,"['been', 'have', 'found', 'television', 'show', 'love', 'never', 'looked', 'very', 'interesting', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'show', 'subject', 'matter', 'Why', 'beginning', 'show', 'usually', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'normal', 'strange', 'One', 'woman', 'non-stop', 'talking', 'husband', 'head', 'pan', 'then', 'eat', 'breakfast', 'claimed', 'was', 'boring', 'Usually', 'client', 'brought', 'funeral', 'home', 'are', 'introduced', 'characters.In', 'first', 'episode', 'owner', 'father', 'family', 'dies', 'sons', 'ie', 'Fisher', 'sons', 'are', 'left', 'take', 'over', 'business', 'David', 'who', 'responsible', 'one', 'family', 'manage', 'home', 'hiding', 'boyfriend', 'side', 'Nate', 'back', 'Seattle', 'help', 'out', 'brother', 'meets', 'Brenda', 'same', 'day', 'dad', 'dies', 'quickly', 'become', 'couple', 'much', 'thought', 'Claire', 'still', 'highschool', 'have', 'missed', 'lot', 'lot', 'younger', 'creative', 'sort', 'who', 'green', 'hearse', 'mostly', 'loner', 'school', 'favorite', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'mom', 'Ruth', 'look', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'live', 'Victorian', 'times', 'more', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'know', 'anything', 'Victorian.She', 'hilarious', 'constantly', 'trying', 'get', 'know', 'children', 'catching', 'up', 'what', 'missed', 'whole', 'lifetime', 'seemed', 'pass', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention.I', 'have', 'nothing', 'say', 'good', 'things', 'show', 'characters', 'have', 'aspect', 'likability', 'including', 'found', 'annoying', 'beforehand', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'redeemed', 'eyes', 'whole', 'dysfunctional', 'aspect', 'interesting', 'friends', 'family', 'boyfriends', 'girlfriends', 'etc', 'are', 'amazing', 'actors', 'well.Well', 'acted', 'never', 'boring', ""'m"", 'now', 'obsessed', 'trying', 'get', 'episodes', 'missed.Alan', 'Ball', 'genius']",N/A

It is beautifully acted by the entire cast. Instead of stock characters, the people who inhabit this world appear as three dimensional, flawed, tragic, comic, and beautiful human beings. Instead of being a ""show about nothing"", the trend started by Seinfeld that pretty much every show since seems to be imitating, Six Feet Under is the opposite: it's a show about everything.

Somehow, it's achieved the unimaginable -- making morticians actually seem hip. HBO's presentation of the first season on DVD is worthy of the series' craftsmanship, with eternal blacks and light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel whites. Flesh tones are flawless, whether from the living or dead. Images are full screen. Audio comes in a fairly sedate Dolby Digital 5.1 that's able to deliver the clarion call of the theme music. The set's packaging is first-class -- sexy, vaguely creepy and reflective of the series' high standards for art direction. Likewise, the active on-screen menus look great. Creator Alan Ball provides commentary on the pilot and the season's closing episode, both of which he directed. The talks tend to focus on the specific episode instead of the series, but he delivers a lot of inside information and back-story material. Ball fades in and out when distracted by the episode (""I had to stop and watch""), leading to some awkward silences.

I don't get HBO, so I rented the DVD of the first season.  I don't see what all the fuss is about.Six Feet Under is a series about the lives of the family members of a small family owned funeral home - Fischer and Sons.  The neer-do-well prodigal son, the secretly gay younger son, the lonely, lost teenaged daughter, the sad, unhappy wife, and the deceased patriarch, whom it turns out no one really knew much about.The show begins each episode interestingly enough - someone dies in some odd way and ends up at the funeral home.  The person's death in some way becomes associated with the overall story in a convoluted morality tale for the family.The acting is just fine and the scripts are good as well.  I just don't get the point of the show.  CSI is a show about crime scene investigation that gives us the gory details of crimes and the science in solving them.  Crossing Jordan is a night-time soap slipped in under the premise of a crime investigation show.  Six Feet Under is a night-time soap that is set in a funeral parlor - nothing more.Dynasty, Dallas, and Falcon Crest were larger than life night-time soaps that reveled in their extravagance.  Six Feet Under is really quite pedestrian.  It's nothing terriby interesting - it just has an interesting setting.

Six Feet Under offers a morbidly fine set of stories, filled with surprises and carried by an excellent cast.  It is one of those rare shows where the actors inhabit their roles and make you feel part of the action.  The first episode sets the stage marvelously with Richard Jenkins meeting his sudden fate and bequeathing his mortuary business to his sons, who couldn't be any further apart.  Not to worry, Papa pays visits on his family to see how things are going, as Nate and David struggle to keep the business going against a powerful rival while Mama and Claire tries to re-establish themselves.  The quirkiness of the pilot episode isn't quite matched in succeeding episodes.  The undertakers' product ads were so funny and it is a shame that they didn't follow through with more of them.Probably the most surprising element of this series is how frank Alan Ball is about David's homosexuality and his various relationships. Ball also explores a very dynamic relationship between Nate and Brenda and Brenda's brother, Billy.  Claire's teenage angst is also dealt with sensitively, even if one struggles to find what she sees in Gabriel.  And, Ruth makes for a very engaging mother as she tries to figure out what is going on under her roof while pursuing new relationships of her own.  I can't remember when I last so such a complex set of emotions play out on television.One of the things I like about HBO series is their compactness.  At 13 episodes, you can take in the first season over the course of a couple weeks and enjoy the various stories play out.  Each episode wraps nicely around itself like a well turned short story.

721281,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00006NT1S,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[2, 2]","I am HBO deprived. Since I don't watch much TV, getting this popular cable channel was never an issue. Recently I took out the entire first season of ""Six Feet Under"" on DVD, and may reconsider my HBO decision. I am hooked on this exceptional series, one of the best I have ever seen on television. (except I viewed it on DVD).The Fisher family owns and runs a funeral home, the setting for this unique series. Each episode begins with a death, and the subsequent plot revolves around the deceased, preparing the corpse for burial, (which is oddly fascinating), services for the bereaved, and an update on the lives of the extremely interesting Fishers.Some say that the Fisher family is dysfunctional. I, who have become very in tune with them all, believe that though the individual family members are unusual, to say the least, as a family they function well, and continue to do so and to grow with each new episode. There is palpable love between them, and much effort made to communicate with each other, and to understand and accept one another. The Fisher family and friends are a pure delight!Unfortunately, the first episode deals with the sudden death of Fisher family patriarch, Nathaniel, on Christmas Eve. Ruth, dedicated wife, mother and control freak, loses it when she learns of her husband's accidental death, and in her hysteria admits to having a two year affair. Her ""other man"" takes her camping, an activity she adores, and which she has had to forego being married to an undertaker with little time, and little love, for the outdoors.The eldest son, Nate, escaped the family and the family's business at an early age, by leaving home right after school. He is on his way to the family manse in Los Angles, for the holidays, but presently resides in Seattle, where he runs a natural foods co-op. Handsome, still single, in his mid-thirties, Nate is literally closeted at the airport, having wild sex with a dynamic woman he met on the plane, when his cell phone rings and he is informed of Dad's death.Younger brother David has remained at home to work with his father as co-directer of Fisher and Sons Funeral Home. David is a super straight gay man, with a wonderful, but uptight, in-the-closet-relationship with Keith, a member of LAPD's finest. Dave is resentful that Nate was able to get away from everything and everyone Fisher, and that he was stuck with assuming all the responsibility of brother, son, and undertaker.Claire Fisher, teenage daughter with mega growing pains, frequently steals the show. She is an adorable, artistic, sensitive, talented, underachiever who doesn't fit in with most of the kids at school. One is tempted to say ""Thank God"" to this, but remember, Claire is a teenager who desperately wants to be like everybody else. When she learns of her father's death, she is at an after school ""crystal meth"" session with the in-crowd. Ooops!Alan Ball, the Oscar winning writer of ""American Beauty,"" has created a masterpiece with ""Six Feet Under."" Amazing as it may seem - everything works in this family drama, that will have you laughing your head off, as much wiping away tears, at some of the brilliantly sensitive, occasionally disturbing, and sometimes profound scenes.The acting is wonderful, always. Peter Krause as Nate, and Michael C. Hall as David, are appropriately cast as the two brothers who, when not in conflict and competition with each other, are loving, caring men who are trying to grow into brotherhood. Mom Ruth, brilliantly played by Frances Conroy, is a real study in character, as a middle-aged woman who has long been confined in her corseted lifestyle, and longs to break free and tear loose. She is able to transform herself, in the blink of an eye, from an uptight frump to an attractive, sensual woman ready for love and life. And the amazing Lauren Ambrose, as Claire, is luminescent, awkwardly graceful, and so appealing. The series' surprising show-stopper is Rachel Griffith, as Brenda, the lady from the airport closet, who becomes Nate's girlfriend and an essential mamber of the cast.It is hard to miss with this DVD collection of ""Six Feet Under's"" 1st year.

Alan Ball's sensibilities come through in that wonderful movie most clearly.Then, get this one and watch the pilot.  Alan Ball was most heavily involved in writing and producing the pilot, and it shows.  In fact, it shows almost too much.  The pilot sets the bar so high for the rest of the series, that you're almost set up for disappiontment.For example:1.  Will we ever again see those wonderful commercial spots for funeral products, like in the pilot?  My personal fave was the ""Wound Filler"" one, but the hearse commercial is a sure close second.  (Hey Alan, how about...""Let hearse, put YOU in the driver's seat...""  I guess I'm showing my age.)2.  The power of visual symbols is at its greatest in the pilot.  The rest of the shows depict a fascinating progression of growth for a recurring cast, and, of course, we're curious to know how they all end up.  But that's what entertains the risk of this series devolving into the compromises and simplifications of soap opera.3.  As in ""American Beauty,"" Ball's fascination with death is imprinted deeper on the pilot than on any of the other episodes.So, the first season is, unquestionably, the best.Last carp:  why the hell is it so expensive???

Oleszczyk ""gkchest""","[4, 7]","It should be praised as some kind of a miracle: SFU is a TV series that makes current Hollywood productions seem shallow and somehow unnecessary -- it has more courage, humour and zest than any of the recent Oscar-catching so-called 'major pictures' (THE HOURS excluded).Let alone homosexuality, SFU has enough courage to admit that there's something called death, and that it IS part of our experience as human beings: how many Hollywood films remind us of this fact in any serious way? The Fishers face multitude of difficult questions and perhaps the greatest success of the creators is that not a single episode seems phony or preconceived. If you're watching, for example, films by Stanley Kramer, then you definitely KNOW why they were made: to RAISE SOCIAL QUESTIONS. Once raised, they could have as well been forgotten, for no one cares for an effort that is perfunctory. But SFU is a diffrent story: the series actually deals with many so-called 'social questions', but not for the mere act of 'dealing', but for a purpose, which is - pardon my French - meditation on the very meaning of life and death.And the actors -- oh! can they be praised too much? David Fisher at times reminds me of this malicious puppet from DEAD OF NIGHT, and at others seems even more lovable then this blond chubby boy of THE SOUND OF MUSIC (the one who sings 'You are sixteen, going on seventeen').

This is also one of the bravest shows on the air. While many TV shows are content to waste hours doing nothing or blowing things up, this show tackles difficult topics with an unbiased eye: homosexuality, religion, death, and life itself. The DVD packaging is also worthy of mention: although it's bulky, it is a cool concept and looks nice on the shelf when it fits.While we're on the topic of SFU's brilliance, when is the SECOND season to be released?? I saw the book at the bookstore, and although I was intrigued (Rico becomes a partner), I haven't seen the second season yet (no HBO) and I would much rather drop money on the SECOND SEASON DVD, not a coffee-table book.

That would make me feel hooked.""Six Feet Under"" is that show.  It's perfect.  The writing is indeed brilliant, and the characters are interesting, well-rounded, and fun to know. Likable or not (and some are decidedly not), each and every character -- from the 60-something Mom to the funeral home's young ""restorative artist"" -- has a rich inner life and story of his/her own. And there's a delightful twist to SFU: you know how many television shows are designed so that the main characters come in contact with new people/situations each week?  The ""Star Trek"" crew flew to different planets, ""The Love Boat"" had different ports of call, cop shows have a crime/villain of the week, and so on. Well, every SFU begins with a death, and into each episode is woven the story of the deceased, and we typically get to meet the family members -- whether they're gang-bangers, Japanese monks, or stars in the porn industry.About which: SFU features the ""F"" word about a jillion times, and also nudity, and sex, sex, sex.

721304,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00006NT1S,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[21, 30]","Yesterday we finished watching ""Six Feet Under - The Complete First Season"" on DVD and tonight we watched the premier episode of the Third Season.  Wow, there sure must have been a lot that went down during the Second Season.  But having gone through those first thirteen episodes we could not stand the idea of waiting until that Second Season came out on DVD to see a new episode so we took the plunge tonight and will just have to fill in the gaps as we go along.We did this for a fairly simple reason.  ""Six Feet Under"" is the best television ""new"" television show we have seen in a long time.  When everybody got all bent out of shape over ""The Sopranos"" we checked out the first season on DVD and while I thought it was good, I did not think it was the greatest thing on television (I watch ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""; I know all about good television).  But if ""The Sopranos"" failed to live up to its reputation ""Six Feet Under"" exceeded expectations.  Yes, this constitutes evidence that I have a sick sense of humor that leans towards black comedy and a sense of the abusrd, but that is not news to me or anybody who knows me.  The series is about the Fisher & Sons Funeral Home, which is to say that in each episode we essentially open with the death of a person, who will then be entrusted into their care, and whose death will somehow resonate with the Fisher family and their significant others.The initial credit goes to series creator Alan Ball, who shows that the characters and ironic world he created in ""American Beauty"" were only scratching the surface of his vivid imagination.  Ball does commentary on the first and final episode of the DVD, so make a point of watching those a second time while he chats about what is going on.  But what will make the biggest impression on you is going to be the characters and their performances.  Every episode is it always interesting to see what brilliant bit of acting Frances Conroy is going to turn in as Ruth Fisher.  Beyond that we have the innate capacity of Nate Fisher (Peter Krause) to provide compassion, the enormous pathos we feel for the daily trauma of the life of his brother David (Michael C. Hall), the effervescent being of their sister Claire (Lauren Ambrose), the artistic temperament of master restorative artist Federico Diaz (Freddy Rodriguez), the impish of Brenda Chenowith (Rachel Griffiths), the rock that is Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick), and the unhinged lunacy of her brother Billy (Jeremy Sisto).  Oh, and we should not forget kindred spirits such as the recurring one played by Richard Jenkins.""Six Feet Under"" causes all sorts of wonderful ripples in your choice of viewing opportunities as well.  Having suddenly discovered that Thomas Newman wrote not only the theme music for this series but also ""Boston Public,"" I paid attention to the superb Oscar nominated score he did for ""Road to Perdition"" and am now looking for some more of his soundtracks to check out.  Before this series Peter Krause was on ""Sportsnight,"" so that is the next television show I want to check out on DVD.  Of course, anything Lauren Ambrose does is going to catch my attention as well.  However, I have never, believe it or not, ever been to a funeral and nothing in this series has convinced me I am ever going to be able to.If you are interested in quality television then check out ""Six Feet Under.""

This allowed me to not have the (annoying, though effective) hindrance of waiting a week or more for a new episode, and the end result of ""Six Feet""'s first season is spectacular. Within season one, the various writers and directors juggle numerous plot strands that seem to get more interesting each episode, and have the classic peaks and valleys of any great drama writing. This is no ""put-people-on-a-desert-island (on in this case, a funeral home) and-see-what-happens"" stunt, as some may think. This is television drama at its best - don't be put off by the contuining gag of a new death at the beginning of each episode - much more richness lies in the hour that follows it. What may be most interesting about the show, and even more than its constantly great intertwining plots, has to be the way that actors Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, Frances Conroy, Lauren Ambrose, and Rachel Griffiths evolve their characters. Krause proves to be an excellent lead, and the arc of his change from prodigal son to man of the house could be the show's most well-fleshed character trait. Hall alternates between staunch professionalism and childlike sexual desire, and his character is only aided by his at-first hidden homosexuality. Griffiths is often the comedic relief of the show in her own quirky and care-free way, but the show's writers don't let her get off easily. As Krause's girlfriend, she steadily draws him into a web of secrets and psychological games aided by her severely disturbed brother and psychiatrist parents. All of these characters are fantastic in their own way, but the two red-heads of the show, Frances Conroy and Lauren Ambrose, are the best. Ambrose often has the burden of the emotional weight of an episode as its only teenaged family member, and the way that the family's experiences interact with her constantly mixed-up life give her an opportunity to display her unusually prodigious talent of stealing the show not with comedy, but with honest, moving acting. This leaves Frances Conroy, the most unforgettable and enduring character on the show, and also the family's matriarch. A veteran of Arthur Miller and Woody Allen, she is THE character one can't take their eyes from. Sure, she may not have as many scenes as the others, but time and time again, she handles her material with the grace and skill that every great actress should. This may be a stretch here, but Conroy may be the great, overlooked joy of television today. She certainly is the finest actress in the business. Conroy and the amazing cast that help her shape ""Six Feet Under"" prove to be the finest ensemble cast on, yes, the finest drama on television today.",5,Absorbing and expertly written - the best drama on TV,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,2799,"['had', 'privilege', 'coming', 'DVD', 'set', 'Six', 'Feet', 'ever', 'having', 'seen', 'episodes', 'television', 'prior', 'allowed', 'not', 'have', 'annoying', 'effective', 'hindrance', 'waiting', 'week', 'more', 'new', 'episode', 'end', 'result', 'Six', 'Feet', 'first', 'season', 'spectacular', 'season', 'one', 'various', 'writers', 'directors', 'juggle', 'numerous', 'plot', 'strands', 'seem', 'get', 'more', 'interesting', 'episode', 'have', 'classic', 'peaks', 'valleys', 'great', 'drama', 'writing', 'put-people-on-a-desert-island', 'case', 'funeral', 'home', 'and-see-what-happens', 'stunt', 'may', 'think', 'television', 'drama', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'contuining', 'gag', 'new', 'death', 'beginning', 'episode', 'much', 'more', 'richness', 'lies', 'hour', 'What', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'constantly', 'great', 'intertwining', 'plots', 'be', 'way', 'actors', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'evolve', 'characters', 'Krause', 'be', 'excellent', 'lead', 'arc', 'change', 'prodigal', 'son', 'man', 'house', 'could', 'be', 'show', 'most', 'well-fleshed', 'character', 'trait', 'Hall', 'staunch', 'professionalism', 'childlike', 'sexual', 'desire', 'character', 'only', 'aided', 'at-first', 'hidden', 'homosexuality', 'Griffiths', 'often', 'comedic', 'relief', 'show', 'own', 'quirky', 'care-free', 'way', 'show', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'off', 'easily', 'Krause', 'girlfriend', 'steadily', 'web', 'secrets', 'psychological', 'games', 'aided', 'severely', 'disturbed', 'brother', 'psychiatrist', 'parents', 'characters', 'are', 'fantastic', 'own', 'way', 'two', 'red-heads', 'show', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'are', 'best', 'Ambrose', 'often', 'burden', 'emotional', 'weight', 'episode', 'only', 'teenaged', 'family', 'member', 'way', 'family', 'experiences', 'interact', 'constantly', 'mixed-up', 'life', 'give', 'opportunity', 'display', 'unusually', 'prodigious', 'talent', 'stealing', 'show', 'not', 'comedy', 'honest', 'moving', 'acting', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'enduring', 'character', 'show', 'also', 'family', 'matriarch', 'veteran', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'Sure', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'scenes', 'others', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'material', 'grace', 'skill', 'great', 'actress', 'should', 'may', 'be', 'stretch', 'here', 'Conroy', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'overlooked', 'joy', 'television', 'today', 'certainly', 'finest', 'actress', 'business', 'Conroy', 'amazing', 'cast', 'shape', 'Six', 'Feet', 'prove', 'be', 'finest', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'yes', 'finest', 'drama', 'television', 'today']",N/A

Its first season proved to be a very strong start for the provocative HBO series.  Viewers immediately became intrigued with the Fishers, a Los Angeles family who own a funeral home.  When patriarch Nathaniel is killed in an accident, wife Ruth, sons David and Nate, and daughter Claire are forced to suddenly deal with the loss of their beloved, but twisted family member.  The plots center around the family moving on (slowly and emotionally) from their father's death, and then trudging through the issues of their separate lives.Ruth (Frances Conroy) becomes riddled with guilt for cheating on her husband while he was alive.  Nate (Peter Krause) begrudgingly rejoins his family after his rebellious escape to Seattle and begins a chaotic romance with bizarre Brenda.  David (Michael C. Hall) suffers with the secrecy of his gay life and the responsibility of running the business in his father's absence.  Claire (Lauren Ambrose) is caught up with a bad crowd in school, uses drugs, and has a volcanic relationship with her criminal boyfriend.  They are not the perfect family, which always makes for great drama.Other characters add depth as outsiders to the Fisher struggles.  Freddy Rodriguez is excellent as Rico, a young embalmer who is trying to decide if staying with Fisher and Sons is the right thing to do.  It goes without saying that Rachel Griffiths is a scene-stealer as Brenda, Nate's dysfunctional massage therapist lover.  She's already won an Emmy and much critical acclaim.  Keith, played by Matthew St. Patrick, is also a unique character.  He is David's lover, but he's not the stereotypical gay man.  He's a huge, authoritative, intimidating police officer.The plots thicken after the family mourns Nathaniel.  Everything from a monopolizing company's threats to shut Fisher and Sons down to Nate discovering the twisted nature of Brenda's relationship with brother Billy (Jeremy Sisto) lend some soap-opera moments to keep viewers glued to their sets.  One thing you might not expect from such a dark series is all of the humor.  There are many dry jokes and embarassing situations; it's not all death and depression.  Need proof?  Watch the episode involving the foot.  Or simply watch for appearances by the ghost of Nathaniel, who loves commenting on his family's ups and downs.Overall, this show is a great mix of macabre and humanity.  You'll cry, you'll laugh, and you'll be endlessly fascinated.

Never,was I hooked from the very first episode to any series as I was on Six Feet Under.Words can not justly describe how wonderful it is,but I will try anyway,otherwise this would be one short and empty review!It is truly addictive, and this is not by chance: The writing is wonderfully superior, the acting and direction are above average: A morbid setting, a dysfunctional family,very colourful and distinctly different characters, dialogue that is at times funny at others poignant,and a plot that has some unexpected twists and development.This is all tied together by a sort of Lynchian surrealism and dream like flow.As I meantioned above,all the actors are brilliant, but one in particular gave Six Feet Under an indirect and invaluable boost, Rachel Griffiths: her character is neurotic,complex, pretty, naughty and very sexy.Six Feet Under is a series that I hope will continue for several seasons to come, one that on no account should be missed.This is one positive addiction!",5,Positive  Addicition,1065571200,"10 8, 2003",2003,1335,"['am', 'avid', 'fan', 'number', 'TV', 'series', 'comedy', 'Cheers', 'Frazier', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Friends', 'sexy', 'fantasy', 'Xena', 'Lexx', 'mystery', 'X', 'files', 'vampires', 'Buffy', 'neurosis', 'Sopranos', 'almost', 'always', 'get', 'series', 'few', 'episodes', 'case', 'Sopranos', 'Friends', 'couple', 'seasons', 'Never', 'was', 'hooked', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'was', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Under.Words', 'can', 'not', 'justly', 'describe', 'how', 'wonderful', 'will', 'try', 'anyway', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'short', 'empty', 'review', 'truly', 'addictive', 'not', 'chance', 'writing', 'wonderfully', 'superior', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'morbid', 'setting', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'very', 'colourful', 'distinctly', 'different', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'times', 'funny', 'others', 'poignant', 'plot', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'development.This', 'tied', 'together', 'sort', 'Lynchian', 'surrealism', 'dream', 'flow.As', 'meantioned', 'actors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'one', 'particular', 'gave', 'Six', 'Feet', 'indirect', 'invaluable', 'boost', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'character', 'neurotic', 'complex', 'pretty', 'naughty', 'very', 'sexy.Six', 'Feet', 'series', 'hope', 'will', 'continue', 'several', 'seasons', 'come', 'one', 'account', 'should', 'be', 'missed.This', 'one', 'positive', 'addiction']",N/A

721337,A10X0JN8KTK89H,B00006NT1S,ninjasuperstar,"[14, 15]","I have often heard people say that All in the Family could never be produced today. I think this is true, at least, for network television (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX). All in the Family captures a specific moment in both television and American history. Carroll O'Connor excellently renders the American bigot, Archie Bunker, and puts him up for scrutiny before a live audience. All in the Family was not entirely about political correctness and bigotry, but when you look back at the show, those social forces remain the reasons why it couldn't be produced today.Six Feet Under, uncensored, would certainly have no chance of being broadcast either. The politically correct imperative of contemporary American culture would sue and complain it to be another ""wardrobe malfunction."" The malfunction, however, is in the emotional and intellectual dishonesty of most TV shows today, of most mainstream culture today. I think almost all of television is a cartoon. I like Six Feet Under because it is not a does not turn its homosexual characters into the prancing man-boys of Will & Grace. The violence in Six Feet Under is well earned and integral to the drama and comedy of the series. The sex and human relationships in Six Feet Under are complicated and weird, which is completely normal. Mostly, it's refreshing to watch a show that cares about story and character instead of explosions, statutory sex objects, and impossibly melodramatic events.If All in the Family reflects a political awakening, taught through comedy, then Six Feet Under reflects a response to political correctness. The bigotry that All in the Family responds to is as monolithic and misanthropic as the political correctness Six Feet Under is responding to. Bigotry and political correctness are merely two sides of the same dishonesty; they are rules and codes for human behavior and expression that do not work out in real life. Archie Bunker was certainly not a subtle guy, but his assumptions about people different from him were wrong (and funny). Now, when everything is subtle and on politically correct eggshells, people are no longer honest. That's what Six Feet Under is about to me: We need to relearn how to trust others enough to be honest, and I think Six Feet Under accurately argues that not all honesty is mean, and avoiding confrontation isn't always nice.In the end, HBO does with Six Feet Under what the networks used to do: Respect the intelligence, maturity, and humanity of the audience.",5,Six Feet Under's place in television history,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,2478,"['have', 'often', 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'Family', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'produced', 'today', 'think', 'true', 'least', 'network', 'television', 'NBC', 'ABC', 'CBS', 'FOX', 'Family', 'specific', 'moment', 'television', 'American', 'history', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'excellently', 'American', 'bigot', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'live', 'audience', 'Family', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'political', 'correctness', 'bigotry', 'when', 'look', 'back', 'show', 'social', 'forces', 'remain', 'reasons', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'produced', 'today.Six', 'Feet', 'uncensored', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'chance', 'being', 'broadcast', 'either', 'politically', 'correct', 'imperative', 'contemporary', 'American', 'culture', 'would', 'sue', 'complain', 'be', 'wardrobe', 'malfunction', 'malfunction', 'however', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'dishonesty', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'today', 'most', 'mainstream', 'culture', 'today', 'think', 'almost', 'television', 'cartoon', 'like', 'Six', 'Feet', 'not', 'not', 'turn', 'homosexual', 'characters', 'prancing', 'man-boys', 'Will', 'Grace', 'violence', 'Six', 'Feet', 'well', 'earned', 'integral', 'drama', 'comedy', 'series', 'sex', 'human', 'relationships', 'Six', 'Feet', 'are', 'complicated', 'weird', 'completely', 'normal', 'Mostly', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'show', 'story', 'character', 'instead', 'explosions', 'statutory', 'sex', 'objects', 'impossibly', 'melodramatic', 'events.If', 'All', 'Family', 'political', 'awakening', 'taught', 'comedy', 'then', 'Six', 'Feet', 'response', 'political', 'correctness', 'bigotry', 'Family', 'monolithic', 'misanthropic', 'political', 'correctness', 'Six', 'Feet', 'responding', 'Bigotry', 'political', 'correctness', 'are', 'merely', 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'dishonesty', 'are', 'rules', 'codes', 'human', 'behavior', 'expression', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'real', 'life', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'subtle', 'guy', 'assumptions', 'people', 'different', 'were', 'wrong', 'funny', 'Now', 'when', 'everything', 'subtle', 'politically', 'correct', 'eggshells', 'people', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'honest', 'what', 'Six', 'Feet', 'need', 'relearn', 'how', 'trust', 'others', 'enough', 'be', 'honest', 'think', 'Six', 'Feet', 'accurately', 'not', 'honesty', 'mean', 'avoiding', 'confrontation', ""n't"", 'always', 'nice.In', 'end', 'HBO', 'Six', 'Feet', 'what', 'networks', 'used', 'do', 'Respect', 'intelligence', 'maturity', 'humanity', 'audience']",N/A

Nate the weekend hippy returns to help them with their business and makes a new girlfriend, Brenda the daughter of not just one but two psychiatrists who has many secrets.Episode themes include reunions, inheritance, severed feet, gangs, decons, old age, the army, dating, accidental gun death, mental health, babies and homophobia.Six Feet Under is a real mental magnet that hooks you from the opening sequences to the closing credits. You will be hard pressed to find a better drama out there. The whole thing just knocks you for 10 with its many twists and original take on life.

""Six Feet Under,"" created by Alan Ball (who is most well known as the writer behindAmerican Beauty), is a comfortable and homey show that will touch and challenge you.  But even during the most sad or thought-provoking moments, you'll be laughing.  This is the kind of show where you can walk into the room while an episode is playing and instantly start laughing, despite how little you may know of these (brilliantly flawed and beautiful) characters.  The comic timing of these actors and the precision of the writing is admirable, but it's worth a mention that the humor is very dry and often dark.  That's how I like my humor, but it might not be someone else's cuppa.While ""Six Feet Under"" has universal themes of life and death (more of the latter), it isn't a show for everyone.  Some people love it while others simply don't get it.  I absolutely find myself in the former category, but I understand why the humor is lost on some people.  I feel that most people who DO give the show a try will enjoy it, but the pacing and dialogue-heavy scenes may not please the impatient.  Those people--I've met some, and was disappointed that my love of the show wasn't shared--are often the same people that seeBuffyas just a show about vampires andVeronica Marsas just a high-school/detective drama.  With both of those shows, that is not the case, and it's also true here that ""Six Feet Under"" isn't JUST a show about a family running funeral home.  The character arcs and situations in each of these thirteen episodes are enthralling and the overall season is superb, especially for a first.  I'd list the highlights and low-points, but there aren't any weak links in this season.LikeAmerican Beauty, this well-acted and well-written series is arty but not pretentious.

721351,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00006NT1S,RMurray847,"[5, 6]","Thank God for DVDs.  We do not have cable in our household, and so we often hear about these great shows on HBO or basic cable, but don't get to see them when they first come out.  DVD sets allow my wife and I a great chance to catch up, whether with terrific comedies (CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, RENO 911) or dramas (SOPRANOS), or, in wonderful case of SIX FEET UNDER, a strange, nearly sublime combination of the two.By sublime, I don't simply mean ""good.""  Sublime implies something that creates a feeling of ease or relaxation.  A good meal can be sublime.  And the lovely gelling of the ridiculous and the ordinary, the laughable with the tragic, is what makes SIX FEET UNDER so good.It's a treat to be able to watch the series essentially in a bunch.  Although we don't have time for a marathon session (watching them all in one day, for example) we do manage one episode every couple of days.  So the emerging story feels great.Creator Alan Ball mixed similar comedic/tragic events in the terrific film AMERICAN BEAUTY.  SIX FEET UNDER explores similar topics of family members at dis-ease with each other...locked into relationships that prevent the individual from persuing their dreams...which Ball would have us believe is the source of our follies and our unhappiness.  We do silly, funny, wacky things do allow ourselves to have some ""fun"" or pursue a personal goal that might not mesh with what everyone else in our immediate social system wants.  We also do foolhardy, dangerous and regrettable things for the same reasons.  In the process, we bounce off those closest to us, sometimes harmoniously, sometimes destructively or hurtfully.  What's great about SIX FEET UNDER is that the creators understand that these two conditions happen SIMULTANEOULSY.  To the person they are happening to, it may not feel that way, but for a compassionate observer, the pain is leavened by humor...and the dark humor is shot through with anguish.  GOOD STUFF.The show is sharply written, and wonderfully cast.  Peter Krause and Michael Hall as the two VERY different brothers are quite good.  They don't have any problems showing their ugly or at least unattractive sides, but we are able to see the goodness beneath the squabbling.  Frances Conroy is wonderfully insane as the mother.  Richard Jenkins (deserving of Oscar nomination for NORTH COUNTRY) as the dead father is laconic, ironic, bitter and very funny.  I think the best discovery may be Lauren Ambrose as the teenage sister.  Ignored by the rest of her much older family, she may just be too smart for the room.  Certainly, she's too smart for her school.  A character like this (goofy clothing, unusual car [a green hearse!], smart-ass mouth) sounds quite clich&eacute;d...but in this young lady's hands, she makes it seem original and BELIEVABLE.  We see that she's very smart and observant, but also, that she is a kid experiencing some pretty adult things for the first time...on her own.I also love the theme music.Very small downsides:  we know this is a fractured family, but when they lose their father very suddenly, there should be more signs of grief, or at least mixed emotions.  Instead, they mostly seem put off by the inconvenience.  Even people who are estranged from their parents almost always muster up more emotion when faced with a sudden death.  And yes, I know they're in the funeral business, but that's like saying a doctor can't get emotional over his/her own illness.  Also, the key plot point of the ""large funeral-home conglomerate"" working so hard to drive them out of business is to me a bit cartoonish...an awkwardly concealed dig at Wal-Mart and its ilk.  I don't mind the idea of competition from a big corporation...it's the Machiavellian machinations that don't quite fit.  These are minor quibbles, though.We both enjoy the show immensely.  It's been said before, but because it's true, I'll say it again...there's nothing else quite like SIX FEET UNDER.  I've only seen Season 1, but can't wait to dive into the second...and third...and fourth!!",5,A real treat...intelligent and highly entertaining!,1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,4042,"['Thank', 'God', 'DVDs', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'cable', 'household', 'so', 'often', 'hear', 'great', 'shows', 'HBO', 'basic', 'cable', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'when', 'first', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'allow', 'wife', 'great', 'chance', 'catch', 'up', 'terrific', 'comedies', 'CURB', 'YOUR', 'ENTHUSIASM', 'RENO', '911', 'dramas', 'SOPRANOS', 'wonderful', 'case', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'strange', 'nearly', 'sublime', 'combination', 'two.By', 'sublime', 'do', ""n't"", 'simply', 'mean', 'good', 'Sublime', 'implies', 'something', 'feeling', 'ease', 'relaxation', 'good', 'meal', 'can', 'be', 'sublime', 'lovely', 'gelling', 'ridiculous', 'ordinary', 'laughable', 'tragic', 'what', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'good.It', 'treat', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'series', 'essentially', 'bunch', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'marathon', 'session', 'watching', 'one', 'day', 'example', 'do', 'manage', 'one', 'episode', 'couple', 'days', 'emerging', 'story', 'feels', 'great.Creator', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'mixed', 'similar', 'comedic/tragic', 'events', 'terrific', 'film', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'similar', 'topics', 'family', 'members', 'dis-ease', 'other', 'locked', 'relationships', 'prevent', 'individual', 'persuing', 'dreams', 'Ball', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'source', 'follies', 'unhappiness', 'do', 'silly', 'funny', 'wacky', 'things', 'do', 'allow', 'have', 'fun', 'pursue', 'personal', 'goal', 'might', 'not', 'mesh', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'immediate', 'social', 'system', 'also', 'do', 'foolhardy', 'dangerous', 'regrettable', 'things', 'same', 'reasons', 'process', 'bounce', 'off', 'closest', 'sometimes', 'harmoniously', 'sometimes', 'destructively', 'hurtfully', 'What', 'great', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'creators', 'understand', 'two', 'conditions', 'happen', 'SIMULTANEOULSY', 'person', 'are', 'happening', 'may', 'not', 'feel', 'way', 'compassionate', 'observer', 'pain', 'leavened', 'humor', 'dark', 'humor', 'shot', 'anguish', 'GOOD', 'STUFF.The', 'show', 'sharply', 'written', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'two', 'VERY', 'different', 'brothers', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'showing', 'ugly', 'least', 'unattractive', 'sides', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'goodness', 'squabbling', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'wonderfully', 'insane', 'mother', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'NORTH', 'COUNTRY', 'dead', 'father', 'laconic', 'ironic', 'bitter', 'very', 'funny', 'think', 'best', 'discovery', 'may', 'be', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'teenage', 'sister', 'Ignored', 'rest', 'much', 'older', 'family', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'too', 'smart', 'room', 'Certainly', 'too', 'smart', 'school', 'character', 'goofy', 'clothing', 'unusual', 'car', 'green', 'hearse', ']', 'smart-ass', 'mouth', 'quite', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'young', 'lady', 'hands', 'seem', 'original', 'BELIEVABLE', 'see', 'very', 'smart', 'observant', 'also', 'kid', 'experiencing', 'pretty', 'adult', 'things', 'first', 'time', 'own.I', 'also', 'love', 'theme', 'music.Very', 'small', 'downsides', 'know', 'fractured', 'family', 'when', 'lose', 'father', 'very', 'suddenly', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'signs', 'grief', 'least', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'Instead', 'mostly', 'seem', 'put', 'off', 'inconvenience', 'Even', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'estranged', 'parents', 'almost', 'always', 'muster', 'up', 'more', 'emotion', 'when', 'faced', 'sudden', 'death', 'yes', 'know', ""'re"", 'funeral', 'business', 'saying', 'doctor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'emotional', 'own', 'illness', 'Also', 'key', 'plot', 'point', 'large', 'funeral-home', 'conglomerate', 'working', 'so', 'hard', 'drive', 'business', 'bit', 'cartoonish', 'awkwardly', 'concealed', 'dig', 'Wal-Mart', 'ilk', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'idea', 'competition', 'big', 'corporation', 'Machiavellian', 'machinations', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'enjoy', 'show', 'immensely', 'been', 'said', 'true', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'nothing', 'else', 'quite', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'Season', '1', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'dive', 'second', 'third', 'fourth']",N/A

Williams ""just an avid reader""","[2, 2]","i watched all 4 of the discs last night. somewhat of a marathon, but i was certainly addicted from the first subtle but funny joke.What makes this an addictive series to me?it is unlike anything else i've watched on TV and appreciated.from Perry Mason, to The Waltons, to Scrubs, to MASH, i have pretty staid tastes.from Star Trek to Stargate, i have always had a weakness for scifi, but this series is about romance and difficult lives and interactions with people.all things which i usually find boring and consign to the wife's pile of dvd's.what can i possibly find interesting to the point of watching 12-13 hours straight?there is lots of coarse and sexually explicit language.one of the main characters is gay and spirals out of control in rather an explicit way.but mostly it is about death and dying. how people cope and how some people don't.it is a humor hiding a painful point, it is humor as coverup and ragged clothes so the nakedness of people's lives isn't so in your face.i've done a lot of thinking about death and dying over the last handful of years, perhaps that is why it rings a bell for me, when i won't have predicted it to.but it is the high quality of the writing and the directing that impresses me most.there are pieces that i just glanced at, that i pause or rewind for. i suspect i could even watch them a second time, something i very rarely can do.In a series, where they can develop the characters over many hours, character often takes a front seat to plot.But like the first Star Treks, each hour has a major point, the point is looked at from several people's ongoing lives, and often explored in a decent way, something TV is not known for.Completeness or even coherence. both figure high in these shows.The shows are thoughtful, artistically done, a bit heavy on the language but most of it is not gratuitous.it is going to turn a lot of people off to see men passionately kissing, big deal, ff if you have to.i am looking forward to my complete set arriving soon.i wonder how long i'll sit watching these before i fall asleep?",5,worth my while TV series,1187740800,"08 22, 2007",2007,2066,"['i', 'watched', '4', 'discs', 'last', 'night', 'somewhat', 'marathon', 'i', 'was', 'certainly', 'addicted', 'first', 'subtle', 'funny', 'joke.What', 'addictive', 'series', 'anything', 'else', 'i', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'TV', 'appreciated.from', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'Waltons', 'Scrubs', 'MASH', 'i', 'have', 'pretty', 'staid', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Stargate', 'i', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'weakness', 'scifi', 'series', 'romance', 'difficult', 'lives', 'interactions', 'people.all', 'things', 'i', 'usually', 'find', 'boring', 'consign', 'wife', 'pile', ""dvd's.what"", 'can', 'i', 'possibly', 'find', 'interesting', 'point', 'watching', '12-13', 'hours', 'straight', 'lots', 'coarse', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'language.one', 'main', 'characters', 'gay', 'spirals', 'control', 'rather', 'explicit', 'way.but', 'mostly', 'death', 'dying', 'how', 'people', 'cope', 'how', 'people', ""don't.it"", 'humor', 'hiding', 'painful', 'point', 'humor', 'coverup', 'ragged', 'clothes', 'nakedness', 'people', 'lives', ""n't"", 'so', 'face.i', ""'ve"", 'done', 'lot', 'thinking', 'death', 'dying', 'last', 'handful', 'years', 'perhaps', 'why', 'bell', 'when', 'i', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'predicted', 'high', 'quality', 'writing', 'directing', 'are', 'pieces', 'i', 'just', 'glanced', 'i', 'pause', 'rewind', 'i', 'suspect', 'i', 'could', 'even', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'something', 'i', 'very', 'rarely', 'can', 'do.In', 'series', 'where', 'can', 'develop', 'characters', 'many', 'hours', 'character', 'often', 'front', 'seat', 'plot.But', 'first', 'Star', 'Treks', 'hour', 'major', 'point', 'point', 'looked', 'several', 'people', 'ongoing', 'lives', 'often', 'explored', 'decent', 'way', 'something', 'TV', 'not', 'known', 'for.Completeness', 'even', 'coherence', 'figure', 'high', 'shows.The', 'shows', 'are', 'thoughtful', 'artistically', 'done', 'bit', 'heavy', 'language', 'most', 'not', 'gratuitous.it', 'going', 'turn', 'lot', 'people', 'see', 'men', 'passionately', 'kissing', 'big', 'deal', 'ff', 'have', 'to.i', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'complete', 'set', 'arriving', 'soon.i', 'wonder', 'how', 'long', 'i', ""'ll"", 'sit', 'watching', 'i', 'fall', 'asleep']",N/A

721355,A1GF4BH6WPBZ4Y,B00006NT1S,Roman Pennington,"[5, 7]","Welcome to the world of Fisher & Sons.  This is an amazing immersive experience watching this series.  The acting is unparalleled; the cinematography is superior to any theatrical release you'll typically see; great casting; great music; simply wonderful.Not since Northern Exposure has a cast of characters been so interesting and dynamic. What's really great about this series is how it centers around the metaphors of life and death and a family and friends struggling to make sense of it all.  If someone told you an idea for a series that is based on the operators of a funeral home, you'd probably gag, but it turns out to be the perfect setting to address a myriad of social, emotional and intellectual issues.One thing you notice among the reviews here is that people either love it or don't understand it (and thus write the series off as whiny, self-indulgant hype, which is quite ironic - perhaps they were expecting more explosions and car chases?).  Since the show has some gay characters which are often portrayed as responsible, positive (yet often struggling) role models, homophobes will undoubtedly fixate on this and not get beyond it.  Like reality, the characters make mistakes and bad decisions, but unlike the movies, things are not always conveniently resolved, which is a refreshing breeze in comparison to the shallow tripe elsewhere.  This is a show about life, and SFU proves that there's no better way to understand what life is all about without embracing death.  Brilliant.Some shows entertain you; but a true work of art will make you think; will change your perspective.  SFU does that.  You will not be the same after you watch this series.  I agree with others here that there is no better television series that I've ever seen to date.The first two seasons are spectacular.  The next two seem to slow down a bit.  It seems as if the writers stretched one show's worth of plotlines into four or five episodes and dragged things to a crawl.  But the last season has kicked things into gear and will probably appropriately book-end what is unquestionably one of the best, if not the best dramatic series of all time.If you haven't seen the show, this is a no-brainer.

I'd seen some sit-coms and dramas before, ones that are hard not to see, even outside the US (Friends, Seinfeld, Sex and the City, etc.), but none of them struck me as true and real as SFU did. Going far beyond being true and real, SFU shows us moments that are disturbingly profound where we cannot but seriously examine our own lives along with those of the characters. In this regard, I think what Virginia Woolf said of a Shakespeare tragedy (Macbeth? Othello?) equally applies to SFU. Watch it once every year, and you will have a deeper understanding of life.I love each and every episode of SFU of all 5 seasons, but if I have to pick one favorite from the 1st season, it would be ""The Room."" Here, we, along with Nate, encounter the hidden, unknown aspects of Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. Nate remembers his recently deceased father as being manipulative, domineering, and retreating. So, it is with surprise and confusion that he embarks on the pursuit of knowing what his father was really like. Although he has glimpses of his father as a witty, wicked, weird, great guy, him now being dead, there's no way to know for certain.The episode is strongly suggestive of Paul Auster's The Invention of Solitude, equally pervaded with sadness and despair of not really knowing what our father was like, as a person. It contains one of the most memorable quotes from the show as well. When Nate gets to have a brief conversation with his father (the ""ghost"" of Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. appears at important moments througout the show) about the meaning of life, his father sums up the futility of pursuing such question by saying: ""Life is wasted on the living."" I often thought of this moment while I was reading Plato's Phaedo, another unabashedly serious investigation of the ""meaning of life"" and ""afterlife.""",5,"""life is wasted on the living....""",1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1872,"['Six', 'Feet', 'first', 'American', 'TV', 'show', 'watched', 'loved', ""'d"", 'seen', 'sit-coms', 'dramas', 'ones', 'are', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'even', 'US', 'Friends', 'Seinfeld', 'Sex', 'City', 'etc', 'none', 'struck', 'true', 'real', 'SFU', 'did', 'Going', 'far', 'being', 'true', 'real', 'SFU', 'moments', 'are', 'disturbingly', 'profound', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'seriously', 'examine', 'own', 'lives', 'characters', 'regard', 'think', 'what', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'said', 'Shakespeare', 'tragedy', 'Macbeth', 'Othello', 'equally', 'SFU', 'Watch', 'once', 'year', 'will', 'have', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'life.I', 'love', 'episode', 'SFU', '5', 'seasons', 'have', 'pick', 'one', 'favorite', '1st', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'Room', 'Here', 'Nate', 'encounter', 'hidden', 'unknown', 'aspects', 'Nathaniel', 'Fisher', 'Sr.', 'Nate', 'remembers', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father', 'being', 'manipulative', 'domineering', 'retreating', 'So', 'surprise', 'confusion', 'pursuit', 'knowing', 'what', 'father', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'glimpses', 'father', 'witty', 'wicked', 'weird', 'great', 'guy', 'now', 'being', 'dead', 'way', 'know', 'certain.The', 'episode', 'strongly', 'suggestive', 'Paul', 'Auster', 'Invention', 'Solitude', 'equally', 'pervaded', 'sadness', 'despair', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'father', 'was', 'like', 'person', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'Nate', 'have', 'brief', 'conversation', 'father', 'ghost', 'Nathaniel', 'Fisher', 'Sr.', 'important', 'moments', 'show', 'meaning', 'life', 'father', 'sums', 'up', 'futility', 'pursuing', 'such', 'question', 'saying', 'Life', 'wasted', 'living', 'often', 'thought', 'moment', 'was', 'reading', 'Plato', 'Phaedo', 'unabashedly', 'serious', 'investigation', 'meaning', 'life', 'afterlife']",N/A

Fine, but this aspect of his character is paraded throughout the series accompanied by explicit scenes in gay bars and in the bedroom. Something I really do not wish to see. I suppose this is viewed as hip. It is possibly even a taboo to dare mention this. But it may save some other unsuspecting soul, who in the confines of his private chamber, is perhaps not so hip.There is no character who is admirable. No one is honest. No one posseses a shred of dignity. The schtik of using a funeral home as a setting is novel and even interesting at times.

A buyer can make that decision on their own, what they choose to spend.  A review is supposed to be about the PRODUCT: in this case, Season 1 of Six Feet Under.  Is it worth watching?  YES  Is it an entertaining show?  YES  Are the storylines and characters engaging and interesting?  YES  Is it worth the hours spent watching it?  YESOver the last few years I started renting TV shows on DVD and watching the series consequtively, I found that I enjoy it more this way.  I can watch one or two episodes a night- many nights in a row if I want.  It is helpful in getting sort of hooked on a show, and also keeping the momentum of the storylines going, and also my memory of events (vs. watching it over a period of say 5 years).  So, if you're looking at Six Feet Under as a series like this to buy/watch- I highly recommend it.  Buy it, rent it, borrow it from a friend, watch re-runs, whatever you want.  But do NOT miss this show!  I might just bite the bullet and say perhaps this is my favorite TV show of ALL time.Ok, as for Season 1...it's a bit slow going for me at first.  I think my hubby and I were on disc two and we sort of looked at each other and said, do we want to keep watching this?  The characters just weren't clicking for us.  And the funny dream and daydream sequences were annoying.  But, I said, let's finish the season out and then see what we think.  I am SO glad that we did!  By then, we were hooked.  Each night we looked forward to an episode or two of Six Feet Under.  Sometimes I ran out to the video store at 10pm to get a new one because we just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.So ya...the stories get better, the characters get a bit more defined and fun, and eventually there are less weird dream sequences.  So if you are looking for a TV show that will keep you up at night watching, this is it!

721376,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00006NT1S,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[7, 17]","One of the things I love most about Judd Apatow movies and televisions shows (espeicallyFreaks and Geeks - The Complete Seriesis the way he starts out with characters that seem bland and stereotypical, yet as the movie or series progresses they reveal themselves to have hidden depths and by the end of the series, they are both completely different and utterly the same. Why do I bring up Judd Apatow in a review of an Alan Ball series?Because Alan Ball is the opposite of Judd Apatow.He starts out with interesting well realized characters and somehow over the course of one season, he turns them into shrill little stereotypical idiots without personality. I'm not quite sure how he does it but somehow he manages. It's been over a year since I sawTrue Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)and every day I'm still pondering how a series that I eagerly watched every week marveling at the cool and interesting interactions came to a close leaving me with a feeling that I had just wasted 13 hours. Partially I blame Jefferson's transformation from amoral hustler to moralistic sermonizer who is somehow shocked that his one client is a hypocrite and a public bigot.With this series, I'm less inclined to be taken in. The opening death sequences are both fascinating and haunting. I love the way they illustrate just how random death can be. The brothers are realistic in their conflicts and their problems. I initially liked Michael C. Hall's dilemma as a conservative businessman coming to terms with his emerging homosexuality. Every character is likeably messed up.Only, it changes. By the penultimate episode where Hall is being told to COME OUT already by the ghost of the dead gay-bashing victim, I was getting tired of it. The whole Brenda/Billy dynamic seemed plausible at first but then over the top. Sure, Billy shows some guilt at the end to show why Brenda puts up with him, but I'm still not believing that Brenda would put up with him. Lauren Ambrose's depiction of Claire is worldly and heartbreakingly sincere especially when she is trying to take care of the messed up guy.Ultimately, this thing has too mcuh going. The characters transform from interesting to tedious. It's like Alan Ball had nowhere to go with them so he just kept them going until they just couldn't sustain themselves without whining. And the BIG MESSAGE episodes are too much. Too many conversations began and end with ""I am gay. But I can't accept it because...""Good individual episodes but as a whole, nothing special.",2,Coming late to the party.

Scanlon,"[14, 15]","Sorry my title mimics that of others, but that's what I've been saying about it for a long time.Like the Sopranos, this is a series the hype for which I didn't give in to orginally. Then I saw some reviews by one of my favorite  Washington Post critics that teased me. So I watched, probably close to half way through the first season. It hooked me instantly.First, as others point out, the acting is incredible. My spouse and I are wondering each episode who's the best actor. In one of the DVD episodes tonight, I felt it was Frances Conroy (Ruth) who I usually do. I've always been in love with Lauren Ambrose (Claire). All right, I have many friends with daughters older than she. What I mean is, I envy the kid. She's got a great future with her acting talent (and her expressions which will break you up!) The others are all fabulous too. Jeremy Sisto (Billy Chenowith) really does convince you that he's absolutely nuts...a change from his portrayal of Jesus in a TV movie a few years ago! And I've never seen his sister Brenda (God help me, I can't think of the actress's name) slip into her New Zealand accent. Again, they all vie for best actor/actress each episode!There is an uncannily good mix of humor and drama. That's why I say it beats anything else on the tube. If I thought of getting rid of HBO, it's this series...and maybe The Wire...that would keep me. For months in advance my wife and I talk about the coming season; we can't wait for it.It's risque without being gross. The gay issue is intelligently handled. Oh, and I've always wondered if Peter C. Marshall (David) and Matthew St. Patrick (Keith) were straight in real life. Among the extra features of the DVD set is that you learn that they are.Another feature of the DVD set is the discussion among all those responsible for the opening sequence and theme music. Then there's the discussion with cast members as to their favorite scenes. (My favorite is also Lauren Ambrose's, when she's lethargic about being in love. A gem!)It's a fabulous series that can't be beat. Well, my inlaws wouldn't like it. And don't show it to any of your guests or relatives who are prudes. I got in trouble with some family members at the beginning of one in the second season. And some of the gay scenes while, again, not gross, are threatening to people not accustomed to gay scenes. But it covers oh so many subjects you don't normally see covered...too many to even mention here. The scripts are brilliant, the acting the best. And the added benefits of the DVD series are well worth the cost of the set, in addition to having those superb episodes to watch again and again.
