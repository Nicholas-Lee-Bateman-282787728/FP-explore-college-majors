I found all 3 stories pretty predictable, but if you have read/seen enough of these type of mystery/suspense stories you get an instinct for their twists. Regardless, it is well done and adapted from tales from one of the masters of short horror, Richard Matheson, so the rhythm and twists of the movie are down to perfection, even if you may see them coming a mile off. It's just that well done with the right amount of humor, but avoiding camp.

I'm not going into lurid detail (that's already been done on these pages), but suffice to say that while the visual effects from this little short are showing their age (although I still find them effective), it's the SOUND: both from my childhood memory and watching it now, that provokes the sleeplessness and the nightmares when sleep finally comes. It struck me as funny how that sound brought all that terror from my youth back to me.My daughter enjoyed this DVD with me, and whereas she suffers from being jaded by modern entertainment and finds classic movies that chilled me like ""The Entity"" rather dull, THIS one actually had her fidgiting and visibly uncomfortable.That to me said it all...across two generations of MY family at least, this one is a frightener.",5,"Hasn't lost it's ""bite""...",1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,1312,"['so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'first', 'saw', 'kid', '70s', 'late', 'night', 'TV', 'likewise', 'scared', 'living', 'hell', 'me.The', 'first', 'two', 'stories', 'admittedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'memory', 'time', 'rewatching', 'find', 'be', 'entertaining', 'creepy', 'own', 'way', 'more', 'dark', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'stories', 'terror', 'tales', 'do', 'show', 'versatility', 'Karen', 'Black', 'versatility', 'last', 'chapter.The', 'third', 'installment', 'Amelia', 'what', 'got', 'then', 'still', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'lurid', 'detail', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'pages', 'suffice', 'say', 'visual', 'effects', 'little', 'short', 'are', 'showing', 'age', 'still', 'find', 'effective', 'SOUND', 'childhood', 'memory', 'watching', 'now', 'sleeplessness', 'nightmares', 'when', 'sleep', 'finally', 'struck', 'funny', 'how', 'sound', 'brought', 'terror', 'youth', 'back', 'me.My', 'daughter', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'being', 'jaded', 'modern', 'entertainment', 'classic', 'movies', 'chilled', 'Entity', 'rather', 'dull', 'THIS', 'one', 'actually', 'had', 'fidgiting', 'visibly', 'uncomfortable.That', 'said', 'two', 'generations', 'MY', 'family', 'least', 'one', 'frightener']",N/A

The movie actually consists of three short films, each one starring Karen Black.  In the first, she plays a college professor who is being blackmailed by a student; you feel her pain and then surprise as the situation shifts.  In the second story, Black plays twins with opposite personalities, and she does a fine job in both roles.  Again, the plot contains a Twilight Zone-like, unexpected twist in the end.  Finally, in probably the most famous of the three tales, Black plays a woman who receives a statue of a small Zuni warrior as a gift.  In what may have been a foreshadowing for the Gremlins movie that would follow (""don't get them wet!""), the statute includes specific instructions not to remove the chain which encircles the doll's waist.  Of course, the chain--which obviously has not been secured very well--falls, the evil spirit inside the warrior comes to life, and Black is terrorized within her apartment.  I admit, not only was I extremely frightened by this, but I tortured my little sister with fears of ""the little guy under the bed"" for years!

I so relate to the other viewers here who saw this movie when they were younger. I remember the first two tales in this movie were ok, Karen Black is one of the great consumate actresses of the 70's I feel in the horror/disaster genre.  She performed her three roles here with absolute freedom to do what she does best, but really shines in the last tale which I KNOW for most of you stands out the most.My first experience seeing the third tale of Karen portraying a young woman terrorized by an Indian doll whose evil spirit was accidentally set loose being one of sheer terror. Hey all, remember the scene where she traps the doll in the suitcase and we see the knife coming up through it, cutting a hole open?  I could absolutely not move from that couch, neither could my sister.  We were genuinely frightened. I also remember reading later in the TV guide about the making of the third tale and of how the simple concept of rollerskates gave the picture of the doll running around the apt. constantly terrorizing Karen's character. No high digital effects-rollerskates!  Simplicity sometimes brings the best results, modern day movie people!I look forward to adding this to my 70's tv DVD collection and will enjoy.

If you have no memory of this Zuni doll, you did not see it.  And if you did and still don't remember it, there are 2 possibilities:1.  You had no cognitive ability at that time and thus, just didn't notice it (maybe you were too young or too busy playing with Matchbox cars).2.  You were simply in shock and subsequently, have no memory of it.  (The human mind has a way of preserving itself, so I'm told.)This show has 3 decent tales, and the first 2 are entertaining enough for adults.  As a kid, I don't remember them and as an ""adult,"" they are just fine and a good watch for a weekday.  Years ago, movies were made for folks with patience and appreciation for imagination.  Just take a look and you will enjoy them.  And I am convinced the first 2 were made to lull the young kids into staying in the room not expecting to be scared silly.The FINAL story is what haunted me for years.  There's no need to explain the details as they have been covered and besides, they are too frightening and painful.  There's a chain, and a bathtub, and a spear, and a knife, and teeth, and......  STOP!!!!!In college, I worked in a records/records/video store chain and innocently enough.  That is, until one day I found this video on the shelf and there it was; that Zuni Doll on the cover!  Instantly, I remembered it and all the horrible memories.  And I had NO option other than to take it home to watch it, AGAIN.  And of course, at night with all the lights out; and alone.  Yes, all those same fears, shocks, etc., instantly returned.20 years after that college experience, I was reminded of it again and confided in my lovely and caring bride the sheer terror this show induced.

My sister and I saw this film back in the early 80s and it scared the living crap out of me. I couldn't sleep for maybe 2 weeks straight after watching it. I kept thinking that damn doll was underneath my bed or opening my door. Every little noise that I heard in my room I thought was that bastard walking around my bed. UGH I never wanna go through that again! I used to hate taking baths cause of that scene where she tries to drown it in the tub and it pops it's ugly head out of the water. To this very day, I see a green old suitcase and I think of her trying to capture it in there. What I don't get is WHY on earth would she even buy such a hideous looking thing in the first place! I'd never bring such an evil looking thing like that into my living room and I would have tossed it outside the window the second I got my hands on it. The damn doll is scary enough just looking at it, when you add him running around like a maniac with that knife and making that horrible screaming sound well it's just a zillion times worse. I am 27 years old now and I have seen this movie since I was a child and I STILL find it very frightening. I try to laugh at how ridiculous the whole thing is but I can't get over my fear of it. To this day I won't watch it, I saw it on DVD the other day in a store and I nearly freaked just seeing the cover. I hope the people that made this movie know how many children and adults it has terrified over the years. Karen Black is once scary chick! She will always remind me of that movie and therefore I can never watch one of her movies again lol. We should start a Trilogy of Terror therapy group!! lol***EDITED FOR NEW SPECIAL EDITION DVD***I was thrilled to hear Dark Sky Films was re-releasing this tv movie on DVD. It had been very hard to find the original Anchor Bay version anywhere. Plus this one is loaded with special features! I love the commentary and featurettes. Karen Black still looks good after 30 years and I loved hearing her talk about the difficulties of working with the doll. The picture quality looks fabulous too, almost as if it were airing originally for the first time. The special effects may be cheesy and fake but it still packs a punch when it comes to it's creepiness. Using mostly stop motion animation and fast editing, the Zuni doll seems to come alive and run around like a maniac. It's still creepy no matter how ridiculously fake it looks. What makes this doll so evil compared to Chucky and other imitations is the way it looks. It's demonic looking even when it's just still in the box. It looks evil and angry and ready to kill. It cannot be reasoned with and it has a relentless pursuit to kill poor Karen Black. For me that is what makes it truly terrifying. Plus it's so damn fast! Those eery sounds it makes as it's running around with the knife are still frightening to hear, most especially towards the end when it's in the oven. Oh and that ending is still scary to watch even though you know it's coming! It's a 30 minute segment that has influenced and terrorized people for over 30 years and for that it should be commended. I'm sure they had no idea they would still be talking about it to this day. I have yet to watch the first two stories, but I'm sure they will never be as creepy as ""Amelia"".

This tell was never fully fleshed out about a college professor who has dark secrets.  Nice quirky ending keeps this one for being average.The second is ""Millicent and Therese"".  After the promise of ""Julie"", I really expected a bit more from this rather obvious tale.  Is good fun, just nothing special.  Still a fine showcase for Black to show what she can do.  It was just so all totally out there, no twist of the screw to make it more.""Amelia"" The final one is based on Richard Matheson's Prey, and it outstanding.  Once you see these story you will never forget the Zuni warrior that comes to life.  Amelia is totally abused by her possessive and controlling mother.  She tries to break these ties that bind, but she is no match.  She buys a Zuni doll and it comes to life.  No spoiler there.  You can see that by the cover.  It's the story that is amazing.  Black's ending is original and memorable.This was low budget telly movie remember, so accept the quality  as not motion picture level.Still a GREAT Halloween movie and tribute to Curtis who died March '' this year.",5,Look out for the Zuni!!!,1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,1802,"['Back', 'heyday', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'did', 'telly', 'movies', 'Frankenstein', 'Robert', 'Foxworth', 'Norliss', 'Tapes', 'Roy', 'Thinnes', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'Darren', 'Mcgavin', 'Scream', 'Wolf', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'then', 'eventually', 'went', 'do', 'bigger', 'projects', 'Winds', 'War', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'salad', 'days', 'mid', '1970s', 'did', 'nifty', 'novella', 'style', 'movie', 'called', 'Trilogy', 'Terror', 'Karen', 'Black', 'went', 'use', 'Black', 'Burnt', 'Offerings', 'following', 'year.It', 'three', 'story', 'showcase', 'displaying', 'varied', 'talents', 'Black', 'last', 'one', 'where', 'Curtis', 'out', 'really', 'something', 'memorable.The', 'first', 'novella', 'tale', 'Julie', 'tell', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Nice', 'quirky', 'ending', 'keeps', 'one', 'being', 'average.The', 'second', 'Millicent', 'Therese', 'promise', 'Julie', 'really', 'expected', 'bit', 'more', 'rather', 'obvious', 'tale', 'good', 'fun', 'just', 'nothing', 'special', 'Still', 'fine', 'showcase', 'Black', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'all', 'totally', 'there', 'twist', 'screw', 'make', 'more', 'Amelia', 'final', 'one', 'based', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Prey', 'outstanding', 'see', 'story', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Zuni', 'warrior', 'life', 'Amelia', 'totally', 'abused', 'possessive', 'controlling', 'mother', 'break', 'ties', 'bind', 'match', 'Zuni', 'doll', 'life', 'spoiler', 'there', 'can', 'see', 'cover', 'story', 'amazing', 'Black', 'ending', 'original', 'memorable.This', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'telly', 'movie', 'remember', 'so', 'quality', 'not', 'motion', 'picture', 'GREAT', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'tribute', 'Curtis', 'who', 'died', 'March', 'year']",N/A

One thing does puzzle me, and that is why no one has marketed Mr. Zuni, as they have done with Buzz Lightyear, GI Joe, or the ubiquitous Barbie and Ken.  Surely a screen icon like Zuni, with viewer recognition equal to that of King Kong, Robbie the Robot, or the good 'ol Creature From the Black Lagoon, would have no trouble holding his own in the marketplace. A foot high Robbie, with minute details, voice activation, and a remote control, can be had for a hefty sum. I would think that an enterprising model maker could duplicate the original Zuni in exact detail, add a voice chip with original soundtrack samples, and make a nice profit, retailing under 100 bucks.  I would certainly get one!Permit me to also mention the sequel to ""Trilogy"", with Lysette Anthony. She is perfect for the part, and the remake, is almost just as good as the original. Zuni is great, but his acting abilities and his disposition, haven't improved much.  The interesting thing about this film, is that it begins only a few hours after the original story concludes, but was made 25 odd years later.  Dan Curtis is a genius!!! It is fun to watch these films back to back, but.....even now, I bring the dogs in, and leave  some lights on....P.S. -- It is 9 years after the above comments, and,,, Mr. Zuni is now available right here on Amazon for 60 bucks~!~!~!Awwwrightty~!~!~!I will put him on the shelf next to Stripe from Gremlins, and see how they get along together~!~!~!;-)",5,"It's all been done,,,before...

For those of us who were kids back then, we had maybe five or six choices on television.From other reviews of this film, there were lots of us who were glued to the television for this ""teleplay"" starring Karen Black.  It must have had some great promotion commercials...either that or we just didn't have anything else to do.Designed as a trilogy, the film's first two stories are tedious bits of regurgitated storytelling.  I won't bother reviewing them. It is the third and final story - Amelia - that is frightening as it can be - at least to a child (now remember, we didn't have all these gory and scary movies available to us - the VCR wouldn't be produced for several more years) that broke ground not ever covered before.  It was the third story that scared me to death!When you watch this film - and you really should watch all three stories, if for no other reason than to see how they originally played out - do so remembering how the world was when it was originally made.  We were a bit more innocent and we didn't have all the special effects available to us.

We all remember this tv-movie when we first saw it on the ABC Network back in 1975 or our parents would not let us see it. They told us to go to bed. But, I bet our parents watched it.All three stories star Karen Black in four different roles. The first story is titled, ""Julie"". This story is only 25 minutes long. A student has naughty thoughts about his teacher. He has leered at her sitting on the desk and has committed voueyerism by watching her though the window of her home. The teacher never goes out anymore. She prefers to stay home. One day, the student asks her to go to the drive-in with him. She does to watch the scary movie. He offers to get some refreshments. When he does, he spikes her drink. You'll have to watch the rest to find out what happens. Gregory Harrison has a small part.Story #2 is titled, ""Millicent And Therese"". This story is 20 minutes long. A spinster woman believes her sister killed mother and is guided by Satan. This is the story she tells her sister's boyfriend, played by John Karlin (original Dark Shadows, ABC serial),but he does not believe one word of it. What more will this woman say or do to get people to pay attention to what she says her sister is and does? She continues to write further in her diary.Story #3 is titled, ""Amelia"". This story is 17 minutes long. This is the story we all remember in the tv commercials and we were so horrified to watch it. It was suspensful. Now that we are more mature, we would probably laugh at it. This one too stars Karen Black. A woman brings home a strange African Fetish Doll holding a sharp spear. The doll has a spirit that makes it come to life. If the chain around his ribs should break, he will come to life. Well, it does. Now in her bathrobe just before she takes a bath, she notices the doll is not on the table, she finds it under the couch, but is stabbed. She hears it running around, but she can not find it again.

508387,A366S12KCZ280V,B00000JXVQ,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 1]","This is a great little made for TV horror film from the 1970's. It ranks right up there with other made for TV movies like ""The Night Stalker"" starring Darin McGavin and ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" starring Kim Darby as among the best. As the title suggests this is three short stories of terror in one made for TV movie. Karen Black is the star of the movie and appears in all three stories. The first two stories are good though nothing really great. Good suspense to the stories but nothing that will make you jump out of your skin but will still hold your attention. The third story however is where all the horror is located. That one will make you want to keep the lights on at night and jump at the slightest sound you hear. It is the one with the Zuni warrior doll that comes to life and is blood thirsty to kill.  All I will say about the Zuni doll that appears in the third segment is that it makes Chucky (from ""Child's Play"" movies) look like a wimp.Karen Black does an excellent job acting in all three segments. She seemed like the perfect choice to star in this movie. Karen Black I always thought was a great actress who was a bit underrated by many despite appearing in some great films, ""Five Easy Pieces"", ""Easy Rider"" and ""Nashville"" among others. The writing also helps to make this an enjoyable film to watch thanks to co-writers Richard Matheson (one of the best sci-fi writers of all time) and William F. Nolan.This is a film I can recommend to anyone. For those my age this will be a nice nostalgic movie from the past. For those who have not seen this or may not of even heard of ""Trilogy Of Terror"" before but are horror fans will enjoy this little made for TV movie. It is good fun and even the whole family can sit down together and watch though if you have very young children you might want to skip having them see the third story.

Hoyos,"[1, 1]","Dan Curtis, brain child behind such 70's telehorror hits as ""Night Stalker,"" ""The Norliss Tapes,"" and ""Dark Shadows,"" scores another success with ""Trilogy of Terror.""  This anthology showcased Karen Black's versatility as a superb actress.  She portrays four different women in three tales of terror.  These women range from plain and conservative to wild and sensuous.  The three tales are all based on short stories written by Richard Matheson, the best-selling author of I Am Legend, which spawned three theatrical versions; the last one starred Will Smith.Supernatural deception is the theme in ""Julie.""  A handsome, young college student decides to blackmail his English professor, Julie, into dating him.  Naturally, there are deadly consequences.  This tale has a nice downbeat ending that is rather shocking.Identical twins hate each other in ""Millicent and Therese.""  Initially, it appears that one twin is good and the other is evil.  However, when the good one begins plotting to kill her sister, it becomes obvious that both are evil.  The ending was very predictable; I saw it a mile away.  This is my least favorite tale.""Amelia"" is emotionally abused.  She can't date a man on his birthday without feeling guilty about cancelling an evening with her overbearing mom even though they see each other three times a week.  She buys a Zuni fetish doll as a gift for her boyfriend.  When the chain around its body falls off, the spirit inhabiting the doll is freed.  The doll comes to life and is relentless in attacking poor Amelia.  This was the best of the three stories and clearly influenced future horror films such as ""Stephen King's Cat`s Eye,"" ""Chucky,"" and ""Tales from the Hood.""Karen Black (Rob Zombie's ""House of 1000 Corpses"") gave excellent performances in all three stories; it isn't surprising why Dan Curtis requested her to be a part of his next theatrical film ""Burnt Offerings"" - a film centered around a secluded country manor that demands human sacrifices in order to be rejuvenated.  It was nice to see former stars of ""Dark Shadows"" such as John Karlen and James Storm.  Look for Gregory Harrison in a cameo appearance.""Trilogy of Terror"" is a must see for fans of Dan Curtis.  Also, if you enjoy horror anthologies from the 70's such as ""The House That Dripped Blood,"" ""Torture Garden,"" and ""Asylum,"" then you must see this one.

This is three tales of terror all staring Karen Black. All three are very dull and have a cast of what seems like 2 or 3 people. The first tale has Karen Black as a college teacher that goes out on a date with a student that ends up blackmailing her. Yep. That's the terror. 30 minutes of it. The second tale is about a doctor that makes house calls to two sisters.... both played by Karen Black. Both have murderous intensions against each other. Then finally the third tale of terror is the only one that will not bore you to tears. This tale involves a long phone conversation from Karen Black to her mother that you can't hear... followed by her struggle for survival with a murderous doll. Good stuff if you don't laugh at the premise.Literally all three tales are Karen Black's acting with no help and it's not very good. When John Lithgow can be a man on a plane and make you believe that he sees a gremlin on the wing of the plane, that is acting. When Ryan Renolds can be in a box for 90 minutes, that is acting. Karen Black needed a lot of help to get these bad tales over. Help like actual terrifying things and not soap opera drama.

508392,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00000JXVQ,Jeffrey Leach,"[2, 2]","Alas, I was just a wee lad when ""Trilogy of Terror"" played on television back in 1975. I don't think my parents would have let me up stay up watch it anyway, as they would have deemed the word ""terror"" in the title as potentially damaging to my young psyche. Lots of people did watch this Dan Curtis production starring horror mainstay Karen Black, and they still seem to remember the third entry in the trilogy. Well, when I got old enough to watch lots of horror movies without worrying about my frail psyche, I kept hearing comments about this television program. When the DVD revolution opened fire a few years ago, I knew it was only a matter of time before I would finally sit down and see what so many people feared. I'm a Karen Black fan from a long time back, too, so watching this one falls under ""required viewing."" I have to say that for the most part, ""Trilogy of Terror"" is a trilogy of abject dullness. Black plays the lead in all three stories, stories culled from the mighty Richard Matheson catalogue, and only one delivers anything in the way of real shocks. But those shocks will stay with you long after the program ends.I'll just lump the first two stories together in this paragraph since neither one really stands out. In the first tale, called ""Julie,"" Black plays the titular character, a dowdy looking college literature professor. One day Julie stumbles across campus on her way to work when one of her students, the studly Chad (Robert Burton), notices her and makes a suggestive comment to his pal Eddie (James Storm). Eddie is aghast that anyone he knows could find such a dour older woman attractive, but Chad's comment soon turns into an obsession. He must simply find out whether he can get a date with her, which he soon does. Chad does something quite despicable that evening, but he'll soon find out that tables can turn with deadly consequences. The second story, ""Millicent and Therese,"" sees Black doing double duty in a tale about two sisters. One of the sisters is uptight and ugly, while the other is a vivacious firecracker accustomed to hitting on the guys. The twist here, to cut to the chase, is that everything isn't as it seems. When one of the sisters dies in an upstairs bedroom, we find out the real truth about these two siblings thanks to their physician. It's your typical twist ending that isn't all that surprising, actually. Be sure and look for George Gaynes as the doctor and a young Gregory Harrison as one of Julia's students.Now we can talk about ""Amelia,"" the final entry in the trilogy. Amelia lives alone in a high-rise apartment building in the city. She's a lonely woman due to the influence of her overbearing mother, but she's finally landed herself a boyfriend that she wants to see this very night. Her mother, who doesn't live with her by the way, doesn't like the idea of her daughter going out on a night when the two usually spend time together. Amelia whines about it being her boyfriend's birthday, tells her mother about the little Zuni fetish doll she bought for him, and the conversation ends in an impasse that insures Amelia feels guilty enough to postpone her date. Unfortunately for Amelia, a necklace hanging around the doll's neck--which supposedly keeps the spirit within safely bottled up--falls off when she puts the fetish down on the coffee table. Sure enough, the little doll comes to life and systematically stalks Amelia throughout the apartment. Screaming in terror for her life and becoming increasingly bloodied in the confrontations with the doll, Amelia thinks throwing the fetish in the oven will finally do the little monster in. The final scene of ""Amelia"" is definitely one of the creepiest shots in horror history, and it stays with you. That smile alone makes the DVD worth watching.The biggest drawback to this television movie centers on its television production values and the writing. There really isn't anything we can do about that first problem--television almost always looks like television, and you just have to learn to live with the restrictions inherent in that medium. Fortunately, the stories work around a limited budget relatively well. Black's performances also help; she assumes a wide range of personas in the three stories and pulls them off with panache. She shrieks as well if not better than many of the big screen scream queens. I guess the writing difficulties, or I should say the screenplay adaptations of Matheson's stories, apply to the first two stories. I'm not surprised at all to learn that someone named William Nolan wrote ""Julia"" and ""Millicent and Therese."" He doesn't adapt the material well. I remember reading the ""Julia"" story in a Matheson collection, and in story form it worked. Here, it just comes off as confusing. The one piece of the trilogy that succeeds like gangbusters, ""Amelia,"" is the only one Matheson himself adapted for Curtis's production. Note to future filmmakers: always try to involve the original author in the screenplay. It almost always works better that way.I'm still going to give ""Trilogy of Terror"" a good review, though. Black's performances even in the lesser pieces are good to great, and ""Amelia"" alone is worth adding a star to the overall rating. Let's give a big round of applause to Anchor Bay for releasing this to DVD. The picture quality looks good for a '70s television program, and there's even a short text interview with Black included as an extra on the disc. Dan Curtis had great success with his ""Night Stalker"" films and the ""Dark Shadows"" television series, but it's likely he'll best be remembered for this program. By all means check it out if you get the chance.",4,"Oooh, that smile!",1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,5663,"['Alas', 'was', 'just', 'wee', 'lad', 'when', 'Trilogy', 'Terror', 'played', 'television',

Dan Curtis was a prolific TV director who presented many horror outings on television in the 70's but this is my favorite.

In the first, she's a prim college professor who's really a witch/succubus with a taste for turning the tables on amorous young men. The second has her as a spinster with a split personality---allowing her to play ""two"" roles. And the last is the now famous Zuni fetish doll story that has the doll coming to life and terrorizing her all over her apartment. She's a lonely career woman dominated by her mother and the ending has her possessed by the spirit of the doll waiting for mama to come over. A great ending. The movie is Black's show all the way.

508416,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00000JXVQ,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[5, 5]","Why anyone would consider Trilogy of Terror 'scary' is beyond me. If anything, the film should be looked upon as a light, hilarious comedy, especially with its final segment. It's these last thirty minutes that make the film so worthwhile.The first two stories in the anthology are slow, but certainly interesting. The plot twists are obvious in a good way, and the wonderful Karen Black is superb as always.However, it is the infamous Zuni doll from the segment titled ""Amelia"" that makes the film so special and puts it in the made-for-TV hall of fame. While most certainly intimidating and freaky, the doll is no doubt hilarious as he chases a screaming Ms. Black around her apartment with a butcher knife more than twice his size. This manages to produce chills as well as belly laughs gallore. It's a must for every horror fan, a chilling experience that manages to frighten, entertain, and make you laugh.

As suspense/horror/mystery fans, we had seen almost all the classic and features from the kitchy ""Wood"" movies and Hammer horrors to the slasher films that were reaching a fever pitch about then.  But of all the movies we had seen up to that date, nothing scared us two teenage fans to the point that we stood on our respective sofas, afraid to put our feet down. Before Ms. Black got to the sofa, we had run into my mother's room screaming ""Ma! You gotta see this!!"" pulling her out of bed.  All three of us were standing on one couch, laughing and screaming.  It was the best scare of our lives to that point. The two preceeding features were so wonderfully and intererestingly written, but the screenwriter was a master of so many favorites of ours at that time.

Curtis had a long history with gothic and horrific storytelling on the small screen. In 1975, he filmed this television movie, which still resonates with people who saw it more than 30 years ago as children. Like many of the horror films presented on television in the 70's (""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"" comes to mind), ""Trilogy of Terror"" delivers suspense and subtle bits of violence that never becomes too bloody. The terror in this trilogy really occurs in the third story, all of which star Karen Black (Burnt Offerings, Invaders from Mars). Karen's solo fight against a Zuni warrior doll predates anything ""chucky"" accomplished. The idea of a spirit invading a doll is nothing new, but Curtis's treatment is enormously entertaining because of the doll's relentlessness. Also, I must say, I found myself laughing outloud during most of the assault--perhaps a bit of dark humor has invaded my own spirit. Regardless of whether you have a similar reaction, you'll most likely never forget our Zuni friend sawing his way out of a suitcase with a steak knife. And poor Amelia, (Black's character) trying to grab the jutting blade with her fingertips is enough to make you want to throw something at the screen--when you stop laughing, that is. The other two stories in this trilogy are somewhat engaging, but I think you'll agree that the Zuni fetish is a fitting finish to this fun flick.",4,Zuni Fetish Anyone?,1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,1500,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Zuni', 'fetish', 'obviously', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'viewed', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'Trilogy', 'Terror', 'Curtis', 'had', 'long', 'history', 'gothic', 'horrific', 'storytelling', 'small', 'screen', '1975', 'filmed', 'television', 'movie', 'still', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'more', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'children', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'presented', 'television', '70', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'mind', 'Trilogy', 'Terror', 'delivers', 'suspense', 'subtle', 'bits', 'violence', 'never', 'too', 'bloody', 'terror', 'trilogy', 'really', 'third', 'story', 'star', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Burnt', 'Offerings', 'Invaders', 'Mars', 'Karen', 'solo', 'fight', 'Zuni', 'warrior', 'doll', 'anything', 'chucky', 'accomplished', 'idea', 'spirit', 'invading', 'doll', 'nothing', 'new', 'Curtis', 'treatment', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'doll', 'relentlessness', 'Also', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'laughing', 'outloud', 'most', 'assault', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'dark', 'humor', 'invaded', 'own', 'spirit', 'Regardless', 'have', 'similar', 'reaction', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'never', 'forget', 'Zuni', 'friend', 'sawing', 'way', 'suitcase', 'steak', 'knife', 'poor', 'Amelia', 'Black', 'character', 'trying', 'grab', 'jutting', 'blade', 'fingertips', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'throw', 'something', 'screen', 'when', 'stop', 'laughing', 'other', 'two', 'stories', 'trilogy', 'are', 'somewhat', 'engaging', 'think', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'Zuni', 'fetish', 'fitting', 'finish', 'fun', 'flick']",N/A
508421,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B00000JXVQ,Michael R Gates,"[76, 78]","This very good three-part 1970s-era TV movie is a veritable cornucopia of talent.  Based on stories by well-known genre author Richard Matheson and directed by Dan Curtis of DARK SHADOWS fame, this film boasts Karen Black (EASY RIDER; FIVE EASY PIECES; THE GREAT GATSBY) in four separate roles, with two teleplays scripted by William F. Nolan (co-author of the famous novel LOGAN'S RUN) and one--the best of the lot--scripted by Matheson.  Also appearing in supporting roles are well-known actors George Gaynes and Gregory Harrison.Story one, &quot;Julie,&quot; is an intentionally ambiguous witchcraft tale in which Black portrays a bookish college professor who isn't quite what she seems.  The story contains some very subtle rape and S&amp;M innuendo, and there is a fun little twist to the ending.  &quot;Millicent and Therese,&quot; the second offering, is the weakest of the lot.  Although Black does a fine job in the dual role of bickering &quot;sisters,&quot; the audience can see the ending coming from miles away.  The final and strongest of the three stories, &quot;Amelia,&quot; is based on Matheson's famous short-story &quot;Prey&quot; about a voodoo fetish doll that comes to life and hunts down a woman in her midtown apartment. The ending to this one is very creepy.All in all, TRILOGY OF TERROR is a worthy little horror flick.  Though it is a TV movie &aacute; la 1975 and therefore suffers from some of the low-budget production qualities common to such, it certainly offers some fun moments of dark humor and a few genuine scares.

508439,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B00000JXVQ,Silver Screen Videos,"[2, 2]","During the 1970s, the TV Movie of the Week was a network staple at ABC, and a number of those films are well remembered today, including Trilogy of Terror, a horror anthology that showcased three talented artists, writer Richard Matheson, director Dan Curtis, and star Karen Black. Getting Black to star in a TV movie was quite a coup at the time, since she was one of the most in-demand big screen actresses of the day.The film features dramatizations of three stories by Richard Matheson (although he didn't write the teleplay), each starring Black. Frankly, the first two stories are decent, but hardly memorable. However, I would venture that no one who has ever seen the last segment of the film will ever forget it. In fact, this role is the one Black said more people asked her about than any other film she made. The title is &#34;Amelia&#34; but most people remember it as the &#34;Devil Doll&#34; story. Black receives a birthday present of a six-inch Zuni fetish doll that soon comes to life, armed with a tiny but quite sharp spear, and spends the rest of the episode chasing and trying to kill Black.There's a fine edge in movies like this between silliness and genuine suspense, but this one holds up quite well. The effects are fairly decent considering that this was a TV movie with 1970s FX puppet technology. It's genuinely creepy, with a couple of good gotcha moments as Curtis ratchets up the suspense, and Black plays the role absolutely straight.The DVD has some nice bonus extras as well, including an audio commentary by Black. If all three episodes were the quality of the last one, this would have been one of the best TV movies of all time. As it is, it's still a nifty thrill ride that can be experienced in under ninety minutes (under 30 if you fast forward to the last episode).",4,The Devil Doll is Still a Killer of a Story,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,1808,"['1970s', 'TV', 'Movie', 'Week', 'was', 'network', 'staple', 'ABC', 'number', 'films', 'are', 'well', 'remembered', 'today', 'including', 'Trilogy', 'Terror', 'horror', 'anthology', 'showcased', 'three', 'talented', 'artists', 'writer', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'director', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'star', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Getting', 'Black', 'star', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'coup', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'in-demand', 'big', 'screen', 'actresses', 'day.The', 'film', 'features', 'dramatizations', 'three', 'stories', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'teleplay', 'starring', 'Black', 'Frankly', 'first', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'decent', 'hardly', 'memorable', 'However', 'would', 'venture', 'one', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'last', 'segment', 'film', 'will', 'ever', 'forget', 'fact', 'role', 'one', 'Black', 'said', 'more', 'people', 'asked', 'other', 'film', 'made', 'title', '34', 'Amelia', '34', 'most', 'people', 'remember', '34', 'Devil', 'Doll', '34', 'story', 'Black', 'birthday', 'present', 'six-inch', 'Zuni', 'fetish', 'doll', 'soon', 'life', 'armed', 'tiny', 'quite', 'sharp', 'spear', 'rest', 'episode', 'chasing', 'trying', 'kill', 'Black.There', 'fine', 'edge', 'movies', 'silliness', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'one', 'quite', 'well', 'effects', 'are', 'fairly', 'decent', 'considering', 'was', 'TV', 'movie', '1970s', 'FX', 'puppet', 'technology', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'couple', 'good', 'gotcha', 'moments', 'Curtis', 'up', 'suspense', 'Black', 'role', 'absolutely', 'straight.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'bonus', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Black', 'three', 'episodes', 'were', 'quality', 'last', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'movies', 'time', 'still', 'nifty', 'thrill', 'ride', 'can', 'be', 'experienced', 'ninety', 'minutes', '30', 'fast', 'forward', 'last', 'episode']",N/A

The last story, Amelia, is legendary.  This movie was a tour-de-force for Karen Black who has never been given the credit she deserves as an actress.  Just check her out inFive Easy Pieces,Airport 1975andBurnt Offerings.  Like this film and her others, she has aged well.  I hated Rob Zombie'sHouse of 1,000 Corpses, but it was great to see Black again and she still looks radiant.  Her looks are a little odd at times (a little cross-eyed, and weird expressions), which are perfect for horror films, but she is undeniably beautiful too, even today.I can't add anything more to the discussion here than the other reviewers have said already themselves.  This is a small classic that has well-earned it reputation as a creepy horror film worth owning.

508446,A1RRPBF14VTAUE,B00000JXVQ,Tucker,"[7, 8]","I was 12 years old when this ""made for television"" movie first aired.The only part of the movie I actually had any recollection of was, of course, the little Zuni devil doll running across the floor. That was enough for it to remain in my memory as being a very scary movie. When I saw that it was available on DVD, I bought it, hoping to bring back some old childhood memories. What a difference 27 years make.As the title implies, the film is composed of three short (unrelated) stories, although only the last one can really lay claim to having any sort of terror in it. Karen Black stars in all three stories, in addition to playing a dual role in the second tale. The first story, ""Julie"", casts Black as a dowdy, repressed college professor who is being blackmailed by one of her students. In the second story, ""Millicent and Terese"", Black plays both of the title roles, two sisters at opposite ends of the personality spectrum. Millicent is a prudish spinster who despises her loose and immoral sister Terese. Believing there is no hope for Terese's salvation, Millicent attempts to rescue Terese's current flame from the road to damnation. The third and most famous of the three tales is ""Amelia"" in which Black plays a woman terrorized by a Zuni devil doll which is brought to life after the chain around it's neck accidentally falls off.The first story works well enough for what it is. Although not terribly original (but then again, maybe in 1975 it was.) it holds the viewers interest, even if it isn't an ""edge of your seat"" thriller. The two leads provide some solid acting. Most viewers, however, will most likely figure out the ending long before it plays out.The second story is the weakest of the three. Its primary purpose seems to be soley to give Black two different roles to play. This one also contains Black's weakest performance(s). With absolutely no subtlety whatsoever, Black plays each character's cliched personality to the hilt, slamming the viewer over the head with the utter piousness of Millicent and the total taudriness of Terese. This story's conclusion is more obvious to the audience than the first one.It is the last story that makes this DVD worth buying, but for a totally different reason than what I had origionally thought. The 12 year old in me remembers this story as being very scary. Horrifying even. Watching it now, I howl with laughter. This is such a great campy story. Watching that doll running around the apartment, grunting, and chomping on any body part he can get a hold of is a hoot. Black even does the obligatory ""trip and fall"" (THREE TIMES no less). Watching the little bugger saw his way out of a suitcase is classic. You almost root for the little guy. The story's conclusion is done rather well though, and does still provide a little bit of a chill as well.The visuals of the DVD are very good as is the sound. There is even a printed interview with Ms. Black (done in ""98"") about the movie. I suspect this DVD's appeal primarily lies with those of us who remember seeing it when it origionally aired on television, but for those of you who love camp, get the DVD and check out what's behind curtain number three.",3,New Outlook on an Old Movie,1032912000,"09 25, 2002",2002,3184,"['was', '12', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'first', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'recollection', 'was', 'course', 'little', 'Zuni', 'devil', 'doll', 'running', 'floor', 'was', 'enough', 'remain', 'memory', 'being', 'very', 'scary', 'movie', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'bought', 'hoping', 'bring', 'back', 'old', 'childhood', 'memories', 'What', 'difference', '27', 'years', 'make.As', 'title', 'implies', 'film', 'composed', 'three', 'short', 'unrelated', 'stories', 'only', 'last', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'lay', 'claim', 'having', 'sort', 'terror', 'Karen', 'Black', 'stars', 'three', 'stories', 'addition', 'playing', 'dual', 'role', 'second', 'tale', 'first', 'story', 'Julie', 'Black', 'dowdy', 'repressed', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'one', 'students', 'second', 'story', 'Millicent', 'Terese', 'Black', 'title', 'roles', 'two', 'sisters', 'opposite', 'ends', 'personality', 'spectrum', 'Millicent', 'prudish', 'spinster', 'who', 'loose', 'immoral', 'sister', 'Terese', 'Believing', 'hope', 'Terese', 'salvation', 'Millicent', 'rescue', 'Terese', 'current', 'flame', 'road', 'damnation', 'third', 'most', 'famous', 'three', 'tales', 'Amelia', 'Black', 'woman', 'terrorized', 'Zuni', 'devil', 'doll', 'brought', 'life', 'chain', 'accidentally', 'off.The', 'first', 'story', 'well', 'enough', 'what', 'not', 'terribly', 'original', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', '1975', 'was', 'viewers', 'interest', 'even', ""n't"", 'edge', 'seat', 'thriller', 'two', 'leads', 'provide', 'solid', 'acting', 'Most', 'viewers', 'however', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'figure', 'out', 'ending', 'long', 'out.The', 'second', 'story', 'weakest', 'three', 'primary', 'purpose', 'be', 'soley', 'give', 'Black', 'two', 'different', 'roles', 'play', 'one', 'also', 'Black', 'weakest', 'performance', 's', 'absolutely', 'subtlety', 'whatsoever', 'Black', 'character', 'cliched', 'personality', 'hilt', 'slamming', 'viewer', 'head', 'utter', 'piousness', 'Millicent', 'total', 'taudriness', 'Terese', 'story', 'conclusion', 'more', 'obvious', 'audience', 'first', 'one.It', 'last', 'story', 'DVD', 'worth', 'buying', 'totally', 'different', 'reason', 'what', 'had', 'origionally', 'thought', '12', 'year', 'old', 'remembers', 'story', 'being', 'very', 'scary', 'Horrifying', 'even', 'Watching', 'now', 'howl', 'laughter', 'such', 'great', 'campy', 'story', 'Watching', 'doll', 'running', 'apartment', 'grunting', 'chomping', 'body', 'part', 'can', 'get', 'hold', 'hoot', 'Black', 'even', 'obligatory', 'trip', 'fall', 'THREE', 'TIMES', 'no', 'less', 'Watching', 'little', 'bugger', 'saw', 'way', 'suitcase', 'classic', 'almost', 'root', 'little', 'guy', 'story', 'conclusion', 'done', 'rather', 'well', 'still', 'provide', 'little', 'bit', 'chill', 'well.The', 'visuals', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'even', 'printed', 'interview', 'Ms.', 'Black', 'done', '98', 'movie', 'suspect', 'DVD', 'appeal', 'primarily', 'who', 'remember', 'seeing', 'when', 'origionally', 'aired', 'television', 'who', 'love', 'camp', 'get', 'DVD', 'check', 'out', 'what', 'behind', 'curtain', 'number', 'three']",N/A

The second story contains a surprise as well, and even though it's something you might see coming, it's still a treat to watch Black sink her teeth into the performance.
