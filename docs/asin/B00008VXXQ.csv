A man whose sister had run off to American years ago finds out she has died and her son is coming to visit the only family he has left. Pierce Brosnan is the sister's left-behind lover and although not one of the central characters, he gives a memorial performance. There is a racial element in the movie which only heightens the drama but primarily the film focuses on hard hearts coming to love again.",4,Unusual Family Drama,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,540,"['film', 'vivid', 'depiction', 'life', 'Ireland', 'long-term', 'affections', 'alienations', 'can', 'form', 'rural', 'isolated', 'area', 'man', 'sister', 'had', 'run', 'off', 'American', 'years', 'ago', 'out', 'died', 'son', 'coming', 'visit', 'only', 'family', 'left', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'sister', 'left-behind', 'lover', 'not', 'one', 'central', 'characters', 'memorial', 'performance', 'racial', 'element', 'movie', 'only', 'drama', 'primarily', 'film', 'hard', 'hearts', 'coming', 'love', 'again']",N/A

It would be easy for this film to use the idea of a young black man coming to Ireland and the sort of upheval that might bring, but instead the film focuses on the tortured family history of the characters.  In fact, the color of the newphew's skin is barely mentioned (twice I think).  Hill Harper as the nephew, Chad, and Donal McCann as his uncle Tony shine in this film.  Their performances are dramatic, tortured, and heart-wrenching at times.  The rest of the all Irish cast, including Pierce Brosnan, are wonderful, as well.

Sadly, the obsessive use of religious exclamations (Jesus' name was used about 9 times) spoiled this movie for me. It's too bad the screen writer decided to do this, because it took away from a very gripping storyline.  The other more mild swearing was kept to a minimum.Donal McCann stars as Tony who receives a letter from his sister on her death bed, asking him to take care of her son.  When Chad, played by the handsome Hill Harper, arrives, everyone is surprised that he has dark skin.  People in the Irish town welcome Chad into their community somewhat hesitantly, but they soon realize he is his ""mother's son"".  Chad develops a romantic friendship with the daughter of his mother's past sweetheart, played by Pierce Brosnan, which causes tension between all the characters involved. Things are not helped any when Chad, who is a talented artist, draws a picture of his Love as how he imagined she would look in the nude.  Relationships will not be healed and the heart of the problems resolved, until the many secrets, including those Tony has of his own, are brought to light.Hill Harper does an outstanding acting job and he has a pretty good singing voice as well.

The story is set in a tourist-board-pretty Irish cove.  Into this small community a young coloured American boy comes `home'.. his mother left Ireland before he was born.  Now she has passed away and he comes to stay with his uncle.  All is not well however, as his return brings to the surface buried past stories and tensions mount, and his blossoming romance with Aislan, the young red-haired beauty of the island makes confrontation unavoidable.It is fairly lightweight, but never frivolous in tone.  Brosnan's role is not central - indeed it is Hill Harper as the young American who impresses, staying somehow remarkably gentle and neutral while never being a pushover, and Aislan McGuckin certainly makes his falling in love perfectly believable.  It's this romance being as believable as it is, with such unforced chemistry, that helps the films succeed at its core, helping to offset the somewhat less credible backstory that unravels as the film progresses.  On the fringes, what makes it more memorable are the throwaway moments we see in the background.  Two nun's fly fishing, the postman cycling his rounds, the awkwardness of the attempts to bring some modern touch to the church service.. these all help give the character needed to avoid becoming a tourist fluff piece.  And it succeeds for the most part.Combine this gentle melodrama with the achingly beautiful Irish scenery, and an eclectic soundtrack with everything from Thin Lizzy to Elton John, via several beautiful Irish ballads, and this gets a thumbs up from me for a quiet night in.",4,Manages to be sweet without being twee,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,1682,"['Maybe', 'caught', 'right', 'mood', 'something', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'charmed', 'gentle', 'Irish', 'melodrama', 'story', 'set', 'tourist-board-pretty', 'Irish', 'cove', 'small', 'community', 'young', 'coloured', 'American', 'boy', ""home'.."", 'mother', 'left', 'Ireland', 'was', 'born', 'Now', 'passed', 'away', 'stay', 'uncle', 'not', 'well', 'however', 'return', 'surface', 'buried', 'past', 'stories', 'tensions', 'mount', 'blossoming', 'romance', 'Aislan', 'young', 'red-haired', 'beauty', 'island', 'confrontation', 'unavoidable.It', 'fairly', 'lightweight', 'never', 'frivolous', 'tone', 'Brosnan', 'role', 'not', 'central', 'indeed', 'Hill', 'Harper', 'young', 'American', 'who', 'staying', 'somehow', 'remarkably', 'gentle', 'neutral', 'while', 'never', 'being', 'pushover', 'Aislan', 'McGuckin', 'certainly', 'falling', 'love', 'perfectly', 'believable', 'romance', 'being', 'as', 'believable', 'such', 'unforced', 'chemistry', 'films', 'succeed', 'core', 'helping', 'offset', 'somewhat', 'less', 'credible', 'backstory', 'film', 'fringes', 'what', 'more', 'memorable', 'are', 'throwaway', 'moments', 'see', 'background', 'Two', 'nun', 'fly', 'fishing', 'postman', 'cycling', 'rounds', 'awkwardness', 'attempts', 'bring', 'modern', 'touch', 'church', 'help', 'give', 'character', 'needed', 'avoid', 'becoming', 'tourist', 'fluff', 'piece', 'most', 'part.Combine', 'gentle', 'melodrama', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'Irish', 'scenery', 'eclectic', 'soundtrack', 'everything', 'Thin', 'Lizzy', 'Elton', 'John', 'several', 'beautiful', 'Irish', 'ballads', 'thumbs', 'up', 'quiet', 'night']",N/A
