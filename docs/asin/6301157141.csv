It is about 3 bachelor friends, Jack, Peter and Michael sharing an apartment in New York, the character named Jack is a womanizer who sleeps around a lot and a baby girl namd Mary is left on the doorstep with a note from her mother Sylvia saying that Jack is the father and all three men who know absolutely nothing about babies have to take care of her. It is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it, it's the American version of the French film Three Men and a Cradle which is also wonderful and I highly recommend that too, in that movie the guys are named Jacques, Pierre, and Michel, the baby is named Marie and the mother is named Sylvia, I saw that film both in French with English subtitles and Dubbed into English but I preferred it in it's original French with the English subtitles.",5,"Wonderful, but also see the French film!",1011225600,"01 17, 2002",2002,899,"['Three', 'Men', 'Baby', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'liked', 'lot', 'thought', 'actors', 'were', 'great', '3', 'bachelor', 'friends', 'Jack', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'sharing', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'character', 'named', 'Jack', 'womanizer', 'who', 'lot', 'baby', 'girl', 'namd', 'Mary', 'left', 'doorstep', 'note', 'mother', 'Sylvia', 'saying', 'Jack', 'father', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'babies', 'have', 'take', 'care', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'American', 'version', 'French', 'film', 'Three', 'Men', 'Cradle', 'also', 'wonderful', 'highly', 'recommend', 'too', 'movie', 'guys', 'are', 'named', 'Jacques', 'Pierre', 'Michel', 'baby', 'named', 'Marie', 'mother', 'named', 'Sylvia', 'saw', 'film', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Dubbed', 'English', 'preferred', 'original', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles']",N/A

Just the previous year,Guttenberg filmed &quot;Police Academy 4:Citizens On Patrol&quot;,his last sequel. BAD BOY,performed by Gloria Estefan &amp; the Miami Sound Machine,is played during the opening credits. The babysitting starts one Sunday morning when Peter Mitchell(Selleck) returns from a jog to his apartment and finds a baby in a bassinet on the floor near the door. He calls his roommate Michael Kellam(Guttenberg),so he could take a look at the beautiful baby girl. Near her is a note from her mother written to the baby's father Jack Holden(Danson). Jack lives with Peter and Michael. Peter goes to the supermarket in his workout apparel to buy some baby food and diapers since the trio had none of their own. So Michael entertains Mary,the baby. After Jack,who's an actor,returns home from Turkey after filming a TV movie,he is strangled by Peter and Michael,mistaking him for a burglar. They are pissed at him for putting them through hell with the baby. Peter tells Jack,&quot;We(himself and Michael) put our lives on hold taking care of this kid and now it's your turn.&quot; In another scene where Peter and Michael are shooting pool,Jack is having difficulty changing Mary's diaper(&quot;How do you put on these goddamn things anyway?&quot;).&quot;Figure it out for yourself,d---head!&quot;,Peter answers. Things get back to normal when Mary's mother Sylvia(Nancy Travis) shows up at the trio's apartment to reclaim Mary. Sylvia planned to catch a flight to London,taking Mary with her. That didn't happen,realizing Sylvia would have been sorry eventually. So she returns to the trio's apartment. The trio themselves return to the apartment after they rode a cab to the airport from where Sylvia and Mary were gonna take off. The trio thought Sylvia and Mary had. Sylvia,who's an actress,complains to the trio that her hectic work schedule makes her not care enough for Mary. Peter,who's an architect,told Sylvia that he'd build one or two rooms for Sylvia and Mary,inviting them to the household. Jack told Peter and Michael in an earlier scene that Jack and Sylvia met while acting in a play. In the last scene,Peter,Jack,Sylvia and Michael are all pushing Mary in her stroller,with a long handlebar,accomodating four pairs of hands! This movie was released November 25,1987 and became a #1 blockbuster and remained in many theatres for 4 or 5 months. The success of this film spawned a sequel 3 years later entitled &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot;.",5,A baby lover's must,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,2690,"['1987', 'when', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'were', 'annual', 'hiatus', 'respective', 'television', 'shows', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'Cheers', 'filmed', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'lovely', 'comedy', 'sudden', 'reluctant', 'babysitting', 'Just', 'previous', 'year', 'Guttenberg', 'filmed', 'quot', 'Police', 'Academy', '4', 'Citizens', 'Patrol', 'quot', 'last', 'sequel', 'BAD', 'BOY', 'performed', 'Gloria', 'Estefan', 'amp', 'Miami', 'Sound', 'Machine', 'played', 'opening', 'credits', 'babysitting', 'one', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'when', 'Peter', 'Mitchell', 'Selleck', 'jog', 'apartment', 'baby', 'bassinet', 'floor', 'door', 'roommate', 'Michael', 'Kellam', 'Guttenberg', 'could', 'take', 'look', 'beautiful', 'baby', 'girl', 'note', 'mother', 'written', 'baby', 'father', 'Jack', 'Holden', 'Danson', 'Jack', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'Peter', 'supermarket', 'workout', 'apparel', 'buy', 'baby', 'food', 'diapers', 'trio', 'had', 'none', 'own', 'Michael', 'Mary', 'baby', 'Jack', 'who', 'actor', 'home', 'Turkey', 'filming', 'TV', 'movie', 'strangled', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'mistaking', 'burglar', 'are', 'pissed', 'putting', 'hell', 'baby', 'Peter', 'Jack', 'quot', 'Michael', 'put', 'lives', 'hold', 'taking', 'care', 'kid', 'now', 'turn.', 'quot', 'scene', 'where', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'are', 'shooting', 'pool', 'Jack', 'having', 'difficulty', 'changing', 'Mary', 'diaper', 'quot', 'How', 'do', 'put', 'goddamn', 'things', 'anyway', 'quot', 'quot', 'Figure', 'out', 'd', '-head', 'quot', 'Peter', 'answers', 'Things', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'when', 'Mary', 'mother', 'Sylvia', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'up', 'trio', 'apartment', 'reclaim', 'Mary', 'Sylvia', 'planned', 'catch', 'flight', 'London', 'taking', 'Mary', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'realizing', 'Sylvia', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sorry', 'eventually', 'trio', 'apartment', 'trio', 'return', 'apartment', 'rode', 'cab', 'airport', 'where', 'Sylvia', 'Mary', 'were', 'gon', 'na', 'take', 'off', 'trio', 'thought', 'Sylvia', 'Mary', 'had', 'Sylvia', 'who', 'actress', 'trio', 'hectic', 'work', 'schedule', 'not', 'care', 'enough', 'Mary', 'Peter', 'who', 'architect', 'told', 'Sylvia', ""'d"", 'build', 'one', 'two', 'rooms', 'Sylvia', 'Mary', 'inviting', 'household', 'Jack', 'told', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'earlier', 'scene', 'Jack', 'Sylvia', 'met', 'acting', 'play', 'last', 'scene', 'Peter', 'Jack', 'Sylvia', 'Michael', 'are', 'pushing', 'Mary', 'stroller', 'long', 'handlebar', 'accomodating', 'four', 'pairs', 'hands', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'November', '25,1987', 'became', '1', 'blockbuster', 'remained', 'many', 'theatres', '4', '5', 'months', 'success', 'film', 'spawned', 'sequel', '3', 'years', 'later', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Three', 'Men', 'Little', 'Lady', 'quot']",N/A

I learned, from an interview with Leonard Nimoy (the  movie's director), that the boy in the window is real -- but he's just the  son of a crew member who got into the shot accidentally.  Like many  faux-pas that end up in the finished product of a movie, this was a mistake  the editor didn't catch.  The shotgun is just a toy the boy had with him.

245810,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,6301157141,Derek,"[6, 7]","This movie came out in the late 80s and I have never seen it. I've seen the sequel,Three Men and a Little Lady, but never this one. So, being that there was nothing new I wanted to see and intrigued by the idea of Leanord Nimoy as a director, I watched the film.Honestly, I found the film to be quite entertaining and enjoyable to watch. You can't help but laugh at watching some of Hollywood's manly men (at least back then) deal with the daily routines and hardships of raising a baby, especially without a woman around to help. It's fun to watch blue-blooded Tom Selleck, high-spirited Steve Guttenberg, and cheerful Ted Danson attempt to apply their business-know-how to raising a child and then watch as they deal with the consequences.I did think it odd how they tried to interweave two very separate storylines into one plot and it was almost too much for one movie. You have the ""three men and a baby"" plot set alongside a ""three men caught in a drug smuggling plot""...plot. It was just weird mix. They did a good job overall in making it work, but it was still somewhat of a rough ride.**Spoiler-Alert**I just have to admit that the ending almost ruined the film for me. So a past fling drops her baby off at the apartment door with a note claiming that she just can't do it anymore. Then she returns near the end of the film and expects that she can just take the baby back as if nothing happened. And the the three men let her do it! After working so hard to take care of the baby, I would have called the mother out on her irresponsibility and shameful ""knock-and-run"" and then expected her to do a lot more to prove her love for the child and ability to properly care for it. But that's just me.**Spoiler-Alert End**Overall, this was an enjoyable film with a lot of humor and content. I recommend it. I also highly recommend the sequel, Three Men and a Little Lady.

The men have a strong case of gender-specific learned helplessness. They have no clue as to what to do. They cannot fasten a diaper properly. They have no idea how to use baby oil and baby powder. At one point, they use a turkey baster to rinse the skin of the soiled baby girl. When they finally attach the diaper, it turns out to be too big, and it slides right off. The feeding schedules and the infant cries completely mess up the schedules and sleeping times of the men. They soon are so exhausted that they cannot function properly at work.One woman who is asked to help tells the men that she has no innate skills in dealing with an infant just because she is a woman. The mother of the father of the baby girl also refuses to help, pointing out that her adult son must finally learn some responsibility for his actions. Other complications develop. Someone mistakenly ships a package of heroin to the apartment, and a narcotics cop comes and performs a search.In time, the father of the infant returns, and, after getting a lot of flak for taking off, he joins the other two men in become strongly attached to the baby girl. Then there are fireworks: A drug-dealing action overtakes the three hapless, innocent men, and the mother shows up to claim her baby...The ending is anticlimactic.The acting is good. The frequent use of foul language detracts from the film.",4,"Very Funny Account of a ""Tiny Package"" Challenging Three Bumbling Men",1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,1611,"['Three', 'swinging', 'men', 'share', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'birth', 'suddenly', 'baby', 'father', 'soon', 'off', 'leaving', 'two', 'remaining', 'men', 'take', 'care', 'baby.What', 'disaster', 'men', 'have', 'strong', 'case', 'gender-specific', 'learned', 'helplessness', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'fasten', 'diaper', 'properly', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'use', 'baby', 'oil', 'baby', 'powder', 'one', 'point', 'use', 'turkey', 'baster', 'rinse', 'skin', 'soiled', 'baby', 'girl', 'When', 'finally', 'attach', 'diaper', 'out', 'be', 'too', 'big', 'right', 'off', 'feeding', 'schedules', 'infant', 'cries', 'completely', 'mess', 'up', 'schedules', 'sleeping', 'times', 'men', 'soon', 'are', 'so', 'exhausted', 'can', 'not', 'function', 'properly', 'work.One', 'woman', 'who', 'asked', 'help', 'tells', 'men', 'innate', 'skills', 'dealing', 'infant', 'just', 'woman', 'mother', 'father', 'baby', 'girl', 'also', 'help', 'pointing', 'out', 'adult', 'son', 'must', 'finally', 'learn', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'Other', 'complications', 'develop', 'Someone', 'mistakenly', 'package', 'heroin', 'apartment', 'narcotics', 'cop', 'search.In', 'time', 'father', 'infant', 'returns', 'getting', 'lot', 'flak', 'taking', 'off', 'other', 'two', 'men', 'become', 'strongly', 'attached', 'baby', 'girl', 'Then', 'are', 'fireworks', 'drug-dealing', 'action', 'three', 'hapless', 'innocent', 'men', 'mother', 'up', 'claim', 'baby', 'ending', 'anticlimactic.The', 'acting', 'good', 'frequent', 'use', 'foul', 'language', 'detracts', 'film']",N/A

It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember it with tender and life-affirming pleasure. It is a lightweight, somewhat implausible Hollywood comedy with three impossibly well-off, handsome, and well-adjusted bachelors sharing a cavernous apartment (imagine the rent). But Selleck, Guttenburg, and Danson earn their laughs (although I found the latter just a bit stiff) and after cherubic baby Mary enters their lives, they earn our hearts.The movie really grabs you in its caring but firm embrace during the middle of the film after the drug dealers have tied up the babysitter, trashed the apartment looking for the heroin, and left the baby in a closet with threats to return. Selleck finds the baby and says, ""Nobody is going to hurt you, nobody is going to hurt you"".  If that scene doesn't make you emotional, then you have no heart.When Mary's mother Sylvia returns for the baby after abandoning her on the bachelors' doorstep, at first you want to condemn her. But when she tearfully explains to the trio why she did it, I think you forgive her. At the movie's end, you are also glad that Sylvia, Mary, and the guys are willing to form a unique nuclear family.""Three Men and a Baby"" demonstrates that the simple love of an adult for an infant is enough for a compelling story and will more than compensate for an awkwardly shoe-horned drug subplot and even Danson's (Mary's biological father's) negligence.There's a vital place on this planet for ""feel-good"" movies like ""Three Men and a Baby"".",4,"Everyone Loves ""..a Baby"" (and the ""Three Men"", too!)",1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,1584,"['**This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '**I', 'own', 'charming', 'film', 'VHS', 'tape', 'been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'remember', 'tender', 'life-affirming', 'pleasure', 'lightweight', 'somewhat', 'implausible', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'three', 'impossibly', 'well-off', 'handsome', 'well-adjusted', 'bachelors', 'sharing', 'cavernous', 'apartment', 'imagine', 'rent', 'Selleck', 'Guttenburg', 'Danson', 'earn', 'laughs', 'found', 'latter', 'just', 'bit', 'stiff', 'cherubic', 'baby', 'Mary', 'enters', 'lives', 'earn', 'hearts.The', 'movie', 'really', 'grabs', 'caring', 'firm', 'embrace', 'middle', 'film', 'drug', 'dealers', 'have', 'tied', 'up', 'babysitter', 'trashed', 'apartment', 'looking', 'heroin', 'left', 'baby', 'closet', 'threats', 'return', 'Selleck', 'baby', 'Nobody', 'going', 'hurt', 'nobody', 'going', 'hurt', 'scene', ""n't"", 'make', 'emotional', 'then', 'have', 'heart.When', 'Mary', 'mother', 'Sylvia', 'baby', 'abandoning', 'bachelors', 'doorstep', 'first', 'want', 'condemn', 'when', 'tearfully', 'trio', 'why', 'did', 'think', 'forgive', 'movie', 'end', 'are', 'also', 'glad', 'Sylvia', 'Mary', 'guys', 'are', 'willing', 'form', 'unique', 'nuclear', 'family', 'Three', 'Men', 'Baby', 'simple', 'love', 'adult', 'infant', 'enough', 'compelling', 'story', 'will', 'more', 'compensate', 'awkwardly', 'shoe-horned', 'drug', 'subplot', 'even', 'Danson', 'Mary', 'biological', 'father', 'negligence.There', 'vital', 'place', 'planet', 'feel-good', 'movies', 'Three', 'Men', 'Baby']",N/A

Steve Gutenberg comes off as a loud, immature pinhead.  And Ted Danson is hardly in the movie at all, and when he does get any time it's primarily for sight gags rather than any sort of well-scripted humor.In addition, the women are all the worst possible human beings you could imagine.  Starting with Gutenberg's ""girlfriend"" who is just sleeping around to get back at her boyfriend, continuing with Selleck's shallow and self-centered girlfriend, and ultimately ending up with the worst of the lot, the irresponsible mother of the baby (Danson's old squeeze).None of the actors except Selleck put any effort into actually trying to act.  Steve Gutenberg seems to believe that acting is merely the act of TALKING REALLY LOUDLY.  When the baby first arrives on their doorstep, it was unbearable trying to watch Gutenberg and Selleck try to out-yell each other.  Danson doesn't seem to be quite sure what he's supposed to be doing and so he stands around looking confused for most of the movie.Only Tom Selleck's warmth comes across as genuine, and those scenes where he's interacting with the baby make this movie watchable.  In several places, such as when he suggests the baby's mother move in with the men, you can see him squirming at the utter ridiculousness of the situation.  But he pushes through and carries this movie in fits and starts through to a relatively lukewarm ending.In addition, the anti-women message damages much of the interplay between the male and female characters.  The women in this movie have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, yet the men fawn over them like they are under a spell.  Even at the end of the story when the mother of the baby returns to take the baby home to England, the men just accept it as fate rather than invoke the father's right to the baby.  The idiotic compromise is to have the mother move in with the men as if they were all one happy family despite the irresponsibility and immaturity of the flighty mother.The scenes are well-shot because the camera direction is very good, but the actor direction is very bad.  It seems like Nimoy didn't know what to do with each character and the movie really flounders because of that.Even Tom Selleck's good performance can't pull the rest of the movie above two stars.",2,"Some cute scenes, but not enough to recommend it",1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,2386,"['only', 'two', 'stars', 'movie', 'three', 'consider', 'baby', 'was', 'played', 'twins', 'are', 'baby', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'Steve', 'Gutenberg', 'off', 'loud', 'immature', 'pinhead', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'hardly', 'movie', 'when', 'get', 'time', 'primarily', 'sight', 'gags', 'rather', 'sort', 'well-scripted', 'humor.In', 'addition', 'women', 'are', 'worst', 'possible', 'human', 'beings', 'could', 'imagine', 'Starting', 'Gutenberg', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'just', 'sleeping', 'around', 'get', 'back', 'boyfriend', 'continuing', 'Selleck', 'shallow', 'self-centered', 'girlfriend', 'ultimately', 'ending', 'up', 'worst', 'lot', 'irresponsible', 'mother', 'baby', 'Danson', 'old', 'squeeze', '.None', 'actors', 'Selleck', 'put', 'effort', 'actually', 'trying', 'act', 'Steve', 'Gutenberg', 'believe', 'acting', 'merely', 'act', 'TALKING', 'REALLY', 'LOUDLY', 'When', 'baby', 'first', 'doorstep', 'was', 'unbearable', 'trying', 'watch', 'Gutenberg', 'Selleck', 'try', 'out-yell', 'other', 'Danson', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'so', 'looking', 'confused', 'most', 'movie.Only', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'warmth', 'genuine', 'scenes', 'where', 'interacting', 'baby', 'make', 'movie', 'watchable', 'several', 'places', 'such', 'when', 'baby', 'mother', 'move', 'men', 'can', 'see', 'squirming', 'utter', 'ridiculousness', 'situation', 'movie', 'fits', 'relatively', 'lukewarm', 'ending.In', 'addition', 'anti-women', 'message', 'damages', 'much', 'interplay', 'male', 'female', 'characters', 'women', 'movie', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'whatsoever', 'yet', 'men', 'fawn', 'are', 'spell', 'Even', 'end', 'story', 'when', 'mother', 'baby', 'take', 'baby', 'home', 'England', 'men', 'just', 'accept', 'fate', 'rather', 'invoke', 'father', 'right', 'baby', 'idiotic', 'compromise', 'have', 'mother', 'move', 'men', 'were', 'one', 'happy', 'family', 'irresponsibility', 'immaturity', 'flighty', 'mother.The', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-shot', 'camera', 'direction', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'direction', 'very', 'bad', 'Nimoy', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'character', 'movie', 'really', 'flounders', 'that.Even', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'good', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'rest', 'movie', 'two', 'stars']",N/A

I was a bit skeptical at first upon viewing this because I feared it would be a typical chick flick. Yes, women will dig this movie but so should men. Incase you haven't guessed from the title, three men have to care for a baby. The baby, however, isn't theirs though one of the men is unknowingly the father for a short time being. Tom Selleck, Ted Danson, and Steve Guttenberg make a great team working together even though the characters they play come off as being irresponsible big kids. Most of the humor in this movie lies with Tom and Steve trying to figure out how to take care of the baby. The humor is also not too over-the-top as is with most film comedies today. I have not seen the original french film that this movie is based off of so I can't make any comparisons regarding the two movies. Still, 3 Men and a Baby is a must see if you like viewing comedies that show people having to deal with semi-realistic and somewhat stressful situations.

Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenburg are a riot as they first discover the baby sleeping at their door while their third roommate is gone to act in a movie. The first reaction is that Tom Selleck calls Guttenburg over and says, ""What is this?""""It's a baby."" Guttenburg says in an innocent tone.""I know it's a baby."" You see Selleck's forced grin. ""What's it doing there?""""It's sleeping.""All three men have their hands full with the baby at first, but then you see that the little baby, Mary, is beginning to grow on them. Selleck and Guttenburg both have dates while seeing a play and their other roommate, the father, is at home with Mary. When they call home at Intermission and don't get an answer, they both rush home, just to see that there was nothing wrong in the first place.What was really hilarious was how the men had to deal with the heroin problem. In the beginning, they hear that a ""package"" is to be dropped off at their house, and to keep it until it's to be picked up a few days later. From the beginning, the baby is assumed to be this ""package"" and they try to pass her off to the heroin dealers when they arrive, just to realize their mistake right before the guys try to drive off with the baby to be put in the car trunk. But the men keep coming back to find their heroin, until the city's finest get involved to take the dealers down.An excellent movie!
