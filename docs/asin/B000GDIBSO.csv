1002210,A1HZKCBT5CPUXB,B000GDIBSO,Amazon customer,"[16, 16]","This documentary traces the re-election campaign of Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (Goni), which was largely run by paid, American political consultants.  Their challenge: to get their candidate re-elected even though as president his highly unpopular free-market policies had done nothing to alleviate the extreme poverty and unemployment the country was facing, and even though he was perceived as an arrogant, elitist, fair-skinned, American-raised ""gringo"" who was out of touch with the poor, indigenous majority of Bolivia.Despite all these obstacles, we see how the consultants were able to use polls, focus groups, negative attack campaigns and advertisements to successfully market their candidate (Noam Chomsky always talks about how political campaigns are like selling toothpaste; here we see a perfect example).  They also benefited from a political system in which a candidate could win with a plurality of the vote: the vote ended up being divided between three main candidates, allowing Goni to win with only 22% of the popular vote.However, as Goni continued to implement unpopular policies even after the election, the Bolivian people took to the streets en masse to demand his ouster.  Goni fled to the U.S., where he now resides, while his vice president took over until the next election in which the indigenous, left-wing candidate Evo Morales came to power with an overwhelming majority of the vote.What I found most amazing was how little the paid, American political consultants knew about the policies that ""their"" candidate was implementing and how adversely they were affecting the people.  Knowing that he was the ""free-market"" candidate (a supporter of the so-called ""Washington consensus""), was enough to convince them to work for his re-election; and these are the people who represent the ""left"" in the U.S. (James Carville and the like).  It was also shocking and disappointing to see how easily people are manipulated (i.e., Goni is not faring well in the polls so the political consultants run some ads discrediting his opponent and re-inventing Goni's image; the next focus groups and polls show that it has had the desired effect: people now like Goni better than his opponent).  People always say they know political ads are bogus, but yet they clearly work each and every time.  One questions the viability of ""real democracy"" when so many people are so easily manipulated.Personally I would have liked to see more information about the mass protests that ousted Goni and brought about the rise to power of Evo Morales.  But, I suppose that would really be another documentary.  Still, this one is worth watching.",4,It's about the art of political campaigning and the spreading of free-market capitalism (not democracy),1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,2647,"['documentary', 're-election', 'campaign', 'Gonzalo', 'Sanchez', 'Lozada', 'Goni', 'was', 'largely', 'run', 'paid', 'American', 'political', 'consultants', 'challenge', 'get', 'candidate', 're-elected', 'even', 'president', 'highly', 'unpopular', 'free-market', 'policies', 'had', 'done', 'nothing', 'alleviate', 'extreme', 'poverty', 'unemployment', 'country', 'was', 'facing', 'even', 'was', 'perceived', 'arrogant', 'elitist', 'fair-skinned', 'American-raised', 'gringo', 'who', 'was', 'touch', 'poor', 'indigenous', 'majority', 'Bolivia.Despite', 'obstacles', 'see', 'how', 'consultants', 'were', 'able', 'use', 'polls', 'focus', 'groups', 'negative', 'attack', 'campaigns', 'advertisements', 'successfully', 'market', 'candidate', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'always', 'how', 'political', 'campaigns', 'are', 'selling', 'toothpaste', 'here', 'see', 'perfect', 'example', 'also', 'benefited', 'political', 'system', 'candidate', 'could', 'win', 'plurality', 'vote', 'vote', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'divided', 'three', 'main', 'candidates', 'allowing', 'Goni', 'win', 'only', '22', '%', 'popular', 'vote.However', 'Goni', 'continued', 'implement', 'unpopular', 'policies', 'even', 'election', 'Bolivian', 'people', 'took', 'streets', 'en', 'masse', 'demand', 'ouster', 'Goni', 'fled', 'U.S.', 'where', 'now', 'vice', 'president', 'took', 'next', 'election', 'indigenous', 'left-wing', 'candidate', 'Evo', 'Morales', 'came', 'power', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'vote.What', 'found', 'most', 'amazing', 'was', 'how', 'little', 'paid', 'American', 'political', 'consultants', 'knew', 'policies', 'candidate', 'was', 'implementing', 'how', 'adversely', 'were', 'affecting', 'people', 'Knowing', 'was', 'free-market', 'candidate', 'supporter', 'so-called', 'Washington', 'consensus', 'was', 'enough', 'convince', 'work', 're-election', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'represent', 'left', 'U.S.', 'James', 'Carville', 'like', 'was', 'also', 'shocking', 'disappointing', 'see', 'how', 'easily', 'people', 'are', 'manipulated', 'i.e.', 'Goni', 'not', 'faring', 'well', 'polls', 'political', 'consultants', 'run', 'ads', 'discrediting', 'opponent', 're-inventing', 'Goni', 'image', 'next', 'focus', 'groups', 'polls', 'show', 'had', 'desired', 'effect', 'people', 'now', 'Goni', 'better', 'opponent', 'People', 'always', 'say', 'know', 'political', 'ads', 'are', 'bogus', 'yet', 'clearly', 'work', 'time', 'One', 'questions', 'viability', 'real', 'democracy', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'easily', 'manipulated.Personally', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'information', 'mass', 'ousted', 'Goni', 'brought', 'rise', 'power', 'Evo', 'Morales', 'suppose', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'documentary', 'Still', 'one', 'worth', 'watching']",Our Brand Is Crisis

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[3, 4]","""Our Brand Is Crisis"" (2005) is an extremely interesting documentary that tells us about the campaign of Gonzalo S&aacute;nchez de Losada to become president of Bolivia. How did he become president, and why did he decide to ""brand crisis"" in order to run a successful campaign? What role did the American political strategists he hired played in the 2003 Bolivian elections? And what ended up going wrong, after he was elected? The answers to those questions, and more, can be found in this dvd.I would like to highlight the fact that this documentary is made out of real life footage of meetings between S&aacute;nchez de Lozada and his advisors (before, during and after the campaign), and also contains some footage of the events that led to his resignation. This is not fiction, but reality, and that is one of the reasons why it is so illuminating.I believe that this dvd should be seen by those who are interested in political campaigns, political advertising or mass media, but also by the kind of people who like to watch an engaging documentary that helps them to understand the world we live in. ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" shows us that a presidential candidate is promoted in more or less the same way a product is advertised. However, if you buy the wrong product you can always return it. If you choose a president that is not good for your country because you believe what a wonderful advertising campaign designed through polls tells you, your country suffers.All in all, I am very happy I watched this dvd. It is the kind of documentary that you don't forget, and that gives you food for thought. Highly recommended!Belen Alcat",5,"""We are going to win this election if we choose the right frame.

1002214,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000GDIBSO,Paul Allaer,"[0, 0]","&#34;Our Brand Is Crisis&#34; (2005 release; 85 min.) brings the story of the 2002 Bolivian presidential campaign of Gonzalez &#34;Goni&#34; Sanchez, an affluent American-Bolivian who already once was president of Bolivia in the 90s. As the documentary opens, we are told &#34;February 2003&#34;, and get to see shocking footage of riots in the streets of LA Paz, Bolivia's capital. After that, we are transported back to a year earlier, February 2002, and we get to meet Goni and his team of advisors. It includes an arsenal of savvy (and surely expensive) Washington K Street consultants, including of course James Carville, who are trying to devise a winning strategy for Goni, lagging far behind in the polls, with only 6 months to go before the elections. To tell you much more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is one heck of a riveting documentary. It helps that apparently the film makers were given unprecedented all-access to seemingly the most confidential and most strategic of meetings. It helps if you don't know the outcome of the election (which was my case), but I will venture to say that even if I had known, it would still have been one heck of a ride. Second, the strategies used by the American consulting team (focus groups, negative ads, etc.) are of course used widely here in the US, but it is fascinating to see them deployed in this foreign context. Third, one of the campaign slogans used by Goni and his team is,,,, dare you guess.... &#34;yes it can be done!&#34;. Sounds familiar? Last but certainly not least, we get to the election results about an hour into the movie. So you are probably wondering what is left to be said for the next 25 min. and I'm certainly not going to spoil it here. Just watch! You will be surprised...Bottom line, if you like documentaries or if you are interested in politics in general, and foreign politics in particular, you don't want to miss this. Truly an excellent documentary that seems as fresh today, 2014, as when it came out in 2005. &#34;Our Brand Is Crisis&#34; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,4.5 stars...

1002215,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B000GDIBSO,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[10, 10]","While I consider myself better informed than average on Central and South American politics, I didn't know that much about the elections of the early 2000s in Bolivia. I have asserted that the leftward swing there of the last few years was because of the way we Yanks have treated those countries. So true.But I realized while watching this gem that the issue addressed by the film is as much about us as it is about those other countries!As others have pointed out, Greenberg, Carville and Schrum, a well-known Washington political consulting (classy way of saying PR) firm was hired by Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada--aka Goni--to get him elected president of Bolivia. He'd been brought up in the United States--suburban Washington, DC, while his father was exiled. He'd been president of Bolivia for a term in the 1990s, had, according to the film, set up some social programs, e.g., Social Security, and had provided some reforms to education. But he had also ""capitalized."" That term wasn't really defined until toward the end of the film when I believe the word used was ""privatized.""Well, GCS did what such a consultant does here in the US: They had their pollsters following Bolivian trends, gave one-liners and effective rhetoric to Goni, set up countless ""focus groups,"" instituted negative campaigning, e.g., made Goni's opponents look like budding fascists, or out of touch with reality--something that's become commonplace here in the US. In short, they avoided facing any issues, those which make democracy work--again, something of which many in the US know pathetically little.Indeed, Goni's opponents were far more populist than Goni was. The people--you know, those pests who tend to get on the nerves of our fearless political elites--were demanding constitutional change, even representation. Goni ignored those issues, while his consultants advised him to stick to his principals, what he believed was better for the company.Well, to make a long story short, after 14 months and lots of demonstrations, and deaths of demonstrators, Goni was forced to resign where he became a neighbor of mine here in the DC area. Probably the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was his sale of the country's natural gas reserves with no input from the people of his country. His VP tried to take a more moderate approach, but was also forced to resign when he couldn't find a happy medium to meet the people's nees and those of foreign investors. So eventually one of Goni's opponents, whose name escapes me now, was elected as Bolivia's first indigenous president.The film focused on Goni's not having a majority--he got about 22 percent of the vote while his opponents each got about 21 percent--as the source of the problem. But I argue that the major problem rather was that the election relied in image and superficial message--the standard tactics of public relations--rather than political issues, again, that which makes democracy what it is! And that I blame on GCS! (Indeed, I had more respect for James Carville before seeing the film than I did after.) Carville and his associates spent the last 10 minutes of the film trying to rationalize the disaster that Bolivia became, and the reinforces my belief that the disaster was more their fault, based on the angles they took, than that of anything else.And our ""democracy"" is obviously failing for the same reason: too many not voting on issues but on one liners, slogans, PR campaigns as much negative as positive. So while jobs are disappearing--as they had in Bolivia--people are talking about Rev. Wright, gay marriage, and whatever devil terms can be created to distract us from what really happens.Shame on those who've reduced campaigns to that level, whether hired by the GOP or Democrats.
