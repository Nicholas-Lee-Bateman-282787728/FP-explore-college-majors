907845,AW5BZD37T2G3N,B0009KQP1E,Just Another Opinion,"[1, 2]","When it comes to cheap productions, this awful little mess should rank near the top of the (garbage) heap.  Script, acting, and production values are nil, and it appears that the whole thing was shot with a home video camera; however, it is far less entertaining than the average home video.  It is an utterly pointless waste of time and money, and should be marketed only as a cure for insomnia.  When compared with the bozos who made this film, Ed Wood looks like Cecil B. DeMille, and that is a notable accomplishment indeed.  The size of the budget does not determine the quality of the film; however, when coupled with a dull and pointless script, sleepwalking actors, and the incredible ineptitude of the writer/director, the low budget doesn't exactly recommend it.  Admirers of this film are certainly welcome to it; those of us who are evidently not as intellectually gifted can live without it.  The debate over this film is rather like the story, ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", in that those who look hard enough for something will generally see it, whether it exists or not.  This sorry mess isn't worth the pomposity and arrogance with which some persons choose to approach it.  Personally, I find this film to be an abject waste, so number me among the numbskulls.",1,Dreadful,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,1276,"['When', 'cheap', 'productions', 'awful', 'little', 'mess', 'should', 'rank', 'top', 'garbage', 'heap', 'Script', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'nil', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'shot', 'home', 'video', 'camera', 'however', 'far', 'less', 'entertaining', 'average', 'home', 'video', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'should', 'be', 'marketed', 'only', 'cure', 'insomnia', 'When', 'compared', 'bozos', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'DeMille', 'notable', 'accomplishment', 'indeed', 'size', 'budget', 'not', 'determine', 'quality', 'film', 'however', 'when', 'coupled', 'dull', 'pointless', 'script', 'sleepwalking', 'actors', 'incredible', 'ineptitude', 'writer/director', 'low', 'budget', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'recommend', 'Admirers', 'film', 'are', 'certainly', 'welcome', 'who', 'are', 'evidently', 'not', 'intellectually', 'gifted', 'can', 'live', 'debate', 'film', 'rather', 'story', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Clothes', 'who', 'look', 'hard', 'enough', 'something', 'will', 'generally', 'see', 'not', 'sorry', 'mess', ""n't"", 'worth', 'pomposity', 'arrogance', 'persons', 'choose', 'approach', 'Personally', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'abject', 'waste', 'number', 'numbskulls']",Zodiac Killer

You would probably find more entertainment (not to mention professionalism and factual research) in those awful quasipornographic ""detective dramas"" than you could ever hope to fish out of the rotting celluloid corpse of ""The Zodiac Killer"". German hack Uli Lommel, fresh after his months-long ""reign"" on the #1 position of IMDB.com's Bottom 100 (the list of the worst movies of all time), decided to invade the US with this new ""film"", apparently determined to prove that Ed Wood may not be alive, but his spirit was reincarnated in Germany and is currently shared between the bodies of Lommel and Boll (both with eerily similar first names... coincidence or curse?). Mission accomplished, herr Lommel! In fact, you outdid yourself, for compared to you, Ed Wood looks like Ingmar Bergman.(Oh, and herr ""Wils..."", err, Lommel? Take it easy with the planted positive reviews, would you? That does not become even your sort...)Finally, a helpful hand for those few who might want to torture themselves by trying to see this ""film"" just to find out what identity Lommel gave to the Zodiac - if you want to know the ""great twist"" of ""The Zodiac Killer"", read on...Lommel (yes, he has a prominent ""acting"" role in this ""film"" of his) is the Zodiac. A retired Zodiac filled with - drums, maestro - remorse. Hilariously enough, this is supposed to be a surprise, even though the very first second that we see Lommel's character, we're not only told that he knows every detail of Zodiac's life, from the earliest childhood to his post-1960s undetected murders, but we're also immediately drawn to the black-rimmed, square glasses that he's wearing (for some reason, he has no Zodiac-brand watch - perhaps Lommel thought that it *might* be too much of a hint?). We're also left wondering why the Zodiac would speak broken English with a horribly pronounced and annoying German accent, but such details are of no importance to Lommel. He's an independent director, you see.
