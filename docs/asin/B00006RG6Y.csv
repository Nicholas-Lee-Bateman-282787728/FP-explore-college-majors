722499,A2AGQHF6JICYZQ,B00006RG6Y,Amazon Customer,"[8, 9]","True, the US sets are cheaper than the Canada sets (though if you buy the canada sets from Amazon.ca, they're LOTS cheaper than buying them as imports from Amazon.com). True, the Canadian sets have difficult packaging (DVD overlay and spindles that require a lot of pressure before you can pop out the disk without risk of damage). True the first two Canadian season sets use the dreaded ""flipper"" (2-sided) disks. True what we saw in the US as a third season of 22 (missing four episodes, by the way) was produced and broadcast in Canada as two seasons of 13 each -- and the third and fourth DVD sets are released separately too. (Does the US ""third season"" set have all 26?) And most ironic truth of all: if I'd known that by waiting, I'd have gotten all three sets cheaper from an American distributor, I'd've taken that route too.However -- the Canadian sets feature pristine transfers. (I've read that the US sets use videotape as the masters; I'm not sure where this info comes from, but it doesn't make sense that the masters would be any different than what the Alliance sets drew upon, since they license the material.) The Canadian sets feature disks running at the highest speed. (The American disks are single sided because they jam twice the normal amount of eps. per side, and run at a slower speed. That, it seems to me, would account for VHS-like resolution.) The Canadian sets, for whatever it's worth, do feature accurate packaging (the right cast members listed and featured in illustrations). And finally ---- small thing though it may be ---- the Caniadian Final (4th) Season set does have a small but utterly delightful extra. Paul Gross does a running commentary for both parts of CALL OF THE WILD. I can live without most commentary tracks I hear, but this is one you'll return to. It's witty, wryly funny and thoughtfully observed.I won't tell you not to save the dough on the American release, I empathize ... I'll only tell you, the Canadian sets have more vibrant sound and video.

I read about it and it sounded like a show I would like, so I bought it. My family and I just love it! What a sweet, and hilarious, show. I'm so glad it is available on DVD so that we could see it. It's just a wonderful show with great writing and great acting - quirky, funny, tender and wry - just great. I love Canadian humor so much (Red Green, Martin Short, John Candy, et al., etc...)and this is an excellent example. My only criticism: David Marciano (""Ray Veccio"") should be pictured on the DVD cover along with ""the Mountie"". David Marciano has a wonderful face and the greatest smile and was just terrific and essential to the show. I will buy the seasons with him in them but don't think I will try the later seasons when he was gone. The recurring ""bit"" with Ray Veccio and his Buick Riviera - wonderful. Love this show! Here we have another example of television when it is good, television how it can be, television how it so very rarely is. Treasure it when it happens.

Due South is funny, action-packed, full of delightful characters (including a deaf wolf named after a former Canadian PM), and not a little bittersweet. As suspense-mysteries go, the shows aren't bad either. One caveat, though: By jamming 6 hour-format episodes on each disk, the manufacturer has degraded the visual quality.

Due South presents the adventures of a very sharp, good-looking, by-the-book Canadian Mountie (and his multi-talented but strong-willed dog) and a street-wise Chicago detective. How this improbable pair (or trio, since the dog is an invaluable member of the team) got together was developed in the pilot, but it really doesn't matter if you missed it as long as you're willing to take this special series on its own unique terms. The various episodes poke good-natured fun at both Canadian and American foibles while presenting well-written entertaining plots. Unfortunately, because it was transferred from one time slot to another and cancelled and revived, Due South was never given a fair chance to develop the audience it deserved.

It's a cop show (complete with car chases.) It has wonderful characters you instantly like. The themes about friendship are strong. And the comedy is deadpan and hilarious. The set-up for the show is that a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ends up working in Chicago as the unofficial partner of a Chicago Detective. The Canadian is perfect: polite, proper, sweet, gorgeous, brilliant, loyal, proficient and ever-so-serious. The Chicago cop is cynical, bumbling, uncool, intuitive, and a loyal friend.

722510,A1PV2Q6K7EVFTG,B00006RG6Y,Gary Rinkerman,"[1, 3]","In the 1970s, American audiences accepted, in the spirit of good natured fun, the Canadian group Guess Who's schlock hit ""American Woman,"" even though it was highly derivative (a sort of Led Zeppelin lite), silly and full of insecure Canadian ""we are so very different from Americans"" cultural jingoism.  The same sort of approach - acceptance as good natured fun - is needed to enjoy Due South, a Canadian produced, ""set in Chicago"" formulaic buddy-cop series that veers wildly (sometimes in a single episode) from genuinely cool and slick pop entertainment to amazingly dumb and inconsistent writing, story line and production values.  The main character Benton Fraser (Paul Gross) is a stiff, cartoon-like, morally pristine Canadian Mountie who can leap in front of high speed vehicles, confront a bar full of seedy and heavily armed underworld characters or jump/tumble from great heights without any sign of fear or hesitancy and, more importantly, without wrinkling his crisp Mountie uniform.  All this is done while we learn that Benton can also speak Chinese, communicate almost intuitively with his deaf, lip-reading pet wolf and determine where a clod of Chicago-area mud came from simply by sniffing or tasting it (no kidding).  Benton's sidekick (or co-main character) is Ray Vecchio (David Marciano), a harried Chicago detective whose cheesy exterior and gruff mannerisms barely conceal his reluctant sincerity and heart of gold.  Together, these two unlikely buddies (a modern day, whimsical Holmes and worldly Watson duo) finesse, stumble and plod their way through a series of mysteries and adventures - from solving the mystery of how contaminated meat is entering Chicago-area grocery stores to thwarting vicious murderers and kidnappers.  Accepted for what it is - good, clean fun with a tongue-in-cheek attitude - it is easy to overlook the deficiencies and inconsistencies in this series and, instead, focus on its merits as middle-of-the-road, albeit sometimes lightweight and amateurish, entertainment. On a more cynical note, the series is certainly worth the 20 to 30 dollar price per season - even if you just use it as video ""background noise"" or ""filler"" for other activities, such as housecleaning, reading the paper or vegging out with not-too-stimulating or challenging tv fare after a hard day at work.  I don't think Due South will ever be considered among the classic achievements of television, but it is worth viewing.

When I saw that it was out on DVD I immediately ordered both seasons.  One copy for me, one copy for my Dad for Christmas.Both copies of season 1 arrived with disc one loose in the case, featuring a massive scratch on one side.  I tried a disc polisher on it, and it fixed the scratch.  Later (after it was too late to return it) I noticed a crack in two of the three discs.  They were probably there to begin with, but were aggravated by the clips in the case that the discs come in, which hold each disc so tightly that you have to warp the disc to remove it.So I ordered another copy, figuring that it was just a shipping problem, since both season 1 sets came in the same order.  But the new shipment came with disc one rattling loose in the case and a big ugly scratch on one side.But no cracks, so I can use my disc polisher to fix it.Still, if it someone hadn't been such a cheap b@st@rd about the DVD case, this whole fiasco could have been avoided.Contentwise, the discs are great.  I like the fact that you can just watch all four episodes on a side without returning to the menu.  The chapter breaks are in bizarre places, so if you try to skip past the opening credits you wind up halfway through the episode somewhere.That's why it gets three stars.

722513,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00006RG6Y,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Paul Haggis has had some great successes in film (CRASH, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA) and in television (WALKER, TEXAS RANGER, THIRTYSOMETHING). But it's DUE SOUTH for which I thank him the most. Whenever I watch a DUE SOUTH episode, I always somehow end up shaking my head. This was such a great and fun show, and it deserved more longevity. But, it wasn't meant to be, thanks to CBS, which, after every season of DUE SOUTH, persisted in pulling the plug (only to have the show resurrect itself each time, at least until the 4th and final season). But at least we get a consolation prize in this DUE SOUTH: SEASON ONE 4-disc dvd set. From which, by the way, a star or two should be lopped off for not inserting ANY special features. But, never mind, I'm just glad the dvds are out.The Canadian-made DUE SOUTH started out as a made-for-TV film. It received such a warm response that it prompted CBS to pick it up for a primetime slot. And, really, what's not to like? With its prescription of whimsy, warmth, and gentle humor, this was a series which generously gave back to its viewers. Even if you do start halfway suspecting that Canadians just might be superior to Yanks. Anyway, the show excelled at gently poking fun at both American and Canadian stereotypes.It's a great fish-out-of-water premise. A guileless, by-the-book Mountie plying his trade in jaded, crooked Chicago. Compulsively helpful, RCMP Constable Benton Fraser (Paul Gross) initially befuddles those around him as folks have trouble believing he is for real. Fraser is the only Chicagoan resident to not have locks on his door. He's an everlasting irritant (but at times a positive influence) to his cop buddy Detective Ray Vecchio (David Marciano), who himself is obnoxious, street savvy, and resembles a skinny rat in garish shirts. In the pilot episode, the two of them meet and strike up an unlikely friendship. And even though Fraser is assigned to the Canadian consulate - and thus has no official capacity to solve Chicago PD crimes - he proves invaluable to Detective Vecchio.Himself the son of a legendary Mountie, Constable Fraser lives up to the stereotype held up to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. And then some. He is truthful, brave, trustworthy, and unfailingly courteous. He also is very literal-minded, which sparks some of the show's humor (although there's a sneaking feeling that he's not as naive as he seems). The Constable also has acute powers of observation and exceptionally attuned senses. In one episode, he decodes a computer password simply by recalling the typing sounds made by someone's fingers. His ability to smell and hear, as well as his habit of tasting (and identifying) objects picked up off the ground (to Vecchio's constant dismay), often breaks a case wide open. That he's oblivious to being a chick magnet is also a source of nettlement for Vecchio, as is Fraser's narrating of arcane trivia and of moralistic Inuit tales. Too, Fraser has a tendency of guilting Vecchio into doing the right thing. But Vecchio gets Fraser back by making turns without employing the turn signal. Occasionally, he'd run a stop sign, which drives Fraser crazy (""That was a stop sign, Ray.""). Do I have to mention that these two actors have very good chemistry?This is a such a well-written show, full of insightful wit, quirky humor, and quiet, poignant drama. And the soundtrack is great. One of the show's odder beats has Fraser's dead father appearing and having talks with his son. One episode even has Fraser's dead grandmother scolding his dead father, except that Fraser can only see and hear his dad, not the nana. But, whatever, it was all too metaphysical for me. An added allure to DUE SOUTH is that you never quite know where an episode is heading. Fraser's frequent forays into good samaritanship often leads him and Vecchio into the most offbeat of cases. Fraser's efforts to help a little girl unveils an insurance scam. A small time investigation into bad supermarket meat escalates into a high stakes horse-stealing racket. Fraser's gentle reprimand of an illegally parked man leads to a cache of stolen weaponry. And so on.The cast is across the board excellent. Naturally, Paul Gross carries much of the load, and he's perfect. There just may be a hint of smugness in Gross's Benton Fraser, but he's such a great straight-arrow character that it's hard to not like the guy. He simply exudes sincerity and a wholesome charm, and his deadpan delivery is pitch perfect. He's a very good actor, who makes do here with a minimal yet very revealing use of expressions. His acting is never better displayed than in ""The Wild Bunch"" and the 2-part ""Victoria's Secret."" Plus, he irons his boots, which must be worth a few extra points.David Marciano perfectly complements Gross as his wonderfully irascible but loyal partner and best friend. Marciano is particularly fantastic in the episodes ""You Must Remember This"" (in which he falls in love) and ""The Deal"" (in which he confronts a Chicago mobster). And then there's the soulful dog Diefenbaker. For the uninitiated, Diefenbaker is an intelligent, willful deaf wolf who reads lips and who had adopted Fraser back in the wilds. And he is a joy to watch, scene-stealer that he is. Several episodes give this dog ample time to shine, but especially ""The Wild Bunch."" Fraser, Vecchio, and Diefenbaker are the core of the series, and their interactions truly are what fuels the show.DUE SOUTH has a way of presenting one with life lessons, but does it in entertaining fashion. If you pay attention, you may also pick some little known facts. One thing I learned is that the Canadian Mountie's motto isn't really ""We always get our man"" (it's actually ""Uphold the law""). Which Constable Fraser does, and well. He may be a man out of his element and maybe out of his era. But he seems to be doing fine, maybe even more than fine. DUE SOUTH was one of the best shows out there in the mid-'90s, and we really should've been treated to more episodes. But it's nice to have the good Constable on dvd, anyway, in this exceptional first season. So to DUE SOUTH and its makers, I say, ""Thank you kindly.""",5,"Chivalry's not dead - it's in Chicago, sporting a wide brimmed hat",1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,6169,"['Paul', 'Haggis', 'had',

However this way you get it just as it was!!!Plus its one cracker of a show, Paul Gross and David Marciano carried this show from its small beginnings to being a cult smash here in the uk!Also after the original Ray left it was never the same, the whole show went under.  Anyway for a cop/Mountie show this was one was a lone shark and gave vulnerability and heart that TV shows such as CSI and without a trace could give there back teeth for.This first season proves it the acting, story lines thanks to the superb Haggis and everything about this show makes it stand out, it has also stood the test of time, well.  Bar the mobile phones and crazy styles anyway.However it was at the very end of this season that something truelly magic did happen and it don't happen very often either.

Fraser, the RCMP Mounty, is an invariably polite, unfailingly non-violent (to the extent possible) liason to the Chicago police department's wise-cracking bad attitude italian cop Ray.  What makes it truly intriguing is that most of the time, Ray gets himself into difficulty with his bad attitude and matching verbal banter, while Fraser's open, friendly politeness succeeds in getting the desired results.  A really good family show that teaches younger members of the family (for example, our ten-year-old grandson) the benefits of being nice and polite instead of violent and angry.

The Canadian box sets are $80 Canadian, so buying all four seasons from Canada is an expensive proposition. The American release costs a third of that, and contains the pilot to boot, which wasn't included until the Season 3 box set in Canada.Due South followed the misguided adventures of Benton Fraser, a constable in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as he tracked his father's killers to Chicago. After closing the case, his Canadian superiors advised him to lie low, so he remains in Chicago as a liaison at the Canadian consulate and works cases with Ray Vecchio, Chicago cop. The Canadian/American and wilderness/city culture clash leads to some humorous moments along the way.The picture quality is noticeably grainy since it was taken from videotape rather than the masters, but for the great price (I now have all the seasons for less than one season of the Canadian box set), it's a compromise that was worth it. Like the Canadian set, there are no extras, also no closed captioning. Menus are bare bones and include episodes and chapter menus (hardly ""interactive"" menus as stated on the box). The packaging is a big step from the clunky Canadian design, featuring an attractive foldout cardboard case with large photos of Ray, Benton, and Dief. The DVDs are single sided, meaning easier handling. And all 24 first season episodes are here, including the two-hour pilot and two-part Victoria's Secret, possibly the finest episode of the entire series.Due South was a unique show that poked fun at Canadians from an ""American"" perspective. The show was set in Chicago (there are several inserts of Chicago landmarks such as the Sears Tower and El tracks) was filmed in Toronto: note the streetcar tracks and noticeable Toronto financial buildings in some of the rooftop shots, also, the Roy Thomson concert hall is clearly visible in ""One Good Man."" ""American"" characters clearly speak with a Canadian accent, in one episode a man mentions Parliamentary law while debating with a ""Chicago"" alderman, but all in all, a fun tribute to my native city (Chicago) and my adopted one (Toronto). (My favourite surreal moment is in ""The Man Who Knew Too Little,"" where they are supposedly in Michigan [the highway markers are distinctively Ontarian] and mention the town where I grew up).Although the picture quality is less than stellar, it certainly beats my old videotaped copies that were rapidly deteriorating, and it's wonderful to reconnect with the excellent scripts, jokes, and friendly jabs at Canadian culture (curling, hockey, bilingualism, politeness, etc.). The first two seasons are very family friendly, with limited swearing, violence, and sexual overtones. The third (and fourth, depending on how you count the last season) season was much darker, grittier, and sexually charged, including explicit songs on the soundtrack, and may not be as suitable for family viewing.",5,"Five stars for the price and happy memories, three and a half for video quality",1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,2999,"['found', 'out', 'domestic', 'release', 'Due', 'South', 'Amazon.com', 'rushed', 'buy', 'three', 'seasons', 'Canadian', 'box', 'sets', 'are', '80', 'Canadian', 'buying', 'four', 'seasons', 'Canada', 'expensive', 'proposition', 'American', 'release', 'third', 'pilot', 'boot', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'Season', '3', 'box', 'set', 'Canada.Due', 'South', 'followed', 'misguided', 'adventures', 'Benton', 'Fraser', 'constable', 'Royal', 'Canadian', 'Mounted', 'Police', 'tracked', 'father', 'killers', 'Chicago', 'closing', 'case', 'Canadian', 'superiors', 'advised', 'lie', 'low', 'Chicago', 'liaison', 'Canadian', 'consulate', 'cases', 'Ray', 'Vecchio', 'Chicago', 'cop', 'Canadian/American', 'wilderness/city', 'culture', 'clash', 'humorous', 'moments', 'way.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'noticeably', 'grainy', 'was', 'taken', 'videotape', 'rather', 'masters', 'great', 'price', 'now', 'have', 'seasons', 'less', 'one', 'season', 'Canadian', 'box', 'set', 'compromise', 'was', 'Canadian', 'set', 'are', 'extras', 'also', 'closed', 'captioning', 'Menus', 'are', 'bare', 'bones', 'include', 'episodes', 'chapter', 'menus', 'hardly', 'interactive', 'menus', 'stated', 'box', 'packaging', 'big', 'step', 'clunky', 'Canadian', 'design', 'featuring', 'attractive', 'foldout', 'cardboard', 'case', 'large', 'photos', 'Ray', 'Benton', 'Dief', 'DVDs', 'are', 'single', 'sided', 'meaning', 'easier', 'handling', '24', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'here', 'including', 'two-hour', 'pilot', 'two-part', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'possibly', 'finest', 'episode', 'entire', 'series.Due', 'South', 'was', 'unique', 'show', 'poked', 'fun', 'Canadians', 'American', 'perspective', 'show', 'was', 'set', 'Chicago', 'are', 'several', 'inserts', 'Chicago', 'landmarks', 'such', 'Sears', 'Tower', 'El', 'tracks', 'was', 'filmed', 'Toronto', 'note', 'streetcar', 'tracks', 'noticeable', 'Toronto', 'financial', 'buildings', 'rooftop', 'shots', 'also', 'Roy', 'Thomson', 'concert', 'hall', 'clearly', 'visible', 'One', 'Good', 'Man', 'American', 'characters', 'clearly', 'speak', 'Canadian', 'accent', 'one', 'episode', 'man', 'Parliamentary', 'law', 'debating', 'Chicago', 'alderman', 'fun', 'tribute', 'native', 'city', 'Chicago', 'adopted', 'one', 'Toronto', 'favourite', 'surreal', 'moment', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Little', 'where', 'are', 'supposedly', 'Michigan', '[', 'highway', 'markers', 'are', 'distinctively', 'Ontarian', ']', 'mention', 'town', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'picture', 'quality', 'less', 'stellar', 'certainly', 'old', 'videotaped', 'copies', 'were', 'rapidly', 'deteriorating', 'wonderful', 'reconnect', 'excellent', 'scripts', 'jokes', 'friendly', 'jabs', 'Canadian', 'culture', 'curling', 'hockey', 'bilingualism', 'politeness', 'etc.', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'very', 'family', 'friendly', 'limited', 'swearing', 'violence', 'sexual', 'overtones', 'third', 'fourth', 'depending', 'how', 'count', 'last', 'season', 'season', 'was', 'much', 'darker', 'grittier', 'sexually', 'charged', 'including', 'explicit', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'family', 'viewing']",Due South : Season 1

While it is true that Best Buy tends to sell the sets cheaper, as far as I know there is no new edition of the Due South season sets.The version listed here is the Canadian DVD release (note that it says ""import"" on the product description) by Alliance Atlantis (the company that produced Due South).What you may be seeing at Best Buy is the *far* cheaper US release ""Platinum"" DVD's which do include the pilot in the season 1 set.  However, do note that these have a lower screen quality whereas the Canadian version has been digitally remastered.  The Platinum DVD's do not have at least one few voice-over commentary present in the Canadian release.This more expensive Canadian release has the 'misplaced' pilot inserted in the third season set, the additional 'Final Fourth Season' set (which is encorporated in the Platinum set's third season set), troublesome double-sided DVD's, and unreliable packaging with DVD's that come loose during shipment.That said, Best Buy Canada does seem to carry the Canadian sets at prices cheaper than those listed on Amazon.com *and* Amazon.ca.You decide whether you want price or screen quality!",4,Cheaper Best-Buy DVD's,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,1216,"['note', 'cheaper', 'Best', 'Buy', 'DVD', 'here', 'have', 'mentioned', 'true', 'Best', 'Buy', 'sell', 'sets', 'cheaper', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'new', 'edition', 'Due', 'South', 'season', 'sets.The', 'version', 'listed', 'here', 'Canadian', 'DVD', 'release', 'note', 'import', 'product', 'description', 'Alliance', 'Atlantis', 'company', 'produced', 'Due', 'South', 'may', 'be', 'seeing', 'Best', 'Buy', '*far*', 'cheaper', 'US', 'release', 'Platinum', 'DVD', 'do', 'include', 'pilot', 'season', '1', 'set', 'However', 'do', 'note', 'have', 'lower', 'screen', 'quality', 'whereas', 'Canadian', 'version', 'been', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'Platinum', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'few', 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'present', 'Canadian', 'release.This', 'more', 'expensive', 'Canadian', 'release', ""'misplaced"", 'pilot', 'inserted', 'third', 'season', 'set', 'additional', ""'Final"", 'Fourth', 'Season', 'set', 'encorporated', 'Platinum', 'set', 'third', 'season', 'set', 'troublesome', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'unreliable', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'come', 'loose', 'shipment.That', 'said', 'Best', 'Buy', 'Canada', 'seem', 'carry', 'Canadian', 'sets', 'prices', 'cheaper', 'listed', 'Amazon.com', '*and*', 'Amazon.ca.You', 'decide', 'want', 'price', 'screen', 'quality']",Due South : Season 1
722536,A2A60Y2HTOTNSX,B00006RG6Y,yourlibrarian,"[3, 3]","Thanks to other reviews for this item I was aware of both the difference in image quality, what constituted the various ""seasons"" of this series, and the mismatch in cost of the sets between Amazon US and Amazon Canada.Having ordered all 4 of the Canadian seasons I can say there's no question the image quality on these sets is terrific.  By getting them through Amazon Canada I got them for a comparable price to the other US sold sets listed on Amazon (and available through Best Buy).  It took maybe an extra week to receive them but this was mostly due to availability so otherwise it was still pretty prompt.As to the show I am still going through the seasons but Season 1 has been a delight.  Unfortunately the pilot episode is available only on the Season 3 box set.  While it helps to have seen the pilot, if you only want to try out the first season it's not critical to have seen it.  I'm betting though that you will want to see more after the first set so a purchase of both seasons at the same time will not be a bad bet.If you do buy Season 3 at the same time, this is the only one of the 4 that did not use double sided discs.  For some reason the discs were also very loose meaning all 4 had moved all over the box when it was opened.  So far it doesn't seem to have damaged the discs, but you may want to check them as soon as you receive the package.",5,Buy from Amazon Canada,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,1369,"['Thanks', 'other', 'reviews', 'item', 'was', 'aware', 'difference', 'image', 'quality', 'what', 'constituted', 'various', 'seasons', 'series', 'mismatch', 'cost', 'sets', 'Amazon', 'US', 'Amazon', 'Canada.Having', 'ordered', '4', 'Canadian', 'seasons', 'can', 'say', 'question', 'image', 'quality', 'sets', 'terrific', 'getting', 'Amazon', 'Canada', 'got', 'comparable', 'price', 'other', 'US', 'sold', 'sets', 'listed', 'Amazon', 'available', 'Best', 'Buy', 'took', 'maybe', 'extra', 'week', 'receive', 'was', 'mostly', 'due', 'availability', 'so', 'otherwise', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'prompt.As', 'show', 'am', 'still', 'going', 'seasons', 'Season', '1', 'been', 'delight', 'Unfortunately', 'pilot', 'episode', 'available', 'only', 'Season', '3', 'box', 'set', 'have', 'seen', 'pilot', 'only', 'want', 'try', 'out', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'critical', 'have', 'seen', ""'m"", 'betting', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'first', 'set', 'so', 'purchase', 'seasons', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'bet.If', 'do', 'buy', 'Season', '3', 'same', 'time', 'only', 'one', '4', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'reason', 'discs', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'loose', 'meaning', '4', 'had', 'moved', 'all', 'box', 'when', 'was', 'opened', 'So', 'far', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'damaged', 'discs', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'as', 'soon', 'receive', 'package']",Due South : Season 1
