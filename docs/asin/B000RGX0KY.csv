This review is for the product itself: I bought an used set in Amazon and the phantom of the Opera won't play in any of my HD DVD players HD-A20 HD-A30 and HD-D2. The Fugitive had pixel problems in all players and the same happened to the unforgiven. the only movie that was OK was The Last Samurai. Then I decided to buy a set that was new, thinking that the reason why the previous one, wouldn't play was because it was used and therefore somehow damaged. Well to my surprise the brand new one had exactly the same problem. therefore I don't recommend this set to any one. By the way all of the players have the latest 4.0 firmware update, so the players should not be the issue.",1,Phantom of The Opera won't play in any player,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,750,"['review', 'not', 'movies', 'consider', 'be', 'great', 'review', 'product', 'bought', 'used', 'set', 'Amazon', 'phantom', 'Opera', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'HD', 'DVD', 'players', 'HD-A20', 'HD-A30', 'HD-D2', 'Fugitive', 'had', 'pixel', 'problems', 'players', 'same', 'happened', 'unforgiven', 'only', 'movie', 'was', 'OK', 'was', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'Then', 'decided', 'buy', 'set', 'was', 'new', 'thinking', 'reason', 'why', 'previous', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'was', 'was', 'used', 'therefore', 'somehow', 'damaged', 'Well', 'surprise', 'brand', 'new', 'one', 'had', 'exactly', 'same', 'problem', 'therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'set', 'one', 'way', 'players', 'have', 'latest', '4.0', 'firmware', 'update', 'players', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'issue']",The Best of Collection: Volume 2
