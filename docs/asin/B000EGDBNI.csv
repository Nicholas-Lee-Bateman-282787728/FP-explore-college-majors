972337,A2S59UCZM6XUAE,B000EGDBNI,"A. BOSS ""AEB""","[1, 4]","Rise Stevens was a very good singer. The problem with this DVD (which is of TV broadcasts of the early 1950s) is that television at that time was rather crude by todays standards (both audio & video) and this DVD does not seem to be technically updated. Also, like many opera singers, she was much better in the arias than the songs. However, it is interesting to see the kind of programs available on comercial TV back then.",2,Interesting historic recording,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,425,"['Rise', 'Stevens', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'singer', 'problem', 'DVD', 'TV', 'broadcasts', 'early', '1950s', 'television', 'time', 'was', 'rather', 'crude', 'todays', 'standards', 'audio', 'video', 'DVD', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'technically', 'updated', 'Also', 'many', 'opera', 'singers', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'arias', 'songs', 'However', 'interesting', 'see', 'kind', 'programs', 'available', 'comercial', 'TV', 'back', 'then']",N/A

For those of us too young or living in the wrong place to have heard her live, this DVD is one of the few records of her voice, her acting and her abilitiy to captivate an audience.  The sound has a limited frequency range, the images are soft but except for one song toward the end, where the lighting over exposes her facial features, the DVD is fine.  It is, as noted by others, an historic recording, but it much better than nothing.  For those who want to hear more of this wonderful singer there is a CD of her Carmen remastered from 1953 with Jan Peerce as Don Jose",5,If you love Rise Stevens you must have this DVD,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,674,"['Why', 'did', 'Rise', 'Stevens', 'rule', 'MET', 'so', 'long', 'Why', 'was', 'considered', 'Carmen', 'generation', 'too', 'young', 'living', 'wrong', 'place', 'have', 'heard', 'live', 'DVD', 'one', 'few', 'records', 'voice', 'acting', 'abilitiy', 'captivate', 'audience', 'sound', 'limited', 'frequency', 'range', 'images', 'are', 'soft', 'one', 'song', 'end', 'where', 'lighting', 'facial', 'features', 'DVD', 'fine', 'noted', 'others', 'historic', 'recording', 'much', 'better', 'nothing', 'who', 'want', 'hear', 'more', 'wonderful', 'singer', 'CD', 'Carmen', 'remastered', '1953', 'Jan', 'Peerce', 'Don', 'Jose']",N/A
