I read that she was one of the young singers/actors showcased in NEW FACES and so I had to have it.The picture quality isn't too bad. The movie is in color and though there are a few tiny jump cuts here and there, and the picture isn't as sharp as sayI Love Lucy - The Complete Third Season, which is from the same year or thereabouts, but for the most part it's watchable.Most of the unknown actors making their appearance are pretty good in this feature like Alice Ghostley and Paul Lynde, who would go on to television fame as character actors, but Eartha Kitt and Robert Clary really steal the show!Both sing and dance their heart out. Even though Kitt only has dance and song numbers, she really shines here. It's too bad they didn't have her do more acting in NEW FACES, but that probably had to do with racism more than anything else. Clary is funny as a diminutive French man and he sings really well.Anyway, Eartha performs her standards like ""C'est Si Bon,"" ""Uska Dara,"" ""Monotonous,"" ""Bal Petit Bal,"" and the absolutely magnificent ""Santa Baby,"" which is worth the price of this DVD alone. She sings and dances up a storm and it's really something to see the ""Sex Kitten"" in her prime. No wonder Orson Welles referred to her as the ""most exciting woman in the world.""The movie itself is built around musical and comedy sketches of the actors, so it's not a really strong storyline but it's fun to watch. I'd recommend NEW FACES to Eartha Kitt fans like myself or fans of Mel Brooks, who wrote the sketches.",4,A Must Have For *Eartha Kitt* Fans!,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,1580,"['only', 'reason', 'bought', 'NEW', 'FACES', '1954', 'was', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'read', 'was', 'one', 'young', 'singers/actors', 'showcased', 'NEW', 'FACES', 'so', 'had', 'have', 'it.The', 'picture', 'quality', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'color', 'are', 'few', 'tiny', 'jump', 'cuts', 'here', 'there', 'picture', ""n't"", 'as', 'sharp', 'sayI', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'same', 'year', 'thereabouts', 'most', 'part', 'watchable.Most', 'unknown', 'actors', 'making', 'appearance', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'feature', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'television', 'fame', 'character', 'actors', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'Robert', 'Clary', 'really', 'steal', 'show', 'sing', 'dance', 'heart', 'Even', 'Kitt', 'only', 'dance', 'song', 'numbers', 'really', 'here', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'more', 'acting', 'NEW', 'FACES', 'probably', 'had', 'do', 'racism', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Clary', 'funny', 'diminutive', 'French', 'man', 'really', 'well.Anyway', 'Eartha', 'standards', ""C'est"", 'Si', 'Bon', 'Uska', 'Dara', 'Monotonous', 'Bal', 'Petit', 'Bal', 'absolutely', 'magnificent', 'Santa', 'Baby', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'sings', 'up', 'storm', 'really', 'something', 'see', 'Sex', 'Kitten', 'prime', 'wonder', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'referred', 'most', 'exciting', 'woman', 'world', 'movie', 'built', 'musical', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'actors', 'not', 'really', 'strong', 'storyline', 'fun', 'watch', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'NEW', 'FACES', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'fans', 'fans', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'who', 'wrote', 'sketches']",New Faces VHS

A couple of items I was especially looking forward to were cut from it and replaced by Earth Kitt singing songs she made popular after the film was made and the Revue was on stage.

242363,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6301007581,C. O. DeRiemer,"[24, 24]","Once upon a time on Broadway, long, long ago, a strange thing would periodically appear. It was sophisticated, clever, topical, with sketches and songs written and performed by some very talented people. It was called a review, and the form died out years ago. New Faces is the filmed record, with a wisp of a story line grafted on for movie goers, of a review that appeared nearly 55 years ago...New Faces of 1952. Most of the writers and artists now are either dead or retired, but New Faces made star careers for many of them.There were four key players. Ronnie Graham, with a pal named Melvin Brooks, wrote most of the sketches, several of the songs and was the lead comic actor in the show. He went on to a successful writing career in Hollywood, often working with Mel Brooks. Eartha Kitt became a sensation with her performance in New Faces of 1952. In this film she's given three additional songs which hit the charts for her after she left the Broadway show, C'est Si Bon, Santa Baby and Uskadara, as well as Monotonous. If you want to see the young Eartha Kitt at the height of her aggressive seductiveness, this is the time. Alice Ghostley was a comedienne with a distinctive style who also sang. She went on to more Broadway and then to TV. Robert Clary was a diminutive Frenchman with a big voice who parlayed New Faces into a successful nightclub and concert career in France and the U.S. Beautiful women loved to cuddle him. He sings Lucky Pierre, I'm in Love with Miss Logan and shares Love Is a Simple Thing with Kitt. Also prominent in the cast were Paul Lynde, who was first noticed here; Carol Lawrence, who was one of the dancers; and June Carroll, who wrote very good songs and knew how to sing them. Sheldon Harnick got a big boost as a Broadway lyric writer (as in Fiddler on the Roof) when Boston Beguine sung by Ghostley took off...""It was a magical night...with romance everywhere...there was something in the air...there always is in Boston.""The big highlight of the show is the production number of Fall River Hoedown, with Virginia DeLuce, a long-legged, lush blond who can kick the derby off your head, as Lizzie Borden. It's a great song, with music and lyrics by Michael Brown. Some of it goes:Yesterday in old Fall River, Mr. Andrew Borden diedAnd the got his daughter Lizzie on a charge of homicide.Some folks say she didn't do it, and others say she didBut they all agree Miss Lizzie B. was a problem sort of kid.'Cause you can't chop your poppa up in MassachusettsNot even if it's planned as a surprise.No you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts,You know how neighbors love to criticize.She got him on the sofa where he'd gone to take a snoozeAnd I hope he went to heaven' cause he wasn't wearing shoes.Lizzie kind of rearranged him with a hatchet, so they say,And then she got her mother in that same old-fashioned way.But you can't can't chop your momma up in MassachusettsNot even if you're tired of her cuisine.No, you can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts,You know it's almost sure to cause a scene.Well, they really kept her hoppin' on that busy afternoonWith both down and upstairs chopping while she hummed a ragtime tune.They really made her hustle and when all was said and done,She'd removed her mother's bustle when she wasn't wearing one.Oh you can't chop your Momma up in MassachusettsAnd then blame all the damage on the mice.No you can't chop your Momma up in Massachusetts,That kind of thing just isn't very nice.As an artifact of a long ago time, as a show with bright, funny songs and with performers who were just at the brink of solid careers, New Faces is a treasure. Unfortunately, the DVD picture leaves a lot to be desired. It's watchable, but the colors are faded, the reds and oranges bleed and the audio isn't much better. There is one extra, strictly for fans of old black and white TV shows. It's a couple of episodes of something called ""Stage Show"" from 1955. It was a Jackie Gleason production and stars Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey leading their combined orchestras, with the June Taylor Dancers and guest singers and comics. It has the quality of a poor kinescope. The one value is the big band sound of the Dorseys.",4,A Pleasurable Artifact Of Broadway In A Poor DVD Transfer,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,4192,"['Once', 'time', 'Broadway', 'long', 'long', 'ago', 'strange', 'thing', 'would', 'periodically', 'appear', 'was', 'sophisticated', 'clever', 'topical', 'sketches', 'songs', 'written', 'performed', 'very', 'talented', 'people', 'was', 'called', 'review', 'form', 'died', 'out', 'years', 'ago', 'New', 'Faces', 'filmed', 'record', 'wisp', 'story', 'line', 'grafted', 'movie', 'goers', 'review', 'appeared', 'nearly', '55', 'years', 'ago', 'New', 'Faces', '1952', 'Most', 'writers', 'artists', 'now', 'are', 'dead', 'retired', 'New', 'Faces', 'made', 'star', 'careers', 'many', 'were', 'four', 'key', 'players', 'Ronnie', 'Graham', 'pal', 'named', 'Melvin', 'Brooks', 'wrote', 'most', 'sketches', 'several', 'songs', 'was', 'lead', 'comic', 'actor', 'show', 'went', 'successful', 'writing', 'career', 'Hollywood', 'often', 'working', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'became', 'sensation', 'performance', 'New', 'Faces', '1952', 'film', 'given', 'three', 'additional', 'songs', 'hit', 'charts', 'left', 'Broadway', 'show', ""C'est"", 'Si', 'Bon', 'Santa', 'Baby', 'Uskadara', 'as', 'well', 'Monotonous', 'want', 'see', 'young', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'height', 'aggressive', 'seductiveness', 'time', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'was', 'comedienne', 'distinctive', 'style', 'who', 'also', 'sang', 'went', 'more', 'Broadway', 'then', 'TV', 'Robert', 'Clary', 'was', 'diminutive', 'Frenchman', 'big', 'voice', 'who', 'parlayed', 'New', 'Faces', 'successful', 'nightclub', 'concert', 'career', 'France', 'U.S.', 'Beautiful', 'women', 'loved', 'cuddle', 'Lucky', 'Pierre', ""'m"", 'Love', 'Miss', 'Logan', 'shares', 'Love', 'Simple', 'Thing', 'Kitt', 'Also', 'prominent', 'cast', 'were', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'noticed', 'here', 'Carol', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'dancers', 'June', 'Carroll', 'who', 'wrote', 'very', 'good', 'songs', 'knew', 'how', 'sing', 'Sheldon', 'Harnick', 'got', 'big', 'boost', 'Broadway', 'lyric', 'writer', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', 'when', 'Boston', 'Beguine', 'sung', 'Ghostley', 'took', 'off', 'was', 'magical', 'night', 'romance', 'everywhere', 'was', 'something', 'air', 'always', 'Boston', 'big', 'highlight', 'show', 'production', 'number', 'Fall', 'River', 'Hoedown', 'Virginia', 'DeLuce', 'long-legged', 'lush', 'blond', 'who', 'can', 'kick', 'derby', 'head', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'great', 'song', 'music', 'lyrics', 'Michael', 'Brown', 'Yesterday', 'old', 'Fall', 'River', 'Mr.', 'Andrew', 'Borden', 'got', 'daughter', 'Lizzie', 'charge', 'homicide.Some', 'folks', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'others', 'say', 'agree', 'Miss', 'Lizzie', 'B.', 'was', 'problem', 'sort', 'kid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'chop', 'poppa', 'up', 'MassachusettsNot', 'even', 'planned', 'surprise.No', 'ca', ""n't"", 'chop', 'poppa', 'up', 'Massachusetts', 'know', 'how', 'neighbors', 'love', 'criticize.She', 'got', 'sofa', 'where', ""'d"", 'gone', 'take', 'snoozeAnd', 'hope', 'went', 'heaven', 'cause', 'was', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'shoes.Lizzie', 'kind', 'rearranged', 'hatchet', 'say', 'then', 'got', 'mother', 'same', 'old-fashioned', 'way.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'chop', 'momma', 'up', 'MassachusettsNot', 'even', ""'re"", 'tired', 'cuisine.No', 'ca', ""n't"", 'chop', 'momma', 'up', 'Massachusetts', 'know', 'almost', 'sure', 'cause', 'scene.Well', 'really', 'kept', 'hoppin', 'busy', 'down', 'upstairs', 'chopping', 'hummed', 'ragtime', 'tune.They', 'really', 'made', 'hustle', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', ""'d"", 'removed', 'mother', 'bustle', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'one.Oh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'chop', 'Momma', 'up', 'MassachusettsAnd', 'then', 'blame', 'damage', 'mice.No', 'ca', ""n't"", 'chop', 'Momma', 'up', 'Massachusetts', 'kind', 'thing', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'nice.As', 'artifact', 'long', 'ago', 'time', 'show', 'bright', 'funny', 'songs', 'performers', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'brink', 'solid', 'careers', 'New', 'Faces', 'treasure', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'picture', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'watchable', 'colors', 'are', 'faded', 'reds', 'oranges', 'bleed', 'audio', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'one', 'extra', 'strictly', 'fans', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'shows', 'couple', 'episodes', 'something', 'called', 'Stage', 'Show', '1955', 'was', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'production', 'stars', 'Tommy', 'Jimmy', 'Dorsey', 'leading', 'combined', 'orchestras', 'June', 'Taylor', 'Dancers', 'guest', 'singers', 'comics', 'quality', 'poor', 'kinescope', 'one', 'value', 'big', 'band', 'sound', 'Dorseys']",New Faces VHS

An early Cinemeascope film, it exploited the increased width of field best seen in the full cast production numbers. This show launched several careers. Robert Clary went on principally to Hogan's Heroes. Ronny Graham appeared in several TV sitcoms and Mel Brooks movies. (Mel was a co-writer of the sketches in this show.) Paul Lynde made several comedy appearances as well as TV sitcoms and his own TV show. Alice Ghostley also went into TV sitcoms and movies, most notably ""Grease"". One of the revue's songs, ""Guess who I saw today?"", was delivered in a deadpan fashion but was to be picked up years later by Nancy Wilson who turned it into a stunning torch song. For me the star of the show was the then newly-discovered Eartha Kitt. She sings ""Santa Baby"", ""Uska Dara"", ""C'est si bon"" and the showstopper ""Monotonous"" which shows us why Orson Welles labelled her the sexiest woman on the planet.

242368,A1P08EQRTROXYA,6301007581,James M. Shertzer,"[6, 6]","OK, this ""movie"" isn't for everyone, but it's historical value can't be denied. It may be the first B'way show pretty much filmed in its entirety ... and the way it looked on stage. ""New Faces of 1952"" ran nearly a year and was the most successful of Leonard Sillman's many ""New Faces"" revues. (It was even briefly revived some 30 years later, with a different cast doing the same material.) Eartha Kitt was the show's breakout performer, but many other newcomers went on to memorable stage and tv careers, among them Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostley, Ronny Graham and Carol Lawrence (still a few years away from ""West Side Story."") In 1954, 20th Century Fox was still touting its new ultra-wide CinemaScope process and shot a number of offbeat projects demonstrating its diversity. (Among 1954's other Fox offerings was Otto Preminger's musical ""Carmen Jones""). The cast of ""New Faces"" was brought to Hollywood and the show was filmed, with a flimsy backstage plot added to tie the material together for the folks in Kansas. Five or six sketches and musical numbers were cut, and a couple of new songs added for Kitt, who had already become pop sensation. (She didn't sing her trademark ""Santa Baby"" and ""Uska Dara"" on stage.) The film was hastily made and may be the cheesiest-looking Fox musical of all time. It was a decided oddity when it came out (and I first saw it on screen at age 11.) The topical material (a spoof of Congress investigating jazz, or a jab at Southern ""degenerate"" literature) falls pretty flat now, but some of the stuff is still amusing (a spoof of ""Death of a Salesman,"" ""Golden Boy"" and other heavy-weight dramas of the time among them). The sketches have the feel of early TV programs, like ""Your Show of Shows,"" which isn't surprising since writers like Mel Brooks, who contributed to those, wrote for this show. The musical numbers fare better, though only two or three songs survived the show (""Love is a Simple Thing"" became Jack Paar's theme song on his ""Tonight"" show, and ""Lizzie Borden"" - the film's liveliest number - was a Chad Mitchell Trio standard.) Apparently Fox did not renew the copyright on the film and it's fallen into public domain. It's surprising any copies remain out there, but at least one print was found and a couple of DVD companies have used it. It's not a very good one; the color from the DeLuxe process has faded and shifted, and the film appears not to be entirely intact.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[9, 9]","NEW FACES is not really a ""movie"".Although it did play in theaters back in 1954, the picture is more of a filmed record of NEW FACES OF 1952, the hit Broadway revue from which it's adapted.  The film's producers have added a slight framing story, but what is on the screen is, essentially, a series of musical numbers and skits strung together, performed by the original cast.What made this stage production so memorable is that it was the vehicle that launched the careers of such stellar talents as Eartha Kitt, Robert Clary, Paul Lynde, Carol Lawrence, Alice Ghostley and Ronny Graham, as well as Mel Brooks, who wrote several of the skits.Frankly, with the exception of a sketch inspired by DEATH OF A SALESMAN that features Paul Lynde as a ""Willy Loman"" who makes his living as a pick-pocket, time has not been kind to the comedy skits in NEW FACES.  What might have been funny back in 1954 falls flat today.On the other hand, most of the musical numbers are still delightful, particularly ""Santa Baby"" and ""Monotonous,"" performed by the sultry Ms. Kitt, ""I'm in Love with Miss Logan"" (Clary), ""Penny Candy"" (June Carroll) and the melodic ""Love Is a Simple Thing"" (Carroll, Clary and Kitt).  However, my personal favorite is ""Lizzie Borden,"" performed by most of the cast.  It's a tune that I find myself often humming to myself.This new widescreen version of NEW FACES from VCI Entertainment has been digitally remastered and is the best available on DVD. Michael B.

""New Faces"" was a Broadway hit in 1952; Fox had it filmed as a showcase for its CinemaScope process.  Over the years, the rights lapsed and the original elements were forgotten or mislaid or whatever happens to irreplaceable cultural artifacts in the Bermuda Triangle of studios' film vaults.  All we have of ""New Faces"" at present is this dreadful public-domain transfer, muddy and grainy and with wildly varying sound quality.  That should be terminal, but ""New Faces"" is so much fun it's worth putting up with every flaw of this release.  ""New Faces"" launched the careers of Eartha Kitt, Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostley, Carol Lawrence, Robert Clary and a number of other stars and writers; it's a considerable pleasure to see all of them in the full flush of youth, punch-drunk in love with performing.  Since ""New Faces"" was a straightforward filming of a stage show instead of the usual screen adaptation of a Broadway musical, the feeling of live performance is present.  It's a revelation to see a twenty-year-old Carol Lawrence capering and cavorting through ""Lucky Pierre"" with Robert Clary; it's nominally his number, but it's easy to see that nothing and nobody was going to prevent Lawrence becoming a star.  Surprises abound; Lawrence dances, and Alice Ghostley displays a fine singing voice, albeit one deployed in the service of high-camp comedy.  Eartha Kitt steals the show with several songs, including her famous ""Monotonous,"" and ""Santa Baby,"" not in the Broadway run of the show, but interpolated here because Kitt had made it so famous.  And even with the atrocious print and transfer, the cinematography (by Lucien Ballard), can be seen to have been wonderful once.  It's one of my fondest wishes that Fox will one day find this title in its vault holdings and give it a proper restoration and DVD or Blu-Ray release.  Until then, overlook this release's faults, and delight in a rare look at a classic Broadway revue.",3,"Sparkling Show, Appalling Transfer",1304035200,"04 29, 2011",2011,2158,"['One', 'fondest', 'dreams', 'someone', 'someday', 'will', 'be', 'trawling', 'vaults', 'Twentieth', 'Century-Fox', 'will', 'find', 'negative', 'interpositives', 'New', 'Faces', 'original', 'mag', 'tapes', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'New', 'Faces', 'was', 'Broadway', 'hit', '1952', 'Fox', 'had', 'filmed', 'showcase', 'CinemaScope', 'process', 'years', 'rights', 'lapsed', 'original', 'elements', 'were', 'forgotten', 'mislaid', 'irreplaceable', 'cultural', 'artifacts', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'studios', 'film', 'vaults', 'have', 'New', 'Faces', 'present', 'dreadful', 'public-domain', 'transfer', 'muddy', 'grainy', 'wildly', 'varying', 'sound', 'quality', 'should', 'be', 'terminal', 'New', 'Faces', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'worth', 'putting', 'up', 'flaw', 'release', 'New', 'Faces', 'launched', 'careers', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'Carol', 'Lawrence', 'Robert', 'Clary', 'number', 'other', 'stars', 'writers', 'considerable', 'pleasure', 'see', 'full', 'flush', 'youth', 'punch-drunk', 'love', 'performing', 'New', 'Faces', 'was', 'straightforward', 'filming', 'stage', 'show', 'instead', 'usual', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'feeling', 'live', 'performance', 'present', 'revelation', 'see', 'twenty-year-old', 'Carol', 'Lawrence', 'capering', 'cavorting', 'Lucky', 'Pierre', 'Robert', 'Clary', 'nominally', 'number', 'easy', 'see', 'nothing', 'nobody', 'was', 'going', 'prevent', 'Lawrence', 'becoming', 'star', 'abound', 'Lawrence', 'dances', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'fine', 'singing', 'voice', 'one', 'deployed', 'service', 'high-camp', 'comedy', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'show', 'several', 'songs', 'including', 'famous', 'Monotonous', 'Santa', 'Baby', 'not', 'Broadway', 'run', 'show', 'interpolated', 'here', 'Kitt', 'had', 'made', 'so', 'famous', 'even', 'atrocious', 'print', 'transfer', 'cinematography', 'Lucien', 'Ballard', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'once', 'one', 'fondest', 'wishes', 'Fox', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'title', 'vault', 'holdings', 'give', 'proper', 'restoration', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'then', 'release', 'faults', 'delight', 'rare', 'look', 'classic', 'Broadway', 'revue']",New Faces VHS
