I feel that this DVD goes against some of what I have found to be biblically accurate. It is well put together and well produced, but all portions are not in-line with the bible. I believe there are some inaccuracies. Watch this production with caution and use your Bible to verify the information it gives you.",3,I question its biblical accuracy,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,421,"['years', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'movies', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'include', 'Bible', 'end', 'time', 'prophecy', 'feel', 'DVD', 'what', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'biblically', 'accurate', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'well', 'produced', 'portions', 'are', 'not', 'in-line', 'bible', 'believe', 'are', 'inaccuracies', 'Watch', 'production', 'caution', 'use', 'Bible', 'verify', 'information']",N/A

For instance, while angles agree where the ""catching away"" is concerned, they contrast where judgment is concerned(ie, the production suggests that those ""outside the gate"" will be faced with their own sins and all be unrepented and thus condemned, while I've heard other perspectives suggest that they'll be given space to repent when the Spirit and the Bride say 'Come.') But overall, another very insightful piece from SDA and a worthy investment for those who enjoy studies of the word.",3,"Outstanding Production, But One of Several SDA Angles...",1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,1076,"['viewed', 'heels', 'predecessor', 'COSMIC', 'CONFLICT', 'ORIGIN', 'OF', 'EVIL', 'Doug', 'Batchelor', 'was', 'case', 'COSMIC', 'CONFLICT', 'was', 'impressed', 'outstanding', 'production', 'biblical', 'insight', 'presentation', 'Doug', 'Batchelor', 'SDA', 'angle', 'culmination', 'things', 'aka', 'end', 'age', 'end', 'days', 'etc', 'what', 'was', 'covered', 'again', 'seemed', 'pull', 'as', 'much', 'SDA', 'interpretations', 'scripture', 'did', 'scripture', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'way', ""'ve"", 'heard/read', 'OTHER', 'SDA', 'contrast', 'particular', 'angle', 'bit', 'instance', 'angles', 'agree', 'where', 'catching', 'away', 'concerned', 'contrast', 'where', 'judgment', 'concerned', 'ie', 'production', 'gate', 'will', 'be', 'faced', 'own', 'sins', 'be', 'unrepented', 'thus', 'condemned', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'other', 'perspectives', 'suggest', ""'ll"", 'be', 'given', 'space', 'repent', 'when', 'Spirit', 'Bride', 'say', 'overall', 'very', 'insightful', 'piece', 'SDA', 'worthy', 'investment', 'who', 'enjoy', 'studies', 'word']",N/A
