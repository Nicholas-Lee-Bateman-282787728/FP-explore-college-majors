Perhaps the makers of this DVD purposely submitted the wrong information to Amazon to help generate some sales... If it works, why not?  Well, they certainly fooled me.  Like others, I certainly would have avoided this product had I known the truth.  One can tell by the picture distortions that it was a VHS camera used for all the fly-overs.  The true copyright is 1991, so this was taped over 20 years ago.
