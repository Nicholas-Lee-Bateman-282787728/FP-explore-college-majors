553750,A1LGDLGQXO4XO0,B00004W46O,Jackie Morton,"[0, 0]","I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that Casper, The Friendly Ghost, is home for the holidays in this spooktacular adventure! Casper is tasked to scare at least one person before Christmas Day. As usual, the kind hearted Casper has a hard time trying to scare anyone, so The Ghostly Trio hires Casper's identical cousin, Spooky, to do the job. What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.",5,CASPER'S HAUNTED CHRISTMAS,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,499,"['choose', 'rating', 'movie', 'good', 'What', 'like', 'movie', 'Casper', 'Friendly', 'Ghost', 'home', 'holidays', 'spooktacular', 'adventure', 'Casper', 'tasked', 'scare', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'usual', 'kind', 'hearted', 'Casper', 'hard', 'time', 'trying', 'scare', 'anyone', 'Ghostly', 'Trio', 'Casper', 'identical', 'cousin', 'Spooky', 'do', 'job', 'What', 'dislike', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'other', 'people']",N/A
