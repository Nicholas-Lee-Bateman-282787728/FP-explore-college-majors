It is a political thriller with sad overtunes which remines one of the Spanish Civil War and Hamingway's For Whom the Bells Toll.  Also, it is ironic that Cuba, like most Latin countries, has never been mature to develop a democracy.  After the dictatorship in 1933, which is the subject of this movie, came Castro with his brutal communist dictatorship which has been much worse than the 'right wing' dictatorships of the past. And we are going toward the same fate here in the USA.",5,"A forgotten, underrated film noir",1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,579,"['one', 'forgotten', 'A', 'film', 'noirs', '40', 'excellent', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'political', 'thriller', 'sad', 'overtunes', 'remines', 'one', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'Hamingway', 'Whom', 'Bells', 'Toll', 'Also', 'ironic', 'Cuba', 'most', 'Latin', 'countries', 'never', 'been', 'mature', 'develop', 'democracy', 'dictatorship', '1933', 'subject', 'movie', 'came', 'Castro', 'brutal', 'communist', 'dictatorship', 'been', 'much', 'worse', ""'right"", 'wing', 'dictatorships', 'past', 'are', 'going', 'same', 'fate', 'here', 'USA']",We Were Strangers
876381,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00070HK42,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Released in 1949, WE WERE STRANGERS had the misfortune to run into the Communist Witchhunt on two counts. The first was actor John Garfield, a liberal who defied the House Unamerican Activities Committee at the height of its dark powers. The second was the film itself, which a presented a group of leftist Cuban militants in a sympathetic light as they worked up a terrorist plot to overthrow a repressive right-wing government. Garfield was blacklisted by the film industry for his refusal to play ball with HUAC and he died of heart attack at age 39 in 1952. WE WERE STRANGERS was not as popular as director John Huston's earlier or later movies, it received mixed reviews at the time, and it quickly disappeared from theatres. The rare television showing aside, the film virtually disappeared for fifty years--and particularly so after the assasination of John F. Kennedy in 1963.The story is based on the 1933 overthrow of right-wing Cuban dictator Gerardo Machado y Morales, who was ultimately toppled from power by United States influences working Cuba--which is exactly what the film shows.  China Valdez (Jennifer Jones) witnesses the murder of her brother by a government official and is radicalized as a result.  She is determined to murder her brother's killer, but she falls into a group insurrectionists who have a wider plan: the overthrow of the government itself. The team, which is merely a cell of a larger organization, includes Cuban-American John Fenner (John Garfield), Armondo (Pedro Armendariz), Guillermo (Gilbert Roland), and ""the chief"" (Roman Novarro.)  They plan to dig a tunnel from China's house to a nearby cemetary, where they will plant a bomb; then, when they assasinate a notable figure and his funeral draws dignitaries--including the president--to the funeral, they will kill them all with the explosion.The film is unexpectedly brutal, gritty, and noir-ish for 1949; it feels much more like a film from the late 1950s than a film from the late 1940s.  The cell members discuss whether or not it is right to kill innocent women and children in order to topple the government; somewhat later, when the target of the assasination is revealed, one of the cell members is upset to find he actually knows the man they plan to kill in order to draw the president to the funeral.  To further complicate the plot, John and China fall in love, but China becomes an issue for the terrorists when she accidentally draws the attentions of the same man who killed her brother.  There is not a false note in the cast.  The notion of Jennifer Jones playing a Cuban woman is off-putting in the abstract, but she gives one of the best performances of her career; Garfield, Roland, and Novarro are memorable, but this very much her film.Several sources state that Lee Harvey Oswald watched WE WERE STRANGERS at least twice in October of 1963, about a month before he assasinated President John F. Kennedy, and his wife Marina later reported that he had been greatly excited by the film. There has been a rumor that the film had a copycat effect on Oswald, who had suspected ties to Cuba, in his decision to kill Kennedy. It will certainly be of interest to the many who study the Kennedy assasination. Whatever the case, it is a memorable film, an often powerful film, and one that I strongly recommend to fans of its stars and directors--and to movie fans in general.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,Forgotten But Brilliant,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,3409,"['Released', '1949', 'WE', 'WERE', 'STRANGERS', 'had', 'misfortune', 'run', 'Communist', 'Witchhunt', 'two', 'counts', 'first', 'was', 'actor', 'John', 'Garfield', 'liberal', 'who', 'defied', 'House', 'Unamerican', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'height', 'dark', 'powers', 'second', 'was', 'film', 'presented', 'group', 'leftist', 'Cuban', 'militants', 'sympathetic', 'light', 'worked', 'up', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'overthrow', 'repressive', 'right-wing', 'government', 'Garfield', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'film', 'industry', 'refusal', 'play', 'ball', 'HUAC', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'age', '39', '1952', 'WE', 'WERE', 'STRANGERS', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'popular', 'director', 'John', 'Huston', 'earlier', 'later', 'movies', 'received', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'time', 'quickly', 'disappeared', 'theatres', 'rare', 'television', 'showing', 'aside', 'film', 'virtually', 'disappeared', 'fifty', 'years', 'particularly', 'so', 'assasination', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', '1963.The', 'story', 'based', '1933', 'overthrow', 'right-wing', 'Cuban', 'dictator', 'Gerardo', 'Machado', 'y', 'Morales', 'who', 'was', 'ultimately', 'toppled', 'power', 'United', 'States', 'influences', 'working', 'Cuba', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'shows', 'China', 'Valdez', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'murder', 'brother', 'government', 'official', 'radicalized', 'result', 'determined', 'murder', 'brother', 'killer', 'group', 'insurrectionists', 'who', 'have', 'wider', 'plan', 'overthrow', 'government', 'team', 'merely', 'cell', 'larger', 'organization', 'Cuban-American', 'John', 'Fenner', 'John', 'Garfield', 'Armondo', 'Pedro', 'Armendariz', 'Guillermo', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'chief', 'Roman', 'Novarro', 'plan', 'dig', 'tunnel', 'China', 'house', 'nearby', 'cemetary', 'where', 'will', 'plant', 'bomb', 'then', 'when', 'assasinate', 'notable', 'figure', 'funeral', 'draws', 'dignitaries', 'including', 'president', 'funeral', 'will', 'kill', 'explosion.The', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'brutal', 'gritty', 'noir-ish', '1949', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'late', '1950s', 'film', 'late', '1940s', 'cell', 'members', 'discuss', 'not', 'right', 'kill', 'innocent', 'women', 'children', 'order', 'topple', 'government', 'somewhat', 'later', 'when', 'target', 'assasination', 'revealed', 'one', 'cell', 'members', 'upset', 'find', 'actually', 'man', 'plan', 'kill', 'order', 'draw', 'president', 'funeral', 'further', 'complicate', 'plot', 'John', 'China', 'fall', 'love', 'China', 'issue', 'terrorists', 'when', 'accidentally', 'attentions', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'brother', 'not', 'false', 'note', 'cast', 'notion', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'playing', 'Cuban', 'woman', 'off-putting', 'abstract', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'Garfield', 'Roland', 'Novarro', 'are', 'memorable', 'very', 'much', 'film.Several', 'sources', 'state', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'watched', 'WE', 'WERE', 'STRANGERS', 'least', 'twice', 'October', '1963', 'month', 'assasinated', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'wife', 'Marina', 'later', 'reported', 'had', 'been', 'greatly', 'excited', 'film', 'been', 'rumor', 'film', 'had', 'copycat', 'effect', 'Oswald', 'who', 'had', 'suspected', 'ties', 'Cuba', 'decision', 'kill', 'Kennedy', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'interest', 'many', 'who', 'study', 'Kennedy', 'assasination', 'case', 'memorable', 'film', 'often', 'powerful', 'film', 'one', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'stars', 'directors', 'movie', 'fans', 'general.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",We Were Strangers

876384,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,B00070HK42,Phillip Oliver,"[10, 11]","In between making the classics ""Treasure of the Sierre Madre"" (1948) and ""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950), John Huston made ""We Were Strangers,"" which virtually vanished and was never released on VHS and seldom shown on television. At the time of the film's release, which was right at the beginning of the HUAC Committee and American  political paranoia, it predictably received unfavorable and questionable attention. It was released in April of 1949 but audiences were perplexed by it and it quickly vanished from theaters.Based on the overthrow of Cuban dictator Geraldo Machado Morales in 1933, the story is about a group of revolutionaries who plot to bring down their corrupt government. China (pronounced Cheena) Valdez witnesses her brother's murder after he distributes leftist pamphlets and vows that she will kill his assassin. At his funeral, however, she is persuaded to join an underground group whose motives are more carefully orchestrated. China's house is next door to a cemetery and the leader of the group (John Garfield) devises a scheme to assasinate an official whose family plot is in the cemetery and detonate a bomb at the man's funeral thereby killing as many officials as possible. To do this, they must dig a tunnel from China's house to the cemetery. Most of the movie is concentrated on the digging of the tunnel as Garfield and Jones' develop a romantic interest in each other. However, the film never lets the romantic issues overpower the film's basic purposes of depicting the desperateness of the Cuban terrorists and the film ends with a violent and exciting shoot-out sequence.The film often suffers in a few places from sluggish pacing but the performances are all first rate. Jennifer Jones, doing a convincing Cuban accent, is radiant but intense as China and has good chemisty with Garfield. The supporting players are unusually fine. Pedro Armendariz, as the corrupt police chief, is deliciously menacing. Look for silent greats Gilbert Roland and Ramon Navarro in strong supporting parts as members of the resistance. Look for a cameo appearance by director John Huston who appears as a bank teller.Many of the film's outdoor scenes are shot against rear projections, which are quite noticable. The film, however, achieves an almost documentary-like feel with its stark black and white photography.This high definition dvd transfer is very good with excellent contrast and a minimum of softness and grain. There are a few noticable specks and scratches but nothing to warrant any serious complaints.
