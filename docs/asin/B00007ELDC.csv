The movie is about this guy who gets sent a mysterious (( totem )) sent to him in the mail and he takes it to a shop to find out what its worth and what it is and in the process learns some information about the powers it holds. When he goes home he makes 3 wishes and it leads to a series of events and mysterious killings start happening and noone knows who is doing the killing and you never think it is that person that is actually doing it- i was suprised at the end. so this is a unique film its dif than ur average teen slasher like i said-its very creative , unique original film and i recomend it- it was fun to watch.",4,good movie,1054598400,"06 3, 2003",2003,1076,"['suprisingly', 'good', 'movie', 'i', 'thought', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'other', 'teen', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'i', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'unique', 'film', '.i', 'thought', 'killings', 'were', 'clever', 'way', 'had', 'diff', 'ideas', 'just', 'ur', 'average', 'killing', 'knife', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'killings', 'were', 'creative', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'cool', 'killings', 'actually', 'looked', 'real', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'idea', 'whole', 'plot', 'charcters', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'sent', 'mysterious', 'totem', 'sent', 'mail', 'shop', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'worth', 'what', 'process', 'information', 'powers', 'When', 'home', '3', 'wishes', 'series', 'events', 'mysterious', 'killings', 'start', 'happening', 'noone', 'knows', 'who', 'doing', 'killing', 'never', 'think', 'person', 'actually', 'doing', 'it-', 'i', 'was', 'suprised', 'end', 'unique', 'film', 'dif', 'ur', 'average', 'teen', 'slasher', 'i', 'said-its', 'very', 'creative', 'unique', 'original', 'film', 'i', 'recomend', 'it-', 'was', 'fun', 'watch']",Wishcraft
727390,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00007ELDC,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[0, 3]","""Be careful what you wish for"". What an original catchphrase for a movie.School geek Brett Bumpers (with a name like that it's hardly surprising) is in love with the Prom Queen, Samantha. He tutors her but of course she doesn't have the time of day for him because he's a loser who drives a wimpy... moped and she's a cheerleader.But one day Brett arrives home from school to find a package containing a strange artefact which will grant him three wishes. Naturally he wishes for Samantha to fall in love with him, but soon things start getting stranger than usual and Brett's enemies start falling victim to a cowled and hooded ax murderer... who soon sets his sights on Samantha. As for the rest, you know the drill; or in this case, ax. Still, it's not a bad movie for killing time. The production values are good but if I had three wishes one would be for no sequels to this movie to get made. Just look at the PUPPET MASTER and WITCHCRAFT movies (at least 11 of them!!) for examples. (No relation to WISHCRAFT, but could that be a bad omen?).The actual unmasking of the killer is pretty daft and the killers explaination for his (or is it her?) actions will have viewers chuckling. The movie even goes so far as to steal the voice changing gadget idea from the SCREAM trilogy. No prizes for originality there. The conclusion is also more drawn out than it needed to be.The movie's highlight would have to be the death-by-bowling-ball scene. Meat Loaf co-stars as a sheriff under the name Michael Aday (I thought his name was Marvin?) and squeaky voiced Zelda Rubinstein from ANGUISH appears as a coroner who has the intelligent line: ""Jimbo was alive when the killer took his head off"".(Really?).",2,How many more teen horror movies do we have to put up with?,1038528000,"11 29, 2002",2002,1701,"['Be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'What', 'original', 'catchphrase', 'movie.School', 'geek', 'Brett', 'Bumpers', 'name', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'love', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'Samantha', 'course', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'day', 'loser', 'who', 'wimpy', 'moped', 'cheerleader.But', 'one', 'day', 'Brett', 'home', 'school', 'find', 'package', 'containing', 'strange', 'artefact', 'will', 'grant', 'three', 'wishes', 'Naturally', 'Samantha', 'fall', 'love', 'soon', 'things', 'start', 'getting', 'stranger', 'usual', 'Brett', 'enemies', 'start', 'falling', 'victim', 'cowled', 'hooded', 'ax', 'murderer', 'who', 'soon', 'sights', 'Samantha', 'rest', 'know', 'drill', 'case', 'ax', 'Still', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'killing', 'time', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'had', 'three', 'wishes', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'sequels', 'movie', 'get', 'made', 'Just', 'look', 'PUPPET', 'MASTER', 'WITCHCRAFT', 'movies', 'least', '11', 'examples', 'relation', 'WISHCRAFT', 'could', 'be', 'bad', 'omen', '.The', 'actual', 'unmasking', 'killer', 'pretty', 'daft', 'killers', 'explaination', 'actions', 'will', 'have', 'viewers', 'chuckling', 'movie', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'steal', 'voice', 'changing', 'gadget', 'idea', 'SCREAM', 'trilogy', 'prizes', 'originality', 'there', 'conclusion', 'also', 'more', 'out', 'needed', 'be.The', 'movie', 'highlight', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'death-by-bowling-ball', 'scene', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'co-stars', 'sheriff', 'name', 'Michael', 'Aday', 'thought', 'name', 'was', 'Marvin', 'voiced', 'Zelda', 'Rubinstein', 'ANGUISH', 'coroner', 'who', 'intelligent', 'line', 'Jimbo', 'was', 'alive', 'when', 'killer', 'took', 'head', 'Really']",Wishcraft
727391,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00007ELDC,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Wishcraft is a pretty fun movie, but the one thing that sort of bugged me while watching it was the obvious lack of decent murders. I mean, one teenager is buried in the dirt and struck in the head with a bowling ball, and another is stabbed to death in a park after a lengthy scene involving immaturity and exaggeration. The only truly decent death is the one involving a teenage girl hanging from a cord beside the traffic signals.The storyline is touched upon just enough to do the job and give the viewers something watchable. It was a spoof on the ""make three wishes and your dreams will come true"" fairy tales, but done in a much darker tone dealing with death and murders. I guess it was executed fairly, but I expected more.The acting is good, and Zelda Rubenstein is incredibly spooky like always (even though she only appeared once and that was briefly) but I don't know... Meat Loaf playing the role of a police investigator is really strange. He wasn't believable enough to be a major threat or an intimidating factor if you ask me. All the lead characters were just so-so in their acting abilities.The ""killer dressed up as death"" gimmick has definitely run its course (especially concerning annual Halloween costumes!) but I guess back in 2001 it wasn't really a big deal.No, Wishcraft isn't the least bit frightening, and it has dated pretty poorly I believe. At least, what was once a film with a decent horror atmosphere is definitely no more, and it's a shame.",3,crafty? nah,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,1478,"['Wishcraft', 'pretty', 'fun', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'sort', 'bugged', 'watching', 'was', 'obvious', 'lack', 'decent', 'murders', 'mean', 'one', 'teenager', 'buried', 'dirt', 'struck', 'head', 'bowling', 'ball', 'stabbed', 'death', 'park', 'lengthy', 'scene', 'involving', 'immaturity', 'exaggeration', 'only', 'truly', 'decent', 'death', 'one', 'involving', 'teenage', 'girl', 'hanging', 'cord', 'traffic', 'signals.The', 'storyline', 'touched', 'just', 'enough', 'do', 'job', 'give', 'viewers', 'something', 'watchable', 'was', 'spoof', 'make', 'three', 'wishes', 'dreams', 'will', 'come', 'true', 'fairy', 'tales', 'done', 'much', 'darker', 'tone', 'dealing', 'death', 'murders', 'guess', 'was', 'executed', 'fairly', 'expected', 'more.The', 'acting', 'good', 'Zelda', 'Rubenstein', 'incredibly', 'spooky', 'always', 'even', 'only', 'appeared', 'once', 'was', 'briefly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'playing', 'role', 'police', 'investigator', 'really', 'strange', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'enough', 'be', 'major', 'threat', 'intimidating', 'factor', 'ask', 'lead', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'so-so', 'acting', 'killer', 'dressed', 'up', 'death', 'gimmick', 'definitely', 'run', 'course', 'especially', 'concerning', 'annual', 'Halloween', 'costumes', 'guess', 'back', '2001', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'big', 'deal.No', 'Wishcraft', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'frightening', 'dated', 'pretty', 'poorly', 'believe', 'least', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'film', 'decent', 'horror', 'definitely', 'more', 'shame']",Wishcraft

Although great teen horror existed before in other movies and the great 'buffy the vampire slayer' tv series to name a classic. This one fufills the fantasy of every  young guy to wish that the super hotgal will be HIS girl. And in this movie the gal is a nice person to begin with! That's what makes this better to a degree that the characters are good. The other teen characters though are not as well defined and only serve to die deaths that are off camera. which only proves that the horror element is not the real purpose here. In fact this may have been pitched as without any death at all to begin with. The bullies would get their comeupance and the boy would win the girl. But it's still a horror movie regardless if that's not the real focus of the flick. The reason being even if you don't see people die other than a few deaths , getting murdered is still horrible!. THe acting of the two leads is very well done and I would bet many a young man fell for the girl character. If not the actrees hereself. THe budget is typical for a b movie and it has meatloaf in it too as a police cheif. This is not a c movie though made by first timers without experience , people confuse b and c movies all the time.
