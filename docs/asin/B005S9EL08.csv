1500106,A3LW6FZ12WUX2A,B005S9EL08,"4MaskCurse ""Kyonshi Jiang Shi""","[14, 36]","...only not as pleasant!Imagine the movie Ishtar and combine it with Leonard Part 6. Now tack on The Super Mario Bros. Movie,mix with Freddy Got Fingered and add a heaping helping of Jaws:The Revenge, Joe Versus The Volcano and The Garbage Pail Kids. Think that would be a piece of crap? Just wait until you take a whiff of this cinematic turd.I honestly don't know what Hollywood AKA Shallowwood is thinking anymore when it comes to crediting the average schmoe off the street with common sense.First off,I'm not writing this review because I am a ""stooge-hater"" ""anti-stooge"" or think that slapstick is stupid. Quite the contrary,I grew up in the 80s and every saturday night as a kid from 10:30 at night to 1 a.m. the stooges were on channel 11. Fastforward to 2012 and we get this mess...1.)The stooges never emplemented ""toilet humor""--whenever I watched the trio on tv,they never farted or talked about ""boogers.""2.)The stooges were always about yukking it up at the cost of their own selves;they never bashed a religon and they did not promote an ideology--unless you want to count Moe Howard's take on Hitler during war time,in which case you would be defending Nazisim,in which case you would be an idiot.Oh yeah! What a great family movie to bring the kiddies too! Ha!Ha!Ha! A nun takes a churchbell to the head! Ha!Ha!Ha! A nun gets a stooge poke to the eyes! Ha!Ha!Ha! First off this is really dumb,because all three stooges were Jewish. Secondly whenever there was a ""save the poor orphanage from the mean ol' tax collector"" scenario,it was never tied into a religous background. This was just a disrespectful act promoted by yet another anti-Christian/anti-Catholic lemming from Hollyweird.Imagine how the Muslim community would have reacted if Alah took a poke in the eyes by Moe,or if Muhammad took a few jabs from Larry? The three actors who played the three stooges would have become the three dead bodies.3.) This is Blues Brothers 2000 and The New Pink Panther all over again. John Goodman could not replace John Belushi,Steve Martin could not fill the shoes of Peter Sellers and Wingus,Dingus and FruitLoops (don't know the actual names of these ""actors"" and I don't care either) couldn't even come close to breathing life back into the old hollywood legends. How many failures does it take these film producers to learn that once the greats are gone,they cannot be reanimated--and certainly not when a new brand of ""humor"" is shackled around that persona's ankles.If you want to introduce your kids to the comic stylings of the stooges,then show them THE REAL THING and pass on this 2012 mutilation. More fun and alot less crude garbage and militant propoganda. Oh,and I'm pretty sure Curly never tried to perform Heimlich on a dolphin....",1,Like two weeks without a bowel movement.....,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,2761,"['only', 'not', 'pleasant', 'Imagine', 'movie', 'Ishtar', 'combine', 'Leonard', 'Part', '6', 'Now', 'tack', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', 'Movie', 'mix', 'Freddy', 'Got', 'Fingered', 'add', 'heaping', 'helping', 'Jaws', 'Revenge', 'Joe', 'Versus', 'Volcano', 'Garbage', 'Pail', 'Kids', 'Think', 'would', 'be', 'piece', 'crap', 'Just', 'wait', 'take', 'whiff', 'cinematic', 'turd.I', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'AKA', 'Shallowwood', 'thinking', 'anymore', 'when', 'crediting', 'average', 'schmoe', 'street', 'common', 'sense.First', ""'m"", 'not', 'writing', 'review', 'am', 'stooge-hater', 'anti-stooge', 'think', 'slapstick', 'stupid', 'contrary', 'grew', 'up', '80s', 'saturday', 'night', 'kid', '10:30', 'night', '1', 'a.m.', 'stooges', 'were', 'channel', '11', 'Fastforward', '2012', 'get', 'mess', '1', 'stooges', 'never', 'emplemented', 'toilet', 'humor', 'whenever', 'watched', 'trio', 'tv', 'never', 'farted', 'talked', 'boogers.', '2', 'stooges', 'were', 'always', 'yukking', 'up', 'cost', 'own', 'selves', 'never', 'bashed', 'religon', 'did', 'not', 'promote', 'ideology', 'want', 'count', 'Moe', 'Howard', 'take', 'Hitler', 'war', 'time', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'defending', 'Nazisim', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'idiot.Oh', 'yeah', 'What', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'bring', 'kiddies', 'too', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'A', 'nun', 'churchbell', 'head', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'nun', 'stooge', 'poke', 'eyes', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'First', 'really', 'dumb', 'three', 'stooges', 'were', 'Jewish', 'Secondly', 'whenever', 'was', 'save', 'poor', 'orphanage', 'mean', 'ol', 'tax', 'collector', 'scenario', 'was', 'never', 'tied', 'religous', 'background', 'was', 'just', 'disrespectful', 'act', 'promoted', 'yet', 'anti-Christian/anti-Catholic', 'lemming', 'Hollyweird.Imagine', 'how', 'Muslim', 'community', 'would', 'have', 'reacted', 'Alah', 'took', 'poke', 'eyes', 'Moe', 'Muhammad', 'took', 'few', 'jabs', 'Larry', 'three', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'three', 'stooges', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'three', 'dead', 'bodies.3', 'Blues', 'Brothers', '2000', 'New', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'John', 'Goodman', 'could', 'not', 'replace', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'could', 'not', 'fill', 'shoes', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Wingus', 'Dingus', 'FruitLoops', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actual', 'names', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'breathing', 'life', 'back', 'old', 'hollywood', 'legends', 'How', 'many', 'failures', 'take', 'film', 'producers', 'learn', 'once', 'greats', 'are', 'gone', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'reanimated', 'certainly', 'not', 'when', 'new', 'brand', 'humor', 'shackled', 'persona', 'ankles.If', 'want', 'introduce', 'kids', 'comic', 'stylings', 'stooges', 'then', 'show', 'REAL', 'THING', 'pass', '2012', 'mutilation', 'More', 'fun', 'alot', 'less', 'crude', 'garbage', 'militant', 'propoganda', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Curly', 'never', 'tried', 'perform', 'Heimlich', 'dolphin']",N/A

This film is such a great throwback to the original shorts, using many of the original gags, quotes, mannerisms and such, not to mention that in a couple scenes you can tell when its Dummies just like in the shorts! i thought that was very funny. One thing they couldve done without is putting those Morons from The Jersey Shore in the film, that was just stupid and i suppose it was only to Appeal to the new generation but its forgiveable as they aren't in the film for that long and Moe gives em what for. My favorite part of the film is without a doubt Will Sasso's role as Curly. He gives such a great performance and gets everything down perfectly. I'm sure the man himself would've been proud.

My only complaint, and it's a small one, is this modern Larry Fine doesn't get the funniest lines as the original did (""Look! An inkwell!"").It's incredible how skilled these guys are and how much they resemble the Stooges. Their synchronicity in timing slaps, eyepokes and shovels to the sconce is impeccable and when they get going all out they're as funny as Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard ever were. It's a movie that's perfect for home viewing, BTW. I laughed throughout!My favorite sight gag (of about 50) is the boys accidentally unloosing a large brass bell from its tower. The bell slides down an inclined roof and hits on the top of the dome the nosy nun (played by Larry David in drag) that's been hounding our knuckleheads since the film's beginning. Naturally, there's a loud BONG! when it happens. The Stooges peer over the roof's edge and see the unconscious nun spreadeagled on the lawn. A classic ""Nyaaah!"" reaction shot.Moe says, ""Uh-oh, is that Sister Mary-Mengele?"" and Curly shoots back in his inimitable falsetto, ""I dunno, but the face rings a bell!""You've gotta love stuff like that.This Farrelly brothers farce is divided into three ""shorts"" but it's all one story. Each opens with recreations of one of the several beloved ""Stooge"" themes. Before we reach the finale (then the Farrellys warning little kids not to hit anyone with a hammer or poke an eye), we see a peeing newborn fight in a maternity ward, the boys plummeting from a multi-storey building, a little girl suspended in air by party balloons who lands butt-first in a gorgeous cake, also the usual crab latched onto a nose, Curly destroying a chainsaw's teeth with his iron forehead, Moe ripping out Larry's hair, Curly running in a circle while laying on his side and all the other zaniness we expect from these chowderheads.But there's a bonus for all fans (and haters) of a certain reality TV show set on the coast of a herein unnamed Mid-Atlantic State (don't miss this part-- it's hilarious!).If you're in the mood for some real ""nyuks,"" rent or buy THE THREE STOOGES - The Movie.

1500121,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005S9EL08,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I believe a huge shout out HAS to go to the movie writers and directors.  They made sure Moe, Larry and Curly were incredibly faithful to their original characters that many of us grew up watching and loving.  I've always said the Three Stooges is the funniest show you'll ever see in black and white, and the movie version does NOT disappoint.There's a couple amazing things about this movie.  I find it interesting that Moe, Larry and Curly still act like they did back in the 30's, 40's and 50's when they became successful, and yet, they're introduced to a new world with computer technology, cell phones and twitter.  The film mentions many of these things.  It really IS the Stooges brought into the current world.Another surprising highlight is how Moe and Larry look EXACTLY like the real Moe Howard and Larry Fine.  What are the odds that two people who look exactly like the originals could not only be found, but play the role of Moe Howard and Larry Fine so convincingly accurate?  It's not like you see Moe's walking down the street everyday- I've seen a few people that resemble Moe, but never to a startling extent like the guy in this movie.  The same applies to Larry.  As for Curly, well, thousands of people look like him so that wasn't really a hard find.My point here is that it's a minor miracle that not do these guys look like Moe, Larry and Curly, but are able to *act* extremely close to them as well.I guess some people might not like the fact that Shemp isn't in the movie anywhere.  Well even though I love Shemp, Curly is the one most people identify with the Three Stooges.  Hey, if this movie has a sequel, I'd love for a Shemp to be in it somewhere.  Dare I say, perhaps even serve as a replacement for Curly.As for this movie, well it's based around a movie-length storyline instead of the short segments we're accustomed to.  It's about the Three Stooges having to find a way to make over 800,000 dollars to save an orphanage from going under.  How they make the money is hilarious and significantly more elaborate than what you'd see in the original short Stooges stories of years ago.  Anyone who knows a thing or two about the Three Stooges can pretty much figure out what to expect.  Several crazy antics!  Needless to say, I *still* find this type of humor really funny despite how many times I've seen it done before.Nice detail devoting several minutes to the Three Stooges as young kids, and especially the one with Moe being adopted and getting to know his new parents.  Really good segment.  Favorite segment?  It's a toss up between the commotion that the Stooges find themselves in at the hospital and especially the baby peeing incident, and the emotional one with Larry and Curly finally becoming fed up with Moe's bossy nature- really emotional scene here that might come as a shock to any really big Stooges fan from the black and white days.This is seriously a hilarious movie.  All the face slapping, eye poking, head smacking, ladder collapsing bumps and hits that you've loved in the original can be found once again right here.  A perfectly executed update to a classic and influential type of comedy- I went in expecting this to be a low budget attempt at recapturing the Stooges only to be pleasantly delighted and the accurate portrayal.  Will watch again.  Oh and the song that occasionally comes and goes, and is heard again during the credits (called ""Waste"" by Foster The People) has an EXTREMELY catchy chorus!",5,oh a wise guy eh?,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,3474,"['believe', 'huge', 'shout', 'out', 'HAS', 'go', 'movie', 'writers', 'directors', 'made', 'sure', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'were', 'incredibly', 'faithful', 'original', 'characters', 'many', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'loving', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'funniest', 'show', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'version', 'NOT', 'disappoint.There', 'couple', 'amazing', 'things', 'movie', 'find', 'interesting', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'still', 'act', 'did', 'back', '30', '40', '50', 'when', 'became', 'successful', 'yet', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'new', 'world', 'computer', 'technology', 'cell', 'phones', 'twitter', 'film', 'mentions', 'many', 'things', 'really', 'Stooges', 'brought', 'current', 'world.Another', 'surprising', 'highlight', 'how', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'look', 'EXACTLY', 'real', 'Moe', 'Howard', 'Larry', 'Fine', 'What', 'are', 'odds', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'exactly', 'originals', 'could', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'play', 'role', 'Moe', 'Howard', 'Larry', 'Fine', 'so', 'convincingly', 'accurate', 'not', 'see', 'Moe', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'everyday-', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'people', 'resemble', 'Moe', 'never', 'startling', 'extent', 'guy', 'movie', 'same', 'applies', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'well', 'thousands', 'people', 'look', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'hard', 'find.My', 'point', 'here', 'minor', 'miracle', 'not', 'do', 'guys', 'look', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'are', 'able', '*act*', 'extremely', 'close', 'well.I', 'guess', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'fact', 'Shemp', ""n't"", 'movie', 'anywhere', 'Well', 'even', 'love', 'Shemp', 'Curly', 'one', 'most', 'people', 'identify', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Hey', 'movie', 'sequel', ""'d"", 'love', 'Shemp', 'be', 'somewhere', 'Dare', 'say', 'perhaps', 'even', 'serve', 'replacement', 'Curly.As', 'movie', 'well', 'based', 'movie-length', 'storyline', 'instead', 'short', 'segments', ""'re"", 'accustomed', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'having', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'over', '800,000', 'dollars', 'save', 'orphanage', 'going', 'How', 'make', 'money', 'hilarious', 'significantly', 'more', 'elaborate', 'what', ""'d"", 'see', 'original', 'short', 'Stooges', 'stories', 'years', 'ago', 'Anyone', 'who', 'thing', 'two', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'expect', 'Several', 'crazy', 'antics', 'Needless', 'say', '*still*', 'find', 'type', 'humor', 'really', 'funny', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'before.Nice', 'detail', 'devoting', 'several', 'minutes', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'young', 'kids', 'especially', 'one', 'Moe', 'being', 'adopted', 'getting', 'know', 'new', 'parents', 'Really', 'good', 'segment', 'Favorite', 'segment', 'toss', 'up', 'commotion', 'Stooges', 'find', 'hospital', 'especially', 'baby', 'peeing', 'incident', 'emotional', 'one', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'finally', 'becoming', 'fed', 'up', 'Moe', 'bossy', 'nature-', 'really', 'emotional', 'scene', 'here', 'might', 'come', 'shock', 'really', 'big', 'Stooges', 'fan', 'black', 'white', 'days.This', 'seriously', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'face', 'slapping', 'eye', 'poking', 'head', 'smacking', 'ladder', 'collapsing', 'bumps', 'hits', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'original', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'once', 'again', 'right', 'here', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'update', 'classic', 'influential', 'type', 'comedy-', 'went', 'expecting', 'be', 'low', 'budget', 'attempt', 'recapturing', 'Stooges', 'only', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'delighted', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Will', 'watch', 'again', 'Oh', 'song', 'occasionally', 'heard', 'again', 'credits', 'called', 'Waste', 'Foster', 'People', 'EXTREMELY', 'catchy', 'chorus']",N/A

And thanks to my DVD collection I still do. Therefore, I lamented the fact that the new film would not be released on the big screen in the UK until Friday, the 17th of August, well after the USA theatrical release date of the 13th of April. However, during a recent vacation in Florida, I was amazed and delighted to be able the buy the new film on DVD during the same week it was released. I still can't believe that I was able to sit and watch the film last night in my living room, along with the deleted/extended scenes and the other extras more than a week before it will be shown here in the UK for the very first time. As for the movie itself, it was well-worth the wait. The three leads are nothing short of marvelous as Larry, Moe and Curly. They so captured the whole essence of the original Three Stooges. The Farrelly Brothers are to be commended for (mostly) keeping the comedy clean and suitable for the whole family. I for one would love to see a sequel, if it was of the quality of this film. As for the delayed UK big-screen release, I don't believe that the comedy of The Three Stooges is very well known enough here to be a success. Much in the same way that a lot of British comedy would not be very widely known in the USA. I do feel that The Three Stooges type of comedy doesn't appeal to everyone, but if you are like me and are a devoted fan, you will not be disappointed in this new film.

If only the Farrellys had not tried to shoehorn their patented bodily function gags into the script.  They rationalized it in interviews by saying that, if the Stooges were around in today's more permissive cultural landscape, they would be indulging in the same kinds of gross-out gags.  This is a huge miscalculation.  A scene in a maternity ward is clearly meant to be an updating of old seltzer water gags but it just doesn't work the same way.  I appreciate a well executed, raunchy gag but they really do not have a place in this universe.  However, it is clear that Peter & Bobby have tremendous affection for the trio and the whole film clearly means so well that it's a bit difficult to rag on it too harshly.  But, I can't say I laughed all that much.  Maybe I chuckled here and there.  The actors all do a tremendous job.  Chris Diamantopoulos practically becomes Moe Howard.  I was most skeptical of Sean Hayes' Larry Fine, especially in the wake of Billy West's uncanny impersonation.  But he, by no means, embarrasses himself.  All the supporting actors are into the spirit of the thing but the directors just make a handful of wrong turns (i.e., the gross-out stuff, the Jersey Shore detour which will horribly date the film, the dumb prologue with the young Stooges, the awful choice of background music that undermines some solid slapstick sequences) that doom the film to failure.  Though, with one or two adjustments, a follow up film might prove to be more successful than the first.  Or maybe just as lousy.  The deleted scenes on the DVD (which are funny) indicate that there was more, possibly better, slapstick that was inexplicably excised from the film.

But When I heard that hollywood was coming out with an actual three stooges movie I had my doubts. Like the saying goes you can't never replace a classic right? Well I was dead wrong on this one. Turns out that saying doesn't actually apply to everything. Chris Diamantopoulos did a wounderful job playing the bad boy leader of the three Moe. Sean Hayes was great as the curled haired middle stooge Larry. Last but not least and was alway's my most favorite out of all the stooges was Curly played by the very talented Will Sasso. I was also surprised to see Jane Lynch star as one of the nuns. I loved her in ""Two and a half Men"". There was plenty of gut busting laughs and tears.

Imagine my shock when I read the supposedly authoritative ""Amazon.com Editorial Review"" posted at the film's page with the reviewer saying it was the Farrellys' ""weakest effort to date"" and ""terminally unfunny.""  Look, I'm smart enough to know one review is just one person's opinion, and that comedy is very personal and a heckuva lot harder to pull off than drama (what's funny to one person is often simply irritating or annoying to another), but when the review is posted on a film's page as the authoritative last word, I have to put my two-cents in.  Here's my short review:  I either smiled, chuckled, or laughed out loud through the ENTIRE running time of this film, and that very rarely happens for me, hence my 5-star rating.  Most comedies, even the best, have slow spots you wait out until the next laugh--it's often the natural flow of a film to have peaks and valleys, but this film had none for me--it was all peaks.  Every scene had something for me to at least smile at, whether it was the Stooges themselves, Jane Lynch as a Mother Superior (!), Larry David as a cranky nun (!), Lin Shaye showing up out of the blue in a small role (I love her), Sofia Vergara gamely sparring with the guys, or small touches, surprises, and sight gags that flew by so fast you knew you'd be laughing all over again when you saw it a second time (if we'd had the time we would've gladly stayed to watch it a second time the day we saw it--the friend I saw it with had as much fun watching it as I did).  The three leads were perfectly cast, and if you know the Stooges, you'll appreciate even more how perfect they are.  It's uncanny how close they are to the originals, and the entire production feels like a respectful and loving homage to them.  There is no doubt in my mind the film will spark even more appreciation and discovery of the original Stooges and their huge body of work, and that's exactly what you hope for:  that the new film not only succeeds on its own but sparks viewers' interest, appreciation, and respect for the originals.",5,"Amazon's ""Editorial Review"" for this film made me do this",1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,2377,"['Amazon', 'notified', 'email', 'new', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'pre-ordered', 'linked', 'do', 'so', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'fun', 'movie', 'theater', 'long', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 're-visit', 'film', 'home', 'usual', 'bounty', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Farrellys', 'usually', 'provide', 'hope', 'Imagine', 'shock', 'when', 'read', 'supposedly', 'authoritative', 'Amazon.com', 'Editorial', 'Review', 'posted', 'film', 'page', 'reviewer', 'saying', 'was', 'Farrellys', 'weakest', 'effort', 'date', 'terminally', 'unfunny', 'Look', ""'m"", 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'one', 'review', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'opinion', 'comedy', 'very', 'personal', 'heckuva', 'lot', 'harder', 'pull', 'off', 'drama', 'what', 'funny', 'one', 'person', 'often', 'simply', 'irritating', 'annoying', 'when', 'review', 'posted', 'film', 'page', 'authoritative', 'last', 'word', 'have', 'put', 'two-cents', 'Here', 'short', 'review', 'smiled', 'chuckled', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'ENTIRE', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'very', 'rarely', 'hence', '5-star', 'rating', 'Most', 'comedies', 'even', 'best', 'have', 'slow', 'spots', 'wait', 'out', 'next', 'laugh', 'often', 'natural', 'flow', 'film', 'have', 'peaks', 'valleys', 'film', 'had', 'none', 'was', 'peaks', 'Every', 'scene', 'had', 'something', 'least', 'smile', 'was', 'Stooges', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'Larry', 'David', 'cranky', 'nun', 'Lin', 'Shaye', 'showing', 'up', 'blue', 'small', 'role', 'love', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'gamely', 'sparring', 'guys', 'small', 'touches', 'surprises', 'sight', 'gags', 'flew', 'fast', 'knew', ""'d"", 'be', 'laughing', 'over', 'again', 'when', 'saw', 'second', 'time', ""'d"", 'had', 'time', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gladly', 'stayed', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'day', 'saw', 'friend', 'saw', 'had', 'much', 'fun', 'watching', 'did', 'three', 'leads', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'know', 'Stooges', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'even', 'more', 'how', 'perfect', 'are', 'uncanny', 'how', 'close', 'are', 'originals', 'entire', 'production', 'feels', 'respectful', 'loving', 'homage', 'doubt', 'mind', 'film', 'will', 'spark', 'even', 'more', 'appreciation', 'discovery', 'original', 'Stooges', 'huge', 'body', 'work', 'exactly', 'what', 'hope', 'new', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'viewers', 'interest', 'appreciation', 'respect', 'originals']",N/A

I only saw the movie advertise on television once when it was at theaters and it did not look too good. Then I read a few bad reviews about the movie, making me less likely to go see it. The movie did not do very well at the theaters, barely covering its budget worldwide. I saw the DVD for under fifteen dollars and I talked myself into buying it.The movie opens up with the same Stooges' tune and similar opening credits. The first episode is titled ""More Orphan Than Not,"" which explains the Stooges back-story, where as babies they are left in basket outside of an orphanage. As they grow up and cause chaos for the nuns (played by Jane Lynch, Larry David, and a few others), Moe is almost adopted by a wealthy couple, but they end up adopting another orphan, Teddy, instead. Twenty-five years later, Moe (played by Chris Diamantopoulos), Larry (played by Sean Hayes), and Curly (Will Sasso) have never left the orphanage as they are now handymen, but the home that they have known is going to be closed down as the orphanage owes $830,000 in thirty days.There are two more episodes in the movie, ""The Bananas Splits"" and ""No Moe Mister Nice Guy,"" in which the trio go to the big city to raise the money. Since they have been sheltered, they have no clue what to do, but luck happens to be on their side as a mysterious woman offers them the money, but they have to kill her dying husband. After being chased out of the hospital, they briefly run into Teddy. The Stooges are still broke but come up with a Salmon Farm idea, which turns into a disaster.With time running out, Larry and Curly leave Moe, hoping to raise the money on their own. Then Moe accidentally gets a role on a reality series, The Jersey Shore. While looking for Teddy, so they can ask him for money, Larry and Curly stumble onto a murder plot.I am surprised that the movie was rated PG considering that the Farrelly brothers directed it, and I am glad that did not try to raunch up the Stooges, but instead they used the old slapstick humor that the Stooges are famous for using. No one can every replace the original Stooges, but I was shocked at how well the actors stepped into the Stooges feet mimicking their voices and actions, especially Will Sasso who played Curly. The plot is simple and at times, the script feels silly, but was not that the point of the old Stooges' shorts, silliness. Even though I do prefer the originals, I did find myself laughing at the new Stooges.

I remember growing up being introduced to the Three Stooges and being amazed that such bumbling oafs could actually survive, and this movie brings these three characters back in all their glory. I have to commend the casting on the movie as all of the actors did a great job and really brought the essence of the original characters back while making them relevant today. The movie provides laughs as well as situations where you just say, did they really just do that, but that is why people love the Three Stooges. You love them because they do the things that you would seemingly never do and I appreciated the disclaimer at the end of the movie from the directors to show that kids should not emulate and do the stunts that the Three Stooges did in the movie as they could be dangerous.

Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Why did that guy that gets kicked between the legs get so far on America's Got Talent in 2012 - well yeah of course, we love a stupid slapstick joke. The Three Stooges Movie is just exactly that, a kick between the legs joke. If you hate that kind of joke, don't bother watching this film.There's no debating, this is a horribly low brow movie. Should anybody expect anything less? The original Stooges have entertained boys for a really long time (in general, I don't think females enjoy the Stooges nearly as much as males) with their particular brand of slapstick jokes. This new movie does a pretty darn good job of updating the Stooges work.Yes, sometimes the film is completely confused, is this 1930 or 2012? Yes the makeup on Larry is pretty awful all the time (and I had no idea watching the film that Larry is played by Sean Hayes the ultra gay member of the Will and Grace show). Oh, yes the film is about 30 minutes too long and the story doesn't really hold together very well. But dog gone it, this was a stupid funny movie.On the other hand, the original Stooges films were no better. They were a vehicle for these three actors to just do stupid sight gags. And there is a huge audience that loved those films. In the end, a brand new generation of boys got an introduction to this kind of humor.By far the most difficult and best modern actor was Curly played by Will Sasso. Sasso did a fantastic job as the most physical of the three and captured Curly's nyuk nyuk really well. Sasso has been in a lot of television shows, I remember him from the short run $#Ht My Father Says (William Shatner) as the big dumb brother. He has just enough Kevin James and Patrick Warburton, to make him likeable and funny. Sean Hayes as Larry surprised me. Hayes went a long ways out of his comfort zone for this role and did a good job. I thought Chris Diamantopoulos as Moe was the weakest. The original black and white Moe had a bit of style to him. The 2012 Moe came off a bit less stylish and a lot meaner.Soytenly nits to pick with this film. Honestly it is just one to go along for the ride and enjoy. Not great cinema, it will probably be forgetten in a few years.

Well that's just what the Farrelly brothers did. The actors look, sound and act like the original stooges (at least as close as one can get anyway). The movie incorporated many of the stooges old gags, which was great! The movie also managed to have the stooges portrayed as if they were still in the 1930's and 40's in their manner and essence. This was no small feat since the movie is set in the present year of 2012. As far as the story goes, I've heard a few complaints (not many). The story is completely adequate and very enjoyable. If you look back at the old stooge shorts you will see that the story lines were simply a series of sight and sound gags with the boys set in different places and sometimes even different time periods. There was very little continuity and plot. And those shorts were only 18 minutes on average. So here with this movie you have to fill up 92 minutes of time and keep it interesting and funny.

They nail the mannerisms and vocalizations of the three so completely, it's actually a bit spooky - ghost watching on the same level as Jim Carrey's take on Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon. Problem is, those performances are blown on a tale that's gratingly predictable, horribly misdirected and woefully, thoroughly unfunny. For some unfathomable reason, the troupe is dropped without any modification into the present, where their slapstick Vaudeville act is over-amped and completely out of place. I get that nobody on the planet was clamoring for a reinvention of this particular wheel, but when the script's so desperate for validation it shoehorns in the cast of Jersey Shore for more than just a cameo, maybe it's time to take a step back and reassess.

I've watched the antics of Moe, Larry and Curly for years and have the first 100 shorts (all the Curly's) on DVD. When I heard about this movie, I first thought, awesome - a Stooges Biography! Then I went to IMDB.com and my heart dropped. Three guys recreating the Stooges? With the cast of the Jersey Shore? I swore never to see it. In fact, I was thinking some form of Inquisitional type punishment should be done to the mental cases who wanted to do it!Then I saw the trailer. And watched it again and again and again. just seeing Snooki get eye poked sold me. But the movie itself was so damn funny, such an excellent homage to the original three, that I laughed from beginning to end. No lie, I was laughing when the movie opened and the Stooges theme was played. Ok, it isn't rocket science, nor will it rend one's heart. But what the Three Stooges will do is make one laugh. And laugh. And laugh. Will Sasso, Sean Hayes and Chris D. (I'm not spelling that!) were perfect as the Stooges. A few gags were updated, Chainsaw on a ladder instead of a regular saw, but all was done with such love for the original Trio that any fan of this has to be happy with it.So with a N'Yuk, N'Yuk, N'Yuk, I'll end this by saying Hey Moe!

Fortunately, this movie is respectful of the classics and really captures the spirit of the original characters. Sean Hayes, Chris Diamantopoulos, and Will Sasso as Larry, Moe, and Curly resemble their black and white counterparts both physically and in their acting. Diamantopoulos is dead on as Moe, while Sasso really captured Curly's energy.The film does make the Three Stooges more modern, but not by abandoning the traditional Three Stooges humor. The film is full of slapstick comedy. The movie even recreates the sound effects from the originals. While some modern viewers might find this corny, it's nice to see an audience for this lighthearted, non-vulgar humor.The film treads on more perilous grounds when it puts Moe on a reality TV show. Jersey Shore even makes an appearance. Fortunately, even here the director was careful to make this a Three Stooges movie. Rather than the Three Stooges becoming more like Jersey Shore, we get to see Moe poke Snooki's eyes and slap the male cast members.

The three actors looked, sounded, and acted just like the originals (except... the one that played Larry... he looked more like Clint Howard?! Because of his eyes???). Anyway, I give it a 2 star rating for the following reasons...Instead of making this film for adults and children alike, the film makers leaned more towards mindless youngsters! They made the oh too familiar mistake of thinking there was a need for cutsie children actors to be in the film just to attract the very young crowd? The storyline would've survived quite well without this, as I remember MOST Stooge shorts had no need for it!Then, there's what ended up on the editing room floor...Lucky there's a ""deleted scenes"" extra on the DVD. Here you'll find about 8 or 9 scenes that should have remained in the film. It would have made the unedited scenes much more ""stooge-like"", and the film funnier. I can only imagine these bits cut because maybe too violent or sexual innuendo (come on?... It's like the Stooges... that's what the originals did best!!!)???And then there's that final INSULT to all you idiots and non-idiots alike out there...At he end of the film (just before the credits), the two film makers appear and tell all you folks out there, ""WARNING... DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!!"". Then they go on to show that the hammers and tools in the film were made of rubber. Then they proceed to show you that poking in the eyes was done not by aiming the fingers in the eyes, but just above, hitting the eyebrows. [Yet, if you playback the scene where Moe sits next to Snooki. He tells her look in the box, and it's Moe's hand... AND HE DOES POKE HER IN THE EYES (if you play back in slow motion, you'll see Snooki close her eyes first before the fingers hit)]But anyways.... REALLY????  YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING??!!!  Do the children of today really need to be told this? Come on, let's try and give the kids (well most kids) some credit out there?!!!!!!  I know when I watched the original Three Stooges when I was a child (not those awful movies with that retard Curly-Joe), I knew enough not to do those kind of things I saw!So, finally the end credits also had to have an ending song/video included. Since ""Shrek"", seems we can't have a children's movie end without some kind of new version of a popular older song. In this case, the song, ""It's A Shame"" was chosen... wise choice, as it's title really describes the final outcome of this film as a whole!Well, with the material I have on this DVD and my computer with all it's wonderful software, I will be able to re-edit this film and burn my more watchable, funnier version to DVD (for my own personal use). I will be cutting out all the cutsie bits and putting the ""deleted"" bits back in. Of course, those idiot filmmakers at the end will definitely have to go too.

They were a one of a kind act that will never be equaled, yet there is something funny about THE THREE STOOGES MOVIE that is a nice homage to times past.I attended a THREE STOOGES film festival last Novemeber and Peter Farrelly spoke to the audience about his upcoming THREE STOOGES FILM. He promised that they had stuck to the stooges legacy as much as possible. Unfortunately, I had low expectations and was not convinced. I decided not to see the film in the theaters and hesitantly waited for the DVD.My expectations were low so I think that influenced me greatly when the film was better than I expected. It is far from a real THREE STOOGES film but enough effort was made to bring their essence to the screen that I found myself laughing on a number of occasions--maybe it was simply a routine that reminded me of the actual stooges.This is far from a great movie. The Farrelly brothers should have done better but there is enough ""nyuck nyuck nyucks"" to make this a funny film.It is always great to see the lovely Sofia Vergara and this time she is the villain trying to hire the stooges to kill her husband. As can be guessed, nothing goes as planned. Jane Lynch is fun as a nun trying to hold an orphanage together. Lovely Jennifer Hudson is under-used as another nun. Larry David plays a crotchedly nun who has no time for or love of the stooges. There was a stroke of genius having Larry David as a nun!Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes, and Will Sasso all do their best to look and act like the original Moe, Larry and Curly.

I'm glad the first choices walked away. It would have totally sucked. The ones who wound up doing the movie were about as perfect as you can get. The strong point of the movie was definitely their performance. The basic premise of the movie was only weakened by the outstanding portrayals of the main characters. I have to admit though most of the laughs for me came during the first half of the movie. I would say if you're a fan of the actual Three Stooges then you should at least admire the effort they put into recreating the personalities and likenesses of Moe, Larry, and Curly. I myself am looking forward to a sequel. One with a haunted house, racketeers, gun molls, and someone who will have a typical 1940s cheap line like, ""Listen toots if ya boyfriend hea doesn't start makin like a canary one of yous is gonna get it right between the eyes"" Ooooh! and a little pie fight too.

Running Time: 91 minutes.Watching this movie was like a knock on the head.Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Shemp Howard was a comedy team from vaudeville.  They were discovered and made short film comedies for the movie theater. At the time of their beginnings, their was no television yet. With their first film, Soup to Nuts (1930), Moe was the age of 33 and continued with The Three Stooges to the end in 1969 at the age of 72. Larry Fine was 28 and continued to the age of 68. Shemp left the act and found work in Vitaphone film comedies. Curly Howard, joined the team in 1932 with his brother Moe, and vaudeville performer Larry Fine. The team was renamed ""The Three Stooges"" in 1934.After Curly had a horrible stroke in May 1946, only the age of 42, he could no longer perform well, however he made one last film appearance, after his stroke, with his brothers, including Shemp (who returned to replaced Curly), in Hold That Lion! (1947). He died in 1952.Joe Besser joined the team in 1956-57. Joe DeRita as ""Curly Joe"" joined for 1958-69. A total of 220 films were made of ""The Three Stooges"". They also appeared on television.I must confess, I never did like The Three Stooge when I was young because I thought they were violent and mean to each other. I did not like the slapping and the hitting, which was called ""slapstick comedy"".It was the motion picture, Snow White and The Three Stooges (1961), in color, when I began to relax watching The Three Stooges. I still like this film.In 2012, to pay homage to the comedy team that has since passed away from us, 20th Century Fox has cast Chris Diamantopoulos as ""Moe"", Sean Hayes as ""Larry"" and Will Sasso as ""Curly"" in this new movie, The Three Stooges"". It offers us the story of what if The Three Stooges lived in today's world as themselves. The brother, ""Shemp"", is not in this movie.I was blown away by Chris Diamantopoulous performance as ""Moe"" and Will Sasso was right on.  Sean Hayes used the New York accent to play ""Larry"", but it looked like Sean Hayes in a red hair wig to me. The real ""Larry"" had a bigger nose.I did have some laughs and I probably enjoyed this movie more than I have enjoyed the original black & white ones. I did find Larry David annoying as a nun.Also in the cast: Jane Lynch, Stephen Collins, Brian Doyle-Murray, Jennifer Hudson, Antonio Sabato Jr.Option of Language: English, Spanish, French, English Descriptive Video.Option of Subtitles: English, Spanish.Extras: 8 Deleted / Extended scenes, The Three Stooges Mash-Up, Theatrical Trailer.You might also like:The Three Stooges: The Ultimate CollectionThe Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 1: 1934-1936.The Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 4: 1943-1945.The Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 5: 1946-1948.Snow White And The Three Stooges(1961)The Three Stooges Meet Hercules(1962)The Three Stooges in Orbit(1962)The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze(1963)It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(1963)The Three Stooges (2000)Starring Paul Ben-Victor, Evan Handler, John Kassir, Michael Chiklis.",4,This Three Stooges movie pokes me in the eye.,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,3037,"['Rated', 'PG', 'Running', 'Time', '91', 'minutes.Watching', 'movie', 'was', 'knock', 'head.Moe', 'Howard', 'Larry', 'Fine', 'Shemp', 'Howard', 'was', 'comedy', 'team', 'vaudeville', 'were', 'discovered', 'made', 'short', 'film', 'comedies', 'movie', 'theater', 'time', 'beginnings', 'was', 'television', 'yet', 'first', 'film', 'Soup', 'Nuts', '1930', 'Moe', 'was', 'age', '33', 'continued', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'end', '1969', 'age', '72', 'Larry', 'Fine', 'was', '28', 'continued', 'age', '68', 'Shemp', 'left', 'act', 'found', 'work', 'Vitaphone', 'film', 'comedies', 'Curly', 'Howard', 'joined', 'team', '1932', 'brother', 'Moe', 'vaudeville', 'performer', 'Larry', 'Fine', 'team', 'was', 'renamed', 'Three', 'Stooges', '1934.After', 'Curly', 'had', 'horrible', 'stroke', 'May', '1946', 'only', 'age', '42', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'perform', 'well', 'however', 'made', 'one', 'last', 'film', 'appearance', 'stroke', 'brothers', 'including', 'Shemp', 'who', 'returned', 'replaced', 'Curly', 'Hold', 'Lion', '1947', 'died', '1952.Joe', 'Besser', 'joined', 'team', '1956-57', 'Joe', 'DeRita', 'Curly', 'Joe', 'joined', '1958-69', 'total', '220', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'also', 'appeared', 'television.I', 'must', 'confess', 'never', 'did', 'Three', 'Stooge', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'thought', 'were', 'violent', 'mean', 'other', 'did', 'not', 'slapping', 'hitting', 'was', 'called', 'slapstick', 'comedy', '.It', 'was', 'motion', 'picture', 'Snow', 'White', 'Three', 'Stooges', '1961', 'color', 'when', 'began', 'relax', 'watching', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'still', 'film.In', '2012', 'pay', 'homage', 'comedy', 'team', 'passed', 'away', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'cast', 'Chris', 'Diamantopoulos', 'Moe', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Larry', 'Will', 'Sasso', 'Curly', 'new', 'movie', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'story', 'what', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'lived', 'today', 'world', 'brother', 'Shemp', 'not', 'movie.I', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Chris', 'Diamantopoulous', 'performance', 'Moe', 'Will', 'Sasso', 'was', 'right', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'used', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'play', 'Larry', 'looked', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'red', 'hair', 'wig', 'real', 'Larry', 'had', 'bigger', 'nose.I', 'did', 'have', 'laughs', 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'black', 'white', 'ones', 'did', 'find', 'Larry', 'David', 'annoying', 'nun.Also', 'cast', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'Brian', 'Doyle-Murray', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Antonio', 'Sabato', 'Jr.Option', 'Language', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'English', 'Descriptive', 'Video.Option', 'Subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish.Extras', '8', 'Deleted', '/', 'Extended', 'scenes', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Mash-Up', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer.You', 'might', 'also', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Ultimate', 'CollectionThe', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Collection', 'Vol', '1', '1934-1936.The', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Collection', 'Vol', '4', '1943-1945.The', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Collection', 'Vol', '5', '1946-1948.Snow', 'White', 'Three', 'Stooges', '1961', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Meet', 'Hercules', '1962', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Orbit', '1962', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Go', 'World', 'Daze', '1963', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', '1963', 'Three', 'Stooges', '2000', 'Starring', 'Paul', 'Ben-Victor', 'Evan', 'Handler', 'John', 'Kassir', 'Michael', 'Chiklis']",N/A

The plot is pretty basic, the stooges are dropped off at an orphanage some time in the late 70's and as they grow up they wreak havoc on the nuns running the place and of course they're unadoptable. After they grow up Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos), Larry (Sean Hayes), and Curly (Will Sasso) still live at the orphanage and wirk as handymen. Yes, I spelled it wirk because they aren't the brightest bulbs in the socket although they may stick their fingers in the socket! When the orphanage runs into financial problems the boys are sent out into the world to raise $830,000 to save it (shades of the Blues Brothers). Out in the world they're instantly picked by Lydia (Sofia Vergara) and Mac (Craig Bierko) planning to murder Lydia's husband. They give the trio a song and dance of wanting the stooges to kill Mac, but the story is a ruse to get the stooges to kill her husband. In all their bumbling good intentions to collect the $830,000 they foul up the murder plot, and provoke the ire of the murdering couple. All standard stooge fare.There are a lot of good actors and actresses in ""The Three Stooges"", Jane Lynch, Brian Doyle Murray, Larry David, Stephen Collins, Sofia Vergara, but Diamantopoulos, Hayes, and Sasso are rightly front and center as the stooges and they do just about every classic stooge bit including a few new ones. And the usual foils of cops, doctors, lawyers, and high society matrons are the brunt of the stooges antics. A note, Moe becomes a reality star on Jersey Shore and its worth the price of admission to watch him dole out some well deserved punishment to the Shore cast.The movie is episodic to recreate the feel of the original stooge shorts and directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly realize less is more and don't try to make this movie anything more than it is, good popcorn munching fun! Yes, it is violent, but some of the routines seem more intricate than dance routines and the violence is very cartoonish.

1500212,A3J4IM04W99U3O,B005S9EL08,Kevin Meade,"[0, 0]","Anyone doing the Stooges has a hard road ahead of them.  No matter what they do they will not be THE Three Stooges and it will show in some way.  But once you accept it, this movie is worth discussion.  Though I refer to this movie in some places as an ""average comedy"", I do not mean this as a negative commentary on any of the actors or the three guys doing the stooges.  They were good.First the movie is way flawed.  The basic premise is wrong.  ""SPOILER""  In this movie the Stooges decide they need to commit Murder. ??? What???  You can use all the plot tricks you want but there is JUST NO WAY the Stooges would ever make up their minds that it was OK to kill anyone no matter what the circumstance.  It is not the Stooges way.  The Stooges are the guys who take care of orphan babies, mom's in need, and in general fight the bad guys.  If you are starving The Stooges will cook their boots to feed you a meal of sole; they will go to jail for 20-to-life and bust rocks over Curly's head in order to right an injustice done to you, and if you are ill, they will put their own lives at risk riding through dangerous wild territories to bring you the medicine that will save your life, but a mercy killing???, No!, its just not stooges.  The writers, directors, producers, supporting cast, and especially the new three stooges actors themselves should all be getting eye pokes for eternity for allowing such a grossly wrong idea to be pushed as plot for a stooges movie.  Doing the Stooges is more than just repeating their gags.  You have to continue the Stooges legacy; so for this super poor judgment on everyone's part, I dock the movie two stars right off the bat.BUT... once you get past the fact that these are three new guys... and you forgive for the stupidity of the plot error... you see that this is good stooges addition.  There is a lot to be recommended.The three new actors got it down.  They work the basic stooges well.  The timing is good, the intensity is good, the emotion is good, and several of the gags you want to see are there.  Consider this:  I can't count how many times I have seen the ""falling stooges"" gag.  The stooges taking a fall from height was always done with three stuffed dummies bombed away, followed by a really bad cutover to three live ""dummies"" rolling on the ground.  So when I see Moe, Larry, and Curly jumping over the side of a building holding on to a fire hose I lean in because you know what I am waiting for.  Will I be able to make out the three dummies when they hit the ground?  Will it even be there for me to see?  The falling dummies gag is as much a three stooges signature as the eye poke and I want it.  Naturally not everything can be done in 100 minutes so there are gags you expected but did not see.  The ever popular ""Pick Two"", pie in the face, Curly making pancakes; there just is not enough room for it all.  But hey, that's OK, it just means there is room for another movie.Also, there is reasonable balance here.  Some gags are over done.  For example, Curly changing diapers was great to start.  Anyone who has raised boys knows what happens when the diaper comes off and the cold air hits, so it is easy to believe this one.  It reminded me of Curly vs. the Clam.  Changing Diapers was a great gag that offered lots of opportunity for each of the stooges to show their stuff.  But it soon degenerates into a ""shootout"" with the stooges using babies as weapons.  A bad turn on what could have been stooges' awesomeness.On the other hand, the stooges characters in this movie are in some ways better than the originals (can it be?).  I particularly liked the Larry character because he was a much stronger Larry than the original ""...how many buggers are we talking?"".  And the movie took some chances.  For example, they showed it was possible for NON-STOOGES to affectively do the stooges bits.  Best example was when Sofia Vergara was lifting up Craig Bierko over a wall, she gets the foot in the face mashing down no her nose.  This was never a great stooges gag, but it was a staple and always made me smile.  And these two did it just a well as the Original Stooges did.  So I was glad to see this movie growing the stooges routine in this way.Indeed, one can even go so far as to say this movie offers some excellent SOCIAL COMMENTARY.  The Foot in the Face gag ultimately dumps Bierko into a Lion's Den (another familiar event in the stooges world (which Bierko does pretty well with as a bad guy)) and this sends a clear message to kids.  Don't be a bad guy, bad guys are even stupider than the stooges and who wants to be that dumb?  For the adults, after consideration of the events in the movie from the Reality TV angle, to the ending where the friend from the orphanage now rich refuses to help the orphanage even after the Stooges save his life (way lame), you realize that for all their bumbling innocence, when it comes to SOCIETY VS. THE THREE STOOGES... it is society that is all messed up, not the stooges.But it is still a three star movie so far.  Even the good gags, character improvements, risk taking, and redeeming social commentary value can't make up for the huge plot error sitting in the back of your mind.  So what makes this a five star stooges addition?  Two things.1) What is the purpose of this film?  If its purpose is for 100 minutes or so, to make you smile in a way that only the stooges can make you smile, then this movie succeeds whole heartedly in its mission.  This is not a movie that has you laughing uncontrollably (at least not me).  In fact, it was the well done trailers that had me rolling over.  But this is OK.  I have many of the original stooges shorts on cd and (dare I point it out) many of these shorts are not great shorts.  Few of them actually have me laughing out loud.  But they all have me smiling and loving the stooges.  This movie is the same way.  So for being a pretty good comedy, and for avoiding any of a thousand distractions during production that cold have turned this adventure bad, and thus being able to succeed in the main goal of glorifying the stooges and keeping me smiling and happy for its duration in the stooges way, it gets a star added back.2) While watching the movie, if you are fortunate, you will recognize a completely new stooges gag.  It is totally Stooges and it is totally new.  There is a scene where these three guys work their way through a slapping frenzy that ultimately ties them in a knot, and culminates in ... the SIMULTANEOUS TRIPPLE EYE POKE.  To my knowledge this stunt was never performed by any combination of the original three stooges in any of their shorts or movies.  But when you see it done you realize it is a real three stooges stunt, it belongs to the three stooges and could be done by the stooges, and these three guys execute it flawlessly.  The idea of creating new original stooges material that could only be successful when done by the stooges would seem to me to be an impossibility.  Yet this movie did it.  Doing what should be impossible is worth an extra star.And that is how this average three star comedy is really a five star stooges film.  This film is a worthy addition to the stooges lore.  These three guys got it down and I hope they make another movie real soon.Hail Flavius!",5,"three star comedy, five star stooges film",1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,7294,"['Anyone', 'doing', 'Stooges',

As a lifelong fan of The Stooges, I thought the trailers looked dead on. There was slapstick, mugging, cringe-worthy puns, and ludicrous situations. ""What are you expecting?"" I told everyone. ""Dry wit and urbane satire?""No. Look. If you love the Stooges, then you should know what to expect, and in that sense, the movie delivers. Sasso, Hayes, and Dia, Dima, Dena... whatever his name is. They all perform their characters flawlessly. Even the children that play the toddler Stooges were astonishingly good at mimicking both the look, sound, and movement of the original triad of twits. Really, when it comes down to a Stooge remake, the only questions you've gotta ask are a) do they do justice to the Stooges and b) do they keep it up for a whole movie's length? The answers are yes and yes. If you want complex jokes, subtlety, or depth, then you must not know who the Three Stooges are.In addition to providing spot-on recreations of those lovable lunkheads, the film judiciously includes nearly pitch-perfect, bonk-for-bonk remakes of iconic Stooge scenes and jokes mixed with material updated for contemporary culture. Larry David, Sofia Vergara, Jane Lynch, and other tested comedic actors/actresses hold their own as the straight men and women to the Stooges' pummeling punnery, and the story refuses to veer from the tried-and-true Stooge formula, with our goofuses setting out into the real world to save an orphanage one eye poke at a time (the back story for how the nun-run kid's home went broke is a delightful self-gibing surprise).My only real complaint with the film has to do with the addition of the cast of The Jersey Shore. The Stooges try a number of methods to raise the dough for the orphanage, and one of them involves joining the famed reality show. I guess this might satisfy many viewers' wishes to watch these buff and belligerent ""guidos"" and ""guidettes"" get a taste of the old Stooge medicine (which involves, of course, cartoon-style violence), but it threw me out of the film. First of all, none of those Jersey-ites can act to save their lives. Second, it adds the pall of realism (even if briefly) to what is otherwise the traditionally ludicrous level of Stooge capering. One of the Jersey-ites is smacked across the face and he cries out, ""You can't do that! That's assault!"" Then more slaps, pokes, and scrapes are administered, and this quick attempt to place the Stooges within the realm of reality quickly fades away.Given how well-executed the actual Stooge-foolery is, this is a small bump in an otherwise pitch perfect film (so brimming, by the way, with jokes, homages, and asides that it would take multiple viewings to catch them all).

1500223,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005S9EL08,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","One thing is certain when it comes to the Three Stooges: you either get them or you don't. Those that don't never find the humor that comes from their antics. Those that do are die hard fans who love each and every slap and eye poke. These were the comedies that fueled not just one generation but several. Their short films played in theaters across the country only to later on become a daily staple for the TV generation. But their popularity waned and their recognition factor dropped. All that is about to change with the release of this new film.The Farrelly brothers, the comedic team behind DUMB AND DUMBER, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and SHALLOW HAL, are major fans of the original Three Stooges. What they've done is attempt to recreate the stooges original form of comedy for a new generation with three new actors in the roles made famous by Moe, Larry and Curly. They succeed on all levels.The story revolves around three babies dropped off at a Catholic orphanage. As the boys grow they unwittingly terrorize the nuns that run the place. Their antics continually get them into trouble and since they tend to run together they never find a home. When Moe is about to be adopted, he tells his new parents that the best thing would be if they took all three boys. Rather than do that, they take him back and adopt a single child.As the three grow older they remain at the orphanage, helping out on the property and doing their best to keep things running smoothly. Then again these are the three stooges and anything they touch rarely runs smooth.The day comes when the church decides they can no longer fund the orphanage. The children are to be slit up into foster care and the nuns placed elsewhere. The boys can't let that happen and go off in search of fame and fortune so that they can save the day. Ill prepared for the world the sisters trust them to at least give it their best shot.As with the classic stooges' comedies, the three rarely have a clue what is actually going on around them. Seeing them seeking work Lydia (Sofia Vergara) hires them to kill her husband in his sleep explaining he wants to do peacefully. Thinking Mac (Craig Berko), the man with her, is her husband, they accidentally toss him about and land him in the hospital where they try to finish the job. This leads to a hilarious squirt fight using peeing babies in the maternity ward.Eventually the boys meet an old friend from the orphanage named Teddy. Teddy was the boy adopted over Moe. Now a wealthy lawyer, he tells the boys to get in touch with him. As fate would have it, we later find out that Teddy is the husband of Lydia that she wants taken out. Before we get that far the boys have a falling out and Moe sets out on his own only to wind up in the reality series JERSEY SHORE where he slaps the cast of that show like his brothers. Oh how we wish that were true.As the plot threads come together the comedy stays with the whole idea until the problems of each character are solved. The film moves along at a brisk pace and the comedy of the situation is mixed well with the slapstick physical comedy that was what the stooges were noted for.The acting fits the tone and tribute exceptionally well. Chris Diamantopoulos does a great job as Moe, not just in looks but in attitude. Sean Hayes not only looks the part of Larry but sounds just like him as well (his bit with a lobster is hilarious). Will Sasso has always impersonated Curly and he morphs himself into the role with ease here.The Farrelly brothers have captured the essence of the Stooges and brought them back to life on the big screen once more. Fans will be pleased with the outcome of this film which is not only enjoyable on its own merits but makes you long for the original Stooges films as well. That will be one of the biggest benefits of this film, bringing the originals to the attention of yet another generation. If you never loved the Stooges then you will probably get little from this film. If you did love them, you'll appreciate the tribute paid here. Either way if you're looking for comedy with little depth and plenty of laughs, then make sure you rent this one.",3,A FITTING TRIBUTE,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,4153,"['One', 'thing', 'certain', 'when', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'never', 'find', 'humor', 'antics', 'do', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'slap', 'eye', 'poke', 'were', 'comedies', 'fueled', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'generation', 'several', 'short', 'films', 'played', 'theaters', 'country', 'only', 'later', 'become', 'daily', 'staple', 'TV', 'generation', 'popularity', 'waned', 'recognition', 'factor', 'dropped', 'change', 'release', 'new', 'film.The', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'comedic', 'team', 'DUMB', 'AND', 'DUMBER', 'THERE', 'SOMETHING', 'ABOUT', 'MARY', 'SHALLOW', 'HAL', 'are', 'major', 'fans', 'original', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'What', ""'ve"", 'done', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'stooges', 'original', 'form', 'comedy', 'new', 'generation', 'three', 'new', 'actors', 'roles', 'made', 'famous', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'succeed', 'levels.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'three', 'babies', 'dropped', 'off', 'Catholic', 'orphanage', 'boys', 'grow', 'unwittingly', 'terrorize', 'nuns', 'run', 'place', 'antics', 'continually', 'get', 'trouble', 'tend', 'run', 'together', 'never', 'find', 'home', 'When', 'Moe', 'be', 'adopted', 'new', 'parents', 'best', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'took', 'three', 'boys', 'Rather', 'do', 'take', 'back', 'adopt', 'single', 'child.As', 'three', 'grow', 'remain', 'orphanage', 'helping', 'out', 'property', 'doing', 'best', 'keep', 'things', 'running', 'smoothly', 'Then', 'again', 'are', 'three', 'stooges', 'anything', 'touch', 'rarely', 'smooth.The', 'day', 'when', 'church', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'fund', 'orphanage', 'children', 'are', 'be', 'slit', 'up', 'foster', 'care', 'nuns', 'placed', 'elsewhere', 'boys', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'happen', 'go', 'off', 'search', 'fame', 'fortune', 'so', 'can', 'save', 'day', 'Ill', 'prepared', 'world', 'sisters', 'trust', 'least', 'give', 'best', 'shot.As', 'classic', 'stooges', 'comedies', 'three', 'rarely', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'actually', 'going', 'Seeing', 'seeking', 'work', 'Lydia', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'kill', 'husband', 'sleep', 'explaining', 'do', 'peacefully', 'Thinking', 'Mac', 'Craig', 'Berko', 'man', 'husband', 'accidentally', 'toss', 'land', 'hospital', 'where', 'try', 'finish', 'job', 'hilarious', 'squirt', 'fight', 'using', 'peeing', 'babies', 'maternity', 'ward.Eventually', 'boys', 'meet', 'old', 'friend', 'orphanage', 'named', 'Teddy', 'Teddy', 'was', 'boy', 'adopted', 'Moe', 'Now', 'wealthy', 'lawyer', 'boys', 'get', 'touch', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'Teddy', 'husband', 'Lydia', 'taken', 'out', 'get', 'far', 'boys', 'have', 'falling', 'out', 'Moe', 'out', 'own', 'only', 'wind', 'up', 'reality', 'series', 'JERSEY', 'SHORE', 'where', 'cast', 'show', 'brothers', 'Oh', 'how', 'wish', 'were', 'plot', 'threads', 'come', 'together', 'comedy', 'whole', 'idea', 'problems', 'character', 'are', 'solved', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace', 'comedy', 'situation', 'mixed', 'well', 'slapstick', 'physical', 'comedy', 'was', 'what', 'stooges', 'were', 'noted', 'for.The', 'acting', 'tone', 'tribute', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Chris', 'Diamantopoulos', 'great', 'job', 'Moe', 'not', 'just', 'looks', 'attitude', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'not', 'only', 'part', 'Larry', 'just', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'lobster', 'hilarious', 'Will', 'Sasso', 'always', 'impersonated', 'Curly', 'role', 'ease', 'here.The', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'have', 'captured', 'essence', 'Stooges', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'once', 'more', 'Fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'outcome', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'merits', 'long', 'original', 'Stooges', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'benefits', 'film', 'bringing', 'originals', 'attention', 'yet', 'generation', 'never', 'loved', 'Stooges', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'little', 'film', 'did', 'love', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'tribute', 'paid', 'here', 'way', ""'re"", 'looking', 'comedy', 'little', 'depth', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'then', 'make', 'sure', 'rent', 'one']",N/A

Honestly, I love the original movies and shorts the Stooges did, so much that I was skeptical of this movie when I first heard about it. I got to see it in theaters and let me tell you, I laughed!  This is genuinely funny, and should be appreciated for what it is: a very well done homage to the Stooges, with some modern touches but still keeping the heart, spirit (and eye pokes) of the originals intact.The three actors chosen to play the Stooges did a superb job -they didn't mimic or imitate, they became. They owned the characters and did outstanding jobs in allowing the original characters to flow thru them, yet not doing mind-numbing imitations that fans would have seen thru in a minute. Look, this movie is not an effects filled, epic battles & action movie, nor is it ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" -it's the Three Stooges, for crying out loud...I realize nothing will ever beat the original Stooges; whether it was the Shemp years or the Curly years, they will always be the best -period.

That's probably why most critics gave it so-so reviews. However, if you appreciate their timing and sense of sarcasm and slapstick, you'll appreciate what these actors did to create an honorable tribute to the stooges with a lot of original references, but also updates for modern times. This hour-and-a-half-long romp is even divided into 3 segments that closely resemble the feel of the shorts. Even the child &#34;Moe&#34; is really true to the part.

I was not looking for a script written by  Ben Hecht or directed by Orson Welles only in the efforts of the actors in making me BELIEVE they were the Stooges incarnate!Everyone's favorite Stooge, Curly, was masterfully portrayed by Will Sasso.....his copy-perfect simple mindedness, Jersy accent (with his butchering of the English language) and physical antics completely sold me!  Sean Hayes as Larry, was the least identical looking of the trio however his faithful third string role, vocalizations and plethora of frozen facial expressions (mostly bewilderment) cemented my approval.  Lastly, Chris Diamantopoulos (who???) was the looney leader Moe and likewise looked, acted and spoke as good as the original.  These guys could go on the road and play colleges, comedy clubs, do commercials and play recurring roles in todays endless cinematic preoccupation with creating new material from the older, proven movies and shows......All are multi-talented and kudos to the director and choreographer who helped them bring our beloved Three Stooges to life!

They asked for and got actors and performances which uncannily resemble the original Moe, Curly, and Larry in speech, movement, and gags.  Close your eyes and you could hear the originals; open them and you'd still be surprised at how closely the two trios look alike (although Will Sasso as Curly is a lot bigger than his pals).  Contrary to the real stooges who were moaning in the real world about the gall of making a new Stooge show, this Stooge effort does honor to the original Stooges and brings their hijinks to life again.Even Joan Howard Maurer, Moe Howard's daughter, thought the new Stooges ""had the moves down,"" and at times ""thought she caught a glimpse of her dad.""  The movie cuts both ways: if you loved the first stooges you'll enjoy this movie; if you didn't love them, this movie will likely leave you as bewildered as before.  I grew up on the Stooges and have always been a fan, even to the point of buying and reading Moe Howard's biography of the group.This movie is funny.  It starts a little slowly with the Stooges growing up in the orphanage but quickly builds up comedic steam.  They leave the orphanage to try to raise money enough to keep it open, not realizing until later why the institution was in such deep financial water.  They get finagled into being the stooges for a knock-your-eyes-out Sofia Vergara, playing Lydia who wants to off her husband.  Along the way there's the mandatory crisis and split preceded by the most hilarious non-stop eye-poke, face-slap Stoogery ever.Moe makes it to ""The Jersey Shore"" show as part of the ensemble.  Dunderheads whined when they saw Moe eye-poke Snooky on the trailers, not realizing that (a) he was doing it to Snooky--how great is that? and (b) he proceeds to stooge-slap, head-konk, and otherwise clobber the rest of the cast.  If Moe's turn on Jersey Shore doesn't make you laugh, then your sense of humor got thrown out with yesterday's trash.My wife doesn't like the Stooges and finds her male relatives' worshipping of Moe, Curly, and Larry inexplicable.  But she burst out laughing until gasping several times in the movie (to my surprise).  The baby pee-pee scene was far funnier than it sounds, and she laughed until nearly breathless.  (Maybe memories of our first son repeatedly peeing on my shirts because his diaper didn't fit well over his umbilical stub came to mind.)This Farrelly effort far outshines in comedy the old Three Stooges' feature length films (which admittedly lacked either Curly or Shemp, the latter quite funny in his own right).

I was even more shocked when I laughed in several spots. I was very shocked when it was over and I thought, ""That was a fun little movie.""Keep in mind, this is not masterpiece. However, it is a fun, short movie that knows what it is, sticks to that, and doesn't aspire to be much.The actors do a great job impersonating the real Three Stooges (from the Curly era, of course).

The positive part of me hoped that it would be a cute homage to the originals, not as good, but enjoyable on its own, similar to the Little Rascals movie. The negative part expected it to be an insult to the stooges' memory.What I got was actually a little of both. While the impressions of the Stooges were surprisingly good, especially Will Sasso's Curly, the general concept was not faithful to the originals. The stooges are supposed to be chaos in an otherwise normal world. Their relationships with others hinge on the fact that the other people assume they are normal at the start, but learn over time that they are stooges and are upset by their antics. In other words, the world is the straight-man to the comedy of the stooges. This movie goes completely against that premise. From the very beginning we are made to believe that there is something wrong with these boys, but that there is also something strange and/or funny about everyone else in the world. From the singing nun (Jennifer Hudson) to the overtly perfect and cute little boy to the evil and conniving wife (Sofia Vergara), these people are far from normal. I mean, how could the cast of Jersey Shore ever be the normal to the stooges' odd?Another thing that irked me about this movie was that it was pushed as a family film with family values and wholesome jokes. There is even a disclaimer at the end urging kids not to try to smack each other like the stooges do. The original films were fun for young and old alike not because Columbia pandered to children but because the comedy was universal and ageless. These film makers should not have tried so hard to aim at a niche.Finally, a nitpick: there is no appearance of Shemp, which I am sorry for. He is definitely the neglected stooge, and it would have been nice to see a small ""hi-ya Shemp"" thrown in there for the fans.",2,I Won't Watch This Again,1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,1954,"['big', 'fan', 'original', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'felt', 'needed', 'see', 'movie', 'dreaded', 'positive', 'part', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'cute', 'homage', 'originals', 'not', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'similar', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'movie', 'negative', 'part', 'expected', 'be', 'insult', 'stooges', 'memory.What', 'got', 'was', 'actually', 'little', 'impressions', 'Stooges', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'especially', 'Will', 'Sasso', 'Curly', 'general', 'concept', 'was', 'not', 'faithful', 'originals', 'stooges', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'chaos', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'world', 'relationships', 'others', 'hinge', 'fact', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'normal', 'start', 'learn', 'time', 'are', 'stooges', 'are', 'upset', 'antics', 'other', 'words', 'world', 'straight-man', 'comedy', 'stooges', 'movie', 'completely', 'premise', 'very', 'beginning', 'are', 'made', 'believe', 'something', 'wrong', 'boys', 'also', 'something', 'strange', 'and/or', 'funny', 'everyone', 'else', 'world', 'singing', 'nun', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'overtly', 'perfect', 'cute', 'little', 'boy', 'evil', 'conniving', 'wife', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'people', 'are', 'far', 'normal', 'mean', 'how', 'could', 'cast', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'ever', 'be', 'normal', 'stooges', 'odd', 'thing', 'irked', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'pushed', 'family', 'film', 'family', 'values', 'wholesome', 'jokes', 'even', 'disclaimer', 'end', 'urging', 'kids', 'not', 'try', 'smack', 'other', 'stooges', 'do', 'original', 'films', 'were', 'fun', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'not', 'Columbia', 'pandered', 'children', 'comedy', 'was', 'universal', 'ageless', 'film', 'makers', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'aim', 'niche.Finally', 'nitpick', 'appearance', 'Shemp', 'am', 'sorry', 'definitely', 'neglected', 'stooge', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'small', 'hi-ya', 'Shemp', 'thrown', 'fans']",N/A

The off-the-wall humor, and especially the physicality of the humor is successfully captured due to a collaboration of the directors, the actors, the stunt guys, and very importantly the sound guys. In some respects the story is not totally new or original, but the chance to execute the physical gags in the original shorts was obviously too much to pass up. This is clearlynot a movie for everyone. However, in the theatrical showing I went to, the audience clearly enjoyed what has been produced. So, from my point of view the movie is fully successful at re-creating one of the greatest, if not the greatest comedy team. If you are really into the stooges and want to see what is basically the complete collection as we have it, the ultimate collection 20 disc set from Columbia Pictures is not to be missed. Having watched that, I did get the feeling that a lot of the detailed stunts thatthis film steals from the stooges is taken very likely from the 1935 to 1936 period in the disc set.The extras on Blu-ray are very raucous. The history of the Three Stooges is essential, although if you have the 20 disc set you will know a lot of the material. The deleted scenes leaves out a lot, and I do mean a lot of really good content. Casting the Three Stooges is kind of so-so but still lots of fun. The feature behind-the-scenes of the Three Stooges is a blast as well and you can see just how much they owe to the original stooges in sound effects with the feature on the Three Stooges sound effects. TheThree Stooges mashup was fun, but ultimately something I could've done without. It would've been very nice to have a commentary but as it is the combo is great buy, even though the live extras had nothing on it (not even an announcement to say anything about when something might've happened).",5,Amazing and surprisingly a lot of fun,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,1945,"['face', 'making', 'film', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'not', 'really', 'greatest', 'ideas', 'however', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'off-the-wall', 'humor', 'especially', 'physicality', 'humor', 'successfully', 'captured', 'due', 'collaboration', 'directors', 'actors', 'stunt', 'guys', 'very', 'importantly', 'sound', 'guys', 'respects', 'story', 'not', 'totally', 'new', 'original', 'chance', 'execute', 'physical', 'gags', 'original', 'shorts', 'was', 'obviously', 'too', 'much', 'pass', 'up', 'movie', 'everyone', 'However', 'theatrical', 'showing', 'went', 'audience', 'clearly', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'been', 'produced', 'So', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'fully', 'successful', 're-creating', 'one', 'greatest', 'not', 'greatest', 'comedy', 'team', 'are', 'really', 'stooges', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'basically', 'complete', 'collection', 'have', 'ultimate', 'collection', '20', 'disc', 'set', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Having', 'watched', 'did', 'get', 'feeling', 'lot', 'detailed', 'stunts', 'thatthis', 'film', 'steals', 'stooges', 'taken', 'very', 'likely', '1935', '1936', 'period', 'disc', 'set.The', 'extras', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'very', 'raucous', 'history', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'essential', 'have', '20', 'disc', 'set', 'will', 'know', 'lot', 'material', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'out', 'lot', 'do', 'mean', 'lot', 'really', 'good', 'content', 'Casting', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'kind', 'so-so', 'still', 'lots', 'fun', 'feature', 'behind-the-scenes', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'blast', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'owe', 'original', 'stooges', 'sound', 'effects', 'feature', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'sound', 'effects', 'TheThree', 'Stooges', 'mashup', 'was', 'fun', 'ultimately', 'something', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'nice', 'have', 'commentary', 'combo', 'great', 'buy', 'even', 'live', 'extras', 'had', 'nothing', 'not', 'even', 'announcement', 'say', 'anything', 'when', 'something', 'might', ""'ve"", 'happened']",N/A

Will Sasso, Sean Hayes and Chris Diamantopoulos have Curly, Larry and Moe (respectively) down to perfection; so much so, after awhile you forget it's them, which is a real feat for a die-hard Stooge fan like me.  The story, much like a Stooges short, is about the boys leaving their orphanage and heading for the big city, trying to raise enough money to keep the orphanage from being sold and all the kids from going to foster homes - and the ensuing pratfalls and sight gags and eye pokes, etc. that ensue are genuinely funny and engaging, even seeing the stooges in a more modern-day setting.

I saw one negative review suggest that the movie was bad because it had a ""horrible plot."" Another negative review suggested that ""the movie was too predictable."" And a very common criticism here is a reviewer saying something like ""I was never a big fan of The Three Stooges."" To those folks I say: ""What the heck are you doing in front of this movie then?!?""The Farrelly Brother's have pulled off exactly what they set out to do: Emulate the slapstick comedic entertainment that was originally created over half a century ago by Moe Howard, Curly Howard and Larry Fine.So this is not a documentary or depiction of the original Three Stooges lives. This is a movie with three excellent imitations of the original guys that act and look almost identical to the original guys that set out on a mission of absolute silliness with no holds barred slapstick as the cornerstone that glues the infrastructure of the film together....And that's what makes the movie great!Slapstick isn't for everyone. If you watch this movie (or even any ofthe classic Stooges shorts), and you weren't a fan of the Stooges of the late 30s and early 40s, or if you're looking for a movie with a plot that's original and unpredictable, you really are in the wrong place. I indeed was a big Three Stooges fan, and the only reason it took me so long to see this movie was because I was skeptic that any actors other than the original could make funny again in a modern world something that was so uniquely outrageous...not just due to the slapstick, but also due to the individual mannerisms, reactions, idiocy and facial expressions that were such unique signatures of Moe Howard, Curly Howard and Larry Fine.But the Farrelly Brothers did it, along with brilliant portrayals by Chris Diamantopoulos (Moe), Sean Hayes (Larry) and Will Sasso (Curly)! By remaining true to the simple classic slapstick zaniness that made the original Stooges comedic icons of the mid-20th century, The Three Stooges 2012 had me laughing out loud throughout the entire short 90-minute movie.Classic Three Stooges fans will be surprised by how reminiscently hilarious this movie ultimately is.

I will acknowledge that they can only be imitated and never duplicate, especially Curly. While I didn't want to enjoy this film, I found myself laughing in the beginning at the first gag when an infant's stooge fingers came out of a sack and ""doinked"" the nun in the eyes. The young stooges were also a treat as they were able to imitate the famous gags and lines. One had to have some familiarity with the Stooges to catch the humor such as when they tried to revive a nun by gently slapping her (Larry David) on the face and saying ""Say a few parables"" instead of their normal ""Say a few syllables"" line. Yes, I thought that was funny. I also enjoyed the the way they used their titles and sign names as puns the way the original Stooges did in their famous lawyers ""Dewey Cheatam, and Howe"" now used in ""Car Talk"" gag credits.There were scenes that worked and some that didn't work. Sean Hayes as Larry was the weakest of the three, perhaps because his head was too thin. There were some lines that they missed. Instead of ""Where are your manners?"" they should have used ""Where's your Emily Post."" When Curly spins around on the floor, that needs to be sped up slightly. It doesn't work in real time.

In the last year there have been some awful comedies. Ones that come to mind are ""Bucky Larson"" and ""Jack And Jill"". I did find a few parts of those movies funny and laughed a few times. I didn't even smile at this one. Even going in with very low expectations this was very bad. The best thing I can say about this one is that it was exactly what I expected.

1500280,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005S9EL08,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[17, 45]","Oh, what might have been. The Three Stooges has had a wild ride towards the silver screen, with many big names having been attached or approaching playing the iconic trio of morons from yesteryear.  At one point, Sean Penn, Jim Carrey, and Benicio Del Toro were all but set to be a part of the Farrelly Brothers' film, but each saw the writing on the wall and ran for the hills. That's a trio that could make any piece of crap script at the very least workable, and any terrible movie watchable. Without them, though, The Three Stooges is a fail of epic proportions, and not even the most die hard aficionado is going to appreciate this level of damage done to their comedy heroes.It's clear what the Farrellys were thinking, hoping that they could recapture the magic of  Dumber and Dumber and slap a more recognizable name on it. Their Stooges, played by Sean Hayes, Chris Diamantopolous, and Will Sasso, are just more violent versions of Harry and Lloyd. The major difference is in the substance of the characters, and while Dumb and Dumber wasn't exactly a tour de force, there was enough in it to sustain an entire full length feature. The Three Stooges, throughout their careers, have only done skits or shorts. Watching somebody get hit in the head with a mallet is great fun....for about five minutes. After about the tenth time of watching it you'll be ready to poke yourself in the eyes and shove lobsters down your own pants.Cleverly structured like a series of Stooges episodes, the trio are literally thrown on the doorstep of an orphanage as babies, and pay attention closely because these are the only times where a decent laugh can be found and they have nothing to do with the three stars. Larry David and Jane Lynch make up two of the nuns at who run the place, and you haven't lived until you've seen the grouchy old Curb Your Enthusiasm star in a habit and hating life. Decades pass, yet nobody ages, and because there must be a plot that involves more than falling off of ladders, the Stooges must somehow secure $830,000 to save the orphanage from going under. Enter Sofia Vergara as a scandalous gold digger looking to off her husband for his money, and somehow those orange oompa loompas from the Jersey Shore show up, as well. Why? Because the film simply isn't stupid enough, the Farrellys must completely turn brains into mush.The occasional ""Nyuk nyuk"" does not a successful comedy make, and while the three stars may have the voices and mannerisms of the trio down pat, there isn't a hint of originality anywhere. Laughs are few, far between, and with the uncomfortable realization of watching a slow moving car wreck. A new low is reached as they wield newborn babies like weapons of mass urination in a hospital room. Does that sound like The Three Stooges? Not really. It's Farrelly Brothers humor, which is nothing like what Moe, Larry, and Curly perfected for so long. So not only is The Three Stooges terribly unfunny, but it has no clue what made them tick.",1,It's as bad as you thought.,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,2993,"['Oh', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'had', 'wild', 'ride', 'silver', 'screen', 'many', 'big', 'names', 'having', 'been', 'attached', 'approaching', 'playing', 'iconic', 'trio', 'morons', 'yesteryear', 'one', 'point', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'were', 'set', 'be', 'part', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'film', 'saw', 'writing', 'wall', 'ran', 'hills', 'trio', 'could', 'make', 'piece', 'crap', 'script', 'very', 'least', 'workable', 'terrible', 'movie', 'watchable', 'though', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'fail', 'epic', 'proportions', 'not', 'even', 'most', 'die', 'hard', 'aficionado', 'going', 'appreciate', 'level', 'damage', 'done', 'comedy', 'heroes.It', 'clear', 'what', 'Farrellys', 'were', 'thinking', 'hoping', 'could', 'recapture', 'magic', 'Dumber', 'Dumber', 'slap', 'more', 'recognizable', 'name', 'Their', 'Stooges', 'played', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Chris', 'Diamantopolous', 'Will', 'Sasso', 'are', 'just', 'more', 'violent', 'versions', 'Harry', 'Lloyd', 'major', 'difference', 'substance', 'characters', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'was', 'enough', 'sustain', 'entire', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'careers', 'have', 'only', 'done', 'skits', 'shorts', 'Watching', 'somebody', 'get', 'hit', 'head', 'mallet', 'great', 'fun', '.for', 'five', 'minutes', 'tenth', 'time', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'be', 'ready', 'poke', 'eyes', 'shove', 'lobsters', 'down', 'own', 'pants.Cleverly', 'structured', 'series', 'Stooges', 'episodes', 'trio', 'are', 'literally', 'thrown', 'doorstep', 'orphanage', 'babies', 'pay', 'attention', 'closely', 'are', 'only', 'times', 'where', 'decent', 'laugh', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'three', 'stars', 'Larry', 'David', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'make', 'up', 'two', 'nuns', 'who', 'run', 'place', 'have', ""n't"", 'lived', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'grouchy', 'old', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'star', 'habit', 'hating', 'life', 'Decades', 'pass', 'nobody', 'ages', 'must', 'be', 'plot', 'more', 'falling', 'ladders', 'Stooges', 'must', 'somehow', 'secure', '830,000', 'save', 'orphanage', 'going', 'Enter', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'scandalous', 'gold', 'digger', 'looking', 'husband', 'money', 'somehow', 'orange', 'oompa', 'loompas', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'show', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'Why', 'film', 'simply', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'enough', 'Farrellys', 'must', 'completely', 'turn', 'brains', 'mush.The', 'occasional', 'Nyuk', 'nyuk', 'not', 'successful', 'comedy', 'make', 'three', 'stars', 'may', 'have', 'voices', 'mannerisms', 'trio', 'down', 'pat', ""n't"", 'hint', 'originality', 'anywhere', 'Laughs', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'uncomfortable', 'realization', 'watching', 'slow', 'moving', 'car', 'wreck', 'new', 'low', 'reached', 'wield', 'newborn', 'babies', 'weapons', 'mass', 'urination', 'hospital', 'room', 'sound', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Not', 'really', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'humor', 'nothing', 'what', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'perfected', 'so', 'long', 'So', 'not', 'only', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'terribly', 'unfunny', 'clue', 'what', 'made', 'tick']",N/A

Chris Diamantopoulos was uncanny as Moe, spot on perfect.  Sasso and Hayes were excellent as Curly and Larry.  I pictured Sasso as Curly years ago.  The kids who played The Three Stooges in the early part of the movie were also perfectly cast.  What makes this movie so special to me is I grew up in the sixties watching The Three Stooges on TV.  This movie captures the essence of the original stooges with what appears to me to be little or no computer animation thank God.  This is a comedy for the whole family.  The Three Stooges made over three hundred short films and rightfully won an Academy Award for short subject I believe back in the late 1930's.  These Three Stooges handled the slapstick with the same comedic precision as the original stooges.  There are several scenes shot the same way the original was done i.e. dummies thrown over a wall dressed like the stooges, then switching to the live stooges right after landing on the ground.  I thought that was brilliant to keep with the old traditional and original style of filming.  Other directors might have made all the slapstick scenes with a computer.  I thank the Farrelly brothers for this movie because it was just like an extra special episode of The Three Stooges.  I'm sure the families of Moe Howard, Curly Howard and Larry Fine would be very proud of this film.  There are several other name stars who appear in this movie, Larry David as Sister Mary Mengele very funny.  I hope for a few more episodes.  This movie made a 54 year old man laugh and be happy to see there are still some people in Hollywood who can redo a classic act the way they would have done it then.  The fact that this was shot in color in no way hurts the feel of the movie.  To those who think it's all just about slapping one another, listen to the very funny dialogue.

Most of the gags are repeats of what the Stooges did; but that's to be expected and they were still funny.  My teenage son and I watched the movie and we were laughing out loud a lot. I am not sure what people who trashed the movie were expecting.  I suspect many of them did not like the original Stooges either.  These guys do a great job of re-enacting their mannerisms and gags.  If you can get past the fact that they are not the original Stooges, the movie is very good and very funny.",5,Tough Act to Follow But They Did a Great Job,1343520000,"07 29, 2012",2012,575,"['Obviously', 'Stooges', 'are', 'tough', 'act', 'follow', 'guys', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Most', 'gags', 'are', 'repeats', 'what', 'Stooges', 'did', 'be', 'expected', 'were', 'still', 'funny', 'teenage', 'son', 'watched', 'movie', 'were', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'lot', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'trashed', 'movie', 'were', 'expecting', 'suspect', 'many', 'did', 'not', 'original', 'Stooges', 'either', 'guys', 'do', 'great', 'job', 're-enacting', 'mannerisms', 'gags', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'original', 'Stooges', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'funny']",N/A

1500293,AP3B615GM191G,B005S9EL08,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[83, 93]","The Three Stooges, and their unique brand of slapstick humor, are an American comedy institution.  The trouble is, you are either rolling on the floor laughing at them, or you think there material is the dumbest shtick in the world.  If you fall into the latter category, stop reading this review now, as you will hate this movie with a flaming passion.  If a Stooge appreciator or connoisseur, however, then this big-screen adaptation will have you short of breath once again!For a basic plot summary, this movie follows the head-slapping, hair-pulling, eye-poking adventures of Larry (Sean Hayes), Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos), & Curly (Will Sasso) as they try to raise money to save an orphanage.  In typical Stooge fashion, they bumble around for awhile and engage in the sort of hijinks one would expect from the trio.  Along the way, they run into the cast of the Jersey Shore, Moe becomes a famous reality star, and the gang even have to mend a relationship issue stemming from their collective past.This film is a rousing experience because it works on two (well, three, really) levels...1. It serves as an ode to the original Stooges.  Though nothing will ever quite be the same as old Howard, Fine, & Howard, this movie captures their subtle nuances as best as humanly possibly.  The original sound effects are used, the casting is spot-on (especially with Moe...one could close their eyes in the theater and think it was Moe Howard himself), and the physical comedy is at its best.  Besides the actors themselves, though, some of the plots, music, and camerawork itself honors the original shorts.  The movie is split up into three ""shorts"", the music is the same cackling Stooges theme heard countless times throughout the ages, and some of the cut-aways feature easily-identified dummies being hurled or pummeled in obvious fashion (as happened frequently in the original slapped-together shorts).2. It is also a re-imagining of the Stooges for a new generation.  Instead of re-treading the same old material, the Farelly brothers put the trio in today's time period, what with its similar Depression-era themes and new technological gadgets that befuddled the bumblers even further.  The directors even add a bit of a backstory to the characters that actually works pretty well in the context of the overall plot.  You can't say this film is utterly devoid of sense or emotion.3. Finally, in keeping with the hearty Stooges tradition, this movie is just plain funny!  As a huge Stooge fan, I came into it with a healthy mixture of excitement and doubt.  It vastly exceeded even my wildest expectations and had me belly-laughing throughout.  Does every single scene work for everyone?  Of course not.  However, enough DO work to keep you yuking (or nyuking, if you will) it up for ninety minutes.Overall, the bottom line for this flick is this: If you enjoy Stooge-type humor, give this one a shot...I think you'll be glad you did!  If you don't care for the slapstick style, than stay away or prepare to be bored.  This is also a very child-friendly flick that can be enjoyed by literally all ages.",5,"An Ode AND A Re-Imagining, With Both Working Splendidly",1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,3110,"['Three', 'Stooges', 'unique', 'brand', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'are', 'American', 'comedy', 'institution', 'trouble', 'are', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughing', 'think', 'material', 'dumbest', 'shtick', 'world', 'fall', 'latter', 'category', 'stop', 'reading', 'review', 'now', 'will', 'hate', 'movie', 'flaming', 'passion', 'Stooge', 'appreciator', 'connoisseur', 'however', 'then', 'big-screen', 'adaptation', 'will', 'have', 'short', 'breath', 'once', 'again', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'head-slapping', 'hair-pulling', 'eye-poking', 'adventures', 'Larry', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Moe', 'Chris', 'Diamantopoulos', 'Curly', 'Will', 'Sasso', 'try', 'raise', 'money', 'save', 'orphanage', 'typical', 'Stooge', 'fashion', 'bumble', 'awhile', 'engage', 'sort', 'hijinks', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'trio', 'way', 'run', 'cast', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'Moe', 'famous', 'reality', 'star', 'gang', 'even', 'have', 'mend', 'relationship', 'issue', 'stemming', 'collective', 'past.This', 'film', 'rousing', 'experience', 'two', 'well', 'three', 'really', 'levels', '1', 'ode', 'original', 'Stooges', 'nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'quite', 'be', 'same', 'old', 'Howard', 'Fine', 'Howard', 'movie', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'as', 'best', 'humanly', 'possibly', 'original', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'casting', 'spot-on', 'especially', 'Moe', 'one', 'could', 'close', 'eyes', 'theater', 'think', 'was', 'Moe', 'Howard', 'physical', 'comedy', 'best', 'actors', 'though', 'plots', 'music', 'camerawork', 'original', 'shorts', 'movie', 'split', 'up', 'three', 'shorts', 'music', 'same', 'cackling', 'Stooges', 'theme', 'heard', 'countless', 'times', 'ages', 'cut-aways', 'feature', 'easily-identified', 'dummies', 'being', 'hurled', 'pummeled', 'obvious', 'fashion', 'happened', 'frequently', 'original', 'slapped-together', 'shorts', '.2', 'also', 're-imagining', 'Stooges', 'new', 'generation', 'Instead', 're-treading', 'same', 'old', 'material', 'Farelly', 'brothers', 'put', 'trio', 'today', 'time', 'period', 'what', 'similar', 'Depression-era', 'themes', 'new', 'technological', 'gadgets', 'befuddled', 'bumblers', 'even', 'further', 'directors', 'even', 'add', 'bit', 'backstory', 'characters', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'context', 'overall', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'utterly', 'devoid', 'sense', 'emotion.3', 'Finally', 'keeping', 'hearty', 'Stooges', 'tradition', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'huge', 'Stooge', 'fan', 'came', 'healthy', 'mixture', 'excitement', 'doubt', 'vastly', 'exceeded', 'even', 'wildest', 'expectations', 'had', 'belly-laughing', 'Does', 'single', 'scene', 'work', 'everyone', 'course', 'not', 'However', 'enough', 'DO', 'work', 'keep', 'yuking', 'nyuking', 'will', 'up', 'ninety', 'minutes.Overall', 'bottom', 'line', 'flick', 'enjoy', 'Stooge-type', 'humor', 'give', 'one', 'shot', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'slapstick', 'style', 'stay', 'away', 'prepare', 'be', 'bored', 'also', 'very', 'child-friendly', 'flick', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'literally', 'ages']",N/A
