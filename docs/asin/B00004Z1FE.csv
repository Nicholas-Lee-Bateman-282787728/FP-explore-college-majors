560562,A1V5FQT8O62EAV,B00004Z1FE,"Al. T ""(b-_-)b""","[3, 5]","People often pigeon hole Beat Takeshi as a violent and twisted auteur. Because of his films released in the United States, it is easy to understand why that is the case. The films that received US release like Violent Cop, Gonin (which he only starred in), and Sonatine are bloody, masochistic and some might argue misogynistic. The one dimension of Beat Takeshi that is often overshadowed by the violence is his humor. Sonatine, Hana-Bi and Boiling Point (not the Wesley Snipes movie) although gruesome, have many irreverent and light-hearted moments. Hopefully films like Kikujiro will change people's perception of this multi-faceted film maker.Kikujiro thankfully is a fun departure from the usual world of death, mutilation and rape. It, like Hana-Bi (still Beat Takeshi's best effort), is a road film. Kikujiro is a different take on the genre, it is about a small-time thug who is ordered by his wife to accomany the grandson of a friend to find his mother in a far off town. What I liked about this film was that Beat Takeshi toned down everything that he is known for, but kept the essence of a &quot;Beat Takeshi film&quot; in tact. The dead pan delivery, the quirky humor and tight story telling all remain in this successful attempt to broaden his audience.",4,A different side of Beat Takeshi,984441600,"03 13, 2001",2001,1269,"['People', 'often', 'pigeon', 'hole', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'violent', 'twisted', 'auteur', 'films', 'released', 'United', 'States', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'case', 'films', 'received', 'US', 'release', 'Violent', 'Cop', 'Gonin', 'only', 'starred', 'Sonatine', 'are', 'bloody', 'masochistic', 'might', 'argue', 'misogynistic', 'one', 'dimension', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'often', 'overshadowed', 'violence', 'humor', 'Sonatine', 'Hana-Bi', 'Boiling', 'Point', 'not', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'movie', 'gruesome', 'have', 'many', 'irreverent', 'light-hearted', 'moments', 'Hopefully', 'films', 'Kikujiro', 'will', 'change', 'people', 'perception', 'multi-faceted', 'film', 'maker.Kikujiro', 'thankfully', 'fun', 'departure', 'usual', 'world', 'death', 'mutilation', 'rape', 'Hana-Bi', 'still', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'best', 'effort', 'road', 'film', 'Kikujiro', 'different', 'take', 'genre', 'small-time', 'thug', 'who', 'ordered', 'wife', 'accomany', 'grandson', 'friend', 'find', 'mother', 'far', 'off', 'town', 'What', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'toned', 'down', 'everything', 'known', 'kept', 'essence', 'quot', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'film', 'quot', 'tact', 'dead', 'pan', 'delivery', 'quirky', 'humor', 'tight', 'story', 'telling', 'remain', 'successful', 'attempt', 'broaden', 'audience']",N/A
560563,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B00004Z1FE,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[1, 3]","It's funny to me to actually see an Asian film that isn't bloody, doesn't have samurai or other martial artists, or isn't in some way a horror film. I just got used to the stigma that comes with Asian cinema. But Kikujiro is different than those other Asian films brought to American shores. In many ways, it has a great deal more heart than I expected, and it's actually a delightful film to watch.The story follows a young boy named Masao, who's seemingly always down, as he starts his summer vacation. And it doesn't start well. His friends are going away for vacation, his soccer team no longer practices, and his grandmother, who raises him, is never home because of work. That's when Masao discovers a picture of his mother and decides to find her. During the early moments of his journey, he meets a strange man and his wife, and the man's wife tells him to help little Masao get to where his mother is. This man, who will be called ""Mister"" from here on out, has other plans, and decides to take a side-trip. This trip leaves them broke, and they are forced to find other ways of traveling to where Masao's mother is. This kicks off a series of events and introduces a unique and hilarious cast of characters. What soon becomes clear is that Mister, an ex-gangster, wants nothing more than to make Masao happy, no matter what it takes, and whose tail he has to kick.What's great about Kikujiro is that it never gets too mature. In fact, it's the immaturity of the two main characters, more so on the part of Mister, that drives this story along. This movie is a comedy on all ends and will do anything to get a laugh, and it succeeds brilliantly, and occasionally shockingly, at this. This is a fun movie. I'd recommend Kikujiro to anyone who wants a new spin to their Asian cinema.",5,Pure Delight,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,1790,"['funny', 'actually', 'see', 'Asian', 'film', ""n't"", 'bloody', ""n't"", 'have', 'samurai', 'other', 'martial', 'artists', ""n't"", 'way', 'horror', 'film', 'just', 'got', 'used', 'stigma', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'Kikujiro', 'different', 'other', 'Asian', 'films', 'brought', 'American', 'shores', 'many', 'ways', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'heart', 'expected', 'actually', 'delightful', 'film', 'watch.The', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Masao', 'who', 'seemingly', 'always', 'down', 'summer', 'vacation', ""n't"", 'start', 'well', 'friends', 'are', 'going', 'away', 'vacation', 'soccer', 'team', 'no', 'longer', 'practices', 'grandmother', 'who', 'never', 'home', 'work', 'when', 'Masao', 'picture', 'mother', 'decides', 'find', 'early', 'moments', 'journey', 'strange', 'man', 'wife', 'man', 'wife', 'help', 'little', 'Masao', 'get', 'where', 'mother', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'Mister', 'here', 'out', 'other', 'plans', 'take', 'side-trip', 'trip', 'broke', 'are', 'forced', 'find', 'other', 'ways', 'traveling', 'where', 'Masao', 'mother', 'off', 'series', 'events', 'unique', 'hilarious', 'cast', 'characters', 'What', 'soon', 'clear', 'Mister', 'ex-gangster', 'nothing', 'more', 'make', 'Masao', 'happy', 'matter', 'what', 'tail', 'kick.What', 'great', 'Kikujiro', 'never', 'too', 'mature', 'fact', 'immaturity', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'so', 'part', 'Mister', 'story', 'along', 'movie', 'comedy', 'ends', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'laugh', 'brilliantly', 'occasionally', 'shockingly', 'fun', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Kikujiro', 'anyone', 'who', 'new', 'spin', 'Asian', 'cinema']",N/A

560566,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00004Z1FE,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[12, 16]","With the deaths of Akira Kurosawa and Juzo Itami, I wondered if there was anybody who could take their place.  The answer came in the form of Takeshi Kitano's 1999 release, Kikujiro.  Funny, tender, heartbreaking, full of hope are a few adjectives I'd use to describe this brilliant movie.The story involves Masao, a sad-faced Tokyo boy who lives with his grandmother.  With his best friend going away to the sea, he only has a long lonely summer ahead of him.After finding a snap of his mother, along with an address in Toyohashi, Masao wants to go visit her.  Thanks to a married couple who are friends of his grandmother, he gets his wish.  As the woman says, ""Someone must accompany you.""The next shot shows exactly who that somebody is; it is her husband, Kikujiro, and he's not too thrilled.  Kikujiro, played by Takeshi Kitano, is an unemployed former small-time yakuza, as evidenced by a horrifying tattoo on his back.  He is selfish, lacking in common sense, financially irresponsible, bullying and insulting people into getting his own way.Poor Masao has to suffer through Kikujiro's bullying, not only toward him but to those they encounter.  Kikujiro gambles away all their travelling money at the bike races.  His reactions and outbursts after each race result are simply funny.A constant problem is getting a ride to Toyohashi, and Kitano injects a comic element in their hapless attempts.  Kikujiro even bullies a hotel desk attendant to abandon his duties and drive them, which he does to a truck stop.  There, he picks a fight with a trucker disgruntled by his abruptness.  Kikujiro not only smashes his driver's side truck window with a rock but beats him with a stick(!)  Kikujiro's attempts to finagle a ride playing a blind man come to naught.  One driver refuses, to which Kikujiro insults him and in the process, blows his cover.  The other driver simply hits him without stopping.  Another time, they try to get a car by placing a nail in the middle of the road.  The car's tire blows out and careens down an embankment, to which the pair leg it down the highway. The next scene, they are in a car, to which Masao tells his guardian how better it is to simply ask, to which Kikujiro says, ""Shut up, smartass.""Of the strangers whom they encounter, the Travelling Man, an idealistic poet who travels across Japan singing songs and reading poetry, is the nicest of the bunch, and not only is it he who takes them to Toyohashi but also suggests they camp at a beach for a few days.Second place goes to a teenage girl, who persuades her boyfriend to take the pair at least partway.  She masterfully juggles oranges and has her boyfriend imitate a coin-op toy that does a hip-hop dance.  Kitano adds mechanical sound effects during his performance.The scene where Masao and Kikujiro reach Toyohashi and discover what has happened to Masao's mother is simply heart wrenching.  Not as heartbreaking is when Kikujiro goes to where his own mother resides, but it is the first scene where Kikujiro softens towards the boy.  When he suggests they go back home, Masao holds his hand for the first time.Kikujiro's bullying ways finally catch up to him at a fair, where the local yakuza beat him up.  He apologizes to Masao for causing trouble, and from here, his transformation is complete.Two bikers who join Masao, Kikujiro, and the Travelling Man at the beach, are actually pussycats, despite the Nazi helmets worn by the pair and the Danzig III T-shirt worn by the fat biker.  Kikujiro, having met them earlier after finding out about Masao's mother, bullies the fat one into giving him an angel bell charm.  He gives the said charm to Masao as a consolation gift and tells him that an angel will come if he rings the bell.  Masao rings the bell, to no avail.  Well, at least for a while, anyway.The few days spent at the beach to entertain Masao form the best moments of the movie.  There, Kikujiro displays his talent as a promoter or show organizer.  His gruffness and insults return at times, but overall, he has fun.  Among his best devised schemes involve placing a hollowed watermelon rind over the fat biker and having Masao strike him on the head.  Another is the Naked Statues game, a strip version of America's ""Green Light/Red Light.""  The skinnier biker, nicknamed Baldy, really enjoys himself, playing an Indian, an octopus man, and a space alien.  The fat biker, Fatso, has the misfortune of falling into a pit used by farmers for depositing their animal waste for future fertilizer.  The others laugh and run away from their smelly companion.One of the most interesting things about foreign movies is how the translations come across.  Two scenes in particular:  when the pervert, in response to Kikujiro's question of what happens after he pulls down his pants, the subtitles say ""You know.""  I was born in Japan and understand some Japanese.  What the pervert actually said was ""I (...) it.""  The subtitles as presented is more tasteful and diplomatic.Joe Hisashi's wonderful piano score is simply beautiful, and some parts really softened me.Masao discovers his guardian's name until the final scene,  cementing the special bond formed during their travels together.If Kikujiro is a sign of the new Takeshi Kitano, let's have more of it!",5,Kikujiro is a heartwarming magical

The story is interesting because it shows what happens to a tough guy who unexpectedly becomes responsible for a young boy's welfare.The story uses a lot of symbology and fantastic departures from reality that give this movie an almost fairy tale feel, then moves to the reality that young children need to be provided food and shelter.  Many of the people that the two main characters run into seem to serve two roles, they all have their surface level interaction, but they all briefly take on a symbological role that show the similarities between the grown man and the young child.It's very interesting how this movie is presented in an almost playlike fashion at some points.

560568,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00004Z1FE,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","In the title role of this highly original 1999 road movie, Beat Takeshi - with his twitching eye and bow-legged shuffle - looks and acts like a cross between Mickey Rourke and Harvey Keitel with a heavy dose of Walter Matthau's sourpuss demeanor (circa ""The Bad News Bears"") for good measure. He creates a truly memorable character - cynically profane, unapologetically insulting, childishly manipulative and somehow likeable. As the director and screenwriter of said film, Takeshi Kitano - the same guy - has fashioned something quite unique from a tired premise - a boy's search for his mother and the gruff man who begrudgingly helps find her. What could have been a predictable and sentimental wallow, especially with the indiscriminate use of angels as a pervasive symbol, is instead an idiosyncratic, emotionally adroit film that sometimes simmers on the cusp of violence.Yet it becomes ultimately affecting almost in spite of itself. In fact, Kitano does such a resolutely offbeat job that at certain times, the film reminds me of the narrative ellipses and low steady shots that were the trademark of Yasujiro Ozu's home dramas, intermingled with a surprisingly intense Quentin Tarantino-like, in-your-face edginess. The protagonist of the film is really the latch-key nine-year old, Masao, who is on a quest to find the mother whom his grandmother says is ""away working"". With his sad eyes and cherubic face, Yusuke Sekiguchi is perfectly cast as Masao providing the moral compass for the story. Whether he is running with his arms flailing or forlornly playing soccer by himself, he is poignant without being saccharine and completely natural. It is Masao's scrapbook that provides the framework for the film lending each chapter a descriptive title. Every chapter has a distinct character that is, in various turns, playful, hilarious, disturbing, surreal and heartbreaking. Case in point: Kitano is not afraid to use a child molester as first an uncomfortable source of black humor and then as the subject of Masao's nightmare. My favorite scenes come toward the end when Kikujiro organizes a motley crew of misfits to play games with Masao and have them masquerade as Indians, aliens, marine life and even watermelons. The variety in tone between chapters makes for unexpected tonal shifts, but somehow it works and adds to the greater context of the story.That Kitano is able to manage a consistent filmmaking style with a strong visual sense is a credit to the talent behind the camera - not only Kitano's direction, script and film editing but also his artwork showcased throughout the movie, Katsumi Yanagishima's sharply rendered cinematography and Joe Hisaishi's evocative Windham Hill-esque score. There are some funny sideline performances from Gidayu Great and Rakkyo Ide as Fatso and Baldy, two bikers who turn out to be the Abbott and Costello of soft-hearted slackers; Nezumi Mamura as a free-spirited drifter; Fumie Hosokawa as a relentlessly perky girl with a talent for juggling; and in the opening sequence, Kayoko Kishimoto as Kikujiro's take-no-prisoners wife. Kitano, however, elicits the most laughs if only for the film's central conceit that he gets away with his infantile gangster behavior. One would think the story would climax when Masao comes upon his mother, but Kitano confounds expectations with every new scene. The DVD really has no extras other than a couple of trailers not related to the film (not coincidentally, one is for Walter Salles' ""Central Station"" which has a similar story structure). I know this film has its detractors, especially among fans of Kitano's bloodier work, but I find it intriguingly ambiguous and thoroughly enjoyable.",5,"Beat Takeshi's Audacious, Edgy and Heartwarming Road Movie",1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,3693,"['title', 'role', 'highly', 'original', '1999', 'road', 'movie', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'twitching', 'eye', 'bow-legged', 'shuffle', 'looks', 'acts', 'cross', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'heavy', 'dose', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'sourpuss', 'demeanor', 'circa', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'good', 'measure', 'truly', 'memorable', 'character', 'cynically', 'profane', 'unapologetically', 'insulting', 'childishly', 'manipulative', 'somehow', 'likeable', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'said', 'film', 'Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'same', 'guy', 'fashioned', 'something', 'quite', 'unique', 'tired', 'premise', 'boy', 'search', 'mother', 'gruff', 'man', 'who', 'begrudgingly', 'find', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'predictable', 'sentimental', 'wallow', 'especially', 'indiscriminate', 'use', 'angels', 'pervasive', 'symbol', 'instead', 'idiosyncratic', 'emotionally', 'adroit', 'film', 'simmers', 'cusp', 'violence.Yet', 'ultimately', 'affecting', 'almost', 'spite', 'fact', 'Kitano', 'resolutely', 'offbeat', 'job', 'certain', 'times', 'film', 'narrative', 'ellipses', 'low', 'steady', 'shots', 'were', 'trademark', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'home', 'dramas', 'intermingled', 'surprisingly', 'intense', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino-like', 'in-your-face', 'edginess', 'protagonist', 'film', 'really', 'latch-key', 'nine-year', 'old', 'Masao', 'who', 'quest', 'find', 'mother', 'whom', 'grandmother', 'away', 'working', 'sad', 'eyes', 'cherubic', 'face', 'Yusuke', 'Sekiguchi', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Masao', 'providing', 'moral', 'compass', 'story', 'running', 'arms', 'flailing', 'forlornly', 'playing', 'soccer', 'poignant', 'being', 'saccharine', 'completely', 'natural', 'Masao', 'scrapbook', 'framework', 'film', 'lending', 'chapter', 'descriptive', 'title', 'chapter', 'distinct', 'character', 'various', 'turns', 'playful', 'hilarious', 'disturbing', 'surreal', 'heartbreaking', 'Case', 'point', 'Kitano', 'not', 'afraid', 'use', 'child', 'molester', 'first', 'uncomfortable', 'source', 'black', 'humor', 'then', 'subject', 'Masao', 'nightmare', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'come', 'end', 'when', 'Kikujiro', 'motley', 'crew', 'misfits', 'play', 'games', 'Masao', 'have', 'masquerade', 'Indians', 'aliens', 'marine', 'life', 'even', 'watermelons', 'variety', 'tone', 'chapters', 'unexpected', 'tonal', 'shifts', 'somehow', 'greater', 'context', 'story.That', 'Kitano', 'able', 'manage', 'consistent', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'strong', 'visual', 'sense', 'credit', 'talent', 'camera', 'not', 'only', 'Kitano', 'direction', 'script', 'film', 'editing', 'also', 'artwork', 'showcased', 'movie', 'Katsumi', 'Yanagishima', 'sharply', 'rendered', 'cinematography', 'Joe', 'Hisaishi', 'evocative', 'Windham', 'Hill-esque', 'score', 'are', 'funny', 'sideline', 'performances', 'Gidayu', 'Great', 'Rakkyo', 'Ide', 'Fatso', 'Baldy', 'two', 'bikers', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'soft-hearted', 'slackers', 'Nezumi', 'Mamura', 'free-spirited', 'drifter', 'Fumie', 'Hosokawa', 'relentlessly', 'perky', 'girl', 'talent', 'juggling', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Kayoko', 'Kishimoto', 'Kikujiro', 'take-no-prisoners', 'wife', 'Kitano', 'however', 'most', 'laughs', 'only', 'film', 'central', 'conceit', 'away', 'infantile', 'gangster', 'behavior', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'story', 'would', 'climax', 'when', 'Masao', 'mother', 'Kitano', 'expectations', 'new', 'scene', 'DVD', 'really', 'extras', 'other', 'couple', 'trailers', 'not', 'related', 'film', 'not', 'coincidentally', 'one', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'Central', 'Station', 'similar', 'story', 'structure', 'know', 'film', 'detractors', 'especially', 'fans', 'Kitano', 'bloodier', 'work', 'find', 'intriguingly', 'ambiguous', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable']",N/A
560569,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B00004Z1FE,Ernest Jagger,"[0, 1]","""KIKUJIRO,"" is a charming film in many ways. First, the tough guy persona of director/actor Takeshi Kitano, in the film was delightful to view. His interactions with those around him show that he may be a tough guy on the outside, but on the inside he can be a teddy bear. Takeshi's character in the film highlighted much of his funny side, and for those of you who have not seen Takeshi Kitano in any other role, this is a welcome relief. Because he gave a very funny performance in this film. A sort of dark comedy role, but not too dark: He needs to do more comedies, because I think he would excel in any comedic role. [In fact I think thats how he started out].The films narrative is about a young boy named Masao, who has never met his mother. Masao looks at pictures that his grandmother has put away, and as a lonely young boy, he dreams of the day when he will be reunited with her. Masao has been living with his grandmother, and although she loves young Masao and caters to his needs, Masao wishes to see the mother he does not know. We witness a very lonely boy. With only his grandmother  to care for him, he longs to know the mother he never knew. Grandmother explains that his mother is busy trying to save money up by working hard in the city. But, there is more to his mother than I wish to divulge.You can see just how lonely young Masao is when the young child is now on school break. He continues to play in the school yard, until his teacher tells him school is out now, and for him to enjoy his break. It is here, that Masao decides to go and visit his mother whom he has never met. For his good friend has gone on a vacation with his family, and he finds himself lonelier still without his lone playmate. The film basically deals with the road journey of Masao, who wants to see the mother he never knew, and Takashi Kitano, as the tough-soft guy who takes him on his journey. Takeshi Kitano portrays a petty crook who is given money by his wife to see that Masao makes it safely to his destination. Along the way they have a problems as Kitano gambles away the money [50,000 yen] at a bicycle race track. This was all the money that his wife gave him to see that young Masao arrives safely at his destination.Now without money, they both resort to hitch-hiking in order to get to their destination. Including taking a taxi [which Kitano can't drive very well]. But there is more to the story than that. Along the way Kitano and Masao meet all sorts of interesting and not so interesting people. I liked quite a few of the interactions between Kitano and the strangers he meets on the road. One can see that Kitano does not have very good people skills, as he is constantly in trouble with various characters. All the while, the two journey to see Masao's mother. I do not wish to spoil the ending of the film, or whether or not Masao eventually sees his mother. One thing is for sure, however, and that is this one road trip neither will forget. Recommended. Rent it first, as it might not appeal to all viewers. This is not a typical Kitano film.

He lives with his grandmother, who tells him his mother is far away, and working very hard for him.  Soon after he leaves with the house, he runs into Kikujiro, whom he just calls &quot;mister.&quot;&quot;Mister&quot; is probably a low level thug in some gangster group.  Anyway, he's not too keen on kids, but his girlfriend sees that the boy takes off with mister, and they start across the country to find the boy's mother.At times this movie is very sad.  The little boy has a timeless quality that many a child has evoked in the cinema, from 400 Blows to My Life as a Dog.  When he acts sad, he seems to be so genuinely sad that when he finally does smile, you're that much happier for him.  Kitano doesn't know how to handle life with a kid, at first, but being around him seems to lighten the old boy up.  Still, he plays the stone faced unemotional thug through the movie, though he (almost) doesn't beat anyone up.Later, mister and the kid encounter a few oddball characters.  They all do what they can to cheer the kid up.  This is a great movie.  I wouldn't recommend it for children (children wouldn't like much of it anyway, the humor is so lowkey), but I came to this movie with moderate expectations, and they were exceeded.Takeshi Kitano stepped outside the roles that butter his bread, and helped to make this great movie KIKIJURO.Big ups to Takeshi Kitano.More ups to Yusuke Sekiguchi for his portrayal of the kid.ken32",4,not where his bread is buttered,991353600,"06 1, 2001",2001,1726,"['Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'Sonatine', 'Violent', 'Cop', 'fame', 'mild', 'er', 'middle', 'aged', 'thug', 'man', 'who', 'young', 'boy', 'touching', 'sad', 'funny', 'little', 'movie', 'set', 'present-day', 'Japan.A', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'maybe', '7', 'years', 'old', 'off', 'foot', 'search', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'who', 'mother', 'far', 'away', 'working', 'very', 'hard', 'Soon', 'house', 'Kikujiro', 'whom', 'just', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mister', 'quot', 'probably', 'low', 'level', 'thug', 'gangster', 'group', 'Anyway', 'not', 'too', 'keen', 'kids', 'girlfriend', 'boy', 'mister', 'start', 'country', 'find', 'boy', 'mother.At', 'times', 'movie', 'very', 'sad', 'little', 'boy', 'timeless', 'quality', 'many', 'child', 'evoked', 'cinema', '400', 'Blows', 'My', 'Life', 'Dog', 'When', 'sad', 'be', 'so', 'genuinely', 'sad', 'when', 'finally', 'smile', ""'re"", 'much', 'happier', 'Kitano', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'life', 'kid', 'first', 'being', 'lighten', 'old', 'boy', 'up', 'Still', 'stone', 'faced', 'unemotional', 'thug', 'movie', 'almost', ""n't"", 'beat', 'anyone', 'up.Later', 'mister', 'kid', 'encounter', 'few', 'oddball', 'characters', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'cheer', 'kid', 'up', 'great', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'children', 'children', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'anyway', 'humor', 'so', 'lowkey', 'came', 'movie', 'moderate', 'expectations', 'were', 'exceeded.Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'stepped', 'roles', 'butter', 'bread', 'helped', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'KIKIJURO.Big', 'ups', 'Takeshi', 'Kitano.More', 'ups', 'Yusuke', 'Sekiguchi', 'portrayal', 'kid.ken32']",N/A

After the arrival of the summer holiday little one wants to see his distant mum (whose father is also dead) and his neighbour forces kitano to accompany him during the journey. And a very strange road movie kitano style takes off. the friendship between two grows as the film continues. Kitano learns to be a decent caring man who can bear responsibilities unlike his past. Boy also learns how does it feel to have a father like person around. Duo meets many strange characters on the road and humor is stamped all around these strange guys.characters like Old pervert, motorcyclist duo, drifting poet etc will sure get your attention as well as loosen your nerves and will make your mouth fell off.  Like every good movie story and strange characters are very well set and executed and all these are also served with some Kitanoish sad and cold reality in times. Of course camera and the colorful images of Mr Kitano is floatin' all round this movie. Kitano manages to portray an ordinary character brilliantly.

Overall, this film did not work for me.  Other than the fact that there wasn't a story or much of a climax, the real source of enmity I have for the film is the scene which implies child abuse in the restroom.  To have the old geezer grabbing at a young child's underpants followed by Kitano in the restroom with his pants to his knees was outlandish.  Was that humor?  Hurting a child is not a funny thing.  Kikujiro's neglect of the boy made me wonder what kind of mother would allow her son to be with such a man for days on end without even a phone call home.  I believe Kitano was trying for a bonding film between a man and child.  Instead, we get a loony biker dancing on the beach without clothes on in front of his all-male companions including the child.  This is supposed to entertain.

Misadventures and comedy follow.Kitano has always been known for his crime films and dramas but this is the first time he's made a tolerable comedy-drama with his trademark subtle humor, slow pace and un-cilched style. If you've seen his films then you know what I'm talking about. He takes those qualities and makes a unique film with them. The acting here is pretty good for the most part, especially from Takeshi who is known for being a more silent actor, here he's a sluggish, rude and mean loudmouth with an attitude against almost everyone. It shows in some scenes where he lashes out on everyone around him. It's funny but almost absurd.Now one gripe I have with the film is an almost gratuitious scene where a pedophile comes onto Masao. Nothing sexual happens but Kitano does get the sick bastard back in a funny way. That scene really takes away from the film.Still this is a funny film. It's great to watch on a warm summer afternoon with the volume up loud. The soundtrack is done by Joe Hisaishi who's done some excellent work with Kitano in the past. The music makes you feel real good inside and it flows awfully well with the pace of the movie.I recommend this highly.",4,Kitano does a family film...,1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,1785,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'films', 'Takeshi', 'Kitano', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'directed', 'including', 'newer', 'Dolls', 'Zatoichi', 'can', 'say', 'enjoy', 'almost', 'Boiling', 'Point*', 'really', 'style', 'filmaking.This', 'plot', 'here', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Masao', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'out', 'school', 'summer', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'friends', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'getting', 'what', 'be', 'package', 'photos', 'mother', 'who', 'Masao', 'never', 'met', 'before', 'friend', 'grandmother', 'let', 'husband', 'Kikujiro', 'Kitano', 'take', 'Masao', 'journey', 'Misadventures', 'comedy', 'follow.Kitano', 'always', 'been', 'known', 'crime', 'films', 'dramas', 'first', 'time', 'made', 'tolerable', 'comedy-drama', 'trademark', 'subtle', 'humor', 'slow', 'pace', 'un-cilched', 'style', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'then', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'qualities', 'unique', 'film', 'acting', 'here', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'especially', 'Takeshi', 'who', 'known', 'being', 'more', 'silent', 'actor', 'here', 'sluggish', 'rude', 'mean', 'loudmouth', 'attitude', 'almost', 'everyone', 'scenes', 'where', 'out', 'everyone', 'funny', 'almost', 'one', 'gripe', 'have', 'film', 'almost', 'gratuitious', 'scene', 'where', 'pedophile', 'Masao', 'Nothing', 'sexual', 'happens', 'Kitano', 'get', 'sick', 'bastard', 'back', 'funny', 'way', 'scene', 'really', 'away', 'film.Still', 'funny', 'film', 'great', 'watch', 'warm', 'summer', 'afternoon', 'volume', 'up', 'loud', 'soundtrack', 'done', 'Joe', 'Hisaishi', 'who', 'done', 'excellent', 'work', 'Kitano', 'past', 'music', 'feel', 'real', 'good', 'inside', 'awfully', 'well', 'pace', 'movie.I', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A

Who knows, maybe it's intended to be...Anyway, little Masao lives with his grandmother and has never met his parents: his father is dead and his mother ran away.  He knows where his mother lives, however, and wants to go visit her over the Summer, so his kindly neighbor conscripts her profligate husband to take him.  ""Mister"", as Masao calls him, doesn't make the ideal companion with his absurd behavior and his verbal abuse, but they go off to adventure anyways and learn to really connect with each other.The power this film has lies mostly in its contemplative approach.  It's very humorous and isn't really slow, but the camera does take the time to linger on locales, faces, and characters.  For a few odd parts here and there, it's still really innocent and it seems to show that most people are kind-natured at heart, even when they project an aura of toughness and abusiveness.  An interesting aside to analyze that theme would be the carnival scene, where people intrusted with family entertainment turn out to be violent cheaters, whereas even the heavy-metal biker folk are more than willing to go out of their way to help Masao.The film itself is from Masao's perspective, as a childhood's slightly photographic memory comes into play, mixed a lot with colorful imagination.

And the movie only got better from there.Kikujiro (Kitano) is a gambler and small-time criminal who's also the neighbor of Masao (Yusuke Sekiguchi in his big-screen debut), a lonely, henpecked kid who lives with his grandmother. Masao's mother, according to his grandmother, is off making money to send to his grandmother for his upkeep; one summer break, Masao decides he's going on a quest to find his mother, and Kikujiro ends up being the kid's guardian on the trip. Kikujiro, however, is not the most responsible of guardians, and after the two blow all of Masao's traveling money betting on bike races, they embark on a journey that shows Masao-- and Kikujiro-- that family isn't always about blood ties.Kitano was already well-known as a director by the time this movie came out (Violent Cop, Boiling Point, Sonachine, etc.; Hana-Bi regularly shows up on 100-best lists), but was typecast as a yakuza-film director (much as Miike was before starting to come out with movies like The Bird People in China). Kikujiro has often been looked at as a response to that. As a response, I'm not sure it's all that-- it's still blunt around the edges, an action movie with a soft heart and a hard head. But as a simple road movie, it's pure gold. Sekiguchi is one of those terminally cute kids who doesn't have to do anything but sit there and make faces for people to fall in love with him; he does do some acting, though, and he's good enough at it. Kikujiro, of course, is the real main character here, and Kitano is Kitano. His supporting staff are what seal the deal here; they're strong, funny, and real.
