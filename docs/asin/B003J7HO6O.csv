The world, story and characters, could all be a little better, but I don't complain. It's a good movie, and despite the annoying chameleon, I found some characters quite likable.

This film was apparently originally made in Spanish, but is available in English as well.The animation uses the now mainstream method made popular by Pixar films, though this film's animation is a step down from that you see in Pixar's productions.The basic story line is that endangered species are rapidly disappearing.  So, whenever an endangered or threatened animal is injured or is ill, it is taken to a reserve where it can heal and recover.  But, an unknown organization is stealing endangered animals, and it isn't until later in the show that we find out why...so you'll just have to wait, too.Anyway, the story centers around a pair of lynx and the organization's efforts to capture them.

This movie has great characters, and a lot of action, humor, and heart.

It's about a group of animal friends that are held captive and escape, only to discover there is an even bigger threat outside the facility they were in - someone is capturing endangered species for some presumably nefarious purpose. They have to work together to save each other and figure out exactly who are the bad guys and who are the good guys. The dialogue serves its purpose, but it's a little ponderous - not much humor. The animation is about the same - the animals are cute enough, but backgrounds and details are light, as is usually the case with straight-to-DVD/instant releases.

1347303,A3T5NSG7LMRY0A,B003J7HO6O,Michael Gmirkin,"[0, 1]","Honestly, the cover and description don't do the movie justice. Go see the trailer on YouTube. Then watch the movie. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.I had honestly not heard of this movie until a couple weeks ago when I was browsing a couple other CGI-animated movies. And the first time I saw the title and the cover I honestly passed it by thinking it would be no good.Then for some reason I checked out the trailer. The trailer looked good, so I picked it up. Brought it over to a friend's place and put it on in the background while doing other stuff. His 5 y/o LOVED it and said it was pretty great after the movie was over. So, I watched it when I got home and I'd have to agree. Much better than anticipated. This was a pretty fun one.Crazy scientist. Collecting animals for hare-brained scheme (pun intended; nope, no hares in this one, it's just funny...). The Lynx teams up with several other animals from the 'sanctuary' to escape (goat, chameleon, bird, mole, etc.)... Comedy ensues.Overall, I found it a nice diversion and I'm glad I didn't summarily dismiss it (eventually). I've been watching a lot of CGI stuff lately. Didn't care for the Happily N'Ever After series. This one, I like. I think it ranks up there with a number of its competitors. The animation is good, the plot is decent, it's got a few genuinely funny moments (chameleon's color-chaging camouflage being out of synch with the background by a few seconds during an attempted escape was rather amusing).So yeah, very much worth a watch. Kid approved. Me-approved. Go watch it. Skip Happily N'Ever After.Maybe not quite on the same plane of existence as Shrek, Tangled, Rio, Rango, Happy Feet, Megamind, etc. But it's up there with maybe Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The Reef, Shark Tale, The Wild, Over the Hedge. I guess it's pretty similar to Over the Hedge & the Wild, maybe Open Season? Kind of in the Buddy Animals genre of CGI.",4,Better than expected!
