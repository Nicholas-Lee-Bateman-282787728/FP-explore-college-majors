1695192,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00J0BTEWK,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[7, 7]","This one really surprised me. Its free on prime but I wouldn't have minded paying for it. I wish more of the lo budget, indie flicks were like this one. Kinda like Dark House in a way, in its novel approach, though the latter departs even more from &#34;reality&#34;. You need to like suspending disbelief for this one. The characters seem genuine and feels like you are peeping in on someone's life, though an unusual one for sure. The estranged son returns home to visit his eccentric father who was heavily into nordic legend and occult lore. His house is like a fortress against some evil force that we don't know about yet. He also happens to be having brief episodes of early dementia, which casts doubt on what is really going on, The action happens quickly and it is interspersed with flashbacks that explain the set up. These choices help keep the pace moving along propery. The production values are fine- no soap opera like camera work. Its not one of those, though some of those have entertained me, just not enough of them to avoid me becoming suspicious when I see  that is what I'm getting. I re. commend this one highly if you are into supernatural tales,with a slasher like feel to it. There's violence and the death scenes are good. Again, if you need everything to correspond to the known laws of physics,you might not like it. But then again, you probably wouldn't be into supernatural themes anyway.",4,"Horror Junkie's Review: 4.5 really, a novel supernatural slasheresque flick",1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,1420,"['one', 'really', 'surprised', 'free', 'prime', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'paying', 'wish', 'more', 'lo', 'budget', 'indie', 'flicks', 'were', 'one', 'Kinda', 'Dark', 'House', 'way', 'novel', 'approach', 'latter', 'departs', 'even', 'more', '34', 'reality', '34', 'need', 'like', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'one', 'characters', 'seem', 'genuine', 'feels', 'are', 'peeping', 'someone', 'life', 'unusual', 'one', 'sure', 'estranged', 'son', 'home', 'visit', 'eccentric', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'heavily', 'nordic', 'legend', 'occult', 'lore', 'house', 'fortress', 'evil', 'force', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'yet', 'also', 'be', 'having', 'brief', 'episodes', 'early', 'dementia', 'doubt', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'action', 'quickly', 'interspersed', 'flashbacks', 'explain', 'set', 'up', 'choices', 'help', 'keep', 'pace', 'moving', 'along', 'propery', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'fine-', 'soap', 'opera', 'camera', 'work', 'not', 'one', 'have', 'entertained', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'avoid', 'becoming', 'suspicious', 'when', 'see', 'what', ""'m"", 'getting', 're', 'commend', 'one', 'highly', 'are', 'supernatural', 'tales', 'slasher', 'feel', 'violence', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'Again', 'need', 'everything', 'correspond', 'known', 'laws', 'physics', 'might', 'not', 'then', 'again', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'supernatural', 'themes', 'anyway']",COMPOUND FRACTURE

1695194,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00J0BTEWK,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","There are some who may know the name Tyler Mane. If not then my guess is you've seen him without realizing it. At one time a professional wrestler, Mane made his big break in films playing Sabretooth in the first X-MEN movie. That led to his getting parts in numerous horror and action films over the past 14 years as well as tons of appearances at conventions across the country. Now he steps into as one of the writers and producers of COMPOUND FRACTURE.Mane stars as Michael, a no nonsense father on his way to visit his ailing father Gary (Muse Watson). Along for the ride are Michael's girlfriend Juliette (Renae Geerlings) and his nephew Brandon, a stereotypical brooding teen. It's been years since Michael has been home and the resentment he feels for his father is palpable. But with the death of his sister earlier and a call from his stepmother he decides the time is right to come home and try to make amends.When they arrive at his father's house the first thing they notice is the overabundance of security cameras covering the house. When Gary comes out to greet them he seems to keep a wary eye out and later acts a bit strange. Annabelle (Leslie Easterbrook), Gary's wife, has reached a point where his violent nature has taken its toll on her. She still loves him but can't deal with him any longer. She relates this to Michael, apologizing for leaving, but hoping for the best.As the story progresses we learn that things are not exactly what they seem. Isn't it always that way? Just what happened to Chloe and how she was killed is the centerpiece of the story. A combination of ghost story and cult-like activity join together to make an interesting tale. It seems Chloe's husband and Brandon's father William was heavily involved in the occult, enough so that when he died his ghost lived on and has come to seek retribution and spill evil over the family he left behind. Just who will survive this battle makes for a great story.William is played here by Derek Mears, another horror film regular these days who makes the convention circuit as well. Mears has a menacing appearance when he wants and uses it to full advantage here. One of the few actors able to stand eye to eye with Mane, the face off between these two as they battle for the lives of Mane's loved ones makes for an interesting confrontation.For me, while the entire cast did a great job, the stand out was Mane. With his angry appearance and bad guy wrestler build Mane has been subjected to always playing the heavy in most films he's made. He even played the new Michael Meyers for goodness sake. Here he is given the chance to show that he does indeed have some acting ability and can play the good guy if given the chance. He does a great job of it but at the same time come on Tyler, smile a little more.In the end what we have here is an enjoyable horror film that offers an original story with some great acting to take you on the trip it offers. It's rare that a horror film offers something new these days. Take advantage of the trip this one presents and you just might have a good time.",3,TYLER MANE DOES GOOD,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,3089,"['are', 'who', 'may', 'know', 'name', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'not', 'then', 'guess', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'realizing', 'one', 'time', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'Mane', 'made', 'big', 'break', 'films', 'playing', 'Sabretooth', 'first', 'X-MEN', 'movie', 'led', 'getting', 'parts', 'numerous', 'horror', 'action', 'films', 'past', '14', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'tons', 'appearances', 'conventions', 'country', 'Now', 'one', 'writers', 'producers', 'COMPOUND', 'FRACTURE.Mane', 'stars', 'Michael', 'nonsense', 'father', 'way', 'visit', 'ailing', 'father', 'Gary', 'Muse', 'Watson', 'ride', 'are', 'Michael', 'girlfriend', 'Juliette', 'Renae', 'Geerlings', 'nephew', 'Brandon', 'stereotypical', 'brooding', 'teen', 'been', 'years', 'Michael', 'been', 'home', 'resentment', 'father', 'palpable', 'death', 'sister', 'earlier', 'call', 'stepmother', 'time', 'right', 'come', 'home', 'try', 'make', 'amends.When', 'arrive', 'father', 'house', 'first', 'thing', 'notice', 'overabundance', 'security', 'cameras', 'covering', 'house', 'When', 'Gary', 'out', 'greet', 'keep', 'wary', 'eye', 'out', 'later', 'bit', 'strange', 'Annabelle', 'Leslie', 'Easterbrook', 'Gary', 'wife', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'violent', 'nature', 'taken', 'toll', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'longer', 'Michael', 'apologizing', 'leaving', 'hoping', 'best.As', 'story', 'learn', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'seem', ""n't"", 'always', 'way', 'Just', 'what', 'happened', 'Chloe', 'how', 'was', 'killed', 'centerpiece', 'story', 'combination', 'ghost', 'story', 'cult-like', 'activity', 'join', 'together', 'make', 'interesting', 'tale', 'Chloe', 'husband', 'Brandon', 'father', 'William', 'was', 'heavily', 'involved', 'occult', 'enough', 'when', 'died', 'ghost', 'lived', 'come', 'seek', 'retribution', 'spill', 'evil', 'family', 'left', 'behind', 'Just', 'who', 'will', 'survive', 'battle', 'great', 'story.William', 'played', 'here', 'Derek', 'Mears', 'horror', 'film', 'regular', 'days', 'who', 'convention', 'circuit', 'as', 'well', 'Mears', 'menacing', 'appearance', 'when', 'full', 'advantage', 'here', 'One', 'few', 'actors', 'able', 'stand', 'eye', 'eye', 'Mane', 'face', 'off', 'two', 'battle', 'lives', 'Mane', 'loved', 'ones', 'interesting', 'confrontation.For', 'entire', 'cast', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'stand', 'out', 'was', 'Mane', 'angry', 'appearance', 'bad', 'guy', 'wrestler', 'build', 'Mane', 'been', 'subjected', 'always', 'playing', 'heavy', 'most', 'films', 'made', 'even', 'played', 'new', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'goodness', 'sake', 'Here', 'given', 'chance', 'show', 'indeed', 'have', 'acting', 'ability', 'can', 'play', 'good', 'guy', 'given', 'chance', 'great', 'job', 'same', 'time', 'come', 'Tyler', 'smile', 'little', 'more.In', 'end', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'horror', 'film', 'original', 'story', 'great', 'acting', 'take', 'trip', 'rare', 'horror', 'film', 'offers', 'something', 'new', 'days', 'Take', 'advantage', 'trip', 'one', 'presents', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'good', 'time']",COMPOUND FRACTURE
