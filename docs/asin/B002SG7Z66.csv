1286703,AE8W6OW6A1M5M,B002SG7Z66,Ibochild,"[0, 6]","When Tyler Perry came out with his first film, ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman,"" in 2005, you could forgive at least some of its many shortcomings, because at least his heart was in the right place.  Also, since it was a first effort, you would expect his work to improve with each succeeding effort.  Unfortunately, he's shown little improvement since then.  ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself,"" is Perry's eighth film and just another example of his lack of talent as a writer and director.The basic premise of ""I Can Do Mad All By Myself"" is decent enough.  A selfish nightclub singer, April (Taraji P. Henson) is forced to care for her neice and nephews, when her mother, who was taking care of the children, suddenly disappears. To complicate matters, April is in an abusive relationship and an alcoholic.  In capable hands, this film, at the very least could be a moving, if predictable story about redemption and reclaiming one's sense of self-worth.Unfortunately, in the hands of Tyler Perry, this film is like watching an arguing couple yelling at each other in the street for two hours, broken up only by the arrival of the police. In other words, ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" has the subtlety of a train wreck.It's not enough for Perry to show April's reluctance to take the children, she has to be down right nasty to them.  At every opportunity, April makes insulting remarks directly to the children.  This is not to say that there aren't people like April out there, but any filmmaker worth his salt is going to try his best to find the humanity in the character. Instead, Perry just makes April a monster.Even when Sandino (Adam Rodriguez), a gentle immigrant laborer that is rooming in April's home along with the children, fixes up a dilapidated bedroom for the kids, April refuses to let the children sleep there.As is typical of Perry's films, all of the major characters here are drawn with broad strokes. They are either very good or very bad.  Like April, her adulterous boyfriend Randy (Brian J. White), is also a monster, but of a more sinister kind.In addition to the almost saint-like Sandino, other ""good"" characters include Pastor Brian (Marvin Winans) and Madea (Perry).  The latter character is of course found in nearly all of Tyler Perry's films.  The sassy and overweight character that butchers the English language is a throwback to the ""strong"" mammy roles played by Hattie McDaniel, Louise Beavers and Butterfy McQueen in the 1930s and 1940s. If it were not in a film with a predominantly black cast, the role would likely incite waves of protest among African Americans.While Randy never redeems himself, April eventually comes around, but only after a ""revelation"" that occurs late in the film. Of course this is a revelation only to April and the other characters in the film, but not to the audience who saw it coming a mile away.Tajari P. Henson is a talented actress, that when given a chance can be very engaging on screen.  She was very funny in ""Talk to Me"" and appealing in even minor roles, like her character in the recent ""Larry Crowne."" Unfortunately, her talent is all but wasted in ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself.""On the plus side, there's some good musical performances here and at least some actors got a paycheck, but other than that there's very little to praise here.Many filmmakers, but especially African American filmmakers, don't get the chance to make eight feature films. Perry squanders his opportunity here.  It wouldn't be so bad if Perry at least gave other writers and directors the opportunity to make films under his banner. That would at least provide filmgoers a viable alternative to Perry's efforts.  That's a shame, because there are so many talented filmmakers out there that deserve to have their stories told.  Perry even kept ""For Colored Girls"" for himself to both adapt and direct.  In that sense, Perry is much like April's character in ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself,"" selfish and unwilling to share.",2,"Give It Up, Turn It Loose",1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,3968,"['When', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'film', 'Diary', 'Mad', 'Black', 'Woman', '2005', 'could', 'forgive', 'least', 'many', 'shortcomings', 'least', 'heart', 'was', 'right', 'place', 'Also', 'was', 'first', 'effort', 'would', 'expect', 'work', 'improve', 'succeeding', 'effort', 'Unfortunately', 'shown', 'little', 'improvement', 'then', 'Can', 'Do', 'Bad', 'All', 'Myself', 'Perry', 'eighth', 'film', 'just', 'example', 'lack', 'talent', 'writer', 'director.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'Can', 'Do', 'Mad', 'All', 'Myself', 'decent', 'enough', 'selfish', 'nightclub', 'singer', 'April', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'forced', 'care', 'neice', 'nephews', 'when', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'taking', 'care', 'children', 'suddenly', 'complicate', 'matters', 'April', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'alcoholic', 'capable', 'hands', 'film', 'very', 'least', 'could', 'be', 'moving', 'predictable', 'story', 'redemption', 'reclaiming', 'one', 'sense', 'self-worth.Unfortunately', 'hands', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'film', 'watching', 'arguing', 'couple', 'yelling', 'other', 'street', 'two', 'hours', 'broken', 'up', 'only', 'arrival', 'police', 'other', 'words', 'Can', 'Do', 'Bad', 'All', 'Myself', 'subtlety', 'train', 'wreck.It', 'not', 'enough', 'Perry', 'show', 'April', 'reluctance', 'take', 'children', 'be', 'down', 'right', 'nasty', 'opportunity', 'April', 'insulting', 'remarks', 'directly', 'children', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'people', 'April', 'there', 'filmmaker', 'salt', 'going', 'try', 'best', 'find', 'humanity', 'character', 'Instead', 'Perry', 'just', 'April', 'monster.Even', 'when', 'Sandino', 'Adam', 'Rodriguez', 'gentle', 'immigrant', 'laborer', 'rooming', 'April', 'home', 'children', 'fixes', 'up', 'dilapidated', 'bedroom', 'kids', 'April', 'let', 'children', 'sleep', 'there.As', 'typical', 'Perry', 'films', 'major', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'drawn', 'broad', 'strokes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'bad', 'April', 'adulterous', 'boyfriend', 'Randy', 'Brian', 'J', 'White', 'also', 'monster', 'more', 'sinister', 'kind.In', 'addition', 'almost', 'saint-like', 'Sandino', 'other', 'good', 'characters', 'include', 'Pastor', 'Brian', 'Marvin', 'Winans', 'Madea', 'Perry', 'latter', 'character', 'course', 'found', 'nearly', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'films', 'sassy', 'overweight', 'character', 'English', 'language', 'throwback', 'strong', 'mammy', 'roles', 'played', 'Hattie', 'McDaniel', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'Butterfy', 'McQueen', '1930s', '1940s', 'were', 'not', 'film', 'predominantly', 'black', 'cast', 'role', 'would', 'likely', 'incite', 'waves', 'protest', 'African', 'Americans.While', 'Randy', 'never', 'April', 'eventually', 'around', 'only', 'revelation', 'late', 'film', 'course', 'revelation', 'only', 'April', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'not', 'audience', 'who', 'saw', 'coming', 'mile', 'away.Tajari', 'P.', 'Henson', 'talented', 'actress', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'engaging', 'screen', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'Talk', 'Me', 'appealing', 'even', 'minor', 'roles', 'character', 'recent', 'Larry', 'Crowne', 'Unfortunately', 'talent', 'wasted', 'Can', 'Do', 'Bad', 'All', 'Myself', 'plus', 'side', 'good', 'musical', 'performances', 'here', 'least', 'actors', 'got', 'paycheck', 'other', 'very', 'little', 'praise', 'here.Many', 'filmmakers', 'especially', 'African', 'American', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'make', 'eight', 'feature', 'films', 'Perry', 'opportunity', 'here', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'Perry', 'least', 'gave', 'other', 'writers', 'directors', 'opportunity', 'make', 'films', 'banner', 'would', 'least', 'provide', 'filmgoers', 'viable', 'alternative', 'Perry', 'efforts', 'shame', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'out', 'there', 'deserve', 'have', 'stories', 'told', 'Perry', 'even', 'kept', 'Colored', 'Girls', 'adapt', 'direct', 'sense', 'Perry', 'much', 'April', 'character', 'Can', 'Do', 'Bad', 'All', 'Myself', 'selfish', 'unwilling', 'share']",N/A

1286708,A22RZG1NQ0WAUX,B002SG7Z66,Katrina L. Burchett,"[3, 4]","April's (Taraji P. Henson) niece, Jennifer, and her two nephews, Byron and Manny, need a place to stay.  She doesn't want anything to do with them because, Randy (Brian White), her married boyfriend, doesn't like children, but she lets them move in since they have no place else to go. But just until the one who has been taking care of them is found. Sandino, a good looking Columbian immigrant, is new in town and he also needs a place to live. Even though she's not happy about it, April allows this handyman to rent her basement. April sings in a night club and she likes to sleep all day, but now there are others in her space, and she isn't happy with the new arrangement at all.April is a woman who doesn't care about anyone but herself. She's not a bad person. She's an unhappy person dissatisfied with her life and still burdened by things that happened in her past, so she has a wall up and she is determined not to let anybody in. She doesn't even like it when others tell her that they'll be praying for her. I don't know if she was angry at God or if she didn't think she deserved His love, but I was glad when she realized church was the place to go so she could begin to find peace. And as for the opposite sex, I don't think any man really cared about her until Sandino.Sandino (Adam Rodriguez) is a man with a good heart. Bad things have happened to him in the past, but, unlike April, he isn't holding onto those experiences; at least not in a bad way. He reaches out to others - particularly children - because of what he went through. He is a very likeable character with lots of good attributes.Sixteen year old Jennifer (Hope Olaide Wilson) didn't trust anyone because nobody ever gave her a reason to trust them. She wasn't used to anyone being kind to her unless they wanted something in return and that was sad. She had way too much on her for a girl her age; too many responsibilities and I'm thinking, too many bad memories. She wasn't just an older sister to her brothers, Byron and Manny; she was the one who took care of them. (All of them have been through a lot in their young lives). She was an angry girl who was always on her guard and that was understandable. She was also afraid.  I don't feel like I'm gonna make it - it was really heartbreaking to hear this young girl speak those words. I felt so bad for her.I own only a few of Tyler Perry's plays on DVD and I watch his television shows on occasion, but I have seen every one of his movies and own all but one on DVD.  There are some movies where I couldn't see the Christian theme; however it is very strong in this film and I was glad about that. The church scene had me saying, Amen! Also, I enjoy the movies with Madea because she makes me laugh. She can be a wild woman but she is also a woman of wisdom (unless she's telling Bible stories :). What Madea said to Jennifer at the kitchen table was something this young girl needed to hear. I really liked that scene.I Can Do Bad All by Myself:  I enjoyed the movie and I love to listen to Mary J Blige sing the uplifting song. It was also nice to see Gladys Knight and to hear her sing. And Marvin Winans' songs: You Just Don't Wanna Know /Over it Now/Oh Lord, I Want You to Help Me - so inspirational and healing. I was disappointed when I couldn't find a soundtrack.Good acting, good singing, good messages - One of Tyler Perry's best.",5,Learn to Love,1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,3383,"['April', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'niece', 'Jennifer', 'two', 'nephews', 'Byron', 'Manny', 'need', 'place', 'stay', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'Randy', 'Brian', 'White', 'married', 'boyfriend', ""n't"", 'like', 'children', 'move', 'have', 'place', 'else', 'go', 'just', 'one', 'who', 'been', 'taking', 'care', 'found', 'Sandino', 'good', 'looking', 'Columbian', 'immigrant', 'new', 'town', 'also', 'place', 'live', 'Even', 'not', 'happy', 'April', 'handyman', 'rent', 'basement', 'April', 'sings', 'night', 'club', 'sleep', 'day', 'now', 'are', 'others', 'space', ""n't"", 'happy', 'new', 'arrangement', 'all.April', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'anyone', 'not', 'bad', 'person', 'unhappy', 'person', 'dissatisfied', 'life', 'still', 'burdened', 'things', 'happened', 'past', 'wall', 'up', 'determined', 'not', 'let', 'anybody', ""n't"", 'even', 'when', 'others', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'be', 'praying', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'angry', 'God', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'deserved', 'love', 'was', 'glad', 'when', 'realized', 'church', 'was', 'place', 'go', 'so', 'could', 'begin', 'find', 'peace', 'opposite', 'sex', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'man', 'really', 'cared', 'Sandino.Sandino', 'Adam', 'Rodriguez', 'man', 'good', 'heart', 'Bad', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'past', 'April', ""n't"", 'holding', 'experiences', 'least', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'out', 'others', 'particularly', 'children', 'what', 'went', 'very', 'likeable', 'character', 'lots', 'good', 'attributes.Sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Jennifer', 'Hope', 'Olaide', 'Wilson', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'anyone', 'nobody', 'ever', 'gave', 'reason', 'trust', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'anyone', 'being', 'kind', 'wanted', 'something', 'return', 'was', 'sad', 'had', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'girl', 'age', 'too', 'many', 'responsibilities', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'memories', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'older', 'sister', 'brothers', 'Byron', 'Manny', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'young', 'lives', 'was', 'angry', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'guard', 'was', 'understandable', 'was', 'also', 'afraid', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'m"", 'gon', 'make', 'was', 'really', 'heartbreaking', 'hear', 'young', 'girl', 'speak', 'words', 'felt', 'so', 'bad', 'her.I', 'own', 'only', 'few', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'plays', 'DVD', 'watch', 'television', 'shows', 'occasion', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'movies', 'own', 'one', 'DVD', 'are', 'movies', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'Christian', 'theme', 'however', 'very', 'strong', 'film', 'was', 'glad', 'church', 'scene', 'had', 'saying', 'Amen', 'Also', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'Madea', 'can', 'be', 'wild', 'woman', 'also', 'woman', 'wisdom', 'telling', 'Bible', 'stories', 'What', 'Madea', 'said', 'Jennifer', 'kitchen', 'table', 'was', 'something', 'young', 'girl', 'needed', 'hear', 'really', 'liked', 'scene.I', 'Can', 'Do', 'Bad', 'All', 'Myself', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'love', 'listen', 'Mary', 'J', 'Blige', 'sing', 'uplifting', 'song', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Gladys', 'Knight', 'hear', 'sing', 'Marvin', 'Winans', 'songs', 'Just', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Wan', 'Know', 'Now/Oh', 'Lord', 'Want', 'Help', 'Me', 'so', 'inspirational', 'healing', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'soundtrack.Good', 'acting', 'good', 'singing', 'good', 'messages', 'One', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'best']",N/A

This is how the story goes: When Madea, America's favorite pistol-packing grandma, catches sixteen-year-old Jennifer and her two younger brothers looting her home, she decides to take matters into her own hands and delivers the young delinquents to the only relative they have: their aunt April. A heavy-drinking nightclub singer who lives off of Raymond, her married boyfriend, April wants nothing to do with the kids. But her attitude begins to change when Sandino, a handsome Mexican immigrant looking for work, moves into April's basement room. Making amends for his own troubled past, Sandino challenges April to open her heart. And April soon realizes she must make the biggest choice of her life: between her old ways with Raymond and the new possibilities of family, faith... and even true love.The cast led by Taraji P.
