Instead of great sweeping epics this program focuses on a single squad with their trials and tribulation with confronting and some time co-operating with the Germans in WWII. Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs.

829098,A276M3NSIY9B82,B0002A2W2W,Harry Brewer,"[2, 2]","This edition of Combat! has 16 episodes &, once again, they're not in broadcast order but in production order. A minor point but it's not quite the way it was. We no longer have Shecky Greene (Pvt. Braddock) but Jack Hogan (Pvt. Kirby) has become more visible in this set. Season one of Combat! had more fluctuation in the supporting cast & that wouldn't become more solidified until the next season.This set does have one of my favorite episodes, ""The Walking Wounded"". Saunders has received a minor wound that forces him to seek medical attention on his own back at their lines. His wound isn't bad enough to ensure him a ride, hence he's' walking wounded', but he does end up getting a ride on an ambulance. The driver isn't too keen about driving through the combat areas but Saunders takes control. It's a great episode for Vic Morrow. ""Hill 256"" is more drama than action as Pvt. Kirby faces a court martial for cowardice. Jack Hogan gets an opportunity to be the main focus of a script & he proves to be more than adequate as an actor. ""Battle of the Roses"" is one of the oddest episodes of Combat! that has Saunders trying to convince a French woman to leave the sanctity of her garden. ""The Sniper"" is full of some tense moments, the title tells it all. The final episode, ""No Trumpet, No Drums"" was an excellent show for the finale to season one. Caje (Pierre Jalbert) has killed a Frenchman & must deal with the dead man's daughter. Caje is very distraught & becomes distracted from his duty.Like all the Combat! season sets that are a lot of bonus features. Season one has Steven Rogers portraying the medic, Doc. Rogers would only appear in the first season & would be replaced by Conlan Carter thereafter.

Future seasons would see them split the center spotlight with Morrow quickly becoming the dominant character...but other characters, like Little John, are barely fleshed out, and Kirby did not have his patented BAR by his side, though in one episode he petitioned to become the squad's BAR man (Far from the Brave)...Stephen Rogers as Doc #1 could not hold an acting candle to Season 2-5 Doc #2, Conlan Carter...So by all means, pick up this first season because the price is right, and there is much to enjoy....as the seasons progressed, the show just got better, culminating in the 2 part masterpiece, ""Hills are for Heroes"" from season 4....If I could rate the individual season now they would be:Season 1 -  3 1/2 StarsSeason 2 -  5 StarsSeason 3 -  5 StarsSeason 4 -  5 Stars...though could be a 6 Star SeasonSeason 5 -  4 StarsI'm jumping a bit ahead of the release schedule with these ratings but you have an idea on how I view the arc of the series.Recommended with some reservations....",4,Great Series Has First Season Jitters,1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,3650,"['easy', 'slap', '5', 'stars', 'Combat', 'review', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'careful', 'realize', 'series', 'was', '5', 'seasons', 'long', '150', 'total', 'episodes', 'fact', 'could', 'give', 'first', 'season', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'would', '.the', 'show', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'bearings', 'first', 'season', 'would', 'face', 'many', 'bumps', 'directors', 'writers', 'came', 'went', '.these', 'are', 'valuable', 'episodes', 'setting', 'up', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'covered', 'WWII', 'theater', '.Some', 'Highlights', 'Lost', 'Sheep', 'Lost', 'Shepherd', '.Jeffery', 'Hunter', 'guest', 'star', 'priest', 'who', 'fell', 'grace', 'now', 'tanker', 'when', 'up', 'church', 'steeple', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'role', 'King', 'Kings.Forgotten', 'Front', 'guest', 'star', 'Albert', 'Paulsen', 'who', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'German', 'who', 'captured', 'Saunders', 'writers', 'had', 'add', 'final', 'scene', 'Caje', 'Saunders', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'final', 'outcome', 'Paulsen', 'character', 'Cat', 'Mouse', 'very', 'exciting', 'tense', 'story', 'Albert', 'Salmi', 'Seargent', 'equal', 'Saunders', 'grit', 'determination.Reunion', 'one', 'do', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'long', 'lost', 'father', 'collaborator', 'Germans', 'Medal', '.Frank', 'Gorshin', 'reluctantly', 'then', 'aggressively', 'credit', 'heroic', 'act', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'Time', 'Pity', '.one', 'many', 'episodes', 'war', 'effect', 'children', 'Sniper', '.German', 'sniper', 'US', 'soldiers', 'French', 'town.No', 'Drums', 'Caje', 'suffers', 'period', 'angst', 'killing', 'little', 'girl', 'father', '.These', 'epsisodes', 'others', 'are', 'high', 'points', 'first', 'season', 'characters', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'fully', 'evolved', 'are', 'episodes', 'are', 'secondary', 'times', 'rather', 'mundane', 'characters', 'Second', 'Now', '.Hanley', 'caught', 'rubble', 'church', 'unexploded', 'bomb', 'company', 'rather', 'boring', 'subplot', 'British', 'demo', 'man', 'love', 'interest', 'Missing', 'Action', '.Howard', 'Duff', 'downed', 'pilot', 'again', 'center', 'stage', 'romantic', 'plot', 'lineThe', 'Chateau', 'Doc', '1', 'given', 'star', 'treatment', 'episode..the', 'problem', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'actorThe', 'Prisoner', '.Shecky', 'Greene', 'comedic', 'talents', 'are', 'display', 'episode', 'too', 'Heroes-ish', 'be', 'good', 'Walking', 'Wounded', 'time', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'Gary', 'Merrill..Off', 'Limits', '.William', 'Windom', 'Peggy', 'Ann', 'Garner', 'are', 'lovers', 'guess', 'what', 'Garner', 'married', 'one', 'Saunders', 'men', 'yawnWell', 'could', 'go', 'will', 'spare', '.One', 'niceties', 'first', 'season', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'Rick', 'Jason', 'worked', 'together', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', 'Future', 'seasons', 'would', 'see', 'split', 'center', 'spotlight', 'Morrow', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'dominant', 'character', 'other', 'characters', 'Little', 'John', 'are', 'barely', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Kirby', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'patented', 'BAR', 'side', 'one', 'episode', 'petitioned', 'become', 'squad', 'BAR', 'man', 'Far', 'Brave', 'Stephen', 'Rogers', 'Doc', '1', 'could', 'not', 'hold', 'acting', 'candle', 'Season', '2-5', 'Doc', '2', 'Conlan', 'Carter', 'So', 'means', 'pick', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'price', 'right', 'much', 'enjoy', 'seasons', 'progressed', 'show', 'just', 'got', 'better', 'culminating', '2', 'part', 'masterpiece', 'Hills', 'are', 'Heroes', 'season', '4', '.If', 'could', 'rate', 'individual', 'season', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'Season', '1', '3', '1/2', 'StarsSeason', '2', '5', 'StarsSeason', '3', '5', 'StarsSeason', '4', '5', 'Stars', 'though', 'could', 'be', '6', 'Star', 'SeasonSeason', '5', '4', 'StarsI', ""'m"", 'jumping', 'bit', 'ahead', 'release', 'schedule', 'ratings', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'view', 'arc', 'series.Recommended', 'reservations']","Combat - Season 1, Campaign 2"

My question is: Why did Image Entertainment allow this to happen? They didn't do this with I SPY, NAKED CITY, or DICK VAN DYKE. I understand that Image is just a distributor, but they should have DEMANDED that the masters used for these dvd sets be UNEDITED. ""Time Compressed"" is when they digitally edit out several minutes of a program so that they have more time for commercials. What's left after the editing is then digitally ""compressed"" together. These episodes should run approximately 50 minutes, but on these edited dvd's they run about 46 minutes. That means there's over 50 minutes of missing footage in this set!! In the old days, the rule was 5 minutes of commercials for every half-hour of programming (25 min. of show + 5 min. of commercials). Tell-tale signs of a time compressed show are:The action moves a little faster (moving vehicles will sometimes skip instead of rolling smoothly)The actors voices are higher pitchedThe music is ""choppy"" (try singing while lightly karate chopping your throat--this is what it sounds like to me)To me, a time compressed show is very annoying.

829105,A3875KWK1PXG7I,B0002A2W2W,Robert Huggins,"[18, 20]","Even though Combat! has aired on some cable stations and has been syndicated on broadcast television in a few markets, I had not seen the series since original broadcasts on ABC ended in 1967.  So it was with great anticipation that I awaited the release of the series on DVD.  The wait was worth it . . . Combat! is even better than I had remembered it to be.  Like many youngsters who grew up in the 1950s/1960s, I was drawn to the show by its combat action sequences and now, as an adult, the human drama is of greater interest.  The writing and acting in this series is top notch and I found the production values to be quite high for a television series from the early/mid 1960s.  Yes, those French villages were really on the back lot of MGM Studios, but they sure looked authentic.  And, although the final season of the series was filmed in color, the black and white film stock used for the first four seasons actually adds to the grittiness of the show.Season 1, Campaign 2 contains 16 episodes and, like Season 1, Campaign 1, the episodes are shown in production order rather than the original broadcast order.  Shecky Greene's Private Braddock is gone but Jack Hogan's better-known Private Kirby shows up in these episodes.  The extras on Campaign 2 consist of six episode commentaries, and some anecdotal information on each episode provided by Jo Davidsmeyer who runs the Combat! web site.  The commentaries are of variable quality.  For example, actor Joseph Campanella, a guest star on the episode ""The Medal,"" is a somewhat strange choice to provide commentary since his character is killed off during the first quarter of the episode.  Campanella is affectionate when speaking about the show and his role, but he signs off abruptly, around the 25 minute mark of the episode.  Perhaps, with the passage of over 40 years, he simply had run out of things to say.  That's not the case with the other commentaries, however, the best of which come from Director Richard Donner (""No Trumpets, No Drums"") and actors Ben Cooper and Tom Lowell (""Next in Command"").

Like many I saw it when i was a kid, but i don't recall many details of it.  Seeing it years later I am surprsied by the depth of characters and plot with some of the shows.  The series takes pains to show the human cost and strain of tactical level combat.  In contrast the actual battle sequences, while exciting, are not very realistic.  The Germans are killed off like Keystone Cops, all looking the same and doing the smae stupid things to get killed.In reality the combat expereince and proficiency of the German squad often far surpassed its Green US counter-part.  Of course what Americans lacked in expereince they often more than made up  with firepower.  This was the saving grace of the US army, its overwhelming firepower.  Of course the show only shows us one little squad of GIs, and it always looks like they are up against the whole German army!  Often this was the other way around, and it was the skill and determination of small German units that held huge, bulky US Forces at bay.  Patton did great when he had gas and was up against rear echelon stuff.  Of course this series was made in more patriotic times, and so the Germans have to look more stupid than they really were. Sometimes there are surprising looks at the Germans as human beings as well!Vic Morrow of course makes this show.  Without him I doubt it could have lasted as long as it did.  Tanks and equippment are often inaccurate, but the look and feel is still good for the most part.  The best part of this series is often the human interest and character development, away from the shoot-em up combat scenes.  This squad also assumes many roles as commandos too, with guys creeping around slitting German throats with knifes and such.  How come the Germans never get to do this kind of stuff?Even with its obvious faults, Combat is still worthwhile to see again after many years.  The series does grow on you and pull you into the various characters of the squad.  Try to forget the often hollywood battle scenes and enjoy just the good acting and background atmosphere of this show.",4,Debut of the GI Super Squad,1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,2107,"['nice', 'see', 'show', 'again', 'many', 'saw', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'kid', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'many', 'details', 'Seeing', 'years', 'later', 'am', 'surprsied', 'depth', 'characters', 'plot', 'shows', 'series', 'pains', 'show', 'human', 'cost', 'strain', 'tactical', 'level', 'combat', 'contrast', 'actual', 'battle', 'sequences', 'exciting', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'realistic', 'Germans', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'Keystone', 'Cops', 'looking', 'same', 'doing', 'smae', 'stupid', 'things', 'get', 'killed.In', 'reality', 'combat', 'expereince', 'proficiency', 'German', 'squad', 'often', 'far', 'surpassed', 'Green', 'US', 'counter-part', 'course', 'what', 'Americans', 'lacked', 'expereince', 'often', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'firepower', 'was', 'saving', 'grace', 'US', 'army', 'overwhelming', 'firepower', 'course', 'show', 'only', 'one', 'little', 'squad', 'GIs', 'always', 'are', 'up', 'whole', 'German', 'army', 'Often', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'was', 'skill', 'determination', 'small', 'German', 'units', 'held', 'huge', 'bulky', 'US', 'Forces', 'bay', 'Patton', 'did', 'great', 'when', 'had', 'gas', 'was', 'up', 'rear', 'echelon', 'stuff', 'course', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'more', 'patriotic', 'times', 'so', 'Germans', 'have', 'look', 'more', 'stupid', 'really', 'were', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'surprising', 'looks', 'Germans', 'human', 'beings', 'well', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'course', 'show', 'doubt', 'could', 'have', 'lasted', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'Tanks', 'equippment', 'are', 'often', 'inaccurate', 'look', 'feel', 'still', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'often', 'human', 'interest', 'character', 'development', 'away', 'shoot-em', 'up', 'combat', 'scenes', 'squad', 'also', 'many', 'roles', 'commandos', 'too', 'guys', 'creeping', 'around', 'slitting', 'German', 'throats', 'knifes', 'such', 'How', 'come', 'Germans', 'never', 'get', 'do', 'kind', 'stuff', 'Even', 'obvious', 'faults', 'Combat', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'see', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'series', 'grow', 'pull', 'various', 'characters', 'squad', 'Try', 'forget', 'often', 'hollywood', 'battle', 'scenes', 'enjoy', 'just', 'good', 'acting', 'background', 'atmosphere', 'show']","Combat - Season 1, Campaign 2"
