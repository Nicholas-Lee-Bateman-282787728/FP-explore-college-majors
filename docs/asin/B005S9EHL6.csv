1498225,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005S9EHL6,A kids review,"[3, 8]","Tom Six apparently wasn't joking when he sub-titled the first Human Centipede film ""First Sequence,"" because here it is just two years later, and we've got the inevitable sequel on our hands. The first film -- something of an instant cult favorite, even if it made pennies at the box office -- seemed to have fully explored its central premise, so what could Six do to up the ante? This time around, he goes with the meta commentary, focusing on a disturbed, overweight parking garage attendant named Martin Lomax who's obsessed with the first Human Centipede film. Eventually, Martin decides to recreate the experiment therein portrayed, and what ensues is a brutal, graphic depiction of his efforts. The Human Centipede II: Full Sequence is so over the top that I simply got tired of it and felt the weak attempt at social commentary was undone by its own boundary-pushing. Nevertheless, the improvement in technical skill over the first film at least holds some merit.",1,The Human Centipede II: Full Sequence,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,971,"['Tom', 'Six', 'apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'joking', 'when', 'sub-titled', 'first', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'film', 'First', 'Sequence', 'here', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'later', ""'ve"", 'got', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'hands', 'first', 'film', 'something', 'instant', 'cult', 'favorite', 'even', 'made', 'pennies', 'box', 'office', 'seemed', 'have', 'fully', 'explored', 'central', 'premise', 'what', 'could', 'Six', 'do', 'up', 'ante', 'time', 'around', 'meta', 'commentary', 'focusing', 'disturbed', 'overweight', 'parking', 'garage', 'attendant', 'named', 'Martin', 'Lomax', 'who', 'obsessed', 'first', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'film', 'Eventually', 'Martin', 'recreate', 'experiment', 'therein', 'portrayed', 'what', 'brutal', 'graphic', 'depiction', 'efforts', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'II', 'Full', 'Sequence', 'so', 'top', 'simply', 'got', 'tired', 'felt', 'weak', 'attempt', 'social', 'commentary', 'was', 'undone', 'own', 'boundary-pushing', 'Nevertheless', 'improvement', 'technical', 'skill', 'first', 'film', 'least', 'merit']",The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence

Thomas""","[0, 1]","This film is about the inhumanity of an abused child, who has grown into a man, who is insane and uses a crowbar to inflict brain damage in his victims.  The plot is how the insane man ties his victims together with duct tape before killing them.  Before watching this movie, I thought that the worst horror film was &#34;The Human Centipede&#34; produced by the same Tom Six.  I regret that I watched it, as by doing so, I have given him an audience of one and thereby helped him make a profit on such a sick creation.  I reget to learn from Imdb that the film was initially denied a rating by the British film board but they reversed their decision after the producer removed twelve scenes from the movie.  Given the awful depictions that the board allowed to be shown to the public, I do not want to know what ended up on the cutting room floor.  It was said, &#34;The actor, who played the main character was asked to &#34;rape a chair,&#34; during his audition, which he reportedly demonstrated for the Director!

1498228,AV30RYVPJJJ34,B005S9EHL6,Alexander Stephen Brown,"[6, 14]","As a fan of the first Human Centipede, I felt that Tom Six overstepped his boundary regarding pt 2. I can understand his reasoning for this film as he promised to shock audiences with the first Human Centipede, and what he did was divide the horror crowd. 1. People appreciated its originality 2. People decided that it was a waste of time and that the movie was nothing more than three people crawling around.Personally, I believe pt 1 stood as a strong, in depth horror movie that was extremely tastefully done as the audience was left with the less is more scenario.  Being a horror author, I have to sympathize for Mr. Six as he had produced work that was a punch to the stomach and quite a few people said the work was nothing more than people crawling around, these people completely missed the art and depth that he and his actresses and actors created.  I tend to think that pt 2 was created because he wanted to shock the portion of the audience that missed the independence and originality of pt 1.  To this thought, I have to say he went overboard.The first hour and fifteen minutes, is shocking but it's no worse than pt 1 or any other horror movie for that matter, and in my opinion is beautifully crafted with amazing angles and black and white detail, making this installment seem like a rendition of Eraserhead, however, the one star rating regards the last fifteen minutes of the film.Practically, I tolerated everything and appreciated the movie until the barbed wire rape scene.  This scene was graphic beyond belief and by the time it is over the viewer is left sickened and numbed only to be sucker punched again with a mother stomping the head of her new born baby in order to escape the maniac. I am all for freedom of speech and expression but there are just some things that could be done tastefully vs. unrelenting violence for violence sake.The idea was great and very original for pt 2 as it dives into the thought of what would happen if a maniac in our tangible world created reenactments in regards to the movies they watch.  The idea isn't farfetched and it has been done previous in books and movies, however, this is the first time that I can recall where we, as the viewer, have the opportunity to watch the movie that inspired Martin to create his own centipede.  For this I have to congratulate Tom Six for having the ability to use his first movie as something that is nothing more than the prologue for the main meat of what pt 2 represents.Despite the praise I just gave, I can not give this movie a good rating as the brutality of the rape and baby stomp made me feel like a poor excuse as a human being.  On a closing note I must say, that pt 2 is nothing like pt 1, of course it has the same idea of people being attached from mouth to anus, but everything is portrayed more graphically, violently, explicitly, and sexually.  I warn you, that if you do see this movie, you can not unsee what you have already seen.  This is coming from a person who has enjoyed the originals of Last House on the Left, I Spit on Your Grave, and cult classics like Eraserhead, Faces of Death 1-4, Salo, Cannibal Holocaust, and more upon that theme. With consideration that I have watched and enjoyed the above movies, this is the first movie that I didn't like because it crossed boundaries that even I have a limit to.",1,In Depth Reasoning for A 1 Star Rating,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,3344,"['fan', 'first', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'felt', 'Tom', 'Six', 'overstepped', 'boundary', 'regarding', 'pt', '2', 'can', 'understand', 'reasoning', 'film', 'promised', 'shock', 'audiences', 'first', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'divide', 'horror', 'crowd', '1', 'People', 'appreciated', 'originality', '2', 'People', 'decided', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'three', 'people', 'crawling', 'around.Personally', 'believe', 'pt', '1', 'stood', 'strong', 'depth', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'tastefully', 'done', 'audience', 'was', 'left', 'less', 'more', 'scenario', 'Being', 'horror', 'author', 'have', 'sympathize', 'Mr.', 'Six', 'had', 'produced', 'work', 'was', 'punch', 'stomach', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'said', 'work', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'people', 'crawling', 'around', 'people', 'completely', 'missed', 'art', 'depth', 'actresses', 'actors', 'created', 'tend', 'think', 'pt', '2', 'was', 'created', 'wanted', 'shock', 'portion', 'audience', 'missed', 'independence', 'originality', 'pt', '1', 'thought', 'have', 'say', 'went', 'first', 'hour', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'shocking', 'worse', 'pt', '1', 'other', 'horror', 'movie', 'matter', 'opinion', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'amazing', 'angles', 'black', 'white', 'detail', 'making', 'installment', 'seem', 'rendition', 'Eraserhead', 'however', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film.Practically', 'tolerated', 'everything', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'barbed', 'wire', 'rape', 'scene', 'scene', 'was', 'graphic', 'belief', 'time', 'viewer', 'left', 'sickened', 'numbed', 'only', 'be', 'sucker', 'punched', 'again', 'mother', 'stomping', 'head', 'new', 'born', 'baby', 'order', 'escape', 'maniac', 'am', 'freedom', 'speech', 'expression', 'are', 'just', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'tastefully', 'vs.', 'unrelenting', 'violence', 'violence', 'sake.The', 'idea', 'was', 'great', 'very', 'original', 'pt', '2', 'thought', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'maniac', 'tangible', 'world', 'created', 'reenactments', 'regards', 'movies', 'watch', 'idea', ""n't"", 'farfetched', 'been', 'done', 'previous', 'books', 'movies', 'however', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'recall', 'where', 'viewer', 'have', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'movie', 'inspired', 'Martin', 'create', 'own', 'centipede', 'have', 'congratulate', 'Tom', 'Six', 'having', 'ability', 'use', 'first', 'movie', 'something', 'nothing', 'more', 'prologue', 'main', 'meat', 'what', 'pt', '2', 'represents.Despite', 'praise', 'just', 'gave', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'movie', 'good', 'rating', 'brutality', 'rape', 'baby', 'stomp', 'made', 'feel', 'poor', 'excuse', 'human', 'being', 'closing', 'note', 'must', 'say', 'pt', '2', 'nothing', 'pt', '1', 'course', 'same', 'idea', 'people', 'being', 'attached', 'mouth', 'anus', 'everything', 'portrayed', 'more', 'graphically', 'violently', 'explicitly', 'sexually', 'warn', 'do', 'see', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'unsee', 'what', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'coming', 'person', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'originals', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'cult', 'classics', 'Eraserhead', 'Faces', 'Death', '1-4', 'Salo', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'more', 'theme', 'consideration', 'have', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'above', 'movies', 'first', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'crossed', 'boundaries', 'even', 'have', 'limit']",The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence

The villian in this one is the polar opposite of the good doctor in the first.  Choosing the complete opposite was an interesting idea but I didn't care much for Martin's character.  All Martin did was make noises (Martin doesn't speak in the movie) which get somewhat annoying considering they happen when he is trying to motivate a bowel movement from the centipede.  Also, if Martin was trying to copy the good doctor from the first flick...why does he wear baggy tighty whites with his lab coat open??  Since he is trying to immitate I would think he would be a bit cleaner in his appearance and surgical/medical environment.  The other thing I didn't care for is it was somewhat choppy.  It showed Martin beaning a woman with a crowbar then all of a sudden she is bound and gagged in a warehouse.  It never shows Martin moving the bodies which I would have liked to see especially in the heavy rain with a bad asthma condition and his stunted growth.The other thing that stuck out was the police were never notified?  People were missing from a certain area and not one showing of the police just seems odd since the victims had friends, families or clients.  The police didn't even show up when people went missing from the apartment building.  Just seems odd since they appeared in the first one and nothing here.I don't want to ruin it but it also never showed what happened to one of the victims or a child that appeared.There were only a few things about the movie I did enjoy.  One was the appearance of the actress from the first film and how it was shown as a film.  The other was that it was filmed in black and white (except the feces splattering on the screen...they did use brown for the poo) which gave it a seedy appearance.  It fit with the delapitated warehouse and Martin's perversions.  The reason for the black and white was to tone down the gore which was actually nice.  One can only watch so much poo being exerted from one anus into another's mouth.  After a while it gets old and the shock value wears off.All in all it was OK, I watched it thinking I would enjoy it as much as the first but it just didn't seem as effective as the first.

The main character is disgusting and without any redeeming values, he's a creep that you cannot relate to. THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 is not scary by any means, it is just repulsive and sick. It doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't.If you are into movies like this, HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 will not disappoint. Cruel and heartless we follow Martin, who is obsessed with the movie HUMAN CENTIPEDE (LOL) and wants to create one himself - only LARGER, so he knocks his victims unconscious with a tire iron and keeps them in a warehouse.This movie contains similar disgusting scenes as in part 1 (people being stapled together mouth to anus, and when they got to go, well, they gotta go), but this time we also get a scene of self mutilation of genitals, a barbed wire rape scene. THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 is entirely in black and white but it doesn't make it any less extreme (it was banned outright in Australia and New Zealand and heavily cut in Japan and England after originally being banned there as well. Originally it was supposed to be censored in the US as well, but thankfully the distributor IFC had a change of heart - the unrated version is totally uncut).THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 is a lot more disturbing than part 1, so beware.I'm giving it 5 stars because it delivers what it promises: sick, shocking and disgusting ""entertainment"" - those who are into these kind of movies will appreciate it, those of you who aren't will hate it. It is nowhere near as disturbing as A SERBIAN FILM, though.

The first HUMAN CENTIPEDE was only mildly acceptable thanks to the absurdist humor that came out of Dr. Heiter's character. That humor is now far removed from this second film, along with every last shred of decency. THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 is even more sick and depraved than the original, with few redeeming qualities outside of the shock and gore. Martin is a disgusting human specimen on his own, let alone his plans in creating a new 'pet.' Laurence R. Harvey's screeching, bug-eyed dwarf instantly puts audiences on edge with his unnerving appearance and disreputable acts. Martin's methods lack the clinical precision of Dr. Heiter; they are crude and ineffectual, using blunted knives and a staple gun to perform his 'surgery.' The bloody results become unbearable to watch, as tendons are torn free and his twelve victims are left writhing in one big, long chain of human perversion. If anything can be said for director Tom Six, it is that he knows exactly which buttons to press in order to maximize the horrified response in his viewers.

1498247,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005S9EHL6,C. Sawin,"[11, 16]","*THIS DOES CONTAIN HEAVY SPOILERS*The Human Centipede was fairly underwhelming. It wasn't terrible and it wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't this monstrously absurd and gory movie you may have expected from the concept and promotional materials. The concept itself was probably the most disturbing and interesting aspect of the movie. Imagining yourself in that situation was more horrific than anything that made it on-screen. It didn't even feel like people had enough time to fully process the first film before writer/director Tom Six began hyping the second film in a proposed trilogy. The sequel was then banned in the UK (before the ban was lifted recently) and censored in the US, which probably only piqued curiosity even further. Tom Six has gone on record as saying The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) will make the original seem like ""My Little Pony"" in comparison, which is probably true due to its graphic nature. Unfortunately the sequel has little else to offer.So before I go into too much detail, the screener I saw was apparently an edited version of the film. Maybe that means this is the one that will be distributed theatrically in the US, but I do know that the barbed wire bit didn't make it into the film and the ending was slightly altered.We're introduced to Martin (Laurence R. Harvey), a security guard who has a rabid obsession with the original Human Centipede film. He does nothing but watch the movie over and over again and even has a scrapbook devoted to it along with re-drawn diagrams from the movie to pull off the centipede. Martin isn't normal; he was sexually abused as a child, likes mutilating himself, and still lives with his mother. While on the job, he kidnaps people, ties them up, and stores them in an abandoned storage unit with the hopes of making his passion a reality; a twelve person human centipede.The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is entirely black and white. It does make the film stand out in comparison to its predecessor, but it also changes the appearance of gore rather dramatically. Tom Six defended this film after being banned in the UK by calling it ""make believe"" and called it ""art."" The black and white aspect of the film certainly makes it feel more artistic, but that term will probably come into question after you witness some of the things that take place on screen. Martin is very off-putting. He's extremely overweight, greasy all the time, and just really creepy overall. He has this Jonah Hill meets Wayne Knight at their worst type of look to him. Every close up, every action, every time he licks his fingers, basically everything Martin does grosses you out. Martin also never speaks throughout the movie. He wheezes, cries, and throws tantrums, so he's not completely silent. But those of you expecting another Dr. Heiter will be sorely disappointed.It's not like this version of the film didn't completely shy away from gruesomeness though. There's still plenty in here to get offended over or get excited about. The sandpaper bit did make it in there, but I have a feeling it was edited as well. The pregnant woman in the car scene is pretty revolting. I had to rewind it and watch it again to make sure I saw it right. We see Martin dismantle about half a dozen kneecaps by cutting open the sides and snipping their tendons, Martin takes a hammer and knocks out every tooth in a man's mouth before fishing them out, and that same man rips his stapled lips off another man's anus. Those are just a few examples.Martin's mother was unintentionally hilarious. She mostly just seems bitter and old when the movie first starts, but her bad acting eventually makes itself known. She also has a scene with Martin at the dinner table which leads to their second encounter with their upstairs neighbor that is probably the best scene in the sequel even though it only lasts a few seconds and is kind of ridiculous. The twelve person centipede gets really disgusting though. Once Martin gives everyone a laxative shot, then you can probably see where that is going to lead and it gets all over the camera multiple times. The ending is pretty weak, too. Did you ever play Super Mario Bros 2? Well that's pretty much the ending you get here. Online reports say that there's actually more to the ending featuring more footage, but the version I saw was literally credits of the movie, Martin sitting in the camera room at work, Martin licking his fingers, an outside shot where we see Martin through a window, end film. There may have been a baby crying the background, I don't recall. But with that version of the ending, it's difficult to argue that it all wasn't just a dream.I'm not going to tell you to not see The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence). If you enjoyed the first film or if your interest has heightened due to its hype, then curiosity will cause you to see this in some way or another. Hell, I'd at least like to know what was cut and I'd probably watch it again if I knew it was unrated, the director's cut, an alternate version, etc. But the sequel is a bit disappointing. Sure, the blood and graphic content of the sequel is increased tenfold but Martin isn't nearly as captivating as Dr. Heiter and everything just feels like it's for nothing by the time the ending rolls around. The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) just leaves you with bloody discharge on your face without much of anything to show for it. Demented, disgusting, and rather pointless, The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is more than likely the extremely nauseating film you expected the first film to be.",2,"Sickening, repulsive, and

1498248,A1MSR3UGBI30NB,B005S9EHL6,"D. Davison ""arcticfrog""","[19, 27]","I usually don't rate movies at all that I would rate one star (not even that much if I could in this case). They don't deserve the attention. But this one did for the following reason. I read that part of the director's inspiration for the film was Pasolini's movie ""Salo, 120 days of Sodom"". The only thing that shocks more than the film is that anyone could think that this `product' has any artistic merit or is in any way comparable to Pasolini's work.There is no artistic merit in either Centipede film. It has no value as any kind of social commentary whatsoever. It is pure and simple torture, and the emphasizing of the helplessness of the victims. The connection between the suffering individuals is not a glimpse of humanity, it just emphasizes the helplessness in order to magnify the suffering. I'm sure someone out there will try to call it art, but remember the guy who defecated in a jar and put it up as an art exhibit? Remember Piss Christ? These are things people do because creating real art is hard work, and they've no idea how to create art. A film like this is an indication of the sterility and lack of ideas in the culture we've created.The doctor in the first Centipede was obviously a sociopath. The man in this film is probably sociopathic and psychotic. The ""I've been bullied so I'm going to make you suffer"" motif doesn't lend anything to the film at all. I'm not recommending ""I Spit on Your Grave"", but at least the character development lent some believability to the revenge-torture in that film. But what also strikes the audience in that film is the emptiness of the revenge. You don't even get those feelings here. It's like fishing people off the street and ripping them to shreds. All it has going is the shock value. Once it wears off, you wish you hadn't watched this at all. Perhaps the idea of being shocked can be likened to the fact that heightened arousal leads us often to sleep with someone we normally wouldn't touch, and getting the feeling after that you'll never be able to wash the taste out of your mouth. We want to be shocked, so we watch it.There's not enough character development for any real connections to be made with the people involved. It's just a pure torture flick that is attempting to make money off of the pure depiction of suffering with a gimmick.

Makes SAW and HOSTEL look like teenage  comedy movies"" - ***Doum666***I've been wanting to see this film for a long time. The first sequence was definitely a worldwide horror classic and manage to do the ""Shocking and disturbing""  job very well.  When the first sequence came out, there was a lot of arguing about the film; is it garbage or is it art? I remember having to defend and explain my point several times, not only here on Amazon but with friends and co-workers as well. You see, for a lot of people, the line can be very thin between what is art and what is garbage, or what is acceptable and what is not. Again people, this is a horror film meant to shock, not a Disney release...This second installment goes even further with Martin, a short, obese, asthmatic and mentally ill freak who's obsessed with ""The Human Centipede"" (1st film) and tries to do like the real doctor in the first film (Dr Josef Heiter) and create a  centipede on his own. A 12 people centipede. The only problem is that poor Martin doesn't have any Medical knowledge and relies on the first film's instructions by Dr Josef Heiter to make is own....Being mentally ill, incontinent, emotionally unstable, seriously retarded and without any medical knowledge, Martin will struggle to try and make is 12 pieces centipede.....In response to the controversy surrounding the ""100% Medically Accurate"" statement on the first film cover, this 2nd movie cover shows ""100% medically Inaccurate"" and i think people will find out why. The film did have some classification refusal issues and almost got banned from UK and Australia due to the film being ""too extreme, sexually violent and potentially obscene"". A modified version of the film including several cuts was submitted and finally accepted for both countries. The movie was also the first film since THE EXORCIST (1979), ZOMBIE (by fulci)(1979) and ANGUISH (1985) to be shown in theatres with medical personal and barf bags....The cinematography is also excellent despite the lack of color. The film was indeed shot in color but was later turned to black and white. The result was a near perfect blend of ""black and white"" with an almost imperceptible tint of green (unless this is only my TV settings...). Very effective camera shots and angles.I think director Tom Six wanted to push this one as far as possible...Everything you can imagine actually happens...I was very shocked and surprised on several scenes myself!

1498259,A3JUMMIGJ7B38X,B005S9EHL6,GarionOrb,"[6, 10]","The Human Centipede (First Sequence) was an extremely disturbing movie.  Its [questionable] premise of being ""100% medically accurate"" made the movie all the more terrifying.  Whether or not that accuracy claim was true, the movie was presented in a way that made it SEEM possible, and that's why the first Human Centipede worked so well.  In The Human Centipede 2, director Tom Six just wanted to make a gorier version of the first film.  The end result is, in my opinion, not quite as effective.The premise of this second film is actually pretty good.  A mentally ill outcast is a huge fan of the first film and it inspires him to create his own human centipede.  So for the first hour or so the film chronicles his life with is overbearing mother and the gathering of all his victims for the construction of said centipede.  The film's climax involves this man actually building the centipede, and that's when it's no holds barred for the director.  We get to see, very graphically, the removal of teeth, the severing of the kneecap tendons and the general mutilation of the human body.  However, it's shown so explicitly that after a while it's just cheesy.  Moreover, the first film only had three victims, two of which were given a bit of background before the horror started.  In this film, there are 12 people in this centipede.  The only ones you really get to ""know"" are pretty horrible people in the first place.  The rest only get a minute or two of exposition before they're rounded up, so you essentially have zero investment in the people being victimized.  So when you put it all together, it's just gore for the sake of gore.Kudos, however, to Tom Six for trying really hard to shock us.  The film is rather expertly presented in black and white, giving it the look of a kind of snuff film.  This mechanic really works here, and I couldn't possibly imagine this film being shown in full color (actually, brown is the only color shown...if you've seen the first film you can imagine what it's used for).  The antagonist, Martin, is played immaculately by the actor.  He is chilling, disturbed and incredibly creepy.  The victims do their job well, and having Ashlynn Yennie, who played the center segment of the centipede in the first film, is a bit amusing playing herself here.  In my opinion, the film was well-casted and everyone was giving it their all.Is this a good movie?  I'd say yes.  If you saw and liked the first film, then I definitely recommend this second one.  Just don't expect to feel the same desperation and suspense you got from part one.  Do expect to be shocked and awestruck in horror at the visuals during the 10-15 minutes of ""centipede construction"".

This movie is without a doubt as bad as it gets! But that is the reason it is so great for a horror film.  If you are reading this you must enjoy disgusting movies. I must say the HC 2 went to the top of the list for the sickest, gross, vile movie out there now! There is a strong similarity to David Lynch's EraserHead as it is fimled in black and white. The relationship between Martin and his mother is so pathetic and hopeless.  Martin is the sick man who creates the human centipede. His entire life is just so dark and gloomy the dread is so believable.The menu of gross out scenes include several crowbar beatings, shootings, tooth removal by hammer, staplegun mayhem, tongue removal, throat slashings, rape by barbwire, fetus stomping!!

I can say however, I personally find that the decision to film in B & W totally works against this film as since I knew what I was going into from the get go I would much rather have seen the proceedings in color. Let's get this out of the way also...I'm not a psycho, degenerate, and I certainly don't need the powers that be flagging me for a film I choose to view...Ha, Ha, come on now, Look at what's happening around you in this world and tell me that those who choose to view a certain type of film (YES, there ARE exceptions that we won't get into) need's big brother interference...please, will I still have my choice of slurpee flavor at the concession stand in the next year or so? Yes, there's certainly a fair share of naughty business that splashes on the screen through out, but there's many more out there that are way more graphic. Again, if this had been released in color, we'd be viewing a film with 10x the impact that you get as it is. Essentially, as with anything you do, know what you're getting into before you take the plunge. I highly doubt anyone would accidentally find themselves watching this film and then proceed to continue watching it for the next hour and then follow up the experience with a scathing review. I, personally, would have rated it higher but I hated the B & W concept and being that I'm a huge fan of the horror film genre I know what I'm getting into before I viewed this or ANY other film. That way, there's no surprises for anyone. Yes, it's not going to EVER be anyones favorite film, and the lead is so scuzzy and overall disgusting you may just get sick of the long repeated viewing of his sweaty nasty self, but it's what this film IS trying to accomplish and it succeeds very well.

1498268,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B005S9EHL6,I'm Right,"[4, 6]","I remember watching this in a little art-house theater in the middle of nowhere with other freaks, all getting together to get as grossed out as possible. Now that was a grindhouse experience that was interesting. So what I'll remember most fondly about this endurance test is the experience moreso than the movie, and I think that's how other people approach this too, to see if they can stomach it.Well the plot is nearly non-existent, right off the bat Martin (a pudgy bug-eyed security attendant) is bludgeoning poor blokes that are in his parking lot after hours with a crowbar and tying them up with duct tape in the back of his hearse. When he's not gathering up people he's either watching the Human Centipede 1 or going home and getting screamed at by his psycho mother. The first half was very reminicent of David Lynch's Eraserhead with all the B&W; weirdness, which pretty much establishes the few necessities for the plot. Basically Martin gets a warehouse big enough for his pet project and gathers random people, that's the first half of the movie summed up.Now the second half is where things get disgusting, unlike the first Human Centipede a surgeon Martin ain't, and he botches a few things while his victims remain tied up and fully aware. Before we really get into things let me explain one aspect of the series that I like so far, this movie is drastically different from the first one. Whereas the first movie was from the victim's point of view and all the disgusting parts were skipped and the whole movie takes place in a sterile setting, the sequel centers around the psychopath, is filmed in black and white, and mostly takes place in a gritty dungeon-esque warehouse. The two 'doctors' from both movies look exceptionally creepy as well, so I'm looking foward (albiet in a sick way) to the third movie, to see how it'll be different from these two vastly contrasting movies.Anywhoo, Martin starts constructing his 12-piece centipede after he gets the star of the first movie in a funny but illogical way, and from there on the Human Centipede 2 becomes exactly what people paid for: an endurance test. In case you're curious about what happens but don't want to actually see it I'll list everything I remember off the top of my head in order (from the uncut version):-people get beat with a crowbar/shot in the legs-Martin masturbates with sandpaper-his mom gets her face bit by a desert centipede then literally gets her face bashed in-Martin's therapist gets his balls shot, then he gets shot in the head-people get their teeth beaten in with a hammer-a man's buttcheeks get sliced open and he bleeds out-Martin uses a rusty scapel to slice people's knee tendons open-Martin staples people's lips to each other's anuses-Martin shoves a tube all the way down the front person's asophagus and injects laxatives into people's butts-Martin rips the front person's tongue out to stop her from screaming-the people start pooping in each other's mouths with messy results (one color is shown here, guess which one?)-Martin ties barbed wire around his penis and rapes the woman in the back (this was really horrifying for me to watch, and I'd say I'm pretty jaded with these kinds of films)-a pregnant woman presumed dead wakes up and runs to the car while giving birth, and stomps her newborn's head in accidently during the frantic escape-while the woman's escaping the centipede splits in half when a man rips his lips out of the other man's anus, you see the man's lips all bloody and feces spewing out of his mouth while the other man's ass is torn open, very nasty stuff-Martin in a rage comes back and excecutes the back centipede, shooting them all in the head, he runs out of bullets for the front half and uses a knife to carve open their throats-the last person alive (the actress from the 1st one) knocks Martin down and shoves his pet centipede down his anus, he retaliates by stabbing her in the throat and walks out of the warehouseAnd that's basically what happens in a nutshell, after all that disgusting chaos Martin's back at his job hearing a baby one of his victim's left behind still crying in the parking lot, was it a dream? If you stop and think about some things it really doesn't make sense, like how didn't the guy who got the duct tape off his mouth not bite other people's duct tape bondage and free them all? How did those people survive with such blunt force truama to the head? How did a short fat schlubby guy manage to kidnap most of these athletic looking young men? Blah blah blah, at the end of the day this movie was made to be as disgusting as possible, people can argue if it's art but hey, it's something different. Tom Six's stated that for the final film there's going to be 500+ people in the centipede. All I can say is Holy S***.Quick Side Note: Roger Ebert's logic makes no sense to me, he says the first movie doesn't really get a rating and just exists in it's own universe (kind of how I feel about rating this movie with stars), while this one got 0 stars and was called 'abhorrent'. They exist in the same universe, the only real difference was that this one was way more disgusting, so I think ol' Ebert was just disgusted and decided to change his opinion about the same concept he rated before, whatever.",2,An Endurance Test,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,5283,"['remember', 'watching', 'little', 'art-house', 'theater', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'other', 'freaks', 'getting',

When Night of the Living Dead came out in 1968 it generated much the same reactions as HC2 for many or the same reasons: Gruesome plot & graphic shots of people being tortured, dismembered & eaten alive.

He watches it time and time again in his security office of a parking garage. He plots, plans and fantasizes making his own human centipede capped off with a star from the first film. This movie is really about him and his obsession before and when he makes the centipede with more people than the first film had. This madman is a heavy giant bellied disgusting man that lives with his mother and the only man who tries to help is a psychologist more interested in molesting him. You get to see into his psyche and why he might be messed up enough to really do this. His mother blames him for everything, the only help he could get seems to molest him and he gets picked on by society due to his weight, height and looks.The disgusting protagonist goes around shooting and beating victims over the head with a giant metal crow bar... and it makes me think they'd be dead from brain hemorrhaging. It is so laughable how people survive things that it made me think a bullet to the head would mean the victim would be alive in the next scene. The villain loads them into his van and whisks them away to his evil warehouse. He keeps them there before making the medical procedure.If you like blood and squeamish moments this is for you, however the squeamish moments really only come toward the time that he makes the centipede. He cuts things, breaks teeth and duct tapes them together with their posterior to the mouth of the next person. I'm shocked enough actors signed up for this job.Overall, the story is a great twist on the original and it is memorable, bloody and gross, but fans of the first might not like it since this is about an obsessed fan.

If you're a Human Centipede fan, though, don't expect a movie about a human centipede and let this sequel take you to a somewhat different land of moral paucity.  I give this a thumbs up for gorehounds.The Human Centipede: First Sequence (2010) really tried to test the limits of what Americans would sit through and claim to enjoy.  It tackled some serious medical curiosities--chief amongst them being what happens when you staple someone's mouth to someone else's business-end?  Can someone survive on a feces-only diet?  And is it medically provable that it sucks the most to be the middle segment of a human centipede?Our sequel begins precisely as the original ends.  Except that in the sequel, the original is the ""actual original movie"" being watched by our new mad scientist.  He is inordinately short, stout, balding, and has rather protruding eyes and cheeks; both child-like and off-putting.  He makes an excellent sociopath.  I won't ruin the surprise, but Ashley Yennie (Jenny from First Sequence) makes a major appearance in this film and the way Martin encounters her is very funny.The First Sequence was told through the eyes of the victems, as most such stories would be.  The Full Sequence tells the story through the eyes of our mentally retarded, obsessive amateur surgeon, Martin.  Martin lives with his psychologically abusive (and rather demented) mother.  He quietly tries to avoid her as he perpetually wheezes and sweats his way around the house.  Working as a parking lot security attendant, Martin recruits centipede segments late at night.  He doesn't discriminate or target the weak; anyone will do.  He's also quite handy with a crowbar.  You'll wince.Writer/director Tom Sixx had spoken some pretty strong words about how intense this sequel would be.  He explained that part two would make part one look like the ""my little pony"" of human centipedes.  Sixx did succeed at somehow making a very different-styled movie from the same idea with some interesting nuance, however I would contest that he completely failed at pushing the envelope and further testing our limits.Sure, Martin is an awkwardly disturbing character--who never utters a word of dialogue, by the way--but the original dug its dirty fingernails into moral limits much more deeply.  The First Sequence delivered the utter terror and rage of the victems when captured.  Once assembled, the victems eyes, holding hands and muffled cries conveyed terror while also demonstrating their futile compassion for each other amidst this morally abject scenario.  Again, I understand that First Sequence was told through their eyes and Full Sequence wasn't.  But what did Full Sequence give me instead?  Other than a very cleverly architected and effective villain, nothing at all.Despite this shortcoming and noting that I enjoyed the First Sequence, I very much enjoyed this movie.  Martin is delightfully evil and somehow naively innocent at the same time.  His obsessive mania for Tom Sixx's First Sequence was a spiffy story device and his expressions of delight or frustration with his experiment made me recoil.  The biggest flaw of this movie is that it's really about Martin's obsession and not his human centipede pet project.  Fans of the first should be encouraged to watch this sequel, but do so expecting something quite different from a larger, more disturbingly macabre centipede.  If you want that, then hang around for Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence), which promises an irrationally long chain or patients linked by an irrational surgery.",4,"If you're a Human Centipede fan, don't expect a human centipede movie and let this take you to a different land of moral paucity",1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,3672,"['good', 'film', 'who', 'like', 'films', 'content', 'folks', 'turn', 'heads', 'cringe', 'walk', 'movies', ""'re"", 'Human', 'Centipede', 'fan', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'human', 'centipede', 'let', 'sequel', 'take', 'somewhat', 'different', 'land', 'moral', 'paucity', 'give', 'up', 'gorehounds.The', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'First', 'Sequence', '2010', 'really', 'tried', 'test', 'limits', 'what', 'Americans', 'would', 'sit', 'claim', 'enjoy', 'tackled', 'serious', 'medical', 'curiosities', 'chief', 'amongst', 'being', 'what', 'when', 'staple', 'someone', 'mouth', 'someone', 'else', 'business-end', 'Can', 'someone', 'survive', 'feces-only', 'diet', 'medically', 'provable', 'most', 'be', 'middle', 'segment', 'human', 'centipede', 'sequel', 'precisely', 'original', 'ends', 'sequel', 'original', 'actual', 'original', 'movie', 'being', 'watched', 'new', 'mad', 'scientist', 'inordinately', 'short', 'stout', 'balding', 'rather', 'protruding', 'eyes', 'cheeks', 'child-like', 'off-putting', 'excellent', 'sociopath', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'surprise', 'Ashley', 'Yennie', 'Jenny', 'First', 'Sequence', 'major', 'appearance', 'film', 'way', 'Martin', 'very', 'funny.The', 'First', 'Sequence', 'was', 'told', 'eyes', 'victems', 'most', 'such', 'stories', 'would', 'be', 'Full', 'Sequence', 'story', 'eyes', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'obsessive', 'amateur', 'surgeon', 'Martin', 'Martin', 'psychologically', 'abusive', 'rather', 'demented', 'mother', 'quietly', 'avoid', 'perpetually', 'sweats', 'way', 'house', 'Working', 'parking', 'lot', 'security', 'attendant', 'Martin', 'centipede', 'segments', 'late', 'night', ""n't"", 'discriminate', 'target', 'weak', 'anyone', 'will', 'do', 'also', 'quite', 'handy', 'crowbar', ""'ll"", 'wince.Writer/director', 'Tom', 'Sixx', 'had', 'spoken', 'pretty', 'strong', 'words', 'how', 'intense', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'explained', 'part', 'two', 'would', 'make', 'part', 'one', 'look', 'little', 'pony', 'human', 'centipedes', 'Sixx', 'did', 'succeed', 'somehow', 'making', 'very', 'different-styled', 'movie', 'same', 'idea', 'interesting', 'nuance', 'however', 'would', 'contest', 'completely', 'failed', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'further', 'testing', 'limits.Sure', 'Martin', 'awkwardly', 'disturbing', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'word', 'dialogue', 'way', 'original', 'dug', 'dirty', 'fingernails', 'moral', 'limits', 'much', 'more', 'deeply', 'First', 'Sequence', 'delivered', 'utter', 'terror', 'rage', 'victems', 'when', 'captured', 'Once', 'assembled', 'victems', 'eyes', 'holding', 'hands', 'muffled', 'cries', 'conveyed', 'terror', 'also', 'demonstrating', 'futile', 'compassion', 'other', 'amidst', 'morally', 'abject', 'scenario', 'Again', 'understand', 'First', 'Sequence', 'was', 'told', 'eyes', 'Full', 'Sequence', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'did', 'Full', 'Sequence', 'give', 'instead', 'Other', 'very', 'cleverly', 'architected', 'effective', 'villain', 'nothing', 'all.Despite', 'shortcoming', 'noting', 'enjoyed', 'First', 'Sequence', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Martin', 'delightfully', 'evil', 'somehow', 'naively', 'innocent', 'same', 'time', 'obsessive', 'mania', 'Tom', 'Sixx', 'First', 'Sequence', 'was', 'spiffy', 'story', 'device', 'expressions', 'delight', 'frustration', 'experiment', 'made', 'recoil', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'movie', 'really', 'Martin', 'obsession', 'not', 'human', 'centipede', 'pet', 'project', 'Fans', 'first', 'should', 'be', 'encouraged', 'watch', 'sequel', 'do', 'so', 'expecting', 'something', 'quite', 'different', 'larger', 'more', 'disturbingly', 'macabre', 'centipede', 'want', 'then', 'Human', 'Centipede', '3', 'Final', 'Sequence', 'irrationally', 'long', 'chain', 'patients', 'linked', 'irrational', 'surgery']",The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence

1498285,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005S9EHL6,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[183, 197]","In 2010 writer/director Tom Six unveiled The Human Centipede (First Sequence), a horror film with a plot so outlandish, so vulgar that it got a lot more attention than a typical low-budget, small release horror film. Six immediately promised a sequel, divulging little detail about it except that the first film would be ""My Little Pony compared with part two."" The first Human Centipede, promoted as ""100% medically accurate,"" was remarkably tame and tastefully done considering the extreme subject matter, the brunt of its cultural impact coming from the premise rather than the execution. The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) substantially ups the ante, going so far as to promoted it as ""100% medically inaccurate."" With the film being banned in the UK until 32 cuts were made, Six proved himself an honest filmmaker who truly delivered on his promise. What's scary is that a third film is already planned and he has said it will make this installment look like a Disney film. Discussing a film like this is not easy, because The Human Centipede is a film you enjoy the same way you enjoy a freeway car accident. There's nothing redeeming, entertaining, or significant about it, but it's hard to take your eyes off of it. These films fall into their own niche of ""shock horror,"" horror films that don't intend to evoke fear but shock and disgust. Despite the decided lack of artistic value, I do enjoy seeing filmmakers push the limits of a genre and make something as extreme as possible. While the fact that someone not only had this idea but actually immortalized it on film may destroy any lingering faith you have in the human race, it's an admirable effort that, despite being soulless and demoralizing, accomplishes its intended goal.Opening with the final scene of the first film, the camera pans back to reveal it being watched on a laptop in a parking garage tollbooth. The viewer is Martin (Laurence R. Harvey), a stout, bug-eyed, asthmatic British man who watches the first film obsessively at every opportunity, has a scrapbook dedicated to it, and even has a pet centipede. His extraordinarily creepy childlike appearance and demeanor coupled with this obsession make it quite clear that Martin is mentally ill. It's revealed that Martin, who never speaks a word in the film, was sexually abused by his father as a child and lives with a mother (Vivien Bridson) who blames him for getting her beloved husband sent to prison. Frequently alone in the parking garage at night, Martin uses this solitude to start attacking and kidnapping people. After gaining access to a warehouse, he begins storing those he has kidnapped with the intention of recreating the human centipede in the film he so loves...But, there's a twist. Martin wants to create a human centipede with 12 people.This film goes into some of the dark, unheard of places and Six's decision to pull the story into the realm of reality adds an extra level of horror to the happenings. Unfolding in stark black and white (although originally shot in color), this film is cut from a different cloth than the first. The tone and atmosphere, as well as the gratuity and fearlessness, recall the films of German director J&ouml;rg Buttgereit, particularly Nekromantik and Schramm, while the black and white imagery and haunting use of silence is reminiscent of David Lynch's Eraserhead. It's easy to dismiss artistic credibility when it's utilized within the torture porn genre, as even torture porn that attempts to be artistic is still just torture porn. While some may (and have) called it artless, Six is a capable director. There are scenes that don't involve violence or gore that are both effective and eerie, but if Six's ability is ignored it's his fault for making such a no-holds barred film. Nothing is off-limits in The Human Centipede II, with even pregnant women and newborns falling victim to the horrific violence. Six is a director gleefully free of pretense and for all of the artistic intentions it appears to have, it never takes itself too seriously. Despite how staggeringly violent it becomes, it's pretty tongue-in-cheek. When Martin actually lures Ashlynn Yennie, the actress who played 1/3 of the centipede in First Sequence, to his warehouse under the guise that she's auditioning for a Quentin Tarantino movie, it's clear that that this film, as well as being horrifically violent, is self-aware. It's easy to forget that the idea of sewing people mouth-to-anus is a rather ludicrous premise and that Six has made it the horrifying premise of two films rather and kept it from being unintentionally funny is an accomplishment in and of itself.The final 30 minutes will make you realize how conservative the first film was, with Six taking everything as far as his imagination will allow. All of the disgusting elements that were only alluded to are allowed to come to light. He holds nothing back, allowing his potent mix of the horrifying and lack of seriousness to collide when he finally allows a single color, the color brown, to enter the palette. You must recall that the procedure in the first film was performed by a surgeon, with the tools and ability to perform this procedure. Martin is no surgeon and when the time finally comes for him to make his own centipede he uses whatever tools are on hand (hammer, knife, staple gun, etc.). Needless to say, the procedure is much more crude and stomach-churning. Many scenes made me squirm and there are images that will stay with you for a long time after the film has ended; this is not a film for the faint of heart.I regrettably confirm that this is not the most disgusting, depraved film I've ever seen, but for the average moviegoer it probably will be. How can you critique a film of this sort? It's immune to criticism as there's no way to simply point out the good and the bad. Even the most ardent fan can't ignore that this is a piece of filmmaking with no substance behind it. The Human Centipede II does not function under the faade of a metaphorical social statement in the way last year's A Serbian Film did nor does it even try to make up a reason for its existence. If you look beneath the depravity of the film you'll find only more depravity. In that sense, this is a soulless, obscene, and trashy film. Yes, the acting is solid and say what you will about the film itself, Harvey gives a chilling, effective performance. It's well-made except for some jumpy editing, sound effects that seem out of sync with what is shown onscreen (pay particularly close attention whenever Martin uses his gun on someone), and an ending that is disturbingly ambiguous but also feels like a cop out. There may not be a reason for its existence, but Six has made the film with the intention of shaking his audience. If you make a film with the sole intention of making your audience nauseous and you succeed, how can the work be dismissed solely because it offends your moral and cinematic sensibilities? Six has not made a ""good film"" here, but he has made a well-made one that succeeds in exactly the area it intends. Those who will be most offended by it will be those who haven't seen it and those who are forced to watch it. If you consciously embark on the journey, you know where it's going to take you.It's rare that a film makes you feel unclean just watching it. The effects this film could have on your psychological well-being and how effectively it offends all sense of moral decency is something that can't be ignored. This film is a success when looked at in that light. This is not a movie you like or dislike; it's a movie that simply exists and it's your decision to choose how you cope with its existence, be it by watching it or ignoring it. At its most primordial level, it's effective in its desire to offend. It's certainly unforgettable. The need to assign this film a rating has pushed me into a corner, confused on how to choose something which will be looked at as indicative over whether it's a good film or a bad film. With a sigh, I give The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) a 3/5 and throw up my hands.",3,"Shocking, Effective, and Without Reason",1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,8095,"['2010', 'writer/director',

The camera pulls back, to reveal that this is playing on a laptop computer, and a man in a toll booth in a parking garage is watching the film. Martin Lomax (Laurence R. Harvey) is an asthmatic, overweight, mentally ill, middle-aged, short British man. He lives in a small flat with his emotionally abusive mother (Vivien Bridson) while working as a security guard in an underground parking garage. His neighbours play Hard Dance music at high levels all night and day, and Martin often spies on the rich individuals who use the parking garage. Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens) suspects that Martin was sexually abused repeatedly by his father, now in prison (a suspicion confirmed when Martin has a flashback to this abuse, in which the audience hears the father [voiced by Tom Six] raping his son).Martin is obsessed with ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"", watching it repeatedly at home and in his toll booth. At one point, he is depicted masturbating (graphically and on-screen) to the film with sandpaper wrapped around his penis. He keeps a centipede as a pet, and maintains a scrapbook on the film. When his mother destroys the scrapbook, Martin crushes her skull and then props her dead body up at the kitchen table. Martin wordlessly decides to recreate the fictional experiment he saw portrayed in The Human Centipede (First Sequence). Medically untrained, he assembles a potpourri of kitchen gadgets, woodworking tools, and assorted household items, puts them in a suitcase, and secures a dingy, dirty, dark abandoned warehouse to recreate the film's medical experiment. But Martin intends to create not just a three-person centipede, but the ""full sequence"" of 12 connected people.How do you review a film like ""Human Centipede II""? It is one of the most vile, reprehensible, and ugly horror movies that I have ever seen? You want broken teeth, crushed babies, and explosive diarrhea? It's all here. This is a film that completely succeeds in what it wants to do - gross out its small but intensive audience - and will do anything in its power to achieve it. Stylish and incredibly well made with some nice artistic touches here and there - I especially liked the ""dinner table"" scene. Nonetheless, none of this really adds up to very much which is a shame considering that Syx is a talented director with a lot more to offer. Overall, I can't really recommend this film but I can't recommend that you don't see it either. Does that make any sense?

1498287,A33MDQZWJ5NZE4,B005S9EHL6,Karl P. Madsen,"[3, 7]","Fan - 1. enthusiastic admirer - an enthusiastic admirer of a celebrity or public performer. 2. Same as fanatic (noun)The sequel to Human Centipede (The First Sequence), Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is a unique format. Instead of building the second movie off the events, and timeline, of the first film, this sequel uses the First Sequence as the catalyst for the events of the Full Sequence. That's why this film is 100% medically inaccurate instead of the first Human Centipede's 100% medically accurate status.Martin (Laurence R. Harvey - cinematic debut) has some problems; physically he's short, overweight, and a bit awkward, and because of mental, physical, and sexual abuse he doesn't speak, can only perform the simplest jobs, and is a bit socially awkward. Oh yeah, Martin is also obsessed with the movie The Human Centipede (The First Sequence). That is if obsessed means you watch the movie continuously, have a scrap book documenting various aspects of the movie, and (shudder) you become aroused at certain points of the movie. So, yeah, obsessed is a good way to describe him.So, Martin is obsessed with the film Human Centipede (The First Sequence) and, because of certain situations throughout his life, is determined to not only replicate the process from the first movie, but to outdo it by a factor of four. Whereas in the first one the doctor was a successful surgeon, with state of the art facility in his basement, and the knowledge to make the procedure 100% medically accurate, Martin is not as accomplished. In fact Martin lives in relative poverty with a mother that hates him for having her husband imprisoned, who abused Martin physically, mentally, and sexually for most of his life. His doctor may or may not be abusing him, and the neighbors intimidate him. The only plus to Martin is his job in a parking structure, which allows him the privacy to watch his movie, and hunt for his subjects. Okay, here's the meat of the movie; Martin is going to outdo his obsession by creating a human centipede consisting of twelve (yes, I said 12) subjects. Of the twelve two die, one is his intimidating neighbor; eight are innocent victims who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. His coup de grace is the acquisition of Ashlynn Rennie (Human Centipede) one of the actresses who played in the original, whom he has tricked into becoming his number one (and not in a good way). Remember, Martin doesn't have the education or the money to perform the operations properly, with a well outfitted facility, so he acquires a warehouse, his surgical kit comes from a toolbox under the sink, anesthesia courtesy of a crowbar, sutures from Swingline, and bandages are duct tape. Anything from this point onward is either a spoiler, or inappropriate.Special Features:Interview with Filmmaker Tom SixCommentary with Tom Six and Laurence R. HarveySet tour of WarehouseFoley Sound EffectsMaking the PosterDeleted ScenePromoTrailerTeaserKarl's Scores:Acting - B+Setting - A-Special Effects - B+Creep Factor - ATension - AWhat the Heck Moments - Oh MyOverall - AThe first installment of this trilogy was a masterpiece of ingenuity and disturbingness. The second film could have been a contender for with first; the first film itself is used as an influence vice a starting point, it was shot in black and white to enhance the feeling of unhealthiness and lack of sanitation, and the simple fact that a man is prepared to not only recreate but to surpass a fictional event without the proper facilities. Several problems occur though. One is what I call `Too Much'; in this case too much is wrong with Martin. Hey, pick one, maybe two, but did he have to be mentally, physically, and sexually abused by his father, the target of other sexual predators, socially awkward and unattractive, and despised by the mother that keeps trying to kill him and commit suicide because her husband is in prison for his atrocities against Martin. It bothered me that I couldn't find Martin as a sympathetic character, because I really wanted to. I think that if he had any combination of two of his problems a cruel insanity could have been portrayed as cruelly insane. Another problem I have is that I'm a fan of retribution, and this film didn't use the retribution factor to a fulfilling and disgusting end. Of the four characters that Martin has cause to seek retribution against only two ends up as part of the experiment. As to the disgusting point, how would you feel if he had put dear ol' mummy in the middle of the line-up.  I just threw up in mouth a little bit just writing that. Human Centipede II is a good movie, just not a great movie. It has all the right elements; tension, disturbing situations, and an innovative idea, but the execution could have been better. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad film, it simply could've been better. This movie isn't for everyone, but I liked it.ComicsOnline gives Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) 3  human experiments out of 5",4,ComicsOnline Says,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,5003,"['Fan', '1.',

Whoever would dream this whole plot and concept up should be institutionalized and that is the scary part of this whole thing.  I am amazed they were able to fund this and even find actors to do what they did.  I hope they paid those centipede actors a lot of money because they deserved it for what they had to go through.Although the whole movie is pretty unbelievable I could not get over the fact that these people before they are even attached to one another were just laying around on the floor of this big warehouse secured with just duct tape securing each of them.  All while this fat clown is out and about for what looks like days at a time.  All these poor fools had to do was use the floor to peel the duct tape off their mouths and then use their mouth to bite through the rest of the duct tape on them.  Then wait for the fat clown to come back and clobber him.  What dummies.  One of the worst movies I have ever seen.I have to say the way they showed the fat clown treating his wife was probably the most entertaining part of the movie.  Especially how he used her as a decoy for that clod playing loud music upstairs... hahahah.Pure garbage all around though.  And I really feel sorry for those centipede actors.

1498291,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B005S9EHL6,Larry Benjamin,"[2, 2]","I don't normally watch horror films, but because of this one's notoriety, I felt that I couldn't pass it up. Aside from the shock value of coprophagia, and the pointless violence the characters inflict on each other, I'm convinced that virtually the entire sequence is merely a fantasy taking place in the protagonist's mind. My reasons are:We learn at the beginning that the first ""Human Centipede"" film is only a film in the context of the second one. This foreshadows the conclusion that the second one is not real, either.Martin seems to operate in a world with no police, and few other people besides his oppressors and the people he torments. No one bothers to check up on the growning number of missing people, or what surely must have been noisy gunshots in an urban area.No one notices the baby left in the car, in the middle of a driving lane in the parking structure, and it appears to suffer no ill effects after what must be several days with no food or water. The victims in the warehouse, despite being shot, clubbed about the head with a tire iron, and also left alone for days without food or water, are all still alive when Martin starts to connect them. At the same time, none of them escape or even change position, despite only being bound and gagged by duct tape. After he cuts the victims' knees and connects everyone together, despite being in what must be agonizing pain, they all cooperatively rise up on all fours and progress around the room for Martin's amusement, without any apparent effort on his part to make them do this. Implausibly, Martin happens to have a bottle of injectable laxative conveniently available.Ashlynn Yennie flies to London by herself, under the impression that she is auditioning for the new Quentin Tarantino movie. How Martin arranged this is a mystery - did he forge Tarantino's studio letterhead? Is he more articulate than he appears? Surely very extensive and complex arrangements are made for this sort of thing.At the end, Martin is cleaned up and back at work, watching his favorite movie again, with no apparent consequences from leaving the baby in the car and the body of his therapist in the garage only a few feet away, not to mention the many missing people in the warehouse, including the landlord. The therapist, by the way, shows up at a very convenient time, and doesn't display the expected reaction when Martin shoots the other man right in front of him.The point may be that in our world, the events in this film are ""just a movie."" It's an irrelevant point, because we are still watching the same images, whether they are in the ""real world"" of the film, or the protagonist's imagination. One can only imagine the next film in the series, which is supposed to make the first two look like Ozzie and Harriet in comparison.",4,Gratuitous horror,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,2799,"['do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'watch', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'notoriety', 'felt', 'could', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'Aside', 'shock', 'value', 'coprophagia', 'pointless', 'violence', 'characters', 'inflict', 'other', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'virtually', 'entire', 'sequence', 'merely', 'fantasy', 'taking', 'place', 'protagonist', 'mind', 'reasons', 'are', 'learn', 'beginning', 'first', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'film', 'only', 'film', 'context', 'second', 'one', 'conclusion', 'second', 'one', 'not', 'real', 'either.Martin', 'operate', 'world', 'police', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'oppressors', 'people', 'one', 'check', 'up', 'growning', 'number', 'missing', 'people', 'what', 'surely', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'noisy', 'gunshots', 'urban', 'area.No', 'one', 'baby', 'left', 'car', 'middle', 'driving', 'lane', 'parking', 'structure', 'suffer', 'ill', 'effects', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'several', 'days', 'food', 'water', 'victims', 'warehouse', 'being', 'shot', 'clubbed', 'head', 'tire', 'iron', 'also', 'left', 'alone', 'days', 'food', 'water', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'when', 'Martin', 'connect', 'same', 'time', 'none', 'escape', 'even', 'change', 'position', 'only', 'being', 'bound', 'gagged', 'duct', 'tape', 'victims', 'knees', 'connects', 'everyone', 'together', 'being', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'agonizing', 'pain', 'cooperatively', 'rise', 'up', 'fours', 'progress', 'room', 'Martin', 'amusement', 'apparent', 'effort', 'part', 'make', 'do', 'Implausibly', 'Martin', 'have', 'bottle', 'injectable', 'laxative', 'conveniently', 'available.Ashlynn', 'Yennie', 'flies', 'London', 'impression', 'auditioning', 'new', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'movie', 'How', 'Martin', 'arranged', 'mystery', 'did', 'forge', 'Tarantino', 'studio', 'letterhead', 'more', 'articulate', 'Surely', 'very', 'extensive', 'complex', 'arrangements', 'are', 'made', 'sort', 'thing.At', 'end', 'Martin', 'cleaned', 'up', 'back', 'work', 'watching', 'favorite', 'movie', 'again', 'apparent', 'consequences', 'leaving', 'baby', 'car', 'body', 'therapist', 'garage', 'only', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'not', 'mention', 'many', 'missing', 'people', 'warehouse', 'including', 'landlord', 'therapist', 'way', 'up', 'very', 'convenient', 'time', ""n't"", 'display', 'expected', 'reaction', 'when', 'Martin', 'shoots', 'other', 'man', 'right', 'front', 'him.The', 'point', 'may', 'be', 'world', 'events', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'movie', 'irrelevant', 'point', 'are', 'still', 'watching', 'same', 'images', 'are', 'real', 'world', 'film', 'protagonist', 'imagination', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'next', 'film', 'series', 'supposed', 'make', 'first', 'two', 'look', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'comparison']",The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence

Seeing him cough, sneeze and gag is more disgusting than what he does to other people, with the exception of him knocking someone's teeth out with a hammer. At-least I assume that's what happened. I had to look away.Having to look away is the point as director Tom Six presents a horror sequel that's even more bloody and violent than part 1. Though there's no narrative explanation for the sudden transformation to black and white, it also looks better. There's a darker, more sinister tone here. Lacking is any kid of narrative depth.There is a story and even some backstory. Martin, who was apparently sexually abused by his father as a child, is a die-hard fan of the first Human Centipede movie and has become obsessed with creating one of his own. But that's just a flat platform for the gimmicky concept, which is, so far, all this set has going for it.If there's a part 3; and judging by the way this one ends, there probably will be; I'd like a centipede of all girls.

1498297,A31WNVR5WYCP38,B005S9EHL6,Mark A. Derasmo,"[7, 9]","I am sort of a horror movie ultra fan starting way way back when I was just a kid,during the glorious 80's when slasher films ruled the genre. I have seen it all from the Japanese style frightfests to low budget horror to zombie flicks to the ultra violent torture themes that are so prevalent today. With that being said, I am not that easily shocked, probably the last time I was moved or nervous by a horror film was the first time I watched the Exorcist,(I'm dating myself),and in the last few years perhaps Cannibal Holocaust. This film is vile,disturbing,extremely disgusting,and when it is finished,if you make it all the way to the end,you will feel as if you immediately require a shower. If I am rating this movie solely on production value,easily 5 stars. The black and white method of shooting the film was pure genius,with director Six creating a dark and gritty patina that transferred effectively to the viewer. Character creation,another win. Martin was extremely convincing to the point that you actually wondered if they cast an actual mentally disturbed and violent recluse for the part. Then theres the actual story...more than halfway throught the film the whole thing kind of falls apart,in the first film of course you had a brilliant but demented surgeon,now we are treated to a twisted human mole with household tools,duct tape and a staple gun. The subject matter is what it is,watching this movie after having viewed the first installment you obviously have to expect it to be disturbing,but wow,it crosses lines that no other film in my memory has before,and I suppose the fact that during certain parts I cringed and almost turned completely away means the film delivered its desired effect. I cannot remember the last time I felt absolute revulsion while watching any film,let alone extreme horror,but this piece was a dandy. I think the point where I almost jumped off the Human Centipede train was as a previous reviewer pointed out that towards the climax a single color was allowed onto the pallette...brown. If you have seen the first movie,you will know what I'm getting at. All in all,and this is comoing from a severe horror movie buff,this one kind of left me wondering just how far is too far...watch if you dare my friends.

1498299,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B005S9EHL6,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[5, 9]","Let's go over the standard arguments.1. You know what this movie is about. It's about a maniac attaching people in a line from mouth to anus. A large portion of the world would give that sentence zero stars, let alone choose to watch and review a movie about it. Therefore, if you have a moral or just biological aversion to that sort of thing, quit reading these reviews and move on. It's not fair to give a movie zero stars just because you find the premise repellant.2. It's not supposed to be art. Six does a competent directing job, and he's adept at creating suspense and unease. The main character, Martin, is so ably played by newcomer Laurence Harvey that it seems odd to believe the actor didn't inspire the script. The black and white and the focus of the story contrast cleverly with the first film, which was downright clinical compared to this. The point (part of it) seems to be that the depravity experienced by the victims is nothing compared to that of the villain. But all of this is really just a footnote to the main point, which is graphic torture, gore, and people eating a lot of ""down there desserts."" This is hammered home by the inclusion of only one color to the film's palette, and it ain't turquoise. The point being, you can't give the film zero stars just because it is artless, pointless, and base if that's what it aspires to be. You can't complain that your hot dog doesn't taste enough like a steak.3. Is it done well? Ah. The most important question. You can argue story, characters, setting and dialogue all you want, but if a movie doesn't want to have those things, or if it seeks to be a cartoon of them, then so be it. You judge a film by its own goals, not your preferences. And in that respect, this film fails.You heard me.Look. This is all fake. We all know that. The power of a film -- good or bad -- is to draw you into its world so firmly and deeply that, even if you loathe what you are seeing, you still invest part of yourself into the reality. It's called suspension of disbelief, and gory movies have used the natural human aversion for pain as a way to skip the tough work that usually a plot or characters do to slowly pull a viewer in and hold them fast to the film. You see something graphic, and an instinctive part of you is jolted into that reality, happily or not-so. As tech has improved, films have found more and more envelopes to push, sometimes for no other reason than to say, ""Look at how convincing this is!""This film is not convincing. The gore is so overboard, that it becomes a parody of itself. The movie seems to hint that it is supposed to be a comedy. There is more than one obvious ploy for humor as Martin interacts (silently) with his psychotic mother, ludicrously lecherous psychiatrist, malicious and thick-necked upstairs neighbor, a whole host of drunk, obnoxious, or unfortunate people with cars, and even an actress from the first film who is lured into his clutches because she thinks he's involved with a Quentin Tarantino film. Ha ha ha ha ha! Hilarious! Now let's kill them all!Wait a minute. Torture porn isn't funny, nor is it meant to be. Or maybe I didn't get a memo or something. At any rate, say what you will about the film just being goofy or playing tongue-in-cheek or just being a lampoon of the first, this kind of dismissiveness is one kind too many in a film where the thrills are meant to be a more visceral kind of voyeurism. As a result, you cannot help but be pulled out of the reality of the film and into a world where people who are wide awake, of above average build, and bound by a single strip of duct tape politely lie almost perfectly still while someone knocks out their teeth or cuts up their knees. They wriggle and grimace and scream to show you it hurts, of course, but that seems to be all the energy they have.That's just one example. I could listen dozens and dozens of more where the scene, moment, or very idea is so outlandish that it's very ludicrousness robs it of any power it could have. Instead, you spend most of the movie wondering how each special effect was achieved, or how these actors felt midway through filming, or what the conversation was like in between takes. And please don't think I'm saying this to say how tough I am. There were at least two moments where I was pulled into the film's sickness, where it was looking for an effect and it pulled it off. Overall, however, the movie was so excessive that it became redundant and stupid, and both of those things are bad no matter WHAT kind of film you're trying to make.But does that mean I get to give it zero stars? Maybe the film WANTED to be an over-the-top parody, a farce, a redundant, relentless, uninspired middle finger to its audience. Even if this were true, I finally chose to give the film this website's lowest rating because...SPOILER ALERT...the whole thing is just a dream. Yup! It was all in Martin's head. I say boo and hiss to that. Sorry, movie. The only film that I will ever accept that ending for isThe Wizard of Oz. It gets a pass because I like the Lollipop Guild. Beyond that, ""it was all a dream"" is a conceit that robs every film of its very purpose. If you don't believe me, try to think of the last time you actually were glad to hear someone say, ""You gotta hear about this dream I had!"" If you're not in it, you don't care, and I feel the same about stories to books, plays, TV shows and films. It's one of fictions worst and lamest cop outs, and it is used here to lazily explain every single one of the film's plot holes as the consequence of being in the head of a lunatic.Ultimately, the film is insulting but not in the gut-wrenching way it wants to be, which means this movie fails to achieve even its own meager goal.

The first Centipede was a nasty, violent affair that makes you just uncomfortable watching it, but it had some semblance of character and story, a real villain and victims you could actually want to survive.This time around the villain is a squat parking attendant who's addicted to the original film. He fantasies about creating his own twelve-person centipede and the first 50 minutes is really just him collecting his prey. Most of the film features little dialogue and there are many, many, many looooooooooooooooooooooooong shots of naked people tied up on the floor. There's no story, just violence for the sake of it. I love horror and I have no issue with all the gore and nasty violence you can fit in the film, don't mind nudity or sex or all mixed either, but if it's just there it's boring and that's what this is.I was constantly fast-forwarding as nothing was happening and the camera was just stuck on naked, writhing duct-taped bodies.

The main character is a short, fat, creepy security guard. The actor playing that role was top-notch in his depiction of the character, but in this movie, I am not sure if that is actually a good thing, because now people will associate him with this film and I don't know how that might affect his career.The film is shot in black and white. I suppose Mr. Six wanted to add an artsy feel to it, but it didn't work. This is not art, period. The black and white does have one advantage - blood is now black, so the monochromatic color does take a bit of edge off the gore that is liberally applied through the film.Is this film a direct sequel to the Human Centipede? Actually no - the main character is a huge fanboy of the film and is shown watching it, and he has a scrapbook as well, so the Human Centipede 1 is a film within the film of the second one. Actually, that makes more sense than if the Human Centipede 1 were a real occurrence within the sequel. Ashlyn Yennie comes back in this film as an actress lured by the prospect of another job.What follows is nothing short of disgusting, even with the black and white. The human suffering depicted is appalling. Someone in pain doesn't make a movie bad, but it needs to be balanced with other stuff. There is no balancing force here, and the ending was one of the most cliched ones I've ever seen.Mind you, I do enjoy horror movies. I've seen some pretty great ones, so I don't hate this movie just because it's horror. Keep in mind that before Mr. Six made the first movie, he was not forthcoming with his investors as to what the movie would entail, and this tells you that on at least one level, Mr. Six knew that what he was doing was wrong and that investors would back out if they knew the full story. That in itself is a big warning sign.There's also an adage - 'just because you can doesn't mean you should'. This movie fits that saying perfectly.The film is disgusting. The only thing going for it is its shock value - it offers zero artistic merit whatsoever. I cannot help but wonder what filmmakers of the 30's-50's (who made films like 'It's a Wonderful Life' or these Shirley Temple films) would think of such films like the Human Centipede or its sequel.

The British and Australian censors banned the release of the film in England and Austrailia during it's initial release. The film looks at the darkest reaches of the human mind and evokes the hidden desires of lust, murder, hatred, and emotional pain which all people have had once or more in their lives.

Human monsters do exist and often they are people of status and/or of material comforts.

1498308,AV8GEO6IYIOOQ,B005S9EHL6,PoochJD,"[2, 3]","This is a film that will divide the audience, straight down the line. You'll either love this and relish in its sadistic tendencies, or you'll loathe everything about the film, demanding it be banned, and condemning anyone who likes the film or tolerates its meer existance.Thus, if you enjoyed the first, then this sequel is actually pretty good. Martin, (Laurence Harvey, in one of the most horrifically challenging, but superbly-acted roles ever undertaken in the horror genre), is a London car-park attendant. A short, fat, grotesque figure of a man, with no friends, and one very screwed-up family. Living in his squalid flat, with his unhinged mother, who loathes every fibre of his being, and with regular visits from his doctor/psychologist who seems to have an unnerving &#34;interest&#34; in him, he sleeps, eats and works, with almost nothing fulfilling in his existance....With one exception. His decidely extreme interest in the film THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE. Rewatching it, several times a night, every night, to pass the time at work, he hatches a plan to create his own 12-person centipede, for real.During his job, he comes across many people who society probably wouldn't miss: prostitutes, thugs, angry lovers, taxi drivers, and thus his plan begins. Shooting, maiming and kidnapping his victims, he carts them off to a large storage unit/warehouse, where he starts to turn his fantasties into actually reality... with decidedly demented results.You can't watch something like this, and then try to take a moral high ground about it being offensive, degrading or morally dubious. You're watching a film about a man who kidnaps, tortures and brutalises 12 human beings, before he sews them together, mouth-to-anus, and defiling them. If you want to talk about morals, then go watch SESAME STREET! As such, you have to take the film as you find it. This is a film that revels in excess. Whilst not the most offensive horror film in recent years, it's certainly in the Top 10, and you can see why the British Board Of Film Classification (BBFC) and many other censorship agencies around the globe cut or banned this film. Thankfully, here, we get the uncut, uncensored version, in full 1080p, and it's a truly beautiful film to view.The monochrome photography is sublime. Apart from a couple of moments, the monochromatic imagery is stark, shocking and a feast for the eyes. There is real beauty, in this dark tale of forbidden pleasure. A colourised version would certainly have been interesting to see, but director Tom Six has stated he never wanted the film to be seen in anything other than black-and-white. One, to make the film less offensive, but Two, to give the film a more arthouse feel to it.Most of the acting - almost all British - is awful, and I really do mean that. It's shockingly bad. Many of the cast make Shia LaBeouf look like Al Pacino by comparison. So, you have to be quite forgiving here. And the dialogue is rotten also. Much of it, a litany of swearing and threats, that almost make you feel glad that these people are being abused/killed. This is not a film about nice people and nice things. So bear that in mind.The one exception is Laurence Harvey as Martin, who manages to imbue the lead role with an intense humanity, that really doesn't warrant it. Martin is a man hated by everyone, and yet, somehow, he manages to come across as being the only decent human being in the entire movie. Yes, what he does is sick and despicable, but he appears to be doing this, because of repeated childhood sexual abuse from his father - thankfully now in prison. So, to a tiny degree, you almost feel sorry for him, as he channels his anger and frustration with life, into one thing, and one thing only. Feeling sorry for the most reprehensible character in a film, is certainly unusual in film-making.So, is the film shocking? Yes. Even for most hardened gorehounds, there will be at least one moment that genuinely shocks or disturbs you. (For many, that moment is one of the last you see at the end of the film.) There is a lot of sadism on show here, and the viewers are enticed into revelling in the pain and suffering, without giving us any kind of reason to care about them. As such, I can see why the BBFC cut this film by over 3 minutes. The uncut version, is extremely brutal at times, and the monochrome footage doesn't soften some of the violence. If anything, it makes it stronger, and tougher to watch! And viewers can't file charges of sexism or misogyny against it either, as Martin is very much an equal-opportunities killer. He cares not whether his victims are male or female, as he will mistreat and abuse any of them, equally badly.Will you enjoy this film? I think many will. There are some very dark veins of humour pulsing through this film, and any horror movie that can give you a laugh as well as a shock, has got to be worth a watch. The fact that the film ends on a downbeat note, also helps. There aren't many films which don't tie-up all the loose ends, and leave you feeling like the world is a happy place, and I enjoy those films moreso. (THE MIST is one such film, that I would urge horror fans to check-out.) But you should be aware that this is not a nice film. If you want nice, and palatable, and moderately scary, then this is not the film you should be choosing. If, however, you want a ride on the very, very dark side of the road, then this should satisfy you more than not.As a sequel it works well, but you could watch it on its own, without having seen Part One, and still enjoy most of it. The fact director Tom Six is putting the finishing touches to THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 3: FINAL SEQUENCE, which will hopefully be released in 2014, and mark this film look like BAMBI by comparison, suggests this will go down as one of the most nauseating trilogies in film history.But ultimately, your enjoyment or love for this film will come down to one thing, and one thing only - your own internal moral compass.

But despite that, &lt;em>The Human Centipede II&lt;/em> feels &lt;em>more&lt;/em> like a cheap explitation flick than the original did, so I'm going to compare the two by alleging that this one is and the first one isn't. Bear with me, it's all relative. I promise.Plot: Martin (Laurence R. Harvey in his screen debut) is a misfit loner, possibly mentally challenged, who lives with his psychotic mother (Vivien Bridson in her feature debut) and his incredibly large centipede. He is obsessed with Tom Six's movie &lt;em>The Human Centipede&lt;/em>, and eventually gets the idea to try to replicate the movie in real life, but with a dozen segments instead of three. He uses his job as a night watchman in a parking garage to be able to approach people, incapacitate them, and drag them back to a warehouse he's not quite renting (you'll see how that works). If you've seen the original, you know what's coming next. It is well within the bounds of Martin's character that he becomes a tinpot dictator like Dr. Heiter never was......and ultimately, that's why I didn't like this one as much as I did the one before (not that I was all that big a fan of the original). While it &lt;em>is&lt;/em> completely within Martin's character to run the cheap exploitation tricks he does on his creation, that doesn't make them any less gratuitous from the POV of the viewer. It feels like a Russ Meyer cash grab, except Russ Meyer had some basic semblance of class, as odd as that statement may sound.Given the premise, you can also expect a whole lot of meta with this.

Of course things don't logically make sense, and of course the filmmaker cuts scenes abruptly because this is how the mind works.  When Martin, the protagonist, is in his white coat, we are into pure dark fantasy, because parking garage attendants don't actually wear white coats.  He is copying his idol from the first movie, Dr. Heiter (where things logically could have happened.) The inner struggle of this character between hatred, rage, the desire for revenge, and guilt are what drive this movie.  Can you staple and duct tape people together anus to mouth?  Of course not; the staples would tear almost immediately.  The building-the-centipede scenes, while overlong (which is why I knocked it down a star) are pure revenge and rage fantasy.  If I'm an overweight, abused, semi-retarded individual, how would I connect people together like Dr. Heiter did in the original?

1498318,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B005S9EHL6,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[4, 6]","Not that anybody's really been asking for it, but here it is-The Human Centipede 2!!  And Oddly enough I like it more than the first film.  The first film, while decently directed and all, was pretty much nothing more than overrated torture porn with a novel idea.....at least I think so.  With this sequel, director Tom Six has gone a different direction with the same novel idea.  Here it's more in the vein of the whole psychological character study of a disturbed mind-Martin: A Portrait Of A Movie Obsessed Psycho, if you will.  Plus there's an artsy Lynch-esque twist on it.  Whether or not this whole aproach works, is up to viewer interpretation, but I will say that this movie does fall into some of the cliches of that style just as the first film fell into the cliches of torture porn.So here in Centipede 2, we have Martin, a security officer(though I'd sure never feel secure with him around) of a parking garage.  He's overweight, sweaty, bug eyed, wheezy and asthmatic.  Definitely not the typical horror psycho who is usually charismatic or just outrageously crazy and wild.  Martin's cut more from the Ed Gein cloth-Yeah, we all think he's weird, but he couldn't possibly be threatening, right?  He's more pathetic than menacing.  But no less deranged!!Well, Martin's got a lousy home life-His mother wants him dead, he was sexually abused by his dad, and he's balding.  So, he spends his time obsessing over the film, The Human Centipede.  He's constantly watching it and even has a scrapbook of everything associated with it.  So naturally he gets the idea that he wants to replicate it, but upping the ante by making a twelve person centipede.  Why not?  Bad choice of films to want to copy though.  Imagine how many lives would be saved if Martin had been obsessed with, and wanted to re-enact Grease or Kazaam.Thankfully the film isn't paced like a television commercial, and takes it's time to tell the story.  Mostly it consists of Martin's scenes at home with his mother and the numerous sequences where he rounds up his victims from the parking garage.  He even manages to lure the lead actress from the first Human Centipede movie, though that whole scenario is rather hard to believe that it could happen that way.  The last half hour of the movie takes place entirely in Martin's rented warehouse where he performs the ""surgery"", brings his ""centipede"" to life and has it re-enact highlights from the first movie.  This particular ""centipede"" proves to be a bit more rebellious and uncooperative than the one in the first film.  And as you can imagine, this all can't end to well for everyone.Though more artsy than the first film, Six somehow makes this one all the more schlocky and exploitative.  He pulled out all the stops as far as the centipede's construction goes.  For the first time around, you actually had to use your imagination as far as the surgery and it's effects were concerned.  Not now!  Now we're shown the teeth pulled out(or knocked out with a hammer more precisely), the butt cheeks sliced off, the knees and tendons slashed, the mouths stapled, and of course.....the pooping!  Had to including the pooping to keep it all from treading into any kind of tasteful territory.  You see, Martin's no doctor, so the surgery is rather crude.  If the doctor's surgery in the first film is like Bob Vila building a shed, then Martin's surgery is like myself building the same shed.....and that's bad.  Sloppy, completely uncoordinated and just plain bad.For me, it was hard to really feel anything watching this, if feeling anything was really the intention.  There isn't one likeable character in this film, not one.  Anyone with any speaking lines is just a despicable human being, and most of the poor victims aren't given much to do other than lie, bound, gagged, squirming on the warehouse floor.  It's unfortunate, but in a day and age when any film that qualifies as ""horror"" includes characters who are incapacitated, screaming and tortured, it's all rather desensitizing.  Sad but true, in the words of Metallica.I guess I'm still kinda unsure of what Six was trying to accomplish here exactly.  A message about media and violence with the whole movie within a movie thing?  A deranged character study?  A grossout?  Shock?  Horror?  A middle finger aimed at critics of the first film?  Humorous, dark schlock(I don't know if it was supposed to be funny, but a gruesome scene with a baby actually made me laugh at how outrageous and Troma-like it was)?  Hell, I don't know.  But I do know that people are gonna take this movie in a variety of different ways and take different things away from it.  I suppose that's kind of the point, eh?Well, with that said, view at your own risk, though I'd discourage watching it on a first date.I don't think I'll purchase this movie, or even watch it again any time soon, but for whatever reason, I did enjoy it....much more than the first one.",4,"The Lovechild Of David Cronenberg, John Waters, David Lynch And Lloyd Kaufman",1334966400,"04 21,

The entire movie is in black and white-Which is great for Centipede's because they can't see very many colors.2. The main character never talk's-Which is good because centipedes can't understand English.3. There is almost no story-centipede's wouldn't understand a story.4. There is a lot of sick human torture exceeding anything that a human can stand-Let's face it we human's kill and destroy centipedes home's all the time, they love watching humans suffer.5. Human centipede-Have you ever dressed a dog up like a person? Isn't that funny? Well centipedes think the same way, it's funny.6. The main character love's baby's-Centipedes are known for being good parents (for bugs anyway). So they can relate to the protagonist better.7. A centipede beat's people up!-A real centipede in the movie bits someone's face and then attacks someone from inside their(never mind I don't want that memory back). They love it!So to sum up the review if you're a Centipede you'll love this movie. But if you're a Human however you'll hate every minute of it.

Because of his obsession he decides to start kidnapping people in order to create his own human centipede.  At first I felt that the actor portraying the crazed fan was perfect for the part.  He was weird and creepy looking.  But that only lasted so long, as the man could barely move.  It made the whole scenario seem extremely implausible.  I mean how was he supposed to carry all of those people, some almost as big as him, when he could barely bend over.  Then, after all of the victims were captured, while only being restrained by rope, all of the victims just laid on the ground and waited for the sicko to tap them on the head with a wrench, which instantly knocked them out.  I know if I was in that room, I&#8217;d be flailing all around trying to break loose, or at the minimum trying to dodge the blows.  Poor job in those regards.  To me this movie just seemed like a ploy to capitalize on the success of the first movie&#8212;and failed in the process.  Where there was actually somewhat of a plot in the first movie, this one was simply all about the gore, and seemed as if it was just trying to outdo the first film.
