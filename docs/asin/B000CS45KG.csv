The only problem is that I cannot hear the background music on this DVD as well as I can in her 3 mile walk DVD also a great one.  This is not a problem though because Leslie keeps you in tune with the beat.  I would recommend this DVD to anysone.,5,Walk Away Pounds,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,358,"['Excellent', 'maintaining', 'good', 'health', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'funny', 'know', 'good', 'walking', 'practices', 'only', 'problem', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'background', 'music', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'can', '3', 'mile', 'walk', 'DVD', 'also', 'great', 'one', 'not', 'problem', 'Leslie', 'tune', 'beat', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anysone']",N/A
962047,A13700AF4X40YG,B000CS45KG,Loves Books in MD,"[4, 5]","This is a workout consisting of 30 minutes of low impact walking of increasing speed with a few simple moves mixed in.  I'd been hearing about the walking workouts and couldn't imagine how you'd do this at home, so I had to see what it was about.It was easy to follow, although there were a few spots where Leslie Sansone didn't tell you what you were supposed to do until you were supposed to have started or where she'd get her counting a little mixed up.  She comes across as a little ditsy or forced, but there was one section where she made me laugh.  The time went by fairly quickly, especially considering you're basically walking in place in your own home.I didn't find the workout very intense, but I did break a slight sweat.  I will probably keep this in my workout library for light days and as a bit of variety from the typical workouts I use regularly, which are The Firm, Tae Bo/Billy Blanks, Richard Simmons, Kathy Smith, Tamilee Webb and The Biggest Loser.  I exercise at least 5-6 days a week and find having a variety of workouts and trainers to help prevent boredom.I wouldn't recommend this for intermediate or advanced exercisers except for a light or low intensity workout, as I can't say I really felt all that worked out - yet I can't debate I did walk 2 miles in the 30 minutes.  While the simplicity is and can be welcome on some days, I think frequent/regular use of this type of workout would possibly get boring.  Yet is a nice change of pace from the workouts with complicated footwork or even moves that have a learning curve to master.I would think beginning exercisers would especially benefit from this workout.  You're unlikely to get injured using this 2 mile walk workout and you can use it in any weather.",4,Simple to Follow Low Impact Workout,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,1744,"['workout', 'consisting', '30', 'minutes', 'low', 'impact', 'walking', 'increasing', 'speed', 'few', 'simple', 'moves', 'mixed', ""'d"", 'been', 'hearing', 'walking', 'workouts', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', ""'d"", 'do', 'home', 'had', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'about.It', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'were', 'few', 'spots', 'where', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'were', 'supposed', 'do', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'started', 'where', ""'d"", 'get', 'counting', 'little', 'mixed', 'up', 'across', 'little', 'ditsy', 'forced', 'there', 'was', 'one', 'section', 'where', 'made', 'laugh', 'time', 'went', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'especially', 'considering', ""'re"", 'basically', 'walking', 'place', 'own', 'home.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'workout', 'very', 'intense', 'did', 'break', 'slight', 'sweat', 'will', 'probably', 'keep', 'workout', 'library', 'light', 'days', 'bit', 'variety', 'typical', 'workouts', 'use', 'regularly', 'are', 'Firm', 'Tae', 'Bo/Billy', 'Blanks', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'Tamilee', 'Webb', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'exercise', 'least', '5-6', 'days', 'week', 'find', 'having', 'variety', 'workouts', 'trainers', 'help', 'prevent', 'boredom.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'light', 'low', 'intensity', 'workout', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'really', 'felt', 'worked', 'out', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'debate', 'did', 'walk', '2', 'miles', '30', 'minutes', 'simplicity', 'can', 'be', 'welcome', 'days', 'think', 'frequent/regular', 'use', 'type', 'workout', 'would', 'possibly', 'get', 'boring', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'workouts', 'complicated', 'footwork', 'even', 'moves', 'have', 'learning', 'curve', 'master.I', 'would', 'think', 'beginning', 'exercisers', 'would', 'especially', 'benefit', 'workout', ""'re"", 'unlikely', 'get', 'injured', 'using', '2', 'mile', 'walk', 'workout', 'can', 'use', 'weather']",N/A

You see all the basic steps, plus a couple new ones that Leslie throws in towards the end of the routine, not hard to pick up.I like this workout, though it's not a favorite from Leslie, the cueing could be a little better.  As other reviewers have stated, sometimes a move isn't called until right when it starts.  Leslie is quite chatty in this one and perhaps gets distracted a little bit, and therefore cues late.  Not a huge deal, it's pretty simple to get back on the right foot.  It is still a fun routine, and I like the music in this workout, though sometimes it's hard to hear it.I still recommend this though, it's the perfect length, I use this before or after weights, or sometimes on it's own.  I am very grateful to have found these workouts, they have gotten me back on the road to fitness.Overall, I give this one 4 stars.
