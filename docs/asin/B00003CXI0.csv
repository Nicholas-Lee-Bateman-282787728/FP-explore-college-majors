It captivated all of us!Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that he is the son of 2 wizards and has powers of his own.  Harry sets off for Hogwart's, a school where young witches and wizards learn witchcraft and wizardry.  There he meets and befriends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson).  The three of them are great together!  We watch their adventures as the 3 of them learn different spells and how to use their wands and broomsticks.  Some of the rest of the cast; Alan Rickman as Snape, the Potions Master, the late Richard Harris as Dumbledoor, the Dean of the school, Maggie Smith as Macgonagall, and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, the friendly, giant like, lover of strange animals who also befriends the kids.Harry learns how his parents died and then faces the very evil Valdemort, who tried to kill Harry when he was a baby, leaving a scar on his forehead.  Harry and his friends keep the Sorcerer's Stone safe from evil and the ride along the way is brilliantly done with special effects!  There is one VERY real game of chess played - magnificently orchestrated and will keep you on the edge of your seat!I don't want to give it all away!  This is an excellent movie for kids and adults alike!  I recommend it fully!1smileycat :-)",5,Excellent!,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,1355,"['then', '4', '5', 'yr', 'old', 'girls', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'TV', 'one', 'day', 'watched', 'intently', 'end', 'captivated', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'son', '2', 'wizards', 'powers', 'own', 'Harry', 'off', 'Hogwart', 'school', 'where', 'young', 'witches', 'wizards', 'learn', 'witchcraft', 'wizardry', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermoine', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'three', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'watch', 'adventures', '3', 'learn', 'different', 'spells', 'how', 'use', 'wands', 'broomsticks', 'rest', 'cast', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'Potions', 'Master', 'late', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Dumbledoor', 'Dean', 'school', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Macgonagall', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Hagrid', 'friendly', 'giant', 'lover', 'strange', 'animals', 'who', 'also', 'kids.Harry', 'how', 'parents', 'died', 'then', 'very', 'evil', 'Valdemort', 'who', 'tried', 'kill', 'Harry', 'when', 'was', 'baby', 'leaving', 'scar', 'forehead', 'Harry', 'friends', 'keep', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'safe', 'evil', 'ride', 'way', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'VERY', 'real', 'game', 'chess', 'played', 'magnificently', 'orchestrated', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'excellent', 'movie', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'recommend', 'fully', '1smileycat']",N/A

I found the casting to be very good, although Emma Watson as Hermione is too pretty. The story was amazingly faithful to the book, which is very unusual for any book/ movie adaptation with just a few things edited out or rearranged (I believe Hagrid's gift of the photo album to Harry was a Christmas present, not a going home from school gift). It was certainly close enough that a movie viewer could probably get away with claiming to have read the book. I found the 2nd disc to be infuriatingly difficult to get through, most kids won't like to try that stuff.

A fantasy story about child magicians?  Pish posh, I'm more into books on the level of Tolkien, I thought to myself oh-so-proudly.  I'm a decade too old to read children's fiction, I also thought to myself.When the movie came out, I was one of the ones who didn't feel the slightest inkling to go see it.But while I browsed through the shelves of the local video store looking for a light movie to watch, I decided to give Harry Potter a try.I was impressed, as was my husband.  Halfway through the video we were cheering Harry on and were absolutely glued to the screen.  The next day we went to the video store, this time to buy the DVD.I was pleasantly surprised at how a story, geared for children, could hold and capture my attention.  It was absolutely delightful.  I think ""delightful"" is the best word to describe this movie.  The special effects don't detract from the plot, but help to further move it along.  The effects do their job and suck you into the world of Harry Potter.  This is truly a rare kind of movie, the kind that adults and children alike can enjoy watching together.  There is nothing too deep that children can't understand and there is nothing trite or painfully childish that adults will get bored of.  The thought and imagination that went into the story is brilliant.The innocence of this film is something children will appeal to and adults can appreciate.  People of all ages will find entertainment in this film.Watching this film was a lovely experience for me.  I relived sparks of childhood wonder I felt years ago from reading and watching books and films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

This is loaded, I mean, loaded with extras. You can have a 3D tour of Hogwards, Hagrid's home, and you get to cast spells, and much, much more. One of the best things about this disk is that if you want to see the 7 deleted scenes, you have to work for them. You have to find some keys, get your money, get your wand, go to school, and do spells.

Then a giant shows up to take him away to a new school and promised happiness (the daydreams of many young teenagers?). This film shows 'Warthogs' as another English Public School, but one that trains wizards instead of future civil servants and management (a parody?). The special effects used here are more advanced than &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Would this work be successful without these tricks? Do children benefit from this fantasy or other ersatz fairy tales? Are they a juvenile version of Romance novels?The teacher of &quot;Potions&quot; promises the skill of changing people's minds. Is this a parody of Advertising or Public Relations? The Flying lesson shows interpersonality conflicts, and how disobedience creates a problem for one student. The appearance of the threatening troll creates a diversion (a symbol for &quot;townies&quot;?). The special effects are best in the game of quiddich, much better than in the much older &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Harry captures the gold flying ball and wins the game. [Was the fix in?] The Cloak of Invisibility reminds me of &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (which warned against experimenting with drugs). There is a magic mirror which shows people what they want; the old white-bearded wizard correctly warns against indulging in fantasy! When Harry is threatened in the Dark Forest, a centaur shows up to save him, and warns him to stay away (certain places are not safe for teenagers even if they have magic powers). Harry and his friends learn of a plot to steal the Sorcerer's Stone! This can change lead into gold, and give eternal life (not the same thing as eternal youth!).The chess game with life-size figures is another diversion. Finally the real villain is found; Harry discovers you can't judge by appearances. The villain is killed by the unsuspected magic of Harry.

525329,A34VV92TSLC37R,B00003CXI0,Adam Craig,"[4, 5]","I first watched this movie about 3 years ago when it premiered on HBO.  I never read the books,  so I didn't really have a reason to go see it in theaters, and I didn't even want to see it enough to go out and rent it once it was on video.  So, one Saturday night when I had nothing better to do, I sat down and watched this movie, and I didn't really like it that much.  I thought it was a little too long, and the plot wasn't really that solid throughout the movie.However, after reading the novel, and now watching it again (after purchasing it), I must say that I have a newfound appreciation for the quality of this film, and the amazing job it does of realizing Harry Potter's world.  The casting is pretty much perfect.  For being first time actors, all the kids are well-spoken, and very believable.  Richard Harris makes a perfect Dumbledore.  But the best casting job was Alan Rickman to play Professor Snape.  Rickman just has the perfect look and body language that I imagined Snape to be like while reading the book.  He gives off a very evil vibe.I was able to forgive what I thought were the film's shortcomings on the second viewing because I now understood that the filmmakers were trying to be as faithful to the book as possible.  The truth is, the story about the Sorcerer's Stone was really a secondary plot in the book, too.  The main point is Harry and his experience at Hogwart's, and now I can see that in the film, as well.  Also, the length is now forgivable, because I felt like it was just long enough to include everything from the book that needed to be included, but still keep it at a manageable runtime, where people who hadn't read the books could still be interested.I never thought I'd be saying this about myself, but I know that I'll be at a midnight screening when Order of the Phoenix comes out.",5,Faithful adaptation,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,1836,"['first', 'watched', 'movie', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'premiered', 'HBO', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'reason', 'go', 'see', 'theaters', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'see', 'enough', 'go', 'out', 'rent', 'was', 'video', 'So', 'one', 'Saturday', 'night', 'when', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'that', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'solid', 'movie.However', 'reading', 'novel', 'now', 'watching', 'again', 'purchasing', 'must', 'say', 'have', 'newfound', 'appreciation', 'quality', 'film', 'amazing', 'job', 'realizing', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'world', 'casting', 'pretty', 'much', 'perfect', 'being', 'first', 'time', 'actors', 'kids', 'are', 'well-spoken', 'very', 'believable', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'perfect', 'Dumbledore', 'best', 'casting', 'job', 'was', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'play', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'Rickman', 'just', 'perfect', 'look', 'body', 'language', 'imagined', 'Snape', 'be', 'reading', 'book', 'off', 'very', 'evil', 'vibe.I', 'was', 'able', 'forgive', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'second', 'viewing', 'now', 'understood', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'be', 'as', 'faithful', 'book', 'possible', 'truth', 'story', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'was', 'really', 'secondary', 'plot', 'book', 'too', 'main', 'point', 'Harry', 'experience', 'Hogwart', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Also', 'length', 'now', 'forgivable', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'include', 'everything', 'book', 'needed', 'be', 'included', 'still', 'keep', 'manageable', 'runtime', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'interested.I', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'saying', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'midnight', 'screening', 'when', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'out']",N/A

And I was eager to see what I had imagined on a big screen. For the most part, I was not disappointed.Chris Columbus -- of Home Alone fame -- directs an all-star cast of British greats, mixed with a load of cute kids who, though not perfect, are creditable in sharing their awe and excitement at the magical world unfolding before them. I especially enjoyed Maggie Smith as one of Harry's teachers at Hogwarts, a part that is anti-thetical to her role the same year in Gosford Park. It is fun to watch seasoned, serious Brits acting in roles less serious and stiff than their norm.What makes this film quite good is how well it was imagined. I am glad that the movie stays faithful to the book. What was in the book is what I wanted to see. Being able to WATCH a Quiddich match is itself worth the purchase price. Likewise for the life-sized-plus chess board. The visuals in the film are invigorating for someone who has read the book and dreamed about how these things would look.The movie's weakness, albeit minor, is the same as its strength. It moves rapidly from one important scene to the next. So much happens so quickly that if one is not familiar with the book and the extensive background it provides, there is a great chance he or she will not ""get"" this movie. For those who already know the story, the movie shows all the parts we wanted to see without spending much time explaining what is going on in Harry's head or flashing back to the past.Finally, I am still flabbergasted that people consider it necessarily to condemn this movie from a religious perspective.

What's not to like?In fact, even watching the movie, I had difficulty finding the flaws. Most of the scenes worked quite well. A violent chess match towards the end of the film was probably the best moment of the film. And none of the acting is really at fault. Richard Harris, how we will miss you, come the third film (note: Harris, who died recently, played Professor Dumbledore). However, although the parts have no major flaws, (forgive the clech&eacute;) sometimes the whole is less then the sum of the parts: for whatever reason, the Sorcerer's Stone is flawed.If I were to hazzard a guess, I'd say the editing is to blame. The movie seems badly paced, with too much time before school starts, cramming the rest of the plot into too small a time period. And some information is given in a far more forced way then it is in the book. There are a few other facets that could have use some major improvements.However, Chris Coloumbus may do right by the second book.

The story is about a boy named Harry Potter[Daniel Radcliffe] who lives with his evil step-parents, the Dursleys. Untill, one day he gets a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry since he is a wizard even though he doesn't know it. The whole story talks about how he finds out about the Sorcerer's stone which is a stone that can make anyone immortal.I thought that the movie was good except some parts weren't in the movie that were in the book, but there were very few. This is not one of the best movies in the world but it is still funto watch at times. I thought that all of the books were good but my only complaint was that sometimes the plot got a little confusing. The only person I recognize from the making of this movie was Chris Columbus.

525340,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,B00003CXI0,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[1, 2]","You have to have a heart of stone - or be a Dursley - to NOT like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I say this not from the perspective of a child, nor the parent of a child, nor even a voracious reader of the J.K. Rowling novels about the boy with glasses and that lightning-shaped star.  Indeed, I only have the first of the five books and that, dear readers, only because my former neighbor and computer troubleshooter gave it to me before he moved to South Carolina.  My taste in movies rarely goes into the realm of ""family fare,"" even though some of my favorite films (E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Star Wars series, among others)  are geared for young and old alike.I must also admit that I only started reading Harry Potter when I had just about gone through most of my Tom Clancy novels, Star Wars tomes, and history books.  I was not sure if I would like it as much as I do, say, Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Ms. Rowling's tale is appealing not only to the young but to the young-at-heart.The 2001 film version, adapted by Steve Kloves and directed by Chris (Gremlins) Columbus, is an above-average family film.  While warm and whimsical in places, Rowling's tale is not exactly all syrupy and bright, either.  For the story of Harry Potter, wizard in training, is also a story which deals with fate, losses, fear, courage, friendship, and the struggle between the forces of light and darkness.Sorcerer's Stone follows the plot of its source novel faithfully (some have said ""too faithfully""): an orphaned Harry Potter is left to be cared by his maternal aunt Petunia and her husband Vernon, the terrible Dursleys, after his parents' tragic demise at the hands of Lord Voldemort, a dark and deadly wizard.  For most of his 12 years, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs.  When strange things start happening on his cousin Dudley's birthday outing and owls start flooding the house on Privet Drive with letters from Hogwart's School of Wizardry, the Dursleys try to hide Harry in a remote shack out in the boonies.  But Harry's destiny is not to be denied, and he is whisked away by Hogwart's trusted groundskeeper Hagrid.Kloves and Columbus recreate Rowling's novel almost perfectly, catching all the nuances and details just right.  Though this makes for a running time of 152 minutes, Sorcerer's Stone never drags or brings on snores...at least not for older kids and young-hearted adults.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grant and Emma Watson are excellent in their roles as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger; their camaraderie and pluck is convincing, and the supporting cast, which includes John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, is an exciting and talented ensemble.  Adding his usual musical magic to Harry's adventures is none other than composer/conductor John Williams, whose soaring themes and gentle underscores give extra excitement to the Quidditch match and dark menace to those dark passages within the walls of Hogwarts.The  Special Widescreen Edition DVD consists of one disc that contains the film itself (with English and Spanish audio tracks, plus subtitles in both languages) and a few extra features, plus a second disc with DVD-ROM features, games, puzzles, interviews, and links to the Web.The sound and picture are excellent, and the movie itself seems destined to be a family classic along the lines of The Wizard of Oz and the great films of Walt Disney.",5,Harry Goes To Hogwarts!,1057190400,"07 3, 2003",2003,3559,"['have', 'have', 'heart', 'stone', 'be', 'Dursley', 'NOT', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone.I', 'say', 'not', 'perspective', 'child', 'parent', 'child', 'even', 'voracious', 'reader', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'novels', 'boy', 'glasses', 'lightning-shaped', 'star', 'Indeed', 'only', 'have', 'first', 'five', 'books', 'dear', 'readers', 'only', 'former', 'neighbor', 'computer', 'troubleshooter', 'gave', 'moved', 'South', 'Carolina', 'taste', 'movies', 'rarely', 'realm', 'family', 'fare', 'even', 'favorite', 'films', 'E.T.', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'Star', 'Wars', 'series', 'others', 'are', 'geared', 'young', 'old', 'alike.I', 'must', 'also', 'admit', 'only', 'started', 'reading', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'when', 'had', 'just', 'gone', 'most', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'Star', 'Wars', 'history', 'books', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'say', 'Tolkien', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'However', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'Ms.', 'Rowling', 'tale', 'appealing', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'young-at-heart.The', '2001', 'film', 'version', 'adapted', 'Steve', 'Kloves', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Gremlins', 'Columbus', 'above-average', 'family', 'film', 'warm', 'whimsical', 'places', 'Rowling', 'tale', 'not', 'exactly', 'syrupy', 'bright', 'either', 'story', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'wizard', 'training', 'also', 'story', 'fate', 'losses', 'fear', 'courage', 'friendship', 'struggle', 'forces', 'light', 'darkness.Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'plot', 'source', 'novel', 'faithfully', 'have', 'said', 'too', 'faithfully', 'orphaned', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'left', 'be', 'cared', 'maternal', 'aunt', 'Petunia', 'husband', 'Vernon', 'terrible', 'Dursleys', 'parents', 'tragic', 'demise', 'hands', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'dark', 'deadly', 'wizard', 'most', '12', 'years', 'Harry', 'cupboard', 'stairs', 'When', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'cousin', 'Dudley', 'birthday', 'outing', 'owls', 'start', 'flooding', 'house', 'Privet', 'Drive', 'letters', 'Hogwart', 'School', 'Wizardry', 'Dursleys', 'try', 'hide', 'Harry', 'remote', 'shack', 'boonies', 'Harry', 'destiny', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'whisked', 'away', 'Hogwart', 'trusted', 'groundskeeper', 'Hagrid.Kloves', 'Columbus', 'recreate', 'Rowling', 'novel', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'catching', 'nuances', 'details', 'just', 'right', 'running', 'time', '152', 'minutes', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'never', 'snores', 'least', 'not', 'older', 'kids', 'young-hearted', 'adults', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Rupert', 'Grant', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'camaraderie', 'pluck', 'convincing', 'supporting', 'cast', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'late', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Headmaster', 'Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'exciting', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'Adding', 'usual', 'musical', 'magic', 'Harry', 'adventures', 'none', 'other', 'composer/conductor', 'John', 'Williams', 'soaring', 'themes', 'gentle', 'underscores', 'give', 'extra', 'excitement', 'Quidditch', 'match', 'dark', 'menace', 'dark', 'passages', 'walls', 'Hogwarts.The', 'Special', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'one', 'disc', 'film', 'English', 'Spanish', 'audio', 'tracks', 'subtitles', 'languages', 'few', 'extra', 'features', 'second', 'disc', 'DVD-ROM', 'features', 'games', 'puzzles', 'interviews', 'links', 'Web.The', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'excellent', 'movie', 'destined', 'be', 'family', 'classic', 'lines', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'great', 'films', 'Walt', 'Disney']",N/A

In a world where Playstation and nintendo rules, it's grateful to know that a story so simple and entertain could steal some fans from the tv screen's.

British and Canadian versions have slightly different scenes were the characters say the proper name of the stone.)I have to admit, as I saw the movie I had a big smile on my face. I particularly like Ron &amp; Hermione and Hagrid, although Daniel Radcliffe makes a good Harry. Maybe a little too good. In the book, Harry is not perfect. His mistakes have been sanitized in the film.I found most of the joy I had in watching this film came straight from the book. And overall, the movie is fairly faithful. Maybe a little too much. Peter Jackson's LOTR re-imagined the novel to make it work better on film. At times, the Harry Potter film just seems like a plot summary of the book. Good -- but it doesn't quite sparkle. There is magic in the film, but it is borrowed from JK Rowling's book. LOTR creates its own magic.I also didn't like the Quidditch effect as it seemed confusing and the characters didn't mesh with the background.As for the DVD, it's nice looking. The special features -- well, I've seen discs with a lot more, but there's a good assortment here. Kids might have a lot of fun trying to find the stone and Deleted Scenes.

In the same way, the movie takes you into a delightful version of Harry's world.The adult actors are quite good - all known to be solid performers. Alan Rickman as Snape is perfect, as is Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid. The kids are noticeably new to this (they improve with each successive movie), but fortunately, the roles aren't all that demanding.  The kids play kids.  The three leads playing Harry, Hermione, and Ron are warm and appealing.What limits the movie isn't the bringing a fantasy world to life (the special effects are marvelous), but adhering so closely to a literal interpretation bypasses all those subtle hints of things to come that Rowling slips into all her books. So Malfoy is *only* a bully and Hermione is *only* a brain - there is little texture to their characters.I like the fact that the actors are all British. It makes it feel more authentic and less forced. That being said, it's another thing to look at the scenery. The London scenes and the interiors of Hogwarts looked wonderful.

525363,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B00003CXI0,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[3, 3]","I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--""Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers""--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary ""muggle"" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from

Of course, by that time, why someone like me would have heard something about this 11 year old boy, or maybe about his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger? I was sure getting away from something I couldn't skip, and that is the much-hyped media phenomenom Harry Potter.After being harrassed by my own sister and bored as hell in one rainy day, I finally decided to read the first pages of this book called ""The Sorcerer's Stone"", the first of four books available at the moment. I was caught by the magic of the book and read it within two days. I couldn't stop looking at it! it was like an obsession, thiking 24/7 about what would that package at Gringotts have inside and things like that. It was then when I started to follow the new trend, the Harry Potter one.It was finally time to go and watch the movie at the theater. After a superlong line, I got the enter the theater and I could watch the most faithful adaptation of the book to the screen that could have been done. The movie itself is a really well-done picture, where all the characters look exactly as you pictured them when you read the book and re-created the scenes in your mind...you could have swore someone read your mind and put what you thought on film!!Although the movie has countless magnificent special effects, and some breath-taking scenes such as the impopular Quidditch match, I definetely prefer the book, which in my opinion is 10x better then the movie.

525370,A26O6MQFA36WBK,B00003CXI0,A Reviewer,"[1, 2]","I left this movie when I first saw it thinking of how it was a ""not bad"" movie. Many of the parts of the book have been completely eliminated. The action night adventure entitled ""The Midnight Duel"" in the book was completely eliminated, and actually ruins the whole point of them being afraid of Filch. The scene with them rescuing the dragon was also completely eliminated. The scene in the Forbidden Forest was also  shortened. Basically, once Harry reaches Hogwarts, there are very few BIG action scenes until the end. (I'll also add that that has less action than in the book.) Nothing has been done to the action scenes to make them acceptable movie action scenes. Many of the effects are completely unbelieveable. It is almost impossible to look at that Centaur, Voldemort, or that Quidditch match and not notice how fake everything looks. Nobody acting in this movie was doing their best, espechily Harris, who's performance lacked any of the humor described in the book, but I guess the director is more to blame for that. Columbus does such a better job in Chamber that this movie looks like a complete joke in comparrison. But it was cool to watch, to see the things come to life, the wizarding world come to life, so 3 stars. I received this DVD for free.

I was so enormously charmend by the fantastic visual effects (they surpass STAR WARS EPISODE II), the screenplay and the wonderful cast. You need not be a fan nor read any of the books to understand what's happening. There are little hints and explanations (for both Children and Adults) that guide you through the film.One reviewer had wrote something like ""The Next Wizard of Oz"", despite it's time and the technicol beauty of ""OZ"" there always seemed something missing from it. POTTER brings it all back.There are a few scenes that maybe a little scary for the little one's and there are some crazy religious fanatics out there that have chastised the film for what they call evil, however, the film is pruely innocent. It demenstrates true friendship, understanding of other people's differences and the beauty of once being a child.You really must see this film.As for the DVD, it could be a little better on the second disc. The menus are quite annoying and I still can't seem to find the ""deleted scenes"". The talent bios could have been detailed and it's really not necessary to make supplemental material somewhat of a game.The sound and transfer on the other hand is magnificant, colors are vivid and the soundtrack shines!

525372,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B00003CXI0,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[3, 3]","Okay, I admit it, I got the Harry Potter film.  No kids in the family except me, my husband and a Great Dane, but that's kids enough.  Although I was rather disappointed with the film when I saw it in the theater, I decided to purchase it anyway.  For some reason, it's a better TV sized product than it was a large screen film.  Chris Columbus has directed a number of kid type movies, including Home Alone,  Mrs. Doubtfire, and Stepmom, but I think his concept of kids and family, although wacky enough, is not quite sinister enough to put the bite into the Harry Potter stories that exists in the books.  Harry deals with some pretty heavy duty facts of life, including the death--which he later discovers was murder--of his parents, the active dislike and abuse of his caretakers, the dislocation of going away to a school where he knows no one and must discover for himself whom to trust, and so on.  Although arrayed in the majesty and mystery of an ancient and occult world, Hogwarts becomes home and family to Harry.  It is, however, not a home and family free of conflict and danger, as Harry soon discovers.  Columbus follows the book closely,  almost slavishly, but little of that sense of suspense and threat seems to exist despite a lavish set and wonderful performances by all of the cast.  One almost has a feel of ""holding back"" on the part of the director, as though children can't handle the grit of a truly ""scary"" movie.  I mean, get real.  Like who went/goes to all those monster movies that have been shown at Saturday matinees for generations!  I know a six year old whose favorite film is Jurassic Park.  There were several episodes that could have scared the socks off of us, but although they were wonderful visually, they were a great disappointment as a scary experience.  Maybe it's just that ones imagination can create scarier monsters than the screen can, but I doubt it.  There's always Alien to disprove that theory!  I had heard that Steven Spielberg had requested to make the film.  I can't help but think that someone who gave us both Jaws and ET could have given us a better, more intense and more meaningful film.  The movie as it is does better on a smaller screen, however.  Maybe it's just that we've come to expect less from a made for TV movie.

525375,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00003CXI0,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","I didn't review the Potter movies when I first got them, because they were at the height of their popularity, and I figured everyone already knew as much as they wanted to about them.Having seen the later ones, it's refreshing to go back and see our favorites, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) looking so young and innocent. And downright cute! They are supposed to be 11 years old, and I think they were about that, but they seem so incredibly young.This is also one that has Richard Harris as Dumbledore. I loved him as Dumbledore. Did he do just one movie or two? [Two.]Anyway, the story is very well known by now. Harry was one year old when the evil wizard Voldemort (""He Who Must Not Be Named"") killed his parents but failed to kill him, leaving him with a lightening-shaped scar on his forehead instead. Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the only person You-Know-Who ever feared, decides to place the orphaned Harry with his aunt and her husband, the ""worst kind of muggles,"" the Dursleys.Sure enough, they are indeed pretty impossible people. Their piggish son Dudley is spoiled completely rotten, Uncle Vernon is an ass and heartless toward Harry, and Aunt Petunia has always thought of her witch sister, Harry's mother Lily, as a freak. They never told Harry about his parents, but instead claimed they had been killed in a car accident.But on Harry's 11th birthday, he receives mail addressed to him from Hogwarts which Uncle Vernon destroys before he can read it. Finally, Rubeus Hagrid, keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts, shows up to take Harry to get ready for his first year, and off they go to London, to Diagon Alley. From there, Harry rides the Hogwarts Express, where he meets Ron and Hermione.The plot is complex and detailed, despite it having been simplified considerably from what the book includes. Much of the charm is the setting of Hogwarts itself, an ancient castle with wonderful magical properties, including all sorts of charming special effects.Without going into too much detail, Harry is chosen as the youngest seeker on the Quidditch team (a sport played on broomsticks that slightly resembles basketball, hockey, and several other team sports that chase balls), and of course is brilliant in it. But the movie only includes one game, although there are several in the book. Just as well, I say; I'm not a sports fan.The sorcerer's stone in the title is what traditional alchemy calls the philosopher's stone. It has many magical powers, including the ability to formulate an elixir of life that grants immortality. The story of the stone, how it is guarded at Hogwarts, who is trying to steal it, and what Harry, Ron and Hermione have to do to foil the plot, is the basis of the story I won't spoil for those who have not yet seen it. Since it's perfectly obvious, I don't suppose there's any harm in saying they succeed.There are terrific special effects in this movie, my favorite being a bigger than life wizard chess set. Wizard chess is played just like Muggle chess, except that the pieces are enchanted and smash each other instead of merely capturing. Fortunately, Ron is good at chess, or all would have been lost. He plays a knight, Harry a bishop, and Hermione a rook/castle. When Harry successfully checkmates, the king throws down his sword.I've seen the movie about as often as I've read the book, which is quite a few times each. I used to chafe at the number of elements that were in the book but left out of the movie, or shortened to the point of being barely mentioned. But I have long since accepted that these are two different media, and have different needs. The books are excellent books, and the movies are excellent movies. They don't need to match.I give the whole series five stars.",5,I Loved the Entire Series,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3855,"['did', ""n't"", 'review', 'Potter', 'movies', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'were', 'height', 'popularity', 'figured', 'everyone', 'already', 'knew', 'as', 'much', 'wanted', 'them.Having', 'seen', 'later', 'ones', 'refreshing', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'favorites', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'looking', 'so', 'young', 'innocent', 'downright', 'cute', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', '11', 'years', 'old', 'think', 'were', 'seem', 'so', 'incredibly', 'young.This', 'also', 'one', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Dumbledore', 'loved', 'Dumbledore', 'Did', 'do', 'just', 'one', 'movie', 'two', '[', 'Two', ']', 'Anyway', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'now', 'Harry', 'was', 'one', 'year', 'old', 'when', 'evil', 'wizard', 'Voldemort', 'Who', 'Must', 'Not', 'Be', 'Named', 'killed', 'parents', 'failed', 'kill', 'leaving', 'lightening-shaped', 'scar', 'forehead', 'instead', 'Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'headmaster', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardry', 'only', 'person', 'You-Know-Who', 'ever', 'feared', 'place', 'orphaned', 'Harry', 'aunt', 'husband', 'worst', 'kind', 'muggles', 'Dursleys.Sure', 'enough', 'are', 'indeed', 'pretty', 'impossible', 'people', 'piggish', 'son', 'Dudley', 'spoiled', 'completely', 'rotten', 'Uncle', 'Vernon', 'ass', 'heartless', 'Harry', 'Aunt', 'Petunia', 'always', 'thought', 'witch', 'sister', 'Harry', 'mother', 'Lily', 'freak', 'never', 'told', 'Harry', 'parents', 'instead', 'claimed', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'car', 'accident.But', 'Harry', '11th', 'birthday', 'mail', 'addressed', 'Hogwarts', 'Uncle', 'Vernon', 'can', 'read', 'Finally', 'Rubeus', 'Hagrid', 'keeper', 'keys', 'grounds', 'Hogwarts', 'up', 'take', 'Harry', 'get', 'ready', 'first', 'year', 'go', 'London', 'Diagon', 'Alley', 'there', 'Harry', 'Hogwarts', 'Express', 'where', 'Ron', 'Hermione.The', 'plot', 'complex', 'detailed', 'having', 'been', 'simplified', 'considerably', 'what', 'book', 'Much', 'charm', 'setting', 'Hogwarts', 'ancient', 'castle', 'wonderful', 'magical', 'properties', 'including', 'sorts', 'charming', 'special', 'effects.Without', 'going', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'Harry', 'chosen', 'youngest', 'seeker', 'Quidditch', 'team', 'sport', 'played', 'broomsticks', 'slightly', 'basketball', 'hockey', 'several', 'other', 'team', 'sports', 'chase', 'balls', 'course', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'game', 'are', 'several', 'book', 'Just', 'as', 'well', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'sports', 'fan.The', 'sorcerer', 'stone', 'title', 'what', 'traditional', 'alchemy', 'philosopher', 'stone', 'many', 'magical', 'powers', 'including', 'ability', 'formulate', 'elixir', 'life', 'grants', 'immortality', 'story', 'stone', 'how', 'guarded', 'Hogwarts', 'who', 'trying', 'steal', 'what', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'have', 'do', 'foil', 'plot', 'basis', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'perfectly', 'obvious', 'do', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'harm', 'saying', 'are', 'terrific', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'favorite', 'being', 'bigger', 'life', 'wizard', 'chess', 'set', 'Wizard', 'chess', 'played', 'just', 'Muggle', 'chess', 'pieces', 'are', 'enchanted', 'smash', 'other', 'instead', 'merely', 'capturing', 'Fortunately', 'Ron', 'good', 'chess', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'knight', 'Harry', 'bishop', 'Hermione', 'rook/castle', 'When', 'Harry', 'successfully', 'king', 'down', 'sword.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'as', 'often', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'used', 'chafe', 'number', 'elements', 'were', 'book', 'left', 'movie', 'shortened', 'point', 'being', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'have', 'long', 'accepted', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'media', 'have', 'different', 'needs', 'books', 'are', 'excellent', 'books', 'movies', 'are', 'excellent', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'match.I', 'give', 'whole', 'series', 'five', 'stars']",N/A
525376,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00003CXI0,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[5, 6]","Approaching this film as an entity separate and apart from its fabulous reputation as the first in a series of books that have broken all records for children's literature, one must still stand in awe at the finished work in terms of its storyline, special effects, and splendid performance by an ensemble cast that transforms the beautifully articulated words from the books' author to a literal vision capable of transporting the viewer into the magical world of Harry Potter.  While I have read the books, I must admit to being less of a fan of them than many, for reasons I won't belabor here. Yet even I have to admit that this film constitutes a wonderful object lesson that the supernatural world of youthful magician's apprentices can in fact be faithfully and artfully depicted by a director who also happens to be singularly capable of envisioning the world of special effects and wonder described in the novels. This is great stuff! And as far as entertainment goes, this is an overwhelming success.From the depiction of Harry Potter himself and his own native sense of wonder and mischief, to the motley crew of sidekicks, assorted hangers-on, and fellow craftsmen to be, the movie works as a vehicle for exploring the alternative world of possibilities such activities portend. From beginning to end, this is a kind of busman's tour of the world of the Brother Grimm turned upside down, falling over into wild adventures and merry childlike fantasies. None of it is substantial, however, and while I can readily applaud the skill and craft that went into making such a faithful production of this first of many novels about Harry Potter, I would also like to mention that this is all really just frosting, none of it very educational or useful for anything other than entertainment. And while the reading of the books at least fosters an appreciation for the possibilities of stretching the imagination and reading skills of the reader, the film version does nothing but push forward a solipsistic view of the world as a dominion best left to wizards and hobgoblins to worry about.  It is a sort of slap-happy fairy tale, but is one that is cleverly disguised as a youthful adventure. Enjoy it as entertainment.

525377,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00003CXI0,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","I have to say right at the get go that I know absolutely nothing about Harry Potter. Zilch. Nada. Never read any of the books or heard anything about them. I had no idea what the blazes a hogwart or muggle was. But, I have to admit that I was a wee bit curious. What was all the fuss about?. I went into this film stone cold and was very surprised. First of all, you don't need to be a Harry encyclopedia. Things are pretty well explained to you. You won't be lost. I was expecting it. Daniel Radcliffe plays 11 year old Harry Potter, who is dropped on his aunt and uncle's doorstep as a baby. Flash forward 11 years later and Harry is living a most miserable life. His relatives are the most horrid bunch. They make Harry sleep under the stairs. Then, Harry begins to get letters from Hogwarts School. A large giant of a man named Hagrid(played by the loveable Robbie Coltrane)comes and tells Harry that he is a wizard and takes him to Hogwarts school for Wizardry. There, Harry befriends Ron(Rupert Gint), and Hermione(exceptionally played by the drop dead adorable Emma Watson). While learning his abilities at the school, Harry and his new friends discover that the sorcerer's stone is hidden under the school and that someone is trying to get to it. Who is it?. Why do they want it?. These are questions you will have to see the movie to find out. The supporting cast is the best of the best. These people include Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and the great Richard Harris. Keep your eyes open for cameos by John Cleese, John Hurt, and Julie Walters. They are all teriffic. Next up is the score. You can always count on John Williams to deliver the goods. He is a god. His musical score really catches that right whimsical fairy tale sound that is dead on perfect. Haunting and beautiful at the same time. The outfits were outstanding, as was the scenery and sets. Many sets were absolutely breathtaking. The castle itself is a wonderous piece of beauty in itself. I will say that the movie did seem a tad long. Then again, so are the books. The long running time did hurt it a tad bit. Daniel Radcliffe is exceptionally good as young Harry. He has wonderful charm and a great smile. But, I was in awe of little Emma Watson as Hermione. This young girl is wonderful. A star in the making. Director Chris Columbus(""Home Alone"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"")really knows his stuff. The cast is great and he keeps the film tight and sharp looking. Kudoes to you Mr. Columbus. As for how faithful the movie is from J.K. Rowling's book, I can't say. I haven't read them. But from what I hear from everyone else, the movie was very faithful to the book. Maybe I should read them?. There are a number of whiners commenting on the movie being long and boring. If you are interested in quality than quantity, then this shouldn't be a problem at all. If you have short attention spans and have a hard time staying focused for a three minute video on MTV, then this is not for you. Critics have hailed this film as ""The Wizard Of Oz Of Today"".

Harry is a young boy living in a cabinet under the stairs at his Aunt and Uncle's house when the film begins.

From the moment Hagrid removes Harry from his relatives, an adventure begins that will have you laughing and delighted, no matter what your age. Fantastic special effects and a long journey into the magical world of wizardry combine to make an extra special film for all ages.

Rowling's phenomenally successful children's books is so keen on being faithful to its original source that it loses a bit of its magic but is marvelous entertainment nonetheless (particularly for the kiddies). Harry Potter is a young orphan boy raised by his meany uncle and aunt who one day learns from a gruff giant named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) that he is a wizard, and has been accepted into Hogwart's, a school of sorcery for the magically-abled. Once there he experiences all sorts of adventures with new best friends Ron and Hermione, many of them to the chagrin of the school's kindly headmaster Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and the sharp-as-tacks Professor McGonagall (a wickedly zesty Maggie Smith). Perfect casting all around is a plus, not to mention state-of-the-art visual effects, a boisterous score by John Williams and inspired production design by Academy Award winner Stuart Craig (The Last Emperor, Dangerous Liaisons, The English Patient). Fans of the book will delight in seeing all their favourite aspects of Hogwarts brought to life so accurately, but those less familiar with the world of Harry Potter will lose their patience by the time they get to the anticlimactic last third.

I had heard that it was ""great"" and ""excellent,"" and I wasn't dissapointed. Then, when I heard that a movie was being made out of the bestseller, I hopped right on the fan train and waited anxiously. When I finally saw the movie for the first time, I was blown away by how good it was.Daniel Raddcliffe plays the young wizard Harry Potter, who, due to the death of his parents, has to stay to live with his unbarable aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon and not to mention their freakishly overwieght son Dudley. While on a trip to the zoo on Dudley's birthday, Harry makes a pane of glass dissapear and subsuqently Dudley falls right in.Later on that week, mail starts coming; not just any mail though, the owl post. Letters adressed to ""Mr. H Potter Cupboard Under The Stairs"" start arriving on a frequent basis, until Vernon gets so uspet that he takes the family onto an island shack.While there, at the strok of midnight on Harry's birthday, a great large bangs rash the door of the shack until it falls down and in comes Reubeus Hagrid, keeper of keys and games at Hogwarts. Hogwarts, to those who haven't read any of the books or been under a rock for the last 5 years is ""the greatest school of wizardry and witchcraft and is headed by the finest headmaster...Albus Dumbledore.""  So, ""reluctantly"" Vernon lets Harry go to Hogwarts.Harry doesn't know, though, that he has to get rather odd supplies for school, like a cauldron and a wand. Hadgrid brings him to a bar called the Leaky Cauldron, where everybody inside knows who mister Potter is, which makes him very uncomfortable. Outside though, Harry gets his first glimpse at the wizard shopping mall persay, Diagon Alley. While there, he gets all of his supplies for his first year.Even though he has a time trying to get on to Platfrom 9 3/4 (yes 9 3/4) at Kings Cross Station, he meets who will soon become his best friends: Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasly (Rupert Grint). He also meets his arch-ememy Draco Malfoy.The staff of Hogwarts reads like a whos who of English actors: Richard Harris (Unforgiven) as the wise old Albus Dumbledore, Alan Rickman (Die Hard) plays vindictive Professer Snape, Maggie Smith (Gosford Park) plays the by the book Professer McGonnegal and Robbie Coltrane plays the forementioned Reubeus Hagrid.The highlight of the movie is the Qudditch game. Qudditch is like the wizard hybrid of basketball and soccer, only it has three types of balls and is played on broomsticks.All and all this movie is great fun to watch, and the special features are excellent, expecially the deleated sense.

Well, I guess they would be great if you could figure out how to see them.  I read that it is like a game where you are a student at Hogwarts and need to get all of the things for school prior to going and exploring the grounds to find the deleted scenes.

We watched this together and I was immediately struck by the sound design, which is superior to the previous blu-ray release. The video seems about the same. The extra scenes in the extended edition were interesting and did not take away from the film. In fact, I thought they provided more depth and I found myself enjoying the film more than previous viewings. It's nice that you are given the option of choosing between the two versions of the film. The other added benefit of this ultimate edition release is the documentary. The first part is interesting, but not quite as in depth as I was hoping.

He lives with his nasty foster family until the age of 11 when he is taken away to Hogwarts, a school of wizardry, for training.  It is here that he discovers his true heritage.  Much like at the Boston pub Cheers, everybody knows his name.  Turns out Harry's family has made quite a name for themselves in the land of wizards and witches.  Eventually he and his two new friends - awkward, put-upon Ron Weasley and snotty know-it-all Hermione Grainger - come to believe that one of their professors is up to some shady business, and venture out on their own to uncover the plot.What follows is an overlong, disjointed picture in which we are shown the many wonders of Hogwarts and occasionally, bits of an actual story.  Shifting staircases and talking hats may amuse the younger ones, but I found it all rather tedious.  The thrust of the story itself doesn't have much logic to it; if the sorcerer's stone is so precious and dangerous, why is it removed from the vault and placed in the care of an inept guard dog (and its equally inept master) to begin with?  The surprise villain isn't clever and serves only to trick the viewer.  Again, kids won't care, but adults will shake their heads in exasperation.I liked the critters.  There are numerous owls of various types, a talking boa constrictor, a shape-shifting cat, and briefly, a large iguana.

525403,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B00003CXI0,Bookphile,"[6, 6]","I will always think fondly of this movie because it inspired me to pick up the first Harry Potter book and I've been a rabid fan ever since.  I'm one of those book before movie people so I had to read the novel in order to go see this movie and I was pleased to see that it was such a faithful adaptation to Rowling's wonderful tale.This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the wonder and awe of the first HP novel.  Hogwarts was an especially lovely effect and when Harry first walks into the Great Hall and all the candles are floating overhead, I felt all the magic I felt when reading those words on the page.  I think Columbus and crew captured the essence of the castle and somehow managed to create a visual of something so fantastical.The casting of the movie was also extremely well done.  I adore Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Richard Harris captures the mischievous and wise nature of Dumbledore.  Perhaps best of all the adult casting is that of Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid.  He looks exactly as I pictured the character but, more importantly, he captures Hagrid's rather childlike nature and the accent is wonderful.  Coltrane doesn't just portray Hagrid, he is Hagrid.I also thought the children were wonderfully cast.  Daniel Radcliffe looks like Harry and I fought back tears when his earnest young face first looked into the Mirror of Erised.  Rupert Grint looks just as I pictured Ron Weasley and Emma Watson is wonderfully bossy and a fantastic know-it-all as Hermione Granger.  The casting of the Phelps brothers as the Weasley twins was absolutely brilliant and I think they were dead on in their interpretation of the lovable scoundrels.Yet in spite of its fantastical nature, this film, like the book, feels as though it is something like our own reality.  There are many wonderful things in Harry's world but it's not that different from our own.  The same prejudices and the same human frailties that exist in our world exist in Harry's.  Though being a wizard is pretty darn cool, it's not the answer to Harry's problems and the film makes clear that he has some difficult challenges ahead of him.I think the central theme of this movie is one that is invaluable for both children and adults alike: that love is the most powerful magic that exists.  Even with all the wand waving and fantastical creatures, it is love that is Harry's salvation.",4,A faithful adaptation,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,2372,"['will', 'always', 'think', 'fondly', 'movie', 'inspired', 'pick', 'up', 'first', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rabid', 'fan', 'ever', ""'m"", 'one', 'book', 'movie', 'people', 'so', 'had', 'read', 'novel', 'order', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'was', 'such', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Rowling', 'wonderful', 'tale.This', 'movie', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'capturing', 'wonder', 'awe', 'first', 'HP', 'novel', 'Hogwarts', 'was', 'especially', 'lovely', 'effect', 'when', 'Harry', 'first', 'Great', 'Hall', 'candles', 'are', 'floating', 'overhead', 'felt', 'magic', 'felt', 'when', 'reading', 'words', 'page', 'think', 'Columbus', 'crew', 'captured', 'essence', 'castle', 'somehow', 'managed', 'create', 'visual', 'something', 'so', 'fantastical.The', 'casting', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'adore', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'McGonagall', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'mischievous', 'wise', 'nature', 'Dumbledore', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'adult', 'casting', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Hagrid', 'exactly', 'pictured', 'character', 'more', 'importantly', 'Hagrid', 'rather', 'childlike', 'nature', 'accent', 'wonderful', 'Coltrane', ""n't"", 'just', 'portray', 'Hagrid', 'Hagrid.I', 'also', 'thought', 'children', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Harry', 'fought', 'back', 'tears', 'when', 'earnest', 'young', 'face', 'first', 'looked', 'Mirror', 'Erised', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'just', 'pictured', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'wonderfully', 'bossy', 'fantastic', 'know-it-all', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'casting', 'Phelps', 'brothers', 'Weasley', 'twins', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'think', 'were', 'dead', 'interpretation', 'lovable', 'scoundrels.Yet', 'spite', 'fantastical', 'nature', 'film', 'book', 'feels', 'something', 'own', 'reality', 'are', 'many', 'wonderful', 'things', 'Harry', 'world', 'not', 'different', 'own', 'same', 'prejudices', 'same', 'human', 'frailties', 'exist', 'world', 'exist', 'Harry', 'being', 'wizard', 'pretty', 'darn', 'cool', 'not', 'answer', 'Harry', 'problems', 'film', 'clear', 'difficult', 'challenges', 'ahead', 'him.I', 'think', 'central', 'theme', 'movie', 'one', 'invaluable', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'love', 'most', 'powerful', 'magic', 'Even', 'wand', 'waving', 'fantastical', 'creatures', 'Harry', 'salvation']",N/A

He/She says ""classic is not a word"" to be used when discussing or reviewing the Potter series of books or movies.I must respectuflly disagree. While C.S. Lewis' novels of Narnia are widely purchased and presumptively read, they are a bit too moralistic for my taste. Lewis has a well-grounded Christian basis, but I prefer my moralizing more from the pulpit than from supposedly secular fiction.As to Frank L. Baum's books on Oz. . .the first three or four were realitively imaginative and entertaining. After that, it was clear Baum, like his contemporary Edgar Rice Burroughs of ""Tarzan"" fame, was milking the series for every dime it could produce!Rowling, on the other hand, has reconstructed a macro-cosmology, seated fully in her own unique imagination, and populated same with characters and events to serve her own literary &lt;you read it correctly, ""literary""> aims. All I mean is that Ms. Rowling is telling her own story in her own way. She has no theological, philosophical, or even teleogical axe to grind that I can discover &lt;when asked what she based her ""magic"" on in the novels in a televised interview, Ms. Rowling looked both amused and somewhat confused! Her forthright answer was that she had simply ""made it up!"">The movie version does the book proud! It essentially sticks to the book's plot, events, and sequence without losing the sense of innocence of childhood poised on the threshhold of adolescence while being faced with problems and situations of adult &lt;and beyond> proportions. Harry must make choices, and Ms. Rowling does not allow her creation to get away with making wrong choices without the accompanying consequences and results of such choices. Harry must study hard, work hard, choose correctly, and be true to himself and his friends, and his beliefs. Such sad, tramautic events, to be sure. . .but at least Harry ACTS. . .unlike Dorothy in Oz who simpers and whimpers her disire to go home.Harry has friends, yes. But Dorothy has a deus-ex-machina to rescue her. Harry has to think and act for himself.I love Dorothy and Toto. I don't care much for Lewis &lt;only because I find him preachy>. But I ADMIRE Harry, Ron, and Hemione. That trio has to get it right. Dorothy has Glinda and the Scarecrow, Lion, and Tinman to help when Dorothy is hopelessly confused and lost. Harry and company have to get it on their own. . . .Well, there it is. The basic conflict. Get it on your own, or wait for the miracle. . .Miracles do happen, I admit, but sometimes we must make our own. And that's what Harry Potter does, that Dorothy in Oz, and NEVER happens in Narnia.

I haven't read the books (though that ought to change soon now that I'm a new father!) and I didn't see the film in theaters.  But I was captivated from the start by the story, the charactors, and the wonderful sets.  It's interesting to note that the CGI is toned down a bit compared to the eye candy that's being passed off as movies these days.  Most of the animals (including the owls) are real, as are most of the sets (real stone floors, tables, etc.), thereby making the story much more believable than Star Wars II.From such young actors, the acting is superb, and the adults do a good job as well (some of those british accents seem a bit forced, though).  Some (adult)reviewers have noted that some scenes (the chess scene, for example) failed to instill fear in thier minds.  I think that they were executed perfectly, keep in mind that this movie is aimed at pre-teens.  If you'd like to see children getting their heads blown off, then you won't enjoy this film.  All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at this refreshing fantasy that's should be in anyone's collection.A last note:  I give the movie 5 stars, but the DVD does lack some of the features you might expect from such a film.

I can't post the URL but, search on google for harry potter dvd comparison and it'll be the first hit. Anyway, it turns out that Harry Potter was filmed in super35 film. That means that both the widescreen and fullscreen editions are &quot;crops&quot; of the actual original footage which is a larger area of view than either format. So, what all this means is there are things you can see in the fullscreen version that you cant in the widescreen and vice versa.

I finally watched the first movie when I was house sitting for a friend. I'll admit I watched just to see what all the fuss was about. Two and a half hours later I was hooked. The movie captivated me from the very first scene. In fact, the next day I went out and bought all four of the books and eagerly started reading them. I wanted to have them finished before the second movie came out which (at the time) was going to be in theaters that November.Quite simply this movie is just pure magic. It is still my favorite of the movies. John Williams' score really pulls you right into the movie. Each actor delivers believable performances. Even the kids. I've heard people say that the kids just weren't all that great in the acting department, but I have to disagree. I had no trouble believing that Daniel Radcliffe was Harry Potter or Rupert was Ron or Emma was Hermione. In fact, Hermione is my favorite character and Emma Watson captured her perfectly. Then there was Maggie Smith as McGonagall. Loved her.Christopher Columbus really did a brilliant job in bringing the first book to the screen. I can't give this movie enough praise. I haven't been as captivated by a movie since the first time I saw the original Star Wars back in 77. This is pure movie magic at it's best.

The home theatre feels more cosy somehow.It is a beautifully rendered version of a wonderful book.  With incredible detail added to build up the world Harry inhabits.  Most cast members seem tailor-made for their parts.  Unlike at the theatre, it's relatively long running time was no hardship with the option of &quot;pause&quot; and as a great admirer of the book, I couldn't help but wish for even MORE SCENES to expand on the story.  The only &quot;flaw&quot; in this version for some reviewers was a lack of major, earthmoving plot points, but for this fan of the Harry Potter series of books, it was a faithful, loving and respectful telling of the story.  And a movie that I think I will enjoy viewing many times.The second disk which offers additions is much, much less than I had hoped for and a serious disappointment.  The tour of Hogwarts and Hagrid's cottage is cheesy graphics, fuzzy and just not up to any respectable standards.  The 'games' are simplistic and pointless.  And once played, never a challenge again, even for little kids.  In a movie offering such beautiful attention to detail, I would have expected more (from the extras) and would rather had have more out-takes from the film than just the seven scenes offered.  The only worthwhile part of this disk is the rather extensive interviews with Chris Columbus and several of the other artists responsible for making this movie.  I understand that there are more features available with a CD ROM, but we were not able to view those, so I don't have any comments on what they might add to this disk.So 5 stars for the movie and 2 stars for the extras from this reviewer.",4,Charming Movie!

525419,AV8VLS7ZPUPUQ,B00003CXI0,Carol Tessen,"[1, 1]","Two of my co-workers talked me into reading the Harry Potter books.  From the first three paragraphs in the first book, I was hooked.  At first I was a bit embarrassed about being so caught up in what was supposedly a children's book, but I quickly learned that Harry Potter is for young and old alike.  In fact, I have talked to many adults who have read this series of books and are anxiously awaiting the next (me included).  I was very curious to see if the movie would follow the book and it does.  Obviously they had to condense the book or else the movie would be hours long.  But the screen writers did an admirable job and this movie absolutely lives up to the hype!The movie is 2 hours long but it will have you spellbound the whole way through.  The actors are superb and the special effects are outstanding.  It's rated PG for `scary moments and mild language.'  I believe that only very young children might be frightened by a few of the scenes, they just aren't that bad.  One scene, as an example, shows a dead unicorn with the villain, Voldemort, bent over the unicorn's neck, drinking it's blood.  Voldemort has to do this in order to continue his evil existence.  There is no closeup, nothing graphic, no gore in this scene; it was done as mildly as possible.  The director gets the point across without the `blood and guts.'  It is also stressed about what an evil and cowardly act it is to kill an innocent animal and that the person who does it must pay the price.  Still, you do see a dead unicorn with the knowledge that the bad guy killed it.  A very young child may have difficulties with it.  As for the language, it is very mild, nothing to worry about.I have heard about many people wanting the Harry Potter books and movie banned because they say it's about witchcraft and the dark arts.  Harry Potter is indeed a wizard, as are his friends, Hermione and Ron.  But the books and movie stress that wizards only use their special powers for good, not evil, intentions.  The power of love, strong moral values, courage to stand up for your convictions, the value of friendship, sports etiquette, and perseverance are some things that J.K. Rowling addresses in her books.  In Harry Potter's world, good always conquers evil.I recommend the DVD version of Harry Potter because of the added features of the 2nd disc.  I tried it on my computer and did enjoy the tours and game that were included.  I have not been able to view the never-before-seen-footage however.

I was not sorry for the purchase! I purchased the widescreen edition and found it much more enjoyable than the pan and scan. There are parts that you miss with the pan and scan version like what is happening off to the side of the action.I can't compare this movie to the book...yet...because I haven't in fact read the books but am working on it now.  :)  I did notice in the first two chapters of the book already that it is in fact different from the movie. The reader sees a bit more into the Dursleys's life than we do in the film. The film picks up when Harry is delivered to his Aunt and Uncle instead of before that when we learn of the fate of Lily and James Potter and baby Harry.What I did find annoying was that the deleted scenes are so well hidden that without help from an instruction manual online, you can't find them.  For those of you who need help, as I did, this is how you get to the deleted scenes (I'm sure there are different ways, but this is how I was told to find them.) Insert the second disc and using your remote, you must do all of the following:Hit &quot;Diagon Alley&quot; and enter on your remote.Next is finding the correct bricks.hit:left, up, up, enterup, enterup, enterdown, down, enterdown, enterNext you need to go to the bank.Highlight the sign &quot;Gringotts&quot; and hit the down arrow key on the remote to highlight the key.

Rowling. In &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, we get introduced to Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), a young British boy of eleven who lives with his mean Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and spoiled cousin Dudley. The Dursleys try to be a perfectly normal family--they despise everything that seems out of the ordinary--but they also have a secret which Harry will soon learn. Harry is actually a wizard! He's just been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and this is where the adventure begins. Harry learns the truth about his past from the friendly Hogwarts Games Keeper named Hagrid, and during his first year at the magical school, Harry makes friends, arch rivals, and even mortal enemies as he starts his training in the magical arts.For anyone who loves the books, you must see this film. The acting is outstanding by the entire cast...most of the actors fit right into their roles. The special effects are superb and engaging. The storyline follows the first book pretty well, though they had to take out some of the book. The film is just about how I imagined it would be as I read the book. Daniel Radcliffe is the perfect Harry Potter! The DVD is OK with seven deleted scenes, a self-guided tour of Hogwarts, interviews with the filmmakers, behind-the-scenes look at the making of &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, DVD-ROM extras, and more. The bad thing about the DVD extras is that, to get to the deleted scenes, you have to play a game every time and it gets a little annoying after a while.

I haven't been so caught up in a movie's world since the first STAR WARS of venerable memory. The cast, except *just per-haps* for the theatrically glowering Rickman, is splendid, the settings are gorgeous, and oh, the SFX! The quidditch match alone is worth the price.Some reviewers take Columbus and his screenwriters to task for not following the book exactly, but I think they've improved upon it. The means by which Harry and his pals first happen upon Fluffy the three-headed dog, for example: instead of a mischievous poltergeist, it's moving stairways that land them in the forbidden corridor--visually far more delightful. And the scene in which Harry and Ron play &quot;wizard chess&quot; with pieces that bash each other foreshadows the full-size game perfectly. On the other hand, where they *have* remained faithful to the original, they've done so, for the most part, with exactitude. My gripes are very minor: for example, I would have liked a brief scene in which the several Weasley brothers were formally introduced to Harry (there is one in the book, but in the movie I didn't realize Ron had brothers till I saw their names in the cast roll).This is definitely a movie for the whole family, though the smallest ones *may* find Fluffy, Hagrid, Lord Voldemort, and the chess game scary. And having been through a rather stressful three weeks the first time I saw it (in the theater), I found it to be just the remedy I needed. For a couple of hours I could completely forget what had been turning my life upside down, and worry about whether Harry was going to fall off his broom when *it* did!

525435,A2ZDGC1S2QZFU0,B00003CXI0,Chris Jothi,"[1, 2]","The first Harry Potter film sold over 1.5 million videos and DVDs in its first day of release in the UK, breaking the previous impressive record held by Titanic. Now of course all these people, and their families, would have seen the film in the cinema and have enjoyed Christopher Columbus's excellent adaptation of one of the most succesfful books of the last century. They would have been gripped to the screen, just like myself, as we saw JK Rowling's incredible imagination come to life. The film is, in my humble opinion, a revelation. An example of how the medium of film can awe an audience, transport them to another world and entertain them for a few hours. It is escapism in the truest form. There's only one problem. The DVD [is bad].The film has now surpassed The Phantom Menace as the second most successful film of all time. Warner have therefore spent an awful lot of money on this DVD production (and it shows). They clearly want to give us fans something to sink our teeth into, a DVD like no other, and one that would simply put to shame the conventional DVDs we have now grown accustomed to. But as they dived into complicated navigations and interactive menus they forgot about the elementary yet effective delights of Making Of Documentaries and commentaries. I cannot find a valid excuse why Warner would want to deprive us of a filmmakers commentary. The sets, effects, casting, direction, music, sound etc are of the highest quality and no doubt the people who contributed to this film would have been proud to share with us how the production was made. Commentaries are the most popular & SIGNIFICANT features on DVDs, and probably one of the cheaper features to make, so not even seeing ONE present on this 2 Disc ""Special Edition"" package is a disappointment to say the least.The interviews with the director and producer are very good but are too brief. Why have the people who made this DVD been so slack with the basics? There must be hundreds of hours worth of Making Of footage lying around in the Warner vaults. An inch of it barely makes it onto these discs.Of course there is the much talked about guided tour of Hogwarts, and this is where the DVD gets really messy. You get to direct yourself around certain sets. Using the arrows on your DVD's remote you can go left, right and forward at certain moments, and you can select objects on the screen to activate a voiceover which gives us a description. For instance, if you click on Hagrid's large cloak whilst in his hut the voiceover says what it contains and so on. I have to say that the idea is excellent. The intentions were in the right place but the tour becomes boring. It is not like a video game either where you can go wherever you want. You navigate yourself according to arrows, which restrict you to a certain area, and once you have completed the tour I guarantee you that it will not be half as interesting the second time round. It is quite laborious. And this is why I am calling this the first DVD flop. Sure, it will make millions, but only because of the film itself. The features are simply pointless. An experiment that went wrong. And to compund how poorly the navigation is I have yet to even see the deleted scenes. I can't find them. There isn't a simply button that says ""Deleted scenes - click here"" but different rooms and tests that I mast trawl through to access them.This said I would still recommend you buy it. Why? Because the film has never looked or sounded this good. The picture quality is perfect, and as the film is such a visual feast the picture transfer is actually important. The plus $120 million spent on the film is justified when you see Hogwarts for the first time. It is a glorious sight and I will be the first to say far better than what I imagined it to be. Now when I read the Potter books I often substitute the film's interpretations for my own because they are more vivid. Then you have the glorious digital 5.1 soundtrack. The atmosphere created makes your hairs stand on end, and when the Quidditch game takes place you hear sounds whizzing by your ears. Great stuff!I was expecting a DVD similar to The Phantom Menace. Instead it is second rate, trying to pass itself off as a CD-ROM. Thinking about it why didn't they just do that! The kids will like it, but will grow bored very quickly.

Benz ""CJB""","[0, 0]","Apparently, on agreeing to sell the Harry Potter film franchise, one of J K Rowling's conditions was that the cast had to be predominantly British. This request proved to have been one of the fundamental keys to the success of the movie version of 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'. At the risk of being contentious, fine as his work on the film is, I think the choice of Chris Columbus as director ensures a well made, slick product but also just that bit of blandness that prevents the film from being an absolute classic. Having said that, the casting is phenomenal, especially Radcliff and Watson, and the choice of remaining true to the novel rather than condensing and combining Rowling's work is at once inspired and obvious. Compared to the 'Lord of the Rings' saga released at the same time, it's a little bit too shiny, a bit too mainstream in it's style, but it's certainly a success because it gets all of the big things right, principally the characters. One wonders if Terry Gilliam (Rowling's first choice for director) had helmed the film, it might have been more unique, but could easily have become a mess too. Ultimately, the reason this film is so superb is because of Rowling's imagination and her good judgment in balancing plot with unforgettable characters.",4,"Classic book, almost classic film",1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,1287,"['Apparently', 'agreeing', 'sell', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'franchise', 'one', 'J', 'K', 'Rowling', 'conditions', 'was', 'cast', 'had', 'be', 'predominantly', 'British', 'request', 'proved', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'fundamental', 'keys', 'success', 'movie', 'version', ""'Harry"", 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'risk', 'being', 'contentious', 'fine', 'work', 'film', 'think', 'choice', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'director', 'well', 'made', 'slick', 'product', 'also', 'just', 'bit', 'blandness', 'film', 'being', 'absolute', 'classic', 'Having', 'said', 'casting', 'phenomenal', 'especially', 'Radcliff', 'Watson', 'choice', 'remaining', 'true', 'novel', 'rather', 'condensing', 'combining', 'Rowling', 'work', 'once', 'inspired', 'obvious', 'Compared', ""'Lord"", 'Rings', 'saga', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'shiny', 'bit', 'too', 'mainstream', 'style', 'certainly', 'success', 'big', 'things', 'right', 'principally', 'characters', 'One', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Rowling', 'first', 'choice', 'director', 'had', 'helmed', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'unique', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'mess', 'too', 'Ultimately', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'superb', 'Rowling', 'imagination', 'good', 'judgment', 'balancing', 'plot', 'unforgettable', 'characters']",N/A
525439,AYXZU81PMZBKC,B00003CXI0,"Christopher Wood ""anima300""","[1, 2]","THIS REVIEW WILL ONLY BE BASED ON THE MOVIE, AND ITS RELATION TO THE NOVEL.So this is the beginning, isn't it?  JK Rowling's incredible world of magic, that started in 1998 in America started on the movie screen in 2001.  So how good was this movie?  It was definitely very good.  Quite roughly it's about a boy who nearly died by the most dangerous dark wizard to ever step foot in the world, and ends up living with a muggle family related to his mother who treat him like an outcast and a bad seed, feeling disgraced and embarrassed that any family member could be magical.  But Harry receives a letter to go to one of the best magic schools, called Hogwarts, and he begins to learn about his unavoidable wizard heritage.You have to start with the acting, because starting with this film for the series, there has been a healthy mix of young new talent, and veteran talent throughout, and this film is no different.  The whole cast is virtually British with a few Irish exceptions.  You have Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris as McGonagall, Snape, and Dumbledore respectively anchoring the wonderful young talents of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy).  The acting is simply great in my opinion, considering they were enlisting child talent throughout the country.The important part of a film adaptation of a novel is bringing forward the spirit the novel creates.  The nice thing is that Sorcerer's Stone is the shortest of all the Harry Potters, so it makes it relatively easy to stay faithful with a 2 hour 20 minute film.  Chris Columbus and his people did a great job of this.  Nearly all of the important pieces are there for the adaptation to make sense, and for all the pieces to fit together as well as they did in the novel.Now, Harry Potter is obviously geared to young adults, so why should someone in their 20s or 30s get into Harry Potter?  First off, the film IS visually stimulating.  The special effects aren't overdone, nor is it the focus, but it's done perfectly to give what it has to give to the film.  Also, the children playing the roles really bring out what these characters are all about in the novel, as do the adult cast.  Their personalities are effectively evoked through their incredible performances, and although the concept of magic spells and high fantasy are more indicative of your stereotypical middle school nerd, it has a lot to offer about adolescence and self-doubt, even at the tender age of 11.  Perhaps JK Rowling didn't envision her saga would reach the adult demographic, but it did, and that's kind of what makes these stories amazing.So what was great about this film for it to deserve 4 out of 5 stars?  The acting was phenomenal, but the important thing when a series such as Harry Potter has so much popular culture buzz is to stay faithful so the bookworms can respect it, but so newbies can get into it and follow the films much like people would follow the novels, and Sorcerer's Stone definitely achieves this effectively.  The special effects were great when they were necessary, and the character introductions were well-played.  Enough things were changed around, such as the order of things, and certain settings, but the important parts were there, and the actions that occurred were evoked, even though something may have taken place on Hogwarts footsteps, as opposed to the Hogwarts train as it was in the novel (Harry's first confrontation with Malfoy, for example).What was negative for the film to not deserve five stars?  Well, it was what it was.  Most introductory novels to a fantasy series has to spend a significant amount of time introducing the characters and future plotlines, and Sorcerer's Stone is really no different.  The film isn't all that exciting, and there really isn't a ton of action.  I found the ending a little bit anti-climactic, although the twist was rather nice, but it really wasn't a battle.  Given what would go forward with the series, but if one was grading this movie in and of itself, it is a bit of an anti-climactic end.  There was also one omittance that was a bit irritating whichy was the end sequence (SPOILER ALERT) when Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter the chamber to retrieve the Sorcerer's Stone before Professor Snape does (or so they believed anyway).  You had the Devil's Snare, the Flying Keys, and the Chess Match.  The film omitted the logic puzzle that Hermione figures out which is why in the novel she gets Gryffendor bonus points.  In the film she gets them through figuring out the Devil's Snare.  I wasn't really sure why this was omitted, probably for action continuity, but, I would have liked to have seen Hermione be her brainiac self for that portion.All-in-all, for introductory purposes, and its ability to ensnare filmgoers into coming to the movie theater to see the next segment, it succeeds admirably.  There really is nothing wrong with the film at all, but the four out of five stars comes down to taste, and as most of us know, soon the series begins to take a darker tone, which is when it really finds its stride.  But JK Rowling really does create a great world with this story, and the film more or less does a very good job in being able to evoke her incredible vision.",4,"Fantastically Faithful, but it IS only

Extended version makes you feel like you're getting every morsel of (to me) the most endearing of the HP films because it's the first one when Harry, Hermione & Ron were at their cutest and most innocent.  For non book readers, it's the wondrous first introduction to the magical world of Hogwarts after all.  The rest of the bonus features are satisfyingly interesting, informative & entertaining although the self-guided tours are sort of lame & I'm not sure what I'll do w/ all the extra versions (in addn to the extended version, comes w/ the reg theatrical release plus a digital copy).  The rest of the bonus featurettes, although not as elaborate as the ones Peter Jackson did for the Lord of the Rings, are still worth the few extra bucks if you're a fan of movie 'extras' of your favorite flicks.  I don't think I'll admit to owning the trading cards (LOL) but they ARE very nice - super heavy & larger than baseball trading cards.  The photo book is actually quite beautiful.

525445,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B00003CXI0,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[0, 1]","In 1997, unknown author J.K. Rowling had her first novel published. Not only was it an intelligent and highly imaginative fantasy story, but it also served as the first book in a seven-part series.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone(later renamedHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stonefor American readers) renewed children's interest in reading and became an international bestseller, receiving high acclaim and multiple awards. The book became a cultural phenomenon and after the publication of its sequel,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, a film adaptation was inevitable. Harry Potter was one of the most sought after properties in cinematic history, and attracted the attention of Hollywood's biggest names. Ultimately, Chris Columbus directed the film, from a screenplay by Steve Kloves.When Harry Potter was only a year old, his parents were mysteriously killed and he was sent to live with his mother's sister's family, the extremely unpleasant Dursleys. From an early age, young Harry Potter proved to be an unusual child. Once while on a visit to the zoo, Harry accidentally made a pane of glass disappear letting loose a python, which scared his obnoxious cousin Dudley half to death.On Harry's eleventh birthday, a half-giant named Hagrid explains that Harry's mother was a witch and his father was a wizard and that Harry's been invited to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry also learns that his parents did not die in a mysterious car crash as he had been told, but rather they had been killed by the notorious Dark Lord, Voldemort, often referred to as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Hagrid accompanies Harry to London and from there to Diagon Alley, where magical supplies can be bought. Harry buys his first wand, his spellbooks, and Hagrid even gives him a snowy white owl named Hedwig. From there he's off to Hogwarts by way of the Hogwarts Express, a bright red train, which leaves from Platform 9 at King's Cross Station. While waiting for the train Harry meets a large wizarding family, the Weasleys, and befriends their youngest son Ron while on the train. Harry and Ron also meet Hermione, a clever but often snobby young girl.After arriving at Hogwarts Castle, Harry and the other first year students are sorted into one of four houses. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are placed into Gryffindor, a house that is renowned for having courageous and loyal students. Harry meets the different teachers: the kind yet stern Professor MacGonagall, the malicious Professor Snape, twitchy and nervous Professor Quirrell, and the wizened and eccentric headmaster Dumbledore. Harry soon learns that each teacher treats him differently. MacGonagall, despite her chilly demeanor is very clearly fond of Harry, but Snape on the other hand seems to have a vendetta against Harry. Harry also learns of a rivalry between the school houses of Gryffindor and Slytherin, and this rivalry is exemplified by an arrogant bully named Draco Malfoy.One day Harry, Ron, and Hermione get lost in the castle and come across a room that's being guarded by a three-headed dog. Harry, Ron, and Hermione soon learn that the dog is guarding a series of hidden passageways and rooms, where something called the Sorcerer's Stone is being stored. The Sorcerer's Stone has the power to make whoever possesses it immortal. After a bit of late night investigating, Harry comes to believe that someone, probably Snape, is trying to steal the stone for Lord Voldemort. With the stone, Voldemort would be restored to his full power and he would again terrorize the world of magic. Can Harry, Ron, and Hermione prevent Voldemort's return and who can Harry trust in this world full of magic and intrigue?Adapting such an inventive and detailed story would prove difficult, and yet the film is successful as it manages to include almost all of the important characters and events from Rowling's novel.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone became a worldwide blockbuster and set Box Office records. There are a number of reasons for the film's colossal success. One of those reasons is the group of highly talented special effects artists that were gathered in order to create the style and look of the film. Also making a huge contribution were the experts who designed the costumes, the props, the sets, and the general atmosphere of the film. But the person who deserves the most credit is Rowling herself, who created an immaculate fantasy world that holds a universal appeal for both children and adults.The extraordinary cast includes veteran British actors, as well as some talented young unknowns (who aren't unknown anymore). The cast features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Maggie Smith as Professor MacGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, and Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore.Though the film is a marvelous attempt at turning Rowling's novel into a physical reality, it does have its flaws. Much of the time the special effects are unconvincing, which wouldn't be so bad if they weren't used as the centerpiece of almost every scene. Another problem, and this is a very minor problem, is that some of the younger cast members under emote, or give stiff and forced performances. However, the acting will improve with each successive Harry potter film.Ultimately, Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts will be remembered and treasured by fans of all ages for many years to come.I also recommendthe spectacular soundtrack by John Williams.",4,Year One at Hogwarts,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,5547,"['1997', 'unknown', 'author', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'had', 'first', 'novel',

525446,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00003CXI0,Craig MACKINNON,"[9, 11]","For those of you that have been living in a cave for the last several years, Harry Potter is a boy-wizard, raised by &quot;Muggles&quot; (non-magical people) who is taken away to a private school for wizards and witches when he turns 11.  The success of J.K. Rowling's books made a film version inevitable, but also a risky venture (2nd only to Lord of the Rings).  Chris Columbus's film stands up well on the surface.  Unfortunately, in a more in-depth analysis, it's not much more than a kiddie movie.In defense of the filmakers, they saw the challenge of this first Harry Potter film as faithfully reproducing the atmosphere and magic of Hogwarts, the school.  This they did admirably well with fantastic sets and a liberal helping of computer-generated images.  Some of the CGI looks cartoony, but I suspect it is to prevent younger viewers from being scared.  Likewise, the characters are faithfully reproduced by the actors - I was especially impressed with Smith as Prof. McGonagall, the teacher who demands a lot, is a strict disciplinarian, but still admired.  We've all known teachers like that, but the performance generates such respect that you totally believe in McGonagall (rather than the screenplay dictating it), even in her rediculous witch hat.  Likewise, Rickman and Harris as Snape and Dumbledore are pretty much exactly as you would picture them from reading the book.However, I have to question the interpretation in places.  The two main misteps (the blame for which I place on director Columbus) are:  1. Harry is far too rebellious and confident in some scenes - to the point of arrogance - which was not Rowling's intention.  2. In filming most of the events of the book, the running time blew up to 150 minutes.  This is not an adaptation so much as a photocopy!  However, if interest was more in the environment than the story, future films will be better (especially as each book gets longer, it will be impossible to film all the events).  All things considered, it's an enjoyable movie, although with limited replay enjoyment.As a special edition 2-DVD set, I was disappointed by the lack of material.  The entire 2nd disc is devoted to little games that are annoying to adults and not fun enough to hold a child's interest.  Especially annoying is the fact that to access the deleted scenes, you have to navigate through many games that give you little direction to solving the puzzles, and that kick you back to the beginning if you choose wrong.  ARGH!  Also, the &quot;making-of&quot; featurette is quite short (16 minutes).  There is no commentary or other extras - why not bring in Rowling for a commentary on how things were adapted?  Therefore, it's a disappointing DVD version of an enjoyable film.",3,"Very good try, but doesn'te make it to the &quot;great DVD&quot; level",1045008000,"02 12, 2003",2003,2740,"['have', 'been', 'living', 'cave', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'boy-wizard', 'raised', 'quot', 'Muggles', 'quot', 'non-magical', 'people', 'who', 'taken', 'away', 'private', 'school', 'wizards', 'witches', 'when', '11', 'success', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'books', 'made', 'film', 'version', 'inevitable', 'also', 'risky', 'venture', '2nd', 'only', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'film', 'up', 'well', 'surface', 'Unfortunately', 'more', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'kiddie', 'movie.In', 'defense', 'filmakers', 'saw', 'challenge', 'first', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'faithfully', 'reproducing', 'atmosphere', 'magic', 'Hogwarts', 'school', 'did', 'admirably', 'well', 'fantastic', 'sets', 'liberal', 'helping', 'computer-generated', 'images', 'CGI', 'cartoony', 'suspect', 'prevent', 'younger', 'viewers', 'being', 'scared', 'Likewise', 'characters', 'are', 'faithfully', 'reproduced', 'actors', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'Smith', 'Prof.', 'McGonagall', 'teacher', 'who', 'lot', 'strict', 'disciplinarian', 'still', 'admired', ""'ve"", 'known', 'teachers', 'performance', 'generates', 'such', 'respect', 'totally', 'believe', 'McGonagall', 'rather', 'screenplay', 'dictating', 'even', 'rediculous', 'witch', 'hat', 'Likewise', 'Rickman', 'Harris', 'Snape', 'Dumbledore', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'would', 'picture', 'reading', 'book.However', 'have', 'question', 'interpretation', 'places', 'two', 'main', 'misteps', 'blame', 'place', 'director', 'Columbus', 'are', '1', 'Harry', 'far', 'too', 'rebellious', 'confident', 'scenes', 'point', 'arrogance', 'was', 'not', 'Rowling', 'intention', '2', 'filming', 'most', 'events', 'book', 'running', 'time', 'blew', 'up', '150', 'minutes', 'not', 'adaptation', 'so', 'much', 'photocopy', 'However', 'interest', 'was', 'more', 'environment', 'story', 'future', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'especially', 'book', 'longer', 'will', 'be', 'impossible', 'film', 'events', 'things', 'considered', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'limited', 'replay', 'special', 'edition', '2-DVD', 'set', 'was', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'material', 'entire', '2nd', 'disc', 'devoted', 'little', 'games', 'are', 'annoying', 'adults', 'not', 'fun', 'enough', 'hold', 'child', 'interest', 'Especially', 'annoying', 'fact', 'access', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', 'navigate', 'many', 'games', 'give', 'little', 'direction', 'solving', 'puzzles', 'kick', 'back', 'beginning', 'choose', 'wrong', 'ARGH', 'Also', 'quot', 'making-of', 'quot', 'featurette', 'quite', 'short', '16', 'minutes', 'commentary', 'other', 'extras', 'why', 'not', 'bring', 'Rowling', 'commentary', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'adapted', 'Therefore', 'disappointing', 'DVD', 'version', 'enjoyable', 'film']",N/A
525447,A2W0SHGPT7O0OI,B00003CXI0,"""critic_2000""","[1, 1]","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was definitely one of the best films of the year and one of the best fantasy films of all time. I was not disappointed at all, unlike some fans of Harry Potter. I thought Chris Columbus did a great adaptation of the book and I couldn't have asked for better. The film was very faithful, only leaving out some small scenes because you honestly could never fit the entire book into the movie...I mean, just look at ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring""! Some people claim that a movie can never live up to the book it is based on, but in some cases that is not always true. Sometimes, the movie is actually BETTER than the book--so give the movie a chance! And also, I hate it when people say that, if a movie is apart of a series, since the first movie was bad then they do not want to see the other movies. Well, if you've read all four Harry Potter books then you know the better, more interesting stuff comes later...so just stick around and see the other movies before you judge even if you thought ""Sorcerer's Stone"" was boring and/or disappointing.I thought the casting was absolutely perfect! Daniel Radcliffe doesn't just PLAY the role of Harry Potter...he IS Harry Potter! Rupert Grint is funny and witty as Harry's best friend, Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson is smart and charming as Harry's other best friend, Hermione Granger. Tom Felton is really great as Draco Malfoy, Harry's arch rival at Hogwarts, Alan Rickman is creepy as Professor Snape. Richard Harris is mezmorising as Professor Dumbledore. Robbie Coltrane is hilarious and wonderful as Hagrid, the half friendly giant. And Maggie Smith is superb as Professor McGonagall. The rest of the cast are really good, too. In another review down below, I read that they are going to replace Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint (probably along with the rest of the child actors) for the ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" film and the rest of the Harry Potter films. I really hope they do not do that...these child actors are perfect! I thought they were going to do a film each year because each year these child actors will be a year older, like they are in the books. So they really do not need to replace them. So please do not replace any of these actors, because that will only ruin the movies!!Did I mention the special effects? Because the special effects are truly amazing!! I especially loved the big chess board scene and the Quidditch match, though in the book, they have two Quidditch matches. Hogwarts castle is truly spectacular! John Williams' score is haunting and breathtaking. The dialouge is OK, but it's really a children's fantasy film...it's not supposed to be another ""A Beautiful Mind"". For those who say ""The Lord of the Rings"" is better, get over it! They are two totally different movies! I really wish people would stop trying to compare movies like ""Harry Potter"", ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Spider-Man"", and ""Star Wars"" because they are all different. Why do we have to choose between them?

525452,A9V06G9SIID08,B00003CXI0,Dafydd Mac an Leigh,"[6, 35]","When &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot; hit the bookstores in 1997, it quickly established the kind of popularity which makes a film version all but inevitable. For four years straight, J.K. Rowling churned out books in what has become one of the most popular contemporary children's book series. Now, of course, attention has been turned to adapting them for film.If they can't even get the title right, what hope does the rest of the movie have?The cast is a mixed bag. Harry himself is played very well by Daniel Radcliffe, best known (before this) for his portrayal of David Copperfield for the BBC. Alan Rickman is brilliant as Prof. Snape; Dame Maggie Smith would have been better as Prof. McGonagall if she dropped the &quot;Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; accent. Richard Harris an Robbie Coltraine look their roles as Dumbledore and Hagrid respectively, but seem incapable of acting them. As for Harry's classmates, well, Rupert Grint, as Ron, gets little to do but react facially, Emma Watson is insufferable as Hermione, Tom Felton fails to exude any malice as Malfoy, and the rest are just there.The filmmakers went out of their way to make the film look as good as possible, which I can greatly appreciate. Unfortunately, that care didn't extend to anything else. Screenwriter Steven Kloves seems completely ignorant of the basic rules for adapting a book to screen; he retains extraneous bits while cutting vital plot progressions. Moreover, he gives thoroughly English characters thoroughly American turns of phrase. Director Chris Columbus does a very shoddy job of pacing; he could have kept in all seven of those deleted scenes and still come out with a shorter movie if he'd just kept things moving.  The flavor and the magic of the book are just drained out of this movie.And now we have the DVD. There are one or two interesting bits to it, like the deleted scenes, the trivia, and a short amalgam of behind-the-scenes interviews, but the rest is convoluted nonsense that - rather like the movie, actually - takes much longer than it needs to and is wholly unsatisfying by the end.I say forget about this cinematic mediocrity and settle down for a good read.",1,Very poor adaptation,1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,2197,"['When', 'quot', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'quot', 'hit', 'bookstores', '1997', 'quickly', 'established', 'kind', 'popularity', 'film', 'version', 'inevitable', 'four', 'years', 'straight', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'churned', 'out', 'books', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'contemporary', 'children', 'book', 'series', 'Now', 'course', 'attention', 'been', 'turned', 'adapting', 'film.If', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'title', 'right', 'what', 'hope', 'rest', 'movie', 'have', 'cast', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Harry', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'best', 'known', 'portrayal', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'BBC', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'brilliant', 'Prof.', 'Snape', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Prof.', 'McGonagall', 'dropped', 'quot', 'Prime', 'Miss', 'Jean', 'Brodie', 'quot', 'accent', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Robbie', 'Coltraine', 'look', 'roles', 'Dumbledore', 'Hagrid', 'respectively', 'seem', 'incapable', 'acting', 'Harry', 'classmates', 'well', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Ron', 'little', 'do', 'react', 'facially', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'insufferable', 'Hermione', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'exude', 'malice', 'Malfoy', 'rest', 'are', 'just', 'there.The', 'filmmakers', 'went', 'way', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'as', 'good', 'possible', 'can', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'Unfortunately', 'care', 'did', ""n't"", 'extend', 'anything', 'else', 'Screenwriter', 'Steven', 'Kloves', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'basic', 'rules', 'adapting', 'book', 'screen', 'extraneous', 'bits', 'cutting', 'vital', 'plot', 'progressions', 'Moreover', 'thoroughly', 'English', 'characters', 'thoroughly', 'American', 'turns', 'phrase', 'Director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'very', 'shoddy', 'job', 'pacing', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'still', 'come', 'out', 'shorter', 'movie', ""'d"", 'just', 'kept', 'things', 'moving', 'flavor', 'magic', 'book', 'are', 'just', 'drained', 'out', 'movie.And', 'now', 'have', 'DVD', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'interesting', 'bits', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trivia', 'short', 'amalgam', 'behind-the-scenes', 'interviews', 'rest', 'convoluted', 'nonsense', 'rather', 'movie', 'actually', 'much', 'longer', 'wholly', 'unsatisfying', 'end.I', 'say', 'forget', 'cinematic', 'mediocrity', 'settle', 'down', 'good', 'read']",N/A

Very seldomly does a childrens movie contain material that is enjoyable for adults as well. When Harry Potter began to get popular I just ignored it, something I had learned to do when I got sick of the Pokemon mania that was ending just around that time. I had no desire to get involved with the Harry Potter franchise.I was suprised that this movie seemed to begin planning and wrap shooting in six months. Two months later the movie was in theaters. When a movie is done in that short of time I tend to really doubt its ability to be a good movie. My parents begged and pleaded with me to visit them one night, and they had planned a trip to see this movie for a family activity. I didn't really want to go but I'm glad I did.The movie was far from unenjoyable, and while the CGI effects were not spectacular the story was innovative, and fun despite being childish. The movie manages to be childish, but not immature, which makes it one of the most enjoyable kiddie flicks to date. I'm actually looking forward to the sequel.The acting in this movie is spectacular. I have not seen such talent in youth since Haley Joel Osment. The actors were also well cast as far as appearances because the actors resemble the characters they are portraying more so than any other movie of its kind. I am very pleased with the way this movie was done. If the special effects were better it would have otten five stars from me.I have not had time to check out the DVD extras yet, however just reading the back of the box has me itching for the time to do just that. I also must stress the importance of getting this movie in Widescreen I have seen both the Widescreen and Pan & [Scan] (Full screen) editions of this movie.

First I will rate the movie part then the special features.Harry potter is has alot going for it.  it has an amazing storyline, and amazing special effects.  The story is about a young boy named Harry Potter.  As a baby he was dropped off at his aunt and uncles house.  He was abused, then hagrid, a wizard came and told him he was excepted to Hogwarts school of wichchraft and wizardry.  The acting is probably the best I've seen in children actors.  The chemistry between the trio is amazing.  it adds a whole lot of enjoyment.  And the special effects, they are amazing.  The best special effects I've seen in a movie.  This movie blends modern technology and a great story, to make one of the best movies of 2001.Next I will review the special features disk.The special features are great.  They include a tour of Hogwarts, puzzles and games, and a commentary.  The point of the game is to get to the end, witch has many deleted scenes.  The tour of Hogwarts is also pretty cool.  It can't go through the whole of Hogwarts, but it does go through quite a bit.  The commentary is about the making of the movie, which is quite interesting.

525456,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00003CXI0,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[1, 1]","In 2001, two fall blockbusters involving witchcraft and wizards reached the theatres.  Unfortunately, I don't have a wand with which to say ""Review autoscriptus!"" or some snowy owls on one-day delivery standby so I have to do this with my fingers (sigh) and create words of wonder on the movie I liked better.While I haven't read J.K. Rowling's books, it must have been chock full of detail  I don't know of the movie:book accuracy ratio, but for director Chris Columbus to fit it in two and-a-half hours, it must have been a book spectacularis.Witches and wizards were persecuted throughout the ages, regarded as threats more than freaks as Harry's aunt did her sister, and more often than not, burned at the stake.  With Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the song remains the same, only this time, his uncle, aunt, and obnoxious cousin treat him contemptuously, as if he's an unwanted burden.  Who knows how his life would have been without the flurry of invitations to Hogwarts School courtesy of one-day owl delivery?  Fortunately, giant Rubeas Hagrid comes crashing to the rescue.  The real adventure begins from there.Daniel Radcliffe gives a performance competentus and credibilis as the totally likeable title character.  Of the troika of main characters, he's the most human.  However, Emma Watson as the resourceful and well-read Hermione Granger steals the show wands aloft.  Despite being snooty and knowing who she is, she proves herself to be a cut above others in classes (see her frantically waving on Professor Snape to call on her, and her proficient wand handling).  She does have feelings, though, as she angrily stomps past through Weasley, who fed up with her conceit, was verbally cutting her down a peg to Harry, finishing with ""No wonder she doesn't have any friends.""  If Hermione's character leads more children to flip pages instead of flipping bad guys on their PS2's or X-Box's, so much the better.  Rupert Grint, as Ron Weasley, makes a good foil for both his counterparts, being a fellow explorer and Christmas holiday companion with Harry or someone for Hermione to impart knowledge.The other performer to whom this show belongs to is veteran actor Robbie Coltrane as the friendly giant gameskeeper Rubeas Hagrid.  After Krull, Nuns On The Run, two James Bond movies, and From Hell among others, he has finally become a recognizable face on American shores.  American audiences should have warmed up to this talented performer earlier, and that's something I should've said.As for other veteran actors, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Zoe Wanamaker do wonders as the professors of Hogwarts, but Alan Rickman turns in a solid performance as the sinister Professor Snape, who doesn't seem to like Harry all that much.People, (or should that be muggles?) this is one movie specialus.  The special effects, while spectacular, do not detract from the character development or dialogue, like certain films I'm not going to name.  They merely support the magic whether it's the entrance to the square or the action scenes, such as the Quidditch match.Well, review terminatus, and see you at the theatres for the Chamber of Secrets",5,Video Excellentus!,1024963200,"06 25, 2002",2002,3163,"['2001', 'two', 'fall', 'blockbusters', 'involving', 'witchcraft', 'wizards', 'reached', 'theatres', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wand', 'say', 'Review', 'autoscriptus', 'snowy', 'owls', 'one-day', 'delivery', 'standby', 'have', 'do', 'fingers', 'sigh', 'create', 'words', 'wonder', 'movie', 'liked', 'better.While', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'books', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'chock', 'full', 'detail', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'book', 'accuracy', 'ratio', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'fit', 'two', 'and-a-half', 'hours', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'book', 'spectacularis.Witches', 'wizards', 'were', 'persecuted', 'ages', 'regarded', 'threats', 'more', 'freaks', 'Harry', 'aunt', 'did', 'sister', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'burned', 'stake', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'song', 'same', 'only', 'time', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'obnoxious', 'cousin', 'treat', 'contemptuously', 'unwanted', 'burden', 'Who', 'how', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'flurry', 'invitations', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'courtesy', 'one-day', 'owl', 'delivery', 'Fortunately', 'giant', 'Rubeas', 'Hagrid', 'crashing', 'rescue', 'real', 'adventure', 'there.Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'performance', 'competentus', 'credibilis', 'totally', 'likeable', 'title', 'character', 'troika', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'human', 'However', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'resourceful', 'well-read', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'show', 'aloft', 'being', 'snooty', 'knowing', 'who', 'be', 'cut', 'others', 'classes', 'see', 'frantically', 'waving', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'call', 'proficient', 'wand', 'handling', 'have', 'feelings', 'though', 'angrily', 'stomps', 'past', 'Weasley', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'conceit', 'was', 'verbally', 'cutting', 'down', 'peg', 'Harry', 'finishing', 'No', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'have', 'friends', 'Hermione', 'character', 'more', 'children', 'flip', 'pages', 'instead', 'flipping', 'bad', 'guys', 'PS2', 'X-Box', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'good', 'foil', 'counterparts', 'being', 'fellow', 'explorer', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'companion', 'Harry', 'someone', 'Hermione', 'impart', 'knowledge.The', 'other', 'performer', 'whom', 'show', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'friendly', 'giant', 'gameskeeper', 'Rubeas', 'Hagrid', 'Krull', 'Nuns', 'Run', 'two', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'From', 'Hell', 'others', 'finally', 'become', 'recognizable', 'face', 'American', 'shores', 'American', 'audiences', 'should', 'have', 'warmed', 'up', 'talented', 'performer', 'earlier', 'something', 'should', ""'ve"", 'said.As', 'other', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Zoe', 'Wanamaker', 'do', 'wonders', 'professors', 'Hogwarts', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'solid', 'performance', 'sinister', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'like', 'Harry', 'much.People', 'should', 'be', 'muggles', 'one', 'movie', 'specialus', 'special', 'effects', 'spectacular', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'character', 'development', 'dialogue', 'certain', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'name', 'merely', 'support', 'magic', 'entrance', 'square', 'action', 'scenes', 'such', 'Quidditch', 'match.Well', 'review', 'terminatus', 'see', 'theatres', 'Chamber', 'Secrets']",N/A
525457,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CXI0,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","It is really quite amazing that a major motion picture not only remained very faithful indeed to Rowling's original novel but actually succeeded very well in recreating the magical scenery and extraordinary environment of Hogwarts. The special effects in the movie are, on the whole, fantastic, a fact which becomes obvious upon Harry's first entrance into the Great Hall. Most amazing of all may be the spectacular presentation of the game of Quidditch. While almost all of Rowling's descriptions in the novel come leaping off the page, it is a little difficult to get a real picture of Quidditch in one's head; thanks to the movie, my days of struggling to really visualize the game as it is played are a thing of the past. There are a couple of occasions upon which the special effects look just a tad hokey, but the overall effect of the film is so magical that I'm not complaining. Indeed, I find it quite refreshing indeed to see a film follow the author's original words and scenes so faithfully; there were minor adjustments to the story along the way, and in a couple of cases the changes actually proved more effective than the original scene would have played on the big screen. The cast is excellent up and down the line. Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter as far as I'm concerned, but I was even more impressed by Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley and Emma Watson (my favorite) as the incomparable Hermione Granger. Richard Harris' brilliant performance as Albus Dumbledore will be sorely missed in future films. I would be remiss to forget Robbie Coltrane's critical contribution as the one and only Hagrid, but by far the most effective job is done by Alan Rickman, whose performance as Professor Snape ranks among the most impressive acting jobs I've ever seen.Everybody knows the plot of the movie by now. The only weakness in this epic production comes in the form of snippets and scenes from Rowling's novel that were not included - this is understandable, as the movie runs a good two and a half hours as it is. The ending seems to come up just a little short, yet it is quite enjoyable as it is. A few plot points that reveal more about some of the key characters can only be found in the book, but the fact that they are most important in terms of what they betoken for future novels and movies makes them a little less than crucial for this first Harry Potter motion picture. Overall, as a full-grown adult clinging to what few fancies of youth he has left, I have to say I loved every minute of this movie. Its commitment to Rowling's vision is to be commended, and there can be no doubt that there are bigger and better adventures yet to come in both book and movie form.The DVD features are, at least to a certain point, rather fun to mess around with, but they probably appeal more to young people than adults. I for one began to grow a little bored after touring Hogwarts, but the fact is that anything on top of the movie itself is just a bonus. I've watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone several times now, and I have enjoyed it greatly each and every time.",5,"A faithful, bedazzling adaptation of Rowling's novel",1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,3090,"['really', 'quite', 'amazing', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'not', 'only', 'remained', 'very', 'faithful', 'indeed', 'Rowling', 'original', 'novel', 'actually', 'succeeded', 'very', 'well', 'recreating', 'magical', 'scenery', 'extraordinary', 'environment', 'Hogwarts', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'whole', 'fantastic', 'fact', 'obvious', 'Harry', 'first', 'entrance', 'Great', 'Hall', 'Most', 'amazing', 'may', 'be', 'spectacular', 'presentation', 'game', 'Quidditch', 'almost', 'Rowling', 'descriptions', 'novel', 'come', 'leaping', 'off', 'page', 'little', 'difficult', 'get', 'real', 'picture', 'Quidditch', 'one', 'head', 'thanks', 'movie', 'days', 'struggling', 'really', 'visualize', 'game', 'played', 'are', 'thing', 'past', 'are', 'couple', 'occasions', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'just', 'tad', 'hokey', 'overall', 'effect', 'film', 'so', 'magical', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'Indeed', 'find', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'indeed', 'see', 'film', 'author', 'original', 'words', 'scenes', 'so', 'faithfully', 'were', 'minor', 'adjustments', 'story', 'way', 'couple', 'cases', 'changes', 'actually', 'proved', 'more', 'effective', 'original', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'big', 'screen', 'cast', 'excellent', 'up', 'line', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Ronald', 'Weasley', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'favorite', 'incomparable', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'missed', 'future', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'forget', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'critical', 'contribution', 'one', 'only', 'Hagrid', 'far', 'most', 'effective', 'job', 'done', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'performance', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'most', 'impressive', 'acting', 'jobs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Everybody', 'plot', 'movie', 'now', 'only', 'weakness', 'epic', 'production', 'form', 'snippets', 'scenes', 'Rowling', 'novel', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'understandable', 'movie', 'good', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'ending', 'come', 'up', 'just', 'little', 'short', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'few', 'plot', 'points', 'reveal', 'more', 'key', 'characters', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'book', 'fact', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'terms', 'what', 'betoken', 'future', 'novels', 'movies', 'little', 'less', 'crucial', 'first', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'motion', 'picture', 'Overall', 'full-grown', 'adult', 'clinging', 'what', 'few', 'fancies', 'youth', 'left', 'have', 'say', 'loved', 'minute', 'movie', 'commitment', 'Rowling', 'vision', 'be', 'commended', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', 'are', 'bigger', 'better', 'adventures', 'yet', 'come', 'book', 'movie', 'form.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'least', 'certain', 'point', 'rather', 'fun', 'mess', 'probably', 'appeal', 'more', 'young', 'people', 'adults', 'one', 'began', 'grow', 'little', 'bored', 'touring', 'Hogwarts', 'fact', 'anything', 'top', 'movie', 'just', 'bonus', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'several', 'times', 'now', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'greatly', 'time']",N/A

So let me explain myself. The director's adaptation was weak at best, and left the true Harry Potter fans wishing for more.  Who is Hermione Granger, where does she come from, how about Draco Malfoy,  all we know is that Hermione and Harry are friends and Draco and Harry are not.  Why does Draco hate Hermione and Ron so much?  There are so many plot holes you could drive a fleet of Mack trucks through them.  Yes I know that there are going to be a lot more movies coming out and they have to introduce the characters slower than in the books, but still they should have provided a background of some of the students.With that said the acting was only ok.  Very rarely could I even sense the hatred that Draco Malfoy has for Hermione and Ron, and feelings that Harry, Ron, and Harry have for Snape and Malfoy.  Granted the acting is done primarily by children, so hopefully with time they will become better at staying in character and following character true to the books. Stone is so recent that the majority of moviegoers have read the book, and Stone leaves out quite a bit of information and skips very good scenes. Because of this Harry Potter die hard fans did not like the movie.  Also the special effects team had a great opportunity to impress the audience through the Quidditch matches, however it was too short, and in all honestly didn't look real.  My desire and the desire of many is to actually feel what it would be like to ride a broomstick and dive for the golden snitch!

525461,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B00003CXI0,D. A. Reed,"[0, 0]","The first film adaptation of J.K. Rowling's popular books. I like it but it feels overly long. In one of the few movies with a primarily young cast that actually have brilliant performances, each capturing the essence of the characters from the books. The leads are definitely the highlights of the film and have continued to get better. What helps I think is that they're surrounded by vetern actors Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters etc. much like Christopher Reeve was in the first Superman. My main complaint on what keeps this from getting a full five stars is that the director is trying to literally adapt the book. True there are sections and characters missing like Peeves the Poltergeist, the sub-plot of Ron (or someone else, I can't remember exactly who right now) telling Neville to stand up for himself (which would explain why he stands up to the threesome near the end but I guess not wanting his house to lose anymore points is a good enough reason) and the midnight duel with Malfoy, which in the book, leads Harry and the others to Fluffy, not walking in there by mistake after the staircase changes. But some scenes could've been trimmed. The Quidditch scene, Harry and Ron being late for Transfiguration and the goblins scene in Gringotts. I think they could've just cut to Harry and Hagrid arriving at his vault after Hagrid points and tells Harry about the wizarding bank but then again that's just my opinion. John Williams provides the music again and its good but I think its not up to his usual quality like the other films of his I've reviewed. I know he's going for the fantasy aspect in some cues but I just don't like it. Even the actions sequences feel boring.

525479,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00003CXI0,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","Under Chris Columbus' masterful direction, with an appropriate score by John Williams--the theme song being a creeping waltz that has that ""once upon a time in a haunted castle"" expression about it, the inaugural film of J.K. Rowling's beloved young wizard--vividly brought to life by the perfectly cast 11-year-old Daniel Radcliffe--takes flight.I fondly recall the initial photo of the trio of the film's young leads when they were first introduced to the world, and how everyone cooed over them. They did not fail to live up to expectations, and in fact surpassed them!The story begins one evening in the fictional English neighborhood of Little Whinging in the town of Surrey, where a wizened old wizard named Albus Dumbledore(the incomparable Richard Harris, fulfilling his granddaughter's wish that he play the role)uses a magical device called a deluminator to draw light from the area's streetlamps as he waits with anticipation an arrival of great significance. He pauses to acknowledge the presence of another professor of their school--the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--named Minerva McGonagall (the equally incomparable Dame Maggie Smith)who transfigures from cat to human, and consults Dumbledore about a recent tragic event.Coming forth from catastrophy, bundled in the flying motorcycle of a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane)is a sleeping one-year-old infant with a jagged scar on his forehead, whom the three deposit on a residential doorstep despite McGonagall's misgivings.Ten years later, we find the young Harry Potter, an orphaned ward of his abusive and neglectful Aunt Petunia(Fiona Shaw), and Uncle Vernon Dursley( Richard Griffiths), and their spoiled, ill-bred son Dudley(Harry Melling)on Dudley's birthday. Relegated to a room in a cupboard under the stairs of his guardians' home on Privet Drive, as well as to cast-off and ill-fitting clothing, Harry is the servant of the family who prepares and serves the meals while Dudley has no responsibilities, all the priviledges, and mistreats his cousin, who has remained sweet, self effacing,polite, and unbroken, just as his parents do.But this boy's version of a Cinderella story begins to take an unusual turn when the family visit the zoo on Dudley's birthday, and Harry personally empathizes with the confinement of the zoo's boa constrictor, beginning to chat with the snake, who understands him, and mysteriously escapes from his glass enclosure, while, to Harry's amusement, Dudley ends up trapped in the enclosure.It is one of many moments when the crinkled bright-eyed beam of the tremulous and beautiful youngster lights up the screen.Shoved back into the cupboard as punishment for Dudley's humiliation after coming home,  Harry is soon deprived even of a mysterious piece of mail that arrives for him, when his uncle cruelly burns it in front of him.But even on Sunday, the letters keep coming as mysterious owls congregate on the Dursley's front lawn. Letters for Harry flood the house, and the Dursleys vainly attempt to evade them by fleeing to an island lighthouse.But Harry's call of destiny will not go unanswered.Hagrid confronts the Dursleys there on Harry's eleventh birthday, and the boy learns the truth about his background as a wizard, as well as the reasons why his aunt, who was jealous of her dead sister, could never love him.Gradually he learns the truth of his parents' death as well. For commandeering the birthday cake Hagrid brought for Harry, Hagrid gives Dudley a pig's tail.The journey towards a new life begins under Hagrid's supervision.Harry leaves with the formidable stranger who delivered him to the Dursleys as an infant, and the two travel to Diagon Alley, where they shop for Harry's school supplies, unlike any in the Muggle world. The go to Gringott's Bank where Harry learns of the vast wealth his parents left him.In a pub, Hagrid introduces the boy to many who know him and are glad to meet him, including the turbaned Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Quirrel(Ian Hart), who will prove to be two-faced in more ways than one.After Mr. Ollivander( John Hurt) sells Harry a wand, Hagrid reveals why Harry is famous, and the details of his parents' deaths at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort, whose name wizards avoid speaking.Soon Hagrid leaves Harry, his luggage, including his new pet owl, Hedwig, at the King's Cross Train Station, emphasizing the importance of sticking to his ticket.Unable to get Muggle assistance in finding Platform 9 3/4,  a chance encounter with a family of redheads, namely the Weasleys, helps him transport through the barrier.Molly Weasley(Julie Walters) tells Harry her son Ron( 12-year old Rupert Grint),is a first-year student as well.Soon Harry celebrates his new life by entertaining his new friend, buying all the magical candy on the cart offered to them, which is enjoyed by Ron's rat Scabbers as well.An imperious young girl, assisting in the search for a missing frog comes by.She is the Muggle-born intellectual, Hermione Granger(10-year-old Emma Watson with a face full of baby fat),who critiques Ron's unsuccessful attempt at casting a spell, but is more impressed by Harry.Clad in robes and uniforms, the first-year students disembark, and are guided to the boats by Hagrid, which sail magically to the castle that is Hogwarts.Professor McGonagall leads the newcomers to the great hall. As they wait to enter, Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton), introduces himself to Harry, but fails to secure his friendship due to his slighting of Ron.The other fateful decison Harry faces is which of the four houses in which to be sorted: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Learning  that Voldemort was a Slytherin alumnus, and seeing Malfoy sorted in to that house, Harry successfully pleads with the Sorting Hat(Leslie Phillips) to placed anyhwhere but Slytherin, and he joins Hermione and the Weasleys in Gryffindor, where his parents were also placed.After dinner(during which John Cleese cameos as Gryffindor House Ghost, Nearly Headless Nick), the students are led amid paintings with moving figures, and changing staircases to their respective houses.While his roomates sleep, including Seamus Finnegan(Devon Murray), Neville Longbottom(Matthew Lewis, who found his  missing frog, Trevor), as well as Ron, Harry contemplates his new life,  the suddenness of  change, and of experiencing more wonders in a day than a boy's imagination can hold.Together, he and Ron face a reprimand for being late to McGonagall's class and witness her tranfiguration  in the process,they take flying lessons from Madame Hooch(Zoe Wanamaker), resulting in Harry's being placed on the Quidditch team as his father once was for an unexpected display of skill, and along with Hermione, have that now iconic moment of encountering a three-headed dog named Fluffy.Perturbed by Hermione's besting everyone in Flitwick's(Warwick Davis) Levitation class, Ron expresses his annoyance with Hermione. But when the three take on a mountain troll in the girl's bathroom in one hilarious scene, the friendship is permanently sealed.We will watch Harry develop as a wizard with the help of his knowledgable young friends, finding encouragement from other mentors including Quidditch captain, Oliver Ward (Sean Biggerstaff), under whose guidance he triumphs in his first match.The three wizard detectives will see Harry saved from Voldemort by the Centaur, Firenze(Ray Fearon) in the Forbidden Forest, and gain clues about the Sorcerer's stone, which they discover Fluffy to be guarding, its maker, the actual historical figure Nicholas Flamel, and what the mysterious Professor Severus Snape(Alan Rickman) is trying to do with it.Intellect counts greatly with these three, and it is moving to see the once neglected orphan find joy in the recipience of a Christmas present, albeit the unusual Invisibility Cloak, and to be in a place where he is better clad in beautifully vibrant and complimentary monochromatic knits, better fed, and cared for than he has been in ten years.An encounter with the Mirror of Eiresed gives him a chance to confront his longing for his dead parents.In addition to capturing the vibrant colors for which frequently rain soaked Britain is known,Director of Photography John Seal sharply flatters his beautiful young subjects, notably in one scene where the warmly clad hero walks across a snowy courtyard with his feathery friend and lets her fly into spring.In due time, Hagrid unintentionally drops enough clues about the Sorcerer's Stone, and how to get past Fluffy.The three are very much up to the challenge of preventing the stone's theft, although they have to get past Neville to do so.Using previously, as well as newly acquired skills, they work their way down until it is Harry who confronts the villian , and is made aware of the influence of Voldemort in a dangerous and dramatic encounter, after which Dumbledore explains to the boy how his mother's sacrificial love for him continues to protect him.Harry will now probably better endure his homelife because from here on in, he will spend most of his life in a place where although quite perilous,he is loved, admired,and validated.Despite some inconsistancies with the book,great justice has been done to Rowling's modern epic tale that will have everyone cheering for the young musketeers with wands, the triumph of courage and virtue, and for the scarlet and the gold for generations to come!",5,A Place of Validation,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,9460,"['Chris', 'Columbus',

Well that's just it, I havn't got the faintest idea. The visual effects were nice to look at at points, but the children's acting is simply put, atrocious. Every other line the kids spoke was either a stupid line to begin with or it was delivered horribly, seriously people, this is supposed to be an adventure fantasy not a school play. I actually don't hold the children (who are in truth good actors) at fault for this film, I hold mostly the director responsible, he didn't push the actors like he should have, he took a decent screenplay and truned into childish mush, he took a good concept and made one of the corniest films possible out of it.The single thing Chris Columbus did right on this film was the cinematography, there were beautiful shots of the school of magic it was all simply put, gorgeous (which is the only reason I didn't give this film one star).I first saw this film when I was in the hospital after having my appendix taken out, I sat back and I breathed in, I WAS FINALLY GOING TO SEE THE WORLD RENOUNED HARRY POTTER (yippie)!......... (oh no), I must say I was forgiving of the film when I first saw it, but then again I had just had a ton of morphine pumped into me. Let it be known, after this I decided to read the book, I decided to give this film another fighting chance, ........ (OH NO) It was even worse when you read the book beforehand! The book, which I could take seriously, had been destroyed by super corny directing! Super stupid bad guys! Super over-acting. UrghLet's face it, Harry Potter is a fairly easy film to pull off, I meanc ome on. The book doesn't go into Harry's inner thoughts at all, the story has a fairly typical (and hideous) villains, the story is the same as always with the things (The main adventurous male character, the super smart female, and the not so smart bumble secondary male character). Yet Coloumbus couldn't even pull those super simple characters off right, Harry himself was virtually emotionless the entire film!As a whole, disappointing, but don't let that get you down, some the future installments aint half bad.......",2,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,2249,"['Ah', 'yes', 'well', 'acclaimed', 'expensive', 'first', 'part', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'saga', 'Ah', 'yes', 'might', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'so', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Well', 'just', 'hav', ""n't"", 'got', 'faintest', 'idea', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'nice', 'look', 'points', 'children', 'acting', 'simply', 'put', 'atrocious', 'other', 'line', 'kids', 'spoke', 'was', 'stupid', 'line', 'begin', 'was', 'delivered', 'horribly', 'seriously', 'people', 'supposed', 'be', 'adventure', 'fantasy', 'not', 'school', 'play', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'truth', 'good', 'actors', 'fault', 'film', 'hold', 'mostly', 'director', 'responsible', 'did', ""n't"", 'push', 'actors', 'should', 'have', 'took', 'decent', 'screenplay', 'truned', 'childish', 'mush', 'took', 'good', 'concept', 'made', 'one', 'corniest', 'films', 'possible', 'it.The', 'single', 'thing', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'did', 'right', 'film', 'was', 'cinematography', 'were', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'school', 'magic', 'was', 'simply', 'put', 'gorgeous', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'one', 'star', '.I', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'hospital', 'having', 'appendix', 'taken', 'out', 'sat', 'back', 'breathed', 'WAS', 'FINALLY', 'GOING', 'TO', 'SEE', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'RENOUNED', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'yippie', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'forgiving', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'then', 'again', 'had', 'just', 'had', 'ton', 'morphine', 'pumped', 'Let', 'be', 'known', 'decided', 'read', 'book', 'decided', 'give', 'film', 'fighting', 'chance', '..', 'OH', 'NO', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'beforehand', 'book', 'could', 'take', 'seriously', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'super', 'corny', 'directing', 'Super', 'stupid', 'bad', 'guys', 'Super', 'over-acting', 'UrghLet', 'face', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fairly', 'easy', 'film', 'pull', 'off', 'meanc', 'ome', 'book', ""n't"", 'go', 'Harry', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'story', 'fairly', 'typical', 'hideous', 'villains', 'story', 'same', 'always', 'things', 'main', 'adventurous', 'male', 'character', 'super', 'smart', 'female', 'not', 'so', 'smart', 'bumble', 'secondary', 'male', 'character', 'Coloumbus', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'pull', 'super', 'simple', 'characters', 'off', 'right', 'Harry', 'was', 'virtually', 'emotionless', 'entire', 'film', 'whole', 'disappointing', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'down', 'future', 'installments', 'aint', 'half', 'bad']",N/A

When one accepts this and focuses on the content of the movie, I don't think you can help but be pretty impressed with it.

Here is some help: For the most part in any DVD, the Wide Screen or ""Letterbox"" version is supposed to ""PRESERVE"" the aspect version that you saw at the movies. ""Harry Potter"" versions were probably filmed using 1.18:1 aspect ratio, but Warner Bros Pictures used a 2.35:1 aspect ratio to transfer to the widescreen DVD.  This is good for the new widescreen tvs, but, this also cheats you out of this movies' integrity; whereas it deletes both the top and bottom portions of the original film. Some movies are SHOT in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and you usually do not lose anything with those - (why couldn't they just do the 1.18:1 aspect ratio as it was meant to be seen?) For purists, it's fine for the new television monitors and tvs, but I would prefer the full top to bottom view of the actors and things that they are holding and the hand movements.The TV or the ""Full Screen"" version, (Still not 1.18:1 aspect ratio but shows the bowl being pushed on the table by Hagrid), was meant to fit on a regular TV screen. Here, little portions are lost in the left side of the film.

525493,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00003CXI0,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 2]","I've never read the Harry Potter books, nor ever had an urge too upon their popular release.  I gave the films a try and I must say that this is far better than I expected.  I can now see why the series is so popular.  I still haven't read the books only becuase I don't want it to ruin the movies that I love so much, casue there is bound to be continuity issues, common with most novel to film releases.  Though the Sorcerer's Stone is a great film, it is very mild for where the series is headed.  Each Potter adventure grows darker and more dangerous, but the first film is rather easy going overall.  Indeed, this is a fun film that people of all ages will enjoy, and is great for the kids.After seeing the latest Potter film - Order of the Phoenix - it is quite a surprise to come back to see where it all began.  Naturally, the young actors look so much younger, and its fun to see where they had come from, both in terms of age as actors and their characters - specifically referring to Harry, Ron, and Hermoine.  As with most series, the first is an introduction.  Since the Potter films were already pre-written into glorious novels, each book carried its own story.  So yes, this is an introduction to the Potter series, but at the same time it is a story about the Sorcerer's Stone, just like the next film is a tale about the Chamber of Secrets and the next etc.  Though entertaining and enjoyable, I did not find the Sorcerer's Stone to be the most intriguing story thus far in the series, in fact, its more likely the least favorite of mine, but that's ok.  Its still good, but the stories get better in each new film.Sorcerer's Stone is very well made, complete with great sets, amazing costumes, lovebale and admirable characters, and plenty of good ol magic and flying brooms to go around.  If you are at all familiar with the game of Quidditch, it is not only introduced here, but a game is focused on more than any of the films thus far - complete with intense scenes of action and sport.If you are still one of the few who have not seen Harry Potter, go ahead and give it a try - chances are you are bound to find something that holds you're interest.  It is a great tale of suspense and adventure with a variety of great characters.  If you've seen all the films, I will remind you how much fun it is to go back and start all over again just to see how far we've come.Acting - 4.5Action - 3.5Characters - 5Story - 4Overall - 4.5",4,[4.5] Come and see where it all began,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,2450,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'ever', 'had', 'urge', 'too', 'popular', 'release', 'gave', 'films', 'try', 'must', 'say', 'far', 'better', 'expected', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'why', 'series', 'so', 'popular', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'only', 'becuase', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'movies', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'casue', 'bound', 'be', 'continuity', 'issues', 'common', 'most', 'novel', 'film', 'releases', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'mild', 'where', 'series', 'headed', 'Potter', 'adventure', 'darker', 'more', 'dangerous', 'first', 'film', 'rather', 'easy', 'going', 'overall', 'Indeed', 'fun', 'film', 'people', 'ages', 'will', 'enjoy', 'great', 'kids.After', 'seeing', 'latest', 'Potter', 'film', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'quite', 'surprise', 'come', 'back', 'see', 'where', 'began', 'Naturally', 'young', 'actors', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'younger', 'fun', 'see', 'where', 'had', 'come', 'terms', 'age', 'actors', 'characters', 'specifically', 'referring', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermoine', 'most', 'series', 'first', 'introduction', 'Potter', 'films', 'were', 'already', 'pre-written', 'glorious', 'novels', 'book', 'carried', 'own', 'story', 'So', 'yes', 'introduction', 'Potter', 'series', 'same', 'time', 'story', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'just', 'next', 'film', 'tale', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'next', 'etc', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'be', 'most', 'intriguing', 'story', 'thus', 'far', 'series', 'fact', 'more', 'likely', 'least', 'favorite', 'mine', 'ok.', 'still', 'good', 'stories', 'get', 'better', 'new', 'film.Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'complete', 'great', 'sets', 'amazing', 'costumes', 'lovebale', 'admirable', 'characters', 'plenty', 'good', 'ol', 'magic', 'flying', 'brooms', 'go', 'around', 'are', 'familiar', 'game', 'Quidditch', 'not', 'only', 'introduced', 'here', 'game', 'focused', 'more', 'films', 'thus', 'far', 'complete', 'intense', 'scenes', 'action', 'sport.If', 'are', 'still', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'go', 'ahead', 'give', 'try', 'chances', 'are', 'are', 'bound', 'find', 'something', ""'re"", 'interest', 'great', 'tale', 'suspense', 'adventure', 'variety', 'great', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'will', 'remind', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'go', 'back', 'start', 'over', 'again', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come.Acting', '4.5Action', '3.5Characters', '5Story', '4Overall', '4.5']",N/A

Any person of any age is highly encouraged to give these books a read--the only danger is that you'll likely get hooked on them.Of course, this review is about the movie, not about the book... and the movie is... decent. It is a fairly faithful adaptation, but doesn't quite capture the charm or depth of the novel. It feels as though two mistakes were made: 1) They tried to put everything in; 2) They tried to make it a kid's movie.The first mistake was in trying to put everything that occurs in the book in the movie. In the first place, it was an impossible task--you can't fit a book that size completely into a movie, and you shouldn't try anyways because books and movies are different media with different strengths and weaknesses. In the second place, it makes the movie feel incredibly rushed. In the book, we eventually come to know and love a great many of these characters, such as Harry, Ron and Hermione. In the movie (unless you've already read the book), you'll know them a little bit, but you never get to spend the time with them necessary to really bond, because we need to save space for the next sequence of events. Things happen with little context, rhyme or reason, but just because ""it happened that way in the book."" It would have been better to cut out some of the events, and spent a little more time developing characters.The second mistake was in trying to make this a children's film. Now, I know what you're saying: ""But *isn't* Harry Potter a children's book?"" And yes, it is. And no, it isn't. Harry Potter is a book that can appeal to any age. It does not read like ""kid's lit""--the writing is intelligent and clever, and the plotlines fairly adult and complicated. Children were going to love this movie no matter how it was directed; it should have been done more seriously, because it would have been more true to the tone of the novel and more rewarding for adult fans.On the other side, this movie is still enjoyable, and all signs seem to suggest that the series of films is going to get better over time. The casting is absolutely brilliant--the kids are all spot on, and nothing brings more delight than Alan Rickman as Professor Snape.Being a lover of the books, I say that this film is a decent interpretation but no substitute for reading the novels. Adults especially who haven't read them, and watch this movie instead, are apt to scratch their heads in wonder a little bit at the popularity of Harry Potter.",3,"Three Stars for Adults, Four for Kids (Five for the Book, for Anyone)",1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,2576,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'wonderful', 'book', 'beginning', 'truly', 'magical', 'series', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'Any', 'person', 'age', 'highly', 'encouraged', 'give', 'books', 'read', 'only', 'danger', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'get', 'hooked', 'them.Of', 'course', 'review', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'movie', 'decent', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'charm', 'depth', 'novel', 'two', 'mistakes', 'were', 'made', '1', 'tried', 'put', 'everything', '2', 'tried', 'make', 'kid', 'movie.The', 'first', 'mistake', 'was', 'trying', 'put', 'everything', 'book', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'impossible', 'task', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fit', 'book', 'size', 'completely', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'try', 'anyways', 'books', 'movies', 'are', 'different', 'media', 'different', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'second', 'place', 'movie', 'feel', 'incredibly', 'rushed', 'book', 'eventually', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'great', 'many', 'characters', 'such', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'already', 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'never', 'get', 'spend', 'time', 'necessary', 'really', 'bond', 'need', 'save', 'space', 'next', 'sequence', 'events', 'Things', 'happen', 'little', 'context', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'just', 'happened', 'way', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'cut', 'out', 'events', 'spent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'developing', 'characters.The', 'second', 'mistake', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'children', 'film', 'Now', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', ""*isn't*"", 'Harry', 'Potter', 'children', 'book', 'yes', ""n't"", 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', 'can', 'appeal', 'age', 'not', 'read', 'kid', 'lit', 'writing', 'intelligent', 'clever', 'plotlines', 'fairly', 'adult', 'complicated', 'Children', 'were', 'going', 'love', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'was', 'directed', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'seriously', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'true', 'tone', 'novel', 'more', 'rewarding', 'adult', 'fans.On', 'other', 'side', 'movie', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'signs', 'seem', 'suggest', 'series', 'films', 'going', 'get', 'better', 'time', 'casting', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'kids', 'are', 'spot', 'nothing', 'brings', 'more', 'delight', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Professor', 'Snape.Being', 'lover', 'books', 'say', 'film', 'decent', 'interpretation', 'substitute', 'reading', 'novels', 'Adults', 'especially', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'watch', 'movie', 'instead', 'are', 'apt', 'scratch', 'heads', 'wonder', 'little', 'bit', 'popularity', 'Harry', 'Potter']",N/A

However, while I still struggle to get through the reading, I must give the movie version 5 stars, as I'm completely fascinated and impressed with the amount of work put into its making.  From what I hear (from those who've finished the books), the movie has it's differences in certain plot parts, or has omitted parts that die-hard fans are up-in-arms about...but isn't the usually the case when a book goes to film?

It has an interesting self guided tour of Hogwarts Castle, but it sorely lacks the Director's Commentary and didn't really have much in the way of games and other extras for the kids. (which I believe is essential for a DVD).Scare Factor:It isn't scary, except for two scenes towards the end. These two scenes warrant concern for the young viewers (under 7 or 8);Also, the beginning of the movie shows Harry Potter being abused by his ""adopted parents"" (his aunt and uncle who force him to sleep locked in a closet under their stairs) and I really didn't like my young kids seeing that.

525502,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B00003CXI0,Draconis Blackthorne,"[3, 10]","The wonderous world of Harry Potter opens up through the enchanted pages of J.K. Rowling's books, as veritable grimoires masked in fictional charicatures, but demonstrating subtle magical principles. The books come to life in a veritable bibliomancy - the words vibrate, a Magical glow emminates therefrom, & the pictures come to brilliant life, jumping forth from the pages in dynamic enchanted exhuberance. And thus it has been for those who have enjoyed these wonderful works.These have served to stimulate, & sometimes even enhance the child-like Magic residing within - that charm personafied in animals & children, & preserved by The Magician.I have found this film a marvel to behold, although I feel it could have been twice the production had it been a tad darker, as the books have tended to be. Unfortunately, producers felt that the initial more gothicesque aesthetics would frighten children, to whom the film is primarily directed towards. But I question the excessive over-sheltering of children would only raise a populace of mollycoddles. Speaking for Myself on the left hand, I have always been attracted to the darkest subject matter since I was a very young child. The pervasive fascination for blood & gore in western society is due to the lack of real-life bloodletting spectacles, practices, & traditions in modern culture. In many societies, a boy was not considered a man until until he had killed his first prey in the hunt, or slain an enemy. Western Society compensates for this natural bloodlust with horror movies & documentaries, to stimulate that latently essential primal part of the psyche which remains far too under-stimulated.The first half of the movie seemed aesthetically darker, whereas the second half was a bit 'lighter', probably as a result of the puscillanimousness of Chris Columbus {who also directed ""Home Alone"" as an indication}. I believe a film of this callibre would have been better directed by the likes of Tim Burton, who has consistently brought forth the dark sides of the characters he has worked with, & created films of magnificent & gloriously gothic proportions, as Batman would be a major example; with a musickal score conducted instead by Danny Elfman, considering the current score unfortunately sounds rather tired & redundant - not one of John William's better works. It just seemed that he did not place too much effort into it, yet it still remains memorable, but so much more could have been done with it.I found the effects to be quite well done, concurrent with the descriptions in the book. There were several scnes which were curtailed for time, but I have a feeling the release of the video / DVD wil divulge many deleted scenes.A most poignant scene was towards the end, whcen Potter comes face to face with Voldemort, in which he states, ""There is no good or evil, only Power & those who seek it. Those who do not, are weak."" Quite a Satanic statement!The release of this movie will probably inspire some children to gain an interest in The Occult, & will create A.C.I.'s in many, & just may serve to open the door to self-realization in true infernal progeny yet unknown. A movie of this type I feel is timely, & necessitates ""popularity"" in this select case, to help contribute to that societal shift in the Satanic direction.Besides that one moment of the stating of Satanic fact, there is no weakan sactimony, no xian drivel, just plain fun ""witchcraft"" for the whole family.The idea of a ""School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"" does sound rather appealing {notice the distinction between the genders} - the closest thing we have to that is the homeschooling initiative which is espoused by most Satanists.

Was it worth seven bucks? Not to me...I needn't go over the plot--even I knew what the film was about after having so many strangers gush to me about the book like it gifted readers with magical abilities itself. The story was okay--a bit predictable, but it is a kid's book after all. The special effects were sometimes almost cool, often somewhat primitive compared with other fx-filled forms (for example, any scene where a kid gets shaken by broom or beast makes the kid look as loose as wet laundry and not very life-like at all...not to mention the rather poorly animated snake at the beginning, etc...) I was able to see where some religious groups could take offense to a few of the references, and though I found the picture quaint at best, I'll admit I probably would have loved this film if I'd seen it at age seven. This generation's Wizard Of Oz? Hardly. A bit scary for younger viewers, a bit boring for older, the only thing I really took a liking to was the real-live Wizard's Chess scene.

But.There is still but about this DVD. I was eager to get this and was delighted to read that it would be on 2 DVDs. I thought that the first disc would have a magnificent picture with Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and DTS ES tracks. It was a disappointment that it didn't include a DTS track, even though there seem to be space for it, since there are no audio commentary or other special features on the first disc. The picture was good with vibrant colors and the sound track was good too, but it lacked that extra dynamic sound that SO many DVDs lack, that almost all newer laserdiscs had (even on movies in mono sound).But I bought this movie mainly for the movie itself. The movie is magical in every way, with a virtually perfect cast. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry has just right amount of charm and charisma to make the character work on the big screen. Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith are just a few of the great English actors who star in this movie. I think this movie will endure for many years to come.Now for the negative side, the special features disc. It is true what other reviewers have said that it is made like a kid's game. I wanted to see the documentaries about the different aspects of the book to film process, but all it contained (or at least what I have found) was a 15 minute documentary that reminds me of the bad 'behind the scenes' programs on E! or other entertainment TV stations, that are shown when the movie is in the theaters and don't really say much. The documentary did say some, but it was all in bits and pieces.

525531,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXI0,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 1]","This film is an outstanding fantasy adventure film for kids from about seven through fifteen.  After that, its appeal drops off dramatically.  Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) does a fine job of bringing the wildly popular children's series to the big screen.Columbus had a difficult decision to make with the first film.  The introduction of Harry Potter requires a good deal of character and plot development, which isn't particularly interesting to those who aren't dedicated fans of the books.  Columbus chose to be true to the series and spent a lot of time doing background work that would be useful in later films (two more of which are already planned).  That encumbers this film a bit, weighing it down with details at the expense of plot pacing.  So, while this film is not as thrilling as it might have been, it sets the stage for more exciting sequels.From a technical perspective the film is marvelous.  The visual effects in this film are often astounding, especially the Quidditch match.  The cinematography is rich and dramatic, both the outdoor shots and those shot on the sets.  Columbus entices excellent performances out of the young and inexperienced cast members, but also works well with the veterans.The acting is fabulous.  Daniel Radcliffe is an excellent find as Harry.  He has a kind of nerdy coolness that is perfect for the part.  He comes across more as a regular kid trying to come to terms with special powers than a self important superhero type.  This is exactly the right balance.  Emma Watson, playing Hermione, is the consummate scene stealer and it is difficult to believe that this is her first feature film.  Watson packs a perky punch and has a wide array of facial expressions that often make dialogue completely superfluous.  Her self assurance and boldness provide the ideal contrast to Radcliffe's characterization of the timid and tentative Harry.The adult actors also represent themselves admirably.  Richard Harris and Maggie Smith provide steadying influences as Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.  Harris is almost unidentifiable under the flowing beard and robes, but his distinctive voice is unmistakable.  Smith is suitably stern and kind, showing she has a soft spot for Harry, but maintaining the authoritarian demeanor required of her position.  But the show stealer among the older actors is clearly Robbie Coltrane as the overly loquacious Hagrid (""I shouldn't have said that.  I should NOT have said that."")

But wannabe wizards and other fans of the century's first boxoffice phenomenon will find the DVD transfigures theatrical drawbacks into delights. While some multiplexes were incapable of delivering ""Potter's"" visual subtleties, the wand wavers at Warner conjure up a two-disc DVD set in which magical images replace most of the murk. Flesh tones that threatened to wash out hold their detail nicely, even by candlelight. Down-in-the-dungeon scenes exhibit an artful but still clammy blend of pale blues and blacks. The outdoors quiddich match scores with a handsome 3-D illusion. Royal reds, golds and Augusta greens saturate the screen throughout. Whites still seem unnatural at times. The Dolby Digital 5.1 EX audio (in English and Spanish) brings out the many muted lines of dialogue, allowing listeners to catch all of Headmaster Dumbledore's admonitions. (There is no DTS option.) The children's voices are clear; John Williams' signature score enjoys a sweeping soundstage. Rear effects seem like they could do a lot more - especially in the frenzied quiddich game.

525533,A38JWSLCF9AYOZ,B00003CXI0,Fluffy's Owner,"[2, 2]","I first saw this film when I was but 7 years old. Since then, I have watched the film many times, particularly during the last few years. Now I am 12, and still love it. I would rate this film 5 out of 5 stars. Since I (and know many people who agree with me) find there's nothing more irritating than a review that says, ""I love this item!"" without saying why, I'll try to explain why I would rate Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 5 stars. One reason (and a strong one, in my opinion) is the acting. I think they chose the perfect actors for the roles. For instance, Harry on screen looks exactly like I thought he would in the book. He also sounds like him exactly and says lines that are word for word from the book. I just think he's extremely ... Harry like. Hermione is first shown as a bossy know-it-all. Everyone I've met who's seen the film agrees that it's exactly like the book counterpart, but through perfect acting that doesn't grow stiff, we're shown that Hermione has a kinder, less bossy side to her. Ron and the whole Weasley family just ""seem"" like the Weasleys, for the same reasons I gave for Hermione and Harry. I don't know anyone who disagrees when I say that Snape was flawlessly cast and acted. The same is true for everyone else in the film. It all just feels very Harry Potter like. Another reason was that the film was extremely faithful to the book. It didn't try to improve on the book or have a completely different feel to it, therefore making it a much better film for that. It treated the book with respect. Another reason I can think of that this film merits 5 stars is that the film never drags. There is not a single moment that is too long in the film, in my opinion. For instance, how many people would guess that the Quidditch match in the middle of the film was 8 minutes long? Also, the whole 40 minutes until Harry gets to Hogwarts are fast but don't leave out anything. Once Harry's at Hogwarts, we spend our time taking in all the events that happen, making it seem like 10 minutes long instead of 150 minutes. Finally, the visuals are stunning. The castle looked exactly like Hogwarts was described in the book. The Forbidden Forest was menacing. The Hogwarts Express looked like a very comfortable train to be in. The ending is stupendous, as well, and very satisfying. Who doesn't cheer when Dumbledore awards the points taken away from Harry, Ron, and Hermione and even gives some to Neville. Those are some of the reasons why I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone earns its 5-star rating from me.",5,A 12-year-old's review,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,2560,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', '7', 'years', 'old', 'then', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'particularly', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Now', 'am', '12', 'still', 'love', 'would', 'rate', 'film', '5', '5', 'stars', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'agree', 'find', 'nothing', 'more', 'irritating', 'review', 'love', 'item', 'saying', 'why', ""'ll"", 'try', 'explain', 'why', 'would', 'rate', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', '5', 'stars', 'One', 'reason', 'strong', 'one', 'opinion', 'acting', 'think', 'chose', 'perfect', 'actors', 'roles', 'instance', 'Harry', 'screen', 'looks', 'exactly', 'thought', 'would', 'book', 'also', 'exactly', 'lines', 'are', 'word', 'word', 'book', 'just', 'think', 'extremely', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'first', 'shown', 'bossy', 'know-it-all', 'Everyone', ""'ve"", 'met', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'exactly', 'book', 'counterpart', 'perfect', 'acting', ""n't"", 'grow', 'stiff', ""'re"", 'shown', 'Hermione', 'kinder', 'less', 'bossy', 'side', 'Ron', 'whole', 'Weasley', 'family', 'just', 'seem', 'Weasleys', 'same', 'reasons', 'gave', 'Hermione', 'Harry', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'when', 'say', 'Snape', 'was', 'flawlessly', 'cast', 'acted', 'same', 'true', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'just', 'feels', 'very', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'reason', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'extremely', 'faithful', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'improve', 'book', 'have', 'completely', 'different', 'feel', 'therefore', 'making', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'treated', 'book', 'respect', 'reason', 'can', 'think', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'film', 'never', 'not', 'single', 'moment', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'opinion', 'instance', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'guess', 'Quidditch', 'match', 'middle', 'film', 'was', '8', 'minutes', 'long', 'Also', 'whole', '40', 'minutes', 'Harry', 'Hogwarts', 'are', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'anything', 'Once', 'Harry', 'Hogwarts', 'spend', 'time', 'taking', 'events', 'happen', 'making', 'seem', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'instead', '150', 'minutes', 'Finally', 'visuals', 'are', 'stunning', 'castle', 'looked', 'exactly', 'Hogwarts', 'was', 'described', 'book', 'Forbidden', 'Forest', 'was', 'menacing', 'Hogwarts', 'Express', 'looked', 'very', 'comfortable', 'train', 'be', 'ending', 'stupendous', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'satisfying', 'Who', ""n't"", 'cheer', 'when', 'Dumbledore', 'points', 'taken', 'away', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'even', 'Neville', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'think', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', '5-star', 'rating']",N/A

I think it's an excellent adaption and a wonderful story with stunning visual effects and some great music.10-year-old Harry Potter is leading a difficult life.  His parents died when he was a baby and his only remaining family members (Unlce Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley) treat him liek some cockroach that's wandered into their house.  1 day, on Harry's 11th birthday, he recieve a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Well, of course he goes to find out that he's famous for the defeat of a dark wizard, Voldemort.  Voldemort came to their houser, killed Harry's parents and tried to kill Harry too.  But, Harry destroyed his powers and Voldemort (unintentionally, of course) transferred some of his powers to Harry.  On his way to Hogwarts, he meets Romn Weasly and Hermione Granger.  They all have the displeasure to be associated with Dracoy Malfoy and his two henchmen, Crabbe and Goyle.  Then, on top of that, he shows extrordinary talent on a broomstick and becomes the youngest seeker for any Quidditch team in centuries.  He also learns that not everybody at Hogwarts worshops him day and night.  Severus Snape, Argus Filch, and his cat Mrs. Norris all take a disliking to him.  It's not really just Harry with Filch and Mrs. Norris, they just like to wage war with the students and the poltergeist, Peeves.  Harry begins to ponder over Snape and Quirrel's (the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher) strange behavior.  A strong desikre to see his parents again is finally manifested in Harry and he gets his wish when he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows the deepest and darkest desires of our heart.  Later on, he discovers that Hogwarts is hiding the Sorcerer's Stone which contains the Elixer of Life.  So, when he Ron, and Hermione, go down there... well I won't tell you that.The books are much more detailed and describe much more.  These movies are great and all, but they sometimes feels rushed and this one is no exception.  The scene where they arrive at Hogwarts is so d**n rushed it feels like a time warp.  In addition to that, Dumbledore slows things down to the point of feeling like you've gone back to the day you were born.  I liked the way Dumbledore was potrayed though.

525540,ACVJESFIQT8P8,B00003CXI0,"gandalfcmk ""gandalfcmk""","[1, 1]","For a lot of reasons, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is probably a tempting movie to criticize. After all, there is almost nothing a critic hates more than a film that is practically - baring some unforgivable act of gross incompetence - a guaranteed success, despite anything he or she might happen to write about it.At any rate, while some may quibble with the notion that Sorcerer's Stone is too much like the book that inspired it, the upside for moviegoers is that neither Rowling nor director Christopher Columbus have forgotten the film's primary audience: young readers between the ages of 12 - 16. For those whose parents read the book to them, the age may actually drop a bit below that.For the most part, as every parent knows, it is an audience frequently patronized with the worst sort of infantile pap imaginable, sometimes inundated with coarse language and gratuitous violence, or simply ignored altogether. Columbus, to his credit, does none of the above. In remaining true to his audience, Columbus has, in fact, delivered a film for all of us.It is obvious Columbus knows, for instance, that a young audience wants to see on the screen what it read in the book. In pursuit of this goal, Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves have fashioned characters and settings true to the letter and the spirit of the novel. The characters, especially, strike just the right chord of familiarity. Certainly, we all know that familiarity can wander over the line into disinterested comfort. Remarkably, the characters in Sorcerer's Stone never do. Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid, for instance, looks just as we expect him to. More important, he radiates a warmth and trust that serves as a secure anchor in those moments when events seem to be spinning out of control. As good as Hagrid is in the book, Coltrane's Hagrid is more vivid on the screen.Which brings us to the performance of Daniel Radcliffe in the role of Harry Potter. At first glance, Radcliffe seems reticent and withdrawn, hidden behind a gauze curtain, an uncertain hero. Yet we cannot forget that Harry Potter is an eleven year-old orphan whose parents have been murdered. He is a foundling whose caretakers resent his existence and actively disapprove of everything he is and, worse, in their own eyes, everything he will become. He is forced to sleep in a closet under the stairs and absorb a constant stream of verbal and physical abuse from his malevolent aunt and uncle and their overindulged son, Dudley.Yes, of course Harry is withdrawn. Small wonder. Or, as my daughter would say, ""Duh!""In fact, Radcliffe's performance is entirely consistent with Harry's history and upbringing, and Columbus has wisely ensured that, as the chronicle of films progresses, the character of Harry has somewhere to go. There are, after all, six movies still to come. Columbus has clearly determined that, unlike some other celluloid heroes of recent memory (Indiana Jones springs to mind), the character of Harry Potter should have some room to develop, otherwise both the young wizard and his friends would grow quickly stagnant.Another notable attribute of the film is that the atmosphere and setting, through the more subtle elements of special effects, are beautifully realized. As the first-years are journeying across the lake, their - and our - first view of Hogwarts Castle is absolutely breathtaking, a spectacular, gothic memory from a medieval dream. Inside the castle are stairways that move, pictures that talk and go about their daily routines, and a splendid dining hall that evokes the grandeur of a cathedral. When the Sorting Hat pronounces ""GRIFFINDORE"" on this opulent stage, Harry's adventures officially begin.Yes, the adventure has its obvious, special effects masterpieces. The Quidditch match is a high-flying, fast-paced extravaganza of soccer, polo, and basketball on broomsticks. The chess match is the high point of the film. At the same time, there are special effects so well done that they don't draw attention to themselves. The messenger owls flying gracefully into the dining hall to deliver envelopes and parcels is a brief, finely structured, aerial ballet that is easy to take for granted because we are momentarily suspended in the world of Hogwarts and have willingly cast aside our powers of disbelief.

525542,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00003CXI0,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[14, 17]","J.K. Rowling's novels have been such a phenomenal success that the film version of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE had a built-in audience that had to be pleased--and director Chris Columbus set out to do precisely that by cramming as much of the book as possible onto the screen.  The result is a fast-paced film with arresting visuals and plenty of special effects.  But while it looks magnificent, it doesn't really capture the novel upon which it is based.The problem, of course, is that Columbus and company have crammed so many of the book's details into the film that there's not much time for either story or character development: we're too busy looking at owls, shifting stairs, and the like, and it becomes somewhat difficult to keep track of the main story line and the numerous characters who support it.  Fortunately, the cast is strong enough to carry it off--the young Emma Watson is particularly enjoyable, and the main characters are supported by a host of distinctive actors whose memorable faces help keep us more or less on track.Ultimately... it is a fun film, very enjoyable for adults as well as children, and you'll probably watch it several times over and enjoy it each time.  But it does not live up to its billing as &quot;the event film that doesn't disappoint,&quot; nor is it really imaginative enough to be considered &quot;the Wizard of Oz of this generation.&quot;  The second DVD has a number of add-ons designed largely for the younger set (some of them require a computer) that they will enjoy; there is little in the way of special material for the grown-ups.

525543,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B00003CXI0,General Breadbasket,"[2, 2]","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the first film in a seven film series, based on the first Harry Potter book of the same name by J.K. Rowling.The film, like the book, sees young Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) receive an invitation to Hogwarts School of Wizardy and Witchcraft, discover that he's a wizard's child and gets caught up in the mystery of a strange package, a bank robbery, a forbidden third floor and suspicious teachers, along with his two newfound friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).In the world of Harry Potter, illustrations, paintings and photographs move. I like to think of this film the same way. Rather than be a stand alone film, I see this film as a visual companion to the book, moving pictures that give you an idea of what everything in and around Hogwarts looks like, (like what being in a building full of moving stairways actually looks like, for instance) giving the fictional world just a bit more depth. It's not as if the film would be completly alienating to newcomers, not at all, its just that if I hadn't read the book beforehand, I'm sure I would have found things a bit harder to follow, as things move fairly quickly and there's an ever thickening plot to keep an eye on.Everything looks great, and pretty much everybody is cast well. I particularly liked the choice of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I quite liked the fact that Warwick Davis (of ""Willow"" and ""Leprechaun"" fame) got a double role in this film, both as a banker of Gringotts and as Harry's charms teacher, Professor Flitwick. I reckon Warwick should do a film where he's a whole bunch of characters one day, it'd be great!Fans of the book will notice that a couple of plot elements have been combined, making it easier to follow. Take, the baby dragon subplot, for instance. It needs to be taken home. In the book, Ron's brother's friends take it home to Romania, but in this film, Dumbledore does this, snipping out the book's reason for his absence. It's understandable they did this, and its not terribly major.Included with this DVD is an extra disc of special features, that plays a bit like a DVD remote controlled point and click game. There are seven deleted scenes from the film to watch, but you'll have to work for it, going from virtual room to virtual room within Hogwarts School. Can you find the Philosopher's Stone that will turn menus to cutting room gold? If you don't have the patience for DVD games, there's plenty of other stuff to look at, including a virtual tour of Hagrid's cabin and the Gryffindor Common Room, a ""Catch the Snitch"" game and explanation of Quidditch, various montages of all your favourite characters, conceptual sketches, clickable every flavour beans to ""eat"", and an interview with director Chris Columbus and the producer of the film, David Heyman.Definitely worth a look, though I'd definitely read the novel first.

525554,A1Y1YRO74S6ELA,B00003CXI0,"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames""","[3, 3]","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone one of the best fantasy films i've seen, but one of the best films of 2001. when it premiered, the film broke box office records grossing over $100 million in it's opening weekend. the movie itself lived up to the hype and anticipation.Believe or not, some ridiculous morality groups including agassiz middle school in fargo nd actually voiced concern over the film because of the witchcraft element.from my experience with working kids (i mentor and tutor kids in my spare time ) i can tell you that kids can tell fiction from reality and right from wrong. ''harry potter and the philosopher's stone'' is based on the successful children's book by j.k. rowling who many didn't know is a woman, until she was interviewed on 60 minutesAlso what other people may not know is the children's books weren't successful at first. j.k. rowling came up with the idea for the books while working as a teacher. when rowling first displayed her early harry potter stories to publishers, all of them turned her down!!! Apparently these book publishers (like many in general) didn't know a good thing even if it bit them on the leg. eventually about 4 and 1/2 yrs after rowling's finished her final harry potter, warner bros. and chris columbus amazed by the popularity of the books, and seeing the opportunity to profit from it, convinced her to do a film from her books. this film ''harry potter and the sorcerer's stone'' is the result.The film starts of by a mysterious sequence in which a young boy is dropped of the doorstep of a neighborhood. a big giant, named hagrid (robbie  coltrane(, looks at the boy and eventually promises that he eventually come back for this special boy, who has an unusual birthmark on his head.The boy we learn is Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and he been brought here to be brought by one of the worst excuses of a mom and dad: His nasty aunt and uncle Mr and Mrs. Dursely (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) and their big fat son named Dudly. They abuse Harry literally using him as a slave around the house, and offering little luxury and love. We fast about 11 yrs, and suddenly we see that Harry is going hundreds of letters inviting him to come to the school of Hogwarts. Harry doesn't know what ''Hogwarts'' is, but his aunt and uncle, and like evil people do and keep that info away from hm, literally ripping  up every letter addressed to Harry from Hogwarts.As Harry and his ''family'' are visiting the zoo , Harry notices he has special odd powers: He can talk to a snake and and literally makes the snake comes alive!!! Dudley, the big fat kid, tries to pet the snake, but ends going through the windows and poops his pants, lol, as he sees the snake escaping. 0 Harry is shocked, but happy he has this special powers. Eventually that day, Hagrid, comes to Harry's house, and tells him all about ''Hogwarts'' which is a special Wizards and Witches school for kids. He also tells Harry that he is a great wizard!!!!!!!! Harry and Hagrid, then leave the Dursely's and Harry begins his first step into the adventure at Hogwarts.At Hogwarts, Harry meets other potentials wizards and witches like Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) who become Harry's roomates at Griffindoor.The headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), and a magical hat sort every Wizard and Witch candidate into their appropriate dorm, and so Harry Potters new classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione are sorted into Griffindoor.Here Harry and others meet their teachers such as Professor Snake (Alan Rickman from Die Hard fame) who specializes in potions. They also learn a  bout special sports at Hogwarts like quidditch a special wizard sport. However, the trio also uncover mystery , danger, and adventure as they uncover, trolls, three headed dogs, and a special mystery known as ''The Philosopher's Stone''. Harry above all will discover a mysterious secret about his parents, and their encounter against, an evil Wizard named Voldemort.''Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'' is loaded withspecial effects: The school of Hogwarts is loaded with special spirits and dangers. There is a great effect in the film where a couple of painting come alive in the movie!!! It looks cool. More special effects such as the walking stairways at Hogwarts. Of course the biggest effects come with showing the Wizard powers of Harry, and the amazing enemies he encounters.''Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'' also has great makeup effects as well:  For example , Harry in the beginning meets a couple of Goblins who work at the  Gringotts bank where Harry has an account. The makeup is fantastic, the people playing the Goblins look amazingly real in their makeup.''Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'' was a big hit for it's great story about a special boy, the amazing adventures he has as he Wizardy and Mystery where he will not uncover, great adventure but uncover himself as well. J.K. Rowling has done her best work with Harry Potter. 3 of the Harry Potter films have already been finished, with the 3rd film film being released later this year. There is a great special 2 disc dvd for the movie and it includes:* A special interactive tour of Hogwarts* A special trivia section and Wizard section* Special DVD Roms features such as a screensaver* Interviews with Chris Columbus and cast*Commentary and much moreHowever, the DVD features has it's setbacks for one is it's ''Extra Footage'' of the film. The ''Extra Footage'' are deleted scenes that didn't make the cut of the film. Ordinarly deleted scenes, are put into a special category on a dvd, so users can  see the original film and then see the deleted scenes separately.  I did like the commentary though explaining how tough yet fun it was in bringing Harry Potter to the big screen, obviously when the movie was a successful a box office franchise was born.The franchise of Harry Potter is not limited to the film or books, video games for the Playstation, Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance all have games of Harry Potter. However, Harry Potter is one the greatest fantasy movies in quite a while and J.K. Rowling has a done great job in bringing it to life.",5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,6193,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'one', 'best', 'fantasy',

525555,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00003CXI0,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 1]","As a librarian, I have naturally been aware of the Harry Potter phenomenon for quite a while now.  While there may be a few of my colleagues out there who are not so wild about ""Harry,"" nearly all welcome the enthusiasm the series has engendered and remain ever hopeful that some of those reluctant readers in their communities (adults as well as children) might become absorbed in the series and inspired to read more and more ""Harry,""  then maybe seek out similarly themed books and then, if the ball really gets rolling, discover a whole world of reading above, beyond but still including fantasy.  It could happen. You never know. We guardians of the printed word have to put our faith in something.OK,OK I must confess, from everything I'd heard and read, ""Harry"" wasn't likely to be my own particular cup of English tea. So after all these years, I still haven't actually read it. I'm not a children's librarian, so it wasn't an absolute must. Certainly, I was intrigued by the whole phenomenon but just not in any hurry to read it myself.  Not when there's so much depressing adult literature to plow through. So when the film version came out, I thought it would be a good way to get a feel for what this Harry thing was all about.  The fact that it was reported to be quite faithful to the book made checking out the film version all the better.  Now I could fake my way through lengthy (and they do tend to be lengthy)conversations with Harry-Potter-Heads if I had to.It still took me nearly six months to see the film. Locally, it wasn't around as long as I thought it was going to be.  Finally, on its second or third run, I was able to catch it...at a drive-in!  (Yes, there are still some left here in the Northeast).  It turned out to be the perfect setting, watching this elaborate fantasy unfold while sitting in my own private bubble. (I may have been the only person who ever went to a drive-in ALONE). But it was good, kind of like the solitary pleasure of reading.I'm half-kidding when I say that the movie's literalness was a plus.  I'm sure there are Potter fans out there who would have welcomed something not quite as faithful to a text they already knew by heart.  But when you consider how young (or, at least, young at heart) so many of the readers are, and how none of us likes his fairy tales altered one jot, the film version's slavishness to the original was probably the only possible artistic choice.Any criticisms?  Well, yeah.  Child actors need special coaching.  I'm not one who believes that there are only a few exceptional Haley Joel Osments or Hayley Millses out there.  But they do need special care from their drama coaches and directors.  This is especially true when they're required to deliver ""adult-level"" dialog.  It's not surprising that these young sorcerers have exceptional vocabularies: they're SUPPOSED to be special, but in fact, much of the scripted dialog does not come trippingly off the young actors' tongues.If that's the worst I can say about the movie though, it's not saying much.  Enjoy the film! And its no doubt worthy sequels. And don't forget to read the BOOKS!  (Do as I say, kids, not as I do.)",4,It Gets People to Read!

It mixes realism and fantasy and hearkens to a wide selection of well-known predecessors.  It's a high-powered version of ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks,"" with a little ""Star Wars"" and even ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" thrown in. In comparison with those movies, that is also its main fault as the storyline in this movie is fairly cliched and threadbare, despite the best efforts of screenwriter Steve Kloves.Featuring an all-star gallery of British and United Kingdom acting talent, the film manages to significantly cover up a fairly uneventful runtime by sheer force of their efforts.  The cast includes Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, as well as Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall and the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore.  Most impressive, however, are the junior members of the cast.  Daniel Radcliffe is wonderful in the title role, and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are also superb as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively.  Tom Felton, as Harry's young enemy Draco Malfoy, is very impressive as well and rounds out a very solid core of child actors in this film.The movie overcomes a plodding, paint-by-numbers approach to laying out its key storytelling elements to deliver an exciting climax.

My mom literally took me out of school to go to the premiere, and we were the second group in line with about a billion people behind us. I was a Potter nut, like most kids were at the time, and I was insanely excited to see this movie. I wasn't disappointed at all.The film tells the story of Sorcerer's Stone in a nearly flawless fashion. Sure, there are things left out, but it's a book-to-film ADAPTION, not translation. The film still keeps all of the important and best parts and creates some pretty classic moments for itself.The entire flim was very well done, and they couldn't have picked better actors for the leads. Snape did a particularly good job of capturing the character, as did Emma Watson when it came to Hermione Granger.In case you've been living under a rock, the story of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about a neglected child whose parents are dead and is forced to live with his aunt, uncle, and abusive cousin. However, he finds out that he is actually a wizard, and he goes to attend school at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. He discovers the secrets within Hogwarts and gets to know all of the colorful characters within its walls.The plot plays out brilliantly and the acting is spot-on for the most part, so why couldn't Sorcerer's Stone nab that perfect five stars? Well, it's the special effects. Now, don't get me wrong, there are some very cool special effects like moving pictures, the goblins, floating candles, and all of that jazz, but there is a problem. The CGI, even though it's used sparingly, looks AWFUL! Honestly, they look like they were zapped out of a cut-scene for a PlayStation One video game. Eight years ago this may have worked, but the CGI techniques used here really haven't aged well. Plus, I hate CGI and don't approve of its use much at all anyway.Both the Harry Potter books and the Harry Potter film series will be forever immortalized in not only American culture but damn near every culture that covers this world. This film is definitely worth seeing and rewatching again and again, with the only problem being it hasn't really aged all that well.",4,"Here he comes, the birthday boy!",1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,2405,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'recently', 'released', 'theaters', 'thought', 'was', 'appropriate', 'look', 'back', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'legacy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'damned', 'better', 'place', 'start', 'original.I', 'remember', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'mom', 'literally', 'took', 'school', 'go', 'premiere', 'were', 'second', 'group', 'line', 'billion', 'people', 'was', 'Potter', 'nut', 'most', 'kids', 'were', 'time', 'was', 'insanely', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'all.The', 'film', 'story', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'fashion', 'Sure', 'are', 'things', 'left', 'out', 'book-to-film', 'ADAPTION', 'not', 'translation', 'film', 'still', 'important', 'best', 'parts', 'pretty', 'classic', 'moments', 'itself.The', 'entire', 'flim', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'picked', 'better', 'actors', 'leads', 'Snape', 'did', 'particularly', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'character', 'did', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'when', 'came', 'Hermione', 'Granger.In', 'case', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'story', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'neglected', 'child', 'parents', 'are', 'dead', 'forced', 'live', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'abusive', 'cousin', 'However', 'out', 'actually', 'wizard', 'attend', 'school', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardy', 'secrets', 'Hogwarts', 'know', 'colorful', 'characters', 'walls.The', 'plot', 'out', 'brilliantly', 'acting', 'spot-on', 'most', 'part', 'so', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'nab', 'perfect', 'five', 'stars', 'Well', 'special', 'effects', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'very', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'moving', 'pictures', 'goblins', 'floating', 'candles', 'jazz', 'problem', 'CGI', 'even', 'used', 'sparingly', 'AWFUL', 'Honestly', 'look', 'were', 'zapped', 'cut-scene', 'PlayStation', 'One', 'video', 'game', 'Eight', 'years', 'ago', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'CGI', 'techniques', 'used', 'here', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'hate', 'CGI', 'do', ""n't"", 'approve', 'use', 'much', 'anyway.Both', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'immortalized', 'not', 'only', 'American', 'culture', 'damn', 'culture', 'world', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'rewatching', 'again', 'again', 'only', 'problem', 'being', ""n't"", 'really', 'aged', 'well']",N/A

As a student of film studies, I have to say that filmmakers today, especially Hollywood filmmakers, are tending more and more to rely on special effects and quick shots of people's expressions, and not enough on ACTING!  Even the great Maggie Smith was reduced to a series of melodramatic poses and shallow facial expressions.  And I was ready to tear that plasterboard fake smile off of Daniel Radcliffe's face by the end of the movie.  I'm afraid he, like the rest of the characters in this film, suffer from terminal cool.  I suppose thats what kids today want.  And you can bet Hollywood will deliver.The film is also excessively violent.  If you compare sections of the film with the way the story is told in the book, you can see the added amount of gratuitous violence.  Children and creatures are hurled around and smashed against things like they're images in a video game.  Realism?

HP is a good, entertaining, enjoyable family movie, and true to the book (perhaps a bit too much so) - unfortunately for it LotR turned out to be a truly magnificent film which not only captured the essence of its book but showed how you could transfer it to the big screen and be faithful to it while tightening and speeding things up. As both of these films are merely the first in series it seems likely that poor Harry and Hogwarts will be continue to be overshadowed by Middle Earth. This is rather a pity  - one can enjoy both, after all.Yes, the DVD of the film itself is good, though the second one with its various extras (including a few - all too few -cut scenes) really is badly laid out and difficult to navigate.Poor Harry has also suffered a bit, from what we hear on this side of the pond, from the attention of people who think he is anti-Christian. How a story of the power of redeeming love to overcome evil can be this I really don't know. A couple of anti-Potter websites I've seen quote one of the characters who says ""there is no good or evil, only power"" as if this represents JK Rowling's viewpoint.

525582,A1SCJWCMQ3W3KK,B00003CXI0,Irishgal,"[2, 2]","Ahhh...Harry Potter. This film successfully manages to bring the magic of J.K. Rowling's characters to life.""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the first installment of Rowling's planned seven-book series about a young orphan, Harry Potter, who wakes up on his eleventh birthday only to be told that he is a wizard and has the chance to leave his muggle (non-magic) aunt and uncle to attend the greatest school of all time: Hogwarts.While at school, Harry meets many unforgettable characters who are beautifully portrayed in this film. There is Harry's best friend, red-head Ron Weasley, the fifth child of a poor family who loves, among other things, wizard chess. There is the over-confident Hermoine Granger, who enjoys reading, studying, and being right. There is Harry's nemesis, the evil (and brilliatly casted) Draco Malfoy, starved for power and from a family that is, well, loaded with money. There is the gentle Rufus Hagrid, the gamekeeper at Hogwarts, who wants nothing more than a pet dragon. And there is the beloved headmaster, Prof. Albus Dumbledore (played by the late Richard Harris), a man who is both wise and gentle.Both the books and the movie have come under heavy scrutiny for being about witchcraft. They are. They are also about the struggles of good battling evil and Harry's triumphs and let-downs as he struggles to discover himself and his expectations as a young boy thrown into a world he completely doesn't understand. This isn't evil, it's a magical adventure, much like Peter Pan.Another comment from many fans of the Potter series is that they don't want to see the movies for fear of destroying their views as to what the books are 'really like'. The first time I saw this film, my good friend, who absolutely loves Harry, kept exclaiming, 'This is just how I pictured it!' Many fans have walked away with similar responses, and I have yet to find another movie that follows the book so closely.The adventures of young Harry at Hogwarts (and even getting there) are magical masterpieces.

In the years following, I have learned to be more openminded about such things.  Last month, I finally decided to watch the Harry Potter movies.I was immediately captivated by the movie, and its subsequent sequels.  In the month that I have owned the first five movies, I have already watched them all three times.Yes, the focus of the story is on Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  I caution Christian audiences not to immediately dismiss this movie just because of that.  Some of you may remember the old Disney movie, ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"".  This series is no more harmful than that.The entire movie has a wonderful sense of whimsy to it, created by such things as chocolate frogs, banks run by goblins, candles floating near the ceiling, and the great broomstick-based soccer/polo-like sport known as Quidditch.The cinematography was beautiful.  The Hogwarts sequences had such a warm, colorful, enchanting feel to them.  It made me want to enroll at Hogwarts.The cast of characters is perfect, including such well-known stars as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and John Cleese.

The movie is good and the acting is good among certain characters, mainly the adults, but what can you say because the kids were in their first movie. A lot of people said the movie was nothing like the book but it actually was totally like the book, which it should be! The only main differences were just the parts they had to leave out which makes sense because other wise the movie would have been anylonger. The movie is so much like the book that I couldn't read the book after I saw the movie because it was exactly like MOST of the scenes. Notice i did say most. The movie is a TON like the book but it's not totally exact with every detail but it's very close. People will argue but they'll get over it and if they don't they are just doing it for show as everyone does. Anyway the movie is good but if you've just read the book DON'T go see it.

In Great Britain and everywhere else, it is titled ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"".Running Time: 2 hours, 32 mins. Rated ""PG"". Released November 4, 2001.Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), Professor McGonnagall (Maggie Smith) and Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) give a special baby (Saunders Triplets) to the Dursley's on their doorstep. The child's parent have died unexpectedly so he is given to his aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw).Eleven years later, the boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), is living under the stairs in a stairwell room. His aunt, his uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and his young cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) are mean to him. Harry has special powers and is good of heart always. Harry receives a wax-sealed letter by special messenger, a white owl. His Uncle will not let him have it and burns it in the fireplace. In fact, all of Harry's letters have been burnt.Later that night, Harry is in the basement and a very tall and big man knocks down the door. It is Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) to save Harry. Hagrid wishes Harry a happy 11th birthday, gives him a present and tells him he is a wizard. He hands him an envelope. It is his invitation to the Hogwart's School of Witchery and Wizardry to become a student. Uncle Vernon will not let him go.It is Harry's choice to make and he decides to leave with Hagrid. Harry Potter finds it's easy to make friends at the grand school as he learns and studies more of his special powers and begins his first adventure in finding the red Sorcerer's Stone and coming in contact with his first opponent, He Who Must Not Be Named, ""Voldemort"" (Richard Bremmer).Very fine movie for children to watch. Has the same wonderful feeling as The Wizard Of Oz (1939) and I do not find this magical film objectionable in any way. However, some scenes may be scary for young children so I do suggest parental guidance.Also in the cast: Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, John Hurt, Julie Walters, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, Ian Hart, Zoe Wanamaker, Verne Troyer, Warwick Davis, James Phelps, Oliver Phelps, Bonnie Wright, Chris Rankin, Tom Felton, Ben Borowiecki, Harry Taylor, Matthew Lewis, Devon Murray, David Bradley, Jamie Waylett, Josh Herdman, Alfie Enouch, Eleanor Columbus, Sean Biggerstaff, Emily Date, Danielle Tabor, Luke Youngblood, Scot Fearn, David Holmes, Oliver Lavery-Farag, Amy Puglia.Geraldine Somerville plays ""Lily Potter"".

525595,A2RQZG0FUSSMPJ,B00003CXI0,Jamy Shaffer,"[1, 1]","I find it hard to believe that so many people are so quick to judge and condemn the phenomenon that is Harry Potter.  Upon emerging as a book (not just for kids but for the kid in all of us), it got children to turn off their video games and READ!!!  It was amazing that a children's book would hold the best seller lists for months.  Public schools as well as Colleges around the country have added the entire series to their curricula.  Most nay-sayers would point that the stories teach about and glorify witchcraft and wizardry.  May I point to a classic which was written a century ago and made into a movie that has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time????  The Wizard of Oz is all about a fantastic land full of witches, wizards, and other strange magical qualities....Another example was written over 50 years ago by a devout Christian.  C.S. Lewis' ""Chronicles of Narnia"" contains as much magic, witches, and other strange phenomena as Harry Potter.  People are so quick to judge and condemn that they are too blind to see what lies at the heart of the work.As for the movie itself, it is amazing how faithful it is to Rowling's first novel.  The acting is phenomenal especially among the three children (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson).  Miss Watson is so bossy and perfect that I actually believed that she was Hermione.  The supporting cast is full of British acting royalty.  Maggie Smith is fantastic as Pro McGonagall.  Richard Harris is wise and learned as Dumbledore.  Robbie Coltrane is hillarious as the gentle, often muddled Hagrid.I absolutely loved the Quidditch match.  The whole movie just zipped along almost making me forget that it is over 2 and a half hours longNow for the heart of the matter.  At the conclusion of the movie, Ron and Hermione are both awarded for standing along side of their friend in the face of danger.  Harry himself is awarded for ultimate bravery and courage.  Even poor Neville Longbottom is awarded for standing up to his friends when what they are doing is against the rules because it is dangerous.  Is this not what people wish small chiildren to carry with them?  It is a shame that anyone would wish to condemn this wonderful cultural phenomenon.

525601,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B00003CXI0,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 6]","Throughout the course of this look back at the first Harry Potter installment I will refer to what is commonly known in America as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by its original British name, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. J.K. Rowling herself has stated that if she had more clout with the publishers at the time of the initial US book release it would have retained its original name.For movie-goers, it all started on 11/16/2001. And what a start it was! Easily the most anticipated movie of the year, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone even outgrossed the first installment of another highly anticipated film series that debuted a little over a month later: Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring.* Even with five extremely successful sequels, at $975 million in worldwide grosses Philosopher's Stone still remains the highest grossing Potter film to date.Philosopher's Stone is a great introduction to the series for newbies not familiar with the books (that's how I was introduced to the phenomenon), as well as for anyone who enjoys the books and was, or is, just getting around to the movies. Rowling gave filmmakers a great blueprint for introducing the audience to a world completely unfamiliar to them by making the series' namesake a newcomer to the underground magical world as well. This choice allows the viewer to see things through Harry's eyes, and in turn feel empathy for him as well.Another reason this film works so well is the cast. While the film features then-unknown actors in the children's roles, the adult parts are played by British stage and film veterans. I would imagine that, for the children on set, this film had to feel like a crash course in acting school. Here you had Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber, anyone?), Dame Maggie Smith (Othello, Richard III), Robbie Coltrane (GoldenEye, From Hell), John Hurt (Alien, The Elephant Man), and Richard Harris (Gladiator, Unforgiven) all gathered on one set. While I'm sure these veteran thespians assisted the little ones in learning the art of acting, they also lent the film a level of gravitas that wouldn't have been felt otherwise.While Philosopher's Stone works great as a gateway drug into the Harry Potter universe, it doesn't hold up as well as future installments on multiple viewings. I think this has a lot to do with its slavish devotion to every word of the book. While this is admirable, later installments have shown that you can remain faithful to the spirit of the books while taking some liberties with the source material. I also feel as though Chris Columbus has a tendency to make films for focus groups, giving the film a much more polished sheen than it could have had when converting Rowling's pages to celluloid.This can really be seen in how lavishly sterile the set designs are in this film. Hogwarts looks more like a museum than a school inhabited by boarding school kids, the grounds look flat and clean, and the Forbidden Forest looks appropriately spooky but lacks the dread we get when we read the book. Each time I rewatch this movie, I feel as though some of the soul was sucked out of the book to give us something closer to what Disney would have made of the series. Of course, given some of the dark themes approached within the pages of this debut novel it can only be expected that there would initially be some attempt to lighten the mood a little.Overall, Philosopher's Stone is still a great beginning to a brilliant series. One thing that's remarkable in this film is how the actors, even the more inexperienced younger ones, really bring their characters to life. The production team did a great job of trying to bring the life of the books to the screen, even though they do refine some of the bite out of it.",3,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,1290556800,"11 24, 2010",2010,3758,"['course', 'look', 'back', 'first', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'installment', 'will', 'refer', 'what', 'commonly', 'known', 'America', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'original', 'British', 'name', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'stated', 'had', 'more', 'clout', 'publishers', 'time', 'initial', 'US', 'book', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'retained', 'original', 'name.For', 'movie-goers', 'all', 'started', '11/16/2001', 'what', 'start', 'was', 'Easily', 'most', 'anticipated', 'movie', 'year', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'even', 'outgrossed', 'first', 'installment', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'film', 'series', 'debuted', 'little', 'month', 'later', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', '*', 'Even', 'five', 'extremely', 'successful', 'sequels', '975', 'million', 'worldwide', 'grosses', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'still', 'highest', 'grossing', 'Potter', 'film', 'date.Philosopher', 'Stone', 'great', 'introduction', 'series', 'newbies', 'not', 'familiar', 'books', 'how', 'was', 'introduced', 'phenomenon', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'who', 'books', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'around', 'movies', 'Rowling', 'gave', 'filmmakers', 'great', 'blueprint', 'introducing', 'audience', 'world', 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'making', 'series', 'namesake', 'newcomer', 'underground', 'magical', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'choice', 'viewer', 'see', 'things', 'Harry', 'eyes', 'turn', 'feel', 'empathy', 'well.Another', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'cast', 'film', 'then-unknown', 'actors', 'children', 'roles', 'adult', 'parts', 'are', 'played', 'British', 'stage', 'film', 'veterans', 'would', 'imagine', 'children', 'set', 'film', 'had', 'feel', 'crash', 'course', 'acting', 'school', 'Here', 'had', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Hans', 'Gruber', 'anyone', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Othello', 'Richard', 'III', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'GoldenEye', 'From', 'Hell', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Alien', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Gladiator', 'Unforgiven', 'gathered', 'one', 'set', ""'m"", 'sure', 'veteran', 'thespians', 'assisted', 'little', 'ones', 'learning', 'art', 'acting', 'also', 'lent', 'film', 'level', 'gravitas', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'felt', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'great', 'gateway', 'drug', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'universe', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'future', 'installments', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'slavish', 'devotion', 'word', 'book', 'admirable', 'later', 'installments', 'have', 'shown', 'can', 'remain', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'books', 'taking', 'liberties', 'source', 'material', 'also', 'feel', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'tendency', 'make', 'films', 'focus', 'groups', 'giving', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'polished', 'sheen', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'when', 'converting', 'Rowling', 'pages', 'celluloid.This', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'seen', 'how', 'lavishly', 'set', 'designs', 'are', 'film', 'more', 'museum', 'school', 'inhabited', 'boarding', 'school', 'kids', 'grounds', 'look', 'flat', 'clean', 'Forbidden', 'Forest', 'appropriately', 'spooky', 'dread', 'get', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'time', 'rewatch', 'movie', 'feel', 'soul', 'was', 'sucked', 'book', 'give', 'something', 'closer', 'what', 'Disney', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'series', 'course', 'given', 'dark', 'themes', 'approached', 'pages', 'debut', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'expected', 'would', 'initially', 'be', 'attempt', 'lighten', 'mood', 'little.Overall', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'still', 'great', 'beginning', 'brilliant', 'series', 'One', 'thing', 'remarkable', 'film', 'how', 'actors', 'even', 'more', 'inexperienced', 'younger', 'ones', 'really', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'production', 'team', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'trying', 'bring', 'life', 'books', 'screen', 'even', 'do', 'refine', 'bite']",N/A

The acting, writing, and storyline itself were sad, pedantic, and formulaic. It is filled with deus ex machina's, including two pivotal points at the end. Without (the character) Harry Potter, there wouldn't even be a problem at the end to resolve! Most of the film is filled with the daily life of the school, and one keeps on an enduring wait for a real plot. You won't be disappointed- the plot does begin to develop in the last 1/2 hour of the movie.Now having seen the movie, I can finally understand all the concern with the magic in this story. It *is* qualitatively different from Tolkien or Lewis, on two counts. Firstly, magic is the point of the story, and the constant point. InLewisandTolkien, magic is only a plot device that helps the real point of the story along. Here, one can't get away from it. Secondly, the magic is qualitatively different. This isn't Gandalf raising a staff and a burst of light appearing, or Aslan speaking of the deeper magic from beyond the dawn of time as he comes back to life after being slain on a stone slab. The magic presented in Harry Potter is the type that is actually practiced, or attempted- crystal balls, spells, potions, and the like. The emphasis in Potter is on the ""how-to"" of magic- how to actually make things happen. And while it is unlikely that someone could copy spells in the movie to get results, I could easily see where seeing or reading this could get them started on the road to other forms, such as the ouija board or ""light as a feather"".

The tale woven throughout each of the seven books (eight movies) is one of true, genuine, sacrifical, loving friendship, not only standing up but also FIGHTING for what you believe in (especially when that belief is on the side of good), wins and losses and giving everything you have because it's the right thing to do. I just cannot praise these books enough. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd want to bother with a &#34;young adult/kid&#34; series... just stop. Crack open a used (but very loved) copy of Sorcerer's Stone and GET. SWEPT. UP. in one of the greatest stories of bravery and perseverance and love and --geez, I should stop-- LIFE ever told.

525614,AWA0CA9AYL5YQ,B00003CXI0,Jennifer Litchfield,"[1, 1]","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (bizarrely the Philosopher has transfigured himself into a Sorcerer in the USA) is a children's movie with a difference. Thanks to the creative genius of J. K. Rowling, the judicious use of some excellent British actors, and an enormous budget, this is a film that treats its young viewers with respect. Instead of the usual schmaltzy children's fare, Harry Potter (notwithstanding a few minor aberrations) thankfully doesn't descend into the saccharine. On the contrary, it is a highly original and very entertaining trip into the hitherto infrequently visited realm of magic.To the many readers of the Harry Potter series of novels, the storyline will come as no surprise and the movie is very faithful to the book. Despite prior knowledge of the plot nullifying the film's suspense somewhat, the mise-en-scene created is a veritable visual feast. The extensive use of computer animation is largely superb - the first trip across the lake to Hogwarts is awe-inspiring, Quidditch is excitingly brought to life, and the three-headed dog is certainly as scary as Rowling could have wished - although there are occasional clunky effects, such as the entrance to Diagon Alley. The makeup too is outstanding, as evidenced by the alarmingly real goblin bankers at Gringotts.Despite the movie's 2  hour length, it is relatively pacy as it follows Harry's discovery of the magician within himself, and his deadly duel with the greatest dark wizard of all time. Together with the help of his friends Ron and Hermione he battles mountain trolls, bewitched broomsticks, and a brutal but visually stunning game of wizard's chess. After all this excitement, the final showdown with the evil Voldemort is almost anti-climactic. Nevertheless, overall this is a spellbinding movie - in more ways than one.",4,"""Are you doing magic?

The visuals tend to lack at points, the troll, who is supposed to be about five tons, looks weightless because it's computer generated imagery doesn't seem completed.  I believe visual effects teams will improve that in the future though.Of course, John Williams blows us away with his Oscar nominated score and left people of all ages humming the theme as they left the theater.  It was memorable and me and my friends counted how many times we got chills in the theater just from the exciting score.It's an exciting movie, full of suprises, absolutely great acting, and one to be considered an all-time classic.

525629,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00003CXI0,Joe Sherry,"[1, 1]","A film by Chris ColumbusThis is the first film in the Harry Potter series and it is adapted from J.K. Rowling's novel of the same title.  A common complaint about movies that have been adapted from a book is that the movie strays too far from the book and that it makes too many changes.  This is sometimes necessary as film and novels are two different mediums and need to tell stories in different ways, but sometimes unnecessary changes are made.  Happily, this is not the case with this movie.  This movie is extremely faithful to the book, and I think the film works because of that.By now, many people probably have a good idea what Harry Potter is all about.  For those who are not in the know, here's the story for this movie.  Young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is living with his aunt and his uncle because his parents died when he was an infant.  It is obvious they do not want him around as he is forced to live in the closet under the stairs and he is treated like a servant, an unwelcome servant at that.  One day owls start arriving at the house and deliver letters to Harry.  We see that the letters are from &quot;Hogwarts.&quot;  Harry's uncle keeps destroying the letters, but more come each day.  Finally he has had enough and Harry's Uncle takes the family (including Harry) to a remote island where no letters can reach them.  It is at this point that Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) finds Harry, tells him that Harry is a wizard, and that he is to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  See, Harry is a wizard, and is the son of a wizard.  Harry's parents were not killed in a car accident (as he had been told), but rather they were killed by the Dark Lord Voldemort, a wizard gone bad.  Harry is the boy who lived, which is why he is famous in the wizarding world.At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends with Ron Weasely (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and makes an enemy of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  Ron and Hermione are also first year students and are in Gryffindor House with Harry.  Draco is also a first year, but is in Slytherin House (Ron tells Harry that &quot;not a wizard went bad that wasn't in Slytherin&quot;).  Harry, Ron, and Hermione become good friends and get into little adventures together.  They believe that someone is trying to steal something called the Sorcerer's Stone and since no adult will believe them, they try to figure this out on their own.  At the same time, they are in the first year of school, so they have to go to their classes in magic.  A little bit of time is spent in each class so that we get a sense of the school and a sense of the magic of that Harry and friends are supposed to be learning.The movie is very faithful to the book, so most events from the book are included in this movie and while it is a fairly long movie (2 and a half hours), it moves along fast enough that you don't really feel like you've spent so much time.  One of the reasons you don't feel the time is that the acting is fantastic.  The actors are so perfect for their roles that they are almost exactly how I imagined the characters to be.  Two actors who stand out are Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape.  Rickman, especially, is a delight to watch.  This role border's on Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) as one of his great characters.  The movie also features Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall) and Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick).Even though I would recommend the book to anyone, I'm not convinced the movie is for everyone.  I thought that the movie captured the events and the spirit of the book, but is missing some of the charm.  Rowling's novel just sucks you in, but at times I thought the movie was only for fans of the book.  I really enjoyed the movie, and I will give it a good rating, but it may not convert people who don't really enjoy fantasy (or movies that have fantasy elements).",4,"very good movie, but lacks some of the charm of the book",1069718400,"11 25, 2003",2003,3946,"['film', 'Chris', 'ColumbusThis', 'first', 'film', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'adapted', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'common', 'complaint', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'adapted', 'book', 'movie', 'too', 'far', 'book', 'too', 'many', 'changes', 'sometimes', 'necessary', 'film', 'novels', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'mediums', 'need', 'tell', 'stories', 'different', 'ways', 'sometimes', 'unnecessary', 'changes', 'are', 'made', 'Happily', 'not', 'case', 'movie', 'movie', 'extremely', 'faithful', 'book', 'think', 'film', 'that.By', 'now', 'many', 'people', 'probably', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'know', 'here', 'story', 'movie', 'Young', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'living', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'parents', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'infant', 'obvious', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'around', 'forced', 'live', 'closet', 'stairs', 'treated', 'servant', 'unwelcome', 'servant', 'One', 'day', 'start', 'arriving', 'house', 'deliver', 'letters', 'Harry', 'see', 'letters', 'are', 'quot', 'Hogwarts.', 'quot', 'Harry', 'uncle', 'destroying', 'letters', 'more', 'come', 'day', 'Finally', 'had', 'enough', 'Harry', 'Uncle', 'family', 'including', 'Harry', 'remote', 'island', 'where', 'letters', 'can', 'reach', 'point', 'Hagrid', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'wizard', 'attend', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardry', 'See', 'Harry', 'wizard', 'son', 'wizard', 'Harry', 'parents', 'were', 'not', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'rather', 'were', 'killed', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'wizard', 'gone', 'bad', 'Harry', 'boy', 'who', 'lived', 'why', 'famous', 'wizarding', 'world.At', 'Hogwarts', 'Harry', 'friends', 'Ron', 'Weasely', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'enemy', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'are', 'also', 'first', 'year', 'students', 'are', 'Gryffindor', 'House', 'Harry', 'Draco', 'also', 'first', 'year', 'Slytherin', 'House', 'Ron', 'Harry', 'quot', 'not', 'wizard', 'went', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'Slytherin', 'quot', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'get', 'little', 'adventures', 'together', 'believe', 'someone', 'trying', 'steal', 'something', 'called', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'adult', 'will', 'believe', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'own', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'first', 'year', 'school', 'have', 'go', 'classes', 'magic', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'spent', 'class', 'so', 'get', 'sense', 'school', 'sense', 'magic', 'Harry', 'friends', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'learning.The', 'movie', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'so', 'most', 'events', 'book', 'are', 'included', 'movie', 'fairly', 'long', 'movie', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'One', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'time', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'roles', 'are', 'almost', 'exactly', 'how', 'imagined', 'characters', 'be', 'Two', 'actors', 'who', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'Rickman', 'especially', 'delight', 'watch', 'role', 'border', 'Rickman', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Prince', 'Thieves', 'one', 'great', 'characters', 'movie', 'also', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Professor', 'McGonagall', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'Professor', 'Flitwick', '.Even', 'would', 'recommend', 'book', 'anyone', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'movie', 'everyone', 'thought', 'movie', 'captured', 'events', 'spirit', 'book', 'missing', 'charm', 'Rowling', 'novel', 'just', 'sucks', 'times', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'fans', 'book', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'good', 'rating', 'may', 'not', 'convert', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'have', 'fantasy', 'elements']",N/A

525632,AZXUFTJVXJWL0,B00003CXI0,John Dynan,"[9, 11]","Though by no means the only example of the subject, Joanne Rowling's imaginative book about an eleven year old boy discovering his new-found talent for magic, reintroduced the age-old genre of the fairy story to modern children. &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; benefits enormously from modern CGI effects to bring to life a film which will entertain everyone. The basic story concerns an orphaned boy living with his appalling cousins who are determined that he should not find out that he was actually born a wizard. Through outside help from the magical community, he finds himself enrolled at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the fun starts.Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman help to back up the principal child stars and give this film some real presence. Daniel Radcliffe is rather flat as Harry Potter and Emma Watson, as the precocious Hermione Granger, is excessively theatrical and both are shaded by Rupert Grint who is excellent in the role of their cynical friend, Ron Weazley. No doubt all the child actors will improve with time, given that they stay with the series. At the moment they are still finding their feet.There are plenty of special effects to amaze and amuse and I can't imagine how such a film could have been made without them. The cinematography by John Seale, ACS, is excellent and the whole film has a very pleasing look. The two-disc DVD set has many extras, some of which seem to require an intimate knowledge of magic to access.On the whole, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I wait with baited breath for the sequels. It is not a five star film; I did not expect it to be, but it certainly rates considerable merit. I have yet to figure out why WB chose to release it as anything other than &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;, since that is both the title of the original book and the title of the film in any other market than the US. Apart from a few little blemishes, an excellent movie. Kids will give it five stars; parents will enjoy it, too.

525637,A2HVFBVT0X1IP1,B00003CXI0,Jonah Cohen,"[9, 21]","I'm a fan of the Harry Potter series. I've read all the books, looking forward to #5. I was hoping the movie of Sorceror's Stone would be good, but sadly, it wasn't. It had its good points, but overall it was disappointing. I don't say that just because it wasn't as good as the book, or because it came out at the same time as a truly great movie adaptation of a similar book (The Fellowship of the Ring), but because it had serious flaws.First, the good stuff: This movie looked great. Nice cinematography and art direction. Hogwarts and Diagon Alley were perfect. A few of the special effects were good - Fluffy the dog, the chess board, the flying in Quiditich. There were a few - too few - quiet moments that really resonated: Harry sitting and staring at the Mirror of Erised, the huge flock of owls outside the Dursley house. Daniel Radcliffe got the right mix of heroism and ordinariness for Harry, the actors playing Snape, Hagrid + McGonnagall were spot on. A few actors with minor roles (Malfoy, Filch, Wood, Olivander) hammed it up admirably.That being said, there were big things wrong. The kid who played Ron had one befuddled expression that he flashed in every scene. Richard Harris was as wooden as a broomstick as Dumbledore. A few effects, like the invisibility cloak, were clumsy. But that's minor stuff. The biggest problem is that the movie was poorly plotted and poorly adapted from the book.It feels like they selected random scenes and dialogue and filmed them, not like they were trying to tell an actual story. Examples:Haul out your copy of Book 1 and reread the chapter on the train. In one chapter, Rowling firmly establishes that Harry and Ron have gone from strangers to best buddies, Hermione's irksome bossiness, and Neville's patheticness. Nothing even remotely like that happens in the movie. For all the times they mention Bernie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, you'd think it was a real product that was paying for onscreen product placement. I could have done with less about the beans, more about character development.When Quirrell takes off the turban, that should be the big climax, but the movie has done next to nothing to demonstrate that Voldemort is the big bad guy, everyone fears him etc. No one trembles when Harry speaks the name aloud. No mention of why Snape hates Harry, making him seem like a clumsy red herring in the movie (instead of, arguably, the most complex character in the books). Neville coming through at the end has no impact, because the movie hasn't established what a hard-luck case he is.I could go on, but basically, all too much about the movie would make no sense and have no impact if you hadn't read the book.It also doesn't help that the navigation of many features on the DVD is set up like a clumsy video game.Here's hoping the more plot-driven Chamber of Secrets makes for a better film #2.",2,I wish it had been better,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,2866,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', ""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'looking', 'forward', '5', 'was', 'hoping', 'movie', 'Sorceror', 'Stone', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'had', 'good', 'points', 'overall', 'was', 'disappointing', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'book', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'similar', 'book', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'had', 'serious', 'flaws.First', 'good', 'stuff', 'movie', 'looked', 'great', 'Nice', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'Hogwarts', 'Diagon', 'Alley', 'were', 'perfect', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'dog', 'chess', 'board', 'flying', 'Quiditich', 'were', 'few', 'too', 'few', 'quiet', 'moments', 'really', 'resonated', 'Harry', 'sitting', 'staring', 'Mirror', 'Erised', 'huge', 'flock', 'owls', 'Dursley', 'house', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'got', 'right', 'mix', 'heroism', 'ordinariness', 'Harry', 'actors', 'playing', 'Snape', 'Hagrid', '+', 'McGonnagall', 'were', 'spot', 'few', 'actors', 'minor', 'roles', 'Malfoy', 'Filch', 'Wood', 'Olivander', 'hammed', 'up', 'being', 'said', 'were', 'big', 'things', 'wrong', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'Ron', 'had', 'one', 'befuddled', 'expression', 'flashed', 'scene', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'was', 'as', 'wooden', 'broomstick', 'Dumbledore', 'A', 'few', 'effects', 'invisibility', 'cloak', 'were', 'clumsy', 'minor', 'stuff', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'poorly', 'plotted', 'poorly', 'adapted', 'book.It', 'feels', 'selected', 'random', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'filmed', 'not', 'were', 'trying', 'tell', 'actual', 'story', 'Examples', 'Haul', 'out', 'copy', 'Book', '1', 'reread', 'chapter', 'train', 'one', 'chapter', 'Rowling', 'firmly', 'establishes', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'have', 'gone', 'strangers', 'best', 'buddies', 'Hermione', 'irksome', 'bossiness', 'Neville', 'patheticness', 'Nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'movie', 'times', 'mention', 'Bernie', 'Bott', 'Every', 'Flavor', 'Beans', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'real', 'product', 'was', 'paying', 'onscreen', 'product', 'placement', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'less', 'beans', 'more', 'character', 'development.When', 'Quirrell', 'turban', 'should', 'be', 'big', 'climax', 'movie', 'done', 'next', 'nothing', 'demonstrate', 'Voldemort', 'big', 'bad', 'guy', 'everyone', 'fears', 'etc', 'one', 'when', 'Harry', 'name', 'aloud', 'mention', 'why', 'Snape', 'Harry', 'making', 'seem', 'clumsy', 'red', 'herring', 'movie', 'instead', 'arguably', 'most', 'complex', 'character', 'books', 'Neville', 'coming', 'end', 'impact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'established', 'what', 'hard-luck', 'case', 'is.I', 'could', 'go', 'basically', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'have', 'impact', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book.It', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'navigation', 'many', 'features', 'DVD', 'set', 'up', 'clumsy', 'video', 'hoping', 'more', 'plot-driven', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'better', 'film', '2']",N/A

This is a thoroughly entertaining, richly layered film, with smart, supreme special effects, plenty of &quot;oohs and aahs&quot; and a nice mix of charming players, engaging plot devices and technical wizardry.  Few true Harry Potter fanatics have expressed satisfaction with the film, which apparently sticks so closely to its book source, it misses the magic these readers had themselves conjured up in their imagination.  As a result, a non-Potter-initiated viewer as myself was quickly swept away by the grandeur and illusion that unfolds on screen.  The young Radcliffe seems the perfect choice, though I hope he grows into the role as he himself grows up - some scenes are wooden, and his slightly crooked smile seems out of place at times.  His cohorts are equally engaging, though Hermoine's character is at times a challenge to enjoy.  Ron Weasly is more effective both as a character and in terms of the actor who plays him, as he gives him real humanity throughout.  A few scenes are simply awe-inspiring - Track 9 and 3/4 in London, playing quiddich in the air, the invisible cloak, the owl-delivery system at Hogwarts, and the 3-headed dog chose.  Maggie Smith is winning, but Robbie Coltraine steals the movie with his tender performance as Hagrid.

525643,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B00003CXI0,Josh,"[1, 1]","I know this is a movie adaptation, but it is so well crafted that I just had to do a review. Ladies and gentlemen: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I have read the books and They are absolutely wonderful from start to finish. Even 12 years later, and yet this movie is still a timeless classic. I seriously enjoy Harry Potter. Chris Columbus is a great director and watching this movie (as many times as I have) you can really tell that his heart was in the right place in making this story into one of the best movies I have seen. If you have read the books by author J K Rowling, it is obvious that the book and movie are two completely different things but the great thing I can say about Harry Potter films as a whole, is that they ALL stay close to the books; so I don't mind the films being as long as they are. Now on to the acting.There are actors who get offered movie roles, while there are actors who audition and get lucky. Luck had nothing to do with Daniel Radcliffe; because like it or not,  He IS Harry Potter. The way he moves, acts, everything about him is Harry Potter. Rupert Grint: Perfect choice for Ron Weasley (there is a humorous side to his character). Emma Watson: intelligence, wit, charm, and grace, Excellent choice for Hermione Granger. Tom Felton: again, HE IS Draco Malfoy, his movements, persona, etc. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape: dark, quiet, and just plain strange, so its easy to see why he plays Severus Snape. The actors chosen for Harry Potter all were spectacular. The story  line is intriguing as it is beguiling. And there are NO dull moments in Harry Potter. Fantasy, New worlds, and things that childhood imaginations are made of are what this movie has to offer.

The real triumph is how fully the creative team captured J.K. Rowling's imaginary world and all the important events.It's all there. Everything you loved about the book is at least alluded to in the film, it's in there somewhere. The screenwriters did not substitute their own cleverness for Rowlings' nor did they slavishly copy every detail. They used what they had to to make the story clear and sprinkled the rest in as well as they could. And they did a brilliant job of it. (It does cause some worry. Subsequent books of the series have grown longer and longer. How can they possibly fit them into a movie that doesn't last 6 hours, without leaving out an awful lot?)It's important to remember when viewing something like this (&quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is an even better example) that the book is not the story. The book tells the story in the way a book does. Movies tell stories in a different way, they're a different experience, which accounts for frequent complaints or disappointments.But &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; works as a movie without sacrificing anything of the book. And that is a terrific achievement.The DVD has plenty of special features, but they're displayed in a way that's a little too cute for me. My kids love all that schtick, but I'd just as soon scroll down a menu and click what I want instead of playing a game to get what I'm after.But that's a fairly trivial complaint, I'll admit. The packaging is pretty slick, the features (once you find them) are plentiful and interesting, and the movie is excellent.(One side note - While the special effects capture Quidditch pretty well, it only illustrates how stupid the game is. Why have all those other players when the only ones that really matter are the seekers? Why not have your other players forget the quaffle and chase the snitch? As a fairly intense sports fan, I find the broomstick game absurd, impossible to believe. I've gotta think if there really were a wizard game on brooms, it wouldn't be Quidditch, which makes no sense.)",4,"Great movie, very  good DVD",1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,2351,"['Last', 'winter', 'release', 'quot', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'quot', 'was', 'complete', 'triumph', 'setting', 'standard', 'may', 'be', 'impossible', 'future', 'films', 'series', 'meet.It', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'casting', 'especially', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'fantastic', 'digital', 'magic', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'movie', 'effects', 'real', 'triumph', 'how', 'fully', 'creative', 'team', 'captured', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'imaginary', 'world', 'important', 'events.It', 'there', 'Everything', 'loved', 'book', 'least', 'alluded', 'film', 'somewhere', 'screenwriters', 'did', 'not', 'substitute', 'own', 'cleverness', 'Rowlings', 'did', 'slavishly', 'copy', 'detail', 'used', 'what', 'had', 'make', 'story', 'clear', 'sprinkled', 'rest', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'cause', 'worry', 'Subsequent', 'books', 'series', 'have', 'grown', 'longer', 'longer', 'How', 'can', 'possibly', 'fit', 'movie', ""n't"", 'last', '6', 'hours', 'leaving', 'out', 'awful', 'lot', 'important', 'remember', 'when', 'viewing', 'something', 'quot', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'quot', 'even', 'better', 'example', 'book', 'not', 'story', 'book', 'story', 'way', 'book', 'Movies', 'tell', 'stories', 'different', 'way', ""'re"", 'different', 'experience', 'frequent', 'complaints', 'disappointments.But', 'quot', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'quot', 'movie', 'sacrificing', 'anything', 'book', 'terrific', 'achievement.The', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'special', 'features', ""'re"", 'displayed', 'way', 'little', 'too', 'cute', 'kids', 'love', 'schtick', ""'d"", 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'scroll', 'down', 'menu', 'click', 'what', 'want', 'instead', 'playing', 'game', 'get', 'what', ""'m"", 'after.But', 'fairly', 'trivial', 'complaint', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'packaging', 'pretty', 'slick', 'features', 'once', 'find', 'are', 'plentiful', 'interesting', 'movie', 'excellent', 'One', 'side', 'note', 'special', 'effects', 'capture', 'Quidditch', 'pretty', 'well', 'only', 'how', 'stupid', 'game', 'Why', 'have', 'other', 'players', 'when', 'only', 'ones', 'really', 'matter', 'are', 'seekers', 'Why', 'not', 'have', 'other', 'players', 'forget', 'quaffle', 'chase', 'snitch', 'fairly', 'intense', 'sports', 'fan', 'find', 'broomstick', 'game', 'absurd', 'impossible', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'think', 'really', 'were', 'wizard', 'game', 'brooms', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Quidditch', 'sense']",N/A

525650,A10872FHIJAKKD,B00003CXI0,Just Bill,"[129, 245]","I realize I could be tarred and feathered and run out of town for giving Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone only three stars, but please let me explain before you take up the brush and choke a few chickens.I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I was into Harry from the first book. In other words, the hype didn't compel me to read Harry. It was actually my mother. She read the first book and told me to go find it. I did. And it wasn't easy, let me tell you. Book stores at the time weren't stocked to overflowing with Harry Potter merchandise.It took me a little while to get into the first book (for some reason, I had to keep reading and re-reading the first chapter before I ""got"" it), but I soon developed Pottermania. I bought every book as it was published (I even waited in line at a local bookstore when the fourth book was released at midnight), plus all the books on CD read by Jim Dale and I even purchased the British versions of the books via Amazon.com UK.The CDs are amazing. Jim Dale is a master storyteller who performs all the voices flawlessly. (See my reviews of the CDs for more information.) I couldn't bear to get out of my car a time or two as Dale read the books. I was totally and completely engrossed.So when I first heard that they were making a movie of the first book (with a movie per book planned), I was both excited and quite skeptical. I didn't think any Hollywood version could match the Harry Potter I created in my mind, fueled by Jim Dale's skillful readings and characterizations.Well, I was right. But not because Hollywood took liberties with Harry Potter (the way they did with, say, the first Lord of the Rings movie); rather, because the movie was such a literal adaptation that I felt myself growing ever more bored, waiting for what I knew to be the next scene.Admittedly, Daniel Radcliffe is a perfect Harry Potter. But other characters didn't fare so well in my opinion. Malfoy, for example, wasn't leering and sneering enough. (And he didn't sound like Jim Dale's portrayal of him in the CD versions.) Snape wasn't sinister enough. And I wasn't bowled over by the movie version of Ron Weasley, either.And -- horror of horrors! -- I thought the Quidditch match as filmed by director Chris Columbus was a snooze-fest. Worse yet, it wasn't how I pictured it to be. Or, maybe it was EXACTLY how I pictured it to be. I don't know. All I can tell you is that I wasn't amazed or thrilled with the Quidditch playing in the movie.I know most Harry Potter fans thought the literal adaptation was being faithful to J.K. Rowling's books. But I thought the adaptation was so literal that I knew what was around every corner. It was as if I was watching a Harry Potter documentary, rather than a feature film.As I watched the movie, I kept thinking two things: (1) This is a movie, and (2) My imagination is so much greater than this movie.By the first point, I mean that I couldn't suspend disbelief long enough to get into the movie. I was always keenly aware it was a movie, a movie made from my favorite books. Again, it felt like I was watching a documentary of the Hogwarts school student.By the second point, I mean that the sights, sounds, smells and experiences of the Harry Potter books already HAD a place in my mind. This movie didn't add to them; in fact, the movie detracted from them. It simply couldn't compete with the Harry Potter I safeguarded in my head.So where does that leave me regarding the DVD release of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and -- more importantly -- the rest of the movies planned for each book?Sadly, I don't think I'll be buying the DVD. It just doesn't stand up to repeated viewings.Plus -- and this is the truly sad part -- I don't think I'll be watching any more of the movies as they're released. There's simply no point in doing so.The Harry Potter I know and love already lives -- in my head.And that's where I'd like him to remain.",3,Literal adaptation left little to the imagination,1017532800,"03 31, 2002",2002,3920,"['realize', 'could', 'be', 'tarred', 'feathered', 'run', 'town', 'giving', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'please', 'let', 'explain', 'take', 'up', 'brush', 'choke', 'few', 'chickens.I', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan', 'was', 'Harry', 'first', 'book', 'other', 'words', 'hype', 'did', ""n't"", 'compel', 'read', 'Harry', 'was', 'actually', 'mother', 'read', 'first', 'book', 'told', 'go', 'find', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'let', 'tell', 'Book', 'stores', 'time', 'were', ""n't"", 'stocked', 'overflowing', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'merchandise.It', 'took', 'little', 'while', 'get', 'first', 'book', 'reason', 'had', 'keep', 'reading', 're-reading', 'first', 'chapter', 'got', 'soon', 'developed', 'Pottermania', 'bought', 'book', 'was', 'published', 'even', 'waited', 'line', 'local', 'bookstore', 'when', 'fourth', 'book', 'was', 'released', 'midnight', 'books', 'CD', 'read', 'Jim', 'Dale', 'even', 'purchased', 'British', 'versions', 'books', 'Amazon.com', 'UK.The', 'CDs', 'are', 'amazing', 'Jim', 'Dale', 'master', 'storyteller', 'who', 'voices', 'flawlessly', 'See', 'reviews', 'CDs', 'more', 'information', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'get', 'car', 'time', 'two', 'Dale', 'read', 'books', 'was', 'totally', 'completely', 'engrossed.So', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'first', 'book', 'movie', 'book', 'planned', 'was', 'excited', 'quite', 'skeptical', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'could', 'match', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'created', 'mind', 'fueled', 'Jim', 'Dale', 'skillful', 'readings', 'characterizations.Well', 'was', 'right', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'took', 'liberties', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'way', 'did', 'say', 'first', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movie', 'rather', 'movie', 'was', 'such', 'literal', 'adaptation', 'felt', 'growing', 'ever', 'more', 'bored', 'waiting', 'what', 'knew', 'be', 'next', 'scene.Admittedly', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'perfect', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'other', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'fare', 'so', 'well', 'opinion', 'Malfoy', 'example', 'was', ""n't"", 'leering', 'sneering', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'Jim', 'Dale', 'portrayal', 'CD', 'versions', 'Snape', 'was', ""n't"", 'sinister', 'enough', 'was', ""n't"", 'bowled', 'over', 'movie', 'version', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'either.And', 'horror', 'horrors', 'thought', 'Quidditch', 'match', 'filmed', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'was', 'snooze-fest', 'Worse', 'yet', 'was', ""n't"", 'how', 'pictured', 'be', 'maybe', 'was', 'EXACTLY', 'how', 'pictured', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'amazed', 'thrilled', 'Quidditch', 'playing', 'movie.I', 'know', 'most', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fans', 'thought', 'literal', 'adaptation', 'was', 'being', 'faithful', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'books', 'thought', 'adaptation', 'was', 'so', 'literal', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'around', 'corner', 'was', 'was', 'watching', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'documentary', 'rather', 'feature', 'film.As', 'watched', 'movie', 'kept', 'thinking', 'two', 'things', '1', 'movie', '2', 'imagination', 'so', 'much', 'greater', 'first', 'point', 'mean', 'could', ""n't"", 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'movie', 'was', 'always', 'keenly', 'aware', 'was', 'movie', 'movie', 'made', 'favorite', 'books', 'Again', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'documentary', 'Hogwarts', 'school', 'student.By', 'second', 'point', 'mean', 'sights', 'smells', 'experiences', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'already', 'HAD', 'place', 'mind', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'fact', 'movie', 'detracted', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'compete', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'safeguarded', 'head.So', 'where', 'leave', 'regarding', 'DVD', 'release', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'more', 'importantly', 'rest', 'movies', 'planned', 'book', 'Sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'DVD', 'just', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings.Plus', 'truly', 'sad', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'more', 'movies', ""'re"", 'released', 'simply', 'point', 'doing', 'so.The', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'know', 'love', 'already', 'head.And', 'where', ""'d"", 'like', 'remain']",N/A

525663,A2RN05UDH183AV,B00003CXI0,"K. Bourn ""bohemiangirlpdx""","[0, 0]","I devoured the first four &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books--even driving over to a friend's house to borrow #4 when I couldn't find a place to buy a copy at 9 p.m., when I finished #3.&quot;Not as good as the book&quot; is such a cliche that, of course, I didn't expect the movie to be as good as the books.  I was pleasantly surprised--until the end of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; movie.  We'll get to that in a moment.The look of the movie is just what I thought Hogwarts and Harry's world would look like.  I love the cupboard under the stairs.  I love the owl mail.  I loved the Great Hall's ceiling change, and the different holiday decorations floating above the students' heads.  The Quiddich match was fun to watch.  Diagon Alley was more than I could take in.  Watching the chocolate frogs jump around was a nice surprise.  Wow!On reflection, the depth of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series comes in the later books, as Harry learns more about his parents, and the one whose name we shall not utter.  The fun of the first book was the how Rowling created Harry's world.  So in that sense, I think that the movie works well in recreating that world.  After the previews came out, I read criticism that the movie did not appear &quot;dark&quot; enough, that Hogwarts appears to fresh and clean.  Granted, the Quiddich scenes and the broom-riding lesson scene take place under bright sunny skies, but the interior scenes seem gothic enough to satisfy those wanting a darker look.The young actors chosen to play the three leads--Harry, Ron and Hermione--have a great chemistry.  I hope that they will continue through the remaining movies.While I loved the movie, I do have a few criticisms.  First of all, where was the Potions Room?  Everyone I know who both read the book and saw the movie was disappointed that this room was left out.  For those few who have done neither, I will back up a bit and explain.  In &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; Harry, Ron and Hermione gradually put together that a mysterious package that Hagrid the Giant picks up at Gringotts Bank, a break-in at Gringotts, the warnings about staying off the third floor, and other incidents all seem to be related.  Thus, as the novelty of Harry discovering the world of wizardry wears off, the movie delves more into this mystery.Ultimately, the trio decide they need to try to get past the various magical barriers to protect the Sorcerer's Stone.  One of the strengths of the book was that this process involved critical talents of all three friends--Ron's chess playing, Hermione's riddle solving, and Harry, well, that would be giving away too much.  Hermione's key contribution comes in the Potions Room, where she and Harry have to select from among several drinks--some poison--in order to advance closer to the Sorcerer's Stone.  In the movie, however, Hermione merely recognizes the plant in which they are entangled--thanks to her overzealous studying--and explains what to do to get through.  The scene merely enforces her being a &quot;know-it-all.&quot;My other criticism is that, for all its wonderful &quot;eye candy&quot; qualities, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; seems to lack the warmth of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;  Perhaps had these two movies not premiered so close together, the comparison would not so immediately come to mind.

Well, movies don't always have to be taken as seriously as books do.  Not only that, but it is extremely entertaining without having to deal with childish narrative or the fact that there are a billion fantasy stories like this.  Harry Potter is just a fun movie, and while I only recommend the books for those who need a break from Dostoyevsky and Victor Hugo (and certainly, we all need a break from serious books now and then), this movie has something for everybody, and can be watched anytime.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 5]","Naysayer after naysayer tries to write off this film, and those which followed, as well as the books, as fluff for kids.  Others went as far to say that this franchise had satanic or evil qualities about it.  I say that's a bunch of bull.  These movies and books do something for kids(and adults) that hasn't been done since films like &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; and the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy came along.  It allows kids to use their imagination.  It gives them hope that there is something magical and wonderful in this world.  Regardless if you believe in witchcraft or anything of that sort, let kids have some FUN!.  Sorry to be preachy, but for the last fifteen or so years, kids have been hammered with &quot;suggestions&quot; from professionals, preachers and the ACLU as to what they should be watching and doing.  Well guess what folks, kids need to have fun.  Granted, they do need to learn right from wrong and good from evil, but they have to live a little as well.&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone&quot; gives kids a chance to laugh, scream in fear and be awed all at the same time.  Who in their right mind didn't pretend to be a wizard, witch, knight, cowboy, football star, etc. when they were growing up.  Today's kids have been robbed of that privilege by overprotective parents and worry-wart professionals.So just sit back, relax and watch a pretty cool kid do some pretty cool things.  Harry is a wonderful role-model for kids.  He is respectful of others, minds most of the rules(the ones he breaks are broken with the best intentions), and fights for what's right.  He doesn't whine about being in a rough situation.  He makes decisions that would make any parent proud.  Oh, and by the way, he doesn't use his powers for evil purposes.  He actually fights evil.Please don't let the whackos scare you away from this movie or anything related to it.  I'm a Catholic convert, and if you know anything about Catholic converts, you know that we're pretty holy-roly.  I don't see anything evil or satanic about Harry or any of his friends.  I'm not afraid that I'll find my daughter doing incantations sometime in the future trying to conjure up some evil spirit.  Instead, she'll be using her imagination, much like all of the kids that I grew up with, and pretending to be a warrior or a crimefighter or even a witch!  Who cares?  Just let the kiddies have some fun and quit strangling their childhood.Sorry for going off, but in today's world, somebody has to say something.  God bless you J.K. Rowling, for bringing wonder and imagination back to life in a time where so many are trying to destroy it.Highly recommended film, highly recommended book.

But, they do a good job living up to Rowling's epic books!The actors that play Ron and Hermoine are perfectly cast. And although Radcliffe may seem the perfect choice as Harry since he has features and maturity I still believe Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest actor among them. Although he does a great job anyway.

It also keeps them that way EVERY time we play it.  They just don't get bored, and there are fewer trips to the emergency room.This is because the movie itself is a really well done version of a pretty good book.  I do think there are better books out there (the Narnia Series, for one) but Harry appeals to kids' sense of being unique, different and special.  Heck, it appeals to adults' (mine included) same sense.  I want to find the special train track myself, and I wish I could prove that all along my suspicions that maybe I was adopted or something were true and I was really this long-lost hero of a special world.  Maybe that sense of being special can help the ordinary muggles like me want to BE special, and do good things.  I think it's worth a try, and if it's at the cost of a movie rather than years of therapy, it's probably worth it.The movie's action sequences are well drawn, the magic believable, the actor who plays Harry looks the part, and I loved the way they made Quidditch look real.  Get this for your kids.  They will learn something about how treating people the way you'd like to be treated yourself is a good thing.

While everyone else was going to the movie, I had to wait another nine months in order to enjoy it. Movies such as Spider-Man can be somewhat enjoyable if you cannot hear the sound or speech, but for something like Harry Potter, where the writing and the interaction between all the characters in the book are so key to understanding, those of us with no hearing need to wait until someone bothers to caption them.Sometimes I am disappointed because the build-up by the media and word-of-mouth is such that I expect more from the movie than it is able to provide. That wasn't the case with this movie/DVD. As someone who remembers going to the library and reading every possible book I could get on mythology, the Grimm Brothers, Hans Christian Anderson, many science fiction books written for children, and all books written on Merlin and the Arthurian legend, I was pleased when this generation had a book come out involving fantasy and fairy tale, that could withstand the test of time. The movie did a spectacular job of following the high precedent set by the book. Rowling was right to keep such strong control over her books so that they would be faithful to what she wrote.The movie is spectacular in special effects and in casting not only Harry, but his cohorts. Radcliffe is a read find and his humility in playing this part makes for one of the least obnoxious child actors I've ever seen. You can tell the kids had great fun making this movie in spite of the work. It's nice to see so many great British actors and actressess participating in this endeavor to bring the book to life. Thank heavens, Richard Harris' granddaughter threatened him if he didn't take the part of the headmaster of the school. And as a deaf person who relies upon facial expression, I waited with impatience for Rickman to show up and pull his usual glowering looks...he didn't disappoint.This is not a movie for small children. My grandchildren couldn't sit still that long. They come and go while watching this, but the rest of us thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband didn't get some of it because he didn't read the book.

My brother and I were quite disappointed, while my mother enjoyed it.  Probably because she'd never read the books.The difficulty I had with the movie is that it made *such* an effort to be true to the book, that the 90% of the book that was cut for time was all the more obvious and disappointing.  The end result was a set of disjointed scenes that contained the bare minumum of information that the screenwriters could convey and still advance the plot.Most of the character development (and actually, several of the *characters*) was cut for time.  All dialogue was so intent on getting the needed information to the audience in as short a time as possible, that the conversations seemed forced - quite unlike the natural flow of the book's dialogue.  And the humor - one of the biggest strengths of the books - was eliminated almost entirely (Fred and George, for example, had a grand total of three short scenes and two jokes).  The most touching scenes of the book (Dumbledore's &quot;she loved you&quot; exchange with Harry at the end, and Hagrid's gift of the pictures of Harry's parents) were present, but rushed and not developed, and so they carried no emotional impact.  Particularly since the movie cut most of the information that would have gotten across just how starved for love Harry had been with the Dursleys.As for the acting, it was passable.  Harry's actor needs some work.  Ron and Hermione are well played, as are Snape, Quirell, and Hagrid.  Dumbledore (what little we saw of him) was well-played, but seemed considerably more tired than I pictured.  I saw no twinkle in his eyes, and he wasn't nearly as inspiring as in the books.Most of my problems relate to the cutting, which was of course necessary because of time constraints.

525678,A34CVGYUNAUJF,B00003CXI0,"KNO2skull ""kn02skull""","[1, 2]","Any comparisions to ""Chronicles of Narnia"" or ""Wizard of Oz"" are simply erronious and insulting, .... These series are well written and read classics. The word 'classic' does not come to mind when viewing or reading ""Harry Potter"". It's an alright book, but not phenomena like ""C.O.N"" or ""W.O.O."". Someone pointed out that this drivel will be read again and again, and that makes it classic. Go to it, but good writing will always be the preference of those with taste. Certainly, ""C.O.N."" Chronicles' is moralistic, but more, it's well written, and will be read over and over again (entering a 3rd time, as many will attest).  So too, will 'The Earthsea Trilogy' by LeGuin, and L.O.R. be read over and over again.  However, this should not be a test of a 'Classic' novel; for most people (accurately) consider ""Moby Dick"" and ""War And Peace"" classics, but few will ever read them more than once.  Who cares if the miraculous happens over and over?  I don't see how it is missing in C.O.N., but then, talking animals and a interdimensional portals to lands full of mythic and magical creatures happens every day in my house.  The miraculous occurs often in a lot of namable dime-store novels and children's books that are long since forgotten by most, (the 'Mushroom Planet' series comes immediately to mind). People read 'Nancy Drew' over and over again, good stories, but not classics. This goes beyond the point of the DVD, but people in search of good fantasy fiction should not be lead to believe this is on the level of these other stories. So, this review addresses the story, which is in both the book and film.Essentially, in this installment, Harry Potter discovers after growing up a group of ""muggles"" (non-magical people, usually displayed as boring and bigoted people by boring and bigoted witches and wizards, the ""moralization"" being here that magical people are better somehow, or at least think they are) that he is accepted to a Wizard's School, (a topic given far better treatment in Ursula K. LeGuin's ""Earthsea Trilogy""), and begins his fabulous journey. He arrives at wizard school, and becomes something of a celebrity who quickly rises to the top. He discovers a transparent conspiracy (one that any of the adult magicians should have been able to see) and sets off to solve the mystery.This movie, like the book that's based on, is fairly boring and superfluous. The tasks Harry has to go through to defeat the villian are not very difficult, and thus not very interesting. It is ludicrous that this series of books and movies are controversial, where it doesn't have anything of true value concerning magic, wizards or witches. Nor does it have interesting lessons, analogies or allusions.The special effects are fairly clunky CGI work, (watch the centaur scene for jilting movements). The sets and the look of the film are both fantastic, and the 'quiditch' scene is fun to watch, though you never get the sense that Potter is ever in any real danger. The extras on the DVD are silly, and don't warrant a second disc. Though extra scenes are always nice to see.Though a children's film, there is nothing here to make a comparison to any of the classic stories realistic. It compares better with Nancy Drew or Encyclopedia Brown than some of those that have been loosely thrown about (perchance by people that have not read the series they insult by comparing it to Harry Potter). I actually enjoyed reading Harry Potter's first book though I'm not a child, but there was really nothing warranting the high praise it has gotten aside from good marketing. It just reminds me that there are better children's stories out there, such as the now defunct ""Mushroom Planet"" series. This movie is an enjoyable watch, but don't expect ""Lord of the Rings"" quality of storytelling.",3,A near exact film adaption of an O.K. book,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,3798,"['comparisions', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'are', 'simply', 'erronious', 'insulting', 'series', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'read', 'classics', 'word', 'not', 'come', 'mind', 'when', 'viewing', 'reading', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'alright', 'book', 'not', 'phenomena', 'C.O.N', 'W.O.O.', 'Someone', 'pointed', 'out', 'drivel', 'will', 'be', 'read', 'again', 'again', 'classic', 'Go', 'good', 'writing', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'preference', 'taste', 'Certainly', 'C.O.N', 'Chronicles', 'moralistic', 'more', 'well', 'written', 'will', 'be', 'read', 'over', 'again', 'entering', '3rd', 'time', 'many', 'will', 'attest', 'So', 'too', 'will', ""'The"", 'Earthsea', 'Trilogy', 'LeGuin', 'L.O.R', 'be', 'read', 'over', 'again', 'However', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'test', ""'Classic"", 'novel', 'most', 'people', 'accurately', 'consider', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'War', 'Peace', 'classics', 'few', 'will', 'ever', 'read', 'more', 'once', 'Who', 'miraculous', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'missing', 'C.O.N.', 'then', 'talking', 'animals', 'interdimensional', 'portals', 'lands', 'full', 'mythic', 'magical', 'creatures', 'day', 'house', 'miraculous', 'occurs', 'often', 'lot', 'namable', 'dime-store', 'novels', 'children', 'books', 'are', 'long', 'forgotten', 'most', ""'Mushroom"", 'Planet', 'series', 'immediately', 'mind', 'People', 'read', ""'Nancy"", 'Drew', 'over', 'again', 'good', 'stories', 'not', 'classics', 'point', 'DVD', 'people', 'search', 'good', 'fantasy', 'fiction', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'lead', 'believe', 'level', 'other', 'stories', 'So', 'review', 'story', 'book', 'film.Essentially', 'installment', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'discovers', 'growing', 'up', 'group', 'muggles', 'non-magical', 'people', 'usually', 'displayed', 'boring', 'bigoted', 'people', 'boring', 'bigoted', 'witches', 'wizards', 'moralization', 'being', 'here', 'magical', 'people', 'are', 'better', 'somehow', 'least', 'think', 'are', 'accepted', 'Wizard', 'School', 'topic', 'given', 'far', 'better', 'treatment', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'LeGuin', 'Earthsea', 'Trilogy', 'fabulous', 'journey', 'wizard', 'school', 'something', 'celebrity', 'who', 'quickly', 'top', 'transparent', 'conspiracy', 'one', 'adult', 'magicians', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'off', 'solve', 'mystery.This', 'movie', 'book', 'based', 'fairly', 'boring', 'superfluous', 'tasks', 'Harry', 'go', 'defeat', 'villian', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'difficult', 'thus', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'ludicrous', 'series', 'books', 'movies', 'are', 'controversial', 'where', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'true', 'value', 'concerning', 'magic', 'wizards', 'witches', 'have', 'interesting', 'lessons', 'analogies', 'allusions.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fairly', 'clunky', 'CGI', 'work', 'watch', 'centaur', 'scene', 'jilting', 'movements', 'sets', 'look', 'film', 'are', 'fantastic', ""'quiditch"", 'scene', 'fun', 'watch', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'Potter', 'ever', 'real', 'danger', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'silly', 'do', ""n't"", 'warrant', 'second', 'disc', 'extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'always', 'nice', 'see.Though', 'children', 'film', 'nothing', 'here', 'make', 'comparison', 'classic', 'stories', 'realistic', 'better', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Encyclopedia', 'Brown', 'have', 'been', 'loosely', 'thrown', 'perchance', 'people', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'series', 'insult', 'comparing', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'first', 'book', ""'m"", 'not', 'child', 'there', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'warranting', 'high', 'praise', 'gotten', 'aside', 'good', 'marketing', 'just', 'are', 'better', 'children', 'stories', 'there', 'such', 'now', 'Mushroom', 'Planet', 'series', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'quality', 'storytelling']",N/A

On his 11th birthday, Harry discovers he is a wizard and happily leaves home for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  There, he makes his first-ever pals - classmates Ron and Hermione, and their friendship is the heart of the story. We follow the trio as they go through their first year at school attending magic classes, finding adventure, and even solving a mystery that puts Harry face-to-face with the dark wizard who killed his parents.Radcliffe captures the innocence and sadness of Harry, as well as his daring-do and sense of fun. Rupert Grint, as his sidekick Ron, delivers most of the comedy lines and is very appealing. Emma Watson plays Hermione with a heart of gold underneath her bookish bossiness. They are supported by a stellar cast, including Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman.

Individually I love each of the first two movies. The first 2 happen to be my all-time favorites from the franchise so far (Year 1 is the best in my opinion). I got both Ultimate Editions on blu-ray even though I already owned the first dvd releases of the movies. However, my parents gave me both versions of the films in the full-screen format. So, not only did I want to rectify this error, I also wanted them to be in a higher quality. I plan to do the same for the next six Ultimate Editions.I was astounded by the improved quality of the movies in their Blu-ray format and I enjoyed the extended versions that are also included in this set. But the thing that really sold the Ultimate Editions were the Special Features! The ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" documentaries are brilliant. Each of them are over an hour long and give in-depth details about specific aspects of the films (how the film started, how the characters were adapted and cast), the next two Ultimate Editions will deal with creating the creatures and the music. The best part about these documentaries is that they deal with the characters, creatures, etc from films 1-6. Also included are all the special features from the original DVD releases. Also included in the sets is a fourth disk containing a digital copy of the film.The only flaws with these editions are the character cards and the booklets. Usually when I get these type of releases with the booklets (which I enjoy looking at) I feel like they are putting them in there to raise the price a bit.

Most critics feel if there's a fault to the film, it's that it's TOO faithful to the book.  It'd been some time since I'd read the book when I viewed the film.  I kept saying, ""Oh, I remember that!""  Chris Columbus has done an excellent job bringing this magical world to screen.  I think Harry Potter, films included, will become as a part of our culture as Peter Pan.The actors are each wonderful in the movie, although action rather than character development is the strength.  Daniel Radcliffe does a great job showing the innocence and bravery of Harry.  Rupert Grint is a hoot as Ron.  Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore gives such a calm wisdom to the part.  Maggie Smith as McGonagall is as wonderful as she was in ""Gosford Park.""  Robbie Coltrane who played a great buddy to Johnny Depp in ""From Hell"" does a great job as the half-giant Hagrid.  Alan Rickman perfected screen villany in ""Die Hard"" and ""Robin Hood""; so we love to hate his wonderful sneer.  He also performed the great service of seeing Sean Biggerstaff who plays the Quidditch team's head Oliver Wood in a stage play, giving him his first screen break in ""The Winter's Guest.""  Biggerstaff was my favorite of the supporting actors.  Fiona Shaw is delightful as the spiteful Aunt Petunia.  Tom Felton has come a long way since appearing with Jodie Foster in ""Anna & the King"" to his role as the hateful Draco Malfoy.  John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander the wand salesman does a nice cameo too.The effects in the film are excellent.  We really believe in Harry's invisibility cloak.  It's such a hoot to see him at night in the restricted section of the library with his hand holding a lantern poking out from under the cloak, as if the hand wouldn't give him away!  The three-headed dog, the plant that smothers and the flying keys are all marvelous effects.The DVD version's second disc takes you on an interesting tour of Hogwarts.

525705,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00003CXI0,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 3]","Harry Potter is a guilty pleasure.  When I read the books and when I watched the movie, I had to suspend my normal criticism of implausibilities and read the books and watch the movie as an entertaining fantasy; and the movie is ever so entertaining!  Even having read the book, I was still in suspense with the movie, because certain things were given more life in the movie than the book (and vice versa).  I found myself fascinated with each detail, and was readily able to consider the movie as a different version of the book.The actors were perfectly chosen for their roles.  Alan Rickman as Snape was so dislikable and the perfect character to mislead the audience.  Richard Harris was a lovable Dumbledore, and will be sorely missed in the future movies, which there will undoubtedly be.  Warwick Davis of ""Willow"", ""Return of the Jedi"", ""The 10th Kingdom"" and many more played two roles in this movie, and played them very well.  There are many other actors that did so very well, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out the selection of Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, the terminally cute Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and super-nice (at least he comes across that way on the screen, regardless of how many practical jokes and other mischief he performed on the set while making the movie) Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter.  These three were able to make the adults wish they were their children, and the children wish they were their friends.  A good deal of the success of this movie is due to the charm of these three young actors.The score completely enhanced the sets and the plot, and brought another dimension to an already multi-dimensional movie.  The special effects were state of the art, evidenced time and again throughout the course of the movie.  The troll and Fluffy I particularly found impressive in their detail and quality.  However, the special effects and their quality are found throughout this movie, and to list all my favorites would take much more than this review.  There are a lot, and they are all very good to excellent.The movie had to deviate from the book due to the length and detail of the book.  However, I believe that the movie caught the essence of Harry's life and attendance at Hogwart's.  The deviations were regrettable, but the movie was already well past 2 hours in length, and the producer was faced with difficult decisions regarding what to keep and what to cut.  The deleted scenes shown in the second CD will show how some of the decisions were made, and I concur with nearly all the choices.Harry Potter is a pure fantasy, creating a world that is based on many worlds, and yet is none of them.  The rules of Harry's world will seem familiar, yet as a set are different from previous rules.  Once you realized that J.K. Rowling was not basing Harry on any known set of rules, but was instead creating her own ""Oz"", the movie and story become enjoyable as a voyage of discovery that parallels Harry's own.

525718,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00003CXI0,"Maine Writer ""David""","[0, 2]","Maybe. But this is a somewhat pleasant and unimaginatively flat movie--not the enthralling adventure that some reviewers would have you believe. First, it lacks the dark humor which gave the book life--the Roald Dahl-style sensibility that made you actually indentify with Harry. This movie has little sense of humor at all--and what it has is canned, pure and simple. Second, this film evinces an attitude that all that you really need to be an actor is to be very British. I guess. To be sure, Robbie Coltrane is fine in his role as a feeble-minded giant with a heart of gold, but a better script could have catapolted his role even higher. The kid who plays Harry is entirely unengaging. He brings none of the sly vulnerability to the role that would have made him interesting. Instead, he is this rather bland kid with glasses who effortlessly glides through a plot which cannot produce a single moment of convincing danger. Harry, in other words, is coated in teflon and a bullet-proof suit in this movie--never once do we think any harm is even remotely on the horizon.

THIS MOVIE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!  DON'T COME HOME WITHOUT IT!&quot; and leave it at that.  For one thing, it really is that good.  For another, there is so much to say about it that one's mind boggles at trying to keep within a reasonable limit.  Since there will be countless reviews that discuss plot, effects, and individual performances, I will leave those to others, and focus on some things that I found of special note.The first thing that struck me about the film (other than the fact that I was unable to stop staring at my monitor while it was playing) is the sense of 'rightness' one gets while watching.  What I mean by that is, given a book that has way too many events to capture in a film, the production still manages to have delivered everything that was necessary and sufficient to make it seem true to the original.  This may actually be a first in cinematographic history.  Given a tremendous opportunity to tweak or modify the plot or improve on the character the producers have instead remained almost completely faithful to J. K. Rowling's writing and intent.One of the factors in this is the carefully balanced acting.  Given that the title is &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,&quot; it really should be &quot;Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Draco and even the Weasley's AND the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot;  Nobody grandstands, nobody overplays his or her part, and nobody ever goes Hollywood.  Star or part of the background, there is a lack of pretentiousness (except when one is supposed to be pretentious) which makes you really feel like you are looking into the life of a notable student and his friends at Hogwarts.  This invites viewers to immerse themselves in entire tapestry instead of simply hanging on the actions of a particular actor.  And what a tapestry it is!Like the book, the film turns out to be just as meaningful for the old and the young.  The lessons are delivered in easily digestible bits, leaving the flow of the story undisturbed.  Somehow, inside, a part of you knows that maybe, just maybe, you are a little bit better for having watched this film.  Harry's need for family, accomplishment, and self-esteem is no stranger to any of us who seek the courage to face our own 'He Who Shall Not Be Named.'

But he does not know that, for his mean-spirited aunt and uncle had falsely told him that his parents had 'died in a car-crash'. Of course, there's the fat cousin, too.One day, he discovers all about his parents, his real history, and also about the wonderful school for wizards and witches at Hogwarts when Hagrid, the keeper of keys and something(I forgot) of Hogwarts, meets him on Harry's 11th birthday. Of course, Harry leaves his aunt, uncle, and cousin and goes to Hogwarts with Hagrid.The story goes on about a mysterious stone that makes you live eternally and a three-headed dog that's, obviously, VERY dangerous. It's all very interesting!I think some kids might(MIGHT!) get scared some parts, like the part where the bad guy(not saying who!) shows his two-faced head. Or the part where Harry's opening a book and the face comes roaring out. THAT was surprising and scary in a way.

They treated him barely better then a servant.All that changes one day when he finds out that he's a wizard.  Suddenly, he's introduced to a world that he doesn't know yet where he's famous.  Before it all really sinks in, he's off to Hogwarts for his first year of schooling in the art of magic.There, he makes friends with Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).  But he also makes enemies in the form of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), a snobbish student.  He evens seems to have attracted the negative attention of one of the teachers.But under all the fun, a serious danger lurks.  And Harry is stumbling upon the pieces.  Will he figure it out?  What can an inexperienced wizard do against overwhelming powers?This movie was my introduction to Harry's world.  Now I'm going back and watching it again after having read the books.  I was pleased to see just how faithful it really was to the story.  It tried to stay as true as it could to the book.  The set, costumes, and special effects all worked well to bring the world of the books to vivid life.But that faithfulness is also the movie's downfall.  Outside of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, none of the characters get much in the way of development.  Additionally, the story takes a while to really get going.

This is one of the best family movies of this new century and it moderns classic fantasy movie tales like the Wizard of Oz. It's so good because it stays true to it's roots and it dosn't offend the original book.Harry Potter(Radcliffe) has no idea that he's a wizard. He has no idead that as a baby he stoped the most evil dark lord wizard the world has ever known. Harry lives with his mean Aunt and Uncle along with their son Dudley who hate him because he ins't normal. After letters start appearing at the home inviting Harry to Hogwarts School of Wizardy and Witchcraft he starts to realize things might not be what they seem to be.Harry is rescued by his mean family by Hadgrid(Coltran). He arrives at Hogwars almost an instant celebrity because of his defeat of Voldemort as a child. He quickly becomes friends with an outcast Ron Weasley(Grint) and miss know it all Hermoine(Watson). The three develop a quick friendship and are all the three really have. Trouble starts to arise at the school though and because I don't want to spoil the details for you, but it's up to the three to save the day.One of the reasons this movie is so good is because of the awesome cast. All three of the big young kids are perfect. Radcliffe got hand selected from thousands of kids who wanted the part and he's a good child actor. A lot of kids stuggle with such big roles. Look how much Jake Elliot struggled in The Phantom Menace. So much is on there shoulders and Radcliffe picks the ball up and runs with it. He's perfect as Potter.All the adults are casted perfectly also. Alan Rickman is great as Snape. This guy can flat out act and you have to love him in the film. He is so awesome. I like Richard Harris as Dumbeldore. This was one of the last performances of his legendary carear and it's great.Chris Columbus did a great job with this film. This guy was perfect for the movie. He's done blockbuster family films like Home Alone and Mrs.Doubtfire and he can add this one to the list. He shot the movie well and made it an instant family classic.A lot of respect has to be given to Steven Kloves. He wrote the script for the movie based of the writings form J.K. Rowling. He stayed true to her book and didn't offend her or the fans. To many writers do that way to often and it's glad to see it not be done.If you want to sit down with your family and watch a great family movie than this is it.

525733,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXI0,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","The staggering success of J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter novels put enormous pressures on the producers of the movie version of the first book in a the series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". This was the most eagerly anticipated movie based on a book since ""Gone With the Wind"" sixty-two years ago.I am happy to report that the movie turns out to be quite good. If it has a problem, it is that it is too slavishly faithful to the book. This prevents the movie from soaring to the great heights a visual medium can reach on its own terms and makes it run a bit too long. Two and one-half hours is a long time for most kids to sit still; however, there are enough sights and thrills here for most of them to tolerate its length happily.For those of you who don't know, Harry Potter [Daniel Radcliffe] is an orphan who lives in the cupboard under the stairs of his uncaring relatives' suburban home. One day he and his guardians are inundated by letters [delivered by owls!] which say that Harry has been accepted into Hogwarts School. This is how Harry finds out that he's a wizard. After much magical persuasion, Harry gets to go to Hogwarts. There, he meets wizards and witches, sorcerers and trolls, and other fantastic creatures. For the first time ever, Harry feels like he's at home. There are a lot of happy, magical moments at the school, but there are also dangerous ones. Among them are a dark wood that students are never to enter, an evil professor, some not-so-nice fellow students, and a demon that wants Harry dead. Harry and his new best friends, Ronald and Hemione [Rupert Grint and Emma Watson], are in for many fantastic adventures.The excellent cast includes some of Britain's best actors, including the legendary Maggie Smith as Minerva and Richard Harris as Demeledore.  Robbie Coltrane is remarkable as Hadrid, the loveable giant who is always doing and saying the wrong things, and so is Alan Rickman as the nasty Professor Snape. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are gifted young actors and play their characters without the annoying cuteness that is found in many kids' movies.Some of the special effects are amazing, especially the flying Quiddich game sequences and one involving an encounter with a giant chess set that comes to life. Many of the effects don't look lifelike, but, considering the movie's big budget, this may have been done on purpose, in order to give the movie a fantasy, dream-like look.Some of the movie may be too intense for very young children. This has always been a problem with movies, though. When I was five or six, I was totally traumatized by the wicked queen and her poisoned apple in Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"". I don't like apples to this day.

The story is told in the most interesting ways possible, keeping me entertained to the max, even though I had no idea what to expect, and seeing a film that wasnt really aimed at me.Harry Potter is the type of movie that makes your forget you live in reality, which in itself is the most fun you could have for 2 hours.It has a Lord of the Rings feel to it, in the way of it being a fantasy film.  It doesnt need to explain why things are happening the way they are.  They happen, and your happy with that.The characters are all very likable even the sinsister ones.  Alan Rickman seems to be having the most fun as the villan Snape.Like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter has the sequel vibe all through it.  2 hours is clearly not enough time for the plot be be filled.  However this movie uses its time very wise, and doesnt drag at any point.The special effects are excellent.  We know brooms cant fly, and there are no two headed monsters, but if there were... maybe this is what they would look like.  There is a scene where the charcters are pawns on a chess board, the effects look like something out of Jumangi.All in all, I had a big smile on my face in the end, as I turned to my nephew we both had the same idea....""Let's get back in line"".",5,"Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings,  2 Pleasant surprises",1015977600,"03 13, 2002",2002,1488,"['Having', 'little', 'knowledge', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'being', 'Star', 'Wars', 'generation', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'film.This', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'upcomings', 'doesnt', 'need', 'hour', 'boring', 'storytelling', 'bring', 'veiwer', 'speed', 'story', 'told', 'most', 'interesting', 'ways', 'possible', 'keeping', 'entertained', 'max', 'even', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'seeing', 'film', 'really', 'aimed', 'me.Harry', 'Potter', 'type', 'movie', 'forget', 'live', 'reality', 'most', 'fun', 'could', 'have', '2', 'hours.It', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'feel', 'way', 'being', 'fantasy', 'film', 'doesnt', 'need', 'explain', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'way', 'are', 'happen', 'happy', 'that.The', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'even', 'sinsister', 'ones', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'be', 'having', 'most', 'fun', 'villan', 'Snape.Like', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'sequel', 'vibe', '2', 'hours', 'clearly', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'plot', 'be', 'be', 'filled', 'However', 'movie', 'time', 'very', 'wise', 'doesnt', 'drag', 'point.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'know', 'brooms', 'cant', 'fly', 'are', 'two', 'headed', 'monsters', 'were', 'maybe', 'what', 'would', 'look', 'scene', 'where', 'charcters', 'are', 'pawns', 'chess', 'board', 'effects', 'look', 'something', 'Jumangi.All', 'had', 'big', 'smile', 'face', 'end', 'turned', 'nephew', 'had', 'same', 'idea', 'Let', 'get', 'back', 'line']",N/A

Then I had to get the films - I swear Harry Potter has become my latest obsession! Even though I hated the first book with a passion, the film was so much better, although it does drag in the middle. And obviously there's gonna be a lot missing from the books, but minor bits so far - I dread to think how much is going to be cut from the films in the later ones!What had me transfixed about this movie was a very small thing - that recurring theme that keeps playing. I love it! It sounds like a lullaby, or even the tunes that play in one of those jewellery boxes that you have as a kid (I did anyway). It's also the tune that is played to send Fluffy to sleep, and Hagrid is also seen playing it at one point. I have never loved a piece of music in a film before as much as I do this one.The actors in this are brilliant and even the kids are quite good. I'm definitely gonna be crushing on Daniel Radcliffe in the later films by the looks of it! I do hope the kids get to play Harry, Ron & Hermione right through to the very last film. I also love the little characters that appear, although some of the ghosts didn't turn up as much - I do hope Peeves (played by Rik Mayall) appears in the later films, as I loved him. I loved the way John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick) appears, although I originally mistook him for Billy Connolly! And I loved Hagrid, played by Robbie Coltrane, and I was fascinated by the way they managed to film him looking so much bigger - can I please borrow his platforms?! Although if you look closely in the very first scene where he appears, he looks a normal size. Robbie's 6'10"" body double for Hagrid is former England rugby international, Martin Bayfield. I must applaud JK for making sure all the cast were British in this, apart from a few exceptions: Richard Harris was Irish, and Zo Wanamaker, though she has made her name as a ""British"" actress, is actually a US citizen. Alan Rickman, although having a very small role initially, was fabulous as Snape, although he seemed to be wearing more makeup than I do on an average day. Did anyone else notice the look he gives Malfoy in the first Potions class?Steven Spielberg was originally offered the role as director, but can you imagine he actually wanted Hayley Joel Osment to play Harry? I just cannot imagine that working!I hated the fact that the film & book were changed in the US, from Philosopher's Stone to Sorcerer's Stone. It's so stupid, and I do hope they don't change any of the other names. And the region 1 has a better cover.I hope some of the later films get a higher rating, as the later books get more adult orientated. The word 'bloody' appears in the film six times, along with one 'arse', one 'bugger', and two 'blasted's. This, and some apparently scary scenes in the haunted forest, led to its PG certificate. Frankly, they were not that scary!Most of the stuff transferred well from print to film, especially Quidditch & Platform 9 3/4. While the movie used Platforms 4 and 5 at Kings Cross to represent platforms 9 and 10, there is, in fact a ""Platform 9 3/4"" at Kings Cross. It's located in the walkway area between the intercity section and the section where the real platforms 9 and 10 are, and was obviously put there for fans of Harry Potter.I have to say, I would have preferred a bigger glimpse into the classes, we really don't see many of the classes, or the different passwords to get into the dormitories. (I HATE that word.) I suppose this was unnecessary to show in the films. And I don't remember the staircases moving in the books though? And why did we never see the history teacher who was a ghost? I physically hate Tom Felton, who plays Draco - he's just the kinda face that only a mother would love (in the film!), especially with that slicked back hair.This is a DVD where the extras are hyped up loads, and fail miserably to deliver. I thought they were lousy. Why were there no interviews with the stars? Why did we have to listen to Chris Columbus babble on, with a bunch of other people we don't care about? Why was the adventure 'game' so hard to get through?

I was surprised to see how close the movie was to the book, though it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen.The acting among the younger group wasn't too bad, but the legends such as Richard Harris and Alan Rickman were remarkable, making their characters come to life.  The special effects weren't that impressive--the Quidditch scenes were cool, but a little too obvious that they weren't real.  And the troll in the girls' bathroom...well...that speaks for itself.  In spite of that, it was a great movie that anyone of any age can enjoy.The one thing I must rant about is the bonus features disc.  It might be appealing to a younger child who enjoys games, but for an older person who is looking for behind-the-scenes features, this is not it.  The entire disc is mostly a game where you go to Diagon Alley to buy your wand and such and it's nearly impossible to find the deleted scenes.

It's an imaginative, fascinating, fun-filled, awe-inspiring movie for all ages, regardless of whether you've read the books or not. (As a matter of fact it was watching this movie that I fell into the Potter mania and started devouring all the books).You will love everything about the movie including the strong characters with their down-to-earth attitude inside their magical worlds and the fascinating possibilities and intricate plots and sub-plots presented in this movie and developed through the series. You'll also enjoy the brilliantly used visual effects, the fantastic scenery, the emotional musical score and, of course, the enchanting, captivating, and sometimes amusing, magic that will take you away to a bewitching place.In this movie Harry discovers, under very unusual circumstances, on his eleventh birthday, that he is a Wizard. He leaves the normal world of Muggles (non-magical folk) where he lives with his Aunt and Uncle and goes to Hogwarts School to be trained in Witchcraft and Wizard. He meets new friends, learns what happened to his parents who died when he was a baby, faces the evil Voldemort for the first time, and shows his courage, bravery and determination trying to prevent the Sorcerer's Stone from falling into the wrong hands.Not only does this movie faithfully captures the world J. K. Rowling created in her books, it also enhances it as only a well made film adaptation can. The actors are so well picked and their performances are so compelling that you'll never read any of the books without imagining the actors in the roles they played.Don't believe the criticism that accuses Harry Potter of being a bad influence on kids and religion before giving it a chance. You will see for yourself that it is not. It is a good-natured story for children (and adults, too) about a group of good-natured characters that face difficult situations and have to put their values and principles to the test in order to triumph over the obstacles they face.Buy this movie and enjoy it with your children and/or the kid inside you.

The movie follows the book suprisingly well, although I believe if I had not read the book first some of the mystery of the movie would have just been confusion. All of the kids in the movie work well together. The acting isn't Oscar material, of course, but for a fun family movie it works. Since the young actors did do so well together I would have liked to seen the deleted scenes added into the movie. The special effects are believable and makes the Quidditch scene great. It does run pretty long for a movie aimed at younger viewers but being an older, more patient viewer, I wouldn't of minded if it made a whole 3 hours.As for the DVD, they could have done a little better. I found it was geared more toward children. You have to go through hoops just to see the 7 deleted scenes. The Interview with the director and others that helped make the movie is about the only redeamable part of the second disc. Maybe I'm too old now to appreciate it but, some of the features on second disc seem a little lame even for kids to enjoy. I would have been pleased with one disc featuring a commentary and one decent documentary although it probably wouldn't play as well to kids.All in all this is a good movie and the second DVD shouldn't ruin your enjoyment of the movie.

It was so thrilling that I was shocked to discover that I didn't remember half of the dialogue. Emma Watson was such a babe. I can't believe they're replacing her, Rupert Grint, and Daniel Radcliffe for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Now I know how people felt when Sean Connery threw in the towel after he did You Only Live Twice. They should have mentioned that you had to find the Sorcerer's Stone to see the deleted scenes. All of these deleted scenes should have been kept in the movie except for the eggs scene. These scene could have made the movie more faithful. They could have had Harry and Hagrid talking about the dragon thing as they walking to the Leaky Cauldron. This movie definitely stays faithful to the book. It has some dialogue that wasn't in the book but it was worth it. In case you don't know who Warwick Davis is, he played Wicket, the Ewok, in Return of the Jedi, and Wald, one of Anakin's friends, in The Phantom Menace. In case you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm referring to two Star Wars films. Daniel Radcliffe is equally amazing. You can hardly tell he was lipsyncing in some scenes (his voice was changing). I'm almost certain that they shot the scene with the letters flying all over the place last because his voice sounds different. I am so mad that John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick) had an almost cameo role in that movie. I pray that they'll use him in the next movies and I hope that they write some dialogue for him in The Prizoner of Azkaban. I don't think that Richard Harris (Dumbledore) is going to be used for all of the movies. Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall) has become quite famous here in America. She recently finished the movie, Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. I have two final complaints, one minor and one major, and the major one comes first. I can't believe that Harry Potter didn't get a nomination for Best Picture. The actors in the movie didn't get nominated for Best Leading Actor or Actress or Best Featured Actor or Actress.

Rowling herself and remained very true to the original book, but with several changes, artistic interpretation and editing.The story is about an 11 year old boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), who is an orphan being raised by his very unpleasant Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw).  Unknown to Harry, he has magical powers and occasionally (and unknowingly) makes things happen that greatly upset the Dursley's.  However, the Dursley's know that Harry has magical powers because Harry's deceased parents (James and Lily Potter, played briefly by Adrian Rawlins and Geraldine Somerville) were a wizard and a witch.  A very powerful wizard named Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) had left the infant Harry on the Dursley's doorstep following his parents' deaths.  The Dursley's own son, Dudley (Harry Melling), is the same age as Harry and treats Harry very badly.Upon Harry's 11th birthday, he receives a letter: something that has never happened before.  The Dursley's won't let him open the letter and become very upset when they read it, but more letters begin to arrive for Harry.  In spite of Uncle Vernon's efforts, Harry finally gets to read the letter when Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane as the groundskeeper at the Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry) bursts in to personally deliver Harry's letter, which is his invitation to attend Hogwarts.  Harry at first doesn't believe that he is a wizard, but agrees to leave with Hagrid and his life is never the same again.  He learns about muggles, goblins, wizards, witches and magic.  He also gets to meet Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Albus Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), Professor Quirrel (Ian Hart), the unpleasant Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and a host of other wizards, witches, ghosts and other creatures.Watching this film and its sequel based upon the second book (""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"") inspired me to start reading the Harry Potter books.  I was very impressed with the amount of detail in the book that did not make its way into the feature film and understood how much the film deviated from the original story.  One of the biggest differences is the amount of attention given to characters in the book that only had minor roles in the film including Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), the Weasley twins (James & Oliver Phelps) and Dudley Dursley.  Also, a few characters in the book don't appear in the feature film at all.  The other major difference between the story presented in the feature film and the book is changing of when things are said and done, which is understandable considering the length of the film.  (It took me about 8 hours to read the book as compared to watching the film, which is 2.5 hours long.)Memorable scenes in the film include Harry under the Dursley's stairs, Hagrid's arrival at the lighthouse, Diagon Alley, the train station, Harry & Ron meeting Hermione, the boats, Harry's first class with Professor Snape, the Quidditch match, raising the feather, the mirror, the forest, Fluffy, the keys, and the ending scenes.  Overall, I rate ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.",5,"""You're a wizard Harry.""

525752,A2GZTI0EIOCQNZ,B00003CXI0,"M. Hind ""daria_m""","[3, 3]","Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter book series.  I did sincerely hope that the movie would follow the book, because many big screen book adaptators take creative license to visualize their own interpretation.  In other words, they mess it up.  Overall, I was pleased with the first book's giant leap to the big screen, in spite of a few minor discrepancies.First of all, every actor hired to play a part in this movie was perfectly suited for his or her role.  Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter!  If I ever see him on the street, where he will undoubtedly be mobbed by thirteen-year-old girls, I will probably slip up and call him Harry a few times!  I do hope that little guy becomes a big star and not just the next Macaulay Culkin.  He seems like a good kid.As I was saying, now when I read the other novels, I can picture these actors and actresses in my mind.  Bravo to the casting directors for giving accurate visual representations of the characters.  And another bravo to the actors themselves for doing an excellent job all around.The special effects in this film were fantastic, especially in the Quidditch scene.  It is SO much better to see this game played out on the big screen than to read about it in the book.  You can never quite see the action in your head while reading, so this movie pieces that scene together for you.  That is why I call this movie ""a great supplement to the book.""  It fills in gaps where your imagination may not have been so strong.This film is destined to be a kid-movie classic, right alongside films like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.""  Not many kid-movies are for kids anymore ...but this one is relatively safe to show in schools on Movie Day Friday or during recess.  ""Harry Potter"" has brought a little respectability back to the children's films genre.The story is great and magical with some very true-to-life themes about uniqueness, bravery, and friendship.  Yes, there were a few moments that didn't stick to the book, namely Hermione's exclusion from the final challenge, but I couldn't help but feel like the movie at least did the book justice.  I understand that screenwriting is a difficult process that does not allow for everything in a book to be included in the film version.  That's the way it goes.As far as the DVD is concerned, the movie transfer and sound is very excellent, but the special features aren't so special.  I enjoyed the deleted scenes, but I did not enjoy the mess of a maze I had to endure to unlock them.  A word to the wise: find a website that specializes in DVD easter eggs.  Print out the directions to finding the deleted scenes and follow them to save time and frustration.In the meantime, enjoy this first installment in what will prove to be a very profitable franchise.  I know lots of people, myself included, who are DYING to see ""Chamber of Secrets.""

Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are a captivating trio of child actors, and the supporting cast is superb:  Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, the late Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Julie Walters, etc.  While the movie is longish, over two and a half hours, you never lose your interest and it is overall a ""classic"" style of film that should appeal to even those of us who aren't on the Harry Potter bandwagon.

I was never one who really got into Harry Potter, I've only read the first two books, but this movie is fantastic.

His parents dies young, suppossedly in a car crash, when Harry was only a baby. His only living relatives were his stuck up Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, who had been fueding with Harry's parents for years. Naturally, Harry is treated like crap for his entire time there, always playing second banana to his fat, spoiled cousin Dudley. But one day, Harry gets a letter, the first ever in his life. As he is about to open it, his Uncle snatches it away from him, and his face goes white. He immediately tears it to bits. But, over the next week, Harry would get hundreds more of those letters. So many, that Uncle Vernon flips his lid and moves the family out to an island in a hut in the middle of a deserted lake area. But that night, a giant man shows up and breaks into the house. Everyone terrified, his first words were a friendly ""Happy birthday Harry!"" It was Hagrid, caretaker at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

But I cannot do it. While it is certainly, certainly, CERTAINLY no masterpiece of cinema by any means, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" does manage to be entertaining and fun, holding a viewer's attention for its complete two-and-a-half hour run.I credit the entertaining success of ""Harry Potter..."" to the fact that its script is very detailed, engrossing, and polished; not to mention that it gives all the fans of the books what they want by being as loyal as possible to the original text.The film's entertainment also stems from the fact that the cast is a cavalcade of British actors ranging from newcomers (Daniel Radcliffe manages to give a strong performance as the title role) to seasoned actors (such as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and Maggie Smith, who are always joys to watch and are certainly no exception here). The ensemble cast all gives performances that are very well thought out and, more importantly, it looks like everyone in the cast is having spectacular fun bringing the story and characters to life.Yet ""Harry Potter..."" does have its weaknesses, and all these weaknesses are mainly the result of what is obviously a rushed product. It is very apparant in the special effects and some of the blocking and editing, that the film was rushed and not made to the best quality it could have been, in order to get it released during the holiday season. Because of all this, some of the scenery, costumes, and even characters look, sound, and feel phony and unbelievable: And in a movie where the enviroment and the characters that inhabit that enviroment are such an integral part of its charm, that can be a BIG problem.Nevertheless, ""Harry Potter"" does entertain, and I cannot give it the bashing I would have hoped.

Alan Rickman's performance as Snape was on an O+ level as well. And John Willams score for this movie is a treasure to behold. My favorite movie theme music ever!

Not since the decision to cast Tom Cruise in Anne Rice's ""Interview with the Vampire"" had there been so much ""audience"" speculation as to the capability of a movie to match what readers had built up in their minds.But Harry Potter was truly amazing.  Having read all four books myself (and repeatedly, at that) I too had a mind full of imagery associated with the characters and locations in these books.The kids in the movie (Daniel Radcliffe et al) had HUGE expectations to meet.  Not only was this the screen debut for all three, they were playing roles of kids that millions of readers had come to know and love.  Without exception, I think all three lived up to expectations.Next is the scenery.  While some of the actual settings didn't match up to what I had pictured in my mind, the movie is visually stunning and shows a painstaking attention to detail.Detractors may complain that the movie itself didn't compete with what they had envisioned, I enjoyed the differences in what I had pictured and what the director put on film.  With 100 million readers, it would be impossible for any director to satisfy everyone.  I think Chris Columbus did a fine job and produced a film worthy of its literary roots.

When Warner Brothers bought the rights to the famous children's book series, millions waited in utter anticipation for the adaptation of the first book and executives at the studio were just biting at the bit to accept the money of Mr. Potter's legion of loyal fans. But this was far from an easy task for the movie studio. Why? In order to produce a magnificent achievement for the paying customers, the movie must remain true (to an extent) to the books created by J.K. Rowling and the whimsy and fantasy of those tales must remain no matter the cost. For if this does not happen, Warner Brothers executives can kiss those potential profits on sequels good-bye.The story focuses on the adventures of a young boy in England who discovers he is actually a wizard in training and that he is to be taken to a school, far from the world of the muggles (or non-magical folk) that he has grown up with all his life. After losing his parents when he was a baby, Harry Potter now resides with his terrible adopted family that consists of his boorish uncle, his snippy aunt, and spoiled, brutish cousin. But one day, he learns that he has been accepted to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When he arrives in the magic world of wizards and witches, he is overwhelmed to find out that he is one of the most famous sorcerers of all time m due to his confrontation, and evidential defeat of, the evil Lord Voldemort as a baby. But he no sooner puts he foot through the door then the trouble starts, whether it be the up-tight Professor Snape or the spoiled Draco Malfroy. After many strange events around the school, it is up to Harry and his new friends to stop an evil creature from stealing the Sorcerer's Stone which could bring about the re-generation of Lord Valdemort. The story for Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone is done marvelously well but not based on material from the book. When going to see this film, don't go into it basing it on the book. You'll only be left with disappointment.Though most of the performances were played out by young actors and actresses, those performances were done in such a way that they were sophisticated for the age of the performers and therefore surprising. Daniel Radcliffe fits perfectly into the lead role of Harry Potter but the real determining factor will be if Radcliffe can keep that outstanding persona in this role as he matures through the sequels. Overall the performers seem well suited to their roles but that is not fully realized in the beginning. Only over a period of time in the film do the actors feel fully comfortable in their roles. The only disappointment has to be with John Cleese's Sir Nicholas, which was shown as nearly as much as he probably should have been.Overall, the mystical and extraordinary world of Harry Potter is brought to life in a way that many wouldn't have thought possible years ago and, though the film may differ from the book from time to time, even the most hardcore of Potter followers will be happy with this first film adaptation. Not to say it is absolutely perfect, there are some minor things to complain about. The time length, which stood at two hours and thirty minutes, seemed way too long for a feature at younger children. Granted they probably won't care too much since their eyes will be glued to the screen but that can problem based on potty breaks or something to that effect. Another problem deals with the editing of the movie. As an example, the burnt roof of Hogwarts that was not present in one scene was shown in the next with no explanation to what happened. But outside of those small problems, Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone is a delightful treat during the holiday season but not near the same level as Disney/Pixar's Monsters Inc. but a great film none the less.",4,The Moose Hole - Potter Weaves Magic Spell,1075939200,"02 5, 2004",2004,3949,"['much', 'hype', 'anticipation', 'whimsical', 'world', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'finally', 'brought', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'When', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'bought', 'rights', 'famous', 'children', 'book', 'series', 'millions', 'waited', 'utter', 'anticipation', 'adaptation', 'first', 'book', 'executives', 'studio', 'were', 'just', 'biting', 'bit', 'accept', 'money', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'legion', 'loyal', 'fans', 'was', 'far', 'easy', 'task', 'movie', 'studio', 'Why', 'order', 'produce', 'magnificent', 'achievement', 'paying', 'customers', 'movie', 'must', 'remain', 'true', 'extent', 'books', 'created', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'whimsy', 'fantasy', 'tales', 'must', 'remain', 'matter', 'cost', 'not', 'happen', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'executives', 'can', 'kiss', 'potential', 'profits', 'sequels', 'good-bye.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'adventures', 'young', 'boy', 'England', 'who', 'actually', 'wizard', 'training', 'be', 'taken', 'school', 'far', 'world', 'muggles', 'non-magical', 'folk', 'grown', 'up', 'life', 'losing', 'parents', 'when', 'was', 'baby', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'now', 'terrible', 'adopted', 'family', 'boorish', 'uncle', 'snippy', 'aunt', 'spoiled', 'brutish', 'cousin', 'one', 'day', 'been', 'accepted', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardry', 'When', 'magic', 'world', 'wizards', 'witches', 'overwhelmed', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'sorcerers', 'time', 'm', 'due', 'confrontation', 'evidential', 'defeat', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'baby', 'sooner', 'door', 'then', 'trouble', 'be', 'up-tight', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'spoiled', 'Draco', 'Malfroy', 'many', 'strange', 'events', 'school', 'Harry', 'new', 'friends', 'stop', 'evil', 'creature', 'stealing', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'could', 'bring', 'about', 're-generation', 'Lord', 'Valdemort', 'story', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'amp', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'done', 'marvelously', 'well', 'not', 'based', 'material', 'book', 'When', 'going', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'basing', 'book', ""'ll"", 'only', 'be', 'left', 'disappointment.Though', 'most', 'performances', 'were', 'played', 'out', 'young', 'actors', 'actresses', 'performances', 'were', 'done', 'such', 'way', 'were', 'sophisticated', 'age', 'performers', 'therefore', 'surprising', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'perfectly', 'lead', 'role', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'real', 'determining', 'factor', 'will', 'be', 'Radcliffe', 'can', 'keep', 'outstanding', 'persona', 'role', 'sequels', 'performers', 'seem', 'well', 'suited', 'roles', 'not', 'fully', 'realized', 'beginning', 'Only', 'period', 'time', 'film', 'do', 'actors', 'feel', 'fully', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'only', 'disappointment', 'be', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Sir', 'Nicholas', 'was', 'shown', 'as', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been.Overall', 'mystical', 'extraordinary', 'world', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'brought', 'life', 'way', 'many', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'thought', 'possible', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'may', 'differ', 'book', 'time', 'time', 'even', 'most', 'hardcore', 'Potter', 'followers', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'first', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Not', 'say', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'are', 'minor', 'things', 'complain', 'time', 'length', 'stood', 'two', 'hours', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'feature', 'younger', 'children', 'Granted', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'eyes', 'will', 'be', 'glued', 'screen', 'can', 'problem', 'based', 'potty', 'breaks', 'something', 'effect', 'problem', 'editing', 'movie', 'example', 'burnt', 'roof', 'Hogwarts', 'was', 'not', 'present', 'one', 'scene', 'was', 'shown', 'next', 'explanation', 'what', 'happened', 'small', 'problems', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'amp', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'delightful', 'treat', 'holiday', 'season', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'Disney/Pixar', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'great', 'film', 'none', 'less']",N/A

The special effects are amazing, the casting was great and as you probably know the story is very very good.The only drawback to this film is that the kids were so young, and so inexperienced as actors that their performances were very forced at times.  Luckily those who did the casting found actors who could learn quickly and develop great skills so that even by the second movie they had their characters down and really became those characters.  Of course all of the adult casting was great.  Snape is played perfectly by Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris was perfect as Dumbledore.  The only bad thing about the movies was that he passed away before they were complete and the actor they brought in to replace him was just not the same. He played him differently, and did not give the character the same feel as Harris did.All in all, this movie sets up the series well.  It introduces the characters, blends the humor with elements of the dark material that would come in the subsequent films and told the story from the book as well as could have been done.  There are portion of even the first book that had to be cut out, and as the books got longer and longer more would have to be cut.  The Ultimate Edition, while giving an extended version of the movie does not replace much of the material that was cut from the book, just enhances the theatrical version of the film.  The big ticket item on the Ultimate Edition are the extras, specifically the five part documentary series that is the focus of the second disk.  In this set it is Creating the World of Harry Potter.  They talk about finding the cast, filming and how they created Howart's, the Quidditch arena, the various locations used etc.  Not just in the first movie, but throughout the series.  You also get things like the trailers, TV spots, Deleted Scenes, and a bunch of interactive content.If you love the books and want to get the most out of the movies you can than this is a must have for your collection.

525775,A2UL0A8GJB4318,B00003CXI0,mljkb,"[3, 8]","""Harry Potter"" is one of the biggest money making machines in the world.  Later this year we will all be graced with a new book from author J.K. as well as the next cinematic chapter directed by Brit Mike Newell.  And the phenomenon can be traced back to when Rowling published the first book in the series and when helplessly mainstream director Christopher Columbus took the reins for the first movie.  Columbus, best known for the ""Home Alone"" films and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" beat out a slew of other directors to get the job, most likely after Spielberg withdrew his interest.  As a result, the film is artistically hit and miss.  While the film is esquisitely designed, shot and edited, ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" comes up somewhat anemic in compelling dramatics.  In an attempt to please die hard Potter fans, Columbus and writer Steve Kloves (Wonder Boys) try to cram in as much of the book's numerous plot strands and details into the films' overlong 150-minute-plus running time as possible, losing narrative kinetics and often bogging down the film in one forgettable passage after another. They sometimes neglect to focus on the characters that Rowling so cannily imagined and on the themes of the story that made the tale of wizards, witches and a demonic dark lord hit so close to home.With so much lacking in the film, it should have keeled over as one bloated, extravagent mess.  But the film has one saving grace that salvages it and makes it somewhat endearing: dead on casting.  It would be hard to imagine a better cast of unknowns and british film and theater vets to bring the Potter legend to life.  Previously unheard of Daniel Radcilffe gives off earnest charm as you Harry, a young, inexperienced savior of the world who is blissfully unaware of what awiats him later in life.  Emma Watson is delightful as the helplessly brainy Hermione Granger, always her nose in a book.  And Rupert Grint is a riot as the well-meaning but a little bumbling Ron Weasly and puts a true sense of humor into his role.  And the supporting cast, what a roster.  Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and many others look almost too comfortable in their roles as teachers, professors and groundskeepers at the fabled Hogwartz school for witchcraft and wizardry.  They make the complex art of acting seem effortless and Columbus should be thankful.  The execution of the story may be flawed, but the casting is damn near perfect, saving ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" from fan derision.",3,Entertaining Despite Itself,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,2495,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'one', 'biggest', 'money', 'making', 'machines', 'world', 'Later', 'year', 'will', 'be', 'graced', 'new', 'book', 'author', 'J.K.', 'as', 'well', 'next', 'cinematic', 'chapter', 'directed', 'Brit', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'phenomenon', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'back', 'when', 'Rowling', 'published', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'when', 'helplessly', 'mainstream', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Columbus', 'took', 'reins', 'first', 'movie', 'Columbus', 'best', 'known', 'Home', 'Alone', 'films', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'beat', 'out', 'slew', 'other', 'directors', 'get', 'job', 'most', 'likely', 'Spielberg', 'withdrew', 'interest', 'result', 'film', 'artistically', 'hit', 'miss', 'film', 'esquisitely', 'designed', 'shot', 'edited', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'up', 'somewhat', 'anemic', 'compelling', 'dramatics', 'attempt', 'please', 'die', 'hard', 'Potter', 'fans', 'Columbus', 'writer', 'Steve', 'Kloves', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'try', 'cram', 'as', 'much', 'book', 'numerous', 'plot', 'strands', 'details', 'films', 'overlong', '150-minute-plus', 'running', 'time', 'possible', 'losing', 'narrative', 'kinetics', 'often', 'bogging', 'down', 'film', 'one', 'forgettable', 'passage', 'sometimes', 'neglect', 'focus', 'characters', 'Rowling', 'so', 'cannily', 'imagined', 'themes', 'story', 'made', 'tale', 'wizards', 'witches', 'demonic', 'dark', 'lord', 'hit', 'so', 'close', 'home.With', 'so', 'much', 'lacking', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'keeled', 'over', 'one', 'bloated', 'extravagent', 'mess', 'film', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'somewhat', 'endearing', 'dead', 'casting', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'imagine', 'better', 'cast', 'unknowns', 'british', 'film', 'theater', 'vets', 'bring', 'Potter', 'legend', 'life', 'Previously', 'Daniel', 'Radcilffe', 'off', 'earnest', 'charm', 'Harry', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'savior', 'world', 'who', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'what', 'later', 'life', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'delightful', 'helplessly', 'brainy', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'always', 'nose', 'book', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'riot', 'well-meaning', 'little', 'bumbling', 'Ron', 'Weasly', 'true', 'sense', 'humor', 'role', 'supporting', 'cast', 'what', 'roster', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'many', 'others', 'look', 'almost', 'too', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'teachers', 'professors', 'groundskeepers', 'fabled', 'Hogwartz', 'school', 'witchcraft', 'wizardry', 'make', 'complex', 'art', 'acting', 'seem', 'effortless', 'Columbus', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', 'execution', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'flawed', 'casting', 'damn', 'near', 'perfect', 'saving', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'fan', 'derision']",N/A

Though I have yet to read the Harry Potter books, it's my love for fantasies like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and Halloween specials like ""The Worst Witch"" that drew me to this film, and I'm so glad! Harry Potter is the fantastic and fun-filled story of a young boy whose miserable life as an orphan living with cruel relatives is suddenly changed when he finds out he is destined to be the greatest Wizard that ever was! Living in a crawl space under his Aunt and Uncle's staircase in 20th century London, Harry has no idea that his parents were a famous Wizard and Witch, murdered by an evil Wizard when he was just a baby. But one day a mysterious letter comes for Harry, informing him that he is soon to be a student at Hogwart's School of Magic. His aunt and uncle do their best to keep him away, but goodness wins out when the towering, bearded, kindhearted and commanding Hagrid comes to the Human world to save the boy from his coldhearted keepers. Suddenly, Harry finds himself being introduced to a whole new world of magic! Hagrid takes the boy to Diagon Alley, a magical marketplace, to purchase a wand and other school supplies, then on to the train station, to board the Express to Hogwart's School. On the way to his new life, Harry meets up with his two soon-to-be best friends, the friendly and true, if a bit awkward, Ron Weasley, and the cute and clever bookworm Hermione Granger (who steals the movie, thanks to the adorable Emma Watson's performance).From that first view of Diagon Alley onward, Harry takes in one jaw-dropping experience after another. But the greatest sights come when Harry gets off the train and enters the world of Hogwart's School of magic. Boats must be taken to reach the school grounds, and the view is stunning. The school itself is a sight to behold, right out of a fairytale. Within, we find several other children waiting to be sorted into their teams and dorms, from the sneaky Slitherins to the noble Gryffindors. Luckily, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are grouped together on the Gryffindor team. The students meet the teachers, formalities are taken care of, a feast fit for kings is served up, and their new lives begin. From here on out it is one adventure after another, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione battle a Mountain Troll, investigate the evil Voldemort, play a stunning broomstick ballgame called Quidditch, and learn about honor, friendship, bravery, and magic, not to mention the secret of the mysterious Sorcerer`s Stone.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not to be missed. It's good, clean, family fun, with great characters and lots and lots of magic. Some scenes may be a bit frightening for small children, and if you have a hang-up about movies about kids going to witchcraft schools, well, I suggest you just have a talk with your kids about fantasy versus reality, because that's what this is, a fantasy. And what a fantasy! The DVD is wonderful, but I don't claim to have been as blown away by the extras disc as others have. It was okay, but for the most part it seems to have been made for little kids. But the movie is great for any age!

Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 1]","It's a very rare person who hasn't watched a Harry Potter movie or read one of the books (admittedly I know a few of the poor souls who haven't).  And for good reason, the books especially are excellent, and the movies not bad adaptations at all.  Of course I always recommend reading something before watching it, but if the very least you're going to do is watch it, then at least that's something.Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is the first movie in a series of eight.  Obviously you want to watch them in order.  This particular one follows the first book through its entirety.  So you watch as Harry becomes a wizard and joins Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.  But there is a terrible foe out there, one who tried to kill him as a baby.  Voldemort, this evil wizard, may be back again, and there's something very powerful that he's after.Characters:Daniel Radcliffe- Harry PotterRupert Grint- Ron WeasleyEmma Watson - Hermione GrangerRobbie Coltrane - HagridRichard Harris - Albus DumbledoreAlan Rickman - Severus SnapeMaggie Smith - Minerva McGonagallI really don't think the movie could have been cast any better.  Everyone was exactly how I would have envisioned them, or at least close enough that they are what I picture now when I read the books.  Daniel Radcliffe as Harry does an excellent job.  He has the right amount of surprise at magic and an innocence that goes along with not knowing how important he really is.  Ruper Grint as Ron Weasley is funny, and I like how they have a ready quip for him at all times.  Emma Watson, what can I say, she's Hermione through and through and has that right touch of haughtiness.  Of course all the others are excellent, although sometimes I can't quite figure out if Dumbledore acts as he should.  And Professor Quirrell was kind of a surprise as well too.The movie follows the book reasonably well.  It's understood that you're going to be disappointed by some things when you watch, that's just the nature of trying to squeeze the detail of a book into the movies.  But they did ok and I was happy enough with the efforts, although there were some scenes I would have liked to see included (like the dragon scene expanded as it is in the book).  Since this movie is for kids the violence is toned down a little bit.  But there is some there and I could see some elements that may be frightening for younger children.The special effects were brilliant.  They really brought the world to life the best they could with the technology and the care taken is shown.  Even the Chocolate Frogs were amusing and I especially like how they pulled off the wizard pictures.  It made it almost as if you were reading it and picturing all these things in your head.  I would have liked to see more magic done, but I guess they had to put plot in in addition to all the shiny special effects.  Music, what can I say.  I read somewhere once that they get goose bumps when they hear the opening music to Harry Potter.  And I quite agree.  When you hear that music there's just a moment of anticipation, like you know something wonderful is about to happen.  And the rest of the score is just as good and just as magical as you would hope it to be.

Much of what I stated originally is still true but to me, the film series is entertaining. I wouldn't let a small child watch the later films since it would probably scare the heck out of them, but as your kids grow up, though the films become increasingly darker, I think they can handle it and enjoy them. **My biggest concerns revolve around the blatant way witchcraft is flaunted around. This is not like the tales of Narnia (a superior series of books) or even the ""Wizard of Oz"" where magic is part of the story not the predominant aspect. Harry Potter glorifies witchcraft and encourages kids to become involved, going so far as to teach them the basics of Wicca. Wizard of Oz did not ""teach"" witchcraft. The Warner Brothers website for Harry Potter has a link for kids to enroll in the school of wizardry.Harry Potter attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns to cast spells, make potions, use divination and the make up of a witches broom. They also talk to the dead and use sorcery routinely. They are introduced to animal/human sacrifice, drinking blood, Mother Goddess theories, reincarnation, divination, demon possession, Celtic and Druid religions and even Satanism.A child reading the books will learn witchcraft as if they were studying Wicca. The only difference in Harry Potter is that the spells are ""made up"" words in Latin with a humorous touch, but are not real spells. However, the intrigue leads the child to wanting to learn the same things as Harry, which can lead them to learn correct spells on witchcraft websites linked to Harry Potter. If the interest is there and a child gets excited about learning to be ""like Harry"", they will find a way to learn sorcery.This is why those who practice witchcraft and Wicca are so excited about the ""positive"" attention that Harry Potter is bringing to them.There is a prevailing shadow of death that hangs over much of the storytelling. This is not a light happy world, but a landscape clouded by gloom and murder. J.K. Rowling, the author of Harry Potter, herself admitted in a recent interview that ""death and bereavement and what death means, I would say, is one of the central themes in all seven books."" Yeah, and this is what we want kids to see? I don't think so.These are concerns for me as a parent and it should be a concern for anyone afraid that their child could do more than enjoy this film and books as entertainment.** I probably haven't changed enough of this review to satisfy those who gave it negative feedback but hey, what I wrote is factual. Having said that, anytime I get a chance, I watch the films and enjoy the world that Rowling created. **",4,Harry Potter and the spell over kids,1043193600,"01 22, 2003",2003,2864,"['**', 'Please', 'note', 'review', 'modified', 'original', 'negative', 'feedback', 'directed', '****', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'changed', 'opinion', 'film', 'entire', 'film', 'saga', 'Much', 'what', 'stated', 'originally', 'still', 'true', 'film', 'series', 'entertaining', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'small', 'child', 'watch', 'later', 'films', 'would', 'probably', 'scare', 'heck', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'films', 'become', 'increasingly', 'darker', 'think', 'can', 'handle', 'enjoy', '**My', 'biggest', 'concerns', 'revolve', 'blatant', 'way', 'witchcraft', 'flaunted', 'around', 'not', 'tales', 'Narnia', 'superior', 'series', 'books', 'even', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'where', 'magic', 'part', 'story', 'not', 'predominant', 'aspect', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'glorifies', 'witchcraft', 'kids', 'become', 'involved', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'teach', 'basics', 'Wicca', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'did', 'not', 'teach', 'witchcraft', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'website', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'link', 'kids', 'enroll', 'school', 'wizardry.Harry', 'Potter', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardry', 'cast', 'spells', 'make', 'potions', 'use', 'divination', 'make', 'up', 'witches', 'broom', 'also', 'talk', 'dead', 'use', 'sorcery', 'routinely', 'are', 'introduced', 'animal/human', 'sacrifice', 'drinking', 'blood', 'Mother', 'Goddess', 'theories', 'reincarnation', 'divination', 'demon', 'possession', 'Celtic', 'Druid', 'religions', 'even', 'Satanism.A', 'child', 'reading', 'books', 'will', 'learn', 'witchcraft', 'were', 'studying', 'Wicca', 'only', 'difference', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'spells', 'are', 'made', 'up', 'words', 'Latin', 'humorous', 'touch', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'spells', 'However', 'intrigue', 'child', 'wanting', 'learn', 'same', 'things', 'Harry', 'can', 'lead', 'learn', 'correct', 'spells', 'witchcraft', 'websites', 'linked', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'interest', 'there', 'child', 'excited', 'learning', 'be', 'Harry', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'learn', 'sorcery.This', 'why', 'who', 'practice', 'witchcraft', 'Wicca', 'are', 'so', 'excited', 'positive', 'attention', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'bringing', 'prevailing', 'shadow', 'death', 'much', 'storytelling', 'not', 'light', 'happy', 'world', 'landscape', 'clouded', 'gloom', 'murder', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'author', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'admitted', 'recent', 'interview', 'death', 'bereavement', 'what', 'death', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'central', 'themes', 'seven', 'books', 'Yeah', 'what', 'want', 'kids', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.These', 'are', 'concerns', 'parent', 'should', 'be', 'concern', 'anyone', 'afraid', 'child', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'enjoy', 'film', 'books', 'entertainment', '**', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'enough', 'review', 'satisfy', 'who', 'gave', 'negative', 'feedback', 'hey', 'what', 'wrote', 'factual', 'Having', 'said', 'anytime', 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'films', 'enjoy', 'world', 'Rowling', 'created', '**']",N/A

It has everything it needs to be a long-lasting icon of the film industry. And yes, I say the Philosopher's Stone, not that other horrible name, because that is the true name of the book and movie. The alternate name was plastered onto the American edition because... well, I won't go into details of those rumours.Suffice to say, this movie was brilliantly done. Kudoes to Chris Columbus for a magnificent job. It seems he was criticised from a number of different angles (unfairly, in my opinion) for either sticking too closely to the book, or for not including various scenes.One, he couldn't have included everything. It would have been a logistical impossibility. Two, had he strayed from the story given in the book, it would have lost a lot of its magic. Pun not intended.I was a little disappointed at some things being missed. In particular, Hermione's momentary panic when Harry and Ron are caught in the Devil's Snare, and the alterations to the entire 'Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback' saga. But all in all, I think it was a great effort that resulted in the sort of enjoyable movie that you can watch again and again.The stars are all brilliant. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all perfect in their roles. Emma Watson in particular - she has Hermione's mannerisms down pat.As for the adults, they too were all wonderful. Especially, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. And a special mention for Tom Felton - he has really made Draco Malfoy into someone that we can love to hate.The Philosopher's Stone is marvellous enough in its own right without people deriding is as a Lord of the Rings copy (which it isn't), or saying that it is too 'airy-fairy'. And, what is with the accusation by a latter viewer that it (book & movie) is a blatant copy of Star Wars?Okay, there are people who don't like Harry Potter. That's acceptable. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But to start making ludicrous claims is just off the planet. Harry Potter is not a copy of Star Wars, and the Quidditch match is not a copy the Episode 1 Pod Race. Try reading the book again, and then having a look at the copyright date in the front of the book. Then check out the production date for Phantom Menace. Then, grow up and get a life! Sheesh....This is a great movie. It is about friendship and courage, and just happens to be set in the fantastic world of wizards and witches. If you really think this movie is brain-dead, try watching half an hour of Teletubbies, or that insipid...'Blues Clues'. (Anyone who freely uses the phrase 'handy dandy' seriously needs psychiatric help, quickly)At least the stars in Harry Potter can act. Daniel Radcliffe is no Macaulay Culkin (thank God), and he leaves other child actors (ie, Haley Joel Osment) in his dust. Okay, now I'm ranting. But 'The Philosopher's Stone' has far more redeeming features than negative ones, and I find it sad that there are people who - as a wonderful Australian critic stated - feel that they are entitled to trash a movie just because they don't personally like it.

Herum ""Movies Hate You Too""","[2, 2]","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneUltimate Edition Blu-Ray ReviewYear: 2001Rating: PGRuntime:  2 HRS 32 MIN (Theatrical), 2 HRS 39 MIN (Extended)Directed by: Chris ColumbusStarring:  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan RickmanFilm Rating:  3 out of 5 starsVideo Rating:  3 out of 5Audio Rating:  4 out of 5Extras:  4 out of 5Overall Rating:  4 out of 5 starsThe FilmHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a film I absolutely despised upon its release in November 2001.  At the time, I was a complete Harry Potter virgin and didn't know a ""muggle"" from a ""bezoar"" and I wasn't patient enough to give the film a chance.  It wasn't for several more years until I could sit down and actually enjoy this opening entry into one of the more magical (pun intended, stop rolling your eyes) franchises in recent memory.HP1 tells the story of a neglected 10 year old orphan with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead who is raised by his cruel aunt and uncle and finds out of his 11th birthday that he is in fact a wizard.  He travels to a distant magical school named Hogwarts where he meets new friends (and enemies), learns about how he received that lightning scar, what happened to his parents, and runs across an old foe in a new form.This film is extremely loyal to the book which is both a blessing and a curse.  Sorcerer's Stone is the shortest entry in the book series and that allows for a more literal adaptation when you have 150+ minutes to tell your story in the theater.  Unfortunately, the film doesn't take many risks when it comes to differentiating itself from the book.  Many fans appreciate how dedicated this film is to it's book but I think for the sake of pacing some liberties should have been taken.HP1's biggest problems come in the form of direction, acting, and effects:-Sorcerer's Stone is directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) who is obviously very good at working with child actors but I've always felt that he is a little out of his element working on a film of this scale.  HP1 looks as though it could have been directed by anyone, it's competently directed but there's nothing to set it apart style wise.-Kid actors always seem to cause problems.  For every film with good child actor performances (think The Goonies) there's a movie filled Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker, Star Wars Episode I) level actors. Sorcerer's Stone falls somewhere in the middle when it comes to the children's performances.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Rupert Grint (Ron) come off a lot better than Tom Felton (Draco) and especially Emma Watson (Hermione).  What's funny is, Emma Watson has put in some of the best performances in the later film entries so kudos to her for putting in the effort to become a much better actress.-CGI has come along way since 2001.  There are far too many scenes in HP1 where the effects have not aged well or just weren't that good in the first place.  The Quidditch match in particular is a scene that I remember rolling my eyes at when I first saw the film and it continues to take me out the film years later.There are a lot of good things working in favor of HP1.  Set direction, practical effects, sound design, and the soundtrack are among the many things in this film that are top notch.  The adult actors such as Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Robbie Coltrane add a lot credibility to the film and usually seem to elevate the children's performances while in their presence.  The last thing you have to keep in mind when judging this film is the often forgotten fact that this is the setup film of a huge franchise.  Sorcerer's Stone had the near impossible task of introducing the characters and wizarding world to the movie going audience.  While I didn't appreciate this film upon my first viewing I've grown to enjoy it more now that I've seen and read what comes after.The Blu-RayHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray comes housed in a  sturdy blue cardboard case with slip cover.  Inside you'll find the movie blu-ray with both the theatrical and the extended cut of the film, a special features BD, a standard-def DVD of special features, a theatrical cut digital copy disc, a collectible book, two character cards (Harry Potter & Minerva McGonagall)As stated above, this set features both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film.  The extended cut runs approximately 7 minutes longer than the original cut.  Most of the extra footage are scene extensions and most novice Harry Potter fans won't notice any difference between the two.  Both cuts of the film appear to be mastered from the same source print which is identical to the transfer used for the 2007 HD-DVD and Blu-Ray editions of the film.  While the transfer is very good, it's not likely to blow anyone away but it is accurate to the designed look of the film.  I no longer own the SD DVD version of the film to compare this release to but I believe it would be safe to say this BD outclasses it in every conceivable way.  Black levels are very good, I didn't notice any crushing even in the darkest scenes.  Color accuracy was consistent and the level of detail is usually on par with what I've come to expect from Blu-Ray with only a few scenes appearing overly soft.  I didn't notice any use of Digital Noise Reduction since there is always an appropriate level of film grain visible during the film.Regarding the audio tracks, there several differences between the this and previously released editions but I doubt that most listeners will hear the difference.  Unlike the aforementioned HD-DVD and Blu-ray releases, which featured a Dolby TrueHD and an Uncompressed 5.1 PCM  track respectively, this release features a DTS-HD Master Audio 6.1 track for the theatrical cut and a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 for the extended cut.  The added channel for the theatrical cut most likely stems from the fact that when released in theaters this film was released in Dolby Digital Surround EX which is a 7 channel format.  Since the extended cut of the film adds back segments of the film that were never encoded in that format that cut of the film feature a 5.1 audio mix.Extras on this set range from wonderful to ""I couldn't care less.""  I typically don't watch extras that aren't presented in HD so only extras presented in high definition will be included in this review.  The only significant extra on disc one is the PiP (Picture in Picture) commentary track from director Chris Columbus.  The track is sporadic at best with Columbus popping up more frequently the farther a long into the film we go.  He's interesting to listen to and seems to have fond memories of working on the film but there are long  gaps without his input that hinders this from being a must watch for anyone but the most die hard HP fans.  Since disc one's only special feature is the PiP track disc two houses the rest.  First off is a brief introduction by Daniel Radcliffe which is both amusing and a little creepy.  He makes it clear in no uncertain terms that you'll absolutely love the Ultimate Edition Blu-Rays and you'll learn things about Harry Potter that you never knew.  The best special feature included on the set (and for some the entire reason they bought the set) is the Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 1:  The Magic Begins documentary.  This is part one of the eight part series with a new installment being included on each new Ultimate Edition set.  The Magic Begins is presented in HD and looks as though great care and effort has been put into the documentary.  Each documentary is themed and as the title leads you to believe this segment dives into the launching the franchise.  Most of the interviews with cast and crew are newly produced and everyone is very candid about what led to certain decisions being made, what works and doesn't work, and how it those decisions affected future films.  It's an interesting look back at the beginning of the franchise especially now that we're so close to the release of The Deathly Hallows Part 2.  Other extras include 10 minutes worth of deleted scenes.  Most of these scenes are what make up the Extended Cut of the film so your not going to see any hidden treasures if you already watched that version of the film.  The only other extras on disc two are the teaser trailer, two full trailers, and 15 television spots all presented in standard definition (SD trailers, etc. are inexcusable in this day and age).  Disc three extras are all presented in SD and are recycled from previous editions of the film so I didn't even bother wasting the time to put the disc in my player.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a faithful adaption of the inaugural Potter book.  A number of issues, namely the children's performances, the bland direction, and some spotty CGI hinder the film from being truly magical.  It does however setup the world of Harry Potter effectively, tells the story competently, and looking back, makes enough good decisions to help future Potter films succeed in ways this film could never achieve.Highly Recommended for any Potter fan with money to burn.  If you're unsure if Harry Potter is right for you I suggest checking out the single disc Blu-ray, it will only cost you around $10 so your financial risk is a lot smaller.  The disc sports the same transfer, similar audio, it doesn't include The Magic Begins doc, or the extended cut of the film but if you're looking for the cheapest HP1 option this is it.",4,Harry Potter

525814,A3E0MSKBIWMU6F,B00003CXI0,obryanstars,"[4, 6]","I LOVE the Harry Potter series, there is almost NO book(s) like it.  I have already pre-ordered #5, and am crazy about the series.  When I heard that a Harry Potter movie was being made, I was, in a funny yet true word, HYSTERICAL!  I was so excited (I was 13 at the time).  Well, a year later, I went and saw the movie, and while it was a good movie no doubt, parts of it were just...stretched?  Heres what I thought of HP and the Sorcerer's Stone.1) Plot: This movie follows (DUH!) the record selling book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling.  This movie, as promised, is FAITHFUL to the book.  And if thats all you were looking for, seeing the book for the most part brought to life page by page in a movie, then this movie was PERFECT for you!  I even enjoyed the movie because it was so faithful.  But while nearly every scene, literally, in the book made its way on to this film, a lot of it had NO insperation whatsoever.  For example, when they were in a lot of the classes, it showed maybe 30 seconds.  A charm being completed, a potion being made.  Why not have a bit of the class actually shown, like Proffeser McGonagall reading text from her book, or perhaps even all of the STUDYING for the exams, or being assigned homework and projects.  They literally skip from scene to scene to scene, and while I did enjoy going &quot;Oh yea, I remember when Snape said that&quot; or a few seconds later &quot;that was one of my favorite parts of the book&quot;, it gets dull after while, and NO scene really seems to grab you.In Lord of the Rings, they stayed in one spot or situation for at least 5-10 minutes (one reason it was such a GREAT movie), but in this, thats counsidered a LONG scene, and you never really get in to it.  Another problem I had was a lot of things I thought were important still WERE missing.  For example, the EXAMS in my mind were a HUGE part of the year, cut out.  The Elders Mirror or whatever, they spent 15 minutes on.  I think that could have been trimmed down to perhaps 5-7 minutes.Quidditch games?  Only one game shown, about 5 minutes.  Daily classes?  They only go to each class once for the most part, and they don't even go to every class.  They tried to cram so much into this movie, it became almost too little EVERYWHERE!  They cut out the visits to Hagrid except for 1 or 2.  And you really don't get to know the characters.  Everything seems to happen AROUND Harry, never to him.  He almost NEVER gets hurt, he never gets in fights with Malfoy (ANOTHER big part).  Except for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, almost no one did more than a few minutes of acting.  But for everything they did put into this movie, and I know I sound criticle, they DID do an excellent job and created in many's hearts, a classic to the book.What they DID do well was the last 30 minutes or so, the tasks, Voldemort showing up, the Forbidden Forest, etc...  These last few scenes set the drama, and for a movie aimed at kids, this one was GREAT.  But for the teenagers and adults, this film lacked some things.  Still a good movie and worthy of your owning (I DID buy it on DVD), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was done very well, and I would reccomend it!2) Graphics: Very well done.  Everything in Hogwarts is put together FANTASTICLY!  The castle, classes, robes, wands, spells, Quidditch matches (EXCELLENT), the unicorns, etc...  The one part I think they didn't do well on was when Harry grabbed the bad teacher (can't say who...not a spoiler) and his head feel apart.  Could have been done a LOT better, but I guess they had the kids in mind.  Everything looks convincing, and while it's no Lord of the Rings, it was done EXTREMELY well, 4 stars!3) Acting: This is where the movie struggled if it did.  Harry Potter (played by Daniel Radcliffe) did a very good job for the most part, but in certain areas, ex. when Ron was nearly killed, Harry (without even looking at him) asks offhanded &quot;You okay?&quot;  &quot;Yea!&quot; gasps Ron.  Harry never even looks at him!  Little things like this popped up every 15 minutes or so, but as these are young actors and should without a doubt get better, they did a pretty good performance.As for the teachers and Hagrid, etc..., acting was done EXTREMELY well.  Within a few years, I'm sure this cast of Hogwarts will improve dramaticly, and while it may not sound like it, the acting was well done.4) Overall: This was a good movie.  The acting was good at most parts, the graphics were above par.  The plot, while sometimes un-inspired or strechted, follows a book that won countless awards.  Everything here is wrapped up into a pretty good package.  There are little things here and there that I didn't like, and I think this could have been trimmed (ex. The Mirror) to about 2 hours, or added more important events.  But overall, this is a good movie, and in my book, worthy of a purchase.  While this isn't going to ever win an Oscar, its loyal to the book, is a great movie for kids and a good movie for adults, and even though parts were kind of choppy, this is a great movie, and being the first of an epic adventure, I expect this is just the beggining of the great moments of Cinema still to come in the series.3.5 Stars / 10Thx!",3,"A Good Movie, But Something Was

For me, the picture did seem to be missing something--it didn't really grab me as much as I thought it would; seemed to be a bit lacking in emotional depth.  I didn't get the sense of how desperately unhappy Harry was to be living with his relatives, and what a relief it was for him to get the invitation to Hogwarts.  I'm not sure that's the fault of Daniel Radcliffe, though, since the film skipped over the first part of the book pretty rapidly... One section of the film that really DID work for me, emotionally, were the couple of scenes dealing with the Mirror of Erised--very nicely done, and rather touching.Other plusses... The casting was very good, I thought.  I really liked both Ron and Hermione.  The Quidditch match was great--doesn't that look like fun?!  And Hogwarts was splendid, both inside and out.  How could I possibly resist all that mediaeval architecture?  Great to look at--and nearly all the interiors were shot at actual locations, in rooms hundreds of years old, not sets.  The music was very fitting as well--I'm not a big John Williams fan, but the main theme for this film was just perfect.So, after seeing the picture several times my complaints have subsided--I do enjoy it!  It does lose a bit on the small screen--seeing it on the big screen, in six-channel sound,  is of course much more impressive than watching it on television.  (For instance, in several scenes if you looked closely you could always seen the figures in the paintings on the walls moving slightly--it's hard to notice that on the small screen.  And when the flying keys crashed into the closed door, they made a very deep THUD that you felt in your chest--you got a sense of how dangerous they were.  Lots of little details like that are lost on tv...)Now, as far as the DVD presentation of the film itself goes, boy, what a DUD.  I honestly don't know what the people at Warners were thinking when they put this thing together.  There is almost no supplemental material at all--there was so much that could have been included, but wasn't.  No director's commentary, no in-depth behind the scenes material, no out-takes, no interviews with the child actors, NOTHING.  Disc two is almost entirely a sort of ... game/puzzle combination.  You have to do all sorts of tasks in the proper order to get to the stone and your reward, which is seven brief deleted scenes.  I don't know what age this is aimed at--certainly not adults, and not many kids either, I would think.  And the thing is, there is no way to get to those scenes directly through the menu--you have to go through the entire thing every time you want to see them.  Just stupidity...However, there is a shortcut which others have mentioned.  I couldn't do this on my particular DVD player that is hooked up to the television, but it did work when I put the disc in the computer.  Bring up the track listings, and click on track 80.  Wait just a moment for the scene to change--when the row of bottles appears, click on the round one.  And that will take you to the deleted scenes.A few of the scenes are interesting enough--problem is, there aren't many of them.  For instance, I know that there was some material shot with the Weasley family at the train station, but none of that was here.  What I would really have liked to see was a longer cut of the film, about three hours in length, with an intermission added.  That would have been perfect for viewing over two evenings, for those people who are pretty busy.  (I'm thinking of myself--by the time I finish working at about eleven every night, I'm too tired to watch a two and a half hour movie in one sitting anyway!)  The rough cut of this picture ran a whopping FOUR HOURS--there was plenty of material to work with, to put together a longer version.  So, I'm rather annoyed that the film wasn't lengthened, though perhaps someday another version will be available.  Still, I'm very glad I bought the disc to be able to view the film, or certain scenes, whenever I'm in the mood to do so.",5,"Great Movie, lousy DVD",1024099200,"06 15, 2002",2002,4151,"['Well', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'made', 'up', 'minds', 'movie', 'loved', 'hated', 'few', 'more', 'thoughts', 'here', 'picture', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'grab', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'would', 'seemed', 'be', 'bit', 'lacking', 'emotional', 'depth', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'desperately', 'unhappy', 'Harry', 'was', 'be', 'living', 'relatives', 'what', 'relief', 'was', 'get', 'invitation', 'Hogwarts', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'fault', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'though', 'film', 'skipped', 'first', 'part', 'book', 'pretty', 'rapidly', 'One', 'section', 'film', 'really', 'DID', 'work', 'emotionally', 'were', 'couple', 'scenes', 'dealing', 'Mirror', 'Erised', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'rather', 'touching.Other', 'plusses', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'thought', 'really', 'liked', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'Quidditch', 'match', 'was', 'great', ""n't"", 'that', 'look', 'fun', 'Hogwarts', 'was', 'splendid', 'inside', 'out', 'How', 'could', 'possibly', 'resist', 'mediaeval', 'architecture', 'Great', 'look', 'nearly', 'interiors', 'were', 'shot', 'actual', 'locations', 'rooms', 'hundreds', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'sets', 'music', 'was', 'very', 'fitting', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'John', 'Williams', 'fan', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'perfect.So', 'seeing', 'picture', 'several', 'times', 'complaints', 'have', 'subsided', 'do', 'enjoy', 'lose', 'bit', 'small', 'screen', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'six-channel', 'sound', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'watching', 'television', 'instance', 'several', 'scenes', 'looked', 'closely', 'could', 'always', 'seen', 'figures', 'paintings', 'walls', 'moving', 'slightly', 'hard', 'notice', 'small', 'screen', 'when', 'flying', 'keys', 'crashed', 'closed', 'door', 'made', 'very', 'deep', 'THUD', 'felt', 'chest', 'got', 'sense', 'how', 'dangerous', 'were', 'Lots', 'little', 'details', 'are', 'lost', 'tv', 'Now', 'as', 'far', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'film', 'boy', 'what', 'DUD', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'people', 'Warners', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'put', 'thing', 'together', 'almost', 'supplemental', 'material', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'was', ""n't"", 'director', 'commentary', 'in-depth', 'scenes', 'material', 'out-takes', 'interviews', 'child', 'actors', 'NOTHING', 'Disc', 'two', 'almost', 'entirely', 'sort', 'game/puzzle', 'combination', 'have', 'do', 'sorts', 'tasks', 'proper', 'order', 'get', 'stone', 'reward', 'seven', 'brief', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'age', 'aimed', 'certainly', 'not', 'adults', 'not', 'many', 'kids', 'would', 'think', 'thing', 'way', 'get', 'scenes', 'directly', 'menu', 'have', 'go', 'entire', 'thing', 'time', 'want', 'see', 'Just', 'stupidity', 'However', 'shortcut', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'particular', 'DVD', 'player', 'hooked', 'up', 'television', 'did', 'work', 'when', 'put', 'disc', 'computer', 'Bring', 'up', 'track', 'listings', 'click', 'track', '80', 'Wait', 'just', 'moment', 'scene', 'change', 'when', 'row', 'bottles', 'click', 'round', 'one', 'will', 'take', 'deleted', 'scenes.A', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'problem', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'instance', 'know', 'was', 'material', 'shot', 'Weasley', 'family', 'train', 'station', 'none', 'was', 'here', 'What', 'would', 'really', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'was', 'longer', 'cut', 'film', 'three', 'hours', 'length', 'intermission', 'added', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'viewing', 'over', 'two', 'evenings', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'pretty', 'busy', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'time', 'finish', 'working', 'about', 'eleven', 'night', ""'m"", 'too', 'tired', 'watch', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'one', 'sitting', 'anyway', 'rough', 'cut', 'picture', 'ran', 'whopping', 'FOUR', 'HOURS', 'was', 'plenty', 'material', 'work', 'put', 'together', 'longer', 'version', 'So', ""'m"", 'rather', 'annoyed', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'lengthened', 'perhaps', 'someday', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'Still', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'bought', 'disc', 'be', 'able', 'view', 'film', 'certain', 'scenes', 'whenever', ""'m"", 'mood', 'do', 'so']",N/A

If you have then you know the entire plot of this movie-- if you haven't-- here's a brief synopsis:  A young boy named Harry Potter is an orphan and lives with his only family-- his horrible Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley.  His life with these people is awful-- they treat him like a ""dog that rolled in something smelly"" (to quote the novel) and make him sleep in the cupboard under the stairs.  One day Harry receives a mysterious letter but his Uncle snatches it away and destroys it before Harry can read it.  Soon, more and more letters come and Uncle Vernon starts to go mad-- he uproots the family to get away from the thousands of letters addressed to Harry.The next night a giant man barges in on the family and delivers a letter to Harry (one of the same that plagued Uncle Vernon)-- it's his acceptance letter to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Harry is a wizard!  The rest of the story involves Harry's first year of learning magic, making friends, playing Quidditch (like soccer on broomsticks) and finding out more and more about his past and his parents-- apparently he's famous in the world of magic!Ok, it's a great story and the novels have captured the imaginations of children and adults alike.  The Harry Potter books are a phenomenon and the movie has been greatly anticipated.  Fans will not be displeased with the film when it comes to the story line-- director Chris Columbus stayed true to the book in most respects (many small details are left out and some events have been altered just a little in order to help move the plot along better).  The film was two and a half hours long, if all the little details had been left in the film, who knows how much longer it would have been.Now, the only thing that might disappoint those who are hard to please (like me) are the special effects.  The movie is about wizardry and magic, yet there are only a few scenes in which anything magical happens.  It would have been nice to see more magical things, especially in the class rooms (hardly any scenes about that at all-- which really disappointed me).  The special effects that were there, some were fine, some were good, and others were laughable.  Ever see ""The Mummy Returns""?  Remember the end with the Scorpion King animation?  Some of the animations were that bad....but not all of them.So, do I recommend this film?  Sure.  It was fun and it's a good story-- obviously, or else the book wouldn't have been a hit in the first place.  It is a little long...2 1/2 hours will do a number on your rear, make sure you've got a comfy chair!  If you haven't read the books and you enjoy films in the genre of fantasy then you will like Harry Potter.  If you did read the books, you'll be happy that nothing important was left out and nothing was bastardized-- (think ""Circle of Friends"").  You'll enjoy it I'm sure....I'm not sure if you'll love it....but you'll enjoy it.  I dunno, maybe I should watch it again....maybe I'll end up loving it.  But right now, when someone asks me I say ""Ehhhh...it was good I guess"".

Rowling's mega-bestseller receives an excellent film treatment from director Chris Columbus, although the film falls just shy of true masterpiece status.You'd have to have lived in a cave in Afghnistan not to know the plot: Harry Potter lives a miserable existence in the cupboard under the staircase at the home of his Aunt and Uncle Dursley, and their spoiled rotten son Dudley.  But just as Harry turns 11, he is accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and his hidden heritage as a wizard is revealed, a heritage of fame throughout the world witches and wizards, a heritage with powerful enemies and unexpected dangers.Columbus does an outstanding job of re-creating Rowling's world onto the screen.  Daniel Radcliffe is excellent as Harry, and the supporting cast is stellar, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Richard Harris as Hogwarts' Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as the sinister Professor Snape.However, the movie's greatest flaw comes from its overly faithful adherence to the book.  Out of sheer necessity, some scenes have been cut, but the movie sticks to the book like glue.  This provides a limiting factor, as books and films are different media, following different rules.  For instance, Peter Jackson made sensible changes on &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, by not being as slavish to that book, resulting in an improved film.Ironically, one of biggest bones to pick with this film is the elimination of a scene near the end of the film, where Hermione is denied a scene of physical courage that was in the book.Still, the widescreen version is a classic, with a wonderful score by John Williams.  The DVD features are interesting, although a bit lacking, and are nothing special.  It's also a pain to have to unlock the deleted scenes which are contained on the second disc.But, to paraphrase The Bard, &quot;The film's the thing.&quot;  And this is a film no family should be without.",5,A Magical Movie Despite a Few Flaws,1023580800,"06 9, 2002",2002,2019,"['J.K.', 'Rowling', 'mega-bestseller', 'excellent', 'film', 'treatment', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'film', 'just', 'shy', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'status.You', ""'d"", 'have', 'have', 'lived', 'cave', 'Afghnistan', 'not', 'know', 'plot', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'miserable', 'existence', 'cupboard', 'staircase', 'home', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'Dursley', 'spoiled', 'rotten', 'son', 'Dudley', 'just', 'Harry', '11', 'accepted', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardry', 'hidden', 'heritage', 'wizard', 'revealed', 'heritage', 'fame', 'world', 'witches', 'wizards', 'heritage', 'powerful', 'enemies', 'unexpected', 'dangers.Columbus', 'outstanding', 'job', 're-creating', 'Rowling', 'world', 'screen', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'excellent', 'Harry', 'supporting', 'cast', 'stellar', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Hagrid', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Hogwarts', 'Headmaster', 'Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Nearly', 'Headless', 'Nick', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Professor', 'McGonagall', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'sinister', 'Professor', 'Snape.However', 'movie', 'greatest', 'flaw', 'overly', 'faithful', 'adherence', 'book', 'sheer', 'necessity', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'movie', 'book', 'glue', 'limiting', 'factor', 'books', 'films', 'are', 'different', 'media', 'following', 'different', 'rules', 'instance', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'made', 'sensible', 'changes', 'quot', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'quot', 'not', 'being', 'slavish', 'book', 'resulting', 'improved', 'film.Ironically', 'one', 'biggest', 'bones', 'pick', 'film', 'elimination', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'Hermione', 'denied', 'scene', 'physical', 'courage', 'was', 'book.Still', 'widescreen', 'version', 'classic', 'wonderful', 'score', 'John', 'Williams', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'interesting', 'bit', 'lacking', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'also', 'pain', 'have', 'unlock', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'contained', 'second', 'disc.But', 'paraphrase', 'Bard', 'quot', 'film', 'thing.', 'quot', 'film', 'family', 'should', 'be']",N/A

It captivates the audience with the magic and dreams of a young boy (Harry Potter) finally learning who he really is -- and discovering that he is something special.As is generally the nature of the film business, sequels never quite match up to the pilot film. This is not to say that ""Chamber"", ""Prisoner"" and ""Goblet"" were not good movies; they were. This is simply better.The story takes us on a tour of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft -- as unlikely place as any in the realm of fiction -- and introduces us to some delightful characters. The sanguine master, Professor Dumbledore; loyal and gentle giant, Hagrid; sinister and sulking, Professor Snape; and of course the main characters, Harry, Hermione and Ronald Wesley.Harry is singled out almost immediately as exceptional and develops a continuing advisary in the guise of Draco Malfoy. Draco represents everything Harry is not. He comes from a wealthy, well-known family; has influence, is arrogant and is sure of himself. In the sequels we come to know him a bit better (and dislike him even more) but even in the first film, he reminds us of the kid in school we always hated (envied?).The imagination runs wild as Harry and his new friends discover many delightful objects and puzzle over situations. The mirror that shows one's innermost desires, a trek thru the dark forest to look for unicorns, fluffy the three-headed dog, wizard's chess, and the mystery of the sorcerer's stone itself.The music score well fits the scenes depicted and tends to be on the light side. Characters are well played and believable (within the realm of the story at least). And the ending - if not a surprise - is at least not a letdown. One finishes the film smacking his lips in anticipation of the next release.This is a movie to be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. Adults will marvel at the special effects and probably remember their own childhood experiences in school. Kids will delight to the characters and the many devices throughout the film. The action is mild enough that even the youngest of children can watch without parents having to worry about language or violence.Want a good evening's entertainment with the family in front of the television.

Great, another overwrought kids book full of silly names, and bratty child heroes. But, when my roomie came home with the DVD, my curiosity got the best of me and in the dark of night I smuggled the disk up to my room and into my player.And was instantly hooked! On it's own, I found the film to have just the right mix of humor, warmth, and yes...magic. The heroes aren't bratty at all, but loveable, with just the right touch of vulnerability to make you care for them. Even the female lead, who all too often in these sorts of films is either bratty, or in need of rescuing every five minutes, manages to hold her own with the boys.The special effects are fine, and the cast of seasoned actors seems to be quite enjoying themselves. The script is quite charming, with all the great touches of british wit that make their fantasy stories seem so charming. I haven't had this much fun since my younger days of watching Doctor Who.  Add to that the youthful enthusiasm of Speilburgs early films and you have quite the winning combination.Like most everyone else though, I have to take one star off for the DVD itself. I certainly have no problem with a disk full of games and the like to keep the kids entertained, but I had hoped that there'd be a bit more meat on the disk for us serious movie fans. More deleted scenes, a proper commentary, that sort of thing. I can only hope that at some point, WB will grace us with a Special Edition set for us older viewers.I'm not sure I'm ready to join the long line of rugrats haunting the Waldenbooks to buy the books.

After the almost magical success of the Harry Potter books, it would be MORE surprising if a movie DIDN'T make a smash! JK Rowling, a fabulous author, deserves the successful recognition of a movie version-- it is only a shame that in these days, a movie is almost expected. I personally would have preferred to let the books remain legends in themselves.This movie was quite wonderful, nonetheless. First of all, we had really wonderful British actors and actresses. From those we already knew would be brilliant (Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman), to the pleasant surprises (Daniel Radcliffe and especially Rupert Grint), the cast was awfully strong. The recreation of the atmosphere invoked by Rowling in her books is to be thoroughly applauded. The touches and nuances of color, texture and feel were absolutely perfect. The sound (especially the phenomenal musical score) deserves praise. Daniel Radcliffe delivered a rather sensitive portrayal of the newest brand of hero: The timid, &quot;who me?!&quot;, real-life, youthful chap who is raised to nobility despite himself and to much humble surprise. (Frodo in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and Peter Parker in &quot;Spiderman&quot; are two other surprise-hero roles)A couple gripes: Special effects looked like they were headed out to be flawless, until we got the icky video-gamey ogre and the dissapointing revelation of Lord Voldemort's face. Also: Emma Watson wasn't exactly ON. I hate critiquing actors because sometimes they are perfect in one role and just miss it in another, occasionally it isn't their fault. I just found Emma's Hermione more annoyingly one-demensional than Rowling's Hermione. She played up the confidence without tempering it with Hermione's slight insecurities. It's just a thought.Also, despite all my praise, I realize that without the fabulous book series, this movie could never stand on it's own. This sounds obvious-- I mean, if the books hadn't been written, the movie wouldn't have been a concept, let alone a reality. But let me explain: This movie just doesn't mean as much unless you already loved the books. It isn't a great piece of film in itself. It is loyal to the text and faithful to Rowling's descriptions. Unfortunately, the best books-turned-movies were not exact replicas, but affectionate homages. The movies reflected the book without exactly copying it.Of course, I am no director, and deeply admire anyone who can take such a literary success and even attempt to create a theatrical success as well. I realize that I am probably in the minority with my criticisms, and there is much to like about this movie. Worth seeing, but NOT instead of the books. My advice? Read the books instead.

Rowling alive is an excellent cast and superbly designed set and props. Without any major changes or exclusions, fans of the books along with those un-read in the adventures of Harry Potter should enjoy this flick. The celluloid world authentically feels like the words Rowling wrote. Daniel Radcliffe is great as Potter, and the young actors playing Ron and Hermione are equally as astonishing. But it's the late Richard Harris who is most notable, perfectly cast as Dumbledore the headmaster. The wisdom in his eyes reflects the genius of the head wizard.The one flaw this film has, however, is its straightforward adaptation. With hardly any changes made from the book, the film seems too rushed and crowded with characters and events. When adapting from a book, the movie should take scenes and characters that work in the transfer to the different medium, and change events or scenes that don't work. That which works in a book, doesn't necessarily work in a movie. Comparing this to Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, which came out at the same time and is another fantasy adaptation, it's easy to see that Potter wasn't quite as successful in the adaptation process as that movie, which knew what it had to change and delete in order to make it work on the big screen.But despite that problem, this film still works as a whole.

For one thing, it's terribly overwraught; the supreme clumsiness and obviousness with which the writer tries to manipulate our emotions is totally laughable. In fact, I can't believe that even children fall for it. Not to mention the fact that there is no room for humanity is any of the &quot;villains&quot;. None of them are shown to have any redeeming features at all; they are so one dimensional that they might as well be cardboard cutouts with &quot;bad guy&quot; stencilled across their foreheads. Nor is there ever any opportunity for them to be forgiven or to be allowed to make amends. The show very much promotes an &quot;us and them&quot; attitude among the heroes. Even when one of the bad guys offers to make up he is rejected by Harry. This brings me to the actor who plays Harry, Daniel Radcliffe, the worst child actor I've ever seen in my life. I could forgive him his lousy acting if only his expressions were a bit more human. The kid has all the facial complexity of an old Japanese cartoon character. He has two expressions: utter delight and joy when awful things happen to people he doesn't like, and a vengeful scowl until these things do happen.Also, the show promotes kids lying and stealing to get what they want (the end oh-so justifies the means); it encourages cliquiness and a ruthlessness towards opponents (win at all costs!). This is certainly nothing new, and neither is the advocation of disrespect and disobedience towards authority, but it grates just the same.As for the film production, it's pretty good, though not spectacular. The sets are contextually predictable and the special effects are average. Everyone but the star does a fairly good job of acting; there are a bunch of cameos by more established actors, though most of the scenes feature Harry and his two friends.All in all, I'd not recommend this movie to anyone.",1,Sorcerer's Stone is Rock Bottom,1052092800,"05 5, 2003",2003,2046,"['know', 'enormously', 'popular', 'series', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'quite', 'hard', 'like', 'read', 'books', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'copious', 'shortcomings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'one', 'thing', 'terribly', 'overwraught', 'supreme', 'clumsiness', 'obviousness', 'writer', 'manipulate', 'emotions', 'totally', 'laughable', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'even', 'children', 'fall', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'room', 'humanity', 'quot', 'quot', 'None', 'are', 'shown', 'have', 'redeeming', 'features', 'are', 'so', 'one', 'dimensional', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'quot', 'bad', 'guy', 'quot', 'stencilled', 'foreheads', 'there', 'ever', 'opportunity', 'be', 'forgiven', 'be', 'allowed', 'make', 'amends', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'promotes', 'quot', 'quot', 'attitude', 'heroes', 'Even', 'when', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'make', 'up', 'rejected', 'Harry', 'actor', 'who', 'Harry', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'worst', 'child', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'could', 'forgive', 'lousy', 'acting', 'only', 'expressions', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'human', 'kid', 'facial', 'complexity', 'old', 'Japanese', 'cartoon', 'character', 'two', 'expressions', 'utter', 'delight', 'joy', 'when', 'awful', 'things', 'happen', 'people', ""n't"", 'like', 'vengeful', 'scowl', 'things', 'do', 'happen.Also', 'show', 'kids', 'lying', 'stealing', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'end', 'oh-so', 'means', 'cliquiness', 'ruthlessness', 'opponents', 'win', 'costs', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'new', 'advocation', 'disrespect', 'disobedience', 'towards', 'authority', 'just', 'same.As', 'film', 'production', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'spectacular', 'sets', 'are', 'contextually', 'predictable', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'average', 'Everyone', 'star', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'are', 'bunch', 'cameos', 'more', 'established', 'actors', 'most', 'scenes', 'feature', 'Harry', 'two', 'friends.All', ""'d"", 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone']",N/A

525848,A39W3263A9HCMN,B00003CXI0,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[1, 1]","Since the novel's 1997 release, the buzz about a film adaptation of Philosopher's Stone was abounds. It wasn't until 2001 when Potterheads' dreams came true, and the book's film adaptation came out, sending fans to the cinemas in droves. Since the film's release and foretold box office success, the series has gone on to have the whole book series adapted, including the most successful adaptation, the newest one, Deathly Hallows Part 2. Since all the movies are out, I figured it would be nice to let my inner Potterhead put the nostalgia to the test.Let me start off by that Harry Potter has played a big part in my life. I've been a fan since 1999, when my aunt sent me the first book for Christmas. I had no idea what Harry Potter was at the time, and furthermore, the book was my first big read, so as you could imagine, opening the pages and reading the first few sentences, I was immediately hooked. Every time a book came out, I was frantic to get it. I saw every movie on their respective opening day, and own every movie on DVD, and recently rebought them on blu-ray.As of a recent rewatching, this movie, I will say, is a solid adaptation that, at the time, was considered the ""Watchmen"" of fantasy novels, in the fact that it was unfilmable. For the most part, Columbus did a solid job with the source material. However, if one thing holds the movie back, it seems as if he was trying too hard to make it perfect. I think anyone who hasn't read the book will be lost on what's happening, as a result. Dint get me wrong, this movie is indeed very good in terms of being a solid adaptation. I think, however, Columbus could have done a better job at making it a bit more cinematic.The acting, for a mostly kid anchored cast, is excellent. Daniel Radcliffe was a little kid back when this was going on, nobody thought he'd go on to be the little actor who stole audiences hearts worldwide. He really did a fantastic job with the role. He essentially leaped from the pages of the book, he's that good. The supporting cast do as good a job as said Radcliffe. Rupert Grint was probably the cutest member of the cast! He was just charming and quirky as the dimwitted but ever so funny Ron. Emma Watson was extremely cute as Hermione, and man, her performance is almost like she really is Hermione in real life! Let's not forget to mention Tom Felton who apparently didn't read the book, yet excelled as Draco, and Matthew Lewis as the naive but charming Neville Lonottom. Speaking of which, it's worth it to mention how he's grown up so much. I'm not gay, but seriously, LOOK AT MATTHEW LEWIS NOW. He is GORGEOUS. Honestly, I'm not gay at all, but it's so hard to believe he went from being a pudgy kid to an extremely handsome grown adult. In fact, the entire cast have grown up so much, it's unbelievable.In addition, the cinematography in the film is brilliant. From the films gorgeous opening shots of Privet Drive to the vibrant colour of Hogwarts, this is one of the most visually gorgeous shots ever.While watching the blu-ray, one word rang through the back of my head, ""soft"". The image quality is simply not what it could have been. Mind you, this was shot on a considerably lower budget than the rest of the lot. And this is the best looking the movie will be. Some shots looked fantastic, others looked like Sharon Osbourne did the transfer. Also, either it's just me or there was a major adjust in F-stop in the Quidditch scene. The Audio is a nice mix, though, as there is a lot of oomph in John Williams' score, as well as the sound effects simply sound more epic. The special features, though, are exactly the same as the DVD. You'd think they'd have brought some more features in for the blu-ray, but come on.In short, apparently at the time, in 2007 WB didn't screen this blu ray for blu ray review sites. It's not hard to see why. As for the movie, it's a good start, but there was a lot more to come. Still, a must see nonetheless.MOVIE: 3.5/5VIDEO: 3/5AUDIO: 5/5EXTRAS: 2/5OVERALL:4/5PROS: Soightly above par video and excellent audio to be found in this blu-ray release,CONS:  Video is not as good as it could be, plus the lack of extras is disappointing.",4,Philosopher's Stone Blu ray review,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,4184,"['novel', '1997', 'release', 'buzz', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'was', 'abounds', 'was', ""n't"", '2001', 'when', 'Potterheads', 'dreams', 'came', 'true', 'book', 'film', 'adaptation', 'came', 'out', 'sending', 'fans', 'cinemas', 'droves', 'film', 'release', 'foretold', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'series', 'gone', 'have', 'whole', 'book', 'series', 'adapted', 'including', 'most', 'successful', 'adaptation', 'newest', 'one', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '2', 'movies', 'are', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'let', 'inner', 'Potterhead', 'put', 'nostalgia', 'test.Let', 'start', 'off', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'played', 'big', 'part', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', '1999', 'when', 'aunt', 'sent', 'first', 'book', 'Christmas', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'was', 'time', 'furthermore', 'book', 'was', 'first', 'big', 'read', 'so', 'could', 'imagine', 'opening', 'pages', 'reading', 'first', 'few', 'sentences', 'was', 'immediately', 'hooked', 'time', 'book', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'frantic', 'get', 'saw', 'movie', 'respective', 'opening', 'day', 'own', 'movie', 'DVD', 'recently', 'rebought', 'blu-ray.As', 'recent', 'rewatching', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'solid', 'adaptation', 'time', 'was', 'considered', 'Watchmen', 'fantasy', 'novels', 'fact', 'was', 'unfilmable', 'most', 'part', 'Columbus', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'source', 'material', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'back', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'perfect', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'what', 'happening', 'result', 'Dint', 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'indeed', 'very', 'good', 'terms', 'being', 'solid', 'adaptation', 'think', 'however', 'Columbus', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'making', 'bit', 'more', 'cinematic.The', 'acting', 'mostly', 'kid', 'anchored', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'nobody', 'thought', ""'d"", 'go', 'be', 'little', 'actor', 'who', 'stole', 'audiences', 'hearts', 'worldwide', 'really', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'role', 'essentially', 'leaped', 'pages', 'book', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'said', 'Radcliffe', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'was', 'probably', 'cutest', 'member', 'cast', 'was', 'just', 'charming', 'quirky', 'dimwitted', 'ever', 'so', 'funny', 'Ron', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'was', 'extremely', 'cute', 'Hermione', 'man', 'performance', 'almost', 'really', 'Hermione', 'real', 'life', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'mention', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'who', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'yet', 'excelled', 'Draco', 'Matthew', 'Lewis', 'naive', 'charming', 'Neville', 'Lonottom', 'Speaking', 'worth', 'mention', 'how', 'grown', 'up', 'so', 'much', ""'m"", 'not', 'gay', 'seriously', 'LOOK', 'AT', 'MATTHEW', 'LEWIS', 'NOW', 'GORGEOUS', 'Honestly', ""'m"", 'not', 'gay', 'so', 'hard', 'believe', 'went', 'being', 'pudgy', 'kid', 'extremely', 'handsome', 'grown', 'adult', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'unbelievable.In', 'addition', 'cinematography', 'film', 'brilliant', 'films', 'gorgeous', 'opening', 'shots', 'Privet', 'Drive', 'vibrant', 'colour', 'Hogwarts', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'shots', 'watching', 'blu-ray', 'one', 'word', 'rang', 'back', 'head', 'soft', 'image', 'quality', 'simply', 'not', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Mind', 'was', 'shot', 'considerably', 'lower', 'budget', 'rest', 'lot', 'best', 'looking', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'shots', 'looked', 'fantastic', 'others', 'looked', 'Sharon', 'Osbourne', 'did', 'transfer', 'Also', 'just', 'was', 'major', 'adjust', 'F-stop', 'Quidditch', 'scene', 'Audio', 'nice', 'mix', 'though', 'lot', 'oomph', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'as', 'well', 'sound', 'effects', 'simply', 'sound', 'more', 'epic', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'brought', 'more', 'features', 'blu-ray', 'come', 'on.In', 'short', 'apparently', 'time', '2007', 'WB', 'did', ""n't"", 'screen', 'blu', 'ray', 'blu', 'ray', 'review', 'sites', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'good', 'start', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'come', 'Still', 'must', 'see', 'nonetheless.MOVIE', '3.5/5VIDEO', '3/5AUDIO', '5/5EXTRAS', '2/5OVERALL:4/5PROS', 'Soightly', 'par', 'video', 'excellent', 'audio', 'be', 'found', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'CONS', 'Video', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'lack', 'extras', 'disappointing']",N/A

I was nearby the movie theater entrance when I heard a voice say ""The Harry Potter movies first showing is starting now""  than I saw a mob of elementary school kids rampaging their way to the theater and I was in their way.  After the dvd came out I decided to buy it just to see what the excitement was all about and I was astonished at how much I enjoyed the movie.  After that I decided to but the first book and have since gotten the entire seven books of Harry Potter as well as the five movies that have so far been made.

The audio choices are also amazing with the next four blu-ray dvds meaning the languages you can select are massive.  You also get a bit more with the extras but if you're like me you probably never really check them out.  So as the prices for these great blu-rays have gone down in price I say either get the entire collection set or just buy the first one and see if you like the movie.

So far, of all of the blu-ray discs I have watched in high definition on our 1080p HD TV, these new ""Ultimate Editions"" of the Harry Potter films, have impressed me the most.I am *NOT* an audio/video expert.  However, I can say that the films look crisp and sharp, to me.  We are playing the discs on a Playstation 3 using an HDMI connection to our Sony Bravia Z-Series 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV.  The sound is quite nice as well.  We don't have a full digital audio setup, but we do have a limited 2.1 sound system attached to our setup, and the sound seems to be better on the blu-ray discs, than the DVDs.  But that may just be a placebo affect.I was worried that because the films we made quite a while before blu-ray came out, or before it was super-common to film all digitally, and in high definition, that what we would end up with would be an upscaled version of the DVD footage, showing heavy grain and looking blurry.  I can say that it doesn't look like that at all.  It looks fantastic.  Like the actors are right there in the room with you.  Additionally, the blu-ray disc contains both the theatrical release, and the new extended version with cut scenes put back in.  A *LOT* of scenes make more sense with those scenes back in.  It helps if you have read the books, but if you haven't, then those extra scenes make the movies make more sense.As for the extras, the booklet is nice, and has some interesting photos (and very little in the way of words or explanations to explain them).  The case is fantastic, and high quality (the interior case which is the big box right inside the slipcover is the same kind of pseudo-leather the LOTR extended versions use, AND it has a nifty magnetic clasp to hold itself shut!).  The over-sized trading cards are ridiculous and clearly a gimmick (but they are well made).  The DVD copy has all of the old special features from previous releases.  However, if you are a super-fan of the books and movies, it will be the blu-ray special features disc that you buy this set for.  Specifically, for the hour long documentary included in each ultimate edition containing all of the behind-the-scenes stuff I have been wanting to see for such a long time now!  They also do in depth interviews, and show stuff we have never seen before, like the actors screen tests, and their green-screening techniques.I loved the set, I loved the price, I loved the quality of the films in HD, and I loved the extras.  5 stars, all the way!",5,Fantastic!,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,2590,"['just', 'got', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'holding', 'out', 'so', 'long', 'So', 'naturally', 'am', 'blu-ray', 'buying', 'spree', 'So', 'far', 'blu-ray', 'discs', 'have', 'watched', 'high', 'definition', '1080p', 'HD', 'TV', 'new', 'Ultimate', 'Editions', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'have', 'impressed', 'most.I', 'am', 'audio/video', 'expert', 'However', 'can', 'say', 'films', 'look', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'are', 'playing', 'discs', 'Playstation', '3', 'using', 'HDMI', 'connection', 'Sony', 'Bravia', 'Z-Series', '46-Inch', '1080p', '120Hz', 'LCD', 'HDTV', 'sound', 'quite', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'full', 'digital', 'audio', 'setup', 'do', 'have', 'limited', '2.1', 'sound', 'system', 'attached', 'setup', 'sound', 'be', 'better', 'blu-ray', 'discs', 'DVDs', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'placebo', 'affect.I', 'was', 'worried', 'films', 'made', 'quite', 'while', 'blu-ray', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'super-common', 'film', 'digitally', 'high', 'definition', 'what', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'upscaled', 'version', 'DVD', 'footage', 'showing', 'heavy', 'grain', 'looking', 'blurry', 'can', 'say', ""n't"", 'look', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'room', 'Additionally', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'theatrical', 'release', 'new', 'extended', 'version', 'cut', 'scenes', 'put', 'back', '*LOT*', 'scenes', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'scenes', 'back', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'have', ""n't"", 'then', 'extra', 'scenes', 'make', 'movies', 'make', 'more', 'sense.As', 'extras', 'booklet', 'nice', 'interesting', 'photos', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'words', 'explanations', 'explain', 'case', 'fantastic', 'high', 'quality', 'interior', 'case', 'big', 'box', 'right', 'slipcover', 'same', 'kind', 'pseudo-leather', 'LOTR', 'extended', 'versions', 'use', 'nifty', 'magnetic', 'clasp', 'hold', 'shut', 'over-sized', 'trading', 'cards', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'clearly', 'gimmick', 'are', 'well', 'made', 'DVD', 'copy', 'old', 'special', 'features', 'previous', 'releases', 'However', 'are', 'super-fan', 'books', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'blu-ray', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'buy', 'set', 'Specifically', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'included', 'ultimate', 'edition', 'containing', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'such', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'also', 'do', 'depth', 'interviews', 'show', 'stuff', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'actors', 'screen', 'tests', 'green-screening', 'techniques.I', 'loved', 'set', 'loved', 'price', 'loved', 'quality', 'films', 'HD', 'loved', 'extras', '5', 'stars', 'way']",N/A
525857,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00003CXI0,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 1]","With J.K. Rowling becoming the richest author in the world, it seemed almost inevitable that her books should become movies. Though everyone went to the theatres with a healthy dose of trepidation, most came out satisfied, feeling that Rowling's story and vision had been successfully transferred onto the big screen. This is not too surprising as Rowling herself was a major participant in the making of the movie.For those people who have been living under a rock these past few years, here is the general story - orphaned Harry Potter is taken to live with his aunt, uncle and cousin where he grows with no knowledge of his magical past. He lives a rather miserable life under his family's tyranny, till his eleventh birthday when he recieves a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. So off he goes, to find his independance and freedom, a host of friends, kindly teachers who become parental figures, and of course an education in the magic arts. But there is a secret plot within the school concerning the Philosopher's Stone - one of the staff is planning to steal for his master - Lord Voldemort, the evil wizard who killed his parents, and only Harry, Ron and Hermione can stop them.The real strength of this movie lies in the transition of Rowling's imagination and her host of characters, places and creatures to 'real life'. The detail of the sets, the merticulous costumes, the superb casting choices, and the special effects make this movie a visual feast for the eyes. A big highlight was seeing the Quidditch match - it was inevitably more exciting visually than any written account of it. Although in some scenes you could tell the actor where obviously CGI or strung up against a blue screen, the pace and action eliminates this minor gripe.Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Ian Hart as Quirrel are great, but standing out even more so is Robbie Coltrane as the gentle giant Hagrid and Alan Rickman as the cold, arrogant Snape, who still comes across as one of the good guys despite his loathing of Harry.I felt that perhaps the friendships between Harry, Ron and Hermione was not properly created as I picked up no real warmth or affection between them. Though Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all fine young actors and presented the personalities of their characters they functioned more as three separate beings than the team linked by friendship that Rowling creates in her books.On the whole, though this is a *very* enjoyable and re-watchable movie, it is presented more as an accomplice to the book, only being able to be fully appreciated to those familiar to the books, who are able to fill in the blanks that the movie leaves out. Therefore, I urge others to read the books before watching the movie, as it cannot even begin to convey the intricate layering that Rowling creates in her book that reflect on future books in the series (for example the plot twist concerning Scabbers in book three). Though purists will hate me, I felt perhaps film-makers should have been given a bit more extra freedom to work with the material instead of being so restricted to the book. To do so would have made the movie feel like it had beginning, middle and end, with character development, plot growth and a climax, instead of a series of events where one can almost see the separate chapters of the book.",4,A Great Transition from Book to Film,1024876800,"06 24, 2002",2002,3383,"['J.K.', 'Rowling', 'becoming', 'richest', 'author', 'world', 'seemed', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'books', 'should', 'become', 'movies', 'everyone', 'went', 'theatres', 'healthy', 'dose', 'trepidation', 'most', 'came', 'out', 'satisfied', 'feeling', 'Rowling', 'story', 'vision', 'had', 'been', 'successfully', 'transferred', 'big', 'screen', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'Rowling', 'was', 'major', 'participant', 'making', 'movie.For', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'few', 'years', 'here', 'general', 'story', 'orphaned', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'taken', 'live', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'cousin', 'where', 'knowledge', 'magical', 'past', 'rather', 'miserable', 'life', 'family', 'tyranny', 'till', 'eleventh', 'birthday', 'when', 'letter', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardry', 'So', 'find', 'independance', 'freedom', 'host', 'friends', 'kindly', 'teachers', 'who', 'become', 'parental', 'figures', 'course', 'education', 'magic', 'arts', 'secret', 'plot', 'school', 'concerning', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'one', 'staff', 'planning', 'steal', 'master', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'evil', 'wizard', 'who', 'killed', 'parents', 'only', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'can', 'stop', 'them.The', 'real', 'strength', 'movie', 'transition', 'Rowling', 'imagination', 'host', 'characters', 'places', 'creatures', ""'real"", 'life', 'detail', 'sets', 'merticulous', 'costumes', 'superb', 'casting', 'choices', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'movie', 'visual', 'feast', 'eyes', 'big', 'highlight', 'was', 'seeing', 'Quidditch', 'match', 'was', 'inevitably', 'more', 'exciting', 'visually', 'written', 'account', 'scenes', 'could', 'tell', 'actor', 'where', 'obviously', 'CGI', 'strung', 'up', 'blue', 'screen', 'pace', 'action', 'minor', 'gripe.Richard', 'Harris', 'Dumbledore', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'McGonagall', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'Quirrel', 'are', 'great', 'standing', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'gentle', 'giant', 'Hagrid', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'cold', 'arrogant', 'Snape', 'who', 'still', 'one', 'good', 'guys', 'loathing', 'Harry.I', 'felt', 'perhaps', 'friendships', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'was', 'not', 'properly', 'created', 'picked', 'up', 'real', 'warmth', 'affection', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'are', 'fine', 'young', 'actors', 'presented', 'personalities', 'characters', 'functioned', 'more', 'three', 'separate', 'beings', 'team', 'linked', 'friendship', 'Rowling', 'creates', 'books.On', 'whole', '*very*', 'enjoyable', 're-watchable', 'movie', 'presented', 'more', 'accomplice', 'book', 'only', 'being', 'able', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'familiar', 'books', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'fill', 'blanks', 'movie', 'out', 'Therefore', 'urge', 'others', 'read', 'books', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'begin', 'convey', 'intricate', 'layering', 'Rowling', 'creates', 'book', 'reflect', 'future', 'books', 'series', 'example', 'plot', 'twist', 'concerning', 'Scabbers', 'book', 'three', 'purists', 'will', 'hate', 'felt', 'perhaps', 'film-makers', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'bit', 'more', 'extra', 'freedom', 'work', 'material', 'instead', 'being', 'so', 'restricted', 'book', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'feel', 'had', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'growth', 'climax', 'instead', 'series', 'events', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'separate', 'chapters', 'book']",N/A

Mostly because I didn't understand the hype or the craze that was Harry Potter, I thought it was just another stupid fad, like Pokemon or something.  When I heard about the film, I almost went nuts, because I thought this was getting out of control.  But then, I watched the interviews with the cast, and I thought to myself 'Hmmm, maybe I should give this film a chance, and check it out.'  Being that I had never read the books, I went into this film completely fresh, without any expectations whatsoever.  And boy I was NOT disappointed at all with this film.

525865,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXI0,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","I must admit right up front that I have never read the J.K. Rowling novel on which ""Harry Potter: The Sorcerer's Stone"" is based.  As a result, I come to the movie ""cold"" as it were, being neither a full-fledged aficionado nor an inveterate denigrator of this phenomenally popular book series that, in the past few years, has taken the literary world by storm.  Thus, I will not be able to say to what degree Chris Columbus' handsomely designed film adaptation does or does not do justice to its source.  All I can say is how the film struck someone like myself who comes to the material fresh and without expectations of any kind. Well, the verdict, I must say, is a decidedly mixed one, so please allow me to elaborate.Let me state, at the outset, that the movie starts off splendidly.  We are introduced to the infant Harry Potter as he is mysteriously dropped off one night at the home of his maternal aunt and uncle in suburban England.  We quickly move ahead in time to find Harry, now aged 11, living a sort of male Cinderella existence, mistreated and overlooked by both his surrogate parents and Harry's precocious, spoiled brat cousin, appropriately named Dudley.  In the early stretches, the film does a superb job subtly injecting the excitement of magic into a real world setting.  There is also quite a bit of wry humor as Harry begins to slowly awaken to the fact that he has these strange and inexplicable powers to manipulate the elements of his world to his own advantage.  The film retains its spirit of fun as Harry, led by the mysterious but lovably burly Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid, journeys to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the tools of the trade towards which his eccentric destiny is leading him (his parents were also witches, killed by the evil wizard, Voldemort, who obviously has designs on Potter himself).  The preparations for Harry's enrollment in school (i.e. purchasing a magic wand) and the attempt to find his way to this magic hidden land are executed with fine, deft strokes, and Columbus keeps the movie blithely bouncing along at just the right momentum and speed.  Harry's introduction to the school itself is well done as well, as he meets an assortment of colorful characters (both faculty members and schoolmates) and boggles at the amusement park-like atmosphere he finds there, with an imaginative surprise seemingly lurking around ever corner.Yet not too long after we hit the school, something seems to go out of ""Harry Potter.""  Perhaps the anticipation raised by the first half of the film leads us to expect too much, but, if the truth be told, the storytellers don't seem to have thought much about what to do with Harry once they get him to his destination.  Though we like Potter's two chums, Ron and Hermione, and a number of the faculty members, the adventures Harry ends up encountering while at the school seem rather tame, bland and ordinary when you get right down to it.  The monsters the writers have dreamed up for him to conquer aren't particularly interesting or intriguing and the plotting itself lacks excitement and suspense.  In fact, structurally, the film seems more like a series of elaborate set pieces designed more to show off the special effects than to provide a unified narrative that builds and grows to a cumulative impact.  Even worse is that much of the ribald humor of the earlier part disappears as well.  Had more of that dry British wit we are treated to in the initial stages been carried all the way through the film, ""Harry Potter"" might not have come across as quite so flat and attenuated as it does.On the positive side, Daniel Radcliffe gives a superb performance as Harry, capturing the innate goodness, wide-eyed innocence, and no-nonsense practicality of the character he's been called upon to play.  He makes of Harry a very real, very recognizable and very likable young boy.  Radcliffe is more than matched in performance by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione, Harry's two finely drawn companions in adventure.  It's a pleasure, too, to see the wonderful Maggie Smith doing her Miss Jean Brodie bit again after all these years.  No one can convey the brittle starchiness of the English schoolmarm better than she.""Harry Potter"" is also a beautiful looking film, thanks to outstanding cinematography, production design and art direction.So there you have it:  as I said earlier, a decidedly mixed bag of virtues and drawbacks.  Those already enamored of little Harry Potter will probably balk at my carping.  Those already driven mad by Potter-mania may think I am too indulgent in my overall assessment.  But for one who feels little personal stake in the Harry Potter deification/demonization battle, I must say that this is a pretty good film that, I suspect, could have been much better.",3,starts well

Somehow surviving the assault as a baby, marked by a jagged scar, Harry is raised by his hateful cousins (they keep him in a special room under the steps; Harry's portly cousin Dudley makes sure to come down the steps like an elephant) until that day when his parents' alma mater, Hogwarts Academy of Witchcraft, decides to accept him into their freshman class.  Knowing nothing of his parents or witchcraft, or of the way that preturnaturally magical people live alongside the rest of us non-magical types (or ""muggles""), Harry is happily surprised to learn the truth.  Though set in modern-day UK, Hogwarts and the Witches Quarter resemble a cross between England in its Dickensian and Edwardian eras, complete with a winding street that looks like the one used in the ""Muppets Christmas Carol"" (Hogwarts itself seems like a send-up of the old English schools like those made famous in ""Tom Brown's School Days"").  Introduced to this new world by a gentle if dim Giant named Hagrid (Robby Coltrane, made to resemble a friendly grizzly in size and texture), Harry takes to his new existence and quickly maps out his challenges both mundane and epic - making friends with other student wizards, amassing points for his ""house"" (Hogwarts students are divided into dorms), contending with a snotty, bullying student named Draco (another nod to Tom Brown), and looking into the suspicious workings of the academy's potions professor (Alan Rickman) who appears undoubtedly in league with Voldemort.This was a fun film, but somewhat long and loose - too content to be an event movie than a closely plotted one.  It was fun watching all of those kid actors navigate a world full of more recognizable adult stars (Maggie Smith resurrecting the heavy Scottish accent she used in ""Jean Brodie""; Richard Harris as the school's dean; Alan Rickman who probably doesn't appear enough for plotting reasons; and Michael Caine as...wait, Michael Caine wasn't in this movie!  What happened to Michael Caine?)  While the special effects are great and all the players do a great job, the movie on the whole holds very few surprises.  The moral of the story is that love and friendship are the strongest forms of magic (there's hope for us muggles yet!), but the relationships are undertreated in the script (climaxed in a sort of deadly game of wizrard's chess played by Harry and his friends; in another instance, Ronald makes fun of fellow Griffendor-Wicth Hermione.  Though she's hurt, she spends much of the time being about the most frigid 12 year older you can imagine, never explaining how Ron's comment caused so much damage, or why she's so cold).  Still, despite its foibles, a fun movie and an event movie that outdoes the latest Star Wars flicks.

525873,A2RHBT46LS6DA3,B00003CXI0,"Ryk E. Spoor ""Author, Gamer, Geek God""","[2, 3]","First, the bad. Then the good.When the DVD was announced, much was made in the advertisements of the Extra Scenes Not Seen in the Theater. This is of course one of the Cool Things (TM) about DVDs, they often have neat additional material. So my son and I were eagerly looking forward to seeing this. I hoped at first that some extra would be added to the movie itself, but it appears not. No problem, says I, we'll just go to the extras menu and go to the deleted scenes.There is no such selection.In fact, there is no selection which would TAKE you to such a selection.The extra material is there, of course. But to get to it you need to play through what amounts to an incredibly lame short semi-RPG game of puzzles and so on. And since the DVD can't remember such things, you have to play through this stupid sequence of actions *EVERY* *SINGLE* *TIME* you want to view the footage, unless you tape them to a VHS -- which, of course, removes a lot of the utility of a DVD.Take those responsible for the marketing out in the back, and shoot them. This is quite probably the most boneheaded design decision I've ever seen in corporate America, and that's saying quite a bit. One whole star off the rating for this moronic design flaw.Now, as to the movie itself...Most adaptations of books to the movies or television depart from their source material; sometimes it's a matter of a few liberties, but in many cases it's more a matter of systematic abuse and torture, often leaving the viewer wondering what the heck the point was of using the title if you weren't intending on filming the story CONNECTED with that title.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, however, hews very close indeed to the book from which it's derived; not surprising, since J.K. Rowling was given an unprecedented amount of control over the entire project. The major changes are cuts and compressions, something which is inevitable; even a relatively short book contains more material than can be put onscreen even in a long movie.Unfortunately, this does slightly damage the story. The original novel is a rather interesting fusion of three subgenres: the English Boarding-School adventure, the ""child with mysterious background/powers"" story[related to the Cinderella trope], and a classic mystery novel.The movie severely damages the mystery-novel aspect of the story, eliminating or downplaying important clues and rushing us along in the final solution. Reading the book permitted a clever reader to figure out what was going on before it was all revealed at the end of the book -- it was a ""fair"" mystery, one that did give you the chance to solve the problem without hiding crucial information. The movie, unfortunately, does leave out or severely understate some important clues. It also severely compresses several sequences, most notably Harry's time with his ""evil step-family"" the Dursleys.However, the rest of the book is kept virtually intact, with much of the dialogue taken verbatim and the scenes precisely as described. The casting ranges from ""good"" to ""inspired""; I can't think of a single bad casting choice, and all the acting (which in a production with this many child actors is a major concern) is at worst workmanlike and at best is excellent. Alan Rickman as Snape and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid put in stellar performances, making the book characters spring to life perfectly.The edits -- especially the compression mentioned earlier and removal of the fiendish logic puzzle that protected the way to the Sorcerer's Stone -- do, in the end, rob this movie of its potential for perfection, but it remains an excellent, fun, and wonder-filled diversion, perfect for any age.",3,Movie GOOD!

I was a bit skeptical about seeing this film because I thought that the movie would be done poorly and that I wouldn't end up liking it. I ended up enjoying a lot. Chris Colombus stayed right with the book and didn't change a thing. Never have I seen a director that was making a film out of a book keep the film so real to the original novel. Colombus had some skill to do this movie with such beauty.The actors chosen for this film were great. I had imagined every character from Harry himself to Hermione all the way to Albus Dumbledore. Each of the actors did such a great job that I am sadenned to see that this film was not nominated for many Academy Awards. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were adroable and no other kids could have done as good as a job as they did. The castle chosen as Hogwarts was great and presented the witchcraft and wizardry school very well.This movie serves the book very well and most Harry Potter fans will be very pleased with this.

How could anyone say that those such as Robbie Coltrane's acting was flat? He, not including looking the stature and gruffness of Hagrid to a tea, was the best portrayal that they could have possibly found for the role. Really-who else can copy Rubeus Hagrid's accent to such a caliber?!...The kids, Daniel Radcliffe,Rupert Grint and Tom Felton were excellent for their roles-especially Ron, who was played to the at most perfection-he even looked how I imagined him!! Emma Watson is a little too pretty to be Hermione (I always imagined her much plainer,) but she plays Hermione's cleverness and frank scoffs with flair.And lets not forget the actors who portrayed Percy Weasley (who was very business-like and only lacking his Horn-rimmed glasses) The Weasley Twins Fred and George, (both very convincing, though most of their very very funny lines were sadly cut out) and Oliver Wood (who besides being very cute, has a nice Scottish accent that adds to his personality. Great Quidditch captain!!)Second of all: The special effects were awesome-especially the Quidditch match, played, AT LAST, before your very eyes in full-fledged velocity!! I was thrilled to the tips of my fingers, and found that to be spelled out spectacularly in stunning visual effects. Fluffy, though clearly a computer generated three headed dog, was nice and vicious-big teeth and lots of slobber on Ron's shoulder added to his personality.Third of all: They kept all crucial elements in the movie that made the book what it is!! What did they take out, may I ask? They added all of the characters, their great acting and great specail effects, along with keeping all of the best parts and leaving the message that warmed our hearts in the book in the movie. ""It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to our enemies-but even more to stand up to our friends...""...At least I know what this movie is-a spectacular,enchanting, (even though not perfect, but honestly movies can never be as good as books) adaptation to a classic that will live on forever in our hearts and minds! Harry Potter-THE BOY WHO LIVED!!oh yes, and P.S.-Ian Hart did an amazing job as Quirrell-I thought he deserved more credit than he got for his wonderful portrayal.

I won't go into a diatribe about ""New Age"" or Witchcraft influences... quite frankly, they are everywhere and I don't want to beat a dead horse... but aside from those concerns, a parent should be concerned with the trend in all child-targeted films (including this one) of making authority non-existent.Harry Potter has been orphaned and growing up with hateful, loathesome relatives. Too many kids in our society live  in blended families or other situations in which there is favoritism and/or verbal and/or emotional abuse.Harry is ""rescued"" from his life as the unwanted child by being whisked away to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Parents are not present, nor do they visit. The children at this school live in dorms on campus and there are several ""forbidden"" rooms that contain monsters or booby-traps and all children are informed that a visit to the library will result in certain death.  That school is one scary joint! But the attitude of the film is ""let's have fun"" and ""there are no consequences for disobeying authority"" and ""if you don't like the ways things are going, cast a spell.""We live in a very selfish society... and the story subtly gives the message that adults are only good for instruction in some areas, but can otherwise be ignored and not listened to.Yes, it's ""just a movie,"" but in a world where kids are kidnapped from their own bedrooms and terrorists are looming around the corner, kids tend escape further and further into fantasy and have less and less interest or desire for reality.In a nutshell, if you're going to buy this movie for your kids, then you need to watch the film with them and talk to them about it and ask them questions about what they thought about it. Any movie, including this one, should not be used as a babysitter or as a substitute for exhibiting family values instead of just espousing them.As for myself (an adult) and for my parents (in their 60s), we found the film to be entertaining, humorous, clever and a good way to escape... but we all agreed that we never needed to see it again. Some films (like Star Wars) can be seen over and over again... this is not one of those films... at least not for adults.

525894,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B00003CXI0,Simon,"[1, 1]","Harry Potter was one of the big event movies of 2001, and its massive box office and popularity showed the world that kids do still read books ""on occasion"". For the uninitiated, Harry Potter is the story of a boy who discovers he is the heir to a proud tradition of magic, and travels to Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry. The movie is a very faithful adaptation of the novel, and also showed the world that directors can successfully adapt novels and remain faithful to the source.Perhaps though, Harry Potter is a little too faithful. The movie tells the story competently, but does not add anything new or insightful. Basically, what you see is what you get, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Either way, however, I feel the movie did not justify it's long running time. While I'll admit I can't offer any suggestions offhand of where the movie might be trimmed, I do believe that a slimmer, more compact screenplay could've been written. Perhaps if the film had an exciting climax I might have forgiven this, but it doesn't. I can only imagine how annoyed those who didn't read the novels felt after two and a half hours when the movie ended rather anti-climatically. All in all, Harry Potter is still a very good movie. I wouldn't call it the next ""Wizard of Oz"" (like the DVD's packaging does), but it definitely has potential to make a very good franchise.Speaking of the packaging, this is where Warner Bros. really dropped the snitch. For those not in the know, Warner Bros. is one of the most reviled DVD producers of the major film companies. For awhile, many feared that Warner Bros. would package Harry Potter in one of its cheap, cardboard snapper cases, using a double-sided disc. While this was thankfully not the case, the results are definitely a disappointment. The packaging is still made of cardboard, with the discs being held in those awkward plastic boards ala Simpsons or Moulin Rouge. Considering that the movie is aimed at children, WB could've made sure the package was a little more child-friendly.But more importantly, especially for a two-disc set, the extras are sorely lacking. The majority of disc two is taken up by point and click ""interactive"" games that unlock the deleted scenes. I don't know who at Warner Bros thought the ""target audience"" would appreciate this, but my brother and sister are part of that audience, and they were left severly frustrated trying to access the deleted scenes. Besides those scenes, there is a mini featurette and a trailer or two, but almost nothing else. No commentaries, no special effects documentaries, interviews with J.K. Rowling, NOTHING. Harry Potter may use two discs, but only one was really needed. Warner needs to learn how to produce a proper two-disc special edition.As a movie, Harry Potter is worth the purchase. It's overly long, but still enjoyable.

I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato.Well, at least it was time well spent. Finally...some movies that really make the grade. I've been hard-pressed to find a good 5-star movie that I haven't seen. And here I've had these two sets of films that have been out there all this time that that for whatever reason I've had an aversion to. Silly me.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire were all at minimum very good. Certainly Socerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as 5-star as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, but look at the footsteps that it had to follow in.The list of A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (Home Alone and tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens in their debuts.Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. Columbus still had oversight as a producer, so perhaps Cuar&oacute;n felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuar&oacute;n just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in ""direction"" really shone through. And Cuar&oacute;n was gone for Goblet.Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuar&oacute;n back to another vet in Mike Newell, 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.It's must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating for Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Goblet...better start a rating system for playgrounds! How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example, S.W.A.T. (2003) that does indeed not only have the F-word, but strong violence and sex? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to ""protect"" our youth.I will indeed finish by saying that the first four of the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed close to $2,000,000,000 (that's a TWO BILLION dollars) because they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. And Goblet actually did better at the box office than Azkaban. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA.If you somehow missed these movies as I did for some crazy reason, I hope that my long-winded review has encouraged you to add them to your cart. As for Lord of the Rings...well that's another review entirely, of course.I can't wait for the upcoming continuation of the Harry Potter series with Order of the Phoenix in 2007 and Half-Blood Prince in 2008.

They're only about $10 more than the normal editions, and they come with loads of extras. However, I feel like when you call something an ""ultimate"" edition there's nothing more you can add to it. There's a lot here, but I think any Harry Potter fan would feel like you could have more content.What you do get are 3 discs loaded with stuff. You get pretty much everything you get from the original edition (which includes trailers, TV spots, deleted scenes, and a few other small features). What you get that's new is a 1 hour documentary of the making of the first film. it looks like each of these ultimate editions will come with a new chapter of making the film. So once all 8 films are released, you should end up with 8 hours of the making of Harry Potter.The packaging is pretty nifty. You get a hardcover art book, 2 cards (one of Harry and one of McGonagall), and a digipak case which contains the 3 discs. The art book has stills from the film, but the quality is exceptionally bad.I wish they had gone the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions route with these ultimate editions and re-cut the movie to include an hour of footage that you know they filmed but cut. I wish we had gotten commentaries from the actors and production team. I supposed we'll never get those now, since this is probably the last edition they'll release. It's a shame, because it could have really made this a great value and a must own for Harry Potter fans.So should you buy this? If you don't already own the films on Blu-Ray then it's definitely a must own. The extra content is worth the money. However, if you already own a Blu-Ray copy of the movie I can only recommend this for a die-hard Harry Potter fan. You're essentially paying $30 for a 1 hour documentary, a low-quality art book, some cards, and an extra cut of the film where they say ""Philosopher's Stone"" instead of ""Sorcerer's Stone""",4,"Good price, good content - but not ""ultimate""",1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,1990,"['ultimate', 'editions', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'value', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'films', 'Blu-Ray', 'yet', ""'re"", 'only', 'about', '10', 'more', 'normal', 'editions', 'come', 'loads', 'extras', 'However', 'feel', 'when', 'call', 'something', 'ultimate', 'edition', 'nothing', 'more', 'can', 'add', 'lot', 'here', 'think', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan', 'would', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'more', 'content.What', 'do', 'get', 'are', '3', 'discs', 'loaded', 'stuff', 'get', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'get', 'original', 'edition', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'few', 'other', 'small', 'features', 'What', 'get', 'new', '1', 'hour', 'documentary', 'making', 'first', 'film', 'ultimate', 'editions', 'will', 'come', 'new', 'chapter', 'making', 'film', 'So', 'once', '8', 'films', 'are', 'released', 'should', 'end', 'up', '8', 'hours', 'making', 'Harry', 'Potter.The', 'packaging', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'get', 'hardcover', 'art', 'book', '2', 'cards', 'one', 'Harry', 'one', 'McGonagall', 'digipak', 'case', '3', 'discs', 'art', 'book', 'stills', 'film', 'quality', 'exceptionally', 'bad.I', 'wish', 'had', 'gone', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Extended', 'Editions', 'route', 'ultimate', 'editions', 're-cut', 'movie', 'include', 'hour', 'footage', 'know', 'filmed', 'cut', 'wish', 'had', 'gotten', 'commentaries', 'actors', 'production', 'team', 'supposed', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'now', 'probably', 'last', 'edition', ""'ll"", 'release', 'shame', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'made', 'great', 'value', 'must', 'own', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fans.So', 'should', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'films', 'Blu-Ray', 'then', 'definitely', 'must', 'own', 'extra', 'content', 'money', 'However', 'already', 'own', 'Blu-Ray', 'copy', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'die-hard', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan', ""'re"", 'essentially', 'paying', '30', '1', 'hour', 'documentary', 'low-quality', 'art', 'book', 'cards', 'extra', 'cut', 'film', 'where', 'say', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'instead', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone']",N/A

The tone of this first Harry Potter movie is quite similar to those three, relying on whimsy and comedy rather than drama. That matches the tone of the book, so it is not a criticism. If you had read the first book, like me, you were probably looking forward to seeing the world of Harry Potter portrayed on the big screen. The adapted screenplay by Steve Kloves didn't disappoint.There's a lot to like about Sorcerer's Stone; the sets are vast, the important story elements are present, and the majority of the young actors do a good job. It's a tricky business casting children who have to develop over the course of a decade, but I don't find myself disliking any of the choices. It's great to see Hogwarts, the Hogwarts Express, Gringotts, Diagon Alley, and Quidditch brought to life.Sorcerer's Stone starts slowly and might seem overly long, but it's necessary to introduce the characters and the worlds they inhabit. I could imagine some people viewing this first installment and giving up on the franchise, but that would be a mistake. This is a vast story which starts off as a charming fantasy before quickly becoming much darker in tone. In a way, it mirrors childhood. We are initially fascinated with the world until we mature and realize that it does have plenty of problems. As the series progresses, the films grow more serious as the threat of evil increases.Some of the best moments include Harry first learning about the existence of Hogwarts, his initial flying lesson, and seeing the teachers demonstrate some of the spells that the children will learn. The main characters are fully realized and know a lot about them by the end of the movie.Sorcerer's Stone is a good blend of fantasy and action, with the final part of the film containing the most dramatic sequences as our three heroes try to recover the Philosopher's Stone. The music used in the movie is excellent, and the main theme itself suggests a magical setting. There are a lot of important themes in the series and I think it's generally a good example for children. The importance of friendship is one of the major messages and it all begins with the relationships between Harry, Ron and Hermione.The Harry Potter franchise isn't just for children. I'm 50 and I have worked my way through the books and the eight movies several times. The adults in the story are played by some of the finest British character actors. Can you imagine anyone other than Alan Rickman as Snape? Dumbledore was played by Richard Harris in this movie and the sequel, and I think I prefer his version to Michael Gambon's portrayal, although Gambon's version did work for the more serious tone present in the other movies.There's a whole generation of people who grew up loving Star Wars, but here's a franchise for the next generation. Sorcerer's Stone is funny and lighthearted compared to later entries in the franchise, but don't let that deter you from watching all eight movies. The adequate acting improves considerably as the children age throughout the series.",4,J.K.

525911,ANUSBCN463G1M,B00003CXI0,Steven Becker,"[4, 4]","I purchased this DVD quite some time ago....and quite frankly, I should bequeath upon it FIVE stars instead of four...and would have EXCEPT for something that happened this last weekend.I was visiting friends for the weekend and on Saturday (I think), ABC Family Channel was showing Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. It was a dreary afternoon so my friends and I settled down to a couple of hours of watching young Harry in his first year at Hogwarts. Suddenly, while watching the movie, I sat up and exclaimed out loud. ""Hey, that wasn't in the movie!"" Indeed, my friends and I agreed that we had just witnessed a scene that was not in the DVD version we all had (and therefore assumed not in the theatrical version either). After that first surprise, we watched with rapt attention and extra scene after extra scene passed before us to the place where we were kinda making it into a game as to who would discover something new first.Well I was excited at the notion that maybe the makers of the Potter movies were doing what Peter Jackson did with LOTR: namely, bring out extended versions of the original movies, a year or two after the first DVD release,When I got back home, I knew I had to find out if extended versions were indeed coming out. Of course I went to Amazon. com. ...only to read MenollyK's review which stated that the original DVDs were actually trimmed down versions of the movies that were seen in the theatres. I hadn't seen the first two Potter movies in the theatres so I wouldn't have known this. I remembered how George Lucas had trimmed down the very first VCR versions of Star Wars, episode IV back in the early 80's, And just like Lucas I supposed the powers-that-be behind the Potter films didn't think the viewers would notice (let alone mind) if they also cut a few things out. Of course, someone could buy the special edition DVD and I guess these scenes can be seen separately from the rest of the movie ...BUT really, what my friends and I saw on Saturday was extraordinary; the extra snippets here and there only added to the magic of the story! Who could possibly be upset at their addition to a film a whole lot of us have loved from the get-go.SO, I give the DVD version of The Sorceror's Stone FIVE stars because the movie is still wonderful; minus ONE star because someone decided that those extra scenes weren't necessary for those of us who paid good money for the DVD (even tho ABC Family Channel apparentally thought otherwise).Who knows, maybe there is a charm (or a curse) that will compell the powers-that-be to release the movies in their entirety some day.

It stays extremely faithful to the story (one might argue, too faithful) with very high production quality overall.There are some cheesy scenes -- the Quidditch match dazzles some unsophisticated viewers, but I found the special effects in that scene to be quite poorly done.The central story, that of a mistreated young boy who flourishes into a powerful wizard, is a universal theme that appeals especially to children. There is little objectionable material here, although some scenes are a bit scary.Two complaints -- Daniel Radcliffe looks the part, but lacks the spark that shines through in the books -- and there is a general lack of imagination on the part of the director, Christopher Columbus. Compared to the Lord of the Rings, which required a visionary director in Peter Jackson and included far more complicated themes, Columbus simply goes for the most sure-fire formulas for the box office.

I had read the books, and became an immediate fanatic... I was one of the people that piled into theatres the first day that it came out on the big screen.Let me start with the good things:1. I loved the sets. Hogwarts was great (love castles) and Diagon Alley's shops looked so interesting that I wanted to pop into one.2. Maggie Smtih (Professor McGonagal) was magnificent. When I had read the books, I pictured the professor to be rather large and frequently huff and puff down the hallways, but Smith's take on it was great. Completely bashed the other idea out of the water.3. Alan Rickman was great as Snape. Perfect voice- and I loved the contrast of the black hair and clothes against the dead white skin. Scared the heck out of me.4. The music to this movie was awesome. Seriously awesome. When the movie started with the theme music, I was on the edge of my seat...And it all went downhill from there.Like I said, there are a few bits of great acting, but the rest of the time...Harry Potter, for instance. Daniel Radcliffe looks like him- REALLY looks like him. That's the good part. But he NEVER shows any sort of emotion, and that's what got me. He never made me believe that he was really Harry Potter.Ron Weasley... Rupert Grint looked like him, and he was even funny sometimes. He didn't really get a lot of times in the spotlight, though, so you never really noticed that he was there.Hermione Granger was one of the biggest let-downs of them all. She was my favorite character in the books, because, even though she was sort of a scholarly snob, you eventually liked her even with her faults. Emma Watson played the character as snobby in the beginning at least KIND of well, and then when she, Harry, and Ron became friends, that entire side of her personality went away and she ceased being smart and ended up being one of the sidekicks.And what about the special effects? Fluffy looked fake... and so did Quidditch. I don't know if there's a way that you COULD make a three-headed dog or people flying around on broomsticks look real, but I think that they could have done a LOT better.All in all, I loved the sets.

I just happen to be one of the twelve people in the USA who hasn't seen this fable, and I finally decided to give it a try.  The premise and story are both interesting: Daniel Radcliffe is impressive as Harry Potter, a 11-year-old kid who is raised by his cruel relatives before he is shipped to school to become a wizard and befriends a couple of classmates who help him during a series of adventures.  At 2.5 hours, the movie passed along nicely, but ultimately suffered from an overall blandness that sank the movie.  I fault director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves, who apparently followed the book so closely so as not to include any surprises or any degree of spontaneity.  On a technical level, I wasn't all that blown away.  The scenes where the kids fly on the broomsticks were kind of blah, although the scenes with that three headed dog were impressive, if slightly reminiscent of &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;  All in all, I was slightly entertained but also disappointed.

His uncle and aunt know about it, and if not acting against it, they keep quiet about it.Then one day, a strange messenger appears starting a series of events that eventually lead the boy away from his foster home, have him join a bearded wizard/mentor that teaches him all about his power, he begins a friendship with another boy and a girl, and all three of them, with the wizard's advice, take off for a series of mind-blowing adventures that ultimately lead to the destruction of the dark one, the killer of the boy's parents.The Question.

525938,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00003CXI0,The Mysterious Traveler,"[1, 1]","HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERORS STONE(2001) Directed by Chris Columbus. Starring Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Fiona Shaw, John Cleese, Ian Hart, John Hurt and Richard Harris.The first in the series details the early childhood of Harry---son of a pair of powerful wizards named Potter who were murdered by a black wizard named Voldemort, the discovery of his magical heritage and his first year at Hogwarts--a magicians school rather like Eton and Cambridge except with monsters and ghosts. Besides the usual teenage angst, there are mysterious goings on at Hogwarts that conspire against Harry and his friends as the dread Voldemort seeks to gain the Sorcerors Stone which would allow him to remanifest himself and gain immortality.While some of the plot points could have been better explicated, this turned out to be a highly entertaining fantasy of much whimsey, imagination and not a little terror. The direction is solid. There is CGI in abundance but that is the world we live in so there is little point kvetching anymore.

Much of the content is just rehashed material from the film itself, and the interface is supremely irritating. Indeed, while first looking at it with two friends who are also great fans of the books and film, mere minutes of being assaulted by this lousy interface had everyone complaining loudly. There is no actual menu, and no direct way to access any of the supplementary material. To get to anything, you have to navigate through a series of screens relating to the story, and since nothing is labeled as to what it actually contains, you have to poke around endlessly to find anything interesting.Also, there isn't a lot of interesting supplementary content for an adult audience. Most of it is geared toward children. While this is a children's story, it actually has more adult fans, and the content should have much better accounted for all ages.Finally, the packaging of the set is horrible, flimsy cardboard. I would expect the outer box to last two seconds flat in the hands of children... and I don't expect it to last a terribly long time in the hands of adults.In conclusion, this is a superb movie superbly transferred to DVD, packaged in a really lousy boxed set that I think you'll be very disappointed with if you want anything at all more than the movie itself.",2,"Superb movie, Vile extras.",1022284800,"05 25, 2002",2002,1683,"['absolutely', 'book', 'movie', 'versions', 'story', 'Disc', '1', 'boxed-set', '100', '%', 'as', 'good', 'should', 'be', 'absolutely', 'lavish', 'transfer', 'film', 'rich', 'vivid', 'color', 'crisp', 'picture', 'excellent', 'sound', 'Indeed', 'think', 'had', 'better', 'viewing', 'experience', 'DVD', 'really', 'rather', 'nice', 'theater', 'saw', 'film', 'in.That', 'said', 'Disc', '2', 'was', 'MAJOR', 'disappointment', 'Much', 'content', 'just', 'rehashed', 'material', 'film', 'interface', 'supremely', 'irritating', 'Indeed', 'first', 'looking', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'fans', 'books', 'film', 'mere', 'minutes', 'being', 'assaulted', 'lousy', 'interface', 'had', 'everyone', 'complaining', 'loudly', 'actual', 'menu', 'direct', 'way', 'access', 'supplementary', 'material', 'get', 'anything', 'have', 'navigate', 'series', 'screens', 'relating', 'story', 'nothing', 'labeled', 'what', 'actually', 'have', 'poke', 'around', 'endlessly', 'find', 'anything', 'interesting.Also', ""n't"", 'lot', 'interesting', 'supplementary', 'content', 'adult', 'audience', 'Most', 'geared', 'children', 'children', 'story', 'actually', 'more', 'adult', 'fans', 'content', 'should', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'accounted', 'ages.Finally', 'packaging', 'set', 'horrible', 'flimsy', 'cardboard', 'would', 'expect', 'outer', 'box', 'last', 'two', 'seconds', 'flat', 'hands', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'last', 'terribly', 'long', 'time', 'hands', 'adults.In', 'conclusion', 'superb', 'movie', 'superbly', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'packaged', 'really', 'lousy', 'boxed', 'set', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'want', 'anything', 'more', 'movie']",N/A

The movie itself is wonderful - but the DVD set leaves a little to be desired.  The first DVD in the set is great.  They did a first rate job on the transfer and the sound.  The second DVD with all the extras though is lacking a certain something.The extras disc has just enough to make you want more but doesn't have some of the very things that we all heard about during all the publicity about the film.  I remember hearing over and over that the first cut of the film came in at over 3 1/2 hours.  Then on the disc there are only a few deleted scenes totally under 10 minutes.  They had the obligatory making of but that too seemed more than a bit short.  Another frustrating thing was navigating the extras - it was close to impossible.  It took me over ten minutes to work through the little game system to even access the deleted scenes(though I later discovered there was a very small place to click for direct access).  This just wasn't fun.  I don't enjoy being made to jump through hoops to watch a film and see the various extras packaged in.  Maybe they should release one version for adults who don't like the games and another for children who enjoy things like that.Overall I love the film but I have this feeling that they are holding back to release another set sometime.

That being said, I have never met anyone who had anything bad to say about the Potter films, so I finally decided to give it a shot, and boy was I surprised! For those select few who don't know the story, Harry Potter is the son of two legendary wizards, who was hidden with distant relatives, in order to protect him. Until his eleventh birthday, he had no idea that he was famous or had the potential to be the most power wizard the world has ever known. Potter is invited to join the Hogwarts school of wizardry and that is when the adventure begins. British Actor, Daniel Radcliffe, plays Potter and is nothing short of spectacular. Before the Potter films, Radcliffe had very limited acting experience and many say, he got the part, because of his resemblance to Harry Potter on the cover of the book. That may be how he got the part, but he defiantly shows he has the talent to go along with the right look. His performance was terrific, but there is something to be said about having the right Director, and Christopher Columbus was the perfect choice. Columbus has a ton of experience working with young newcomers in films with high expectations. Overall, the story is extremely well written, the young cast was refreshing and full of energy, the direction was stellar, and the set, costumes, and effects were some of the best I've ever seen. I'm not going to go run out and join a quitage team, but I am going to see the rest of the series.

525952,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B00003CXI0,Tom Birkenstock,"[1, 3]","Film adaptations must strike a tricky balance between dual demands: fidelity to the source material and obligations of the new medium.  If you steer too far from the core ideas of the original story, then you betray those who loved the story long before it was green lit by a studio.  But if you chain your film to the source material, then the end product might end up being a rote matter of connecting plot points.  Sometimes those who love the original book or story tend to think that all a director needs to do is paste pages up on the big screen, but this ignores that different mediums, by necessity, must tell a story in different ways.  Long exposition might be effective in a novel, but ideally a film communicates more concisely through visuals.  In fact, one of my favorite adaptations, Blade Runner, not only departs wildly from the original book, but also seems to be arguing against it.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first film in a very long series of adaptations, never manages to strike an appropriate balance between the book and its new home in cinemas.  From the beginning it becomes clear that this film is not for the uninitiated.  It starts with several wizards arriving at an English suburb to drop off a young baby.  We don't know who these people are or why they need to drop off this youngster off at someone's front door.  The scene has a nice ambience to it and leaves enough questions to drive the film forward, but for someone who has not read the book, the question of the relationship between the baby in the basket and the family he is being left with becomes somewhat troubling.  There is a long tradition in books and films of random babies being dropped off at someone's door, so we cannot assume there is some relationship between the baby and those he is left with.  It turns out they are his aunt and his uncle, but we don't discover this until almost a half-hour into the film, shortly before Harry leaves for Hogwarts.  This is a minor problem but it is indicative of an inability for the film to break from the novels and establish itself as a piece of art that can stand on its own two feet.We may not know who this family is, but it becomes clear early on that they are not the ideal family for an orphan.  They force Harry to live in a small closet under the stairs, and they clearly favor their biological son over the one left on their doorstep.  Not only is Harry's cousin spoiled beyond what is appropriate for a young child, but he also appears to be well on his way to contracting type-2 diabetes.  Luckily, when Harry reaches an appropriate age, he is recruited into Hogwarts, a school for young wizards.  This is something his aunt and uncle apparently dread, going so far as to move to the middle of nowhere to avoid the onslaught of acceptance letters from Hogwart's.  But this is to no avail, and Harry is recruited by Hagrid, a friendly, if slightly bumbling wizard, who has a difficult time keeping secrets when the plot requires a little more information in order to move forward.  Soon Harry learns that both his parents were wizards, but that they were murdered when he was very young, requiring the cadre of wizards from the beginning to deposit Harry at his aunt's and uncle's.Anyone who has read Joseph Campbell's A Hero with a Thousand Faces, or at least has seen Star Wars, can recognize the hero's journey in this setup.  The hero's journey is when a seemingly provincial protagonist is plucked from the mundane world in order to cross over into the world of magic and adventure.  Normally there is a guide who accompanies the hero as he traverses his way from the mundane to the magical.  In Star Wars this guide was Ben Kenobi, and here it's Hagrid.  The appeal of this setup is instantly recognizable.  Even if you were from the most well adjusted family, every child has felt persecuted by the seemingly arbitrary rules of adults.  And who hasn't felt as a child that you weren't destined for some grand adventure in your lifetime?Along the way to Hogwarts, Harry encounters the sociable Ron and the slightly uptight A-student Hermione.  Upon arriving to Hogwarts, all three wind up in the Griffindor House, which means they will be competing against students from other houses for top prize at the end of the year.  Hogwarts certainly owes more than a little something to the British private school system, and I would imagine a similar system of competition could feasibly exist in the childhood of many British subjects.  Even the villainous student Draco, of the Slytherin House, has a haughty air of aristocracy straight out of George Orwell's memoir ""Such, Such Were the Joys.""  (I'm giving little away when I tell you that Griffindor House wins the prize at the end of the year, but not before the headmaster, Dumbledor, lets Slytherin House think they have won.  This was a rather cruel move on Dumbledor's part and I half expected him to say ""psych"" before revealing that Griffindor won).In addition to midterms, social cliques and getting to class on time, Harry and the gang must also worry about a mysterious object that is being housed within the deep recesses of Hogwarts.  They learn that this magical object has the ability to free the villainous Voldemort (much like Dickens, Rowling likes to twist names so her audience is absolutely certain who is good and who is bad).  The students are up against a teacher, Severus Snape, who they believe is planning on stealing the object in order to smuggle it to Voldemort.There's much to enjoy about this first installment in the Harry Potter franchise, not the least of which is the filmmaker's intention of employing just about every great British actor imaginable (in addition to Robbie Coltrane and Hagrid, there's Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, John Cleese and John Hurt).  While the child actors aren't always on the same level as their elders, within the spectrum of child acting from bad (Anakin from Phantom Menace) to good (Elliot from E.T.) they're firmly within the middle.  Of the three main characters, however, it's Hermione who gets the most thankless role.  She's the student at the front of the class with her hand constantly in the air.  It's much easier to role your eyes at the A-student than to empathize.But the real appeal of a film like this is being able to see the world of J.K. Rowling on film.  Since I've never read the book, I can only compare this fantasy world to others.  Rowling deftly cobbles together time honored fantasy creatures and concepts, but assembles them in such a way that they manage to be both familiar and new.  The film paints Hogwarts as an ancient castle, but imbues it with a sense of kinetic energy.  It is a place where ghosts roam the halls as leisurely as students, where paintings come to life and where staircases never stay in the same place twiece.  Hogwarts, like an M.C. Escher drawing, appears to contain more space within its confines than is physically possible.  Rowling has also created a fun, if slightly confusing, game called Quidditch, which is similar to rugby but on flying broomsticks.Unfortunately, what really holds the film back is the direction.  At two and a half hours Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a lengthy film, which by itself isn't a problem.  I've seen enough David Lean films to enjoy immersing myself in a story.  And besides, part of the fun of a fantasy film is watching the filmmakers construct an entirely new world brick by brick.  The length wouldn't be a problem if the director was better skilled at creating atmosphere and urgency.  The director is Chris Columbus who showed promise in the 80s by directing films like Adventures in Babysitting and writing Goonies and Gremlins.  But since then he has become a third rate Spielberg with a higher tolerance for sentimentality.  Columbus draws his character with big bright crayons so no one can forget for one second who we are supposed to root against.  Harry's uncle is grossly obese, Draco's hair is slicked back like Gordon Geco from Wall Street, and even an opposing Quidditch player is given a mouthful of ungainly teeth.It's Columbus's cumbersome direction, which stumbles from one scene in the book to another, that ultimately stifles the film.  Instead of bringing the underlining mystery to the forefront of the movie, we are left to sightsee in Rowlings world, which isn't an entirely unpleasant experience, throughout most of the movie.  This first installment in the Harry Potter series likely offers more for fans of the book to enjoy than for the uninitiated who wish for nothing more than a new fantasy classic.",3,"Loyal to the book,

This filmed version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, adapted from the wildly popular book by J.K. Rowling, stunningly brings to life Harry Potter's world of Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards. The greatest strength of the film comes from its faithfulness to the novel, and this new cinematic world is filled with all the details of Rowling's imagination, thanks to exuberant sets, elaborate costumes, clever makeup and visual effects, and a cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me cast, including Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and more. Especially fine is the interplay between Harry and his schoolmates Ron and Hermione, as well as his protector, the looming Hagrid ). The second-half adventure--involving the titular sorcerer's stone--doesn't translate perfectly from page to screen, ultimately because of the film's fidelity to the novel; this is a case of making a movie for the book's fans, as opposed to a transcending film.

My favorite part was when they played chess against the human sized pieces. I can't help to compare it to the Lord of the Rings which was a superb movie and even better book. I find that more interesting because it is darker in nature and magic seems to be used as a means to an end not just to have for the matter of having it like it seemed to be in Potter.

However, just because a popular and world-famous book is turned into a movie, doesn't mean that the movie will be a success. Nor does it mean the movie will be any good. Often, movies based upon novels are terrible (look at the many bad movies based upon Stephen King stories, for instance). Sometimes, a movie based upon a novel ends up better than the original work (FIELD OF DREAMS or JURASSIC PARK for instance). However, it is a very rare case when a movie based upon a novel succeeds as a piece of cinema and stays true to the original work. HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is such a film. The film stays true to the novel on which is based and leaves very few details out. It also works quite well as a movie. Even more surprising is that the film successfully introduces the world of Harry Potter to the uninitiated without becoming bogged down in details. The actors do a brilliant job, the special effects are fairly believable, and the cinematography is picturesque. The only major drawback to the film is that the characters aren't completely fleshed out.

Example: Thanksgiving day our family was watching and wanted to see the deleted scenes. 15 minutes later, five adults over 25 were still trying to figure it out! It's funny now, but just be warned. Also a note for collectors and film buffs: The rest of the features on the DVD, save for a featurette, is geared for kids. Virtual tours, sorting hat etc..

It's quite simple, really. The key word is escapism. Children would love to be Harry Potter, sent away from their parents at an early age and then rescued by a giant and flown on a motorbike to a castle that teaches children to be the world's best witches and wizards. Unfortunately, however much of a classic these works of fiction are, every child is disappointed at the end of the day. But hey! Fiction is fiction, and it should stay like that. Harry Potter's parents were killed by Voldemort, an evil satanic wizard, and he is left to live in a cupboard with his bullyish cousins, the Dursleys. However, Hagrid rescues him well and takes him to the place of his dreams: Hogwarts School. Fighting through the toughest adventures possible, with an added touch of friendship and future romanticism, such a film entertains, and yet brings positive emotions to the viewer. Beautiful music by John Williams accompanies; and what's more, special effects are carefully used to really bring the viewer into the film himself. A brilliant, high budget movie, suitable for any ages, and certainly resemblant of the books themselves, this movie must be awarded five stars.

I understand that Rowling demanded artistic control, to make sure her story survived as well as it could, and it did. The casting was great. Alan Rickman made Snape into something that can never be repeated. Hermione, Ron, the professors - all brilliant matches of person to role. Even Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) was wonderful.

525980,AMMEMPM9MPS55,B00003CXI0,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[1, 1]","Harry Potter is a simply charming, exciting, and wholesome old-fashioned entertainment for children and adults alike. Christians (especially fundamentalists) decried the books when they came out, and then the film, but such hysteria betrays utter ignorance of what Potter is about, and where its roots lie. It stands in an ancient tradition of story-telling, with the familiar imagery of monsters and magic being used to illustrate the struggle between good and evil. At its core is a message that is truly Christian in spirit.Potter has humble beginnings, growing up with his aunt and uncle who reject and despise him, before on his 11th birthday discovering that invested in him are magical powers that most children only dream of. From there he is taken to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he must learn to use his powers responsibly and morally. Like Christ, Potter is faced at every turn with the temptation to misuse the powers he has been granted, to befriend evil and use his abilities for his own, selfish gain. His journey culminates in a final battle in which he faces evil head on and, in a fiery climax, laden with infernal imagery, he must decide whether to put his own desires (however legitimate and heartfelt they may be) above the good of others.The virtues of self-sacrifice, honour, and love clearly (and predictably, of course, but that is not the point) emerge the victors in this oft-told story of war between good and evil. How shallow must one be not to be able to see, beneath the trappings of mythology, magic and folklore, that this is the kind of tale every child wants to hear, and ought to hear? Potter's pilgrimage is one that begins with childish fascination with magical powers, but goes on to show us that power is not merely a toy, but is a gift which carries with it responsibility and duty; power means nothing and is worth nothing when it is wielded apart from love. As St Paul wrote, 'If I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing' (1 Corinthians 13:2).I asked myself what made Potter into such a hero. He is hardly any more interesting as a character than his peers: the presumptuous Hermoine Granger; Potter's unassuming best friend, Ron Weasley; and the dastardly Draco Malfoy. On the contrary, Potter is rather bland as a character, and there are far more curious traits to be found in others. He does, however, exemplify all that is good (even though he might be found ambiguous in some regards, but this is a staple of good story-telling). He is an underdog who, in finding that he has been given a precious gift, also finds justice and compensation for the way he has been treated. And it is a gift which he uses in the right way. The character of Harry Potter is no hazardous doorway into occultism and wizardry (as if Rowling's creation bore anything other than a very superficial resemblance to real witchcraft anyway); rather he is a role model in whom parents and teachers can have confidence. He is a hero, and his popularity is proof that goodness and virtue are still what people (children most of all) value, admire, and want to emulate.The tale is told with great excitement, awe and invention. Amongst a wonderful cast, Alan Rickman stands out as the creepily disconcerting Snape. As an exhilarating and enchanting adventure, even aside from the positive message conveyed, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is marvellous.",4,A Christian perspective on an engrossing fable,1025740800,"07 4, 2002",2002,3432,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'simply', 'charming', 'exciting', 'wholesome', 'old-fashioned', 'entertainment', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'Christians', 'especially', 'fundamentalists', 'decried', 'books', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'then', 'film', 'such', 'hysteria', 'betrays', 'utter', 'ignorance', 'what', 'Potter', 'where', 'roots', 'lie', 'ancient', 'tradition', 'story-telling', 'familiar', 'imagery', 'monsters', 'magic', 'being', 'used', 'illustrate', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'core', 'message', 'truly', 'Christian', 'spirit.Potter', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'growing', 'up', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'who', 'reject', 'despise', '11th', 'birthday', 'discovering', 'invested', 'are', 'magical', 'powers', 'most', 'children', 'only', 'dream', 'taken', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardry', 'where', 'must', 'learn', 'use', 'powers', 'responsibly', 'morally', 'Christ', 'Potter', 'faced', 'turn', 'temptation', 'misuse', 'powers', 'been', 'granted', 'befriend', 'evil', 'use', 'abilities', 'own', 'selfish', 'gain', 'journey', 'culminates', 'final', 'battle', 'evil', 'head', 'fiery', 'climax', 'laden', 'infernal', 'imagery', 'must', 'decide', 'put', 'own', 'desires', 'however', 'legitimate', 'heartfelt', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'others.The', 'virtues', 'self-sacrifice', 'honour', 'love', 'clearly', 'predictably', 'course', 'not', 'point', 'emerge', 'victors', 'oft-told', 'story', 'war', 'good', 'evil', 'How', 'shallow', 'must', 'one', 'be', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'beneath', 'trappings', 'mythology', 'magic', 'folklore', 'kind', 'tale', 'child', 'hear', 'ought', 'hear', 'Potter', 'pilgrimage', 'one', 'childish', 'fascination', 'magical', 'powers', 'show', 'power', 'not', 'merely', 'toy', 'gift', 'responsibility', 'duty', 'power', 'nothing', 'worth', 'nothing', 'when', 'wielded', 'apart', 'love', 'St', 'Paul', 'wrote', 'have', 'faith', 'can', 'move', 'mountains', 'have', 'not', 'love', 'am', 'nothing', '1', 'Corinthians', '13:2', '.I', 'asked', 'what', 'made', 'Potter', 'such', 'hero', 'hardly', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'peers', 'presumptuous', 'Hermoine', 'Granger', 'Potter', 'unassuming', 'best', 'friend', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'dastardly', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'contrary', 'Potter', 'rather', 'bland', 'character', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'curious', 'traits', 'be', 'found', 'others', 'however', 'exemplify', 'good', 'even', 'might', 'be', 'found', 'ambiguous', 'regards', 'staple', 'good', 'story-telling', 'underdog', 'who', 'finding', 'been', 'given', 'precious', 'gift', 'also', 'justice', 'compensation', 'way', 'been', 'treated', 'gift', 'right', 'way', 'character', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'hazardous', 'doorway', 'occultism', 'wizardry', 'Rowling', 'creation', 'anything', 'other', 'very', 'superficial', 'resemblance', 'real', 'witchcraft', 'anyway', 'rather', 'role', 'model', 'whom', 'parents', 'teachers', 'can', 'have', 'confidence', 'hero', 'popularity', 'proof', 'goodness', 'virtue', 'are', 'still', 'what', 'people', 'children', 'most', 'value', 'admire', 'want', 'emulate.The', 'tale', 'told', 'great', 'excitement', 'awe', 'invention', 'Amongst', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'out', 'creepily', 'disconcerting', 'Snape', 'exhilarating', 'enchanting', 'adventure', 'even', 'aside', 'positive', 'message', 'conveyed', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'marvellous']",N/A

The special effects in the movie are, on the whole, fantastic, a fact which becomes obvious upon Harry's first entrance into the Great Hall. Most amazing of all may be the spectacular presentation of the game of Quidditch. While almost all of Rowling's descriptions in the novel come leaping off the page, it is a little difficult to get a real picture of Quidditch in one's head; thanks to the movie, my days of struggling to really visualize the game as it is played are a thing of the past. There are a couple of occasions upon which the special effects look just a tad hokey, but the overall effect of the film is so magical that I'm not complaining. Indeed, I find it quite refreshing indeed to see a film follow the author's original words and scenes so faithfully; there were minor adjustments to the story along the way, and in a couple of cases the changes actually proved more effective than the original scene would have played on the big screen. The cast is excellent up and down the line. Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter as far as I'm concerned, but I was even more impressed by Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley and Emma Watson (my favorite) as the incomparable Hermione Granger. Richard Harris' brilliant performance as Albus Dumbledore will be sorely missed in future films. I would be remiss to forget Robbie Coltrane's critical contribution as the one and only Hagrid, but by far the most effective job is done by Alan Rickman, whose performance as Professor Snape ranks among the most impressive acting jobs I've ever seen.Everybody knows the plot of the movie by now. The only weakness in this epic production comes in the form of snippets and scenes from Rowling's novel that were not included - this is understandable, as the movie runs a good two and a half hours as it is. The ending seems to come up just a little short, yet it is quite enjoyable as it is. A few plot points that reveal more about some of the key characters can only be found in the book, but the fact that they are most important in terms of what they betoken for future novels and movies makes them a little less than crucial for this first Harry Potter motion picture. Overall, as a full-grown adult clinging to what few fancies of youth he has left, I have to say I loved every minute of this movie. Its commitment to Rowling's vision is to be commended, and there can be no doubt that there are bigger and better adventures yet to come in both book and movie form.The DVD features are, at least to a certain point, rather fun to mess around with, but they probably appeal more to young people than adults. I for one began to grow a little bored after touring Hogwart's, but the fact is that anything on top of the movie itself is just a bonus.

However, watching the movie closely following the reading experience will actually expand upon the Potter myth (I gave the first book four stars) due to this film's ability to lay the groundwork of the series in such stunning visuals and characters.For a basic plot summary, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" sees young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) living with his aunt and uncle and being mistreated horribly (sleeping in a closet under the stairs, told how rotten he is all the time, etc.).  Right before his 11th birthday, however, Harry begins receiving letters from a mysterious owl (as well as a visit from a rather large gentleman riding a flying motorcycle) informing him that he is in fact from wizard lineage.  Thus, Harry is whisked away to Hogwarts, a ""Wizard Academy"" of sorts, to begin his training.  While at Hogwarts, Harry meets new friends Ron (Rupert Grint) & Hermoine (Emma Watson) as well as discovers the mystery behind the death of his parents regarding a shadowy character called Voldemort.In terms of following the novel, this film does a pretty good job of keeping in lock-step.  There are certain scenes that are excised for time/continuity and a few ""facts"" from the book that are blatantly different from the movie, but other than that it is a great representation.In fact, in a departure from the norm, I actually enjoyed the movie experience better than the book.  Why?  Because of the way it was able to so wonderfully put a visual to all the great characters.  For some, the ""mystery is gone"" when they see their literary characters up on the big screen, but in this case I was very pleased to put a face to all these great characters.The movie also has (just like the book) a sense of ""epic-ness"" to it.  It is very clear that this is only the beginning of an epic series, with more and more mysteries and character development to come.Thus, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" is a great cinematic experience that will leave you wanting more as soon as it concludes.  The mysteries and characters are paced perfectly, and the story (as it is geared for young adults in the first place) is easy enough to latch onto while nuanced enough to get sucked into.",5,Visual Awe Vaults It Even Over Book,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,2320,"['watch', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'reading', 'book', 'first', 'are', 'certain', 'narrative', 'points', 'will', 'miss', 'not', 'quite', 'be', 'clear', 'usual', 'However', 'watching', 'movie', 'closely', 'following', 'reading', 'experience', 'will', 'actually', 'expand', 'Potter', 'myth', 'gave', 'first', 'book', 'four', 'stars', 'due', 'film', 'ability', 'lay', 'groundwork', 'series', 'such', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'characters.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'young', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'living', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'being', 'mistreated', 'horribly', 'sleeping', 'closet', 'stairs', 'told', 'how', 'rotten', 'time', 'etc.', 'Right', '11th', 'birthday', 'however', 'Harry', 'receiving', 'letters', 'mysterious', 'owl', 'as', 'well', 'visit', 'rather', 'large', 'gentleman', 'riding', 'flying', 'motorcycle', 'informing', 'fact', 'wizard', 'lineage', 'Thus', 'Harry', 'whisked', 'away', 'Hogwarts', 'Wizard', 'Academy', 'sorts', 'begin', 'training', 'Hogwarts', 'Harry', 'new', 'friends', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermoine', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'as', 'well', 'discovers', 'mystery', 'death', 'parents', 'regarding', 'shadowy', 'character', 'called', 'Voldemort.In', 'terms', 'following', 'novel', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'lock-step', 'are', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'excised', 'time/continuity', 'few', 'facts', 'book', 'are', 'blatantly', 'different', 'movie', 'other', 'great', 'representation.In', 'fact', 'departure', 'norm', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'experience', 'better', 'book', 'Why', 'way', 'was', 'able', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'put', 'visual', 'great', 'characters', 'mystery', 'gone', 'when', 'see', 'literary', 'characters', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'case', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'put', 'face', 'great', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'also', 'just', 'book', 'sense', 'epic-ness', 'very', 'clear', 'only', 'beginning', 'epic', 'series', 'more', 'more', 'mysteries', 'character', 'development', 'come.Thus', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'great', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'will', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'as', 'soon', 'mysteries', 'characters', 'are', 'paced', 'perfectly', 'story', 'geared', 'young', 'adults', 'first', 'place', 'easy', 'enough', 'latch', 'nuanced', 'enough', 'get', 'sucked']",N/A
525984,A318RKL1I9ABCM,B00003CXI0,"""zaloop""","[6, 11]","This is supposed to be a review of Harry Potter, but I feel like talking about two previews I saw before Harry Potter more than Harry Potter itself: the newest Lord of the Rings and Star Wars: Episode II trailers, which were amazing and contained more originality, imagination, and pure excitement in them than HP did in its entire 2 hour-30 minute running time. HP proves that popularity (2nd or 3rd highest international gross so far) does not always equal quality.The film is about a boy, Harry Potter, who is raised by brutal and uncaring foster parents in a cupboard storage area under the stairs of their house (no, I'm being serious). One day he receives an invitation to Hogwarts, a school for training wizards, and Harry sets off to begin his career as a wizard in training. On the way, he discovers information about the death of his natural parents and is caught up in a plot to get the eponymous sorceror's stone.I appreciate how HP tries to contain a somewhat complex plot, complete with a mystery and history. It's very ambitious for a kid's film, but it still fails to succeed in this area. The first 15 minutes - showing Harry in his life with his foster parents - are nothing short of unbearable; Harry's situation and his mean parents are meant to evoke sympathy for his character and provide pathos, but it all ends up playing out as a comedy with the parents not being threatening at all but just bumbling fools. His treatment does not end up accomplishing what it should - making us genuinely desire that Harry go to Hogwarts and escape this undeserved life - but rather only serves as a kind of weird, humorous mess, and the only reason we are happy Harry has gotten into Hogwarts is because it means this segment of the film is finally over.On the journey through the film we do encounter some nice visuals, the direction here being at its strongest: the Dickensian detail of Diagon Alley, the interior of Hogwarts with its morphing paintings, shifting stairs, transparent ceiling, and so on. However, Chris Colombus is not an Oscar tier director, to put it lightly, and one can only sigh to imagine how someone capable like Spielberg or even Tim Burton would have brought the film to more life. The effects also hamper the film a lot (except the invisibility cloak, which is quite impressive in a simple way) - the troll and three-headed dog look awful, as does a lot of the Quidditch match, and the centaur looks like a videogame character on par with the awful job they did with the Scorpion King at the end of Mummy Returns.The acting is fine. Radcliffe is good because he's good at being shy and understated, which is what his character is like. Alan Rickman is devilishly entertaining and drips his lines with venom. The other kids are okay, sometimes bordering on annoying.The Quidditch match is a much ballyhooed action piece in the film, and it turns out to be pretty mediocre. There is great speed and velocity in it, to be sure; but the CG people on broomsticks turn out to be quite fake looking when the film decides to speed their frame rate up to 10 times their previous speed in the blink of a second, in the hopes that we won't notice and will just think it's their lightning reflexes. The game itself never gets very interesting because the rules are various and confusing, and are only explained in a brief two minute segment beforehand. I find myself asking more questions about how the game is supposed to be played and why people aren't just chasing after that damn golden ball thing instead of being able to ""enjoy"" the match.I mentioned the LOTR and SW trailers that played before this, and I must say I am glad these other fantasy/sci-fi films are coming/have come out relatively soon after HP, because hopefully people will realize just how much HP ""borrows"" ideas and elements from them, especially LOTR. Potter, to be completely honest, just isn't a very imaginative or creative film: the wizards are the typical long-bearded type (Richard Harris' Dumbledor looks like a carbon copy of Gandalf from LOTR), the witches are the typical broomstick-wielding, black pointy hat-wearing type, the goblins look like a cross between Yoda and (again) the goblins we will see in LOTR, the spells and magic we see in the film aren't anything new or interesting, there aren't any truly exciting action sequences, and there are plot holes galore: Why does Snape hate Harry? Can't Dumbledor come up with a better spell to protect the sorceror's stone? What did Voldemort have against Harry's parents in the first place?I don't want to waste much more time talking about this film. Honestly, why has this film been so popular? Even if we ignore the obvious ""inspirations"" it has taken from other sources and look at it for its ""own merits,"" we still end up with a cheesy, kiddie fantasy flick with clich&eacute;d and typical fantasy wizard/witch figures, cutesy kid characters that spout cheesy comic relief one-liners like ""wicked!"" or ""she really needs to straighten out her priorities,"" fake special effects, an action sequence played up to be the central event in the film that is bogged down by poor CG and confusing rules, a running time that is too long, subplots that take the film off on a tangent but end up contributing nothing to the central ""story"" , a very silly ending, and the fact that we still come away from the film knowing almost nothing about wizardry.But what do I know? 600 million dollars can't be wrong. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to finish watching the special features for Phantom Menace and begin getting hyped up for Episode II, because unlike Harry Potter, Star Wars deserves its popularity.",2,"Unimaginative, un-magical mess",1013472000,"02 12, 2002",2002,5662,"['supposed', 'be', 'review', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'feel', 'talking', 'two', 'previews', 'saw', 'Harry', 'Potter',

Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone is a feast for the eyes, it is beautifully filmed, the special effects are fantastic, and the cast is excellent.The story centers around young Harry Potter who discovers his destiny as a great wizard and goes off to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter is played by the brilliant young actor Daniel Radcliffe who seems perfect for the role, not just in looks, but also in his gestures and mannerisms. His best friends Ron Weasley [Rupert Grint], and Hermione Granger [Emma Watson] are perfectly cast as well, and together, these three young actors make the story of Harry Potter's exploits come alive.The rest of the supporting cast is excellent as well - Richard Harris's Dumbledore reminds me of Gandalf the Grey, he is dignified, and full of wisdom. Maggie Smith delights as the strict Professor Minerva McGonagall, and Alan Rickman truly breathes life into the character of sly, cunning Professor Snape who seems to have a secret agenda of his own. Robbie Coltrane's gentle giant Hagrid is amazing as well.The costumes exceed expectations - truly what one might expect of characters playing wiches and wizards, and the creatures such as the centaurs, dragon etc are fun to watch, as are the special effects.This is a great movie for both kids and adults - a great beginning to the series and truly outstanding in its storytelling skills.
