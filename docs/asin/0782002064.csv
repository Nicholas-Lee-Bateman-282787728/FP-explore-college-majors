How my heart sank when I saw the once happy home turned into a dark dilapidated abandoned hulk, in the living ""dream"".But then ... a heart chastened, an angel about to get his wings, a ""Hee Haw"" -- and the world turns right side up, once again letting in the warmth of Christmas Cheer and the true meaning of FRIENDSHIP, DEVOTION and FAMILY.No matter that the movies back in those days were made in black and white.....the cast of characters in ""It's A Wonderful Life"" truly provided the color and warmth to this one.",5,Even SCROOGE would love this movie!!!!,1069977600,"11 28, 2003",2003,1558,"['James', 'Stewart', 'Gee', 'Whillikers', 'Gosh', 'Golly', 'isms', 'movie', 'always', 'spellbound', 'walk', 'away', 'glow', 'somewhat', 'one', 'imparted', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'Holiday', 'Hot', 'Buttered', 'Rum', 'heart.I', ""'m"", 'caught', 'up', 'family', 'father', 'dear', 'mother', 'devoted', 'children', 'ages', 'comings', 'goings', 'bustling', 'house', 'rowdy', 'happy', 'group', 'friends', 'REALLY', 'was', 'back', 'days', 'trademark', 'Hee', 'Haw', 'lasted', 'thru', 'time', 'trauma', 'close-knit', 'group', 'citizens', 'who', 'took', 'civic', 'duties', 'neighborliness', 'seriously.The', 'plots', 'subplots', 'are', 'dexterously', 'woven', 'one', 'running', 'seamlessly', 'very', 'funny', 'Damsel-in-Distress-Caught-in-the-Bushes', 'followed', 'immediately', 'very', 'serious', 'heartbreaking', 'family', 'trauma', 'seriously', 'sick', 'father', 'yet', 'nothing', 'sacrificed', 'transition', 'plots', 'human', 'dignity', 'plotline.This', 'movie', 'held', 'spellbound', 'boy', 'did', 'freeze', 'when', 'looked', 'down', 'ice-bound', 'dark', 'freezing', 'river', 'How', 'heart', 'sank', 'when', 'saw', 'once', 'happy', 'home', 'turned', 'dark', 'dilapidated', 'abandoned', 'hulk', 'living', 'dream', '.But', 'then', 'heart', 'chastened', 'angel', 'get', 'wings', 'Hee', 'Haw', 'world', 'right', 'side', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'letting', 'warmth', 'Christmas', 'Cheer', 'true', 'meaning', 'FRIENDSHIP', 'DEVOTION', 'FAMILY.No', 'matter', 'movies', 'back', 'days', 'were', 'made', 'black', 'white', '..the', 'cast', 'characters', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'truly', 'provided', 'color', 'warmth', 'one']",N/A
39502,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,0782002064,A Customer,"[4, 12]","Summary:George Bailey (James Stewart) is a hometown boy with big aspirations.  After finishing high school, he is going to tour Europe then go to college and become a big name architect and construction job manager, building huge dams and great projects.  Everything seems to be headed that way, too, until his father, Peter Bailey (Samuel S. Hinds), has a stroke and ends up dying.  His father was the head of the local Savings and Loan and without his guidance, the vile Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the town miser, plans on a forced takeover of the Savings and Loan, much to George's Uncle Billy's (Thomas Mitchell) wishes (and to the detriment of the town's poor).The only way to save the Savings and Loan is for George, whom everyone respects and trusts, to step in as the new chairman and takeover.  Giving up his tour of Europe and college education, George does the 'right' thing, and takes over the Savings and Loan, which is really the only thing standing between the poor of the town having a chance to live decent lives and Mr. Potter taking over everything and grinding them into the mud.In giving up his college dreams, George has to watch while his younger brother, Harry (Todd Karns), uses his money to go to college, becomes a football star, then a war hero.  George also watches his new found love, Mary (Donna Reed), go off to school.  All of this turns George bitter, but he presses on, despite the problems.  Eventually one good thing does happen, Mary comes back, and despite his bitterness towards his lost opportunities, George marries Mary and they make a life together as the advocates of the town's poor.George, who helps the poor despite it hurting the Savings and Loan and keeping him perpetually poor, eventually runs into trouble.  His forgetful uncle, Billy, loses an $8,000 deposit on Christmas Eve, just when the local auditor comes to check over their books.  Without that money, George and Billy are bound to go to jail.  As it turns out, Mr. Potter is the one who found it, but because he wants to crush them out of business, he doesn't give them the money.For George, this is the last straw.  Knowing his life is ruined, he finally breaks down and is mean to people, starting with his Uncle, but moving to his wife, kids, their schoolteachers, and, well, pretty much everyone.  Until his guardian angel happens upon the scene, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers).  Clarence appears just in time to stop George from killing himself then helps him to see all of the good that he has done for the people of the town and how much they need him.  Once George realizes this, he can't wait to get back home, despite the impending jail sentence.But when he returns home, even though the police and the auditor are waiting for him, he finds that his incredible wife has brought the townspeople together and they are going to bail him out.  Thus ends a touching tale about how kindness can make you much wealthier in terms of relationships than can money.My Comments:Believe it or not, I had never seen this movie, despite it supposedly being a classic Christmas film.  I was a bit hesitant, because I tend to enjoy psychological thrillers much more than sappy dramas, but I ended up appreciating this movie.  However, my appreciation went much further than what I would consider the superficial heroics of George Bailey, who saved his younger brother and was nice to people.  It was also deeper than the townspeople coming together in the end to save George and the Savings and Loan.  What I really liked about this movie was the communism.  Yep, that's right, this is pure communist propaganda and I loved every second of it.  But before I get into that, let me talk about the story and the acting.The story is pretty straightforward.  It does cover quite a bit of time, but does so well and convincingly.  There aren't any major plot holes and the only kind of quirky thing is the intervention of the guardian angel.  For most people, the divine intervention is probably one of the best parts of the film.  As an agnostic, I recognized that many people probably enjoyed this notion, but it was really just a necessary tool to illustrate to George what life would have been like had he not been born.  And, yes, the portrayal of George's town without him was a bit extreme, and the idea of someone not being born wasn't particularly well-fleshed out (though this is a drama and not a science fiction thriller).  But overall, it's a sound story that hits all the right marks to jerk a tear.The acting is also good.  There are some weaker links, like Thomas Mitchell and some of the other peripheral characters, but the main actors, Stewart and Reed, were really very good.  (Oh, and Donna Reed, am I the only one that thinks she's attractive?  I never thought I'd hear myself say that about Donna Reed...)  Anyway, I can't really complain about the acting.  It was really good for its time and pretty good for today.Now, back to communism.  Yes, this movie is about communism, but not Soviet or Chinese communism.  This is essentially a boiled down version of Marxist communism, where the people own everything. It also is a brilliant depiction of the exploitation of the working classes by the bourgeoisie, in this case Mr. Potter.  George's attempts to help the poor and maintain the Savings and Loan are Capra's way of defeating capitalist exploitation.  Hooray for the little man!  Three cheers for labor unions!  If Frank Capra was just trying to tell a story and was not trying to criticize capitalism, then I'm a double-headed pig that can use a computer.Overall, this is a very good film.  It is well-produced, convincing (except for the whole guardian angel/talking in space thing), and the acting is good.  But what's more, it has an anti-capitalist message.  I can't say it was perfect, but it was touching and inspirational.  If only we could take out the religion stuff, I'd say we have a rallying cry for social democracy (okay, leave in the religion for now, but eventually...).  Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie, yes, it's sappy, but it's also heart-warming (and Donna Reed's cute).  You should definitely check it (and her) out.",4,touching; not perfect; anti-capitalist (woohoo!),1068681600,"11 13, 2003",2003,6179,"['Summary', 'George', 'Bailey', 'James', 'Stewart', 'hometown',

Working as a young clerk in a pharmacy, he tried to correct a mistake by the pharmacist, and is slapped around for this. [Could this happen to the son of a banker?] The pharmacist's son had died in the war (influenza!) and this distracted the pharmacist (drank too much?). Later George enters a dance contest, and some of them take an unintended bath [symbolizing the Crash and Depression]. George's college plans are halted by his father's illness [a symbol for hard times]. Another crisis follows the attempt by Banker Potter to appropriate the Building & Loan Society [which provides loans to working people so they could move from the cold water tenements owned by Potter]. But the Board decides to continue with George Bailey as Executive Secretary. George's younger brother goes to college, marries an heiress, and moves away. There is one scene where Uncle Billy has overdone his celebrating [nepotism is always a problem].Mary gets a call from Sam while George is there. They learn of a stock offer in plastics - ""the deal of a lifetime"". People in Bedford Falls are out of work since the factory closed down. Later George and Mary are married on a rainy day, but are interrupted by a run on their bank [no FDIC in those days]. George takes charge and saves the business from the schemes of Potter. George's speech explains the economics of banking to the audience: they will be all right if they just stick together. One sunny day shows a family (with a goat!) moving to a new housing tract [as occurred in the 1920s]. This was possible after local farming closed down. This affects the rent profits of Banker Potter, whose tenements are losing renters. [They hadn't yet figured out to fill them up with Welfare clients.]Potter makes a generous offer to buy George. He refuses, and shows he could learn some diplomacy and tact. Trouble occurs when Uncle Billy loses the cash he was supposed to deposit! [Pride goes before a fall.] Potter finds it and keeps it. [Did you expect him to be honest?] This was a management failure on George Bailey's part - sending out a boy on a man's job. George's request for help from Potter is soundly rejected. And so Angel Clarence intervenes. What would happen if George Bailey was never born? [This reminded me of ""A Christmas Carol"".] At the end the people come up with the cash to meet the bank's needs. And so the story has a happy ending. [Can you believe this?] Bedford Falls doesn't wind up as Pottersville.In real life Banker Potter would have to turn any found money over to the police. Potter has also broken Banking Laws by taking depositor's money without any accounting or receipt. If his servant talked, Potter would spend the rest of his life in jail. Some have noticed the absence of religious persons in this film; what does that say? No mention of other members of the ruling families in this town. I always thought this film had a subtle anti-alcohol message.

With all major networks vying to get their hands on this mediocre blockbuster, this little film transforms from ordinary to cult status every holiday.  As a viewer, outside of the final act, this Jimmy Stewart classic is more than just a Christmas movie, but instead a powerful Capra film that demonstrates an America from long ago.  It shows a small-town America, without the plowed Wal-Mart roads or big-box makeovers.  For this critic, it demonstrates the power of independent business, and why we may never find this type of service ever again.  As an independent, downtown shop owner of about a year and a half myself; ""It's A Wonderful Life"" transformed this viewing from holiday pastime to dedicated film exposing the corruptive nature of capitalism as well as the realism of independent business.  With this change in tact, Jimmy Stewart's words become more emotional, Donna Reed's actions become more honest, and our little Christmas film transforms into a man's journey to search for himself.  I cannot denounce that this is a holiday film, Stewart screams ""Merry Christmas"" throughout the entire ending, but before that final conclusion there are about two hours of small town America and one man's struggle to escape.  ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a powerful blend of realism and fantasy, individualism and community, dreams and truth, as well as frustration and joy.  The cast is superbly placed in their respective roles and Capra's action behind the camera stands boldly in place.  This is not just a movie, but an experience coupled with foreshadowing - giving George not just a glimpse of a world without him - but also a glimpse of a world without small business""It's A Wonderful Life"", the film itself, is beautifully crafted.  With new editions being released each season, one can easily see the crisp beauty of Capra's image.  Its characters; George Bailey, Mary, Sam Wainright, Potter, Bert and Ernie, and even Clarence seem to jump from the screen, giving us imaginative citizens to this quaint town of Bedford Falls.  Capra not only gives these characters spirits and souls, but also the town.  Capra built three blocks of Bedford Falls so that he could capture the honesty of the town that Stewart so adamantly wanted to leave - and upon doing this gave this little town a soul of its own.  Watching this film, Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey runs the gambit of powerhouse acting.  Stewart, freshly back from the war, was worried if he could carry the weight of Bailey's cynicism.  His ability to care for Bedford Falls, while always dreaming of wanting to escape could only be portrayed through Stewart's Americana eyes.  When he screams at Mary, denouncing his desire to be on the ground floor in plastics, or when he yells at Potter's bid to join him - we scream with him.  This film works from an acting standpoint because we believe in the characters - we trust the actors to give us a slice of their souls for these roles - and they do.  One cannot fault anyone in this film for their acting and that is a rarity in today's Hollywood.Capra's eye in this film seems far more advanced than the credit he has received.  His enormous sets, the birth of a new ""snow"", and his ability to create a world we care for without having to travel the globe.  What I enjoy about ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is that Capra tricks you by the end.  Here we believe, outside of the brief opening, that this is just your typical drama, a man's life is shown in scope so that he can see his full worth, but then sneakily Capra brings in (depending on your religious basis) a huge science-fiction element that was unheard of during the time.  One cannot argue the validity of science fiction vs. religion in this film - since Joseph is portrayed by the stars and planets.  Sure, Clarence was an angel, but there is this aura of the supernatural.  Clarence offers no evidence that he is, in fact, sent by the man upstairs, so one has to question the time this film was released, the faith in spirituality, and the fact that Capra's Clarence could be alien, vegetable, or mineral.  This film teeters between drama and science fiction, while so many critics award this film the ""feel-good"" holiday movie during December; I find it a bit strange that perhaps this film lead to so many other science fiction movies of the same nature.  Perhaps the ""Cloverfield"" monster could be considered a Clarence to someone in New York City?  I may be stretching a bit, but what pulls me into this film time and time again is the fact that Clarence is not of Earth, yet George easily believes.  He listens, follows, and - with some resistance - does what Clarence orders.  This is a film without guns, without explosions, without the President getting on his red phone - but instead a film where a celestial being can visit someone without fear, anger, or confusion.  This is why I collect the ""Alf"" television series.Overall, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" remains in constant rotation no matter the time of year in my home.  The acting is superb, the sci-fi element seems fresh every time, and the growing fact that George Bailey is pro-independent business means quite a bit in this rushed Wal-Mart world.  Bailey, and this film, is the voice for the little man, the quiet shopkeeper who doesn't want to sell to Potter, but instead dreams of keeping their home-style values.  The spark between Potter and Bailey can be seen in every facet of today's growing world, as the rich continue to get richer - the less fortunate work harder and feel more held back.  Dreams are traded for jobs - communities are strengthened by friendships.  This film is a time capsule for the future, as we discover convenience overcomes customer service; it is nice to look back and see a world like Bedford Falls.  The science fiction element to this film, yep - that is what I am considering it - comes in sharp and remains powerful throughout.  Did anyone else see Jimmy Stewart's eyes throughout those scenes?  Brilliant!  While this film will remain a staple through the holidays, I persist that you watch it away from the holiday to see the real message behind the film.  Capra was a genius in creating this film, and subsequently crafted a cult film that will remain forever.  Even today, nearly thirty years since my first viewing, I am more impressed that ever.  It is a film that grows with you, and that is quite a rarity in today's cinema.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,The Big-Box Swindle of Bedford Falls,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,6517,"['many',

39512,A3CSRP3P4U9HI,0782002064,Alan R. Holyoak,"[32, 39]","&quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; starring James Stewart and Donna Reed, did OK, but not super, at the box office in 1947.  Perhaps it was too sentimental.  Nevertheless, this movie has, in the meantime, become one of  the most widely known, most watched and beloved of director-genius Capra's  films.The premis of the story (just in case you've been off planet for  the past 53 years) is this... What would life be like if someone had never  been born?  What effect does one seemingly insignificant life have on the  lives of others that a person brushes against during their life?  Well, in  this movie George Bailey (played by Stewart) gets the chance to see just  that.  An apprentice angel arranges the whole thing.I am amazed each  time I watch this film to see how small acts and interactions have major  effects in the lives of others -- family members, et al.The  Christmas-time setting of this film has certainly contributed to much of  its success and appeal.  That, the hometown feel of the setting, the  next-door neighborly nature of the characters, the story itself, and stars  like Stewart, Reed, and others, make this film a timeless classic.Is  this film sentimental?  Certainly!  Is it watchable?  Definitely!  Should  you own it?  Absolutely.5 stars, only because that's the highest rating  possible.Buy this video!On a side note...you may be interested to  know that biologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote a book titled &quot;Wonderful  Life&quot; (taken from the title of this film) in which he pulls on a  premis similar to the one in this movie -- the theme is contingency and the  evolution of life.  It's a &quot;what-if&quot; question.  What if, for  example, one of a group of animal's ancestors had turned right instead of  left and was killed and left no offspring, then what?  It's an interesting  read about life of the Burgess Shale (Cambrian animal fauna).  If it sounds  interesting, give it a look, it's quite readable.Alan Holyoak",5,All time Capra classic..perhaps his most viewed,963273600,"07 11, 2000",2000,1963,"['quot', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'starring', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'did', 'OK', 'not', 'super', 'box', 'office', '1947', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'too', 'sentimental', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'meantime', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'widely', 'known', 'most', 'watched', 'beloved', 'director-genius', 'Capra', 'films.The', 'premis', 'story', 'just', 'case', ""'ve"", 'been', 'off', 'planet', 'past', '53', 'years', 'What', 'would', 'life', 'be', 'someone', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'What', 'effect', 'one', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'life', 'have', 'lives', 'others', 'person', 'brushes', 'life', 'Well', 'movie', 'George', 'Bailey', 'played', 'Stewart', 'chance', 'see', 'just', 'apprentice', 'angel', 'whole', 'thing.I', 'am', 'amazed', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'small', 'acts', 'interactions', 'have', 'major', 'effects', 'lives', 'others', 'family', 'members', 'et', 'al.The', 'Christmas-time', 'setting', 'film', 'certainly', 'contributed', 'much', 'success', 'appeal', 'hometown', 'feel', 'setting', 'next-door', 'neighborly', 'nature', 'characters', 'story', 'stars', 'Stewart', 'Reed', 'others', 'make', 'film', 'timeless', 'classic.Is', 'film', 'sentimental', 'Certainly', 'watchable', 'Definitely', 'Should', 'own', 'Absolutely.5', 'only', 'highest', 'rating', 'possible.Buy', 'video', 'side', 'note', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'biologist', 'Stephen', 'Jay', 'Gould', 'wrote', 'book', 'titled', 'quot', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'taken', 'title', 'film', 'premis', 'similar', 'one', 'movie', 'theme', 'contingency', 'evolution', 'life', 'quot', 'what-if', 'quot', 'question', 'What', 'example', 'one', 'group', 'animal', 'ancestors', 'had', 'turned', 'right', 'instead', 'left', 'was', 'killed', 'left', 'offspring', 'then', 'what', 'interesting', 'read', 'life', 'Burgess', 'Shale', 'Cambrian', 'animal', 'fauna', 'interesting', 'give', 'look', 'quite', 'readable.Alan', 'Holyoak']",N/A

There are only a few films I can think of right now than manage to swell up the feeling of emotion that this film does. I think it's actually safe to say that nearly every single person has seen this movie at least once in their lifetime, and with that, I feel there is no need for me to go into detail about the plot. All I want to say is that, if there ever was a time for families to sit down and enjoy this film, now is the time. I've always come away with something whenever I've watched this film. It makes me think more about my family and loved-ones, and how at times I may avoid them, or say harsh things. &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;, after now, just over 50 years, still has the power to do that to me! If that alone is not enough to call this a great film, well, then there's James Stewart's performances. How at the time of release this film did not manage to sweep the Oscars is beyond. If Stewart doesn't get you to pull for him by the very end of the film, then I'm just the biggest fool walking around. You actually honestly start to care not only about him, but his family as well. If someone can tell me, they don't get a little misty at the end, when everyone comes to George Bailey's house with the money the town has collected, then you just have no heart.

39524,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0782002064,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","`It's a Wonderful Life' is one of those movies that could easily have fallen victim to its own popularity.  Rendered as one of the greatest American films, `It's a Wonderful Life' has a lot to live up to, and with all that hype comes, at times, major disappointment.  The nice thing about `It's a Wonderful Life' is that it actually lives up to the hype, and then some.  Not only is it one of the most heartwarming films I've ever had the privilege of seeing (sure, it may not seem it at times, but just wait) but it is also one of the smartest and most intelligent films to come along.The film tells the story of George Bailey, your typical `nice' guy with big dreams that finds himself shortchanged by everyday happenstance until he's married with children, still living in the same small town he wanted so badly to escape from and working a job he never anticipated or desired.  It's not that George is unhappy it's just that he is less than satisfied.  As events unfold within his life that press firmly upon him to where he starts to feel trapped George contemplates the unfathomable.Suicide.The film somewhat starts at this point; with an angel being sent down to save George from himself in an attempt to gain his wings.  What follows is a beautiful look at a life lived to the full despite not being lived as fully as one would have hoped, and then we get a glimpse at what life would have been like had George never lived at all, and while the results are a tad on the extreme side they help us to appreciate that each and everyone of us play a large part in the lives of everyone we touch.  It's a beautiful and sincere message that resonates with everyone and touches every soul.If you walk away from `It's a Wonderful Life' unmoved then you must have ice in your veins.Some pass this movie over expecting it to be nothing more than a Christmas film, but Christmas is the smallest part of this film.  Yes, it is used around the holidays to fill the heart with gladness and express the wonderment of children and family and friends and blessings but those emotions and that message is much farther reaching than a single yearly event.The film is bolstered along by some beautiful performances, especially from James Stewart (who has never been one of my favorite actors).  He delivers such a powerfully moving and real portrayal of a man who doesn't fully understand all that he has until he is faced with the prospect of never having it at all.  His transformation from a man down and out and unsatisfied to a man striving to retain all that he fears he has lost is amazing and utterly convincing.  This is the type of performance that moves people to tears.  I was also impressed with Lionel Barrymore who portrays Henry F. Potter (the Scrooge in this tale) with such devilish intrigue.  He is the perfect villain to Stewart's worn soul.  This is the type of villain you love to hate.In the end I must urge everyone to watch this movie, not once, not twice but over and over again.  Don't limit yourself to that one time of year to enjoy this wonderful movie but indulge yourself with one of the most beautifully complete tales of love, life and the American dream ever made.",5,This movie is beyond wonderful...,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,3187,"['Wonderful', 'Life', 'one', 'movies', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'fallen', 'victim', 'own', 'popularity', 'Rendered', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'films', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'times', 'major', 'disappointment', 'nice', 'thing', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'actually', 'up', 'hype', 'then', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'most', 'heartwarming', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'sure', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'times', 'just', 'wait', 'also', 'one', 'smartest', 'most', 'intelligent', 'films', 'come', 'along.The', 'film', 'story', 'George', 'Bailey', 'typical', 'nice', 'guy', 'big', 'dreams', 'shortchanged', 'everyday', 'happenstance', 'married', 'children', 'still', 'living', 'same', 'small', 'town', 'wanted', 'so', 'badly', 'escape', 'working', 'job', 'never', 'anticipated', 'desired', 'not', 'George', 'unhappy', 'just', 'less', 'satisfied', 'events', 'unfold', 'life', 'press', 'firmly', 'where', 'feel', 'trapped', 'George', 'unfathomable.Suicide.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'point', 'angel', 'being', 'sent', 'down', 'save', 'George', 'attempt', 'gain', 'wings', 'What', 'beautiful', 'look', 'life', 'lived', 'full', 'not', 'being', 'lived', 'as', 'fully', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'then', 'get', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'George', 'never', 'lived', 'results', 'are', 'tad', 'extreme', 'side', 'help', 'appreciate', 'everyone', 'play', 'large', 'part', 'lives', 'everyone', 'touch', 'beautiful', 'sincere', 'message', 'everyone', 'touches', 'soul.If', 'walk', 'away', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'unmoved', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'ice', 'veins.Some', 'pass', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'Christmas', 'film', 'Christmas', 'smallest', 'part', 'film', 'Yes', 'used', 'holidays', 'fill', 'heart', 'gladness', 'express', 'wonderment', 'children', 'family', 'friends', 'blessings', 'emotions', 'message', 'much', 'farther', 'reaching', 'single', 'yearly', 'event.The', 'film', 'bolstered', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'especially', 'James', 'Stewart', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'real', 'portrayal', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'faced', 'prospect', 'never', 'having', 'transformation', 'man', 'down', 'unsatisfied', 'man', 'striving', 'retain', 'lost', 'amazing', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'type', 'performance', 'people', 'tears', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'Henry', 'F.', 'Potter', 'Scrooge', 'tale', 'such', 'devilish', 'intrigue', 'perfect', 'villain', 'Stewart', 'worn', 'soul', 'type', 'villain', 'love', 'hate.In', 'end', 'must', 'urge', 'everyone', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'once', 'not', 'twice', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'Do', ""n't"", 'limit', 'one', 'time', 'year', 'enjoy', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'complete', 'tales', 'love', 'life', 'American', 'dream', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

Everyone has a reason for being here on this earth, and this movie is a perfect example to show why.George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) grew up in this American town, and did many things in his life that are very valuable to others (he saved his brother's life, he saved his father's banking company from a miser, he married his childhood sweetheart (played by Donna Reed), he saved his own boss from jail by refusing to give the poisioned pills to a customer, and more)...but George didn't realize that after he found out money was misplaced (really stolen by miser, Mr. Potter), and he was to go to jail. He tries to commit suicide but angel Clarence saves him, and showed him what life is like without George. George realized that the people he loves and likes don't recognize him (and his brother was dead because he wasn't there to save him), and wishes his life back, which it did happen after the cop asked him what's wrong. At the end, which really touched me, was the whole town comes in with money to help save George's banking company. The police decided not to arrest him, and it's a wonderful life for him again.

All three were investigated for possible Communist activities. Trumbo and Parker were both blacklisted. Odets avoided the same fate by cooperatively naming his ""fellow travelers.""SYNOPSIS--After a large sum of his customers' money is inadvertantly lost, businessman George Bailey (Stewart) attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river.

39532,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0782002064,Anthony Hinde,"[5, 6]","There seems to be some sort of conspiracy in Australia to keep this film a secret. It is clear to me that &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is regarded as the standard Christmas eve broadcasting in the US. It seems  that many Americans regard this film as worn out, in the same way as say  &quot;The sound of music&quot; has been, through too many viewings. To the  best of my knowledge it has only been broadcast once in the last ten years  in OZ, (I've been informed that's not strictly true, but why spoil the  story), and that time was not advertised. So perhaps I am in a better  position to judge the true worth of this film, not having been overexposed.  I regard it as one of my top ten of all time. The cast is fabulous. James  Stewart was perfect in his central role as George Bailey. Although I would  rate his performance in &quot;Mr. Smith goes to Washington&quot;, slightly  higher. The story is brilliant and the direction is immaculate.I  was lucky enough to get one of the 45th anniversary copies of the  re-mastered laser disc and it is a beautiful transfer. If you ever want to  add this film to your collection, this is the copy to get. If you are not  crying through at least half of this film, both in joy and anguish, then I  think there is something wrong with you. I certainly got more out of this  film than any rendition of Dickens', &quot;A Christmas Tale&quot;. After  all how many of us can empathize with a penny pinching self centered old  grouch versus a good man faced with letting his family and friends down.That is the basic story after all. George Bailey has been dealt a  savage blow and is contemplating suicide at his lowest ebb. It takes an  apprentice angel to put it all in perspective and remind him that joy in  life should never be eclipsed by any setback. Maybe those Americans out  there that have not taken the time to watch &quot;It's a Wonderful  Life&quot; in the last ten years should stop and try to recall the story.  If you can't, then you should make the time to give it another chance.

I think I'v seen it before only partial once in the past 20 years. I decited to watching the colorized version first. First I thought it would looks terrible like those ""Our Gang"" colored versions but hey.. it looks much better than I thought.Both versions looks on Blu-Ray beautiful restored.The story is heart-breaking and James Stewart is always great in his role but I think just a little bit to old (in my mind). But whatever, its a great Cast: Donna Mills, Gloria Grahaem, Beulah Bondi, Lionel Barrymore and the children (where still living): Carol Combs and Karolyn Grimes.TRIVIA:- in a very small role as Freddie Othello (Mary's annoying high school suitor): Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer  (yes, the one Alfalfa from ""Our Gang""!!!!).- Directors Trademark: The bird (Jimmy the raven) appeared since 1938 in each of Frank Capra's movies.- nice inside joke: when James Stewart is running trough the city and is wishing everyone a merry Christmas, we can see a shot of a theater marque advertising for The Bells of St. Mary's. Henry Travers, who plays Clarence, had co-starred in the film the previous year.The Music was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin but partial stock/archive material by Leigh Harline, Alfred Newman, Roy Webb was used for this movie.FAZIT: its a wonderful wonderful movie.

I can understand people complaining about this little trinket, it's nothing really speical. If your a fan if this film you'll remember the angel saying every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings. That's the reason, I believe, for the bell. The package is wrapped in soft, red fabric but it can easily be ruined but it does look nice.The movie itself is considered a classic. My only problem with the film is it told George's story very well and Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey did a great job. The movie took over an hour to tell the story of Bailey's life but the angel comes in and the story rushes along. The ending was magical to say the least but I wish they took more time to do the ending.The movie is well worth the price it's an American classic.

It is associated with the Christmas holidays and rightly so.  Yet the movie's story about a good man who is frustrated with his life to the point of suicide speaks as loudly today as it did in 1947.Some critics of &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; call it &quot;Capracorn&quot; (making reference to the movie's director, Frank Capra), and say that it is unrealistic sentiment, but I disagree.  The story basically shows how a man's life unfolds through a period of years in the town in which he was born.  What he thinks are disappointments and cruel tricks of fate actually lead him to the place he always wanted to be.  He is shown what the lives of his loved ones and friends would have been like had he never been born.  He realizes that those small acts of kindness and love that he has given to people were not insignificant, but made major differences in each and every life.Particularly moving is the scene where the protagonist, George Bailey, superbly played by Jimmy Stewart, prays a silent, but desparate prayer in the town bar.  The answer to that prayer gives George Bailey some unexpected twists and turns, but shows the fabric of his life is so carefully interwoven with those he loves and cares for.This is American filmaking at its very finest.

George is an ambitious young man who, due to extenuating circumstances, finds himself shackled to his deceased father's struggling Savings and Loan business.  George does good and honorable work, but he never realizes his personal dreams and vision of success.  Then when tragedy strikes on Christmas Eve he faces the biggest personal challenge of his life.This film, though a well-known holiday favorite today, was not a hit when it was released.  So, how did this film gain top-holiday movie status?  Do you remember a few decades ago when many of the cable TV stations were just getting off of the ground...TNT, USA, etc.?  If you recall, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" aired several times each holiday season for a number of years on a several different channels.  This happened because this film at that time had passed into the public domain.  So, these new cable TV stations could show it without having to pay any royalties!  It was free to them.When you combine that repeated pattern of showings until the copyright was renewed, with Frank Capra and a heartwarming Christmas story, people came to know and love this movie.I mean, what's not to love?  You have James Steward, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore headlining the show.  I have heard it said that casting Lionel Barrymore as the cantankerous miser, Mr. Potter, was pure genius.  If you look at his other roles he typically played warm, grandfatherly characters, but not in ""It's a Wonderful Life""!.The acting is great, and though the story line and characters have a strong Norman Rockewellian flavor, this film is well worth watching every Christmas season.5 stars for a fantastic Christmas classic!",5,"It wasn't a hit when it first came out, but it's a Christmas classic today",1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,1844,"['One', 'family', 'favorite', 'Christmas', 'traditions', 'watching', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'eating', 'rocky', 'road', 'candy.Just', 'everyone', 'story', 'George', 'Bailey', 'George', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'due', 'extenuating', 'circumstances', 'shackled', 'deceased', 'father', 'struggling', 'Savings', 'Loan', 'business', 'George', 'good', 'honorable', 'work', 'never', 'personal', 'dreams', 'vision', 'success', 'Then', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'biggest', 'personal', 'challenge', 'life.This', 'film', 'well-known', 'holiday', 'favorite', 'today', 'was', 'not', 'hit', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'So', 'how', 'did', 'film', 'gain', 'top-holiday', 'movie', 'status', 'Do', 'remember', 'few', 'decades', 'ago', 'when', 'many', 'cable', 'TV', 'stations', 'were', 'just', 'getting', 'ground', 'TNT', 'USA', 'etc.', 'recall', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'aired', 'several', 'times', 'holiday', 'season', 'number', 'years', 'several', 'different', 'channels', 'happened', 'film', 'time', 'had', 'passed', 'public', 'domain', 'So', 'new', 'cable', 'TV', 'stations', 'could', 'show', 'having', 'pay', 'royalties', 'was', 'free', 'them.When', 'combine', 'repeated', 'pattern', 'showings', 'copyright', 'was', 'renewed', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'heartwarming', 'Christmas', 'story', 'people', 'came', 'know', 'love', 'movie.I', 'mean', 'what', 'not', 'love', 'have', 'James', 'Steward', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'headlining', 'show', 'have', 'heard', 'said', 'casting', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'cantankerous', 'miser', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'was', 'pure', 'genius', 'look', 'other', 'roles', 'typically', 'played', 'warm', 'grandfatherly', 'characters', 'not', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '.The', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'have', 'strong', 'Norman', 'Rockewellian', 'flavor', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Christmas', 'season.5', 'stars', 'fantastic', 'Christmas', 'classic']",N/A

Once VCRs were invented, and then DVDs, people could have it in their homes whenever they wanted.Oh, yes, it's a unique movie, and very good in a lot of ways, but did you know that it was not a box office hit? It only became a big hit after it went into the public domain. So you love it in part because you associate it with Christmas traditions, and childhood and being happy.Certainly it's a wonderful life if you are George Bailey, but not many of us are. And Clarence's inscription in the book he leaves for George thanking him for his wings says no man is a failure as long as he had friends. But how many of us have a whole town (less the crabby old skinflint and his minions) to be our friends?Maybe I'm just being terribly cynical, but I'm not George Bailey, doing things to help people, being the reason they are able to buy a home, saving lives through quick thinking and action, like the little kid who would have been poisoned or his brother, who would have drowned.Clarence gave George a unique opportunity when he showed him what Bedford Falls would have been like if he had never been born. Wonder what would be different in this world if I had not been born. And maybe that was Frank Capra's point: not that we are all as lucky as George Bailey, but that we have all had an impact, small or large. For good or ill, the world really would be a different place if any one of us had never existed. I hope I am not flattering myself when I say that on the whole, the world is better off for having me in it.

Scribe ""trekviewer""","[1, 2]","With the possible exception of either 'The Wizard Of Oz' or 'The Sound Of Music' there isn't a movie in history that has had more genuine and lasting appeal than 'It's A Wonderful Life'.  Also recognized as director Frank Capra's masterpiece, better than fifty years past it's original release the film still garners new fans with every generation in spite of it's sometimes sticky sentimentality and outdated elements.  I have yet to meet anyone who can resist watching it during the Christmas holiday season at least once; I myself dust it off every Christmas Eve without fail and even watch it occasionally in between.'It's A Wonderful Life' nearly defies anyone to criticize it accomplishing another rare feat in cinema history.  Though director Capra stacks the deck emotionally forcing the tears to well up in our eyes, he keeps the film well balanced with equal moments of humor, memorable true to life characters and even a dreadful nightmarish sequence that culminates with Jimmy Stewart realizing that life is indeed wonderful (""I want to live!"").  Donna Reed and Stewart are the closest thing to perfection as a couple you are likely ever to see in a film; Capra's stock company of gifted and talented actors round out the rest of the cast.  Each of them has an opportunity to shine in both the comedic and the touching moments, though clearly the focus is on Stewart.  Perhaps the most memorable character in the film though is Henry Travers who portrays Clarence Goodbody (""Angel - Third Class."") Stewart's guardian angel; his warmth and charm offer a great contrast during the sequence of Bedford Falls without the benefit of George Bailey's lifeblood flowing through it.  Contrariwise, Lionel Barrymore as the despicable Mr. Potter is also unforgettable - he is the only character that remains unmoved and unchanged by George's predicament and resolution as is demonstrated in the terrific finale.It's hard to imagine this film being produced today and still manage to have all the qualities present here - just watch (and wince) at the 70's TV movie remake with Marlo Thomas if you doubt me.  All the schmaltz, sentiment and the genuine affection that the characters show for each other would be simply glossed over; in the conclusion Clarence leaves his copy of ""The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer"" for George signing it ""Love"", a scene that I doubt would make it into a movie being made today.  There are many good family and ""feel-good"" movies being made today but they don't begin to compare with this venerable holiday classic.  Here's hoping that Hollywood won't get itchy to do another remake!Worth noting: in the scene where we are first introduced to Bert the cop and Ernie the cab driver the newspaper one of them is reading has a headline that blares SMITH WINS NOMINATION!; I assume this is a sly reference to the earlier Capra and Stewart movie 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington'.",5,The 'Capra-corn' was never better than it is here,1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,2899,"['possible', 'exception', 'Wizard', 'Oz', ""'The"", 'Sound', 'Music', ""n't"", 'movie', 'history', 'had', 'more', 'genuine', 'lasting', 'appeal', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Also', 'recognized', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'masterpiece', 'better', 'fifty', 'years', 'original', 'release', 'film', 'still', 'new', 'fans', 'generation', 'spite', 'sometimes', 'sticky', 'sentimentality', 'outdated', 'elements', 'have', 'yet', 'meet', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'resist', 'watching', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'season', 'least', 'once', 'dust', 'off', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'fail', 'even', 'watch', 'occasionally', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'nearly', 'defies', 'anyone', 'criticize', 'accomplishing', 'rare', 'feat', 'cinema', 'history', 'Though', 'director', 'Capra', 'deck', 'emotionally', 'forcing', 'tears', 'well', 'up', 'eyes', 'film', 'well', 'balanced', 'equal', 'moments', 'humor', 'memorable', 'true', 'life', 'characters', 'even', 'dreadful', 'nightmarish', 'sequence', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'realizing', 'life', 'indeed', 'wonderful', 'want', 'live', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Stewart', 'are', 'closest', 'thing', 'perfection', 'couple', 'are', 'likely', 'ever', 'see', 'film', 'Capra', 'stock', 'company', 'gifted', 'talented', 'actors', 'round', 'out', 'rest', 'cast', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'comedic', 'touching', 'moments', 'clearly', 'focus', 'Stewart', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'film', 'though', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'who', 'Clarence', 'Goodbody', 'Angel', 'Third', 'Class', 'Stewart', 'guardian', 'angel', 'warmth', 'charm', 'offer', 'great', 'contrast', 'sequence', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'benefit', 'George', 'Bailey', 'lifeblood', 'flowing', 'Contrariwise', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'despicable', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'also', 'unforgettable', 'only', 'character', 'unmoved', 'unchanged', 'George', 'predicament', 'resolution', 'demonstrated', 'terrific', 'finale.It', 'hard', 'imagine', 'film', 'being', 'produced', 'today', 'still', 'manage', 'have', 'qualities', 'present', 'here', 'just', 'watch', 'wince', '70', 'TV', 'movie', 'remake', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'doubt', 'schmaltz', 'sentiment', 'genuine', 'affection', 'characters', 'show', 'other', 'would', 'be', 'simply', 'glossed', 'over', 'conclusion', 'Clarence', 'copy', 'Adventures', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'George', 'signing', 'Love', 'scene', 'doubt', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'being', 'made', 'today', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'family', 'feel-good', 'movies', 'being', 'made', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'begin', 'compare', 'venerable', 'holiday', 'classic', 'Here', 'hoping', 'Hollywood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'itchy', 'do', 'remake', 'Worth', 'noting', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'Bert', 'cop', 'Ernie', 'cab', 'newspaper', 'one', 'reading', 'headline', 'SMITH', 'WINS', 'NOMINATION', 'assume', 'sly', 'reference', 'earlier', 'Capra', 'Stewart', 'movie', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington']",N/A

I guess I was under the assumption such an old movie is no longer relevant in todays world, but it actually is.It took a while for the storyline to get to the segments I REALLY had the greatest admiration for, such as when James Stewart's character was forced to learn an important lesson about respecting people (and subsequently taken to a time when nobody even knew who he was because he never existed- you'll understand this segment when you see it) *this* is when the storyline really kicked in for me.It was a lot of fun watching James Stewart's character communicate with people he knew really well around town, however, none of those people knew him at all thanks to an angel taking him to a world where he was never even created.  It was both emotional and exciting wondering what would happen next thanks to James Stewart's reactions and facial expressions.I really liked James Stewart's character too. He really disrespected his family for a while there, but by being shown the way of life, he learned to treat everyone around town with respect and consideration.The entire storyline is really good so I honestly feel really bad for originally skipping over the movie so many times simply because of its age.

George isn't a born loser as some have suggested, this movie shows us through George, how many people one man or one person really can effect. IT IS GEORGE WHO HAS TO LEARN THE LESSON, he has to watch his brother become a war hero. His highschool friends go off and become sucessful business men and women, while all of his plans are put on hold so he can run the ""Baily building and loan"" even after he gets married and has a couple of kids, he still doesn't feel like he's accomplishing anything in life. This all comes to ahead when his uncle misplaces eight thousand dollars, which is now in Potter's hands. George goes home, and it's the straw that broke the camel's back. He goes crazy, and runs out of the house. Eventually he finds himself at the bridge outside of town, contemplating suicide. When his guardian angel shows up, causing George to jump in and rescue him, while they're in the rescue station, George states that he wishes he'd never been born, because in his mind as he states. Everybody would've been much happier, the angel grants his wish. And George gets to see how things would been around town, without him, His brother would be dead, since he wasn't there to save him from falling in the frozen pond. Mary never got married, and became and old maid, and Potter controls everything. No Bailey building and loan, George ends back at the bridge and wishes that he had been born. Which is granted to him, George is now resigned to the fact that yes he can make a difference. He even expects to go to jail over the lost eight thousand dollars, but Mary has been praying for him. And has gone out to talk to friends, and at the end the money is raised. This movie shows that what you do in life, no matter how small. Is important, and you impact more people than you realize. Even if you think you don't, George's problem was that he saw wasn't doing, or didn't have.

Jimmy Stewart is quite incredible in this movie. If you ever thought classical actors couldn't rival method actors, see how genuine Stewart's performance is. Two special moments: Stewart's tears as he sits in martinis, and the scene where Mary and George both listen to the same telephone receiver. Its such a magical scene - one of the best scenes of all time. Neither of them listen to what Sam Wainwright is saying on the phone, because all of a sudden the two of them realise they are standing the closest they've been together in twenty or so years. He can smell her hair and she can smell his aftershave. The scene is played out in expressions and movements, and you can read their thoughts on their faces. A joy.This movie does a difficult thing, something we love to be reminded of each christmas, it makes you appreciate the important things in life. Its about falling back in love with life. Frank Capra was a master director. Not only are his movies brilliantly realised, perfectly shot and constructed, but they contain just enough awfulness to ensure that the endings do not seem corny - their positive messages do not seem contrived - they are a joy and a relief. Frank Capra doesn't pretend the world is a perfect place, but he does something many filmmakers can't - he actually provides answers as to how best to deal with the world's imperfect nature.

It was given an extra boost due to the fact that through inattention, the copyright ran out! When TV stations realized they could show it with no royalties due, it became a popular item in their schedules. Movie fans, with a second chance to appreciate this film, found that they liked it after all. Once you understand that George Bailey's life is full and rich, even if it never followed the course he himself had imagined for it, you understand that the movie isn't depressing at all. No matter how many times I view ""It's a Wonderful Life"", I still get a little choked up at the end.This was Jimmy Stewart's first film role after serving in, literally, heroic fashion as a bomber commander during World War II. Despite being a star and subject to assignment in ""morale roles"" if he had so chosen, Stewart went into the Air Corp and flew a complete tour of 25 bomber missions. He also flew a number of other live missions that were tallied as flights where he trained air crews. When offered the chance to have those missions count against his tour of 25, he declined. If you know anything about the history of WWII, you know that bomber crew duty in the European theater was pretty much the most dangerous combat assignment in the war.This DVD presentation is extremely well done. Whether from a clean print or a masterful restoration (or a combination of the two), the movie is free of artifacts of the type you find in old film prints or a rushed digital transfer. When you compare the actual film to scenes shown as examples in the two included documentaries, you can see what I mean.And mentioning the two documentaries, they are very satisfying. One is hosted by Frank Capra Jr., the son of the famous director of the film. He narrates interesting facts about his father and this film in particular in a warm tone that makes you feel part of the process. The second feature is hosted by Tom Bosley (the father on ""Happy Days""). That documentary is, I believe, somewhat longer. It goes into some of the casting choices that could have been made, which I always find interesting. Both have tidbits of history and trivia about the film that are anywhere from interesting to fascinating ... including an explanation of how the film was actually shot during a record heat wave!""It's a Wonderful Life"" has become arguably the top Christmas classic, in part due to its heavy exposure on TV, and in part because the film is so good it holds up under that heavy exposure very well.

Thus spoke Clarence, angel - second class, to the suicidal George Bailey, owner and manager of the local, recently bankrupt ""Building & Loan Co."" in Bedford Falls, somewhere U.S.A.Of course George doesn't believe this silly, little old man is really an angel, nor does he believe his wish to ""never have been born"" has just been granted. However the reality of the situation is soon to set in when he discovers that no one in Bedford Falls has ever heard of George Bailey. Not only is he viewed as a stranger in town, but the town itself is nothing like it was before he met Clarence. In fact it's no longer 'Bedford Falls.' It's 'Pottersville.'Yes, George finally comes to realize that Clarence is right, a life is a terrible thing to throw any. We are all connected to each other in ways we could never imagine, nor fully comprehend. The absence of just one life may have devastating consequences on others.Has George learned his lesson? Can an angel - second class, reverse the wish and restore George back to his family and friends in time for Christmas? And lastly, has Clarence finally earned his wings?

39572,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,0782002064,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 2]","The quintessential holiday Christmas classic, It's A Wonderful Life has dominated the seasonal television landscape with its story of love, friendship, and one man's exceedingly relevant life. Filmed in 1946, this Frank Capra masterpiece opened in theaters to a lukewarm reception, but quickly rose in stature following repeated annual television airings in the 1960s to present day. The film is centered around the life of George Bailey - a likeable, ambitious resident of Bedford Falls who harbors dreams of grandeur, but begins to question the meaning of his life when things don't work out according to his plan.When the story begins, George is a young boy employed by Mr. Gower, the neighborhood druggist. Mr. Gower, having just received news of his son's death - and engaged in the act of getting drunk - inadvertently places poison in a medicine bottle. George discovers the mistake and doesn't deliver the medicine, thus averting a major disaster. The opening scenes also show George saving his brother from certain death by pulling him out of a frozen pond where the ice had broken.From there, the story jumps several years into the future, where a grown up George harbors dreams of world travel, exploration, and the construction of large buildings. But he ends up staying in Bedford Falls to work for his father's business, a small savings & loan (and the only financial institution in Bedford Falls not owned by the miserly Mr. Potter). Eventually, George falls in love with childhood friend Mary and the two wed, choosing to renovate an old house in Bedford Falls.When the Great Depression strikes, George uses his own money, ingenuity, and personal demeanor to stave off a bank run that threatens to close down the family business. In so doing, George keeps Mr. Potter from using his numerous resources to force a takeover bid of Bailey Savings & Loan. Thus, he saves the town's residents from being subjected to a Potter monopoly with possibly disastrous consequences. Along the way, George is tempted with offers of riches and travel by Mr. Potter, but he turns him down - opting instead to work for the benefit of the community.Things seem to be going well for George until his Uncle Billy absentmindedly leaves the daily deposit of the business in a newspaper that he throws in Mr. Potter's lap (while boasting about the military honors bestowed on George's brother). While George and Uncle Billy frantically search for the misplaced $8,000, Mr. Potter sees his opportunity to ruin the Bailey Savings & Loan once and for all. When George appeals to Potter for help, Potter threatens to call the authorities.Disillusioned, George leaves Potter's office and wanders into the night. After leaving the local bar, he runs his car into a tree and then walks over to a nearby bridge. While on the bridge, George contemplates suicide as a way out. But before he can commit the act, a man falls into the water below. George jumps in to save him, and later finds out that the man's name is Clarence. Clarence claims to be angel working to get his wings. He jumped into the water to save George, and when George wishes he had never been born - Clarence aims to show George exactly what the world would be like had he never been born...What he sees leads George to believe that his life was more than worth living. He decides to return home to his wife and children and face the consequences of the misplaced money. When he returns home, he finds that people from all over Bedford Falls have come to donate their own money to bail out their good friend George and the community fixture, Bailey Savings & Loan. Clarence receives his wings, and George Bailey is thankful for his numerous blessings.It's A Wonderful Life is almost magical in its idyllic portrayal of Depression-era, small-town America. The characters (with the exception of Mr. Potter), harkens back to a simpler time when public attitudes toward morality prevailed, where neighbors knew each other by name, and where communities helped each other out. In addition, George Bailey and his friends are likeable people, developing a rapport with the audience that makes the viewer actively root for them and care about what happens to them. This personal connection with the audience (and the audience ability to relate to questioning the meaning of one's life) may well be the key to the enduring success of the story.

39573,A3JPFWKS83R49V,0782002064,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[2, 2]","It's a Wonderful Life is a movie that is synonymous with the Christmas season. This classic film from director Frank Capra is still as heartwarming today as it was decades ago when it was first released and it continues to charm more and more generations each and every holiday season.This movie works on every level, thanks to the story line, the directing, and the actors and actresses involved. Actor Jimmy Stewart plays the likable yet frustrated George Bailey, showing how one man can have it all and almost let it all slip away. Henry Travers plays the role of Clarence, George's guardian angel, and his appearance fits the part perfectly. The same is true of actor Lionel Barrymore in the role as the nasty Mr. Potter. With his evil smile and mean- spirited demeanor, Barrymore fits the role of the greedy CEO to a tee.Capra's directing is the key to making this movie work and it's doubtful that many others would have been able to duplicate his work. The plot of this movie would seem a little silly at first: man works hard, starts to feel down and out, loses track of a large sum of money, feels he is no longer appreciated, tries to commit suicide, and is rescued by a man who claims to be his guardian angel and takes him back in time to see what life would have been like if he had never been born. But Capra pulls all the elements together and creates a cinematic masterpiece.This movie is considered by many to be one of the greatest of all time. It certainly is a movie worth watching, during Christmas or anytime of the year. It's message is timeless, and it will continue to win over more and more fans with each passing year.",5,Holiday Movie Wacthing at its Finest,1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,1645,"['Wonderful', 'Life', 'movie', 'synonymous', 'Christmas', 'season', 'classic', 'film', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'still', 'heartwarming', 'today', 'was', 'decades', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'charm', 'more', 'more', 'generations', 'holiday', 'season.This', 'movie', 'works', 'level', 'thanks', 'story', 'line', 'directing', 'actors', 'actresses', 'involved', 'Actor', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'likable', 'yet', 'frustrated', 'George', 'Bailey', 'showing', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'have', 'almost', 'let', 'away', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'role', 'Clarence', 'George', 'guardian', 'angel', 'appearance', 'part', 'perfectly', 'same', 'true', 'actor', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'role', 'nasty', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'evil', 'smile', 'mean-', 'spirited', 'demeanor', 'Barrymore', 'role', 'greedy', 'CEO', 'tee.Capra', 'directing', 'key', 'making', 'movie', 'work', 'doubtful', 'many', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'duplicate', 'work', 'plot', 'movie', 'would', 'seem', 'little', 'silly', 'first', 'man', 'hard', 'feel', 'down', 'out', 'track', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'feels', 'no', 'longer', 'appreciated', 'tries', 'commit', 'suicide', 'rescued', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'guardian', 'angel', 'back', 'time', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'Capra', 'elements', 'together', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece.This', 'movie', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'time', 'certainly', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Christmas', 'anytime', 'year', 'message', 'timeless', 'will', 'continue', 'win', 'more', 'more', 'fans', 'passing', 'year']",N/A

39592,A1ASCECH3KOZ3P,0782002064,C. Gardner,"[5, 6]","Any film that can make the callous break into tears is as close as we can come to an ""objective"" work of art. This is such a work as that; it affects people in the same basic way, moreover the way in which the creator(s) intended, and must be watched straight through from the beginning for this full effect to occur. Anyone can identify with George Bailey's yearning to be somebody important, to be recognized, to move to a better place (if not physically, then spiritually). This is the key. But at the heart of this magic film is a complex of philosophical ideas, which work by asking the viewer to imagine themselves as being in George's position. A simple yet seemingly unanswerable question: Would the world be a better place, or a worse place, had you not been born? The answer structurally turns on a tenet of chaos theory, namely, that small changes have enormous unforeseeable consequences over time. The actions of each living being eventually affects the entire universe. And this is true for every one of us.The second idea is that you are not simply a part of the whole and thus alone, but that you are, in your entirety, your living relations with other people.

I had a nagging sense that with the ending Frank Capra was trying to keep me in line, making sure I keep treating people with respect and all that nonsense.  And he fully expects me to do so knowing that I know it is not in my best interest. In fact he spends the first  of the film telling me that to be unselfish in a selfish world will lead to my demise.  But I already knew that.  Still, myself and millions of others watch this film, every year, fooling ourselves into thinking that our kindness will be rewarded.  Self-delusions are not the only reason I will recommend this film.  James Stewart is, as always, worth the price of admission.  The script is very smart and witty, and there is no way to deny the charm of these characters.  You will fall in love with George Bailey as his hopes and dreams are put on hold while he prevents his town from selling out to The Man.  I also got a big kick out of watching Bert and Ernie hanging out together.  We, as Americans, love to cheer George Bailey for choosing humanity over money.

Looking back as a child this world was the ""real"" America or at least the way we all thought and felt it should be.I remember seeing this film at the young age of six or seven, in my pyjamas sprawled in front of the black and white TV set with my two younger sisters, though it was in the middle of July, before it became a ""Christmas Tradition"", the entire family sat attentive, watching George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) grow and become something of the true ""good"" man: sensitive, loving, caring and loyal.Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) is simply stunning and so innocent, beautiful and loved George with all her heart.George and Mary's wedding night is so Irish, small town, simple and lovely to watch as they come to terms with that broken-down ""house"" which had become a symbol of their respective dreams. Even as a small child, the old guy outside their window on their wedding night, singing lyrics of love felt to me to be true. We loved these two people because they were really in love and at bottom, we all want that love.Love becomes reality when the children arrive and making a living, a family, is important.George Bailey had always dreams of travelling the world. Even to the end, he kept old ""tourist"" pamphlets and books of far away places but something, people and basic life obligations always somehow prevented that dream.The villain of the film is Mr. Potter, (Lionel Barrymore) a Dickensian-like character, a true Capitalist without heart, pushed hard to turn Bedford Falls into a ""Las Vegas"", though it was little George Bailey, caring and deeply aware of the ""worker"" the ""little man"" who staved the ugly and evil Mr. Potter off from attaining his selfish goals.How this turn in the plot occurs, however, is pure fantasy, because as George Bailey stresses, having lost money ( by the stupidity of Uncle Billy) owed to the tyrant, is about to do a willing free-fall into the river, Clarence, an apprentice angel, prevents George from his self-destructive action, and talks Bailey into trying life again. The way the angel does this is true wisdom combined with loving magic.How would life be if you had never been born?Clarence the bumbling angel takes George through Bedford as though he never existed. George discovers that his life did have an affect on the town and the many lives he would have come in contact with. In a few words, without George, Bedford did indeed become a ""Las Vegas"" and his friends, particularly Mary, were lost.George comes back to reality and the entire community give back to George who has done so much for them, (the money Uncle Billy had lost) on Christmas Eve.A little bell rings which signifies an angel has moved up and finally attained their ""wings"". As an angel, Clarence, has turned a good man from self destruction, and now can move upward...and fly.This Frank Capra film written by Philip Van Doren Stern (story) and Francis Goodrich, et al., has somehow taught us that giving is one of the truest virtues of them all.A splendid film.",5,More than an Icon of American Film,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,3129,"['Frank', 'Capra', 'film', 'imagination', 'ideal', 'sentimental', 'outlook', 'post', 'WW2', 'America', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'small', 'town', 'American', 'dream', 'Looking', 'back', 'child', 'world', 'was', 'real', 'America', 'least', 'way', 'thought', 'felt', 'should', 'be.I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'young', 'age', 'six', 'seven', 'pyjamas', 'sprawled', 'front', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'set', 'two', 'younger', 'sisters', 'was', 'middle', 'July', 'became', 'Christmas', 'Tradition', 'entire', 'family', 'sat', 'attentive', 'watching', 'George', 'Bailey', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'grow', 'become', 'something', 'true', 'good', 'man', 'sensitive', 'loving', 'caring', 'loyal.Mary', 'Hatch', 'Bailey', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'simply', 'stunning', 'so', 'innocent', 'beautiful', 'loved', 'George', 'heart.George', 'Mary', 'wedding', 'night', 'so', 'Irish', 'small', 'town', 'simple', 'lovely', 'watch', 'come', 'terms', 'broken-down', 'house', 'had', 'become', 'symbol', 'respective', 'dreams', 'Even', 'small', 'child', 'old', 'guy', 'window', 'wedding', 'night', 'singing', 'lyrics', 'love', 'felt', 'be', 'true', 'loved', 'two', 'people', 'were', 'really', 'love', 'bottom', 'want', 'love.Love', 'becomes', 'reality', 'when', 'children', 'arrive', 'making', 'living', 'family', 'important.George', 'Bailey', 'had', 'always', 'dreams', 'travelling', 'world', 'Even', 'end', 'kept', 'old', 'tourist', 'pamphlets', 'books', 'far', 'away', 'places', 'something', 'people', 'basic', 'life', 'obligations', 'always', 'somehow', 'prevented', 'dream.The', 'villain', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Dickensian-like', 'character', 'true', 'Capitalist', 'heart', 'pushed', 'hard', 'turn', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'was', 'little', 'George', 'Bailey', 'caring', 'deeply', 'aware', 'worker', 'little', 'man', 'who', 'staved', 'ugly', 'evil', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'attaining', 'selfish', 'goals.How', 'turn', 'plot', 'however', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'George', 'Bailey', 'stresses', 'having', 'lost', 'money', 'stupidity', 'Uncle', 'Billy', 'owed', 'tyrant', 'do', 'willing', 'free-fall', 'river', 'Clarence', 'apprentice', 'angel', 'prevents', 'George', 'self-destructive', 'action', 'talks', 'Bailey', 'trying', 'life', 'again', 'way', 'angel', 'true', 'wisdom', 'combined', 'loving', 'magic.How', 'would', 'life', 'be', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'Clarence', 'bumbling', 'angel', 'George', 'through', 'Bedford', 'never', 'existed', 'George', 'life', 'did', 'have', 'affect', 'town', 'many', 'lives', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'contact', 'few', 'words', 'George', 'Bedford', 'did', 'indeed', 'become', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'friends', 'particularly', 'Mary', 'were', 'lost.George', 'back', 'reality', 'entire', 'community', 'give', 'back', 'George', 'who', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'Uncle', 'Billy', 'had', 'lost', 'Christmas', 'Eve.A', 'little', 'bell', 'rings', 'angel', 'moved', 'up', 'finally', 'attained', 'wings', 'angel', 'Clarence', 'turned', 'good', 'man', 'self', 'destruction', 'now', 'can', 'move', 'upward', 'fly.This', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'film', 'written', 'Philip', 'Van', 'Doren', 'Stern', 'story', 'Francis', 'Goodrich', 'et', 'al.', 'somehow', 'taught', 'giving', 'one', 'truest', 'virtues', 'all.A', 'splendid', 'film']",N/A

Have we had an impact? After all, whether it's leaving behind descendants, works of art, discoveries, or just our name, we all want some recognition, that we mattered, or at least were here. It helps define our sojourn, and allow us to extrapolate meaning from a cosmos which is random, indifferent, and so large and eternal as to defy the meager human ability to fully comprehend. With that as a base desire, the film then goes nearly two hours showing us a life that has many tangents with ours- be you an American, Mongolian, or Zulu. We see the effect George has had, even if he does not, and know what can only await him when Clarence pulls out his life's rug from under his feet- if not the particulars, certainly the general effects, which can only be negative. Yes, George may be more involved with others than the typical person, but we are all connected, however peripherally. This film does a better job than any other film in espousing the notion of The Butterfly Effect, even more so than the recent film of that name. We all see ourselves in George Bailey, for the film does not focus on George's mere home nor business lives, but all the important moments they bound, and even fail to contain. We can easily extrapolate ourselves into his position, especially at his moment of crisis, when he literally, as Potter taunts, is worth more dead than alive- at least on a material level.... This toweringly great film is all about corralling the material instincts and aspects of the world, and using them for the right reasons, while appreciating the values that lie beneath those instincts. The cynics, dummies, and willful misreaders of this film be damned! It is not corny, cheesy, hokey, nor a mere feel good tearjerker, like its many inferior copycats are. Too often the commercials or excerpts that are shown damage the overall film's perception, for it's a synergistic film, whose whole far surpasses its parts. It is great art, period. It is defensible not only on an emotional level, but on intellectual and artistic levels. It is also testament to the fact that great art always rises to the surface, even if bad critics pummel it. This has an extra resonance for me and those who produce excellence with no immediate reward nor recognition. But, even without that, It's A Wonderful Life deserves its plaudits, and your viewership.",5,Masterpiece,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,2463,"['center', 'film', 'have', 'wondered', 'would', 'world', 'be', 'were', 'never', 'born', 'Have', 'had', 'impact', 'leaving', 'descendants', 'works', 'art', 'discoveries', 'just', 'name', 'want', 'recognition', 'mattered', 'least', 'were', 'here', 'define', 'sojourn', 'allow', 'extrapolate', 'meaning', 'cosmos', 'random', 'indifferent', 'so', 'large', 'eternal', 'defy', 'meager', 'human', 'ability', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'base', 'desire', 'film', 'then', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'showing', 'life', 'many', 'tangents', 'ours-', 'be', 'American', 'Mongolian', 'Zulu', 'see', 'effect', 'George', 'had', 'even', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'await', 'when', 'Clarence', 'out', 'life', 'rug', 'feet-', 'not', 'particulars', 'certainly', 'general', 'effects', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'negative', 'Yes', 'George', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'involved', 'others', 'typical', 'person', 'are', 'connected', 'however', 'peripherally', 'film', 'better', 'job', 'other', 'film', 'espousing', 'notion', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'recent', 'film', 'name', 'see', 'ourselves', 'George', 'Bailey', 'film', 'not', 'focus', 'George', 'mere', 'home', 'business', 'lives', 'important', 'moments', 'bound', 'even', 'fail', 'contain', 'can', 'easily', 'extrapolate', 'position', 'especially', 'moment', 'crisis', 'when', 'literally', 'Potter', 'taunts', 'more', 'dead', 'alive-', 'least', 'material', 'level', 'toweringly', 'great', 'film', 'corralling', 'material', 'instincts', 'aspects', 'world', 'using', 'right', 'reasons', 'appreciating', 'values', 'lie', 'instincts', 'cynics', 'dummies', 'willful', 'misreaders', 'film', 'be', 'damned', 'not', 'corny', 'cheesy', 'hokey', 'mere', 'feel', 'good', 'tearjerker', 'many', 'inferior', 'copycats', 'are', 'Too', 'often', 'commercials', 'excerpts', 'are', 'shown', 'damage', 'overall', 'film', 'perception', 'synergistic', 'film', 'whole', 'far', 'parts', 'great', 'art', 'period', 'defensible', 'not', 'only', 'emotional', 'level', 'intellectual', 'artistic', 'levels', 'also', 'testament', 'fact', 'great', 'art', 'always', 'surface', 'even', 'bad', 'critics', 'pummel', 'extra', 'resonance', 'who', 'produce', 'excellence', 'immediate', 'reward', 'recognition', 'even', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'plaudits', 'viewership']",N/A
39612,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,0782002064,Craig MACKINNON,"[5, 5]","Everyone has their films that they must watch during certain holidays.  For some reason, at my house we always watched ""Uncle Buck"" on Labour Day weekend.  Likewise, Roger Ebert apparently watches ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" every Thanksgiving.  My wife likes to watch ""When Harry Met Sally"" on New Year's Day.  But Christmas is the time most saturated with films that the season wouldn't be the same without.  ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""White Christmas,"" and some version of ""The Grinch"" are holiday necessities for many people.  My personal favourite of all these films is Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life.""Because the airwaves are saturated with it (because the copyright was not renewed when it expired in the '70's) it's easy to flip by and watch bits until a commercial comes on.  People who have only seen the film this way are missing the joy of the film - it is a finely-crafted vision of a town, the progress of years of the characters in that town, and the steady wearing down of one man's dreams until one Christmas Eve he decides to take his own life.  What he hasn't noticed is all the good he done, and he's momentarily forgotten how much he is loved - by his extended family, by the people in the town touched by his basic goodness.  He is not a Scrooge or Grinch remarkably transformed by the meaning of Christmas, but a good man worn down and worn out that is then rejuvenated by the Spirit of Christmas.Capra and Jimmy Stewart evoke such a sense of place and timing that you can't help by be immersed in the story.  The extended cast weaves in and out of the story, without intruding on the primary narrative.  It's suitable for all ages - in 1947, the MPAA didn't allow anything questionable through - but I suspect that younger viewers will grow bored since the film is mostly dialogue and ""grown-up"" events.This DVD edition looks very good.  The sound is okay, but as usual, the visuals were cleaned up much more than the sound.  There are a couple short (20 minutes) making-of featurettes, one of which is the same as on the VHS edition that came out many years ago (with Tom Bosley as host).  But the main reason to buy the DVD is so you don't have to sit through the ads and suffer the cuts television stations make to cut down the running time.

39630,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,0782002064,David E. Levine,"[5, 6]","When I was young, this movie was often shown on local television stations around Christmas time and the TV Guide listing described it s &quot;a poignant slice of Americana.&quot; That description is the best one phrase encapsulization I have ever seen. Back when I was young, however, this movie was not considered the wonderful classic it is now recognized to be. Back then, the local stations used this movie as inexpensive holiday filler. Fortunately, the world has come to appreciate what a gem this Capra classic is. There are so many wonderful scenes of small town Amrica from the roaring twenties to World War 2.The movie is filled with personal tension. Gerorge Baily is a small town boy who grows up with a desire for a college education and the opportunity to see the world. He wants to be an engineer and build bridges. The tension comes in his devotion to duty ... to carry on the family business when his father dies unexpectedly. George (played by James Stewart) compassionately keeps the struggling savings and loan going through the depression. However, he ultimately feels like a failure and when he has reached the end of his rope, he is given the opportunity to see how many lives he has positively effected. He sees just how much his small town goodness has enriched so many lives.My favorite scene is one involving his romantic tension. Donna Reed plays a neighbor who goes to college while George, bound by family duty, stays home. She graduates and comes by to visit. George does not want to settle down. Rather he wants to have his chance to see the world. However, deep down, he loves her and in an incredibly emotional scene he goes from anger to tender love as the ambivalence pulls at him. He falls into her arms in the most moving and powerful love scene I have ever seen on the silver screen. This powerful love scene is pulled off without even so much as a stitch of clothing being removed and without even a hint of lewd suggestiveness. This beautiful scene is tremendously powerful in its emotionalism. The tension is all emotional, not sexual. What a masterpiece this scene is!Obviously, I love this movie. I have seen it many times and never grow tired of it. I recommend it highly.",5,&quot;A poignant slice of Americana&quot;,1009584000,"12 29, 2001",2001,2217,"['When', 'was', 'young', 'movie', 'was', 'often', 'shown', 'local', 'television', 'stations', 'Christmas', 'time', 'TV', 'Guide', 'listing', 'described', 'quot', 'poignant', 'slice', 'Americana.', 'quot', 'description', 'best', 'one', 'phrase', 'encapsulization', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Back', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'however', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'considered', 'wonderful', 'classic', 'now', 'recognized', 'be', 'Back', 'then', 'local', 'stations', 'used', 'movie', 'inexpensive', 'holiday', 'filler', 'Fortunately', 'world', 'come', 'appreciate', 'what', 'gem', 'Capra', 'classic', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'small', 'town', 'Amrica', 'roaring', 'twenties', 'World', 'War', '2.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'personal', 'tension', 'Gerorge', 'Baily', 'small', 'town', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'desire', 'college', 'education', 'opportunity', 'see', 'world', 'be', 'engineer', 'build', 'bridges', 'tension', 'devotion', 'duty', 'carry', 'family', 'business', 'when', 'father', 'unexpectedly', 'George', 'played', 'James', 'Stewart', 'compassionately', 'struggling', 'savings', 'loan', 'going', 'depression', 'However', 'ultimately', 'failure', 'when', 'reached', 'end', 'rope', 'given', 'opportunity', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'positively', 'effected', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'small', 'town', 'goodness', 'enriched', 'so', 'many', 'lives.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'one', 'involving', 'romantic', 'tension', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'neighbor', 'who', 'college', 'George', 'bound', 'family', 'duty', 'home', 'visit', 'George', 'not', 'want', 'settle', 'down', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'world', 'However', 'deep', 'down', 'incredibly', 'emotional', 'scene', 'anger', 'tender', 'love', 'ambivalence', 'pulls', 'arms', 'most', 'moving', 'powerful', 'love', 'scene', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'silver', 'screen', 'powerful', 'love', 'scene', 'pulled', 'off', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'stitch', 'clothing', 'being', 'removed', 'even', 'hint', 'lewd', 'suggestiveness', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'tremendously', 'powerful', 'emotionalism', 'tension', 'emotional', 'not', 'sexual', 'What', 'masterpiece', 'scene', 'Obviously', 'love', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'never', 'grow', 'tired', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A
39631,A35UNON2GI8C0R,0782002064,David Kusumoto,"[1358, 1397]","* BLU-RAY UPDATE - TheNovember 2009 two-disc Blu-ray edition of ""It's A Wonderful Life""contains both the black-and-white and colorized versions of this film in high definition - and is configured similarly to the standard definition""Two-Disc Collector's DVD Set""that was issued in November 2007.  There are four notable differences:  1) The very few audio defects from the60th Anniversary Edition black-and-white DVD editionthat was issued in October 2006 have been wiped clean, thus making this 2009 two-disc Blu-ray the new ""gold standard"" for this title.  2) The old, 14-minute ""A Personal Remembrance"" featurette memorializing the passing of director Frank Capra in 1991 - with interviews from Capra himself and from actor James Stewart and hosted by Frank Capra, Jr. - has been dropped from the 2009 Blu-ray.  3) The subtitles on both Blu-ray discs have been replaced with a sharper white typeface that looks better on high-definition TVs.  4) A second set of subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (SDH) has also been added to both Blu-ray discs.* All other special extras, i.e., the 1990 standard definition ""The Making of 'It's A Wonderful Life'"" featurette hosted by Tom Bosley - and a re-release theatrical trailer now rendered in high definition (but not cleaned) - have been carried over to the2009 two-disc Blu-ray.* As the cost of Blu-ray players and discs continues to fall through the floor, more buyers are taking the plunge and replacing selected titles in their DVD libraries with high-definition Blu-ray discs.  Although the Blu-ray edition DOES boast the sharpest images to date - in my view, it's not necessary to make the upgrade.  There IS a difference in image quality between the DVD and the Blu-ray - but it's not dramatic enough (especially if you're already using an upscaling DVD player) - to junk your 2006 or 2007 DVDs of this title.  Also note that this film is presented on Blu-ray in its original 1:37:1 semi-square aspect ratio format.  Like ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Casablanca,"" and the equally wonderful""The Best Years of Our Lives""- the latter which beat ""It's A Wonderful Life"" as the Best Picture of 1946 - this film was NEVER shot with wide screen cameras.=============================================ORIGINAL 2006 and 2008 PRODUCT REVIEWS BELOW.=============================================* Rather than review the content of this almost universally beloved film, I'm just going to comment about the quality of the 2006 60th Anniversary Edition DVD itself.  I've since written an updated review about a new edition of this title, now available in a""Two-Disc Collector's Set.""Please find that review -- which was posted on December 13, 2008.  (Amazon has posted my 2006 review in both places -- even though the""60th Anniversary Edition"" DVDis DIFFERENT from the""Two-Disc Collector's Set"".  Read my write-up for the""Two-Disc Collector's Set""-- to better decide which product you prefer.)* I've owned nearly every version of this title in almost every format available on home video during the past 25 years. It's true that the CONTENT of this Viacom/Paramount DVD -- including its special features -- is identical to the Republic Pictures Home Video release more than 10 years ago.* However, this 60th Anniversary edition is spectacular for several different and extremely important reasons.  (I'll address the criticisms some people have leveled about the sound on this 2006 DVD in a little bit, so stick with me.)* You don't have to be a technical expert to immediately notice the striking improvement of the picture AND sound in this 2006 edition. The print is crystal-clear and in my view, has more vividness and sharpness than ALL other previous releases of this title on home video.* Proof?  I put my ""old"" THX-version DVD issued by Republic Pictures / Artisan Home Video (the former DVD gold standard for this title) -- into my Sony multi-changer DVD player -- and watched and listened to every frame of this film AND its special features. I stopped and started this ""older"" DVD in several spots -- and stopped and started the new 2006 Paramount edition repeatedly -- so I could compare quality almost ""side-by-side.""* Hands down -- this 2006 version is fabulous. The spots and dirt have been wiped clean, the sharpness and contrast are arguably better than what film audiences saw 60 years ago. There are no ragged spots, no jumped frames and no lint, fiber or hair fragments along the edges or jumping across the screen. I believe the technicians at Paramount (which acquired Republic Pictures Home Video) -- digitally cleaned EVERY frame of the last DVD release -- so that the film now looks like a million dollars. It's almost too pristine, if there is such a thing. No jump cuts, no ""jump ahead"" sound breaks, no fogged-out scenes, nothing ragged -- with the result being the cleanest and purest version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" ever issued in home video history.* It gets better. English subtitles were available on older DVD versions of this title, but the 2006 version has a cleaner typeface, wiping out some of the confusing and unnecessary attributions of ""who's saying what"" that were disruptive to some hearing-impaired viewers. In this 2006 version, you'll get a mostly straight, line-by-line reading of what's being said -- as it's being said.* Meanwhile, the DVD's special features - which includes the same pair of documentaries produced in 1990 and 1991 - are identical in that they were shot on video tape hence there isn't much improvement in picture quality. However, subtitles that WERE NOT available for these special features - are NOW available in this 2006 edition. The only ""extra"" that remains unchanged - is the original 1946 trailer. Subtitles are not available and it has the same raggedness and dirt commonly seen with vintage trailers stored separately from the films they used to advertise.* I'm highly critical of re-issued DVDs that seem nothing more than an excuse to squeeze more dollars out of buyers for the same material with new packaging. But this 2006 Paramount DVD version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the best to date.  It is NOT in color.  (I own a colorized version for younger people who can't stand black-and-white.  Despite controversy surrounding colorization, know thatthe 2007 ""Two-Disc Collector's Set""has the same 2006 60th Anniversary black-and-white edition you see here - plus a new ""colorized"" version.  This version uses the same pristine print - but has the added bonus of boasting the best ""color"" hues ever seen for this film, using the latest image technology available.  Despite my preference for black-and-white, the quality of this new colorized version is impressive.)* Meanwhile, let's address the criticisms about the sound on this new DVD. Go back a little bit. Much was made when Republic Pictures Home Video got the THX LucasFilm sound system seal of approval for ""It's A Wonderful Life"" during the 1990s. But it was still two-channel mono with negligible equalization of sound effects. In this 2006 DVD, you'll get consistent two-channel mono and decent sound equalization to minimize ""booming"" and over-modulated portions in the film. In the old versions, you had to turn down the volume a notch during the musical portions -- and turn it back up when the dialogue came back. It's a nit-pick, but you really notice the difference if you're crazy enough to do a side-by-side comparison like I did.* As for the digital sound ""pops"" that perfectionists keep bringing up -- they're right. They're even in the spots noted by another fine reviewer who listed time codes where you can find them. But in my view, unless you brace yourselves for them to arrive like a booming train - unless you purposely crank up your speakers to carry sound throughout your house - yeah, you ""might"" be annoyed if you demand the same perfection for a film made in 1946 as you would for a film made in 2006. Honestly, the disproportionate attention given to these digital ""pops"" is, in my view, giving fence-sitters the impression that they're supersonic cracks of lightning that will make people jump out of their seats. I didn't twitch at all. They almost ""blended"" into the 60-year-old soundtrack. Yes, I know they're digital defects, but do you remember the zillion ""pops"" scattered throughout dirty prints of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" with filthy optical soundtracks? The audio on this 2006 DVD still wins.  You have EVERY RIGHT to demand perfection for your dollars. But as a person who's more fastidious than average - I don't believe most buyers will care about a few ""pops"" in a film that's this old. Combine the overall improvements with the relatively low cost of this DVD - and I still say this is the BEST experience of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" I've ever SEEN and HEARD on home video.* Finally, another reason to buy this DVD. It's old news to some, but it's not widely known that this version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" can only be broadcast by NBC.  It used to air a zillion times during the holidays on every TV station on earth. It was a quick way to get tired of even a super film you think you know by heart. But Viacom/Paramount now owns this version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and NBC has exclusive licensing rights to air it just once or twice after Thanksgiving.  This is a good thing for future generations to appreciate.* So junk the old, buy this version and be happy. It may feel painful, but it's worth it. And no, I DON'T work for Amazon NOR for Paramount Home Video.",5,"Why is this the BEST release of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in home video history?",1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,9496,"['*', 'BLU-RAY',

Jimmy Stewart is amazing in this role as George Bailey, and should probably patent the phrase, ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!!""  where else would something catchy, touching and all around fun come from?  It's the tagline and sum of the whole movie, to show that you find what is important in your life and try and not to worry about the things you cannot change, and family is really the most important at the end of the day!So in line with the movie... what if THIS MOVIE had never been made ??  Wow, what movie would be everyones favorite around the December time of year. Always so great its one of those staples they show, more than once around the end of December, and it never gets old watching it, ever.  The last few minutes are always my favorite.  But if it had not been made, sure there are some other nice classics out there, but this is one that is on the books for Stewart to show what a great actor he truly was.  We would not have our favorite taglines to use if this movie had never been made and would not have a film of this sort to really show us how each of us should really value who we are, and know the slightest act of kindness or even just our presence could totally affect someome else, its all in the stream of life, so value and cherish and be the best we can be, and be so happy we have a classic film like this to enjoy for years. so glad its on DVD !!The movies of 2000 + and beyond, and really years before that seem to be lacking in movies that will be true Classics like the Black and White Films, films that have just amazing beautiful, classic, actors.  The movies current now are filled with so much violence, bad language and just silly, mindless scripts, just you have to even monitor with your children before they can watch them, to me, it seems impossible in 60 years that hardly any of these will be categorized as Classic and Meaningful.The Sound of Music is on TV right now, yet another classic annual movie they show on Television, which I love !!

39648,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0782002064,D. Litton,"[10, 10]","When I think of words to describe Frank Capra's masterpiece &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; only one word comes to mind: greatness. Greatness in its storytelling, which embodies the traditions and values of an American era gone by... greatness in its ability to generate some of the most complex characters in movie history from the simplest of human themes... greatness in its sense of heartfelt emotion and true knowledge of what life is really all about. Here is a movie that merits multiple viewings with each new holiday season, leaving its mark on each new generation while giving those familiar with it another chance to experience the magic.People are most often surprised by the history of the film, which opened to moderate business at the box office, yet failed to muster the excitement and audience embracement that modern viewers have so lovingly bestowed upon it. Due to the weather, many people remained in their homes, while many who ventured to the bistro billed the film as too depressing for the Christmas season. And so, like a snowflake in the winter breeze, Frank Capra's slice-of-life film came and went like most modern movies of today.Perhaps if its copyright had been renewed, we may never have known the true heart of this magnificent film, which has since become a traditional part of the holidays for many who revere the film as a classic; to bill it as anything but such is an injustice. The film has earned its popularity through its virtue and heartfelt emotional core, telling a story that serves as a model for humankind as well as a striking portrait of some of our country's most darkest days.The story, originally a short story in the form of a Christmas card which was purchased by RKO Pictures for ten thousand dollars, takes us to the small town of Bedford Falls, where life is simple and people are filled with high spirits despite their hardships. At the center of this is George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart in one of the towering screen performances of all time; George has lofty ambitions that include &quot;seeing the world, building skyscrapers 1000 stories high,&quot; and &quot;a bridge a mile long.&quot; His idealistic view of the outside world is constantly put on hold, as he struggles to upkeep his deceased father's building and loan company, which is in danger of going under.It may not appear so at first, but as the movie progresses, we can see just how much George does for his fellow man. He keeps the building and loan going as an outlet for those who have little or nothing to begin a better life without having to turn to Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore), &quot;the richest and meanest man in the county&quot; who sees fit to keep the citizens of Bedford Falls under his rule. But George will not allow it, and so, with the help of his newly-acquired wife, Mary (Donna Reed), and his business partner, his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), he struggles to keep the town alive, ignoring his own dreams and aspirations for the greater good, never realizing the full impact he has on his fellow man until he is given a frightening glimpse of what may have been had he never been born at all, compliments of angel Clarence Oddbody, played by Henry Travers with real wit and acting ability.Through all of this, George's life is shown in various lights, from the happiest moments a man could ever wish for, to the darkest depths of depression from which every man spends much of his life running from. This is why Capra's film succeeds so enormously: one minute we are in the murkiest recesses of life, as George searches frantically for a way out of his troubles. Through Capra's direction and Stewart's brilliant acting, much of this third act is infused with sheer terror that still manages to evoke chills, as he discovers what his absence would have meant to the people he met in his life. And then, after the realization that running from one's hardships provides no solace, he returns from his nightmare to discover his life in a completely different light, armed with the knowledge that &quot;no man is a failure who has friends.&quot;The overall film itself is a wonderful mosaic of American life at its most jubilant and its most downtrodden. As George grows up, from a small boy working in a drug store, to an ambitious college-bound teenager struck by love when he lays eyes on his future wife, we bear witness to some of the landmarks of our nation's history, from a Charleston contest at a high school dance, to the Great Depression and World War II. Each character is affected by these events, yet their upbeat demeanor in the face of these trying times magnificently captures the human resolve, and we come to care for all of them a great deal more.And just as Capra is working his magic behind the camera, his wonderful and now-landmark cast works much of their own onscreen. Stewart's performance is one of history's most memorable, and will not soon be forgotten so long as the film remains in our hearts. Donna Reed evokes a warm and caring nature as Mary, sharing a terrific bond with Stewart that makes the marriage between their two characters affectionate and loving, not to mention totally convincing. Thomas Mitchell's eccentric and frantic Uncle Billy is supplied with heart, while each supporting actor offers humor and heartfelt emotion to the town's most notable citizens. Barrymore, too, plays the miserly Mr. Potter with supreme and delectable nastiness, one of Hollywood's most memorable villains.Despite a less-than-favorable history, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; has reached its broad audience to find a home in everyone's hearts, with its wonderful storytelling, instantly likeable characters, and warm message about life.

If you haven't seen it, you will be told it is a somewhat sentimental tale of how a man discovers what other people's lives could have been like if he had never lived, courtesy of an angel. But this is not quite right. There is a small amount of sentiment in the film, and it may well leave you teary eyed, but that isn't the whole story. The first three-quarters of the film are spent building the story of George's life from childhood to mid-forties, showing how he met his wife, helped save the family business, the town, and his brother's life along the way. There are moments here when Stewart shows his full acting range, with the kind-hearted character he usually plays prone to moments of anger, impatience and cruelty. This is not a fairy-tale for Christmas, this is real life, otherwise why would George feel so wretched that he would want to kill himself. Notably the villain of the piece goes unpunished at the end of this film, a far cry from a cosy morality tale, and again more like real life.But it is perhaps the last half hour which is prominent in most people's minds, the charming apprentice angel Clarence only has a quarter of the screen time yet is remembered as fondly as Stewart himself by many viewers. This is one to watch every Christmas.

Now I own a copy, and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is watched faithfully each Holiday Season--often several times.Frank Capra's endearing classic is the ultimate feel-good movie, like a sip of hot chocolate to warm the throat following a festive night under the stars looking at lights.  All of us readily identify with George Bailey, a common man with big dreams and grand expectations.  But when George's life consistently fails to meet his expectations, he becomes more disillusioned, disappointed.  If only he could have traveled the world, designed and built the skyscrapers and bridges he talked about as a boy, his life would be meaningful.And then George faces the ultimate conflict:  possible bankruptcy, scandal, and imprisonment.  He contemplates what, quite frankly, many of us would contemplate at such a time--suicide.  Instead, he is given the ultimate gift:  a chance to see what life would be like had he never been born.  What he sees is bleak, even hopeless, and suddenly George realizes:  his life has been meaningful, all along.  And the majestic magnitude of his life is manifested during the film's final scene, when George's family and friends embrace him and rush to his aid.James Stewart, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore lead an exceptional cast in this wondrous film.

Bishop,"[0, 4]","In a conversation with a Chinese professor about ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" he surprised me by saying the Capra classic helped him better understand banks, capitalism, and oppression.  He had obviously focused on ""Mr. Potter.""I replied that the film did provide some lessons in banking history -- how there were bank runs before there was federal deposit insurance, the differences between banks and what we now call credit unions, bank examining, and how credit and financial institutions could help make the dreams of a home or a business come true.I said, though, that while banking gives the plot its frame, the film is not about banks.  It's rather a reflection on the worthwhile life.  That an individual can lead a worthy life in a small town as well as a large city.  That helping others is a mark of character.  That money has little to do with being ""the richest man in town.""Right now, upwardly mobile young people in China want money. After so many decades of poverty, it's a natural social development that Chinese have focused on material things.  It's gone so far, though, that young upwardly mobile Chinese look down on their cousins and classmates who have stayed back in the small town where they grew up.  These young people may even look down on their schoolteachers, who gave them so much, because they don't make much money.This means that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a film for Chinese as well as for Americans.-30-",5,It's not about banks,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,1435,"['conversation', 'Chinese', 'professor', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'surprised', 'saying', 'Capra', 'classic', 'helped', 'better', 'understand', 'banks', 'capitalism', 'oppression', 'had', 'obviously', 'focused', 'Mr', 'Potter', 'replied', 'film', 'did', 'provide', 'lessons', 'banking', 'history', 'how', 'were', 'bank', 'runs', 'was', 'federal', 'deposit', 'insurance', 'differences', 'banks', 'what', 'now', 'call', 'credit', 'unions', 'bank', 'examining', 'how', 'credit', 'financial', 'institutions', 'could', 'help', 'make', 'dreams', 'home', 'business', 'come', 'true.I', 'said', 'though', 'banking', 'plot', 'frame', 'film', 'not', 'banks', 'rather', 'reflection', 'worthwhile', 'life', 'individual', 'can', 'lead', 'worthy', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'as', 'well', 'large', 'city', 'helping', 'others', 'mark', 'character', 'money', 'little', 'do', 'being', 'richest', 'man', 'town', 'Right', 'now', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'young', 'people', 'China', 'want', 'money', 'so', 'many', 'decades', 'poverty', 'natural', 'social', 'development', 'Chinese', 'have', 'focused', 'material', 'things', 'gone', 'so', 'far', 'though', 'young', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'Chinese', 'look', 'down', 'cousins', 'classmates', 'who', 'have', 'stayed', 'back', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'young', 'people', 'may', 'even', 'look', 'down', 'schoolteachers', 'who', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'money.This', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'film', 'Chinese', 'as', 'well', 'Americans.-30-']",N/A

Frank Capra's classic movie carries the simple but powerful message that everyone can be a hero in their own lives, and no one is poor who has friends.The story features James Stewart as George Bailey, a banker in the small town of Bedford Falls.  Facing financial ruin on Christmas Eve, he comtemplates suicide.  His guardian angel, Clarence, gives him an opportunity to see his life as it might have been without him.  George, although hardworking, good-hearted, happily married, and modestly successful, has unluckily never had the opportunity to pursue bigger dreams outside Bedford Falls.  In the disturbingly dark alternate version of his life, we discover that George had a postive impact on a lot of people over the years, and without him, those lives went badly wrong.  In the end, George is offered the chance to return to his life as he has lived it, and discovers the true value of friendship.""It's a Wonderful Life"" features an exceptionally solid cast and crisp black and white cinematography.  Frank Capra's excellent direction carries us through the emotional gauntlet of George Bailey's painful voyage of discovery about the truth of his life. The feel-good ending will make the viewer appreciate his or her own Christmas as the annual small miracle it is.This movie is highly recommended as a family Christmas movie on a par with the better versions of Dicken's ""Christmas Carol.""",5,The Darkness and the Light,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,1479,"['1947', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'rightly', 'been', 'Christmas', 'favorite', 'years', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'classic', 'movie', 'simple', 'powerful', 'message', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'hero', 'own', 'lives', 'one', 'poor', 'who', 'friends.The', 'story', 'features', 'James', 'Stewart', 'George', 'Bailey', 'banker', 'small', 'town', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'Facing', 'financial', 'ruin', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'suicide', 'guardian', 'angel', 'Clarence', 'opportunity', 'see', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'George', 'hardworking', 'good-hearted', 'happily', 'married', 'modestly', 'successful', 'unluckily', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'pursue', 'bigger', 'dreams', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'disturbingly', 'dark', 'alternate', 'version', 'life', 'discover', 'George', 'had', 'postive', 'impact', 'lot', 'people', 'years', 'lives', 'went', 'badly', 'wrong', 'end', 'George', 'offered', 'chance', 'return', 'life', 'lived', 'true', 'value', 'friendship', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'exceptionally', 'solid', 'cast', 'crisp', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'excellent', 'direction', 'emotional', 'gauntlet', 'George', 'Bailey', 'painful', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'truth', 'life', 'feel-good', 'ending', 'will', 'make', 'viewer', 'appreciate', 'own', 'Christmas', 'annual', 'small', 'miracle', 'is.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'family', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'par', 'better', 'versions', 'Dicken', 'Christmas', 'Carol']",N/A

This classic film of a common, down on his luck ""Everyman"" who wishes he'd never been born is, by far, the best movie ever made!After a slight misstep by his bumbling Uncle Billy, George Bailey's ""Building and Loan"" comes up short 8,000 dollars. In a moment of desperation and depression, George Bailey considers throwing away God's greatest gift, his own life. Instead, Clarence -- an angel wishing to get his wings -- intervenes, hoping the good deed of saving George Bailey will cause a bell to ring...Why? Because ""every time a bell rings... an angel gets his wings.""Instead of helping George take his own life, Clarence guides George through a ""Christmas Carol"" type story, where George is given a chance to see what the world would be like without him in it.Throw a pebble into a pond and the ripple effects are seen for quite some time. They grow and grown, covering more area, spreading farther and wider until they eventually reach the ends of the pond, lake, or ocean in which they sprang. In this tale, George Bailey gets a first-hand glimpse at exactly how far and wide the ripple effect of his own existence has reached.You can't buy that kind of spirit...(Note: Look for Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer as Frankie Othello in the Dance scene.)",5,Best Movie EVER!

Melillo ""gloriana""","[9, 18]","I suppose that, the first time one watches this rather excessively sweet film, even the most hardened cynic would shed a tear at the ending, when George is revealed as one who has a matchless wealth of friends and support. James Stewart indeed portrays George Bailey superbly, but I found that, beyond the first viewing, this becomes rather an annoying film.Of course, the contrast between George (the sort of man anyone would like on sight, and love all the more with acquaintance), and the dreadful Potter, who makes the pre-converted Ebenezer Scrooge look cuddly, provides much of the action - trouble is, the premise really is not that realistic. The idea that being good-natured, and having a spirit of self-sacrifice that goes from heroic to excessive, benefits one's community is taken to too great an extreme. The Baileys are always on verge of bankruptcy, yet manage to be the saviours of all of the rather poor people who want to fulfil the mid-century dream of owning their own homes. Intending no blasphemy, I found it annoying that George becomes something of a Christ figure... yet never is allowed to think of himself or his family in the process.George seems a wonderful man, but it became difficult to see his as a ""wonderful life."" It seemed that everyone was entitled to fulfil their dreams except George... indeed, that he had to make certain that he sacrificed every aspiration (college, honeymoon trip, travelling) entirely so someone else could have them. Considering how, when George sees what the town would be like had he never lived, everyone is in miserable straits, the 'saviour' business is rather macabre, as are the people resident in Bedford Falls!Romantic though I am at heart, the cynical part of me sighed, knowing full well that, no matter how good anyone was to others, the first accusation of embezzlement would be more likely to make the others think, ""now we know how he really is!"" Miserable though Potter is, it does not ring true that one with his resources could be totally unsuccessful in acquiring potential homeowners as customers because a good-hearted, impoverished sort simply was more pleasant.Certainly, watch this once... but don't go back for repeated viewings, since the memory of the first viewing will be far more pleasant than the cloying effects of repeat performances.",3,It is moving to watch... the FIRST time,1004486400,"10 31, 2001",2001,2329,"['suppose', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'rather', 'excessively', 'sweet', 'film', 'even', 'most', 'hardened', 'cynic', 'would', 'shed', 'tear', 'ending', 'when', 'George', 'revealed', 'one', 'who', 'matchless', 'wealth', 'friends', 'support', 'James', 'Stewart', 'indeed', 'George', 'Bailey', 'superbly', 'found', 'first', 'viewing', 'rather', 'annoying', 'film.Of', 'course', 'contrast', 'George', 'sort', 'man', 'anyone', 'would', 'like', 'sight', 'love', 'more', 'acquaintance', 'dreadful', 'Potter', 'who', 'pre-converted', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'look', 'cuddly', 'much', 'action', 'trouble', 'premise', 'really', 'not', 'realistic', 'idea', 'being', 'good-natured', 'having', 'spirit', 'self-sacrifice', 'heroic', 'excessive', 'benefits', 'one', 'community', 'taken', 'too', 'great', 'extreme', 'Baileys', 'are', 'always', 'verge', 'bankruptcy', 'yet', 'manage', 'be', 'saviours', 'rather', 'poor', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'fulfil', 'mid-century', 'dream', 'owning', 'own', 'homes', 'Intending', 'blasphemy', 'found', 'annoying', 'George', 'something', 'Christ', 'figure', 'yet', 'never', 'allowed', 'think', 'family', 'process.George', 'wonderful', 'man', 'became', 'difficult', 'see', 'wonderful', 'life', 'seemed', 'everyone', 'was', 'entitled', 'fulfil', 'dreams', 'George', 'indeed', 'had', 'make', 'certain', 'sacrificed', 'aspiration', 'college', 'honeymoon', 'trip', 'travelling', 'entirely', 'someone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'Considering', 'how', 'when', 'George', 'what', 'town', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'never', 'lived', 'everyone', 'miserable', 'straits', ""'saviour"", 'business', 'rather', 'macabre', 'are', 'people', 'resident', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'Romantic', 'am', 'heart', 'cynical', 'part', 'sighed', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'anyone', 'was', 'others', 'first', 'accusation', 'embezzlement', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'make', 'others', 'think', 'now', 'know', 'how', 'really', 'Miserable', 'Potter', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'one', 'resources', 'could', 'be', 'totally', 'unsuccessful', 'acquiring', 'potential', 'homeowners', 'customers', 'good-hearted', 'impoverished', 'sort', 'simply', 'was', 'more', 'pleasant.Certainly', 'watch', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'memory', 'first', 'viewing', 'will', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'pleasant', 'cloying', 'effects', 'repeat', 'performances']",N/A
39666,A3L31489BCB1D7,0782002064,El Kabong,"[4, 5]","I'd prefer not to echo the praise this film receives from seemingly everyone, but I've always been fascinated by its continuing, and growing, appeal to modern audiences....so I suppose the next few echoes you hear will just be me, throwing somebody else's two cents in.The Bedford Falls of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has never really existed - that's hardly a news flash. Bedford Falls is childhood and innocence tucked away in the safe harbor of the past, a deeply comforting fantasy composed of equal portions of wish-fulfillment and nostalgia: a fantasy which summons our better angels, lifting us out of dog-eat-dog mundanity and towards a picture-postcard version of the Ideal. It's this first half of IAWL that chafes against the jaded postmodern sensibility that seeks always to justify and celebrate aberrance, even evil, in the name of 'understanding'; a generation whelped on wrestling, gangsta-rap, South Park and Howard Stern (all of which get brushed under the rug as 'harmless fun') is hardly likely to respond to Capra's idealistic Everytown with anything beyond bemused contempt. The second half - the dark, slightly creepy, Twilight Zone portion of the film - exerts a far more seductive pull on modern moviegoers. Well, let's face it, Pottersville is what contemporary America IS; it's what people have gotten used to, at least, in many cases convincing themselves is preferable to some candyass Norman Rockwell never-neverland. (Because it's 'real', you see; and consistent with this ghetto existentialism, harsh &amp; ugly 'reality' trumps every other kind.) Has anyone ever noted that while Bedford Falls is obviously a studio creation, the camera pans across the nightmarish neon marquees dotting Pottersville might be stock footage of any postwar American city? That contrast, that wrenching emotional dichotomy, is what strikes such a chord within those of us who love this film without reservation, as does Capra's message in IAWL: that Bedford Falls is within reach of us all if we love our friends and family, stay the course despite setbacks, treat others with kindness and respect...and believe in God.The simple key that unlocks this film is belief in God; having steadfast faith in a benevolent Higher Power which views each human life as precious &amp; important. Capra &amp; Stewart were both troubled by currents of cynicism making strong inroads into American life after WW2, particularly wanting to combat a creeping purposelessness they saw as rooted in atheism (which always becomes fashionable after wartime). Though not made as a Xmas attraction per se (not a single depiction of clergy in the entire damn film!), IAWL promotes a belief in God as the vital glue of conscience, family, community, nation  - without which all our Bedford Falls would be inevitably subsumed into Pottersvilles. Give Capra credit for managing to impart this message subtly, despite all the angels, answered prayers and celestial voice-overs he has woven into the story fabric. (Maybe TOO subtly, as the movie tanked on first release, eventually tumbling into the public domain.) Though lately such strong endorsement of religious faith is considered cultural anathema (at least according to the empty suits running film studios), nevertheless IAWL now seems impossible to resist to audiences unceasingly bludgeoned with entertainment built upon callousness, carnality and previously-unthinkable levels of brutality. (Which is why the notion of a remake is utterly laughable: even teenagers who don't 'get' old black &amp; white movies are intuitive enough to grasp that this kind of deep-rooted sentiment properly belongs to a different America - the America contemporary Hollywood has taught them to despise.)Though everyone rightfully focuses on Jimmy Stewart's truly stunning performance as George Bailey, it's worth noting that this might be Capra's finest hour as a filmmaker. There's no exotica a la LOST HORIZON or showy MR SMITH filibusters on view; WONDERFUL LIFE is more introspective and mellow a film, Capra in a muted key. But every setpiece is staged and photographed expertly, and all the big payoffs resonate with honest and powerful emotion. The scene with young George Bailey and the drunken, grief-crazed druggist is as beautifully done as any in Capra's long career, and that's just the first of many high points here: the lovingly-shot nostalgia of the farewell dance; George &amp; Mary's tentative, slowly-building love scene as they share a phone call from a friend; the sick, shamed look of helplessness on George's face directly following his violent tantrum in front of his kids. All are indelible moments that cling to your memory for a lifetime, and Capra seems to have been saving them all up for this movie. Yet perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the film is the inability of film critics - otherwise at a loss to explain its strong hold over an increasingly secular public - to resist 'interpreting' it for the new millenium. Thus, the endless 'cutting-edge' bromides one reads that patiently explain how IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a 'dark' film with a pessimistic view of American middle-class aspirations &amp; values...even an indictment of them! Yet somehow, year after year, millions of viewers faithfully watch it for the umpteenth time, reaffirming those same values, laughing and crying along with George, losing and finding their religion through the proxy of George's suffering and renewal. It took a while for Capra &amp; Stewart's favorite film to finally do what they'd hoped it would - speak to an audience, and help give it faith to believe &amp; strength to abide - but once WONDERFUL LIFE got its bearings and began gathering momentum, not a day goes by that this remarkable movie isn't earning its wings somewhere in the world.",5,"Redemption, Renewal &amp; Joy",1000080000,"09 10,

Home Alone, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, A Christmas Story, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Elf, Miracle on 34th Street, and even Ernest Saves Christmas are ideal motion pictures for this time of year. Many people, however, consider It's A Wonderful Life to be the finest Christmas film, and it's not hard to see why. It's a loose adaptation of Philip Van Doren Stern's short story called ""The Greatest Gift,"" and it tells of how wonderfully important your life really is, not only to yourself but to everyone that's close around you.

I only turn it on occasionally for Christmas movies in other words.  Okay, so occasionally I might sneak in an old Andy Griffith Show as well, I wont deny that.  We as a nation and also as the global citizens of today need to seriously ask ourselves a question: What has become of us?  No really, what are we all becoming, and are we sure that we ever gave our consent to becoming it?  As we get older we tend to be more concerned for things like safety and morals, our children's safety and morals, living a good, simple life, and things of this sort.  This might even happen to you some day, but with all of the helevision programming being consumed into the youth's minds today, I literally shudder at what the future might look like.People from my generation and from those before it remember hearing Christmas songs when we'd go into stores.  And I mean actual Christmas songs, none of this 'Jingle Bell Rock' garbage no, no it was 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful' and real Christmas songs like that.  It created an enduring sense of sacred reverence and awe that is indescribable to people that have never experienced it.  But now I see that Christmas (and Christianity) is no longer ""politically correct."" Shame on everyone who has taken part in allowing this to happen.  It might seem like a victory for you now, but the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and I guarantee you, a dechristianized world is a world that even you do not want to live in.That said, do give this movie an honest and objective try.  There is nothing quite like it that has ever been done in the cinematic form.  Maybe if we humble ourselves, educate our minds and work extra hard, God willing, we might get the nation back to a fit and moral state again.

39681,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0782002064,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 3]","This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job.  Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering ""It's a Wonderful Life"" an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.

It is the best of Stewart and Capra adding up to one of the most heartwarming stories of all time.  This may exhibit Stewart is his every man role once again but it breaks away from Mr. Smith in many ways making it another uniquely great film. A film like this that makes you know and feel for characters is certainly worth watching. Starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed with a fantastic supporting cast,  the film tells the life story of George Bailey. We watch with the angel Clarence as he sees George's life unfold. George saves his brother Harry as a boy and as a result loses hearing in his ear. He plans to travel and go to college but once more he sacrifices. He builds up all those around him with selfless kindness while also standing up to the grumpy millionaire Mr. Potter. Eventually he marries the love of his life and has children. Although by unfortunate circumstances Bailey finds himself contemplating suicide. That's when Clarence comes into his life to show George just how important he really is. Once he gets his life back George finds immediate joy and gains so much because of his friends and family. There is nothing much to do after this film but simply be happy.

It's just a charming, heart-warming film with a nice mix of comedy, drama, sadness, despair and joy which makes it difficult for any human being to not be touched emotionally in some way by this film.  The screenplay is very good, the casting excellent and James Stewart shows why he is considered to be among the greatest screen actors of all time.The DVD though isn't all that much to shout about.  The Special Features are pretty decent with a very good documentary about the film hosted by Tom Bosley of ""Happy Days"" fame being the standout but it's placed on the the ""B"" side of this single disc.  Fortunately with the advent of Blu-ray and the much greater capacity such a format affords, we don't have to put up with this inconvenience any longer.  The sound quality is in the original mono format which has been THX mastered which makes it the best possible mono quality that you can find.  However, it would have been nice if they were to provided Dolby or otherwise 5.1 Surround Sound Options as well.  The picture quality has been restored but not very well as visual imperfections exist throughout the film suggesting either a poorly preserved master or that the restoration job wasn't the best.I note at the time of writing that a Blu-Ray version is out there and I wonder if they made any more audio and visual restorations and if so, I will certainly put it on my list of Blu-Ray titles to get in the future.

Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 4]","Frank Capra was renowned for his ability to combine powerhouse stories with a populist edge and a slightly sentimental touch--and movies like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington and Meet John Doe have certainly stood the test of time.  But in my opinion, Capra overshot his own formula with It's A Wonderful Life, a film that is so awash in sentimentality that it basically swamps every other aspect of the film.The story is very famous and needs no more than a mention here: facing scandal, banker George (James Stewart) is on the verge of suicide on Christmas Eve, when an unexpected angel (Henry Travers) arrives to show him what the world in general--and his home town of New Bedford Falls in particular--would have been like if he had never been born.  As a result, George learns that he has impacted countless people for the better and that his life has indeed had a depth of meaning he never knew.The cast is excellent, filled with memorable stars and character actors.  The art direction is at times nothing short of spectacular.  But the script is ... well, the word ""syrup"" comes to mind.  We expect Christmas movies to be uplifting and sweet, but you can have too much of a good thing, and that is certainly the case here.  The film has a goody-goody quality that becomes quickly wearing.  It is worth pointing out that neither critics nor audiences were enthusiastic about It's A Wonderful Life back in 1946, and their complaint was much the same.  The film is so sweet it can rot your teeth at twenty paces.It wasn't until the film passed into public domain and was rerun endless by network television, who could play it at no cost, that it attracted major public attention, and now that it has the benefit of the familiar it has become quite famous.  But that doesn't mean it is the great classic that so many people proclaim it to be.  When all is said and done, It's A Wonderful Life is too much like eating sugar straight from the bag.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Ho-Ho-Hum: Eating Sugar Straight From the Bag,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,1965,"['Frank', 'Capra', 'was', 'renowned', 'ability', 'combine', 'powerhouse', 'stories', 'populist', 'edge', 'slightly', 'sentimental', 'touch', 'movies', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'Meet', 'John', 'Doe', 'have', 'certainly', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'opinion', 'Capra', 'own', 'formula', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'film', 'so', 'awash', 'sentimentality', 'basically', 'swamps', 'other', 'aspect', 'film.The', 'story', 'very', 'famous', 'more', 'mention', 'here', 'facing', 'scandal', 'banker', 'George', 'James', 'Stewart', 'verge', 'suicide', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'when', 'unexpected', 'angel', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'show', 'what', 'world', 'general', 'home', 'town', 'New', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'particular', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'result', 'George', 'impacted', 'countless', 'people', 'better', 'life', 'indeed', 'had', 'depth', 'meaning', 'never', 'knew.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'filled', 'memorable', 'stars', 'character', 'actors', 'art', 'direction', 'times', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'script', 'well', 'word', 'syrup', 'mind', 'expect', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'be', 'uplifting', 'sweet', 'can', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'certainly', 'case', 'here', 'film', 'goody-goody', 'quality', 'quickly', 'wearing', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'critics', 'audiences', 'were', 'enthusiastic', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'back', '1946', 'complaint', 'was', 'much', 'same', 'film', 'so', 'sweet', 'can', 'rot', 'teeth', 'twenty', 'paces.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'passed', 'public', 'domain', 'was', 'rerun', 'endless', 'network', 'television', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'cost', 'attracted', 'major', 'public', 'attention', 'now', 'benefit', 'familiar', 'become', 'quite', 'famous', ""n't"", 'mean', 'great', 'classic', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'proclaim', 'be', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'too', 'much', 'eating', 'sugar', 'straight', 'bag.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Frank Capra, a legend in his own time, read a short story entitled ""The Greatest Gift"" by Phillip Van Doren Stern. With his team he wrote a screenplay based on the story, and It's A Wonderful Life was born.There was a great deal of excitement on December 20, 1946 as the finished film premiered at New York's Globe Theatre. Reviews were mixed.  Perhaps it was because of the postwar mentality.Audiences did not embrace it in the winter of 1947.  It did not break even at the box office. A fantasy film with so much wholesomeness was a bit hard to swallow after years of war with wounds still so fresh.It was nominated for 5 Academy Awards (Best Actor, Best Film, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Sound).  The postwar drama, The Best Years of Our Lives, would take all the awards and all the praise as well as being the top grossing film.  Frank Capra did receive the Golden Globe for director.As things tend to be over time, It's A Wonderful Life found a new audience and new generations on television in the 70's and 80's, even though the film copies were poor and edited badly.Now in its restored version, it is viewed as the holiday favorite in December.  NBC has exclusive rights for its showing.This 2 Disc DVD has a colorized version as well as the pristine black/white. The black and white version gives a vivid life to the characters and Bedford Falls.  There is a nice tribute to Frank Capra in this set.It is a story of hope, love, redemption, and simple goodness.If you had to choose as a neighbor and friend George Bailey or Henry Potter, who would be your choice?

Talk about police brutality!2) In George's alternate life, we find that Mary had the very worst possible thing happen to her: she became an old maid!. Her eyesight aapparently also suffered from this as she ended up wearing glasses too.3) George and Clarence get thrown out of a bar for talking about 200 year old angels. Those Potterville bars sure had high standards for their drunken patron's conversations!4) I would also question George's sanity for letting Uncle Billy handle a $8,000 deposit which I'm guessing would represent somewhere around $200,000 of today.5) The simple, even naive way the movie starts with the stars speaking to one other. There you can also hear someone praying to ""Jesus, Mary and Joseph"". I bet somebody would attack that for being ""un-politically correct"" these days.I also noticed for the first time that with all the heavy snowing when George is on the bridge, not a single flake actually sticks to his clothes; Harry's hat in his final scene also seems to be refrigerated as the snow on it stays while that on his shoulders melts.

39701,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,0782002064,Godly Gadfly,"[5, 9]","Your life doesn't seem so wonderful?  Suffering from depression?  Then here's a pill to swallow: watch Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  It's guaranteed to do you some good.The screenplay of It's a Wonderful Life originated with a Christmas card short story called ""The Greatest Gift"" by Philip Van Doren Stern.  It revolves around the life of George Bailey, an ordinary man who falls in love, gets married, has a family, and unselfishly works hard to support his family and local community.  Deep down George has the itch to escape the chains of the small town atmosphere of Bedford Falls and the family business.  He longs to travel the world in search of adventure, and has visions of constructing grand buildings.  His dreams however are anchored by reality: He feels morally bound to honor his commitments to his family and the family business ""Bailey Building and Loan"".  The first three quarters of the movie slowly builds up atmosphere, as we come to understand George Bailey's character and outlook on life.It is only towards the very end that the moment of crisis comes: On the eve of Christmas, precisely as a bank inspector is on the scene, a huge sum of money is lost by the bank, and George's entire business is threatened.  At this point the lengthy build-up bears rich fruits: as viewers we are now in a position to understand the incredible and painful frustration George feels.  We share the hurt and disillusionment of this broken man as he snaps at his family and loved ones, and tears well up as his uncomprehending children pray desperately for their father.  It is the slow build up that enables us to share his and their emotions of grief, sorrow, pain and frustration.When George is at the end of his road, he selfishly considers suicide.  At this point heaven answers the prayers of his family by sending a guardian angel second class (AS2) named Clarence to help George renew his perspective on life.  When George in his depressed state is convinced that the world would have been better off without him, the angel offers him ""a chance to see what the world would be like without you.""  His magical heavenly touch transforms the world to the place it would have been without George Bailey's touch, so that George can discover that ""each man's life touches so many other lives.""The religious aspect is not convincing: Bailey receives divine aid even though he professes himself not to be a religious man, whereas the Bible portrays heavenly help as a gift for believers.  The notion of a guardian angel as presented in the movie is especially weak, particularly because of the way it often functions for comic relief in a rather trite and disrespectful manner.  Spiritual matters hardly receive the serious treatment they deserve.  In the end, religion (represented by the guardian angel) functions more as a backdrop and literary device to examine a serious perspective on life.  It's a flimsy and unconvincing backdrop, but the matters that the guardian angel as a literary device serves to reflect on are serious indeed.  By being given the opportunity to imagine he had not existed, George Bailey is confronted with the value of life, even a hard and difficult life, and learns that every person can make a difference.  As George reflects on all his blessings, and the impact he has been able to have on people's lives, he comes to the conviction ""I want to live again.""  Clarence reinforces George's desire to live:  ""You see, George, you really had a wonderful life.  Don't you think it's a mistake to throw it away?""  Life is valuable particularly when it is used in selflessness (represented by Bailey) and not in selfishness (represented by Potter).  When serving others instead of mammon, life is tremendously valuable, even though it may be hard.Though religion is outwardly present in the form of the guardian angel, this affirmation of the value of human life has been stripped of any religious notions.  And yet this self-reflection is itself a very religious one.  It is too bad that the movie succumbs to the need to have a feel-good ending where George overcomes his troubles, because it results in a overly sentimental feel-good Christmas without the Christ-child.  In that sense the movie falls short by not being sufficiently religious.  The reality is that the lives of most viewers do not receive the magical solution that George receives, and that their troubles are ongoing - and only the gospel gives life a wonderful significance in the midst of ongoing troubles.  By providing an overly sweet ending, the theme of ""do good to others"" is unchained from the gospel, and an opportunity was lost to convey a message even more profound.But even so, the message conveyed is still profound and enduring: Life is wonderful, particularly when it is lived in selflessness for others.  We might not all touch as many lives as George does, but we can all have a tremendous impact in the lives of others.  Unlike so many contemporary movies, It's a Wonderful Life does not promote materialism, greed or immorality, but shows the joys and rewards of a simple and self-less life with family and friends.  The concept is brilliant, and we are left to reflect for ourselves what the lives of our family and friends would be like without our touch.  Not only does this movie provide enduring and powerful themes affirming the value of marriage, family and self-less human life, but it does so with warm humor and touching romance.  Most importantly there is powerful emotion and lasting quality that has the capacity to renew your perspective on your own life.  What more could you ask for?  Few movies are worth watching more than once, but this is certainly one of them! You only live once, but watching this movie once or more might just improve that life you only have the opportunity to live once.",5,It's a Wonderful Message!,1018310400,"04 9,

I purchased the 60th anniversary DVD edition last year (which already looked quite good)--and the improvement in video and audio on the Blu-ray is remarkable.There are two Blu-ray discs, one containing the colorized version and the second disc has the original black & white movie, plus several special features.  While both versions look crisp and clear and free of any grain or softness (especially noticeable in the numerous night time scenes--the blacks look terrific).  Colorized versions of original B & W movies usually look horrible (poor color saturation, less sharp images--the 60th anniversary DVD color version suffered in this way)--but this one looks fantastic--natural color saturation and an image that is every bit as clear and sharp as the original B & W.  As I was watching the color version, it was hard to believe that this was not originally filmed in color.At first I balked at the nearly $20 cost on Amazon (as of December 8 2009, and probably much more expensive elsewhere)--but the upgrade was worth every penny for this wonderful, classic, family film.

For millions around the world, watching this inspiring, heartwarming movie starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed is as much a part of the Christmas celebration as putting cookies and milk out for Santa Claus, caroling, drinking eggnog, or trimming the tree.Of the hundreds of movies I've seen during the forty-one years I've lived so far, there isn't one I can think of that is so quintessentially American as It's A Wonderful Life. Part comedy, part melodrama, and part supernatural fantasy, the film recounts the life of an apparently ordinary guy, George Bailey, who keeps getting the short end of the stick when it comes to realizing his extraordinary dreams and plans for the future.However, I've learned first-hand that professing my love for this film is sure to provoke arguments with those who accept the ethics of objectivism (the philosophy of Ayn Rand). On its face, the message of the film appears to endorse self-sacrifice for the good of others. But I disagree with that interpretation. In fact, I think that the choices made by George Bailey during his life were truly wonderful, embodying a full and proper conception of personal, long-term self-interest, but without preaching egotism.The movie opens to the voices of George's loved ones, family and friends who are sending up prayers to God to take care of and watch out for George, who's fallen on the hardest of hard times on Christmas Eve. George's bad luck doesn't look like it's about to change when he is assigned a guardian angel (""second class"") named Clarence, a benevolent bumbler who hasn't even ""earned his wings.""  We then learn what has brought George Bailey to the brink of tragedy as director Capra tells the man's life story in a long flashback that makes up most of the picture.Ever since boyhood, George Bailey has been there for others. When he was twelve, he rescued his brother, Harry, from drowning in a pond after he had crashed through the ice while sledding. Later, working as a drugstore delivery boy, he prevented his distraught, drunken boss from accidentally dispensing poison in prescription capsules.As he grows up, George dreams of bigger things than can be found in the confines of his small town: seeing Europe, becoming a civil engineer. About to head off to tramp through Europe before going to college, he shares with his girlfriend, Mary (Donna Reed), his secret aspirations:""Mary, I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow and the next day, and next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm gonna see the world! I'm gonna build things: I'm gonna build airfields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high! I'm gonna build bridges a mile long!""But at every crucial turn in his life, George's grandiose dreams are thwarted by the responsibilities of everyday life. As he's about to set sail, he learns that his father had a fatal stroke. After the funeral, George stays in Bedford Falls to run the Bailey Bros. Building and Loan, the family business that his father and Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) had built up, rather than allow it to slip into the grasp of the family's avaricious nemesis, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Potter is the town's Scrooge-like magnate, a corrupt, power-lusting slumlord who owns most of the key businesses in Bedford Falls. George puts his dreams on hold while he manages the business--and while he watches his younger brother, Harry, go off to college instead.Then, rather than jump at the opportunity to invest in the promising plastics industry, George instead goes after his real love, Mary, finally proposing to her. One of the movie's pivotal scenes occurs on the day of their marriage. Just as they are about to embark on their European honeymoon, fate again steps in: their wedding date is ""Black Tuesday,"" October 29, 1929--the day of the stock market crash. En route to the train station, George and Mary see the people of Bedford Falls running toward the building and loan. George rushes over to find that Uncle Billy has panicked and shut the doors to depositors, having disbursed all the money on hand. Worse, Mr. Potter telephones and tells George that he will ""help"" bail out the building and loan by offering its members fifty cents on the dollar for every share.While everyone is losing his head, George keeps his cool, despite the throng of terrified customers demanding their money. George staves off the building and loan's collapse not by whining to the crowd to bail him out, but by appealing to their long-term self-interest: by asking them not to sell out their future to Potter.""You're thinking about this place all wrong, as if I have the money back in the safe. The money's not here. Well, your money's in Joe's house, that's right next to yours. And the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Maitlin's house and a hundred others. You're lending them the money to build, and then they're going to pay it back to you as best they can....Now, listen to me, I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets a hold of this building and loan, there will never be another decent house built in this town.... Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten, have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken down shack? Here, Ed, remember last year, when things weren't going so well, you couldn't make your payments? Well, you didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would've let you keep it? Can't you understand what's happening here? Potter isn't selling, he's buying! And why? Because we're panicking and he's not.... Now, we can get through this thing all right, we've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other.""I once argued with an Objectivist about that scene, maintaining that George and Mary did the right thing by using their $2,000 honeymoon nest egg to help their depositors weather the storm. But all my friend could see in that scene--indeed, in the whole movie--was altruism. ""One of the very first lines in that movie,"" he told me, ""is `he never thinks of himself'!""But was that true? Consider what would have happened had George and Mary gone on their honeymoon instead of bailing out their building and loan. Yes, they would have had an enjoyable, relaxing couple of months in Europe; but what would they have come home to? The business that George's father had sweat blood to create and keep afloat would have gone bankrupt. Not only would George and Mary have had no source of income, but their depositors--family, friends, loved ones--would have seen their life savings evaporate. The housing development George had built would have fallen into Potter's hands.For George, the choice was between short-term pleasure and long-term priorities. Did he choose irrationally?What makes It's A Wonderful Life work so well is that we get to see a different, less readily apparent kind of heroism in George Bailey. Sure, it's easy to notice and admire the swashbuckling valor of a Scarlet Pimpernel or the ""damn the torpedoes"" military bravery of a John Wayne. But the real world doesn't always present opportunities for obvious and flamboyant heroism. More often than not, it presents instead tough value choices that reveal an individual's true priorities--and his true character.It's A Wonderful Life is a testament to the power of free will when the going gets tough. In every instance when George faces adversities, he could easily make the easy choice, opting for the fleeting promise of instant gratification. But instead, he consistently makes the harder decision to delay immediate pleasure in order to achieve or preserve his larger, lasting, most profound values.Today, most people watching the scenes in the building and loan's offices probably cannot quite grasp the bold, life-changing message on the banner that hangs there: ""Own Your Own Home."" But I remember as a kid talking with my father about what it was like for him growing up in a Depression-era coal mining town in West Virginia. ""You had to have at least a fifty percent down payment to buy a home in those days,"" he told me. ""If you were poor, you had to rent."" More than any other movie I've seen, It's A Wonderful Life makes real the enormous benefits of the credit revolution, a tribute to ""man's faith in man.""To Frank Capra, it was men like George Bailey who helped lift the working class into the middle class. Capra considered this film his personal favorite, and put into it a lot of his own experiences as a first-generation immigrant from Sicily. It's A Wonderful Life is his love letter to the American Dream.What makes the movie so credible, and Jimmy Stewart so believable as George Bailey, is that he and Capra had both faced those tough choices just months before it was shot. It's A Wonderful Life was the first movie they worked on after World War II. Shortly after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Stewart joined the U.S. Army Air Force and served as a decorated bomber pilot. Capra spent most of the war shooting the Why We Fight series of propaganda films that proved so crucial to the Allied war effort. Both men could easily have avoided service: Capra was too old when the war began, and Stewart flunked his first physical, being too thin for service. But they put aside the glamorous lifestyle and money Hollywood afforded them for the higher purpose of defending America and freedom. I only wish that such values were held in higher esteem by Americans now, in supporting the war effort against the terrorist threat. Today, we seem less eager to make the kind of hard choices that the men and women of Capra's and Stewart's generation did.The movie's famous climax takes place on Christmas Eve. Bedford Falls awaits the return of its hometown hero--George's brother, Harry Bailey (Todd Karns). As a Navy fighter pilot, Harry saved a transport ship full of American troops by shooting down a Japanese torpedo bomber. However, a few hours before his arrival back home, the building and loan comes up short $8,000. Uncle Billy has absent-mindedly mislaid the money, and now, with the bank examiner and police breathing down his neck, the distraught George sees his entire life coming apart. After fighting Potter all his life, he's reduced to pleading before him, begging to borrow the cash to rescue the building and loan. His only collateral is $500 equity in a life insurance policy. The smirking Potter mocks him, saying, ""Why, George Bailey, you're worth more dead than alive!""George soon finds himself standing alone in the blustery snow atop a bridge, weeping in drunken desperation, thinking about jumping into the icy rapids below.At that very moment, guardian angel Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers) leaps into the river himself, giving George the opportunity to let his inherent goodness emerge once more. George rescues Clarence, then slowly learns the incredible truth: that the old man is an angel sent to protect him.But still believing that his life has been a failure, he informs the eccentric Clarence that he's wasting his time. ""I wish I'd never been born,"" George mumbles bitterly.The words inspire Clarence to grant George his wish. In the film's closing moments, he gives the man a shocking tour of what Bedford Falls would have been like if George Bailey had never existed.The housing subdivision that George envisioned is never built; it becomes ""Potter's Field,"" a graveyard for paupers. The wife of his cabbie friend, Ernie (Frank Faylen), leaves him because Ernie wasted his money paying rent for one of Potter's tenements, instead of investing in his own home. Deprived of the chance to lead a productive life with the building and loan, eccentric Uncle Billy is eventually committed to an insane asylum. George's beloved Mary remains a spinster; their children are never born. And Bedford Falls itself--a small, thriving American community right out of a Norman Rockwell illustration--deteriorates into ""Pottersville,"" a sleazy town full of bars, strip joints, and pawn shops.Most devastating to George, Clarence leads him to his brother Harry's gravestone in Potter's Field.""You're brother, Harry Bailey, broke through the ice, and drowned at the age of nine,"" he informs George.""That's a lie!"" George protests. ""Harry Bailey went to war! He got the Congressional Medal of Honor! He saved the lives of every man on that transport!""""Every man on that transport died,"" Clarence corrects him. ""Harry wasn't there to save them, because you weren't there to save Harry.... You see, George, you really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?""""You have been given a great gift,"" Clarence adds. ""A chance to see what the world would be like without you.""As I do every Christmas, this year I'll again be watching It's A Wonderful Life with my family. I'll once more share with my loved ones Frank Capra's timeless tale of a man who always remained loyal to his highest and dearest values, and who ennobled the lives of everyone he touched through his common sense, farsighted thinking, and uncommon integrity.To those who might dismiss George's story as not the stuff of epic heroism, I can only repeat the director's own words. Decades after It's a Wonderful Life first appeared, Frank Capra said: ""The importance of the individual is the theme that it tells. That no man is a failure, that every man has something to do with his life. If he's born, he's born to do something.""He added: ""To some of us, all that meets the eye is larger than life, including life itself. Who can match the wonder of it?""",5,It Was Indeed a Wonderful Life!,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,13677,"['What', 'would', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'season', 'be', 'Frank', 'Capra', '1946', 'classic',

A  man is framed by the local capitalist in Bedford Falls who wants to put his hands on the business this man manages to the sole benefit of his clients. His whole life was a fight against injustice, against greed, against inhuman capitalists who consider other men as mere toys on their chessboard. He is led to the envy to commit suicide. But God sends an angel to save him. The method is simple : grant his wish, temporarily, not to have been born. And we have a trip in this society the way it would be if the greedy capitalist, Mr Potter, had not had our hero as a fighting counterpart. The vision of this would-be world is drastic and absolutely dramatic. The worse sides of every man have found the proper environment to prosper and build an unethical world especially by expelling all those who had a moral sense. He then has the possibility to go back to his real life and he discovers that he can escape bankrupcy and all it means for his clients thanks to his friends, nearly the whole population of Bedford Falls who give him the little money thay can find for him to go through this difficult situation and prevent Mr Potter from putting his claws on the city. Capitalism is a fighting tool for those who want to unite against greed and to join forces and will to promote a better world. This trick of seeing what the world would be if the greedy had the upper hand was used in many other films, for one the Back to the Future trilogy. This film is also a tremendous boost for those who doubt the outcome of their fight against immoral powerful people : fight and fight again and never forget that  no man is a failure who has friends . It is true it is hard at times to see it, but yet any rockbottom despair is not worth dying since it would give an easy victory to the immoral band of people who take advantage of capitalism to impose their will and greed over the whole world.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,A fighting life is better than death,1022630400,"05 29, 2002",2002,1985,"['film', 'been', 'used', 'even', 'overused', 'model', 'many', 'others', 'man', 'framed', 'local', 'capitalist', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'who', 'put', 'hands', 'business', 'man', 'sole', 'benefit', 'clients', 'whole', 'life', 'was', 'fight', 'injustice', 'greed', 'inhuman', 'capitalists', 'who', 'consider', 'other', 'men', 'mere', 'toys', 'chessboard', 'led', 'envy', 'commit', 'suicide', 'God', 'angel', 'save', 'method', 'simple', 'grant', 'wish', 'temporarily', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'have', 'trip', 'society', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'greedy', 'capitalist', 'Mr', 'Potter', 'had', 'not', 'had', 'hero', 'fighting', 'counterpart', 'vision', 'would-be', 'world', 'drastic', 'absolutely', 'dramatic', 'worse', 'sides', 'man', 'have', 'found', 'proper', 'environment', 'prosper', 'build', 'unethical', 'world', 'especially', 'expelling', 'who', 'had', 'moral', 'sense', 'then', 'possibility', 'go', 'back', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'escape', 'bankrupcy', 'clients', 'thanks', 'friends', 'nearly', 'whole', 'population', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'who', 'give', 'little', 'money', 'thay', 'can', 'find', 'go', 'difficult', 'situation', 'prevent', 'Mr', 'Potter', 'putting', 'claws', 'city', 'Capitalism', 'fighting', 'tool', 'who', 'want', 'unite', 'greed', 'join', 'forces', 'will', 'promote', 'better', 'world', 'trick', 'seeing', 'what', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'greedy', 'had', 'upper', 'hand', 'was', 'used', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'one', 'Back', 'Future', 'trilogy', 'film', 'also', 'tremendous', 'boost', 'who', 'doubt', 'outcome', 'fight', 'immoral', 'powerful', 'people', 'fight', 'fight', 'again', 'never', 'forget', 'man', 'failure', 'who', 'friends', 'true', 'hard', 'times', 'see', 'yet', 'rockbottom', 'despair', 'not', 'worth', 'dying', 'would', 'give', 'easy', 'victory', 'immoral', 'band', 'people', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'capitalism', 'impose', 'will', 'greed', 'whole', 'world.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

All 132 minutes (2 hours,12 minutes) are here.  No scratching, no popping and no skipping of footage.  The print is crystal-clear in beautiful black & white.  Special features on this DVD is the original theatrical trailer.  Also includes the 1990 featurette ""The Making Of It's A Wonderful Life"", hosted by Tom Bosley.  This featurette includes several interesting tidbits of information about special effects used, surprise casting and locations.  There are interviews of Frank Capra, James Stewart and Sheldon Leonard.  Another featurette is ""A Personal Remembrance"". A 1991 special tribute to Frank Capra, hosted by Frank Capra Jr. There is an interview with James Stewart.  A bit of trivia I would like to share is Larry Simms (who played ""Pete Bailey"") and Danny Mummert (who played ""Little Marty Hatch"") are also in this film , but not in a scene together.  They, of course, both worked closely together in the ""BLONDIE"" film series from 1938-1950.In the cast: Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, Henry Travers, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame, Frank Albertson, Todd Karns, Charles Lane, Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer, Dick Elliott, Ellen Corby, Larry Simms, Karolyn Grimes, Jimmy Hawkins, Carol Coombs, Danny Mummert, Lillian Randolph, William Edmunds, John Indrisano, Charles Sullivan, Max Wagner, Sheldon Leonard.Coca-Cola is seen in this film. It is on the hang-over lamps in Mr. Gower's Drug Store and later on a sign when Jimmy Stewart runs in downtown Bedford Falls.Remake:  One tv-movie I would highly recommend is IT HAPPENED ONE CHRISTMAS  (1977).

Well, the answer is that the color and details in this colorized version are almost perfect and far more impressive than the black-and-white copy. That's even though the re-mastered B&W version of the movie is fine, too.  If Mary Bailey (played by Donna Reed) were to see the color version she would say, again: ""It's a miracle.""  Try as we could my wife and I couldn't find anything wrong with the colorization.  Details on human faces are incredible--shadows where there should be shadows, beard stubble on the despairing George Bailey (played by Jimmy Stewart), etc.  The only question we might have would be how Mary Bailey got her Hollywood sun tan living in Bedford Falls?  But we've wondered that before in the re-mastered, B&W version.  Other aspects in this rendering are just outstanding, too, like color posters of the South Pacific in the Baileys' honeymoon suite, colors of Ernie's taxicab, birds in the trees and on window ledges, colors of flowers, grass, trees, snow, women's dresses, men's ties, and on and on.  We'd venture to say that once you've seen the colorized version you'll never bother with the black-and-white copy again.  Special features include introductions and analyses by Tom Bosley and Frank Capra, Jr.  These were done in the early-1990's and even have a Frank Capra, Sr. interview shortly before his death.  If you or a friend are feeling down we have this advice: get this production and watch it.  You'll feel better right away.

39765,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,0782002064,J. Michael Click,"[69, 77]","A beautifully crafted film that proved to be the apex of triple Oscar-winner (1934, 1936, 1938) Frank Capra's distinguished career, and the epitome of his cycle of works celebrating the &quot;common man&quot;.  Mr. Deeds found himself suddenly wealthy, Mr. Smith went to Washington as a Senator, and John Doe became the focus of a socio-political movement; but &quot;Life&quot;'s George Bailey never distinguishes himself outside of his small hometown of Bedford Falls --- his brother Harry is the one who becomes a war hero, and his friend Sam Wainwright is the one who achieves financial success.  George's triumph is simply his personal integrity, his code of ethics, and his strength of character --- his goodness, if you will --- during the unexciting course of his ordinary, mundane existence.  In this respect, George is more an Everyman than any other Capra protagonist, inviting strong audience identification and response.In one of the most exquisite performances ever given in an American film, James Stewart is superb as George.  It's not an easy role to play because so much screen time is spent focusing on George's subtle reactions to the world around him.  One incredible moment  comes at the train station when George slowly begins to absorb the news of his brother's recent marriage and new career opportunity, and how his brother's fortune will destroy his own hopes of leaving Bedford Falls and the family business.  Stewart's face is extraordinary in this scene, as surprised realization fades into quiet disappointment and finally, gentle graciousness and acceptance.  Stewart's tour de force is given strong support by a superb cast of Capra stalwarts, including Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, H. B. Warner, and the phenomenal Beulah Bondi (as George's mother).  And Donna Reed, in one of her first romantic leading roles after a number of years playing supporting ingenues and bits, is excellent in the warm but unglamorous role of George's loving wife, Mary.The Republic Home Video DVD is definitely the edition of this classic to own.  Like the LaserDisc before it, the DVD offers a crystal clear, beautifully restored film-to-video transfer  which will amaze and delight anyone who is familiar only with the horrible multi-generational VHS cassettes, or the awful  colorized version, that were commonly screened back in the late 1970's and 1980's.  There are some nice bonus features on the DVD, including a &quot;making of&quot; documentary and the theatrical trailer.  This is one DVD that you'll never regret adding to your home theatre collection!Trivia note:  If you're a fan of this movie, try finding a copy of film historian David Thomson's 1985 novel &quot;Suspects&quot; which  continues George's story and relates the characters from this movie to many others (did you know that Donna Reed's &quot;Mary Bailey&quot; is actually the sister of Gene Tierney's &quot;Laura&quot;?!, etc.) ... great fun!",5,Capra's and Stewart's Personal Bests,977875200,"12 27, 2000",2000,2940,"['beautifully', 'crafted', 'film', 'proved', 'be', 'apex', 'triple', 'Oscar-winner', '1934', '1936', '1938', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'distinguished', 'career', 'epitome', 'cycle', 'works', 'celebrating', 'quot', 'common', 'man', 'quot', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'found', 'suddenly', 'wealthy', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'went', 'Washington', 'Senator', 'John', 'Doe', 'became', 'focus', 'socio-political', 'movement', 'quot', 'Life', 'quot', 'George', 'Bailey', 'never', 'small', 'hometown', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'brother', 'Harry', 'one', 'who', 'war', 'hero', 'friend', 'Sam', 'Wainwright', 'one', 'who', 'financial', 'success', 'George', 'triumph', 'simply', 'personal', 'integrity', 'code', 'ethics', 'strength', 'character', 'goodness', 'will', 'unexciting', 'course', 'ordinary', 'mundane', 'existence', 'respect', 'George', 'more', 'Everyman', 'other', 'Capra', 'protagonist', 'inviting', 'strong', 'audience', 'identification', 'response.In', 'one', 'most', 'exquisite', 'performances', 'ever', 'given', 'American', 'film', 'James', 'Stewart', 'superb', 'George', 'not', 'easy', 'role', 'play', 'because', 'so', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'spent', 'focusing', 'George', 'subtle', 'reactions', 'world', 'One', 'incredible', 'moment', 'train', 'station', 'when', 'George', 'slowly', 'absorb', 'news', 'brother', 'recent', 'marriage', 'new', 'career', 'opportunity', 'how', 'brother', 'fortune', 'will', 'destroy', 'own', 'hopes', 'leaving', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'family', 'business', 'Stewart', 'face', 'extraordinary', 'scene', 'surprised', 'realization', 'fades', 'quiet', 'disappointment', 'finally', 'gentle', 'graciousness', 'acceptance', 'Stewart', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'given', 'strong', 'support', 'superb', 'cast', 'Capra', 'stalwarts', 'including', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'H.', 'B.', 'Warner', 'phenomenal', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'George', 'mother', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'one', 'first', 'romantic', 'leading', 'roles', 'number', 'years', 'playing', 'supporting', 'ingenues', 'bits', 'excellent', 'warm', 'unglamorous', 'role', 'George', 'loving', 'wife', 'Mary.The', 'Republic', 'Home', 'Video', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'edition', 'classic', 'own', 'LaserDisc', 'DVD', 'crystal', 'clear', 'beautifully', 'restored', 'film-to-video', 'transfer', 'will', 'amaze', 'delight', 'anyone', 'who', 'familiar', 'only', 'horrible', 'multi-generational', 'VHS', 'cassettes', 'awful', 'colorized', 'version', 'were', 'commonly', 'screened', 'back', 'late', '1970', '1980', 'are', 'nice', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'including', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'documentary', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'one', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'never', 'regret', 'adding', 'home', 'theatre', 'collection', 'Trivia', 'note', ""'re"", 'fan', 'movie', 'try', 'finding', 'copy', 'film', 'historian', 'David', 'Thomson', '1985', 'novel', 'quot', 'Suspects', 'quot', 'George', 'story', 'characters', 'movie', 'many', 'others', 'did', 'know', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'quot', 'Mary', 'Bailey', 'quot', 'actually', 'sister', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'quot', 'Laura', 'quot', 'etc', 'great', 'fun']",N/A

39772,A10ODC971MDHV8,0782002064,John Farr,"[1, 1]","The quintessential Frank Capra film and a heartwarming holiday treat year in and year out, ""Life"" is the ultimate optimistic statement on the value of love, life, and community. Capra's masterful handling of the bittersweet storyline--in which Bailey sacrifices his own dreams to run the family savings-and-loan business and keep his hometown of Bedford Falls out of Potter's greedy paws--is pure Hollywood magic. Reed and Barrymore give exceptional performances, but Stewart, in one of his all-time great roles (a personal favorite), is the dynamic, all-too-human force holding it all together.

Do I have a new perspective on ""Wonderful Life""?  Maybe, but I doubt it, but here goes:  It has often struck me how ""Wonderful Life"" is sort of the inversion and distorted reflection of ""A Christmas Carol"".George Bailey and Ebenezer Scrooge - can any two characters be more diametrically opposed? George is kind-hearted, thoughtful of others, beloved by the citizenry; Ebenezer is uncaring, misanthropic, and treated with fearful disregard.  The only thing they seem to have in common is that both are industrious and, surprisingly, both dissatisfied with their lots.  However, although rich with public esteem, George admits his despondent dissatisfaction with his relatively ""poor"" financial status. Conversely, although rich with material goods, Ebenezer harbors dissatisfaction with his relatively poor social/human status, that is, his alienation, though he will hardly admit this.  In a subtle, distorted way, George and Ebenezer kinda want what the other has - the only difference is, ironically, what Ebenezer subconsciously wants is better than what George wants.Of course, both men receive spiritual intervention and of course, get a glimpse of their futures.  Only difference is, George receives a vision of what the future would be if he did not continue his altruistic ways, while Scrooge receives a vision of what the future would be if he DID continue his selfish, parsimonious ways.  For both men, both visions promise stark oblivion (in different ways, of course).  Both men's future visions, for different reasons, convince them that selfless interaction with society is the path to bliss; George just needed to be reminded of it, while Ebenezer needed a remedial course.Therefore, in my opinion, many parallelisms and common themes exist between ""Wonderful Life"" and ""Christmas Carol"" besides the obvious fact that both tales are Christmas (and universal) classics.",5,"""A Christmas Carol"" Inversion",1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,2130,"['Here', 'am', 'just', 'reviewer', 'acknowledging', 'immortal', 'significance', 'gritty', 'sentimental', 'sometimes', 'harsh', 'more', 'often', 'joyous', 'deliberate', 'life-affirming', 'treasure', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'hereafter', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Do', 'have', 'new', 'perspective', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Maybe', 'doubt', 'here', 'often', 'struck', 'how', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'sort', 'inversion', 'distorted', 'reflection', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', '.George', 'Bailey', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'can', 'two', 'characters', 'be', 'more', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'George', 'kind-hearted', 'thoughtful', 'others', 'beloved', 'citizenry', 'Ebenezer', 'uncaring', 'misanthropic', 'treated', 'fearful', 'disregard', 'only', 'thing', 'seem', 'have', 'common', 'are', 'industrious', 'surprisingly', 'dissatisfied', 'lots', 'However', 'rich', 'public', 'esteem', 'George', 'despondent', 'dissatisfaction', 'relatively', 'poor', 'financial', 'status', 'Conversely', 'rich', 'material', 'goods', 'Ebenezer', 'harbors', 'dissatisfaction', 'relatively', 'poor', 'social/human', 'status', 'alienation', 'will', 'hardly', 'admit', 'subtle', 'distorted', 'way', 'George', 'Ebenezer', 'kinda', 'want', 'what', 'other', 'only', 'difference', 'ironically', 'what', 'Ebenezer', 'subconsciously', 'better', 'what', 'George', 'wants.Of', 'course', 'men', 'receive', 'spiritual', 'intervention', 'course', 'get', 'glimpse', 'futures', 'Only', 'difference', 'George', 'vision', 'what', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'did', 'not', 'continue', 'altruistic', 'ways', 'Scrooge', 'vision', 'what', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'DID', 'continue', 'selfish', 'parsimonious', 'ways', 'men', 'visions', 'promise', 'stark', 'oblivion', 'different', 'ways', 'course', 'men', 'future', 'visions', 'different', 'reasons', 'convince', 'selfless', 'interaction', 'society', 'path', 'bliss', 'George', 'just', 'needed', 'be', 'reminded', 'Ebenezer', 'needed', 'remedial', 'course.Therefore', 'opinion', 'many', 'parallelisms', 'common', 'themes', 'exist', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'obvious', 'fact', 'tales', 'are', 'Christmas', 'universal', 'classics']",N/A

It should have won all the Academy Awards itwas nominated for. George Bailey (James Stewart) is just a ordinary small town man who when he was a child he had dreams of being famous and building things and travel around the world. Through life's events he never sets foot outside of Bedford Falls. On Christmas Eve, c. 1945, he becomes depressed that he fears he has misplaced $8000 to pay off a defecit. The meanest man in town, Henry F. Potter who tried to ruin George all his life, won't help him at all. George came crawling to the wrong person. George makes an attempt at suicide, but is saved thanks to his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody A-S-2 (angel second class). He shows George who wishes he had never been born at all, what life and the town would be without him. Things are different in multiple ways. It drives George crazy, until he can't take it any longer and asks for his life back. It almost brings a tear to your eye when George is sobbing on the bridge and says ""Please, God, let me live again."" Bert the cop finds him and George he realizes Bert knows him, his mouth is bleeding and finds everything the way it was before, and realizes how happy he was and how many lives he touched and just about everything wouldn't be the same without him. He really did have a wonderful life! His wife and childhood friend, Mary (Donna Reed) arranges all of George's friends, quite a whole lot, to help George out. Indeed, it is true that no man is a failure who has friends.

Because everyone and their dog has seen the film eight trillion times (and usually in pathetically rendered public domain prints- more on that later,too many people take this beautiful film for granted.Suprisingly dark, and hard hitting, Capra as a director pulls very few punches with this, his greatest work. Many have critisized the film as cliched and over sentimental. Maybe that's true, but this film earns all the real emotions it conjures in the audience's eyes. It populates its narrative with animals of all stripes. The irredeemable Mr. Potter is such an example.Everyone, male and female, adult and child alike, needs to find the beauty in the everyday experience and in the truth that our lives entertwine with all those around us. We cannot expect life to ever be perfect. We often sacrifice our dreams and hopes frequently to the better of those around us. &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; stands as a testiment to man's determination to find his/her place in the world. This film is a sterling example of how, no matter how much we would like to fool ourselves into believing the opposite, we are all part of a larger soul, a soul that belongs to everyone (aplogies to John Steinbeck).Capra's characters are filled with rage, lust, doubt, sadness, temptation. He also fills them with temperance, love, forgiveness and faith. Every character in this film is fully three drawn and complex.Perhaps no character more so than Jimmy Stewart's everyman, George Bailey. Simply put, George Bailey is one of the all time greatest performances ever put on film. George's complete and utter evololution from gangly teenager to redeemed adult and everything in between stands as a perfect example of film acting. Stewart's performance is as well rounded, shaded and empathetic as anything Brando ever did. Stewart literally opens himself up with a straighrazor in this film and gives his audience complete and full access to his (and therefore, our) very soul(s). Stewart proves with this film, that he was America's consumate leading man (Denzel Washington has perhaps come the closest to taking his place).The cinematography radiates in vivid detail throughout this gloriously remastered DVD. For all of those who have strained to watch this film through the scratches and poor contrast over the years, this DVD is one of the great Christmas presents. The silver, black and white photography looks as if Ansel Adams himself had decided to chuck the Southwest in favor of switching places with Norman Rockwell. Capra's sense of framing really shines throughout.Along with &quot;American Beauty&quot; (the subtle, but present similarities are astounding!)&quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; stands as one of the most beautiful portrayals of Human life. It remains as fresh the 100th viewing as it does the first.

In a world that grows increasingly hostile and bitter, it's good to know that the film's message of the values of love, friendship, and self-worth still sticks.""It's a Wonderful Life"" follows the trials of George Bailey (played by a superb James Stewart).  He's got the brains, he's got the talent, and he's itching to leave his hometown and conquer the world.  But circumstance-or fate, rather-always gets in George's way.  While everyone else takes off and makes it big, George is stuck working at Bailey Buildings & Loan, defending his community against greedy miser Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore).  And to meet this end, George turns down all outside opportunities.  Though he marries longtime friend Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and starts a family, he still craves his friends' success.  Now on the verge of scandal and ruin, George's frustration takes its toll, and he considers taking his own life.  Eventually, guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) comes along and gives George a rare gift-a chance to see what the world would be like without him.George's life of self-sacrifice seems to imply that good will toward men may not be the best philosophy, a theme that has earned the film its fair share of disdain.  The tone may remind viewers of Ursula LeGuin's ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas,"" or ""Death of a Salesman.""  But director Frank Capra and his cast helped to raise the mood from dispair to happiness slowly but flawlessly, as George soon realizes his worth to the world and to his loved ones, as well as his love for both.

This is a great version of the classic, and they have cleaned up the product quite a bit from the television that is aired each year.  There are two versions included.  One is the classical black and white version, and the other is a color version.  I know what you are thinking, a color version??  Yes.  I did not think this was something worth even viewing as it takes away from the classic feel and original movie.  Boy was I wrong.I thought the picture was very clean, and the color that was added to the color version was dulled down to look as if it was really part of the original film.  I thought this was very well done, and gave it more of a warm feeling.  Take into consideration though that both versions are still in the 4:3 format.  So you will still have large black bar on the sides.  But I was amazed with how much clearer the picture was than the original TV aired version.  Not to mention the story of this timeless classic.It is a story that life is not all about the little things that we seem to focus on far to much of these days.  That life is about friends and what you put into the world around you, and about how wonderful life really can be if you take the time to realize it.

This man is George Bailey (James Stewart). He is a victim of  his business rival's dishonesty and he faces bankruptcy and jail. George is desperate, he wishes, he never was born. Many people pray for George. Their prayers have been heard and  Angel Clarence is sent to save him. On completion of this mission  Clarence will be honored with angel's wings. On Christmas Eve, George contemplates jumping from a bridge in the freezing waters of a river. That will kill him for sure but Clarence has a plan. He jumps first and George has no choice but to save him. Then Clarence decides to show George what would've  happen if he wasn't born in the first place. Not a pretty picture- too many people would have been affected in a bad way. This is when George Bailey realizes that life is a precious gift and it is wrong to throw it away.It's A Wonderful Life is a deeply touching movie. There are dark moments when the tragedy evolves but the film is not depressing. It blends masterfully drama and humor, love, friendship and hatred  and its climax is the most memorable and inspirational ever! It's A  Wonderful Life ranks #1 on the American Film Institute's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time and it is truly THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FILM OF ALL TIME because it caries the most important message that WE WERE NOT BORN TO BE A FAILURE. The message is delivered by James Stewart, who was not only a brilliant actor but a living proof of the above- everything he did was success! George Bailey is one of Jimmy Stewart's finest performances. He is superb in portraying George's emotional roll-a-coaster: the enthusiasm  of a young, small-town guy, who wants to conquer the world; the strength of an industrious businessman fighting competitor, who doesn't play fair; the devotion of a loving son, brother, husband and father and the despair of a man, who has lost the battle and sees killing himself the only possible remedy.Those who criticize the film simply waste their efforts. It's A Wonderful Life stood the test of the harshest of all critics-TIME! For 60 years it entertains, moves, inspires and it is the ultimate Christmas film of millions of people. Perhaps it would be better if the ""critics"" shut up and let us listen to the bells, that ring at the end of the movie to  celebrate LIFE- the greatest of all gifts!The 60 Anniversary Edition is definitely Black&White; copy and  thanks God for it, because this is how it should be! I do not believe that making it colorized will benefit the movie. You can not improve something that is perfect, why bother then? May be the ""artists`s"" next project will be colorizing Schindler's List?!  Why not, it is B&W;?  Well, they should ask Steven Spielberg if he would be happy about it.

39807,A3FY3H6F4249E0,0782002064,Kathy W,"[8, 9]","This is truly my all time favorite movie.  It's a story about an ordinary man who works hard all his life, giving up his dreams to help others.  When all of a sudden, some disagreeable things start to happen to him(serious things), and it appears he will be disgraced in front of his family, friends, and the whole town, and through no fault of his own.  So he gets desperate and considers suicide.  Just as he's about to do the deed, an unlikely looking angel, named Clarence, shows up to help him.  Since the man thinks his life has so little value, Clarence decides to show the man just how much his life really matters--WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF THE MAN HAD NEVER BEEN BORN.  In effect, the man had a tremendous effect on the lives of so many others.  I don't want to tell you too much, because I want you to see the movie ""fresh"" if you've never seen it.Forget the fact that this is a Christmas classic, a fantastic story & script, and is chocked full of fine actors, like the incredible Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, and others.  The most awesome part of this movie to me is the concept that each life touches so many others, and in ways you would never even think of most of the time.  We never stop to think that the stranger, or friend, or co-worker we said a kind word to, or smiled at today, might have undergone such incredible pain, and we just helped them out.  This movie reinforces the idea that doing kind deeds for others can make a profound difference in their lives.That's why I love this movie so much.  You will probably never know the difference you've made in the lives of most.  I've been fortunate enough to have a few people come back to me and remind me of some simple little nothing things I did for them that positively affected their lives.  Most of those things, I didn't even remember doing!I actually remember a lady I helped who said she was considering suicide.  Was she serious?  I hope not, but she said she was.So, are you trying to make the world a little better as you travel your path?  You don't have to be Mother Theresa to make a difference.  Just making someone laugh today can be a big deal to them, especially if things are really bad for them right now. After all, laughter is the medicine of the angels.So, if you've never seen this movie, GET IT!  Watch it and discover a very profound message within the movie--What difference am I making?  Is anyone's life different because I was born?  Then reassess.  If you have seen this movie, buy it anyway, and watch it at least once a year at Christmastime to remind yourself of this concept, to make a positive difference in the world.More than ever before, WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS NOW IS LOVE, SWEET LOVE!Feel it, breathe it, make it a part of your life!

In fact, I think it's an awesome movie to watch anytime you're feeling down & depressed - as it reminds us that no matter how bad it gets, our lives do have meaning - that other people DO benefit from our being alive...""It's a Wonderful Life"" is about the life of George Bailey (played by James Stewart) - a man who grew up in a small town where everyone knows everyone.  It takes place on Christmas Eve when, due to his thwarted dreams & a looming scandal, he decides that the only ""way out"" is to commit suicide...However, his suicide attempt fails due to some help from an angel (played by Henry Travers) - a very ""human"" angel who's trying to ""earn his wings"".  This ""angel"" decides that the best way to show George that his life DOES have meaning is to show him what life in Bedford Falls (his small town) would have been like if he was never born.  He's taken to the homes of all the people whose lives he touched, and shown where they'd be now if there had never been a ""George Bailey"".Through this experience, George finally realizes the amazing, positive impact he really had on these people, and on this town.  At this point, he decides to ""choose life"" - it's a beautiful moment!!!Overall, this is a wonderful, touching, important movie.  As I said before, it leads one to ponder the difference they've made in the lives of their loved ones - and even the lives of ""strangers"".

We go from house to house and overhear people pray for a man named George Bailey. Something is wrong, but nobody knows what it is. All they know is that he's in trouble.Suddenly the camera focuses on the stars in the sky, and we overhear the voice of God telling a man named Clarence that he must go down to earth and help George Bailey out. If he succeeds in his mission, Clarence will get his wings and become an angel.In the next hour and 30 minutes the movie focuses on George's childhood, his job, his future plans, and his marriage to Mary (Donna Reed).Towards the end of the movie, George's uncle missplaces $8,000 and George must find the money or he will go to jail. George panics and tries to kill himself, that's where Clarence comes in.Next George finds out what life would be like if he had never been born. He then freaks out, and demands that Clarence return him back to the way things were.Anyway, life turns out great when George returns and Clarence gets his wings.I'm sure everybody has seen that little clip of, ""Look daddy teacher says everytime a bell rings an angel gets his wings!""Oh, one last thing if you look closely at the scene where George agrees to dance with Mary at Harry's highschool graduation you will see that Mary's date is ""Alfalfa"" from the original Little Rascals.``Katrina",5,Bring out the tissue,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,1646,"['What', 'would', 'happen', 'were', 'given', 'gift', 'seeing', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'question', 'answered', 'George', 'Bailey', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'one', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'end', 'life', 'missing', 'money.At', 'beginning', 'movie', 'see', 'birds', 'eye', 'view', 'small', 'town', 'Bedford', 'go', 'house', 'house', 'overhear', 'people', 'pray', 'man', 'named', 'George', 'Bailey', 'Something', 'wrong', 'nobody', 'what', 'know', 'trouble.Suddenly', 'camera', 'stars', 'sky', 'overhear', 'voice', 'God', 'telling', 'man', 'named', 'Clarence', 'must', 'go', 'down', 'earth', 'help', 'George', 'Bailey', 'out', 'mission', 'Clarence', 'will', 'get', 'wings', 'become', 'angel.In', 'next', 'hour', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'George', 'childhood', 'job', 'future', 'plans', 'marriage', 'Mary', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'end', 'movie', 'George', 'uncle', '8,000', 'George', 'must', 'find', 'money', 'will', 'go', 'jail', 'George', 'panics', 'tries', 'kill', 'where', 'Clarence', 'in.Next', 'George', 'out', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'then', 'out', 'Clarence', 'return', 'back', 'way', 'things', 'were.Anyway', 'life', 'out', 'great', 'when', 'George', 'returns', 'Clarence', 'wings.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everybody', 'seen', 'little', 'clip', 'Look', 'teacher', 'everytime', 'bell', 'angel', 'wings', 'Oh', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'look', 'closely', 'scene', 'where', 'George', 'dance', 'Mary', 'Harry', 'highschool', 'graduation', 'will', 'see', 'Mary', 'date', 'Alfalfa', 'original', 'Little', 'Rascals.', 'Katrina']",N/A

My normally cynical heart usually balks at these kinds of uplifting movies with its feel-good endings that either seem tacked on or just plain false (heck, I'm one of the few that disliked the recent FINDING NEVERLAND, with its cheesy ""just believe"" philosophy; oh, and I'm not too keen on the engineered ""Christmas spirit"" either). But maybe I'm just a sucker for movies in which ordinary men like George Bailey find themselves so disappointed in their lives that they must be reminded---as indeed he is, in genuinely heartwarming fashion---how much of a difference they truly made in the ordinary world. Akira Kurosawa's IKIRU had a similar theme, and I was moved to tears by parts of that movie too (although some of it was admittedly sentimental and slick). And remember the ending of Alexander Payne's ABOUT SCHMIDT, with Jack Nicholson's character feeling worthless until he picks up a letter from a little kid in another part of the world? That final shot of Nicholson welling up with tears is comparable to the final scene of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, in which nearly an entire town congregates in George Bailey's house to remind him of what  an important man he truly is in the small town of Bedford Falls. Who doesn't want to feel important in some way? And that final quote from Clarence: ""no man is a failure who has friends."" Truly a maxim to live by, if you ever feel down about yourself and your place in the world!As you can probably tell, then, I love this movie. Director Frank Capra never seems to be pushing for audience goodwill the way he did towards the end of his 1938 Oscar-winning YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU; this is probably Capra's masterpiece. And James Stewart, as the American Everyman George Bailey, gives a performance that is stunning in its wide emotional range. You can see why people would like him, and yet you can feel the disappointment he feels in himself.

39826,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,0782002064,Larry Benjamin,"[1, 1]","The center of the film is Jimmy Stewart's remarkable portrayal of George Bailey - he allows us to admire his courage and persistence, to sympathize with his frustration, and rejoice in his redemption. Given the number of reviews here, I feel no need to delve further into the film's plot or execution. I would like to point out a few irrelevant issues concerning the Clarence Oddbody character:Angels are not dead people; they are an entirely separate race of beings. This was taken for granted for thousands of years. Suddenly, in early 20th Century America, &#34;angels&#34; became the souls of the departed in Heaven, wearing white robes, floating through the clouds playing harps, with golden rings floating horizontally above their heads. The &#34;halo&#34; is supposed to be the visible aura of highly spiritually developed persons, typically most easily seen around the head as it would have been concentrated there, as well as being positioned at eye level. The halo is found in many religious traditions. Attempts to depict it in sculpture resulted in its morphing into a disk or ring behind or above the subject's head. Fortunately, Clarence is supposed to pass for a living human in the film, so he lacks this ridiculous ornament. The phrase &#34;every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings&#34; is a bit of authentic-sounding folklore unique to this movie.Clock and watchmaking around the time of Clarence's life and death (supposedly the 18th Century) was most highly developed in England. Later, American companies such as Hamilton, Bulova, Gruen, and others produced the finest watches in the world through the middle of the 20th Century. Surprisingly, Swiss watches were not considered high quality until comparatively recently - even in the 1960s, Hamilton was putting out a budget line of watches with Swiss inner workings, similar to a modern maker using Chinese mechanisms. The rise of the Swiss watch industry is sheer marketing brilliance virtually unequaled by any other product. In any event, clock and watchmaking in Clarence's time would have required knowledge of mathematics and precision engineering, an unlikely field for a sweet but somewhat slow fellow like Clarence (&#34;He's got the mind of a rabbit&#34;).But these are minor quibbles, and hardly detract from the overall excellence and enjoyment of &#34;It's a Wonderful Life.&#34;",5,A few unrelated observations,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,2372,"['center', 'film', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'remarkable', 'portrayal', 'George', 'Bailey', 'admire', 'courage', 'persistence', 'sympathize', 'frustration', 'rejoice', 'redemption', 'Given', 'number', 'reviews', 'here', 'feel', 'need', 'delve', 'further', 'film', 'plot', 'execution', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'few', 'irrelevant', 'issues', 'concerning', 'Clarence', 'Oddbody', 'character', 'Angels', 'are', 'not', 'dead', 'people', 'are', 'entirely', 'separate', 'race', 'beings', 'was', 'taken', 'granted', 'thousands', 'years', 'Suddenly', 'early', '20th', 'Century', 'America', '34', 'angels', '34', 'became', 'souls', 'departed', 'Heaven', 'wearing', 'white', 'robes', 'floating', 'clouds', 'playing', 'harps', 'golden', 'rings', 'floating', 'horizontally', 'heads', '34', 'halo', '34', 'supposed', 'be', 'visible', 'aura', 'highly', 'spiritually', 'developed', 'persons', 'typically', 'most', 'easily', 'seen', 'head', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'concentrated', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'positioned', 'eye', 'level', 'halo', 'found', 'many', 'religious', 'traditions', 'Attempts', 'depict', 'sculpture', 'resulted', 'morphing', 'disk', 'ring', 'subject', 'head', 'Fortunately', 'Clarence', 'supposed', 'pass', 'living', 'human', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'ornament', 'phrase', '34', 'time', 'bell', 'rings', 'angel', 'wings', '34', 'bit', 'authentic-sounding', 'folklore', 'unique', 'movie.Clock', 'watchmaking', 'time', 'Clarence', 'life', 'death', 'supposedly', '18th', 'Century', 'was', 'most', 'highly', 'developed', 'England', 'Later', 'American', 'companies', 'such', 'Hamilton', 'Bulova', 'Gruen', 'others', 'produced', 'finest', 'watches', 'world', 'middle', '20th', 'Century', 'Surprisingly', 'Swiss', 'watches', 'were', 'not', 'considered', 'high', 'quality', 'comparatively', 'recently', 'even', '1960s', 'Hamilton', 'was', 'putting', 'out', 'budget', 'line', 'watches', 'Swiss', 'inner', 'workings', 'similar', 'modern', 'maker', 'using', 'Chinese', 'mechanisms', 'rise', 'Swiss', 'watch', 'industry', 'sheer', 'marketing', 'brilliance', 'virtually', 'unequaled', 'other', 'product', 'event', 'clock', 'watchmaking', 'Clarence', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'knowledge', 'mathematics', 'precision', 'engineering', 'unlikely', 'field', 'sweet', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'fellow', 'Clarence', '34', 'got', 'mind', 'rabbit', '34', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'hardly', 'detract', 'overall', 'excellence', 'enjoyment', '34', 'Wonderful', 'Life.', '34']",N/A
39827,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0782002064,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 9]","One Christmas Eve, thirty years ago give or take, I woke up the house because I was watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"" on late night television (which was the only way to see it at that time) and as George Bailey ran back to the bridge to tell Clarence that he wanted to live again the station went to a commercial break.  As Kenneth Burke said a long time ago, form is the creation of an appetite and the satisfying of that appetite in the mind of an audience.  So there I was, getting all ready to start weeping when the snow starts to fall again, and suddenly I am being bombarded with commercials for the sort of projects that are only advertised in the middle of the night.  One reason to own your own copy is that not only can you control the breaks, but you can also watch it any time you need a little Christmas.The general consensus is that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a timeless holiday classic, a black & white movie that NBC is proudly airing tonight on Christmas Eve once again, because of the point that Clarence Oddbody, AS2 makes to George when he tell him, ""Remember, George: no man is a failure who has friends.""  The point is underscored as the film's benediction when Clarence writes that reminder in the copy of Mark Twain's ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" and when Harry Bailey proposes a toast to his big brother George as ""the richest man in town.""  The grand irony here is that the only person who does not know these things ends up being George Bailey himself, and the fact that Jimmy Stewart is perfect in the role does not hurt either.But I would contend that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is also a timeless classic for the simple reason that it makes you cry even more the second time around.  Once you have seen Frank Capra's 1946 film you cannot help but notice how everything in the nightmare sequence is set up earlier in the movie.  Certainly you remember what happened with Mr. Gower and when Harry fell through the ice, but the first time through did you pick when Mary said she married George to keep from being an old maid?  Once you know the story the whole opening litany of prayers (""Something's the matter with daddy"") can get you chocked up.  For me I lose it when young Mary leans over into George's bad ear and says, ""George Bailey, I'll love you 'till the day I die"" (and not because I am deaf in one ear either, but because I am a hopeless romantic).Like so many of the director's classic ""Capra-corn"" films, namely ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"" and ""Meet John Doe,"" the story of George Bailey is basically a crucifixion story.  Voltaire once said that the crucifix represents the wise man assassinated, and in each of those films there is certainly a point where the hero is symbolically crucified in public: to wit, the impeachment in the Senate, the competency hearing, and the mass rally.  But only George Bailey actually descends into Hell as he sees what the world would have been like if he had never been born.  Such stories have become a commonplace on television (""Smallville"" did it for Lex Luthor earlier this month and I have fond memories of the one ""Moonlighting"" did), and there are countless movies in which the main character gets a chance to see the road not taken.  The genre goes back at least to ""A Christmas Carol,"" but whereas Ebenezer Scrooge is the ancestor of Mr. Potter, George Bailey has always lived a good life.  George is so selfless he claims he was the one that lost the money when he goes to Mr. Potter for help.  The guy cannot help but do the right thing.Granted, there are some imperfections in this divine film, just as a Persian carpet always contains a flaw.  For me the initial levity of Clarence as a blinking star is a bit too cute after the stage is set up by the people of Bedford Falls on bended knee entreating for divine intervention for George.  But once Henry Travers shows up as Clarence in person that is rectified (I like the way he tells George, ""You've never been born,"" as if what was about to happen was the most natural thing in the world.  However, the errors I recall now with regards to this film are my own.  The first couple of times I saw the film I thought that Mr. Potter showed up at the end to join in the festivities because the magic of Christmas was such that even his heart grew to the right size.  For years I was convinced that when they are searching Uncle Billy's hovel for the missing money and it looks like somebody will be going to prison that George not only says ""It's not going to be me,"" but adds ""for once in my life it is not going to be me.""The romance between Stewart's George and Donna Reed's Mary stands on its own: you could do a movie that ends with them on their wedding night and have a winner.  Still, the reason that the ending is so glorious is that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" gets really dark before the dawn.  The extreme closeup that Capra shoots of Stewart when the enormity of the fall hits George is absolutely harrowing, as is the terror in his face when the spinster Mary collapses and George has totally lost it, because we understand exactly what that means.  In the end we come back to Clarenece's message because George's only problem is that he does not know this simple and profound truth (and because Mary and the people of Bedford Falls have taken care of the missing money regardless of Clarence's intervention).  That is why this is a wonderful movie.",5,The classic holiday movie that gets better every time you watch it,1135382400,"12 24, 2005",2005,5430,"['One', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago',

39832,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,0782002064,"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are...","[2, 4]","Since I saw this movie several times before, when I decided to see it again I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  One sign of a truly great movie is that you can watch it more than once and enjoy it.  This is a great movie.It cuts to the heart of the question of what makes life worthwhile.  The answer that it gives is that the kind acts that we do, the love we show, are what makes life worth living.I like the way it portrays America as being run by greedy and power hungry men.  The whole world is run by them.  But they don't run everything.  And I believe that the underlying premise of this movie, that there is a Heaven, that there is a God, even that there are angels, is very likely true, and that the purpose of living our lives here is not to amass the greatest fortune before we die.  It's to build bonds of loyalty and love to take home to Heaven with us when we graduate from this school of hard knocks.I don't want to claim that this movie is perfect.  It never pays to do that.  A good review, even if it's a rave, should have some constructive criticism in it.  I haven't seen a perfect movie yet.In that spirit I would say that even though Donna Reed's acting is good as George Bailey's wife, the script writer used her as a cardboard character who never falls off her pedestal.  It was a badly written character, a non-person, just too perfect.  I see no reason for that, considering that the writer showed us George Bailey at his worst, badgering a teacher on the phone, badgering his kids, occasionally being a dope.  The writer should have breathed at least a little life and imperfection into Mrs Bailey too.  She should not have been written as a robot.  She could also have been given a sense of humor.I got a kick out of the cabbie and the cop being named Ernie and Bert.  I understand that the Sesame Street characters were named after them.In today's world, where we only believe what we can see with our own eyes, I think we've lost some truths that are contained in this movie.  I'm not kidding.  I think there are angels, and I think there is a Heaven, and I think that those things are more real than the chair you're sitting on.  We teach our kids to believe in Santa Claus, and then we pull the rug out from under them and let them know Santa isn't real, but I think you will be surprised to find out that Heaven is real, angels are real, and God is real.  I don't think those are just children's stories.I would also disagree with the director's decision to show Jimmy Stewart at his worst.  In a few scenes he is really, and there is no other way of putting it, an obnoxious jerk.  As soon as life deals him some legal trouble, he gets really bad.  I'd prefer my heroes to show a little more poise under pressure, and George Bailey fails miserably in that department.  While Donna Reed is far too goody-goody, with no blood running through her veins, Jimmy Stewart is at times a most unlikeable hero.  We have to remind ourselves that he did save a life or two and make a few sacrifices earlier in life.Another problem I have with this film is that I don't understand how a bank president (isn't that what he is?) and a real estate developer (isn't he that too?) is doing so poorly financially, and why the loss of $6,000 would be so devastating to his savings and loan.  That's a bit much to swallow.  When Uncle Stupid lost the money, I really don't think the roof caves in on a savings and loan.In other words, we are being fed a sob story that can't be real.Lionel Barrymore makes a wonderful villain.  Actually he reminds me of Jim Backus as Mister Magoo, minus the myopia.  He represents the Evil Capitalist, the greedy miser who owns everything.  Did you notice that when George Bailey is removed from the picture, it turns out that Mister Magoo turned his town into a place full of girly shows?  That is so funny.  In those innocent post-war days, the way they painted a bad town was by putting girly shows in it.  Drugs?  Crime?  Of course not.  Those were innocent days.There are times in all our lives that we want to escape our reality, we want to die, we wish we were never born, and so on.  I feel that way a few times a day, actually.  It is comforting to think that it really is important that we lived, that we really did have a good impact on someone.  Did I?  I don't know.  I'm glad for George Bailey's sake that he did.  Now if only he could learn to curb that obnoxious and self centered behavior of his, and be more sensitive to other people's feelings.  Sometimes he's like a child, just popping out with the stupidest and most cutting things.  Good thing he gave us reasons to like him, because it isn't always easy.",5,Timeless classic,1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,4687,"['saw', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'before', 'when', 'decided', 'see', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'One', 'sign', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'enjoy', 'great', 'movie.It', 'cuts', 'heart', 'question', 'what', 'life', 'worthwhile', 'answer', 'kind', 'do', 'love', 'show', 'are', 'what', 'life', 'worth', 'living.I', 'way', 'America', 'being', 'run', 'greedy', 'power', 'hungry', 'men', 'whole', 'world', 'run', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'everything', 'believe', 'underlying', 'premise', 'movie', 'Heaven', 'God', 'even', 'are', 'angels', 'very', 'likely', 'true', 'purpose', 'living', 'lives', 'here', 'not', 'amass', 'greatest', 'fortune', 'die', 'build', 'bonds', 'loyalty', 'love', 'take', 'home', 'Heaven', 'when', 'graduate', 'school', 'hard', 'knocks.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'claim', 'movie', 'perfect', 'never', 'do', 'good', 'review', 'even', 'rave', 'should', 'have', 'constructive', 'criticism', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'perfect', 'movie', 'yet.In', 'spirit', 'would', 'say', 'even', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'acting', 'good', 'George', 'Bailey', 'wife', 'script', 'writer', 'used', 'cardboard', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'pedestal', 'was', 'badly', 'written', 'character', 'non-person', 'just', 'too', 'perfect', 'see', 'reason', 'considering', 'writer', 'showed', 'George', 'Bailey', 'worst', 'badgering', 'teacher', 'phone', 'badgering', 'kids', 'occasionally', 'being', 'dope', 'writer', 'should', 'have', 'breathed', 'least', 'little', 'life', 'imperfection', 'Mrs', 'Bailey', 'too', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'robot', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'sense', 'humor.I', 'got', 'kick', 'cabbie', 'cop', 'being', 'named', 'Ernie', 'Bert', 'understand', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'characters', 'were', 'named', 'them.In', 'today', 'world', 'where', 'only', 'believe', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'think', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'truths', 'are', 'contained', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'think', 'are', 'angels', 'think', 'Heaven', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'more', 'real', 'chair', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'teach', 'kids', 'believe', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'then', 'pull', 'rug', 'let', 'know', 'Santa', ""n't"", 'real', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'Heaven', 'real', 'angels', 'are', 'real', 'God', 'real', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'just', 'children', 'stories.I', 'would', 'also', 'disagree', 'director', 'decision', 'show', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'worst', 'few', 'scenes', 'really', 'other', 'way', 'putting', 'obnoxious', 'jerk', 'As', 'soon', 'life', 'deals', 'legal', 'trouble', 'really', 'bad', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'heroes', 'show', 'little', 'more', 'poise', 'pressure', 'George', 'Bailey', 'miserably', 'department', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'far', 'too', 'goody-goody', 'blood', 'running', 'veins', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'times', 'most', 'unlikeable', 'hero', 'have', 'remind', 'did', 'save', 'life', 'two', 'make', 'few', 'sacrifices', 'earlier', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'bank', 'president', ""n't"", 'what', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', ""n't"", 'that', 'too', 'doing', 'so', 'poorly', 'financially', 'why', 'loss', '6,000', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'devastating', 'savings', 'loan', 'bit', 'much', 'swallow', 'When', 'Uncle', 'Stupid', 'lost', 'money', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'roof', 'savings', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'being', 'fed', 'sob', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'real.Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'wonderful', 'villain', 'Actually', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Mister', 'Magoo', 'minus', 'myopia', 'Evil', 'Capitalist', 'greedy', 'miser', 'who', 'everything', 'Did', 'notice', 'when', 'George', 'Bailey', 'removed', 'picture', 'out', 'Mister', 'Magoo', 'turned', 'town', 'place', 'full', 'girly', 'shows', 'so', 'funny', 'innocent', 'post-war', 'days', 'way', 'painted', 'bad', 'town', 'was', 'putting', 'girly', 'shows', 'Drugs', 'Crime', 'course', 'not', 'were', 'innocent', 'days.There', 'are', 'times', 'lives', 'want', 'escape', 'reality', 'want', 'die', 'wish', 'were', 'never', 'born', 'so', 'feel', 'way', 'few', 'times', 'day', 'actually', 'comforting', 'think', 'really', 'important', 'lived', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'impact', 'someone', 'Did', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'glad', 'George', 'Bailey', 'sake', 'did', 'Now', 'only', 'could', 'learn', 'curb', 'obnoxious', 'centered', 'behavior', 'be', 'more', 'sensitive', 'other', 'people', 'feelings', 'Sometimes', 'child', 'just', 'popping', 'out', 'stupidest', 'most', 'cutting', 'things', 'Good', 'thing', 'gave', 'reasons', 'like', ""n't"", 'always', 'easy']",N/A

Its message, similar to A Christmas Carol, is that a good look at your past deeds will help to put your current world into context. In Scrooge's case, it was his bad past that helps him to create a better future. In this Capra tale, it is the realization that the main character has done a lot of good in the past - and that it really has made a big difference in peoples' lives.I won't give away a lot of plot details here. If you're like most people, you've probably seen this several times over the years and appreciated the nuanced layers of meaning offered by the storyline. If you haven't seen this yet, then most definitely rent or buy it for a viewing, without ""knowing what's coming"".You can say the movie is a bit sappy - but there are times we can all appreciate a bit of sappiness in order to help a message ""go down"" more smoothly. We've all had times in our life that we feel frustrated, that maybe we aren't making a difference.

Once having seen it, you'll not forget its story of encouragement and faith, and in a positive way showing that what goes around truly does come around.George Bailey seems to be a simple man.  In fact, he is a simple man.  Yet, with his solid values and feeling for what is right and wrong, George touches the lives of those around him.  George saves his brother from drowning as a child.  When his brother grows older he shoots down an enemy plane during World War II, saving a transport ship into which the plane was attempting to crash.  George prevents the pharmacist from accidentally giving a young boy poison as the pharmacist grieved for his own son.  George takes on the responsibility for running the Bailey Savings and Loan when his father passes away.  The list of good deeds that George performs is long, and he has not touched so many individual lives as he has an entire town.It seems that while George is not wealthy in terms of money, he leads a full life.  He has a wife and children, and in he is clearly a powerful force for good.  His brother is coming home, a celebrated war hero.  Life could hardly be better.  But then an event occurs that can shake anyone.  Eight thousand dollars is lost on its way to being deposited at the bank.  Suddenly, George Bailey is under suspicion for embezzlement.  Suddenly, all the good deeds that George has performed count for nothing, because George may find himself in prison as repayment for being a good man.George lashes out at those around him.  He has always been the person with the solutions, and suddenly he finds himself in a situation he can't control or solve.  He runs from this unsolvable problem, crashing his car, stumbles to a bridge to commit suicide.  Before George can jump in, someone else jumps in; an angel with a mission.George and the angel, Clarence, talk about George's plight, and during the discussion George wishes he had never existed.  The angel grants George's wish.  During the next portion of the movie we see a Bedford Falls that would have existed had George never lived.  The name of the town is Pottersville and it is full of bars and vice and crime, and many of the houses owned by Mr. Potter are little more than hovels, slums in the making.  The people who George touched live a very different life in this alternate reality.As dark as the movie is at times, at its heart it is a story of hope and miracles.  George is given an opportunity to see the difference he has made in people's lives.  George discovers that while evil has befallen him, the evil that he has personally averted is far worse.  On the small chance you have not seen this movie, I'll not reveal the ending, but you may trust that the ending always brings a smile to my face.The DVD restoration of this classic is excellent, a significant improvement over the numerous poor copies previously available on VHS.

Finally, on one Christmas Eve, as a result of the chicanery of a nasty old grinch type businessman in town, George's business problems, on top of all of his thwarted ambitions, got so bad and he became so despondent that he was on the verge of suicide.Along came an angel named Clarence who had been a bit of a failure in his own right.  He'd never been able to earn his wings and his absolute last chance to earn them was to keep Bailey from committing suicide.  In a sort of reverse version of Dickens' tale of Scrooge seeing the ghosts of his past, present, and future, Bailey's angel showed him what miserable lives his (Bailey's) friends and families would have had had there been no George Bailey...Do you really think that the description of a wonderful life is one in which you never even got a trip around the block and the absolute high point is that you didn't commit suicide?

39843,A1846O71OHWD4H,0782002064,Lorraine Hornig,"[0, 0]","""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of those films that should be at, or close to, the top of anyone's list of ""must-see"" movies. George Bailey (James Stewart) is at the end of his rope and he buys into Mr. Potter's (Lionel Barrymore) opinion that ""he is worth more dead than alive"". As a result of the prayers of his loved ones, George's guardian angel, Clarence (Henry Travers), comes to help. Clarence is somewhat inept as an angel and has only reached the rank of A1C (Angle first class). He has been promised that if he succeeds in helping George through his ""critical night"" he will finally earn his wings. Clarence learns that George, who dreams of traveling the world and becoming an architect, is a kind and generous fellow who constantly puts his dreams on hold when life gets in the way. George appears to take things in stride, especially after he marries Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and becomes the father of four children. But one unfortunate Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) misplaces $8,000 belonging to the Bailey Building and Loan. Even more unfortunate: the bank examiner wants to look at the books. A desparate George Bailey falls apart and in dispair decides to end his life. Enter Clarence...who gives George the ""gift"" of seeing what the world would be like if he had never been born. I don't want to spoil your viewing pleasure by revealing the details. Suffice it to say that there is a meaningful message in this wonderful film...that every life is of vital importance as it impacts every place and person with which it interacts. In addition to James Stewart, Donna Reed, Henry Travers, Lionel Barrymore and Thomas Mitchell the film also boasts wonderful performances by Beulah Bondi (George's mother), Gloria  Grahame (Violet), and H.B. Warner (Mr. Gower). I personally prefer this black & white version.

It is an annual Christmas watch for me, along with ""Scrooge"" to absorb the Season's Spirit.  Overall it has a kind and generous message, although you sometimes feel it is corny, it works.  The main character, George Bailey, is played by Jimmy Stewart .  George has a problem at the bank he manages.  The examiners are there and $8,000 is missing.  A greedy, mean-spirited bank president finds the $8,000 in cash and keeps it to make George's life miserable.  George has  serious problems and contemplates suicide and drives his old car to a  lonely snowy spot on the town's bridge.  His guardian angel  ""Clarence"" played by Henry Travers appears and jumps in before George!  George jumps to rescue him and they end up drying clothes in a small shack together.  George wishes he had never been born and his wish comes true.  Clarence gives him the wish, and tours George through the town as it would have been without him.  It shows how George sacrificed his education for his brother's (who becomes a war hero), he kept the savings and loan going for his family, and  protected the small town from the avarice and greed of Mr. Potter.  George also married his beautiful childhood sweetheart (Donna Reed).  If none of this had happened, the town would have hit bottom and lives would have been wasted.  George saw what might have been and learned his life was important.  In the end, the town came together with plenty of money to save the Savings and Loan and his reputation.

39850,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0782002064,magellan,"[3, 4]","With almost 200 reviews, there probably isn't much I can add to this, but I did want to make a few comments. And one comment I hadn't seen elsewhere since it's more a piece of exotic movie trivia.This great movie has been known to bring tears to the eyes of big, strong men, and I have to admit I'm no different. (In fact, just thinking about the film to write this review sort of brought tears to my eyes). Based on the depression-era short story by Phillip van Doren Stern, Capra uses the humble but uplifting story of George Bailey to bring his hopeful vision of humanity to the silver screen. He not only does justice to the story but produced a movie that transcends the genre to become a timeless story of the human spirit.Stewart turns in probably his most famous performance in the character of George Bailey, a marginally successful but respected and well-liked small-town businessman who had hoped and dreamed of greater things but who is resigned to his humble fate. He'd dreamed of college and travel and a different career from the humble Building and Loan he runs but fate has conspired to give his younger brother the opportunities instead, so George believes life has mostly passed him by.Then disaster strikes, and we see George brought to the brink of suicide and back again, discovering in the process that he really had a great life after all, and that the true meaning of life isn't so much in the accomplishment of outward achievements so much as in how we touch the lives and minds and hearts of others.About that piece of trivia I mentioned. Remember the guy in the bridge toll booth when George tries to commit suicide, and is saved by his guardian angel, played by Henry Travers? This was the guy with the long face and thick crop of wavy hair. It was one of the funnier scenes in the movie, as he reacts to Clarence's revelations to Stewart about being an angel.Anyway, I'm not certain, but I think he appears briefly 10 years later in an uncredited role in the 1958 film, The Big Country, starring Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Charles Bickford, Jean Simmons, Burl Ives, and Chuck Connors. He's the one who asks Peck at the party in the Colonel's house if he's seen anything as big as the country out west. Peck, being a former sea captain, says, ""Why yes, a couple of oceans."" And then he makes the same bewildered expressions as he did back in the toll booth in It's a Wonderful Life. Anyway, whoever he was, he had quite a mug and worked perfectly for these little bit parts, usually playing some local hick or hayseed with a rubber face who could make the most comical expressions. The International Movie Database website credits him as Tom Fadden in It's a Wonderful Life, but not in The Big Country, so I can't say for sure.But getting back to the original movie, I had one more comment, actually a suggestion, for anybody who might be interested in reading an author whose stories have the sort of hopeful, sweetly surrealistic quality of Capra's films, combined with an ironic wit that ranges from gentle to outright vicious. This is author John Welter, and I'd recommend his two books, I Want to Buy a Vowel, and Begin to Exit Here. He has one other novel with the title Night of the Avenging Blowfish, but despite the title, I think the other two are better and would read them first. If you're a Chris Moore, Carl Hiaasen, Tim Dorsey, or Bill Fitzhugh fan also, and are looking for something else, check out these two books by Welter also. He's not as famous as any of the above but deserves to be much better known.",5,The classic--what can I say?,1057536000,"07 7, 2003",2003,3557,"['almost', '200', 'reviews', 'probably', ""n't"", 'much', 'can', 'add', 'did', 'want', 'make', 'few', 'comments', 'one', 'comment', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'more', 'piece', 'exotic', 'movie', 'trivia.This', 'great', 'movie', 'been', 'known', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'big', 'strong', 'men', 'have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'different', 'fact', 'just', 'thinking', 'film', 'write', 'review', 'sort', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Based', 'depression-era', 'short', 'story', 'Phillip', 'van', 'Doren', 'Stern', 'Capra', 'humble', 'uplifting', 'story', 'George', 'Bailey', 'bring', 'hopeful', 'vision', 'humanity', 'silver', 'screen', 'not', 'only', 'justice', 'story', 'produced', 'movie', 'genre', 'become', 'timeless', 'story', 'human', 'spirit.Stewart', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'performance', 'character', 'George', 'Bailey', 'marginally', 'successful', 'respected', 'well-liked', 'small-town', 'businessman', 'who', 'had', 'hoped', 'dreamed', 'greater', 'things', 'who', 'resigned', 'humble', 'fate', ""'d"", 'dreamed', 'college', 'travel', 'different', 'career', 'humble', 'Building', 'Loan', 'fate', 'conspired', 'give', 'younger', 'brother', 'opportunities', 'instead', 'so', 'George', 'life', 'mostly', 'passed', 'by.Then', 'disaster', 'strikes', 'see', 'George', 'brought', 'brink', 'suicide', 'back', 'again', 'discovering', 'process', 'really', 'had', 'great', 'life', 'true', 'meaning', 'life', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'accomplishment', 'outward', 'achievements', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'touch', 'lives', 'minds', 'hearts', 'others.About', 'piece', 'trivia', 'mentioned', 'Remember', 'guy', 'bridge', 'toll', 'booth', 'when', 'George', 'commit', 'suicide', 'saved', 'guardian', 'angel', 'played', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'was', 'guy', 'long', 'face', 'thick', 'crop', 'wavy', 'hair', 'was', 'one', 'funnier', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Clarence', 'revelations', 'Stewart', 'being', 'angel.Anyway', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'think', 'briefly', '10', 'years', 'later', 'uncredited', 'role', '1958', 'film', 'Big', 'Country', 'starring', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'one', 'who', 'Peck', 'party', 'Colonel', 'house', 'seen', 'anything', 'as', 'big', 'country', 'out', 'west', 'Peck', 'being', 'former', 'sea', 'captain', 'Why', 'yes', 'couple', 'oceans', 'then', 'same', 'bewildered', 'expressions', 'did', 'back', 'toll', 'booth', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Anyway', 'whoever', 'was', 'had', 'quite', 'mug', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'little', 'bit', 'parts', 'usually', 'playing', 'local', 'hick', 'hayseed', 'rubber', 'face', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'most', 'comical', 'expressions', 'International', 'Movie', 'Database', 'website', 'credits', 'Tom', 'Fadden', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'not', 'Big', 'Country', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'sure.But', 'getting', 'back', 'original', 'movie', 'had', 'one', 'more', 'comment', 'actually', 'suggestion', 'anybody', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'reading', 'author', 'stories', 'have', 'sort', 'hopeful', 'sweetly', 'surrealistic', 'quality', 'Capra', 'films', 'combined', 'ironic', 'wit', 'gentle', 'outright', 'vicious', 'author', 'John', 'Welter', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'two', 'books', 'Want', 'Buy', 'Vowel', 'Begin', 'Exit', 'Here', 'one', 'other', 'novel', 'title', 'Night', 'Avenging', 'Blowfish', 'title', 'think', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'better', 'would', 'read', 'first', ""'re"", 'Chris', 'Moore', 'Carl', 'Hiaasen', 'Tim', 'Dorsey', 'Bill', 'Fitzhugh', 'fan', 'also', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'else', 'check', 'two', 'books', 'Welter', 'also', 'not', 'as', 'famous', 'above', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'known']",N/A

You'll love watching this on Christmas with your family!The story is about a man, though it first shows him as a boy around 12, named George Bailey. He dreams of adventure, building things, and also traveling. But he is cooped up in his town called Bedford Falls because of business matters and troubles with the meanest and richest man in town called Mr.Potter. When George loses 8000 dollars, which is partly his Uncle Billy's fault, which is somewhat very important and can make him lose everything and go to jail.

Stenroos ""Sibelius fan""","[1, 1]","Detail-wise and depth-of-image-wise, this Blu-Ray improves on the Silver Anniversary Edition DVD that I previously owned (and which I gave to my sister after acquiring the BD). I wasn't happy about losing the extra feature on Frank Capra that was on the DVD, but life is short.This BD generally cleans up the picture we've all seen over the years into a steadier and more-detailed version. However, there are MAJOR problems with the transfer: DNR has been over-employed which adds a glassy look to certain scenes. There's a really bad vertical scratch mark running along the right edge of the film that starts when the now-repentant George Bailey returns to the bridge to pray for help. That scratch runs pretty much through the final 9 minutes of the film, and it's impossible to ignore as one tries to watch the movie as the scratch flickers and changes position. I don't remember that scratch in previous issues, so it's REALLY disappointing to see it on the BD. It's also disappointing to read so many 5-star reviews of this BD, none of which mention these glaring and obvious faults. One wonders if the reviewers even bothered to watch the BD before reviewing.As others have noted, this package includes both the original B&W; and the colorized versions of the film. The scratch I mentioned is very visible in the colorized version as well, though the digital manipulation is less stark in the colorized version than the original B&W.;I suppose this is the BD version we're stuck with until someone at Paramount decides to spruce up the film correctly...which is to say, fix the damn picture! To date, Paramount's efforts have been restricted to gussying up the packaging: first, in 2009, with the BD case wrapped in a sparkling O-ring, and then again in 2011, when they threw in an ornament and some other useless crap in a ""Gift Box"" edition. Both versions include the problematic 2009 mastering discussed herein.You can't tell a book by it's cover, nor - apparently - the transfer of a well-known and -beloved film from the outside packaging.Disappointing, to say the least.",2,Blu-Ray Transfer Not So Good,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,2082,"['Detail-wise', 'depth-of-image-wise', 'Blu-Ray', 'Silver', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'previously', 'owned', 'gave', 'sister', 'acquiring', 'BD', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'losing', 'extra', 'feature', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'was', 'DVD', 'life', 'short.This', 'BD', 'generally', 'up', 'picture', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'steadier', 'more-detailed', 'version', 'However', 'are', 'MAJOR', 'problems', 'transfer', 'DNR', 'been', 'over-employed', 'glassy', 'look', 'certain', 'scenes', 'really', 'bad', 'vertical', 'scratch', 'mark', 'running', 'right', 'edge', 'film', 'when', 'now-repentant', 'George', 'Bailey', 'returns', 'bridge', 'pray', 'help', 'scratch', 'pretty', 'much', 'final', '9', 'minutes', 'film', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'one', 'watch', 'movie', 'scratch', 'flickers', 'changes', 'position', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'scratch', 'previous', 'issues', 'REALLY', 'disappointing', 'see', 'BD', 'also', 'disappointing', 'read', 'so', 'many', '5-star', 'reviews', 'BD', 'none', 'mention', 'glaring', 'obvious', 'faults', 'One', 'reviewers', 'even', 'bothered', 'watch', 'BD', 'reviewing.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'package', 'original', 'B', 'W', 'colorized', 'versions', 'film', 'scratch', 'mentioned', 'very', 'visible', 'colorized', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'digital', 'manipulation', 'less', 'stark', 'colorized', 'version', 'original', 'B', 'W', 'suppose', 'BD', 'version', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'someone', 'Paramount', 'spruce', 'up', 'film', 'correctly', 'say', 'fix', 'damn', 'picture', 'date', 'Paramount', 'efforts', 'have', 'been', 'restricted', 'gussying', 'up', 'packaging', 'first', '2009', 'BD', 'case', 'wrapped', 'sparkling', 'O-ring', 'then', 'again', '2011', 'when', 'threw', 'ornament', 'other', 'useless', 'crap', 'Gift', 'Box', 'edition', 'versions', 'include', 'problematic', '2009', 'mastering', 'discussed', 'herein.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'book', 'cover', 'apparently', 'transfer', 'well-known', '-beloved', 'film', 'outside', 'packaging.Disappointing', 'say', 'least']",N/A

McCarthy,"[5, 5]","It may seem like a bit of hyperbole to state that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is the best movie ever made, but if you strip away all of the hyperbole that surrounds this movie, you will see that the assessment of it being the best movie ever made is not far from the truth.Frank Capra assembled a truly ensemble cast who do more than just act, they become the citizens of Bedford Falls. Each character is fully developed right on down to the bank examiner who comes to inspect George Bailey's delinquent accounts and, thus, creates the crisis for George Bailey. The principal actors are brilliant but none more that James Stewart. Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is breathtaking. Stewart takes on a tour deforce as the viewer becomes privy to George Bailey's descent into the personal hell. Bailey believes he has reached this low point in his life because he was too busy taking care of everyone else and spending so little time and resources on the betterment of his own situation. Having been convinced by Mr. Potter, the resident curmudgeon (played admirably by Lionel Barrymore) that Bailey was worth more dead than alive, Bailey first attempts to take his own life, then being granted the wish that he'd never been born and ultimately concludes with Bailey standing on a bridge pleading ""Please! I wanna live again. I wanna live again. Please, God, let me live again.""Along the way, we see that the people George had helped out in his life suffer immensely by his absence and we learn from Clarence, George's guardian angel that ""Each man's life touches so many other lives. When he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?"" We also learn that "" no man is a failure who has friends."" It are these friends who rally to Bailey's cause and give so much to the man who has given them so much.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a christmas movie in that there are themes of self-sacrifice and concern for your fellow man but it is also a movie that was set during christmas in that its themes extend well beyond the confines of christmas.It is ironic that one reviewer stated ""In lesser hands this theme [every person has an impact on their community] could have been greeting card hokum."" In fact, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" began as ""The Greatest Gift,"" a short story written by Phillip Van Doren Stern. When there were no magazine takers for his short story, Van Doren Stern had a couple hundred copies made and sent them to friends in their Christmas cards. Ultimately, the reviewer's point is well-taken.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a wonderful movie that should be cherished by viewers for years to come.",5,"Hands Down, The Best Movie Ever Made",1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,2608,"['may', 'seem', 'bit', 'hyperbole', 'state', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'strip', 'away', 'hyperbole', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'assessment', 'being', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'far', 'truth.Frank', 'Capra', 'assembled', 'truly', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'who', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'act', 'become', 'citizens', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'character', 'fully', 'developed', 'right', 'bank', 'examiner', 'who', 'inspect', 'George', 'Bailey', 'delinquent', 'accounts', 'thus', 'crisis', 'George', 'Bailey', 'principal', 'actors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'none', 'more', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Stewart', 'portrayal', 'George', 'Bailey', 'breathtaking', 'Stewart', 'tour', 'deforce', 'viewer', 'privy', 'George', 'Bailey', 'descent', 'personal', 'hell', 'Bailey', 'reached', 'low', 'point', 'life', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'taking', 'care', 'everyone', 'else', 'spending', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'resources', 'betterment', 'own', 'situation', 'Having', 'been', 'convinced', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'resident', 'curmudgeon', 'played', 'admirably', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Bailey', 'was', 'worth', 'more', 'dead', 'alive', 'Bailey', 'first', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'then', 'being', 'granted', 'wish', ""'d"", 'never', 'been', 'born', 'ultimately', 'Bailey', 'standing', 'bridge', 'pleading', 'Please', 'wan', 'na', 'live', 'again', 'wan', 'na', 'live', 'again', 'Please', 'God', 'let', 'live', 'again', 'way', 'see', 'people', 'George', 'had', 'helped', 'out', 'life', 'suffer', 'immensely', 'absence', 'learn', 'Clarence', 'George', 'guardian', 'angel', 'man', 'life', 'touches', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'lives', 'When', ""n't"", 'awful', 'hole', ""n't"", 'also', 'learn', 'man', 'failure', 'who', 'friends', 'are', 'friends', 'who', 'rally', 'Bailey', 'cause', 'give', 'so', 'much', 'man', 'who', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'christmas', 'movie', 'are', 'themes', 'self-sacrifice', 'concern', 'fellow', 'man', 'also', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'christmas', 'themes', 'extend', 'well', 'confines', 'christmas.It', 'ironic', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'lesser', 'hands', 'theme', '[', 'person', 'impact', 'community', ']', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'greeting', 'card', 'hokum', 'fact', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'began', 'Greatest', 'Gift', 'short', 'story', 'written', 'Phillip', 'Van', 'Doren', 'Stern', 'When', 'were', 'magazine', 'takers', 'short', 'story', 'Van', 'Doren', 'Stern', 'had', 'couple', 'hundred', 'copies', 'made', 'sent', 'friends', 'Christmas', 'cards', 'Ultimately', 'reviewer', 'point', 'well-taken', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'cherished', 'viewers', 'years', 'come']",N/A
39857,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,0782002064,Marty Gillis,"[8, 8]","'It's a Wonderful Life' needs no introduction. Frank Capra's 1946 Masterpiece was seen as ""just another film"" when it was released and not even seen as a Christmas movie. It's box office performance was less than stellar and it soon faded into obscurity. THEN........ Endless TV showings and re-showings and the rest is history.  'It's a Wonderful Life' has become one of the most cherished Christmas/Holiday classics of all time and loved by millions.With that in mind, this review will focus on the video/audio quality of the Blu Ray presentation along with the packaging and any special features.So is 'It's a Wonderful Life' on Blu Ray worth the upgrade from your previous DVD or VHS copies?  For those who do not enjoy long detailed reviews I will cut right to the chase here. 'It's a Wonderful Life' is INCREDIBLE on Blu Ray.  The quality of this scan/transfer easily rivals the newer 4K scan of  'Casablanca' and in many ways is superior to it.  Regular readers of my Blu Ray reviews know I have a rather large collection and when I say this is probably one of THE best Black and White titles in my entire BD collection, you can rest assured I really think so.  Except for the very last reel where there is an unfortunate vertical scratch that runs from top to bottom on the right hand side, this is a perfect transfer visually.  No visible film defects, no DNR visible with enough fine detail and natural film grain to satisfy the most rabid 'grain hounds', while still retaining a beautiful smooth and glossy appearance.This AVC encode is one of the very best in my collection. I could detect NO encoding artifacts. (and I was looking for them) I found myself actually gasping with wonder as this film unfolded. For classic film fans who are constantly looking for ""THE"" best Black and White transfer, you are almost there with this title.  If only Paramount could have either digitally removed the vertical scratch in the last reel (it's not THAT bad, but it IS annoying and once you see it you can't stop seeing it) or even sightly cropped the frame on the right side for the last reel. It is really the ONLY thing that keeps me from calling this a perfect transfer.  (A great big PHOOEY to whoever decided to let this slide--probably a relative of Mr. Potter!)How about the audio? Again, another ""Mr. Potter"" decision here with the audio being presented in 'lossy' Dolby Digital. It is presented in MONO as it should be and is clear and relatively free of defects. You can hear what you need to hear clearly and otherwise there isn't much to say about it. It gets the job done. Still, I can't help but wonder how much better it MIGHT have sounded if given a nice Mono DTS-HD Master Audio track.  Since the picture quality is SO GREAT the Dolby Digital audio encoding really isn't detrimental to getting full enjoyment out of this Blu Ray.The media itself is high quality and not of the thin cheap variety that some releases are given. (a nice thick disc) The box features a nice slip cover but the disc case of the the thin/cheap eco-case variety which I have come to loathe.As for special features, you get a 2nd disc with the Colorized version of this film. Some may find this a sell point but I find it an affront to the filmmaker so the less said the better, at least by me.  You also get a nice 23 minute documentary hosted by the great Tom Bosley (Mr. ""C"", Sheriff Tupper, Father Dowling, etc) which fans will certainly enjoy and finally the films trailer presented in glorious HD.But honestly, with such a SUPER transfer of this film, any bonus features are just gravy as the transfer alone is well worth the price of admission here.If you love this film then the Blu Ray presentation of 'It's A Wonderful Life' will be a real revelation and a true joy to behold.  After countless subpar TV reruns and public domain home releases we FINALLY get to see this movie look as good as it did the day it premiered in theaters.

This movie's simple message that every human being is important and has a life that has meaning, and the way this story is told, expands into an almost epic saga for anyone who watches it, even though it's an intimate drama. Well acted, amazing script, beautifully directed, with memorable scenes both comedic and sad and uplifting. This is one of the best movies of all time.

This is the most classic film of all time and if you haven't seen this yet then you haven't really had Christmas.  Yes, yes I know they show it 500,000 times every Christmas but that's because people love it so.  I'm glad that Jimmy Stewart lived long enough to see it become so loved by movie watchers around the world.In case you've been living on Mars for the past hundred years, it's the story of George Bailey (James Stewart) who wants to build great buildings and travel the world.  He feels left out as all his friends go on to college while he helps his father at the family business.  Just when he's all set to finally go to college his father dies and he has to stay on at the Bailey Building and Loan.  A few years later his brother comes home but has just gotten married and received a job offer even though he was supposed to be coming home to take over the business so George could finally travel.  No such luck.Finally George realizes that he's not going anywhere and he's married with four kids.  One day his uncle misplaces $8,000.00 bucks and George is threatened with jail time.  He loses all hope and decides it would be better if he had never been born and plans to commit suicide but an angel shows him what would have happend if he had not been born. The angel convinces him that he should not throw away God's greatest gift.  It turns out that he helped so many people (including saving the life of his only brother) none of them would have made it without his help.  Because he saved his brother, his brother was able to save the lives of many of his comrads in the army.  Because of that, his brother won the Congressional Medal of Honor.  But George learns that if he had not been there to save his brother, every man on that army transport would have died because his brother would not have been there to save them.  Because he helped so many along the way, they in turn help him when he's in the darkest pit of his life.This may be the most spoofed movie of all time.  Saturday Night Live spoofed it more than once and so did Married with Children just to name a couple of shows.  Perhaps even more spoofed is the ever popular Scrooge.It's a Wonderful Life is a Timeless classic.  It applies itself to any year, any day, any country, any family, any race.

39865,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,0782002064,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[1, 2]","That short message is the basis of the story told in Frank Capra's brilliant film, ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  Arguably, one of the best films of all time, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" tells the biography of the fictional character George Bailey who lives in the small, fictional town of Bedford Falls, NY.  Like so many people in real life, George, as a young boy (played by Robert Anderson), aspired to become something greater than what the town of Bedford Falls could offer.  However, unforeseen circumstances prevent him from realizing his childhood dreams and lock him squarely into the life of Bedford Falls that he had so desperately wanted to escape.  In midlife, George (Jimmy Stewart) is barely able to provide adequate food and shelter to his wife Mary (Donna Reed) and their four children.  Further, he is falsely accused of embezzlement and threatened with imprisonment following an absentminded error committed by his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) by his unscrupulous rival, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore).Having faced so many disappointments, the boy who planned to travel the world and become an architect to skyscrapers and bridges instead becomes the manager of the lowly Bailey Savings & Loan and views himself as a complete failure.  Seeing no other viable options in his disillusioned state, George goes to a bridge crossing a wide river and contemplates suicide.  Just as he's ready to take his own life, he hears a splash and pleas for help rising from the river below.  Instinctively, George jumps in, not to kill himself, but to save the individual who had fallen.  The man that George saves, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers), is not a man, but a guardian angel sent to save him.  Doubting the existence of angels, George states his wish that he had never been born because he believes everyone would have been better off without him.  Seeing an opportunity to help George, Clarence grants George his wish and creates an alternate reality in which no George Bailey ever existed.  Not realizing that reality changed, George decides to return to Bedford Falls, but instead finds the renamed and sordid community of Pottersville.As George walks the now unfamiliar streets of Pottersville, George sees nothing but nightclubs, pawnshops and other disreputable businesses.  He searches for his business, the Bailey Savings & Loan, but he is told by a stranger that it closed years ago after George's father died and his Uncle Billy had been unable to manage it.  The two men who had been his best friends, the taxi driver Ernie Bishop (Frank Faylen) and police officer Bert (Ward Bond), don't know George at all.  He convinces Ernie to take him to what had once been his home, but now is only an abandoned house in total disrepair.  George has no wife and his children don't exist.  In this altered reality, the woman who had been his mother (Beulah Bondi) is an embittered childless widow.  Her only son Harry died as a child when he drowned in a frozen lake because George had not been there to save him.  With no Harry to join the navy, several sailors drown because Harry had not been there to save them and could not become a decorated war hero.  Mr. Gower (H.B. Warner) who had once owned a drugstore where George had worked as a child in the other reality, was now only a homeless alcoholic because he had accidentally poisoned a patient when he prescribed the wrong medication.  George had not been there to stop it.  Finally, the woman who had been his wife, Mary Hatch, is in the alternate reality only a lonely spinster.In desperation, George returns to the bridge where he had once planned to commit suicide and pleads for his life to God and to Clarence.  A light snow begins to fall as it had been in the familiar reality.  Officer Bert, who has been looking for George (and not trying to arrest him as he had in the alternate reality), recognizes George to George's astonishment and relief. He runs home to find Mary waiting for him and no longer cares about the threat of imprisonment, but Mary has made many phone calls in his absence. Nearly everyone in town collects more than enough money to make up for the $8000 that Uncle Billy had absentmindedly lost.""It's a Wonderful Life"" earned 5 Oscar nominations in 1947, including Jimmy Stewart for Best Actor, Frank Capra for Best Director and for Best Picture.  Having watched it many times, I am frequently brought to tears by the film's powerful drama and emotion.  George's self-sacrifices for Bedford Falls are not overlooked by its citizens who rally to help him. Clarence earns his wings for his efforts; a bell hung on the Bailey Christmas tree rings with George's youngest daughter Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes) saying, ""Teacher says that whenever a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.""  George replies, ""That's right. That a-boy Clarence!""""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a timeless classic that has delighted many generations since its release in 1946.  If you have never seen it, don't be dissuaded because it was filmed in black and white.  Instead, try it and don't be surprised if you find yourself holding back tears like so many others touched by its powerful drama.  As Clarence says, ""Each man's life touches so many other lives. If he wasn't around it would leave an awful hole.""",5,"""No man is a failure who has friends.""",1039564800,"12 11, 2002",2002,5263,"['short', 'message', 'basis', 'story', 'told', 'Frank', 'Capra',

Now before we start breaking out into song, let's focus on what the Christmas holiday means to all of us. For younger children, this is the time to be away from school and enjoy all the wonderful presents they have begged Santa for over the past four to five weeks. For the more adult crowd (at least most of them), Christmas is the time to gather with family and friends, swap stories and memories, and hope they don't get a necktie or socks as a gift. The festive yuletide season is also the time when the greatest films of all time are shown across millions of televisions sets across the country and possibly the world as well. You have your comedies like A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation, the cartoon treasures such as A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and those delightful classics like White Christmas and The Bishop's Wife. But none of these can hold a candle to Frank Capra enduring theatrical triumph, It's a Wonderful Life. Amazingly the feature wasn't considered a Christmas film until its repetitive showings in the 1970's when the copyright on the film went up. Now it is basically considered a near crime for this film not to be seen at least during this festive time of year. Quite amazing to see how a total box office dud can rise over the years to be not only the greatest Christmas film but one of the most enduring classics of all time.The story follows a man who is at the end of his rope and how he discovers that he really has bigger purpose in life then he had originally thought. George Bailey is a good man who has never accomplished the goals he once set for himself as a young boy. Growing up in the little town of Bedford Falls, George dreamed of venturing out into the world and visiting many different and exotic places without a care for anybody else but himself. Unfortunately luck does not seem to be on his side as every opportunity he has to escape the little town ends with him in the same place he has been for all of his life while others get to enjoy the life George wishes he had. Now in charge of his father's loan office, George Bailey faces one of the greatest challenges of his life. Uncle Billy has lost the $8,000 that the loan office carried and Mr. Potter, the richest and stingiest man in town, has issued a warrant for his arrest. George now contemplates taking his own life until his guardian angel shows him the world as if he was never born and it's a more frightening situation then he had ever imagined. The story for It's a Wonderful Life is quite a simple premise and yet it has to be one of the most inspiring and insightful plots in motion picture history. No other film in recent memory can claim it has pulled off the same premise as wonderfully as Capra's classic has.Though there are many memorable performances in It's Wonderful Life, the overall emotional support lies on the performance of only one man, James Stewart. It was once said of director Frank Capra that Stewart was his first and only choice for the role of George Bailey and that shows in his emotionally driven performance in the two hour feature. Jimmy Stewart showcases a wide range of expresses from his frustration when Uncle Billy loses the money, till exasperation when he stands at the bridge contemplating whether to kill himself or not, to his exuberance at discovering he is able to live once again. James Stewart has to be one of the most treasured performers ever to come across the silver screen and no more so then in this film. What makes this feature even more special is the fact that this was the performer's first feature film since coming back from his service in World War II. Jimmy Stewart should be revered not only for his dedication to his profession but to his country as well.Overall, It's a Wonderful Life's message of necessity and good nature of man kind rings no harder in the minds of movie-goers then it does today. Plenty of classic holiday films have come along over the years including such favorites as The Santa Clause, The Grinch, and the recent smash-hit, Elf, but none of them can ever come close to the staying power of Frank Capra's crowning achievement. The truth is that the messages expressed in the film go way beyond the holiday season and can be enjoyed during any time of the year with as great of amount of enthusiasm as if the Christmas spirit was all around. Granted the film has been labeled overly-sentimental but if anything that is more a greater compliment then anything else one can say about one the true treasures in cinematic history.",5,The Moose Hole - &quot;No man is poor who has friends.&quot;,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,4627,"['beginning', 'look', 'lot', 'Christmas', 'everywhere', 'go', 'Now', 'start', 'breaking', 'out', 'song', 'let', 'focus', 'what', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'younger', 'children', 'time', 'be', 'away', 'school', 'enjoy', 'wonderful', 'presents', 'have', 'begged', 'Santa', 'past', 'four', 'five', 'weeks', 'more', 'adult', 'crowd', 'least', 'most', 'Christmas', 'time', 'gather', 'family', 'friends', 'swap', 'stories', 'memories', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'necktie', 'socks', 'gift', 'festive', 'yuletide', 'season', 'also', 'time', 'when', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'are', 'shown', 'millions', 'televisions', 'sets', 'country', 'possibly', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'comedies', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'cartoon', 'treasures', 'such', 'A', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'delightful', 'classics', 'White', 'Christmas', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'none', 'can', 'hold', 'candle', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'enduring', 'theatrical', 'triumph', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Amazingly', 'feature', 'was', ""n't"", 'considered', 'Christmas', 'film', 'repetitive', 'showings', '1970', 'when', 'copyright', 'film', 'went', 'up', 'Now', 'basically', 'considered', 'near', 'crime', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'least', 'festive', 'time', 'year', 'Quite', 'amazing', 'see', 'how', 'total', 'box', 'office', 'dud', 'can', 'rise', 'years', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'greatest', 'Christmas', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'enduring', 'classics', 'time.The', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'end', 'rope', 'how', 'really', 'bigger', 'purpose', 'life', 'then', 'had', 'originally', 'thought', 'George', 'Bailey', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'accomplished', 'goals', 'once', 'set', 'young', 'boy', 'Growing', 'up', 'little', 'town', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'George', 'dreamed', 'venturing', 'out', 'world', 'visiting', 'many', 'different', 'exotic', 'places', 'care', 'anybody', 'else', 'Unfortunately', 'luck', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'side', 'opportunity', 'escape', 'little', 'town', 'ends', 'same', 'place', 'been', 'life', 'others', 'get', 'enjoy', 'life', 'George', 'had', 'Now', 'charge', 'father', 'loan', 'office', 'George', 'Bailey', 'one', 'greatest', 'challenges', 'life', 'Uncle', 'Billy', 'lost', '8,000', 'loan', 'office', 'carried', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'richest', 'stingiest', 'man', 'town', 'issued', 'warrant', 'arrest', 'George', 'now', 'taking', 'own', 'life', 'guardian', 'angel', 'world', 'was', 'never', 'born', 'more', 'frightening', 'situation', 'then', 'had', 'ever', 'imagined', 'story', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quite', 'simple', 'premise', 'yet', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'inspiring', 'insightful', 'plots', 'motion', 'picture', 'history', 'other', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'can', 'claim', 'pulled', 'off', 'same', 'premise', 'as', 'wonderfully', 'Capra', 'classic', 'has.Though', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'overall', 'emotional', 'support', 'performance', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'James', 'Stewart', 'was', 'once', 'said', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Stewart', 'was', 'first', 'only', 'choice', 'role', 'George', 'Bailey', 'emotionally', 'driven', 'performance', 'two', 'hour', 'feature', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'wide', 'range', 'expresses', 'frustration', 'when', 'Uncle', 'Billy', 'money', 'exasperation', 'when', 'bridge', 'contemplating', 'kill', 'not', 'exuberance', 'discovering', 'able', 'live', 'once', 'again', 'James', 'Stewart', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'treasured', 'performers', 'ever', 'come', 'silver', 'screen', 'more', 'so', 'then', 'film', 'What', 'feature', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'fact', 'was', 'performer', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'coming', 'back', 'service', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'should', 'be', 'revered', 'not', 'only', 'dedication', 'profession', 'country', 'well.Overall', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'message', 'necessity', 'good', 'nature', 'man', 'kind', 'harder', 'minds', 'movie-goers', 'then', 'today', 'Plenty', 'classic', 'holiday', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'years', 'including', 'such', 'favorites', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Grinch', 'recent', 'smash-hit', 'Elf', 'none', 'can', 'ever', 'come', 'close', 'staying', 'power', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'truth', 'messages', 'expressed', 'film', 'go', 'way', 'holiday', 'season', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'year', 'great', 'amount', 'enthusiasm', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'was', 'around', 'Granted', 'film', 'been', 'labeled', 'overly-sentimental', 'anything', 'more', 'greater', 'compliment', 'then', 'anything', 'else', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'true', 'treasures', 'cinematic', 'history']",N/A

39878,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,0782002064,mirasreviews,"[3, 3]","""It's a Wonderful Life"" is often thought of as a Christmas movie -perhaps because it has become a tradition to show the movie on television every year in December. Only a very small part of the story takes place during the Christmas season, though, and that's at the film's conclusion. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is most likely considered a Christmas film because it embodies the ""Christmas spirit"". No other movie has championed the spirit of giving and sacrificing one's own desires for the good of others so successfully as this film.""It's a Wonderful Life"" stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a bright ambitious man who is also considerate and generous to a fault. He is so considerate and generous that he has always sacrificed his own happiness and goals so that others might pursue theirs. When bad luck strikes a final blow, it seems like all of his generosity has brought George nothing but dissatisfaction and a bad end. An angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent to Earth to convince George that he has had a wonderful life, after all, and one that is very much worth living.""It's a Wonderful Life""'s message is more idealistic than realistic. And I'm not sure that advocating constantly putting the happiness of others ahead of your own is at all wise. But this is a wonderfully entertaining and well-constructed film nonetheless. Jimmy Stewart is due much of the credit for the film's success. This is one of his finest performances. Perpetual self-sacrifice could easily grow tedious, and George Bailey would be a  saccharine character in the hands of a lesser actor. But with the help of a terrific script, Stewart makes George sympathetic and interesting. The supporting cast does a fine job. The cinematography and art direction are excellent. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is simply a pleasure to watch, which is why it has become a Christmas classic. Recommended for viewing on cold winter nights. Somehow that works best.

A group of angels look down on George as he grows from boyhood to adulthood and experiences wonderful moments brought about by seeming defeats and sidetracks from his own hopes and dreams. When we finally catch up with George in modern-day (the late nineteen-forties), a sudden moment of desperation on Christmas Eve has driven him to thoughts of suicide. Convinced that the world would be better off if he'd never been born, the angel Clarence comes to George to show him otherwise by introducing him to a bleak world that never knew him and all the good that he has done.Directed by Hollywood fave Frank Capra in 1946, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was forgotten soon after its initial release despite being nominated for multiple Oscars. However, an amazing thing happened when the film fell into public domain decades later. Repeat viewings on television gradually made the film a Christmas tradition and one of the most beloved films of all time. To this day, I personally consider it to be the best film ever made (though it is not my absolute favorite film or even favorite Christmas film, but definitely among them). ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has it all. So many moments of this movie are pure magic caught on film, sometimes even by accident! The performances are fantastic, the passion of the telephone scene is something you'll never forget, and the ending is sure to leave you in tears!""It's a Wonderful Life"" has been released several times on DVD. I still have one of the earliest versions myself, if not THE earliest. Mine is the Silver Screen Classics release by Artisan, and it's quite satisfactory. The double-sided disc holds the film on side A and 3 extra features on side B. The features are the theatrical trailer, a Making Of documentary hosted by Tom Bosley, and ""A Personal Remembrance"" hosted by Frank Capra, Jr., which features interviews with Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. Whichever version of the DVD you get though, be sure to get one, because this film is an annual must-watch at the very least! And, if you like this one, look for ""The Bishop's Wife"" (1947) and ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) if you want to have the three best classic Christmas films ever!

The joy we share with George Bailey on his glorious return to the land of the living mirrors the unforgettable scene when Ebenezer Scrooge (played by Alistair Sim) realizes he is back in his own room, safe and sound.That may be one of Frank Capra's themes:It's a Frank Capra world, as far as I'm concerned.

He did everything he could to keep that building and loan open. He is smart, well-liked, and never thinks about himself. With that, there is no way you can hate George Bailey. He wants his friends and others to have an alternative to Harry Potter (the Lex Luthor of his time). We can also relate to George because every once in a while, our lives fall into a rutt. We feel that nothing has been accomplished in our lives, but that is not the case. Sometimes people need to stop and see what's around them. Like others, there are certain parts I get choked up on.

39922,A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP,0782002064,Phil Berardelli,"[0, 0]","This classic American tale of George Bailey, a selfless and compassionate young man who yearns for travel and adventure but never escapes from the small town where he has grown up, is easily one of the most beloved movies ever made. The great James Stewart plays George Bailey, and I can't think of a better performance by him. He is Everyman embodied -- basically good and decent but also humanly flawed. Even when he finds love in Mary Hatch (Donna Reed, near the beginning of her career but at her very best), George's fundamental unhappiness, which has seethed beneath the surface for most of his life, continues, only to boil over during a crisis to the point where George considers suicide. That's when Providence intervenes -- literally, in the form of Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers, in a perfect performance) an ""Angel, 2nd Class"" who has arrived from Heaven to present George with a most unusual gift: the opportunity to see what the world would have been like if he had never been born.I choose to reveal no more. You will have to discover the rest for yourself. Know, however, that this is as good as moviemaking gets. It is Frank Capra directing at the zenith of his powers. It digs very deeply into the human psyche with a vision as affectionate and positive as anything ever portrayed on the screen. And if you do not find yourself weeping unashamedly at the finale -- because, as someone once said, no tears are more intense than those of longing fulfilled -- then you might want to examine your susceptibility to emotion.Stewart and Reed are joined by a superb supporting cast, including Samuel S. Hinds as Bailey's salt-of-the-earth father, Thomas Mitchell as his eccentric uncle Billy, Beulah Bondi as his mother, Ward Bond as Bert the cop, Frank Faylen as Ernie the taxi driver, Gloria Grahame as the town flirt, H.B. Warner as Mr. Gower the druggist, and a young Sheldon Leonard (who became a major TV producer in the 1950s and '60s) as Nick the bartender. There's also Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, ""the meanest man in town"" and George's frequent foe and tormentor. As for the minor characters, you'll understand how vividly Capra has painted them during one shot at the very end, where he pans the camera across a large grouping, and you recognize everyone.Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)",5,It's a wonderful movie!,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,2349,"['classic', 'American', 'tale', 'George', 'Bailey', 'selfless', 'compassionate', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'travel', 'adventure', 'never', 'escapes', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'grown', 'up', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'great', 'James', 'Stewart', 'George', 'Bailey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'performance', 'Everyman', 'embodied', 'basically', 'good', 'decent', 'also', 'humanly', 'flawed', 'Even', 'when', 'love', 'Mary', 'Hatch', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'beginning', 'career', 'very', 'best', 'George', 'fundamental', 'unhappiness', 'seethed', 'surface', 'most', 'life', 'only', 'boil', 'over', 'crisis', 'point', 'where', 'George', 'suicide', 'when', 'Providence', 'intervenes', 'literally', 'form', 'Clarence', 'Oddbody', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'perfect', 'performance', 'Angel', '2nd', 'Class', 'who', 'arrived', 'Heaven', 'present', 'George', 'most', 'unusual', 'gift', 'opportunity', 'see', 'what', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born.I', 'choose', 'reveal', 'more', 'will', 'have', 'discover', 'rest', 'Know', 'however', 'as', 'good', 'moviemaking', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'directing', 'zenith', 'powers', 'very', 'deeply', 'human', 'psyche', 'vision', 'affectionate', 'positive', 'anything', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'weeping', 'unashamedly', 'finale', 'because', 'someone', 'once', 'said', 'tears', 'are', 'more', 'intense', 'longing', 'fulfilled', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'examine', 'susceptibility', 'emotion.Stewart', 'Reed', 'are', 'joined', 'superb', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Samuel', 'S.', 'Hinds', 'Bailey', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'father', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'eccentric', 'uncle', 'Billy', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'mother', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'Bert', 'cop', 'Frank', 'Faylen', 'Ernie', 'taxi', 'driver', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'town', 'flirt', 'H.B', 'Warner', 'Mr.', 'Gower', 'druggist', 'young', 'Sheldon', 'Leonard', 'who', 'became', 'major', 'TV', 'producer', '1950s', ""'60s"", 'Nick', 'bartender', 'also', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'meanest', 'man', 'town', 'George', 'frequent', 'foe', 'tormentor', 'minor', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'how', 'vividly', 'Capra', 'painted', 'one', 'shot', 'very', 'end', 'where', 'camera', 'large', 'grouping', 'recognize', 'Favorite', '500', 'Loves', 'Moviegoing', 'Lifetime', '2014', 'edition']",N/A

It's A Wonderful Life definitely deserves to labeled as such.  It is probably the most beloved film ever made.  Interestingly, the film was a major flop when it was released in 1946.  It sat around in the vaults as a forgotten movie until it's copyright expired.  The film became public domain and in the time of television, that meant stations could air it without paying for the rights to do so.  Even though it is not a Christmas film, the fact that the movie ending takes place on Christmas, stations aired the film incessantly around the holidays.  The movie became traditional watching for families and has since become so associated with Christmas that one could mark the season with the movie's airing.  The film itself is a morality tale and one of the darkest and disturbing film performances of Jimmy Stewart's career.  We follow the downward spiral of Mr. Stewart's George Bailey.  He has high ideals and wants to travel the world, but ends up doing the right thing by taking over his father's savings and loan business in Bedford Falls.  He world eventually crashes down around him when his Uncle Billy loses an important bank deposit.  George wishes he was never born and an angel Clarence shows him what life would have been like without him.  The moral of the story is that we touch so many people in so many different ways and every person's life is important.

I hadn't heard much about this one but I thought I'd take a chance since it boasted both Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra.  What a major surprize that screening turned out to be.  It was as though someone had dug up a previously forgotten movie on par with &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.  I don't know how this movie drifted into obscurity for so many years but it has really busted out of it now, hasn't it!What this movie offers is a solid family experience with a lesson for all.  At first it seems like just another &quot;good&quot; movie as we see the life of a young man (Gearge Baily) being recounted by some angels up in heaven.  All seems well but it also appears that the weight of the world keeps getting added to George Baily's back one pound at a time.  In time this happy life reaches a breaking point and then we start to see the real beauty of the story.  George Baily's guardian angel, Clarence, grants him his wish to see what life would be like if he (George Baily) had never been born.  Now all those minor and major incidents in George's life that we saw in the first two thirds of the movie suddenly take on a very special meaning.  We see how those things affected the lives of so many people and (this IS a Capra movie afterall) always for the better.  In case you haven't seen this movie, I'll leave the plot hanging there.  The ending is truly heart-warming.This movie has a lot going for it besides the plot.  The directing is terrific as is usually the case in a Frank Capra movie.  The acting is terrific with Stewart taking the lead as George Baily.  Henry Travers may have been a lesser known character actor in his other roles but he achieved immortality (forgive the pun) as Clarence ASC.  Donna Reed is well-cast as the girl-next-door who grew up to be Mrs. George Baily.  Lionel Barrymore is terrifically sinister in the role of Old Man Potter.  There are plenty of others who make this movie great.  Indeed, the nature of the plot has a seemingly record number of role-players who are essential to the story.If you haven't yet seen this movie, then you have been missing a real treat.  When you do get around to seeing it, I recommend that you see it from the start.  It's really impressive the way everything eventually fits together so neatly.  This movie is like a warm hug on a sad day.

This is not a think for yourself film, not something like Citizen Kane, that is supposed to have the audience leave the theatre already in various discussions or even quarrels.I remember showing this film every winter in an art house when I was in college; afterwards I'd lean out the transom to look over the seats and I'd see the lines of used Kleenex strewn up and down the rows. This is exactly what Capra intended, and he has succeeded.Ironically, it is the jaded audiences of America since the Vietnam War that have embraced this film. When it first came out in 1947, the critics panned it. World War Two had just ended, and the critics, as well as the typical audiences wanted something besides a plain old feel-good movie. It was all very nice that George Bailey &quot;suffered&quot; a mediocre middle class life, so that he could save the lives of his brother, and by him, &quot;the men on the transport,&quot; not to mention the kid with the diphtheria. But this didn't answer any of the questions on people's minds at the time.Right after World War Two, people were dealing with war orphans, and the influx of refugees from concentration camps. 1947 was just about the time that America was coming to terms with what has gone on in places like Buchenwald and Treblinka. Not to mention Hiroshima and Nagasaki.I think the irony is in the fact that the recent audiences have been able to put aside questions of My Lai, the Bay of Pigs, the invasion of Czechoslovakia, The Gang of Four, the Iranian Embassy hostages, Tiannamen Square, the Taliban, Tibet, and focus on the idea that a man is wealthy as long as he has friends. Why is this possible, when contemporary audiences didn't respond to the film?I suppose modern audiences respond with nostalgia, to the old black &amp; white film, with its boxy cars, wind up record player, and corner drugstore. Yes, well, we have the Taliban now, and back then there were no jumbo jets, or buildings tall enough for a flying plane....The truth is that every time has hard times, and no days were simpler. But nonetheless, this is a great film. Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed take stock characters and flesh them out, so that the audience cares what happens to them from the moment they appear on the screen.The photography makes the film. The filming and editing are superb. If you have a chance to buy a letterboxed version of the film, do, because it loses so much with the sides cropped off. There are a number of deep-focus shots, and odd angles, designed to show George Bailey from G-d's perspective, or to emphasise the times he is alone in a crowd, or to jolt the audience, to make us uncomfortable and nervous when George Bailey is uncomfortable and nervous. Or sometimes just to give an eye-catching view, as when George holds his hands out before receiving his trunk and says &quot;I want a BIG one!&quot;The crew and the actors have given such close attention to detail, that the film stands up to multiple viewings, so you won't be sorry you bought instead of rented.",5,Does What Movies are Supposed To Do,1006300800,"11 21, 2001",2001,3080,"['Capra', 'audience', 'first', 'scene', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'not', 'something', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'supposed', 'have', 'audience', 'leave', 'theatre', 'already', 'various', 'discussions', 'even', 'quarrels.I', 'remember', 'showing', 'film', 'winter', 'art', 'house', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'afterwards', ""'d"", 'lean', 'out', 'transom', 'look', 'seats', ""'d"", 'see', 'lines', 'used', 'Kleenex', 'strewn', 'up', 'rows', 'exactly', 'what', 'Capra', 'intended', 'succeeded.Ironically', 'jaded', 'audiences', 'America', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'have', 'embraced', 'film', 'When', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1947', 'critics', 'panned', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'had', 'just', 'ended', 'critics', 'as', 'well', 'typical', 'audiences', 'wanted', 'something', 'plain', 'old', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'George', 'Bailey', 'quot', 'suffered', 'quot', 'mediocre', 'middle', 'class', 'life', 'could', 'save', 'lives', 'brother', 'quot', 'men', 'transport', 'quot', 'not', 'mention', 'kid', 'diphtheria', 'did', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'people', 'minds', 'time.Right', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'people', 'were', 'dealing', 'war', 'orphans', 'influx', 'refugees', 'concentration', 'camps', '1947', 'was', 'just', 'time', 'America', 'was', 'coming', 'terms', 'what', 'gone', 'places', 'Buchenwald', 'Treblinka', 'Not', 'mention', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki.I', 'think', 'irony', 'fact', 'recent', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'put', 'aside', 'questions', 'My', 'Lai', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'invasion', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Gang', 'Four', 'Iranian', 'Embassy', 'hostages', 'Tiannamen', 'Square', 'Taliban', 'Tibet', 'focus', 'idea', 'man', 'wealthy', 'as', 'long', 'friends', 'Why', 'possible', 'when', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'did', ""n't"", 'respond', 'film', 'suppose', 'modern', 'audiences', 'respond', 'nostalgia', 'old', 'black', 'amp', 'white', 'film', 'boxy', 'cars', 'wind', 'up', 'record', 'player', 'corner', 'drugstore', 'Yes', 'well', 'have', 'Taliban', 'now', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'jumbo', 'jets', 'buildings', 'tall', 'enough', 'flying', 'plane', '.The', 'truth', 'time', 'hard', 'times', 'days', 'were', 'simpler', 'nonetheless', 'great', 'film', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'take', 'stock', 'characters', 'flesh', 'out', 'audience', 'what', 'moment', 'appear', 'screen.The', 'photography', 'film', 'filming', 'editing', 'are', 'superb', 'have', 'chance', 'buy', 'letterboxed', 'version', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'sides', 'cropped', 'off', 'are', 'number', 'deep-focus', 'shots', 'odd', 'angles', 'designed', 'show', 'George', 'Bailey', 'G-d', 'perspective', 'emphasise', 'times', 'alone', 'crowd', 'jolt', 'audience', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'nervous', 'when', 'George', 'Bailey', 'uncomfortable', 'nervous', 'sometimes', 'just', 'give', 'eye-catching', 'view', 'when', 'George', 'hands', 'out', 'receiving', 'trunk', 'quot', 'want', 'BIG', 'one', 'quot', 'crew', 'actors', 'have', 'given', 'such', 'close', 'attention', 'detail', 'film', 'up', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'bought', 'instead', 'rented']",N/A

This amazes me, because it is so sentimental and in many ways contrived, at least as we see it through our jaded modern eyes.  Sure, it was made for a simpler time, but there is no doubt that it taps into universal human truths and hopes.Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as a good and talented man who allows his sense of responsibility to guide his life, which costs him hugely in his sense of frustration and thwarted ambition.  You see it in him as a child, particularly the scene in the drug store, where he saves more than one life.  (That scene chokes me up every time I see it.  There is such struggle and caring in it, such courage as he sticks to his decision.  It is one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen in the cinema.)  Of course, he has a terrible crisis that is resolved, with a renewed sense of life.Donna Reed is also wonderful as his wife, a simple woman who loves him in the way we would all hope to be loved in marriage.  Indeed, she embodies an ideal and yet is so believable that it makes me introspect on my own marriage.  And Barrymore!  The perfect capitalist ogre.Like many, I watch this every Christmas season and feel awe at the power of a perfectly crafted hollywood story.

39953,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0782002064,Robert Morris,"[10, 12]","It was produced and directed by Frank Capra who collaborated with Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Jo Swerling on the screenplay. Nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture) it won none. Over the years, however, it developed a loyal following, largely comprised of those who appreciate Capra's films. Only in recent years has it received the recognition and praise it deserves. How to describe this film? It focuses on a thoroughly decent man named George Bailey (James Stewart) who, after being financially ruined by his evil rival Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), becomes despondent and attempts to commit suicide on Christmas Eve. George is rescued by his guardian angel, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers), and permitted to learn what would have happened if he (George) had never been born. Only then does George fully appreciate how precious life is. Of course, the film has a happy ending.Many people think this is a corny film but I do not. As in other films (notably in Meet John Doe), Capra celebrates certain basic values which guided and informed George throughout much of his life. When facing financial disaster which involves not only him and his family but countless others who entrusted to him their limited funds...and their own dreams for a wonderful life, George temporarily loses his faith in those values and his will to live without them. He regains his appreciation of life only after a near-death experience and a realization of how important his life had been to others. I am reminded of the situation in Thornton Wilder's Our Town when Emily Webb fully appreciates only in death what she had not previously while alive in a town very much like Bedford Falls..It is noteworthy that Leo McCarey, a contemporary of Capra's, affirms many of the same values in films he directed such as Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary's. When It's a Wonderful Life appeared in 1946, the World War II had only recently ended. Moreover, only 17 had years had passed since the stock market crash. Several contemporary accounts of American society during the mid-1940s note an excitement about opportunities which had been denied by the Great Depression and then delayed by the recent war. An entrepreneur, George Bailey's dream is to enable as many people as possible in Bedford Falls to own their own home. The film traces his efforts to make that dream a reality while he also marries Mary Hatch and they start a family. Yes, George is idealistic and somewhat naive but has business acumen. Regrettably, he is vulnerable to....I am among those who cherish this movie and the values which it affirms. I am especially grateful for the documentaries, &quot;The Making of It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and the special tribute to Frank Capra, &quot;A Personal Remembrance&quot; from &quot;Frank Capra Jr.,&quot; which accompany it in its DVD format. Until recent years, seeing it again was among the highlights of my holiday season. What happened? By way of concluding this brief commentary, I presume to suggest that those who allowed this film to be overexposed on television every December should be strapped into their seats in a screening room, eyes held open with duct tape, and required to watch the following films (repeated over and over again) for 168 consecutive hours: Battlefield Earth, Barb Wire, Howard the Duck, It's Pat, Little Nicky, and Wild Wild West. I further suggest they be joined by those who have butchered directors' cuts such as Sergio Leone's of Once Upon a Time in America.",5,"Obviously, it is also a wonderful film",1058054400,"07 13, 2003",2003,3523,"['was', 'produced', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'who', 'collaborated', 'Frances', 'Goodrich', 'Albert', 'Hackett', 'Jo', 'Swerling', 'screenplay', 'Nominated', 'five', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'won', 'none', 'years', 'however', 'developed', 'loyal', 'following', 'largely', 'comprised', 'who', 'appreciate', 'Capra', 'films', 'Only', 'recent', 'years', 'received', 'recognition', 'praise', 'How', 'describe', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'decent', 'man', 'named', 'George', 'Bailey', 'James', 'Stewart', 'who', 'being', 'financially', 'ruined', 'evil', 'rival', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'despondent', 'attempts', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'George', 'rescued', 'guardian', 'angel', 'Clarence', 'Oddbody', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'permitted', 'learn', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'George', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'Only', 'then', 'George', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'how', 'precious', 'life', 'course', 'film', 'happy', 'ending.Many', 'people', 'think', 'corny', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'other', 'films', 'notably', 'Meet', 'John', 'Doe', 'Capra', 'certain', 'basic', 'values', 'guided', 'informed', 'George', 'much', 'life', 'When', 'facing', 'financial', 'disaster', 'not', 'only', 'family', 'countless', 'others', 'who', 'entrusted', 'limited', 'funds', 'own', 'dreams', 'wonderful', 'life', 'George', 'temporarily', 'faith', 'values', 'will', 'live', 'appreciation', 'life', 'only', 'near-death', 'experience', 'realization', 'how', 'important', 'life', 'had', 'been', 'others', 'am', 'reminded', 'situation', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'Town', 'when', 'Emily', 'Webb', 'fully', 'only', 'death', 'what', 'had', 'not', 'previously', 'alive', 'town', 'very', 'much', 'Bedford', 'Falls..It', 'noteworthy', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'contemporary', 'Capra', 'many', 'same', 'values', 'films', 'directed', 'such', 'Going', 'My', 'Way', 'Bells', 'St.', 'Mary', 'When', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'appeared', '1946', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'had', 'only', 'recently', 'ended', 'Moreover', 'only', '17', 'had', 'years', 'had', 'passed', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', 'Several', 'contemporary', 'accounts', 'American', 'society', 'mid-1940s', 'note', 'excitement', 'opportunities', 'had', 'been', 'denied', 'Great', 'Depression', 'then', 'delayed', 'recent', 'war', 'entrepreneur', 'George', 'Bailey', 'dream', 'enable', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'own', 'own', 'home', 'film', 'efforts', 'make', 'dream', 'reality', 'also', 'Mary', 'Hatch', 'start', 'family', 'Yes', 'George', 'idealistic', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'business', 'acumen', 'Regrettably', 'vulnerable', '.I', 'am', 'who', 'cherish', 'movie', 'values', 'am', 'especially', 'grateful', 'documentaries', 'quot', 'Making', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'special', 'tribute', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'quot', 'Personal', 'Remembrance', 'quot', 'quot', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Jr.', 'quot', 'accompany', 'DVD', 'format', 'recent', 'years', 'seeing', 'again', 'was', 'highlights', 'holiday', 'season', 'What', 'happened', 'way', 'concluding', 'brief', 'commentary', 'presume', 'suggest', 'who', 'allowed', 'film', 'be', 'overexposed', 'television', 'December', 'should', 'be', 'strapped', 'seats', 'screening', 'room', 'eyes', 'held', 'open', 'duct', 'tape', 'required', 'watch', 'following', 'films', 'repeated', 'over', 'again', '168', 'consecutive', 'hours', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'Barb', 'Wire', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'Pat', 'Little', 'Nicky', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'further', 'suggest', 'be', 'joined', 'who', 'have', 'butchered', 'directors', 'cuts', 'such', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Once', 'Time', 'America']",N/A

For me, it is the epitome of holiday movies with great acting along with a terrific script and tight direction. If you have never seen it in some ways I envy you - just buy it and enjoy!As I was growing up this film was shown repeatedly on television as it had lapsed into the public domain. Somehow, it was retrieved from public domain with some legal wrangling - and though at first I thought of that as a bad thing the quality of the film has benefited now that there is money to be made on this old classic. The initial DVDs available for this film from the public domain era were very poor quality and only recently were better scans completed. That process has been taken to ""the nth degree"" for the blu-ray release.For this review I did watch the first few minutes of the Republic Pictures DVD version which last time I checked into this was the best transfer available. I recall when first seeing it that it was far superior to other versions and light-years ahead of the worn prints that used to be shown on TV. I played it on an upscaling player (actually my Sony Blu-Ray player). I then put in the Blu-Ray version and I was blown away at the improvement. The quality is really striking with facial detail and readable text, for example, on the bottles in Mr. Gower's Pharmacy. The print is totally clean and is as others have pointed out shown in the correct aspect ratio in which it was made. This means there are black bars at the sides on a wide-screen TV and this is normal and how it should be. To fill a wide screen TV would mean either stretching things so that the thin James Stewart starts to look more like Alfred Hitchcock or cutting off the top and bottom of the picture. Either of those options would go a long way toward destroying this classic. Sound quality is also excellent and clean.As I write this I am watching the colorized version which I feel is less impressive. While colorization has come a long way and looks less like paint-by-numbers than it used to it is still obviously added color and just distracting for us purists that love the original B&W.; That said, I wonder if the colorized version will be something that might make this film more accessible to kids (though I am planning on showing the original to my 5 and 7 year old kids!)All in all, this is a fantastic buy and is a must-have for those that love this film and have a blu-ray player.

Why are Frank Capra's films so universal and timeless, especially this one? Well, watch it and find out.The story concerns George Bailey (James Stewart), a guy from a small town that everyone knows and loves. As a boy he worked in a drugstore, his father at a savings and loan bank, and when his father died, he took over, despite aching to see the world and go to college. He did his duty but found happiness in a girl in town, Mary (Donna Reed) who became his wife. However, through the storybook life, there was a sense of longing for childhood dreams and a feeling of emptiness in George. This only manifested itself when Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the local rich curmudgeon with selfish ambition, antagonized George. Finally, at a turning point in his life, George is faced with failure and faces an angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) whose purpose is to pull George back from the precipice of suicide.It is difficult not to get wrapped up in such a story. You don't have to be from a small town, you don't have to be married, and you don't have to be middle aged to understand this movie and to love it. The themes and the sentiments are universal. Everyone likes to feel they are basically good and that the forces against them are evil; that is what this story is about, good trying to win over evil. Such a basic idea is enhanced by wonderful camerawork, brilliant acting, and amazing directing done in the golden age of Hollywood.This is no Christmas story, so do not hesitate to watch it any day of the year. The uplifting tone is often associated with an allotted time for giving each year, but it is appropriate for any time.

39966,A6FIAB28IS79,0782002064,Samuel Chell,"[4, 6]","How ironic that this once-forgotten and neglected film became by 1990 the most taken-for-granted American movie as a result of multiple screenings on virtually every television channel during the Christmas season.  Now that it's been removed from public domain and its distribution returned to studio control, perhaps we can begin to appreciate once again what an extraordinary film it actually is.New viewers, especially, have the opportunity to approach the movie not with assumptions about its &quot;excessive sentimentality&quot; but to experience the darkness of George Bailey's suicidal descent, without  which the film's ending would not provide such overwhelming relief and celebration of life's &quot;wonderfulness.&quot;  But prior to this emotional pay-off, we are also first-hand witnesses to much emotional pain.  George's &quot;surrender&quot; to Mary, for example, is perhaps the most memorable kiss in all of film because of its violence (he curses and practically strangles her while yielding up his idealistic dreams of personal greatness).  And later when it appears he has transplanted his grandiose visions to Bedford Falls, where he is its proudest citizen, we suddenly see what his pride has led him to: a complacent self-satisfaction so great it can lead him to thoughts of self-destruction over the disappearance of a mere $5000.More than Scrooge's stinginess or Dante the Pilgrim's sinfulness, George's story reminds us of our own misplaced piorities and their distorted, potentially fatal, consequences.  This is a film that encourages self-examination and affirmation of life like few others.  And because of it's archetypal patterns and complex, rich details of production and performance (it's far more than a &quot;talking picture&quot;), the film can never be reduced to a mere &quot;message.&quot;  It invites numerous viewings, each leading to the discovery of fresh, new meanings.If you see one film a year, make it this one (even if it's not during Christmas).",5,"Dickens' Carol, Dante's Inferno, and more.",976060800,"12 6, 2000",2000,1996,"['How', 'ironic', 'once-forgotten', 'neglected', 'film', 'became', '1990', 'most', 'taken-for-granted', 'American', 'movie', 'result', 'multiple', 'screenings', 'virtually', 'television', 'channel', 'Christmas', 'season', 'Now', 'been', 'removed', 'public', 'domain', 'distribution', 'returned', 'studio', 'control', 'perhaps', 'can', 'begin', 'appreciate', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'actually', 'viewers', 'especially', 'have', 'opportunity', 'approach', 'movie', 'not', 'assumptions', 'quot', 'excessive', 'sentimentality', 'quot', 'experience', 'darkness', 'George', 'Bailey', 'suicidal', 'descent', 'film', 'ending', 'would', 'not', 'provide', 'such', 'overwhelming', 'relief', 'celebration', 'life', 'quot', 'quot', 'prior', 'emotional', 'pay-off', 'are', 'also', 'first-hand', 'witnesses', 'much', 'emotional', 'pain', 'George', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mary', 'example', 'perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'kiss', 'film', 'violence', 'practically', 'yielding', 'up', 'idealistic', 'dreams', 'personal', 'greatness', 'later', 'when', 'transplanted', 'grandiose', 'visions', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'where', 'proudest', 'citizen', 'suddenly', 'see', 'what', 'pride', 'led', 'complacent', 'self-satisfaction', 'so', 'great', 'can', 'lead', 'thoughts', 'self-destruction', 'disappearance', 'mere', '5000.More', 'Scrooge', 'stinginess', 'Dante', 'Pilgrim', 'sinfulness', 'George', 'story', 'own', 'misplaced', 'piorities', 'distorted', 'potentially', 'fatal', 'consequences', 'film', 'self-examination', 'affirmation', 'life', 'few', 'others', 'archetypal', 'patterns', 'complex', 'rich', 'details', 'production', 'performance', 'far', 'more', 'quot', 'talking', 'picture', 'quot', 'film', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'reduced', 'mere', 'quot', 'quot', 'numerous', 'viewings', 'leading', 'discovery', 'fresh', 'new', 'meanings.If', 'see', 'one', 'film', 'year', 'make', 'one', 'even', 'not', 'Christmas']",N/A

39972,A1C58YXM2A30CY,0782002064,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[3, 3]","This weekend is the 64th anniversary of that great old film, It's a Wonderful Life.  I found that this weekend is also the It's a Wonderful Life festival at Seneca Falls, NY, which claims it was the inspiration for Bedford Falls (see their site here: [...], which also includes an appearance by Karolyn Grimes, who was the character Zuzu and her pedals).But what a story!  I'm sure most readers know this story and the DVD I picked up had a lot of interesting extras and ""making of"" that was fascinating.The film is a slice of Americana, taking us from the Roaring 20s to the post-war era of the mid 1940s.  Featured is George  Bailey, the son of a small town building and loan president, whose kind heart and common sense had kept the town running for years.On the other side of the spectrum is old Potter, a miserly miser that makes Scrooge look generous by comparison.The story's general plot goes through George's life through the eyes of an angel, a little guy who wants to earn his wings.  He watched with the viewer as George grows up:  George prevents several deaths, gets the town through a run on the bank during the '29 Depression and gets through the war.  He has kids and runs a successful business that is booming.Despite these successes, his uncle loses money that was accidentally given to the Potter miser.  Potter looks at this as an opportunity to finally beat George.Jimmy Stewart's acting ability was amazing in this film.  His range from pure happiness to deep despair was palpable.  Despite his personal sacrifices to give up his dreams for the benefit of others, George Bailey was finally at the end of his rope.  Stewart's performance as a broken man on that bridge was just an amazing piece of cinema.No Man Is a Failure Who Has Friends:Many themes in this film too many to mention, really.  There is a reason why this film has endured as a Christmas treat.  It is deep and philosophical without being preachy.  It has a dark side that cuts across the aisle of greed and despair, of heartache, and of suicidal tendencies.  The film raises you up and makes you think.What if you had never been born?  What hole would be hard to fill without your contribution to people around you and to Man as a species?  Would lives have been better off if you had never existed?DVD Specials:I enjoyed the bits with Frank Capra's son as he went over his father's inspiration for the film.  They showed a clip from an interview with Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra himself.  It's Capra's favorite film.The DVD also has a brief spot with Tom Bosley who again goes over similar ground to the bit on the ""making of"" segment, but adds some film history.  It's a Wonderful Life was not a hit at the box office at its release.  In fact, viewers thought it too depressing for the holiday season (which I find simply unbelievable).When the film fell into the public domain, it was shown on TV in the 70s and there was a revival for it.  Now we have Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes) touring the country pushing the film.

He contemplates happy times and travelling with his love Mary (Donna Reed). But on Chrsitmas Eve, because of intense frustration and an impending scandal - he conemplates suicide. He is visited by an angel named Clarence (a lovely performance by Henry Travers) who shows him what the world will be like if he had never been born. It is at this point that the film becomes very dark (especially given what has gone before), yet the underlying message is simple and uplifting - ""no one is a failure who has friends"". George Bailey was a completely selfless man, who thought himself a failure, and yet didn't realise he was so loved by his friends and neighbours.Now I'm not used to seeing older US films like this but its' still a lovely film, maybe even inspiring Simpsons jokes (some plot elements are taken off in the episode ""When Flanders Failed"", and the horrible rich businessman Henry Potter played by Lionel Barrymore, is like Mr. Burns in a way). Some ideas may be taken from A Chrsitmas Carol as well.Throughout the film George is such a nice, honest, friendly guy, who will help all his friends out. This is shown in the scene where he gives his honeymoon money away to help them until the bank opens. Its' a very close knit community where everyone knows everyone else.Yet, the last part in which we see Bedford Falls is now called ""Pottersvile"" after the Scrooge-like Mr. Potter is genuinely disturbing and shows Bailey's descent into sadness, anger and despair when no-one, not even his mother, knows him.Everything is different and the whole town has a ""bad"" air.But it is overall a  beautiful film that is so warm and touching, and made me feel happy and sad all at once - an American classic.",5,A beloved Christmas classic,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,1803,"['man', 'named', 'George', 'Bailey', 'superb', 'James', 'Stewart', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'happy', 'times', 'travelling', 'love', 'Mary', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Chrsitmas', 'Eve', 'intense', 'frustration', 'impending', 'scandal', 'suicide', 'visited', 'angel', 'named', 'Clarence', 'lovely', 'performance', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'who', 'what', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'point', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'especially', 'given', 'what', 'gone', 'before', 'yet', 'underlying', 'message', 'simple', 'uplifting', 'one', 'failure', 'who', 'friends', 'George', 'Bailey', 'was', 'completely', 'selfless', 'man', 'who', 'thought', 'failure', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'was', 'so', 'loved', 'friends', 'neighbours.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'used', 'seeing', 'older', 'US', 'films', 'still', 'lovely', 'film', 'maybe', 'even', 'inspiring', 'Simpsons', 'jokes', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'taken', 'off', 'episode', 'When', 'Flanders', 'Failed', 'horrible', 'rich', 'businessman', 'Henry', 'Potter', 'played', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'way', 'ideas', 'may', 'be', 'taken', 'A', 'Chrsitmas', 'Carol', 'film', 'George', 'such', 'nice', 'honest', 'friendly', 'guy', 'who', 'will', 'help', 'friends', 'out', 'shown', 'scene', 'where', 'honeymoon', 'money', 'away', 'help', 'bank', 'very', 'close', 'knit', 'community', 'where', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'else.Yet', 'last', 'part', 'see', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'now', 'called', 'Pottersvile', 'Scrooge-like', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'Bailey', 'descent', 'sadness', 'anger', 'despair', 'when', 'no-one', 'not', 'even', 'mother', 'him.Everything', 'different', 'whole', 'town', 'bad', 'air.But', 'overall', 'beautiful', 'film', 'so', 'warm', 'touching', 'made', 'feel', 'happy', 'sad', 'once', 'American', 'classic']",N/A

39996,AGMW3I34INNYG,0782002064,Stephen Cannon,"[3, 5]","Director Frank Capra was a rare find indeed - a voice of optimism through some very troubled times.  Never was that optimism, along with his appreciation for his fellow man, more apparent than in this timeless movie.Jimmy Stewart is magical as George Bailey, a man who dreams of adventure but is bound to his family business and to his adoring wife and kids.  Donna Reed also lights up the screen as Mary, the woman who stands behind George without hesitation.  George's uncle Billy, played nicely by Thomas Mitchell, has misplaced $8,000 belonging to the family Building and Loan business.  This has occurred on the day that the bank examiner has arrived for a routine inspection.  George has a nemesis in Mr. Potter (the great Lionel Barrymore), a tyranical business man who wants to see the Bailey business go away so he can make even more money. Potter has actually ended up with the missing money, but he uses that to his advantage. In desperation, George contemplates suicide, only to be 'saved' by his guardian angel, Clarence (Henry Travers).  Clarence offers George a chance to see what the world would have been like if he had never been born.While the cast is uniformly excellent here, Stewart is the heart and soul of this film.  He is an everyman, showing both strength and weakness, desperation and joy.  This movie may strike some as sentimental.  While this is true, the sentiment is honest, and a reflection of the hope that people were looking for as WWII drew to its end.  If the rare opportunity arises, see this one in the theater.  The DVD offers a nice retrospective hosted by Happy Days star Tom Bosley.

39998,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,0782002064,Steve,"[1, 2]","I just watched It's A Wonderful Life again the other night and it was comforting to find that time and life can mold one's opinion. I've always liked this movie but it was generally enjoyed in the sentimental run-up to Christmas and tossed in with the rest of the holiday fare. Therefore, it was always judged as a simple feel-good holiday movie and nothing more. After last night's viewing, I found myself with a lot more questions than answers and a lot more criticism than optimism.For starters, given today's political landscape, I find such a movie a bit confusing. Why isn't Potter hailed as a job creator and Bailey Loan a victim of the invisible hand of the free market? Isn't George's method of running his bank closer to socialism than pure capitalism? Most troubling, what is the message? Is it that staying in a stifling dead-end small town and a soul-crushing job are offset by the presence of friends and family? Is it saying that one has to choose between the two?It isn't hard to empathize with George's simmering rage because he is beaten down so much by the misery of Bedford Falls that he ends up a whipped dog who settles on suicide rather than facing another day of his life. What brings him back is an angel who reminds him that two people would've had dramatically different life outcomes if he hadn't been born. Both key events occurred when he was young, so surely he could've left town and let Bedford Falls take care of itself while he pursued his dreams. Why is that the only choice - non-existence or never leaving Bedford Falls? Could he not have been the one to save the soldiers?  Could he not have returned after his travels to rescue Mary from the library and raise his brood? It's all so frustratingly fatalistic.In the end, I think this movie is mismatched as a Christmas movie. The only part that takes place around the holiday is the final scenes and the larger point isn't contingent upon the holidays. IAWL is a sweet but ultimately muddled message of a movie and it is a far cry from the other Christmas Capra, the powerful and life-affirming Meet John Doe.

40001,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,0782002064,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[5, 5]","How do you describe Frank Capra's style? I once called it like Orson Welles, only happy. Visually, these two film-makers were both fond of high-contrast photography and capturing emotions in the characters of their movies. But whereas Welles seemed to focus on all the terrible things that human beings can become, Capra focused on life lessons and the good that lies inside of all people.While Capra created many masterpieces, this is probably his greatest. It's easy to see why. Rather than focusing on just one aspect of life, this film (like Citizen Kane) captures a person's whole life, with all it's ups and downs. Basically the story is a simple tale of David and Goliath relationship between the small businessman and the evil monopoly, and the internal struggle in a man between what he wants to do, and what he feels that he has to do.Perhaps there is a bit of George Bailey in all of us. He's a perfectly normal person with perfectly normal dreams. He wants to see the world, build things, become important. But over and over again, in order to help (and in some cases save) others he is forced repeatedly to give up his dreams in order to do what he knows is right. Along the way he builds relationships with all sorts of people in the town where he is forced to spend his entire life. But was what he gave up really an unfair trade? Or did he actually attain a treasure far greater than he could ever imagine?The emotional climax of the film at it's end (where everything comes full circle and we finally understand how George Bailey got to the point he was at in the film's beginning) has got to be one of the greatest performances in any film ever, and Jimmy Stewart's moment of moments (perhaps only rivaled by his breakdown at the end of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). I recall the first time I saw this movie, and the huge emotional reaction I had at seeing a man who has done nothing but sacrifice all his life kicked when he's down (if you remember what happens immediately after he prays for help you'll know what I mean).Ultimately, this movie changed my life. It taught me about the importance of friends, self-sacrifice, and living your life doing what you know it right.

This movie provides an unusual glimpse into a common fantasy: What life would be like if you had never been born.  It's about optimism, choices, courage, and also the darker side of human nature.  The subject of suicide is dealt with in a straightforward, hospitable manner.  Stewart as George Bailey is haunted by his negative perception of what lies ahead.  Bailey is down and out, and virtually at the end of his rope.  He desperately feels there is no way out . . .  That is until the distinct possibility of a guardian angel is playfully introduced.  When &quot;George&quot; confides to the angel that he is &quot;going off my nut,&quot; audiences of the new millennium realize that maybe not all that much has changed in the past sixty or seventy years.  The difference is found most obviously in the hometown feeling and neighborly characters that offer a friendly &quot;Mom and Pop&quot; type assistance not found in today's &quot;Big Box&quot; atmosphere.  A little known tidbit is that some strange developments occurred following the death of Henry F. Potter (no relation to Harry).  Instead of becoming an angel, he went to hell, and returned as the unsavory recluse who antagonizes a well casted sorority (who encounter infamous misfortunes) in another Holiday classic, &quot;Black Christmas&quot;.  &quot;Black Christmas&quot; presents unthinkable possibilities of what could happen if there are more troubled souls than available guardian angels.  &quot;Black Christmas&quot; followed by &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; is the perfect double movie billing to make any Holiday festivities complete!",5,&quot;Wonderful Life&quot; Just Half of the Perfect Double Feature!!,970531200,"10 3, 2000",2000,2307,"['Crystal', 'clarity', 'outstanding', 'sound', 'quality', 'make', 'DVD', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'quot', 'purchase', 'Christmas', 'list', 'However', 'universal', 'themes', 'presented', 'film', 'are', 'ALL', 'MEANS', 'useful', 'year', 'round', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Try', 'watching', 'glory', 'elegance', 'subtitles', 'fresh', 'alternative', 'crude', 'inhospitable', 'language', 'spoken', 'gangster', 'hoodlums', 'who', 'have', 'infiltrated', 'today', 'motion', 'picture', 'industry', 'degraded', 'product', 'epic', 'proportions', 'Watching', 'Stewart', 'being', 'pulled', 'icy', 'water', 'French', 'viable', 'option', 'true', 'icing', 'cake', 'DVD', 'primary', 'bonus', 'feature', 'quot', 'Making', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'movie', 'unusual', 'glimpse', 'common', 'fantasy', 'What', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'optimism', 'choices', 'courage', 'also', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'subject', 'suicide', 'dealt', 'straightforward', 'hospitable', 'manner', 'Stewart', 'George', 'Bailey', 'haunted', 'negative', 'perception', 'what', 'ahead', 'Bailey', 'down', 'virtually', 'end', 'rope', 'desperately', 'feels', 'way', 'out', 'distinct', 'possibility', 'guardian', 'angel', 'playfully', 'introduced', 'When', 'quot', 'George', 'quot', 'confides', 'angel', 'quot', 'going', 'nut', 'quot', 'audiences', 'new', 'millennium', 'realize', 'maybe', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'changed', 'past', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'years', 'difference', 'found', 'most', 'obviously', 'hometown', 'feeling', 'neighborly', 'characters', 'offer', 'friendly', 'quot', 'Mom', 'Pop', 'quot', 'assistance', 'not', 'found', 'today', 'quot', 'Big', 'Box', 'quot', 'atmosphere', 'little', 'known', 'tidbit', 'strange', 'developments', 'occurred', 'following', 'death', 'Henry', 'F.', 'Potter', 'relation', 'Harry', 'Instead', 'becoming', 'angel', 'went', 'hell', 'returned', 'unsavory', 'recluse', 'who', 'well', 'casted', 'sorority', 'who', 'encounter', 'infamous', 'misfortunes', 'Holiday', 'classic', 'quot', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'quot', 'quot', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'quot', 'presents', 'unthinkable', 'possibilities', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'are', 'more', 'troubled', 'souls', 'available', 'guardian', 'angels', 'quot', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'quot', 'followed', 'quot', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'perfect', 'double', 'movie', 'billing', 'make', 'Holiday', 'festivities', 'complete']",N/A

40009,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,0782002064,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 1]","One of the most heartwarming and uplifting films ever created, Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life perfectly captures the human spirit through faith, love and second chances, and beautifully weaves an unforgettable tale. Essentially a twist on Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", the characters are richly developed and each scene is elegantly directed. Jimmy Stewart displays the purest of human emotions with unbeatable acting, as does the superlative supporting cast including Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore.In Bedford Falls, George Bailey (James Stewart) contemplates suicide. Through the prayers of countless friends, an angel named Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers) is sent to Earth to help George in his plight. From here the story backtracks with a narration by Joseph, the head angel, to fill in the details of Bailey's life. As a young boy he saves his brother Harry from drowning, and later after the untimely death of his father, stays in Bedford Falls to help run the Business and Loan Company, started by his father and business partner, Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), years ago. George desperately wants to leave the small town that he's been cooped up in his whole life, but continually finds himself staying, first to save the business, then to allow his younger brother to go off to college, and finally to wed childhood sweetheart Mary Hatch (Donna Reed). When the conniving Mr. Potter, the richest man in town, who has been trying to buy out the Business and Loan Company his entire life, discovers a banking error that could destroy the fledgling company, George becomes impetuous and is convinced he's worth more dead than alive. ""Is he sick?"" asks the angel Clarence. ""No, worse"", responds Joseph. ""He's discouraged"".Jimmy Stewart turns in a tour de force of Christmas spirit, hope and anguish, and he lights up the screen like few others. His acting is flawless and his emotions utterly genuine. Donna Reed is also exceptional as Mary, the girl who is madly in love with George and content with waiting until he realizes his feelings are reciprocal. It is a timeless romance and an essential part of this film which is often overlooked by the comparisons to Scrooge's revelations in ""A Christmas Carol"". The love story is prominent and heartfelt, and while noticeably characterized by the 40's strict sense of decent relationships, an inspiring image that never fades. Lionel Barrymore plays Mr. Potter, the ""Grinch"" character who never does receive proper requital, although we are content knowing he never rises above the changeless miserable miser figure he holds throughout the film. He hates everyone who has anything he doesn't have - although money has never been one of those things.And then there's Clarence, the simple angel who is anxious to receive his wings by helping Bailey realize the value of God's greatest gift. Henry Travers portrays Clarence with wonderfully elementary honesty and presents humorous situations of disbelief for George, which quickly turns to panic at the insistence and demonstration of Clarence's guardian angel abilities. Clarence, while only appearing at the very end of the film, is a major player, giving George the chance to see what life would be like in Bedford Falls if he were never born. George spends a great deal of time struggling with disbelief at Pottersville, so renamed because of his absence in preventing Potter from taking over the town. His friends and family don't recognize him, and he is reduced to tears at all of the now indifferent lives he didn't know he had touched. As Clarence points out, it's remarkable to see how many people are influenced by a single individual.Written, produced and directed by the legendary Frank Capra, It's A Wonderful Life created countless poignant and memorable moments and themes that would later be referenced and remembered in future filmmaking. George wants to do big and important things away from Bedford Falls, realizing only at the conclusion how important it was for him not to accomplish those goals. The broken down Waldorf hotel becomes the home of George and Mary's dreams and even the location for the perfect honeymoon, one that the newlyweds missed out on initially, and George shouting from the top of the very bridge he nearly leapt from: ""I want to live again!"" In the end, George is the richest man in town, measured not by his wealth, but by his friends.- Mike Massie",5,It's a Wonderful Life Movie Review,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,4412,"['One', 'most', 'heartwarming', 'uplifting', 'films', 'ever', 'created', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'perfectly', 'human', 'spirit', 'faith', 'love', 'second', 'chances', 'beautifully', 'unforgettable', 'tale', 'Essentially', 'twist', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'characters', 'are', 'richly', 'developed', 'scene', 'elegantly', 'directed', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'purest', 'human', 'emotions', 'unbeatable', 'acting', 'superlative', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore.In', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'George', 'Bailey', 'James', 'Stewart', 'suicide', 'prayers', 'countless', 'friends', 'angel', 'named', 'Clarence', 'Oddbody', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'sent', 'Earth', 'help', 'George', 'plight', 'here', 'story', 'backtracks', 'narration', 'Joseph', 'head', 'angel', 'fill', 'details', 'Bailey', 'life', 'young', 'boy', 'brother', 'Harry', 'drowning', 'later', 'untimely', 'death', 'father', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'help', 'run', 'Business', 'Loan', 'Company', 'started', 'father', 'business', 'partner', 'Uncle', 'Billy', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'years', 'ago', 'George', 'desperately', 'leave', 'small', 'town', 'been', 'cooped', 'up', 'whole', 'life', 'continually', 'staying', 'first', 'save', 'business', 'then', 'allow', 'younger', 'brother', 'go', 'off', 'college', 'finally', 'wed', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Mary', 'Hatch', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'When', 'conniving', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'richest', 'man', 'town', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'buy', 'out', 'Business', 'Loan', 'Company', 'entire', 'life', 'banking', 'error', 'could', 'destroy', 'fledgling', 'company', 'George', 'impetuous', 'convinced', 'more', 'dead', 'alive', 'sick', 'angel', 'Clarence', 'No', 'worse', 'Joseph', 'discouraged', '.Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'tour', 'force', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'hope', 'anguish', 'up', 'screen', 'few', 'others', 'acting', 'flawless', 'emotions', 'utterly', 'genuine', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'also', 'exceptional', 'Mary', 'girl', 'who', 'madly', 'love', 'George', 'content', 'waiting', 'feelings', 'are', 'reciprocal', 'timeless', 'romance', 'essential', 'part', 'film', 'often', 'overlooked', 'comparisons', 'Scrooge', 'revelations', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'love', 'story', 'prominent', 'heartfelt', 'noticeably', 'characterized', '40', 'strict', 'sense', 'decent', 'relationships', 'inspiring', 'image', 'never', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'Grinch', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'receive', 'requital', 'are', 'content', 'knowing', 'never', 'changeless', 'miserable', 'miser', 'figure', 'film', 'everyone', 'who', 'anything', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'things.And', 'then', 'Clarence', 'simple', 'angel', 'who', 'anxious', 'receive', 'wings', 'helping', 'Bailey', 'realize', 'value', 'God', 'greatest', 'gift', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'Clarence', 'wonderfully', 'elementary', 'honesty', 'presents', 'humorous', 'situations', 'disbelief', 'George', 'quickly', 'panic', 'insistence', 'demonstration', 'Clarence', 'guardian', 'angel', 'abilities', 'Clarence', 'only', 'appearing', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'major', 'player', 'giving', 'George', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'were', 'never', 'born', 'George', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'struggling', 'disbelief', 'Pottersville', 'so', 'renamed', 'absence', 'preventing', 'Potter', 'taking', 'over', 'town', 'friends', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'reduced', 'tears', 'now', 'indifferent', 'lives', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'touched', 'Clarence', 'points', 'out', 'remarkable', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'influenced', 'single', 'individual.Written', 'produced', 'directed', 'legendary', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'created', 'countless', 'poignant', 'memorable', 'moments', 'themes', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'referenced', 'remembered', 'future', 'filmmaking', 'George', 'do', 'big', 'important', 'things', 'away', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'realizing', 'only', 'conclusion', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'not', 'accomplish', 'goals', 'broken', 'down', 'Waldorf', 'hotel', 'home', 'George', 'Mary', 'dreams', 'even', 'location', 'perfect', 'honeymoon', 'one', 'newlyweds', 'missed', 'out', 'initially', 'George', 'shouting', 'top', 'very', 'bridge', 'nearly', 'leapt', 'want', 'live', 'again', 'end', 'George', 'richest', 'man', 'town', 'measured', 'not', 'wealth', 'friends.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

DVD edition of the movie, and 2nd by Paramount. If you didn't upgrade to last year's 60th Edition from Paramount and still own one of the older (Silver Screen or other) copies, this would be the one to upgrade. I did a side by side comparison of my Silver Screen DVD to this one, and the new black and white transfer is a massive improvement; the difference is easily noticeable.Or, you can wait until Paramount decides to re-release it again, which they most definitely will.

At the point in the story where all of George's friends have just finished college, while he is still stuck in Bedford Falls tending to the Bailey family's Savings and Loan, strikes a familiar chord.  At that time in my life I was a weary engineering graduate student, and felt that my life would never really get going.  Stewart plays George Bailey at that age as sullen and indifferent to any possibility that his life might take a turn for the better.

40032,A1C80B497LCYKA,0782002064,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[7, 8]","IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is arguably one of the best films ever made - certainly the best Christmas film. Frank Capra is one of the most talented directors Hollywood ever produced, and he considered this to be his favorite film. It has been called sentimental - I would call it heart-warming. It is full of what makes life - and a film - wonderful. As far as I know, Jimmy Stewart was the only actor Capra ever had in mind for the part of George Bailey. This is not true of the other characters, although it would be hard to imagine anyone else in any of the roles other than the talented cast he chose. The script is superb, the set is one of the largest ever built, the cinematography is excellent. It is, in essence, a wonderful film of a wonderful story of a wonderful life.You can't beat a story about a person whose life is falling apart, finds himself on the brink of disaster and, through some turn-of-events, changes and comes back. George Bailey is such a person. He has spent his life doing the right thing and helping people whose backs are up against a wall, only to find his own back there and no one to help. He once had big plans for his life - he wanted to build things - but circumstances and his own character have not allowed him to realize those dreams. He has ended up doing the one thing he told himself he would never do: end up living in Bedford Falls running his father's Savings-and-Loan.But he cares about people. And he's got some wonderful relationships, not the least of which is his wife Mary, played by Donna Reed (who was an unknown at the time). Mary gives George everything he needs in a spouse: love, respect, support, a home, a family and a wonderful companion. George is blessed, but his life has not been easy, especially because of the town ""Scrooge,"" Potter, played by Lionel Barrymore. Potter owns everything - except the Savings-and-Loan. He'd like to own it, but George Bailey stands in his way. The Savings-and-Loan is the only way average people can own a home in Bedford Falls. If Potter gets his hands on it, he'll control the lives of everyone in the town and be able to keep what he calls ""the riff raff"" in his slums.Now, once again, circumstances take a turn for the worse: Uncle Billy (played by Thomas Mitchell), who works for the Savings-and-Loan, loses $8,000. In 1946, at the time of our story and the movie, this is enough money to put them out of business. Potter, who is aware of the loss, sees this as his opportunity to destroy the Saving-and-Loan and put George in jail. George desperately turns to God in prayer. Then, depressed, he gets drunk. Then, hopeless, he decides to take his own life by jumping off a bridge - but he's stopped by an angel.He's not just any angel: he's an angel second class named Clarence (played by Henry Travers), who is striving to earn his wings. Clarence is like someone out of the 19th century, when he had his last assignment on earth. When George tells him that it would have been better if he, George, had never been born, Clarence gets an idea. He decides that the best way to help George see the value of his own life is to show him what the world would have been like without George Bailey.It takes some convincing for George to realize that things have changed: he hasn't been born, so all the good he's done - including saving his brother's life, who later saves an entire ship of Navy men - never took place. Bedford Falls has become Pottersville, a decadent cesspool of hopeless despair. After George experiences incident after eye-opening incident of the difference his life has made, he returns to the bridge and cries out to God to let him live and to take him back to his life, which He does.Even though his circumstances haven't changed, George has. He realizes that, in spite of his circumstances, he is living a wonderful life that is making a huge difference in the lives of others. Before it's over, he realizes something else: because of the life he's living, he has a lot of wonderful people who care for him. As his brother puts it, ""To George Bailey, the richest man in town."" George is rich, but not in money. Potter may be rich in gold, but George is rich in something far more valuable - friends. It's a timely message that will always be needed. It's a story that only gets richer with the telling. And it's a film that seems to get better with age.Waitsel Smith",5,"BEST CHRISTMAS FILM, ONE OF BEST FILMS EVER",1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,4383,"['IT', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'certainly', 'best', 'Christmas', 'film', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'produced', 'considered', 'be', 'favorite', 'film', 'been', 'called', 'sentimental', 'would', 'call', 'heart-warming', 'full', 'what', 'life', 'film', 'wonderful', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'was', 'only', 'actor', 'Capra', 'ever', 'had', 'mind', 'part', 'George', 'Bailey', 'not', 'true', 'other', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'roles', 'other', 'talented', 'cast', 'chose', 'script', 'superb', 'set', 'one', 'largest', 'ever', 'built', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'essence', 'wonderful', 'film', 'wonderful', 'story', 'wonderful', 'life.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'story', 'person', 'life', 'falling', 'apart', 'brink', 'disaster', 'turn-of-events', 'changes', 'back', 'George', 'Bailey', 'such', 'person', 'spent', 'life', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'helping', 'people', 'backs', 'are', 'up', 'wall', 'only', 'find', 'own', 'back', 'one', 'help', 'once', 'had', 'big', 'plans', 'life', 'wanted', 'build', 'things', 'circumstances', 'own', 'character', 'have', 'not', 'allowed', 'realize', 'dreams', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'one', 'thing', 'told', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'living', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'running', 'father', 'Savings-and-Loan.But', 'people', 'got', 'wonderful', 'relationships', 'not', 'least', 'wife', 'Mary', 'played', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'who', 'was', 'unknown', 'time', 'Mary', 'George', 'everything', 'spouse', 'love', 'respect', 'support', 'home', 'family', 'wonderful', 'companion', 'George', 'blessed', 'life', 'not', 'been', 'easy', 'especially', 'town', 'Scrooge', 'Potter', 'played', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Potter', 'everything', 'Savings-and-Loan', ""'d"", 'like', 'own', 'George', 'Bailey', 'way', 'Savings-and-Loan', 'only', 'way', 'average', 'people', 'can', 'own', 'home', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'Potter', 'hands', ""'ll"", 'control', 'lives', 'everyone', 'town', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'what', 'riff', 'raff', 'slums.Now', 'once', 'again', 'circumstances', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'Uncle', 'Billy', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'Savings-and-Loan', '8,000', '1946', 'time', 'story', 'movie', 'enough', 'money', 'put', 'business', 'Potter', 'who', 'aware', 'loss', 'opportunity', 'destroy', 'Saving-and-Loan', 'put', 'George', 'jail', 'George', 'desperately', 'God', 'prayer', 'Then', 'depressed', 'drunk', 'Then', 'hopeless', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'jumping', 'off', 'bridge', 'stopped', 'angel.He', 'not', 'just', 'angel', 'angel', 'second', 'class', 'named', 'Clarence', 'played', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'who', 'striving', 'earn', 'wings', 'Clarence', 'someone', '19th', 'century', 'when', 'had', 'last', 'assignment', 'earth', 'When', 'George', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'George', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'Clarence', 'idea', 'best', 'way', 'help', 'George', 'see', 'value', 'own', 'life', 'show', 'what', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'George', 'Bailey.It', 'convincing', 'George', 'realize', 'things', 'have', 'changed', ""n't"", 'been', 'born', 'good', 'done', 'including', 'saving', 'brother', 'life', 'who', 'later', 'entire', 'ship', 'Navy', 'men', 'never', 'took', 'place', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'become', 'Pottersville', 'decadent', 'cesspool', 'hopeless', 'despair', 'George', 'experiences', 'incident', 'eye-opening', 'incident', 'difference', 'life', 'made', 'bridge', 'cries', 'out', 'God', 'let', 'live', 'take', 'back', 'life', 'circumstances', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'George', 'spite', 'circumstances', 'living', 'wonderful', 'life', 'making', 'huge', 'difference', 'lives', 'others', 'over', 'something', 'else', 'life', 'living', 'lot', 'wonderful', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'brother', 'George', 'Bailey', 'richest', 'man', 'town', 'George', 'rich', 'not', 'money', 'Potter', 'may', 'be', 'rich', 'gold', 'George', 'rich', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'valuable', 'friends', 'timely', 'message', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'needed', 'story', 'only', 'richer', 'telling', 'film', 'get', 'better', 'age.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A

If our tears are genuine and if our satisfaction about the harmonious ending of the film has any meaning - what are we doing about it? Do we prefer cooperative banking over large bank efficiency?

It's funny, and gripping, and suspenseful, and gut-wrenching, and the final scene makes you want to stand up and cheer, with happy tears running down your cheeks.George Bailey is a quintessential American in this most American of films: From childhood, this bright, energetic youth wants to ""shake the dust of this crummy little town"" Bedford Falls from his feet, see the world, build things, do great deeds. But ... while his mind wants to do things for himself, his spirit instinctively and unhesitatingly drives him to help others. He saves his younger brother from drowning, losing the hearing in one ear in the process; he saves his part-time employer the druggist Mr. Gower from accidentally poisoning a family with a prescription wrongly mixed while Gower is mourning the death of his son. Later, as an adult, George Bailey saves his late father's savings and loan from the clutches of the grasping millionaire Henry F. Potter, the ""meanest man in town"" who puts us greatly in mind of Ebenezer Scrooge.George marries his childhood sweetheart, Mary Hatch. The scene I remember the most clearly from the first time I saw the film, as a child, was the one where little Mary whispers into little George's left ear, which she believes he can't hear out of, ""George Bailey, I'll love you 'til the day I die!"" I've often wondered if he really didn't hear her -- or whether he just showed a remarkable self-possession for a young boy in not reacting.Potter, thwarted in his efforts to destroy the Bailey Savings & Loan, finally calls George to his office one day and offers him ""the chance of a lifetime"" -- employment as Potter's properties manager, at an un-heard of (in 1946) $20,000 a year, trips to New York City and Europe for himself and his wife ... One thinks of Jesus Christ wandering in the desert, and Satan appearing and offering him all the riches in the world if he will only betray his mission on earth. George Bailey almost succumbs -- until he shakes hands with Potter, realizes what he's about to do, and with an angry wave of disgust, says, in effect, ""Get thee behind me, Potter!""The years pass, George and Mary have four children -- and then one day George's kind but bumbling uncle, Billy Bailey, loses $8,000 in cash of the savings and loan's money while on the way to deposit it in the bank. Events quickly spiral into the crucial night of George Bailey's life.All is resolved happily in the denouement, of course; Americans have always demanded happy endings. This one is almost overwhelming, with all the people who have appeared in the film gathered in the Bailey living room on Christmas Eve, having come to the rescue of this unselfish, self-sacrificing man who has helped so many of them. As the camera pans all the by-now familiar faces, the crowd sings ""Auld Lang Syne."" One is reminded of certain Shakespeare plays which also ended with a sing-along by the cast. Meanwhile, George, Mary and little Zuzu, their youngest child, decide that Clarence the Angel's saying, ""Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings,"" is true indeed.The casting and direction of this movie are impeccable. It was the last and greatest of Frank Capra's series of ""triumph of the little man"" movies. James Stewart probably never gave a better performance; Donna Reed, not a towering star, was nevertheless just right as Mary Bailey. Lionel Barrymore's villain Potter is convincing to the nth degree. Thomas Mitchell, one of the great character actors, does a wonderful job as Uncle Billy, whose simple goodness is attested by the animals (the crow, the squirrel) who fly and scurry to him as to a close friend.Is ""It's A Wonderful Life"" the best movie ever made?

A story of looking at our lives, not at the bad, but the good. Of discovering how we have affected others.Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey, a resident of Bedford Falls, who doesn't realize that he has affected so many people's lives in good ways. He mostly concerns himself with the present, which at the time isn't good. He has run into debt problems with his father's Savings and Loans building and attempts suicide. It's up to an angel named Clarence to save George and convince him he's led a good life.Throughout his life, George was always a thorn in the side of Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the owner of about everything in town except for the Bailey Loans building. George gave up going to college or around the world just so he could run the building. In this, he prevented Potter from taking over and being able to charge whatever rent he wanted and thus ripping off the people of Bedford Falls by having them live in rundown slums. But George's life was much more than that. If it weren't for him, the lives of his brother, the owner of a store (Who George worked for), of his wife and of about everyone in town would be very different.It is indeed difficult to review a movie like this, what with thousands of words already said about it. While there was some sappiness in it, particulary the ending, there is nothing wrong with this movie. It can cheer you up because it makes us think about all the good things we have done. Than again, if we have lead a bad life like Mr. Potter, it won't make us too happy.George Bailey may not have been as financially wealthy as Potter. But because he was friends with practically the whole town, he was very much wealthier. Okay, so in real life the whole town probably would not give George all their money just so he could be out of debt. But it certainly makes you think.

40038,A17JVVAKWEB0M,0782002064,Wesley Mullins,"[4, 6]","For those of you visiting Earth for the first time and who have no idea what this film is about, here is a review:""It's A Wonderful Life"" begins in heaven, as angels discuss the sudden glut of prayers from the citizens of Bedford Falls, as they ask for help for George Bailey.  A man worthy of support from above, the angels decide to help George and dispatch Clarence, an angel in training, to do the job.The first ninety minutes of the film work as Clarence's (and the audience's) crash-course in George Bailey 101, as Clarence views the most important events in Bailey's life.  Clarence sees George as a little boy saving his brother's life and correcting potentially dangerous errors of his original employer, the town pharmacist.  As the young boy grows into an adult (Jimmy Stewart in the role for which he will most be remembered), George's life becomes one of compromise.  His dreams of seeing the world and a life of ""importance"" must be tempered and put on hold, as George settles for a job in his father's building and loan.  His friends and younger brother go off to exciting careers and fight in WWII, while George gets stuck in Bedford Falls and tries to convince the townsfolk to invest in each others' homes.Clarence comes in to George's life just as he has decided his life is a failure.  Wishing he had never been born, Clarence grants that request and lets George see Bedford Falls as it would be without George Bailey.  What follows is a declaration as to the power of the individual, as George gets to see how much his life changed the world for the better.Singed into our culture and as regular a part of the Christmas season as long lines at Wal-Mart, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is the rare film that literally affects people's actions.  Almost everyone sees in George Bailey the humanity that we all can be and once dreamed of being.  The yearly viewing of this film reminds people of noble intentions they once had and the compromises we all make along the way.  I have no doubt that the night after this film is shown each year (usually the Saturday after Thanksgiving) people all across our country hit their pillows with goals and promises of doing better and doing more with their lives.

This enables him to see why everyone will be better off without him and he saves them from himself by using the portal to wipe away his life and the subsequent destruction it causes.

For those who have complained about the 60th anniversary edition in the past, you may not be surprised to hear that Paramount has not gotten rid of that annoying Queen Latifa trailer when you first pop the DVD in. It's the exact disc in all actuallity. They just added a bonus disc, the colorized version, with no addition bonus features.Now, I was very upset with this news. I was hoping there would finally be a DVD to accomidate the classic film appropriately and without commercialism to other Paramount movies and products. However, that day still has not come.With my dissapointment with the packaging of this film, I still give the overall rating four stars based on the brilliance and beautifully done colorization on disc two. They definately spent some time and consideration in this new process as even the pictures of individuals around the living room and offices remain in black and white as they would have in real life.

40049,AP3B615GM191G,0782002064,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","One of the hallmarks of a truly classic film is its ability to make the viewer wonder, partially in exclamation but also partly in all seriousness, ""what was the world like before this experience?!"".  ""It's A Wonderful Life"" provides that exact emotion, as perhaps no movie in the history of cinema has concocted a better mixture of acting, emotional, seasonal relevance, and a story that will reach into the very depths of your soul.For a basic plot summary, ""Wonderful Life"" tells the story of George Bailey (James Stewart), a simple man from a simple town (Bedford Falls) who desperately wants to escape his father's ""Building & Loan"" business and travel the world.  Every time he is about to take that ""next step"", however, George (through both external and internal devices) remains in Bedford Falls managing the family business.  Along the way, he marries childhood sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed), morally classes with iron-clad town business baron Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), and eventually ends up building a life in the very place he once so desperately wanted to escape from.  On Christmas Eve, however, George is dealt a horrific blow and is on the verge of ending his own life until he discovers he has a guardian angel looking out for him, showing him what a sad place a George Bailey-less world would be.The main reason this movie works so well is because we all have a little bit of George Bailey in us.  That is why the poignant moments of this film capture our deepest emotions and promote serious life-reflection...because we know how easily each one of us could be (or even are) living out the actions of Mr. Bailey on a daily basis.This incredible plot is then bolstered by the perfect casting choice of ""everyman"" Jimmy Stewart to play the lead.  Because Mr. Stewart is an actor that we can all relate to, due to his spot-on portrayal of real human emotions, we can not only ""think"" the plot, but also ""live"" it vicariously through Stewart.  The other cast members (especially Barrymore as the nefarious Potter) are brilliant as well, with each knowing just how to coax the right amount of emotion out of his/her role.In short, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is easily one of the greatest motion pictures ever constructed.  It is completely genre-diverse, can be enjoyed by the entire family, and will thoroughly entertain you while also prompting some pretty deep introspection.  If for some reason you haven't seen this gem, you have made a terrible mistake (!).",5,Can One Even Imagine A Time Without This Movie?,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,2479,"['One', 'hallmarks', 'truly', 'classic', 'film', 'ability', 'make', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'partially', 'exclamation', 'also', 'partly', 'seriousness', 'what', 'was', 'world', 'experience', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'exact', 'emotion', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'history', 'cinema', 'concocted', 'better', 'mixture', 'acting', 'emotional', 'seasonal', 'relevance', 'story', 'will', 'reach', 'very', 'depths', 'soul.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'story', 'George', 'Bailey', 'James', 'Stewart', 'simple', 'man', 'simple', 'town', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'who', 'desperately', 'escape', 'father', 'Building', 'Loan', 'business', 'travel', 'world', 'time', 'take', 'next', 'step', 'however', 'George', 'external', 'internal', 'devices', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'managing', 'family', 'business', 'way', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Mary', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'morally', 'iron-clad', 'town', 'business', 'baron', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'eventually', 'up', 'building', 'life', 'very', 'place', 'once', 'so', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'escape', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'however', 'George', 'dealt', 'horrific', 'blow', 'verge', 'ending', 'own', 'life', 'guardian', 'angel', 'looking', 'out', 'showing', 'what', 'sad', 'place', 'George', 'Bailey-less', 'world', 'would', 'be.The', 'main', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'George', 'Bailey', 'why', 'poignant', 'moments', 'film', 'capture', 'deepest', 'emotions', 'promote', 'serious', 'life-reflection', 'know', 'how', 'easily', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'are', 'living', 'out', 'actions', 'Mr.', 'Bailey', 'daily', 'basis.This', 'incredible', 'plot', 'then', 'bolstered', 'perfect', 'casting', 'choice', 'everyman', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'play', 'lead', 'Mr.', 'Stewart', 'actor', 'can', 'relate', 'due', 'spot-on', 'portrayal', 'real', 'human', 'emotions', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'think', 'plot', 'also', 'live', 'vicariously', 'Stewart', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'especially', 'Barrymore', 'nefarious', 'Potter', 'are', 'brilliant', 'well', 'knowing', 'just', 'how', 'coax', 'right', 'amount', 'emotion', 'his/her', 'role.In', 'short', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'easily', 'one', 'greatest', 'motion', 'pictures', 'ever', 'constructed', 'completely', 'genre-diverse', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'entertain', 'also', 'prompting', 'pretty', 'deep', 'introspection', 'reason', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'gem', 'have', 'made', 'terrible', 'mistake']",N/A
