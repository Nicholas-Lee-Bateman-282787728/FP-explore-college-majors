After being invited to a ranch for a little R & R with her fellow classmates, she becomes the object of affection for a lunatic that is willing to kill off the competition.All the Boys Mandy Lane is smarter then your usual slasher in the sense that it doesn't resort to a ton of gory killings right off the bat. It takes the time to create mood, tension, unease, to set up its premise and to establish that the character of Mandy Lane is this teenage Lolita that everyone wants, but that no one can touch. It's the type of film that knows that the build up, the anticipation of horror is always more satisfying then the actual payoff.In between slashings, All the Boys Love Mandy Lane manages to tap into the high school psyche while making comments on teenage anxieties, teenage culture, the objectification of women and Columbine. It's well made, well acted and stylishly photographed with Amber Heard turning in the definitive performance of her career, to date.At the end of the day though, All the Boys Love Mandy Lane is still just another slasher. Albeit, one that is better made and has far more brains then most of its counterparts. It's still not able to escape the overall limitations of the slasher genre though, in that the basic story of the film is yet another killer killing teens. It isn't able to transcend the slasher genre in the way that Halloween or Scream (1996) did. [R] 90 mins.Filmed in 2006. Released overseas in 2008.

1148720,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B001563HYO,CryWolf854,"[1, 1]","What is it about the enigmatic Mandy Lane (sexy Amber Heard; Pineapple Express, The Informers) that has all the boys in her high school lusting after her?  Well, there's a lot physically but it's her virginity that has them all wagging their tails.  One boy has already died for her.  He jumped off the roof of his house in an attempt to impress her.  FAIL!  Nine months go by and Mandy's popularity has grown enough for a group of jocks and cheerleaders to invite her out to a farmhouse in the middle of the country for a little weekend party. BWhat they don't know is that Mandy has a stalker; one who would do anything to possess her young student body.Owing some part to the obscure 1982 slasher Sweet Sixteen and, possibly the most disturbing aspect, a nod to the Columbine Massacre (watch it and you'll know what I'm talking about). There's not a lot of gore per say but the killings are pretty mean spirited. The trouble is though, aside from Mandy and the farmhand, Garth (Anson Mount; Urban Legends: Final Cut, tv's ""Hell On Wheels""), the teens aren't very likable or even worth remembering. The truth is, I couldn't even recall any of their names throughout most of the second half. The girls are all weak and petty backstabbers and the guys openly treat the girls like walking blow up dolls yet each try their hand at Mandy who politely brushes them off. But just how innocent is Mandy? The end will definitely sucker punch the viewer in a way they may not see coming.Overall, the film is a very well crafted film. The pace is good and the suspense is incredible until near the middle when the killer reveals them self.  But in light of the aforementioned Columbine Massacre as well as the recent tragedy at Sandy Hook, this killer's motivation is pretty disturbing. Even the weapon of choice in most of the kills, a high powered rifle, smacks a realism rarely touched in today's horror films.While its unfortunate that All the Boys Love Mandy Lane has yet to be released here in the US, the blu-ray import plays the movie in most blu-ray players despite being rated Region B. The trailer and Interview will not however. The thought of this being a movie that the studios doesn't want you to see appears to have added a kind of alure to horror fans to seek it out.  One can only hope that the movie may some day find its way back home for more fans to show their love for this interesting footnote in the pantheon of horror/slasher films.  Also stars Michael Welch (The Twilight Saga) in one of his first roles which, albeit brief, is much darker than what most Twilight fans have come to know him for.Please note that the rating system in the UK is vastly different than the States'.

1148721,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B001563HYO,C. Sawin,"[23, 27]","*This does contain minor spoilers*Mandy Lane has apparently become the most desirable girl in high school over the summer. She's definitely not like the other girls her age though. While every guy wants to do everything imaginable to her, she's turned them all down. The only guy she really gives the time of day is her best friend, Emmet. That is until a certain incident at a pool party comes between them. Now nine months later, Mandy has distanced herself from Emmet and has a group of new friends. These friends have decided to invite Mandy to a ranch out in the middle of nowhere for a few days and the guys who tag along hope to accomplish what, up to this point, has been impossible. It turns out to not all be fun and games though. When people start turning up missing, they soon realize that they're not alone and someone is taking their obsession with Mandy Lane a little too far.All the Boys Love Mandy Lane is an interesting film, to say the least. It makes you wait a bit before the actual ""horror"" comes into play. In fact, the first forty minutes or so are basically filled with high school shenanigans. A bunch of kids drinking, doing drugs, having sex, and just things they're not supposed to. While the last half of the film, is pure horror. It kind of teases you at first. It gives you a little taste and then goes right back into high school mode, but after that things just start to snowball until it's just beautifully horrific in every scene.The film is shot beautifully. For an indie film, it looks incredible. That's not to say other indie films look like garbage or anything. Mandy Lane just has vibrant colors that seem to jump off the screen. One of the things that caught my eye is the way certain scenes were shot. Unique perspectives, shots overlapping others to look like something else, the way objects in front of the camera go in and out of focus, etc. Scenes like when Bird goes to start the generator after the power goes out, Bird confronting the killer, and the car chase with Chloe being chased by the killer in her car are a few examples. It just seemed like something that was worth mentioning as you don't see too many shots, scenes, or anything in films anymore(especially horror) that you can call unique.I think Michael Welch deserves a nod for his acting in this. It was pretty exceptional. I'd really only seen him in the Day of the Dead remake, which was awful on every level. His performance in this overshadows his performance in Day any way you look at it. His portrayal of Emmet in this in the closing moments of the film are what caught my eye. I mean, you truly believe he's psychotic. It'll definitely make me keep an eye on him with his future projects.All the Boys Love Mandy Lane isn't your average slasher film and that's its biggest strength as it brings something fresh to the table. As I mentioned before, it takes awhile for the ball to get rolling in the horror department. If you're patient though, things do wind up paying off. If you could hold off for Wolf Creek to pick up, then I think you'll be in the clear for this. You can probably guess who the killer is within the first few minutes of the film, but the way things unfold are where the film shines. This is worth seeing for the ending alone as while it does reveal why the killer is doing what they're doing and things of that nature, it leaves a lot of things open ended. While that can either be a sink or swim kind of situation, I think it works well this time around. Mandy Lane isn't the most original horror film to come out in decades or anything, but if every horror film from now on had as much originality as this film does...then there might be hope for horror films yet.Rating: 7/10",4,An Interesting Take On the Slasher Genre,1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,3722,"['*This', 'contain', 'minor', 'spoilers*Mandy', 'Lane', 'apparently', 'become', 'most', 'desirable', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'summer', 'definitely', 'not', 'other', 'girls', 'age', 'guy', 'do', 'everything', 'imaginable', 'turned', 'down', 'only', 'guy', 'really', 'time', 'day', 'best', 'friend', 'Emmet', 'certain', 'incident', 'pool', 'party', 'Now', 'nine', 'months', 'later', 'Mandy', 'distanced', 'Emmet', 'group', 'new', 'friends', 'friends', 'have', 'decided', 'invite', 'Mandy', 'ranch', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'few', 'days', 'guys', 'who', 'tag', 'hope', 'accomplish', 'what', 'up', 'point', 'been', 'impossible', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'fun', 'games', 'though', 'When', 'people', 'start', 'turning', 'up', 'missing', 'soon', 'realize', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'someone', 'taking', 'obsession', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'little', 'too', 'far.All', 'Boys', 'Love', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'interesting', 'film', 'say', 'least', 'wait', 'bit', 'actual', 'horror', 'play', 'fact', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'basically', 'filled', 'high', 'school', 'shenanigans', 'bunch', 'kids', 'drinking', 'doing', 'drugs', 'having', 'sex', 'just', 'things', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'pure', 'horror', 'kind', 'teases', 'first', 'little', 'taste', 'then', 'right', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'mode', 'things', 'just', 'start', 'snowball', 'just', 'beautifully', 'horrific', 'scene.The', 'film', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'indie', 'film', 'incredible', 'not', 'say', 'other', 'indie', 'films', 'look', 'like', 'garbage', 'anything', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'just', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'seem', 'jump', 'off', 'screen', 'One', 'things', 'caught', 'eye', 'way', 'certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'Unique', 'shots', 'overlapping', 'others', 'look', 'something', 'else', 'way', 'front', 'camera', 'go', 'focus', 'etc', 'Scenes', 'when', 'Bird', 'start', 'generator', 'power', 'out', 'Bird', 'confronting', 'killer', 'car', 'chase', 'Chloe', 'being', 'chased', 'killer', 'car', 'are', 'few', 'examples', 'just', 'seemed', 'something', 'was', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'too', 'many', 'shots', 'scenes', 'anything', 'films', 'anymore', 'especially', 'horror', 'can', 'call', 'unique.I', 'think', 'Michael', 'Welch', 'nod', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'exceptional', ""'d"", 'really', 'only', 'seen', 'Day', 'Dead', 'remake', 'was', 'awful', 'level', 'performance', 'performance', 'Day', 'way', 'look', 'portrayal', 'Emmet', 'closing', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'what', 'caught', 'eye', 'mean', 'truly', 'believe', 'psychotic', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'make', 'keep', 'eye', 'future', 'Boys', 'Love', 'Mandy', 'Lane', ""n't"", 'average', 'slasher', 'film', 'biggest', 'strength', 'something', 'fresh', 'table', 'mentioned', 'awhile', 'ball', 'get', 'rolling', 'horror', 'department', ""'re"", 'patient', 'things', 'do', 'wind', 'up', 'paying', 'off', 'could', 'hold', 'off', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'pick', 'up', 'then', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'clear', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'who', 'killer', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'way', 'things', 'unfold', 'are', 'where', 'film', 'shines', 'worth', 'seeing', 'ending', 'alone', 'reveal', 'why', 'killer', 'doing', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'things', 'nature', 'lot', 'things', 'open', 'ended', 'can', 'either', 'be', 'sink', 'swim', 'kind', 'situation', 'think', 'well', 'time', 'around', 'Mandy', 'Lane', ""n't"", 'most', 'original', 'horror', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'decades', 'anything', 'horror', 'film', 'now', 'had', 'much', 'originality', 'film', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'hope', 'horror', 'films', 'yet.Rating', '7/10']",N/A

Amazon fulfillment courtesy of Cinema of The World has changed this as I was able to get the UK blu-ray version that was playable in Region 1 players as well, the movie was not a cinematic terror filled masterpiece nor is it genre defining in any way that will stand the test of time like The Silence of The Lambs, The Exorcist, the original versions of Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, or The Evil Dead to name a few classics of the top of my head, yet it was still solid entertainment with better than your usual average run of the mill bland  acting found in most teen related suspense fare, not to mention an unexpected plot twist that delivered for us at least.

Mandy Lane is going, too, but it seems ALL the boys lust for her either because (a) she hasn't showed them her ""twins,"" (b) she hasn't shown them any nether region, (c) she's never been kissed, or (d) all of the above.  Who knows?  Who cares?  Once they finally arrive at their destination, everyone tries to pair off for fun 'n games, and that's when the slasher part of the movie comes in swinging with both fists.First of all, how ANY of these ""teens"" could be standing is beyond my comprehension because the six of them consume more dope, pills, snorty-snorts, liquor, and beer in about four hours time than is consumed at most raves.  And there is every cliched character known to these movies:  the total pot-head, the complete *ick, the black guy, the spoiled little girl who thinks she's better than everyone, the ""in-love-with-the-wrong-jerk"" girl, Sister Mary Virgin (a/k/a Mandy Lane), and the ranch hand ""with a past.""  All that was missing was a mask...""Mandy Lane"" never builds one iota of tension.  It isn't scary, it isn't entertaining, and it certainly isn't worthy of any kind of awards.  It is rated R for ""Caligula""-like debauchery and gore.

1148726,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B001563HYO,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","ALL THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE is a strange combination of qualities. The plot is that of a typical gory, violent, teen vengeance, urban legendish slasher flick. Yet, while I realize that not that many people watch this sort of thing for its depth of characterization, it definitely has some of that: These kids seem quite real in most respects. ABLML has an unspectacular but very realistic script and avoids a lot of the common stereotypes about teenagers, high school, and Texans. Some of the guys who are key players here look and talk rather alike and are easily confused with one other, but I think that was intentional, and it serves its purpose in the end. The individual personalities also become more evident as ABLML progresses. The very end surprises you and then surprises you again.At times, this film seems like a grotesque parody of the doomed high school odd couple, Romeo and Juliet love affair story. It's also very revealing of the psychology behind teenage girls' competitive communities and the defense mechanisms they develop against horny guys. There's a lot of guy-stuff too: Both the camaraderie and rivalries are very real. Though it obviously takes place after the Gulf War, no internet or texting is brought into the story--Maybe it's supposed to be in the '90s, right after Desert Storm? The soundtrack is an odd mixture of the Go-Gos, Beethoven, 60s love 'n heartbreak tunes (Bobby Vinton et al), and various others.ABLML is definitely not for everyone. Some will find it too disturbing and gruesome; others will find it too slow in the middle; and many who just want a standard violent murder flick will find its deviations a little annoying. While I don't generally like films that rely on lots of gore, blood, and violence, I do have a bias towards films that are simply different. I didn't really expect to like ABLML that much; nevertheless, its weird assortment of off-center qualities worked well for me.",4,"Sealed with a Kiss: The Same Old Show, but Very Different",1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,1940,"['BOYS', 'LOVE', 'MANDY', 'LANE', 'strange', 'combination', 'qualities', 'plot', 'typical', 'gory', 'violent', 'teen', 'vengeance', 'urban', 'legendish', 'slasher', 'flick', 'realize', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'watch', 'sort', 'thing', 'depth', 'characterization', 'definitely', 'kids', 'seem', 'quite', 'real', 'most', 'respects', 'ABLML', 'unspectacular', 'very', 'realistic', 'script', 'lot', 'common', 'stereotypes', 'teenagers', 'high', 'school', 'Texans', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'key', 'players', 'here', 'look', 'talk', 'rather', 'alike', 'are', 'easily', 'confused', 'one', 'other', 'think', 'was', 'intentional', 'purpose', 'end', 'individual', 'personalities', 'also', 'become', 'more', 'evident', 'ABLML', 'very', 'end', 'surprises', 'then', 'surprises', 'again.At', 'times', 'film', 'grotesque', 'parody', 'doomed', 'high', 'school', 'odd', 'couple', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'love', 'affair', 'story', 'also', 'very', 'revealing', 'psychology', 'teenage', 'girls', 'competitive', 'communities', 'defense', 'mechanisms', 'develop', 'horny', 'guys', 'lot', 'guy-stuff', 'too', 'camaraderie', 'rivalries', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'obviously', 'place', 'Gulf', 'War', 'internet', 'texting', 'brought', 'story', 'Maybe', 'supposed', 'be', ""'90s"", 'right', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'soundtrack', 'odd', 'mixture', 'Go-Gos', 'Beethoven', '60s', 'love', 'n', 'heartbreak', 'tunes', 'Bobby', 'Vinton', 'et', 'al', 'various', 'others.ABLML', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'find', 'too', 'disturbing', 'gruesome', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'too', 'slow', 'middle', 'many', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'standard', 'violent', 'murder', 'flick', 'will', 'find', 'deviations', 'little', 'annoying', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'like', 'films', 'rely', 'lots', 'gore', 'blood', 'violence', 'do', 'have', 'bias', 'towards', 'films', 'are', 'simply', 'different', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'like', 'ABLML', 'much', 'nevertheless', 'weird', 'assortment', 'off-center', 'qualities', 'worked', 'well']",N/A

1148729,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B001563HYO,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[3, 3]","&#34;Warm Bodies&#34; Director Jonathan Levine's &#34;All The Boys Love Mandy Lane&#34; finally gets a release thanks to Anchor Bay Entertainment and the Weinstein Company. What plays out like a typical slasher film for 75% of its run time is saved by a dose of indie charm and wit, some clever social commentary, and an ending you never see coming. It also gives actors Amber Heard (&#34;Zombieland&#34;) and Michael Welch (&#34;The Twilight Saga&#34;) a chance to shine brightly as the two main characters.Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) is constantly pursued by every male in the small Texas high school she attends, much to the dismay of her best friend Emmet (Michael Welch). He has a secret crush on her. Mandy surprisingly accepts an invitation from her new-found friends to join them in a weekend getaway fueled by drugs and alcohol. Each guy fails when taking their turn trying to get together with Mandy. As the sun sets, a mysterious figure begins picking off the partiers one-by-one.The high-definition audio and video transfers for &#34;All The Boys Love Mandy Lane&#34; look great for a movie made for $750,000. It's presented in 1080p widescreen (2.40:1) and 5.1 DTSHD-MA surround sound. The picture is clean with good color levels, but maintains a gritty feel not unlike the original &#34;Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&#34; The soundtrack and audio is nothing special, but is efficient in keeping you rooted in the movie.Either Anchor Bay Entertainment or Jonathan Levine dropped the ball when it comes to special features for &#34;All The Boys Love Mandy Lane.&#34; I'm surprised that they couldn't come up with some behind-the-scenes featurettes or picture galleries of the making of the film. They could've even featured film festival footage and interviews. You'd think 7 years would give someone enough of an opportunity to come up with some interesting bonus material. Feature commentary is provided by Director Jonathan Levine.&#34;All The Boys Love Mandy Lane&#34; is justifiably rated R. It contains strong disturbing violence, pervasive drug and alcohol use, sexuality/nudity, and language - all involving teens. The movie would have you believe that all teens act in the manner shown onscreen. Not to sound like an old man, but I certainly hope not.The kids are the bratty and bullying &#34;cool&#34; crowd and jocks in school and, as much as I hate saying it, didn't get much sympathy from me when getting axed. I'm not condoning violence towards anyone in real life. However, it sure looks good on film sometimes.&#34;All The Boys Love Mandy Lane&#34; serve as social commentary on teenagers' obsessions with their appearances and fitting in. It also touches on the negative effects of unrequited love, deception, and rejection. Although the film isn't perfect by any means, it tackles a lot of issues for a micro-budgeted independent slasher flick.",4,"""All the Boys Love Mandy Lane"" Finally Gets Blu-ray/DVD Release",1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,2866,"['34', 'Warm', 'Bodies', '34', 'Director', 'Jonathan', 'Levine', '34', 'Boys', 'Love', 'Mandy', 'Lane', '34', 'finally', 'release', 'thanks', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'Weinstein', 'Company', 'What', 'out', 'typical', 'slasher', 'film', '75', '%', 'run', 'time', 'saved', 'dose', 'indie', 'charm', 'wit', 'clever', 'social', 'commentary', 'ending', 'never', 'see', 'coming', 'also', 'actors', 'Amber', 'Heard', '34', 'Zombieland', '34', 'Michael', 'Welch', '34', 'Twilight', 'Saga', '34', 'chance', 'shine', 'brightly', 'two', 'main', 'characters.Mandy', 'Lane', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'constantly', 'pursued', 'male', 'small', 'Texas', 'high', 'school', 'much', 'dismay', 'best', 'friend', 'Emmet', 'Michael', 'Welch', 'secret', 'crush', 'Mandy', 'surprisingly', 'invitation', 'new-found', 'friends', 'join', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'fueled', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'guy', 'when', 'taking', 'turn', 'trying', 'get', 'together', 'Mandy', 'sun', 'sets', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'picking', 'off', 'partiers', 'one-by-one.The', 'high-definition', 'audio', 'video', 'transfers', '34', 'Boys', 'Love', 'Mandy', 'Lane', '34', 'look', 'great', 'movie', 'made', '750,000', 'presented', '1080p', 'widescreen', '2.40:1', '5.1', 'DTSHD-MA', 'surround', 'sound', 'picture', 'clean', 'good', 'color', 'levels', 'gritty', 'feel', 'not', 'original', '34', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre.', '34', 'soundtrack', 'audio', 'nothing', 'special', 'efficient', 'keeping', 'rooted', 'movie.Either', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'Jonathan', 'Levine', 'dropped', 'ball', 'when', 'special', 'features', '34', 'Boys', 'Love', 'Mandy', 'Lane.', '34', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'picture', 'galleries', 'making', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'even', 'featured', 'film', 'festival', 'footage', 'interviews', ""'d"", 'think', '7', 'years', 'would', 'give', 'someone', 'enough', 'opportunity', 'come', 'up', 'interesting', 'bonus', 'material', 'Feature', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Director', 'Jonathan', 'Levine.', '34', 'Boys', 'Love', 'Mandy', 'Lane', '34', 'justifiably', 'rated', 'R.', 'strong', 'disturbing', 'violence', 'pervasive', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'use', 'sexuality/nudity', 'language', 'involving', 'teens', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'teens', 'act', 'manner', 'shown', 'onscreen', 'Not', 'sound', 'old', 'man', 'certainly', 'hope', 'not.The', 'kids', 'are', 'bratty', 'bullying', '34', 'cool', '34', 'crowd', 'jocks', 'school', 'as', 'much', 'hate', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'sympathy', 'when', 'getting', 'axed', ""'m"", 'not', 'condoning', 'violence', 'towards', 'anyone', 'real', 'life', 'However', 'sure', 'good', 'film', 'sometimes.', '34', 'Boys', 'Love', 'Mandy', 'Lane', '34', 'social', 'commentary', 'teenagers', 'obsessions', 'appearances', 'fitting', 'also', 'negative', 'effects', 'unrequited', 'love', 'deception', 'rejection', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'means', 'lot', 'issues', 'micro-budgeted', 'independent', 'slasher', 'flick']",N/A

As an early work by Amber Heard fans of hers wanted to see it but couldn&#8217;t as it became an near celebrated lost film. Now it&#8217;s out on DVD at long last and well&#8230;ok. The problem is when the dust and wonder settle it&#8217;s really just another slasher flick like so many out there.Mandy is the hottest girl at her High School but unlike so many of her peers seems to have a pretty good head on her shoulders. Since she doesn&#8217;t drink or smoke or fool around this makes her all the more desirable, the unattainable peak to reach as proof you&#8217;re top dog in the school.The movie starts at a party where she isn&#8217;t having a very good time when one of her few real friends, pulls off a stupid prank on a jock that results in the jock&#8217;s death.  The friend is ostracized and Mandy loses one of her few real friends as no one can socialize with someone who stupidly caused a death like that. Fast forward 9 months and it&#8217;s the end of junior year and  there&#8217;s going to be a party at the ranch house of one of the kid&#8217;s with rich parents-like they always have in these films. I never knew people like this when I was at school.Sure enough among the drinking and dope smoking and fooling around a psycho shows up and starts killing the popular kids in various grizzly ways. The only two not losing it as the body count starts being the level headed Mandy and Gil the ranch hand, a man of such ability and common sense that I thought he&#8217;d be banned from teen slasher flicks just on the basis of  such people just don&#8217;t exist in that world.In the end, for all the hype of the lost amber film, this is just a teen slasher flick. Amber&#8217;s acting is very good and the cinematography is great but there&#8217;s no great work here. If you like teen slasher films, you&#8217;ll like this.

Id give another star for the atmosphere at the end the the movie, but that would be misleading you to watch this.  I feel like there were two directors here...the one filming the very beginning and very end, and then a big fat fool directing the belly of it. Its so schizophrenic how the cinematogrophy is so beautiful (think, Haute Tension) but the script and editing felt like they were done by a 12 year old (think OC on a bad day...wait they're all bad...nevermind) Despite what other reviewers on here say, this had a lot of potential for being good...predictable, but good.Mandy Lane is this beautiful, virginal highschool girl all the guys want to bone. Ok...I get that. The characters are attracted to her. But what I dont get, is why they bother. Her character is essentially a mute. She has very little dialogue, very few people skills, and isnt very likeable, or unlikable, which, kinda makes her tofu.Kinda like bringing that crash test dummy BUSTER from Mythbusters...just throw him in the lake and watch him bob round. Yes, thats what youre getting here. But yet, everyone invites her out, fawns over her, tries to hold her hand, swim with her, kiss her, bone her. Beauty only goes so far, then your basically just handjobbing yourself.Needless to say, none of the MANDYFANS in the movie get anywhere with her (no sex, sorry), not much of anything really, till the end. Mandy is kinda crazy, but at least, gains a personality....which brings me to the langorous stilted script.  How many times have you seen a movie where teenagers looking to drink and have sex travel to an out of the way cabin, only to have the power go out and someone pick them off one by one? Like a million? Done, done, and done.Watch the trailer, basically it gives you all you need to see plus the great music.

Mandy lame who has the body of Olive Oyl and the personality of chopped wood has all the boys attention for whatever reason. They all desire her and lust after her to the point it's almost an obsession but Mandy lame has no desire for any of them she's not like the other girls...because she's a lesbian. Or so that would have made a better plot. This movie is not only a waste of time but it's a boring waste of time. The movie is basically about a bunch of potential teen rapist that chase after a socially awkward girl named Mandy Lane obsessively. I thought this movie was a joke or parody at first of how women think every man wants them when they look average but it wasn't. This is a movie that takes itself seriously.Mandy lane for whatever reason goes on a getaway with a group of people she doesn't even like and has nothing in common with. Naturally on the trip she doesn't hardly socialize and usually spends her time sitting there being monotone while the boys obsess over her and each try to see if they can claim her for themselves. But.. duh duh duh! Plot twist Mandy Lane is attracted to a much older more experienced man who happens to be a farm hand. You know like younger girls are attracted to older guys in real life. What a mind blower that was to see that happen. During Mandy's stay while she's being socially awkward the group of kids she's with start getting picked off one by one but who is doing it? Duh Duh Duh! her friend who also obsesses over her (don't worry that's no real spoiler you already know it's him). One after one they start getting killed off while you asks yourself &#34;what is the point of this&#34; when at the end of the movie you get a Surprise! There is no point! Killing off a bunch of popular kids that never really did anything to them and even invited them to hang out with them. Let's kill them off for no real reason.It turns out that Mandy Lane has been in on the murder spree in some kind of unexplained reason about a suicide pact she made with her friend/stalker. Why? Who knows that's also never explained. It turns out Mandy was just using her friend to kill off the group of popular kids for no real reason at all. One character said it best &#34;Why are you here?&#34; and really why was she there with them if she didn't want to socialize with them? At the end of the day this is yet another poorly done horror movie. It's almost like it has no plot or story line (which it doesn't). They made a slasher movie with no point too it. Why? Indeed. What is Mandy seeking pleasure by killing her schoolmates that all look up to her? Why? and for what? Why...

Given the title and the vague images I saw (which were just shots of Mandy&#8217;s face), I didn&#8217;t have much to go on; the film had only an overseas presence but not much of one here in the U.S.  So when I heard Anchor Bay was releasing it after seven long years of waiting, I jumped on the chance to watch it.  And wow...was I wrong about the premise!  I wasn&#8217;t even close.  This is a slasher flick true-and-through, and although my initial perceptions were wrong, this is a great movie and worth checking out!I could tell after the first 10 minutes that I was going to like this film.  It&#8217;s darkly comedic in some aspects, however I don&#8217;t think that was director Jonathan Levine&#8217;s intention.  Still, it&#8217;s hard not to find humor when you have a motley crew of characters like in this film.ALL THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE is shot well and looks good from a production standpoint.  The acting is sharp with Amber Heard portraying the titular character.  I&#8217;ve enjoyed her work for several years, and I hope to see her career continue to flourish.  I also like seeing Anson Mount onscreen as well; my wife and I watch HELL ON WHEELS every now and then, so he&#8217;s always a pleasure to see in a show.The special effects in the film are also good.  There&#8217;s some nice bloodshed, and gore-hounds will like several scenes in this film.  My particular favorite occurs when the killer shoves a shotgun barrel into a girl&#8217;s mouth and then rams it forward; the resulting jaw-break is pretty impressive and it even made me cringe a bit!Although ALL THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE is entertaining and well made, it does have its flaws.  For one, there&#8217;s no real resolution.  **SPOILER ALERT**  We get to see Mandy and Emmett meet up, but then they start discussing the suicide plan, and she refuses to follow through with it.  I never understood why she would do the killings to begin with, let alone why she would off herself afterwards.But the movie itself is definitely a watcher, and I suppose you could make your own decision about why the events happened like they did.  I am recommending this one, and I suggest you check out director Levine&#8217;s blockbuster hit WARM BODIES after you watch this one.  It&#8217;s interesting to see how he has grown as a director since this 2006 film.ALL THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE hits stores today.",4,A nice slasher flick that delivers,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,2479,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'was', 'rape-revenge', 'flick', 'Given', 'title', 'vague', 'images', 'saw', 'were', 'just', 'shots', 'Mandy', '8217', 's', 'face', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'much', 'go', 'film', 'had', 'only', 'overseas', 'presence', 'not', 'much', 'one', 'here', 'U.S', 'when', 'heard', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'was', 'releasing', 'seven', 'long', 'years', 'waiting', 'jumped', 'chance', 'watch', 'wow', 'was', 'wrong', 'premise', 'wasn', '8217', 'even', 'close', 'slasher', 'flick', 'true-and-through', 'initial', 'perceptions', 'were', 'wrong', 'great', 'movie', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'could', 'tell', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'film', '8217', 'darkly', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'however', 'don', '8217', 'think', 'was', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Levine', '8217', 's', 'intention', 'Still', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'not', 'find', 'humor', 'when', 'have', 'motley', 'crew', 'characters', 'film.ALL', 'THE', 'BOYS', 'LOVE', 'MANDY', 'LANE', 'shot', 'well', 'good', 'production', 'standpoint', 'acting', 'sharp', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'portraying', 'titular', 'character', '8217', 'enjoyed', 'work', 'several', 'years', 'hope', 'see', 'career', 'continue', 'flourish', 'also', 'seeing', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'onscreen', 'as', 'well', 'wife', 'watch', 'HELL', 'ON', 'WHEELS', 'now', 'then', '8217', 'always', 'pleasure', 'see', 'show.The', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'good', '8217', 'nice', 'bloodshed', 'gore-hounds', 'will', 'like', 'several', 'scenes', 'film', 'particular', 'favorite', 'occurs', 'when', 'killer', 'shotgun', 'barrel', 'girl', '8217', 'mouth', 'then', 'rams', 'forward', 'resulting', 'jaw-break', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'even', 'made', 'cringe', 'bit', 'THE', 'BOYS', 'LOVE', 'MANDY', 'LANE', 'entertaining', 'well', 'made', 'have', 'flaws', 'one', '8217', 'real', 'resolution', '**SPOILER', 'ALERT**', 'get', 'see', 'Mandy', 'Emmett', 'meet', 'up', 'then', 'start', 'discussing', 'suicide', 'plan', 'follow', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'would', 'do', 'killings', 'begin', 'let', 'alone', 'why', 'would', 'off', 'movie', 'definitely', 'watcher', 'suppose', 'could', 'make', 'own', 'decision', 'why', 'events', 'happened', 'did', 'am', 'recommending', 'one', 'suggest', 'check', 'out', 'director', 'Levine', '8217', 'blockbuster', 'hit', 'WARM', 'BODIES', 'watch', 'one', '8217', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'grown', 'director', '2006', 'film.ALL', 'THE', 'BOYS', 'LOVE', 'MANDY', 'LANE', 'stores', 'today']",N/A

If you read the synapsis on Amazon or DVD descriptions, it makes the movie look intriguing and seems to distinguish it from the rest of the body count movies both past and present.  But.  That is not so.  Mandy Lane begins somewhat interestingly with the pool scene, and for a moment, it looks like things might be going into Heathers territory, but after the next 10 minutes, you pretty much know how the movie is headed.  On the plus side, the location, a Texas ranch, is gorgeous, and the cinematography evokes a very 70s feel-but then, that might also be due to the annoying hairdo one of the characters is sporting.  Typical of your body-count movie, most of the characters in this paint-by-numbers venture are deliberately chiseled into Grade A a**holes, so that the viewer will not become attached to them when they are dispatched, and so that some kind of empathy can be created that will gel into full-blown sympathy by the time of the Reveal.  If the film is resolved, it is only on the shallowest, most explicit sense; by the time the last 10 minutes kick in, it makes only the kind of sense that Lewis Carroll might have appreciated were he to have penned this script. No hint is given to motivations or rationale behind why a bloodbath had to be had, other than the obvious one of it seemed like the right thing to do at the time, which I suppose is as good a reason to see this movie as any, if you have nothing better to be doing at that particular present moment.",2,Sealed with another body-count movie...,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,1579,"['high', 'low', 'fast', 'slow', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'as', 'pedestrian', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'get', 'read', 'synapsis', 'Amazon', 'DVD', 'descriptions', 'movie', 'look', 'intriguing', 'distinguish', 'rest', 'body', 'count', 'movies', 'past', 'present', 'not', 'so', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'somewhat', 'interestingly', 'pool', 'scene', 'moment', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'going', 'Heathers', 'territory', 'next', '10', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'headed', 'plus', 'side', 'location', 'Texas', 'ranch', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'very', '70s', 'feel-but', 'then', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'due', 'annoying', 'hairdo', 'one', 'characters', 'sporting', 'Typical', 'body-count', 'movie', 'most', 'characters', 'paint-by-numbers', 'venture', 'are', 'deliberately', 'chiseled', 'Grade', 'A', 'a**holes', 'viewer', 'will', 'not', 'become', 'attached', 'when', 'are', 'dispatched', 'so', 'kind', 'empathy', 'can', 'be', 'created', 'will', 'gel', 'full-blown', 'sympathy', 'time', 'Reveal', 'film', 'resolved', 'only', 'shallowest', 'most', 'explicit', 'sense', 'time', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'kick', 'only', 'kind', 'sense', 'Lewis', 'Carroll', 'might', 'have', 'appreciated', 'were', 'have', 'penned', 'script', 'hint', 'given', 'motivations', 'rationale', 'why', 'bloodbath', 'had', 'be', 'had', 'other', 'obvious', 'one', 'seemed', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'time', 'suppose', 'as', 'good', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'be', 'doing', 'particular', 'present', 'moment']",N/A

But I'd heard good things about ""All the Boys Love Mandy Lane,"" and I will say, it was better than expected.  The story concerns the hot blond (presumably having just blossomed into such) who becomes the object of desire for clueless high school jocks and hangers-on she finds equally compelling and repellent.  What happens next would be pretty standard slasher fare, except for the subtext of crass sexuality as unchecked power.  Yes, I know that's a ho-hum subject done to death, but I'm not sure I've seen as honest a depiction of such for the teen set since, well, the original ""Carrie.""  Their empty lives of hedonism mask an undercurrent of cruelty and aggression that will define their short lives (and their lost future as nihilistic adult boors trapped in this pattern - a thematic point that resonates throughout). There are also threads of racism, alienation, deception, chauvinism (for both men and women), and objectification, played out well by a competent cast of unknowns.  In this, ""All the Boys Love Mandy Lane"" transcends the genre, taking familiar tropes but turning them sideways.  In fact, my biggest beef is that it didn't have to be a slasher movie at all and that the set up could easily have been done as a straight drama along the lines of ""Last Summer"" rather than a horror movie.  While the low budget is offset by a decent soundtrack and some occasionally inventive camerawork, the real interest in the film is created by the ideas, and this is the closest thing to a ""thinking person's slasher movie"" that I've seen, less about the showy killing and more about the reasons for it.

She is invited to a party and she only goes on the condition that her best friend Emmett can come too. They go to the party and Mandy is predictably hit on a lot. Emmett comes to her rescue, but causes the guy's death by suggesting he jump off the roof to impress her. Fast forward nine months. Mandy has gotten more popular and separated herself from Emmett. The cool crowd invites her to a party on a ranch to drink and do other typical delinquent teen activities. Everything is fun and games until one by one, the teens disappear.Mandy Lane is the all American girl: gorgeous, virginal, aloof, and extremely bland. For the life of me, I have no idea why boys won't leave her alone except that she's pretty and she doesn't want them. Despite being as exciting as linoleum tile, the cool people at her school include her in their party, while she looks at them condescendingly, doesn't really interact with any of them in any way, and looks bored. I swear Amber Heard went to the Kristen Stewart school of acting, where hair flipping and empty gazes are all that are needed. I was hoping that by the end, Mandy would have some sort of personality, but she really doesn't. The ending's surprise twist is that Mandy was complicit in all the murders that Emmett committed. Instead of killing herself with Emmett like they planned, she kills Emmett, leaving herself free to blame all the murders on him and continue her life. She proves to be an incredibly bland and manipulative person that relies on her looks and doesn't have any real relationship with anyone. The other women in the film are just as vapid and annoying as Mandy, except they also put each other down, have no self respect, and give sexual favors to the men who treat them badly.The guys in this film are unbelievable. The majority of them believe that girls are commodities to be owned and conquered. Mandy is unwillingly groped, kissed, and touched by many of these boys because they think it's their right to do so. Even her own boyfriend acts like anyone can just come along and take her. They all prove to be flat stock characters that are incredibly annoying and misogynistic. The only likable guy in the film is Emmett, the murderer. He doesn't buy into their views on anything and treats Mandy like a person (even though he is just as infatuated with her as everyone else). It's pretty sad when the best person in the film kills just about everyone in it. I hated just about all the guys in the film because of their frat boy, misogynistic tendencies.All the Boys Love Mandy Lane is a stereotypical, formulaic slasher film with misogynistic male characters and bland, vapid female characters. The film was fairly frustrating to get through and became quite boring after a while. I liked the songs used in the background, but other than that, it's mediocre at best.

1148765,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001563HYO,trebe,"[1, 1]","All The Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006) is a slasher flick with a huge perverted twist, which makes it hard to say too much about the film without spoiling it.  Although it was released nearly six years ago, more have not seen the film because its release on DVD in North America (Region 1) has been in limbo because the distribution rights were acquired by a company that subsequently went bankrupt.  The movie is available on Region 2 Bluray, which is playable on most Region 1 Bluray players.Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) is dazzlingly beautiful blonde attending high school somewhere in Texas.  While at a party, her friend Emmet (Michael Welch) encourages the host of the party to dive into the pool from the roof of the house.  This attempt to impress Mandy ends in disaster, when the boy has an accident and dies.  Moving forward nine months, Mandy apparently isn't speaking to Emmet, and accepts an invitation from her classmate Red (Aaron Himelstein) , to party at a ranch owner by his father.  Also attending are Jake (Luke Grimes), his girlfriend Marlin (Melissa Price), Chloe (Whitney Able), and Bird (Edwin Hodge).The only adult present is Garth (Anson Mount), a ranch hand, who besides killing snakes and seeing that nothing major happens, has little interest in becoming involved with what Red has planned, declining Mandy's invitation to join the party.  The group of friends doesn't seem to be very close, and feelings are easily hurt, as Jake gets upset and storms off, Chloe antagonizes Marlin, Red pulls a cheap trick on Bird, and Mandy fends off Red's advances.  Some spoilers follow.The violence begins about 35 minutes in, when after a romantic encounter in a barn with Jake, Marlin is attacked and rendered unconscious.  When Jake finds her later sitting by a pond, a hooded figure arrives and blasts him with a shotgun, and then finishes off Marlin with a blow to the head.  The killer is revealed to be Emmet, as the outcast is apparently bent on revenge.  This revelation comes at the midway point, and as you might expect, there are further surprises to come, as those back in the ranch house eventually realize that they are in danger.  Garth is forced to become involved, and quickly gets in the way of a bullet.  Two of the teens leave the house to try and get help, but run into Emmet.  Before things are over, Mandy will utilize her skills as a runner, and battle for her life in a muddy pit.After a slow start, Mandy Lane does finish strongly.  The reasons behind the events aren't completely clarified, which may leave you wondering if you missed something.  This is a film however, where overthinkingprobably isn't going to help much, as the lack of clarity was probably intended to give the ending more impact, and generate discussion.  With revenge supposedly the motivating factor, the movie appears to be quite mean spirited, with very little real justification for the treachery and violence.If you have a Jason Voorhees type killer, justification for his actions may not be a major factor, but here, the ambiguity detracts from what could have been a much stronger film.  With the exception of developing the relationship between Mandy and Garth, much of the substantial time spent on character development fails to yield major dividends. Little is revealed about Emmet, who is apparently is just a sick, selfish jerk, and Mandy is too deep to fathom.All The Boys Love Mandy Lane does provide a few thrills, and features some decent acting, but there are some issues with the story, and the twist won't appeal to everyone.  Slightly better than average, the film rates 3.5 stars.  Amber Heard's unforced and natural performance is rather refreshing, and she has since gone on to do such diverse films as Zombieland (2009), The Ward (2010), and Drive Angry (2011).  Anson Mount (Hell On Wheels, In Her Shoes) gives a confident performance, while Michael Welch has found success as part of the Twilight franchise.Regarding the Region 2 Bluray of Mandy Lane, most Region 1 Bluray players will play the main feature, however they may not play the extras, which consists of the trailer, and an interview with Amber Heard.",4,"even bloody and muddy, the mysterious Mandy Lane remains the object of desire...",1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,4149,"['Boys', 'Love', 'Mandy', 'Lane', '2006', 'slasher', 'flick', 'huge', 'perverted', 'twist', 'hard', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'spoiling', 'was', 'released', 'nearly', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'more', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'release', 'DVD', 'North', 'America', 'Region', '1', 'been', 'limbo', 'distribution', 'rights', 'were', 'acquired', 'company', 'subsequently', 'went', 'bankrupt', 'movie', 'available', 'Region', '2', 'Bluray', 'playable', 'most', 'Region', '1', 'Bluray', 'players.Mandy', 'Lane', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'dazzlingly', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'attending', 'high', 'school', 'somewhere', 'Texas', 'party', 'friend', 'Emmet', 'Michael', 'Welch', 'host', 'party', 'dive', 'pool', 'roof', 'house', 'attempt', 'impress', 'Mandy', 'disaster', 'when', 'boy', 'accident', 'dies', 'Moving', 'forward', 'nine', 'months', 'Mandy', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'speaking', 'Emmet', 'invitation', 'classmate', 'Red', 'Aaron', 'Himelstein', 'party', 'ranch', 'owner', 'father', 'Also', 'attending', 'are', 'Jake', 'Luke', 'Grimes', 'girlfriend', 'Marlin', 'Melissa', 'Price', 'Chloe', 'Whitney', 'Able', 'Bird', 'Edwin', 'Hodge', 'only', 'adult', 'present', 'Garth', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'ranch', 'hand', 'who', 'killing', 'snakes', 'seeing', 'nothing', 'major', 'happens', 'little', 'interest', 'becoming', 'involved', 'what', 'Red', 'planned', 'declining', 'Mandy', 'invitation', 'join', 'party', 'group', 'friends', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'close', 'feelings', 'are', 'easily', 'hurt', 'Jake', 'upset', 'storms', 'off', 'Chloe', 'Marlin', 'Red', 'cheap', 'trick', 'Bird', 'Mandy', 'Red', 'advances', 'spoilers', 'follow.The', 'violence', '35', 'minutes', 'when', 'romantic', 'encounter', 'barn', 'Jake', 'Marlin', 'attacked', 'rendered', 'unconscious', 'When', 'Jake', 'later', 'sitting', 'pond', 'hooded', 'figure', 'arrives', 'shotgun', 'then', 'finishes', 'Marlin', 'blow', 'head', 'killer', 'revealed', 'be', 'Emmet', 'outcast', 'apparently', 'bent', 'revenge', 'revelation', 'midway', 'point', 'might', 'expect', 'are', 'further', 'surprises', 'come', 'back', 'ranch', 'house', 'eventually', 'realize', 'are', 'danger', 'Garth', 'forced', 'become', 'involved', 'quickly', 'way', 'bullet', 'Two', 'teens', 'leave', 'house', 'try', 'get', 'help', 'run', 'Emmet', 'things', 'are', 'Mandy', 'will', 'utilize', 'skills', 'runner', 'battle', 'life', 'muddy', 'pit.After', 'slow', 'start', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'finish', 'strongly', 'reasons', 'events', 'are', ""n't"", 'completely', 'clarified', 'may', 'leave', 'wondering', 'missed', 'something', 'film', 'however', 'where', 'overthinkingprobably', ""n't"", 'going', 'help', 'much', 'lack', 'clarity', 'was', 'probably', 'intended', 'give', 'ending', 'more', 'impact', 'generate', 'discussion', 'revenge', 'supposedly', 'motivating', 'factor', 'movie', 'be', 'quite', 'mean', 'spirited', 'very', 'little', 'real', 'justification', 'treachery', 'violence.If', 'have', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'type', 'killer', 'justification', 'actions', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'major', 'factor', 'here', 'ambiguity', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'stronger', 'film', 'exception', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Mandy', 'Garth', 'much', 'substantial', 'time', 'spent', 'character', 'development', 'yield', 'major', 'dividends', 'Little', 'revealed', 'Emmet', 'who', 'apparently', 'just', 'sick', 'selfish', 'jerk', 'Mandy', 'too', 'deep', 'fathom.All', 'Boys', 'Love', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'provide', 'few', 'thrills', 'decent', 'acting', 'are', 'issues', 'story', 'twist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'Slightly', 'better', 'average', 'film', 'rates', '3.5', 'stars', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'unforced', 'natural', 'performance', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'gone', 'do', 'such', 'diverse', 'films', 'Zombieland', '2009', 'Ward', '2010', 'Drive', 'Angry', '2011', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'Hell', 'Wheels', 'Her', 'Shoes', 'confident', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Welch', 'found', 'success', 'part', 'Twilight', 'franchise.Regarding', 'Region', '2', 'Bluray', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'most', 'Region', '1', 'Bluray', 'players', 'will', 'play', 'main', 'feature', 'however', 'may', 'not', 'play', 'extras', 'trailer', 'interview', 'Amber', 'Heard']",N/A
1148766,AN7TIQWIXAQ79,B001563HYO,W. Goring,"[7, 10]","All The Boys Love Mandy Lane is a movie with a checkered past. As legend has it, Mandy Lane was picked up by the Weinsteins and thrown on a shelf to rot. Theories abound as to why, but the presumption was that a shotgun wielding teen killer was a little too Columbine for the Weinsteins to market, schedule and release. Aside from some festival screenings Mandy Lane has never seen the light of day in the US. Thankfully here in Australia, and in the UK, Mandy suddenly arrived out of nowhere on DVD to little fanfare. Shame, Shame. This film is a rare antidote to almost every teen horror, by essentially  not being a horror film at all. Maybe its an overstatement  to call Mandy a drama, but she's definitely a thriller and a genuine critique of the modern teen, prone to ugliness and violence wrapped in smooth skin, blonde hair and a tan. Often these teen horrors, of which there are SO many, purport to be 'saying something' about the teen culture exhibited but actually don't and instead use the hot bods to lure in a teen audience negating the chance to make them look at themselves and possibly even consider, hey maybe I deserve to be hatched up by a slasher. Again, this is what may have made the Weinsteins cautious of Mandy, teen retribution at the end of a shotgun - it is a terrifyingly REAL scenario. And here in lays a contradiction about Mandy Lane you can see the ending coming a mile off, however, instead of being disappointed, you so hope you are right. Amber Heard as Mandy does a good job with a difficult role, Mandy is not a cut and dry kinda  gal. The supporting players also keep it real, no over acting in the stoner scenes. You get a sense that these actors know what it's like, no 'Whoa man' moments. It's to the credit of director Jonathan Levine for keeping it real, he's not a horror director, going on to make The Wackness (2008) and it shows, all for the good of his film. One last positive is the film's use of music. No metal here, 60's teen idols instead, more evidence that Levine is blissfully unaware of teen horror trappings.",4,Lot's To Love About Mandy Lane,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,2067,"['Boys', 'Love', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'movie', 'checkered', 'past', 'legend', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'Weinsteins', 'thrown', 'shelf', 'rot', 'Theories', 'abound', 'why', 'presumption', 'was', 'shotgun', 'wielding', 'teen', 'killer', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'Columbine', 'Weinsteins', 'market', 'schedule', 'release', 'Aside', 'festival', 'screenings', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'never', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'US', 'Thankfully', 'here', 'Australia', 'UK', 'Mandy', 'suddenly', 'arrived', 'nowhere', 'DVD', 'little', 'fanfare', 'Shame', 'Shame', 'film', 'rare', 'antidote', 'almost', 'teen', 'horror', 'essentially', 'not', 'being', 'horror', 'film', 'Maybe', 'overstatement', 'call', 'Mandy', 'drama', 'definitely', 'thriller', 'genuine', 'critique', 'modern', 'teen', 'prone', 'ugliness', 'violence', 'wrapped', 'smooth', 'skin', 'blonde', 'hair', 'tan', 'teen', 'horrors', 'are', 'SO', 'many', 'purport', 'be', ""'saying"", 'something', 'teen', 'culture', 'exhibited', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'instead', 'use', 'hot', 'bods', 'lure', 'teen', 'audience', 'negating', 'chance', 'make', 'look', 'possibly', 'even', 'consider', 'hey', 'maybe', 'deserve', 'be', 'hatched', 'up', 'slasher', 'Again', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'Weinsteins', 'cautious', 'Mandy', 'teen', 'retribution', 'end', 'shotgun', 'terrifyingly', 'REAL', 'scenario', 'here', 'lays', 'contradiction', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'can', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'mile', 'off', 'however', 'instead', 'being', 'disappointed', 'so', 'hope', 'are', 'right', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'Mandy', 'good', 'job', 'difficult', 'role', 'Mandy', 'not', 'cut', 'dry', 'kinda', 'gal', 'supporting', 'players', 'also', 'keep', 'real', 'acting', 'stoner', 'scenes', 'get', 'sense', 'actors', 'know', 'what', ""'Whoa"", 'man', 'moments', 'credit', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Levine', 'keeping', 'real', 'not', 'horror', 'director', 'going', 'make', 'Wackness', '2008', 'good', 'film', 'One', 'last', 'positive', 'film', 'use', 'music', 'metal', 'here', '60', 'teen', 'idols', 'instead', 'more', 'evidence', 'Levine', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'teen', 'horror', 'trappings']",N/A

That's the case with this 2006 slasher starring Amber Heard before she was a ""name.""The basic premise is that the titular Mandy Lane (Heard) got so hot over the last summer that all the boys in her high school are now trying everything they can to bed her. And Heard is certainly striking enough to give that premise plenty of weight. But after a promising intro scene, this film suffers hugely from a lack of an engaging storyline or a set of characters to care about. Instead we're given a stereotypically sex- and booze-crazed group of disposable teens heading out to a remote Texas ranch for a weekend of debauchery and getting offed one by one. Until a last minute twist that's less surprising than it could have been (and pretty hard to buy), this is fairly standard slasher fare.",2,"Aside from Amber Heard, not too much to love",1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,1035,"['Contrary', 'beliefs', 'many', 'film', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'films', 'are', 'shelved', 'not', 'dark', 'intentions', 'production', 'companies', 'trying', 'hide', 'good', 'stuff', 'simply', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'case', '2006', 'slasher', 'starring', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'was', 'name', 'basic', 'premise', 'titular', 'Mandy', 'Lane', 'Heard', 'got', 'so', 'hot', 'last', 'summer', 'boys', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'now', 'trying', 'everything', 'can', 'bed', 'Heard', 'certainly', 'striking', 'enough', 'give', 'premise', 'plenty', 'weight', 'promising', 'intro', 'scene', 'film', 'suffers', 'hugely', 'lack', 'engaging', 'storyline', 'set', 'characters', 'care', 'about', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'given', 'stereotypically', 'sex-', 'booze-crazed', 'group', 'disposable', 'teens', 'heading', 'remote', 'Texas', 'ranch', 'weekend', 'debauchery', 'getting', 'one', 'one', 'last', 'minute', 'twist', 'less', 'surprising', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'hard', 'buy', 'fairly', 'standard', 'slasher', 'fare']",N/A
