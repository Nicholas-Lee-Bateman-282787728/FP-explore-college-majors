It's the kind of film that you think about for several days after you see it!  The beautiful scenery along the California coast was worth the price of the movie.  The love story was as intense as the action.  Brando was perfection!  We thought the Blu-Ray disc was fine and had no trouble with it.

I suppose its the best version of the ones I have seen but a long way from being acceptable viewing on today's Hi-def TVs.

555003,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,B00004WGAK,Andrew McCaffrey,"[2, 2]","The story behind ONE-EYED JACKS appears to have been almost as interesting as the plot which unfolds on the screen.  Rod ""The Twilight Zone"" Serling wrote a rejected treatment of the book this film was based on.  The original director attached to the project was none other than a young Stanley Kubrick.  Eventually, the star and director ended up being the same person -- Marlon Brando.  The film reunited him with co-star Karl Malden; the pair having had worked together before in the classic ON THE WATERFRONT.So dark is this story, that even Slim Pickens is playing a manipulative bum with few redeeming characteristics.  ONE-EYED JACKS is basically a story of betrayal -- a topic it explores right from the film's opening set piece.  Trapped, and with only one person able to escape, Karl Malden's character promises to seek help quickly and return to save Marlon Brando from the law.  Instead he takes their stolen loot and makes a run for it.Brando spends the next five years in prison because of this and most of that time he broods over his betrayal at the hands of a man he nicknamed ""Dad"".  No doubt the fact that Brando himself manipulated the game of chance which sent Malden off as the one to find  help ate away at him.  Once escaping prison, he quickly meets up with another band of outlaws.  But their plans of more bank heists are secondary.  Brando is more interested in revenge.  He quickly catches up with Malden, but instead of exacting his vengeance quickly, he picks a more protracted method.  Favoring to pretend there are no hard feelings, he bides his time in order to heighten his former partner's suffering.It's almost wearying to watch this unfold.  Brando cheerfully proclaims that he bears no malice, but covertly plans his revenge.  Malden swears he trusts Brando, but has machinations of his own.  The audience must simply watch as these two men get deeper and deeper into their own games.What's delicious about this movie is that you can connect a line between every individual character and each person they encounter.  And almost every single one of those lines draws a deceitful relationship.  Brando deceives Malden, Malden's daughter and every woman he meets.  Malden lies to Brando and his own family.  Malden's daughter hides the truth from her father.  Slim Pickens tries double crossing everyone he meets.  It's dizzying to keep up with what the actual reality of the film is.As far as revenge films goes, this is good, but not great.  The vengeance is interesting to watch from the point of view of the audience, yet it's not quite as engaging as it could have been.  I felt simultaneously intrigued and removed from the action.Where the film does get a boost though is from the performances of the two stars.  This shouldn't be a surprise.  Even in places where the script drags, watching Malden and Brando as they plot and scheme with each other while also trying to figure out the other guy's motivation is always fun.The Digiview Productions edition of this film is presented in widescreen.  The picture and sound quality are more than adequate, although they could definitely benefit from some digital cleanup.If you like movies where the only characters with redeeming qualities are given less than half a dozen lines each, then ONE EYED JACKS should be right up your alley.  But you might want to draw a flow-chart while watching so that you can keep track of everyone's ulterior motives.",4,Vengeance Valley,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,3440,"['story', 'ONE-EYED', 'JACKS', 'have', 'been', 'almost', 'as', 'interesting', 'plot', 'screen', 'Rod', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Serling', 'wrote', 'rejected', 'treatment', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'original', 'director', 'attached', 'project', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'young', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Eventually', 'star', 'director', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'same', 'person', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'film', 'reunited', 'co-star', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'pair', 'having', 'had', 'worked', 'together', 'classic', 'ON', 'THE', 'WATERFRONT.So', 'dark', 'story', 'even', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'playing', 'manipulative', 'bum', 'few', 'redeeming', 'characteristics', 'ONE-EYED', 'JACKS', 'basically', 'story', 'betrayal', 'topic', 'right', 'film', 'opening', 'set', 'piece', 'Trapped', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'able', 'escape', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'character', 'seek', 'help', 'quickly', 'return', 'save', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'law', 'Instead', 'stolen', 'loot', 'run', 'it.Brando', 'next', 'five', 'years', 'prison', 'most', 'time', 'betrayal', 'hands', 'man', 'nicknamed', 'Dad', 'doubt', 'fact', 'Brando', 'manipulated', 'game', 'chance', 'sent', 'Malden', 'off', 'one', 'find', 'help', 'ate', 'away', 'Once', 'escaping', 'prison', 'quickly', 'up', 'band', 'outlaws', 'plans', 'more', 'bank', 'heists', 'are', 'secondary', 'Brando', 'more', 'interested', 'revenge', 'quickly', 'up', 'Malden', 'instead', 'exacting', 'vengeance', 'quickly', 'more', 'protracted', 'method', 'Favoring', 'pretend', 'are', 'hard', 'feelings', 'time', 'order', 'heighten', 'former', 'partner', 'suffering.It', 'almost', 'wearying', 'watch', 'unfold', 'Brando', 'cheerfully', 'malice', 'covertly', 'revenge', 'Malden', 'Brando', 'machinations', 'own', 'audience', 'must', 'simply', 'watch', 'two', 'men', 'get', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'own', 'games.What', 'delicious', 'movie', 'can', 'connect', 'line', 'individual', 'character', 'person', 'encounter', 'almost', 'single', 'one', 'lines', 'draws', 'deceitful', 'relationship', 'Brando', 'Malden', 'Malden', 'daughter', 'woman', 'Malden', 'Brando', 'own', 'family', 'Malden', 'daughter', 'truth', 'father', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'double', 'crossing', 'everyone', 'dizzying', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'actual', 'reality', 'film', 'is.As', 'far', 'revenge', 'films', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'vengeance', 'interesting', 'watch', 'point', 'view', 'audience', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'engaging', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'felt', 'simultaneously', 'intrigued', 'removed', 'action.Where', 'film', 'get', 'boost', 'though', 'performances', 'two', 'stars', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', 'Even', 'places', 'where', 'script', 'drags', 'watching', 'Malden', 'Brando', 'plot', 'scheme', 'other', 'also', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'other', 'guy', 'motivation', 'always', 'fun.The', 'Digiview', 'Productions', 'edition', 'film', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'more', 'adequate', 'could', 'definitely', 'benefit', 'digital', 'cleanup.If', 'movies', 'where', 'only', 'characters', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'are', 'given', 'less', 'dozen', 'lines', 'then', 'ONE', 'EYED', 'JACKS', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'might', 'want', 'draw', 'flow-chart', 'watching', 'so', 'can', 'keep', 'track', 'everyone', 'ulterior', 'motives']",N/A

Brando's girl (Pina Pellicer) is a stunning beauty and perfect for this film.

555005,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,B00004WGAK,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[3, 8]","This movie about a trio of Mexican banitos, was directed by Marlon Brando who also starred as Rio Boy.  Where's the Cisco Kid when you need him?  In 1962, Marlon was a balding, unattractive Indian giver (he took the ring back), certainly not a gentleman.  He was captured in a sandstorm by a group of Amigos.  After he escaped, he went to the Fiesta where he talked with his mouth full (no manners).The respected sheriff of the town had been his partner and taken off with two sacks of gold.  Now he is a corrupt politican married to a Mexican woman for respectabilty.  Louisa, the sheriff's step-daughter, is wooed and seduced by Rio and gets pregnant (a repeat of her heritage).  When he says how good that makes me feel, he doesn't look happy or glad.  He tells lies when dealing with women and men.  This time he buys a necklace for $30 and used it as he took advantage of Louisa.  He admits later that everything he told her was lies to get his way with her.  She became a disillusioned damaged goods which the old lecherous deputy tries to taunt and corrupt, but she has already been corrupted by Rio, the man she loves.When caught, Rio is bull whipped in public by the sheriff in an exhibition as he crippled Rio's gun hand.  At the thrashing incoming tide, he thinks of Louisa as his body heals, but his psyche doesn't.  He is out for revenge.  His ""best friend"" had left him to die (his sad tale) and he gives three reasons for why he wants to kill the man: five years of life lost, stolen money, and the beating.  ""Will killing him make you a man?""  Louisa reminds him that there are not many chances in life to be happy.  One has to forget and forgive.  He'd been hurt too much and can't forget.Love conquers all with Louisa on the white stallion as she goes  home to wait for his return.  He had a reason to do what he did, but it does not seem to matter now.  He was a hunted man and demented with the need for revenge.  Instead of hiding in Mexico, he rides off to Oregon.  One-eyed jack is one who pretends to be what he isn't.  He gets cornered and there is a shootout by the town fountain.  Vengeance is mine as the lovers ride away after the jail break.

555006,A2Z28WKY1LHBKY,B00004WGAK,"blockhed ""blockhed""","[5, 6]","Malden seems to start true, but then turns out to be living a lie. He gets his come-uppance in the end. Marlon tells one lie after another, but slowly appears to be reaching down to the deeper truth. He gets away with it in the end. The basic theme of this film seems to be the clash of the misfit with society --- perhaps this is the underlying theme of all films, since they are told from the point of view of the individual; and society is composed of nothing but a bunch of conformist misfits. If you want to succeed in society, you have to fake it --- cover up your miss-spent youth, or put it behind you,  don a front of respectability, hide your flaws. This is the way society operates, and two-faced old Dad has it figured out. Only show the acceptable side of your face, and you've got it made. One of the best things about this movie is that Brando managed to kick Kubrick the cube off the set. Many of Kubrick's films show the individual being flattened by society's values: and the individual is often shown as being demented or vicious beyond redemption in the first place. Instead of the heavy-handed Kubrick treatment, Brando gives us a sensitive, nuanced, moody, brooding, highly romantic, subtle and poetic story which perfectly fits the locale and the Mexican Western genre. Brando is great, as nearly always in his earlier work: 80% languor and 20% explosion. Malden, as always, is nothing less than 110% professional. To be beautiful, however, you have to suffer; and, boy, does Brando suffer. You have to ask yourself if he finished up working for the government in Oregon, leaving nothing but a little memento South of the Border. With five hours and a million feet of film in the can, you also have to ask yourself about possible alternative endings. For instance, did Malden get in a deadly shot from behind the fountain? Or did he shoot the girl in the back, and kill the baby, before the couple made their getaway? That would have been just too audience unfriendly in 1961.I've now read pretty well most of the internet reviews of this movie, and the only one which halfway recognizes its power is the London Time Out piece by TM. Check it out, and you begin to get some idea of why OEJ is a great work. Time will tell.

Well, surprise, surprise, when the DVD Copywright Warnings come on, they're in German!. Then the Main Menu comes on and you have to go to Set-UP and select English, or the default track you'll hear is in the German Language! Then the movie comes on and there's a scratch running down screen right during the Paramount Studio Logo and the VistaVision logo is completely missing! Then for the clincher: the Main Title Sequence and all Establishing Titles during the flik are in - French!The print itself is sharp, but that's about its only virtue. The color is quite pale and the dark scenes are milky. I had a one-dollar bargain DVD that I purchased at Wal-Mart 6 years ago that, though not anamorphic, was Widescreen Letterboxed, and it was a mouthwatering Technicolor print, probably struck from the Laserdisc version.

film seems a bit cut up,that's because Brando's director's cut as submitted to universal was 4hrs and 30 minutes long.Universal studio editors took Brand's film and cut it to peices.Even cut up and incomplete OEJ stands a Brando's expensive,slowly made,masterpiece,loved by avid western fans,hated by studio execs because of it's price tag,and because the visual perfection and awesome cast of the film,along with the the excellant script,cinematogrophy,and a underplayed but riveting performance by Brando.. resented  if not doomed by the boys in the front office,who considered it excessive and over the top for a first time director.Critics were viscious,attacking OEJ as a pretensious,flop.That was in 1960.Forget that Kubrick was originally hired to direct the film,as well as Elvis to play the Rio Kid.Kubrick dropped OEJ because of script issues,Elvis dropped OEJ because The Rio Kid was a little too provocative for him.Enter Brando..he was willing to direct and star in OEJ.The OEJ project geared up again,Brando brought in some of his buddies,Karl Malden,Slim Pickens,Ben Johnson,Wally Cox and Katy Jurado,to play the various characters found in the rather long story of revenge..next Brando built an exact replica of Monterey city circa 1880.The Monterey set was expensive to build.It set the stage for over-budget spending that plagued the project from day one.Then shooting began,it continued at a turtle's pace.Brando the perfectionist came out,he re-shot scenes up to 20 times,which drew heavily on the already strained budget.The movie industry waited with attentive curiosity.Brando completed the film in August 1959.He edited most of the film himself.The final director's cut was 4hr 23minutes long.Studio Execs called it too long and demanded it be cut to about 2 hours,Brando refused any further editing changes to OEJ saying it was perfect and any changes would change the continuity of the film.The final cut put OEJ at 2hr and 20 minutes.The story line was altered into fragments of the original.It's modified slow pace made the film seem long and often boring.OEJ was the biggest bomb of 1960.The cast,thinking they were working on a classic,were bitter toward the Universal execs who had Brando's Western edited with such relish,the film was at times not recognizable even to some members of the cast.Actually,OEJ is a great Western,one of the best ever made.How can this be,in 1960 it was a miserable failure?When the word got out that Brando was going to direct a western for universal studios,and it would have a great cast,large budget,and the best technical personnel in the business working behind the scenes,everyone.. execs,reporters,and the public in general awaited the release of OEJ to hopefully see the film and Brando fail.It was released and it failed many of the attacks on the film were based on jealousy for Brando.Brando was a revolutionary actor who redefined acting,in doing so,he had rocked lots of boats.OEJ was the visual proof of""what goes around comes around"".The critics of the day hated the film not because OEJ was a bad film so much as it was a chance to bash Brando.His talent urked the best of them.Roger Ebert called OEJ""certainly one of the best of the genre,with perghaps one of the best scripts ever in action cinema"".Even edited to death,Brando had made a great film.Today it stands as a film ahead of its time.""Every frame is created by a master director who learned much from the great directors of his day""OEJ has one of the best casts ever assembled in cinema.The cinematography is the

What more do ya want for so little? Some people are so fixated on the quality that they ruin the film for themslves.

Stop yer whinning and watch the !!#$$$% movie.AS FOR THE FILM:This is the the best western ever! Brando directs  and stars in this great film. Scorsese has stated that this is his favorite western. Terry Gilliam places this film in his 10 favorite films list. Marlon shot over a million feet of film!!!- a world record. He took over the directing position from Stanley Kubrick belive it or not. It is said they were not able to see things eye to eye. As much as I love Kubrick's work I don't think he could have done better.This film is so much more than a revenge/love story. Brando performance is outstanding. His complex charactor is as real as any performance on film. His wit, charm and rage are palpable. It deals with his inner turmoil as a man. Something that few films achieve or bother to deal with. The supporting actors are fantastic as well.Do yourself a favour and buy this today.

There are themes of friendship, betrayal, revenge, bigotry, lust, deceit, hypocrisy, redemption and love in this pedestrian-paced western. Marlon Brando is magnificent as Rio, the soft-spoken bank robber who is wronged by his friend, Dad Longworth (Karl Malden - in one of his best roles). After having been abandoned to the Mexican Rurales (led by Rudolfo Acosta) after a bank robbery in Sonora, Mexico and spending five years in a Mexican prison, Rio hunts down his former partner, Dad Longworth. In a turn of fortune, Longworth is now 'reformed' and the wealthy sheriff of a coastal town, Monterey, California.  Replete with a family, (Maria) a former widow (Katy Jurado)and Louisa, her grown daughter (Pina Pellicer), Rio pays a call on Dad Longworth. One follows is a bit melodramatic as a forbidden romance results between Louisa and Rio, a gunfight, betrayal by Rio's new gang  Ben Johnson and Sam Gilman), the loyal friendship of his former prison friend, Chico (played Larry Duran) and the final stand-off between Dad and Rio. The movie itself is characterized by scenes and situations which were taboo at the time: the lustful advances of a red-neck and abusive deputy (well-played by Ben Johnson), the brutal horse-whipping and hand-smashing by Dad, the abuse of a dancer by a drunkard, and the murder of Rio's unarmed friend.There is a genuine feel due to beautiful cinematography and solid appropriate dialogue. Brando's mumbling makes some lines hard to understand, especially in his romantic scenes. Brando does utter some great insults like &#34;scum-sucking pig&#34; and &#34;a big tub of guts&#34;.This western classic is slow-paced and 2 hours and 21 minutes long but it is worth the time.

555031,A3UGLMD1GKIZGR,B00004WGAK,"Jason Robey ""horakhti""","[19, 19]","If you like slow-burning westerns with phenomenal acting, this is one to see. Marlon Brando, who starred and directed, is magnificent as a brooding outlaw named Rio. After five years in a Mexican prison, Rio is on the prowl for his former partner, Dad Longworth, who betrayed him after a bank holdup. He discovers that Longworth has become a wealthy sheriff in a small coastal town. Rio makes his presence known, biding his time and allowing his former buddy to believe that the past is forgotten. But he runs into some trouble while in town. Longworth takes the opportunity to smash Rio's gun hand in a public display, then has him thrown in prison to be hanged. We're left wondering how Rio will ever get his revenge.Martin Scorcese has described this as his favorite western. Rod Serling (&quot;Twilight Zone&quot;) worked on the first draft of the script, then Sam Peckinpah (&quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;) was hired to rewrite it. Stanley Kubrick was the director, but was later replaced by star Marlon Brando. This is Brando's first and only stint as a director, and though it isn't perfect, it's darn good. He does tend to let scenes drag on a little long, and there were some tedious parts that probably should have been left out, but I'd say about 75-80 percent of this film hits the mark.As an actor, Brando dominates virtually every scene, drawing you in, making you feel what he's feeling. His character is a real son-of-a-b*tch, a liar and a scoundrel, but you come to empathize and root for him by the end. Pina Pellicer, who plays Rio's love interest Louisa, is a very fine actress who holds her own opposite Brando. She looks like a Mexican Audrey Hepburn. There really were no weak actors. Karl Malden, who played Longworth, is appropriately two-faced, a real &quot;one-eyed jack&quot;.The dialogue is very authentic. I've seen westerns where they talk like modern day folks, but in &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; the dialect is pure 19th century outlaw. It's great to hear Brando call some guy a &quot;scum-sucking pig&quot; or a &quot;big tub of guts&quot;.I like westerns, and this is one of the best that I've seen. It's slow-paced, but it's so good that I didn't mind. It's very character-driven, which I like. It's great to see Brando in his prime. Released in 1961, this film had a significant influence on the revisionist westerns (Sergio Leone, etc.), which started around the mid-1960s.

555032,AQJDBWTIWQW08,B00004WGAK,JBGood,"[3, 5]","The Amazon editorial review stating ""Pain-staking re-mastering and re-colorized"" is a stretch. And I suppose they meant Painstakingly re-mastered and re-colorized. When I first viewed this BD I thought I was watching a colorized version of a 50's Audie Murphy western. The picture had exceptionally low color and contrast levels like I've never seen on a blu-ray. I tweeked my Panasonic 50-inch Plasma TV picture settings, +30 for added contrast, Color +8, Tint -8 (toward red), Brightness -2, and Sharpness +17. You can also select Vivid if that's available on your TV.With the picture adjustments made, no DVD can compare with the OEJ blu-ray. You will be disappointed initially on seeing the shivering credits roll past a gray brick wall along with some artifacts. Minutes later, in the first bank robbery scene, Brando is sitting atop the bank counter - in pathetic VHS quality. Somehow these opening frames were not upgraded. From then on, the picture is improved as can be seen from the details in  the clothing, horses, and saddles. It's not perfect but is probably close to 1080p in resolution.Throughout the film there's a slight, grainy quality to the picture especially in some of the low light scenes. Also I found a voice sync problem noticeable in the beach scenes with Rio and Louisa. They could have done a much better job with this blu-ray but for 13 bucks, I'll keep it.What makes this western so good is the emotional intensity of Brando, whether humorously conning a woman, ""My mother gave me this before she died"", or in a vicious fit of anger ""Get up, you scum sucking pig. I'm gonna open you up."" Karl Malden as the treacherous Dad Longworth and Ben Johnson as outlaw Bob Amory provide strong supporting performances as do the rest of the cast.Odd things about this BD: The opening copyright details are in German. The credit titles are in French. You can select German or English for the audio but after the movie plays, I had to restart the disc to change the language. The trailer appears to be a combination of stop-action scenes from the movie and part of the original trailer. No special features.

I remember when it first came out in the early sixties, it received much negative publicity. I can see now that a lot of that came from studio heads who hated Brando and the  critics fell in line. It's a revenge flick with Brando playing the outlaw Rio who falls out with his outlaw friend Dad Longworth played with supreme villainy by Karl Malden. Along the road to revenge Rio picks up a few more bad characters including Ben Johnson who seemed to appear in most of the great westerns of that era. Brando is far from a virtuous John Wayne-type hero, but his characterization of Rio and the other outstanding performances by the co-stars makes the film move at all times.

Cripe ""ScriptMaverick""","[1, 1]","In an era during which the western movie was simply tuckered-out - tired of endless TV series' that chanted the same worn diatribe - and audiences searched for and demanded something different - along came ""One-Eyed Jacks""...featuring one listless, troubled, mumbling loner - fretting, ruminating, and deliberating...see, you actually can describe him with something other than ""brooding""!  No one besides Marlon Brando, as Rio, could have portrayed this man of few words - with tender, endearing lines, like - ""You get up - you big tub o'guts!"", ""Get up, you scum-sucking pig!"", and - ""You gob of spit!""  Along with an equally colorful actor - Karl Malden, as the dispicable ""Dad"" Longworth, there is a relationship between these two men seared in the fires of deep, infesting hatred and forged in revenge.In a friendship marred by bitter betrayal and hyprocrisy, two former tequila-saturated, bank-robbing buddies finally separate when surrounded by Mexican troops.  But, when his mentor, Longworth, fails to come back to rescue him - having been dispatched to locate horses for their getaway and leaves him for capture and a long prison term, Rio just wants to settle the score.  He soon learns that his former buddy is now Sheriff ""Dad"" Longworth in Monterey, California - which just happens to be the location of the next bank that Rio and his new compadres are about to rob - the stage for sweet revenge.With the fragile and lovely Pina Pellicer as Rio's love interest, Louisa, the solid Katy Jurado as her mother, Mrs. Longworth, and great character actors like Ben Johnson, Sam Gilman, and Larry Duran as Rio's new bank-robbing friends - along with Slim Pickens as the reprehensible Deputy Lon Dedrick and including notable appearances by Elisha Cook, Jr., Ray Teal, and the amazing Timothy Carey - the supporting stock in this picture elevates it to cult classic status.  Now, add the haunting and memorable score by Hugo Friedhofer - and you have a truly wonderful motion picture that deserves the careful and diligent restorative techniques of a powerhouse like - say Criterion - to remaster it completely.Filmed chiefly against the backdrop of Monterey, California with its rockbound shores and crashing sea rollers - it was a refreshing change to see a location other than some wind-swept, border town surrounded by paper-mache saguaro cacti.  What makes this film different is the carefully designed, chess-like series of ploys as Rio and ""Dad"" Longworth position themselves for the inevitable showdown.  SPOILER ALERT:  And, when Longworth finally gets his, it is satisfying to say the least, but certainly short of the real ""Sonny Corleone""/""Clyde Barrow""-style, bullet-riddled dessert that he really deserves - even if he is carrying a nine-shooter revolver!",5,A Western with Counter-culture Appeal!,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,2775,"['era', 'western', 'movie', 'was', 'simply', 'tuckered-out', 'tired', 'endless', 'TV', 'series', 'chanted', 'same', 'worn', 'diatribe', 'audiences', 'searched', 'demanded', 'something', 'different', 'came', 'One-Eyed', 'Jacks', 'featuring', 'one', 'listless', 'troubled', 'mumbling', 'loner', 'fretting', 'ruminating', 'deliberating', 'see', 'actually', 'can', 'describe', 'something', 'other', 'brooding', 'one', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Rio', 'could', 'have', 'portrayed', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'tender', 'endearing', 'lines', 'get', 'up', 'big', 'tub', 'Get', 'up', 'scum-sucking', 'pig', 'gob', 'spit', 'equally', 'colorful', 'actor', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'dispicable', 'Dad', 'Longworth', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'seared', 'fires', 'deep', 'infesting', 'hatred', 'forged', 'revenge.In', 'friendship', 'marred', 'bitter', 'betrayal', 'hyprocrisy', 'two', 'former', 'tequila-saturated', 'bank-robbing', 'buddies', 'finally', 'separate', 'when', 'surrounded', 'Mexican', 'troops', 'when', 'mentor', 'Longworth', 'come', 'back', 'rescue', 'having', 'been', 'dispatched', 'locate', 'horses', 'getaway', 'capture', 'long', 'prison', 'term', 'Rio', 'just', 'settle', 'score', 'soon', 'former', 'buddy', 'now', 'Sheriff', 'Dad', 'Longworth', 'Monterey', 'California', 'just', 'be', 'location', 'next', 'bank', 'Rio', 'new', 'compadres', 'are', 'rob', 'stage', 'sweet', 'revenge.With', 'fragile', 'lovely', 'Pina', 'Pellicer', 'Rio', 'love', 'interest', 'Louisa', 'solid', 'Katy', 'Jurado', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Longworth', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Sam', 'Gilman', 'Larry', 'Duran', 'Rio', 'new', 'bank-robbing', 'friends', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'reprehensible', 'Deputy', 'Lon', 'Dedrick', 'including', 'notable', 'appearances', 'Elisha', 'Cook', 'Jr.', 'Ray', 'Teal', 'amazing', 'Timothy', 'Carey', 'supporting', 'stock', 'picture', 'cult', 'classic', 'status', 'Now', 'add', 'haunting', 'memorable', 'score', 'Hugo', 'Friedhofer', 'have', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'motion', 'picture', 'careful', 'diligent', 'restorative', 'techniques', 'powerhouse', 'say', 'Criterion', 'remaster', 'completely.Filmed', 'chiefly', 'backdrop', 'Monterey', 'California', 'rockbound', 'shores', 'crashing', 'sea', 'rollers', 'was', 'refreshing', 'change', 'see', 'location', 'other', 'wind-swept', 'border', 'town', 'surrounded', 'paper-mache', 'saguaro', 'cacti', 'What', 'film', 'different', 'carefully', 'designed', 'chess-like', 'series', 'ploys', 'Rio', 'Dad', 'Longworth', 'position', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'when', 'Longworth', 'finally', 'satisfying', 'say', 'least', 'certainly', 'short', 'real', 'Sonny', 'Corleone', '/', 'Clyde', 'Barrow', '-style', 'bullet-riddled', 'dessert', 'really', 'even', 'carrying', 'nine-shooter', 'revolver']",N/A

The Brentwood version was the best I owned picture wise on DVD. While not the best it was watchable compared to Digiview version I owned as well, which was pretty unwatchable. So after of all negative reviews I have read I was all set to send my Blu-Ray copy back that I had originally pre-ordered with excitement since I love this movie as much as you guys. I decided to look at the Blu-Ray myself just before sending it back. So here is my review of the One Eyed Jacks Blu-Ray and I will try to be objective and fair. First, I put the Blu-Ray in my Samsung player and I had the issues everyone else had trying to get past the copyright warning screen. Once I figured out that pressing the pop up menu button would bring up the main menu everything was ok. I had to change the language to English since the default was German, which was pretty easy to do. The opening credits were in German which might bother some, but it didn't really bother me.  Now the part everyone cares about the picture and audio quality. If you were comparing this to a transfer of The Searchers well of course The Searchers would win hands down in comparison. I used The Searchers as an example since both are Vista Vision prints. The Searchers has had major restoration work done so of course it's going to look better. However, compared to other versions of One Eyed Jacks I own on DVD this Blu-Ray is by far the best version available. It looks pretty decent on my Samsung 52in 120hz HDTV is it the version we all want? No, but it's by far the best version out there IMHO until Paramount or a major studio undertakes the needed restoration for this film. The colors could be better but a small color adjustment on my T.V. helped quite a bit. Overall, and like I said before I am fairly happy with this Blu-Ray of One Eyed Jacks and consider it a decent upgrade until a studio like Paramount spends the money to restore the original negative. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helps someone who is on the fence and not sure of which way to go.

It ran OK after that.I have two other non blu-ray versions of this film,including one advertised as the best transfer, and this one is the best in picture sharpness, though the color is a bit washed out and the soundtrack is mediocre. It is also full screen. The musical soundtrack of this movie is one of the best, most romantic of all westerns, and it's unfortunate the sound is not better.This is a great movie--one of Brando's many great roles. In his prime, and with all his girlfriends playing small parts (count them). He said the girls were the only thing he remembered about the movie. He and his leading lady, Pina Pellicer, have great chemistry, and their love scenes are very moving--complemented beautifully by Friedhofer's great music.Friedhofer, by the way, did the orchestrations for the music in ""Casablanca.""I think I reviewed this movie previously in one of the non blu-ray versions, so I won't repeat myself. I'm satisfied with this blu ray version because the picture is sharp and full screen. Both important because of the exquisite views and photography of the Monterrey coast. Seeing this film again, I was also struck by the superb acting performances of the supporting cast beyond Brando--Malden,Johnson, Pickens, Pellicer, Jurado et al. Perhaps influenced by Brando's directing. Malden, by the way, received star billing with his friend Brando in the screen credits--and deserved it.",3,"Better video quality, but not great",1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,1631,"['just', 'watched', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'received', 'Amazon', 'First', 'all', 'case', 'was', 'not', 'sealed', 'indicating', 'had', 'been', 'opened', 'return', 'Second', 'was', 'skipping', 'lot', 'took', 'out', 'cleaned', 'wet', 'tissue', 'ran', 'OK', 'that.I', 'have', 'two', 'other', 'non', 'blu-ray', 'versions', 'film', 'including', 'one', 'advertised', 'best', 'transfer', 'one', 'best', 'picture', 'sharpness', 'color', 'bit', 'washed', 'soundtrack', 'mediocre', 'also', 'full', 'screen', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'romantic', 'westerns', 'unfortunate', 'sound', 'not', 'better.This', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'Brando', 'many', 'great', 'roles', 'prime', 'girlfriends', 'playing', 'small', 'parts', 'count', 'said', 'girls', 'were', 'only', 'thing', 'remembered', 'movie', 'leading', 'lady', 'Pina', 'Pellicer', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'moving', 'complemented', 'beautifully', 'Friedhofer', 'great', 'music.Friedhofer', 'way', 'did', 'orchestrations', 'music', 'Casablanca', 'think', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'previously', 'one', 'non', 'blu-ray', 'versions', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', ""'m"", 'satisfied', 'blu', 'ray', 'version', 'picture', 'sharp', 'full', 'screen', 'important', 'exquisite', 'views', 'photography', 'Monterrey', 'coast', 'Seeing', 'film', 'again', 'was', 'also', 'struck', 'superb', 'acting', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Brando', 'Malden', 'Johnson', 'Pickens', 'Pellicer', 'Jurado', 'al', 'Perhaps', 'influenced', 'Brando', 'directing', 'Malden', 'way', 'received', 'star', 'billing', 'friend', 'Brando', 'screen', 'credits', 'deserved']",N/A
555064,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,B00004WGAK,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[5, 6]","'One-Eyed Jacks' might be considered the most self-consciously Western of the sixties, and possibly of all time... It contains undoubted visual attributes, gorgeous photographic sequences of an immense sandy desert, and panoramas of the spectacular California coast... Not often does one get to see the sea in a Western... Another of the film's great assets is its beautiful music...'One-Eyed Jacks' is slow, but very tough, realistic and softly romantic... The picture has excitement and violence...Brando summons all the reserve of anger, inner ambivalence, and emotional complexity in his nature... As a cowboy, he is tough, cunning, soft-spoken, sentimental, vicious, and occasionally masochistic... He plumbs dark reserves of desolation and revenge with an inner ferocity that had always been a part of him but had never before emerged full-force... As a director, he is meticulous, with a keen eye for spectacular outdoor cinematography, and an instinctive sense for the visual expression of inner conflicts...Karl Malden, whose surface friendliness and affability usually concealed either weakness or malice or both, is excellent as the ambitious, determined outlaw, and the volatile, treacherous, arrogant sheriff whose last poisonous spill: ""You'll get a fair trial, and then I'm gonna hang you, personally.''One-Eyed Jacks is largely a story of vengeance... The film begins with two American outlaws operating in Mexico... Rio (Brando), a happy-go-lucky man who considers himself a Don Juan, and Dad Longworth (Karl Malden), a crooked man looking for the opportunity to settle down...They raid banks with real ease and spend their leisure time drinking and courting women... Rio appears as a somewhat cultured bandit with a weakness for aristocratic young ladies... He gives one of them his most ""precious"" possession, his mother's ring...The Mexican police trail the pair and almost catch them at their lovemaking, but Rio and Dad fight their way out to the desert... The mounted police follow and the bandits are eventually trapped in the hills with one of their horses shot... Rio determines to stay... Dad promises to return with a fresh horse, but, tempted by two sacks of gold, he never come back...Rio is captured and spends five years of his life in a brutal Mexican prison, until he makes an escape, with the company of a friend called Modesto (Larry Duran).The embittered Rio is now a man bent on revenge... He learns in one Cantina that his ex-partner is the sheriff of a town called Monterey, and has taken himself a Mexican wife with a teen-age daughter... So he goes to visit him...A guilt-ridden Dad finds Rio pleasant and apparently willing to forget past differences... He presents his family, and invites Rio to stay for supper...Rio is in league with two bandits, Bob Amory (Ben Johnson) and Harvey Johnson (Sam Gilman), and they have come to Monterey to steal a bank... They grow impatient, but Rio assures them of his intention not only to rob the bank but to kill the sheriff as well...Obviously, Longworth is not completely convinced about his friend, and becomes uneasy when Rio and his step-daughter show a romantic interest in one another... He well remembers Rio's past amorous adventures and he has no wish for anything that will delay Rio in Monterey...The town engages in a fiesta, with the bank not planning to open for several days... While the respected sheriff joins the townspeople in their festivities, Rio seduces the tender Louisa...The next morning, in a saloon, Rio approaches a drunk mistreating one of the house girls and knocks the man down... The drunk reaches for a shotgun and tries to shoot Rio in the back... But Modesto (as Bronson in 'Jubal') helps save Rio from the blast... The resultant outbursts Longworth to put his grisly double-cross into effect...He takes Rio into the street and arrests him with the help of his deputies... He ties him to a horse rail, flogs him with a whip, smashes his right hand with a rifle butt, puts him on his horse and drives him out of town...Rio retreats to a small fishing village on the coast with his partners and nurses himself back to health... Louisa visits him at his place to tell him she is in love... Rio's eyes are full of hate against her step father... He is entirely blind in his determination for revenge... Louisa wants him to forget, to leave his dark past for a brighter future... She leaves without mentioning she is expecting a baby...For over a period of six weeks Rio practices with his gun in an intent to regain the use of his hand... Amory and Johnson grow impatient, and decide to make their own move... From here the action is carefully builds towards an explosion...A carefully chosen supporting cast augmented the proceedings in fine style:- Katy Jurado repeats her role of the loving and understanding mother...- Ben Johnson plays the unscrupulous cowardly thief who avoids Brando's fury...- The gentle Pina Pellicer does her earnest best to temper the intensities of her man...- Slim Pickens plays the revolting deputy intimidated by an empty Derringer..Brando's 'One-Eyed Jacks' comes on as taught and tight, acted with deep feeling and intense concentration... Brando and Malden play largely a stylistic battle...",4,"Very tough, realistic and softly romantic...",1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,5242,"[""'One-Eyed"", 'Jacks', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'most', 'self-consciously', 'Western', 'sixties', 'possibly', 'time', 'undoubted', 'visual', 'attributes', 'gorgeous', 'photographic', 'sequences', 'immense', 'sandy', 'desert', 'panoramas', 'spectacular', 'California', 'coast', 'Not', 'often', 'one', 'get', 'see', 'sea', 'Western', 'film', 'great', 'assets', 'beautiful', 'music', ""'One-Eyed"", 'Jacks', 'slow', 'very', 'tough', 'realistic', 'softly', 'romantic', 'picture', 'excitement', 'violence', 'Brando', 'summons', 'reserve', 'anger', 'inner', 'ambivalence', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'nature', 'cowboy', 'tough', 'cunning', 'soft-spoken', 'sentimental', 'vicious', 'occasionally', 'masochistic', 'dark', 'reserves', 'desolation', 'revenge', 'inner', 'ferocity', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'part', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'emerged', 'full-force', 'director', 'meticulous', 'keen', 'eye', 'spectacular', 'outdoor', 'cinematography', 'instinctive', 'sense', 'visual', 'expression', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'surface', 'friendliness', 'affability', 'usually', 'concealed', 'weakness', 'malice', 'excellent', 'ambitious', 'determined', 'outlaw', 'volatile', 'treacherous', 'arrogant', 'sheriff', 'last', 'poisonous', 'spill', ""'ll"", 'get', 'fair', 'trial', 'then', ""'m"", 'gon', 'hang', 'personally', ""''One-Eyed"", 'Jacks', 'largely', 'story', 'vengeance', 'film', 'two', 'American', 'outlaws', 'operating', 'Mexico', 'Rio', 'Brando', 'happy-go-lucky', 'man', 'who', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Dad', 'Longworth', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'crooked', 'man', 'looking', 'opportunity', 'settle', 'down', 'raid', 'banks', 'real', 'ease', 'spend', 'leisure', 'time', 'drinking', 'courting', 'women', 'Rio', 'somewhat', 'cultured', 'bandit', 'weakness', 'aristocratic', 'young', 'ladies', 'one', 'most', 'precious', 'possession', 'mother', 'ring', 'Mexican', 'police', 'trail', 'pair', 'almost', 'catch', 'lovemaking', 'Rio', 'Dad', 'fight', 'way', 'desert', 'mounted', 'police', 'follow', 'bandits', 'are', 'eventually', 'trapped', 'hills', 'one', 'horses', 'shot', 'Rio', 'stay', 'Dad', 'return', 'fresh', 'horse', 'tempted', 'two', 'sacks', 'gold', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'Rio', 'captured', 'five', 'years', 'life', 'brutal', 'Mexican', 'prison', 'escape', 'company', 'friend', 'called', 'Modesto', 'Larry', 'Duran', '.The', 'embittered', 'Rio', 'now', 'man', 'bent', 'revenge', 'one', 'Cantina', 'ex-partner', 'sheriff', 'town', 'called', 'Monterey', 'taken', 'Mexican', 'wife', 'teen-age', 'daughter', 'So', 'visit', 'guilt-ridden', 'Dad', 'Rio', 'pleasant', 'apparently', 'willing', 'forget', 'past', 'differences', 'family', 'Rio', 'stay', 'supper', 'Rio', 'league', 'two', 'bandits', 'Bob', 'Amory', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Harvey', 'Johnson', 'Sam', 'Gilman', 'have', 'come', 'Monterey', 'steal', 'bank', 'grow', 'impatient', 'Rio', 'intention', 'not', 'only', 'rob', 'bank', 'kill', 'sheriff', 'as', 'well', 'Obviously', 'Longworth', 'not', 'completely', 'convinced', 'friend', 'uneasy', 'when', 'Rio', 'step-daughter', 'show', 'romantic', 'interest', 'one', 'well', 'Rio', 'past', 'amorous', 'adventures', 'wish', 'anything', 'will', 'delay', 'Rio', 'Monterey', 'town', 'fiesta', 'bank', 'not', 'planning', 'open', 'several', 'days', 'respected', 'sheriff', 'townspeople', 'festivities', 'Rio', 'tender', 'Louisa', 'next', 'morning', 'saloon', 'Rio', 'drunk', 'mistreating', 'one', 'house', 'girls', 'man', 'down', 'drunk', 'shotgun', 'tries', 'shoot', 'Rio', 'back', 'Modesto', 'Bronson', ""'Jubal"", 'save', 'Rio', 'blast', 'resultant', 'outbursts', 'Longworth', 'put', 'grisly', 'double-cross', 'effect', 'Rio', 'street', 'help', 'deputies', 'horse', 'rail', 'flogs', 'whip', 'right', 'hand', 'rifle', 'butt', 'horse', 'town', 'Rio', 'small', 'fishing', 'village', 'coast', 'partners', 'back', 'health', 'Louisa', 'place', 'tell', 'love', 'Rio', 'eyes', 'are', 'full', 'hate', 'step', 'father', 'entirely', 'blind', 'determination', 'revenge', 'Louisa', 'forget', 'leave', 'dark', 'past', 'brighter', 'future', 'mentioning', 'expecting', 'baby', 'period', 'six', 'weeks', 'Rio', 'practices', 'gun', 'intent', 'regain', 'use', 'hand', 'Amory', 'Johnson', 'grow', 'impatient', 'decide', 'make', 'own', 'move', 'here', 'action', 'carefully', 'builds', 'towards', 'explosion', 'A', 'carefully', 'supporting', 'cast', 'augmented', 'proceedings', 'fine', 'style', 'Katy', 'Jurado', 'role', 'loving', 'understanding', 'mother', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'unscrupulous', 'cowardly', 'thief', 'who', 'Brando', 'fury', 'gentle', 'Pina', 'Pellicer', 'earnest', 'best', 'temper', 'intensities', 'man', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'revolting', 'deputy', 'intimidated', 'empty', 'Derringer..Brando', ""'One-Eyed"", 'Jacks', 'taught', 'tight', 'acted', 'deep', 'feeling', 'intense', 'concentration', 'Brando', 'Malden', 'play', 'largely', 'stylistic', 'battle']",N/A

I'm not sure it is in that category, but it's a very good western.Originally Rod Serling wrote a screen play, but he was replaced by Sam Peckinpah and Stanley Kubrick was hired to direct. Brando didn't like ever one of them; fired both and took over writing and directing himself. He delivered a ponderous 5 hour film to the studio and walked away. Probably Archie Marshek who edited this into the theatrical release of just over two hours should be given more credit. The other 3 hours of film were, it seems, destroyed at some point.I can't recommend this version if you happen to see it, although it seems to me it contains at least a few minutes of film I haven't seen on other versions.

It is worth the revisit.The story line, as in many before it, begins with the classic double-cross.  Partners in crime, an older outlaw, (Karl Maldin) and a younger one (Brando) rob what will be their last bank together and in the ensuing chase, are brought down on a hill when one of the horses is shot out from under them.  The posse swarming below, Brando stays to defend himself while Maldin takes the sound horse and makes good his escape, and the double-cross has begun handsomely.After Brando escapes from prison and aided by another escapee, he plots revenge and sets out to track Maldin down.  He doggedly searches the ""honkey tonks and bars"", finds word of Maldin and ultimately locates Maldin himself, resplendent in political security as a powerful figurehead in a magnificent little Coastal town, married to a fading Spanish beauty, Katy Jurado, and very successfully practicing a charade as a family man. He doesn't need to see his old abused partner hover on the horizon after all this time, but there he is and he needs to deal with him.  As they size each other up again, in magnificent hypocritical ""glad to see you"" jousting, they both start forming their opposing plans.Pina Pellicer turned in what I felt was an absolutely superb performance in her part as Karl Malden's untouched, honest and genteel step daughter - in fact, she developed her role far beyond what it actually was designed to do. This girl, while of no great beauty, had the potential to be a character actress extraordinaire, which unfortunately was never fulfilled in her own life. Katy Jurado, in the supporting role, is quiet in ""carefully cultivated elegance"" belying her past - as the still-beautiful, world wise and anxious mother of Pina, a mother who recognizes all the signs and symptoms as her daughter begins to fall for the handsome desperado she knows nothing about but suspects the worst - because she herself has been there twenty years before.The photography alone is worth watching the film.

555078,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00004WGAK,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Theatrical Release: March 30, 1961Director: Marlon BrandoRuntime: 2 hours and 21 minutesStars: Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Pina Pellicer, Katy Jurado, Slim Pickens, Ben Johnson, Sam Gilman and Larry DuranDVD INFO: Since ""One-Eyed Jacks"" is public domain it has been released by numerous dvd companies with varying levels of quality. One version I saw was so bad it was unwatchable, but I can highly recommend two: Digiviw (which is available for a buck at Wal-Mart) and Platinum Disc Corporation (or PDC Home Entertainment). Both of these versions are WIDESCREEN (despite the fact that the Digiview version erroneously says on the back cover that it's full frame) and the picture quality is very good. So don't let the fact that these versions are usually sold for a buck fool you; these are quality dvds worthy of your video library. Other reviewers here at Amazon testify that the Front Row version is very good as well.THE STORY: Dad Longworth (Malden) literally ""takes the money and runs"" as he leaves his young partner in crime, Kid Rio (Brando), behind to rot in a Mexican prison. Rio escapes 5 years later with only vengeance on his mind. He finds Dad in Monterey, California, now a respectable town Sheriff with a Mexican wife (Jurado) and step-daughter Louisa (Pina), living the American Dream on the beautiful Pacific coast. The situation is complicated by Rio's teaming up with two lowlife criminals whose only intent is to rob the Monterey bank, as well as Rio's romantic dallyings with Louisa.""One-Eyed Jacks"" was Brando's only stab at directing and his original cut of the film was twice as long (!). I would love to see this director's cut, which HAS been shown on TV, but this 141-minute cut is fine as is.Not only is ""One-Eyed Jacks"" one of the best Westerns of all time, it's also one of Brando's top films, along with ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1962), ""The Young Lions"" and the underrated ""The Missouri Breaks,"" not to mention ""Apocalypse Now.""What makes it so great? Numerous things. Brando is at his most captivating here, but the story is entrancing as well, even though it's much more of a slow drama than an action/adventure film. When it comes, however, the action is quick and realistic.There are numerous themes running through the long story. One of the major ones is the clash of the misfit with conventional society. Since society is composed of a bunch of conformist misfits, the misfit must learn to conform if s/he wants to fit in and succeed. In other words, if you want to 'make it' in conventional society it's necessary to hide your problematic past & flaws and put on a front of respectability. Dad Longworth has figured this out and he's not about to allow Rio to ruin it for him. (I'm not saying I completely agree with this as I don't believe in being fake, just that it's one of the major themes of the story).I would like to offer a word of defense for Dad Longworth here. Although it was wrong for him to take the money and leave Rio to be captured, one can't help but empathize with him and the reasons why he gave in to the temptation. If he went back for Rio there was a high risk of getting captured or killed. The safest and most promising route was the selfish route. The good thing is that Dad wisely took advantage of this opportunity and made a good life for himself in Monterey. He was obviously sick of his criminal lifestyle and wanted a real life, a real job and real family. He was getting on in years and knew that this may well be his final opportunity, so he took it.The problem is that one's past always has a way of haunting us, which is another theme of the film; hence, Rio walks back into Dad's life 5 years later and his American dream is seriously threatened. Notice Dad's rage when he whips/beats Rio to an inch of his life; he's doing everything in his power to kill the ugly phantoms of his past, which is why he tries to get Rio hung on false charges later in the story.Another theme is redemption and how love is tied to any such positive transformation. Both Dad and Rio are criminal scumbags, but both desire redemption and a better life. The love of Dad's wife and the Monterey general populace brings this out in Dad, whereas Louisa's love for Rio slowly changes him. Near the end we plainly see that Rio no longer wants to kill Dad, he doesn't even want to see him; all he wants is to run off with his lady love. If Rio remained the same person he was at the beginning of the story ""One-Eyed Jacks"" wouldn't be half the film it is.In addition, Dad's love for Katie, his Mexican wife, is what delivered Katie and Louisa ""from the beanfields,"" as Dad puts it.Love goes hand-in-hand with loyalty or faithfulness. We see this in Rio's likable Mexican sidekick, Chico (Larry Duran).One of the best qualities of ""Jacks"" is that it's refreshingly realistic. There's no goofiness, unbelievable one-liners, over-the-top action or excruciatingly dated aspects.Speaking of dated, although the opening credits sequence and score are dated and boring, the rest of the film isn't. So don't let this sequence cause you to tune out. The rest of the score (by Hugo Friedhofer) is great.""One-Eyed Jacks"" was the obvious precursor to the Spaghetti Western. For instance, the protagonist is a dyed-in-the-wool ""cool"" anti-hero (like, say, Eastwood or Bronson). The main difference between ""Jacks"" and most Spaghetti Westerns, however, is that ""Jacks"" has a truly worthwhile story wherein numerous gems of wisdom can be gleaned, which can't be said about films like ""The Good, the Boring and the Ugly"" (don't get me wrong, I love the music and style of that film, it's just that the plodding story and scumbag characters leave much to be desired); also the anti-hero in ""One-Eyed Jacks"" slowly transforms into a potentially positive member of society.The film's influence goes well beyond just the Spaghetti Westerns. Take, for instance, Brando's crucifixion-style beating and long restoration. The film ""Conan the Barbarian"" pretty much ripped-off this entire sequence; Arnold Schwarzenegger even admits to it.Pina Pellicer does an outstanding job as Rio's girlfriend Louisa (Dad's step-daughter). Although she's definitely good-looking she's too skinny for my personal tastes. Spiritually-speaking, however, she's incredible. Although she commits a foolish error by sleeping with Rio after the festival (she probably had too much to drink -- another error), on a whole she's the epitome of love, virtue and spirituality. Again, this love is the key factor in Rio's positive metamorphosis.Unfortunately Pina committed suicide three and a half years after ""Jacks"" was released. Thankfully we have this film to remember her beauty and virtue. She deserves to be honored.""Jacks"" was filmed entirely in California with all the coastal sequences photographed on the Monterey Pennisula, including Pebble Beach. This is one of the only Westerns where you'll see the Pacific Ocean, and it's truly glorious! Other locations include Big Sur and Death Valley.CONCLUSION: Don't miss out on ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" Brando's only directorial effort. It's truly one of the GREAT Westerns, as well as one of Brando's most captivating performances.Hopefully they'll release the 5-hour ""Director's cut"" one day.",5,One of the GREAT

The story is constantly progressing and 45 years after it was made it's still an amazing and interesting story.Marlon Brando (directing and starring) really nailed this one. His Kid Rio is brilliantly calm, with a dark side brewing just under the surface. Five years after being left to be caught by the Mexican law by his bank robber sidekick Dad Longfellow, Rio sets out to find Longfellow and exact his revenge.What starts out as a revenge film turns into so much more as the characters are developed and the plot thickens.

Also, Slim Pickens makes a great appearance as a deputy.The DVD quality isn't that great.
