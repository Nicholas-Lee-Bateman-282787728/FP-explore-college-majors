845443,A2VMT89TCSF105,B0002V7KV4,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[1, 1]","""Joseph Stalin: Red Terror"" is a documentary about the Soviet dictator first aired in 1996. It features interviews with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, future U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, author Robert Conquest, Stalin's interpreter Valentin Berezhkov and Stalin's grandson (!) Yevgeny Dzugashvili.Despite all these luminaries, I admit that I didn't like the documentary.Of course, it's difficult to make an ""objective"" assessment of a mass murderer like Joseph Stalin, but I nevertheless regard the analysis in this production as extremely shallow. For the umpteenth time, Stalin is portrayed as a paranoid power-hungry megalomaniac with a very long memory, as if this could explain his actions all by itself. Both the Great Purges, the elimination of the top military brass and the attempted purge of the ""Jewish doctors"" are given purely psychological explanations. Yet, the narrator is forced to concede that Stalin could learn from his mistakes, as when he delegated direct power of military operations during World War II to his generals, rather than directing the troops himself (which had been an unmitigated disaster). This shows that Stalin, of course, *wasn't* barking mad on a purely personal level. The Great Purges and other depredations may or may not have interacted with Stalin's personal demons, but at bottom, they were products of the logic of the system itself and can be given material explanations.The analysis of Stalin's rise to power during the 1920's is also shallow: Stalin's opponents fought among themselves and didn't understand that Uncle Joe was plucking them one by one. In reality, the factions in the Communist Party had strikingly different policies on a long range of issues. The conflicts between Bukharin, Trotsky and Stalin weren't simply personality clashes. Once again, real material interests were involved. Stalin most directly represented the interests of the bureaucratic apparatus. When the kulaks attempted to undermine Soviet power by withholding grain, the only way for the bureaucratic apparatus to survive was to exterminate the kulaks and forcibly collectivize all of the countryside. When Bukharin and his faction temporized, Stalin and his faction *had* to break with them. This also explains the seemingly curious fact that both Bukharin and most of the Trotskyist leaders surrendered to Stalin once the collectivization and industrialization was underway. They all belonged to the same bureaucratic apparatus, after all. However, in the documentary the whole thing is portrayed as a purely personal failure of Stalin's opponents: ""They fought among themselves"", ""They didn't know he was going to kill them"", etc. Ever the cynical pragmatist, I'm pretty sure Stalin himself didn't know in 1928 that he was going to kill his old comrades in 1936-38!On one point, ""Joseph Stalin: Red Terror"" distorts the truth. Unsurprisingly, the issue in question is the Hitler-Stalin pact, portrayed as ""the better bet"" than an alliance with the Western democracies, and partly as the result of Stalin's personal admiration of the F&uuml;hrer. In reality, Stalin's strategy was to ally with the West *against* Hitler. It was the Western policy of pro-Nazi appeasement that eventually forced Stalin to sign the greatest Machiavellian alliance of all times. Thus, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was the result of the West having rebuffed Stalin, presumably hoping that Hitler would only attack the Soviet Union. By signing the agreement, Stalin temporarily directed the brown tide in the other direction... The narrator says that Stalin ""wisely teamed up with the Allies"" after the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, as if this hadn't been his original plan. A better description would be that FDR and Churchill ""wisely teamed up with Stalin""...It seems Chamberlain and Daladier have been consigned to an Orwellian ""memory hole"" by certain people. How ironic.On one point, I unfortunately think that the producers are right. They imply at several points that Stalinism or Communism had a kind of popular support, and that there is a strong nostalgia for Stalin in modern Russia (as already mentioned, the documentary is dated 1996). ""Popular support"" is always a relative term, certainly in nations without free elections, but the remarkably large support for the Communist Party in Russia even after the fall of Communism, shows that this analysis wasn't far off the mark. In the Soviet Union, Communism was probably identified (at least since the mid-1930's) with Greater Russian nationalism, endearing it to many Russians (non-Russians had somewhat different ideas about it). In the documentary, the role of Stalin's best defender goes to his very own grandson Yevgeny, who believes that his grandfather made Russia strong, prosperous and respected.That being said, I will only give ""Joseph Stalin: Red Terror"" two stars.Let the attacks begin...",2,A shallow analysis,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,4904,"['Joseph', 'Stalin', 'Red', 'Terror', 'documentary', 'Soviet',

845444,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B0002V7KV4,Charles Ashbacher,"[23, 25]","My friends are often surprised when I mention that one of the historical figures that I would like to meet is Joseph Stalin. I would like the opportunity to look into the eyes of a man who methodically planned and ordered the deaths of over 20 million people. Of course, I would only do so through the safety of historical retrospective, because without that, it would mean certain death. Stalin was a brutal man, yet in his own way a master politician. One of the most astonishing facts of history was the public and private statements of Franklin Roosevelt, who said that he liked ""Old Joe."" These statements were made after Roosevelt was well aware of what Stalin had done in the Soviet Union.This history of Stalin captures the essence of his rule and the amazing hold he had on the vast Soviet Union. Millions of people treated him as an infallible demi-god, although one wonders how much of the adulation was genuine compared to that which was simple self-preservation in a society terrified with itself. The best part, and the most telling about Stalin was the description of how he eliminated all of his rivals among the old Bolsheviks. By making alliances with one side and then the other, Stalin was able to eliminate all of his enemies. In the final analysis, the old Bolsheviks (other than Stalin), were fundamentally intellectuals, who were ruthless to their external enemies, but could not stomach a death battle with a comrade. Stalin of course had no such scruples and he swept aside all opposition, killing all who even hinted at opposition.With the downfall of the Soviet Union, more information has come out and we now know how much of a tyrant Stalin was. We should all study this tape and learn what unchecked power can do to a country and a man. It is also a reminder of how wise the framers of the U. S. constitution were when they designed the three branches of government with the conflicting checks and balances.",4,A lesson in what absolute power can do to a country,1032393600,"09 19, 2002",2002,1938,"['friends', 'are', 'often', 'surprised', 'when', 'mention', 'one', 'historical', 'figures', 'would', 'like', 'meet', 'Joseph', 'Stalin', 'would', 'like', 'opportunity', 'look', 'eyes', 'man', 'who', 'methodically', 'planned', 'ordered', 'deaths', '20', 'million', 'people', 'course', 'would', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'safety', 'historical', 'retrospective', 'would', 'mean', 'certain', 'death', 'Stalin', 'was', 'brutal', 'man', 'yet', 'own', 'way', 'master', 'politician', 'One', 'most', 'astonishing', 'facts', 'history', 'was', 'public', 'private', 'statements', 'Franklin', 'Roosevelt', 'who', 'said', 'liked', 'Old', 'Joe', 'statements', 'were', 'made', 'Roosevelt', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'what', 'Stalin', 'had', 'done', 'Soviet', 'Union.This', 'history', 'Stalin', 'essence', 'rule', 'amazing', 'hold', 'had', 'vast', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Millions', 'people', 'treated', 'infallible', 'demi-god', 'one', 'how', 'much', 'adulation', 'was', 'genuine', 'compared', 'was', 'simple', 'self-preservation', 'society', 'terrified', 'best', 'part', 'most', 'telling', 'Stalin', 'was', 'description', 'how', 'eliminated', 'rivals', 'old', 'Bolsheviks', 'making', 'alliances', 'one', 'side', 'then', 'other', 'Stalin', 'was', 'able', 'eliminate', 'enemies', 'final', 'analysis', 'old', 'Bolsheviks', 'other', 'Stalin', 'were', 'fundamentally', 'intellectuals', 'who', 'were', 'ruthless', 'external', 'enemies', 'could', 'not', 'stomach', 'death', 'battle', 'comrade', 'Stalin', 'course', 'had', 'such', 'scruples', 'swept', 'aside', 'opposition', 'killing', 'who', 'even', 'hinted', 'downfall', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'more', 'information', 'come', 'out', 'now', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'tyrant', 'Stalin', 'was', 'should', 'study', 'tape', 'learn', 'what', 'unchecked', 'power', 'can', 'do', 'country', 'man', 'also', 'reminder', 'how', 'wise', 'framers', 'U.', 'S.', 'constitution', 'were', 'when', 'designed', 'three', 'branches', 'government', 'conflicting', 'checks', 'balances']",N/A
845445,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0002V7KV4,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[44, 47]","During his decades-long reign as absolute ruler of the Soviet Union, Stalin made himself the very face of Communism, rewriting history to make of him a hero of the Revolution itself.  No idealistic thinker, Stalin was the thug who could be counted upon to always get things done - at any cost.  Even today, one associates Stalin much more quickly than Lenin with the defunct USSR, and some Russians actually look back upon Stalin's reign with an element of nostalgia, denying Stalin's crimes the way Stalin denied elements of the history of his own country.  History clearly shows us that Stalin was the most evil man/killer of the twentieth century and quite possibly the most paranoid, brutal leader the world has ever known.  It seems impossible to believe that he could be looked upon as ""Uncle Joe"" during the days of the Russian-American-British alliance against the Germans in World War II, for Stalin cared only for power and nothing else.Stalin saw enemies everywhere, even among his closest associates, and he even betrayed and executed prominent members of the original Bolshevik Revolution during the era of his infamous purges.  Lenin, in his final days, had turned against Stalin, knowing just how brutal a man he was, yet Stalin was able to rise to absolute power by forming political alliances and then betraying (and killing) those he had allied himself with; he basically wiped out everyone he saw as a potential threat.  Russian heroes such as Trotsky and Bukharin were betrayed and eliminated by an increasingly paranoid Stalin.  In terms of the general population, some 20 million Soviet citizens were killed by Stalin in one form or another.  Millions starved to death while Stalin refused to acknowledge the fact that his collectivization plans were complete failures.  Soldiers returning home from World War II were exiled and killed to eliminate any future threat they might pose to Stalin.  Gulags were set up and masses of people forcefully relocated, resulting in hardship and deaths on a massive scale.  Ridiculously cruel punishments were handed down for the most trivial of crimes, while false charges were just as good as legitimate crimes in Stalin's book.  Stalin crushed the Russian people under his boots, using terror and torture to cement his complete dominance over the entire population of the country.Many of the heinous crimes committed by Stalin are recounted in this biographical presentation.  Most remarkably of all, we are shown that many of Stalin's subjects blamed the terror and repression of everyday life on overzealous local leaders rather than Stalin himself; when Khrushchev spoke of Stalin's brutalities in 1956, many were deeply shocked by the allegations.  It seems hard to believe in today's world, but Stalin remained popular throughout his entire career.  He was in fact a godlike figure, thanks to his shameless use of endless propaganda and indoctrination programs.This video offers an interesting perspective on Hitler and Stalin.  The Russian leader saw enemies everywhere at home, but he miscalculated greatly when he believed that Hitler would stick to his word and not invade Russia.  Stalin was shocked when Germany attacked, and his military (whose leadership core had been decimated by Stalinist purges) teetered on the brink of defeat in the early months of the fight.  The fear of another such attack via the Polish corridor of Europe compelled him to lay claim to the nations of Eastern Europe following the war; thus it was that the Iron Curtain descended upon Europe in the wake of World War II.This is one of the more impressive programs in the A&E; Biography series.  Featuring interviews with such stalwart individuals as Stephen J. Cohen, Mikhail Gorbechev, Condaleezza Rice, Stalin's former interpreter, and Stalin's grandson, this video grants you very insightful access into the mind and black heart of one of history's most evil murderers and liars.  For Stalin, ""death solves all problems,"" and Stalin was, in this maniacal context, the greatest problem-solver in history.  His crimes against mankind and millions of his own people must never be forgotten.",5,An impressive overview of evil incarnate in the form of man,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,4141,"['decades-long', 'reign', 'absolute', 'ruler', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Stalin', 'made', 'very', 'face', 'Communism', 'rewriting', 'history', 'make', 'hero', 'Revolution', 'idealistic', 'thinker', 'Stalin', 'was', 'thug', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'counted', 'always', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'cost', 'Even', 'today', 'one', 'Stalin', 'much', 'more', 'quickly', 'Lenin', 'defunct', 'USSR', 'Russians', 'actually', 'look', 'back', 'Stalin', 'reign', 'element', 'nostalgia', 'denying', 'Stalin', 'crimes', 'way', 'Stalin', 'denied', 'elements', 'history', 'own', 'country', 'History', 'clearly', 'Stalin', 'was', 'most', 'evil', 'man/killer', 'twentieth', 'century', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'paranoid', 'brutal', 'leader', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'impossible', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'looked', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'days', 'Russian-American-British', 'alliance', 'Germans', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Stalin', 'cared', 'only', 'power', 'nothing', 'else.Stalin', 'saw', 'enemies', 'everywhere', 'even', 'closest', 'associates', 'even', 'betrayed', 'executed', 'prominent', 'members', 'original', 'Bolshevik', 'Revolution', 'era', 'infamous', 'purges', 'Lenin', 'final', 'days', 'had', 'turned', 'Stalin', 'knowing', 'just', 'how', 'brutal', 'man', 'was', 'yet', 'Stalin', 'was', 'able', 'rise', 'absolute', 'power', 'forming', 'political', 'alliances', 'then', 'betraying', 'killing', 'had', 'allied', 'basically', 'wiped', 'out', 'everyone', 'saw', 'potential', 'threat', 'Russian', 'heroes', 'such', 'Trotsky', 'Bukharin', 'were', 'betrayed', 'eliminated', 'increasingly', 'paranoid', 'Stalin', 'terms', 'general', 'population', '20', 'million', 'Soviet', 'citizens', 'were', 'killed', 'Stalin', 'one', 'form', 'Millions', 'starved', 'death', 'Stalin', 'refused', 'acknowledge', 'fact', 'collectivization', 'plans', 'were', 'complete', 'failures', 'Soldiers', 'returning', 'home', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'were', 'exiled', 'killed', 'eliminate', 'future', 'threat', 'might', 'pose', 'Stalin', 'Gulags', 'were', 'set', 'up', 'masses', 'people', 'forcefully', 'relocated', 'resulting', 'hardship', 'deaths', 'massive', 'scale', 'Ridiculously', 'cruel', 'punishments', 'were', 'handed', 'down', 'most', 'trivial', 'crimes', 'false', 'charges', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'legitimate', 'crimes', 'Stalin', 'book', 'Stalin', 'crushed', 'Russian', 'people', 'boots', 'using', 'terror', 'torture', 'cement', 'complete', 'dominance', 'entire', 'population', 'country.Many', 'heinous', 'crimes', 'committed', 'Stalin', 'are', 'recounted', 'biographical', 'presentation', 'Most', 'remarkably', 'are', 'shown', 'many', 'Stalin', 'subjects', 'blamed', 'terror', 'repression', 'everyday', 'life', 'overzealous', 'local', 'leaders', 'rather', 'Stalin', 'when', 'Khrushchev', 'spoke', 'Stalin', 'brutalities', '1956', 'many', 'were', 'deeply', 'shocked', 'allegations', 'hard', 'believe', 'today', 'world', 'Stalin', 'remained', 'popular', 'entire', 'career', 'was', 'fact', 'godlike', 'figure', 'thanks', 'shameless', 'use', 'endless', 'propaganda', 'indoctrination', 'programs.This', 'video', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'Hitler', 'Stalin', 'Russian', 'leader', 'saw', 'enemies', 'everywhere', 'home', 'miscalculated', 'greatly', 'when', 'believed', 'Hitler', 'would', 'stick', 'word', 'not', 'invade', 'Russia', 'Stalin', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'Germany', 'attacked', 'military', 'leadership', 'core', 'had', 'been', 'decimated', 'Stalinist', 'purges', 'teetered', 'brink', 'defeat', 'early', 'months', 'fight', 'fear', 'such', 'attack', 'Polish', 'corridor', 'Europe', 'compelled', 'lay', 'claim', 'nations', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'following', 'war', 'thus', 'was', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'descended', 'Europe', 'wake', 'World', 'War', 'II.This', 'one', 'more', 'impressive', 'programs', 'A', 'E', 'Biography', 'series', 'Featuring', 'interviews', 'such', 'stalwart', 'individuals', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cohen', 'Mikhail', 'Gorbechev', 'Condaleezza', 'Rice', 'Stalin', 'former', 'interpreter', 'Stalin', 'grandson', 'video', 'very', 'insightful', 'access', 'mind', 'black', 'heart', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'evil', 'murderers', 'liars', 'Stalin', 'death', 'problems', 'Stalin', 'was', 'maniacal', 'context', 'greatest', 'problem-solver', 'history', 'crimes', 'mankind', 'millions', 'own', 'people', 'must', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten']",N/A
