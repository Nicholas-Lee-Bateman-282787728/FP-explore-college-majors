There is a nice mix of action and drama with good dubbing. I also thought the entrance music was really great to start off the show with. You will get all four episodes on this disk which in turn is the whole series. Extras include trailers, textless songs, and the original preview. You follow the life of Toru Soma, a computer hacker with amazing skills. He belongs to a group of computer hackers who call themselves Steppin Wolf. The group decides to have one final hack and then disband, but who knew this would be the one that would change their lives forever. When one of Toru's friends is killed by a military operative, he vows to join the military and find the killer. Little did he know of the secrets he would find. So which of the two worlds is real?

After watching all four, I just feel the need to want more from this series. It would have been nice if it contained at least 12 or 24-26 episodes like most short anime series that FUNimation usually license. But nonetheless, it was a nice 2 hour ride.

1139960,A3F2VVGAVQLQ91,B0012Z5UL6,Kimberly Huebner,"[16, 18]","I wasn't too sure what to think of this one when I first ran across it while browsing thru all the anime titles listed here on Amazon. I had not heard of this series & I pondered over it a bit before I finally decided ""Eh, What the heck.""  I picked this one up from a third party seller (& brand new) for a little under six dollars (a bit over eight bucks by the time shipping was tacked on).  I didn't have very high expectations, so I was surprised when it turned out to be actually very good.  This is one of those rare little gems that I just happened to stumble upon & left me wondering why I hadn't heard of/run across it long before now.I will do my best to summerize this series without spoiling it.Baldr Force EXE is a series about Toru Souma, a hacker who prefers the virtual world of the ""Wire"" to the real world. Toru is a member of a group of hackers that call themselves Steppen Wolf. Yuya, the leader of Steppen Wolf & Toru's close friend, decides that the group should disband because it's getting too dangerous & that it's only a matter of time before FLAK (the military organization in charge of protecting the ""Wire"" from cyber terrorism) catches up with them. All agree that disbanding is a good idea, but that they should  go out in style with one final hack. Unfortunately their last hack ends in tragedy, with the arrest of the members of Steppen Wolf & Toru vowing revenge. Toru reluctantly agrees to joining FLAK in order to not serve any jail time & to keep his friends from serving jail time & also as a way to avenge his friend. While on a misson with his new FLAK teammates, he runs across a girl who seems to know him. Little does he know that this meeting will trigger a chain of events that will link his past to the future of the ""Wire"". Well, this is all you will get from me as far as a summary of the storyline because I really don't want to ruin it for those of you who have not seen it. Sorry. :)This is a short series consisting of four episodes on one disc. Surprisingly Baldr Force EXE is very well done for being only four episodes. The storyline has a good consistent flow that keeps the watcher interested, the action is not at all lacking & the characters are all very human with normal human emotions.  I will warn you that this does carry a MA (mature) rating. Although the language was fairly tame, there is some female nudity & a slightly disturbing rape scene. The deaths of some minor characters early on are also a bit graphic.  The only ""extras"" are textless songs, trailers of other Funimation offerings & the original preview.  If you enjoy sci-fi & mecha anime, this one is definitely worth checking out.",5,Better Than Expected,1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,2660,"['was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'one', 'when', 'first', 'ran', 'browsing', 'anime', 'titles', 'listed', 'here', 'Amazon', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'series', 'pondered', 'bit', 'finally', 'decided', 'Eh', 'What', 'heck', 'picked', 'one', 'up', 'third', 'party', 'seller', 'brand', 'new', 'little', 'six', 'dollars', 'bit', 'eight', 'bucks', 'time', 'shipping', 'was', 'tacked', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'rare', 'little', 'gems', 'just', 'happened', 'stumble', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'of/run', 'long', 'now.I', 'will', 'do', 'best', 'summerize', 'series', 'spoiling', 'it.Baldr', 'Force', 'EXE', 'series', 'Toru', 'Souma', 'hacker', 'who', 'virtual', 'world', 'Wire', 'real', 'world', 'Toru', 'member', 'group', 'hackers', 'call', 'Steppen', 'Wolf', 'Yuya', 'leader', 'Steppen', 'Wolf', 'Toru', 'close', 'friend', 'group', 'should', 'disband', 'getting', 'too', 'dangerous', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'FLAK', 'military', 'organization', 'charge', 'protecting', 'Wire', 'cyber', 'terrorism', 'up', 'agree', 'disbanding', 'good', 'idea', 'should', 'go', 'out', 'style', 'one', 'final', 'hack', 'Unfortunately', 'last', 'hack', 'tragedy', 'arrest', 'members', 'Steppen', 'Wolf', 'Toru', 'vowing', 'revenge', 'Toru', 'reluctantly', 'joining', 'FLAK', 'order', 'not', 'serve', 'jail', 'time', 'keep', 'friends', 'serving', 'jail', 'time', 'also', 'way', 'avenge', 'friend', 'misson', 'new', 'FLAK', 'teammates', 'girl', 'who', 'know', 'Little', 'know', 'meeting', 'will', 'trigger', 'chain', 'events', 'will', 'link', 'past', 'future', 'Wire', 'Well', 'will', 'get', 'as', 'far', 'summary', 'storyline', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Sorry', 'short', 'series', 'consisting', 'four', 'episodes', 'one', 'disc', 'Surprisingly', 'Baldr', 'Force', 'EXE', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'being', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'storyline', 'good', 'consistent', 'flow', 'watcher', 'interested', 'action', 'not', 'lacking', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'human', 'normal', 'human', 'emotions', 'will', 'warn', 'carry', 'MA', 'mature', 'rating', 'language', 'was', 'fairly', 'tame', 'female', 'nudity', 'slightly', 'disturbing', 'rape', 'scene', 'deaths', 'minor', 'characters', 'early', 'are', 'also', 'bit', 'graphic', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'textless', 'songs', 'trailers', 'other', 'Funimation', 'offerings', 'original', 'preview', 'enjoy', 'sci-fi', 'mecha', 'anime', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Baldr Force EXE S.A.V.E.
