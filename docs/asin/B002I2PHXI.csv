I don't know if the transfer was difficult and pieces were lost or what happened. But I've viewed SEASON 3 and now finished SEASON 2 via movie rentals. It's a small portion of retrospect that MAJORITY OF US who remember them will enjoy as good entertainment. I was a teenager when they aired, but I knew of all the different controversies that went along with the 60's. But the SMOTHERS BROTHERS COMEDY HOUR was not only controversial but they were very popular and one of the TOP VARIETY SHOWS of it's times!! Not only did they cater to an older audience (which shows when they pan out into the audience) but at least every other show had either NEW musical groups on their show: The Who, The Hollies, The Byrds, The Association, Donovan...the list is endless for those 3 years!Anyone who grew up during this time period will be taken back in time and should enjoy of all the political satire, musical groups, and skits of the Smothers Brothers. I first was exposed to listening to them on comedy albums as a youngster with famous comedians as: Bill Cosby and Jonathan Winters.But back to reviewing the disk set...yes they are random episodes that they chose to view on each disk. You might have 4-6 episodes on one disc, but you have added material of the Smothers Brothers discussing the episode and the controversy at the time of the episode at the end. This all evidently adds time constraints on the dvd disk and thus some material is probably omitted or just deleted from that particular episode.All and all it's a good walk down memory lane!",5,BEST OF THE BEST!!,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,1655,"['are', 'edited', 'clips', 'episodes', 'seem', 'be', 'full', 'episodes', 'seem', 'shorter', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'transfer', 'was', 'difficult', 'pieces', 'were', 'lost', 'what', 'happened', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'SEASON', '3', 'now', 'finished', 'SEASON', '2', 'movie', 'rentals', 'small', 'portion', 'retrospect', 'MAJORITY', 'OF', 'US', 'who', 'remember', 'will', 'enjoy', 'good', 'entertainment', 'was', 'teenager', 'when', 'aired', 'knew', 'different', 'controversies', 'went', '60', 'SMOTHERS', 'BROTHERS', 'COMEDY', 'HOUR', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'controversial', 'were', 'very', 'popular', 'one', 'TOP', 'VARIETY', 'SHOWS', 'times', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'cater', 'older', 'audience', 'when', 'pan', 'out', 'audience', 'least', 'other', 'show', 'had', 'NEW', 'musical', 'groups', 'show', 'Who', 'Hollies', 'Byrds', 'Association', 'Donovan', 'list', 'endless', '3', 'years', 'Anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'time', 'period', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'time', 'should', 'enjoy', 'political', 'satire', 'musical', 'groups', 'skits', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'first', 'was', 'exposed', 'listening', 'comedy', 'albums', 'youngster', 'famous', 'comedians', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Jonathan', 'Winters.But', 'back', 'reviewing', 'disk', 'set', 'are', 'random', 'episodes', 'chose', 'view', 'disk', 'might', 'have', '4-6', 'episodes', 'one', 'disc', 'have', 'added', 'material', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'discussing', 'episode', 'controversy', 'time', 'episode', 'end', 'evidently', 'time', 'constraints', 'dvd', 'disk', 'thus', 'material', 'probably', 'omitted', 'just', 'deleted', 'particular', 'episode.All', 'good', 'walk', 'memory', 'lane']",N/A

We finally get to see Leigh French doing her most famous character in the segments of ""Share A Little Tea With Goldie.""One of the fun parts of watching the SmoBro Shows is the looseness; they may stumble through an intro but, instead of doing another take, they laff and make fun of themselves. During a scene with Mama Cass, Dickie announces a Q&A; period; Tommy says ""no, we're not gonna do that now"" then you see (but don't hear) Dickie say to Tommy ""why aren't we doing it?"" and Tommy answers...it's this type of looseness that gives another boost to the show...they leave moments like these in rather than re-shoot.The interviews are plentiful and insightful. I especially enjoyed the interview with Pete Seeger who gives us a little more insight on his media blacklisting. There is also a gallery showing letters from viewers who protested the upcoming episode with Pete Seeger, calling him ""anti-American"" in almost every one...they usually start out the same: ""I am writing in protest,"" which makes it apparent there was some dunderhead that started a ""Ban Pete Seeger"" campaign and his followers followed orders...it's SO friggin' obvious. It amazes me how someone (Seeger) who was against war and for peace could be labeled ""anti-American"". It shows how manipulated some of our own countrymen were in the 60's. Other interviews include Don Rickles, Leigh French, Glen Campbell, Mason Williams, Nancy Wilson, a very funny one from Pat Paulsen and background info on the episodes by Tom & Dick themselves.Wonderful color and great guests (Don Rickles, Jimmy Durante, Bette Davis, Janet Leigh, Rowan & Martin, Don Knotts, Nanette Fabray, Mickey Rooney, George Segal, Mel Torme and many others).The rock guests include The Who (yup, the famous clip!), Paul Revere & The Raiders, The Byrds, The Association, The Temptations and Janis Ian (who is also interviewed).The clip of Tommy finally receiving an Emmy for comedy writing (from the 2008 Emmy Awards) is great; especially when the camera shows Dickie in the audience - you can see on his face how PROUD he is of his brother. These Bros truly love each other, unlike many other ""family"" acts who squabble continuously over the years.All these shows were during the hotbed we called the Vietnam war and the SmoBros made us laugh while they ripped apart The Establishment, The Man and The Great Society. This is a priceless set that any TV aficionado (and comedy fan) should have. Even though these are labeled as ""Best of"" and not complete seasons, that doesn't mean they won't release the other episodes in the future.

1269074,A37S3ACL57LN62,B002I2PHXI,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[19, 21]","The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour was a television show from the late 1960s which is known today for the struggle the brothers experienced with CBS's censors.Season 2's packaging is just like that for season 3; it is a ""best of"" collection, and some of the episodes have slight cuts based on what Tom and Dick thought should be included. It is frustrating for completists not to have the entire season here, but it is better than nothing.In fact, it is much better than nothing. Season 2 is outstanding and features many excellent guests. The second episode alone features Bette Davis, Mickey Rooney, and The Who who famously explode their drum and cause chaos on the stage. Also appearing are James Mason, Edgar Bergen, Don Knotts, and Jimmy Durante and musical guests include Pete Seeger, The Byrds, The Temptations, and Glen Campbell.There are great comedy bits, like the brothers singing ""I Fell in a Vat of Chocolate,"" or all dressed up for their parts in Mutiny on the Bounty. Pat Paulsen adds a lot of laughs to the show, especially during his presidential candidacy nomination speeches. ""Share a Little Tea With Goldie"" has some great moments as well.Although it is incomplete, this set is definitely worth owning.",4,"Great Guests, Great Laughs",1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,1222,"['Smothers', 'Brothers', 'Comedy', 'Hour', 'was', 'television', 'show', 'late', '1960s', 'known', 'today', 'struggle', 'brothers', 'experienced', 'CBS', 'censors.Season', '2', 'packaging', 'just', 'season', '3', 'best', 'collection', 'episodes', 'have', 'slight', 'cuts', 'based', 'what', 'Tom', 'Dick', 'thought', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'frustrating', 'completists', 'not', 'have', 'entire', 'season', 'here', 'better', 'nothing.In', 'fact', 'much', 'better', 'nothing', 'Season', '2', 'outstanding', 'many', 'excellent', 'guests', 'second', 'episode', 'alone', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Who', 'who', 'famously', 'explode', 'drum', 'cause', 'chaos', 'stage', 'Also', 'appearing', 'are', 'James', 'Mason', 'Edgar', 'Bergen', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Jimmy', 'Durante', 'musical', 'guests', 'include', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'Byrds', 'Temptations', 'Glen', 'Campbell.There', 'are', 'great', 'comedy', 'bits', 'brothers', 'singing', 'Fell', 'Vat', 'Chocolate', 'dressed', 'up', 'parts', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'Pat', 'Paulsen', 'lot', 'laughs', 'show', 'especially', 'presidential', 'candidacy', 'nomination', 'speeches', 'Share', 'Little', 'Tea', 'Goldie', 'great', 'moments', 'incomplete', 'set', 'definitely', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A
1269075,A1NM0M8VVIVZ4T,B002I2PHXI,"Spin Doctor ""Doc""","[4, 5]","...but I prefer the Season 2 set over Season 3. Both are good, and my reaction may well have two reasons unrelated to disc content: (1) my expectations were much higher for Season 3, and (2) I'd read David Bianculli's ""Dangerously Funny"" immediately before the Season 2 set arrived, so I had a much better understanding of what happened during that season that's not contained on the set or even mentioned in the extras. If you're a Smothers fan, I'd recommend getting the book first, then the DVDs.My opinion is that the Smothers' comedy bits are much sharper in Season 2 -- that could just be because the routines are more familiar to me (""I Talk to the Trees"", for example). And as far as skits, ""Up the Down Salesman"" remains a riot 40+ years later. Mickey Rooney is terrific as Willie Lomax, the door-to-door anvil salesman, and Bette Davis unexpectedly fun as his ""beautiful wife who doesn't mess around"". Dick appears as disappointing son #2, who evolved into a peacenik flower child during his father's absences on the road...and Tom as disappointing #1 son, the ""athlete"" who was coached by his mother and therefore throws everything -- from footballs to newspapers -- like a girl. All great stuff, an A+ parody.Some musical performances are missing that I'd have liked to see, but you do get the Byrds, the Association, and of course the Who and Pete Seeger.Don't get me wrong, though. The Season 3 set is worth the price for Disk 4 alone, Pat Paulsen's presidential run documentary that's rightfully billed as a satirical masterpiece. It's so good that it's painfully accurate even today.",5,You can call me stupid...,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,1599,"['prefer', 'Season', '2', 'set', 'Season', '3', 'are', 'good', 'reaction', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'two', 'reasons', 'unrelated', 'disc', 'content', '1', 'expectations', 'were', 'much', 'higher', 'Season', '3', '2', ""'d"", 'read', 'David', 'Bianculli', 'Dangerously', 'Funny', 'immediately', 'Season', '2', 'set', 'arrived', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'understanding', 'what', 'happened', 'season', 'not', 'contained', 'set', 'even', 'mentioned', 'extras', ""'re"", 'Smothers', 'fan', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'book', 'first', 'then', 'DVDs.My', 'opinion', 'Smothers', 'comedy', 'bits', 'are', 'much', 'sharper', 'Season', '2', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'routines', 'are', 'more', 'familiar', 'Talk', 'Trees', 'example', 'as', 'far', 'skits', 'Down', 'Salesman', 'riot', '40+', 'years', 'later', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'terrific', 'Willie', 'Lomax', 'door-to-door', 'anvil', 'salesman', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'unexpectedly', 'fun', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'who', ""n't"", 'mess', 'around', 'Dick', 'disappointing', 'son', '2', 'who', 'evolved', 'peacenik', 'flower', 'child', 'father', 'absences', 'road', 'Tom', 'disappointing', '1', 'son', 'athlete', 'who', 'was', 'coached', 'mother', 'therefore', 'throws', 'everything', 'footballs', 'newspapers', 'girl', 'great', 'stuff', 'A+', 'parody.Some', 'musical', 'performances', 'are', 'missing', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'do', 'get', 'Byrds', 'Association', 'course', 'Who', 'Pete', 'Seeger.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'though', 'Season', '3', 'set', 'price', 'Disk', '4', 'alone', 'Pat', 'Paulsen', 'presidential', 'run', 'documentary', 'rightfully', 'billed', 'satirical', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'good', 'painfully', 'accurate', 'even', 'today']",N/A
