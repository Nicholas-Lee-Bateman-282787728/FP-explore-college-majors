The skill by which the development and resolution of this bizarre and chilling classic make it a modern landmark.  Just by this movie alone, Night established himself as Hitchcock's successor.To describe anything more than a bare-bones rendering of the plot would be irresponsible, but here it goes... Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) celebrates with his wife a recent award achieved helping counsel disturbed children.  Soon he meets up with the weaknesses of his past and must suffer the consequences.  For the rest of the movie he has to make it all up with a new client, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) and balance his desire to make his wife his main priority.  The juggle isn't easy, and he falters, but is honest, in both attempts to make up mistakes for his past.  The causality of another dimension presented is disturbing, yet fascinating.The tension of the story is counterbalanced with a heart that makes more than one plot accessible and enthralling.  The performances are superb with arguably Willis' best ever.  Osment, for his part, plays a prodigy as a prodigy in what has to be one of the best (if not ""the"" best) childhood performances on film.  The supporting cast is remarkable as well.  Perhaps critics have given 'The Sixth Sense' grudging praise, for it means to unveil the supernatural in a way that is meant to mirror the real world in an unflattering way.  (Psychology is rendered at least overrated.)  Shymalan is effective like few directors are with a film that is edited for every second to wrap around the other expertly.

Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane.Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that.My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on ""the surprise ending"" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress.THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters.That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start.(The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.)""The ending."" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on ""the ending?"" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it.Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this?""Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium.""That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE.

It's damn good and Bruce Willis didn't have to kill anybody. ;)  I could end my review there, but I think there's more to it than that. The Sixth Sense is one of the films of the '90s that really blew me away the first time I watched it, and with each viewing it gets better. I've seen it four times now. A child shrink, Malcolm Crowe (Willis), takes on the case of a traumatized 9-year-old boy named Cole (Osment) who can communicate with the dead. His divorced mother Lynn (Collette) is worried about her son's frequent nightmares and episodes of acting out. Director Shyamalan shows that he knows how to startle an audience and create a creepy atmosphere, and the script and actors are first-rate. The heavily-awarded Osment turns in a touching, brilliant performance as the terrified young boy, a performance of such depth that is rare for an actor of his age. I can't wait to see what he'll do as he grows and matures. (Also watch for him as Forrest Jr. in 1994's Forrest Gump.) Willis's acting is wonderful too, and it's great to see him in a subdued role like this.Definitely worth buying for the DVD extras, which tell a lot about the making of the film and other little things that make it more enjoyable to watch.",5,I smell dead people!,1026691200,"07 15, 2002",2002,1400,"['gift', 'lot', 'more', 'icky', 'Eww', 'smell', 'rotting', 'corpses', 'least', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'can', 'close', 'eyes', ""'re"", 'gone', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'damn', 'good', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'kill', 'anybody', 'could', 'end', 'review', 'there', 'think', 'more', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'one', 'films', ""'90s"", 'really', 'blew', 'away', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'viewing', 'better', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'four', 'times', 'now', 'child', 'shrink', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'Willis', 'case', 'traumatized', '9-year-old', 'boy', 'named', 'Cole', 'Osment', 'who', 'can', 'communicate', 'dead', 'divorced', 'mother', 'Lynn', 'Collette', 'worried', 'son', 'frequent', 'nightmares', 'episodes', 'acting', 'out', 'Director', 'Shyamalan', 'how', 'startle', 'audience', 'create', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'script', 'actors', 'are', 'first-rate', 'heavily-awarded', 'Osment', 'touching', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'terrified', 'young', 'boy', 'performance', 'such', 'depth', 'rare', 'actor', 'age', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'matures', 'Also', 'watch', 'Forrest', 'Jr.', '1994', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Willis', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'too', 'great', 'see', 'subdued', 'role', 'this.Definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD', 'extras', 'tell', 'lot', 'making', 'film', 'other', 'little', 'things', 'make', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch']",The Sixth Sense VHS

The Sixth Sense most definately did, and I'm not just saying that to be like everybody else. Haley Joel  Osment is an excellent young actor, and Willis is in top form in this  flick. He handled an intelligent, sensitive role better than I ever thought  possible, and Haley, well... Haley is already an icon of precocious youth.  Because these actors were well-suited to their roles, the film is smooth  and progresses naturally, without feeling rushed or pushed. I also liked  the fact that Shyamalan didn't overuse the gore and ghosts aspect of the  movie, for that would've quickly desensitized me. Instead, he placed the  ghosts sparingly, at parts in the movie when they would create the most  uproar amongst the audience.

However I would like to clarify some of the arguments from those people who denied The Sixth Sense in the previous reviews:(1) Unless you can identify with the little boy, you will not be 'scared' by The Sixth Sense. Because it does not 'TRY' to scare you. It is simply a supernatural DRAMA that tells a story of a little boy, and what HE sees is scary to him. Put you into his shoes - eight years old, seeing dead people walking around in the house - wouldn't that be scary if it was you? Or maybe you have been drinking so much since then that all your brain cells have been killed so you cannot remember your childhood imagination? Want to be scared till your pants drop? Want to see large amount of blood only the blood bank of the county hospital can supply? Then go back to watch your B-grade slasher flick. ""Sixth Sense"" is not for you.(2) People who claimed that they have guessed the ending from the first ten minutes because it was so 'pathetically obvious', how exactly did you do that? Simply by 'he got shot -> the next fall when he was sitting on the bench', and all the secrets revealed? It's either you are a psychic, or you are amazingly simple-minded. Or even you have seen it before and just trying to show off how clever you are. The fact is, boast about how easy it is for you to guess the ending does not make you a more intelligent audience, but more superficial. If you are so smart, why aren't you making one of the biggest box-office hit last year?(3) Some claimed that it is unreasonable for the ghosts not to know that they are dead, and spite the story to be stupid. But, how many ghosts do you know? How do you know what the ghosts know and don't know? You don't even know whether there are ghosts or not and yet you made yourself to be the representative of the nether world? This is a story that is being told like it has never been. Since you think the idea is absurd, then there is no way you would be able to tell a story like this, ever. Consequence? See (2) above. By the way, how many films DO make sense? 'Scream To The Infinity'? 'I Know What You Did On My Grandmother's Birthday Party'?(4) As for the DVD itself, there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DISC!! All the problem that occurs is because of your DVD player, either the setup or player function. Read your player manual before you throw all your blames onto a quality disc.(5) One reviewer said that the 'deleted scenes' are 'cut out' from the theatrical release... PLEASE!!! They are NOT. They are the scenes that never surfaced in cinema and put back by the director into the disc as an extra, he also explained why they were left out. One other said that the 'Storyboard-Film comparison' was not there, how come?

Film and film and film again and yet nothing comes close to that bone-chilling feeling one gets every time they hear those four famous words uttered...""I see dead people.""M. Night Shyamalan made a household name for himself no matter how difficult the pronunciation with this `Grade-A' supernatural thriller about a young boy troubled by his unique gift.  The film opens with a tragic event involving Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who has just received an award in his honor.  But before the celebrations can truly begin he's confronted by an ex-patient of his who it seems Crowe was never able to help.  The aftershocks of that evening ring throughout the remainder of the film as Crowe's relationship with his wife becomes more and more strained.  But as that relationship slowly dies he forms a bond with his new patient Cole Sear.  Cole has a problem that is presents itself almost too familiar with Crowe.  It appears that Cole can communicate with the dead.Both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are outstanding in this brilliant film.  Some have claimed Willis to be too reserved and reclusive and thus leaving the entire film on the shoulders of the very capable Osment, but in my eyes both of these actors contribute exactly what they needed in order to make this film work.  Willis wears the confusion of his situation on his face with earnest honesty and that adds layers to his character.  Osment shines so brightly here and should have walked away with the Oscar that night, but alas, he'll have his day again I'm sure.  He gives Cole so much charm and charisma.  He's able to create a believable nine-year-old boy without playing the complexity of his character down at all.  He adds so much believable maturity.  It's truly astounding to watch.The star of this film though is Shyamalan who instills a deep-rooted fear into the audience from the very beginning.  It's this very asset that sets `The Sixth Sense' apart from all the Hollywood cheap imitations that seemed to swarm the theaters shortly after `The Sixth Sense' made a killing and set the bar.  Sure, there are a few that followed that were worth the price of admission (the Nicole Kidman vehicle `The Others' was one of them), but for the most part nothing since has even touched the surface of the effortless brilliance that was and is `The Sixth Sense'.  The lighting, the music, the atmosphere, set designs, script and acting all add so much originality and suspense to this one of a kind experience.There's hardly a fault to be found with this multi-Academy Award nominated film.  The entire cast (I should make mention of the amazing Toni Collette who is just fascinating as Cole's frustrated mother) delivers down to the bone and makes this a film to watch again and again and again.",5,Dark and disturbing and sincerely one of the very best...,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,2889,"['greatest', 'thing', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'date', 'yet', 'be', 'topped', 'not', 'even', 'director', 'Film', 'film', 'film', 'again', 'yet', 'nothing', 'close', 'bone-chilling', 'feeling', 'one', 'time', 'hear', 'four', 'famous', 'words', 'uttered', 'see', 'dead', 'people.', 'M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'made', 'household', 'name', 'matter', 'how', 'difficult', 'pronunciation', 'Grade-A', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'young', 'boy', 'troubled', 'unique', 'gift', 'film', 'tragic', 'event', 'involving', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'child', 'psychologist', 'who', 'just', 'received', 'award', 'honor', 'celebrations', 'can', 'truly', 'begin', 'confronted', 'ex-patient', 'who', 'Crowe', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'help', 'aftershocks', 'evening', 'ring', 'remainder', 'film', 'Crowe', 'relationship', 'wife', 'more', 'more', 'strained', 'relationship', 'slowly', 'bond', 'new', 'patient', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'Cole', 'problem', 'presents', 'almost', 'too', 'familiar', 'Crowe', 'Cole', 'can', 'communicate', 'dead.Both', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'are', 'outstanding', 'brilliant', 'film', 'have', 'claimed', 'Willis', 'be', 'too', 'reserved', 'reclusive', 'thus', 'leaving', 'entire', 'film', 'shoulders', 'very', 'capable', 'Osment', 'eyes', 'actors', 'contribute', 'exactly', 'what', 'needed', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'Willis', 'confusion', 'situation', 'face', 'earnest', 'honesty', 'layers', 'character', 'Osment', 'shines', 'so', 'brightly', 'here', 'should', 'have', 'walked', 'away', 'Oscar', 'night', 'alas', ""'ll"", 'have', 'day', 'again', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Cole', 'so', 'much', 'charm', 'charisma', 'able', 'create', 'believable', 'nine-year-old', 'boy', 'playing', 'complexity', 'character', 'down', 'so', 'much', 'believable', 'maturity', 'truly', 'astounding', 'watch.The', 'star', 'film', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'deep-rooted', 'fear', 'audience', 'very', 'beginning', 'very', 'asset', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'apart', 'Hollywood', 'cheap', 'imitations', 'seemed', 'swarm', 'theaters', 'shortly', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'made', 'killing', 'set', 'bar', 'Sure', 'are', 'few', 'followed', 'were', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'vehicle', 'Others', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'part', 'nothing', 'even', 'touched', 'surface', 'effortless', 'brilliance', 'was', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'lighting', 'music', 'atmosphere', 'set', 'designs', 'script', 'acting', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'originality', 'suspense', 'one', 'kind', 'hardly', 'fault', 'be', 'found', 'multi-Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'film', 'entire', 'cast', 'should', 'make', 'mention', 'amazing', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'who', 'just', 'fascinating', 'Cole', 'frustrated', 'mother', 'down', 'bone', 'film', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'again']",The Sixth Sense VHS

Bruce Willis broke his steretypical one-line warrior role and made us believe that he could be more than a tough guy, like say, a sensitive and intelligent psychiatrist.

474490,AK6UVFSU07NXH,630573240X,Anthony Hinde,"[4, 6]","It must be difficult to cast films where the central character is a young child, particularly when the role is so emotionally demanding. In the case of The Sixth Sense, Avy Kaufman either got very lucky or made an inspired  choice by casting Haley Joel Osment. He plays Cole Sear and owns the screen  for the large majority of the show.Cole is tormented but it isn't  until about half way through the film that we find out it is because he can  see the dead. And to an eight-year-old, being visited by disturbed, maimed  and angry spirits is horrifying. It's made all the worse because he has no  one he can turn to for support. He is the only one who can see ghosts and  his behavior has made him a freak in the eyes of his classmates and  teacher.The film starts with a frightening glimpse of what Cole  may become. Renowned child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe has a grim reunion  with a former patient. An unstable child of yesteryear, Vincent Gray, has  grown into a fractured and psychotic adult who wants nothing more than to  remind Malcolm of his failure, before killing himself. The reminder takes  the form of a bullet in his doctor's stomach.We catch up with the  good doctor, played superbly by Bruce Willis, about a year later. (This  role is not unlike that Willis had in The Color of Night, although in this  case his character is a gentler soul.) Malcolm is reviewing his case notes  on young Cole, prior to their introduction. We learn that Cole's profile is  identical to Vincent's, Malcolm's patient from years earlier. The big clue  for the audience is that Vincent and Cole both have a small spot of blond  hair within their otherwise dark locks.The film builds slowly,  which is not to imply that it is dull. In fact a better description would  be &quot;mesmerizing&quot;. We are forced to care for  young Cole as a  clearer picture is painted of his day to day existence. No night is safe  for him, no place is free of fear and no one understands his torment. In a  desperate bid for sanctuary he turns to the church and the questionable  protection of religious symbols, which he shamelessly steals, building a  chapel in his bedroom.His local church is where Cole and Malcolm  first meet, after a strange solo dash down the street. And so begins the  careful building of a relationship, a friendship, and eventually a  salvation for both of them. For Cole is not the only one with problems. Dr  Crowe is also a changed man. The dramatic shooting and suicide of his  patient has shaken Malcolm's faith. He is no longer a satisfied purveyor of  mental balms but a frightened, uncertain victim. His wife Anna, seems  unable or unwilling to deal with the situation; and what had been a close  and loving relationship is now teetering on the brink of collapse.It is not long before we realize that Malcolm is Cole's only hope for  sanity and conversely, Cole may be Malcolm's last chance for redemption.  With a foundation like that, I was looking forward to the meat of the  story. Cole does eventually come to trust in Malcolm but we already know  that trust is not a cure in itself. Vincent was a potent lesson of this. So  when Cole reveals his secret, it is simply a gauntlet thrown down to  Malcolm. Cole claims to be able to see the dead. A classic case of  schizophrenic delusions but unusual in one so young.Up to this  point in the film we have seen nothing of a supernatural nature, only the  sad effects that Cole exhibits. And so Malcolm's diagnosis is  understandable. Once the secret is out however, our viewpoint is released  and we are able to see as Cole does. His world is populated by terrifying  beings that seem ignorant of their own maimed appearance and, in Cole's  words, only see what they choose to see and have no understanding of their  own death. His midnight callers create some of the scariest cinema I've  seen in years. Not because of cutting edge special effects but because we  share Cole's helplessness in the face of his &quot;gift&quot;. Even his  homemade church offers no protection and he is driven past despair.I can't go any further into the story without running the risk of  spoiling the final plot twist. Instead, I will simply beg you to see this  gripping, intelligent and deeply emotional movie. Let's put some more money  in the pockets of director M. Night Shyamalan in the hopes that he will  continue to make movies of this caliber.",5,You know that feeling you get on the back of your neck?,958003200,"05 11, 2000",2000,4406,"['must', 'be', 'difficult', 'cast', 'films', 'where', 'central', 'character', 'young', 'child', 'particularly', 'when', 'role', 'so', 'emotionally', 'demanding', 'case', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Avy', 'Kaufman', 'got', 'very', 'lucky', 'made', 'inspired', 'choice', 'casting', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'screen', 'large', 'majority', 'show.Cole', 'tormented', ""n't"", 'way', 'film', 'find', 'can', 'see', 'dead', 'eight-year-old', 'being', 'visited', 'disturbed', 'maimed', 'angry', 'spirits', 'horrifying', 'made', 'worse', 'one', 'can', 'turn', 'support', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'ghosts', 'behavior', 'made', 'freak', 'eyes', 'classmates', 'teacher.The', 'film', 'frightening', 'glimpse', 'what', 'Cole', 'may', 'become', 'Renowned', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Dr', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'grim', 'reunion', 'former', 'patient', 'unstable', 'child', 'yesteryear', 'Vincent', 'Gray', 'grown', 'fractured', 'psychotic', 'adult', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'remind', 'Malcolm', 'failure', 'killing', 'reminder', 'form', 'bullet', 'doctor', 'stomach.We', 'catch', 'up', 'good', 'doctor', 'played', 'superbly', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'year', 'later', 'role', 'not', 'Willis', 'had', 'Color', 'Night', 'case', 'character', 'gentler', 'soul', 'Malcolm', 'reviewing', 'case', 'notes', 'young', 'Cole', 'prior', 'introduction', 'learn', 'Cole', 'profile', 'identical', 'Vincent', 'Malcolm', 'patient', 'years', 'earlier', 'big', 'clue', 'audience', 'Vincent', 'Cole', 'have', 'small', 'spot', 'blond', 'hair', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'locks.The', 'film', 'builds', 'slowly', 'not', 'imply', 'dull', 'fact', 'better', 'description', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'mesmerizing', 'quot', 'are', 'forced', 'care', 'young', 'Cole', 'clearer', 'picture', 'painted', 'day', 'day', 'existence', 'night', 'safe', 'place', 'free', 'fear', 'one', 'torment', 'desperate', 'bid', 'sanctuary', 'church', 'questionable', 'protection', 'religious', 'symbols', 'shamelessly', 'building', 'chapel', 'bedroom.His', 'local', 'church', 'where', 'Cole', 'Malcolm', 'first', 'meet', 'strange', 'solo', 'dash', 'street', 'so', 'careful', 'building', 'relationship', 'friendship', 'eventually', 'salvation', 'Cole', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'problems', 'Dr', 'Crowe', 'also', 'changed', 'man', 'dramatic', 'shooting', 'suicide', 'patient', 'shaken', 'Malcolm', 'faith', 'no', 'longer', 'satisfied', 'purveyor', 'mental', 'balms', 'frightened', 'uncertain', 'victim', 'wife', 'Anna', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'deal', 'situation', 'had', 'been', 'close', 'loving', 'relationship', 'now', 'teetering', 'brink', 'collapse.It', 'not', 'long', 'realize', 'Malcolm', 'Cole', 'only', 'hope', 'sanity', 'conversely', 'Cole', 'may', 'be', 'Malcolm', 'last', 'chance', 'redemption', 'foundation', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'meat', 'story', 'Cole', 'eventually', 'come', 'trust', 'Malcolm', 'already', 'know', 'trust', 'not', 'cure', 'Vincent', 'was', 'potent', 'lesson', 'So', 'when', 'Cole', 'secret', 'simply', 'gauntlet', 'thrown', 'down', 'Malcolm', 'Cole', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'dead', 'classic', 'case', 'schizophrenic', 'delusions', 'unusual', 'one', 'so', 'young.Up', 'point', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'nothing', 'supernatural', 'nature', 'only', 'sad', 'effects', 'Cole', 'so', 'Malcolm', 'diagnosis', 'understandable', 'secret', 'out', 'however', 'viewpoint', 'released', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'Cole', 'world', 'populated', 'terrifying', 'beings', 'seem', 'ignorant', 'own', 'maimed', 'appearance', 'Cole', 'words', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'choose', 'see', 'have', 'understanding', 'own', 'death', 'midnight', 'callers', 'create', 'scariest', 'cinema', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'Not', 'cutting', 'edge', 'special', 'effects', 'share', 'Cole', 'helplessness', 'face', 'quot', 'gift', 'quot', 'Even', 'homemade', 'church', 'protection', 'driven', 'past', 'despair.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'story', 'running', 'risk', 'spoiling', 'final', 'plot', 'twist', 'Instead', 'will', 'simply', 'beg', 'see', 'gripping', 'intelligent', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'movie', 'Let', 'put', 'more', 'money', 'pockets', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'hopes', 'will', 'continue', 'make', 'movies', 'caliber']",The Sixth Sense VHS

This could have been an outstanding movie, but alas, too many plot-holes, and too many unanswered questions.  Not the good kind of unanswered--the kind of unanswered that shows that the creators of the movie couldn't think in a straight line.Why did Cole know Latin?  Why did he know his teacher used to stutter?  Why did Malcolm never wonder why he doesn't eat, shower, or sleep?  Why would Cole's mother's grandmother leave the bumblebee pendant in Cole's bureau drawer?  Where's the sense in that?  Why did the dead people, hung by their necks, NOT KNOW THEY WERE DEAD?!  And all three of them?  What a co-ink-ee-dink!And Malcom's wife could NOT talk to him in her sleep.  You cannot speak or hear when you're in the deepest stage of sleep, and if she had been in a stage light enough to hear Malcolm and speak to him, she would have startled awake from the freezing cold, his voice, or from hearing herself speak aloud.&quot;Clues&quot; could have been handled more delicately.  It's just silly to have &quot;insight&quot; presented to us through Malcolm's flamboyant circling of script in his textbooks.I really liked how the two noxious kids who locked Cole in the closet didn't even get questioned or scolded for either a) locking him in there or b) standing there stupidly while he screamed and spazzed out.Also, this flick just wasn't that scary.  I jumped once, and that's because I had the volume too darned loud.  I'd expected a real spine-tingler.Too much sentimental stuff.  Resonance is good in a movie--Cole going on about great-grandma seeing his mother's recital is not.This movie had some strong points, but the weak points kept nagging at me throughout the entire film.  I had expected near-perfection considering the hype this movie got AND the Oscar nominations, to boot. :(However, it is kind of spooky to imagine that the reason we feel fear when we're alone is that there really ARE ghosts lurking in our midst.  But then again, isn't hocus-pocus superstition what usually prompts fear in the first place?

I particularly loved the  'Rules and Clues' segment which explained how the famous twist had to be  believable for both the first and second viewings. Some were obvious but  some were pretty obscure and admittedly, maybe I'm a little dim, but I  think the editors gave their viewers a little too much credit in the  fine-detail detective work! We didn't know we had any reason to be looking  for clues! Fascinating stuff anyway.The 'deleted scenes' were also great  to see and quite considerable in content. You kind of agree with the  reasons for the deletions but understand the angst at having to remove such  great scenes. The DVD is worth it just to see those extra moments between  Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis.And how ever many times it's been  said, I have to add to the tributes to Haley Joel Osment and say that his  portrayal of Cole was flawless.

I agree with the other viewers who are disgusted with the DVD version containing (what is considered to be VHS material)soon to be outdated movie pre-views . What  was the studio or distributor and marketing execs thinking by featuring  Mission to Mars and other previews on a Collector's Edition DVD; Obviously  they weren't. Imagine seeing your DVD copy of The Sixth Sense 5-10 years  from now and thinking how nostalgic and dated it will look and feel seeing  that blasphemous Mission to Mars preview with its theatrical date release  glaring at you !As for The Sixth Sense, without a shadow of a doubt, it  definitely deserves to be placed high on a mantle or pedestal next to  1999's Academy favorite and winner American Beauty !I also would've  enjoyed seeing Haley Joel Osment win for Best Supporting Actor. So what if  the kid is only a kid.Many film critics were astonished by his performance  yet said that for a child to receive the Oscar at that age would be too  soon for his career ! Hogwash.In this day and age nothing is &quot;too  soon&quot; for anybody's career--especially an award for a child of this  acting caliber. He acts with more genuine feeling and emotion than most  so-called professional adult actors out there in today's film industry (  shocking that some of these actors are still in the business despite their  lack of acting skills).Bruce Willis gave one of his more finer  performances in quite awhile. I can see why he was chosen to play Malcolm.  They say those with a comedic or witty and sarcastic exterior are the ones  who are more apt to show greater and deeper emotions of a serious sensitive  nature.Bruce showed that there ain't nothing wrong with a man showing his  more tender and emotional side without having to make a wisecrack to cover  up for some sort of insecurity complex! You go Bruce...As for the  performances by Wahlberg and Collette, simply OUTSTANDING ! Could not  believe that Wahlberg lost about 40 lbs. for the role; talk about an actor  literally throwing himself into the role (method actor ?).  As for Toni  Collette, I did not know she is originally from Australia and was in  Muriel's Wedding.She was able to swap her Aussie accent for a New Jersey  one; fascinating !The story, plot, effects, were equally mesmerizing.

People who don't understand this movie either (a) don't pay close attention to what's happening in this movie; (b) just don't know much about the sixth  sense; or (c) don't believe in the sixth sense.The 'sixth sense', for  those who have no clue on what it is, is a &quot;special power&quot; that  some people (very few, however) can have.

In the beginning, Malcolm and his wife meet one of Malcolm's old  patients. That patient tells Malcolm that Malcolm hadn't helped him solve  his problems, that it just made his problems worse. So Malcolm's patient  ended up shooting Malcolm with a gun and then killed himself. A year later,  Malcolm's new patient is 9-year-old Cole Sears who has the sixth sense.  He's afraid of the ghosts and spirits who &quot;haunt&quot; him - that's  his secret that he shares with Malcolm. Cole hides out in a church for  sanctuary reasons because of the ghosts. When Malcolm finds out Cole's  secret, he tries to help Cole get rid of the ghosts and make them leave him  alone.'The Sixth Sense' is a really good thriller starring Bruce Willis  and Haley Joel Osment with a really surprising ending! The acting is  spectacular, and Haley Joel Osment shines in this movie (it's a real shame  he didn't win that Oscar for 'Best Supporting Actor' - he really deserved  it)! The plot of this movie is brilliant, and seemed very real, like it  could really happen to someone.

Night Shyamalan, and I've seen a few other of his pictures, and now I think I'm going to have to check out what else he has done. He's got a way with supernatural themes that makes them seem downright natural. It's an art, that is.Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist who has just received an award from the Mayor of Philadelphia (Shyamalan lives in the wealthy Main Line near Philadelphia) for his work with troubled children. But one of his former patients shows up in his apartment accusing him of failing him. He shoots Dr. Crowe and then himself.Later, Dr. Crowe is still trying to make sense of how he failed that patient, and starts treating young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment, one of my favorite child actors) for a condition very similar to the one that shot him and then himself. After several rather bizarre situations, Cole eventually tells Dr. Crowe his secret: he sees dead people. Dr. Crowe suggests that perhaps the reason is they want him to do something for them.You'll probably see the ending coming a mile away. I did because someone had done a spoiler on it for me. But that does not reduce the value of the movie one whit. And while is it a thriller and there are some scary, bloody parts, they are not really gross. Well, I guess the little girl who vomits as profusely as Linda Blair ever did is pretty gross, but it's only because I'm a real wimp about horror movies.This one is worth seeing.

474506,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,630573240X,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 4]","M. Night Shyamalan accomplished something really great with this frightening chiller. He created a scary horror film that was just that. Scary. No over the top effects, no gratuitous gore with no reason for being there, and so on. It's an old fashioned ghost story meant to give you the chills. Probably a few willies here and there too. Bruce Willis stars as child Psychologist Malcolm Crowe. He's helping a 9 year old boy named Cole Sear(brilliantly played by Haley Joel Osment)who seems to have the gift of seeing ghostly visions. Of actually seeing and hearing spirits. The case is especially significant to Dr. Crowe. A patient of his had broken into the doctor's house a few months earlier and shot him. The guy then turned the gun on himself and pulled the trigger. He definitley doesn't want another patient to turn out like that. His marriage to his wife(played by Olivia Williams), hasn't been the same since. Shyamalan knows how to set the mood. There are dark colors, ghostly effects, and just some moody looking shots. Very eerie. Shyamaln has crafted the film together so brilliantly. It's clever and imaginative. I guarantee that you will be watching the film a few more times afterwards to piece everything all together. Bruce Willis is really good. He's not just the &quot;Die Hard&quot; guy. He's a real actor, and a good one at that too. Then there's young Osment. He delivers a shockingly magnificent portrayal as Cole. Never have I seen such a mesmerizing performance from a young actor in all my life. He was nominated for the Oscar and he deserved it. He really could have won. Toni Collette, as his mother, was fabulous as well. Shyamalan is a creative and imaginative director/writer. He really is a talent to watch. He followed this up with the darker &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. It wasn't as good, but very interesting nonetheless.

Why it caught on in terms of popularity across the United States back in the late 90's is totally beyond me.  When I first watched this movie, the first thing that went through my mind was ""Oh no, this movie is going to kill the horror genre"".  Luckily not every single horror movie ripped off the ideas of this film to make the entire genre worthless (unlike say, Van Halen, whose influence made listening to guitar solos in a rock song a chore from that point on, but that's a different subject for a different time).I was never *ever* scared while watching the Sixth Sense.  Not even once.  Nothing even came close to giving me goosebumps.  Everything came across so ordinary, almost like a dream from a childs point of view.  No, not a nightmare- just a regular dream.  I was completely unsatisfied with the acting as well.  The little boy from Thunder Alley was the worst possible choice- he wasn't convincing at all.  I didn't feel his emotions (which were overbearingly exaggerated most of the time).  The whole ""I see dead people"" thing was about the dumbest thing I've ever seen.  Watching him walk around and say things like ""There's a dead guy over there"" didn't have me convinced a dead spirit was around him at all.  Guess what everyone?  There's a dead guy standing next to me while I type this review for amazon.  I'm scared, shaking and very nervous right now.  Are you scared?  Of course not.Going to high school when this movie came out, I can't believe so many of my classmates were scared of this story and actually went around saying the new hot expression ""I see dead people"".

What he hears changes his mind about Cole... his previous patient wasn't imagining ghostly voices, they were real, and could be heard faintly in the background of the tape.Now being aware of the reality of Cole's condition, and that what was assumed to be mental illness is really uncontrolled mediumistic ability, Dr. Crowe assists the young boy in communicating with the spirits to determine what they want.The real twist to the story comes as Dr. Crowe realizes that he, too, is dead (killed by his first mediumistic patient) and only Cole can communicate with him.The realism of this movie is what makes it so frightening.  For instance, the accurate depiction of the temperature dropping in the presence of a ghoist... something most parapsychological authorities agree on.  Or the ability to capture ghostly images on film, and voices on audio tape.Thank you, M. Night Shyamalan (director) for not resulting to the usual special effects, or groaning chain-rattling depictions of ghosts.

Then again The Green Mile was also nominated so it's fairly easy  to conclude that the Oscars have no credibility anymore.People glorify  the Sixth Sense in the same way that they glorified Saving Private Ryan.  They saw the opening beach sequence in that film and thought &quot;wow,  that part was so good, the rest of the film has to be good.&quot; Well it  wasn't at all. Did anybody care about the fact that each character in  Saving Private Ryan was nothing more than a cartoon charater? It was a  wonderful example of how Steven Spielberg cannot make a movie anymore  without having something big to distract the viewer from the fact that the  film is mediocre. Unfortunately the Sixth Sense suffers from the same  problems, it's nothing but mediocrity that impresses everyone because of  the finale.There are plenty of other better movies to see this year:  Magnolia, Fight Club, Eyes Wide Shut, American Beauty, Election, Sweet and  Lowdown, Go, The Insider, The Limey, Being John Malkovich...

Both feature Bruce Willis in the starring role and are &quot;eerily&quot; similar in their cinematic tricks. We get lots of vague, essentially nebulous lighting (I really do need to get glasses, I guess!)and thinly-construed plot. Shyamalan is regarded in Hollywood circles as the next Steven Speilberg, but what he serves up is rather thin gruel in the larger scheme of things, even though after wincing through A.I. I see the validity of the comparisons (Sorry, Steve, I really did love &lt;Schindler's, one of the great films of the century&gt;).What this film fails to deliver is the type of dramatic tension that is evident in such masterpieces as &lt;The Innocents&gt; (an immensely well-crafted child-oriented ghost tale adapted from Henry James' &lt;The Turn of the Screw&gt;, screenplay by Truman Capote, and &lt;Jacob's Ladder&gt;, neglected pretty much by the Oscar committee and the mainstream press, but infinitely savvier and scarier than this imitation. In fact, &lt;Jacob's Ladder&gt; has almost the exact same ending as &lt;The Sixth Sense&gt;, but I've never seen or heard of M. Night Shyamalan giving credit to this earlier, superior, screenplay.

474541,A1GB1Q193DNFGR,630573240X,Bruce Lee Pullen,"[1, 3]","M. Night Shyamalan's sleeper hit The Sixth Sense is an outstanding surrealstic supernatural character study that showcases unusually restrained and effective acting by Bruce Willis as a dedicated child  psychologist who after receiving an award for his superb work in his field  gets an unexpected visit by a previous patient who shots Willis and then  turns his gun on himself. This traumatic event starts a downward spiral in  Willis's life that leaves him with nothing but his work with a troubled  young child. Haley Joel Osment, in an Oscar caliber performance, plays an  emotionally distressed boy who is blessed or cursed with the ability to see  and interact with the spirits of the dead. Osment's star-making performance  shines with more passionate human emotion and authenticfear than any child  performance since Linda Blair in the Exorcist (1973). What makes this film  drastically different than the convential horror or suspence film, is that  this film takes itself seriously by allowing the  characters, plot, and  locale to gradually build to where the audience feels as if boys like  Osment actually due exist somewhere in America. The Sixth Sense will be  remembered in years to come as an atmospheric suspence classic that  cleverly dealt wih its subject honestly enough to make itself feel fresh  and engaging everytime you watch it.",5,Brillance Can Be Sensed By All,952473600,"03 8, 2000",2000,1355,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'outstanding', 'surrealstic', 'supernatural', 'character', 'study', 'unusually', 'restrained', 'effective', 'acting', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'dedicated', 'child', 'psychologist', 'who', 'receiving', 'award', 'superb', 'work', 'field', 'unexpected', 'visit', 'previous', 'patient', 'who', 'Willis', 'then', 'gun', 'traumatic', 'event', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Willis', 'life', 'nothing', 'work', 'troubled', 'young', 'child', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'performance', 'emotionally', 'distressed', 'boy', 'who', 'blessed', 'cursed', 'ability', 'see', 'interact', 'spirits', 'dead', 'Osment', 'star-making', 'performance', 'shines', 'more', 'passionate', 'human', 'emotion', 'authenticfear', 'child', 'performance', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'Exorcist', '1973', 'What', 'film', 'drastically', 'different', 'convential', 'horror', 'suspence', 'film', 'film', 'seriously', 'allowing', 'characters', 'plot', 'locale', 'gradually', 'build', 'where', 'audience', 'feels', 'boys', 'Osment', 'actually', 'due', 'exist', 'somewhere', 'America', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'years', 'come', 'atmospheric', 'suspence', 'classic', 'cleverly', 'dealt', 'wih', 'subject', 'honestly', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'fresh', 'engaging', 'everytime', 'watch']",The Sixth Sense VHS

474545,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,630573240X,Busy Body,"[5, 7]","When I first saw The Sixth Sense way back in January 2000, I remember being absolutely amazed and stunned by the excellence of this film. I'd never seen a film that - while being slow paced - gripped me for the entire time I watched it. The Sixth Sense was THE film of 1999, and went on to become the most successful horror movie in the history of recorded film - grossing $679.4 million worldwide by April 2000. There were a number of highly successful horror films of the 1990's such as The Blair Witch Project, The Haunting, House On Haunted Hill and the Scream trilogy. This doesn't mean to say they were any good. The Sixth Sense is a rare film that deals with ghosts and psychic ability in such a realistic manner, that was a welcome change from all the silly slasher-type films - and a perfect one to round off the decade...The Sixth Sense revolves around two main characters; Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Malcolm is an award-winning child psychologist who is happily married to his considerably younger wife, Anna (Olivia Williams). They are relaxing one night at their home, when Malcolm is shot by one of his former, now-adult patients, Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg). The film continues months later. Malcolm has apparently recovered from the shooting and becomes involved with a new patient, nine-year-old Cole Sear. Cole's parents are divorced and he has no close friends - infact, his closest friend ""hates him."" Cole's mother, Lynn (Toni Collette) begins to notice that her son isn't happy, and that maybe something's going on in which he won't tell her - like finding cuts and bruises on Cole's back. A while into the film, Cole confides in Malcolm that he sees dead people - walking around like ordinary people. And that he sees them ""all the time."" Malcolm isn't sure whether to believe him or not, but stumbles across a recorded tape way back when he was involved with Vincent Grey. On the tape, Malcolm leaves the room with only Vincent is in there. It's clear from the tape (when Malcolm increases the volume) that someone else is in there with Vincent. Malcolm comes up with the suggestion that Cole must face his fears and communicate with these dead people - see what they want, and why the keep following him around. In return, Cole helps Malcolm with problems that he's experiencing with his wife - she won't talk to him, and he doesn't know why. Malcolm's discovery in the end has to be one of the best and most shocking twists in cinematic history.The factor that makes The Sixth Sense so superb is the extraordinary acting skills of Haley Joel Osment. I have seen quite a lot of movies, and the acting of Osment in The Sixth Sense is absolutely amazing. After each major scene in which something truly gripping occurs, the screen fades to black - giving it a touch to it that makes it unique. I remember watching this film last night on terrestrial TV, and (now a few years down the line after it's initial release) realising that a wide variety of scenes in The Sixth Sense have already reached classic status. The one where the dead girl grabs Cole's leg from underneath her bed is a perfect example of this - the expression on Cole's face making it all the more iconic. The scene with the girl being sick in Cole's red tent is another (the tent constantly being used as a metaphor by children as a means of protection), along with the hospital bed scene which sparked a worldwide catchphrase; ""I see dead people!"" Director M. Night Shyamalan is superb, and with classic films such as The Sixth Sense and the superb Signs, is definitely on his way to becoming the new Spielberg. I have seen a lot of films in which Bruce Willis stars, and I have to say this is one of the best. He takes a backseat to his macho stereotype, and the effects are very rewarding. Willis is very believable as a softer, more gentle character in the form of Malcolm. Toni Collette plays the confused single mother image extremely well. At first it's difficult to distinguish whether she is protective or abusive towards Cole - but as the film picks up momentum, it's obviously the former.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10The Sixth Sense is officially the highest-grossing horror film in history, which surprises me a little. The film received hardly any publicity until after its success at awards ceremonies. I have now seen The Sixth Sense about 10 times, and never tire of watching it. Of course, the film cannot be viewed day after day (as this would just be too repetitive), but once every three or four months still manages to thrill you in a way no other film did before it, or any film that will in the future.",5,A Massive Horror Masterpiece,1044230400,"02 3, 2003",2003,4648,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'way', 'back', 'January', '2000', 'remember', 'being', 'absolutely', 'amazed', 'stunned', 'excellence', 'film', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'being', 'slow', 'paced', 'gripped', 'entire', 'time', 'watched', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'THE', 'film', '1999', 'went', 'become', 'most', 'successful', 'horror', 'movie', 'history', 'recorded', 'film', 'grossing', '679.4', 'million', 'worldwide', 'April', '2000', 'were', 'number', 'highly', 'successful', 'horror', 'films', '1990', 'such', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Haunting', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'Scream', 'trilogy', ""n't"", 'mean', 'say', 'were', 'good', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'rare', 'film', 'deals', 'ghosts', 'psychic', 'ability', 'such', 'realistic', 'manner', 'was', 'welcome', 'change', 'silly', 'slasher-type', 'films', 'perfect', 'one', 'round', 'off', 'decade', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'around', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Malcolm', 'award-winning', 'child', 'psychologist', 'who', 'happily', 'married', 'considerably', 'younger', 'wife', 'Anna', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'are', 'relaxing', 'one', 'night', 'home', 'when', 'Malcolm', 'shot', 'one', 'former', 'now-adult', 'patients', 'Vincent', 'Grey', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'film', 'months', 'later', 'Malcolm', 'apparently', 'recovered', 'shooting', 'involved', 'new', 'patient', 'nine-year-old', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'Cole', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'close', 'friends', 'infact', 'closest', 'friend', 'Cole', 'mother', 'Lynn', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'notice', 'son', ""n't"", 'happy', 'maybe', 'something', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'finding', 'cuts', 'bruises', 'Cole', 'back', 'while', 'film', 'Cole', 'Malcolm', 'dead', 'people', 'walking', 'ordinary', 'people', 'time', 'Malcolm', ""n't"", 'sure', 'believe', 'not', 'recorded', 'tape', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'involved', 'Vincent', 'Grey', 'tape', 'Malcolm', 'room', 'only', 'Vincent', 'there', 'clear', 'tape', 'when', 'Malcolm', 'volume', 'someone', 'else', 'Vincent', 'Malcolm', 'up', 'suggestion', 'Cole', 'must', 'face', 'fears', 'communicate', 'dead', 'people', 'see', 'what', 'want', 'why', 'keep', 'following', 'around', 'return', 'Cole', 'Malcolm', 'problems', 'experiencing', 'wife', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Malcolm', 'discovery', 'end', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'shocking', 'twists', 'cinematic', 'history.The', 'factor', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'superb', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'skills', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'lot', 'movies', 'acting', 'Osment', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'major', 'scene', 'something', 'truly', 'gripping', 'occurs', 'screen', 'black', 'giving', 'touch', 'unique', 'remember', 'watching', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'terrestrial', 'TV', 'now', 'few', 'years', 'line', 'initial', 'release', 'realising', 'wide', 'variety', 'scenes', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'have', 'already', 'reached', 'classic', 'status', 'one', 'where', 'dead', 'girl', 'grabs', 'Cole', 'leg', 'bed', 'perfect', 'example', 'expression', 'Cole', 'face', 'making', 'more', 'iconic', 'scene', 'girl', 'being', 'sick', 'Cole', 'red', 'tent', 'tent', 'constantly', 'being', 'used', 'metaphor', 'children', 'means', 'protection', 'hospital', 'bed', 'scene', 'sparked', 'worldwide', 'catchphrase', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'Director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'superb', 'classic', 'films', 'such', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'superb', 'Signs', 'definitely', 'way', 'becoming', 'new', 'Spielberg', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'films', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'stars', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'backseat', 'macho', 'stereotype', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'rewarding', 'Willis', 'very', 'believable', 'softer', 'more', 'gentle', 'character', 'form', 'Malcolm', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'confused', 'single', 'mother', 'image', 'extremely', 'well', 'first', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'protective', 'abusive', 'towards', 'Cole', 'film', 'up', 'momentum', 'obviously', 'former.OVERALL', 'GRADE', '10/10The', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'officially', 'highest-grossing', 'horror', 'film', 'history', 'little', 'film', 'received', 'hardly', 'publicity', 'success', 'awards', 'ceremonies', 'have', 'now', 'seen', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '10', 'times', 'never', 'tire', 'watching', 'course', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'viewed', 'day', 'day', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'too', 'repetitive', 'once', 'three', 'four', 'months', 'still', 'thrill', 'way', 'other', 'film', 'did', 'film', 'will', 'future']",The Sixth Sense VHS

On the onehand it's 'creepy' and 'a treat for horror fans', but it also 'hasbrains' and 'will please demanding viewers'.  And so you can imagine how much I was looking forward to watching this movie. And what a letdown it was. It reminded me of a cheap soap opera rather than of an intelligent mystery story. The relationships between the boy and his mother or between Willis' character and his wife made up a great part of the movie and were full of all the clichees we have to watch in any Hollywood tearjerker. The 'horror' part of the story was not much better, though. And the ending is unbelievable I seriously asked myself what made Bruce Willis star in this horrible flick. Willis' performance is not bad, though he's already been better, but the boy becomes really annoying after the first ten minutes.  The rest of the cast is forgettable.So that was it? Cut down to 30 minutes and aired on cable TV it might have been an okay entry in a mystery TV series, sometime between 'Ally McBeal' and 'The X-Files'. But as a full-length-feature it bored me more than any other 1999 movie (except for The Other Sister, maybe) - and take in consideration that I sat through such disastrous movies as The Thirteenth Warrior and Star Wars: Episode One.To me, anyway, The Sixth Sense is full of clichees, offers nothing new, has a story that lacks any plausibility, and is really, really boring from the beginning to the end.",1,Supernatural tearjerker,953424000,"03 19, 2000",2000,1474,"['Here', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'onehand', 'treat', 'horror', 'fans', 'also', ""'will"", 'please', 'demanding', 'viewers', 'so', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'movie', 'what', 'letdown', 'was', 'reminded', 'cheap', 'soap', 'opera', 'rather', 'intelligent', 'mystery', 'story', 'relationships', 'boy', 'mother', 'Willis', 'character', 'wife', 'made', 'up', 'great', 'part', 'movie', 'were', 'full', 'clichees', 'have', 'watch', 'Hollywood', 'tearjerker', ""'horror"", 'part', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'ending', 'unbelievable', 'seriously', 'asked', 'what', 'made', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'star', 'horrible', 'flick', 'Willis', 'performance', 'not', 'bad', 'already', 'been', 'better', 'boy', 'really', 'annoying', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'rest', 'cast', 'forgettable.So', 'was', 'Cut', 'down', '30', 'minutes', 'aired', 'cable', 'TV', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'okay', 'entry', 'mystery', 'TV', 'series', 'sometime', ""'Ally"", 'McBeal', 'X-Files', 'full-length-feature', 'bored', 'more', 'other', '1999', 'movie', 'Other', 'Sister', 'maybe', 'take', 'consideration', 'sat', 'such', 'disastrous', 'movies', 'Thirteenth', 'Warrior', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'anyway', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'full', 'clichees', 'offers', 'nothing', 'new', 'story', 'plausibility', 'really', 'really', 'boring', 'beginning', 'end']",The Sixth Sense VHS

That answer, when you strip away the twist ending everybody just had to see, was in the subtext of families being healed after a traumatic loss.  Just substitute in divorce instead of death and the resonance becomes clearer, much the same way many parents empathized with the discarded and forgotten toys of Toy Story 2.  All through the movie we see Willis's character, a fallen and broken man, continually trying to reconnect with his apparently estranged wife and his young patient, a surrogate son of sorts.  That the ghosts the boy sees are primarily victims of domestic abuse or simple neglect only further the subtext of a needed healing.

Images of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, and others raced through my mind.I was thrilled with the film's lack of violence, and I liked the antique (though glossy) look of the film.  And of course there were some good performances, most notably young Osment and Toni Colette (their moments together are the best in the film).  Bruce Willis was okay, but after the &quot;surprise&quot; ending, I guess I found his performance adequate.I guess I am somewhat let down by the hype of the film.  If I were a younger, less knowledgable and less educated filmgoer, I probably would have liked it more.  But I can't seem to forget good films I've already seen.  Or, just call me a snob (I guess I kind of am when it comes to art).To make things worse, the video features an interview with writer/director M. Night Shyamalan.  This guy has a tremendously inflated view of this film (and himself)!  You'd think he had created the next &quot;Godfather&quot;.  And, in accordance with the modern times, he went on and on about how much money the film made; as if that makes it a great film.  Let's remember that the single &quot;Physical&quot; by Olivia Newton John was a #1 hit for 10 weeks in 1981.  Topping the charts and getting people to talk about something do not a great piece of art make.

474570,A1FJ1U5LKD87RA,630573240X,"C. Lyles ""Movie Seer""","[3, 3]","The Sixth Sense was the first film M. Night Shyamalan directed where I learned of his name. The film was especially intriguing, in my opinion, because it focused on the nature of fear rather than just being afraid.  Some who love ""horror"" films may tend to treat them as if though they are action films, where they enjoy seeing the victim run away from a seemingly indestructible foe bent on mass murder with no cause behind it.  We laugh and say how stupid that person is for tripping while trying to get away rather than making it past the door entirely, so to speak.  Others may just want to be scared out their theater seats.  This effect may not be what Shyamalan is trying to achieve with this film.The fear in this film is not being projected towards us, the viewers, but towards the characters themselves.  The troubled protaganist, Cole Sear (played impressively by a young Haley Joel Osment), is being forced to deal with his fear in solitude since it is a form of it that not everyone can express.  This key point is what drives this impressive film.  The nature of fear is different for everyone, and through Cole's visions, we get a glimspe of what it is that truly scares him.  Not to give away anything specific, Cole sees something beyond ghosts.  He sees violence, pain, suffering, and most importantly, despair.  Each ghost he sees met its end in either a violent, painful, sufferable, or despairing way.  What Cole fears is actually the most deprecating aspects of human society: mankind's unwillingness to live  a peaceful life.  The only peace and stillness that Cole receives comes in the guise of Malcolm Crowe (another impressive turn for Bruce Willis).Like Cole, Malcolm has his own fears that he struggles with.  He fears the failure of his professional career, the seemingly impending failure of his marriage, and the possible failure of what type of man he seeks to be.  He buries this fear, letting no one see what it is that plagues him.  It is not until Malcolm and Cole establish their uneasy relationship where both individuals are able to seek some type of solace from their fears, an act that neither one could have accomplished on his own.  Just as love, hate, envy, jealousy, and other emotions can connect people with one another, fear can be just as powerful a bond as the others.  Fear essentially is the gravitas of this film.  People do not always need a saviour or hero to show them the way.  Simply sharing your differences and finding the common element between them can do just the trick.Other reviewers have used words like ""boring,"" ""ridiculous,"" and ""overrated"" when looking at this film.  Everyone has a right to his or her opinion.  However, where one person sees something boring, I see something insightful; where one person sees something ridiculous, I see something ever-presently intelligent; and where one person sees something overrated, I see something that is brave in its undertaking.  Make no mistake, I am not a film critic.  I could attempt to make some informed judgement on acting abilities, casting, plot, setting, and the likes.  But I respect the film industry enough to know that I am in no way qualified to make such judgments on a work of art, even if it is a movie.  Still, what I seek to communicate here is that sometimes, visionary directors want viewers to move past the surface and dig deeper, as archaeologists do, for the hidden meaning of things.  Shyamalan, I think, made a similar challenge in this film.  He may be saying that to be afraid is one thing, but more can come from it.  Anyone can be scared by any number of things, whether it is a dead man in a hockey mask hacking at teenagers with a machete, or a creature that was created or from outer space eating people to survive, or a serial killer with an omnipresent message of what it truly means to live who carves his powerful viewpoint on uncaring victims.  But to share your fear, and see how it too connects you to that unspoken realm of human existence is just as appealing and enlightening as knowing when to duck, run, and head for cover when something insane passes by with a malicious desire for murder in mind.",5,A True Gem of a Film With More Substance than Others May Admit,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,4162,"['Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'directed', 'where', 'learned', 'name', 'film', 'was', 'especially', 'intriguing', 'opinion', 'focused', 'nature', 'fear', 'rather', 'just', 'being', 'afraid', 'who', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'may', 'tend', 'treat', 'are', 'action', 'films', 'where', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'victim', 'run', 'away', 'seemingly', 'indestructible', 'foe', 'bent', 'mass', 'murder', 'cause', 'laugh', 'say', 'how', 'stupid', 'person', 'tripping', 'trying', 'get', 'away', 'rather', 'making', 'door', 'entirely', 'so', 'speak', 'Others', 'may', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'scared', 'out', 'theater', 'seats', 'effect', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'Shyamalan', 'trying', 'achieve', 'film.The', 'fear', 'film', 'not', 'being', 'projected', 'towards', 'viewers', 'characters', 'troubled', 'protaganist', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'played', 'impressively', 'young', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'being', 'forced', 'deal', 'fear', 'solitude', 'form', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'express', 'key', 'point', 'what', 'impressive', 'film', 'nature', 'fear', 'different', 'everyone', 'Cole', 'visions', 'get', 'glimspe', 'what', 'truly', 'Not', 'give', 'away', 'anything', 'specific', 'Cole', 'something', 'ghosts', 'violence', 'pain', 'suffering', 'most', 'importantly', 'despair', 'ghost', 'met', 'end', 'violent', 'painful', 'sufferable', 'despairing', 'way', 'What', 'Cole', 'actually', 'most', 'deprecating', 'aspects', 'human', 'society', 'mankind', 'unwillingness', 'live', 'peaceful', 'life', 'only', 'peace', 'stillness', 'Cole', 'guise', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'impressive', 'turn', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Cole', 'Malcolm', 'own', 'fears', 'failure', 'professional', 'career', 'seemingly', 'impending', 'failure', 'marriage', 'possible', 'failure', 'what', 'type', 'man', 'be', 'fear', 'letting', 'one', 'see', 'what', 'not', 'Malcolm', 'Cole', 'establish', 'uneasy', 'relationship', 'where', 'individuals', 'are', 'able', 'seek', 'type', 'solace', 'fears', 'act', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'accomplished', 'own', 'Just', 'love', 'hate', 'envy', 'jealousy', 'other', 'emotions', 'can', 'connect', 'people', 'one', 'fear', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'powerful', 'bond', 'others', 'Fear', 'essentially', 'gravitas', 'film', 'People', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'need', 'saviour', 'hero', 'show', 'way', 'Simply', 'sharing', 'differences', 'finding', 'common', 'element', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'trick.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'used', 'words', 'boring', 'ridiculous', 'overrated', 'when', 'looking', 'film', 'Everyone', 'right', 'opinion', 'However', 'where', 'one', 'person', 'something', 'boring', 'see', 'something', 'insightful', 'where', 'one', 'person', 'something', 'ridiculous', 'see', 'something', 'ever-presently', 'intelligent', 'where', 'one', 'person', 'something', 'overrated', 'see', 'something', 'brave', 'undertaking', 'Make', 'mistake', 'am', 'not', 'film', 'critic', 'could', 'attempt', 'make', 'informed', 'judgement', 'acting', 'abilities', 'casting', 'plot', 'setting', 'likes', 'respect', 'film', 'industry', 'enough', 'know', 'am', 'way', 'qualified', 'make', 'such', 'judgments', 'work', 'art', 'even', 'movie', 'Still', 'what', 'seek', 'communicate', 'here', 'sometimes', 'visionary', 'directors', 'want', 'viewers', 'move', 'surface', 'dig', 'deeper', 'archaeologists', 'do', 'hidden', 'meaning', 'things', 'Shyamalan', 'think', 'made', 'similar', 'challenge', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'saying', 'be', 'afraid', 'one', 'thing', 'more', 'can', 'come', 'Anyone', 'can', 'be', 'scared', 'number', 'things', 'dead', 'man', 'hockey', 'mask', 'hacking', 'teenagers', 'machete', 'creature', 'was', 'created', 'outer', 'space', 'eating', 'people', 'survive', 'serial', 'killer', 'omnipresent', 'message', 'what', 'truly', 'live', 'who', 'powerful', 'viewpoint', 'uncaring', 'victims', 'share', 'fear', 'see', 'how', 'too', 'unspoken', 'realm', 'human', 'existence', 'just', 'appealing', 'enlightening', 'knowing', 'when', 'duck', 'run', 'head', 'cover', 'when', 'something', 'insane', 'passes', 'malicious', 'desire', 'murder', 'mind']",The Sixth Sense VHS
474571,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,630573240X,C. Middleton,"[2, 4]","This is a film that has withstood the test of time. Despite viewing this haunting tale many times, and knowing its surprise ending, the story continues to intrigue, and still manages to reveal little nuances, details about the plot, that was missed during prior viewings. It is that type of picture, which should be studied, as it is a near perfect film.The Sixth Sense launched M. Night Shyamalan as a major writer and director with his own particular style of filmmaking. The Sixth Sense, fortunately, was not a one off, as Shyamalan has gone on to make further excellent films such as Unbreakable, Signs and The Village. This talented young man seems to have an innate gift for creating suspense and those subtle and not so subtle aspects of life that can cause us deep fear, things that truly frighten, without having to shove it in our faces. There are too many directors out there who feel they have to explode and shock, CGI-ing their audiences to death, in order to somehow keep us interested. These kinds of films have their place, however, the truly frightening films, like The Sixth Sense, rivets us to our chairs with subtle twists and turns, long suspenseful silences and the unexpected.A good example of this subtlety is right at the beginning of the film. The psychologist and his wife are having a celebration in their home. The doctor has won an award from the mayor and they're getting seriously stuck into the wine. Finishing a bottle, she goes down stairs to the cellar alone to retrieve another. The camera is placed behind the wine rack, as we view her reaching for a bottle, giving the distinct impression or perception, that we are in the room with her. She appears to hear something, voices, and her once joyful expression subtlety changes to one of fear. As the audience, we feel something terrible is about to happen, but we don't know exactly when or how.Another example is the many surprise manifestations of the dead that we see through the little boy's eyes. One of the more disturbing scenes is the woman in the dressing gown that he mistakes for his mother. He walks into the kitchen and the woman turns around revealing a battered face and fresh scars on her wrist from an attempted suicide. ""See what you've done to me!"" she screams. ""Look what I have to put up with!"" as the little boy runs to his room to hide in his tent, which he has made as a makeshift chapel, his sanctuary, away from the dead.We all enjoy the occasional scare, and there's nothing like a good ghost story to do it. What I find incredible about this film, though, is despite seeing it several times, knowing the story and its many surprises, it still manages to hold my attention and continues to create that feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach.

(Indeed, no film should contain the latter.)The heart of soul of the film is Cole Sear, a disturbed nine year-old who hides his run-ins with ghosts from everyone around him, including his mother. Actor Haley Joel Osment gives a stunningly mature and good performance, especially judging from the fact that he was not yet a teenager at the time. He is uniformly believable, and his character is very real--he is not one of those movie characters that makes you sick and eager to get the movie over with.Bruce Willis, playing the child phsychologist Malcolm Crowe, gives a very quiet performance, but still with plenty of feeling. He is not at all dry.You can tell from the get-go that M. Night Shyamalan is a master at his craft. The entire feel of the movie is perfect.

It was very good but I didn't find it as ""the greatest movie ever"" as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn't find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, I'm not going to spoil it here.I enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he's low key, as he is in here (and in ""Unbreakable,"" to name another fairly-recent movie)  Osment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He's simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.This isn't just some supernatural-horror movie. It's a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment's mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car.

Such films are more challenging in that it takes a special cohesiveness between a director, screenwriter, and cast to craft a story that will get inside the viewer's head and stay there days - even weeks - after having seen the film.  Though heavy on the suspense (naturally), all of the ""scary stuff"" is implied, which I feel has a much stronger effect on the audience than the average run-of-the-mill fright flick.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is one of only two films that I have seen in my lifetime that pulls this off successfully (""The Silence of the Lambs"" being the first).I had never heard of writer-director M. Night Shyamalan before seeing this film, but I knew afterwards that this guy was indeed a gifted film maker/storyteller, cut from the ""Hitchcock mold,"" with a long and prosperous career ahead of him.  It didn't hurt that ""Sense"" went on to earn almost $300 million in box office sales in North America from its August 6-8, 1999 opening.

That said, storywise, plotwise and actingwise, this is hands down the best supernatural film you will ever see.  Placed in the capable hands of writer/directer M. Night Shayamalan who proved he is a force to be reckond with as well as the very capable hands of actors Bruce Willis, Toni Colleti and Haley Joel Osment who well deserved the oscar nod this film rises above it's predesesors in that it reaches much more emotions than that of fear.  It reaches your heart as you watch this child deal with his 'gift' of sorts as well as Dr. Crowe (Willis) as he deals with the distance between him and his wife.  The ending is as shocking as they come and deffinatly earns itself recognition as Shyamalans best script (Unbreakable was good, and Village had its points but Signs was a complete mess)  I have to say that I have always found Bruce to be an impressive actor, but I felt that he was far too undertapped...and this performance prooves that he is more that just na action star and needs to be taken much more seriously...I would have liked to him take home an oscar nod for this.  The film revolves around Cole (Osment) and his ability to see dead people.  Crowe (Willis) is a child psyciatris who is trying to help Cole come to terms with his gifts.  It is truly touching as Crowe helps Cole find ways to make the ghost go away.

The people at Touchstone decided to market this as a scary movie hoping to cash in at Halloween, if it had the legs to make it that far, and did it ever.  But not for the reasons you might expect.  Sense is a touching story of Cole, a confused young boy who sees ghosts and subsequently turns to a once-renowned psychitrist for help.  Bruce Willis plays the part of Dr. Crowe to subtle perfection (I'll bet you never thought you'd see the word subtle to describe the man who brough us Die Hard and Armageddon).  His disbelief in Cole lingers a little too long, but not long enough to weigh down the film's swift pace.  The pieces start to come together and by the end provide us with a good jolt that will make repeat-viewing a must.

Critics said it had everything anyone could want in a flick, and noone dared to give it anything but five stars. When I saw this from an entertainment standpoint, I could not figure out whether the slow-motion button on my remote was jammed or if &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was an incredibly dull film that moved unbelievably slowly, and ended up nowhere. I eventually realized that the latter of the two answered my question. Yes, it is boring. No, it is not scary or entertaining in any way, shape or form. I would rather drop the gloves with Tie Domi than watch this pile of garbage movie again. But, I didn't hate it just because it was dull. There were plenty of other reasons why this movie is, in my honest opinion, the worst ever. Through the eyes of a critic, here are some mistakes that the critic's didn't catch. First of all, why is Cole a freak? He is only 8 years old and he walks and talks like the common person his age. Does it really make him that weird if he says that people were hung in what is now his elementary school? This is only bizarre if the person claiming it's truth is an adult. No disrepect to young boys like the one Haley Joel Osment portrays, but is it that uncommon for an 8-year old to say irrelevant things like he did? Next, why did he see visions of dead people? There are many twisted psychopath's in our society, but a common 8-year old who never hurt anyone would never have these kinds of hallucinations. In addition, the trailer for &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; always shows the part where Cole tells Bruce Willis that the corpses want him(Cole) to do things for them(deceased). Put plain and simple, NO THEY DON'T! Sometimes, they talk to him, but they never ask or demand him to do one thing. Finally, does an 8-year old really NEED psychological help? No, he does not need help. He may be a slightly pessimistic child, but does he really need psychological assistance? NO. After the movie is over, ask yourself, did Bruce Willis do anything to help Cole? What I'm saying is that Bruce Willis' character isn't even needed at all for this motion picture. WHAT IS HE, A SIDEKICK? Some of the reviews on Amazon just warn you that a movie is bad and advise you to avoid it. But, I wanted to provide a good explanation as to why I hated &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.

Night Shamayalan's brilliance as a producer, director, and writer.  He incorporated one of his childhood fantasies into &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and added some of his own ideas giving it a brilliant storyline.  The symbolisms(ex. the color red) give it that added uniqueness.  Shamayalan proves that he'll become the next Steven Spielberg someday.Haley Joel Osment deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role of Cole Sear.  He expresses Sear's fears and trials much better than most other 11-year old actors are capable.  This powerful performance excites many to discover his performances while he's growing up and as an adult.The rest of the cast is amazing: Toni Collette, Bruce Willis, Trevor Morgan, Olivia Williams, etc.  Everybody, including Osment, has that special chemistry amongst one another.  They provoke their emotions into their audience.  When a character fears, the audience fears.  When a character rages, the audience rages.  These define the meaning of &quot;The Sixth Sense's&quot; storyline and environment.  They force the audience think about the story elements rather than revealing them bluntly.

The film is augmented by the eerie camerawork of Tak Fujimoto that give locations in Philadelphia that I'm familiar with a creepy feel that I otherwise would not attribute to them.  Bruce Willis has never been better as Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who is recovering from physical as well as psychological wounds.  Haley Joel Osment is a complete revelation as Cole Sear, a troubled youth suffering from the recent divorce of his parents and visions that are inhabiting his imagination.  Toni Collette gives a heatbreaking turn as Cole's mother.  Olivia Williams is also effective as Crowe's wife who he feels distant from because of recent events.  This film is, of course, remembered primarily for it's twist ending which I will not divulge here for the few who haven't seen this film.  This film is so effective that it would work even without it.  In my mind I think Shyamalan was spoiled by the success of this film.  In subsequent films he has has been trying to capture lightning in a jar by succumbing to audience expectations only to disappoint to some degree.  He should realize that what made ""The Sixth Sense"" such a success was good story and good characterization.  He seems to be writing the endings first and then building the story around it.  He should be writing good stories and the endings will come naturally.",5,Suspense Classic,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,1731,"['films', 'are', 'just', 'blessed', 'conception', 'finished', 'product', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'one', 'films', 'Everything', 'just', 'perfection', 'here', 'direction', 'scripting', 'casting', 'technical', 'attributes', 'Director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'totally', 'game', 'film', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'psychological', 'level', 'also', 'supernatural', 'one', 'film', 'augmented', 'eerie', 'camerawork', 'Tak', 'Fujimoto', 'give', 'locations', 'Philadelphia', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'creepy', 'feel', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'attribute', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'child', 'psychologist', 'who', 'recovering', 'physical', 'as', 'well', 'psychological', 'wounds', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'complete', 'revelation', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'troubled', 'youth', 'suffering', 'recent', 'divorce', 'parents', 'visions', 'are', 'inhabiting', 'imagination', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'heatbreaking', 'turn', 'Cole', 'mother', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'also', 'effective', 'Crowe', 'wife', 'who', 'distant', 'recent', 'events', 'film', 'course', 'remembered', 'primarily', 'twist', 'ending', 'will', 'not', 'divulge', 'here', 'few', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'film', 'so', 'effective', 'would', 'work', 'even', 'mind', 'think', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'spoiled', 'success', 'film', 'subsequent', 'films', 'been', 'trying', 'capture', 'lightning', 'jar', 'succumbing', 'audience', 'expectations', 'only', 'disappoint', 'degree', 'should', 'realize', 'what', 'made', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'success', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'characterization', 'be', 'writing', 'endings', 'first', 'then', 'building', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'writing', 'good', 'stories', 'endings', 'will', 'come', 'naturally']",The Sixth Sense VHS

Rare, to say the least. At the heart of this exceptional film is a moving performance by Hollywood action star Bruce Willis (of all people) as a child psychologist trying to help a young boy who seems to be haunted by visions of ghosts. The film unfolds slowly, picking up pace after a half an hour or so and then seems to end all too quickly, with a surprise twist at then end that will leave your jaw hanging on the floor. What director M. Night Shyamalan has done here is nothing short of amazing. An involving, emotional, and frightening film that recalls the days when vile special effects were not needed to terrify the audience. Instead, Shyamalan juxtaposes between subtle visual suggestion and bold, striking images to constantly calm and then shock the viewer and it's a strategy that works beautifully. I have never been so frightened by the turning of a doorknob as I have been during this film. But as terrifying as it is, THE SIXTH SENSE is also a film about loss and redemption and love and it will easily move you to tears. Haley Joel Osment is superb in the role of Cole Sear, the small child haunted for reasons he doesn't fully understand. Child stars like this don't come along very often and here he gives a performance that is both heartbreaking and assuring. His growth in both character and understanding during the course of the movie never seems 'acted'... it is such a strong performance that we believe every word he says even when the characters on the screen beside him don't. He is remarkable. As is Toni Collette as his hard-working mother, a woman at a loss to explain what's happening to her son. But the key performance in the film, the one that sets the story down it's unforgettable path comes from a most unlikely source: ex- New Kids On The Block singer Donnie Wahlberg, who lost a lot of weight to play a bitter and terrified ex-patient of Willis's. It is an amazing bit of acting that not only sets up the story but also defines it.

Despite his age, he managed to act(well, I have to say)extremely well. I kind a amazed by the way he acted. He is so cool and he managed to express his inner feelings, thus making the cold and solemn situation appears in the entire movie. He makes me started to think, how a little kid like him can act so WELL and so REAL? I've never came across any kid that can perform that good and I never expect such excellent perfomence from him. He indeed has very good talent in acting(he's just 11 years old). But still, I must say that the whole story is a little boring and not much intense situation appears in it. Although I said it is quite boring, but there is one part in the movie that I feel is interesting. It is the ending which is a big twist to the entire story.

Packing in big crowds and delivering a thrilling a suspenseful  joyride of excitement and talent, director Shyamalan's film is one that  will not soon be forgotten. The story centers on a child psychologist  (Willis) and his mission to help a small child (Osment) that is plagued by  ghostly apparitions. Only they arent' apparitions; they are reality. I  shall stop here, for going on will ruin the rest of this masterpiece. The  ending is, by far, Hollywood's most brilliantly conceived ending to date,  and the suspense leading up to it is well worth the wait. The performances  between Willis and Osment are astounding, and their chemistry as  patient-doctor is well-received by viewers. The chemistry between Toni  Collette and Osment as mother-son was perceived brilliantly by the  director, who also wrote the screenplay. Cinematography and camera moves  each have significant accentuation that set them apart from one another.

Mok,"[2, 2]","The Sixth Sense starts off with a very dreary, almost purely expository scene that screams out to the audience who the main character is, what's his situation, and what his relationship to his wife is.  When I saw that  scene, I started preparing myself for a movie lacking in slyness, subtlety,  and pacing.I'm glad to say my initial perception was wrong.  Once Haley  Joel Osment enters the picture; once Bruce Willis' character starts on his  course; once the tension sets in, The Sixth Sense begins to pack a wallop.  The gold-standard performances from the three top-billed actors Willis,  Osment and Toni Collette are already enough to make the film dramatically  involving, all three holding back on overemoting and opting for strength  and nuance.  The script is hypnotic, the camerawork carefully considered,  and the final suckerpunch one of the best in cinematic history.  Once you  see it, you can think back and realize how difficult it must've been to set  it up, how many restrictions that placed on scenes involving the  protagonist, and how well it worked.Finally, the greatest triumph of The  Sixth Sense is to bring the supernatural horrors so close to home that they  become normalized.  Osment's reactions to his visions are so real that even  though the film draws from the well of the supernatural thriller, a genre  that's becoming increasingly dated, none of the impact is lost.Another  lesson to the new horror filmmakers who use Scream and Urban Legend as  standards for horror:  It's never &quot;who&quot; did what that terrifies,  but &quot;how&quot;; it's not gore, torture, loud music, car crashes and  weird-shaped weapons, but atmosphere and character identification.",5,A true rarity:  A deserving blockbuster.,954806400,"04 4, 2000",2000,1700,"['Sixth', 'Sense', 'very', 'dreary', 'almost', 'purely', 'expository', 'scene', 'out', 'audience', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'what', 'situation', 'what', 'relationship', 'wife', 'When', 'saw', 'scene', 'started', 'preparing', 'movie', 'lacking', 'slyness', 'subtlety', 'pacing.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'initial', 'perception', 'was', 'wrong', 'Once', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'picture', 'once', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'character', 'course', 'once', 'tension', 'sets', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'pack', 'wallop', 'gold-standard', 'performances', 'three', 'top-billed', 'actors', 'Willis', 'Osment', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'are', 'already', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'dramatically', 'involving', 'three', 'holding', 'back', 'overemoting', 'opting', 'strength', 'nuance', 'script', 'hypnotic', 'camerawork', 'carefully', 'considered', 'final', 'suckerpunch', 'one', 'best', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Once', 'see', 'can', 'think', 'back', 'realize', 'how', 'difficult', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'set', 'up', 'how', 'many', 'restrictions', 'placed', 'scenes', 'involving', 'protagonist', 'how', 'well', 'worked.Finally', 'greatest', 'triumph', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'bring', 'supernatural', 'horrors', 'so', 'close', 'home', 'become', 'normalized', 'Osment', 'reactions', 'visions', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'even', 'film', 'draws', 'well', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'genre', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'dated', 'none', 'impact', 'lost.Another', 'lesson', 'new', 'horror', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'use', 'Scream', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'standards', 'horror', 'never', 'quot', 'who', 'quot', 'did', 'what', 'terrifies', 'quot', 'how', 'quot', 'not', 'gore', 'torture', 'loud', 'music', 'car', 'crashes', 'weird-shaped', 'weapons', 'atmosphere', 'character', 'identification']",The Sixth Sense VHS

Night Shyamalan, which he wrote and plays the part of Dr. Hill, a psychiatrist, is a timely masterpiece.  The late 90's was a time for increased and renewed spiritually.  Many individuals were and are still seeking answers to what happens after we die.  Shyamalan was born in India where belief in reincarnation is very strong.  While he was born in India he grew up in the United States in Philadelphia.  There is a quality of ""other world ness"" or ""wholly unknown"" that he brings to the screen.  What some have only imagined or ""wholly sensed"" he brings to life on film.  His works include Signs (2002) and currently he is in post production of The Village (2004).  What he and fellow director Jerry Zucker (Ghost, 1990) both portray through the genres of drama, mystery, and thriller is: Unfinished business keeps you around after you die.Unfinished business is what keeps Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist around for a while.  Despite the fact that his grieving wife has not been able to let him completely go- she plays home movies to keep him close, for a while.  Individuals do sense sometimes their loved ones who have passed on are right beside them.  This could be in the role of protector, as in Ghost, where Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) tries to protect his girlfriend Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) from harm, or as a guardian angel.  One theme within both films is that of coming to terms with oneself and to be at peace.  This was accomplished for Sam when he was able to communicate his message through Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), thus saving Molly from certain death.  In The Sixth Sense Crowe feels guilty about not being able to help is de-ranged ex-client.  To do penance for that he tries to help, and succeeds in doing so, Cole.  Cole for his part learns to face his fears, and works with his gift instead of against it.  He helps the dead girl communicate a message to her father about her death.  Through the process Crowe walks with Cole, afterwards he is able to let go, but first he whispers into his wife's ear how much he loves her.What makes this film and others like it so interesting is that our society has within it a sub-culture of those who believe in the supernatural.  The popularity of Crossing Over with Jonathan Edwards attests to this fact, as well as It's a Miracle.  People want answers and will go to almost any length to get them.  Many individuals have testified that they have either sensed or seen deceased family members at one time or another.  The Sixth Sense is a great film for those of us with imagination and also for those without imagination.",5,Un-Finished Business,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,2653,"['Sixth', 'SenseThe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '1997', 'directed', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'wrote', 'part', 'Dr.', 'Hill', 'psychiatrist', 'timely', 'masterpiece', 'late', '90', 'was', 'time', 'increased', 'renewed', 'spiritually', 'Many', 'individuals', 'were', 'are', 'still', 'seeking', 'answers', 'what', 'die', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'born', 'India', 'where', 'belief', 'reincarnation', 'very', 'strong', 'was', 'born', 'India', 'grew', 'up', 'United', 'States', 'Philadelphia', 'quality', 'other', 'world', 'ness', 'wholly', 'unknown', 'screen', 'What', 'have', 'only', 'imagined', 'wholly', 'sensed', 'life', 'film', 'works', 'include', 'Signs', '2002', 'currently', 'post', 'production', 'Village', '2004', 'What', 'fellow', 'director', 'Jerry', 'Zucker', 'Ghost', '1990', 'portray', 'genres', 'drama', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'Unfinished', 'business', 'keeps', 'around', 'die.Unfinished', 'business', 'what', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'child', 'psychologist', 'while', 'fact', 'grieving', 'wife', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'let', 'completely', 'go-', 'home', 'movies', 'keep', 'close', 'while', 'Individuals', 'do', 'sense', 'sometimes', 'loved', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'passed', 'are', 'right', 'could', 'be', 'role', 'protector', 'Ghost', 'where', 'Sam', 'Wheat', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'protect', 'girlfriend', 'Molly', 'Jensen', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'harm', 'guardian', 'angel', 'One', 'theme', 'films', 'coming', 'terms', 'oneself', 'be', 'peace', 'was', 'accomplished', 'Sam', 'when', 'was', 'able', 'communicate', 'message', 'Oda', 'Mae', 'Brown', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'thus', 'saving', 'Molly', 'certain', 'death', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Crowe', 'feels', 'guilty', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'help', 'de-ranged', 'ex-client', 'do', 'penance', 'help', 'doing', 'so', 'Cole', 'Cole', 'part', 'face', 'fears', 'gift', 'instead', 'dead', 'girl', 'communicate', 'message', 'father', 'death', 'process', 'Crowe', 'walks', 'Cole', 'able', 'let', 'go', 'first', 'wife', 'ear', 'how', 'much', 'her.What', 'film', 'others', 'so', 'interesting', 'society', 'sub-culture', 'who', 'believe', 'supernatural', 'popularity', 'Crossing', 'Jonathan', 'Edwards', 'fact', 'as', 'well', 'Miracle', 'People', 'want', 'answers', 'will', 'go', 'almost', 'length', 'get', 'Many', 'individuals', 'have', 'testified', 'have', 'sensed', 'seen', 'deceased', 'family', 'members', 'one', 'time', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'great', 'film', 'imagination', 'also', 'imagination']",The Sixth Sense VHS

If so, I'll be very anxious to see what comes next from this talented person.  As far as ""The Sixth Sense"", like most people it caught me, held me, riveted me to  my seat, then surprised the heck out of me.  This is one of those rare  films that, after the ending credits, I wanted to immediately purchase  another ticket and view it again from a different perspective...to see what  I missed and why I didn't catch on as the film progressed (""The Usual  Suspects"" was another film that captured me in the same way).Although  several people didn't care for this movie, and thought it was overhyped and  that Haley Joel Osment overacted (ala a young Ricky Schroeder in  ""Earthling""), I came away with the opposite reaction...and hey, I liked the  ""Earthling"".  However, I can relate to those who didn't like it.  I've  viewed many films that have been highly praised, but left me cold (some of  these films I've viewed again after many years and was surprised to find  out that they were much, much better--or worse--than what I remembered.  I  believe ones' sense of liking or disliking anything depends upon  expectation and what mood he or she is in at the time).  With that said, I  thought ""The Sixth Sense"" did live up to its hype, and was amazed at the  performance of not only Osment, but also Bruce Willis' surprising,  understated performance.  I also enjoyed how the movie sent  honest-to-goodness chills through me, and without the use of gory ""slasher""  scenes that try to shock the audience with its violence.While I don't  believe this is a great film in the ""classic"" sense, I do think that it is  the type of movie that can enlist impromptu discussion around the  proverbial water cooler (ala ""Fargo"").

474629,A84UFSF2SZS2W,630573240X,"EriKa ""E""","[1, 8]","Was this film a surprise? Was the ending a surprise really? Personally I felt, as I watched the film, that there was something missing. Certainly a real dialogue between all other characters but Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis was missing, but that was not blatantly obvious. Willis's oblivious behaviour toward his wife also left some unanswered questions. How is it that he could really not know he was dead if there were all these things going on in his wife's life that he knew nothing about? (She was taking antidepressants, was starting to see other people)? I suppose it is possible to be living with someone who becomes virtually a stranger to you as circumstances change. However, the most obvious problem was simply that there was no real segu&eacute; into his life after he had been shot. We see no ambulances, no recovery, nothing. This always makes me suspicious. We just see him lying there bleeding, and the next thing we know he is meeting a little boy. How would he have time, after all, to devote all this time to one case if he were indeed alive? Also Haley Joel Osment probably does not choose to tell Willis he sees dead people because Willis is his counselor but because Willis manages to make contact and communicate with him, unlike all the other dead people who have just scared him.  I guess I felt prepared for the ending only because I have seen similar things. For example, in Jacob's Ladder, with Tim Robbins, his character hallucinates an entire life after Vietnam, but it turns out that he never left Vietnam. He died in combat. Granted, The Sixth Sense was superior with its story, its stylistics and its suspense. Perhaps it appears that I am complaining, but far from it. Willis's performance was understated and skillful. I am not a fan of Haley Joel Osment, but his performance was commendable, particularly for someone of his age. I was highly impressed also with Australian actress Toni Collette as Osment's frustrated but loving and protective mother. The Sixth Sense had clues in it, but it was not clear-cut. It was not obvious how it would end. It was well crafted, suspenseful, and completely unexpected in the cinema when it appeared... unexpected but welcome.",4,EERIE,1004832000,"11 4, 2001",2001,2208,"['Was', 'film', 'surprise', 'Was', 'ending', 'surprise', 'really', 'Personally', 'felt', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'Certainly', 'real', 'dialogue', 'other', 'characters', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'not', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'Willis', 'oblivious', 'behaviour', 'wife', 'also', 'left', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'How', 'could', 'really', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'dead', 'were', 'things', 'going', 'wife', 'life', 'knew', 'nothing', 'was', 'taking', 'antidepressants', 'was', 'starting', 'see', 'other', 'people', 'suppose', 'possible', 'be', 'living', 'someone', 'who', 'virtually', 'stranger', 'circumstances', 'change', 'However', 'most', 'obvious', 'problem', 'was', 'simply', 'was', 'real', 'segu', 'eacute', 'life', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'see', 'ambulances', 'recovery', 'nothing', 'always', 'suspicious', 'just', 'see', 'lying', 'there', 'bleeding', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'meeting', 'little', 'boy', 'How', 'would', 'have', 'time', 'devote', 'time', 'one', 'case', 'were', 'indeed', 'alive', 'Also', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'probably', 'not', 'choose', 'tell', 'Willis', 'dead', 'people', 'Willis', 'counselor', 'Willis', 'make', 'contact', 'communicate', 'other', 'dead', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'scared', 'guess', 'felt', 'prepared', 'ending', 'only', 'have', 'seen', 'similar', 'things', 'example', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'entire', 'life', 'Vietnam', 'out', 'never', 'left', 'Vietnam', 'died', 'combat', 'Granted', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'superior', 'story', 'stylistics', 'suspense', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'complaining', 'far', 'Willis', 'performance', 'was', 'understated', 'skillful', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'performance', 'was', 'commendable', 'particularly', 'someone', 'age', 'was', 'highly', 'impressed', 'also', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Osment', 'frustrated', 'loving', 'protective', 'mother', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'had', 'clues', 'was', 'not', 'clear-cut', 'was', 'not', 'obvious', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'was', 'well', 'crafted', 'suspenseful', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'cinema', 'when', 'appeared', 'unexpected', 'welcome']",The Sixth Sense VHS
474630,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,630573240X,Erik North,"[5, 6]","In my humble opinion, THE SIXTH SENSE was the last great horror movie of the cinema in the 20th century.I say this for a number of reasons.  First of all, writer/director M. Night Shayamalan must be credited with having made a horror film that is genuinely frightening and unsettling without resorting to undue blood, gore, or nudity (thus the 'PG-13' rating).  Second, his handling of the relationship between psychologist Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) and the troubled boy Cole Seer (Haley Joel Osment) is one of the more psychologically satistfying things I've seen in the cinema in years.  Third, and last (but not least), is the twist ending that occurs--and, contrary to what anyone else might believe, I did NOT see it coming.  This twist is perhaps the greatest sting-in-the-tail ending the cinema had seen since the coda of the original PLANET OF THE APES in 1968.  I have the feeling that Rod Serling, no stranger to sting-in-the-tail endings (see &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and APES), would have found a lot to admire about THE SIXTH SENSE.Shayamalan weaves elements of such great horror movies as CARRIE, THE SHINING, and POLTERGEIST into his film; and yet, THE SIXTH SENSE does not seem too terribly derivative--it's paying homage.

There were no cheap gimmicks or shortcuts taken and there was a lot of attention to the details of each scene.If you're like me, then the ending of the movie came as a surprise. It was not as surprising as the ending to Perfect Blue, but suspenseful nonetheless.Perhaps the best part is the fact that this is really a movie that screams to be watched twice, just so you can go back and scrutinize every scene and detail to see what you missed.

474637,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,630573240X,F. Gentile,"[0, 0]","There's a zillion reviews of this film, & every opinion has been expressed (except MINE !) So, here goes. I felt this was one of the better movies I've seen in a long, long time. It is rare to find a ""scary"" movie that actually does just that. That's because it takes psychological manipulation of an audience, not just screeching jumping creatures or oodles of blood. This is a unique story, uniquely told. Many films promise a ""twist"", that'll  ""knock you off your feet""...etc, and you usually end up saying ""THAT""S the big surprise ??"" (Like you didn't know immediatley that the character in ""The Crying Game"" was really a man... HELLO ???) But, I must say, this film really delivers. I am, admittedly, usually prejudiced (sometimes unfairly so) against newer flicks as, they are more often than not, dissapointments. This film took me totally by surprise. Not only is the acting great, but the subtle unfolding of the story has just the right pacing and rhythym  to make the hairs stand up on your neck. Haley Joel Osmet is a wonder as ""Cole"", the little boy being tortured by his secret. His performance is the main reason this film is so credible. And, though I always felt that Bruce Willis had a quality that made him stand out above most of his contemporaries, his performance in this film, as the psychologist who seems to need to help himself through helping this troubled little boy,  is filled with depth, he is simply terrific. And I found the actress who played ""Coles"" mom, to be very effective at portraying the stressed out single mom, who needs two jobs to support her son, doesn't know how to help her little boy,  (and, has bad taste in clothes.) While I did figure out the ""twist"" of the film about half way through, it wasn't because I'm so brilliant. It was because of something that the little boy said, that I was really just half listening to, but it struck me a moment later, when I said out loud in the theater ""I know what the secret is !!"", whereupon my companion told me to shut the hell up. I've just watched this film again, and it is just as powerful, moving, and chilling as on the first viewing. The fact that you know the plot twist from the initial viewing in no way takes away from the feeling of having had the rug pulled out from under you. People get different reactions from the same film, that's what makes an ""opinion"" an opinion. But I'm not one of those who says things like ""that film you just saw was in actuality NOT about Becky Sues & Billy Bobs tumultuous love life, in reality, that was a metaphor for the Arab-Israeli conflict..."" Call me shallow, but I like to be swept up in the experience of what I'm actually seeing. This film totally succeeds, not only in entertaining you, but in making you think, scaring the heck out of you, and moving you emotionally. Several films tried to incorporate the special plot twist that this film originated, but, for me, they fell flat. (See: (or don't) ""The Others"".) I feel this film, with its deft direction, and fine cast,  will stand the test of time, and become a classic.

My sentiments lie with neither camp. This is a fascinating and clever story that is well  filmed but poorly crafted. Plot holes abound and Director/Writer M. Night  Shyamalan has to fudge all over the place to keep the surprise ending a  surprise. In my comments here, I have commented many times on the dangers  of writers directing their own work. In almost every case, the director  lacks the necessary objectivity to identify and excise plot flaws. In this  case they were glaring.So, I have a fundamental problem calling this a  great motion picture. However, it was very well filmed from a technical  standpoint and produced some excellent suspense throughout that kept the  viewer engaged.The acting was fair to excellent. Toni Collette was  mediocre at best as Cole's mother. She overacted in almost every scene and  her chemistry wasn't very good with the boy until the last scene when he  told her what her mother said. Likewise, Olivia Williams didn't bowl me  over as Malcolm's wife.Bruce Willis gave a good performance, but he is  out of his element playing the sensitive and self doubting type. He always  comes across as a bit whiny when he tries to play nice guy parts. His forte  is playing the tough, strong courageous type and he would best serve his  career by staying with those types of parts.Finally, there is young  Haley Joel Osment as Cole. He gave an excellent performance and was the  linchpin that held the whole film together. He was very versatile in his  portrayal of various emotions.

474642,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,630573240X,Frederick Baptist,"[4, 4]","This is one of my all-time favourite movies for a number of reasons and it's nice to see that even after a decade, this film ages so well and is still fun to watch.  I watched ""Silence of the Lambs"" again recently and it hasn't aged as well for me.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is more than just a scary movie as it has themes of redemption in trying to make things right, the difficulty of single parenthood and the tremendous impact it has on the innocent child's life both then and in the future and of course the obvious life after death/spirit world issues.  The unexpected twist is a key reason for what makes this film work so well and yet unlike ""Silence ..."" even when you know the ending, the excellent treatment of the various other themes mentioned earlier makes it still watchable.  With ""Silence ..."" I get the feeling I already know the final score of the basketball game and so a massive amount of future enjoyment value is lost with repeated viewings.  Each time I watch ""The Sixth Sense"" though, I still find myself rediscovering elements that I'd somehow missed earlier.  This film like a true classic rewards repeated viewings very well.This Collector's Edition dvd is also a treat as it comes in very good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound quality and the picture quality is for the most part very good.  The Special Features includes very good making-of documentary, deleted scenes and interviews with the cast and especially with the director/screenwriter himself.  As far as standard format discs go this is very good and it only makes me wonder how much better the Blu-ray version can possibly be.  Just like the child character in the film, the inability of adults to take the insights of children seriously enough is the only way I can explain why Haley Joel Osment didn't get the best actor Oscar for his performance here.  I guess he's just too young for the academy to take him seriously?  Bruce Willis has done some of his best work on this film too.  Classic films like this are a one off and it's unlikely M.

474646,AY12DBB0U420B,630573240X,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Sixth Sense"" (Collector's Edition Series DVD - 1999) starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment. It's the story of a troubled little boy (Osment) and his psychologist (Willis). It's a bit of a creepy and suspenseful movie, if you can get caught up in the story. Try, it's worth it. Personally, I have a lot of problems with stories that go into such subjects as ghosts, seeing the dead and most things having to do with the supernatural and sixth senses. Okay, having said this, I still find ""The Sixth Sense"" to be an engaging and interesting movie. Here and there it's startling and, here and there it has great emotional impact. It's the kind of movie that makes me wish I could drift off into the supernatural realm as so many other people are freely able to  do.The movie is very well done in every way. Actor Osment is convincing as a troubled little boy. He comes across as real, not some talented child actor. Willis is excellent also, but I have come to expect that of him. I might add that it's  good to see him in a PG-rated movie now and then. All of the supporting cast are excellent. The direction, the filming, the musical background and everything else is first rate and I couldn't help but wondering if the movie hadn't received any awards, but I haven't looked it up. No matter, it just caused me to wonder. The movie lost me again and again because of my inability to go along with the supernatural explanations, but then if repeatedly grabbed me back and the somewhat surprising  ending shook me up. It was an engaging, thought provoking and even somewhat thrilling movie. Relax and enjoy it, if you can.Gary Peterson",5,"Very Well Done Movie.

474648,A31O7B59DW7OHR,630573240X,Gene Bromberg,"[1, 2]","Why don't they make good scary movies anymore? Sure, there have been a few  great horror/suspense movies made in the last 10 years or so, but they've  been buried underneath a mass of horrible movies that passed themselves off  as scary. I blame the special effects people. They've gotten so good at  mimicking dismemberment and other nasty things that filmmakers have forgone  suspense for the slaughterhouse. They forget that suspense and terror are  created as much in the mind of the viewer as on the screen. These movies  don't let us think, probably because they don't trust us to.&quot;The  Sixth Sense&quot; is a movie that lets us exercise the 'ol bean while  getting good and scared in the bargain. The plot is so well-known that it  needs little description. A psychiatrist (Willis) treats a young boy  (Osment) who, as the films signature line states, &quot;sees dead  people&quot;. What to do with such a child, who otherwise seems normal,  intelligent, and aware that what's he's saying makes no sense to anyone.  What to do except believe him?It's odd to call a scary suspense movie a  kind movie, but this movie is not, ultimately, about horror. It's about  horrible things, but it's actually a kind, quiet movie, which I think is a  big part of its appeal. That and the surprise ending, of course. Much has  been made of the huge plot twist at the end that had people going to see it  3 or 4 times, just so they could see the movie knowing what the ending was.  I can see why. I won't spoil it by telling you what it is, of course, but I  will say with some smugness that I figured it out with about 30 minutes  left. But...I'll admit that if I hadn't read in reviews that there WAS a big  twist at the end, I never would've guessed it. It is simple and perfect and  absolutely necessary for the film to end as it must.The acting is as  spare and quiet and excellent as the film deserves. I don't know who Bruce  Willis' agent is, but if his client is capable of this kind of work than  why does he end up in all those crappy movies year after year. And Osment  was definitely deserving of his Oscar nomination. So many child actors try  to act like little adults, or they act like ridiculous cartoon kids. Osment  shows the quicksilver intelligence as well as the vulnerability of children  with astonishing skill. The last scene he appears in, when he and Willis  say goodbye, is exceptional, the more so after a second viewing.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is the biggest grossing suspense movie of  all time, so maybe there's hope for we filmgoers after all.

Just before the end of the story I was very frustrated feeling that the Director had cheated on the mystery of the story, until it did actually end, then of course it was ""Oh, I see!"", my wife who left at the beginning to call the kids at home was very angry, and feeling cheated until I explained it to her.Later when we got to see this on DVD and saw the extra features that let you see how the director not only didn't cheat you, but gave a clue in every scene, I almost felt dumb for not getting it in the first place.Now, I would like to address some of the other criticism leveled at this film; specifically that only Cole's character is three dimensional. The story is Cole's story; the other major characters are unaware of anything that is going on in Cole's story, so for them to be full fleshed as it were would take away from the actual story line, and take you away from the destination of the plot.Now one last thing, I am glad that I saw the screen version first, to have the gotcha moment in the end, but I do prefer the longest directors cut for all subsequent viewings, and we in my house have watched it many times.",5,Why I love this movie,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,1342,"['saw', 'originally', 'movies', 'was', 'amazed', 'incredibly', 'believable', 'performance', 'young', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'who', 'child', 'terrified', 'too', 'long', 'verge', 'losing', 'fragile', 'young', 'mind', 'Just', 'end', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'frustrated', 'feeling', 'Director', 'had', 'cheated', 'mystery', 'story', 'did', 'actually', 'end', 'then', 'course', 'was', 'Oh', 'see', 'wife', 'who', 'left', 'beginning', 'call', 'kids', 'home', 'was', 'very', 'angry', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'explained', 'her.Later', 'when', 'got', 'see', 'DVD', 'saw', 'extra', 'features', 'let', 'see', 'how', 'director', 'not', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'gave', 'clue', 'scene', 'almost', 'felt', 'dumb', 'not', 'getting', 'first', 'place.Now', 'would', 'like', 'address', 'other', 'criticism', 'leveled', 'film', 'specifically', 'only', 'Cole', 'character', 'three', 'dimensional', 'story', 'Cole', 'story', 'other', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'unaware', 'anything', 'going', 'Cole', 'story', 'so', 'be', 'full', 'fleshed', 'were', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'actual', 'story', 'line', 'take', 'away', 'destination', 'plot.Now', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'am', 'glad', 'saw', 'screen', 'version', 'first', 'have', 'gotcha', 'moment', 'end', 'do', 'prefer', 'longest', 'directors', 'cut', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'house', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'times']",The Sixth Sense VHS

474661,A3S738GO35SH0W,630573240X,Greg Hughes,"[14, 18]","My sister took me to see &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; last November. At first I had no idea of what the film was about, or even that it was a horror film until we went into the cinema. That was when I was told it was  about a boy who could see dead people. Without exaggeration,this was the  first time a film actually made the back of my neck tingle.A  nine-year-old boy named Cole attracts the attention of Malcolm Crowe, a  child therapist played by Bruce Willis. Malcolm is drawn to this boy  because he reminds him of one of his old patients - a patient who was  driven to breaking point and committed suicide.Cole tells Malcolm the  same things as the old patient. He is able to see, hear and speak to dead  people.This story initially made me think of Stephen King's novel  &quot;The Shining&quot;, which was also about a young boy who had visions.  &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a bit more intense. At completely unexpected  moments &quot;visitors&quot; come and go, sometimes silent, at other times  taunting and malicious. Naturally, trying to talk about this to other  people would have them thinking Cole  was either lying or disturbed. The  only person Cole can turn to is Malcolm.It makes you wonder how common  Cole's &quot;sixth sense&quot; really is. Is it a gift or a curse? Were so  many other people who were labelled as &quot;schizophrenic&quot; really  just people like Cole who couldn't make others believe them? These are some  of the film's little subtleties.Horror films work best when there is  little gore to be seen. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is one of them. Music  seems to work better, especially when there are only fleeting glances of  the ghosts.

The ending is surprising and very unpredictable. It actually is quite scary and I remember looking under my bed the first time I saw it.

Understand, I'm not one of those who have made a hobby out of belittling the man's career.  On the contrary, I feel the guy has proven he has decent  acting chops, despite his pedigree as an action hero.  Still, when a friend  explained the plot of this movie, and Willis's part in it, my reaction was,  &quot;Aw, c'mon.&quot;  I just didn't think ol' Bruce could carry off the  part of a sincere, angst-ridden child psychologist.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  His understated, rock-steady performance was surely a cornerstone of the  film's success.That said, the cocky, sarcastic public persona that Bruce  Willis often puts forth serves to put the viewer on edge a bit: Will we see  a flicker of some &quot;Die Hard&quot; mannerism?  That, in itself, makes  the choice of Willis nothing less than brilliant casting, as that slightly  distracting element helps set the viewer up for later surprises.Some  critics have ridiculed the film for being overly sentimental.  Hm.  I just  didn't get that at all.  If anything, I found the sentimentality a bit  understated, given the story line.As for Haley Joel Osment, wow, the kid  is so talented it's scary.

474677,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,630573240X,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[4, 12]","I see a vastly overrated movie called ""The Sixth Sense"" as far as its merits as a horror movie are concerned.  Sure, this is an almost halfway decent psychological thriller with a chill or two, but this movie simply does not have the ""goods"" or the requisite structure to be called a pure and effective horror movie.""The Sixth Sense"" is about a gifted child who has a ""sixth sense"" which allows him to actually see ghosts and dead people...to the child it is a depressing and horrifying burden that he does not want nor understand.  A psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis is determined to help the boy, but actually finds out something quite dark about his own reality as opposed to that of the child...this part ends up overshadowing the entire movie and weakening it as a whole.Clearly, the best scenes of the movie from a horror movie fan's perspective are the apparitions and visions of dead people the little boy encounters, however, these scenes are relatively few and far between.  Probably the scariest scene (if you can even call it that) is the part where the boy sees the lady ghost in a robe who is quite creepy...the boy hides from her as the chilly air is certainly symbolic of the creepy scene from that part.However, aside from these images of dead people and ghosts, ""The Sixth Sense"" is basically without a villain...there is no source of evil or danger that the characters encounter in this flick.  As far as its merits as a horror movie is concerned, ""The Sixth Sense"" is like a snow that won't stick because it's not cold enough or a cloud that wants to pour rain but can't because it lacks the necessary moisture from which the rain can be produced...such is the same thing for ""The Sixth Sense"" as a horror movie.  The atmosphere necessary for a horror movie is present only when the audience sees the deathly images from the boy's perspective, but this simply is not enough to create a horror movie...nice psychological drama with metaphysical elements which are creepy, but no hard and fast substance from which a horror movie can be derived.However, it could certainly be argued that ""The Sixth Sense"" was not made for the purpose of being a horror movie and that may very well be true.  But, as a horror movie, this movie fails miserably and completely.  I thought that ""The Sixth Sense"" was a mildly entertaining movie that illustrates a connection between the psyche of possibly blessed individuals with the supernatural and metaphysical reality we all so long to understand, but as a horror movie, ""The Sixth Sense"" basically sucks.  I would attach a VERY WEAK AMAZON.com TWO STARS rating to this movie...in fact, my official rating is 1.75 STARS because it really isn't that good, period.Incidentally, the idea of this sixth sense and psychic connection with the supernatural was done before and much better I might add in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" which IS very scary and a timeless classic...I highly recommend ""The Shining"" over ""The Sixth Sense"" if you are interested in this psychic subject matter within the framework of a real horror movie.  In short, ""The Sixth Sense"" is a below average to average psychological-thriller movie overall and a very poor excuse for a horror movie.",2,"1.5 STARS: I see a vastly overrated so-called ""horror movie"" named ""The Sixth Sense""",1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,3222,"['see', 'vastly', 'overrated', 'movie', 'called', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'as', 'far', 'merits', 'horror', 'movie', 'are', 'concerned', 'Sure', 'almost', 'halfway', 'decent', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'chill', 'two', 'movie', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'goods', 'requisite', 'structure', 'be', 'called', 'pure', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'gifted', 'child', 'who', 'sixth', 'sense', 'actually', 'see', 'ghosts', 'dead', 'people', 'child', 'depressing', 'horrifying', 'burden', 'not', 'want', 'understand', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'determined', 'help', 'boy', 'actually', 'out', 'something', 'quite', 'dark', 'own', 'reality', 'opposed', 'child', 'part', 'up', 'overshadowing', 'entire', 'movie', 'weakening', 'whole.Clearly', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'perspective', 'are', 'apparitions', 'visions', 'dead', 'people', 'little', 'boy', 'encounters', 'however', 'scenes', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'far', 'Probably', 'scariest', 'scene', 'can', 'even', 'call', 'part', 'where', 'boy', 'lady', 'ghost', 'robe', 'who', 'quite', 'creepy', 'boy', 'hides', 'chilly', 'air', 'certainly', 'symbolic', 'creepy', 'scene', 'part.However', 'aside', 'images', 'dead', 'people', 'ghosts', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'basically', 'villain', 'source', 'evil', 'danger', 'characters', 'encounter', 'flick', 'As', 'far', 'merits', 'horror', 'movie', 'concerned', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'snow', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stick', 'not', 'cold', 'enough', 'cloud', 'pour', 'rain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'because', 'necessary', 'moisture', 'rain', 'can', 'be', 'produced', 'such', 'same', 'thing', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'horror', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'necessary', 'horror', 'movie', 'present', 'only', 'when', 'audience', 'deathly', 'images', 'boy', 'perspective', 'simply', 'not', 'enough', 'create', 'horror', 'movie', 'nice', 'psychological', 'drama', 'metaphysical', 'elements', 'are', 'creepy', 'hard', 'fast', 'substance', 'horror', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'derived.However', 'could', 'certainly', 'be', 'argued', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'purpose', 'being', 'horror', 'movie', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'true', 'horror', 'movie', 'movie', 'miserably', 'completely', 'thought', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'connection', 'psyche', 'possibly', 'blessed', 'individuals', 'supernatural', 'metaphysical', 'reality', 'so', 'long', 'understand', 'horror', 'movie', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'basically', 'would', 'attach', 'VERY', 'WEAK', 'AMAZON.com', 'TWO', 'STARS', 'rating', 'movie', 'fact', 'official', 'rating', '1.75', 'STARS', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'period.Incidentally', 'idea', 'sixth', 'sense', 'psychic', 'connection', 'supernatural', 'was', 'done', 'before', 'much', 'better', 'might', 'add', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Shining', 'very', 'scary', 'timeless', 'classic', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Shining', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'are', 'interested', 'psychic', 'subject', 'matter', 'framework', 'real', 'horror', 'movie', 'short', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'below', 'average', 'average', 'psychological-thriller', 'movie', 'overall', 'very', 'poor', 'excuse', 'horror', 'movie']",The Sixth Sense VHS

I watched Mr. Shyamalan's work backwards chronologically: first SIGNS, then UNBREAKABLE, and now THE SIXTH SENSE.  So in a way I approached this movie understanding that the premise - &quot;I see dead people&quot; - is not the theme, but merely a vehicle for the theme (in the same way that the alien invasion of SIGNS was not the theme).This is clearly one of the best pieces of filmmaking to come out of the Hollywood Slums in a long time.  It transcends many of the cliches that have gripped Tinseltown.  Shyamalan's technical brilliance and power of vision are so refreshing.  He is a filmmaker to watch, the only filmmaker since The Master - Hitchcock - to wear the mantle.The performances are stunning.  Willis and Osmet are brilliant together, as is Osmet's mother.  The depth with which they portray their roles is evident in their eyes; each is willing to give the other the space they need to develop their characters, and the director skilfully moves them forward.This film isn't about ghosts, or gothic horror, or the undead, or anything else like that.  It's about forgiveness.  Well, I suppose that's the simple answer.  But, it's a credit to Shymalan's genius that he is able to deal with such deeply human themes in the context of a ghost story, without falling prey to the typical Hollywood cliches (like &quot;Ghost&quot;).Night is becomming one of my favorits directors.

474681,A32GLRK2JC5OXY,630573240X,"HumorousSmile ""J-Biz""","[4, 5]","M. Night Shyamalan's debut as the masterful storyteller/director began with this most mysterious and heartfelt film, The Sixth Sense. The last time I saw The Sixth Sense was over six years ago and it was as though I enjoyed it even more now than I did the first time I saw it in theatres. Shyamalan's script is woven so beautifully and with such great care that the viewer will be yearning to find answers to the many questions this film forces one to develop.The Sixth Sense starts out with a bang (with probably the best performance by Donnie Wahlberg I've ever seen on the big screen) and leaves the audience almost trembling. As the story begins after this shocking introduction, we see Bruce Willis a year later after his career has been somewhat destroyed by the terrible events that occurred a year prior. Willis plays a child psychologist, and begins treatment through brief clinical sessions with a young boy (played memorably by Haley Joel Osment). Osment seems terribly disturbed and Willis appears determined to solve this troubled boy's problems. But as the story begins to unfold and the audience learns of Osment's nightmarish ailment, Willis finds that helping this boy will take far more effort than he could have ever imagined.It is hard to capture the beauty of The Sixth Sense in a few paragraphs, but the simplicity of its execution is enough to show that original films can still grab an audience better than any mind-blowing special effect. The Sixth Sense manages to keep the crowd attentive without a single special effect for almost two hours. This movie is not only a good thriller, but its dramatic elements will sometimes grasp at you without letting you go.An excellent and unforgettable performance by Toni Collette and one of the greatest ghost stories ever told. If you are not a fan of horror, do not fret; this is not a horror film. But there are definitely a few good jumps to be enjoyed. This movie can be seen over and over again and will one day be known as a classic work of film-making. This is by far the most superior M.

But then, I have to remind myself that the film was made by a young filmmaker who grew up watching films like &quot;Poltergeist&quot; and Steven Spielberg kitschathons. Bruce Willis (not one of my favorite performers) was good in the film, nice and understated, and Haley Joel Osment is a talented little boy-although I found his performance not always sympathetic-sometimes downright annoying, especially the &quot;Stuttering Stanley&quot; scene, which reminded me of another annoying child performance-the &quot;Redrum&quot; mishigas from &quot;The Shining&quot; (another overrated, silly film directed by the once-great Stanley Kubrick).

It changes the audience's understanding of the rest of the movie and all they can talk about is why they didn't spot the twist sooner.  Primal Fear had a great twist ending.  Ditto, the Usual Suspects.  Now, add The Sixth Sense to this list.  Notice they all did great at the Box Office.  The lesson to the studios is to put more surprises into their scripts.However, wheras Primal Fear and the Usual Suspects were overshadowed by their shocking revelations, The Sixth Sense will be remembered not so much for it's twist but for it's original story: a boy that sees dead people.  Why hadn't this story been made before?  It seemed so obvious.  It is a child's worst nightmare - being able to see ghosts and not being able to tell anyone about it.The reason a movie like this wasn't made before was because the script required an adult performance from a 10 year old.  Impossible?  No, but it needed a very special kid.  Perhaps there was only one child in 10 million who could have acted in this movie but fortunately, Haley Joel Osment defied the odds and got the part.  He was a revelation.  His performance seems only better when you look at other American child performances.  Often, they can destroy a good movie with their annoying cuteness.  Check out Liar, Liar.Osment was exemplary and honoured for it.  I, for one, thought it unjust that his co-star didn't receive any such accolade.  The performance of Bruce Willis was subtle and underwhelming.  We never expected a surprise, simply because there never seemed anything out of place with this resolutely plain character.  We saw an ordinary child psychiatrist desperate to help one of his patients.  Willis, knew a lot more about the character but never over-emphasised it.  So what, you ask?  Well, Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for the same thing in Suspects.I expect a lot from this director now.  Anytime, a director writes and direct, I question which one he did better.  I can't decide in this case.  His script was marvellous, with very few holes.  But his direction was methodical and moody, creating a very spooky atmosphere.

Reserved, compassionate, slow  and yet at time afraid, afraid of the truth that necessarily comes out of  the child's mouth. And what truth ! Dead people are visiting some living  people in order to ask them to do something, to communicate something to  other living people. They seem to need an intercessor, a go-between. The  child has to be frightened mute and then frantic by such an experience. The  psychiatrist has to enlarge his mind to be able to get this turth in and  then to accept it and then to deal with it, and find out the only thing  that can make the child assume this communication : they try to speak to  you, to give you some message, some message you have to deliver, no matter  how hard it may be, because the welfare of the dead is more important than  the welfare of the living. And yet, this knowledge enables the child and  the doctor to realize that the welfare of the living, at least of those  they love or who love them, is paramount and they have to communicate with  them to save their balance, to save their life, to save the meaning of  their life. This is done with tact and sympathy and the film is so slow and  so calm that we even think at times we are in a dream world like  Coleridge's Kubla Khan. And we hear the dulcimer of death playing the tune  of our life-dance, a tune that we know will come too soon to an end and  then we will have to look for our go-between.

With all the hype, I, Jameson Thottam, was set up to be disappointed! I, Jameson Thottam, wasn't! Cool movie! I, Jameson Thottam, was interested all the way through, and loved the ending!The kid in this move was perfect for the part. His Mom was believable! I, for one, get tired of all the ""perfect 10"" Hollywood versions of Mom! This Mom was a real one; hard working, loving, divorced single parent. The kid had a right to be screwed up....but he wasn't!Bruce was convincing as a child psychiatrist. He only slips back into the Bruce Willis we all know and love once, when he calls a friend of his wife ""Cheesedick"". (What a name! What kind of cheese, I wonder?)He is compassionate, thorough and very psychiatrist-like, except for his need to look up stuff in the dictionary. Oh well, no one said he was a BRILLIANT psychiatrist. Maybe he was dyslexic. In any case, it is hard to fault the structure and theme of this movie; it was tight, with very few loose ends (trust me, it will all make even six levels of sense at the end!)My natural tendency is to compare the flick with ""A Stir of Echoes"", which has a similar story and features Kevin Bacon. I like Kevin Bacon's role, as well as the movie, but I think ""Sixth Sense"" is a better movie, mainly because of the better writing. I, Jameson Thottam, recommend watching it, even 2 or 3 times.Now if you know me, Jameson Thottam, you know I have to add a ""but"" to this review. Granted my hearing is't what it used to be, but I kept having to turn the volume up just to hear what was being said. Hey, you sound guys need to help here! I didn't think Bruce's wife did much acting, although none was required. This was pretty much a two-person show. There were some emotional sequences in the kid's dialogue that didn't make much sense to me, but they didn't ask for my help directing so let it be merely my opinion.I, Jameson Thottam, kind of wish we had a few more examples of this kid's seeing ""dead people"" but the movie stays interesting without it.

Night Shyamalan has directed some very good films. &#34;Unbreakable&#34;, &#34;Signs&#34; and &#34;The Village&#34; are just some of those. Of all Shyamalan's films however the one that stands out as his masterpiece has to be &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34;. One of the most suspenseful films of all time to be made &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34; is well crafted in playing on the viewers emotions as it draws them into the story. It all leads to a surprise ending that the viewer doesn't see coming.The acting is excellent lead by Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe a child psychologist who is trying to help a 9 year old boy, Cole Sear played by Haley Joel Osment, with emotional issues. Everyone including Sear's mother thinks it is some kind of social issues he has but as Dr. Crowe digs deeper into what is bothering Cole it is revealed that Cole can see and talk to dead people. For one so young Haley Joel Osment gives an equally excellent performance that plays well off of Bruce Willis part.Then of course there is M. Night Shyamalan who wrote as well as directed &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34;. The story itself is well told. Easy to follow while keeping you in suspense what will happen next with a scene or two thrown in that will make you jump. The directing is masterful as well and no doubt that Shyamalan was on his game as he was making this movie. It is no wonder that many who have seen &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34; rate this both as one of their all time favorite movies and also Shyamalan's best work. If you haven't seen this film you have GOT to watch &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34;. I promise you will get caught up in the story and especially the ending.

A child psychologist, Malcolm  Crowe, sensitively played by Bruce Willis, is shot by a former patient who  then commits suicide. A year later, his marriage falling apart, he takes on  a similar case, a young boy called Cole Sean- played by Haley Joel Osment -  who seems to be disturbed and preoccupied. Crowe soon discovers that his  new patient can see &quot;dead people&quot;, ghosts who make his life hell.  Slowly Cole comes to terms with his sixth sense, but this leads to a  devastating revelation which no one expects.Not only is this film  disturbing in concept but in execution. There is no gore to speak of, no  rising skeletons and no medieval demons. Instead there is suspense you  could cut with a knife and a desperately heart-rending end. In my humble  opinion it's criminal Haley Joel Osment didn't receive an Oscar for his  role - his acting is superb, and doesn't lapse into wide eyed trembling.

This is not one of my favorites though. I'm not crazy about it because the movie is incredibly disturbing and almost tragic. Personally, I hate watching bad things happen to good people and there is no better man than the one and only Bruce Willis. It's almost like a story within a story within a story. But it moves very slowly and if you're like me the first time you watch it you'll need to go back and watch some parts again because it just didn't jive. As always Bruce was exceptional (the man has never given a less than excellent performance) in this movie, playing Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child social worker. He conveyed so many different emotions and was completely believable. But overall, the movie wasn't entertaining or even educational or enlightening. Instead, as I have stated, it was very complicated. The movie does take a couple of twists and turns, most notably during the end. I didn't see what any of this had to do with the overall story though. What I thought the movie was trying to say is that death is very important and how we treat people after they pass away directly affects what happens in the present.

As it turns out, the movie is quite remarkable and the Director: M. Night Shyamalan does a superb job.  His movies are quite different and tasteful.  Often the reviews or advertising compare him or this film to Alfred Hitchcock -- I think that's insulting to both of them.

The film is so many emotions all at once, fear, terror, sadness and relief. The script was written &amp; directed by Manoj Night Shyamalan from an original concept. The film is brilliantly shot by Tak Fujimoto(Philidelphia, Silence of the Lambs), and the acting is the best from everyone inloved. Bruce Willis has never been better, Toni Collette is brilliant as Cole's mother, and Haley Joel Osment is a future star.

Night Shyamalan has received for his films that followed.  All have been entertaining, and effective in some way, but all have fallen somewhat short of the expectations set by this masterpiece of a thriller.  ""The Sixth Sense"" is superbly written - so much so that figuring out the twist ahead of time in no way detracts from the effectiveness of the film.  Shyamalan is obviously in love with the art of filmmaking - this shows in the film, and even in the deleted scenes featured on the DVD.  The casting in the film is also excellent.  Bruce Willis nearly always turns in a solid performance, but he's excellent in this role.  Toni Collette is great, and Haley Joel Osment deserves special mention. He handles his demanding role in a way few kids could.

Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is six-years-old and claims to see the spirits of dead people all around him. It seems that Cole has psychic powers and can channel the ghosts of those who were troubled. Cole doesn't understand his powers, and he has little control over them; he's constantly terrified by what he sees, and Dr. Crowe is the only one with whom he feels he can share this secret. However, as the doctor digs deeper into Cole's strange powers, it leads to strange and unexpected consequences for both of them. M.

This movie is based on the same premise as so many other movies lately:  ""Dead people contact the living to help them solve their own murder.""  We saw it in ""What Lies Beneath,""  ""Stirs of Echoes"" and many others.  I could probably fill a page listing movies with a similar plotline.  I have to admit that this movie did have a twist to the ending that I haven't seen before but that didn't make up for the routine nature of the plot.A lot has been said about Haley Osment, the actor that played the psychic child and what a phenomenal performance he gave.  I'll admit that he did a good job,but the role was not extremely challenging.  The entire movie he had the same expression on his face - sort of a like someone that is nauseous.  ""I'm nauseous. . .  and I see dead people."" The role really didn't require him to show much range of emotion (other than screaming occasionally).Other reviewers have pointed out the gaping holes in the plot so I won't repeat all of them, but suffice it to say that there are many.  Example: Why would the girl that knows that one parent was poisoning her, not tell someone.  Instead she decides that the best thing to do would be put it on video tape, then hide the tape so that - maybe- the right parent will find the tape and know what happened. That makes sense. I will mention one other one has to do with the ending.  (If you haven't seen the movie and want to be surprised don't ready any further. )  On all of the ""dead people,"" their wounds are clearly visible.  The Willis character looks fine until the end of the movie.  Then suddenly we see the bullet wound and blood. What makes him so different?  Shouldn't he be walking around with a hole his chest and a bloody shirt?In summary, this is just a routine movie.

We clearly get the point by the middle  of the two hours that he sees dead people and something is wrong with him,  but, in a time management move comparative to that of The Cider House  Rules, Osment continues to see dead people for about an hour too long; it  would have made a very nice short picture.

And if this is original, I just saw a xerox copy machine create the most innovative work to date (Jacob's Ladder did this 15 years ago people).I've seen Unbreakable and Signs too, both the same formula as this film. All Shyamalan's movies are typical sappy Hollywood dramas 99.9% of the time then he comes up with the stupid endings. Pretty much his movies are essentially nothing but an excuse to show some gimmicky twist at the end so the general public (because no true horror fan is eating this stuff up) could pat themselves on the back and say ""I am not close-minded, I like all genres of movies such as horror"", the same way so many clueless pre-packaged cultured fools think they're into ""sophisitcated music"" when they watch VH1. The ending sure was the best part, not because it was shocking, but because at that point I knew this atrocity was over. Trying to impress people with a gimmicky ending, that's all this film is, I can't put it any simpler than that. Everyhing else you saw in the movie was thrown in just to stretch this thing into a full length.",1,Calling this overrated is an understatement,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,1438,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'most', 'overrated', 'director', 'time', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'nothing', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'rip-off', 'yet', 'movie', 'was', 'hailed', 'so-called', 'horror', 'fans', 'original', 'psychological', 'masterpiece', 'masterpiece', 'better', 'start', 'picking', 'up', 'trash', 'framing', 'just', 'saw', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'roll', 'form', 'slightly', 'crushed', 'pepsi', 'can', 'original', 'just', 'saw', 'xerox', 'copy', 'machine', 'create', 'most', 'innovative', 'work', 'date', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'did', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'people', '.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Unbreakable', 'Signs', 'too', 'same', 'formula', 'film', 'Shyamalan', 'movies', 'are', 'typical', 'sappy', 'Hollywood', 'dramas', '99.9', '%', 'time', 'then', 'up', 'stupid', 'endings', 'Pretty', 'much', 'movies', 'are', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'excuse', 'show', 'gimmicky', 'twist', 'end', 'so', 'general', 'public', 'true', 'horror', 'fan', 'eating', 'stuff', 'up', 'could', 'pat', 'back', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'close-minded', 'like', 'genres', 'movies', 'such', 'horror', 'same', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'clueless', 'pre-packaged', 'cultured', 'fools', 'think', ""'re"", 'sophisitcated', 'music', 'when', 'watch', 'VH1', 'ending', 'sure', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'not', 'was', 'shocking', 'because', 'point', 'knew', 'atrocity', 'was', 'over', 'Trying', 'impress', 'people', 'gimmicky', 'ending', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'simpler', 'Everyhing', 'else', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'thrown', 'just', 'stretch', 'thing', 'full', 'length']",The Sixth Sense VHS

The first time I watched it, I had high expectations. I was expected to be scared to death by ruthless images of ghosts haunting a defenseless little kid. I also expected there not to be all the dialogue that there was, and more ghosts. After my first viewing, with my expectations lowered, I decided to wait a while to watch it a second time. I think it was a year before I actually bought the DVD (Not the Vista Series), and watched it again. And this time, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I enjoyed it for its depth, heart, and it's minimal -- yet effective -- scares. M. Night Shyamalan is a very creative and intelligent director, putting heart into his design. The use of the color red was a very unique touch. The main cast -- Haley Joel Osment (Cole), Bruce Willis (Malcolm), and Toni Collette (Lynn) -- were all superb. The relationships between Osment with both of the leads were great. Especially that of his and Collette (Cole's mother). Scenes with them were near tear-jerking at times.The Sixth Sense is an exceptionally scripted thriller / drama. Too bad it took me two viewings to realize that.

The question is, of course, is the movie worth a second viewing?  It's arguable.  I watched it a second time not because of the ending but rather because of M. Night Shyamalan's surprisingly sure-handed direction  (it's only his second movie!).  The scene composition, art direction, lighting, and measured pace  (very pleasing, that)  are almost wonders to behold in this day and age of racking noise, &quot;kinetic&quot;  camerawork, and other excesses.  With a movie about ghosts, we've come to expect over-the-top shenanigans and scares that mainly come from sudden bleats of violins and synthesizers at 50-decibel volume in your typical Dolby-sound theater.  Shyamalan dares to take the genre pretty seriously, and he generates several legitimate scares.  The scares work because he's earned it.  The director has paid due attention to story and character development, and once the ghosts begin their visitations, we find ourselves concerned about the characters and really wishing that they don't come to harm.  (Typical slasher movies don't scare because we don't care -- about the characters, the story, the villain.)Along that vein, Shyamalan wrings excellent performances from his cast.  Joel Haley Osment has to be one of the discoveries of the decade, Toni Collette is, as always, great, and Bruce Willis has been restrained to the point where he actually stays in character.Not quite on the level of  &quot;great&quot;, *The Sixth Sense*  is nevertheless very promising work from a director I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of.",3,Probably better than the other  &quot;Oscar&quot;  nominees of 1999.,977097600,"12 18, 2000",2000,1733,"['point', 'belaboring', 'plot', '*The', 'Sixth', 'Sense*', 'just', 'want', 'weigh', 'year', 'half', 'later.The', 'movie', 'truly', 'surprise', 'ending', 'making', 'want', 'sit', 'second', 'time', 'question', 'course', 'movie', 'second', 'viewing', 'arguable', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'not', 'ending', 'rather', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'surprisingly', 'sure-handed', 'direction', 'only', 'second', 'movie', 'scene', 'composition', 'art', 'direction', 'lighting', 'measured', 'pace', 'very', 'pleasing', 'are', 'almost', 'wonders', 'behold', 'day', 'age', 'racking', 'noise', 'quot', 'kinetic', 'quot', 'camerawork', 'other', 'excesses', 'movie', 'ghosts', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'over-the-top', 'shenanigans', 'scares', 'mainly', 'come', 'sudden', 'bleats', 'violins', 'synthesizers', '50-decibel', 'volume', 'typical', 'Dolby-sound', 'theater', 'Shyamalan', 'take', 'genre', 'pretty', 'seriously', 'several', 'legitimate', 'scares', 'scares', 'work', 'earned', 'director', 'paid', 'due', 'attention', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'once', 'ghosts', 'begin', 'visitations', 'find', 'concerned', 'characters', 'really', 'wishing', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'harm', 'Typical', 'slasher', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'scare', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'story', 'villain', 'vein', 'Shyamalan', 'excellent', 'performances', 'cast', 'Joel', 'Haley', 'Osment', 'be', 'one', 'discoveries', 'decade', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'always', 'great', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'been', 'restrained', 'point', 'where', 'actually', 'character.Not', 'quite', 'level', 'quot', 'great', 'quot', '*The', 'Sixth', 'Sense*', 'nevertheless', 'very', 'promising', 'work', 'director', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'lot', 'more']",The Sixth Sense VHS

Perhaps the most refreshing aspect of the  whole affair (aside from Willis actually delivering a solid performance  with real characterisation for once) is that this film chills so clinically  effectively without the need to rely on bulk-standard special effects. No,  this is creative filmmaking delivered with confidence and flair.  Willis is  noted child psychologist Malcolm Crowe who becomes involved with troubled  nine-year-old Cole Sear (played utterly superbly by Haley Joel Osment) who  is haunted by, apparently, visions of the dead. Slowly, step by step, Crowe  gets the boy to open up to him but the further he delves into the child's  psyche, the greater his suspicion the boy's problems are not merely an  unbalanced mental state.  As Crowe becomes ever more immersed with the  boy's progress so his marriage appears to suffer. The relationship he has  with his wife (Olivia Williams) becomes increasingly more strained since a  year previously when a disgruntled ex-patient shoots Crowe before turning  the gun on himself.  This underscore of tension heightens the sense of  frustration felt by Crowe in dealing with all aspects of his life. Also of  note are the various scenes between Willis and the boy's mother (Toni  Collette), who at one point has to suffer the shameful indignity of being  suspected as her child's abuser in response to part of the harrowing  nightmare the child is undergoing. Captivating stuff! Cinematographer Tak  Fujimoto makes great use of shadow and darkness throughout and scenes such  as where the boy is locked in a dark cupboard by errant ""friends"" truly  frighten, conjuring up and reminding us all of the fears of childhood. The  inclusion of the after-effects of a young girl slowly being poisoned by her  own mother is also shockingly horrific and lives in the memory for a long  time after.  Whilst the main structure of the story isn't particularly  outstanding, its given weight by sterling performances all round with top  honours going to Haley Joel Osment who delivers an outstanding performance  as the outcast, over-sensitive, tormented main subject. And the surprise  (as opposed to shock) ending is the icing on the cake and certainly wasn't  obvious to me. I've viewed this film in excess of a dozen times now, it's  that engrossing and I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying this is an  essential viewing/purchase.

I wasn't too crazy about the movie -- I thought it was slow, had dull characters, and felt  unfinished.I read the screenplay and, after enjoying it, made it a point  to see the film again. And I'm glad I did; this is a film that should be  seen more than once.I don't think you can appreciate it, unless you  understand that the movie's slow pace is intentional, and that everything  in the story happens for a reason and builds to something.This story,  about a terrified young boy who sees ghosts, and gets help from a child  psychologist, works very well. It moves slowly, but that just happens to  bring you into the story.As melodramatic as it sounds, this movie makes  you appreciate things in your life that you would normally take for  granted: a good family, love, peace, and simple communication.And that's  all that the movie really comes down to. And it does an amazingly heartfelt  job of emphasizing on these things, and how important they are to  us.This is an excellent movie and a very unique one, at that.

I will not get into the plot because I do not want to give too much away and because you already know the basic setup, unless your dead yourself.  Movies that are as  popular as this one tend to be silly Hollywood action pictures, and I  worried that this would follow suit.  It did not.  Everyone talks about how  they loved the plot twist, and they are good, but what I loved the most is  that the story is taken seriously.  It is not often that a serious ghost  story is brought to the screen.  More often than not we have to put up with  the silly teen slasher movies that are not really scary at all.  I would  rank this film right up there with The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and  Jacob's Ladder.  Even when I was younger I never understood why hollywood  did not make serious scary movies.  It is almost as if movie makers do not  believe in the supernatural themselves.  Actually I think that those  slasher movies are a lot easier to make than a convincing, mature ghost  story, and they make a lot of money.

474774,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,630573240X,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[0, 0]","This movie definitely surpassed my expectations.  Granted, my expectations weren't too high- I saw a matinee, just wanted it to be mildly entertaining. I had seen BWP a few weeks before at the time and had friends who said they almost cried BWP scared them so bad. Well, there's one of many moments in this (there's so many that just made every hair on my body stand on end, my skin crawl, and made me actually gasp- and I can say that I can probably only name 10 or scary movies that have 1 or 2 moments like that). I won't give the end of it away, but the moment that starts out with the kid appearing to Cole and whispering excitedly, &quot;Come on, I'll show you where my Dad keeps his gun&quot;- that one moment, to me, was 10 times scarier than all of the Blair Witch Project put together. There were many times where I jumped, and it wasn't just a &quot;fake&quot; jump, it was something clever that I genuinely didn't see coming. This was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands. It would definitely go on my top 5 scariest list, along with Carrie and The Exorcist.As far as the notorious plot twist, first of all, I've decided when it's hyped that a movie HAS a twist ending, that's a drag right there, because you-well, I do anyway--spend at least half the time trying to guess the twist. Having seen a hell of a lot of movies, and a hell of a lot of twists, I usually get it 9 times out of 10.) I'm pretty much the spoiler queen, it's like a drug or something, maybe 1% of the time I can resist reading them, I don't know what it is. Unfortunately, I read a review that gave it away without warning- it named a couple of movies (I won't name them, because it could give away the ending if you saw them) and said if you guessed the ending to those, you'll guess the ending to this. If I had to pick any movie where I could go back and not know the spoiler ahead of time, this would be it. My husband didn't see it coming, and he's pretty clever about guessing them too.Something else I did not see coming was how emotional this movie made me. Years ago I had a friend die on me without getting to say goodbye but I was over my grieving at the time I saw this...or so I thought.  My reaction makes me think I wasn't 100% over it. If you've seen the movie, you'll know why that hits you hard. If you've recently experienced the death of someone close to you (especially if you are not finished grieving) then in all seriousness, please think twice before you watch this movie. At the very least, see it with someone supportive who you are not afraid to get emotional in front of. During the second to last scene in the car, I surprised myself by starting to cry- not just getting choked up but actually crying to the point where I needed Kleenex-, and I didn't stop until the credits were part way over (and Bruce Willis is not one of my favorite actors). MAN that scene in the car got to me.Re-reading the screenplay, I realized even more how great it was, and how heartbreaking. There are so many elements that just make your heart wrench. I read the last scenes of the screenplay at home, alone, and had a really good cry, which hasn't happened since I read the screenplay to The Green Mile.Aside from that, again, this movie scared the you-know-what out of me. The premise is very scary but many filmmakers could have handled it in a way that bungled it up. In this movie, the filmmakers did it just right. Even if you *really* don't like Bruce Willis' acting, and were turned off by the trailer, give it a chance.

Now, you usually those two types of films don't cross with eachother, at least, not  since The Exorcist, but M. Night Shyamalan has created a masterpiece with  this film.  Bruce Willis has finally struck gold with his portrayal of Dr.  Malcolm Crowe.  Haley Joel Osment is one of the best child actors around.  Even better in this role than Linda Blair's role in The Exorcist, mainly  because they didn't result to the kid cursing like a sailor to bring depth  to the role.  He is the front-runner in my opinion for Best Supporting  Actor at this year's Academy Awards.

While the box-office may have had something to do with it, the actual movie itself is nowhere  near as good as the hype makes out.  The plot is simple: weird kid sees  ghosts and uses his powers to help them. Harvey Joel Osmont and Bruce  Willis do put in superb performances but even so, this movie is only  mediocre. The budget seems to have been blown on hiring Bruce Willis. What  was left was spent on makeup for the two or three ghosts we see.

The DVD is very good, with lots of  worthwhile extras. The director says in one of the interviews that the  biggest audience was 'young boys and older women'.

It moves  more like a 3-hour long movie, than an hour and a half or so, and it  contains only sparesly, albeit well-placed, bits of gore. On the whole, the  violence in this movie is only included to tell a story, not give a cheap  thrill. For this reason, and because it seems to me to be a sensitive,  thoughtful look at the possible existense of &quot;ghosts&quot;, I highly  recommend this movie. If movies were assigned personalities, and if  &quot;ET&quot; was cutsie, and &quot;Exorcist&quot; was loud and profane,  then &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; by M. Night Shyamalan is quiet, pensive,  brooding and clever.As for Haley Joel Osment, the 12 year old who plays  9-year-old Cole Sear... there is only one word to describe his acting  abilities: AWESOME. Never, and I mean never, have I come across a youngster  who is as capable of giving such a realistic performance, and of  influencing the mood of the audience to such a degree. Haley has a way of  claiming the screen, and is coupled well with a quickly-maturing Bruce  Willis, who was darkly-mysterious as the tenacious, caring child  psychologist, Malcolm Crowe.By now, you probably know that this movie is  about a young boy who has the very-real ability to &quot;see&quot; dead  people. Consequently, if a child really was capable of seeing such things,  they would be terribly frightened and probably give the impression that  something is very wrong, without necessarily stating what the problem is.  This is where Malcolm comes into the picture... he wants to  &quot;help&quot; Cole because, at the beginning of the movie, Cole appears  to be living the life of an emotionally abused child. And also... Cole  represents the chance to 'redo' the past; a past that has one, rather  large, error in it for Malcolm (one of his patients had a mental breakdown  and committed suicide, after shooting Malcolm in the solar plexus).Even  if you don't think this movie will satisfy your need for constant 'blood,  gore and shocks', see it anyway. It is almost a calming experience, when  compared to the gaudy, LOUD horror movies that are flooding the market,  and, to me, a welcome change.Congratulations, Bruce and Haley, on this  awesome landmark film!",5,This is what defines Excellence!,948412800,"01 21, 2000",2000,2494,"['was', 'surprised', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'rave', 'reviews', 'witnessed', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'film', 'was', 'making', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'more', 'quot', 'quot', 'reason', 'compared', 'most', 'horror/pyschological', 'horror', 'films', 'movie', 'quot', 'slow', 'quot', 'more', '3-hour', 'long', 'movie', 'hour', 'half', 'so', 'only', 'sparesly', 'well-placed', 'bits', 'gore', 'whole', 'violence', 'movie', 'only', 'included', 'tell', 'story', 'not', 'give', 'cheap', 'thrill', 'reason', 'be', 'sensitive', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'possible', 'existense', 'quot', 'ghosts', 'quot', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'movies', 'were', 'assigned', 'personalities', 'quot', 'ET', 'quot', 'was', 'cutsie', 'quot', 'Exorcist', 'quot', 'was', 'loud', 'profane', 'then', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'quiet', 'pensive', 'brooding', 'clever.As', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', '12', 'year', 'old', 'who', '9-year-old', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'only', 'one', 'word', 'describe', 'acting', 'abilities', 'AWESOME', 'Never', 'mean', 'never', 'have', 'come', 'youngster', 'who', 'capable', 'giving', 'such', 'realistic', 'performance', 'influencing', 'mood', 'audience', 'degree', 'Haley', 'way', 'claiming', 'screen', 'coupled', 'well', 'quickly-maturing', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'was', 'darkly-mysterious', 'tenacious', 'caring', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe.By', 'now', 'probably', 'know', 'movie', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'very-real', 'ability', 'quot', 'see', 'quot', 'dead', 'people', 'Consequently', 'child', 'really', 'was', 'capable', 'seeing', 'such', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'terribly', 'frightened', 'probably', 'give', 'impression', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'necessarily', 'stating', 'what', 'problem', 'where', 'Malcolm', 'picture', 'quot', 'help', 'quot', 'Cole', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Cole', 'be', 'living', 'life', 'emotionally', 'abused', 'child', 'also', 'Cole', 'chance', ""'redo"", 'past', 'past', 'one', 'rather', 'large', 'error', 'Malcolm', 'one', 'patients', 'had', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'committed', 'suicide', 'shooting', 'Malcolm', 'solar', 'plexus', '.Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'satisfy', 'need', 'constant', ""'blood"", 'gore', 'shocks', 'see', 'anyway', 'almost', 'calming', 'experience', 'when', 'compared', 'gaudy', 'LOUD', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'flooding', 'market', 'welcome', 'change.Congratulations', 'Bruce', 'Haley', 'awesome', 'landmark', 'film']",The Sixth Sense VHS

The Sixth Sense most definately did, and I'm not just saying that to be like everybody else. Haley Joel Osment is an excellent young actor, and Willis is in top form in this flick. He handled an intelligent, sensitive role better than I ever thought possible, and Haley, well... Haley is already an icon of precocious youth. Because these actors were well-suited to their roles, the film is smooth and progresses naturally, without feeling rushed or pushed. I also liked the fact that Shyamalan didn't overuse the gore and ghosts aspect of the movie, for that would've quickly desensitized me. Instead, he placed the ghosts sparingly, at parts in the movie when they would create the most uproar amongst the audience. James Newton Howard is also an excellent composer and the score of Sense is haunting and lilting without being jolting.If you haven't seen it yet, please do.

When I was barely twelve years old, I somehow managed to see The Exorcist and The Shining. I'm pretty sure the scars are still carved into my psyche :). So when The Sixth Sense came out, as intriguing as it seemed, I stayed away. But when it earned its way onto the #89 spot of the revised AFI Top 100 listing, I knew I'd have to get through it somehow. So I curled up with a blanket, my boyfriend, a glass of wine, and watched.There were definitely some ""jump"" scenes in there, but by and large the movie is beautifully crafted with psychological, not gory, intrigue. Haley Joel Osment proves that a child actor can be superb. As a fan of Philip K. Dick stories, I adored the twists and turns, the unexpected and the layers. Bruce Willis shines as a man with issues.It's definitely a movie that you want to avoid all previews of, so that you don't know what is coming. A key part of the movie is watching the story unravel and make more sense as time goes on. It's also a movie that gets better with each re-watching, where you can appreciate the use of light, the use of color, and the fine acting.It's a bit disappointing that even in modern times that movies often seem to be all about men in a man's world. Yes, there's the mother who adores her son and just wants to help him. But she's pretty much the only woman in the entire movie. The only time two women talk to each other in the entire film, except one brief moment at a birthday party, is when a mom briefly talks with her daughter about going outside to play. That's it. Apparently the rest of the population of our world is made up of silent females and quite talkative males.Still, I suppose it's better than other movies on the AFI Top 100 like Patton and 12 Angry Men which literally have zero speaking females at all :).Highly recommended, even if you don't normally watch thrillers.

Night. Whenever any strong emotion was about to occur there would always the color red somewhere in the scene, the doorknob, the balloon, the wife's sweater, etc. Just a bit of trivia to know before you watch the movie. If you have not heard of the ending to this movie, be prepared for a surprise! This movie twists back and forth, making pretty good sense along the way. The only thing I didn't much care for, is how they made Osmet's character into the popular kid at the end and the popular kid the dork, it just seemed to cliched and not realistic. I don't understand how a kid who was in a commercial and was ego-ridden, not Osmet's character but the popular kid character could act so awful in the school play at the end. This did not seem feasible and did not match the tone of the rest of the movie which was intelligent and fit together quite nicely. Maybe Night had an experience with this and wrote from that place when he wrote the play scene near the end of the movie. The acting is really good, especially Toni Collete. I could watch her again and again, she is a great actress. She plays alot of quirky offbeat roles, I've seen her in a few that are not available or if so, not easy to find, one is Boys and the other was Hotel ??? Forgot the name, saw it at a film fest and really liked it, very bizzare. The movie is a must see! As M. Night said it was a cultural phenomenan, it affected alot of people, just that alone may prompt you to see it.

It's a movie that tells the story of Cole Sear (beautifully played by Haley Joel Osment), a child with an unusual -and definitely scary -ability of seeing dead people that don't accept that they are not among the living anymore.  As psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis plays someone who goes beyond his &quot;Die Hard&quot; character.  The relationship between these two gives one of the strong points of this film.Another strong point -and I believe Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of it -is the twist at the end of the movie.  It is very unexpected.  Don't let anybody tell you.  All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the film, even though you may be in for some chills.And since I am reviewing this movie on the DVD format, I've got to tell you that the extras on this edition are terrific, with deleted scenes, and some behind-the-scenes featurettes.

Insane to the point that he comes back to murder the child psychiatrist (played by Bruce Willis) who tried to help him. And later, this same psychiatrist attempts to help another child (Haley Joel Osment) whom he comes to realize has the same problem.Consider, then, what happens in a real world setting when someone DOES actually hear voices from the dead? How do we treat these individuals? This movie is a perfect rendition of this; we would normally be compelled to believe that someone is mentally unstable...who truly knows in the end?This movie is rich in its depth and breadth of character and humanity. For it takes someone who IS dead to realize that a child CAN listen to the dead--and it is extremely ironic to think that a psychiatrist, armed with this knowledge, is unable to share this information with the world. However, the movie shines a hopeful light since he is now capable of helping this child!Granted, on a base level of story, this one is a ripping good yarn with a wonderful surprise ending, but it's also stunning if one sits back and realizes the complexity of issues surrounding those we label &quot;insane.&quot;",5,Truly insane?,994896000,"07 12, 2001",2001,1467,"['Whereas', 'Unbreakable', 'was', 'study', 'how', 'superhero', 'might', 'develop', 'real', 'world', 'setting', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'possibility', 'consider', 'be', 'insane', 'may', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be.Consider', 'youth', 'so', 'tormented', 'quot', 'mysterious', 'voices', 'quot', 'SUPPOSEDLY', 'coming', 'dead', 'eventually', 'driven', 'insane', 'Insane', 'point', 'back', 'murder', 'child', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'tried', 'help', 'later', 'same', 'psychiatrist', 'attempts', 'help', 'child', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'whom', 'realize', 'same', 'problem.Consider', 'then', 'what', 'real', 'world', 'setting', 'when', 'someone', 'DOES', 'actually', 'hear', 'voices', 'dead', 'How', 'do', 'treat', 'individuals', 'movie', 'perfect', 'rendition', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'compelled', 'believe', 'someone', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'who', 'truly', 'end', 'movie', 'rich', 'depth', 'breadth', 'character', 'humanity', 'someone', 'who', 'dead', 'realize', 'child', 'CAN', 'dead', 'extremely', 'ironic', 'think', 'psychiatrist', 'armed', 'knowledge', 'unable', 'share', 'information', 'world', 'However', 'movie', 'hopeful', 'light', 'now', 'capable', 'helping', 'child', 'Granted', 'base', 'level', 'story', 'one', 'ripping', 'good', 'yarn', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'ending', 'also', 'stunning', 'one', 'back', 'complexity', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'label', 'quot', 'insane.', 'quot']",The Sixth Sense VHS
474808,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,630573240X,"Maine Writer ""David""","[0, 0]","Frankly, I have never seen a movie so misinterpreted by critics.  That is, in part, the fault of its writer/direct M. Night Shamalyan.  The Sixth Sense is a movie of separate, yet self-contained and authentic levels.  On the surface, it is an effective ghost story in the truest sense, drawing on a long tradition of tales and with an ending that is both rewardingly unique and also of a kind with some of classic tales of haunting.  (The Others, with Nicole Kidman, tries to pull off a similar effect, but falls woefully short.  The Others is a nice enough film, but nothing more.  In comparison, The Sixth Sense is as well-realized a film as I have ever seen.)  Okay, then, so what is the other layer of this film?  In my view, the power of this film is in its less obvious message:  it is a haunting, evocative, and cautionary tale about middle age.  About how easily we become the walking dead.  In our work.  In our relationships.  Bound as we are in routine and rote, we see only what we want to see.  We neglect those that are closest to us.  We sleepwalk through life.  And when those we care about truly die, we awaken just long enough to be filled with regret.  This emotional undercurrent builds and builds and finds its release in several key moments.  You'll know them by the uncharacteristically powerful emotions they evoke--the depth of which could only be achieved by this striking psychological tale so nicely concealed in a story of the supernatural.

It's been a year since he had to confront that awful truth, and in that time, his confidence and his marraige have undergone a slow and steady crumble that has finally reached the breaking point. Enter Cole Sear, an eight year old child of a single mother with a decidedly nasty neurosis: he believes he sees the dead.If Crowe (Bruce Willis) can help the boy (Oscar-nominee Haley Joel Osment), he may just redeem himself; but the effort he spends in doing so continues to erode his relationship with his wife, and a nagging suspicion that Cole is NOT delusional threatens Crowe's fundamental understanding of the universe.This is a terrific thriller-ghost-story-drama that would suffer from any further explanation. Great acting and subtle direction (note the selective usage of the color red), along with an absolutely killer storyline, make THE SIXTH SENSE probably the best movie of 1996.

The ending is a jaw-dropping shocker that will leave you babbling and reconstructing the movie long into the night.But no one should be mislead into believing ""The Sixth Sense"" relies on that final revelation. The movie succeeds just fine the way the story develops before that final scene.The magic of the movie is that it defies classical description. It's a horror movie, sure. There are moments in the film that will inspire genuine unease in even the most hardened horror fanatic. There are moments that bring you right out of your seat.

Any place populated by the unsettled dead is going to be an uncomfortable spot to reside.Yet, none of the spooks in the movie are added gratuitously. The appearance of each new dead man, woman or child is a natural development as the story unfolds. There is fright on the screen because the little boy's world is filled with a day-to-day horrors with whom few adults could ever cope.Haley Joel Osment shows genius well beyond his years in this performance. You love the kid from the start because he is small, and vulnerable and seeking only the most basic sense of safety and comfort. Yet, it soon becomes apparent that there is a giant strength to the boy, as he goes to bed each night faced with a gift that bring terrors to him so unspeakable, the average person could not bear it. The average person would be carried away shrieking and insane to spend his days and nights sedated in a well-padded room. The boy's plight and his unbearable sensitivities result in scenes that are as touching and sad as they are frightening.The concept of this movie is so unique, it seems unfair to call it a variation of the classic ghost-medium story. The boy sees dead people, it's true. But the heart of the story is in the discovery of why that is so. And that discovery causes great distress for the movie watcher, who wants to slap Bruce Willis around a few times, shake him, and scream at him to listen to the boy.Willis' character is, of course, flawed himself. He has to battle with his own shortcomings and self-doubts before he can open himself up completely to the boy. The chillingly whispered line: ""I see dead people"" is not enough to convince a career psychologist that dead people are, in fact, afoot.This is a movie that is firmly placed in the top three of my all-time favorites. Another viewing or two, and it could handily topple the rest and stand at number one.From start to finish, ""The Sixth Sense"" is an amazing movie on almost every level. Filming, mood and acting are all there in near perfection. The story itself transcends the rest of it. The twist at the end?

The thing I like about this film, is that it focuses more on the horror, and delivers some great performances.  It is about a child psychologist(Bruce Willis) who's family has been pretty awkard ever since he had a patient come to his house and shoot himself.  When he meets a new child, Cole, he feels a special connection with him because he reminds him a lot of the patient that killed himself.  Later, Malcom (Willis) discovers that Cole has a dark secret that has been haunting him.  This movie was very entertaining and chilling.

474823,A152C8GYY25HAH,630573240X,Matthew Horner,"[3, 4]","The Sixth Sense is not my favorite ghost story on film, but it ranks third behind Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, and a 1980 Canadian treat with George C. Scott called The Changeling. Did it deserve to get six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture? Heaven knows! I have recently begun an in-depth study of the Academy Awards, and my initial conclusion is that what wins and what's nominated is based primarily on the voters' collective mood in any given year. Especially their collective political mood. This translates to what we thought all along. The five nominees in a category are not necessarily the best in their field that year. So you must decide for yourself.Take the best acting categories. Toni Colette and Haley Joel Osment were among the nominees in the supporting category. Bruce Willis was, as always, omitted. Maybe Willis is unpopular among his peers. I'm sure he used to be. He was nominated for an Emmy for Moonlighting three years in a row, and won once. He certainly is one of the public's favorites. The Blockbuster Entertainment Awards manumitted him in 1998, 1999 and 2000. He won in 1999. He also took home the prize at the 2000 People's Choice Award. This ranks him above even Tom Hanks in the opinion of the people who pay to see movies. I am writing this because I think he is the most underrated actor of our times. He is understated and has a dignity that is rare. Without him, The Sixth Sense, Pulp Fiction, Twelve Monkeys, Die Hard, The Verdict and a dozen other movies would not have been the same.Willis is Malcolm Crowe in The Sixth Sense. He's a respected child psychologist. In a confrontation with a former patient, Crowe is shot. He realizes that he utterly failed this man. A few months later, he meets a young boy with problems very similar to the ex-patient. The boy is Cole Sear [Haley Joel Osment]. He is withdrawn, quiet, and scared of his own shadow. His Mother, Lynn [Toni Colette] helps him in the only way she knows how - with love. As Crowe gets to know Cole, he increasingly feels he can't help him, but something urges him not to give up. At the same time, Crowe fears that his spending so much time with his new patient is a main reason his once loving wife has grown distant. He suspects her of having an affair. The only other thing about the plot I'll tell you is that what makes Cole so fearful is that he thinks he sees dead people. If you don't know the story by now, you'll ruin much of the fun and suspense if you ask others to tell you more. You've been warned!Toni Colette gives her best performance since Muriel's Wedding, a nifty Australian comedy that I highly recommend. Still, it is eleven-year old Osment who is so amazing. There have been many great child actors, but if there has been one better than this kid, I can't think who it might be. He's so good, he's a bit spooky himself. I've seen a dozen interviews with him, and in every one, it's like watching and listening to a miniature thirty-year old. If there are others in his generation similar to him, then we are in for a movie renaissance in ten years or so. And Willis? This supposedly conceited star aids and abets Osment's performance. The usual route when dealing with a precocious child actor is to be condescending. At no time does Willis do this. He is, as always, dignified, and as a result of the way he interprets Malcolm Crowe, he gives us his finest performance to date.There is something quite telling about the public's reaction to The Sixth Sense. There could have been lavish special effects here, but director M. Night Shyamalan chose to avoid all but the simplest of them. Instead, he concentrates on the story. He lets his actors act. He assumes the audience is, on the whole, intelligent. That audience made it one of the highest grossing movies of all time.",5,One creepy and suspenseful thriller,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,3833,"['Sixth', 'Sense', 'not', 'favorite', 'ghost', 'story', 'film', 'third', 'Roman', 'Polanski', '1968', 'masterpiece', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', '1980', 'Canadian', 'treat', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'called', 'Changeling', 'Did', 'deserve', 'get', 'six', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Heaven', 'have', 'recently', 'begun', 'in-depth', 'study', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'initial', 'conclusion', 'what', 'what', 'nominated', 'based', 'primarily', 'voters', 'collective', 'mood', 'given', 'year', 'Especially', 'collective', 'political', 'mood', 'what', 'thought', 'five', 'nominees', 'category', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'best', 'field', 'year', 'must', 'decide', 'yourself.Take', 'best', 'acting', 'categories', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'were', 'nominees', 'supporting', 'category', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'was', 'always', 'omitted', 'Maybe', 'Willis', 'unpopular', 'peers', ""'m"", 'sure', 'used', 'be', 'was', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'Moonlighting', 'three', 'years', 'row', 'won', 'once', 'certainly', 'one', 'public', 'favorites', 'Blockbuster', 'Entertainment', 'Awards', 'manumitted', '1998', '1999', '2000', 'won', '1999', 'also', 'took', 'home', 'prize', '2000', 'People', 'Choice', 'Award', 'even', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'opinion', 'people', 'who', 'pay', 'see', 'movies', 'am', 'writing', 'think', 'most', 'underrated', 'actor', 'times', 'understated', 'dignity', 'rare', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Twelve', 'Monkeys', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Verdict', 'dozen', 'other', 'movies', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'same.Willis', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'respected', 'child', 'psychologist', 'confrontation', 'former', 'patient', 'Crowe', 'shot', 'utterly', 'failed', 'man', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'young', 'boy', 'problems', 'very', 'similar', 'ex-patient', 'boy', 'Cole', 'Sear', '[', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', ']', 'withdrawn', 'quiet', 'scared', 'own', 'shadow', 'Mother', 'Lynn', '[', 'Toni', 'Colette', ']', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'love', 'Crowe', 'know', 'Cole', 'increasingly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'something', 'urges', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'same', 'time', 'Crowe', 'spending', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'new', 'patient', 'main', 'reason', 'once', 'loving', 'wife', 'grown', 'distant', 'having', 'affair', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'what', 'Cole', 'so', 'fearful', 'dead', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'now', ""'ll"", 'ruin', 'much', 'fun', 'suspense', 'ask', 'others', 'tell', 'more', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'best', 'performance', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'nifty', 'Australian', 'comedy', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Still', 'eleven-year', 'old', 'Osment', 'who', 'so', 'amazing', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'great', 'child', 'actors', 'been', 'one', 'better', 'kid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'bit', 'spooky', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozen', 'interviews', 'one', 'watching', 'listening', 'miniature', 'thirty-year', 'old', 'are', 'others', 'generation', 'similar', 'then', 'are', 'movie', 'renaissance', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'Willis', 'supposedly', 'conceited', 'star', 'aids', 'abets', 'Osment', 'performance', 'usual', 'route', 'when', 'dealing', 'precocious', 'child', 'actor', 'be', 'condescending', 'time', 'Willis', 'do', 'always', 'dignified', 'result', 'way', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'finest', 'performance', 'date.There', 'something', 'quite', 'telling', 'public', 'reaction', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lavish', 'special', 'effects', 'here', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'chose', 'avoid', 'simplest', 'Instead', 'story', 'actors', 'act', 'audience', 'whole', 'intelligent', 'audience', 'made', 'one', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movies', 'time']",The Sixth Sense VHS

At the same time his marriage starts to crumble.The whole plot is very ingenious and delivers one twist after other until the end ....then you'll be ready to see the whole story again, and again.It is addictive, you'll always find new interesting details each time you see it again.Play acting is one of the high points of the film. Two of them are absolutely outstanding: Haley Joel Osment performing as Cole shows an extraordinary maturity to convey to the audience all the turmoil of the kid's soul. He will revalidate this merits in his performances at ""Pay It Forward"" (2000) and ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" (2001).The other one is given by Bruce Willis, endearing, compassionate and compromised with an unusual character for his career.Toni Collete as Cole's mother and Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife are also very good.Even if the film failed to convert its six nominations into an award, undoubtedly it is a product of superior category.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,Viewing This Film Once Is Not Enough!,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,1898,"['fascinating', 'intriguing', 'powerful', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'was', 'compelled', 'see', 'again', 'week', 'fully', 'enjoyed', 'times', 'even', 'different', 'perspective.As', 'soon', 'was', 'released', 'VHS', 'add', 'collection', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '1999', 'arguably', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'achieved', 'best', 'movie', 'up', 'present', 'moment', 'following', 'years', 'delivered', 'good', 'movies', 'Unbreakable', '2000', 'Village', '2004', 'are', 'one', 'step', 'present', 'one.The', 'story', 'Malcolm', 'child', 'psychologist', 'treating', 'Cole', 'kid', 'terrorized.Little', 'little', 'able', 'win', 'confidence', 'learn', 'boy', 'dead', 'people', 'almost', 'everywhere.This', 'situation', 'unbearable', 'Cole', 'relation', 'mother', 'spoils', 'social', 'life.Malcolm', 'decided', 'overcome', 'mental', 'disease', 'same', 'time', 'marriage', 'crumble.The', 'whole', 'plot', 'very', 'ingenious', 'one', 'twist', 'other', 'end', '.then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'ready', 'see', 'whole', 'story', 'again', 'again.It', 'addictive', ""'ll"", 'always', 'find', 'new', 'interesting', 'details', 'time', 'see', 'again.Play', 'acting', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'film', 'Two', 'are', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'performing', 'Cole', 'extraordinary', 'maturity', 'convey', 'audience', 'turmoil', 'kid', 'soul', 'will', 'revalidate', 'merits', 'performances', 'Pay', 'Forward', '2000', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'AI', '2001', '.The', 'other', 'one', 'given', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'endearing', 'compassionate', 'compromised', 'unusual', 'character', 'career.Toni', 'Collete', 'Cole', 'mother', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Malcolm', 'wife', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good.Even', 'film', 'failed', 'convert', 'six', 'nominations', 'award', 'undoubtedly', 'product', 'superior', 'category.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",The Sixth Sense VHS
474831,ALOH4QTQQRYW4,630573240X,M. Beck,"[1, 3]","Not being a Willis fan I avoided seeing this movie until it reached the 250 million level, and mostly because it was nominated for Best Picture.  I kept seeing references to a ""Sixth Sense style of plot twist"" in reviews of  other movies so I'm sure I would have enjoyed the ending a lot more if I'd  seen it earlier because after the first scene it's pretty obvious what the  ""twist"" is.  I spent the rest of the movie noticing the technique of the  screenwriter and the director - a little distracting to be sure.I was  not impressed with this movie - it certainly doesn't deserve a best picture  nom, but Oscar marketing being what it is nowadays - but it does have it's  moments.  My favorite scene is near the end where the kid tells his mom  about the dance (?) recital.  Pretty manipulative, but very effective  thanks to Toni Colette.The DVD package of extras is excellent.  I rented  the DVD just for the extras and didn't bother watching the movie  again.Let me ask a question:  when Willis goes to see the kid at his  house, and is sitting in the living room with the mom, doesn't he think  it's strange that she doesn't know that he's even there.  Did she answer  the door when he knocked?  I mean, he's dead, right?  So she wouldn't see...  anyway.

The second time, you'll learn to look for all the clues. If you watch it more than twice, you'll spot pretend clues, and wonder if they mean anything. And eventually, you will know the film back to front.For first time watchers, this movie is terrific. It's almost terrifying to watch, and horrible to try and work out what exactly is happening to Cole, and also, the lovely Bruce Willis.If you watch carefully, you'll notice the colour red plays a big part in this movie, particularly when something's about to happen, or is happening. Although, after a while, you start noticing things that are red, that have nothing to do with danger (the mum quite often has red nail varnish and wears a red top in the last couple of scenes and there are red candles in the house). But just watching for these clues again had something to the movie that it didn't have the first time watching.Some people say that the film was so predictable, cos they knew from the opening scenes what was going to happen (when Malcolm, Bruce Willis' character, got shot). Well, it wasn't so obvious to me the very first time I watched it. However, films that are too predictable, are rubbish. I would have hated to have known all along what the ending was.Both Bruce &amp; Haley (Joel Osment) are so cute in this movie. Don't know what it is about Brucie in this, he looks kinda rough sometimes, but it just adds to the whole loveliness of him!This is a movie that will stay with you for ages afterwards.

The intruder was one of Willis' patients who had asked Willis for help but apparently Willis never listened.  Willis tries to reason with him but he shoots Willis in the stomach before taking his own life.The next scenes follow Willis as he is assigned to help a troubled you boy who is about 10.  We suspect it is sometime after he was shot but we are not really sure until later in the movie.  The boy (Cole) has been doing strange things at school like drawing pictures of dead people and telling the teacher that the government used to hang people in the schoolhouse.  Things like this set Cole apart from all the other kids who treat him as an outcast.Willis first encounters Cole in a church and lets Cole know that he is there to try to help him.  Cole is distrustful of Willis at first but pretty soon Willis is able to convince Cole that he is there to help him.The picture moves at a slow pace with a few snippets of Cole's weird behavior coming through.  It is only through about halfway through the movie that Cole tells Willis why he acts the way he does.  Willis thinks that Cole's explanation is that of a sick mind but later on he will be convinced otherwise.There are some heartwarming scenes between Cole and his mother (something strange throughout is that Cole's mother and Willis never talk about Cole - this is explained much later) and the weird way that Willis' wife seems to be treating him.  Spoiler below:By the end of the movie Cole will come to grips with his problem and Willis and Cole's mother will come to new realizations about themselves.This is a really well made move with great acting and it should hold your interest throughout regardless of its slow pace.",5,I Really Enjoyed it!,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,1823,"['Bruce', 'Willis', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'home', 'wife', 'one', 'evening', 'when', 'are', 'startled', 'intruder', 'bathroom', 'intruder', 'was', 'one', 'Willis', 'patients', 'who', 'had', 'asked', 'Willis', 'help', 'apparently', 'Willis', 'never', 'listened', 'Willis', 'reason', 'Willis', 'stomach', 'taking', 'own', 'life.The', 'next', 'scenes', 'follow', 'Willis', 'assigned', 'help', 'troubled', 'boy', 'who', '10', 'suspect', 'sometime', 'was', 'shot', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'later', 'movie', 'boy', 'Cole', 'been', 'doing', 'strange', 'things', 'school', 'drawing', 'pictures', 'dead', 'people', 'telling', 'teacher', 'government', 'used', 'hang', 'people', 'schoolhouse', 'Things', 'set', 'Cole', 'apart', 'other', 'kids', 'who', 'treat', 'outcast.Willis', 'first', 'encounters', 'Cole', 'church', 'Cole', 'know', 'there', 'try', 'help', 'Cole', 'distrustful', 'Willis', 'first', 'pretty', 'soon', 'Willis', 'able', 'convince', 'Cole', 'there', 'help', 'him.The', 'picture', 'moves', 'slow', 'pace', 'few', 'snippets', 'Cole', 'weird', 'behavior', 'coming', 'only', 'about', 'halfway', 'movie', 'Cole', 'Willis', 'why', 'way', 'Willis', 'thinks', 'Cole', 'explanation', 'sick', 'mind', 'later', 'will', 'be', 'convinced', 'are', 'heartwarming', 'scenes', 'Cole', 'mother', 'something', 'strange', 'Cole', 'mother', 'Willis', 'never', 'talk', 'Cole', 'explained', 'much', 'later', 'weird', 'way', 'Willis', 'wife', 'be', 'treating', 'Spoiler', 'end', 'movie', 'Cole', 'will', 'come', 'grips', 'problem', 'Willis', 'Cole', 'mother', 'will', 'come', 'new', 'realizations', 'themselves.This', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'move', 'great', 'acting', 'should', 'hold', 'interest', 'regardless', 'slow', 'pace']",The Sixth Sense VHS

And even if you did, wasn't it fun getting to the end anyway?  This is one heck of a movie.  It has a wonderfully realized plot,  believable characters who act like they really care about each other.  There's little to fault with this movie.  Bruce Willis again is  under-appreciated.  He got lost in all the hoopla over Haley Joel Osment.  But Bruce turns in a very multi-layered and controlled performance.  Haley  is just out of this world great!  Never have I seen a child actor who has  performed to this level.  Not once did I think Haley was acting.  He  definitely should have won the Oscar for supporting actor.  At his age,  what an accomplishment---to carry so much of this complex, involving film.  Those little shoulders did a fantastic job.  I'm looking forward to seeing  him in &quot;Pay Forward&quot; with Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt.  He's an  actor to reckon with!  Also, Toni Colette as Cole's mother is fabulous.  One of the few screen mothers who really seemed to be a mother.  Her  performance is &quot;the heart&quot; of the movie.  Watching her go through  her many layers of love, guilt, fear, and frustration, and yet maintain  that love for her troubled son is worth the price of the video!  Olivia  Williams as Willis' wife is also extremely effective in a smaller but  significant role.  Even after the movie ends, you want more.

It's very important to Cole because he wants to trust, and to tell his secret. Malcolm's answer &quot;I got an award once, from the mayor&quot; would seem to be a yes, but he's not so sure himself anymore.About a year earlier, Malcolm and his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) were at home celebrating his receiving the award when an ex-patient Vincent, no longer a child and violently disturbed - having broken in, surprises them from where he had been hiding in their bedroom. He is scared, inconsolable and very angry with Malcolm for having failed him. In a fit of anguish he shoots Malcolm and kills himself.Now a year later, Malcolm has concerns. Cole is exhibiting some of the same neuroses and signs of abnormal behavior reminiscent of Vincent. On top of that, he and Anna have grown distant, he can't seem to connect with her and he's definitely not helping Cole. But Cole, having come to trust Malcolm and encouraged by his gentleness and patience, is now ready to tell his secret... &quot;I see dead people. Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead&quot;. Ghosts! Not nightmares, he's not sleeping - Cole sees them all the time.At the mention of Ghosts some of us may be instantly turned off, especially if we do not much care for the use of Ghosts in movies - either for horror, as a gag or as a statement about the life beyond. Especially true if we don't believe in ghosts. The use of Ghosts here though, does not fall into any of these categories, and much more importantly it does not affect the plausibility or watchability of the movie in the least bit. We are drawn elsewhere. The action is with Cole and Malcolm and what is happening in their minds, psyches and relationships. Is Cole's mind slipping away into a state similar to Vincent's? Is Anna's love for Malcolm already gone? and back to where we began - Is the good doctor no longer any good, has he lost the ability to reach out and help?

I thought he would, but he does a wonderful job, as do all actors involved.  Yes there is a neat little (understatement) secret that reveals itself in  the end, but if you're perceptive, you might catch on early in the film.  As for the packaging of the DVD version, it has all the standard extras  like cast interviews/bios, deleted scenes, etc.  That's always nice and we  come to expect that.

If you have a nicer player, you may be able to &quot;Chapter  Skip&quot; over them, but the point is:  you shouldn't have to skip over  the previews and if I have to fast forward over them, I might as well be  watching the movie on my VCR!

474845,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,630573240X,Michael J. Mazza,"[2, 4]","&quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, is one of those films that has enjoyed both great critical acclaim and tremendous popular success. And it deserves them both: this is, simply, a great film. Shyamalan tells the story of Cole Sear (played by Haley Joel Osment), a little boy with a terrifying supernatural ability. He lives with his mother, a single parent (Toni Colette). Child psychiatrist Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) attempts to help the boy deal with the disturbing ramifications of his &quot;gift.&quot;&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a horror film that doesn't rely on monsters and gore: the horror here is largely psychological in nature. But the film ultimately transcends the horror genre; it is also a serious family drama that is told with intelligence and compassion. It is as much about love and communication as it is about fear.All the performances in the film are first rate. If you only know Bruce Willis as the star of hyperactive action flicks, be prepared for a revelation. He delivers a performance that is restrained, yet rich with emotional texture. Toni Colette is heartbreaking as the struggling mother.And then there's Haley Joel Osment. He is absolutely extraordinary in a performance that ultimately holds the whole film together. Although he was nominated for a supporting Oscar, I consider this a lead role in terms of screen time and centrality to the film. His chemistry with both Colette and Willis is absolutely electrifying; this kid is one of the best actors of any age group. Osment will frighten you, break your heart, and uplift your spirit in this role; his performance alone makes this film worth watching.The ingenious script has its own inner logic; Shyamalan creates an intimate mythos which is consistent and compelling. He uses a brilliant combination of low-tech effects and production details to enhance his story. And James Newton Howard's excellent score complements the film as a whole.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is one of those great films that rewards repeated viewings. Actually, I believe that a second viewing is absolutely essential.

It  helps the watcher develop a spooky and freakish mood which helps you enjoy  the film in a fun way. The features also helped me learn more about the  film, why wouldn't it? I enjoyed watching M. Night's first horror film  which I laughed vigorously. Among the features are deleted scenes which I  feel were neglected great. Osmont's performace alone in a scene entitled,  Toy Soldiers was just tear shedding and really made you believe in the  character. Look at me, the DVD has brought me to babble on. That's good I  guess. The film is wonderful and probably the best of '99. Performances by  Willis went un-noticed by the Academy, but people who've seen Willis in  films such as Die Hard will be surprised to find him just as great as  Osmont.

474851,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,630573240X,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 1]","What is with human beings and their attraction to the super-natural? Despite the quality of horror features going down the toilet for the past few decades, millions of people across the world flock to these films on opening weekends, whether they are on dates or a night out with their friends, to be scared and grossed out. Heck ? the investigation of the supernatural has become a billion dollar business for ?psychics? like John Edwards who have legions of fans buying their books, attending their shows, and buying into their ridiculous mumbo-jumbo ? but why do we do it? Is it natural curiosity into the concept of death? Is it the fear of something beyond our comprehension? Is it our natural insecurity and the paranoia that we not alone? There are no direct answers to those questions, and there may never be, but as long as Hollywood keeps making the focus of their films, we will come.The story centers on a boy who believes he can see ghosts and a psychiatrist who must find a way to help this child cope with his special ability that may unravel a mysterious truth not only for the boy but for himself as well. Dr. Malcolm Crowe is one of the best child psychiatrists in the city of Philadelphia. In fact, he was awarded a special honor by the mayor of Philadelphia himself ? the very same night a former patient of his named Vincent Grey breaks into his home. At first Malcolm struggles to remember him but as Vincent rambles on about details of the counseling, he begins to recall a young boy who shy, quiet, well behaved, and what he believed at the time was an inability to coup with the divorce of his parents. But Vincent believes that he has been cursed and Dr. Crowe has failed in promise to help the boy. Clearly at the end of his rope, Vincent Grey decides to end his life by shooting himself in the head but not before he gets one shot out on Dr. Crowe. Time passes and Malcolm Crowe returns to his job, though he has yet to fully recover mentally from the strange encounter. He is visiting a young boy by the name of Cole Sear ? an unusual little boy who hides out in a church and speaks Latin while playing with tiny soldier figures in between the benches. Cole?s mother who is separated from her husband is at her wits end. Not only does she have to balance two jobs to keep the small household supported but Cole?s alarming behavior has taken a huge toll on her ability to go about a normal routine with a calm mind. And don?t believe that Malcolm?s life is any less hectic ? not only is he desperately trying to redeem himself for the failure over Vincent Grey with young Cole but his marriage is failing and he is doing everything possible to help reconcile with his wife. But when young Cole reveals his secret that his has the ability to see ghosts, who want him to do things for them, Malcolm is reminded of Vincent Grey and that he will do anything he can to prevent Cole from meeting the same end. The story of The Sixth Sense stands alone as one of the best super-natural thrillers in years, if not of all time. Shymalan, who before this film was not known for this type of genre, truly makes a name for himself with this thought-provoking and riveting script. The ending is not quite as shocking to those who pay attention to the little bits and pieces Shyamalan places throughout the film to clue audiences into what is to come, but none the less it was disappointing either and that?s all that matters.The cast for the film, though large in a sense when considering the numerous amount of characters with screen-time less then two minutes, is small in scale, especially when one considers that the film mainly centers on the actions of Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis. Haley Joel Osment, who is best known for his small appearance in the Academy Award-winning Forrest Gump, showcases his uncanny ability for acting by successfully pulling off one of the most challenging performances a director can give a child of his age, let alone any actor with as less experience as he has on screen. By taking on the role of Cole Sear, Osment not only has to play the victim in the sense that he wants Dr. Crowe to make the ghosts go away, but he switches roles continually throughout the film from the victim to that of an encouraging hero. Along with that, the way he and Bruce Willis act off of each other is so natural that the audience becomes attached to these characters and becomes deeply involved into what happens around them. Bruce Willis, more known for his adrenaline powered roles in such action-dramas as the Die Hard series then films of this nature, proves to audiences once again, as he did in Quentin Tarantino?s Pulp Fiction, that can slip into the more emotionally charged roles with losing any of the masculine mystic that you find so blatantly his action films. And, borrowing a page from Alfred Hitchcock?s directing book, M. Night Shyamalan makes an appearance in the film as Dr. Hill, the doctor who examines Cole after he is trapped in a closet. It?s not a whole lot of screen-time but it?s a wonderful surprise for those who know what they are looking for.Overall, The Sixth Sense, despite lacking the exhilarating punch that had been promised as the film?s ending (if you paid attention to clues, it was kind of obvious), wipes the floor of its predecessors and redefines the genre that had been typically by mindless slasher flicks for far too long. This is not to say that the film?s ending is not a surprise ? to some it may be but for those who pay attention reasonably close to the clues placed throughout the film, it may come as a bit of a let down but not one that will ruin the entire film for you. Don?t go into this film with all the built-up hype the media and fellow movie-goers have place in your head. If you go into this film with a clear mind, not expecting anything more then an entertaining and intelligent thriller, then you will have a better appreciation for M. Night Shyamalan?s work then some people may have. Everything comes together so brilliantly in this film that is hard to find a film in the past few years that matches the exact effect The Sixth Sense is able to pull off ? the chilling musical score, brilliant performances, complex dialogue, intricate script, and clever direction, all of which work together and never seem to outbalance one another. If there anything to complain about this is that does tend to drag a little near the end but this is minor complaint that doesn?t match up exceedingly with the good that is presented in this film. The Sixth Sense is not strictly warranted to those who only believe in the concept of ghosts, but for those who enjoy the idea of being scared out of their seats even by a concept they themselves don?t believe in.",4,The Moose Hole - It's Good to See Dead People,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,6754,"['What', 'human', 'beings', 'attraction', 'super-natural', 'quality', 'horror', 'features',

The sad truth is that this film is a complete rehash of the earlier film &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;, from which is steals its structure and its 'knockout ending'.Granted, Tak Fujimoto has done a superb job with the cinematography, and the look and feel of the film are superb.  There are no over-the-top special effects, and everything that creeps you out is done in a very subtle and subversive manner.My biggest problem with this movie is that I just can't give it credit for being a copy-cat film.  It's one thing to re-engineer another film, but to do it and not give credit where credit's due is bang out of order.  I bet Adrian Lynne (the director of Jacob's ladder) is fuming.  Besides, could you really walk around for a whole year and not notice you're not getting served at restaurants and that no one is talking to you?  Also, if cold air only comes out of people's mouths when the dead people are angry, then why does it come out of Willis' wife at the end?? Well apparently the director of this movie didn't pay too much attention to these plot holes, because he had built his film on the structure and ending of another, and that is all he was probably concerned about.If this film had been original, I could have given it maybe 3 stars.If you liked the movie, you'll probably like the extras, but lookout for the bit on how the story line was conceived.

Watch the making of, and they explain everything, and how certain things were hints to the parts often overlooked or confused people, and never just watch this film once. The second time you'll notice more. This is a very intelligent film, and it ""gets"" those more who have had experiences with paranormal, death, loss, and grief, and even fear. I wouldnt say it's just a horror, but it's creepy enough to be called that, but it's also a drama, because at times haley joel osment's acting is so terrific that it's touching, espeically when he cries. I've never seen a more genuine actor at his age. He has alot of talent. And the parts where he was acting ""terrified"" was more realistic than i've ever seen in any movie. I think Bruce Willis was the perfect man to play malcom, because for some reason certain people, actors and actresses mesh well in movies, and you can sense the chemistry among the actors. Haley And Bruce were great together in this film. This movie is perfect in my opinion. No flaws as far as i am concerned. I love this movie and am glad that thousands and thousands of people appreciated this movie for what it is, and for those of you who could never appreciate this film, that's too bad. There are probably many life lessons you havent learned yet. Watch this movie in 5 years and if you still hate it, i almost feel bad for you. I also heard that some ghostly figures, (shadows) were seen during the making of this film that they never added in. I dont know if it's true, but i've heard of that happening before. I. E. Poltergeist, exoricist. Certain movies, bring a certain kind of energy, and to people who are involved in the making of these kind of movies. I think that, to make a good movie, you have to kind of live it, live the role, breathe, eat and sleep, the role you are given. You almost become that person you play in the movie, and by doing that you open your mind to things  you wouldnt normally.

Next to all those vacuous teen horror films it is a real gem.  The story follows child psychologist Willis as he tries to unearth the traumas of a small boy called Cole (Osmont) who claims to see dead people whilst he himself has troubles at home with wife Olivia Williams.What's crucial is that Shyamalan hasn't just created a horror shocker but has intensely studied human loss.  Indeed, it is this rather than the ghosts themselves that is the real horror.  Plus, it's a rare horror movie that doesn't only scare its audience but also move them, both of which `The Sixth Sense' manages to do.  The scares are also a lot more to do with tricky camerawork that will make you jump out of your seat than gut-wrenching horror.  This is itself makes it rise above all the other soulless movies that preceded it.Much has been made of Osmont's performance as the haunted child Cole.  Basically, all of the hype is correct, he perfectly judges the character and his performance is of the kind that etches itself on its audience's psyche.  Yet this certainly doesn't mean that the other talent on show here should go unnoticed.  Willis turns in his best ever performance in an understated, quietly touching role and Toni Collette makes you forget all about her brassy role in `Muriel's Wedding'.Perhaps what makes the movie so good though is the fact that it is a distinctly adult horror that genuinely frightens and moves its audience.",5,Outstanding Horror-Drama,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,1518,"['creepy', 'little', 'horror', 'movie', 'actually', 'good', 'deal', 'better', 'genre', 'suggests', 'Next', 'vacuous', 'teen', 'horror', 'films', 'real', 'gem', 'story', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Willis', 'unearth', 'traumas', 'small', 'boy', 'called', 'Cole', 'Osmont', 'who', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'whilst', 'troubles', 'home', 'wife', 'Olivia', 'Williams.What', 'crucial', 'Shyamalan', ""n't"", 'just', 'created', 'horror', 'shocker', 'intensely', 'studied', 'human', 'loss', 'Indeed', 'rather', 'ghosts', 'real', 'horror', 'rare', 'horror', 'movie', ""n't"", 'only', 'scare', 'audience', 'also', 'move', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'manages', 'do', 'scares', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'do', 'tricky', 'camerawork', 'will', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'gut-wrenching', 'horror', 'rise', 'other', 'soulless', 'movies', 'preceded', 'it.Much', 'been', 'made', 'Osmont', 'performance', 'haunted', 'child', 'Cole', 'Basically', 'hype', 'correct', 'perfectly', 'judges', 'character', 'performance', 'kind', 'audience', 'psyche', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'mean', 'other', 'talent', 'show', 'here', 'should', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'Willis', 'best', 'ever', 'performance', 'understated', 'quietly', 'touching', 'role', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'forget', 'brassy', 'role', 'Muriel', ""Wedding'.Perhaps"", 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'though', 'fact', 'distinctly', 'adult', 'horror', 'genuinely', 'audience']",The Sixth Sense VHS

474896,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,630573240X,Only-A-Child,"[4, 6]","""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) is generally regarded as a ghost story and that is what it seems to be during the first viewing. There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication; elements often incorporated into the genre. Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion.But with subsequent viewing(s) the fear factor diminishes and you become aware that this is not a ghost story so much as it is a film about grief; particularly the grief than comes from regret. With this realization comes the awareness that the real power of the film comes from a viewer's subconscious connection with this underlying theme. The object of the film is far more than just giving the audience a scare although it does a first-class job of doing just that. It can also alter your perception of the process of both living and dying.The spirits that seek out young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) do so because there is something they regret doing or not doing during their lives; something that will ease the grief of their passing (for both them and their loved ones). You have Krya's little sister asking Cole if Krya will come back and Cole answering ""not anymore"", after he has helped Krya.And then you have the grieving Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his grieving wife Anna (Olivia Williams): ""Once upon a time there was this person named Malcolm. He worked with children. He loved it. He loved it more than anything else. And then one night, he found out that he made a mistake with one of them. He couldn't help that one. And he can't stop thinking about it, he can't forget. Ever since then, things have been different. He's not the same person that he used to be. And his wife doesn't like the person that he's become. They barely speak anymore, they're like strangers. And then one day Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy, a really cool little boy. Reminds him a lot of the other one. And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy. 'Cause he feels that if he can help this new boy, it would be like helping that other one too.""The climatic scene in the car between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) ranks up with cinema's all-time best.Then again, what do I know?

474899,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,630573240X,OverTheMoon,"[3, 8]","This movie depends on two things. How much you figure out before it ends and how much you have invested yourself in this movie. The two go hand in hand. The truth is that many people figured out the ending within the first few minutes on the bases that they simply ""heard"" it had a great twist. It is actually not that hard to figure out even if you just hear the plot alone and couple that with the fact it has a twist. If you view this film without having heard anything beforehand you are in a much better position to enjoy it, but there is a margin out there who will get it and will only enjoy it because other people did not get it and there is some fun to be had in knowing that other people where played with. Do not believe for a moment that people who say they got it are lying about that. I know plenty of people who got it and the film thus did not have the desired impact that it retains throughout the whole slow affair for that final manipulation of the audience.The truth be told that the whole weight of this somewhat low-budget film is based on the twist. The actual production values are somewhat minimal. You can see that the producers of this flick had trimmed as much as they could on the budget knowing that the impact of the final reel would more than makeup for putting this flick out on the cost that it was made on. There was no risk involved in doing that but obviously it was a financial strategy that worked out for everybody involved. You can see that everyone was happy with the gamble and it paid off. Could you imagine if this film had a bunk ending or a twist that was not very good? The whole film then looks like Bruce Willis just hooked up with a film student for the hell of it.The actual acting on display here is not cutting edge but Haley Joel Osment does walk circles around everyone including Willis. Osment is a very important casting decision here. Without him it would loose some impact. The film's pace is dreadfully slow and it does stall at times. However if you are looking for a payoff then you will get a whooper of a payoff here, unless you fall into the marginal category who have got it and then must sit out the rest of this slow journey until your suspicions are finally unmasked.This is a great twist of a movie, but not such a great movie. Again the premise, plot and structure is based on that ending, a small gamble because of the strength of the twist, but still it leaves the vast majority of this movie somewhere around mediocre with limitations that do show themselves now and again. Sometimes the acting is actually not very good and is a little on the experimental ""new"" side which does not suite having an A-list actor at the helm.So the verdict here is five stars if you are oblivious to everything until the end but only three stars if you get it and must watch through the whole slow affair.",3,The Weight of Cold Air,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,2863,"['movie', 'two', 'things', 'How', 'much', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'invested', 'movie', 'two', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'truth', 'many', 'people', 'figured', 'out', 'ending', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'bases', 'simply', 'heard', 'had', 'great', 'twist', 'actually', 'not', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'even', 'just', 'hear', 'plot', 'alone', 'couple', 'fact', 'twist', 'view', 'film', 'having', 'heard', 'anything', 'beforehand', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'position', 'enjoy', 'margin', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'will', 'only', 'enjoy', 'other', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'knowing', 'other', 'people', 'where', 'played', 'Do', 'not', 'believe', 'moment', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'got', 'are', 'lying', 'know', 'plenty', 'people', 'who', 'got', 'film', 'thus', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'desired', 'impact', 'whole', 'slow', 'affair', 'final', 'manipulation', 'audience.The', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'whole', 'weight', 'somewhat', 'low-budget', 'film', 'based', 'twist', 'actual', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'somewhat', 'minimal', 'can', 'see', 'producers', 'flick', 'had', 'trimmed', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'budget', 'knowing', 'impact', 'final', 'reel', 'would', 'more', 'makeup', 'putting', 'flick', 'out', 'cost', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'risk', 'involved', 'doing', 'obviously', 'was', 'financial', 'strategy', 'worked', 'out', 'everybody', 'involved', 'can', 'see', 'everyone', 'was', 'happy', 'gamble', 'paid', 'off', 'Could', 'imagine', 'film', 'had', 'bunk', 'ending', 'twist', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'whole', 'film', 'then', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'just', 'hooked', 'up', 'film', 'student', 'hell', 'it.The', 'actual', 'acting', 'display', 'here', 'not', 'cutting', 'edge', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'walk', 'circles', 'everyone', 'including', 'Willis', 'Osment', 'very', 'important', 'casting', 'decision', 'here', 'would', 'loose', 'impact', 'film', 'pace', 'dreadfully', 'slow', 'stall', 'times', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'payoff', 'then', 'will', 'get', 'whooper', 'payoff', 'here', 'fall', 'marginal', 'category', 'who', 'have', 'got', 'then', 'must', 'sit', 'out', 'rest', 'slow', 'journey', 'suspicions', 'are', 'finally', 'unmasked.This', 'great', 'twist', 'movie', 'not', 'such', 'great', 'movie', 'Again', 'premise', 'plot', 'structure', 'based', 'ending', 'small', 'gamble', 'strength', 'twist', 'still', 'vast', 'majority', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'mediocre', 'limitations', 'do', 'show', 'now', 'again', 'Sometimes', 'acting', 'actually', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'little', 'experimental', 'new', 'side', 'not', 'suite', 'having', 'A-list', 'actor', 'helm.So', 'verdict', 'here', 'five', 'stars', 'are', 'oblivious', 'everything', 'end', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'get', 'must', 'watch', 'whole', 'slow', 'affair']",The Sixth Sense VHS

Prior to seeing &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, I would have described both the movie and Shyamalan as being over-hyped.Now that I've seen it, I have to admit that the bang-to-hype ratio is surprisingly high. This is an outstanding movie!What must it be like to be a small boy who &quot;sees dead people&quot;? As a former kid-with-an-overly-active-imagination who had a staircase to the attic in my bedroom closet, I never saw dead people, but I sure had my share of sleepless nights imaging to closet door opening on its own. I thought Haley Joel Osment's performance was extraordinary.I already knew the &quot;big twist&quot; before I saw &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, but I found that it didn't matter. I was able to enjoy the story and the performances on their own merits.With very little graphic gore and few jump-out-and-get-you moments, Shyamalan is able to keep the suspense level very high. Unlike most of the horror/suspense movies made today, which rely on a lot of technology, stunts, and effects, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a throwback. It could easily have been made in the 40s or 50s, given the level of technology required to pull it off. This is a movie-maker's movie, not a technologist's. I found it refreshing and all the more enjoyable for that.Shyamalan has a ways to go before he earns the title of &quot;The Next Spielberg&quot;, but he's well on his way to the top of the field.For a change, I can say without reservation: Believe the hype!!",5,Lives up to the hype,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,1527,"['am', 'always', 'skeptical', 'overly', 'hyped', 'films', 'directors', 'Prior', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'described', 'movie', 'Shyamalan', 'being', 'over-hyped.Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'admit', 'bang-to-hype', 'ratio', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'What', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'small', 'boy', 'who', 'quot', 'dead', 'people', 'quot', 'former', 'kid-with-an-overly-active-imagination', 'who', 'had', 'staircase', 'attic', 'bedroom', 'closet', 'never', 'saw', 'dead', 'people', 'sure', 'had', 'share', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'imaging', 'closet', 'door', 'opening', 'own', 'thought', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'performance', 'was', 'extraordinary.I', 'already', 'knew', 'quot', 'big', 'twist', 'quot', 'saw', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'story', 'performances', 'own', 'merits.With', 'very', 'little', 'graphic', 'gore', 'few', 'jump-out-and-get-you', 'moments', 'Shyamalan', 'able', 'keep', 'suspense', 'level', 'very', 'high', 'most', 'horror/suspense', 'movies', 'made', 'today', 'rely', 'lot', 'technology', 'stunts', 'effects', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'throwback', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'made', '40s', '50s', 'given', 'level', 'technology', 'required', 'pull', 'off', 'movie-maker', 'movie', 'not', 'technologist', 'found', 'refreshing', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'that.Shyamalan', 'ways', 'go', 'title', 'quot', 'Next', 'Spielberg', 'quot', 'well', 'way', 'top', 'field.For', 'change', 'can', 'say', 'reservation', 'Believe', 'hype']",The Sixth Sense VHS

If you truly aren't  interested in this question, you're either very young, or have missed the  point of life altogether! :-)If you're hoping for a blood-and-guts  horror film, or have come to see it because you've been pulled in by some  hype-machine, you'll probably be disappointed - its not a horror film, its  a thoughtful, suspenseful story - and there are few films ever made that  can live up to their marketing hype, so don't listen to it!  You'll nearly  always go away feeling ripped-off.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; features a  boy, Cole Sear, who is being terrified by visions of the dead, and a child  psychologist, Malcolm Crowe, who tries to help him - in part to exorcise a  failure in his past.  There was another boy that the psycologist had  treated who was haunted, but he failed to help him.We see this boy at  the beginning of the film, now grown into a young man - tortured and  terrified, the boy blames the psychologist for his years of torment... he  had been promised help by the doctor, and had been left to his demons by a  mis-diagnosis of emotional problems by a man who couldn't bring himself to  believe what his child patient was telling him.  The man, standing shaking  in his underwear, pulls out a gun (don't know where he was hiding that!)  and shoots Crowe in the stomach, then puts the gun to his own head and  fires.The next autumn/fall history begins to repeat itself with Crowes  new patient, Cole.  At first he can see no further than the rational,  believing him to be emotionally disturbed because of his parent's  separation - but just as he's about to give up on him, he reviews an audio  recording of an old session (with the boy who would later shoot him), and  comes across a faint voice that couldn't possibly have been there - a  Spanish voice, pleading and begging - &quot;I don't want to die!&quot;  Then begins Crowes attempts to really help the boy, by finding out what  these visitors want - and if there ever can be a way to make them  leave.If this film has one major flaw its that it skips over its subject  too fast.  The boy is supposed to be tortured, but we only ever see a  couple of ghosts - my sister has seen more ghosts than that!  And if  anything, there's no search for the answer to how to make them go away -  Crowe puts his finger on the solution immediately - and then the doctor's  theory is considered proved by just one ghost.That point aside, this is  one of the better films I've seen, simply for its thoughtful speculation of  the nature of ghosts, and the story's clever twists.  This is the kind of  film Twilight Zone fans will love, but maximum-body-count horror film fans  will probably find weak and slow...Be that as it may, the line &quot;I  can see dead people&quot; has got to be a film line destined to be in the  future books of world's greatest film lines!One last thing - to really  see this film  you'll need to watch it twice!",5,"Great film, but skipped through subject too fast.",950832000,"02 18, 2000",2000,3118,"['kind', 'subject', 'fascinating', 'anyone', 'individual', 'Earth', ""n't"", 'more', 'important', 'question', ""'what"", 'when', 'die', 'answer', 'eternal', 'truly', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'question', ""'re"", 'very', 'young', 'have', 'missed', 'point', 'life', 'altogether', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'blood-and-guts', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'see', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pulled', 'hype-machine', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'can', 'live', 'up', 'marketing', 'hype', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', ""'ll"", 'nearly', 'always', 'go', 'away', 'feeling', 'ripped-off.', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'boy', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'who', 'being', 'terrified', 'visions', 'dead', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'who', 'help', 'part', 'exorcise', 'failure', 'past', 'was', 'boy', 'psycologist', 'had', 'treated', 'who', 'was', 'haunted', 'failed', 'help', 'him.We', 'see', 'boy', 'beginning', 'film', 'now', 'grown', 'young', 'man', 'tortured', 'terrified', 'boy', 'psychologist', 'years', 'torment', 'had', 'been', 'promised', 'help', 'doctor', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'demons', 'mis-diagnosis', 'emotional', 'problems', 'man', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'believe', 'what', 'child', 'patient', 'was', 'telling', 'man', 'standing', 'shaking', 'underwear', 'out', 'gun', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'was', 'hiding', 'shoots', 'Crowe', 'stomach', 'then', 'gun', 'own', 'head', 'fires.The', 'next', 'autumn/fall', 'history', 'repeat', 'Crowes', 'new', 'patient', 'Cole', 'first', 'can', 'see', 'further', 'rational', 'believing', 'be', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'parent', 'separation', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'audio', 'recording', 'old', 'session', 'boy', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'shoot', 'across', 'faint', 'voice', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'have', 'been', 'Spanish', 'voice', 'pleading', 'begging', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'die', 'quot', 'Then', 'Crowes', 'attempts', 'really', 'help', 'boy', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'visitors', 'want', 'ever', 'can', 'be', 'way', 'make', 'leave.If', 'film', 'one', 'major', 'flaw', 'subject', 'too', 'fast', 'boy', 'supposed', 'be', 'tortured', 'only', 'ever', 'see', 'couple', 'ghosts', 'sister', 'seen', 'more', 'ghosts', 'anything', 'search', 'answer', 'how', 'make', 'go', 'away', 'Crowe', 'finger', 'solution', 'immediately', 'then', 'doctor', 'theory', 'considered', 'proved', 'just', 'one', 'point', 'aside', 'one', 'better', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'simply', 'thoughtful', 'speculation', 'nature', 'ghosts', 'story', 'clever', 'kind', 'film', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'maximum-body-count', 'horror', 'film', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'weak', 'slow', 'Be', 'may', 'line', 'quot', 'can', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'quot', 'got', 'be', 'film', 'line', 'destined', 'be', 'future', 'books', 'world', 'greatest', 'film', 'lines', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'really', 'see', 'film', ""'ll"", 'need', 'watch', 'twice']",The Sixth Sense VHS

We all knew that it's about seeing dead  people and actually this is the place where the plot ends. It's a film  about seeing dead people.Stephen King's 'Langoliers' was the scariest  movie for me for a long time. Watching it alone in a dark room mady you  shake in your boots; or at least until we couldn't see the little critters,  only hear them and feel the time disappearing. After watching this film I  had to admit that this was even scarier than time stoping. You don't  actually see it, the things that should scare you (like Fred Krueger did in  your childhood), you just feel the tension...and see dead people in their  true light for the first time in your life.Langoliers came when they  were starting the plane and then the magic ended. To me the magic of this  film vanished at an unknown point in the second half of it. I don't know  what was the trigger, but then I realized that it isn't scary anymore. And  even the ending wasn't what it was supposed to be - &quot;gotcha, you  didn't see it coming, did ya?&quot;Now I have seen it many times and it  is still there, the trigger. Even when I watch it in broad daylight I have  to chew at my fingers.

474910,AGK4BEIQ017HY,630573240X,P. I. Johnson,"[2, 3]","After an increasingly tiresome decade of ironic, self-satisfied and self-referential slashers (of exponentially decreasing quality since Scream), The Sixth Sense comes as manna from heaven (or hell!) for those of us who grew up revering The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Omen and the like. Like these great movies - which are its undeniable genre antecedents - The Sixth Sense plays it straight and unembarrassed with its classical horror themes of ghosts, clairvoyance and redemption beyond the grave. Given the brilliance, complexity and intelligence of Night Shyamalan's screenplay and direction, the movie needs no cheap eye-winking gimmicks to capture your attention and hold you riveted until its explosive revelation at the end. This is what going to the movies ought to be about - a compelling combination of intelligence and escapism and - for horror fans - some genuine shivers that far surpass the best of what the teenie-sequels can ever dream of offering. Bruce Willis is admirably low key in a performance of quiet confidence and power, and Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding) proves she's no one note wonder with a performance of the same power and conviction as that of Ellen Burstyn's classic turn in The Exorcist. Haley Joel Osment is surely the best child actor to ever grace the screen and delivers a performance of such maturity, depth and intelligence that its scary in and of itself to think how much this boy actually knows at his age to hit all the right notes so accurately with such adult material (although, here too, The Exorcist provides precedent through Linda Blair). But the accolades of all horror fans will surely go first and foremost to writer-director M. Night Shyamalan who has single-handedly saved the genre from been swallowed up by the sensibilities of the teen horror marketplace. This is - along with the usual suspects in this regard - one of the five best horror movies ever made and a proud asset to my own horror shelf. For classical horror fans wondering whether anything of comparable seriousness and intelligence has been out there during the slasher years, please make a point of also checking out Lewis Gilbert's criminally ignored Haunted (with Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale) on DVD as well - it's everything Jan de Bont's Haunting tried to be but wasn't.",5,Classical horror strikes back!,980208000,"01 23, 2001",2001,2310,"['increasingly', 'tiresome', 'decade', 'ironic', 'self-satisfied', 'self-referential', 'slashers', 'exponentially', 'decreasing', 'quality', 'Scream', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'as', 'manna', 'heaven', 'hell', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'revering', 'Exorcist', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Omen', 'like', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'undeniable', 'genre', 'antecedents', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'straight', 'unembarrassed', 'classical', 'horror', 'themes', 'ghosts', 'clairvoyance', 'redemption', 'grave', 'Given', 'brilliance', 'complexity', 'intelligence', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'movie', 'cheap', 'eye-winking', 'gimmicks', 'capture', 'attention', 'hold', 'riveted', 'explosive', 'revelation', 'end', 'what', 'going', 'movies', 'ought', 'be', 'compelling', 'combination', 'intelligence', 'escapism', 'horror', 'fans', 'genuine', 'shivers', 'far', 'best', 'what', 'teenie-sequels', 'can', 'ever', 'dream', 'offering', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'admirably', 'low', 'key', 'performance', 'quiet', 'confidence', 'power', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'one', 'note', 'wonder', 'performance', 'same', 'power', 'conviction', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'classic', 'turn', 'Exorcist', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'surely', 'best', 'child', 'actor', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'performance', 'such', 'maturity', 'depth', 'intelligence', 'scary', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'boy', 'actually', 'age', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'so', 'accurately', 'such', 'adult', 'material', 'here', 'too', 'Exorcist', 'precedent', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'accolades', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'surely', 'go', 'first', 'foremost', 'writer-director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'single-handedly', 'saved', 'genre', 'been', 'swallowed', 'up', 'sensibilities', 'teen', 'horror', 'marketplace', 'usual', 'regard', 'one', 'five', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'proud', 'asset', 'own', 'horror', 'shelf', 'classical', 'horror', 'fans', 'wondering', 'anything', 'comparable', 'seriousness', 'intelligence', 'been', 'there', 'slasher', 'years', 'please', 'make', 'point', 'also', 'checking', 'out', 'Lewis', 'Gilbert', 'criminally', 'ignored', 'Haunted', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'everything', 'Jan', 'de', 'Bont', 'Haunting', 'tried', 'be', 'was', ""n't""]",The Sixth Sense VHS

The most frustrating part of watching this movie is to resist the temptation of sharing the ending with  my friends &amp; family members.  The setting of &quot;The 6th Sense&quot;  is spot-on, haunting &amp; chilling throughout.  Just like a good book, the  story gradually flows through rather than hitting the viewers in the face  such as movies like &quot;The Haunting&quot;, &quot;The House on the  Haunted Hill&quot;.  I strongly believe that to make a horror movie works,  it should let the story does the talking, conjuring fear in the viewers of  things they don't &amp; can't see.  Isn't it true that imagination is our  own worst enemy?  Well, &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; starred Kevin Bacon  shares the same trait as &quot;The 6th Sense&quot; but we shouldn't forget  that &quot;The 6th Sense&quot; is the movie that started it all.

The celebration upstairs is due to the awarding by the mayor to her husband, a renowned child psychologist.

Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE has ranked high on my list of favorite films ever since its 1999 theatrical release.First of all, it hits close to home.  Why?  First off, Shyamalan graduated from Waldron Mercy Academy, my private Catholic school, back when it was Waldron Academy and all-boys.  Today, the nationally renowned school is coed.  Second, THE SIXTH SENSE is filmed in the bustling city of Philadelphia, PA, very close to where I lived.  I recognized most, if not all of the places shown in Shyamalan's thriller.That said, it didn't necessarily mean I was going to automatically enjoy the film.  At the age of 11, I was hasty to see it.  But my Daddy, as usual, bribed me into it, assuring me I wouldn't regret seeing the movie.""Whatever,"" I muttered as he dragged me to the neighborhood cinema.I had set my standards low.  I arrived in the theatre, expecting a Pepsi, a Hershey bar, and a nap.I was pleasantly surprised.  In fact, I was elated!The talented Bruce Willis takes on the role of psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, very distinguished in his profession.  Haley Joel Osment, newcomer to the big screen, plays Cole Sear, a disturbed 8 year-old.  His mother, up in arms about what to do with her withdrawn and unhappy son, calls Dr. Crowe to help sort out the situation.  Mrs. Sear, a single parent, is wonderfully played by Toni Colette, who brings life and significance to her character, giving off a near immaculate 3-dimensional performance.Cole is blessed.  Or is he cursed?  You decide.  He has been bestowed/cursed with the power of the sixth sense, a skill both ugly and horrible, in a sense.  Cole, with this magical skill, can help others.  Yet at the same time, his sixth sense haunts him to the point of insanity.  ""I see dead people,"" he eventually explains to Dr. Crowe.  Indeed, young Cole speaks the harrowing truth.  He sees ghostly apparations that haunt him by night and show themselves by day, terrifying and confusing him to no end.  Alas, Dr. Crowe is unprepared when Cole enlightens him with this information.Yet this new knowledge is a beginning for various journeys.  Together, the doctor and his young patient travel to places previously unbeknownst to them.  Their adventures lead them to both saddening truths and irrevocable consequences.THE SIXH SENSE proves to a fickle audience, namely America, that special effects aren't required to make a superb and memorable horror film.  M. Night Shyamalan's unforgettable effort (not his first, FYI) is bone chilling, dazzling, and beautiful, with performances that either launched careers or furthered them.  This film is a masterpiece, no matter how you try to look at it, and it deserved all 6 of its Oscar nods.

Although I'm hardly ever scared when it comes to horror films, I'd say this is one film that will freak out and terrify most people. But even though this film didn't scare me, I still really loved it.THE SIXTH SENSE is about a child pycholost (did I spell that right?) named Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). Malcolm cares for his patients, but when he fails one patient, a tragedy occurs. A few years later, Malcolm moves to Philideliphia and has a new patient: a 9-year-old boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who has the sixth sense - the ability to see &quot;dead people&quot; or &quot;spirits&quot; and communicate with them. Cole lives with his single young mother, and is frightened by the ghosts he sees because they &quot;make him do stuff&quot;. He wants them to go away, and Malcolm must help him make them go away because he doesn't want to screw up like he did with his last patient.THE SIXTH SENSE is an amazing film with awesome special effects and a strong, solid storyline and well-written screenplay. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely flawless and serpurb. Haley Joel Osment is definitely one of the best child actors I've seen since Macualey Culkin, and Bruce Willis gives off one of his greatest performances ever.I still feel THE SIXTH SENSE should have won some of the Oscars it had been nominated for, and it definitely should have won Best Picture and Haley Joel Osment should have won Best Supporting Actor.

I don't mean to slight the performances in the film - Haley Joel Osment is exceptional as the boy troubled by visions of the dead and Bruce Willis is suitably poignant in his role as the troubled psychologist. Also, I must commend director Shyamalan for his restraint in regards to &quot;horror effects&quot;. In this age of slash and bleed crap like &quot;Scream&quot; (1, 2 and 3 ad nauseum)any horror movie which goes a thoughtful, psychological route is to be applauded.So, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is well acted and reasonably intelligent. Why then did it leave me cold? Maybe, as I say, It was simply the mountains of hype. More likely it is simply that despite all efforts to tell a good story, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; suffers from too much style and not enough substance - feeling in the end like a Hollywood product and not a work of art. . .. . .

Who am I to disgree with the hundreds here who have heaped so much adulation upon this movie?P.S. &quot;A Stir of Echoes&quot;, starring Kevin Bacon and based on a novel by Richard Matheson, came and went in the overblown shadow of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; back in 1999.

By the way, since then, whenever we see a trailer of a film that looks just gawd-awful, one of us will lean over and whisper &quot;I see dead people.&quot;Yeah, this film was gawd-awful; the reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that Haley Joel Osmant is one of the few watchable child actors working right now.Frankly, I knew Bruce Willis was dead from watching the trailer; I went into the film knowing that from the beginning, and assuming that everyone knew that. It was about twenty-five minutes into that film before I realized that Dr. Mal didn't know he was dead. About fifteen more after that, until it dawned on me that that might be the point of the movie, and then I understood why the film didn't seem to have a plot. I whispered to my husband &quot;Do you think the director thinks we don't know that Bruce Willis is dead?&quot; He just shrugged.At least we got plenty of use out of our refillable popcorn tub and drink cups.I know this film has been getting rave reviews, and I also know that people have dwelt long and eloquently on the film's lack of gore and perceived style.I wonder if audiences are so starved for suspense films (or any films) without dissected teenagers or car-crashing, armor-piercing bullet fests, that anything with a hint of elegance is caught up like pennies tossed to urchins. We've seen people naked, filthy, bloody, mauled by dinosaurs, eaten by each other. Ho-hum. Style, finery, manners, with or without substance is the new hook. It's not that we've suddenly become sqeamish; I leaned forward with everyone to see what was in that rag of Josh's shirt in Blair Witch Project.

474935,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,630573240X,Robert Badgley,"[1, 6]","In my opinion The Sixth Sense(released Aug/99)is director M.Night Shayamalan's best effort to date.This movie combines wonderfully effective narrative ""trickery"" which sets the viewer up for a shocking,unexpected and powerful one-two punch of an ending.The films stars Bruce Willis as Dr Crowe,a renowned psychiatrist who lives in Philadelphia,PA.Having just received a prestigious award from the Mayor he and his wife are celebrating upstairs when an intruder is discovered.Dressed in all but his underwear the intruder continuously yells that the doctor let him down.What little Dr Crowe can glean is that this man in his youth was a former patient of his.As he switches into doctor mode trying to calm him,he pulls a gun out and shoots Crowe in the stomach.The scene next switches to the home of the Sears;single mom Lynn(Toni Collette) and her only son Cole(Haley Joel Osmont).Cole is a shy,picked on and bullied nine year old who is very troubled.He is carrying his pent up frustrations and thoughts around with him and keeping them all from everyone,including his poor mother.Dr Crowe enters the picture and decides to take little Cole on and try to help him with his dilemma.Over time and with patience Dr Crowe is let into Cole's world who admits to him that his secret is that he""sees dead people"".At first Dr Crowe is incredulous but over time he comes to believe Cole is actually seeing these things.One day at a party he and his mother attend,some bullies lock Cole in a small cubicle at the top of a winding staircase.His mother rescues him but he is taken to the hospital unconscious.The doctors find marks on his back and think his mother has abused Cole.It is these marks and other indications that Cole gives to Dr Crowe that makes the doctor think the ghosts may be trying to communicate something to him.When one night a small girl appears to Cole she tells him to go to her home,to her room and retrieve a small box.Cole,accompanied by Dr Crowe go to her home where her wake is in progress.Going to her room the girl gives Cole the box which he takes to the father.Inside is a tape which reveals that the wife had deliberately poisoned/murdered the poor girl.Dr Crowe and Cole have come to the realization that all these entities ever wanted was someone to listen to them.On the way home the next day Cole is with his mother in their car.An accident has occurred up ahead and the traffic is backed up.While waiting for it to clear Cole finally lets his feelings and his secret out to his mother.He tells her that someone got killed in the accident ahead because the person is standing next to his window.Then he reveals he can talk to ghosts and tells his mother that his grandmother often appears to him.In fact he imparts a message,from the Grandmother,to her only she could have ever known about.In tears both hug.Dr Crowe and Cole come to a parting of the ways as he has done all he can for Cole.The doctor's wife and he however appear to have become estranged and he pays a visit to his home.His wife is asleep on the couch and he sits beside her.Suddenly his wedding ring falls from her hands and he suddenly realizes he hasn't been wearing it.He thinks back to what Cole said that ghosts sometimes ""see only what they want to see"".Dr Crowe never survived the shot at the beginning of the movie!A video of their wedding is playing on the TV and he tells his wife he must go,letting her move on with her life and telling her he loves and misses her.The impact of that final moment cannot be understated.It is like getting a sledge hammer between the eyes.The director skillfullyweaved the story in such a way using every narrative trick in the book to throw us off the scent and he succeeded in spades.It brings two concurrent plots into alignment and successfully resolves  each characters dilemmas;each divergent character helping the other in their own way.Wonderful film,beautifully written and executed.Technically the film has been transferred well into its' 1:85:1 a/r.Extras include:storyboard to film comparison,,cast info,music and sound design,a look at the ""rules and clues"" in the movie,deleted scenes with an alternate and extended ending,interview and intros by the director,filmmaker and cast bios and a bit on publicity for the film.This top notch edge of your seat film includes many elements such as drama,love,thrills and pathos all wrapped around the subject of ghosts.Its' famous ending will leave you gasping and its' stars Colletee,Osment and Willis all turn in Oscar caliber performances throughout.This is highly recommended.",5,Still M.Night Shayamalan's best effort so far!,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,4576,"['opinion', 'Sixth',

That did it, I had to rent it.Staring Bruce Willis as child psychologist Malcolm Crowe and Haley Osment and the disturb child Cole Sear, The Sixth Sense is both a psychological thriller and a horror movie at the same time.  Terrifying visions of dead people haunts the child, Cole. He has learned to repress what he sees for fear of being called insane.  So at first, we see it as a psychological thriller.  Later, we learn that the visions are real, so perhaps we are watching a horror flick, but as the move progresses it never degenerates into a silly horror movie, but keeps its psychological edge.Although Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors, I am afraid that I have underestimated his acting ability.  This is an outstanding movie that grabs your attention and does not let go until the final credits roll.  And the ending, oh yes, it was a surprise- I did not see it coming.  If you have not seen this movie, rent it now.  You will want to watch it several times.  It is that good.

But there is much, much more to the story, but it is not my place to tell it here.

The ending ruins the mystery. Without the  revelations at the end the movie would have more staying power. Those who  have seen it will know what i mean.From an entertainment perspective the movie is great. The acting is good not great and the  directing is superb. The scenes and camera angles really enhance the tone.  There are some cheap attempts to startle you and keep you on the edge but  they don't over do it. The cole character is totally unrealistic. This is a  little 9 year old boy who sees dead people! Most of these dead people bear  the injuries of their demise. One visitor is a boy with half the back of  his head blown off who asks cole if he wants to play with a gun. Despite  this cole is no complete basket case. Rather he is courageous and almost  serene at times, even when he is telling the willis character that these  visions may have the intent of doing him harm. At times this nine year old  who sees dead people talks like a psychologist trying to analyze himself.Never the less this is a fine movie with thrills and mystery.

The acting is generally pretty good and the photography, while not exactly groundbreaking, is intelligent and nicely  done.  The direction of the actors is pretty impressive, too, and  occasionally even unique.  I can see this director making a really good  film at some point if he pays a bit more attention to his script.  Unfortunately, midway through the movie it's already apparent that the  story just doesn't make any sense.  The &quot;twist&quot; ending is fairly  easy to figure out before the end and is both intriguing and then silly  once you think about it.  It certainly doesn't wrap up much of anything in  the movie.  I had quite a few questions at the end --- most of which could  only be answered in ways that would seriously upset the dramatic structure  of the picture.  Bruce Willis is fine --- he basically steps aside to let  the kid do his business.  Toni Colette is excellent as usual --- quite  effective in a relatively underwritten role.  The kid is impressive, but  seems to have picked up a few bad habits early.  He is really ACTING --- he  seems like an adult actor, which is the main reason he impressed so many  viewers.  I'd be curious to see what he can do with a different director.  I only hope he doesn't get ruined by the Hollywood system, because he does  seem to have the potential to become a really great actor.  Quite  sensitive-seeming.  All in all, the movie was pretty entertaining ---  definitely held my interest.  It just didn't make a lot of sense; I'm all  for a bit of ambiguity, but the things that were ambiguous about this movie  seemed to be the result of laziness.  I feel a little bad accusing a  filmmaker of laziness --- perhaps he's just more interested in other  aspects of filmmaking.

It's a pretty good film, but the hype surrounding it is excessive, and not to mention,  undeserved. I didn't really think of it as a horror movie, more of a drama  with spooky undertones, and that is why the film disappointed me. The whole  ghost aspect of it was quite weak, like it had no power or energy . Sure it  had an eerie atmosphere, and one &quot;jump&quot; scene, but that was  pretty much it. The film also felt kinda wooden at times, and generally  moved at an all too slow pace. However, negative points aside, &quot;The  Sixth Sense&quot; boasts some good performances and a strong emotional  sense. Bruce Willis is good, but it is Haley Joel Osment who steals the  show, his performance as the tortured boy is flawless. I also found the  film to be quite moving, especially the last scene between Osment and his  mother. The famous &quot;twist&quot; at the end is also something to  appreciate. So in all, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is pretty good, it's  strengths overcome it's weaknesses, but unfortunately, media hype has made  it out to be a better movie than it actually is.",3,"Overrated, but still worth watching - 7/10",950313600,"02 12, 2000",2000,1225,"['Okay', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'far', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'films', '1999', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'either', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'excessive', 'not', 'mention', 'undeserved', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'drama', 'spooky', 'undertones', 'why', 'film', 'disappointed', 'whole', 'ghost', 'aspect', 'was', 'quite', 'weak', 'had', 'power', 'energy', 'Sure', 'had', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'quot', 'jump', 'quot', 'scene', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'film', 'also', 'felt', 'kinda', 'wooden', 'times', 'generally', 'moved', 'too', 'slow', 'pace', 'However', 'negative', 'points', 'aside', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'good', 'performances', 'strong', 'emotional', 'sense', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'good', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'who', 'show', 'performance', 'tortured', 'boy', 'flawless', 'also', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'moving', 'especially', 'last', 'scene', 'Osment', 'mother', 'famous', 'quot', 'twist', 'quot', 'end', 'also', 'something', 'appreciate', 'So', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'pretty', 'good', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'unfortunately', 'media', 'hype', 'made', 'be', 'better', 'movie', 'actually']",The Sixth Sense VHS

I thought I wouldfinally see a decent horror flick, after all the other trash I've had to suffer through in the horror genre recently. The first 1/3 was decent drama, building the story. The second 1/3 was pretty good suspense. The last 1/3 destroyed the whole film. The whole concept of the boy essentially becoming ghost psychiatrist was beyond stupid, and removed any previous aspects of horror.  Having ghosts appear to say &quot;Tell dad that mom put draino in my soup&quot;, and the like, was just dumb. Had it all been evil intentions, the movie would have been much more effective, in a positive horror movie way. I can't wait 'til the sequel, when they run even shorter on ideas and have ghosts appear saying &quot;Tell Aunt Edna that the car keys she lost in 1984 are behind the clothes dryer&quot;. The awful &quot;Grandma visits me and tells me she's proud of you everyday&quot;, was so motivated to mass appeal that I was sick. Always have to have that little irritating &quot;heart warming&quot; touch, don't they. Watching disfigured ghosts walk away from the boy after their &quot;session&quot; made this movie look more like a bad comedy! The final scene was completely unforgivable. I was amazed at what a huge hit this garbage became, but considering what movies do become hits I should have expected it. Simply AWFUL!

474964,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,630573240X,Scrimshaw,"[0, 0]","In an era of cinema filled with stupidity, trashiness, violence, and cruelty, The Sixth Sense manages to stand out, for it's own time and even more so today, as a stunning example of serious cinema at it's finest. The Sixth Sense, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan back in his prime as a director, is a psychological horror/drama which focuses on a troubled 9 year old boy named Cole Sear, played exquisitely by Haley Joel Osment, who is able to see and interact with dead people, and his relationship with an equally troubled child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, played by Bruce Willis. While this film is often advertised as a horror movie in reality it's more of a supernatural drama with elements of psychological horror, or to put it more specifically, a drama film with some scary scenes thrown in. Just as there are comedy-dramas or tragicomedies, films which are basically dramas with some extra humor added in to lighten the overall mood, The Sixth Sense is a drama film with some horror added in to demonstrate fully to the viewer the terrible effect Cole's ""sixth sense"" has had on his life, rendering him a tortured soul with no one to turn to for guidance or consolation since many people don't even believe ghosts exist let alone have the ability to see and interact with them! While there are in fact many thoroughly frightening scenes in this film, this film had me crying more than it had me frightened, and I can't remember the last time a ""horror"" movie did that. So even if this film had some cliched scares as one person said in a Youtube review I saw, it still succeeds as a powerful, tragic drama focusing on common human fears and concerns such as our fear of death and the unknown, most people don't understand Cole, they label him as a freak and would probably call him that even more if he told them about his sixth sense. Malcolm, who's having problems of his own, in addition to having a young boy telling him that he can see ghosts, now has added anxiety to deal with as he slowly starts to believe that Cole may be telling the truth after all when he looks back over some old audio recordings of his old patient Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg), as a child, he realizes that he may have been afflicted with the same ability that Cole has, which is why he ""failed"" him and why he broke into Malcolm's house and shot him in the opening scene. Overall, The Sixth Sense is a gripping, suspenseful, emotional, dramatic, and scary film that is much more than a simply ghost story, it's a film that asks the question of whether we truly ever die and what happens to us and the people we love after we die, do we truly ""die"" or does some part of us live on, possibly to suffer and linger from unfinished business on the earthly plane, or simply unable to move out of the darkness and into the light.",5,"More Drama than Horror, But Still Excellent",1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,2826,"['era', 'cinema', 'filled', 'stupidity', 'trashiness', 'violence', 'cruelty', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'stand', 'out', 'own', 'time', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'today', 'stunning', 'example', 'serious', 'cinema', 'finest', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'written', 'directed', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'back', 'prime', 'director', 'psychological', 'horror/drama', 'troubled', '9', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'named', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'played', 'exquisitely', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'who', 'able', 'see', 'interact', 'dead', 'people', 'relationship', 'equally', 'troubled', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'film', 'often', 'advertised', 'horror', 'movie', 'reality', 'more', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'elements', 'psychological', 'horror', 'put', 'more', 'specifically', 'drama', 'film', 'scary', 'scenes', 'thrown', 'Just', 'are', 'comedy-dramas', 'tragicomedies', 'films', 'are', 'basically', 'dramas', 'extra', 'humor', 'added', 'lighten', 'overall', 'mood', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'drama', 'film', 'horror', 'added', 'demonstrate', 'fully', 'viewer', 'terrible', 'effect', 'Cole', 'sixth', 'sense', 'had', 'life', 'rendering', 'tortured', 'soul', 'one', 'turn', 'guidance', 'consolation', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'exist', 'let', 'alone', 'have', 'ability', 'see', 'interact', 'are', 'fact', 'many', 'thoroughly', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'film', 'film', 'had', 'crying', 'more', 'had', 'frightened', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'horror', 'movie', 'did', 'So', 'even', 'film', 'had', 'cliched', 'scares', 'one', 'person', 'said', 'Youtube', 'review', 'saw', 'still', 'powerful', 'tragic', 'drama', 'focusing', 'common', 'human', 'fears', 'concerns', 'such', 'fear', 'death', 'unknown', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Cole', 'label', 'freak', 'would', 'probably', 'call', 'even', 'more', 'told', 'sixth', 'sense', 'Malcolm', 'who', 'having', 'problems', 'own', 'addition', 'having', 'young', 'boy', 'telling', 'can', 'see', 'ghosts', 'now', 'added', 'anxiety', 'deal', 'slowly', 'believe', 'Cole', 'may', 'be', 'telling', 'truth', 'when', 'back', 'old', 'audio', 'recordings', 'old', 'patient', 'Vincent', 'Gray', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'child', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'afflicted', 'same', 'ability', 'Cole', 'why', 'failed', 'why', 'broke', 'Malcolm', 'house', 'shot', 'opening', 'scene', 'Overall', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'gripping', 'suspenseful', 'emotional', 'dramatic', 'scary', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'simply', 'ghost', 'story', 'film', 'question', 'truly', 'ever', 'die', 'what', 'people', 'love', 'die', 'do', 'truly', 'die', 'part', 'live', 'possibly', 'suffer', 'linger', 'unfinished', 'business', 'earthly', 'plane', 'simply', 'unable', 'move', 'darkness', 'light']",The Sixth Sense VHS

There are many features packed into the DVD that make it work a purchase and not just a rental.For those who haven't seen the movie and don't think this film is really their genre, I strongly suggest seeing the film for just one reason: Haley Joel Osment. This kid is absolutely the most incredible child actor on the scene today. He is so believable as the troubled Cole Sear, the realization that you're watching a film vanishes. Toni Collette's performance as Cole's mother is also riveting.The DVD is feature packed, but my less than perfect rating comes from the forced commercials. You can not skip them but are forced to fast forward through them. Don't get me wrong, I love movie previews. I get to movies early so I can see them, but every single time I pop in the DVD? That's fine for a rental, but not when I have paid the purchase price for a disc, should I have to endure 15 minutes worth of trailers before getting to the menu! I had some friends over a few nights this week and every group that came over wanted to see this movie and every single time we had to sit through half a dozen movie previews.Despite the forced commercials, this was a great film. A story of troubled spirits, in this world and the next, all looking for love and understanding. Seeing Cole's life as the misfit in school is all too reminiscent of how heartless children can be to other children, and how other children can be easily crushed, humiliated and tortured, without the help of dead folks walking around to boot.The deleted scenes are powerful, but it's understandable why they were cut. Watching the first film by the director that he shot when he was 12 is cute and inspiring to young filmmakers or young people with any high aspirations. If a kid can make a movie that cheesy and a few years later (M.

The film also cleverly  includes the sub-plots of ethical issues as well as poignant, misting-up  scenes like the car accident-related scenes where Cole reveals his mother'  s childhood secrets to her.Where death drives the plot, love somehow  finds a way for apart lovers as well as bridges life and death to discover  hidden truth-in-itself, and the world beyond our clear scientific  explanation exists, The Sixth Sense is certainly the BEST THRILLER / HORROR  of 1999.Have a nice day. - SP",4,THE SIXTH SENSE: The Best Thriller / Horror of 1999,958003200,"05 11, 2000",2000,1205,"['fine', 'performances', 'rendered', 'spooky', 'kid', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'witty', 'screenplay', 'smart', 'twist', 'ending', 'film', 's', 'overall', 'dark', 'ambience', 'portrayed', 'Fujimoto', 'Taku', 'sublime', 'cinematography', 'have', 'admit', 'especially', 'first', 'week', 'big', 'screen', 'release', 'US', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 's', 'viewer-pulling', 'magnetic', 'power', 'nearly', 'US', '03', 'centimillion', 'blockbuster', 'wouldn', 't', 'have', 'come', 'far.The', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'incredible', 'film', 'properly', 'portrayed', 'overlapped', 'realms', 'LIFE', 'DEATH', 'eyes', 'sorrowful', 'depressed', 'child', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'therapy', 'session', 'care', 'award-winning', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'shot', 'FAILED', 'case', 'film', 'also', 'cleverly', 'sub-plots', 'ethical', 'issues', 'as', 'well', 'poignant', 'misting-up', 'scenes', 'car', 'accident-related', 'scenes', 'where', 'Cole', 'mother', 's', 'childhood', 'secrets', 'her.Where', 'death', 'plot', 'love', 'somehow', 'way', 'apart', 'lovers', 'as', 'well', 'bridges', 'life', 'death', 'discover', 'hidden', 'truth-in-itself', 'world', 'clear', 'scientific', 'explanation', 'exists', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'certainly', 'BEST', 'THRILLER', '/', 'HORROR', '1999.Have', 'nice', 'day', 'SP']",The Sixth Sense VHS

This ex-patient, who is now an adult, claims that he knows what causes our fear when we are alone.  He does not elaborate, but then shoots the doctor and then turns the gun on himself.  A year later we find the doctor attempting to help another child who exhibits the same symptoms that the ex-patient had, apparently in order to try to redeem himself from his incapacity to help the first patient.

First the acting is the best I have seen in any kind of suspense/supernatural thriller/horror film since &quot;The Exorcist.&quot; Bruce Willis turns in his fine performance on the level with his performances in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;12 Monkeys.&quot; He is an intense, loving husband, and caring helper. Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment finish out the main trio of actors, both turning in Oscar-worthy performances that suspend disbelief and bring you into to the wide range of emotions used on the director's and screenwriter's palette.Then there is the story. There are layers and layers to this story, yet the director carefully unravels them to a climactic ending that in the hands of a lesser director could have ended up being one big mess. M. Night Shyamalan lets us feel Cole's pain and torment without resorting to the sappy music and emotional manipulation used by many other popular directors. He develops the relationship of Cole and his mother, essentially a subplot, and weaves it seamlessly into the main plot where you can hardly tell the two apart. The delicate relationship between Malcolm and his wife gives the audience insight into the vulnerabilities of Willis' character. Scary with a heart.The soundtrack is understated but extremely effective. Eerie and chilling. And the DVD version has more special features than 95% of the new releases on the current market. You will understand more about how this movie was made after seeing the special features from storyboarding to marketing.

474986,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,630573240X,S. Schell,"[3, 5]","August is typically the month chosen for studios to dump films considered too poor to compete against the bigger summer vehicles and too weak to war with fall releases.  The irony of &#65533;The Sixth Sense&#65533; being released during this month is all the more peculiar when one hears of its $8 million triumph on opening day, not to mention curtailing a $30 million mark its first weekend.  Screening amidst blockbusters like &#65533;Runaway Bride&#65533;, &#65533;The Iron Giant&#65533; and the much-discussed horror mockumentary &#65533;The Blair Witch Project&#65533;, the success of &#65533;The Sixth Sense&#65533; surprised not only its skeptical audiences but its humble filmmakers as well.Action buff Bruce Willis stars as the unruffled child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, a man who has spent the last ten years devoting his life to the mental health of Philadelphia&#65533;s troubled children.  After ogling a plaque of commendation given to him by the city&#65533;s mayor for his painstaking services, he and his wife Anna (Williams) retire to their bedroom, drunk on wine and ready for a romantic tryst.  To their surprise, they find their window shattered and their phone beeping urgently off the hook.  A half-naked intruder lurks in their adjoined bathroom, a gleaming handgun lying dormant in the sink.  The intruder tearfully reveals himself as Vincent Grey, a former patient who never found peace.  Malcolm desperately tries to placate the hysterical young man but Vincent fires a round through his abdomen before turning the gun on himself.The story leaps to the following year, the incident having irrevocably damaged Malcolm and Anna&#65533;s marriage.  Unable to repair the breach in their stunted communication, Malcolm busies himself with a new client, one whose traits are eerily parallel to that of Vincent.  The enigmatic youngster this time &#65533;round is Cole Sear (Osment), an oft-morose elementary-schooler whose permeable eyes disclose the terror and mysteries of the netherworld.  Not only is Cole oddly intuitive but he also has the power to see and communicate with restless phantoms, entities that consistently make their presences known in the dusky apartment that he and his mother Lynn (Colette) share.  Both Malcolm and Lynn assume Cole&#65533;s behavior is rooted in the emotional pangs of his parents&#65533; divorce, but they are sorely mistaken and one day the terrified tot exhales &#65533;I see dead people&#65533; to the stone-faced shrink, a rivulet of tears cascading down his porcelain cheeks.  It is at this point that Shyamalan grabs us by our shirt collars and pulls us closer towards the portico of restless spirits, revealing to us their many macabre but misunderstood worlds.This subdued paranormal yarn literally became a theatrical juggernaut overnight and many people were compelled to see it a second or third time just to spot director M. Night Shyamalan&#65533;s clues to the gasp-inducing denouement.  I remember sitting in the theater with my husband and hearing him incredulously whisper &#65533;Holy s**t!&#65533; as the last five minutes of SS unfolded, hitting the audiences&#65533; collective realization like a sledgehammer.  Like the rest of the world, I was mesmerized by 11-year-old Osment&#65533;s unbelievably mature performance and I admit I was a little disappointed when he didn&#65533;t even receive an Academy Award nomination for his flawless work. However, I didn&#65533;t overlook the rest of the cast&#65533;s efforts and I was very pleased by the performances from both &#65533;Die Hard&#65533; trilogy star Bruce Willis and his Australian co-star Toni Collette (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress).  Willis had ventured into chancy territory before undertaking the complicated role of Malcolm Crowe, choosing character roles like high-strung mortician Ernest Menville in the black comedy &#65533;Death Becomes Her&#65533; and quirky car salesman Dwayne Hoover in the Kurt Vonnegut-adapted &#65533;Breakfast Of Champions&#65533;.  Collette had a shorter but nevertheless impressive resume, Shyamalan having enjoyed her as Muriel Heslop in the 1994 comedy &#65533;Muriel&#65533;s Wedding&#65533;.  Olivia Williams hopped onto the project after starring in the Costner flop &#65533;The Postman&#65533; and the independent comedy &#65533;Rushmore&#65533;.  The biggest casting surprise however was former &#65533;New Kids On The Block&#65533; member Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Grey, the ex-singer-turned-actor barely recognizable due to his emaciated physique (he shed a dangerous total of 45 lbs. for the part).Some people complained about knowing the secret only halfway through, saying Shymalan made it too easy to guess what was going on and/or gave too much away.  Only the people who allowed themselves to be consumed by the director&#65533;s languid but intriguing style and the riveting performance from Osment were shocked, but they were pleasantly surprised as well by how carefully he concealed the truth.  So to the critics who pieced together the theoretically palpable puzzle: good for you.  Just don&#65533;t ruin it for the rest of us who would prefer to enjoy the film for its imagination and talent rather than embarking on a rabid search for its technical flaws.",5,Spirited by

O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","Among the best ghost stories ever told, The Sixth Sense succeeds mightily as a horror movie, a relationship drama, and a spiritual thriller.  In arguably his best role, Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a dedicated psychologist still haunted by his inability to help a disturbed patient who later took his own life.  Years later, he's in for the challenge of his career when he meets a deeply frightened and disturbed little boy named Cole (Haley Joel Osment, in an award-worthy vituoso performance) who seems at first to be plagued by the same kind of mental problems that hounded Crowe's former (later suicidal) patient.  Part of his determination to help Cole is to try and redeem himself for what he perceives as his failure in the other case, but most of it is that he just puts his all into it for every case, and Willis is great at projecting the compassion and fear he feels for his new young patient who continues to spiral deeper, while Osment is just magnificent as a lovable little child who's scared out of his wits by forces beyond his understanding, and not knowing who to trust, or who's ever going to believe him.  Both actors elicit tremendous empathy for their characters, and the supporting cast shines pretty brightly too.The doctor bit by bit learns more about the nature of the boy's delusions, carefully prying little hints and pieces of information out of his scared charge without forcing it and driving him deeper into his shell.  But Dr. Crowe may be in for far more than he ever bargained for, as he begins - almost against his will - to have to consider the fact that Cole's fears may not be delusions at all.  The scene in which Cole finally confides the truth of what he 'sees' with his special sense to the doctor is an absolute classic.  As Crowe tries to help him - and tries to figure out exactly where he stands on what he's beginning to suspect (which is everything his training has told him not to put stock into), Cole begins to sense a purpose behind his experiences and begins trying to understand what's behind the whole phenomenon, and what his 'role' in it is.Excellent from start to finish, and if you're one of the few people on the planet not to already know the genuinely shocking twist ending, that's all the more reason to get it and see it as soon as possible.

Some magazine my wife had read blew the ending for her, but she still cried up a storm.  The film is THAT moving.  I have to agree with the Amazon Staff Review.  The excellence of this film  is in it's execution.  The plot has been utilized over and over again.  Some one (in this case a little boy) is seeing ghosts and has to perform  services for them so that they can &quot;move on&quot;.  At first the kid  is thought to be disturbed, but with the help of his psychiatrist he is  able to come to terms with his gift and move on with his life.  Think  Ordinary People meets The Haunting.How this film is shot is where the  payoff comes from.  The use of camera angles and perspective is amazing.  The cabinet scene made us both jump out of our chair and there was no  special effect.  Just good film making.I had heard a rumor that a sequel  may be in the works, but not for a few years so that the kid playing the  lead character can grow up a bit and reprise his role as a teenager.  I  vote yes for this.

Melvin,"[1, 1]","In this summer's proliferation of scary movies, The Blair Witch Project got all the hype, The Haunting got all the fancy schmany special effects, and The Sixth Sense won the acclaim of moviegoers and critics alike. This  film is the best of the new crop scary movie flicks (the aforementioned, as  well as Stigmata and Stir of Echoes.Willis plays a kiddie shrink who  failed once and is determined not to make the same mistake for the special  but troubled little child played by Osmet (Forest, Jr. from Forest Gump).  However, he can never be prepared for the revelation Osmet makes to him. In  a scene that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end he  confesses to Willis in a raspy whisper, &quot;I see dead  people.&quot;What progresses are a series of images that are lackluster  in special effects, but so well-set-up they will literally scare the hell  out of you. It is a non-stop adrenaline ride from then on out. For the  first time since I saw The Exorcist at 16, I felt uneasy when I cut the  lights off and settled into my bed.There are some holes in the plot and  a few melodramatic moments, but all in all this movie is fantastic. There  are two particular bright spots that outshine its other traits, however.  The first is Osmet. A child of his age in such a role would normally play  it very melodramatic and unconvincing, but he is soft-spoken and as  realistic as any other actor I have seen. Because of his age, I think this  is one of the best performances of the year (nuge, nudge, Academy). The  other bright spot is the twist at the end that will literally make your  head spin.

474996,AI0MXXUR866II,630573240X,Stephen Pospisil,"[0, 0]","When a child psychologist (Willis) is shot by a former patient he begins to reconsider his treatment ideals. The redemption for his failure he seeks in his newest patient (Osment) who displays emotions and fears far to familiar to the former failure.M. Night Shyamalan may not have had any  truly notable films before this endeavor, but with &quot;The Sixth  Sense&quot; he establishes a strong foothold in the Hollywood circle. His  clever and absorbing storyline stands as only a small piece of this  elaborate puzzle. The true force driving the film is its focus on  character.Instead of following the traditional paths of the  supernatural, or wandering off into more obscure areas, the movie remains  simple and focused, always studying the characters and their reactions to  the situations. It never goes out of its way to thrill the viewer, all of  the thrills come from the terrified, charming face of Osment.Who could  have figured a child would outshine a major Hollywood name, perhaps only  Shyamalan did. Haley Joel Osment steps on the stage shortly into the film  and immediately fills the surreal atmosphere of the past with a vigorously  subtle mysteriousness. Claiming to see &quot;dead people&quot;, Osment is  wrought with woe and fears, but the caring child is hardly concerned with  himself. In fact his greatest fear is for his mother how his unusually  cruel situation is slowly driving her toward madness.While Willis  strolls through the movie with a believable and serene atmosphere (until  the end's final twist, which is questionable when considering some of the  previous sequences), he is always several steps behind Osment's truly  formidable presence.Never does the pace excell, nor does it let up.  Slowly and carefully it spins the story that intertwines these somewhat  &quot;lost&quot; souls and the unique ending situation that binds the duo.  Certain scenes provide gasp-worthy reactions at just the right time to  prevent the movie from slacking, but never does it let these scenes drag  into a horror oriented atmosphere.A clever use of colors (examined on  the DVD's extras, which are quite nice and provide a decent length of bonus  material), some tender and affectionate dialogue, and deeply realistic  characters keep what could have been just a &quot;decent&quot; movie at the  &quot;terrific&quot; level. Rather, Osment should be mostly credited with  the true praise, his performance simply swept the screen.",4,"Intelligent, Well-Paced Suspense",957225600,"05 2, 2000",2000,2455,"['When', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Willis', 'shot', 'former', 'patient', 'reconsider', 'treatment', 'ideals', 'redemption', 'failure', 'newest', 'patient', 'Osment', 'who', 'displays', 'emotions', 'fears', 'far', 'familiar', 'former', 'failure.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'truly', 'notable', 'films', 'endeavor', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'strong', 'foothold', 'Hollywood', 'circle', 'clever', 'absorbing', 'storyline', 'stands', 'only', 'small', 'piece', 'elaborate', 'puzzle', 'true', 'force', 'driving', 'film', 'focus', 'character.Instead', 'following', 'traditional', 'paths', 'supernatural', 'wandering', 'off', 'more', 'obscure', 'areas', 'movie', 'simple', 'focused', 'always', 'studying', 'characters', 'reactions', 'situations', 'never', 'way', 'thrill', 'viewer', 'thrills', 'come', 'terrified', 'charming', 'face', 'Osment.Who', 'could', 'have', 'figured', 'child', 'would', 'outshine', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'name', 'perhaps', 'only', 'Shyamalan', 'did', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'steps', 'stage', 'shortly', 'film', 'immediately', 'surreal', 'atmosphere', 'past', 'vigorously', 'subtle', 'mysteriousness', 'Claiming', 'see', 'quot', 'dead', 'people', 'quot', 'Osment', 'wrought', 'woe', 'fears', 'caring', 'child', 'hardly', 'concerned', 'fact', 'greatest', 'fear', 'mother', 'how', 'unusually', 'cruel', 'situation', 'slowly', 'driving', 'madness.While', 'Willis', 'movie', 'believable', 'serene', 'atmosphere', 'end', 'final', 'twist', 'questionable', 'when', 'considering', 'previous', 'sequences', 'always', 'several', 'steps', 'Osment', 'truly', 'formidable', 'presence.Never', 'pace', 'excell', 'let', 'up', 'Slowly', 'carefully', 'story', 'somewhat', 'quot', 'lost', 'quot', 'souls', 'unique', 'ending', 'situation', 'duo', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'gasp-worthy', 'reactions', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'prevent', 'movie', 'slacking', 'never', 'let', 'scenes', 'drag', 'horror', 'oriented', 'atmosphere.A', 'clever', 'use', 'colors', 'examined', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'quite', 'nice', 'provide', 'decent', 'length', 'bonus', 'material', 'tender', 'affectionate', 'dialogue', 'deeply', 'realistic', 'characters', 'keep', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'quot', 'decent', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'level', 'Rather', 'Osment', 'should', 'be', 'mostly', 'credited', 'true', 'praise', 'performance', 'simply', 'swept', 'screen']",The Sixth Sense VHS

474999,AZCDCO6KK2T81,630573240X,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[2, 5]","SPOILER ALERT:  Before reading this review, please know that this film is a complex psychological mystery to figure out and in the course of discussing this film's merits some pieces of the puzzle may be revealed inadvertently.  I often refrain from this with reviews, but it's hard to discuss this film without giving away some critical elements here and there.  Please be advised of this as I hate to spoil anyone's enjoyment of this modern classic film that you really must see and own if you are a fan of this genre.After two rather lame, dorky films M. Night Shyamalan hit it big with this 1999 sleeper that quietly went on to become one of the biggest box-office surprises of that year and this genre and rightly so.  It is the kind of film that Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho) would have been proud to put his name on.  I'll forego the usually plot analysis here as most are familar with this film and Amazon's description of the film says enough.The film's strengths lie in the wonderfully subtle performances by the stars who all rightly deserved their Oscar nominations.  I still consider this one of Bruce Willis's best performance if not best, but with a career that easily bounces around from comedy to action hero to thrillers it's hard to really say what is his best.  In any event, his role here as the tortured child psychologist trying to make up for a past wrong is compelling and rather typical of any Hitchcockian-type thriller (considerVertigoas a great example).  Haley Joel Osmont, whose sister was inSpy Kids 2and on the current Disney showHannah Montana, gives a marvelous performance and one of the best I've ever seen from a child actor.  His eyes are truly the windows to his soul.  Toni Collette as Osment's grief-stricken, single mother is flawless, believable at all times, and heart-wrenchingly touching as she attempts to communicate with her child that she believes may be beyond reaching.In addition, the film's delibertly slow-mounting pace mixed with sudden unexpected jolts brings about incredible tension and suspense.  Shyamalan is brilliant at slowly giving us the pieces to the film's puzzle to the point where we feel, as the audience, like complete idiots for not ""getting it"" sooner.  Why didn't I notice that no one talks directly to Willis's character except the boy and why does he keep wearing in some fashion the same clothes (plus or minus tie, plus or minus sweatshirt or sport jacket, etc.).  The ending of the film is telegraphed to us earlier on and we are given countless clues, but like any skilled director, Shyamalan often misdirects our attention elsewhere at critical times.  His is a very gifted director and writer who can effectively bring his vivid imagination to the screen.The photography, camera angles, lighting, and careful editing manipulate us from beginning to end and the score by James Newton Howard who gave us the theme toERand the awesomely effective score to Shyamalan'sSignsis always appropriate and memorable as a score should be.  In addition, the make-up for the ghosts that only Osment can see is jolting and convincing each time and often surprisingly revealed to us.  Their presence is eerie, disturbing, and, forgive the pun, haunting.My only complaint about this otherwise flawless piece of entertainment is that it is, as some critics have rightly pointed out, a rather contrived work, but most good mysteries are by the nature of the genre itself and not so much because of the writer and director of which Shyamalan is both.  The pieces of the puzzle HAVE to fit at the end and to criticize the film for doing so seems a bit unfair, but I do understand what those critics mean as Shyamalan is a bit heavy-handed with his contrivances, but, wow, can he tell a story.  If you are interested in his other works, then just click his name highlighted as director.  Except for his first two silly films and the troubled and uneven but still decentLady in the Wateryou should enjoy this master director and writer.FYI: This film was the inspiration for two popular and current TV shows.  They are NBC's highly successfulMediumin which Emmy-Winner Patricia Arquette is a housewife that sees ghosts in her dreams that want her to assist them in some manner and CBS's equally successfulGhost Whispererwith Jennifer Love Hewitt playing a similar role, but see ghosts all day long and not in her dreams (more like in ""The Sixth Sense"").  These are series worth owning by the way.  I never miss an episode of either show.",5,"A bit contrived, but riveting entertainment.

Night Shyamalan's &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; because I read that the movie was supposed to have a great surprise-ending.  &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is an average thriller.Child psychologist Bruce Willis is shot and wounded by an angry former patient who later kills himself.  About a year later, Willis finds that his marriage is crumbling and comes across a young boy(Haley Joel Osment) who seriously needs his help.  Osment has a special talent that allows him to look into the past.  He is also haunted by spirits and says that Willis is the only person who can help him.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a so-so thriller.  I wasn't satisfied with the first two-thirds of the film but the last third is great.  The last third of the film is genuinely heartfelt and stunning.  As a child actor, Osment gives a good performance but I didn't think his portrayal was Oscar-worthy; his character's emotions seem too affected at times.  I also wish the film would have gone into much greater detail about the dead girl-ghost character who asks Osment for his help.  If anything, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; certainly has a GREAT twist-ending.  The surprise ending is both logical and intelligent, and I didn't come close to guessing this conclusion beforehand.  The surprise conclusion significantly helps in elevating the film.Despite its weaknesses, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; should be seen by every movie buff at least once.

Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" is a noteworthy example of how the technique of misdirection can be employed in cinema.  However, the mere use of misdirection does not guarantee that a film will wind up being any good.Psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) returns home one evening after receiving an award for his work with children.  A former patient awaits him there and shoots him in front of his wife.  Time passes and Crowe tries to put the incident behind him by immersing himself in a new case.  Crowe takes on a new patient named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who claims that he is able to see dead people around him.""The Sixth Sense"" created a sensation upon its release as filmgoers relished its twist ending.  Yet, if the truth be told, the ending will not come as a surprise to fantasy and science-fiction fans or to those who are actually paying attention to the events unfolding onscreen rather than sitting back and just going along for the ride.  The entire success of ""The Sixth Sense"" hinges on whether you are able to figure out the ending ahead of time and unfortunately Shyamalan's use of misdirection just does not mask the final revelation effectively enough.  From the beginning of the film, one knows that something is amiss and the twist becomes more and more obvious as the story continues to unfold.  The acting is first rate with Willis, Osment, Toni Collette, and Olivia Williams turning in great work.  Willis in particular turns in an interesting performance that is a departure from his more action-oriented roles.

475003,A3VCFKG8PVV0CO,630573240X,Stingray Ramone,"[0, 0]","What surprised me most about The Sixth Sense is how cerebral it is considering that after all, it is a horror film.  It is not exactly a horror film, because obviously, there are no unrealistically macabre sequences and the ""dead people"" aren't menacing or sinister, whose unfinished business is to kill and destroy, but to serve as guides of compassion.  However, The Sixth Sense is a horror film, in that it grips you psychologically, that leaves you with an unsettling feeling in your stomach.The Sixth Sense is a story that is founded on the relationship of Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a highly acclaimed child psychologist and Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a disturbed nine year-old of whom is bestowed the gift and or the curse of communicating with the spirits of the deceased.  The story starts off with Malcolm and his wife, Anna (Olivia Williams resting comfortably at home.  Their peace is interrupted, when an intruder, who turns out to be one of Malcolm's former child patients by the name of Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg), breaks into the couple's bathroom.  Now as an adult, Gray is distraught and suicidal and he exacts a measure of revenge on Malcolm before taking his own life.  Bouncing back a year later, Malcolm encounters the extremely sensitive, troubled Cole, who is an unhappy outcast amongst his peers because of his paranormal psychic ability.  Looking to dispatch the lingering emotional pain of watching and ""causing"" Vincent Gray's suicide and its effect on his life, especially his marriage, Malcolm urges Cole to confront these spirits and to pick up on what they want.  Meanwhile, Malcolm attempts to mend his marriage with Anna, because she simply would not talk to him and in the mouth-dropping climax which is quite reminiscent of the Ambrose Bierce short story, ""An Occurrence on Owl Creek Bridge"", he discovers the shocking truth on why.Even though The Sixth Sense boasts outstanding performances turned in by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, M. Night Shyamalan's exquisite directing and storytelling is what makes The Sixth Sense stand out as one of the best films in 1999 and in the horror film genre.  What is even more effective to the purpose of the film is the thought-provoking conclusion.  If you have not carefully observed the film, scene by scene, the movie invites you to re-evaluate and reconceptualize the story and its events and it demands you to watch the film over and over to attain a deep understanding of its concept, without losing its awesomeness and splendor simultaneously.  All in all, The Sixth Sense is not horrifically gory and much more cerebral.  If you crave the intellectually challenging thriller flick and a much more macabre presentation, then I highly recommend Seven.  Either way, The Sixth Sense is a well-rounded, must-see flick which does not stop provoking thought and providing chills.",5,Very Intensive Thriller that leaves you with a Big Chill,1055808000,"06 17, 2003",2003,2873,"['What', 'surprised', 'most', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'how', 'cerebral', 'considering', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'exactly', 'horror', 'film', 'obviously', 'are', 'unrealistically', 'macabre', 'sequences', 'dead', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'menacing', 'sinister', 'unfinished', 'business', 'kill', 'destroy', 'serve', 'guides', 'compassion', 'However', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'horror', 'film', 'psychologically', 'unsettling', 'feeling', 'stomach.The', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'story', 'founded', 'relationship', 'Malcolm', 'Crowe', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'disturbed', 'nine', 'year-old', 'whom', 'bestowed', 'gift', 'curse', 'communicating', 'spirits', 'deceased', 'story', 'Malcolm', 'wife', 'Anna', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'resting', 'comfortably', 'home', 'peace', 'interrupted', 'when', 'intruder', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'Malcolm', 'former', 'child', 'patients', 'name', 'Vincent', 'Gray', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'couple', 'bathroom', 'Now', 'adult', 'Gray', 'distraught', 'suicidal', 'measure', 'revenge', 'Malcolm', 'taking', 'own', 'life', 'Bouncing', 'back', 'year', 'later', 'Malcolm', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'troubled', 'Cole', 'who', 'unhappy', 'outcast', 'peers', 'paranormal', 'psychic', 'ability', 'Looking', 'dispatch', 'lingering', 'emotional', 'pain', 'watching', 'causing', 'Vincent', 'Gray', 'suicide', 'effect', 'life', 'especially', 'marriage', 'Malcolm', 'Cole', 'confront', 'spirits', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'want', 'Meanwhile', 'Malcolm', 'mend', 'marriage', 'Anna', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'talk', 'mouth-dropping', 'climax', 'quite', 'reminiscent', 'Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'short', 'story', 'Occurrence', 'Owl', 'Creek', 'Bridge', 'shocking', 'truth', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'turned', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'exquisite', 'directing', 'storytelling', 'what', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'stand', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1999', 'horror', 'film', 'genre', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'effective', 'purpose', 'film', 'thought-provoking', 'conclusion', 'have', 'not', 'carefully', 'observed', 'film', 'scene', 'scene', 'movie', 're-evaluate', 'reconceptualize', 'story', 'events', 'watch', 'film', 'attain', 'deep', 'understanding', 'concept', 'losing', 'awesomeness', 'splendor', 'simultaneously', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'not', 'horrifically', 'gory', 'much', 'more', 'cerebral', 'crave', 'intellectually', 'challenging', 'thriller', 'flick', 'much', 'more', 'macabre', 'presentation', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Seven', 'way', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'well-rounded', 'must-see', 'flick', 'not', 'stop', 'provoking', 'thought', 'providing', 'chills']",The Sixth Sense VHS

Bruce Willis gave a surprisingly capable performance, and Haley Joel Osment did an excellent job of handling a very difficult role.  The success of this movie did seem a slight bit overwhelming though. To me this is a good but not great movie. My first problem with this movie was (don't read on if you haven't seen the movie), is that aside from the clever gimmick of the ending (which reflects back if you watch the movie again), this is a strong but standard thriller film. It's well written, but not particularly creative, and the end gimmick, as compared to say, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, is really kind of pointless if you really think about (more than anything, it shows the craft of a smart screenwriter). And finally, this movie suffered from a lack of buzz compared to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, as both came out at similar times. THE SIXTH SENSE, came out without a great deal of hype, soon after the aggressively marketed BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. As a result, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (which I feel is much creepier and disturbing) suffered from a backlash, while this movie came out at the perfect time to recieve the opposite.  Anyways, I do like this movie a great deal. And, it's definitely a movie that should be seen more than once. But &quot;One of the best films ever made?&quot; Please.

This is one of the hardest reviews i've ever tried to write, words do not  seem capable of conveying the ingenuity and gorgeousness of the Sixth  Sense.  I'm not going to talk about the plot, to analyse it would give away  too much, so this leaves only my feelings about the fim to convince  you.I still feel somewhat astounded by its intelligence and mesmerised  by its beauty. I know such descriptive words are not those which one would  normally associate with a film of its kind but that's what makes the Sixth  Sense different.  The plot is what binds it to the supernatural/suspense  genre, but the actual story makes it so much more.  Take Poltergiest, Ghost  and Good Will Hunting, these are three very different films, each a classic  in their own right. If you were to mix these you might end up with  something close to the Sixth Sense: an original supernatural thriller, with  excellent character development and relationships which is not too big to  have an element of romance.  Brilliant displays by Bruce Willis and Haley  Joel Osment gives the film its edge.Technically the Dvd is also  faultless. Picture and sound quality are excellent and there are two pages  of special features which have thoughtfully been put together.I can  offer you no more than my assurance that this is a film that I believe will  appeal to all.

The film stars Bruce Willis as a childpsychologist with a traumatic past who decides to counsel a disturbed little boy named Cole Sear who is played by Haley Joel Osment.  Cole has a special gift that most adults wouldn't want; he can see and hear ghosts.  Willis then tries to help young Cole to cope with his ability and live a normal life.This film has a very interesting premise, but more than that perhaps it's strongest asset are the strong performances by Haley Joel Osment and the underrated Bruce Willis.  Osment gives a star making performance showing an almost scary amount of maturity for a young child.  As for Willis, he gives his most earnest and best performance to date showing what a fine talent he really is.  While most of the story centers around Cole's performance, Willis doesn't try to outshine his young co-star.  Instead he shows the younger actor much respect by reacting and listening to him instead of out-act him.  Much recognition should go to Willis for Osment's performance, and for his own as well.Another great ability Willis has is having complete trust from the audience.  He has always utilized this talent in his &quot;Die Hard&quot; films and other action adventures, but it has never been so useful than in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.  We react to his humanity has he tries to heal this sad little boy, and we sympathize for him has he desparately tries to mend his marriage.  Being as huge and important a star as Willis is, he shows restraint from turning this performance into a star vehicle.One more wonderful thing about &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is the writing by director M. Night Shyamalan.  This isn't a trendy thriller with 90's gimmicks and one liners.  However, this film has undoubtedly become a trend setter.  Many of the films wonderful plot turns come naturally and are done with great care as to show the audience that these aren't artificial scares and suprises.&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a film like &quot;Ghost&quot;, an emotional supernatural tale with a suprisingly sweet heart.  There are emotional responses from the audience ranging from genuine fright to overwhelming suprise and delight.

Night Shyamalan film I've seen, the first having been ""Signs"" (the plot of which ended up luring me in and blowing me away).I already had a general idea of the plot of ""The Sixth Sense,"" but I didn't actually expect to be lured in and blown away a second time. And that's exactly what happened.As with ""Signs,"" the resolution of ""The Sixth Sense"" caught me completely off-guard and had quite an impact. I'd heard about an unexpected twist at the end, but that's all. Fortunately, I'd managed to avoid all spoilers. (Whew.)I sometimes joke that ""Signs"" is the first ""alien"" movie that's ever moved me to tears (call me sappy, but it's true). Now I can joke that ""The Sixth Sense"" is the first ""ghost"" movie that's induced me to start bawling like a little kid - not because I'm scared, but because I genuinely feel for the characters and what they're going through. Both of these movies resonate with me as few films have.I watched ""The Sixth Sense"" with the intent of not trying to figure anything out and just letting it take me where it wanted me to go. What a payoff I got.I realize that M. Night's style isn't for everyone, but to me, his approach to filmmaking is a welcome throwback to a time before we had pull-out-all-the-stops blockbuster movies bursting at the seams with CGI and other high-tech special effects. He shows us ""ordinary"" people in extraordinary situations and we get to see how they react -- while at the same time, we are kept off-balance by things we *don't* see.""The Sixth Sense"" moves slowly and deliberately. Some folks might find the pace plodding or boring, but I don't. In fact, the relatively low-key atmosphere of the film makes the story seem more real to me.Haley Joel Osment is an amazing actor. His abilities go way beyond his young years, making ""The Sixth Sense"" much more than a ""cute little kid in peril"" story. Bruce Willis' performance is skillfully nuanced and understated -- a far cry from his ""Die Hard"" days (although I like him in those kinds of movies, too). The supporting cast, including a virtually unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg, is top-notch.The DVD includes some great extras. There are four deleted scenes, a conversation with M. Night, an interesting piece called ""Rules and Clues"" about the conventions followed throughout the movie and the subtle hints about what's really going on, as well as other goodies.I hope M. Night keeps doing what he's doing for a long time to come. I think he's an incredibly talented filmmaker, and I think ""The Sixth Sense"" is a first-rate movie.

Night Shyamalan's first major studio directorial production, yet a rookie mistake is not present in this masterful ghost thriller that has become one of the most prestigous and talked-about horror-dramas of all time.  The film begins with an up-and-coming child psychologist (Bruce Willis, in his most exceptional role to date) celebrating his new-found success with his wife (played by Olivia Williams).  The night is going splendidly; however, a failed child of the psychologist takes his frustration out, shooting him before taking his own life.A year transpires after this horrific event, with Willis's character still trying to piece back the puzzle that was lost on that night.  The psychologist meets a troubled youngster played by the Oscar-nominated Osment, who happens to have a special sense that allows him to see and speak to ghosts.  At first terrifyed of the ghouls, Willis instructs the child to help the &quot;dead people&quot; instead of being afraid.The film is brilliantly directed and scripted, twisting and turning until the much-heralded resolution.  While Willis and Osment's performances are hauntingly special, Toni Collette's role as the tormented mother of Osment is the shining star of the film, delivering a powerful performance.  &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a deep, terrifying look into the world of the supernatural, but unfolds into a film about faith, love, and unbridled second chances.

Instead, I think it's instructive to note that the DVD version was released well in advance of the VHS copy.  This is no  accident.  The DVD version gives the film's production crew a chance to  fully explain all the thought they put into making this remarkable work.  There are arguably more extra features on the DVD than on anything  currently released.To be sure, not all of them are welcome.  It's been  remarked elsewhere, and I fully agree, that the compulsory trailers at the  beginning (out of which you apparently can't escape) are a complete abuse  of the lock-out feature.  It is hoped that this will not become a trend  amongst DVD manufacturers.  Also, I found the storyboard-to-shot  comparison a bit spare.  Only one rather minor scene is  compared.Everything else about the DVD, by contrast, is a movie buff's  dream.  The film is dissected thoroughly, taking the viewer through an  exploration of how each element contributes to the director's overall  vision.  Everything from color schemes to soundtrack creation is discussed.  Deleted scenes are also given director's commentary, which nascent  filmmaker's will undoubtedly find valuable.

Although, I did go through a couple of scenes.  It had been awhile since I had seen it, since I mostly remembered the movie as being depressing.  Sometimes, depressing movies can make you feel more bad for the characters rather than entertained.  I remembered it being depressing because it's about a boy named Cole who doesn't lives alone with his mother and doesn't really have friends.  He is also meeting with a psychologist and he has problems that can't seem to go away even with the help of the psychologist.So, while I remember it as depressing and decided to watch it with my friends I ended up really enjoying the movie more than I thought I would, and it's not quite as depressing as I remember, even if it can be a little depressing.  There are a couple of scenes with Cole smiling making the movie less depressing, and where things seem to go well.  It also has a great plot of seeing dead people that aren't even aware they're dead and have unfinished business.I also seriously can not believe how long ago this film came out.

I remember being shocked as crap when the ending came, and thought wow this movie is going to go down as a classic. Since then since 1998 it has started a Psychological Horror revolution. Now we've had movies like The Others, The Ring, The Grudge, The Uninvited, The Messenger, Omen 666 and so on and so forth. The scary child movies have taken over and people really love it, or hate it. I for one am a huge fan of these types of movies and would take them over hack and slash films any day.Bruce Willis is very good, and i guess he must have made an impression on Mr. M, when he casted him in his other film Unbreakable directly afterwards. The i see dead people theme has been copied in film after film with pretty good success, but few have had the impact The Sixth Sense had. I'm not sure what happened to Haley Joel Osmand but he was a fine little actor. I wish he would star in more films such as this. This is arguably Shamylans best film and he has made nothing like it since, and i doubt he will. Probably another film closest to the level of this one is The Others which was very similar, but different as well. This movie is slow paced, yet effective in frights and giving you the willies over all. I remember hearing that this was an extremely low budget film and it didnt cost much of anything to make. Matter a fact the behind the scenes were very funny and show cased Shamylans artistic directing work when he was young, which was less than impressive, yet fun to behold. When the dead people were around i thought it was very original having the temperature drop and seeing the cold breath come from young coles mouth. Another great performance should go to Tony Collette who was great in this and continues to be great in all of her recent films.So yes this was a revolutionary movie without really even meaning to be, but it changed a whole generation of Psychological horror, and is definitely a classic. Even if u know the ending which about 90% of the population do, its still a great watch, even more than once. Unfortunately you can't say that about many horror films. So keep this in your collection, it's well worth it.

This review has no plot spoilers.There's an old saw that everyone has one big novel or story in them. Unfortunately for M Night Shyamalan, ""The Sixth Sense"" was it. Its tremendous success encouraged him to make similar films, which have been increasingly dumb and dumber. ""The Last Airbender"" is about to be released, and unless it's an unusually good film, it will be renamed with the obvious vulgarity and quickly go to video.But ""The Sixth Sense"" is a classic. Bruce Willis is a child psychologist trying to help Haley Joel Osment, a disturbed pre-teen who ""sees dead people"". Willis thinks Osment might be schizophrenic, and is about to give up the case, when he discovers that the child /might/ be telling the truth, and finds a way to help the boy come to grips with the situation, regardless of whether he's sane or psychotic. In a following scene between Osment and his mother (Toni Collette), we learn whether he really does ""see dead people"". And then comes The Big Reveal... *Forget that ""The Sixth Sense"" is a psychological thriller. It's worth seeing for Shyamalan's subtle direction and Willis's and Osment's beautiful performances. The latter is one of the great child performances in movie history.I am bothered by a recent reviewer who says that he didn't find this film ""entertaining"". It appears we have reached a point anyone born after ""Star Wars"" cannot appreciate dramas. That's pathetic and disturbing. If nothing else, ""The Sixth Sense"" is entertaining in the literal meaning of the word -- it holds our attention from start to finish.The transfer is typical Disney -- richly colored, with extreme detail and sharpness.

If that concept does indeed exist, than ""The Sixth Sense"" comes about as close as possibly to taking that prize.  It contains everything one could ask for in a film.For a basic plot summary, ""The Sixth Sense"" tells the story of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who is prone to visions of dead ghosts and as such is not fitting in very well at school or at home.  With the help of a very unique child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), however, Cole is finally able to face his fears and begin to move on with his life.Since it is easier to come at this review from this angle, about the only people who WON'T enjoy this movie are those who only like the mindless actions of explosions, car chases, and flexing muscles.  Not to disparage those films or their audiences, but if that is the only kind of fare that gets you revved up in the theater, then this one might not be for you.For everyone else, though, ""Sixth Sense"" is almost a clinic in how to make a movie that will keep the audience engaging in nearly every way possible.  It is the kind of film that one cannot say too much about or risk major spoilers, but suffice it to say that it is filled with mystery, layer upon layer of plots, terrific acting, suspense, and a jaw-dropping finale that will have you rebooting the whole experience again very soon!  Though perhaps not by a humongous margin (as ""Signs"" is excellent in its own right), ""Sixth Sense"" is the hallmark film from director M.

Haley Joel Osment gives a great peformance as Cole Sear, a young boy who can see ghosts. He is better than most adult actors, despite his age, and delivers a phenomenal performance in this movie. Bruce Willis, though not at his strongest, was also good. One thing that really caught the eye was the screenplay: It was imaginative and eventful, and had many interesting twists to it. M. Night Shyamalan really pulls something off with this movie, and, though it was worthy of it's Best Picture nomination, was not something which, I repeat, lived up to the hype given it.",5,The Sixth Sense (1999),1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,666,"['Sixth', 'Sense', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'hype', 'led', 'up', 'be', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'great', 'peformance', 'Cole', 'Sear', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'ghosts', 'better', 'most', 'adult', 'actors', 'age', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'not', 'strongest', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'caught', 'eye', 'was', 'screenplay', 'was', 'imaginative', 'eventful', 'had', 'many', 'interesting', 'twists', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'really', 'something', 'off', 'movie', 'was', 'worthy', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'repeat', 'lived', 'up', 'hype', 'given']",The Sixth Sense VHS
