791484,A2JTHBVV5AJEXC,B00012FNBI,A listener,"[6, 9]","This is a good kundalini yoga practice and I would recommend it, as well as the work of Erin Kamler (Mantra Girl) as a supplement to any yoga practice.There are some odd elements to the DVD.  First of all, Ravi Singh is in the DVD, but he is not actually doing anything.  He appears in a lower corner of the screen, which is a bit distracting.  Ana Brett is performing the routine in what appears to be her underwear.  The music is tinny and repetitive, which can be irritating as the 90 minute routine stretches on.Notwithstanding these comments, it is a good routine.  The routine is designed to cleanse body and mind, therefore it does not really have the same physical results as a power or ashtanga yoga routine would.  The biggest advantage of kundalini yoga, however, is that it is all about breathing so there really is no ""cheating"" possible.  Many modern yogis and yoginis practice yoga without paying much, if any, attention to their breath.  This creates a system whereby the practitioner is possibly increasing flexibility, but not much more.  This practice will leave you feeling energized, alive and free.  If you can transition this breathing focus to your other yogic practice, it will be quite beneficial to you.Please do not get wrapped up in the ""fat burning"" benefits of yoga.  Anything that causes one to breathe intensely will burn fat, be it running, dancing or yoga.  Yoga, however, should not be viewed totally from the weight loss experience as it likely will not meet one's expectations.",4,Good Practice,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,1515,"['good', 'kundalini', 'yoga', 'practice', 'would', 'recommend', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'Erin', 'Kamler', 'Mantra', 'Girl', 'supplement', 'yoga', 'are', 'odd', 'elements', 'DVD', 'First', 'Ravi', 'Singh', 'DVD', 'not', 'actually', 'doing', 'anything', 'lower', 'corner', 'screen', 'bit', 'distracting', 'Ana', 'Brett', 'performing', 'routine', 'what', 'be', 'underwear', 'music', 'tinny', 'repetitive', 'can', 'be', 'irritating', '90', 'minute', 'routine', 'stretches', 'on.Notwithstanding', 'comments', 'good', 'routine', 'routine', 'designed', 'cleanse', 'body', 'mind', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'same', 'physical', 'results', 'power', 'ashtanga', 'yoga', 'routine', 'would', 'biggest', 'advantage', 'kundalini', 'yoga', 'however', 'breathing', 'so', 'really', 'cheating', 'possible', 'Many', 'modern', 'yogis', 'yoginis', 'practice', 'yoga', 'paying', 'much', 'attention', 'breath', 'system', 'whereby', 'practitioner', 'possibly', 'increasing', 'flexibility', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'practice', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'energized', 'alive', 'free', 'can', 'transition', 'breathing', 'focus', 'other', 'yogic', 'practice', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'beneficial', 'you.Please', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'fat', 'burning', 'benefits', 'yoga', 'Anything', 'one', 'breathe', 'intensely', 'will', 'burn', 'fat', 'be', 'running', 'dancing', 'yoga', 'Yoga', 'however', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'viewed', 'totally', 'weight', 'loss', 'experience', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'meet', 'one', 'expectations']",Yoga Total Tune-UP

I am able to finish each of these workouts in their entirety; yeah! Total Tune-Up does not have the high production quality of their later workouts, but the exercises leave me feeling energized, stretched out and relaxed. And since I keep my eyes closed for the majority of it, it makes no difference to me that the on-screen views aren't as stunning as their new ones.I feel like my lower body gets a great stretch and workout from this.

791490,A15TIAG5RDIGGY,B00012FNBI,Elizabeth M,"[7, 8]","Ana and Ravi's yoga DVDs have spoiled me for all other yoga discs! Before trying my first one of their discs I had been doing vinyasa flow yoga for almost ten years, with the occasional dabble in power yoga. I had tried a couple of other kundalini discs and hadn't liked them particularly. These are different. They really work your spirit and your body.This particular disc is divided up into four parts, each about 20 minutes long (Though I think Part 1 is longer and Part 4 shorter.) Part 1 contains a breath meditation and warmups, Part 2 focuses mostly on the core (naval center= belly workout), Part 3 is further workout for the body, and Part 4 slows you down and works your emotions/takes you through final relaxation and meditation. The whole thing is about 80 minutes, and I'll either do Part 1 , 2 OR 3 and then 4, or do everything depending on my time constraints. You can sorta tell, after seeing the others that this and Yoga Cleanse are their first DVDs (slightly lower production quality and a little rougher), but it doesn't take away from the experience at all.These DVDs have tightened up my body a lot and help calm my mind.

In so many Yoga videos you hold pose after pose, but the teacher does not explain why or for what reason the pose is important.This tape has some moves a person doing aerobics would recognize, but Ravi explains how they benefit your maridians or how it cleanses your organs etc.  A simple neck roll now becomes something I want to do because it has value on so many levels.I got up a sweat with this tape, but did not find it particularly difficult, except for the Frogs, man those are challenging.

Total time including meditations is about 180 minutes.  I loved the whole program, a great workout and thoroughly loved the benefits.  Great for beginners as you get a complete awareness of kundalini practice and great for those who have been practicing for a wee while.  Dont be put off that this is an earlier production as you will get the same great benefits as the later dvds.
