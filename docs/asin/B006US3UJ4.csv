I agree the heavy-metal industrial soundtrack is over-powering to the point of giving me a headache and really does not offer anything related to what is going on - as far as action - was none - other than pooping and puking thru a tube if that is action?",1,What a pointless film - very disappointing,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,648,"['read', 'only', 'other', 'review', 'rater', 'giving', '4', 'Stars', 'honestly', 'was', 'zero', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'be', 'candidate', 'plot', 'boring', 'effects', 'are', 'minimal', 'crude', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'plus', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'little', 'budget', 'definitely', 'lack', 'talent', 'direction', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'truly', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'agree', 'heavy-metal', 'industrial', 'soundtrack', 'over-powering', 'point', 'giving', 'headache', 'really', 'not', 'offer', 'anything', 'related', 'what', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'action', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'pooping', 'puking', 'thru', 'tube', 'action']",Hellacious Acres: The Case of John Glass
1520110,A2YQ5O6XV23543,B006US3UJ4,Kevin H. Dudley,"[5, 10]","I had not heard anything about this film until a friend of mine stumbled across the DVD in the new releases for April 3rd where he works at. He liked the cover art and then was intrigued by the brief synopsis on the back of the case. He happened to mention it to me and I checked out some stuff about the film online and was intrigued by all of the positive reviews that I read about it.Basically, the film is Pat Tremblay's vision as he directed, wrote, edited, co-scored the music and also did most of the visual & practical effects in the film. The film was made for little to no money but it's truly amazing what all Pat was able to pull off with the final product as this is one of the most entertaining, strange and original films that I've seen in a while. The basic plot involves a man named John Glass who awakens in a suspended status chamber in a decrepit barn in a containment suit. The cybernetic female voice informs him that while he has been in his state of suspended animation, the 3rd world war occured greatly decimating the entire world and then an alien invasion occured not too long after that. He is given instructions that he needs to go to a couple other barn locations, gather some data to help eventually try to get the atmosphere back to liveable conditions for humans to exist and then get to a final location in which he is supposed to be told exactly what all is going on but not until he completes his ""mission"" first. He is suffering from amnesia on top of this and is very perplexed to say the least.The film is very up front right from the start that he's going to have to be walking to the other locations that are on his arm band computer device display and he also has a heads up display in his containment suit's helmet that makes the movie almost resemble a live action of recent post apocalyptic first person shooters such as ""Fallout 3"". As a result, a lot of the film is focused on his journey walking trying to get where he needs to go to and running across the occasional psychotic survivor, teleportation device or alien along the way. The movie is very slow but that is the point. It truly puts you in the same frame of mind as the title character and what he is having to endure. Some people won't like it and feel it's a test of their patience but others like myself who appreciate a good well made slow burn type movie will love it.The film is presented on the DVD in 2.35 anamorphic widescreen with 2 channel stereo with no optional english subtitles. I mention the lack of subtitles in that my main beef with the film is that the loud pseudo metal/industrial soundtrack sometimes overpowers the dialogue and it can be touch to discern what is being said. I had to back the movie up a couple of times to be able to try to tell what was being said. The movie is very light on plot but there's a ton of moments of the Joe Glass character talking to himself or listening to pre-recorded audio on his suit's computer arm band device. As I stated earlier in my review, since this film was made for next to nothing, the visual quality is very sparse and rough but it suits the post apocalyptic feel of the movie perfectly. When special effects do happen, they're usually very minimalistic in nature and only to serve the story. The camera work is limited in terms of movement a lot of times but resembles in a lot of respects George Romero's Dawn of the Dead style in which he would get a ton of shot setups and then edit all of those together to give a great sense of movement and fluidity in terms of what is going on in a particular scene. The only extra is around 15 minutes of deleted scenes that aren't listed on the box. I would have loved to have had at least a commentary track to hear what all Pat had to say and how long it took him to get this project completed.The biggest thing that I loved about this movie is the nice sense of humor that is put throughout the film that usually arises out of bizarre situations themselves and not as jokes per se. It's a truly unique hybrid that manages to combine horror, sci-fi, dark comedy and existential drama into something that is a low budget marvel. My only criticism would be the film's 1 hour 48 minute running time. It does tend to lag sometimes in some spots (particularly during the 1st act) more than the filmmaker probably intended for it to and possibly could have seen 15 to 20 minutes trimmed out to tighten it up a bit more. This feels more like an 85 to 90 minute movie at most but that is really the only problem that I had with it other than the audio issue I mentioned earlier with the music drowning out the dialogue in some spots.If you are looking for something that is original and truly off the beaten path of the usual stuff Hollywood cranks out, I highly recommend this Canadian low budget marvel. Filmmaker Pat Tremblay is a true talent that knows exactly what he's doing in all respects to making a film such as this and I greatly look forward to future projects from him. Highly recommended!",4,"An original, strange & funny microbudget post apocalyptic endeavor.",1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,5019,"['had', 'not', 'heard', 'anything', 'film', 'friend', 'mine',

Pawar ""thestoneman""","[3, 8]","I didn't read the background or purpose of this movie prior to watching it...an initial error but ultimately it won't taint the viewing experience if you do it (if you're reading this review without seeing it...stop here).So I viewed the movie as being a serious micro budget film before researching it.  In reality it actually works in that context despite the horrible costumes and meh effects.  It's not actually a bad movie, it's pretty interesting to watch without knowing what's going on here.Anyway, see the title of the movie?  Yeah...that's not some post-apocalyptic movie jargon to describe the plot of the movie, it's actually supposed to be hell to watch.  It's long, the guy sits there doing random stuff, some of the plot doesn't make sense, the effects aren't great, the set pieces aren't great, the dialog is bizarre, etc.  It's meant to be that way.  It's an homage to the b movies of the distant past...think a color version of lost skeleton of cadavra that's more bizarre.On that count (being an homage) it actually fails because it's far too watchable, funny, and interesting (at least to me) to take it's place in the mst3k theater of horrors.  Definitely rent it and see if you want to add it to your collection.
