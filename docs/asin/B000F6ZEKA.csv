Considering that there is so little known about the man, this film is a treasure trove of imformation. Although this film has music in it, it is not a concert. Those that are looking for that should try some of the Pioneer, and Polygram / DG releases. For someone that wants to learn more about J.S. Bach, and the Bach name & heritage, you came to the right place.",5,I can't see how anyone would NOT like this.,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,462,"['extrordinary', 'biographical', 'look', 'J.S', 'Bach', 'greatest', 'composer', 'ever', 'existed', 'Considering', 'so', 'little', 'known', 'man', 'film', 'treasure', 'trove', 'imformation', 'film', 'music', 'not', 'concert', 'are', 'looking', 'should', 'try', 'Pioneer', 'Polygram', '/', 'DG', 'someone', 'learn', 'more', 'J.S', 'Bach', 'Bach', 'name', 'heritage', 'came', 'right', 'place']",N/A
