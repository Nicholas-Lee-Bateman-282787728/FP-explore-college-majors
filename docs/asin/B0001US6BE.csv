I have quite a few home work out videos, so I'm not new to them. The toning section is pretty good on this DVD. I enjoyed it and I felt it.HOWEVER, the cardio section was jumpy to say the least. She's all over the place and SUPER HYPER. I couldn't help but wonder, what kind of drugs is this woman on??? By the time I figured out what she was doing she was moving on to something else. Plus, she wasn't always saying when she was changing to a different exercise, which made it even more frustrating. I didn't enjoy it AT ALL. If all this DVD had was the cardio portion, I would throw it in the trash. There are a lot of other fun and easy to follow cardio DVDs out there that work.Again, the toning section was pretty good. I liked it and it is the type of work out that you can choose how difficult you want to make it by your hold on the resistance band, which I thought was great since some days you don't want to kill yourself, but you want to do something.

I haven't worked out consistently for close to 6 months now and I still found the cardio segment to be on the easy side.

The DVD contains a 25 minute interval cardio workout utilizing the resistance band to burn more calories and strengthen muscle along with endurance.

(The abs workout does not use the band).I found the use of the resistance band, which is included free with the DVD, a wonderful idea. I felt I was getting more of a workout for the time I spent in the cardio section. As for the strength training segments, I found that I like using the band as an alternative to the hand-weights that I use most of the time.As per usual, Denise is very energetic and enthusiastic in this DVD.

I'll have to say that when I ordered this DVD, I actually wanted the free band more than the DVD itself! *shhhh!  Amazon doesn't ship exercise equipment to New Zealand, and hey, I got a DVD that used it too!*I love the resistance band because it takes up very little room and lets me perform cardio and toning simultaneously.  I don't find the band awkward at all, and I'm quite surprised by the negative feedback that others have given, but oh well, to each his own.There are four sections to this DVD, the 25min cardio routine that uses circuit training between short cardio segments and pure toning segments using the band, 10mins of Upper Body toning using the band, 10mins of Lower Body toning using the band and 10mins of Abdominal exercises.  I haven't attempted the abdominal exercises... mainly because it looks as though she doesn't use the band in that section, which I really would have preferred.I find the Cardio section fun, and I like it how she breaks down the routine into small combos and works on them for a few minutes before moving onto something different.  A lot of people have complained about her cueing - but I have learnt to ignore what she's saying and WATCH THE DARN TV.  The first few times, of course, I'm a bit out of step with her, but this is the case for all exercise DVDs - not just Denise Austin's.I love the toning segments that use the band - and its especially good for my mother who has occupational overuse syndrome in her arms from writing on a blackboard all day.  Weights are hard on her joints, so the band is ideal for her.  Also, the resistance band is great to fold up and take away when you go somewhere.If you find resistance bands awkward, don't like Denise Austin and aren't laid back enough to intelligently substitute parts of a workout that you don't like or can't do appropriately or lack the perseverence to try a DVD several times over before coming to a conclusion of its effectiveness, then don't bother buying this DVD.  In fact, don't bother buying any DVD.  Go to the gym.",4,Band? Awkward?
