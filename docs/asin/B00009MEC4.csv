After all the movies ive seen (ALOT of them) May really stands out as being in its own kinda genre. The movie was creey and all the conversations in the film were extrememly awkward which definitely adds to Mays whole plot and feeling. The movie wasnt as gory as I thought or was told it was, but it was still relly good. The movie is extremely creepy and odd but in a really good way.

754268,A3RODEQMP1IY51,B00009MEC4,"Allison Fox ""Film Fanatic & Philosopher""","[5, 7]","Ok so this movie IS NOT for everyone.  It's basically about a girl named May who works at an animal clinic and loves gross (gruesome) things.  Her mother gave her a doll when she was younger but told her she couldn't take it out of the box to play with it.  This doll becomes her only friend for what seems like almost her whole life.  I feel sorry for May in the movie because she's ""different.""  Misunderstood?  Tortured?  There are some very disturbing images in the film ... not for the weak stomached.  Parts that might make you squirm:  show & tell with the blind kids, kitty's sudden ash tray death, eye scratching, eye gouging, the mini-movie, and all the end parts.  I think this movie will definitely be a cult classic, not unlike ""Carrie.""  Angela Bettis is an amazing actress ... and her castmates are incredible as well.  Think: College film gone terribly wrong.  :)  This movie is not meant to be taken seriously.  It's a black dramedy.  Some people will not get it.  The short movie within the movie is the start of May's transformation into, well, a woman Dr. Frankenstein, if you will.  INTERESTING ending.  You have to watch the movie to really get the gist of it (I don't want to ruin it for you).  I think you'll be surprised at what you see.  ;)  If you're looking for a movie that is original and creative, this is it.  Go on, rent it, what do you have to lose?  All movies are experiences, right?  Good or bad.  In my opinion, this just happens to be one of the good ones.  If you enjoy movies that are not mainstream and a little dark, I think you'll enjoy MAY.

It is just a horror movie.Second, it created a character that I was interested in.  A girl who was born with a lazy eye, and parents that were supportive in the wrong ways.  It was also intersting to see how she formed a bond with this creepy doll that is her main friend for her whole life.  she isn't mopey and complaining about her isolation, she doesn't even seem to be aware of it.  Until she finds somone that she is interested in, or part of a person, his hands.  She has an offbeat quality to her that you would expect from someone that has lived in her own world her entire life.  Angela Bettis did a great job portraying this.Third, it wasn't a straight out horror.  It had the qualities of a dark comedy.  The characters around her are strange in personality and their actions.  Her lesbian coworker, the guy she meets that likes strange but not too strange, the foreign vet she works for that only she seems to be able to understand, etc....This is apparently one of the first few movies from this director, Lucky McKee, but I feel that it has potential and look forward to his next project.",4,Fresh horror movie for the new millenium,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,1353,"['doubt', 'new', 'concept', 'as', 'far', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'similar', 'movies', 'different', 'most', 'other', 'horror', 'coming', 'out.First', 'annoying', 'trend', 'scream', 'movies', 'are', 'too', 'self', 'aware', 'just', 'horror', 'movie.Second', 'created', 'character', 'was', 'interested', 'A', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'lazy', 'eye', 'parents', 'were', 'supportive', 'wrong', 'ways', 'was', 'also', 'intersting', 'see', 'how', 'formed', 'bond', 'creepy', 'doll', 'main', 'friend', 'whole', 'life', ""n't"", 'mopey', 'complaining', 'isolation', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'aware', 'somone', 'interested', 'part', 'person', 'hands', 'offbeat', 'quality', 'would', 'expect', 'someone', 'lived', 'own', 'world', 'entire', 'life', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'this.Third', 'was', ""n't"", 'straight', 'out', 'horror', 'had', 'qualities', 'dark', 'comedy', 'characters', 'are', 'strange', 'personality', 'actions', 'lesbian', 'coworker', 'guy', 'likes', 'strange', 'not', 'too', 'strange', 'foreign', 'vet', 'only', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'etc', '.This', 'apparently', 'one', 'first', 'few', 'movies', 'director', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'feel', 'potential', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'project']",May

754274,A3ONCOK36KPOV8,B00009MEC4,A Reviewer,"[0, 0]","In an era when the horror film has degenerated into unimaginative and redundant slasher flicks and PG-13 teenybopper specials, it is satisfying to find a creepy little gem like May. Angela Bettis is wonderful in the title role, creating the greatest female victim/villain in a horror film since Sissy Spacek in Carrie. Rather than playing May as a caricature, Bettis brings her to life as a lonely, tormented individual suffering from mental illness. We watch her personality deteriorate as the film progresses. May is quite attractive in a delicate waiflike way. She is also odd and creepy. It is easy to see how the Jeremy Sisto character would be simultaneously attracted to and repulsed by her. She is like an exotic flower which turns out to be poisonous. The pace of the film is measured but never boring. May's outbursts of violence are brief, but nasty (she is a veterinary surgical assistant and favors sharp implements such as scalpels and scissors). The quirky, Alt-Rock soundtrack fits the story perfectly, and the film has a black humor about it, from start to finish. Lucky McKee does a terrific job of directing. He is like a breath of fresh air to the rather stagnant horror genre. For another entertaining McKee/Bettis collaboration, see ""Sick Girl"" from the Masters of Horror series.

Everyone has put trust in Man and realtionships and was felled. But this movie just shows how some take these failures harder that others.

The pacing is slow and deliberate which reveals May's shyness. It is clear this is not a character who's comfortable around people and yet she pushes herself to deal with them. The results are awkward and disturbing. It's this sympathy you have for May that makes her wicked deeds later on so shocking. You can understand why she commits these heinous acts, but it's very hard to watch. The gore is not that bad, as other reviews have stated, it's the psychology behind it that make it difficult.

May is not your run of the mill horror movie, it has that hopeless romantic teen flick feel to it, but at the same time you can tell that this chick is nuttier than squirel turds!and slowly but surely she becomes crazier and crazier but you kind of start to feel for her and at that point she just loses it killing people for revenge and for their &quot;perfect parts&quot; and while she's killing people they are playing some totally out of place music,but at the same time it fits the movie perfectly. I will try not to give away the ending, but it was beyond creepy, I really wasn't expecting exactly what happened, but I do have to say that it was the most perfect ending for this movie, because the director could have kept going but he didn't and that is what made this movie so good, right when you are really creeped out the movie stops, so you are stuck with that creepy feeling, and you just might find youself keeping the lights on that night!",5,HOW COME NOBODY WANTS TO PLAY WITH ME!??,1086652800,"06 8, 2004",2004,1148,"['doubt', 'one', 'craziest', 'disturbing', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'become', 'cult', 'favorite', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'around', 'trippin', 'people', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'May', 'not', 'run', 'mill', 'horror', 'movie', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'teen', 'flick', 'feel', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'chick', 'nuttier', 'squirel', 'turds', 'slowly', 'surely', 'crazier', 'crazier', 'kind', 'start', 'feel', 'point', 'just', 'killing', 'people', 'revenge', 'quot', 'perfect', 'parts', 'quot', 'killing', 'people', 'are', 'playing', 'totally', 'place', 'music', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'will', 'try', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'was', 'creepy', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'most', 'perfect', 'ending', 'movie', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'right', 'when', 'are', 'really', 'creeped', 'out', 'movie', 'are', 'stuck', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'just', 'might', 'find', 'keeping', 'lights', 'night']",May

She is shy, awkward around people, and lonely to the point of agony. May wants human companionship, but has been stunted by a childhood full of rejection, isolation, and a mother who demands perfection. May has grown into a woman who cannot escape the dark prison of herself. She is unable to transcend her own inner terror and debilatating emptiness. May is a mess. She has a doll (made by mum) named Susie, who is her only friend. Kept in a glass case, Susie is as untouchable to May as the rest of the world. This doesn't stop May from having long, heart-felt conversations with Susie. Susie is a very good listener. Along comes Adam (Jeremy Sisto), a mechanic with beautiful hands. To May, he is perfect, an idealized human she simply must know. Adam stumbles into May's world due to her continued attempts at ""spontaneous"" meetings. The two get to know each other and get along fine (May is weird- Adam likes weird) until one night when Adam shows May the student film he's made about a man and woman who begin making out, and wind up devouring each other's flesh. Let's just say that May takes it way too literally! Adam is freaked out by May's reaction and subsequent ferocity. He leaves her cold. To make matters worse, a girl (Anna Faris) at the animal clinic where May works has been coming on to her. May confuses her lust for love and is shattered when someone new enters the picture. The final chapters of this movie are as surreal as they are gruesome. May reaches her nadir, finally reacting to the pressure that has built up for solong. She shows a hidden, lethal side that absolutely no one suspected was there. Her sudden transformation from odd, but harmless May into homicidal ""Susie"" is pretty wild! This happens on halloween night, when she can exact her vengeance without much suspicion or hindrance. The ending is a true shocker, a no holds barred sequence that grabbed me and shook my bones! There's an excellent homage to Frankenstein throughout this story; in the form of a tattoo, as well as the gruesome finale. MAY is a masterpiece of horror. It's also a great study in human nature and it's limits...",5,MAY-DAY!

Being a lover of horror flicks, I simply had to find out about this &quot;May.&quot; The movie's description told me about a typical crazy girl who goes on a jolly killing spree and collects body parts to make herself the perfect companion. It didn't sound like anything new, but I saw Wes Craven's positive comment on the back. After returning the other two evening new release rental to the shelf, I went home expecting to see a slasher movie. What I got was much different... and much more. Here was May, a poor, lonely girl who was rejected by the world. But then came that special day. &quot;I saw someone today: a boy.&quot; As the film progressed, I noticed how perfectly every detail was woven (or stitched) into the story. I also noticed that most of the other characters were also some sort of rejects. A lesbian couple, a goth, a punk, the blind children, even the boyfriend was a little strange. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against those types of people. I, myself, am also different. May was the most diverse, and yet her emotions were completely normal. All she wanted was a friend. It was too bad that things didn't turn out so well, but what's a movie without a plot? I found May to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was one of those rare films where you actually felt for the main character, and with May, I felt deeply. My rental on that totally normal day anything but normal.

754285,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B00009MEC4,Boggman!,"[0, 0]","May is a good example of a movie where the performances of it's actors outweighs the actual story itself. This is an OK movie, with some really stand out acting. There is no questioning that the performance of Angela Bettis is a real tour de force. Bettis has some real moments in the film, and her portrayal of the young weird May will surely be remembered for some time to come. I also thought that the performances of Jeremy Sisto and Anna Faris were quite exceptional, considering that there doesn't really seem to be much material they are working with. I can't say enough good things about what the actors bring to this film, the problem with ""May"" really comes down to storyline and direction.The film drags through several parts, and leaves the viewer questioning so much about what is NOT explained. Yes, May is a loner, and yes she is quite weird, but not enough detail or history is given as to WHY? Plenty of detail is given to her decent into ""madness"", but one is left to wonder why she is so messed up in the first place?This is no doubt a very interesting film, but I was left to consider how much better it could have been with a little more written character development and some better direction. As a viewer, it can be a little frustrating watching such talented actors having to work with obvious flaws in the direction & writing of a film, especially when in no real way does it affect their own performance.I would suggest seeing this film before buying it, as it might  make a better rental than an addition to your DVD horror library. Not a film that I would entertain repeat viewings of. It just didn't hold my interest for more than one showing- unless you are completely mesmorized by the performance of Angela Bettis (which is quite possible considering she is SO good) to watch it more than once.",3,Welcome to the Dollhouse,1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,1826,"['May', 'good', 'example', 'movie', 'where', 'performances', 'actors', 'actual', 'story', 'OK', 'movie', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'acting', 'questioning', 'performance', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'real', 'tour', 'force', 'Bettis', 'real', 'moments', 'film', 'portrayal', 'young', 'weird', 'May', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'remembered', 'time', 'come', 'also', 'thought', 'performances', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'were', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'considering', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'material', 'are', 'working', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'what', 'actors', 'bring', 'film', 'problem', 'May', 'really', 'down', 'storyline', 'direction.The', 'film', 'drags', 'several', 'parts', 'viewer', 'questioning', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'NOT', 'explained', 'Yes', 'May', 'loner', 'yes', 'quite', 'weird', 'not', 'enough', 'detail', 'history', 'given', 'WHY', 'Plenty', 'detail', 'given', 'decent', 'madness', 'one', 'left', 'wonder', 'why', 'so', 'messed', 'up', 'first', 'place', 'doubt', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'consider', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'written', 'character', 'development', 'better', 'direction', 'viewer', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'frustrating', 'watching', 'such', 'talented', 'actors', 'having', 'work', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'direction', 'writing', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'real', 'way', 'affect', 'own', 'performance.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'seeing', 'film', 'buying', 'might', 'make', 'better', 'rental', 'addition', 'DVD', 'horror', 'library', 'Not', 'film', 'would', 'entertain', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', 'more', 'one', 'showing-', 'are', 'completely', 'mesmorized', 'performance', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'quite', 'possible', 'considering', 'SO', 'good', 'watch', 'more', 'once']",May

People say that you only like it if you're a ""woe is me"" teenager, but I'm not.  I hated the Ring, if anybody has read my reviews of other movies you'd know.  I don't just like artsy fartsy horror movies.  My favorite movie of all time is 'Freddy Vs. Jason', tell me that's artsy fartsy.  The video store I rented this at labeled it a drama, but I saw a preview of it, in what I think was either Cabin Fever or Leprechaun Back 2 Tha Hood, get my point?  It looked like a horror movie.  I decided to give it a go because I'll give any horror movie a chance, and afterwards I was very disturbed.  The film builds up a lot of character for everyone and my favorite was Polly.  I didn't know what would happen next in this film, and when the final half hour rolled around, I was deeply disturbed.  Mutilation, body parts, human dolls, and scoopels, LOL (Inside joke).  This movie tackles areas that I haven't seen near this bad since probably the Surgeon, another classic.  This movie is definitely worth a view and if you like payback, gore, seeing little blind kids bleed and lesbians, then this movie is for you.  Just for the record, this is the only movie I know that actually showed blind keeds crawling on glass.  The movie may be slow, but that just made me care about the characters more, especially Polly.  She's hot and a lesso.  Peace out and enjoy this film, a very good slasher/revenge/demented film, and keep checking for more reviews by me.P.S. most are under Snowmonfon, just for future reference.

One look at her film resume & we can be restfully assured she is every bit an actress although her name rarely comes up in conversation amongst moviephiles as often as it should. Perhaps she is yet to secure the role which will not only define her as a serious actress & tap into unknown dimensions we've yet to experience. I do have faith she will one day nab this role which will land her the acclaims she rightfully deserves & hopefullly that film will see the light of day. Having said that, I still believe that May comes pretty close.While not completely a slasher film per se, I think May is more of a complex psychological study with liberal doses of gore & humor. In fact, I think the film could easily pass as a sequel to the German horror film Nekromantik although less gory & far less explicit. It baffles me how the screenwriters may have initially sold the idea to Lions Gate & the studio's initial response as May is anything but you're conventional horror/thriller flick.May is a very attractive young girl with some serious issues.One could go so far to say her problems began as a child when she was  diagnosed with an eye problem that required a patch. Sadly, her mother doesn't provide much assistance or support but rather comes across as abrasive or overbearing. In essence, May's childhood offers the foundation of  insecurity & parental suffocation which would only progressively get worse as she grows older.Most of the story deals with a grown-up's attempt to deal with life & perhaps even find a little love in the world. Naturally, May tries very hard to be accepted but her mental instability makes it near impossible to keep friends or lovers. As a result of mental issues which were never fully addressed in the earlier stages, May learns what a lot of us learn in life but she utilizes her newfound wisdom a bit differently.There are so many beautiful parts but not beautiful people.You can probably take guesses at this point in terms of which direction the film will head & you're first three won't count. Inevitably, the film grows darker with each frame & we  are eventually subjected to a few slayings which most of us are glad to embrace. Yay!I really did like this film. Honestly, I could relate in some odd way to her character. I think May is a great film for anyone who has ever felt alone or like a loser at some point in their life. May does a fine job of carefully examining the character & showing it's audience that mental illness can reside with anyone really irregardless of how attractive they may appear to the naked eye.",4,May There Be More Films Like This,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,2705,"['Angela', 'Bettis', 'one', 'more', 'underrated', 'actresses', 'Hollywood', 'Indie', 'cinema', 'matter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'One', 'look', 'film', 'resume', 'can', 'be', 'restfully', 'assured', 'bit', 'actress', 'name', 'rarely', 'up', 'conversation', 'amongst', 'moviephiles', 'as', 'often', 'should', 'Perhaps', 'yet', 'secure', 'role', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'define', 'serious', 'actress', 'tap', 'unknown', 'dimensions', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'experience', 'do', 'have', 'faith', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'role', 'will', 'land', 'acclaims', 'rightfully', 'hopefullly', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'Having', 'said', 'still', 'believe', 'May', 'pretty', 'close.While', 'not', 'completely', 'slasher', 'film', 'se', 'think', 'May', 'more', 'complex', 'psychological', 'study', 'liberal', 'doses', 'gore', 'humor', 'fact', 'think', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'pass', 'sequel', 'German', 'horror', 'film', 'Nekromantik', 'less', 'gory', 'far', 'less', 'explicit', 'how', 'screenwriters', 'may', 'have', 'initially', 'sold', 'idea', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'studio', 'initial', 'response', 'May', 'anything', ""'re"", 'conventional', 'horror/thriller', 'flick.May', 'very', 'attractive', 'young', 'girl', 'serious', 'issues.One', 'could', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'problems', 'began', 'child', 'when', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'eye', 'problem', 'required', 'patch', 'Sadly', 'mother', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'assistance', 'support', 'rather', 'across', 'abrasive', 'overbearing', 'essence', 'May', 'childhood', 'foundation', 'insecurity', 'parental', 'suffocation', 'would', 'only', 'progressively', 'get', 'worse', 'older.Most', 'story', 'deals', 'grown-up', 'attempt', 'deal', 'life', 'perhaps', 'even', 'find', 'little', 'love', 'world', 'Naturally', 'May', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'accepted', 'mental', 'instability', 'impossible', 'keep', 'friends', 'lovers', 'result', 'mental', 'issues', 'were', 'never', 'fully', 'addressed', 'earlier', 'stages', 'May', 'what', 'lot', 'learn', 'life', 'newfound', 'wisdom', 'bit', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'beautiful', 'parts', 'not', 'beautiful', 'people.You', 'can', 'probably', 'take', 'guesses', 'point', 'terms', 'direction', 'film', 'will', 'head', ""'re"", 'first', 'three', 'wo', ""n't"", 'count', 'Inevitably', 'film', 'darker', 'frame', 'are', 'eventually', 'subjected', 'few', 'slayings', 'most', 'are', 'glad', 'embrace', 'Yay', 'really', 'did', 'film', 'Honestly', 'could', 'relate', 'odd', 'way', 'character', 'think', 'May', 'great', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'alone', 'loser', 'point', 'life', 'May', 'fine', 'job', 'carefully', 'examining', 'character', 'showing', 'audience', 'mental', 'illness', 'can', 'reside', 'anyone', 'really', 'irregardless', 'how', 'attractive', 'may', 'appear', 'naked', 'eye']",May

754290,A2N2ISRHZ3R7LE,B00009MEC4,"C. Garcia ""ackoocheemoya""","[1, 3]","I've been dying to see this movie since Ain't It Cool News named it one of the ten best movies of 2002, but the movie had a very limited theatrical release and never played in my home state.  Well, I ordered it from Amazon as soon as I heard the DVD was out and I got it yesterday.Angela Bettis plays May, a girl born with a lazy eye whose demanding mother wants her daughter to be the perfect girl.  She deals with the lazy eye by making May wear an eye patch at all times, but her classmates tease her (""Are you a pirate?"" asks a little boy in one scene) and she grows up friendless and lonely, except for a doll her mother made and gave to her.The movie skips to the present, with May now an adult working at an animal hospital.  She no longer wears the patch, but still has no friends and has never even had a boyfriend.  When she sees Adam, she's convinced that he's perfect, so she gets contact lenses to correct the lazy eye and starts following him around, unsure of how to approach him.  While this is happening, her sexy lesbian co-worker, Polly, starts hinting at her attraction toward May and eventually seduces her.I don't want to give away the meaty parts, but lets just say that fragile May doesn't handle rejection or disappointment well and she comes completely undone in the final third of the movie.  It's heartbreaking to see a girl who's suffered so much go through such humiliation and Bettis handles the role perfectly.  The ""cracking glass"" scene where May starts to fall apart is filled with tension, but it's nothing compared to what follows.I can't recommend this movie highly enough, but at the same time I have to warn that it's not for everyone.  Despite Harry Knowles' campaign to get a wider release for the movie, it only played in a handful of test cities and film festivals and you can see why from the opening minutes.  May is not a commercial movie.  The victim and monster are both the same character and the ending is neither happy nor satisfying as the price May pays in the end just seems too cruel even in light of all the horrible things she's done.  Compared to May, I think Donnie Darko had it pretty good.But forget all that and see May for yourselves.  If you can enjoy something offbeat and dark, you'll be in for a real treat with this movie.",5,"Sad, haunting, excellent film",1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,2291,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'dying', 'see', 'movie', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Cool', 'News', 'named', 'one', 'ten', 'best', 'movies', '2002', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'release', 'never', 'played', 'home', 'state', 'Well', 'ordered', 'Amazon', 'as', 'soon', 'heard', 'DVD', 'was', 'got', 'Bettis', 'plays', 'May', 'girl', 'born', 'lazy', 'eye', 'demanding', 'mother', 'daughter', 'be', 'perfect', 'girl', 'lazy', 'eye', 'making', 'May', 'wear', 'eye', 'patch', 'times', 'classmates', 'Are', 'pirate', 'little', 'boy', 'one', 'scene', 'up', 'friendless', 'lonely', 'doll', 'mother', 'made', 'gave', 'her.The', 'movie', 'skips', 'present', 'May', 'now', 'adult', 'working', 'animal', 'hospital', 'no', 'longer', 'patch', 'still', 'friends', 'never', 'even', 'had', 'boyfriend', 'When', 'Adam', 'convinced', 'perfect', 'contact', 'lenses', 'correct', 'lazy', 'eye', 'following', 'around', 'unsure', 'how', 'approach', 'happening', 'sexy', 'lesbian', 'co-worker', 'Polly', 'hinting', 'attraction', 'May', 'eventually', 'seduces', 'her.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'meaty', 'parts', 'just', 'say', 'fragile', 'May', ""n't"", 'handle', 'rejection', 'disappointment', 'well', 'completely', 'undone', 'final', 'third', 'movie', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'girl', 'who', 'suffered', 'so', 'much', 'go', 'such', 'humiliation', 'Bettis', 'role', 'perfectly', 'cracking', 'glass', 'scene', 'where', 'May', 'fall', 'apart', 'filled', 'tension', 'nothing', 'compared', 'what', 'follows.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'enough', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'warn', 'not', 'everyone', 'Harry', 'Knowles', 'campaign', 'get', 'wider', 'release', 'movie', 'only', 'played', 'handful', 'test', 'cities', 'film', 'festivals', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'opening', 'minutes', 'May', 'not', 'commercial', 'movie', 'victim', 'monster', 'are', 'same', 'character', 'ending', 'happy', 'satisfying', 'price', 'May', 'end', 'just', 'too', 'cruel', 'even', 'light', 'horrible', 'things', 'done', 'Compared', 'May', 'think', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'had', 'pretty', 'forget', 'see', 'May', 'yourselves', 'can', 'enjoy', 'something', 'offbeat', 'dark', ""'ll"", 'be', 'real', 'treat', 'movie']",May

This movie seemed to pop out of nowhere fully formed and should be treasured by any fans of clever and original left-field film. There are echoes of other great Independent genre pictures here- a little bit of Nadja, a touch of Liquid Sky, a dose or two of flavor from Re-Animator- but May stands up totally on its own.The story concerns a creepy young woman who was burdened with a lazy eye and a psychotic mother and grew up to be criminally insane and yet remain utterly innocent. Angela Bettis' performance is a marvel- a plethora of wildly clashing impulses are contained and rendered with a strangely sexy hyperkinetic energy. Misunderstood and abused by male and female lovers, May sets out to construct her ideal friend using the body parts from all those she has encountered. May is awfully handy at crafts and is also a veterinary nurse, so she has the necessary skills to get the job done.The first 2/3rds of the fim show May quietly unraveling, and the film's last act is a gory, unsettling and yet totally hilarious grand guignol as May sets about collecting the needed parts for her ideal friend. Lucky McKee has the ideal eye for the subject matter and the deep, moody photography paradoxically sharpens the laughs.This is the kind of work that Independent cinema should be about.

754299,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00009MEC4,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[6, 8]","That takes on a different meaning once one sees this one-of-a-kind movie.  May tries to make friends, really tries, but there are many things going against her.  She is not exactly a looker, being thin, a bit awkward, shy, the kind of girl no one would notice or that girls would tease in high school.  In fact an eyepatch she had to wear as a child did not make her friends, as they didn't consider her normal.There are two quirky characters at the animal hospital where May works.  One is the goofily flaky Polly, a lesbian who is turned on by new things, including being cut with a scalpel after seeing May do it to her own finger.  Another is an older Latin doctor whose incomprehensible messages May understands--""fecoxam on miskatay"" turns out to be ""fecal exam on Miss Kitty.""Key to May's life is a doll in a glass case her mother gave her when she was a girl.  The pale white Suzy has blown-out auburn hair, staring blue eyes, and tiny red lips, and a brownish-red dress.  This is the one constant friend she has.  However, May's frustrations at being shut out and hurt is reflected when the glass of Suzy's case cracks.  In short, it reflects May's secure little world.  As a result, her house is full of dolls and doll parts, mirroring some 90's alternative/goth band album covers, q.v. Curve's Doppelganger.She meets and falls for Adam, a Jim Morrison-lookalike whom she sees one day.  He says his tastes are weird, and for May, that's okay--she likes weird.  However, after seeing one of his film school movies, she tries to emulate a scene from his movie, which freaks him out and puts him off, much to May's surprise.  She tries to get back with him, but she is brushed off many times.Cruel disappointment after cruel disappointment follows, and the ultimate vengeance May takes is horrible, but given what she's gone through, I would've asked her, ""Ooh!  Can I help?""  As someone who's experienced cruelty when I was at school, I've wanted to get revenge in that same way, but more brutally.The attempt to connect with someone but getting the wrong message or that lack of communication that results in disappointment plays a part as well.  And trying to fit in and find friends if one isn't popular or good-looking?  Trying to explain why one is different?  Looking for a certain someone to call one's true love?  That too.Comparisons between May and Carrie (Stephen King)?  Both Carrie White and May Canady don't fit in with the normal world, but May had supportive parents and no supernatural powers, although ironically, Angela Bettis (May) played Carrie in the recent TV movie version.  May though is prettier than Dawn in Welcome To The Dollhouse, an ironic title given May's penchant for dolls.Angela Bettis does wonders as May.  She has a fragile and quirky sort of prettiness which sparkles when she's happy.  When she has been disappointed or cries in frustration, I felt her pain.  I was also surprised to see Anna Faris as Polly, totally different from the squeaky virginal Cindy in the two (soon to be three) Scary Movies.  And Nichole Hiltz as Ambrosia is a Jessica Simpson-lookalike who becomes Polly's squeeze, definitely a cheerleader type who is scornful of May.I was considered a freak by others at school, and with that sense of alienation and anger, I really identify with May.  Why is it that normality is so valued among children, who exclude others because of some handicap, and even among adults, who shun misfits and outsiders because of some difference, I'll never know, but it should be outlawed.In the end, maybe the way May makes a friend, albeit in more conventional ways, may be the only way to make a genuine friend.",5,"If you can't find a friend, make one",1062115200,"08 29, 2003",2003,3664,"['different', 'meaning', 'once', 'one', 'one-of-a-kind', 'movie', 'May', 'make', 'friends', 'really', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'not', 'exactly', 'looker', 'being', 'thin', 'bit', 'awkward', 'shy', 'kind', 'girl', 'one', 'would', 'notice', 'girls', 'would', 'tease', 'high', 'school', 'fact', 'eyepatch', 'had', 'wear', 'child', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'consider', 'normal.There', 'are', 'two', 'quirky', 'characters', 'animal', 'hospital', 'where', 'May', 'One', 'goofily', 'flaky', 'Polly', 'lesbian', 'who', 'turned', 'new', 'things', 'including', 'being', 'cut', 'scalpel', 'seeing', 'May', 'do', 'own', 'finger', 'older', 'Latin', 'doctor', 'incomprehensible', 'messages', 'May', 'understands', 'fecoxam', 'miskatay', 'out', 'be', 'fecal', 'exam', 'Miss', 'Kitty', 'Key', 'May', 'life', 'doll', 'glass', 'case', 'mother', 'gave', 'when', 'was', 'girl', 'pale', 'white', 'Suzy', 'blown-out', 'auburn', 'hair', 'staring', 'blue', 'eyes', 'tiny', 'red', 'lips', 'brownish-red', 'dress', 'one', 'constant', 'friend', 'However', 'May', 'frustrations', 'being', 'shut', 'out', 'hurt', 'reflected', 'when', 'glass', 'Suzy', 'case', 'cracks', 'short', 'May', 'secure', 'little', 'world', 'result', 'house', 'full', 'dolls', 'doll', 'parts', 'mirroring', '90', 'band', 'album', 'q.v', 'Curve', 'Doppelganger.She', 'meets', 'falls', 'Adam', 'Jim', 'Morrison-lookalike', 'whom', 'one', 'day', 'tastes', 'are', 'weird', 'May', 'okay', 'weird', 'However', 'seeing', 'one', 'film', 'school', 'movies', 'emulate', 'scene', 'movie', 'out', 'off', 'much', 'May', 'surprise', 'get', 'back', 'brushed', 'off', 'many', 'times.Cruel', 'disappointment', 'cruel', 'disappointment', 'ultimate', 'vengeance', 'May', 'horrible', 'given', 'what', 'gone', 'would', ""'ve"", 'asked', 'Ooh', 'Can', 'help', 'someone', 'who', 'experienced', 'cruelty', 'when', 'was', 'school', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'get', 'revenge', 'same', 'way', 'more', 'brutally.The', 'attempt', 'connect', 'someone', 'getting', 'wrong', 'message', 'lack', 'communication', 'results', 'disappointment', 'plays', 'part', 'well', 'trying', 'fit', 'find', 'friends', 'one', ""n't"", 'popular', 'good-looking', 'Trying', 'explain', 'why', 'one', 'different', 'Looking', 'certain', 'someone', 'call', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'too.Comparisons', 'May', 'Carrie', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Carrie', 'White', 'May', 'Canady', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'normal', 'world', 'May', 'had', 'supportive', 'parents', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'ironically', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'May', 'played', 'Carrie', 'recent', 'TV', 'movie', 'version', 'May', 'prettier', 'Dawn', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'ironic', 'title', 'given', 'May', 'penchant', 'dolls.Angela', 'Bettis', 'wonders', 'May', 'fragile', 'quirky', 'sort', 'prettiness', 'when', 'happy', 'When', 'been', 'disappointed', 'cries', 'frustration', 'felt', 'pain', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'see', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Polly', 'totally', 'different', 'squeaky', 'virginal', 'Cindy', 'two', 'soon', 'be', 'three', 'Scary', 'Movies', 'Nichole', 'Hiltz', 'Ambrosia', 'Jessica', 'Simpson-lookalike', 'who', 'Polly', 'squeeze', 'definitely', 'cheerleader', 'type', 'who', 'scornful', 'May.I', 'was', 'considered', 'freak', 'others', 'school', 'sense', 'alienation', 'anger', 'really', 'identify', 'May', 'Why', 'normality', 'so', 'valued', 'children', 'who', 'exclude', 'others', 'handicap', 'even', 'adults', 'who', 'shun', 'misfits', 'outsiders', 'difference', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'should', 'be', 'end', 'maybe', 'way', 'May', 'friend', 'albeit', 'more', 'conventional', 'ways', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'genuine', 'friend']",May

As it is, while ""May"" has some interesting concepts, there's certainly nothing here to get excited about.With that said, one can't help but pity poor May Cannady (played effectively by the lovely Angela Bettis), the film's eponymous heroine, left friendless after her parents die because, evidently, her lazy eye (which required her to wear an eyepatch in grade school) made it impossible for her to make friends. Not to worry, though: the shy, awkward, but oddly fetching veterinary assistant has a creepy little doll she keeps in a glass box (the doll is for viewing only---look, but don't touch!).But like most awkward teenagers, May wants a little more in the way of flesh-and-blood companionship. Alas, things don't go so well: her filmmaker boyfriend (played by an unusually poised and effective Jeremy Sisto) likes weird, but May is just a little *too* weird---after he shows her his student horror film (which brings an entirely new meaning to the phrase ""I love you so much I could eat you up""), May wants to show her appreciation by making out in the true spirit of Sisto's cannibalistic little horror film.Her perky co-worker Polly (played by the always nimble Anna Faris) seduces her, but alas: fickle creature that she is, Polly quickly finds another conquest in the leggy and hard-as-nails Ambrosia.And when, in a moment of pique, May accidentally kills the cat Polly gave her---well, things go to pieces in a hurry, since everyone knows that when you're a shy, weird, awkward teen who lives alone and you've accidentally brained Kitty, you're just one bad hair day from going the rest of the way and slaughtering a homeless punker with a pair of scissors.But even that's OK: May's mommy told her ""if you don't have a friend, make one"", and May has always been drawn to 'pieces': she loves her boyfriend's hands, loves Polly's neck, loves Ambrosia's legs, and loves kitty's fur. And she's a great seamstress, so you can probably see where this is going.No offense to Lucky McKee: for a first-time outing, this movie shows a lot of potential. Sisto's student film gave me a good laugh, and the cinematography reminds me of Tim Burton's early work. All in all, this is a well crafted movie. The acting is universally competent, as well, so no complaints there.But that said, craft and execution isn't everything. Horror films require a certain suspension of disbelief, but ""May"" doesn't even try to make its character's actions understandable. I didn't buy May's transformation from an eccentric, needy veterinary assistant to a serial killer specializing in vivisection: what, one bad date pushed her over the edge? Another of the film's pivotal scenes involves broken glass and a class full of blind children, and manages to serve up the biggest insult to handicapped kids I have seen in my life, to say nothing of the fact that it's an idiotic scene that makes no sense. Did I miss something in my 30+ years on the planet, or did blind children suddenly take a liking to rubbing fragments of glass in their eyes and skin?But in the final analysis, ""May"" is simply not much fun. It's a self-absorbed and completely self-confident film that expects you to like it as much as McKee does, though unfortunately it's roughly half as clever as he thinks it is. It's painful enough to watch the first time, and I certainly can't imagine the kind of person who would want to own this thing.If dead cats, vivisection, boring teen-angst, and instant lunatics are your thing, you might get something out of ""May"". If you're looking for a truly decent horror movie, then avoid this one like the plague.",2,"Half as clever as it thinks it is, and not that much fun.",1063584000,"09 15, 2003",2003,4086,"['May', 'most', 'congenial', 'horror', 'movies', 'theater-goer', 'who', 'horror', 'movies', 'kind', 'hip', 'horror', 'flick', 'one', 'can', 'go', 'see', 'feel', 'superior', 'reinforced', 'one', 'pseudo-intellectualism', 'come', 'out', 'not', 'feeling', 'one', 'been', 'rolling', 'horror', 'movie', 'mud', 'two', 'hours.The', 'movie', 'obviously', 'infatuated', 'film', 'were', 'fraction', 'enjoyable', 'clever', 'director', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'evidently', 'would', 'be', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'May', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'here', 'get', 'excited', 'about.With', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pity', 'poor', 'May', 'Cannady', 'played', 'effectively', 'lovely', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'film', 'eponymous', 'heroine', 'left', 'friendless', 'parents', 'die', 'evidently', 'lazy', 'eye', 'required', 'wear', 'eyepatch', 'grade', 'school', 'made', 'impossible', 'make', 'friends', 'Not', 'worry', 'shy', 'awkward', 'oddly', 'fetching', 'veterinary', 'assistant', 'creepy', 'little', 'doll', 'glass', 'box', 'doll', 'viewing', 'only', '-look', 'do', ""n't"", 'touch', '.But', 'most', 'awkward', 'teenagers', 'May', 'little', 'more', 'way', 'flesh-and-blood', 'companionship', 'Alas', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'well', 'filmmaker', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'unusually', 'poised', 'effective', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'weird', 'May', 'just', 'little', '*too*', 'weird', '-after', 'student', 'horror', 'film', 'entirely', 'new', 'meaning', 'phrase', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'eat', 'up', 'May', 'show', 'appreciation', 'making', 'out', 'true', 'spirit', 'Sisto', 'cannibalistic', 'little', 'horror', 'film.Her', 'perky', 'co-worker', 'Polly', 'played', 'always', 'nimble', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'alas', 'fickle', 'creature', 'Polly', 'quickly', 'conquest', 'leggy', 'hard-as-nails', 'Ambrosia.And', 'when', 'moment', 'pique', 'May', 'accidentally', 'cat', 'Polly', 'gave', '-well', 'things', 'go', 'pieces', 'hurry', 'everyone', 'when', ""'re"", 'shy', 'weird', 'awkward', 'teen', 'who', 'alone', ""'ve"", 'accidentally', 'brained', 'Kitty', ""'re"", 'just', 'one', 'bad', 'hair', 'day', 'going', 'rest', 'way', 'slaughtering', 'homeless', 'punker', 'pair', 'scissors.But', 'even', 'OK', 'May', 'mommy', 'told', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'friend', 'make', 'one', 'May', 'always', 'been', 'drawn', ""'pieces"", 'boyfriend', 'hands', 'Polly', 'neck', 'Ambrosia', 'legs', 'kitty', 'fur', 'great', 'seamstress', 'can', 'probably', 'see', 'where', 'going.No', 'offense', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'first-time', 'outing', 'movie', 'lot', 'potential', 'Sisto', 'student', 'film', 'gave', 'good', 'laugh', 'cinematography', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'early', 'work', 'well', 'crafted', 'movie', 'acting', 'universally', 'competent', 'as', 'well', 'complaints', 'there.But', 'said', 'craft', 'execution', ""n't"", 'everything', 'Horror', 'films', 'require', 'certain', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'May', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'make', 'character', 'actions', 'understandable', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'May', 'transformation', 'eccentric', 'needy', 'veterinary', 'assistant', 'serial', 'killer', 'specializing', 'vivisection', 'what', 'one', 'bad', 'date', 'pushed', 'edge', 'film', 'pivotal', 'scenes', 'broken', 'glass', 'class', 'full', 'blind', 'children', 'serve', 'up', 'biggest', 'insult', 'handicapped', 'kids', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'say', 'nothing', 'fact', 'idiotic', 'scene', 'sense', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', '30+', 'years', 'planet', 'did', 'blind', 'children', 'suddenly', 'take', 'liking', 'rubbing', 'fragments', 'glass', 'eyes', 'skin', 'final', 'analysis', 'May', 'simply', 'not', 'much', 'fun', 'self-absorbed', 'completely', 'self-confident', 'film', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'McKee', 'unfortunately', 'roughly', 'half', 'as', 'clever', 'painful', 'enough', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'own', 'thing.If', 'dead', 'cats', 'vivisection', 'boring', 'teen-angst', 'instant', 'lunatics', 'are', 'thing', 'might', 'get', 'something', 'May', ""'re"", 'looking', 'truly', 'decent', 'horror', 'movie', 'then', 'avoid', 'one', 'plague']",May
754301,A1KFWSYZIOBI3Y,B00009MEC4,"DaRRen ""Darren""","[2, 3]","This is not a film to take literally. Instead, you have to stand back and appreciate the broader story it tells. That story is about how negative experiences in childhood, create baggage that haunts our adult relationships. And if we fail to get treatment for this baggage, we can spiral out of control and harm those who come into our lives (emotionally or physically).The acting was absolutely superb by all involved. I love Sisto, and I have a new appreciation for the lead actress (I had never seen her work). The movie is packed with metaphors. From the very beginning, the mother takes a minor physical abnormality and rather than encouraging May to appreciate her body, she orders her to cover it up. Hiding herself, only makes her more awkward (are you a pirate?). She never got the chance to fit in because she was always self-conscious and hoping that someone would accept her. This didn't happen at home or at school. In adulthood, this cycle repeats itself. The moments with Sisto were painfully accurate. If you have dealt with your own emotional baggage from childhood, then May's interaction with Sisto's character might resonate.The most brilliant scene, however, involves the blind children. The blind kids would not judge her appearance at all. They wanted to interact with the inner-child that May kept locked up in the glass case. By fighting to shield herself, she ends up getting destroyed. Despite their innocence and their inability to judge the young ""doll,"" May keeps hiding.I love the film. It became a little bloody near the end, but I kept reminding myself that it is not a slasher film. The slashing was simply part of the metaphor.

754302,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00009MEC4,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[7, 9]","Have you ever tried to figure out what something is when your eyes are closed? You grab something round its cool and smooth to the touch. It feels solid so it's not some kind of Nerf ball or anything. Here you are standing in the middle of a room clutching something and you can't quite tell what it is. The object was an apple, but that's not the point.MAY the new film by first time director Lucky McKee is just that kind of movie. At first maybe it's a romance, then again maybe it's a thriller, hmm.... Maybe it's some kind of comedy, light hearted or dark. At first glance you might just think it's a horror film. But May doesn't aspire to labels, it lives in that world beyond them and that's what works and doesn't work for a film like this.MAY is one of those movies like Mullholland Drive, From Dusk `Til Dawn, or Femme Fatale. There is a moment in the film that will either grab you and pull you in, or turn you off and produces nothing but loathing. For me that moment came as the blind kids are well.... I don't think I want to share that sequence with you, but for me it worked.MAY tells the story of a young women named May (Angela Bettis, Girl Interrupted) who seems really sweet on the outside, with just a touch of crazy attached. She had an overbearing mother (Merle Kennedy, Bubble Boy) who wanted her little girl to be perfect. It's just too bad she needed to wear an eye patch to correct a lazy eye. The kids in school all laughed and called her a pirate. To comfort the girl or make her crazy the film doesn't really say, May's mother gives her a prized possession, a freaky looking doll that has to stay in pristine condition in a glass box.Somehow May survives this weird childhood and grows up to be stable but a little nuts. She falls for a guy with perfect hands (Jeremy Sisto, Wrong Turn) and a girl she works with (Anna Faris, Scary Movie) falls for her. Everything is perfect until these people turn their back on May, and well that's when the fun begins....Angela Bettis is excellent; she is really beautiful, really vulnerable, and really expressive without doing much. She gives May this quality that is understated and yet still intense. I like how she says more with one look than lots of silly dialogue. She very much reminded me of a female Travis Bickle. She has a longing for what she can not have and is dealing with it the only way she know how.Like in TAXI DRIVER, there is a moment when May is on the phone with Adam (the Sisto character) and he wants nothing to do with her anymore. Anyone else would have gotten the point. But not May and so when the realization comes, just as when Travis Bickle was dumped by Betsey something inside both of them snaps.Another bright spot is Anna Faris. Why she pigeonholed herself in those stupid comedies is beyond me. She is excellent as May's lesbian workmate. She is bright and spunky and really funny. I'd love to see her do some more legitimate acting work. Hopefully this is the kind of film that she could use to get better roles. Who knows!!!Director McKee makes it look easy. He has crafted a fascinating look into the eyes of a crazy person, by doing what few films can. He allows us to see that part of ourselves that is manifested in May. We've all at one time or another been treated [bad], made fun of, been ridiculed, and maybe some of us have tried to go over the deep end. I felt pity for May even if I shouldn't have. This is a powerful movie, and one of the best I've seen all year.If Hollywood ever got off its rear end and decided that a film like MAY deserved to be shown at the same multiplex as FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY maybe their would be better quality films out there that the general market could consume. Until then it will probably only be discovered by lovers of film. I guess that's not so bad.There are probably others out there that could find fault in a film like MAY. It's that kind of cinema, either you love it or your hate it. There is not much middle ground.

754308,A57Q87B0TC9IJ,B00009MEC4,Derek G,"[2, 4]","While most were out watching the crop of predictable horror movies (rewritten movie scripts from the 70's and 80's), this gem of a movie quietly slipped under the radar.  Unfortunate, as it is significantly better than the brain-dead slasher films currently in release. May is a horror movie with a human face.  Imagine a deep examination of Stephen King's ""Carrie,"" and you'll have an idea where this movie is going.May has trouble making friends.  Having spent the majority of her childhood ridiculed and tormented, the seeds are sown for May to be quiet, insecure, and alone.  Her overprotective mother feels giving her daughter a doll would help, yet she keeps it in a glass case with strict orders not to open.  Enclosed and inaccessable, it serves only to deepen her inability to communicate with others.As an adult, this painfully shy waif (Angela Bettis), finds herself working at a veterinary clinic and attracted to an auto mechanic (Jeremy Sisto). Her attempts to get him to notice her existence are both painful and amusing.  You'll find yourself cheering her on in her success.  Upon deeper examination, we find Adam to be kind of a slacker, with a taste for art-house sleaze and, as he puts it, ""weird girls.""  Between him, her parents, and the other characters she meets in her life, including her inept boss, and a trashy co-worker, you start to wonder if she really is that odd in comparison.Directed by Lucky McKee, May is a film that succeeds in spite of its obvious low budget.  Filled with symbolism and allegory, the story works; with one glaring exception.  When things start going wrong and violence ensues, the attempts at realistic violence end up looking more campy then serious.  There are some disturbing scenes that are pulled off incredibly well in spite of the budget, and the film ends on a bloody note with slight thoughtful contemplation.  By this time, though, any sense of morality has fallen by the wayside and you'll either be emotionally touched or hysterical with laughter.Still, May is not without its sense of irony and Angela Bettis plays a powerful, fragile character in a believable descent into madness.  Perhaps it's good this movie wasn't so successful.

Mostly, it's a character study of a strange, isolated girl who works at a veterinary clinic, makes her own pieced-together clothes and talks to a doll. At first she seems to be nothing more than a shy, awkward, wounded soul desperately looking for love and approval. You feel sorry for her, you relate to her, you root for her. About halfway through the film, however, you start to realize that May isn't just strange, she's really nuts. Her character is slowly revealed to be a real psychotic with a taste for blood, and when it happens it's completely unsettling. We haven't seen a character like this since ""Carrie""; a seemingly benevolent misfit pushed over the edge with horrifying consequences.The performances in this film are all really quite good, which is a nice surprise, and rare for a horror film. Angela Bettis' performance as May is a genuine tour de force; she convincingly shows May both at her most awkward and grasping and at her most sinister and bloodthirsty.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 4]","Make what you will of this contemporary 'descent into madness' by the film's principle character of May (played with reserved conviction by Angela Bettis), but, once over, some of the movie's more gruesome moments will stay with you in memory for some time to come.May is a physical and psychological misfit.  Born with a lazy eye and forced to wear an eye patch throughout her childhood, she was scorned by those around her.  Her only childhood friend was a doll -- made by her mother -- but placed into a glass case -- never to be touched by human hands -- always staring hauntingly out with bright blue eyes eclipsing her pale, plastic face.As an adult, May finds work as a veterinary assistant, primarily serving as a surgical assist on animal operations.  It is here that she develops a secret fascination with 'the parts' that make up the whole.  Seeing organs and limbs and fur as items of beauty -- but never enjoying the completeness of the creature -- her view on life continues to become distorted, and, despite every noble attempt to make a human connection (dating a young man whose hands she finds fascinating, selflessly adopting a potentially homeless cat, exploring her sexuality in the form of lesbianism with a colleague at work, etc.), she fails miserably to achieve any lasting bond to any living thing.Her psychosis reaches its catalyst when her lifelong prized possession -- the hyponotic doll under glass -- is accidentally broken from its case ... leaving May with no other choice but to do as her mother did many years before: create her own companion ... but May's activities will take a far more gruesome turn.MAY is reminescent of the works of Cronenberg and early Wes Craven, but what draws its distinctiveness to the horror genre is the fact that the central character is embodied with a frail humanity: May could've been normal -- with a few eccentricities -- had her choices in life brought greater reward.  At the core of any really entertaining monster movie is the human heart; May tries again and again and again to find hers, but it is almost as if life itself has chosen to conspire against her ... leaving her no choice but to succumb to the forces of darkness, forsaking any lasting attempt at discovering the person inside in favor of securing a connection -- any connection -- despite the consequences to others and, ultimately, herself.While much of the film is very palatable, MAY does offer some scenes of true gruesomeness.  Once the character has made her choice -- allowing all the misguided evil to take its toll on her life's companions -- some truly horrific scenes are played out with stark simplicity.  But -- like May's tragic psychosis -- the viewer is treated to visions of madness that will not soon be forgotten.",4,Come What MAY,1082678400,"04 23, 2004",2004,2771,"['Make', 'what', 'will', 'contemporary', ""'descent"", 'madness', 'film', 'principle', 'character', 'May', 'played', 'reserved', 'conviction', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'once', 'movie', 'more', 'gruesome', 'moments', 'will', 'stay', 'memory', 'time', 'come.May', 'physical', 'psychological', 'misfit', 'Born', 'lazy', 'eye', 'forced', 'wear', 'eye', 'patch', 'childhood', 'was', 'scorned', 'only', 'childhood', 'friend', 'was', 'doll', 'made', 'mother', 'placed', 'glass', 'case', 'never', 'be', 'touched', 'human', 'hands', 'always', 'staring', 'hauntingly', 'bright', 'blue', 'eyes', 'eclipsing', 'pale', 'plastic', 'face.As', 'adult', 'May', 'work', 'veterinary', 'assistant', 'primarily', 'serving', 'surgical', 'assist', 'animal', 'operations', 'here', 'secret', 'fascination', ""'the"", 'parts', 'make', 'up', 'whole', 'Seeing', 'organs', 'limbs', 'fur', 'items', 'beauty', 'never', 'enjoying', 'completeness', 'creature', 'view', 'life', 'become', 'distorted', 'noble', 'attempt', 'make', 'human', 'connection', 'dating', 'young', 'man', 'fascinating', 'selflessly', 'adopting', 'potentially', 'homeless', 'cat', 'exploring', 'sexuality', 'form', 'lesbianism', 'colleague', 'work', 'etc', 'miserably', 'achieve', 'lasting', 'bond', 'living', 'thing.Her', 'psychosis', 'catalyst', 'when', 'lifelong', 'prized', 'possession', 'hyponotic', 'doll', 'glass', 'accidentally', 'broken', 'case', 'leaving', 'May', 'other', 'choice', 'do', 'mother', 'did', 'many', 'years', 'create', 'own', 'companion', 'May', 'activities', 'will', 'take', 'far', 'more', 'gruesome', 'turn.MAY', 'reminescent', 'works', 'Cronenberg', 'early', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'what', 'distinctiveness', 'horror', 'genre', 'fact', 'central', 'character', 'embodied', 'frail', 'humanity', 'May', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'normal', 'few', 'eccentricities', 'had', 'choices', 'life', 'brought', 'greater', 'reward', 'core', 'really', 'entertaining', 'monster', 'movie', 'human', 'heart', 'May', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'find', 'hers', 'almost', 'life', 'chosen', 'conspire', 'leaving', 'choice', 'succumb', 'forces', 'darkness', 'forsaking', 'lasting', 'attempt', 'discovering', 'person', 'favor', 'securing', 'connection', 'connection', 'consequences', 'others', 'ultimately', 'herself.While', 'much', 'film', 'very', 'palatable', 'MAY', 'offer', 'scenes', 'true', 'gruesomeness', 'character', 'made', 'choice', 'allowing', 'misguided', 'evil', 'take', 'toll', 'life', 'companions', 'truly', 'horrific', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'stark', 'simplicity', 'May', 'tragic', 'psychosis', 'viewer', 'treated', 'visions', 'madness', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'be', 'forgotten']",May

My expectations were high and I was very disappointed.I think Angela Bettis is a great actress and it is a shame she chose to star in this movie.May is a shy child who lost an eye when she was young. Her best friend is a doll her mother gave her. She grows up to be a veterinary assistant and seamstress. She also has grown up with little understanding of human beings and even less about human sexuality.But May herself is not quite that innocent as she takes some glee at one point of the movie explaining how one of the dogs she worked on later bled to death. This does not make her character more complex only repulsive.May falls in love with an art poseur, who takes on all of the affectations of the weird. But has no sympathy  for humanity or understanding of  art. (Of all the bizarre little trophies this art phony has on his wall you might be able to find his own heart because his chest seems to lack one.)At the office May becomes involved with an aggressive lesbian. This is her brief education in love.The sadistic things that befall this poor woman have no true emotional pay off or resolution at the end of the movie just a gimmick that ""sews things together"" so to speak. The movie is a long walk for a short glass of water. Further rather than the movie being sympathetic to those that are different it is outright attack on them.

754319,A315I4RKNVTUYJ,B00009MEC4,"Harlem Champ ""Harlem Champ""","[4, 5]","I overlooked this film for a long time. Don't get me wrong, i always support independent horror films, low budget; movies that are made for the viewer, the genre and movies that want to say something to true film audiences, not the Hollywood commercialized masses that never venture beyond the multi-million dollar budgeted nonsense. So, i watched May, and was moved, scared, disturbed and was brought to laughter, and almost tears, well, almost, but don't tell anybody....We get just a glimpse of the core of May's suffering when we see her as a child with an eye defect. She is an outcast, to a degree, but her mother's behavior, definitely fed her pain. Soon enough we  see May as an adult, working in a veterinarian clinic. I wont go into detail about what ensues, because by now, you get the idea of what happens in the film  from all of these great in-depth reviews that are written here.The film was brilliant in many ways. The acting was top notch, especially from the lead Angela Bettis as May, wow such a powerful performance by her! Im sure she was better than many female leads the year this film was released..by far! Her acting is powerful. She moved me, made me feel such compassion and sadness for her, that in a way, i wasn't furious at her for what she did, although i was like ""damn May... dont do it."" hahaaha.  There is a point in the movie when we see her take her first step into the world of becoming psychotic, and even within that place, I still never hated her. People were cruel to her, not extremely cruel, but most had little if any regards towards understanding her extremely fragile soul, in fact people saw her fragility.. and took advantage. The lack of humanity and compassion for others and their weaknesses is a very strong theme here. The characters here who hurt May, seemed more concerned with their own ego, and not how May could be affected by their own immediate selfish needs. You see no one was brutal or vicious with her, it was more of a passive aggressive abuse that she endured, which of course can have a terrible effect on one as well.Even within her venture into insanity, we see May still has compassion, such is evident when she is working with blind children, a scene that is quite heavy. May begins to totally lose her mind, and although we cannot excuse her acts, we utterly understand where it comes from. I was saddened to see her go into that realm, throughout the movie i wished i could have helped her, explained things to her, helped her understand her own pain. Thats how great Angel Bettis' performance  was, you kinda wanted to jump into the film and protect her. It bothered me to see someone  being psychologically abused as an adult, especially when they come from that history as a child. May was not so much a character study, but more so an examination of the after-shock.. the results of a damaged soul. But as i said, even on another level, it's a study on those people that move through life not concerned with their words and actions which can be hurtful, even crushing to an already fractured human being.I really dug this film. It was much more than a horror film., and by the way, it had some blood and guts too, for those that want that, but it wasn't too brutal. May was superb.. acting, direction, story line, creepiness, emotions.. so much was conveyed here that makes me so appreciative of this film, i am really thankful i added this to my collection. ""Horror films"" like this, need to be revered..and watched, more often than these terrible shock type blood and guts, CGI remakes that Hollywood pumps out by the dozens. This will be a classic, well..it already is i believe!Readers, please forgive me, I didn't want to give an in-depth review on the plot, the characters, their development and all a' that stuff, because as i stated in the beginning many other reviewers did that brilliantly so i didn't just want to be repetitive, i wanted to express to you the emotions it made me feel and the power of the things within the film that stuck with me throughout it, and i think that's what great films are meant to do, touch us in certain ways, allow us to examine, relate or understand life through film. May definitely stays with you.Angela Bettis in a fair world, should have been nominated for her performance....Peace people..",5,"The despair of unhealed, childhood psychological trauma....",1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,4317,"['overlooked', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'i', 'always', 'support', 'independent', 'horror', 'films', 'low', 'budget', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'viewer', 'genre', 'movies', 'want', 'say', 'something', 'true', 'film', 'audiences', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'commercialized', 'masses', 'never', 'venture', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'budgeted', 'nonsense', 'So', 'i', 'watched', 'May', 'was', 'moved', 'scared', 'disturbed', 'was', 'brought', 'laughter', 'almost', 'tears', 'well', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anybody', '.We', 'get', 'just', 'glimpse', 'core', 'May', 'suffering', 'when', 'see', 'child', 'eye', 'defect', 'outcast', 'degree', 'mother', 'behavior', 'definitely', 'fed', 'pain', 'Soon', 'see', 'May', 'adult', 'working', 'veterinarian', 'clinic', 'wont', 'go', 'detail', 'what', 'ensues', 'now', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'in-depth', 'reviews', 'are', 'written', 'here.The', 'film', 'was', 'brilliant', 'many', 'ways', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'especially', 'lead', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'May', 'wow', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Im', 'sure', 'was', 'better', 'many', 'female', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'released..by', 'far', 'acting', 'powerful', 'moved', 'made', 'feel', 'such', 'compassion', 'sadness', 'way', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'furious', 'what', 'did', 'i', 'was', 'damn', 'May', 'dont', 'do', 'hahaaha', 'point', 'movie', 'when', 'see', 'take', 'first', 'step', 'world', 'becoming', 'psychotic', 'even', 'place', 'still', 'never', 'hated', 'People', 'were', 'cruel', 'not', 'extremely', 'cruel', 'most', 'had', 'little', 'regards', 'towards', 'understanding', 'extremely', 'fragile', 'soul', 'fact', 'people', 'saw', 'fragility..', 'took', 'advantage', 'lack', 'humanity', 'compassion', 'others', 'weaknesses', 'very', 'strong', 'theme', 'here', 'characters', 'here', 'who', 'hurt', 'May', 'seemed', 'more', 'concerned', 'own', 'ego', 'not', 'how', 'May', 'could', 'be', 'affected', 'own', 'immediate', 'selfish', 'needs', 'see', 'one', 'was', 'brutal', 'vicious', 'was', 'more', 'passive', 'aggressive', 'abuse', 'endured', 'course', 'can', 'have', 'terrible', 'effect', 'one', 'well.Even', 'venture', 'insanity', 'see', 'May', 'still', 'compassion', 'such', 'evident', 'when', 'working', 'blind', 'children', 'scene', 'quite', 'heavy', 'May', 'totally', 'lose', 'mind', 'can', 'not', 'excuse', 'acts', 'utterly', 'understand', 'where', 'was', 'saddened', 'see', 'go', 'realm', 'movie', 'i', 'wished', 'i', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'explained', 'things', 'helped', 'understand', 'own', 'pain', 'Thats', 'how', 'great', 'Angel', 'Bettis', 'performance', 'was', 'kinda', 'wanted', 'jump', 'film', 'protect', 'bothered', 'see', 'someone', 'being', 'psychologically', 'abused', 'adult', 'especially', 'when', 'come', 'history', 'child', 'May', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'study', 'more', 'so', 'examination', 'after-shock..', 'results', 'damaged', 'soul', 'i', 'said', 'even', 'level', 'study', 'people', 'move', 'life', 'not', 'concerned', 'words', 'actions', 'can', 'be', 'hurtful', 'even', 'crushing', 'already', 'fractured', 'human', 'being.I', 'really', 'dug', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'horror', 'film.', 'way', 'had', 'blood', 'guts', 'too', 'want', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'brutal', 'May', 'was', 'superb..', 'acting', 'direction', 'story', 'line', 'creepiness', 'emotions..', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'conveyed', 'here', 'appreciative', 'film', 'i', 'am', 'really', 'thankful', 'i', 'added', 'collection', 'Horror', 'films', 'need', 'be', 'revered..and', 'watched', 'more', 'often', 'terrible', 'shock', 'type', 'blood', 'guts', 'CGI', 'Hollywood', 'pumps', 'out', 'dozens', 'will', 'be', 'classic', 'well..it', 'already', 'i', 'believe', 'Readers', 'please', 'forgive', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'in-depth', 'review', 'plot', 'characters', 'development', 'stuff', 'i', 'stated', 'beginning', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', 'brilliantly', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'want', 'be', 'repetitive', 'i', 'wanted', 'express', 'emotions', 'made', 'feel', 'power', 'things', 'film', 'stuck', 'i', 'think', 'what', 'great', 'films', 'are', 'meant', 'do', 'touch', 'certain', 'ways', 'allow', 'examine', 'relate', 'understand', 'life', 'film', 'May', 'definitely', 'you.Angela', 'Bettis', 'fair', 'world', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'performance', '.Peace', 'people..']",May

It started off well enough, establishing wall flower weirdo May as an off-kilter character that isn't yet psychotic enough to not pity.  The story eventually slides into the blood and shock zone as May's sanity unravels and her craziness comes to the surface.  The end of the film is predictable and silly while trying to be disturbing and cool.  Everyone involved is doing a decent job for an independant flick, however the plot in the second half mars what could've been a creepy character study.

754321,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B00009MEC4,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[3, 14]","My title line says it all.  ""May"" is a hybrid, a cross between ""Carrie"" and ""Pieces"".  Without a doubt, May is a crazy little girl, pretty but crazy.  Angela Bettis does a good job as May in this cute little flick that thinks it's a horror movie, but it's not.  What's scary about it?  Nothing.  It does not have the atmosphere of ""Carrie"" (not that ""Carrie"" was a great ""horror"" movie either, but it was pretty good), but it does have its share of blood and gore like ""Pieces"" although not to the extreme of ""Pieces"" I must admit.May is a different type of girl who does not fit in society.  She is looking for the perfect friend.  Too bad there are no such things as perfect people though.  She likes one guy's hands, one girl's legs, someone else's this, someone else's that and so on and so forth.  Is ""May"" entertaining?  Somewhat.  Is it horror?  Not exactly and definitely not scary in the strict sense of the term.Actually, ""May"" is more of a psychological study of the character, May, and from that standpoint it is okay.  If you attempt to analyze May's character, this movie can be quite interesting...if you are looking for something scary and darkly thought-provoking that will definitely keep you up at night, you won't find it here.  It is fine to have a movie about freaky people, but do not expect it to be scary...""May"" gives too much of itself away as well during the movie, and there is little suspense.  If you have ever seen ""Maniac"" starring Joe Spinelli, it does the same thing, and the result is a lackluster ""horror movie"" and I use that term loosely here.Suspense, a scary atmosphere, plot development and an interesting and scary storyline will get you a scary movie.  For examples of great cinematic horror, just check out the classics: Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", Tobe Hooper's ""Salem's Lot"", John Carpenter's ""Halloween"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Omen"" the original ""Black Christmas"", the original ""When a Stranger Calls"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"".

I cannot say whether ""May"" got a theatrical release or not, but the film is available on DVD and is well worth picking up if you are a horror film aficionado or if you just enjoy great acting performances.Angela Bettis plays May, a young woman with several serious mental issues. Her problems started as a child, when doctors diagnosed May with an eye problem that required an eye patch. Of course, the kids at school thought May was a pirate or flat out ignored her. The parents did not provide much in the way of assistance either, as May's mother falls into the ""overprotective and abrasive"" category. When May celebrates a birthday, her mother presents her with a fancy doll enclosed in a glass case. Her daughter wishes to take the doll out and play with it, but Mom goes off the deep end and lectures May on the necessity of never taking the doll out of its box. This doll plays a significant role in May's later life, as the young woman believes the toy is her only real friend in the world. In short, May's childhood provides the foundations for a life loaded with insecurity, boredom, and a complete inability to connect with other people on an emotional level. May is one troubled person.Most of the film deals with May's awkward attempts to function in real life. Her job as a medical assistant at a veterinary clinic allows some contact with a verbally challenged doctor and a goofy lesbian co-worker who keeps her eye firmly fixed on May, but May longs for a boyfriend to fulfill her ambitions. This dream of love takes on a new dimension when she notices Adam (Jeremy Sisto), a guy who spends his time slouching around in a cafe, smoking cigarettes, and attending Dario Argento film festivals. Obviously, Adam doesn't even notice the existence of May until the she makes several painfully inept maneuvers designed to grab his attention. May succeeds to some extent, but ultimately her fragile mental state causes problems that threaten to send May into a downward spiral of bloody violence committed against anyone who ever wronged her.""May"" is Angela Bettis's film, body and soul. Since she fills the shoes of the title character, Bettis's performance should command most of the audience's attention. Thank goodness she possesses the necessary chops to carry out the role to perfection. I cannot remember the last time I saw an actor/actress convey the range of emotions that Bettis adroitly delivers in this film. The viewer knows May has serious problems, but at the same time the character is oddly charming. The embarrassing interactions with Adam, the painful encounters with her trampy co-worker, and her attempts to reach out and help a class of blind children all reveal a young woman desperate to make friends and live like a normal person. Even more disconcerting for the viewer is the realization that May is, well, cute. Just when you notice May doing something bizarre, you cannot help recognizing that this girl is alluring no matter how quirky she is. That's the mark of a fine actress when a performance conveys two opposing emotions at the same time, and Bettis does it with ease. Who is this amazing young lady? The only other role of note I found for her was in the Winona Ryder vehicle ""Girl, Interrupted."" Keep an eye on Bettis because if ""May"" is any indication, this gal ought to go far in the future. You seldom see a performance of this caliber in a low budget horror film.My only complaint with ""May"" concerns a lack of sufficient background about the title character. We do get a few scenes about May's childhood, but I think a bit more development in that area would have helped flesh out the story. It's a niggling complaint because the picture works splendidly overall. Kudos to Lion's Gate for releasing this on DVD with a great film transfer and two commentaries with the director and actors. It's a darn shame more people don't know anything about this movie. The time has come to spread the word about ""May"": this is an immensely entertaining horror film with a great actress doing great work in the lead role.",5,"Angela Bettis Works Wonders in ""May""",1062115200,"08 29, 2003",2003,4617,"['suspect', 'movie', 'May', 'snuck', 'most', 'people', 'radar', 'fact', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'wonderful', 'little', 'picture', 'even', 'now', 'only', 'came', 'pure', 'chance', 'read', 'short', 'review', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'am', 'certainly', 'glad', 'watched', 'May', 'film', 'meek', 'young', 'woman', 'desperate', 'need', 'belong', 'really', 'delivers', 'multiple', 'levels', 'movie', 'fact', 'are', 'plenty', 'films', 'floating', 'around', 'there', 'deserve', 'more', 'attention', 'receive', 'general', 'audiences', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'May', 'got', 'theatrical', 'release', 'not', 'film', 'available', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'are', 'horror', 'film', 'aficionado', 'just', 'enjoy', 'great', 'acting', 'performances.Angela', 'Bettis', 'May', 'young', 'woman', 'several', 'serious', 'mental', 'issues', 'problems', 'started', 'child', 'when', 'doctors', 'diagnosed', 'May', 'eye', 'problem', 'required', 'eye', 'patch', 'course', 'kids', 'school', 'thought', 'May', 'was', 'pirate', 'flat', 'out', 'ignored', 'parents', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'much', 'way', 'assistance', 'either', 'May', 'mother', 'overprotective', 'abrasive', 'category', 'When', 'May', 'birthday', 'mother', 'fancy', 'doll', 'enclosed', 'glass', 'case', 'daughter', 'take', 'doll', 'out', 'play', 'Mom', 'deep', 'end', 'lectures', 'May', 'necessity', 'never', 'taking', 'doll', 'box', 'doll', 'significant', 'role', 'May', 'later', 'life', 'young', 'woman', 'toy', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'world', 'short', 'May', 'childhood', 'foundations', 'life', 'loaded', 'insecurity', 'boredom', 'complete', 'inability', 'connect', 'other', 'people', 'emotional', 'level', 'May', 'one', 'troubled', 'person.Most', 'film', 'deals', 'May', 'awkward', 'function', 'real', 'life', 'job', 'medical', 'assistant', 'veterinary', 'clinic', 'contact', 'verbally', 'challenged', 'doctor', 'goofy', 'lesbian', 'co-worker', 'who', 'eye', 'firmly', 'fixed', 'May', 'May', 'longs', 'boyfriend', 'fulfill', 'ambitions', 'dream', 'love', 'new', 'dimension', 'when', 'Adam', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'guy', 'who', 'time', 'slouching', 'around', 'cafe', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'attending', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'film', 'festivals', 'Obviously', 'Adam', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'existence', 'May', 'several', 'painfully', 'inept', 'maneuvers', 'designed', 'grab', 'attention', 'May', 'extent', 'ultimately', 'fragile', 'mental', 'state', 'causes', 'problems', 'threaten', 'send', 'May', 'downward', 'spiral', 'bloody', 'violence', 'committed', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'wronged', 'May', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'film', 'body', 'soul', 'shoes', 'title', 'character', 'Bettis', 'performance', 'should', 'command', 'most', 'audience', 'attention', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'necessary', 'chops', 'carry', 'out', 'role', 'perfection', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'actor/actress', 'convey', 'range', 'emotions', 'Bettis', 'adroitly', 'film', 'viewer', 'May', 'serious', 'problems', 'same', 'time', 'character', 'oddly', 'charming', 'embarrassing', 'interactions', 'Adam', 'painful', 'encounters', 'trampy', 'co-worker', 'attempts', 'reach', 'out', 'help', 'class', 'blind', 'children', 'reveal', 'young', 'woman', 'desperate', 'make', 'friends', 'live', 'normal', 'person', 'Even', 'more', 'disconcerting', 'viewer', 'realization', 'May', 'well', 'cute', 'Just', 'when', 'notice', 'May', 'doing', 'something', 'bizarre', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'recognizing', 'girl', 'alluring', 'matter', 'how', 'quirky', 'mark', 'fine', 'actress', 'when', 'performance', 'conveys', 'two', 'opposing', 'emotions', 'same', 'time', 'Bettis', 'ease', 'Who', 'amazing', 'young', 'lady', 'only', 'other', 'role', 'note', 'found', 'was', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'vehicle', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'eye', 'Bettis', 'May', 'indication', 'gal', 'ought', 'go', 'far', 'future', 'seldom', 'see', 'performance', 'caliber', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'only', 'complaint', 'May', 'lack', 'sufficient', 'background', 'title', 'character', 'do', 'get', 'few', 'scenes', 'May', 'childhood', 'think', 'bit', 'more', 'development', 'area', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'niggling', 'complaint', 'picture', 'splendidly', 'overall', 'Kudos', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'great', 'film', 'transfer', 'two', 'commentaries', 'director', 'actors', 'darn', 'shame', 'more', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'movie', 'time', 'come', 'spread', 'word', 'May', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'horror', 'film', 'great', 'actress', 'doing', 'great', 'work', 'lead', 'role']",May

Although some elements of ""May"" are classic horror, the movie is unlike any other horror I have seen in ages. Because it's more or less a coming of age type of movie.Angela Bettis plays the title role like a fine violinist in a symphony orchestra. Her lack of empathy, and her dispassionate emotions about life in general come off as so real and honest that I can almost reach out and touch her. There is something about May that is so familiar and almost inviting. She wants people around her so much. And as she is pulling them in closer with 1 hand, she is simultaneously pushing them away with the other. Jeremy Sisto as May's sometimes boyfriend Adam also was compelling while also being distant and maintaining a level of macabre.""May"" movie and character respectively are both incredibly complex. It's really like watching a movie within a movie within a movie. There is a lot going on. And anyone with a beating heart will have to feel something for May. If you're expecting the usual gore-fest (which I love, BTW) this movie is not for you. Instead, ""May"" is a tangled web of psychosis, betrayal, suspense and intrigue.I judge a good movie not just on how much I was entertained while it was on, but also by how much it provoked thought. ""May"" was able to provoke a lot of thought because there are so many people in this world that we throw away and probably resurface as May.

754330,A1D1SP3AOXDP4H,B00009MEC4,Jimmy Lin,"[3, 6]","Dispensing with issues of originality - the world through the eyes of a serial killer has been done numerous times, and the &quot;assembly&quot; aspect was exploited in 'Pieces' and other flicks - 'May' is probably the most painful and subtley creepy film I've seen in a long time.  Think of 'Pieces' meeting 'Willard' and 'Carrie,' and you can get a pretty good idea of the story.But that tells you nothing about the film itself, which is pretty spectacular.  'May' re-affirms my personal notion that the best horror movies are done independently, or at least with a small budget.  Without money to pay for huge amounts of effects or stupid sound tricks (the American version of 'The Ring' was particularly abusive in that department), small-budget horror movies tend to focus on plot, mood, and the essential elements of scary.  Too often, major studio flicks give you gore, loud sudden noises, blood, a couple of ddark corners to peek around, a cop chase, and some idiots who you actually want to buy the farm (screaming, bleeding, and dismembered all the way).  What you get with 'May' is a story that's sometimes painful to watch because it's so simple and touches on little aspects of wanting to wanted in that everyone can sympathize with.Angela Bettis does an excellent job portraying the shy, pretty, and agonizingly akward May, a social outcast from childhood due to an eye condition.  Our protagonist makes halting attempts to connect with other people but is often thwarted by her insecurities and social ineptness.  It doesn't help that the people she interacts with most are a blustery foreign vet and a loopy lesbian tramp (boss and coworker, respectively).  Her best friend is a doll her mother made, part of a huge collection that she uses to stimulate real relationships.  Her behavior would be endearing on a seven-year-old, but May is obviously in her twenties, so it's just creepy.When she does make a connection, she wrenches the works by simply not knowing where the line that divides attractive eccentricity and plain weirdness ends.  It's painful to watch her try so hard and creepy to see what she simply accepts as acceptable.  You know she just doesn't know any better, so you sympathize - but you can't help but feel grossed out.  Because of your sympathy with her, you are drawn into the rhythm of her spiraling breakdown.  You can almost hear the &quot;snap!&quot; that takes her over the edge and down the dark bloody path that she walks for the last twenty minutes of the film.You cringe, you blanch, and you stare in horrified bemusement - but you just can't hate this girl, even though you know she's not right in the head.  Because she just wants to be seen, to be loved - and we all know what that's like.  Pick this up if you're tired of the regular Hollywood pandering and take a little ride into a strange little world.  May's waiting for you, and she's already deciding what parts of you she likes.",4,just the cutest little psycho ever!,1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,2939,"['Dispensing', 'issues', 'originality', 'world', 'eyes', 'serial', 'killer', 'been', 'done', 'numerous', 'times', 'quot', 'assembly', 'quot', 'aspect', 'was', 'exploited', ""'Pieces"", 'other', 'flicks', ""'May"", 'probably', 'most', 'painful', 'subtley', 'creepy', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Think', ""'Pieces"", 'meeting', ""'Willard"", ""'Carrie"", 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'story.But', 'nothing', 'film', 'pretty', 'spectacular', ""'May"", 're-affirms', 'personal', 'notion', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'done', 'independently', 'least', 'small', 'budget', 'money', 'pay', 'huge', 'amounts', 'effects', 'stupid', 'sound', 'tricks', 'American', 'version', ""'The"", 'Ring', 'was', 'particularly', 'abusive', 'department', 'small-budget', 'horror', 'movies', 'tend', 'focus', 'plot', 'mood', 'essential', 'elements', 'scary', 'Too', 'often', 'major', 'studio', 'flicks', 'give', 'gore', 'loud', 'sudden', 'noises', 'blood', 'couple', 'ddark', 'corners', 'peek', 'around', 'cop', 'chase', 'idiots', 'who', 'actually', 'want', 'buy', 'farm', 'screaming', 'bleeding', 'dismembered', 'way', 'What', 'get', ""'May"", 'story', 'sometimes', 'painful', 'watch', 'so', 'simple', 'touches', 'little', 'aspects', 'wanting', 'wanted', 'everyone', 'can', 'sympathize', 'with.Angela', 'Bettis', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'shy', 'pretty', 'agonizingly', 'akward', 'May', 'social', 'outcast', 'childhood', 'due', 'eye', 'condition', 'protagonist', 'halting', 'attempts', 'connect', 'other', 'people', 'often', 'thwarted', 'insecurities', 'social', 'ineptness', ""n't"", 'help', 'people', 'most', 'are', 'blustery', 'foreign', 'vet', 'loopy', 'lesbian', 'tramp', 'boss', 'coworker', 'respectively', 'best', 'friend', 'doll', 'mother', 'made', 'part', 'huge', 'collection', 'stimulate', 'real', 'relationships', 'behavior', 'would', 'be', 'endearing', 'seven-year-old', 'May', 'obviously', 'twenties', 'just', 'creepy.When', 'make', 'connection', 'works', 'simply', 'not', 'knowing', 'where', 'line', 'attractive', 'eccentricity', 'plain', 'weirdness', 'painful', 'watch', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'creepy', 'see', 'what', 'simply', 'acceptable', 'know', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'sympathize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'grossed', 'out', 'sympathy', 'are', 'drawn', 'rhythm', 'spiraling', 'breakdown', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'quot', 'quot', 'edge', 'dark', 'bloody', 'path', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film.You', 'cringe', 'blanch', 'stare', 'horrified', 'bemusement', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', 'girl', 'even', 'know', 'not', 'right', 'head', 'just', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'loved', 'know', 'what', 'Pick', 'up', ""'re"", 'tired', 'regular', 'Hollywood', 'pandering', 'take', 'little', 'ride', 'strange', 'little', 'world', 'May', 'waiting', 'already', 'deciding', 'what', 'parts']",May

754337,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00009MEC4,K. Driscoll,"[6, 8]","The technically strong Lucky McKee may become a great director one day, he might make films that don't reek of cliches and artsy shock but keep the rest of his talents intact. May is a good film that suffers from being obstructively unoriginal and at times even vexing. The cast is small but strong in that mostly their characters were written and directed with very careful hands.May is a very quirky and awkward girl with a lazy eye that has sort of fallen into her own little world of self-hatred so deep she can't even detect it anymore, so neither does McKee.  May falls deeper as she attempts to build relationships with people that falter in trust and cause May to suffer further. She is given a doll by her Mom when she is young and as we lay in wait for the doll to spring to life this never happens because quite simply May is not that kind of horror film...the doll is her only friend and possibly the darkest side of her warped mind. It is a film about a girl who finds something to actually live for and she goes all out to get it...as disturbing as that may be when you see what it is.Anna Faris (from Scary Movie) co-stars along with Jeremy Sisto and Nichole Hiltz.  I actually knew Nichole in High School and she was both a smart and sweet girl.  It's nice to see her succeed. May is played by who could be among the most overlooked talents in film today. Her name is Angela Bettis and we will probably see a lot of her in the future. I hope Angela decides it's best to take on roles like this....she literally carried this film and it would've been a far lesser film without her. Anyway, the only thing I know her from is the television remake of Carrie which is ironic because I just mentioned this in my review of Depalma's version of the Stephen King story. The parallels with Carrie and May have come up and I'm here to tell you they are completely unjustified. Bettis' performances in particular are light years apart. Angela Bettis is oddly attractive but the only way to describe here is profoundly scary looking. She was perfect for the role but I suspect the performance was more her work than McKee's.Personally, I don't think we'll see McKee conquer filmmaking or even put out another good independent film. May borrows from a bevy of independent films and the style of his music being off beat with the film's true guise is nothing new and neither is the unexpected humor in the first hour of the movie. My major gripe with May was the unusual ""Halloween make-over"" that the major character took on in the last twenty minutes of the film. All of sudden she goes from being this insecure and frail little weirdo to being this confident and sexy killer. I didn't miss anything here I can assure you.  I get why it happened but I did not find the film compelling in any way beyond this point. It simply made the horror of the last half seem so unbelievable. Sure, this flaw can be explained away but it just didn't sit right with me. She seems to drift right back to herself by the films end too as though some other character took her over...I don't doubt that was in fact the film's intention but the lead character was already fully capable of these horrific actions in the first place. Anyway, May's flaws aside, what happens here could rarely be pulled off by any other movie that takes itself seriously and for that I recommend it. If you like horror this little movie is totally worth your time as it's scare tactics are unexpected and deeper than most and its conclusion is unforgettable.",3,Nothing Really Special Here,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,3522,"['technically', 'strong', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'may', 'become', 'great', 'director', 'one', 'day', 'might', 'make', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'reek', 'cliches', 'artsy', 'shock', 'keep', 'rest', 'talents', 'intact', 'May', 'good', 'film', 'being', 'obstructively', 'unoriginal', 'times', 'even', 'vexing', 'cast', 'small', 'strong', 'mostly', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'directed', 'very', 'careful', 'hands.May', 'very', 'quirky', 'awkward', 'girl', 'lazy', 'eye', 'sort', 'fallen', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'self-hatred', 'so', 'deep', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'detect', 'anymore', 'neither', 'McKee', 'May', 'deeper', 'build', 'relationships', 'people', 'falter', 'trust', 'cause', 'May', 'suffer', 'further', 'given', 'doll', 'Mom', 'when', 'young', 'lay', 'wait', 'doll', 'spring', 'life', 'never', 'quite', 'simply', 'May', 'not', 'kind', 'horror', 'film', 'doll', 'only', 'friend', 'possibly', 'darkest', 'side', 'warped', 'mind', 'film', 'girl', 'who', 'something', 'actually', 'live', 'get', 'as', 'disturbing', 'may', 'be', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'Faris', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'co-stars', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Nichole', 'Hiltz', 'actually', 'knew', 'Nichole', 'High', 'School', 'was', 'smart', 'sweet', 'girl', 'nice', 'see', 'succeed', 'May', 'played', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'overlooked', 'talents', 'film', 'today', 'name', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'will', 'probably', 'see', 'lot', 'future', 'hope', 'Angela', 'best', 'take', 'roles', 'literally', 'carried', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'far', 'lesser', 'film', 'Anyway', 'only', 'thing', 'know', 'television', 'remake', 'Carrie', 'ironic', 'just', 'mentioned', 'review', 'Depalma', 'version', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'parallels', 'Carrie', 'May', 'have', 'come', 'up', ""'m"", 'here', 'tell', 'are', 'completely', 'unjustified', 'Bettis', 'performances', 'particular', 'are', 'light', 'years', 'apart', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'oddly', 'attractive', 'only', 'way', 'describe', 'here', 'profoundly', 'scary', 'looking', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'suspect', 'performance', 'was', 'more', 'work', ""McKee's.Personally"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'see', 'McKee', 'conquer', 'filmmaking', 'even', 'put', 'out', 'good', 'independent', 'film', 'May', 'bevy', 'independent', 'films', 'style', 'music', 'being', 'off', 'beat', 'film', 'true', 'guise', 'nothing', 'new', 'unexpected', 'humor', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'major', 'gripe', 'May', 'was', 'unusual', 'Halloween', 'make-over', 'major', 'character', 'took', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'sudden', 'being', 'insecure', 'frail', 'little', 'weirdo', 'being', 'confident', 'sexy', 'killer', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'here', 'can', 'assure', 'get', 'why', 'happened', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'film', 'compelling', 'way', 'point', 'simply', 'made', 'horror', 'last', 'half', 'seem', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'Sure', 'flaw', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'away', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'drift', 'right', 'back', 'films', 'end', 'too', 'other', 'character', 'took', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'was', 'fact', 'film', 'intention', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'already', 'fully', 'capable', 'horrific', 'actions', 'first', 'place', 'Anyway', 'May', 'flaws', 'aside', 'what', 'here', 'could', 'rarely', 'be', 'pulled', 'off', 'other', 'movie', 'seriously', 'recommend', 'like', 'horror', 'little', 'movie', 'totally', 'worth', 'time', 'scare', 'tactics', 'are', 'unexpected', 'deeper', 'most', 'conclusion', 'unforgettable']",May

754339,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,B00009MEC4,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[23, 26]","Angelina Bettis stars in this predictable, but creepy and well-made gothic thriller about a very shy and disturbed young woman with a lazy eye. When she's little, she has to wear an eye patch, and no-one wants to be her friend, so her mom gives her a rather disturbing-looking dolly in a glass case and tells her that if you can't find a friend, the next best thing is to make one! Hmmm, I wonder what's going to happen when she takes up sewing and a job at the veterinary clinic. As if that's not enough to telegraph the ending, the first shot in the film is one from the final scene. I guess they figured the audience might get bored if they didn't open with something flashy, I don't know. Non-linear opening shots are kind of cool, when we flash back and towards the end find out the story around the shot, but it would have been more effective left out.Jeremy Sisto (who fans of Six Feet Under will know can be creepy himself) plays an artist who worships Dario Argento (really!) only to find himself involuntarily the middle of a real life Argento film. Anna Farris (from the Scary Movie series) plays her flaky, promiscuous co-worker, who I'm pretty sure is a lesbian (yes, I'm being sarcastic, she's all over May like a cheap suit about 3 seconds after meeting her).May tells her doll, who she still has and keeps in a glass case, all about her new potential friends... but slowly begins to become unhinged when things don't work out the way she wanted... and her doll gives her bad advice.Some critics complained that the movie tries to 'have it both ways' and be funny and scary, but I thought it found an OK balance, there's plenty of pitch-black humor that doesn't seem out of place. Again, nearly any horror fan will guess where the movie is going, but it's still fairly original, well-made and so twisted for a fairly mainstream release movie that it's still entertaining and worth at least a rental. Great acting from Angela Bettis. I'm pretty hard to gross out, but I'm squeamish about eyes, and I had to cover mine during at least two scenes. NOTE: Cat lovers should also skip the scene titled 'Cat Lover' #15 on the DVD.Includes nods to Maniac, Night of the Living Dead, Pieces, Opera, and most strongly, Polanski's Repulsion, so that's always cool. I also can't help but admire the filmmakers who somehow managed to get May financed and made-- no WAY could this have been an easy sell, no matter how they pitched it.The DVD includes two commentary tracks, both of them have oddball commentators such as 'Craft Services Guy'. The commentary is a little too self-consciously wacky in parts, but has some interesting trivia. The easter egg can be found by clicking on the nearly invisible Lion's Gate logo on the main menu--there's a trailer for May, as well as others.

I was both pleased and unsatisfied at the same time. I won't bother going through the plot since it is already outlined in some of the other reviews in great detail.The movie has a constant creepy feeling through the whole thing, which is a very good mood for a horror movie to have. I commend the directors/actors on achieving that. The story, while not exactly totally original, is rather fresh and more unique than anything I have seen in a horror flick recently. I think the shining light for this movie was the acting. ""May"" was played wonderfully by Angela Bettis and her character convinced me of her weirdness. The supporting cast was good enough and I liked Anna Farris as the lesbian []. It developed some very funny (albeit unintentional) humor.The downsides to the film are that I felt, quite frankly, a lot of it was boring. The first 50 minutes has pretty much nothing going on. I understand that we need the story developed and we need just how weird she is illustrated, but that doesn't change the fact that I was bored through some of it. I thought I'd been watching the movie for 40 minutes when I looked at the clock and it had been 20. Some of it is interesting, but I would say I was bored through about half of that first 50-55 minutes.And while the ending is both expected and anticipated, there is a slight (I'll call it a ""twist"" for lack of a better word) that is quite good. Hence earning another half a star in my book. The last 20 minutes (especially the last 5) are pretty good. I wish more of the movie was like that.All in all an entertaining horror movie that came out of left field.

Nothing happened for the first hour, then something gross yet predictable happened, then the rest of the movie was silly and even more utterly predictable. A good cast was wasted in this film, which needed a decent scriptwriter like the Sahara needs rain. The only loveable character in the whole movie gets killed by an ashtray, and after that, if you're anything like me, you just won't care about the fate of the rest of them. I don't think this qualified as a horror movie, because horror movies are supposed to have you on the edge of your seat, scared and wondering what's going to happen next. This movie just had me betting with my boyfriend what would happen next (I predicted pretty much everything that happened -- if only lottery numbers were this easy to predict!) and wishing that time would magically find a way to move faster so the slow and steady torture could be over. The only real horror was in how much I payed to buy the dumb DVD. My boyfriend (who isn't normally squeamish; I mean, his favourite show is 'Dexter'!) stopped watching the movie after the disgusting ashtray scene. He refused to go on. Even seeing Anna Faris as a hot and promiscuous gay woman wasn't enough to tempt him to continue. I finished the movie without him. I wish I hadn't bothered, though. This was BAD. It tried to be edgy and daring and titillating, but in the end, it became a hollow mockery of all those things.

In a such a film, the conflict is introduced early on, and the rest of the film consists of putting teenagers in harms way. In this film; however, the bulk of the story is spent on watching this young woman's world crumble apart. A concept that's foreshadowed by her doll confined to a box. Many compare this to ""Carrie"" also. Which is sort of true, but May has no super powers. No pranks are conspired against her, and her wrath is directed mostly at very specific people for a specific purpose rather than it exploding all over everybody who was in her presence when she snapped. The comparison falls apart when you take that in consideration. Another reviewer who rated this film poorly said that he suspected that all the high reviews were by people who spent their adolescence going ""Woe is me."" There may be some truth to that, but it's probably also true that the negative reviews are from pretentious narcissists who like to tear people down to hide their own flaws. My point being is that they say that your perception is your reality. The viewer brings some unknown variables to any creative work. So only certain kinds of people will be able comprehend May's reality. Unless you have that certain something inside this will be entirely alien to you. Either you identify with May or the people she kills. In short, this is a movie about the misery that comes from the lack of social integration and the trials of trying to find love in a world that you don't fit in.

The acting in this cult-campy-wanna-be is very good which made me forgive some of the irritating flaws.  For a first attempt, I have to give Lucky McKee credit.  The potential was there but was never realized and instead, unraveled into an unintelligent thrasher.  The premise of the &quot;different&quot; girl (superbly portrayed by Angela Bettis - watch for her!)who had no friends  with the flashbacks of weirdo mother and the creepy doll incased in glass were reminscent of Carrie with a twist and a good start to an engaging story.  When we find May in the present day as an akward young adult finding her way, I was there.  I even forgave the idiotic daycare scene (symbolism of broken glass = something the director never fully explained in connection with breakage of doll's case but she meant something really deep I'm sure) They even had me when May first lost it and attempted to make a real version of her doll, a best friend who could never leave her except to decompose maybe.  But they lost me soon after that......the sudden cut to dismemberment was a stretch I wasn't able or willing to make.

Angela Bettis (Girl Interrupted, Carrie, Bless TheChild) certainly gives Maggie Gyllenhaal a run for her money in terms of best female performance ofthe year in a Lions Gate film. What a perfectly 'nailed' creepy yet vulnerable performance. JeremySisto (&quot;Peter&quot; from Six Feet Under) and Anna Faris keep this 'sure-to-be cult classic horror film'a whole level above the norm.Unlike American Psycho, this doesn't maintain the same consistent undertone of black humor, butmore than makes up for it by creating and nurturing a strong sympathy for &quot;May,&quot; ourpsychologically damaged, intriguing and beguiling, enigmatically appealing, murdering heroine.It is difficult for me to classify this movie yet I'm sure that most will refer to it as a horrorfilm (and I'll probably put it in the horror section of my store). But it was much more of a deeplyprofound drama that probes where few movies dare to tread. Make no mistake about it, there is a lotof explicit gore (strangely no nudity) for which Lions Gate is famous. Again, unlike AmericanPsycho, this doesn't only insinuate the graphic gore--it shows it. But with taste and dignity, ifthat's possible.The movie begins with May screaming in agonizing pain, holding her eye with blood gushing out (veryhaunting), and then cuts to May as a little girl. She was born with a condition called &quot;lazy eye.&quot;The psychological trauma began mounting as May was sent to school with a patch over her defectiveeye, only to be ridiculed and ostracized. In an attempt to compensate for May's loneliness, hermother gives her a special handmade doll that was hers when she was a child. It is kept in a woodenglass case and May is told that it must stay in that case, but it will be her friend and companionfor life.As May grows up, eye glasses and then contact lenses are able to correct her deformity whichreveals that May is really quite lovely. The question is, will May be able to acclimate intosociety so late in the game?May works as a veterinarian assistant (of course this gives her access to all kinds of scalpels andsurgical tools) and is very good at her job. But there is a quiet lonely aching that is beginningto manifest in May and she needs some companionship desperately. Unfortunately, she lacks any realsocial skills to properly interact in pursuit of her longing.May says to Adam (Sisto) while on their first date, &quot;You probably think I'm weird.&quot; Hereplies &quot;Yes, but I like weird.&quot; She is definitely weird.

Her massive eyepatch and emotionally distant mother kept her friendless, and now, as a young adult, she craves companionship. Unfortunately she's also got a few loose wires and, well, a lack of social skills that's almost matched by her lack of squeamishness.So when May meets and falls instantly in love with Jeremy Sisto, a local auto worker who has a goth-like attraction to disturbing images and horror movies. A couple of encounters make it pretty clear that her dark side trumps his, though, so he bails, leaving May open to the wiles of her lesbian co-worker. That doesn't quite work out either, so then...A lot of viewers might complain that the story is predictable. It is - the filmmakers aren't trying to shock you with twists.

This is evident in ""May"", which by and large is ""the little horror movie that could', but ends up with a couple of flaws that makes it ultimately disappointing.  Namely, (1) the lesbian subplot was too over-the-top and stood out poorly against the rest of the movie, and I wonder if it was stuck in there just to cater to the lesbian-fetish crowd; and (2) May's ""snap"" into a murderous fugue state was too sudden and implausible; she went from this insecure fragile waif to an invulnerable scaupel-wielding mistress in the blink of an eye.Still, the movie worth checking out, and if you're a horror fan who's less critical than me you'll probably love it.  The violence makes you cringe, the application of music (and lack thereof) is really fabulous, and the killings are nicely understated and anti-dramatic in such a way that makes genre-hugging horror films look ridiculous.  I'm really looking forward to Lucky McKee's next film, ""The Woods""; if he gets better with time, he'll be knocking our socks off.",3,"A great effort, but falls short",1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,1174,"['Director/screenwriter', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'clearly', 'long-time', 'fan', 'horror', 'movies', 'clearly', 'someone', 'who', 'make', 'horror', 'movies', 'challenge', 'genre', 'evident', 'May', 'large', 'little', 'horror', 'movie', 'could', ""'"", 'up', 'couple', 'flaws', 'ultimately', 'disappointing', 'Namely', '1', 'lesbian', 'subplot', 'was', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'stood', 'out', 'poorly', 'rest', 'movie', 'wonder', 'was', 'stuck', 'there', 'just', 'cater', 'lesbian-fetish', 'crowd', '2', 'May', 'snap', 'murderous', 'fugue', 'state', 'was', 'too', 'sudden', 'implausible', 'went', 'insecure', 'waif', 'invulnerable', 'scaupel-wielding', 'mistress', 'blink', 'eye.Still', 'movie', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'horror', 'fan', 'who', 'less', 'critical', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'violence', 'cringe', 'application', 'music', 'lack', 'thereof', 'really', 'fabulous', 'killings', 'are', 'nicely', 'understated', 'anti-dramatic', 'such', 'way', 'genre-hugging', 'horror', 'films', 'look', 'ridiculous', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'next', 'film', 'Woods', 'better', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'knocking', 'socks', 'off']",May

Angela Bettis is gripping in the title role:  May, a young woman who was burdened with a ""lazy eye"" while growing up and turned to a porcelain doll made by her mother for companionship.  She finds herself attracted to Jeremy Sisto (a good performance here), but mainly is fascinated with his hands.  Her co-worker and only real friend (Scary Movie's delightful Anna Faris) is at heart a lesbian who likes to dally with as many sallies as she can.  May works as a veterinarian assistant, and in her spare time, makes clothes and other sewing niceties.  We can see up front that May is missing a few screws and when her boyfriend jilts her and best friend Farris starts seeing other women, it's just too much for May and she goes on a gory killing binge to accommodate what her mother told her:  if you can't have any friends, make your own.  That tells you where the movie is headed.

754354,A36EMEZX84IKSB,B00009MEC4,Michael Greenwaldt,"[4, 6]","Whoa! I'm speechless! May is one weird, fun, funny, sad, and disturbing film. It's just so many things. It's a strangely beautiful character study about a lonely girl who just wants a friend. I couldn't help but feel for her. She's weird and shy, but in a cute, sweet way. I was intrigued by her, and wanted her to find happiness. No matter how pathetic her character would become, I just couldn't stop caring. I wanted to reach out to her, and be her friend. Nobody deserves to be so lonely. All she needed was a friend. But things just don't exactly work out that way. Once she began to crack and take the plunge into madness, it was understandable how it could happen. That doesn't mean that the events that unfolded weren't shocking, because they definitely were. But we see why our heroine does what she does. We can't help but want things to be different though, and for her to go down a different path, but when she doesn't, we come along for the ride anyway, following her wherever she takes us.Angela Bettis gives an amazing performance as May. So far this is the best female performance of the year, and when the end of the year comes, if it's still not THE best, it will be one of THE best. She makes us care about her character from the beginning, and we never really stop, even when she goes psychotic. Bettis shows so many emotions, and makes us feel all kinds of things. She was very natural, and sometimes her body language spoke to us more than her words. We just knew what she was feeling, and could feel her cracking more and more as the movie went on. She was sweet, sad, scary, pathetic, and yet strangely attractive. It's too bad the Academy are such prudes, because this girl is so deserving of an Oscar nomination that it's not even funny. Unfortunately, it's obvious her performance will be overlooked by them. May just isn't ""Oscar material."" Plus, the movie didn't make enough money and isn't well known enough for them to even consider honoring anything to do with ""May."" But even if they don't honor it, the fans will always remember it. I've seen Bettis in other movies, but after seeing this, I will always remember her as May... I've always been a fan of the underrated Anna Faris. She's a great comedic actress. I found her to be a lot of fun as Polly. She's funny and sexy. This is sure to be one of my favorite supporting performances of the year. Faris was a welcome addition to this twisted little film.Writer/Director Lucky McKee proves to be a great new talent. It's hard to believe this is his first feature film. Very impressive if you ask me. I'm looking forward to whatever he does next. If it's anything as wonderful as ""May,"" then it should be great... Also deserving of a mention is composer Jaye Barnes-Luckett. She does a terrific job here, always providing the right music at the right moment. If she keeps this up, she'll have a bright future ahead of her.I'm still blown away by this film. There's so many praises I have for it, that I doubt I could remember to mention them all. It's original, well acted, well written, well directed, etc... It's just twistedly wonderful. It's too bad it wasn't given a better release in theaters, but it's not exactly a mainstream movie either. It still deserved better than what it got. At least I can find comfort in knowing that it's sure to become a cult classic. Word of mouth will help it a lot. It's definitely not for everyone though. It's weird, morbid, quirky, wicked, and gutsy. It doesn't shy away from much. In fact, it has one of the best and most realistic slit throats I've ever witnessed on screen. But don't let that scare you, it's definitely worth a look for any horror fan, or any film fan in general. I'm proud to have this haunting film as a part of my collection.

754355,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00009MEC4,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[54, 59]","May is a peculiar sort of movie, part social commentary, part slasher flick.  It manages to succeed admirably at both, despite the fact that it's central star is a cute little misfit named May.May Dove Canady (Angela Bettis) is a sheltered misfit.  Born with a lazy eye, she grows up wearing a pirate-like eye patch, only to be teased by children her entire life.  Her mother (Merle Kennedy) drives the point home: if you can't find a friend, make one.  And May's mother does just that, crafting a doll for her daughter with big, spooky eyes. The catch is that the doll can never be let out of her box.And thus we have an allegory for May.  May tentatively explores her world through her job as a veterinarian's assistant and her interactions with her coworkers, the barely-understandable veterinarian (Ken Davitian) and the oversexed lesbian coworker Polly (Anna Faris).  Then May bumps into Adam Stubbs (Jeremy Sisto), a horror movie fan and budding auteur that specializes in gore.Adam's first film is titled ""Jack and Jill,"" which starts out sweet: two lovers seem to want to devour each other...and then literally do so, biting and gnawing on each other's limbs in an orgiastic frenzy.  The movie deeply affects May, who is fascinated with Adam's hands. When May shift gears from foreplay to kink by biting Adam's lip, he dumps her.All throughout the movie, May tries to connect with people.  She struggles with her relationship with Polly, who uses and abuses her.  Polly asks May to adopt her pet cat, a seemingly genuine gesture of friendship, only to discover that Polly never wanted the responsibility in the first place.  May also joins a school for teaching blind children.  When May brings her doll to class, the children are intrigued and frustrated: to a blind child, a glass box may as well be an iron vault.  They plead for her to release what's in the glass box, with tragic consequences for the doll.Bereft of her only friend and infuriated by her inability to connect with the rest of humanity, May decides to make her own friend out of the components of everyone else. Then the killing begins...All this could be very mundane.  But May is so much more. Warning: There are lots of spoilers below!MAY AS DOLL: Polly calls May ""doll,"" and May is very much a pure, untouched creature with wide, staring eyes just like her doll.  Locked in her own glass box, May is always viewing the world from a distance.  She even kisses like her dolls, smashing them together with brutal force without any coordination. When the glass on her doll's box shatters, so too does May's universe.  Always watching, always a bystander, and never really touching or feeling anything...May is a walking faade, an entity pretending to be a person.MAY AS SERIAL KILLER: May exhibits all the traits of an organized serial killer; she gets up every day and goes to work, has her own hobbies, and reads a lot.  But May is completely disassociated from reality.  She was most certainly abused.  When May screams at her doll to ""face the *** wall"" we know it's her mother's voice. She views people as their components parts, alternately admiring and lusting for them.  May starts by killing animals, and then escalates her rage until it transforms into murder. Frustrated, she finally releases her revenge by killing those she admires and keeping the trophies afterwards.MAY AS GOLEM: The monster (named Amy) created from the parts of May's killing spree is animated only when she provides something of herself.  But Amy's creation is telling: she arranges the three letters of her name ""M-A-Y"" into ""A-M-Y.""  This is consistent with the creation of the medieval rabbis creating golems by writing the word ""emet"" (truth in Hebrew) on the golem's forehead to animate it.  By erasing the first letter, ""emet"" becomes ""meit"" (dead), thus deactivating the golem.  May can be seen as the inverse, finally living only through death, and slowly dying in her own life. Just as Amy is made from Adam's hands, God created Adam from clay--rabbis create their golems in the same fashion.MAY AS MARY: May's just one ""r"" away from the virgin Mary of Christianity.  May freely admits she's still a virgin.  At the end of the movie, May gives ""birth"" to a creation, sacrificing herself so that her child may live. Most telling, the cover of the DVD portrays May with a Mary-like halo.  Closer examination reveals that the halo consists of scissors and scalpels.MAY AS OUTCAST: For those of us who had an awkward childhood, we've all had our share of being teased.  Being called a freak can be hurtful.  But more interesting is May's relationship with those who fancy themselves on the fringe; both Polly and Adam say they ""like weird,"" but they really don't.  They like to be thought of as weird, but they're not really unique at all.  Adam and Polly are very much mundane, ultimately embodying what they supposedly are not: stereotypes.  Even Blank (played by James Duval, he of Donnie Darko), who has the weirdest hair-do in the movie, treats May like a total freak.  Ultimately, everyone from the blind children she teaches to her pet cat reject May.MAY AS VOYEUR: May has gone through much of her childhood with one eye.  When she finally does get full use of both eyes, she watches everything with incredible intensity.  Her fascination with blind children makes her feel comfortable.  They can't look at her and judge her, but she can safely judge them.  Similarly, May is able to stalk Adam from a distance, watching him for hours at a restaurant. In the end, May sacrifices her eye so that she can watch, in her death, life being born through Amy.MAY AS POSSIBILITY: The term ""may"" can express a measure of likelihood, possibility, desire, or fervent wish.  May is very much a wistful creature, hopeful about the possibilities of having a boyfriend and of relationships that take fruit only in her imagination. It is the shattering of all those possibilities that makes May's fall so heartbreaking.  She's cute.  She's innocent.  She's a little strange, but aren't we all?May is one of those rare brand of movies that is both horror and drama, parable and slasher flick.  Director Lucky McKee comments that ""there's a lot of raw, personal stuff here"" and it shows, in bloody, angry, pathetic, beautiful detail, from the spring-loaded fake blade that Adam plays with to the aching loneliness of a blind child in the park.  McKee's masterpiece, like Donnie Darko, may well define its own genre.For anyone who has ever been called a freak, for anyone who has ever been teased because of how they look, and for anyone who has ever become so exasperated with humanity that they despair there's no good left in the world...this movie's for you.",5,A quirky masterpiece that creates its own genre,1153785600,"07 25,

754356,A35K06H07L5POJ,B00009MEC4,"Miss Gigi ""Detroit Weekly Chronicle""","[5, 8]","Viewers may recognize actress Angela Bettis in films such as ""Bless the Child,"" ""Carrie,"" and ""The Flamingo Rising."" She naturally plays the introverted shy mouse, but in ""May,"" the geek in her snaps.May has a problem. Every time she begins to take interest in someone, the more flaws she sees in them. Only choice parts strike her fancy, and after the loss of the one man she loves, this little doll's out for a new kind of friend-making.With only the now broken doll her mother gave her as a companion, May begins ""picking up the pieces"" to making the perfect friend.Bettis' role is strong, as is Farris' (you may recognize her as Cindy from the ""Scary Movies""). The true role to study though (below Angie's of course) is Jeremy Sisto's character as the man--or should I say HANDS--of May's dreams.Newcomer director Lucky McKee proves a master in his spring, and the deluxe commentary on the DVD proves this both humorously and insightfully. (*Note, the amateur sadomasochism short film Adam shows May in his home is actually an effort Dir. Lucky McKee made as film student in college.)This film has been compared to the likes of Brian DePalma's ""Carrie,"" by numerous scornful critics, as well it should. ""Carrie"" is, however my first favorite movie, THEN May. McKee put together a brilliant cast at Lion's Gate Pro., and the finale, in which May's ""friend"" is complete, will either make you puke, or bring you to tears--personally I found it touching.Lastly, for all you hard-core film scrutinizers out there, the largest and most talked about aspect of the film--at least in the commentary--is the cinematography and music. The killer slow and sometimes hard rock soudtrack links with the action quite well, and McKee's camerawork is pure genius, especcially suprising coming from a just post-college student.Saw it, Loved it--can't pass this gore-fest up--bought it,-GIGI",5,"Peice by peice, MAY is a Cult Classic",1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,1876,"['Viewers', 'may', 'recognize', 'actress', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'films', 'such', 'Child', 'Carrie', 'Flamingo', 'Rising', 'naturally', 'introverted', 'shy', 'mouse', 'May', 'geek', 'snaps.May', 'problem', 'time', 'take', 'interest', 'someone', 'more', 'flaws', 'Only', 'choice', 'parts', 'strike', 'fancy', 'loss', 'one', 'man', 'little', 'doll', 'out', 'new', 'kind', 'friend-making.With', 'only', 'now', 'broken', 'doll', 'mother', 'gave', 'companion', 'May', 'picking', 'up', 'pieces', 'making', 'perfect', 'friend.Bettis', 'role', 'strong', 'Farris', 'may', 'recognize', 'Cindy', 'Scary', 'Movies', 'true', 'role', 'study', 'Angie', 'course', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'character', 'man', 'should', 'say', 'HANDS', 'May', 'dreams.Newcomer', 'director', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'master', 'spring', 'deluxe', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'humorously', 'insightfully', '*Note', 'amateur', 'sadomasochism', 'short', 'film', 'Adam', 'shows', 'May', 'home', 'actually', 'effort', 'Dir', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'made', 'film', 'student', 'college', 'film', 'been', 'compared', 'likes', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'Carrie', 'numerous', 'scornful', 'critics', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'Carrie', 'however', 'first', 'favorite', 'movie', 'THEN', 'May', 'McKee', 'put', 'together', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'Pro.', 'finale', 'May', 'friend', 'complete', 'will', 'either', 'make', 'puke', 'bring', 'tears', 'personally', 'found', 'touching.Lastly', 'hard-core', 'film', 'scrutinizers', 'there', 'largest', 'most', 'talked', 'aspect', 'film', 'least', 'commentary', 'cinematography', 'music', 'killer', 'slow', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'rock', 'soudtrack', 'action', 'quite', 'well', 'McKee', 'camerawork', 'pure', 'genius', 'especcially', 'suprising', 'coming', 'just', 'post-college', 'student.Saw', 'Loved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'gore-fest', 'up', 'bought', '-GIGI']",May

Quite sad and at the same time heartfelt message that many people can identify with, no perfect person exists!Angela Bettis (with films like Girl Interrupted, Bless That Child and Perfume to her name)gives the performance of her career, one that should really be acknowledged by awards! She plays May to perfection, and is responsible for injecting the sympathy that her character deserves.Anna Faris, as I mentioned is very sexy, and more so since she plays a vampish lesbian, and has a surprisingly erotically charged scene with Bettis.May is a litle gem of a movie that I strongly advise you to watch, for it will take you back to a time when movies did not need to have dozens of  accountants and lawyers and two mega stars that will eat half the budget for it to hit the right spot with the viewers.",5,Wonderfully Weird Cult Classic,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,3246,"['Thank', 'God', 'DVD', 'many', 'good', 'little', 'films', 'who', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'wide', 'theatre', 'distrubution', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'premature', 'unfortunate', 'demise.The', 'digital', 'technology', 'huge', 'boom', 'DVD', 'sales', 'pushed', 'studios', 'look', 'deep', 'treasure', 'vaults', 'release', 'unknown', 'gems', 'May', 'such', 'movie.Lucky', 'McKee', 'film', 'original', 'weird', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'thin', 'line', 'originality', 'weirdness', 'wonderful', 'watch', '70s', 'cult-ish', 'feel', 'it.May', 'can', 'be', 'thinly', 'labelled', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'psychological', 'study', 'mind', ""'social"", 'outcast', 'lonely', 'soul', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'confidant', 'life', 'creepy', 'looking', 'doll.In', 'way', 'May', 'did', 'remind', 'slightly', 'George', 'A', 'Romero', 'Martin', 'apart', 'characters', 'particular', 'taste', 'blood', 'are', 'eccentric', 'loners', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'properly', ""'normal"", 'world', 'one', 'have', 'carefully', 'cocooned', 'horrors', 'inflict', 'others', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'total', 'sympathy', 'deep', 'are', 'quite', 'vulnerable', 'naive', 'exploited', 'people.May', 'over', 'protected', 'child', 'parents', 'shunned', 'other', 'kids', 'lazy', 'eye', 'had', 'wear', ""'pirate"", 'patch', 'very', 'timid', 'inexperienced', 'woman', 'fascination', 'certain', 'body', 'parts', 'hands', 'excellent', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'neck', 'pet', 'clinic', 'lesbian', 'colleague', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'Anna', 'Faris.But', 'what', 'May', 'really', 'anything', 'else', 'intimacy', 'closeness', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'accept', 'warning', 'potential', 'suitors', 'weird', '..and', 'lack', 'experience', 'fragile', 'emotional', 'state', 'twisted', 'outlook', 'world', 'inbred', 'years', 'isolation', 'not', 'take', 'disappointments', 'rejections', 'too', 'well', 'murderous', 'consequences.Yet', 'care', 'blind', 'children', 'aspect', 'May', 'personality', 'one', 'so', 'detached', 'beast', 'confirmation', 'indeed', 'care', 'love', 'most', 'give', 'return', 'ones', 'are', 'vulnerable', 'need', 'affection', 'herself.The', 'ending', 'quite', 'powerful', 'attempting', ""'construct"", 'perfect', 'companion', 'different', 'parts', 'people', 'liked', 'only', 'lead', 'greater', 'disappointment', 'pain', 'Quite', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'heartfelt', 'message', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'identify', 'perfect', 'person', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'films', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'Bless', 'That', 'Child', 'Perfume', 'name', 'performance', 'career', 'one', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'awards', 'May', 'perfection', 'responsible', 'injecting', 'sympathy', 'character', 'deserves.Anna', 'Faris', 'mentioned', 'very', 'sexy', 'more', 'so', 'vampish', 'lesbian', 'surprisingly', 'erotically', 'charged', 'scene', 'Bettis.May', 'litle', 'gem', 'movie', 'strongly', 'advise', 'watch', 'will', 'take', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'have', 'dozens', 'accountants', 'lawyers', 'two', 'mega', 'stars', 'will', 'eat', 'budget', 'hit', 'right', 'spot', 'viewers']",May
754359,A3V2THQU2RQ1AG,B00009MEC4,Molly C.,"[4, 4]","A lonely girl named May leads an isolated existence with no companionship other than her encased doll, until one day she meets the perfect guy. Slowly she comes out of her shell as her doll's case cracks more and more. After getting rebuffed by her man and a woman and even a cat (!), she begins her mental descent into madness culminating in the final scene where she finally gets what she always wanted.May is an updated version of Frankenstein with the girl mistaken for a pirate (monster) for wearing a corrective eye patch. There are themes of isolation, loneliness, and insanity. May speaks of liking people, most of them anyway, and disliking certain parts. May is the perfect embodiment of the awkward girl struggling for attention. I believe only Bettis could have pulled off this difficult role. She is both vulnerable, yet powerful at the same time.The supporting cast is great particularly Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-5) who plays the mighty flirtatious lesbian co-worker Polly. And while that description sounds cheesy, her character is anything but. She steals almost every scene she is in and I am completely smitten with her. She holds her cat and sulks across the screen purring like a pussy herself. Jeremy Sisto plays the cute, but aloof Adam whose room is covered in Dario Argento's Opera posters. He shows his character drawn to May's quirkiness, yet repulsed by her natural desires.I think in different hands with different actors, the film would have failed miserably. But each actor made his or her character someone unique. This film also works as a shining example of McKee's great storytelling skills. Haunting moments include dead cat play, bloodied eyeballs, blind kids crawling over glass, scissor stabbings, and a very creepy doll.Released in 2002 by Lions Gate, the movie clocks in at 93 minutes. There is apparently missing footage from the movie such as multiple scenes of young May featuring the ""Bird Wing Chopping"" scene where May tries to make her doll fly. Hopefully, this will get re-released at a later time with the extra scenes.DVD Extras: Hidden Trailers and some interesting Commentary. The German release has production notes and Biographies, while Australia provided a 14 still Photo Gallery.Favorite Quote: Polly, ""The Doctor needs you to do a Fee-Ko Zam on the Miss Ka-Tay.

754364,A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R,B00009MEC4,Movie Fan,"[2, 4]","Until you betray her that is. I always wanted to see this film, i saw previews and it looked interesting, since this was the girl who played a mental patient suffering from BDD in GIRL INTERRUPTED, and jeremy sisto is also a good actor and has been in many well known films such as clueless, and hideaway, and thirteen. This movie is extremely disturbing but does not fail as a successful horror film,  despite some parts which were amusing in a sick way. It really showed angela bettis's talent because she really played the part well, her facial expressions, and smiles at inappropriate times, and her naive personality doesn't come off as innocent, but rather shows how obsessive she is and how disturbed she keeps on getting. This was also a psychological horror, because if you know psychology, you'd know that the doll was like a metaphor. It was a symbol of her ""other side"" waiting to break out. (cracking of the doll box glass) And at the end, when she's screaming SEE ME SEE ME, she obviously felt ignored by people, and felt like an outsider, so see me, was her way of saying she was sick of being invisible. It reminded me of jeff dahmer, in which he too played around with body parts and was interested in dark things like satanic rituals, and weird books like in this film may read about amputations and mutialation ""for fun"". And this movie also had a new idea, the murderer turned out to be female, which is a rare thing.

754367,AIB3L0ESOWUV8,B00009MEC4,Norbert Evans,"[2, 4]","I tried to write my thoughts about this movie but can't keep in under 1600 words and I could only write a max of 1,000, oh well. I'll keep this short.  I first seen Angela Bettis in the TV movie remake of ""Carrie.""  I thought the story was good and I was very impressed with the lead player Angela Bettis.  I short while later I looked her up at the IMDB.  I had read about ""MAY"" and liked the fact ""Ebert"" had given the movie 4 stars, his highest rating.  This was unusual for him to give such high praise to any horror movie or like genre.  I ordered ""MAY"" on DVD having never seen it.  I had high expectations and was not disappointed.  Angela Bettis is not only very talented with her many fantastic subtle facial expressions of her characters (rarely seen in the best actors of all time) but she is just a great actress in general.  Sad that she has not been recognized and given her due credit but then I like it that she is not mainstream, makes her more special.  Angela has a very unique beauty and she is without a doubt one of the most beautiful women acting today.  The movie MAY as it turns out has one thing in common with the ""Carrie"" remake and also the movie ""Sparrow"" (Avail. DVD-private dealers-ebay) with Angela as the main character ""Maria"" from 1993 when Angela was about 17 or 18 years old, she's now 29.  The character in all three of these movies were more or less loners looking for LOVE wherever it may find them.  All three movies end with a very sad ending for her character at that time and of course we don't see the rest of her life.  I have watched ""MAY"" several times and have the soundtrack (bought from a private party-Luckett) and both are excellent.  The Breeders, Kelly Deal 6000 & others as well as the music score by Luckett and her ATE13 music really set the mood.  Angela's singing in one of the versions of FROX was very cool as well.  I very much liked Anna Faris and her and Angela's scenes together are a real treat.  The best line with them was when Polly (Anna Faris) ask May (Bettis) ""Do you like pussy"" and the followup to that scene, it's quite sexy and provocative.  I believe Angela Bettis will get her long overdue credit.  I liked the doll ""Soozy"" in this movie, the whispering noises and the cracking glass sounds all added to the atmosphere.  This is a ""cut em up"" movie done in a stylish black comedy setting.  All the other characters are well portrayed and the movie as a whole was very well done. I encourage anyone who likes unique movies like ""Harold & Maude"" or that fit into dark\black horror comedy will enjoy this movie.  This movie is not for everyone but it was 100% for me.  I will watch for other movies by Lucky McKee and most of all I will watch for movies with Angela Bettis of which I find intoxicating.  Where is the ""Toolbox Murders"" movie with Angela, can't find it anywhere?",5,I ove this movie - I love Bettis,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,2854,"['tried', 'write', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', '1600', 'words', 'could', 'only', 'write', 'max', '1,000', 'oh', 'well', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'short', 'first', 'seen', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'TV', 'movie', 'remake', 'Carrie', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'lead', 'player', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'short', 'later', 'looked', 'up', 'IMDB', 'had', 'read', 'MAY', 'liked', 'fact', 'Ebert', 'had', 'given', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'highest', 'rating', 'was', 'unusual', 'give', 'such', 'high', 'praise', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'ordered', 'MAY', 'DVD', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'talented', 'many', 'fantastic', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expressions', 'characters', 'rarely', 'seen', 'best', 'actors', 'time', 'just', 'great', 'actress', 'general', 'Sad', 'not', 'been', 'recognized', 'given', 'due', 'credit', 'then', 'like', 'not', 'mainstream', 'more', 'special', 'Angela', 'very', 'unique', 'beauty', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'acting', 'today', 'movie', 'MAY', 'out', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'Carrie', 'remake', 'also', 'movie', 'Sparrow', 'Avail', 'DVD-private', 'dealers-ebay', 'Angela', 'main', 'character', 'Maria', '1993', 'when', 'Angela', 'was', '17', '18', 'years', 'old', 'now', '29', 'character', 'three', 'movies', 'were', 'more', 'less', 'loners', 'looking', 'LOVE', 'wherever', 'may', 'find', 'three', 'movies', 'end', 'very', 'sad', 'ending', 'character', 'time', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'rest', 'life', 'have', 'watched', 'MAY', 'several', 'times', 'have', 'soundtrack', 'bought', 'private', 'party-Luckett', 'are', 'excellent', 'Breeders', 'Kelly', 'Deal', '6000', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'score', 'Luckett', 'ATE13', 'music', 'really', 'set', 'mood', 'Angela', 'singing', 'one', 'versions', 'FROX', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Angela', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'best', 'line', 'was', 'when', 'Polly', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'ask', 'May', 'Bettis', 'Do', 'pussy', 'followup', 'scene', 'quite', 'sexy', 'provocative', 'believe', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'will', 'get', 'long', 'overdue', 'credit', 'liked', 'doll', 'Soozy', 'movie', 'whispering', 'noises', 'cracking', 'glass', 'added', 'atmosphere', 'cut', 'up', 'movie', 'done', 'stylish', 'black', 'comedy', 'setting', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'whole', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'unique', 'movies', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'fit', 'dark\\black', 'horror', 'comedy', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'was', '100', '%', 'will', 'watch', 'other', 'movies', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'most', 'will', 'watch', 'movies', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'find', 'intoxicating', 'Where', 'Toolbox', 'Murders', 'movie', 'Angela', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anywhere']",May

754369,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00009MEC4,Only-A-Child,"[3, 4]","""May"" is one of those happy accidents where decent premise,  lazy pre-production, low budget, and erratic editing inexplicably combine to make a terrific film. Inexplicable is not entirely right. Although Writer/ Director Lucky McKee did live up to his name and get very ""lucky"" on this one, he also had the sense to cast Angela Bettis (Janet Webber in ""Girl Interrupted"") as his title character and the directorial wisdom to rein in her performance to an understated level that supports the black comedy spirit of his film.The story is seen through the point of view of Bettis's May, a character with the social skills of Travis ""you talking to me"" Bickle (""Taxi Driver"") and the emotional stability of ""Repulsion's"" Carol. Bettis is one of those amazing actresses whose face is an expressive kaleidoscope. Film is usually shot at the rate of 24 frames per second and every frame would be needed to record the series of emotions Bettis could register on her face during each second. McKee recognizes this and keeps her in check, but enough leaks out for the viewer to sense that there is a coiled spring beneath the relatively placid surface. This is a lot like the effect Elizabeth Hartman had in her films and the connection is strikingly amplified by a close physical resemblance between Bettis and Hartman.May is beautiful, fragile, and vulnerable; although wrapped as tight as Carol in ""Repulsion"" she elicits much more audience sympathy and protectiveness. McKee and co-star Jeremy Sisto wisely just let Bettis run with the ball and Sisto's Adam Stubbs stays a one-dimensional nice guy romantic interest.The film can be roughly divided into two halves. The first half is a black romantic comedy with genuinely touching details as May finally gets contact lenses but is unsuccessful in several planned attempts to meet Adam; then ironically they meet by complete accident. The second half is a psychological thriller with both horror elements and black comedy. The surprising unity and balance between the two halves is where McKee really got lucky as the black comedy of the second half is actually facilitated by the low budget. Had the money been available to realistically stage the violence (and had McKee given in to the temptation to do so) it would have destroyed the unifying black comedy and compromised the film. This is critical because May's second half mental breakdown is accompanied by a physical transformation that would otherwise have disconnected the two halves.Anna Faris (playing May's lesbian co-worker) also deserves praise for a great performance. Faris was unexpectedly good in ""The Hot Chick"" and she follows that up here with an inspired comic performance. Her delivery is far more funny than her actual lines.Ultimately Bettis gives us a character you find believable, sympathetic, and terrifying. What makes her performance absolutely unique and special is that she does this while also providing multiple moments of humorous self-parody.Then again, what do I know?

Then I saw it, and was left utterly cold. The only difference between Ghost World and Clueless was that Alicia Silverstone has gotten too old to play Thora Birch's role.So then I saw May, and realized that everyone had just seen both movies on the same day and misattributed all the accolades. May is intelligent, funny, and sharp as a scupel-err, scalpel.Angela Bettis (Girl, Interrupted), who does the most remarkable impression of those Edward Gorey-drawn Victorian little pre-goth girls, stars in the title role. May is a lifelong misfit who fits in nowhere. After (we presume) the death of her parents, May is left on her own in the house in which she grew up, with a job at the local animal hospital, no life, and a best friend who's a really disturbing porcelain doll who May has never taken out of the case constructed for her long before May's birth. Then, through the magic of cinema, we are transported to the realm of Britcom `Allo! `Allo!-this somewhat plain, reclusive girl catches the eye of two Hollywood-gorgeous types, Adan (Jeremy ""Julius Caesar"" Sisto-who really does appear as Caesar, albeit in a Halloween costume, in this film) and Polly (Anna Faris of the Scary Movie franchise). May's naivete causes her to make a few bad choices in the courtship game, a few bad choices are made by others, and the stage is set for the film to become the tragedy (though always leavened with humor) it threatens to become from the first moments.Despite being what it is (and by now it's not a spoiler to say it's a modern retelling of Frankenstein, since everyone else has mentioned it by now), the movie has some of the funniest one-liners to see the big screen in the past two or three decades.

My DVD player has a mind of its own, and will, at times, want to play a movie before you're damned good and ready. ; as was the case here. Another warning, do not, as said above, and have, as I did, a 2 year old in the room. Now, I'm not saying that he's traumatized for life. However, the opening of the movie should give you a bit of taste of things to come. Fortunately, I waited until well after my son's bedtime to watch the film.At times movies arrive in the mail via NetFlix and I forget why I rented them. As was the case with MAY. Nevertheless, after watching the movie I was not sorry for it.I consider the inspiration to seek out and watch the film was probably a review I read and don't remember reading in Fangoria magazine.Other movies have attempted to show a person descend into madness. It starts when you're very young and you digress. May was a child with a lazy eye that was coddled by her mother and treated as an outsider, so when we see her years later, she's a beautiful young woman, with a stigmatism that will make one think she's looking at you and someone across the road, much like a chameleon. Yet, May's had a friend her entire life to be with her on her downward spiral. The ""creepy"" doll her mother gave to her, ""but not to touch,"" that dwells within a glass box and sees the world through unblinking eyes and while May pines over the doll, she's continuously in search for someone to share a life with. That life she finds in obsession in ""parts."" The song that comes to mind is by Hole, `Doll Parts,' and once you begin seeing the unraveling of the film, you'll understand. A seamstress and veterinary assistant, May is truly one of a kind and is quirky and charming in a ""Carrie"" kind of way. Moreover, by unraveling, it doesn't just mean the film, but the person we're living through.Lucky McKee is the director and writer of the film and if there's one thing to say about writer/directors, they know what they want you to see when it comes to writing the piece. As a writer myself, I know what goes through my head in setting up scenes. When it comes to writer/directors, they capture the intensity of the scene exactly as it was put to paper. Although the directing was satisfactory, what brought the film out was the acting by Angela Bettis, as May and the character actors that surrounded her. Some faces may seem familiar to people that recognize actors for their body of work and not the pay they bring home.I had no idea the movie would turn in the direction it did and at the end, you completely understand her pain from the beginning. Troubled? Yes. Dangerous? Absolutely! I think I would find `May' an irresistible girl if I met her on the street or laundry mat as the case may be, and fall in love. However, it would be foolish, costly, and still, I'd understand as I was wheeled down the sidewalk, looking at the dark inside of an ice chest that this girl was special.For those who watch a movie for stories this is for you. Those of you that have a ten-minute attentions span-what was I saying? This is not for you! Dark, sometimes touching and funny, those of us that truly get inspiration when it comes to good films, this is for you.Not for the weak minded, or weak stomach.",5,Doll Parts...,1067990400,"11 5, 2003",2003,3319,"['OK', 'warning', 'do', 'not', 'did', 'put', 'movie', 'DVD', 'player', 'walk', 'room', 'DVD', 'player', 'mind', 'own', 'will', 'times', 'want', 'play', 'movie', ""'re"", 'damned', 'good', 'ready', 'was', 'case', 'here', 'warning', 'do', 'not', 'said', 'have', 'did', '2', 'year', 'old', 'room', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'traumatized', 'life', 'However', 'opening', 'movie', 'should', 'give', 'bit', 'taste', 'things', 'come', 'Fortunately', 'waited', 'well', 'son', 'bedtime', 'watch', 'film.At', 'times', 'movies', 'arrive', 'mail', 'NetFlix', 'forget', 'why', 'rented', 'was', 'case', 'MAY', 'Nevertheless', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'sorry', 'it.I', 'consider', 'inspiration', 'seek', 'out', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'review', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'reading', 'Fangoria', 'magazine.Other', 'movies', 'have', 'attempted', 'show', 'person', 'descend', 'madness', 'when', ""'re"", 'very', 'young', 'digress', 'May', 'was', 'child', 'lazy', 'eye', 'was', 'coddled', 'mother', 'treated', 'outsider', 'so', 'when', 'see', 'years', 'later', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'stigmatism', 'will', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'looking', 'someone', 'road', 'much', 'chameleon', 'May', 'had', 'friend', 'entire', 'life', 'be', 'downward', 'spiral', 'creepy', 'doll', 'mother', 'gave', 'not', 'touch', 'glass', 'box', 'world', 'unblinking', 'eyes', 'while', 'May', 'doll', 'continuously', 'search', 'someone', 'share', 'life', 'life', 'obsession', 'parts', 'song', 'mind', 'Hole', 'Doll', 'Parts', 'once', 'begin', 'seeing', 'unraveling', 'film', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'seamstress', 'veterinary', 'assistant', 'May', 'truly', 'one', 'kind', 'quirky', 'charming', 'Carrie', 'kind', 'way', 'Moreover', 'unraveling', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'film', 'person', ""'re"", 'living', 'through.Lucky', 'McKee', 'director', 'writer', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'say', 'writer/directors', 'know', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'when', 'writing', 'piece', 'writer', 'know', 'what', 'head', 'setting', 'up', 'scenes', 'When', 'writer/directors', 'capture', 'intensity', 'scene', 'exactly', 'was', 'put', 'paper', 'directing', 'was', 'satisfactory', 'what', 'brought', 'film', 'out', 'was', 'acting', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'May', 'character', 'actors', 'surrounded', 'may', 'seem', 'familiar', 'people', 'recognize', 'actors', 'body', 'work', 'not', 'pay', 'bring', 'home.I', 'had', 'idea', 'movie', 'would', 'turn', 'direction', 'did', 'end', 'completely', 'understand', 'pain', 'beginning', 'Troubled', 'Yes', 'Dangerous', 'Absolutely', 'think', 'would', 'find', 'May', 'irresistible', 'girl', 'met', 'street', 'laundry', 'mat', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'fall', 'love', 'However', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'costly', 'still', ""'d"", 'understand', 'was', 'wheeled', 'down', 'sidewalk', 'looking', 'dark', 'inside', 'ice', 'chest', 'girl', 'was', 'special.For', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'stories', 'have', 'ten-minute', 'attentions', 'span-what', 'was', 'saying', 'not', 'Dark', 'sometimes', 'touching', 'funny', 'truly', 'get', 'inspiration', 'when', 'good', 'films', 'you.Not', 'weak', 'minded', 'weak', 'stomach']",May
754379,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00009MEC4,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""May"" is ""Carrie"" minus the telekinesis and the crazy, domineering mother.  Actually, the latter has been replaced by an eerie doll that the mentally deranged heroine believes controls her thoughts and actions.In his debut as both writer and director, Lucky McKee delivers a creepy, relatively understated tale of madness and murder.  Unlike many horror film directors, McKee allows the terror to build slowly, putting the audience in a state of expectant unease from the very start.  May is a severely psychologically disturbed young woman whose ""weirdness"" first attracts people, then repels them when they realize that that weirdness is far more real and far more deadly than anything they'd ever bargained for.  McKee has some fun with the notion that many people - i.e. the dabblers in the grotesque and the macabre, in other words, fans of films like this - may THINK they know what they like, but, like the rest of us, they run at the first sign of any real trouble.The biggest weakness of ""May"" is that it often defies credibility.  Although Angela Bettis is terrific in the title role, May herself is so full of twitches and tics that one is amazed that she hasn't been institutionalized long before this, let alone that she is allowed to work with injured animals and blind children.  Similarly, her lesbian coworker, who sucks her thumb and practically drools at the slightest hint of anything bizarre, gives May a run for her money in the psycho-in-the-making sweepstakes.  Moreover, there's a receptionist at a day school for handicapped children who wouldn't last two seconds on the job in the real world.Despite these few flaws, ""May"" does succeed as an unnerving exercise in twisted morbidity - at least up to a point.  That point is passed when the movie, in its final stages, turns into a bizarrely bloody variant on the ""Frankenstein"" theme, with dismembered body parts strewn from one end of the screen to the other.  That's when all but the most strong-stomached and seasoned horror film aficionados will have likely tuned the movie out.In addition to Bettis, Jeremy Sisto and Anna Faris turn in excellent performances as the hapless ""friends"" and ultimate victims of this insane young woman.  ""May"" reveals these three fine performers and McKee as talents well worth keeping (as opposed to poking) an eye out for.",3,"creepy, bloody thriller",1060992000,"08 16, 2003",2003,2335,"['May', 'Carrie', 'telekinesis', 'crazy', 'domineering', 'mother', 'Actually', 'latter', 'been', 'replaced', 'eerie', 'doll', 'mentally', 'deranged', 'heroine', 'thoughts', 'actions.In', 'debut', 'writer', 'director', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'creepy', 'relatively', 'understated', 'tale', 'madness', 'murder', 'many', 'horror', 'film', 'directors', 'McKee', 'terror', 'build', 'slowly', 'putting', 'audience', 'state', 'expectant', 'unease', 'very', 'start', 'May', 'severely', 'psychologically', 'disturbed', 'young', 'woman', 'weirdness', 'first', 'people', 'then', 'repels', 'when', 'realize', 'weirdness', 'far', 'more', 'real', 'far', 'more', 'deadly', 'anything', ""'d"", 'ever', 'bargained', 'McKee', 'fun', 'notion', 'many', 'people', 'i.e', 'dabblers', 'grotesque', 'macabre', 'other', 'words', 'fans', 'films', 'may', 'THINK', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'rest', 'run', 'first', 'sign', 'real', 'trouble.The', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'May', 'often', 'credibility', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'terrific', 'title', 'role', 'May', 'so', 'full', 'twitches', 'tics', 'one', 'amazed', ""n't"", 'been', 'institutionalized', 'long', 'let', 'alone', 'allowed', 'work', 'injured', 'animals', 'blind', 'children', 'Similarly', 'lesbian', 'coworker', 'who', 'thumb', 'practically', 'drools', 'slightest', 'hint', 'anything', 'bizarre', 'May', 'run', 'money', 'psycho-in-the-making', 'sweepstakes', 'Moreover', 'receptionist', 'day', 'school', 'handicapped', 'children', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'last', 'two', 'seconds', 'job', 'real', 'world.Despite', 'few', 'flaws', 'May', 'succeed', 'unnerving', 'exercise', 'twisted', 'morbidity', 'least', 'up', 'point', 'point', 'passed', 'when', 'movie', 'final', 'stages', 'bizarrely', 'bloody', 'variant', 'Frankenstein', 'theme', 'dismembered', 'body', 'parts', 'strewn', 'one', 'end', 'screen', 'other', 'when', 'most', 'strong-stomached', 'seasoned', 'horror', 'film', 'aficionados', 'will', 'have', 'likely', 'tuned', 'movie', 'out.In', 'addition', 'Bettis', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'turn', 'excellent', 'performances', 'hapless', 'friends', 'ultimate', 'victims', 'insane', 'young', 'woman', 'May', 'three', 'fine', 'performers', 'McKee', 'talents', 'well', 'keeping', 'opposed', 'poking', 'eye', 'out']",May

Its about an awkward young lady named May (Angela Bettis) that has never had a friend or lover in her life due in part because of a lazy eye problem. Everyone knows what an ordeal she must of went through growing up and with little help from her oddball mother. Thats her life in a nut shell and this story is about her trying to make and keep friends and a boyfriend. The story follows her increadibly awkward journey as she attemps to make friends and the bizarre methods she uses to connect with people. She uses the same strange approach to meet her dream guy Adam (Jeremy Sisto). Well I think that you have a good idea what happens with her relationships because of her behavior and her methods. Part of her many mental issues is that she is looking for the perfect person that in the end leads her down a very dark path. The acting by Bettis was very good, but Sisto looked a little out of place in this role. This is a movie that's hard for me to review because of its content. I had to stop and start this movie three or four times to make it to the end in hopes that it would become more appealing to me, but it never did. This movie is not going to win over the masses because of its story and is more on the lines of you'll either love it or hate it. Its not a bad movie it just wasn't very appealing to me.

If this is truly a do it yourself film, then this is an achievement since the acting of the protagonist is good, the production values are decent, the editing flows and the movie has a sheen.However, to judge this as a horror movie, a felt that the film is grossly overrated. The story has been told before...person loses their sanity, society is mean to them, they retreat to their private world and ""do some killing"". This movie is quite derivative of films such as ""Pieces"", ""Maniac"", ""Carrie"", and ""Fade to Black"". Not that those are great movies and cannot be touched but the making of private being out of pieces has been done plenty of times.A lack of originality in contents can be overcome with originality in presentation...and that is where this movie falters.  There is no horror, suspense, tension or mystery. This is not scary in any way.While the character of May becomes menacing it is hardly believable. Her kills occur because her victims simply freeze from her. She cannot be deemed a genuine threat so her actions are completely unbelievable.This movie would have been better if the camp, gore and general zaniness would have been toned down and a more realistic mode of ""losing it"" been the focus.This is just your average shlock that finds it's way to a movie channel.By the way, I don't like the director at all.

754388,A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7,B00009MEC4,Siklootd,"[1, 1]","""May"" is a dark thriller/horror film that many people seem to forget about despite all of the content that the film provides.  Using dark atmosphere, twisted demeanor, and foreboding and haunting themes and images, ""May"" does a good job of providing an excellent sense of horror that many will surely enjoy.  The premise of the film is sort of a mixture between Frankenstein and Carrie and the end result is something truly disturbing and worthy of being watched at least once.The film begins by showing a young girl by the name of May.  May has a lazy eye that requires her to wear an eye-patch during her childhood, an act that the other children mock her for, teasing her that she's ""a pirate"".  As she ages, the young girl has problems making friends due to her appearance, so her mother makes her a custom doll named Suzie.  May's mother tells her that she should never take Suzie out of her glass container though, since the doll is special, a wish that May honors until her adulthood.From here, the film cuts away to depict May as a young woman, now living on her own as a veterinarian assistant.  May still deals with rejection from other humans, due to her lazy eye, and decides to go to the doctor for correction.  Her optometrist prescribes May with contact lenses that will correct the eye problem by drawing the pupil forward and central to the rest of the eye.  The lenses begin to work, and May now begins to lust after a young man by the name of Adam whom she saw working at a nearby bodyshop.May is a socially awkward adult, reminiscent of Carrie, and as a result still struggles making friends.  Her only friend seems to be her lesbian co-worker Polly (played by Anna Faris).  When May finally gets a chance to talk to Adam, she is rather inept at holding conversations, and instead focuses on his hands.  She tells him that he has beautiful hands, and is always caught staring at them or having them caress her face.  May's obsession with body parts extends past Adam.  May is obsessed with Polly's neck, constantly telling her that she has a beautiful neck.As the film progresses, May's obsession with body parts grows to unhealthy heights.  She begins to get more violent towards others as the film progresses, until the final night where she eventually loses all hopes of sanity that may have been left within her fragile mind.The film contains grotesque scenes of violence, such as the murder of a cat, children crawling on glass, and body mutilation.  These scenes add to the suspense of showing the slow transformation with May as insanity engulfs her with every passing day.  All of the actors do a great job of providing a truly fleshed out feeling for every character in the film.  Angela Bettis does an excellent job of portraying May in a truly haunting manner that is sure to stick with the viewing audience long after ejecting the disc.",5,If You Can't Find Any Friends Make One,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2868,"['May', 'dark', 'thriller/horror', 'film', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'forget', 'content', 'film', 'Using', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'twisted', 'demeanor', 'foreboding', 'haunting', 'themes', 'images', 'May', 'good', 'job', 'providing', 'excellent', 'sense', 'horror', 'many', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy', 'premise', 'film', 'sort', 'mixture', 'Frankenstein', 'Carrie', 'end', 'result', 'something', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'worthy', 'being', 'watched', 'least', 'once.The', 'film', 'begins', 'showing', 'young', 'girl', 'name', 'May', 'May', 'lazy', 'eye', 'wear', 'eye-patch', 'childhood', 'act', 'other', 'children', 'mock', 'teasing', 'pirate', 'young', 'girl', 'problems', 'making', 'friends', 'due', 'appearance', 'mother', 'custom', 'doll', 'named', 'Suzie', 'May', 'mother', 'should', 'never', 'take', 'Suzie', 'glass', 'container', 'doll', 'special', 'wish', 'May', 'honors', 'adulthood.From', 'here', 'film', 'away', 'depict', 'May', 'young', 'woman', 'now', 'living', 'own', 'veterinarian', 'assistant', 'May', 'still', 'rejection', 'other', 'humans', 'due', 'lazy', 'eye', 'decides', 'go', 'doctor', 'correction', 'optometrist', 'prescribes', 'May', 'contact', 'lenses', 'will', 'correct', 'eye', 'problem', 'drawing', 'pupil', 'forward', 'central', 'rest', 'eye', 'lenses', 'begin', 'work', 'May', 'now', 'lust', 'young', 'man', 'name', 'Adam', 'whom', 'saw', 'working', 'nearby', 'bodyshop.May', 'socially', 'awkward', 'adult', 'reminiscent', 'Carrie', 'result', 'still', 'making', 'friends', 'only', 'friend', 'be', 'lesbian', 'co-worker', 'Polly', 'played', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'When', 'May', 'finally', 'chance', 'talk', 'Adam', 'rather', 'inept', 'holding', 'conversations', 'instead', 'focuses', 'hands', 'beautiful', 'hands', 'always', 'caught', 'staring', 'having', 'caress', 'face', 'May', 'obsession', 'body', 'parts', 'past', 'Adam', 'May', 'obsessed', 'Polly', 'neck', 'constantly', 'telling', 'beautiful', 'neck.As', 'film', 'progresses', 'May', 'obsession', 'body', 'parts', 'unhealthy', 'heights', 'get', 'more', 'violent', 'towards', 'others', 'film', 'final', 'night', 'where', 'eventually', 'hopes', 'sanity', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'fragile', 'mind.The', 'film', 'contains', 'grotesque', 'scenes', 'violence', 'such', 'murder', 'cat', 'children', 'crawling', 'glass', 'body', 'mutilation', 'scenes', 'add', 'suspense', 'showing', 'slow', 'transformation', 'May', 'insanity', 'passing', 'day', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'providing', 'truly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'feeling', 'character', 'film', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'May', 'truly', 'haunting', 'manner', 'sure', 'stick', 'viewing', 'audience', 'long', 'ejecting', 'disc']",May

The main character of May, beautifully portrayed by Angela Bettis, is lost in a sea of humanity, unable to be noticed by others and incapable of communicating with anyone effectively. The film illustrates this from her early years to the present and is a solid study of a descent into complete madness. Famed critic Roger Ebert has campaigned strongly for this film and while I agree with him, I would suggest that it is not for those uninitiated with horror or the very disturbing. There are multiple sequences throughout the film that are very shocking and almost gratuitous in the display of pain and suffering.

754392,AAQ75C4BJUQLO,B00009MEC4,Sixto Limiac,"[3, 3]","It's a blatant pleasure to be absorbed into  ""one of those movies."" Unfounded by a  trace of hype nor near the Hollywood treatment, it's a wonder to see such movies come out nicely.  Especially when they pull the audiences into a disquieting twist. That's what the disturbingly droll movie, MAY, has done for me.  In its first minutes, I instinctively knew this was going to be one of those rare films that will either be embraced in its artistry or regarded as total filth. Criticism of filth tossed aside, I have to declare that this has to be one of the more engrossing movies I've seen all this year.As plastic body parts fell on the screen and May's childhood developed on screen, there were irrefutable clues that carefully hinted a later revelation for a powerful ending.  Such scenes add up like the mutilation of a dog's leg, then a shot of one lusty pair of legs, May's sick infatuation to be stabbed with a toy knife, etc.  All of it meshes together, leading to a manifestation of something surprising, and I graciously enjoyed every minute of it.The plot takes on the teenage girl, May, who is cursed with one lazy eye.  Because of it, she doesn't have much friends to begin with.  On one of her early birthday's, her mother gives her a doll she made from scratch, and tells her ""if you don`t have a friend, make one.""  A line that will turn into morbid irony.  Growing up, May is still a rather reticent girl working as a veteran's assistant.  She has an off-putting fascination with flesh, pain, death, and other abnormalities that the general masses would deem as bizarre or immoral.  Once May receives contact lenses which disguise her lazy eye as a normal one, she is ready to take on the challenge of her first date.  Despite her inability and inexperience of having any friends at all.Later in the movie, we learn she has an obsession towards human body parts.  Each person who plays some sort of role in her life, she has a type of infatuation with a specific body part, such as a flawless neck or masculine hands.  Though, May's strange persona finally catches up to her, in which the regular outdoor world will not accept as normal.  She feels the iron fist of rejection from her boyfriend, her friend, and an unfortunate punk rocker.  Thus, she is back in her lonesome life and whom does she turn to?  Her doll Susie.  Susie lost too.  May snaps, she has had enough and takes the next gruesome step in the art of making friends.  Those hands, that neck, those perfect legs, such body parts would make the perfect ""friend.""MAY isn't a traditional horror film that will throw you off your seat or summon the jitters, but a horror flick in a sense of how deep May will go to find self-contentment.  Even if it means killing those she know or immortalizing her dead cat in the freezer.  All the appalling scenes create its own grotesque nature, and underneath it all the film does manage to keep the audience laughing.  I couldn't help but chuckle when May sets her face in her crush's hand while he was crashed out on a table.  Or when she took an anxious bite into her tuna sandwich after telling her boyfriend a gruesome story of a dog's guts sprawling on the concrete.  But as the funny scenes lessen, inward came the disturbing ones like May sleeping with her dead cat, and spraying it with air freshener.The director's method of creating May was splendid.  I believe he has made use of his time and delved into her otherwise pitiful existence.  There are some scenes I thought were a bit too wacky in its own self, but I could relate to where she took up smoking, because when you are underage and in the military, its hard to get a buzz, so the next legal substance could be cigarettes?  Nah.  Anyway, May's relationship with her doll, who is encased in a glass and wood, is told precisely as it should be.  She abandons Susie after she is befriended by real people.  May begins to dislike Susie and smashes a fist on glass casing.  Consequently, the glass makes crunching noises which haunt May.  It is by these noises, the audience knows that she has lost the balance of reality.I can see why May is regarded as disturbing, like when the blind children are crawling on the floor with shards of glass scattered all over.  I cringed and winced as the eerie music played and the children moaned.  The movie deserves all of its rights.  Especially the mightily executed ending.  I didn't see that coming when she placed her final piece to her ""creation,""  and screamed ""LOOK AT ME!""  The morale of movie is right on and is an absolute piece of Drama.  Just watching May limp over her ""creation,"" crying helplessly, unraveled how troubled our world is.  And if a movie forces you to relate, wince, and reflect, then it truly is a movie worth seeing.",4,One of The More Engrossing Movies I&#65533;ve Seen,1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,4772,"['blatant', 'pleasure', 'be', 'absorbed', 'one', 'movies', 'Unfounded', 'trace', 'hype', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', 'wonder', 'see', 'such', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'nicely', 'Especially', 'when', 'pull', 'audiences', 'disquieting', 'twist', 'what', 'disturbingly', 'droll', 'movie', 'MAY', 'done', 'first', 'minutes', 'instinctively', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'embraced', 'artistry', 'regarded', 'total', 'filth', 'Criticism', 'filth', 'tossed', 'aside', 'have', 'declare', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'engrossing', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.As', 'plastic', 'body', 'parts', 'fell', 'screen', 'May', 'childhood', 'developed', 'screen', 'were', 'irrefutable', 'clues', 'carefully', 'hinted', 'later', 'revelation', 'powerful', 'ending', 'Such', 'scenes', 'add', 'up', 'mutilation', 'dog', 'leg', 'then', 'shot', 'one', 'lusty', 'pair', 'legs', 'May', 'sick', 'infatuation', 'be', 'stabbed', 'toy', 'knife', 'etc', 'together', 'leading', 'manifestation', 'something', 'surprising', 'graciously', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'it.The', 'plot', 'teenage', 'girl', 'May', 'who', 'cursed', 'one', 'lazy', 'eye', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'friends', 'begin', 'one', 'early', 'birthday', 'mother', 'doll', 'made', 'scratch', 'don', 't', 'have', 'friend', 'make', 'one', 'line', 'will', 'turn', 'morbid', 'irony', 'Growing', 'up', 'May', 'still', 'rather', 'reticent', 'girl', 'working', 'veteran', 'assistant', 'off-putting', 'fascination', 'flesh', 'pain', 'death', 'other', 'abnormalities', 'general', 'masses', 'would', 'deem', 'bizarre', 'immoral', 'Once', 'May', 'contact', 'lenses', 'disguise', 'lazy', 'eye', 'normal', 'one', 'ready', 'take', 'challenge', 'first', 'date', 'inability', 'inexperience', 'having', 'friends', 'all.Later', 'movie', 'learn', 'obsession', 'towards', 'human', 'body', 'parts', 'person', 'who', 'sort', 'role', 'life', 'type', 'infatuation', 'specific', 'body', 'part', 'such', 'flawless', 'neck', 'masculine', 'hands', 'May', 'strange', 'persona', 'finally', 'up', 'regular', 'outdoor', 'world', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'normal', 'iron', 'fist', 'rejection', 'boyfriend', 'friend', 'unfortunate', 'punk', 'rocker', 'Thus', 'back', 'lonesome', 'life', 'whom', 'turn', 'doll', 'Susie', 'Susie', 'lost', 'too', 'May', 'snaps', 'had', 'enough', 'next', 'gruesome', 'step', 'art', 'making', 'friends', 'hands', 'neck', 'perfect', 'legs', 'such', 'body', 'parts', 'would', 'make', 'perfect', 'friend', 'MAY', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'throw', 'off', 'seat', 'summon', 'jitters', 'horror', 'flick', 'sense', 'how', 'deep', 'May', 'will', 'go', 'find', 'self-contentment', 'Even', 'killing', 'know', 'immortalizing', 'dead', 'cat', 'freezer', 'appalling', 'scenes', 'create', 'own', 'grotesque', 'nature', 'film', 'manage', 'keep', 'audience', 'laughing', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'chuckle', 'when', 'May', 'face', 'crush', 'hand', 'was', 'crashed', 'out', 'table', 'when', 'took', 'anxious', 'bite', 'tuna', 'sandwich', 'telling', 'boyfriend', 'gruesome', 'story', 'dog', 'guts', 'sprawling', 'concrete', 'funny', 'scenes', 'lessen', 'inward', 'came', 'disturbing', 'ones', 'May', 'sleeping', 'dead', 'cat', 'spraying', 'air', 'freshener.The', 'director', 'method', 'creating', 'May', 'was', 'splendid', 'believe', 'made', 'use', 'time', 'delved', 'otherwise', 'pitiful', 'existence', 'are', 'scenes', 'thought', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'wacky', 'own', 'self', 'could', 'relate', 'where', 'took', 'up', 'smoking', 'when', 'are', 'underage', 'military', 'hard', 'get', 'buzz', 'next', 'legal', 'substance', 'could', 'be', 'cigarettes', 'Nah', 'Anyway', 'May', 'relationship', 'doll', 'who', 'encased', 'glass', 'wood', 'told', 'precisely', 'should', 'be', 'Susie', 'befriended', 'real', 'people', 'May', 'dislike', 'Susie', 'fist', 'glass', 'casing', 'Consequently', 'glass', 'crunching', 'noises', 'haunt', 'May', 'noises', 'audience', 'lost', 'balance', 'reality.I', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'May', 'regarded', 'disturbing', 'when', 'blind', 'children', 'are', 'crawling', 'floor', 'shards', 'glass', 'scattered', 'cringed', 'winced', 'eerie', 'music', 'played', 'children', 'moaned', 'movie', 'rights', 'Especially', 'mightily', 'executed', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'when', 'placed', 'final', 'piece', 'creation', 'screamed', 'LOOK', 'AT', 'ME', 'morale', 'movie', 'right', 'absolute', 'piece', 'Drama', 'Just', 'watching', 'May', 'limp', 'creation', 'crying', 'helplessly', 'unraveled', 'how', 'troubled', 'world', 'movie', 'relate', 'wince', 'reflect', 'then', 'truly', 'movie', 'seeing']",May

We have been forced to believe that horror movies must consist of the following.1)Bad acting2)Thin plot lines3)No character development4)A freak killer taking out teenagers one by one5)All the teens killed are bad and thus somehow deserve it6)Every other cliche thats been used time and time again.May provides the Dario Argento style of horror we haven't seen here in the states for a long time. While Director Lucky McKee may not ever get to display the graphic violence seen in Mr. Argento's films he has successfuly displayed the tension and immense shock they contain but also more importantly he shows the art behind the blood. May has great acting, especially by the lead actress. The scariest thing is to make you LIKE a character before they are brutally killed. The innocent are truly the most scary of all victims. Making you FEEL for someone so when they are killed you're like &quot;oh man they didn't deserve that.&quot;Now this is what horror is. This movie get's pretty intense as it builds our strange yet loveable heroine/villian  to her inevitable conclusion about making friends.It'll freak you out but leave you feeling strangely attached to all the preceding events. I look forward to THE VILLAGE the next project by this great up and coming horror director. Note all the little Dario Argento things scattered through out the film. (If this is your first time hearing the name Dario Argento, I warn you his movie (OPERA) freaked me out and made me fear his name under movie titles lol.

754397,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B00009MEC4,Takis Tz.,"[2, 4]","This is a good eerie thriller that has ""indie"" written all over it: from the way it's filmed and the actors cast to the soundtrack used and the overall atmosphere.May, a ""weirdo""-extraordinaire, is a young woman struggling to somehow fit in this world. Having grown up with a doll as her only friend she finds it extremely difficult to interact with live human beings.Her only apparent existence in the ""outside"" world is her job, and that happens to be a workplace where the weirdness doesn't smoothen over as it is an animal hospital with a doctor that speaks his very own version of english and a lesbian co-worker that sees May as her next conquest.But May has other plans as she becomes fixated on Adam, a cool slacker who seems to fit May's ambitions for a first boyfriend. Adam, who as he confesses ""likes weird"" does fall for May (after May puts up a whole plan to get him) only to discover that May is a little bit...too weird even for his tastes (Adam is a guy who's at the time finishing a small film of his that tends on the quite gory side). Adam splits and things begin to unravel inside May's volcanic world.Predictably, May doesnt take to this lightly and after a brief stint wth her lesbian colleague she finds herself ""betrayed"" again as she realises that her new hope for a love source turns out to be only caring for the sex part which she practices with several partners.It's time then for that inner volcano of May's to explode. If people are set on betraying her and if she can't find someone who will love her and be her friend then she will create one. May decides to play God complete with wrath and imagination.The end of the film which i wont reveal to its fullest detail is quite brutal, gory and eerie. And the whole movie alltogether is an underground gem that somehow got lost in the latest releases but which has to be discovered for any fan of the horror or thriller genre.This film has a number of things going for it that make it special: firstly and most notably the incredible performance of Angella Bettis. She's a glove-fit for May's role and I'd really have to think to find a performance that celebrates eerieness, weirdness and fear-emission the way Bettis manages. This is a role that has to be seen. But she's not alone in her efforts nor does she carry the movie solely on her shoulders. Adam, played by Jeremy Sisto is an equally great outing. Sisto seems totally natural in his role as the womanizer slacker, and he is analogously interesting as a character as May. Same goes though for May's lesbian colleague who is also terrifically convincing.This movie rolls the high rails of ""classic"" for almost the distance but the scriptwriter loses his focus in the last minutes of the film as this whole tragedy gets resolved in a butchery way. This is the only reason i deem this a 4-star film: the plotholes towards the end.But other than that this is strong stuff. Everybody involved here does an arguably great job in putting together an eerie-atmosphere masterpiece. Pity they didn't stay cautious with the details in the end but this takes very little away from the film.Very reccommendable for horror-thriller afficionados, not so for the rest whom -i suspect- might find this film disturbing at the very least. But speaking of that, it's the ""disturbingness"" that will have a hold of you throughout and that's an added plus.",4,May's patchy lil' world...,1073865600,"01 12, 2004",2004,3375,"['good', 'eerie', 'thriller', 'indie', 'written', 'way', 'filmed', 'actors', 'cast', 'soundtrack', 'used', 'overall', 'atmosphere.May', 'weirdo', '-extraordinaire', 'young', 'woman', 'struggling', 'somehow', 'fit', 'world', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'doll', 'only', 'friend', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'interact', 'live', 'human', 'only', 'apparent', 'existence', 'outside', 'world', 'job', 'be', 'workplace', 'where', 'weirdness', ""n't"", 'smoothen', 'over', 'animal', 'hospital', 'doctor', 'very', 'own', 'version', 'english', 'lesbian', 'co-worker', 'May', 'next', 'conquest.But', 'May', 'other', 'plans', 'fixated', 'Adam', 'cool', 'slacker', 'who', 'fit', 'May', 'ambitions', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'Adam', 'who', 'likes', 'weird', 'fall', 'May', 'May', 'up', 'whole', 'plan', 'get', 'only', 'discover', 'May', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'weird', 'even', 'tastes', 'Adam', 'guy', 'who', 'time', 'finishing', 'small', 'film', 'quite', 'gory', 'side', 'Adam', 'splits', 'things', 'begin', 'unravel', 'inside', 'May', 'volcanic', 'world.Predictably', 'May', 'doesnt', 'take', 'lightly', 'brief', 'stint', 'wth', 'lesbian', 'colleague', 'betrayed', 'again', 'new', 'hope', 'love', 'source', 'out', 'be', 'only', 'caring', 'sex', 'part', 'practices', 'several', 'partners.It', 'time', 'then', 'inner', 'volcano', 'May', 'explode', 'people', 'are', 'set', 'betraying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'love', 'be', 'friend', 'then', 'will', 'create', 'one', 'May', 'play', 'God', 'complete', 'wrath', 'imagination.The', 'end', 'film', 'i', 'wont', 'reveal', 'fullest', 'detail', 'quite', 'brutal', 'gory', 'eerie', 'whole', 'movie', 'alltogether', 'underground', 'gem', 'got', 'lost', 'latest', 'releases', 'be', 'discovered', 'fan', 'horror', 'thriller', 'genre.This', 'film', 'number', 'things', 'going', 'make', 'special', 'firstly', 'most', 'notably', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Angella', 'Bettis', 'glove-fit', 'May', 'role', ""'d"", 'really', 'have', 'think', 'find', 'performance', 'eerieness', 'weirdness', 'fear-emission', 'way', 'Bettis', 'role', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'alone', 'efforts', 'carry', 'movie', 'solely', 'shoulders', 'Adam', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'equally', 'great', 'outing', 'Sisto', 'totally', 'natural', 'role', 'womanizer', 'slacker', 'analogously', 'interesting', 'character', 'May', 'Same', 'May', 'lesbian', 'colleague', 'who', 'also', 'terrifically', 'convincing.This', 'movie', 'high', 'rails', 'classic', 'almost', 'distance', 'scriptwriter', 'focus', 'last', 'minutes', 'film', 'whole', 'tragedy', 'resolved', 'butchery', 'way', 'only', 'reason', 'i', 'deem', '4-star', 'film', 'plotholes', 'end.But', 'other', 'strong', 'stuff', 'Everybody', 'involved', 'here', 'arguably', 'great', 'job', 'putting', 'together', 'eerie-atmosphere', 'masterpiece', 'Pity', 'did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'cautious', 'details', 'end', 'very', 'little', 'away', 'film.Very', 'reccommendable', 'horror-thriller', 'afficionados', 'not', 'so', 'rest', 'whom', '-i', 'suspect-', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'disturbing', 'very', 'least', 'speaking', 'disturbingness', 'will', 'have', 'hold', 'added', 'plus']",May

At least that's how everyone around May feels.  Played by Angela Bettis, May is an interesting character that explores what it means to be human and what society thinks of perfection.  Oh, and it's about blood, guts and gore.In this darkly amusing fable, May has grown up with a lazy eye, an imperfection that has blackened her outlook on life.  Being taught to cover up and hide imperfection, May seeks out those who are perfect only to discover they are human and not perfect.  There is a lot of symbolism and subtle issues going on behind the scenes.  On one hand, this can be looked at as a modern retelling of Frankenstein.  But, on the other hand it is a love story and a slasher film.However, by using the slasher genre to explore themes of loss and the human condition, writer/director Lucky McKee creates a film that really transcends the genre.  When at its best, May shows us how society is so transfixed on perfection that we lose sight of what makes everyone unique.  May, the character, becomes so transfixed on this idea of perfection (handed down to her by her crazed ""normal"" mom), that she goes insane in trying to replicate the perfect human.  What follows is hillarious but tragic and dark path down some of the worst of human nature.The entire movie hinges on the performance of Angela Bettis and she does a terrific job bringing this antisocial and shy girl to life.  Her pain is achingly real so that when rejection comes from all sides, we can understand  her eventual breakdown.  Strong performances by Anna Faris and Jeremy Sisto even out the movie and bring in some bitingly refreshing humor.A terrific movie, I would recommend giving May a chance if you are looking for humor and a moral to go along with your gore.",4,Darkly humorous and disturbing,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,1842,"['May', 'kind', 'person', 'are', 'friends', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'get', 'rid', 'least', 'how', 'everyone', 'around', 'May', 'feels', 'Played', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'May', 'interesting', 'character', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'what', 'society', 'thinks', 'perfection', 'Oh', 'about', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore.In', 'darkly', 'amusing', 'fable', 'May', 'grown', 'up', 'lazy', 'eye', 'imperfection', 'blackened', 'outlook', 'life', 'Being', 'taught', 'cover', 'up', 'hide', 'imperfection', 'May', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'perfect', 'only', 'discover', 'are', 'human', 'not', 'perfect', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'subtle', 'issues', 'going', 'scenes', 'one', 'hand', 'can', 'be', 'looked', 'modern', 'retelling', 'Frankenstein', 'other', 'hand', 'love', 'story', 'slasher', 'film.However', 'using', 'slasher', 'genre', 'explore', 'themes', 'loss', 'human', 'condition', 'writer/director', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'film', 'really', 'genre', 'When', 'best', 'May', 'how', 'society', 'so', 'transfixed', 'perfection', 'lose', 'sight', 'what', 'everyone', 'unique', 'May', 'character', 'so', 'transfixed', 'idea', 'perfection', 'handed', 'down', 'crazed', 'normal', 'mom', 'insane', 'trying', 'replicate', 'perfect', 'human', 'What', 'hillarious', 'tragic', 'dark', 'path', 'down', 'worst', 'human', 'nature.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'hinges', 'performance', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'terrific', 'job', 'bringing', 'antisocial', 'shy', 'girl', 'life', 'pain', 'achingly', 'real', 'so', 'when', 'rejection', 'sides', 'can', 'understand', 'eventual', 'breakdown', 'Strong', 'performances', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'even', 'out', 'movie', 'bring', 'bitingly', 'refreshing', 'humor.A', 'terrific', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'giving', 'May', 'chance', 'are', 'looking', 'humor', 'moral', 'go', 'along', 'gore']",May

Born with a lazy eye, for which she wore a patch while growing up, she became a loner oddball whose only friend was a perfectly kept doll. She moves to L.A. and takes up with a filmmaker (Jeremy Sisto), but the relationship sours quickly -- and dangerously. She then befriends an alluring lesbian colleague (Anna Faris), but that, too, along with every connection May attempts to make, turns deadly.I found May accidentally one day while surfing the web. There were several very positive reviews, and as I am always open to discovering new independent films, I rented it as soon as possible. May  is the story of a girl who is born with a lazy eye and becomes very socially isolated as a result. Her only true friend is a doll enclosed in glass that she can never touch. The movie focuses on how May as an adult has reached the brink: she is either going to begin to learn to make friends and interact with people normally... or not. The movie is hip-deep in imagery and metaphors, most of which are fairly disturbing. May's attempts to interact with people will make you cringe with embarassment; many of the scenes are very bloody and the movie climaxes with some fairly graphic violence. But it's the more subtle imagery- primarily focusing on May's doll- that really set the creepy, uncomfortable tone. You can't believe something like this could ever happen... but on the other hand, you almost can. The underlying idea is a fairly common and basic one: the desire to make a connection with another human being. May takes that promise and puts a new, disturbing, and fascinating spin on it. If you are not able to handle graphic and disturbing images, May is not for you. If you like unique, disturbing, intelligently made movies that actually make you think, then you will love this film. Absolutely one of the best movies I have seen in years; I immediately bought a copy after watching it, and I can't give a much better review than that.

754403,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B00009MEC4,titania86,"[3, 3]","May is a very sweet and odd girl. As a child, she was ostracized in grade school because she had to wear an eye patch to try to correct her lazy eye. The only friend she had was the creepy doll her mother gave her that she wasn't allowed to take out of the case. As an adult, her doll continues to be her only friend while she works as a vet's assistant and enjoys making her own clothes at home as an accomplished seamstress. One day, she observes a boy that works at the auto shop from afar and falls in love with him and his beautiful hands. She goes out with him for a while, but scares him away with her odd behavior. This trend of people disappointing her and things generally going wrong extends to all of her friends and endeavors to reach out to people, so she decides to follow her mother's advice: ""If you can't find a friend, make one."" On Halloween, May arms herself with vet's tools and a cooler to gather the best of her friends and make her very own best friend.This is an odd little gem of a film that I heard about on my search for more horror films to watch. It took me a while to find the DVD, but it was definitely worth the wait. May is a wonderful modern retelling of Mary Shelley's classic novel, Frankenstein.The beginning of the film just makes me smile. May is so odd and sweet. Her budding romance with Adam is so cute and it seems as if they are made for each other. She is incredibly creepy and nonchalantly talks about a dog's stitches bursting, his guts spilling all over the yard, and dying because of a mistake by the vet. He makes weird cannibal romance films. Their relationship doesn't work out and Adam ends it, but doesn't extend even the opportunity for friendship to May.I connect with May. I feel like I would be friends with her if she weren't homicidal. Like May, I also had to wear an eye patch as a child. I have never heard of anyone else having to do that, so I immediately felt a kinship with her. Her mother is incredibly overprotective, yet seemed really cold towards May. The beautiful porcelain doll in a glass box is a great metaphor for May's relationship with her mother, with May as the doll, protected but alone in her box. This image is reinforced when she dresses up as the doll for Halloween in the final night of the film. It saddened me when May really tries to find any sort of relationship and the results always proves disastrous. Although her actions are extreme and people hopefully wouldn't do that in real life, the motives behind it are understandable by anyone. Everyone can relate to feeling alone and wanting to connect with the people around them. In this way, May is like Dr. Frankenstein and the monster in one. She sets out to create a creature, but feels the anguish and loneliness that the creature feels. This character would be very easy to dislike and even demonize if it weren't handled as well as Angela Bettis did in the film. May does some very odd things, even before she resorts to murder, but the viewer is with her the entire way because of the endearing quality she has. She remained sweet in her own odd way, even while murdering people and sewing their parts together.One of the aspects of the film that I liked is the doll that is May's only close friend. It talks to her throughout the film. At first, the viewer figures that May just talks to it like a person would talk out loud to themselves. Later on in the film, when May's life is crumbling around her, the doll seems to be screaming at her, conveyed by soft, incoherent murmurings and the cracking of the glass surrounding the doll. The cracking gets deafening when May talks to Adam to try to spend time together and he rejects her, partly because she yelled very loudly in an effort to silence the doll. The moment where May's world really unravels completely is accompanied by the destruction of the doll and the glass box that protects it, which extends the May as a doll metaphor.This film is very memorable with its almost fairy tale feel coupled with grisly scenes of murder. It straddles the line between horror and comedy, resulting in great black comedy.

This is our generation's &quot;Carrie&quot;.  It's about an outcast girl trying to make friends, but unable to acclimate herself to society.  Each rejection drives her deeper into a psychotic abyss and is symbolized nicely by the glass case around her best friend, a doll, cracking little by little with each subsequent incident.  I truly enjoyed this film.  May is so relatable that it's disturbing.  This movie is for all of the outcasts who have felt socially powerless,totally alone and just wished for one true friend.  Angela Bettis is so adorable as the title character I wanted to reach into the screen and pull her out.  I felt a twinge of all-too-familiar frustration each time she came so close to finding a friend and then does something that freaks the other person out and sends them running. Even as she prepares her grisly solution her so-beautiful-it's-creepy smile just lights up the screen.  But don't expect a good-time teen flick about awkward social situations.  This movie will make you cringe and squirm more than once.  I don't think I'll ever get the image of a classroom full of blind kids crawling over broken glass and painting the floor with their blood out of my head.  This is an utterly disturbing portrait of an innocent young girl driven to madness by her inability to be accepted for who she is.  The result is so twisted that only someone who sees the world from May's point of view could truly appreciate it.  If you grew up idolizing &quot;Carrie&quot;, this might be the movie for you.

And when she was alone, her mother told her: &quot;If you don't have friend, make one.&quot;  She remembers these words long afterwards.Now grown-up, May works at animal hospital, where she is good at cutting and stitching.  Her co-worker Polly is a lesbian, and knows how to have fun while May still cannot know how to communicate well with others, except with her doll Susie.Then she meets someone, a possible boyfriend Adam, who is an aspiring movie director (his maestro being Dario Argento, who must have influenced Lucky McKee too).  May is happy, too happy to know that Adam can enjoy being with her, a strange little girl, only up to a point.  Kissing is a good thing, but biting the lip too hard is another thing.The film slowly sets up the personalities of characters, and it never relies on the ordinary 'by the number' method of body-counting.  Actually, May is quite unique in trying to portray the deadly heroine in a sympathtic light.This is a crucial point, because Angela Bettis can be in fact a beautiful, cute girl.  And so is May, only when she chooses to be so.  But we notice she is not a girl you normally meet at party, and her behaviors are far from usual (you don't talk to your doll, do you?)  Some find it pathetic; but others (like Adam, Lucky McKee, and me of course) find it quirky but charming ... up tp a point.So, don't expect this film to be a so-called &quot;slasher film.&quot;  There is &quot;slash&quot;ing scenes, but that is not meant for a big shock.  Watch this as a character study, even though the material itself is a borrowed one (I mean, like &quot;Carrie&quot; of which TV series Bettis starred in).My last, but not least praise should go to Anna Faris, who was in ... er ... &quot;Scary Movies.&quot;  She is a much better actress than you are led to believe after seeing her fighting with a masked killer or a cat.
