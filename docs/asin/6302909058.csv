344972,A32N7HHCJMT0YA,6302909058,Adam Fisher,"[0, 1]","You know, the Amityville freak that I am, I have to say that although the producers of this movie had the right idea, it just didn't scare me the way the first and even the second Amityville movies did. One thing that was lacking in the 3-D movie here was the fact that much, if not all of the movie was taking place during the daytime. The first Amityville movie featured frightening hauntings, strange voices and eerie occurences in the early, early morning hours(between 2-4 A.M.), which are creepy hours to begin with. And I also felt that the fly scenes are a bit old by now, it's time after the first and second movies to start with some newer and different types of hauntings. The only time I felt that the movie did start to pick up was near the end, the last twenty minutes or so in the basement, which I won't give away. But I will say that it went on late at night, which is when the majority of the movie's spooky occurences should've taken place. The basement of that house was always to me, the downright scariest damn part of the house. On the plus side, I will give the producers of the movie credit for using the exact same house for this movie as the original movie used. Because if you're going to make an Amityville movie, it helps immensely to use the exact same house. And another scene that I felt was REALLY REALLY chilling(and made me feel as though the story is finally about to pick up) is when Lori Loughlin(the daughter of the home owner in this movie who is beautiful as always), goes out onto the lake with her friends on the boat that's tied to the dock in the back of the house. But, I also won't give away what happens there. It is worth taking a look at if you're an Amityville freak like me, but if you haven't seen any Amityville movies yet, watch the original Amityville movie FIRST. And watch it on DVD. The color has been restored so greatly on the DVD it's unbelievable. And watch it late at night, between 1-4 a.m. for the best chilling effects. ""Amityville 2:The Possession"" Is the second edition of the Amityville series, and I felt that for a sequel, it was VERY underrated and it has some very, very creepy, cr-eepy moments in it. it uses the original Amityville house as well, and the mother AND older daughter are VERY, VERY beautiful which also helps. I'd call the second Amityville movie a MUST SEE as well, especially for the scenes during the last 15 minutes of the movie. All I can say is, wait 'til you see what happens in that dreaded basement later on in the movie!!",3,Disappointing,1068336000,"11 9, 2003",2003,2522,"['know', 'Amityville', 'freak', 'am', 'have', 'say', 'producers', 'movie', 'had', 'right', 'idea', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'scare', 'way', 'first', 'even', 'second', 'Amityville', 'movies', 'did', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'lacking', '3-D', 'movie', 'here', 'was', 'fact', 'much', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'daytime', 'first', 'Amityville', 'movie', 'featured', 'frightening', 'hauntings', 'strange', 'voices', 'eerie', 'occurences', 'early', 'early', 'morning', 'hours', '2-4', 'A.M.', 'are', 'creepy', 'hours', 'begin', 'also', 'felt', 'fly', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'old', 'now', 'time', 'first', 'second', 'movies', 'start', 'newer', 'different', 'types', 'hauntings', 'only', 'time', 'felt', 'movie', 'did', 'start', 'pick', 'up', 'was', 'end', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'basement', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'will', 'say', 'went', 'late', 'night', 'when', 'majority', 'movie', 'spooky', 'occurences', 'should', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'place', 'basement', 'house', 'was', 'always', 'downright', 'scariest', 'damn', 'part', 'house', 'plus', 'side', 'will', 'give', 'producers', 'movie', 'credit', 'using', 'exact', 'same', 'house', 'movie', 'original', 'movie', 'used', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'Amityville', 'movie', 'immensely', 'use', 'exact', 'same', 'house', 'scene', 'felt', 'was', 'REALLY', 'REALLY', 'chilling', 'made', 'feel', 'story', 'finally', 'pick', 'up', 'when', 'Lori', 'Loughlin', 'daughter', 'home', 'owner', 'movie', 'who', 'beautiful', 'always', 'out', 'lake', 'friends', 'boat', 'tied', 'dock', 'back', 'house', 'also', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'what', 'there', 'worth', 'taking', 'look', ""'re"", 'Amityville', 'freak', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Amityville', 'movies', 'yet', 'watch', 'original', 'Amityville', 'movie', 'FIRST', 'watch', 'DVD', 'color', 'been', 'restored', 'so', 'greatly', 'DVD', 'unbelievable', 'watch', 'late', 'night', '1-4', 'a.m.', 'best', 'chilling', 'effects', 'Amityville', '2', 'Possession', 'second', 'edition', 'Amityville', 'series', 'felt', 'sequel', 'was', 'VERY', 'underrated', 'very', 'very', 'creepy', 'cr-eepy', 'moments', 'original', 'Amityville', 'house', 'as', 'well', 'mother', 'AND', 'older', 'daughter', 'are', 'VERY', 'VERY', 'beautiful', 'also', ""'d"", 'call', 'second', 'Amityville', 'movie', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'well', 'especially', 'scenes', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'dreaded', 'basement', 'later', 'movie']",N/A

As tiresome and clueless as Amityville 3-D feels, the seemingly stronger cast can't save me. It is a good thing that somebody wised up for shamelessly ripping off The Exorcist. But too bad, they start to rip off The Omen. The trailer for Amityville 3-D is undoubtedly one of the worst I've seen. It starts off like this: a reverse explosion of a house, an Amityville 3-D logo appearing, and a forward explosion of the house before ending with the line A Dino de Laurentiis Production. That trailer alone serves a great warning of what to expect out of Amityville 3-D.",1,Hmmm....Nope!,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,662,"['Viewed', '7/05Rate', '27/05', 'Amityville', '3-D', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'Amityville', 'Bore', 'line', 'tiresome', 'clueless', 'Amityville', '3-D', 'feels', 'seemingly', 'stronger', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'good', 'thing', 'somebody', 'wised', 'up', 'shamelessly', 'ripping', 'off', 'Exorcist', 'too', 'bad', 'start', 'rip', 'off', 'Omen', 'trailer', 'Amityville', '3-D', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reverse', 'explosion', 'house', 'Amityville', '3-D', 'logo', 'appearing', 'forward', 'explosion', 'house', 'ending', 'line', 'A', 'Dino', 'Laurentiis', 'Production', 'trailer', 'alone', 'great', 'warning', 'what', 'expect', 'Amityville', '3-D']",N/A
344974,A2582KMXLK2P06,6302909058,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Amityville 3-D makes me wonder something- why does it even exist?  I mean we had the classic original Amityville Horror which is easily my favorite one and has yet to be topped, and the sequel called the Possession which is almost as good with the exception of a few lackluster moments in the second half, and then... rather quickly, a third Amityville arrives on the scene in Amityville 3-D.  Was this film necessary?  I suppose the popularity of the first two made the decision to create a third one quite easy for the movie writers/producers, but looking back... this film is easily the weakest of the first three.Truthfully however, this movie is nothing particularly great.  It takes bits and pieces of the first two and uses them way too often.  The flies being the biggest offender.  Remember the scene in the original Amityville Horror when the priest enters the upstairs room and is soon surrounded by flies?  Well the flies for whatever reason, is a VERY popular theme in this movie and used to a rather extreme extent.  They basically even recreate the scene with the priest, and later on the flies come back a few more times.  It's too much.  Too many flies!By the way on an unrelated note, every time I see a swarm of flies buzzing around windows, I think about that time when my upstairs attic window was covered with thousands of flies.  This wouldn't have been so odd if it wasn't for the fact this occurred in the middle of February and was freezing cold outside.  Odd indeed.This movie also doesn't really contain any dramatic and substantial fears until the final 5 minutes, which is the biggest problem.  Up to that point we have hit or miss fears that barely trigger a reaction out of me such as, to name a couple examples, when a giant puddle of water (or acid) appears in the basement floor with demons lurking inside capable of burning people/taking them to the depths of the darkest places.  Or how about the laughable elevator part when Tony Roberts is simply going for a ride, then a fly appears and suddenly the elevator goes crazy.  Incredibly funny!  Before this the series only hinted that the supernatural that lurks within the Amityville house can travel away from home.  Or the woman who has an accident and burns to death inside her vehicle, however it's extremely obvious that the skeleton we see afterwards is entirely fake.  They shouldn't have even included the skeleton segment.The writing is fairly bad as well.  Make that consistently average.  We hardly ever feel like sympathizing with the family not only because we've more or les seen this same concept used for the third time now, but also because nobody is really taking the stories of the previous owners being killed in dramatic fashion seriously, so everyone ignores the warnings.  Characters lack emotion (because they're positive the place isn't really haunted- the wrong approach for a horror movie) and the atmosphere is  less dramatic as a result.  Also, unintentionally, Tony Roberts seriously feels out of place doing a movie like this and shows no emotion of any kind, and of course Meg Ryan does as well (but she's young here and wasn't a popular celebrity yet, so I can forgive this one).  The one actress who is WAY out of place however, is Full House's Lori Laughlin.  What is SHE doing in a movie like this, haha!  She was quite cute as a teenager I admit and even resembles Diane Franklin from the second Amityville Horror which is probably why she got the part.  I can't believe this is the same woman who would often cuddle Michelle on Full House just a few years later!With that said, Lori Laughlin's character is responsible for the best moment in the entire movie.  Clearly the freakiest moment.  It's when (and this is a SPOILER, I'm warning you) she dies, walks inside, walks up the stairs, and the mother asks what's wrong/what she's doing.  Lori turns and doesn't answer.  She keep walking.  Why?  Because it's not really her- she's actually dead at this point (she drowns) and she's laying in the yard outside being resuscitated.  VERY good moment of the movie.  Of course when total chaos breaks loose at the end of the movie *that* is probably the very best moment.  It's a shame that the writing for the most part isn't up to par and doesn't deliver with the same kind of unforgettable fears that the first two movies brought to the table.  Either way, not a bad movie at all.  Just disappointing.",3,flies are buzzing... and they're not gonna stop,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,4425,"['Amityville', '3-D', 'wonder', 'something-', 'why', 'even', 'exist', 'mean', 'had', 'classic', 'original', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'easily', 'favorite', 'one', 'yet', 'be', 'topped', 'sequel', 'called', 'Possession', 'almost', 'good', 'exception', 'few', 'lackluster', 'moments', 'second', 'half', 'then', 'rather', 'quickly', 'third', 'Amityville', 'scene', 'Amityville', '3-D.', 'Was', 'film', 'necessary', 'suppose', 'popularity', 'first', 'two', 'made', 'decision', 'create', 'third', 'one', 'quite', 'easy', 'movie', 'writers/producers', 'looking', 'back', 'film', 'easily', 'weakest', 'first', 'three.Truthfully', 'however', 'movie', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'great', 'bits', 'pieces', 'first', 'two', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'flies', 'being', 'biggest', 'offender', 'Remember', 'scene', 'original', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'when', 'priest', 'enters', 'upstairs', 'room', 'soon', 'surrounded', 'flies', 'Well', 'flies', 'reason', 'VERY', 'popular', 'theme', 'movie', 'used', 'rather', 'extreme', 'extent', 'basically', 'even', 'recreate', 'scene', 'priest', 'later', 'flies', 'come', 'back', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'too', 'much', 'Too', 'many', 'flies', 'way', 'unrelated', 'note', 'time', 'see', 'swarm', 'flies', 'buzzing', 'around', 'windows', 'think', 'time', 'when', 'upstairs', 'attic', 'window', 'was', 'covered', 'thousands', 'flies', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'odd', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'occurred', 'middle', 'February', 'was', 'freezing', 'cold', 'outside', 'Odd', 'indeed.This', 'movie', 'also', ""n't"", 'really', 'contain', 'dramatic', 'substantial', 'fears', 'final', '5', 'minutes', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Up', 'point', 'have', 'hit', 'miss', 'fears', 'barely', 'reaction', 'such', 'name', 'couple', 'examples', 'when', 'giant', 'puddle', 'water', 'acid', 'basement', 'floor', 'demons', 'lurking', 'capable', 'burning', 'people/taking', 'depths', 'darkest', 'places', 'how', 'laughable', 'elevator', 'part', 'when', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'simply', 'going', 'ride', 'then', 'fly', 'suddenly', 'elevator', 'crazy', 'Incredibly', 'funny', 'series', 'only', 'hinted', 'supernatural', 'Amityville', 'house', 'can', 'travel', 'away', 'home', 'woman', 'who', 'accident', 'burns', 'death', 'vehicle', 'however', 'extremely', 'obvious', 'skeleton', 'see', 'afterwards', 'entirely', 'fake', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'included', 'skeleton', 'segment.The', 'writing', 'fairly', 'bad', 'as', 'well', 'Make', 'consistently', 'average', 'hardly', 'ever', 'feel', 'sympathizing', 'family', 'not', 'only', ""'ve"", 'more', 'seen', 'same', 'concept', 'used', 'third', 'time', 'now', 'also', 'nobody', 'really', 'taking', 'stories', 'previous', 'owners', 'being', 'killed', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'seriously', 'everyone', 'warnings', 'Characters', 'lack', 'emotion', ""'re"", 'positive', 'place', ""n't"", 'really', 'haunted-', 'wrong', 'approach', 'horror', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'less', 'dramatic', 'result', 'Also', 'unintentionally', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'seriously', 'place', 'doing', 'movie', 'emotion', 'kind', 'course', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'popular', 'celebrity', 'yet', 'can', 'forgive', 'one', 'one', 'actress', 'who', 'WAY', 'place', 'however', 'Full', 'House', 'Lori', 'Laughlin', 'What', 'SHE', 'doing', 'movie', 'haha', 'was', 'quite', 'cute', 'teenager', 'admit', 'even', 'resembles', 'Diane', 'Franklin', 'second', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'probably', 'why', 'got', 'part', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'same', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'often', 'cuddle', 'Michelle', 'Full', 'House', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'said', 'Lori', 'Laughlin', 'character', 'responsible', 'best', 'moment', 'entire', 'movie', 'Clearly', 'freakiest', 'moment', 'when', 'SPOILER', ""'m"", 'warning', 'walks', 'up', 'stairs', 'mother', 'what', 'wrong/what', 'doing', 'Lori', ""n't"", 'answer', 'keep', 'walking', 'Why', 'not', 'really', 'her-', 'actually', 'dead', 'point', 'laying', 'yard', 'being', 'resuscitated', 'VERY', 'good', 'moment', 'movie', 'course', 'when', 'total', 'chaos', 'breaks', 'loose', 'end', 'movie', '*that*', 'probably', 'very', 'best', 'moment', 'shame', 'writing', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'same', 'kind', 'unforgettable', 'fears', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'brought', 'table', 'way', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'Just', 'disappointing']",N/A

344978,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,6302909058,Bruce Rux,"[6, 7]","This wonderful, underrated haunted house/ghost story has been lost to time owing to the fact that it is a. a (second) sequel, b. a sequel in a not very good film series (based on supposedly true events that everyone always pretty well knew weren't true at all), and c. a gimmick movie. But it's much better than that, and deserves a fresh look.Supernatural debunker Tony Roberts and his girlfriend Candy Clark, who run a magazine devoted to exposing charlatanry, obtain the notorious haunted Amityville house. Roberts refuses to recognize signs of genuine paranormal activity going on around them, but accedes to having scientific ghost phenomena researcher Robert Joy give the house a going-over after two of his loved ones die and a third loses her mind because of the house.The production on this movie is really top-notch. It has very little jump-out-of-the-dark scare in it, more in the slow and sensually horrific mode. Though the finale goes a little over the top, virtually the entire film is handled like an adult version of Tobe Hooper's more childish Poltergeist. The supernatural phenomena are relatively realistic, for the most part. People hallucinate; they have accidents; voices are heard, or things are seen, but there is no obvious attribution to anything supernatural or demonic - the phenomena simply are, that's all, and some people don't handle them well and end up coming to harm. And yet, there is an underpinning of evil to the entire proceedings that is quite effectively realized.The cast are all terrific. Tess Harper is Roberts' estranged ex-wife, who loses her marbles - quite convincingly - as a result of her exposure to phenomena in the house. Lori Loughlin is their adorable daughter, whose best friend is a young and racy Meg Ryan. Veteran director Richard Fleischer keeps things moving nicely, without ever sacrificing the rich atmosphere.The 3-D effects actually don't ""fall flat,"" so to speak, in 2-D - they still communicate pretty well, with clever camerawork that creates illusions of perspective in creepy fashion. The music score and cinematography are perfect - the film has a dark look and feel, and the score is slow, low and eerie.All in all - though with occasional lapses - a haunted house movie for the thinking adults.

Now, the first two films were based on the actual events of the Amityville murders. This film is, indeed, a sequel, but the events that go on in this film, are ficticious. This film was not as good as the first two, but I still enjoyed this film to a rather good extent, but I wish it had been more terrifyingly scary, as the first two had been.Ignoring the house's sinister evil past, JOHN BAXTER (played by Tony Roberts) unwittingly buys the Amityville house on 112 Ocean Ave., after being divorced from his b*tch of a wife, NANCY (played by Tess Harper). John has bought this house for the solitude he needs in order to write his first novel. John also has another profession, dealing with supernatural investigation. His partner in that business is MELANIE (played by Candy Clark). One afternoon, Melanie heads over to the house to meet John there, but she has an encounter with the house's evil, where she runs out of the house, after John arrives. He talks to her about it, but he can get out of her is that she knows there's something in that house that is pure evil.John's beautiful daughter, SUSAN (played by Lori Loughlin), and her friend, LISA (played by a young Meg Ryan), go into the house and look around, where Lisa tells Susan about the DeFeo's, who murdered by their oldest son, Ronald. They head into the basement, and find a well, where the evil is contained. As they look at the well, while talking about the murders, they begin hearing footsteps right above them and over to the basement stairs. The footsteps belong to John. The girls are relieved.That night, Melanie leaves the house and heads on home, but on her way, Melanie is locked in her car, where she suddenly catches on fire, and burns to death. Coincidentally, the man who sold John the house, had also been killed, but a sworm of flies. Seems as though, whoever comes in contact with John and the house, ends up with a brutal demise.The next afternoon, Susan, Lisa, and their friends, head over to the house. They hold a seance, where they ask if there is anybody in danger. The cup moves towards ""Yes"". They ask who it is that is in danger. The cup begins to spell out Susan's name. The drop the seance and head out into a boat (since the house is by a river). Nancy arrives at the house, knowing Susan is there. As she enters the hosue, Susan comes into the house, soaked from head to toe. Nancy tries to get Susan's attention, but Susan will not answer. She only turns to her mother once, smiles, and then heads up to her room. She tries to get Susan to unlock the door, be she won't open the door. At that moment, John drives up with a couple bags of groceries. He finds Lisa and her friends pulling someone out of the water. He runs over and finds that is...Susan being pulled out of the water. Susan had mysteriously fallen out of the boat and into the water and drowned. What Nancy saw was Susan's ghost, which is now being taken over by the house's evil. Nancy refuses to believe all this, which is her reason for not going to her own daughter's funeral.John knows something is in the house. He has his team of supernatural investigators come to the house and set up. The team is lead by ELLIOT WEST (played by Robert Joy). They find that the evil is in the well, located in the basement. Nancy is in Susan's room, where she hears Susan's voice, where a blue figure appears, and leads Nancy down into the basement. The evil comes out and pretty much kills off everybody in the house, except for John and Nancy, who escape the house, safely, where the house then explodes.This was not the best and scariest installment to the whole series, but there are five other films to be included in this whol franchise.

At ease, my friend: you've found the right horror flick in ""Amityville 3 in 3-D"", occasionally subtitled ""The Demon"". If you've pressed on through the series, then you may as well don your battle armor and go hand-to-claw with the vicious undead, if only to see a very young Meg Ryan with a ouija board.This half-hearted 1983 follow-up to its degenerate 1982 predecessor isn't half the monster ""Amityville 2"" is, but it's amusing if you're drunk or bored or busy, and it will put you in the Halloween spirit, guaranteed---and unlike ""Amityville 2"", it won't make you feel guilty for watching it afterward. Numero 3 in the trilogy of the nasty Long Island real-estate bargain introduces us to ghost-buster John Baxter (played by Woody Allen regular Tony Roberts, who plays along but still seems baffled to be here), who picks up that wicked colonial by the sea for a song after busting a fraudulent seance-ring (yeah, they were grasping by the time #3 came along). Despite the misgivings of colleague and sometime sweetie Melanie (Candy Clark, who lends dignity to the proceedings), Baxter buys the house lock stock & smoking barrel, despite the fact that the over-eager real estate agent dies soon after the deal is consummated, evidently from fly asphyxiation. Hey, if it's a steal on the East Coast---with a boat dock and a pool house, by God----you've gotta move on it!Surprisingly, soon after demonic possession and other creepy shenanigans ensue, with innocent daughter Susan (Lori Laughlin, a bore but doing what she was paid to do) paying the price and a very young Meg Ryan (Lisa) getting to enjoy the ride. Will you enjoy it? If you're easily amused (like I am) and can be bribed with a bug-eyed gollum-esque demon, a nasty incineration death, and a spooky well/porthole-to-hell, then you'll be in good hands. And let's face it: director Richard Fleischer is an old Hollywood hand, a steely-eyed veteran director, who knows what he's doing---for Crom's sake, he directed ""Soylent Green"", ""Doctor Dolittle"", and ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea""---this guy is the Winston Churchill of Directors! Trust him! Ultimately, though, Fleischer was in his autumn years, and after this flick he was lucky to helm ""Red Sonja"" and ""Conan the Destroyer"". I'm not kidding.When it comes right down to it, where the rubber meets the road, ""Amityville 3: The Demon"" is a decent little horror movie, and will certainly occupy you (occasionally) while you double check the tax forms. Best of all, you can go on a munchies run and not miss much. Ah true, there's a ghoulish, shivery little sequence where Tony Roberts dreams his daughter is confined as a demonic mermaid in the well beneath the house, and that's shivery---truly, nightmarishly shivery. And did I mention ""Amityville 3"" is a shameless rip-off, particularly when it comes to lighting, of the far superior ""Poltergeist""? If you know these things going in, though, you should enjoy yourself.And more than anything, you'll know this: if the real estate agent promises something that sounds too good to be true, it's probably demon-possessed.",2,Home (un)Improvement,1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,3224,"['ever', 'want', 'have', 'little', 'Halloween', 'cheer', ""'re"", 'absolutely', 'pressed', 'get', 'house', 'tidied', 'up', 'wash', 'dishes', 'do', 'taxes', 'ease', 'friend', ""'ve"", 'found', 'right', 'horror', 'flick', 'Amityville', '3', '3-D', 'occasionally', 'subtitled', 'Demon', ""'ve"", 'pressed', 'series', 'then', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'don', 'battle', 'armor', 'go', 'hand-to-claw', 'vicious', 'undead', 'only', 'see', 'very', 'young', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'ouija', 'board.This', 'half-hearted', '1983', 'follow-up', 'degenerate', '1982', 'predecessor', ""n't"", 'monster', 'Amityville', '2', 'amusing', ""'re"", 'drunk', 'bored', 'busy', 'will', 'put', 'Halloween', 'spirit', 'guaranteed', '-and', 'Amityville', '2', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'guilty', 'watching', 'afterward', 'Numero', '3', 'trilogy', 'nasty', 'Long', 'Island', 'real-estate', 'bargain', 'introduces', 'ghost-buster', 'John', 'Baxter', 'played', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'regular', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'who', 'along', 'still', 'baffled', 'be', 'here', 'who', 'up', 'wicked', 'colonial', 'sea', 'song', 'busting', 'fraudulent', 'seance-ring', 'yeah', 'were', 'grasping', 'time', '3', 'came', 'along', 'misgivings', 'colleague', 'sometime', 'sweetie', 'Melanie', 'Candy', 'Clark', 'who', 'dignity', 'proceedings', 'Baxter', 'house', 'lock', 'stock', 'smoking', 'barrel', 'fact', 'over-eager', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'dies', 'soon', 'deal', 'consummated', 'evidently', 'fly', 'asphyxiation', 'Hey', 'steal', 'East', 'Coast', '-with', 'boat', 'dock', 'pool', 'house', 'God', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'move', 'Surprisingly', 'soon', 'demonic', 'possession', 'other', 'creepy', 'shenanigans', 'ensue', 'innocent', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Lori', 'Laughlin', 'bore', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'paid', 'do', 'paying', 'price', 'very', 'young', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Lisa', 'getting', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'Will', 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'easily', 'amused', 'am', 'can', 'be', 'bribed', 'bug-eyed', 'gollum-esque', 'demon', 'nasty', 'incineration', 'death', 'spooky', 'well/porthole-to-hell', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'good', 'hands', 'let', 'face', 'director', 'Richard', 'Fleischer', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'hand', 'steely-eyed', 'veteran', 'director', 'who', 'what', 'doing', 'Crom', 'sake', 'directed', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'Doctor', 'Dolittle', '20,000', 'Leagues', 'Sea', '-this', 'guy', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Directors', 'Trust', 'Ultimately', 'Fleischer', 'was', 'autumn', 'years', 'flick', 'was', 'lucky', 'helm', 'Red', 'Sonja', 'Conan', 'Destroyer', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding.When', 'right', 'down', 'where', 'rubber', 'road', 'Amityville', '3', 'Demon', 'decent', 'little', 'horror', 'movie', 'will', 'certainly', 'occupy', 'occasionally', 'double', 'check', 'tax', 'forms', 'Best', 'can', 'go', 'munchies', 'run', 'not', 'miss', 'much', 'Ah', 'true', 'ghoulish', 'shivery', 'little', 'sequence', 'where', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'daughter', 'confined', 'demonic', 'mermaid', 'well', 'house', 'shivery', '-truly', 'nightmarishly', 'shivery', 'did', 'mention', 'Amityville', '3', 'shameless', 'rip-off', 'particularly', 'when', 'lighting', 'far', 'superior', 'Poltergeist', 'know', 'things', 'going', 'should', 'enjoy', 'yourself.And', 'more', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'know', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'something', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'probably', 'demon-possessed']",N/A

344986,A97Q71MM5N4NW,6302909058,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[2, 3]","After seeing the Amityville horror (both 1979 and 2005, which I both extremely liked) I did a whole bunch of research, and have come to know the whole story of the true amityville horror. For one, let me just point out, there was no pit to hell in the basement (though that would've been cool, I think). It's a trademark the amityville series has kept for the interest of fans. There was a red room like in the first film, but no gateway to hell.Since I know so much about the true story, I figured I could skip Amityville II (which was based on the Defeo murders, but changed the last name to Monetelli) and go directly to Amityville 3-D, and it seemed to add a new interest since this one was fictional, not compared to the first two, which were true. I knew it wasn't released on 3-D, but it was rated PG which was a thumb up for me since I'm still only 15. Plus, I wondered how they could possibly get a PG rating for the amityville series, which has since all been rated R.When John Baxter (Tony Roberts trying his best), a skeptical reporter, buys the amityville house after disproving a fake seance being held there, things begin to happen; bad things. His reporting photographer, Melanie (the awesome and beautiful Candy Clark) finds that the well in the basement may very well be the pit to hell it's said to be. Afraid to go to the house again, she finds there's a demon in the basement, but soon meets an awful fate.Jonh's daughter Susan suddenly dies because of the hous's demon, which seems to follow people around after they enter the house, and his perfectly sane ex-wife, Nancy, seems to be going crazy because she claims she saw Susan even after her death, and now refuses to leave the house. It seems the only way to get rid of the demon is to find the source, and that may be by going straight down to the pit to hell, and confronting satan himself.The film's ending gave a good climax to a worn-out series. It sort of resolved the whole problem of the house continuing to kill people, but throughout the whole thing, the Lutz's story was never mentioned, as if it never happened, and the Defeo story is barely mentioned either, which should've been Monetelli since Amityville II had them named that, but hey, it wasn't an official sequel anyway. I think it was supposed to branch off of the others all by itself.The only really good acting done was by Candy Clark, who gives it all her best, and is perfect for the part of the convincing Melanie, who is suddenly attacked by the house. You feel so sorry for her, especially when she's burned alive inside her own car, and there's no way for her to escape. It makes you want to hate the house, and it's demon. I almost started cheering when the house self-destructs at the end. Obviously, MGM wanted to resolve the series, and give it a cliimatic end to the infamous, but other companies just couldn't take the hint, and had to exploit the house for all it was worth. I don't care to take the series any further than what MGM's done very well, even with 3-D.",4,Would be a lot better if they release it in 3-D,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,3027,"['seeing', 'Amityville', 'horror', '1979', '2005', 'extremely', 'liked', 'did', 'whole', 'bunch', 'research', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'whole', 'story', 'true', 'amityville', 'horror', 'one', 'let', 'just', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'pit', 'hell', 'basement', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cool', 'think', 'trademark', 'amityville', 'series', 'kept', 'interest', 'fans', 'was', 'red', 'room', 'first', 'film', 'gateway', 'hell.Since', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'true', 'story', 'figured', 'could', 'skip', 'Amityville', 'II', 'was', 'based', 'Defeo', 'murders', 'changed', 'last', 'name', 'Monetelli', 'go', 'directly', 'Amityville', '3-D', 'seemed', 'add', 'new', 'interest', 'one', 'was', 'fictional', 'not', 'compared', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'true', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', '3-D', 'was', 'rated', 'PG', 'was', 'thumb', 'up', ""'m"", 'still', 'only', '15', 'wondered', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'get', 'PG', 'rating', 'amityville', 'series', 'been', 'rated', 'R.When', 'John', 'Baxter', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'trying', 'best', 'skeptical', 'reporter', 'amityville', 'house', 'disproving', 'fake', 'seance', 'being', 'held', 'there', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'bad', 'things', 'reporting', 'photographer', 'Melanie', 'awesome', 'beautiful', 'Candy', 'Clark', 'well', 'basement', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'pit', 'hell', 'said', 'be', 'Afraid', 'go', 'house', 'again', 'demon', 'basement', 'soon', 'meets', 'awful', 'fate.Jonh', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'suddenly', 'hous', 'demon', 'follow', 'people', 'enter', 'house', 'perfectly', 'sane', 'ex-wife', 'Nancy', 'be', 'going', 'crazy', 'saw', 'Susan', 'even', 'death', 'now', 'leave', 'house', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'rid', 'demon', 'find', 'source', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'straight', 'down', 'pit', 'hell', 'confronting', 'satan', 'himself.The', 'film', 'ending', 'gave', 'good', 'climax', 'worn-out', 'series', 'sort', 'resolved', 'whole', 'problem', 'house', 'continuing', 'kill', 'people', 'whole', 'thing', 'Lutz', 'story', 'was', 'never', 'mentioned', 'never', 'happened', 'Defeo', 'story', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'either', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Monetelli', 'Amityville', 'II', 'had', 'named', 'hey', 'was', ""n't"", 'official', 'sequel', 'anyway', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'branch', 'others', 'itself.The', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'done', 'was', 'Candy', 'Clark', 'who', 'best', 'perfect', 'part', 'convincing', 'Melanie', 'who', 'suddenly', 'attacked', 'house', 'feel', 'so', 'sorry', 'especially', 'when', 'burned', 'alive', 'own', 'car', 'way', 'escape', 'want', 'hate', 'house', 'demon', 'almost', 'started', 'cheering', 'when', 'house', 'self-destructs', 'end', 'Obviously', 'MGM', 'wanted', 'resolve', 'series', 'give', 'cliimatic', 'end', 'infamous', 'other', 'companies', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'hint', 'had', 'exploit', 'house', 'was', 'worth', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'take', 'series', 'further', 'what', 'MGM', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'even', '3-D']",N/A

There is no question that ""Amityville 3"" is not nearly as good as ""Amityville II: The Possession"", but the movie picks up the haunted house theme quite well and provides the viewer with a nice little horror movie experience.In ""Amityville 3"", Tony Roberts stars as an agnostic journalist who unwittingly decides to purchase the Amityville house and live in it notwithstanding the house's dark history.  Roberts' character does not believe in the house, but the Amityville house will make a believer out of Roberts' character by the end of the movie.  Clearly, it is Roberts' character's disbelief versus the evil that resides in the Amityville house that drives this film.  Roberts' character must pay a hefty price for his naivety and close-mindedness.""Amityville 3"" a/k/a ""Amityville: The Demon"" solidifies the idea that something evil resides deep within the Amityville house, and presents this theme to the audience quite effectively.  In fact, ""Amityville 3"" seems to pick up on the idea developed by ""Amityville II: The Possession"" that a demon actually dwells within the Amityville house walls which obviously is a ""pathway to hell"", perhaps the same demon that possessed Sonny in part two of this series.  At any rate, Roberts' character confronts the Amityville house head on and bad things start to happen, and people start to die as well.  Can Roberts' character stop the evil from inside the Amityville house before its too late?  Will Roberts' character realize the evil that lurks within the basement of the Amityville house before he loses everything?""Amityville 3"" is no classic by any stretch of the imagination, but this movie stays within itself and does not try to do too much as the creepy atmosphere, some unexplained horrible deaths and the reputation of the Amityville house itself are quite enough to keep a serious horror movie fan interested.  One thing that is characteristic of the Amityville house is its evil essence which only works to propel the action and suspense of ""Amityville 3"".  The only criticisms with this movie are with regard to the acting which is average for this type of flick and the ending which I did not like as I thought it was rather unimaginative and cliche-esque for lack of a better term, but, nevertheless, the viewer should be free to draw his own conclusions and opinions regarding the ending of the film.  All and all, this is a solid horror flick (that with the right touch on the ending would have been very close to or right at a FOUR STAR horror film), and a worthy sequel which compares rather favorably to today's garbage that Hollywood calls ""horror movies"".",3,"3.5 STARS: Certainly not a great horror movie, but does not get the credit it deserves.",1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2997,"['brilliant', 'sequel', 'series', 'Amityville', '3', 'clearly', 'step', 'down', 'big', 'one', 'However', 'Amityville', '3', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'would', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'fact', 'Amityville', '3', 'important', 'level', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'fail', 'creating', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'conducive', 'good', 'movie', 'haunted', 'house', 'question', 'Amityville', '3', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Amityville', 'II', 'Possession', 'movie', 'up', 'haunted', 'house', 'theme', 'quite', 'well', 'viewer', 'nice', 'little', 'horror', 'movie', 'Amityville', '3', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'agnostic', 'journalist', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'purchase', 'Amityville', 'house', 'live', 'notwithstanding', 'house', 'dark', 'history', 'Roberts', 'character', 'not', 'believe', 'house', 'Amityville', 'house', 'will', 'make', 'believer', 'Roberts', 'character', 'end', 'movie', 'Clearly', 'Roberts', 'character', 'disbelief', 'evil', 'Amityville', 'house', 'film', 'Roberts', 'character', 'must', 'pay', 'hefty', 'price', 'naivety', 'close-mindedness', 'Amityville', '3', 'a/k/a', 'Amityville', 'Demon', 'idea', 'something', 'evil', 'resides', 'deep', 'Amityville', 'house', 'theme', 'audience', 'quite', 'effectively', 'fact', 'Amityville', '3', 'pick', 'up', 'idea', 'developed', 'Amityville', 'II', 'Possession', 'demon', 'actually', 'Amityville', 'house', 'walls', 'obviously', 'pathway', 'hell', 'perhaps', 'same', 'demon', 'possessed', 'Sonny', 'part', 'two', 'series', 'rate', 'Roberts', 'character', 'Amityville', 'house', 'head', 'bad', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'people', 'start', 'die', 'as', 'well', 'Can', 'Roberts', 'character', 'stop', 'evil', 'Amityville', 'house', 'too', 'late', 'Will', 'Roberts', 'character', 'realize', 'evil', 'basement', 'Amityville', 'house', 'everything', 'Amityville', '3', 'classic', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'movie', 'not', 'try', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'unexplained', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'reputation', 'Amityville', 'house', 'are', 'quite', 'enough', 'keep', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'interested', 'One', 'thing', 'characteristic', 'Amityville', 'house', 'evil', 'essence', 'only', 'propel', 'action', 'suspense', 'Amityville', '3', 'only', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'are', 'regard', 'acting', 'average', 'type', 'flick', 'ending', 'did', 'not', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'unimaginative', 'cliche-esque', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'nevertheless', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'opinions', 'regarding', 'ending', 'film', 'solid', 'horror', 'flick', 'right', 'touch', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'close', 'right', 'FOUR', 'STAR', 'horror', 'film', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'rather', 'favorably', 'today', 'garbage', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'movies']",N/A

A lot of people say this movie isn't scary, but it can easily make a 6th, 7th and 9th grader scream, especially on the part where Melanie (Candy Clark) finds the demon's face in her photograph before meeting her distrubing, uncalled-for demise. I mean seriously? Why the hell did the director make the most fragile character have the worst death? It should've been that freaking pompus-ass John Baxter (Tony Roberts) who never believed in the house (train wreck of an actor too). Lori Loughin (from Full House) plays John Baxter's daughter Susan and Tess Harper plays the divorced wife (who I mistook her and Candy Clark for the same person when I watched the VHS way back when). Meg Ryan appears as one of Lori's classmates; one of her earlier roles (she looks really young) and Robert Joy is also in this, playing the ""mad-scientist"" character (he was also in the new 2006 version of ""Hills have Eyes"").Don't take this movie seriously because the effects are bad. You can see this just by looking at the Opening montage when the crew members whack a tree branch at the camera and trips because he was eating a donut, ha-ha, very funny.

So, therefore none of the amityville movies after part two are really sequels considering a sequel continues directly an ongoing story and none of these do.I give this movie 3 stars even though I have never watched the entire thing in one sitting because it was rather lame, but it was somewhat inventive and I could tell that a lot of it would be better in it's original 3D format in the theaters, rather than on video.",3,listen up!,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,1132,"['actually', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'sequel', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'just', '3D', 'movie', 'put', 'new', 'spin', 'Amityville', 'story', 'was', 'named', 'Amityville', '3', 'Europe', 'over', 'seas', 'distributer', 'cash', 'n', 'amityville', 'series', 'name', 'Just', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'movie', 'Zombie', 'was', 'named', 'Zombie', '2', 'Europe', 'Dawn', 'dead', 'had', 'been', 'named', 'zombie', 'there', 'distributers', 'tried', 'cash', 'enormous', 'success', 'was.Anyway', 'Amityville', '3D', 'was', 'eventually', 'taken', 'consideration', 'part', 'series', 'later', 'when', 'made', 'amityville', '4', 'movie', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'series', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'separate', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'Amityville', 'house', 'So', 'none', 'amityville', 'movies', 'part', 'two', 'are', 'really', 'sequels', 'considering', 'sequel', 'directly', 'ongoing', 'story', 'none', 'do.I', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'even', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'entire', 'thing', 'one', 'sitting', 'was', 'rather', 'lame', 'was', 'somewhat', 'inventive', 'could', 'tell', 'lot', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'original', '3D', 'format', 'theaters', 'rather', 'video']",N/A

The scene where Meg Ryan says ""whoo ooo"" into the well (supposed gate to hell) in the basement, and a voice moans back  from the well is chill inducing.

It is actually more creepy then all the others because of the bug eyed monster and my favorite the ghost of Susan! Ok down to business: 5 out of 5 stars. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The movie starts out with a woman, Melanie and her ""husband"" John. They go to the infamous Long Island house to attend a sceance by an elderly couple. Melanie and John reference that they had a little boy and he died some five years ago. During the sceance they see a greenish light. Melanie jumps up and starts taking photos and it is discovered that the elderly couple were scamming them all along. John knows about the house's troubled history and he was there with Melanie doing an article for their ghost magazine. John seems interested in buying the house so he sets up an appoitment and goes to see it. The man selling it is Clifford Sanders and tells John the reason why it's so cheap is because of the history and how he can't even ""unload"" (sell) any of the houses next to it. Since it was a cheap investment and he needs more space he moves into it. When he goes to show it to his daughter Susan, so she can pick out a room for herself when she isn't with her mother who refuses to set foot on the property they find Mr. Sanders dead and some flys around him. (remember those things from part 1&2?) A few days later Susan brings her best friend Lisa to the house because Lisa is a ghost fanatic. They talk about the house and decide to set up their own sceance using a makeshift Ouija board and bring some others over. Lisa asks the question ""Is anyone in this room in any danger?"" and the glass their using moves to ""yes"" and the glass is mysteriously thrown against the floor. Since there are a bunch of people there they decide to go boating since there is a bulkhead in the back and a boat. When John gets home there is an ambulance there and it seems that Susan hit her head and fell off the boat. He tells his wife (who's now going on the property) who was inside and she doesn't believe him because she just saw a waterlogged Susan slowly drift into an upstairs room. John just thinks that she is just too upset to accept the fact that she is dead. Meanwhile, Melanie took some photos of the property with John while with Sanders and discovers that the photos are messed up. But they are only messed up around where the image of Sanders is. She takes a magnifying glass and it reveals an evil looking snake under his eye. She gets in her car and drives to the house when she is in a terrible car accident where she is burned alive! After John has many many MANY strange occurences from the house he decides to bring in Dr. Elliot West and a group of scientists to probe the house (like on POLTERGEIST) and discovers that there is an evil being living under the house in a well. (SPOILERS!) When he finds out the house goes awry, dragging Dr. Elliot down to Hell and makes the house explode. Everyone else is safe.

Now, I understand that Part 3s must be an awful thing for a director to sign on for.  Inheriting an film series must be pretty tough, and by the time you get to a Part 3 of something, you're most likely gonna be going over ground covered before...and covered better at that.  And in dealing with a series that involves a haunted house, your options are quite limited.  I mean really, what can you do?  Well, why not do it in 3-D?  That's really the only thing this movie has going for it, and it's not even available on this dvd.  I don't mind a plot being rehashed(if I did, I certainly wouldn't own the Friday The 13th box set), but if you're gonna do it, you should at least put some flair in it.  In this film, Woody Allen regular Tony Roberts plays a reporter who likes to expose fake psychics and hauntings.  This is to assure us that we're really dealing with skeptical man who's gonna be tough to break.  He winds up buying the Amityville house coz it's cheap, available and no one wants it(kinda like alot of chicks I've dated).  After he's moved in, we get the usual Amityville shenanigans, but without any creepiness or zip.  Hell, even if it were so bad it was funny, at least that could be something worthwhile.  Problem is, it's just bad, period.  Boring too.  This time around, the house actually attacks people and kills them.  This is a first in the series(possessing the kid in part 2 doesn't count).  Plus, it seems to be able to kill people away from the house.  How about them apples?  There are a few decent scenes that spark a bit of hope, but it's all too little, too late.  A ghostly apparition of Lori Loughlin(remember?  Uncle Jessie's chick from Full House?) walking through the house while she actually lies dying outside is okay.  And the grand finale where a rubber demon jumps out of the glowing well in the basement and spits fire into Robert Joy's face is a bit of silly fun(the demon is the coolest thing in the movie and you see it for about 4 seconds).  Joy's scream is priceless.  Plus, I do remember the old vhs box for this film having a cool looking cover with a demon hand coming out at you from the house.  Otherwise, you'd do well to leave this one alone.  Unless you're a hardcore Tony Roberts fan, that is, and who isn't?  Still I'd think about it.",2,It's In 3-D!!!

The third film, Originally titled ""Amityville III the Demon"" didn't really have much to live up to as the first two films were pretty awful.It starts with the premise of John Baxter (Tony Roberts) and Melanie (Candy Clark) as two investigative reporters fora magazine who come to the Amityville house in order to expose a scam run by two fraudulent psychics.  With their job done, Baxter actually decides to buy the home since the owner is selling the property so cheaply.  Roberts moves in with his daughter Susan (Lori Laughlin) and of course, strange things begin to happen.  Strange noises, doors turning up locked, not to mention the deaths of two people in accidents who recently visited the home.  Add to that photos taken come up with strange disfigurations on various faces which Baxter, the dummy, just passes off as a defect.  Doesn't he watch TV?From there we get the usual haunted house trappings including Susan and her friends (including a oyung Meg Ryan) playing with a Quija board, and teams of psychic investigators coming to the home with all of their equipment and finding what any dimwit could have told you without thousands of dollars in electronics...the House is haunted...Get the Hell out!The film was originally done in 3D which was fairly lame when you saw it in theaters and absolutely stupid when you view it on VHS or DVD with the ""subtle"" objects flying straight out at your face.
