When you hear men on TV Shows talk about how great it would be to have a threesome I thought, &quot;oh great, another Springer moment&quot;; however, this movie is just the opposite. I saw this movie as an educational experience. Sure, some people may find being with two people as erotic (and time consuming), but they never think about what may happen after that one-night of carefree sex has been committed. Would you find the experience exciting or just another note to chalk up on your &quot;I've learned from my mistakes, and I'll never do that again&quot; list? This is a must see movie for anyone who doesn't take the time to answer that one question that lingers in the back of our minds, &quot;What will happen once it's all said and done&quot;?

558838,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004YA27,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 8]","""Trois"" aspires to the feel of soft-core porn, albeit without the sort of explicit nudity that devotes of the genre would hope to see.  It also wants to be something of a thriller, which is another major regard in which this 2000 film fails, because I pretty much saw everything coming and it is hard to be shocked when you are not surprised.  But you know how it is; you see an interesting trailer, check out a movie, and wish you had stopped with the trailer.Jermaine Davis (Gary Dourdan) has a promising career as a lawyer and his wife Jasmine (Kenya Moore) has a great body.  But is Jermaine happy?  No he is not and because he is also stupid it is a dangerous combination.  Jermaine dreams of a m&eacute;nage-a-trois with his wife and another woman.  He does not have a specific woman in mind, but one of his co-workers (Soloman K. Smith), knows of a woman who will fit the bill named Jade (Gretchen Palmer).  Apparently she fits the bill because her name begins with a ""J"" as well.  However, first Jermaine has to get Jasmine to agree.  His argument to persuade his wife to let another woman into their bed?  That there is nothing they should not be able to experience and that he is only trying to take their relationship to the next level.Now, think about this particular line of argument without all the blood rushing to certain parts of the body and if you were Jasmine you would have to be very afraid.  How many levels does her husband want to take her to and how long does it take you to come up with a long list of things that she would not want to experience?  When Jasmine confides to a friend that this is what her husband wants to do, her friend admits that she did something similar once upon a time and now has to fight off her husband's desire to do something ""worse.""  Not long afterwards, Jasmine agrees to do what Jermaine wants.  There are many possible reasons why she agrees, but the most important one is clearly that the movie has to fulfill the promise of its title.So it happens.  ""Trois"" does not dwell on the big moment; you have a sense for what they are doing and it appears the experience is not solely for Jermaine's benefit, so the ambiguity of the moment is preserved.  But then the three of them have to live with it, and that proves to be more difficult than any of them would have thought.  Both Jermaine and Jasmine are worried that the other one is still seeing Jade, but that is before weird things start happening and we get to the ""Fatal Attraction"" part of the proceedings.That development is going to be unexpected by many viewers and it certainly raises some interesting questions about the moral lesson to be drawn from the story.  The filmmakers here are only working with a budget of $200,000 and while the production values reflect the skimpy budget they are trying for something more complicated in terms of the story.  But the script, direction, and acting are all barely competent and despite the lurid subject matter the whole thing is just way too tame.  You can get some good laughs out of this film, but you know that was not the intent of this film, which does try to deal with some serious subjects.If the characters are not stereotypical, which is certainly a debatable point, the relationships certainly are.  The most sympathetic character is Jade, but the fact that she demands $1000 from Jermaine so that she can pay for her lawyer in a custody fight over her son pretty much shows how twisted things get in this film.  Jasmine does things she knows are wrong and then wonders why it is destroying her marriage while Jermaine is just too stupid to see that he is destroying his marriage before, during, or after it happens.  In the end I just wish that in addition to this being a better movie that the moral of ""Trois"" was something more proscriptive.",3,A sexual thriller that fails on both parts of the equation,1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,3820,"['Trois', 'aspires', 'feel', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'sort', 'explicit', 'nudity', 'genre', 'would', 'hope', 'see', 'also', 'be', 'something', 'thriller', 'major', 'regard', '2000', 'film', 'fails', 'pretty', 'much', 'saw', 'everything', 'coming', 'hard', 'be', 'shocked', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'know', 'how', 'see', 'interesting', 'trailer', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'wish', 'had', 'stopped', 'trailer.Jermaine', 'Davis', 'Gary', 'Dourdan', 'promising', 'career', 'lawyer', 'wife', 'Jasmine', 'Kenya', 'Moore', 'great', 'body', 'Jermaine', 'happy', 'not', 'also', 'stupid', 'dangerous', 'combination', 'Jermaine', 'dreams', 'm', 'eacute', 'nage-a-trois', 'wife', 'woman', 'not', 'have', 'specific', 'woman', 'mind', 'one', 'co-workers', 'Soloman', 'K.', 'Smith', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'fit', 'bill', 'named', 'Jade', 'Gretchen', 'Palmer', 'Apparently', 'bill', 'name', 'J', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'first', 'Jermaine', 'get', 'Jasmine', 'agree', 'argument', 'persuade', 'wife', 'let', 'woman', 'bed', 'nothing', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'experience', 'only', 'trying', 'take', 'relationship', 'next', 'level.Now', 'think', 'particular', 'line', 'argument', 'blood', 'rushing', 'certain', 'parts', 'body', 'were', 'Jasmine', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'afraid', 'How', 'many', 'levels', 'husband', 'want', 'take', 'how', 'long', 'take', 'come', 'up', 'long', 'list', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'experience', 'When', 'Jasmine', 'friend', 'what', 'husband', 'do', 'friend', 'did', 'something', 'similar', 'once', 'time', 'now', 'fight', 'off', 'husband', 'desire', 'do', 'something', 'worse', 'Not', 'long', 'afterwards', 'Jasmine', 'do', 'what', 'Jermaine', 'are', 'many', 'possible', 'reasons', 'why', 'most', 'important', 'one', 'clearly', 'movie', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'title.So', 'Trois', 'not', 'dwell', 'big', 'moment', 'have', 'sense', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'experience', 'not', 'solely', 'Jermaine', 'benefit', 'ambiguity', 'moment', 'preserved', 'then', 'three', 'have', 'live', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Jermaine', 'Jasmine', 'are', 'worried', 'other', 'one', 'still', 'seeing', 'Jade', 'weird', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'get', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'part', 'proceedings.That', 'development', 'going', 'be', 'unexpected', 'many', 'viewers', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'questions', 'moral', 'lesson', 'be', 'drawn', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'here', 'are', 'only', 'working', 'budget', '200,000', 'production', 'values', 'reflect', 'skimpy', 'budget', 'are', 'trying', 'something', 'more', 'complicated', 'terms', 'story', 'script', 'direction', 'acting', 'are', 'barely', 'competent', 'lurid', 'subject', 'matter', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'tame', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'laughs', 'film', 'know', 'was', 'not', 'intent', 'film', 'try', 'deal', 'serious', 'subjects.If', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'certainly', 'debatable', 'point', 'relationships', 'certainly', 'are', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Jade', 'fact', '1000', 'Jermaine', 'can', 'pay', 'lawyer', 'custody', 'fight', 'son', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'twisted', 'things', 'get', 'film', 'Jasmine', 'things', 'are', 'wrong', 'then', 'wonders', 'why', 'destroying', 'marriage', 'Jermaine', 'just', 'too', 'stupid', 'see', 'destroying', 'marriage', 'before', 'end', 'just', 'wish', 'addition', 'being', 'better', 'movie', 'moral', 'Trois', 'was', 'something', 'more', 'proscriptive']",N/A
