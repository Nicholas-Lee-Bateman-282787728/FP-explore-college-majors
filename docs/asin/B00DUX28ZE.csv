But, the person they had playing Sherlock was a total turnoff.  He was more on the fair haired side and more on the fair at best acting side too.  For us the man portraying Sherlock was a turnoff.  That and they constantly had Sherlock wearing the deerstalker hat.  BOOOO.  I think it is only twice that Sherlock worse a hat described as being able to come down over the ears (never calling it a deerstalker hat) but no one including Sherlock would wear this hat around the city. Strictly a country hat.

I have been reading Sherlock stories since age 10 and own every Sherlock Holmes book I've ever seen (some of them twice!).  One of my favorite Christmas gifts was a set published in the early 1900's.As I watched the show I realized how much he influenced my way of looking at things...no, I am not a detective of any kind, but I do analyze in ways that are singularly &#34;Holmesian&#34; - to the point that several boyfriends have asked if I were a private eye.  They seemed to take offense at things I noticed about their apartments or behavior!I cannot believe that someone complained about the actor and the wardrobe!  Of course, I am old enough to have Basil Rathbone as the image in my mind of what Holmes &#34;looks like&#34; - Peter Cushing also fit the description invented by Doyle...but so many actors have held the role that I am able to get beyond the looks and listen to the words...I loved that the various forensics professionals  kept referencing the Holmes ideas that led to today's innovations.

1661467,A22461W707BCBZ,B00DUX28ZE,Nicole W.,"[1, 1]","I have loved Sherlock Holmes for years. I was first introduced to him by watching the films with my dad on PBS and later started reading the stores by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (I can't make myself shorten his name-sorry).This series goes into the life of the author himself, the impact that he had on criminal investigation and how he is still inspiring forensic scientists today. They present case histories from the author's time right up until now. They go into details like the individual who was the inspiration behind the Great Detective and how Sir Arthur Conan Doyle finally came out of the shadow of his character to have other real-life impacts on the society of his time to today. They also show flashes of the Sherlock series on BBC and how they are presenting those deductions so that the viewers get them along with Sherlock.

He is as popular as ever.  But his lasting legacy is that, even today, he continues to solve crimes.""The above is said by the narrator at the end of this spectacularly interesting documentary that blends real-life forensic analysis with Sherlockian forensic analysis.I learned quite a bit from this documentary, not only about forensics but about Sherlock Holmes (and his alter ego, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 1859 to 1930).Using a combination of interviews (with forensic scientists, crime historians, Sherlock Holmes' experts, etc.), dramatic recreations, and archival footage (some in black and white), this documentary explains the impact and legacy of the most famous fictional crime fighter in history.Here are some of the chapters found in this documentary:(1) Jack the Ripper(2) Deductive reasoning(3) Blood evidence(4) Bullets and ballistics(5) The science of poisoning(6) Fingerprints and fakes(7) The art of tracing footstepsFinally, what I especially liked about this documentary is the use of real high-profile murder cases with footage of the real crime scenes.In conclusion, not only is this an instructional documentary on forensics, it is an entertaining one as well.
