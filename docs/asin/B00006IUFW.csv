It just happened to be the one showing at that particular time slot.  When I walked into the theater, I only saw about a handful of people.  So Joshua is the name of a guy who arrives at a small town as a carpenter/sculptor of sorts.  He helps the people living in that small town realize what it means to be a community through the rebuilding of a Baptist church that was destroyed in a storm.  At the heart of the conflict is a Catholic priest that thinks Joshua is starting some kind of cult.The story plods along fine until the last few minutes where the story throws the audience a whammy.

The idea behind the story is that Jesus has returned to earth to help his people find their way and teach them how to love again. I read the book many years ago, along with Girzone's other Joshua books. My husband purchased Joshua, the movie, for me a few years ago as a Christmas gift.While the premise is basically the same, as is typical with book to movie projects, Joshua barely resembles the written story. The story was modernized a bit, so the residents of Auburn now have cell phones, but overall filmmakers captured the charm of small town American well. I was less than thrilled, however, with certain aspects of the movie: the romantic feelings Joshua's appearance awaken in Maggie (though handled in a family friendly way); having Joshua make a statue of Peter for the Catholic church instead of a statue of Moses for the synagogue (book); and the divisive relationship between Father Pat and Father Tardone.Part of the appeal of the book, is that Jesus comes back and reaches out to all people, just like he did during his first time on earth. By having the movie focus on the Catholic church and Joshua helping rebuild a Baptist church that was destroyed by a storm, they remove the powerful element of Joshua reaching out to the Jews, which was a big part of the book. They make a point to mention there is a Jewish person in Auburn, but it's a humorous moment where this man enters the Catholic confessional to tell Father Tardone about one of Joshua's miracles.Maggie's interest in Joshua, while depicted purely, adds nothing to the film. Perhaps they were going for a modern-day Mary Magdalene--as some people believe she saw the Lord as something more than a teacher--by portraying the character this way, but I felt it fell flat.While the book did have the religious leaders of Auburn confronting Joshua about his motives, the man steering the destroy Joshua committee is Father Tardone. He preaches more about fear of God, than about God's love. At one point, Father Tardone invites Joshua to Mass, where he proceeds to give a sermon on how you cannot hide your sins from God. They exchange words after the service, and it's obvious they have a different version of who God is and the message he gives to us through his Word. I also didn't like to see Father Pat placed at such odds with is superior or the way they made Father Pat to be more awkward and unsure of himself.It is the moving scenes when Joshua interacts with certain people that save this movie. Joshua and the blind woman at the revival meeting; Joshua and Theo after his accident; Joshua and Father Tardone in Rome (where Joshua has been called to be interviewed by the cardinal about his actions); and the tear-jerking scene between Joshua and the Pope.Despite its departure from the book, Joshua is filled with many talented actors who perform well with the material they were handed. I also feel, the message of God's love shines through.",3,Decent Movie of a Fabulous Book,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,3013,"['2002', 'movie', 'based', 'Joseph', 'Girzone', 'novel', 'Joshua', 'Parable', 'Today', 'idea', 'story', 'Jesus', 'returned', 'earth', 'help', 'people', 'find', 'way', 'teach', 'how', 'love', 'again', 'read', 'book', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Girzone', 'other', 'Joshua', 'books', 'husband', 'purchased', 'Joshua', 'movie', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Christmas', 'gift.While', 'premise', 'basically', 'same', 'typical', 'book', 'movie', 'projects', 'Joshua', 'barely', 'written', 'story', 'story', 'was', 'modernized', 'bit', 'residents', 'Auburn', 'now', 'have', 'cell', 'phones', 'overall', 'filmmakers', 'captured', 'charm', 'small', 'town', 'American', 'well', 'was', 'less', 'thrilled', 'however', 'certain', 'aspects', 'movie', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'Joshua', 'appearance', 'awaken', 'Maggie', 'handled', 'family', 'friendly', 'way', 'having', 'Joshua', 'make', 'statue', 'Peter', 'Catholic', 'church', 'instead', 'statue', 'Moses', 'synagogue', 'book', 'divisive', 'relationship', 'Father', 'Pat', 'Father', 'Tardone.Part', 'appeal', 'book', 'Jesus', 'back', 'out', 'people', 'just', 'did', 'first', 'time', 'earth', 'having', 'movie', 'focus', 'Catholic', 'church', 'Joshua', 'helping', 'rebuild', 'Baptist', 'church', 'was', 'destroyed', 'storm', 'remove', 'powerful', 'element', 'Joshua', 'reaching', 'out', 'Jews', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'book', 'make', 'point', 'mention', 'Jewish', 'person', 'Auburn', 'humorous', 'moment', 'where', 'man', 'Catholic', 'confessional', 'tell', 'Father', 'Tardone', 'one', 'Joshua', 'miracles.Maggie', 'interest', 'Joshua', 'depicted', 'purely', 'nothing', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'going', 'modern-day', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'people', 'believe', 'saw', 'Lord', 'something', 'more', 'teacher', 'portraying', 'character', 'way', 'felt', 'fell', 'flat.While', 'book', 'did', 'have', 'religious', 'leaders', 'Auburn', 'confronting', 'Joshua', 'motives', 'man', 'steering', 'destroy', 'Joshua', 'committee', 'Father', 'Tardone', 'more', 'fear', 'God', 'God', 'love', 'one', 'point', 'Father', 'Tardone', 'Joshua', 'Mass', 'where', 'give', 'sermon', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'sins', 'God', 'exchange', 'words', 'service', 'obvious', 'have', 'different', 'version', 'who', 'God', 'message', 'Word', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'Father', 'Pat', 'placed', 'such', 'odds', 'superior', 'way', 'made', 'Father', 'Pat', 'be', 'more', 'awkward', 'unsure', 'himself.It', 'moving', 'scenes', 'when', 'Joshua', 'certain', 'people', 'save', 'movie', 'Joshua', 'blind', 'woman', 'revival', 'meeting', 'Joshua', 'Theo', 'accident', 'Joshua', 'Father', 'Tardone', 'Rome', 'where', 'Joshua', 'been', 'called', 'be', 'interviewed', 'cardinal', 'actions', 'tear-jerking', 'scene', 'Joshua', 'Pope.Despite', 'departure', 'book', 'Joshua', 'filled', 'many', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'perform', 'well', 'material', 'were', 'handed', 'also', 'feel', 'message', 'God', 'love', 'shines']",N/A

716956,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B00006IUFW,Craig Connell,"[5, 5]","Now here is an honest-to-goodness Christian movie, based on the best-selling book in the mid '90s by Fr. Joseph Girzone. This parable, I would think, would be a lot more effective evangelizing film than The Passion Of The Christ, only because this is so much more pleasant to watch. But it is no watered-down version, either. While Mel Gibson's film shows Christ's love in the incredibly- painful sacrifice he made, this movie shows the nature of His love in ordinary, everyday life with ordinary people.This is a not a Second Coming story, rather just what Jesus might be like if he re-appeared and mingled with human beings today, in this case in a small southern town in the United States.Here, ""Joshua"" (Tony Goldwyn) is pictured helping a diverse group of townspeople, ministering to them individually and helping them to come together as a community. He isn't arrogant or pushy about it; he just leads by example. A sub-plot involves his influence with two local priests: an older skeptical pharisee-like cleric (F.

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[10, 11]","This movie adaptation of Father Girzone's book wonderfully compells the viewer to sit back and be fascinated by a modern day Christ story.Joshua, an artist and woodcarver, drifts into a small town and within days turns a disjointed group of citizens into a community of good neighbors.  Joshua's manner is straightforward, kind, yet fun and amusing---just the kind of guy you'd want at your next get-together.  He doesn't preach---he simply is---his love and selflessness runs out from him like cool fresh water to the thirsty.  His actions are transforming---but alas, they also cause trouble.  The pastor of the local church is frightened by Joshua's charisma and he does his worst to disassemble the band of neighbors by attempting to blacken Joshua's name.The movie is not as complicated as the novel, the scenes where Joshua is asked to speak at the nearby Jewish Synagogue are completely eliminated as is Girzone's hopeful message of all roads--all houses of worship--leading to the same goal rather than insisting that their way is the only way.  The dialogue at times can be a little too persuasive in attempting to disclose the true nature of Joshua--which the audience identifies correctly from the start anyway.I was disappointed that more attention was not paid to Joshua's exquisite carvings----only one of the statues of Peter is manifested here.Of note is F.

It is that scary. Joshus is a 9 year old evil genius, and when I say evil, I really mean 'The Devil incarnate', and that may be a gross understatement. The action is in the Big Apple sans Twin Towers, and lots of shots of Central Park, and the radio controlled sailing boats, which Joshua, sailing no. 61, loves to use, to threaten & terrorise the innocent ducks. His list of spiteful, hateful crimes is almost endless. Murdering his Grandma aka 'Nunu' by pushing her down the steep stairs of the Broklyn Museum of Art, driving his mother insane, so she has to be admitted to the Sunshine Hills sanatorium, goading his father to beat him up publically in Central Park by the fountain, and self inflicting bruises on his own back to frame his dear old Dad for child abuse, attempted murder of his adorable, lovable baby sister, Lily, tampering with his mother's tranquilisers, etc. And Joshua does all this with a deadpan, suave and falsely innocent expression, just like butter would not melt in his mouth. A masterpiece of casting is the selection of the child actor to play Joshua. His father, Brad Cairn is a great guy. I feel for him. He does his best to deal with an alien situation which he never thought would ever happen to him. When Joshus klls his beloved golden retriever, Buster, with poison, his outpouring of grief made me wince and cringe. I love dogs, you see. Acting is almost flawless, with many hand held camera shots giving the perspective of the main protagonist in almost every crucial scene. Directing is superb too. Tight, with clever use of good angles and lighting add suspense and build up the excitement excruciatingly. I only wish there was a happy ending. I love happy endings. It's the romantic in me. This movie does for pro-parenthood groups what 'Marathon Man' (Dustin Hoffman) did for those who advocate regular visits to their Dental Surgeon.

He of course encounters the modern day charlatans and others who try to steer him off course, and to this end, the movie works fine.However, as it approached the end, I was greatly disappointed, in that now the Catholic Church has to get involved, and Joshua is hauled before the Pope to answer for his actions.  And then in unbelievable fashion, Joshua reveals himself as the Christ and expresses his displeasure in that very same Church for not being the true church which is supposed to preach His message.As pure entertainment, this might work fine, but don't take it seriously.

Murray Abraham) who suffers from perhaps that worst spiritual ailment of all: the pride of the Pharisee, the determination to at any cost make God's word (a ""love letter"" as Joshua puts it) a manifesto of fear and hatred.  The relationship between the man and Joshua form what is most important in the film, I think.  Purdy and Girzone handle it beautifully.While this isn't blood and guts scourging and ravens pecking out people's eyes (as in ""The Passion"" which had it's own merits despite the pitiable state of the director, this is a film that I would distribute to every Church youth group and to any Catholic interested in a relief from the dogmatism and fear binding spell so many ""ex-Catholics"" find themselves in unconscious fear of as a result of their conditioning.

You will either cry profusely and watch on your knees ( if your a Catholic I suppose, standing if a Protestant ) or get sick to your stomach 'cause you so dislike religion and religious faith in all it's incarnations ( or claimed incarnations ).Well, then there's me.  I get all emotional watching some ""Millenium"" episodes and occasionally have gotten temporarilly  ""lost"" laying staring up at the clear night sky with all the stars.  We don't want to be so alone in the universe.  We wonder at all the accidents over four billion years that resulted in US.  ( read my other reviews ie chaos theory, evolution etc ).Lately I've been thinkin that we may be the only such moderately intelligent lifeform now existing in the knowable universe.  What if?  The chain of accidents that led to our meager rationality......imagine an animal evolving that could look at the milky way and KNOW what it actually is.  And we've known for only such a short time.So, pardon me if I cried a lot watching this silly movie all alone.  Maybe I believe and maybe I don't.

Getting lost a bit here....and not even staring up at the depth of the night sky.  Clever primates we are.  So clever that we can't bear to be so alone in the universe as we find ourselves.

Like science fiction disbelief must be suspended for the effect to be appreciated.Could an intelligence encompass the entire universe at one moment and contol it as well?  And staring out at the dark night sky I always come to the ""wall"" of what is beyond?  What is beyond this place?  What place is our universe ""in"".  My mind is just too small.If I saw the man fall off the ladder as in this movie perhaps I could believe.  I wish I could.

Girzone's original text to appeal to a more mainstream group, but the actors, the producers and the directors of this film definitely got the message across.  Tony Goldwyn was exceptional as Joshua.  He brought out the humanity that Jesus had to have in order to reach the people He set out to save.  He understood that preachy evangalistic and overly religious zealots, more often than not, turned people away.  Hence, his ability to &quot;come down from the pedastal&quot; to talk WITH the people and not AT them.  THAT is what endears Him.  THAT is what will ultimately continue to bring people to Him.  And I think Joshua captures that wonderfully.  A simple message given in a wonderfully simple, but beautiful film.  You can break down the mechanics of the film all you want.  You can criticize the fundamentals of cinematography, and production and all the underlying basics that, supposedly, make films great.

He moves into a dilapidated old barn on the outside of town and when he finds a Baptist church that was destroyed in a storm, he starts working on fixing it up. This seems odd to the members of the congregation of that church, but some of them start to pitch in and help Joshua.There are no real surprises in &quot;Joshua,&quot; especially since the opening credits tell us that Giancarlo Giannini plays the Pope in the movie we are about to see. But the point of the story here is not to tell you anything you do not already know. The message, when Joshua actually articulates one, is the one that has been around for almost two thousand years. So the attraction here is the enticing &quot;what if?&quot; as to what it would be like if Jesus suddenly showed up in your neck of the woods and started doing things and talking to people. Joshua does not preach sermons nor does he tell parables. The important thing here is that when you talk, he listens to you.This is not the first time that a movie has tried to portray a more &quot;realistic&quot; type of Jesus. There was Jeffrey Hunter in the 1961 film &quot;King of Kings,&quot; where Jesus walked among the masses while he gave the Sermon on the Mount. In &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; the focus on the story is on the scourging and crucifixion of Jesus, but in the film's few flashbacks James Caviezel reveals a remarkably accessible figure. Tony Goldwyn has an advantage in that he does not have to wear the beard, long hair, and flowing robes of the conventional images of the Biblical Jesus. He plays Joshua as what you can only describe as being a good guy, which is more difficult to play that you would think.Auburn is not a modern Sodom or Gomorrah. The worst you can say about the place is that the different denominations are not paying attention to each other. But then one of the points about Joshua is that he not only fixes churches and carves statues of Peter, he also fixes small things. &quot;Joshua&quot; is about the ministry of Jesus and the miracles have the same affect they did the first time around.The supporting cast is solid, with F. Murray Abraham as Father Tardone, the local priest who is suspicious of the stranger in town, Kurt Fuller as Father Pat Hayes, who is captivated by that same stranger, and Stacy Edwards as Maggie, who has a different idea as to what void in her life Joshua can fill. Granted, anyone who has never been to church on Sunday is not going to be interested in this film, but &quot;Joshua&quot; should appeal to most Christian audiences, who will find it a pleasant reaffirmation of their beliefs.",4,What if Jesus showed up as a carpenter in a small town?,1085011200,"05 20, 2004",2004,2973,"['quot', 'Joshua', 'quot', 'based', 'Joseph', 'F.', 'Girzone', 'novel', 'not', 'Second', 'Coming', 'Christ', 'fact', 'would', 'think', 'not', 'second', 'coming', 'either', 'get', 'feeling', 'film', 'Jesus', 'shown', 'up', 'similar', 'ways', 'countless', 'times', 'before', 'time', 'stranger', 'named', 'Joshua', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'up', 'quiet', 'town', 'Auburn', 'dilapidated', 'old', 'barn', 'outside', 'town', 'when', 'Baptist', 'church', 'was', 'destroyed', 'storm', 'working', 'fixing', 'up', 'odd', 'members', 'congregation', 'church', 'start', 'pitch', 'help', 'Joshua.There', 'are', 'real', 'surprises', 'quot', 'Joshua', 'quot', 'especially', 'opening', 'credits', 'tell', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'Pope', 'movie', 'are', 'see', 'point', 'story', 'here', 'not', 'tell', 'anything', 'do', 'not', 'already', 'know', 'message', 'when', 'Joshua', 'actually', 'one', 'one', 'been', 'almost', 'two', 'thousand', 'years', 'attraction', 'here', 'enticing', 'quot', 'what', 'quot', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'Jesus', 'suddenly', 'showed', 'up', 'neck', 'woods', 'started', 'doing', 'things', 'talking', 'people', 'Joshua', 'not', 'preach', 'sermons', 'tell', 'parables', 'important', 'thing', 'here', 'when', 'talk', 'you.This', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'tried', 'portray', 'more', 'quot', 'realistic', 'quot', 'type', 'Jesus', 'was', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', '1961', 'film', 'quot', 'King', 'Kings', 'quot', 'where', 'Jesus', 'walked', 'masses', 'gave', 'Sermon', 'Mount', 'quot', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'quot', 'focus', 'story', 'scourging', 'crucifixion', 'Jesus', 'film', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'remarkably', 'accessible', 'figure', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'advantage', 'not', 'have', 'wear', 'beard', 'long', 'hair', 'flowing', 'robes', 'conventional', 'images', 'Biblical', 'Jesus', 'Joshua', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'being', 'good', 'guy', 'more', 'difficult', 'play', 'would', 'think.Auburn', 'not', 'modern', 'Sodom', 'Gomorrah', 'worst', 'can', 'say', 'place', 'different', 'denominations', 'are', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'other', 'then', 'one', 'points', 'Joshua', 'not', 'only', 'fixes', 'churches', 'carves', 'statues', 'Peter', 'also', 'fixes', 'small', 'things', 'quot', 'Joshua', 'quot', 'ministry', 'Jesus', 'miracles', 'have', 'same', 'affect', 'did', 'first', 'time', 'around.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'solid', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Father', 'Tardone', 'local', 'priest', 'who', 'suspicious', 'stranger', 'town', 'Kurt', 'Fuller', 'Father', 'Pat', 'Hayes', 'who', 'captivated', 'same', 'stranger', 'Stacy', 'Edwards', 'Maggie', 'who', 'different', 'idea', 'what', 'void', 'life', 'Joshua', 'can', 'fill', 'Granted', 'anyone', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'church', 'Sunday', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'interested', 'film', 'quot', 'Joshua', 'quot', 'should', 'appeal', 'most', 'Christian', 'audiences', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'pleasant', 'reaffirmation', 'beliefs']",N/A

Instead, JOSHUA gave us both an exceptionally inspirational evening.Director Jon Purdy knowing he wasn't going to be filming a shoot em up or even a hells a fire movie, relies instead on the simply beautiful story of a young man named Joshua who comes into the little town of Auburn and gives the religious people there a sense of community and belonging.  In spite of the stereotypical hardhearted priest, Joshua bonds with the assistant pastor, and all the people in the town, regardless of their denominational preference.  He helps rebuild a Baptist church; he goes to a Christian rock concert, and ultimately he has an audience with the Pope.I can't praise this movie enough for the sense of love and acceptance it portrays.  Tony Goldwyn gives his most effectively controlled performance of a stellar career; evoking the soft masculinity of a carpenter and the embodiment of friend and brothere, Goldwyn is perfectly cast.  His final scenes with F. Murray Abraham and Giancarlo Giannini as the Pope are delivered with such quiet intensity, their impact is boundless.Abraham is wonderful in a thankless role; his moment of epiphany, though sudden and brief, is awesomely presented.  Kirk Fuller as Father Pat is the movie's comic balance, but there is a warmth and understanding in his performance that makes him all the more believable.This movie made us feel good; it made us think; and its power of faith and love was inspirational.

It gives the viewer a lot to think about, and that is one aspect of the film that stands out in my opinion. There is also a disappointing aspect to this film. It is overwraught with ecumenism, and gets very preachy throughout. As an evangelical film, it doesn't work, because it seems to shove religion down the viewer's throats.The whole movie seems to be one long, rambling religous message.The storyline concerns a man named Joshua who arrives at a small town and there becomes a temporary resident, living in a very commodius and tidy barn. To the inhabitants of the town, Joshua stands out as being different, and as being someone special. Joshua indeed strikes the viewer as being especially unique. He changes the lives of many of the townspeople, showing them how to live righteous lives. He also starts helping to rebuild the Baptist church that was blown down in a massive storm. Joshua also strikes the townsfolk as being a man who can work miracles - causing the blind to see, and bringing a dead Christian back to life after dying in a church construction accident. There is great character development for the Joshua character, played to perfection by Tony Goldwyn, and the development is continued throughout the film to its conclusion, where we learn that the man Joshua is Jesus Christ Himself, who had come to earth in human form to minister to people who needed their lives turned around. He even converts the Pope himself to Christianity!Joshua is a movie that attempts to potently and vividly present the Gospel message to anyone who needs to hear it. While it is a great, thought-provoking film that is very uplifting, it is filled with flaws that make it a movie that becomes overly preachy at frequent intervals.

717011,AV33FCIDH59N8,B00006IUFW,Reviewer,"[6, 8]","I saw ""Joshua"" and found it to be even more moving and beautiful than the book. The book ""Joshua"", written by Father Girzone, a retired Catholic priest, is a book designed to move across religious borderlines and into the heart of all people.  Girzone uses the character Joshua to be his mouthpiece for both his appreciation and criticisms of organized religions and specifically the Catholic Church.  Girzone makes some stinging criticisms of the Church and organized religion which are no doubt true in many ways.  And he should know! However, Girzone attempts with words what the movie displays with such grace that no words can describe.Now about the Joshua movie, the movie has a more positive and uplifting message to it because it focuses on love and grace of God and reaches into the hearts of men.  In the movie, Joshua, a drifter who visits the small community of Auburn, brings the town together by demonstrating his fellowship with all people and his helpfulness in every corner as he uses his skills as a wood carver and his gift as healer to open the eyes and hearts of the community to the unconditional love and eternal message of God.  His message is simple and beautiful with every action.  He transcends the dogmatic ideologies and stigmas that accompany the narrowly minded religious individuals in the movie, only to tople their ignorance with his love.

I felt really eerie and disappointed when I finally learned that Joshua was supposed to be Christ Himself. And while I can enjoy a good Christian fantasy, I can't except the portrayal of Jesus using the ""S-CKS"" word that is so prevalent in today's society. That is a dirty word straight from the devil himself and maybe the origination of the word has hidden itself from today's generation, but I grew up with it in the public schools (60s and 70s) and it was dirty then and it is still dirty today. Some will say, ""Oh but you missed all of the togetherness and unity that is also portrayed"". Sadly this is the method that Satan has used so successfully in today's (and past) society. He paints a really pretty picture making it look like God and then just throws in a little sin here and a little sin there just enough so he doesn't upset the masses. Over time he keeps doing this until one day you find yourself asking, ""What happened?"". Specifically what happened to righteousness and holiness? What happened to prayer in the public schools? What happened to the sanctity of marriage? Why is the divorce rate now higher among Christians than non-believers? This movie also has Joshua proclaiming that the fear of God is a bad thing which could not be further from the truth.

717026,A3MK4MGSU22GR,B00006IUFW,"TaosGuy ""Taos Guy""","[0, 0]","I first read this book 30 years ago and just finished the movie version last evening. This book/movie is appropriately simple, because Love is simple, but we seem to make it so difficult for ourselves. It told such a non-denominational version of who & what He may be like, if He would show up again today, in our midst.In a movie, like this one, the producers have to find the just right actor to portray such a hard act to follow as Jesus. (Joshua, Jeshua, Jeshua Ben Joseph, etc.) In the book version however, we supply the faces of the characters by using our own imagination. If the author gives a good description of the characters he is writing about we can do really well with mentally conjuring up a face and body for them as the author had intended.In my case, and with many others, Jesus has come to me when I was desperate and lost and also when I cursed God the Father when I had been in a lot of pain and a week without sleep. I was really upset and I dissed God the Father. I won't go into detail but Jesus is the most beautiful person I've ever seen, yet so male. He promised to be with us always in our most difficult times and He has not broken that promise.What I remember about Him the most clearly is His eyes. In the movie King of Kings Jeffery Hunter had beautiful blue eyes. I don't know why they used blue eyes, but it worked. And it certainly works for the real thing. He has &#34;Eyes of Heaven!&#34; When He looks at you one sees all of Creation in His eyes. They are just captivating. What is the old saying, &#34;Eyes are the windows of the Soul.&#34;There are two lines from Scripture that I think are very profound and set the stage for all the rest of the story. One, from Genesis, asks &#34;Who told you that you are naked?&#34; I don't hold to the childish perception that Eve offered an apple to Adam. Prior to that moment God had told them that they could partake of any tree in the Garden, but not the one in the center of the Garden. I firmly believe that that Tree was the Earth... Beautiful to behold and good for gaining Wisdom! As Eve said.But, just as any intelligent being with free will would do, we had to see what it was like to be a beautiful flower or a great Oak or a great animal. How alluring is this beautiful Planet of ours? How frail is the Earth moving through the cold and inhospitable Space around it.So, when I got back from my death experience I knew that it's all about Love. It always has been. It always will be. Love is behind everything! Love is the only real thing in Creation. All else is allusion.In the '60's the hippies declared that &#34;God is Love!&#34; But that is backwards. It's &#34;Love is God&#34;. We perceive the Love as a God. Then we go about yelling at others who don't perceive that God as we do. We are the gods of old. Blasphemy, you might say. But just ask yourselves, &#34;Who are we that God is mindful of us?&#34;John Michael Kessler",5,.It's all about Love!,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,2925,"['first', 'read', 'book', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'finished', 'movie', 'version', 'last', 'evening', 'book/movie', 'appropriately', 'simple', 'Love', 'simple', 'seem', 'make', 'so', 'difficult', 'told', 'non-denominational', 'version', 'who', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'again', 'today', 'midst.In', 'movie', 'one', 'producers', 'have', 'find', 'just', 'right', 'actor', 'portray', 'hard', 'act', 'follow', 'Jesus', 'Joshua', 'Jeshua', 'Jeshua', 'Ben', 'Joseph', 'etc', 'book', 'version', 'however', 'supply', 'characters', 'using', 'own', 'imagination', 'author', 'good', 'description', 'characters', 'writing', 'can', 'do', 'really', 'well', 'mentally', 'conjuring', 'up', 'face', 'body', 'author', 'had', 'intended.In', 'case', 'many', 'others', 'Jesus', 'come', 'when', 'was', 'desperate', 'lost', 'also', 'when', 'cursed', 'God', 'Father', 'when', 'had', 'been', 'lot', 'pain', 'week', 'sleep', 'was', 'really', 'upset', 'dissed', 'God', 'Father', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'Jesus', 'most', 'beautiful', 'person', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'yet', 'so', 'male', 'promised', 'be', 'always', 'most', 'difficult', 'times', 'not', 'broken', 'promise.What', 'remember', 'Him', 'most', 'clearly', 'eyes', 'movie', 'King', 'Kings', 'Jeffery', 'Hunter', 'had', 'beautiful', 'blue', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'used', 'blue', 'eyes', 'worked', 'certainly', 'real', 'thing', '34', 'Eyes', 'Heaven', '34', 'When', 'one', 'Creation', 'eyes', 'are', 'just', 'captivating', 'What', 'old', 'saying', '34', 'Eyes', 'are', 'windows', 'Soul.', '34', 'are', 'two', 'lines', 'Scripture', 'think', 'are', 'very', 'profound', 'set', 'stage', 'rest', 'story', 'One', 'Genesis', '34', 'Who', 'told', 'are', 'naked', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'childish', 'perception', 'Eve', 'offered', 'apple', 'Adam', 'Prior', 'moment', 'God', 'had', 'told', 'could', 'partake', 'tree', 'Garden', 'not', 'one', 'center', 'Garden', 'firmly', 'believe', 'Tree', 'was', 'Earth', 'Beautiful', 'behold', 'good', 'gaining', 'Wisdom', 'Eve', 'said.But', 'just', 'intelligent', 'being', 'free', 'will', 'would', 'do', 'had', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'beautiful', 'flower', 'great', 'Oak', 'great', 'animal', 'How', 'alluring', 'beautiful', 'Planet', 'ours', 'How', 'frail', 'Earth', 'moving', 'cold', 'inhospitable', 'Space', 'it.So', 'when', 'got', 'back', 'death', 'experience', 'knew', 'Love', 'always', 'been', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'Love', 'everything', 'Love', 'only', 'real', 'thing', 'Creation', 'else', ""'60"", 'hippies', 'declared', '34', 'God', 'Love', '34', 'backwards', '34', 'Love', 'God', '34', 'perceive', 'Love', 'God', 'Then', 'go', 'yelling', 'others', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'perceive', 'God', 'do', 'are', 'gods', 'old', 'Blasphemy', 'might', 'say', 'just', 'ask', 'yourselves', '34', 'Who', 'are', 'God', 'mindful', '34', 'John', 'Michael', 'Kessler']",N/A

717034,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,B00006IUFW,T.M. Reader,"[0, 0]","Watch this with your family (all ages invited) or thoughtfully alone.  It's a story, from the Joseph Girzone novel, of a stranger that arrives in a small town.  The tale unfolds obviously into a 21st century mirror of Jesus' experiences in the 1st century gospel story . . . healing, Pharisees, patience and compassion, persecution, love.Without question, any believer will take issue with SOME theological difference they can locate in this presentation.  But if you are a follower of Jesus, or Yeshua if you prefer, I encourage you to set aside theological wrangling and don't miss the opportunity to enjoy this. Let your imagination run with this ""what if"" of a visit by Jesus.Some critical production observations -- the hometown scenes early in the movie are indeed a bit trite.  Much of the humor is corny, and some of the ""good people"" a bit oafish, many examples of over-characterization. The town is too clean.  Even the ruins of a destroyed church are orderly (a typical Hollywood treatment).  Kind of a made-for-TV feel, but still, this keeps it safe for kids.  There is much wisdom in the story (the Gospel story!), so please try to get past some of the Hollywood weaknesses and think about the tale. By the way, Kurt Fuller delivers nicely as Joshua, and F. Murray Abraham is spot on as an unlikeable priest.The payoff -- the story builds toward a trip to the Vatican for Joshua and an audience with the Pope.  A bit of awesome footage of that location, and a very profound ending.I'll give it 4 stars for enjoyability and the inspiring story.

717035,A3EJVZ5LCBP61X,B00006IUFW,"TOMMY C ELLIS ""Prison Rev.""","[10, 13]","Joshua is provocative, yet unassailable, on so many levels.  The key church and religious characters are Catholic.  Some may struggle with this choice, in that most ""Christian"" movies these days are evangelical.  Yet, the music behind this movie included 3rd Day, Jacci Valesquez and Michael W. Smith--all well-known figures in the Contemporary Christian Music scene.  Additionally, the author seems to be paralleling what Jesus might experience today with what he experienced 2000 years ago.  The dominant religion in Jerusalem was Judaism.  In the Christian world today, Catholicism is still by far the largest group, comprising a billion souls.  So, the choice makes sense.While the focus was a Catholic church, and two priests with different struggles, the theological flavor was more akin to a Promise Keepers or Billy Graham program--great cooperation between different sects with differing styles and personalities, yet all attempting to serve the same God.  Nobody ""came home to Rome,"" nor did the priest struggling against hierarchy, decide he had to be ""born again.""  These elements might cause heartburn for religious idealogues, but most Christians will see balanced Christian unity and love in this cooperation.The acting in Joshua was top-notch.  Most of the actors were seasoned, and the story flowed at a natural, uncontrived pace.  As for tension--it was subtle but powerful.  I expected this story to play out like Jesus' first advent--with the inevitable trial by religious authorities, and Joshua being condemned.  Instead, we are treated to the pleasant question:  What if the authorities had listened?Bottom-line:  Joshua is provactive, in that it encourages love and Christian cooperation across denominational lines.  Additionally, nobody crosses lines, yet souls are converted.  The acting here is subtle, natural, and likable.  This is the ultimate family movie--clean, heartwarming, life-affirming--yet with plenty of discussion material.

717036,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00006IUFW,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[7, 10]","I first read the book JOSHUA about ten years ago. I always knew that if the right person was behind the project, it would make a great movie. I was really excited about the film, but because of the limited release was unable to see it in theatres. However, after having viewed the film at home, I'm kind of glad that I didn't see the movie in a theatre.I give the filmmakers credit because they have tried to make a solid movie. The acting is well done, the cinematography is better than average, and the action of the film is accompanied by a charming soundtrack. However, in their attempt not to be just another Christian movie and to make a movie that would appeal to a wider audience, the filmmakers have fallen to one of the most familiar sins of the world:  mediocrity.The book JOSHUA is a great book, full of deep and and probing questions. Granted it's premise is not Biblical because when Jesus said he would come again, the whole world would know.  That is a caution all should keep in mind when reading the book or watching the movie. Nevertheless, the premise is intriguing to think about, causing one to reflect upon the way one lives one's life; in a similar vein as the What Would Jesus Do phenomena that swept the Church several years ago did.However, the movie lacks this probing. Instead, it takes the central message of the story; that God loves us so much that he died for us; and waters it down to the point that it is almost unrecognizable. In an attempt to be cool and relevant and appeal to an unchurched audience, the filmmakers have done the opposite of what many Christian filmmakers have done in the past: they have forsaken the story for solid filmmaking.Overall, the movie isn't all that bad. It's actually a fairly good movie, better than over half of the films churned out in Hollywood and many people will enjoy it. It tends to leave people feeling kind of warm and fuzzy inside, much like the effect that some have after watching an Oprah show. However, that is not what the Gospel is all about, nor is it what the book JOSHUA was about either. Therefore, though I applaud the filmmakers' attempt, I cannot give them any higher praise.

It's one of the only movies that adequately depict Christ as a living, moving, FEELING human being. Now, granted, the production values are modest (to match the budget), and the script is lightweight. Okay, some of the acting is marginal, and the directing fairly straightforward. And, the photography is made-for-TV quality. Still, it's a breath of fresh air, and a nice change from the typically stale, clich&eacute;-ridden, formulaic Hollywoodland fare.It's a little film - I would actually only give it three stars in hindsight - but it has a lot of heart, especially revealed in the performance by Tony Goldwyn in the title role. Goldwyn hasn't got a lot to work with script-wise, but he still gives us a very touching, believable rendition of a modern-day Christ. He's earthy, amiable, vulnerable, witty, tender, and - at times - powerful, reminding me of his work in another little film, The Boys Next Door. I really feel these are the types of roles Goldwyn was made for, as opposed to his better-known villains (Ghost, Pelican Brief, Kiss the Girls, The 6th Day, Last Samurai). He's got heart, and it only seems to come out in these more pathos-filled characters.Kurt Fuller also brings wit, vulnerability and a likeable everyman feel to his character as the priest that becomes Joshua's best friend. Together they try to impact a small, non-descript American town so that the residents become involved in each other's lives and begin caring for one another. They find themselves at an impasse with the priest's superior, played by F. Murray Abraham, who sees Joshua as a threat to his authority, and eventually drags him to Rome to stand before the Pope, played by Giancarlo Giannini. This is a Catholic-supported film, based on the novel by Joseph Girzone, with a message that is universal: love God and love your neighbor as yourself.
