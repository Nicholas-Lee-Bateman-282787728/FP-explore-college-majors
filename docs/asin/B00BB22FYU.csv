Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 7]","I didn't have particularly high expectations for the low-budget science fiction endeavor ""Cloned: The Reactor Chronicles."" When I glanced at the IMDB rating, it had an overall vote score of 4.0 out of 10. Not a very good sign, to be sure, but it does seem unduly harsh. While this is certainly not a perfect movie, it is filled with fresh ideas and amusing moments. And if you go into the experience with modest expectations, you just might find yourself pleasantly surprised. At about 3 1/2 stars overall, I might just as easily have been persuaded to round up as down. Ultimately, though, the film's inconsistent performances keep it from being a true guilty pleasure. Although John de Lancie (Star Trek: The Next Generation) lends the film some sci-fi credibility in the cast, he is only in the story for a very brief period. The bulk of the movie, maybe 95%, is carried by three young actors as the sole characters on screen: Stella Maeve, Alexander Nifong, and J. Mallory McCree. These three performers constitute the film's six main characters. It isn't called ""Cloned"" for nothing!The movie takes place on a desolate island (of course) where our attractive youngsters have decided to camp. As they row over, the movie intercuts scenes with de Lancie and his wife under attack in their home on that exact same island. As the trio bicker incessantly, it doesn't seem like it's going to be a fun stay! If they only knew! Maeve decides to investigate the abandoned house. As there is no sign of the inhabitants and a storm has flared up, they decide to make themselves comfortable. Little do they know that this was once the laboratory for some nefarious experiments and they triggered something. I would like to describe how the actual cloning takes place, but the methodology is one of the movie's biggest laughs! When the kids are confronted by their alter egos, the movie kicks into another gear.Up to this point, the movie was fairly routine and uninvolving. The kick is that the clones are better versions of the kids, both smarter and stronger. From here out, the screenplay works like a cat-and-mouse game as the real people pair off with the clones. And it can be quite fun. I didn't particularly care for Nifong in his real role, but as the clone--he gives the film its most accomplished performance. I found him absolutely hysterical for some reason. He was the only stand-out in the cast for me. Truthfully, I wished the other performances had matched the same level of lunacy. The scientific back story is utter nonsense as well. They throw just enough info at you so you won't ask questions, but none of it makes much sense. Maybe that's the point, though. As the clones match wits against their originators, the movie demonstrates many good ideas and much humor. While I wasn't crazy about the beginning, I was having fun by the end.

As campy as that sounds, the film is not campy.I didn't like any of the main characters. Craig reminded me of the Ashton Kutcher we don't like. Tracey was moody and showered with her back to the camera, and Derek was too serious. As they battled their smarter, stronger, and more likable clones, I found myself rooting for the evil clones.The science was not well developed as one might expect when you put ""clone"" and ""septic tank"" in the same sentence.
