1129390,A3MQAQT8C6D1I7,B00113ALL8,AverageReviewer,"[4, 5]","I've always been a fan of Magnum and I must say that Season 8 is the best one for me of all of them largely because it was a capstone season.  As most fans know, Magnum traditionally was intended to end after Season 7 but fan and popular demand made for an 8th season.This 8th Season to me brought together the best of Magnum.  It had some great ""traditional magnum episodes"" while it also had Magnum playing a mock ""Indiana Jones"" part...for those of you who don't know Tom Selleck was originally considered to play Indiana Jones but Sellect was under contract to Magnum PI and couldn't take the role so this parody episode included on this set shows Magnum in Fedora and Indi Jacket and even with a whip --- hilarious.  This season is worth buying just for this episode.Additionally, you get the final episode, quite a few references and questions on who Robin Masters is -- could Higgins be Robin Masters?  Watch this season to find out more.Overall, there are plenty of TV shows from the 80s that are contextually irrelevant today or are simply unwatchable....Magnum stands apart.  Even if you didn't grow up watching Magnum, you can still enjoy this series today. Albeit, there were quite a few more references to Vietnam etc -- a product of the Era that provides some good historical context.  I miss some of that realism from many of today's TV shows that just take place in Generic America (Generica).  Magnum had flavor, the show had flair, it had comedy, seriousness, fun, beautiful ladies, and very memorable characters.I enjoy all the Magnum seasons but I must say, I only own Season 8 if that says anything.Caution though, if you're a Magnum purist, the show is not presented 100% exactly as it was aired but the entire episodes are there with minor tweakings and enhancements.",5,The Magnum Reunion,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,1790,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Magnum', 'must', 'say', 'Season', '8', 'best', 'one', 'largely', 'was', 'capstone', 'season', 'most', 'fans', 'know', 'Magnum', 'traditionally', 'was', 'intended', 'end', 'Season', '7', 'fan', 'popular', 'demand', 'made', '8th', 'season.This', '8th', 'Season', 'brought', 'together', 'best', 'Magnum', 'had', 'great', 'traditional', 'magnum', 'episodes', 'also', 'had', 'Magnum', 'playing', 'mock', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'part', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'was', 'originally', 'considered', 'play', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Sellect', 'was', 'contract', 'Magnum', 'PI', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'role', 'so', 'parody', 'episode', 'included', 'set', 'Magnum', 'Fedora', 'Indi', 'Jacket', 'even', 'whip', 'hilarious', 'season', 'worth', 'buying', 'just', 'episode.Additionally', 'get', 'final', 'episode', 'quite', 'few', 'references', 'questions', 'who', 'Robin', 'Masters', 'could', 'be', 'Robin', 'Masters', 'Watch', 'season', 'find', 'out', 'more.Overall', 'are', 'plenty', 'TV', 'shows', '80s', 'are', 'contextually', 'irrelevant', 'today', 'are', 'simply', 'unwatchable', '.Magnum', 'apart', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'watching', 'Magnum', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'series', 'today', 'Albeit', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'more', 'references', 'Vietnam', 'etc', 'product', 'Era', 'good', 'historical', 'context', 'miss', 'realism', 'many', 'today', 'TV', 'just', 'take', 'place', 'Generic', 'America', 'Generica', 'Magnum', 'had', 'flavor', 'show', 'had', 'flair', 'had', 'comedy', 'seriousness', 'fun', 'beautiful', 'ladies', 'very', 'memorable', 'characters.I', 'enjoy', 'Magnum', 'seasons', 'must', 'say', 'only', 'own', 'Season', '8', 'anything.Caution', ""'re"", 'Magnum', 'purist', 'show', 'not', 'presented', '100', '%', 'exactly', 'was', 'aired', 'entire', 'episodes', 'are', 'there', 'minor', 'tweakings', 'enhancements']",Magnum P.I.: The Complete Eighth Season

The DVD is of great quality and especially the episode before the last. I won't tell how the last one ended, but, when Magnum thgouht his daughter died he still wrote her letters which we can get glimpse on in various moments...I have to say this that Orsen Welles was supposed to play Robin but he died suddenly and it's the only reason why you never seen him after the 7th season. he died in 1983. But he is Robin Masters and the part DOES fit the way he lived his life:). for better or worse. I have Mr Arkadin his book too. But Higgins is NOT Mr. Masters. So that I had to disclose. But the s erie is mostly based on Robins estate which is a brilliant base of a story, and Magnum up to the last episode is known to be a P.I because of undisclosed problems With the Vietnam world and justice needed to be served for the innocent. He is remarkably faithful to his cause and by that still great 'Private eye' to the end. The issues With Vietnam war also came on screen and his thgouhts about it.

1129394,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00113ALL8,Craig MACKINNON,"[3, 4]","Season 8 is a tacked-on afterthought by the executives of CBS.  Not cancelled, then cancelled, then movie deals made and broken and the series uncancelled again....  Well, let's say that I thought the first end-of-series show was brilliant (Season 7's ""Limbo"") and was skeptical that Season 8 would be nothing better than a redundant add-on to the series.  Unfortunately, for much of the season, that is exactly what it felt like.  Old friends/guest stars return for one more spin in the Ferrari, and many of the shows felt like they were done before, and better, earlier in the series.Then comes the second end-of-series show and all is redeemed.  It's rare enough that a series-ender is great (I'm looking at you, Seinfeld!), but Magnum ends up with two!  Without giving anything away, it's a completely different bridge to the future for Magnum, but one that is equally satisfying to long-time fans of the series.20 years later I'm able to rewatch the entire season on DVD and can appreciate all the shows in this season better.  True, the season is still uneven, expecially compared to the polish of Seasons 5-7.  There are some real stinkers here - another reviewer likened them to the old ABC ""After School Specials"", and the comparison is apt.  On the other hand, there are some excellent shows that make the bad ones easier to sit through.  The best (other than the finale and premier) is the melodramatic ""Unfinished Business"", where we see Magnum in full Navy SEAL mode hunting down Michele's killer through espionage, survellience, and stealth.  ""Raiders of the Lost Art"" is also a favourite, which must exist somewhat outside true Magnum canon: Tom Sellick plays Magnum as Indiana Jones by donning a fedora and bullwhip and pursuing the Lost Art of the Ancients, in competition with nefarious villians who would use the Art for their own sinister purposes.  Sharp fans will remember that Sellick was originally cast for the lead in Raiders of the Lost Ark, but CBS refused to allow his participation as it would interfere with the Magnum series filming.Obviously, fans of the series will need this disk to complete their collections, and it is certainly worth a look for casual fans, but overall it's not as good a season as 6 or 7 (it also has fewer episodes).  There are, finally, a few commentaries on this disk, but they are generally uninteresting even though they contain some interesting nuggets of information.  More interesting is the Rockford Files episode that is included, in which Tom Sellick is a guest star (in a very un-Magnum-like role).",4,"A ""coda"" to the symphony that is Magnum P.I.",1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,2566,"['Season', '8', 'tacked-on', 'afterthought', 'executives', 'CBS', 'Not', 'cancelled', 'then', 'cancelled', 'then', 'movie', 'deals', 'made', 'broken', 'series', 'uncancelled', 'again', 'Well', 'let', 'say', 'thought', 'first', 'end-of-series', 'show', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Season', '7', 'Limbo', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Season', '8', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'better', 'redundant', 'add-on', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'much', 'season', 'exactly', 'what', 'felt', 'Old', 'friends/guest', 'return', 'one', 'more', 'spin', 'Ferrari', 'many', 'shows', 'felt', 'were', 'done', 'before', 'better', 'earlier', 'series.Then', 'second', 'end-of-series', 'show', 'redeemed', 'rare', 'enough', 'series-ender', 'great', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Seinfeld', 'Magnum', 'up', 'two', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'completely', 'different', 'bridge', 'future', 'Magnum', 'one', 'equally', 'satisfying', 'long-time', 'fans', 'series.20', 'years', 'later', ""'m"", 'able', 'rewatch', 'entire', 'season', 'DVD', 'can', 'appreciate', 'shows', 'season', 'better', 'True', 'season', 'still', 'uneven', 'expecially', 'compared', 'polish', 'Seasons', '5-7', 'are', 'real', 'stinkers', 'here', 'reviewer', 'likened', 'old', 'ABC', 'School', 'Specials', 'comparison', 'apt', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'excellent', 'shows', 'make', 'bad', 'ones', 'easier', 'sit', 'best', 'other', 'finale', 'premier', 'melodramatic', 'Unfinished', 'Business', 'where', 'see', 'Magnum', 'full', 'Navy', 'SEAL', 'mode', 'hunting', 'down', 'Michele', 'killer', 'espionage', 'survellience', 'stealth', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Art', 'also', 'favourite', 'must', 'exist', 'somewhat', 'outside', 'true', 'Magnum', 'canon', 'Tom', 'Sellick', 'Magnum', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'donning', 'fedora', 'bullwhip', 'pursuing', 'Lost', 'Art', 'Ancients', 'competition', 'nefarious', 'villians', 'who', 'would', 'use', 'Art', 'own', 'sinister', 'purposes', 'Sharp', 'fans', 'will', 'remember', 'Sellick', 'was', 'originally', 'cast', 'lead', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'CBS', 'refused', 'allow', 'participation', 'would', 'interfere', 'Magnum', 'series', 'filming.Obviously', 'fans', 'series', 'will', 'need', 'disk', 'complete', 'collections', 'certainly', 'worth', 'look', 'casual', 'fans', 'overall', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'season', '6', '7', 'also', 'fewer', 'episodes', 'are', 'finally', 'few', 'commentaries', 'disk', 'are', 'generally', 'uninteresting', 'even', 'contain', 'interesting', 'nuggets', 'information', 'More', 'interesting', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'episode', 'included', 'Tom', 'Sellick', 'guest', 'star', 'very', 'un-Magnum-like', 'role']",Magnum P.I.: The Complete Eighth Season
1129395,AAJ1IYOUIHWF,B00113ALL8,D. Sun,"[9, 10]","Season 8 was added on for some reason and is a short season with only 12 or so episodes. I was highly disappointed in the ending in Season 7 and was happy the series was going to be continued, since to have it end the way it was presented in Season 7 would just be sad. Season 8 itself had a few decent episodes of Magnum with familiar characters and scenarios. The final episode is just...ok. It felt like they had a few funny and good ideas, but ran out of time or something. Still, after being a fan for so long and never being able to watch the show or the season 7 or 8 endings I'm happy to have now seen the entire series.

1129398,A6A38ESR48ZPK,B00113ALL8,"grundle2600 ""grundle2600""","[94, 99]","Magnum P.I. is my favorite show of all time. Season 8 is the last season.The original plan was that season 7 was to be the last season. ""Limbo,"" the last episode of season 7, was originally broadcast as the last episode of the series. However, after that episode was broadcast, they decided to do one more season. When season 8 first aired, they broadcasted an edited version of ""Limbo."" Whereas the original version of ""Limbo"" closed up the storyline, the edited version sort of left things hanging.Universal has announced that the season 8 DVD set will contain the episode ""Limbo."" I am guessing and hoping (but am not certain) that this will be the edited version, because the original version was already included on the season 7 DVD set.For the record, I do not like the idea of changing something after it has already been officially released. For example, I love the original theatrical versions of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, and I hate the changes that George Lucas made for the ""special editions.""However, having both versions of ""Limbo"" is a good thing, because the edited version sets up the stage for season 8.Here are the episodes from season 8:Infinity and Jelly Doughnuts - It's hard to talk about this one without giving away any spoilers. So let's just say that this is a very heartwarming and moving episode. My only criticism is that in order for the plot to work, it requires rewriting the past history of what had happened in ""Limbo."" Some Magnum fans wonder if it's really fair to consider this episode (and all of season 8, in fact) an official part of the Magnum storyline. Some fans have suggested that the entirety of season 8 was just a dream. I guess if you analyze it too much, it can ruin your enjoyment. So I recommend that you try not to think about it too much. Anyway, this is a wonderful episode.Pleasure Principle - The immensity of what had happened in previous episodes means that Magnum still needs some more time to recover, adapt, and adjust. So Magnum is still dealing with what happened to him. Also, Magnum and Higgins sort of switch personalities with each other. This episode has the most realistic depiction of a psychiatrist in any episode of any TV show that has ever been made. I love how Magnum imagines Mac eating so many pastries that he explodes!Innocence, A Broad - One of the things that I love about this series is that the women tend to be quite intelligent and interesting. So I was disappointed that the writers decided to use an idiot bimbo in this episode. I really do not like this episode.Tigers Fan - While this is certainly one of the better episodes of this season, I was saddened that the writers decided to kill off one of the recurring characters that I had come to love over the course of the series. I like this episode, but it kind of hurts to watch it.Forever in Time - This is one of those episodes involving Magnum investigating someone who died a long time ago. But it's not as good as previous episodes of that type, such as ""The Woman On The Beach"" from season 2.The Love That Lies - Magnum discovers that his friend Carol is adopted. This is kind of like one of those horrible ""After School Specials.""A Girl Named Sue - Back in the season 4 episode ""Rembrandt's Girl,"" Carol Burnett was the guest actress. Now I love Carol Burnett. But the script for that episode was way too cliched and unoriginal - Magnum and Burnett got locked in a bank vault! What were the writers thinking? Well now Burnett is back again in this season 8 episode, playing the same character. Fortunately, the writers did a much better job this time around. In this episode, Burnett now has a license as a private investigator, and she and Magnum unknowingly get into a shootout against each other. This is one of the better episodes of this season.Unfinished Business - This is my favorite episode of this season. I really, really don't want to spoil the plot for you. Let's just say that this episode is a gift to the long term fans of the series - the ones who have really been paying attention. In order to fully understand this episode, you need to be familiar with quite a few previous episodes. Right off the bat, you need to know what happened in ""Memories Are Forever"" from season 2 and ""Little Girl Who"" from season 7. But beyond that, there are other things that are not necessarily so obvious. For example, take the relationship between the woman and her father in this episode, and compare it to the relationship between Magnum and his own father in the season 4 episode ""Home From The Sea."" Also, compare Magnum's decision at the end of this episode regarding Quang Ki, to Magnum's decision regarding Ivan at the end of the season 3 episode ""Did You See The Sunrise."" A lot of work went in to the writing of this episode, and it pays off in so many ways. This is a truly powerful, emotionally charged episode. There's a series of very tense scenes with no dialog, combined with a musical montage where Magnum uses his espionage and spying skills. Will Magnum get caught or not? It's quite nerve wracking to watch. The song playing during the montage is ""The Brazilian"" by Genesis, from their ""Invisible Touch"" album. There's also a humorous scene where Higgins reads Magnum's grocery list.The Great Hawaiian Adventure Company -  There are two plot points going on in this episode. In one of them, Magnum (unsuccessfully) decides to start his own tourist company. This is credible, as Magnum was always willing to try new things. The other plot line is like one of those awful ""After School Specials."" Over the course of the series, it has been well established, with plenty of realistic credibility,  that even though T.C. didn't have any children of his own, he was still very good with kids. As coach of a Little League baseball team, T.C. was consistently an excellent role model, and always inspired the best in the children that he spent time with. But then during the season 7 episode ""Missing Melody,"" the writers, who apparently couldn't think of any good ideas at the time, decided that all of a sudden, T.C. had two children who appeared magically out of thin air, and that one of them was kidnapped. Now in this season 8 episode, the writers, who are again apparently short of good ideas, have decided that T.C.'s son has joined a street gang. What were the writers thinking?Legend of the Lost Art - Tom Selleck (the actor who plays Magnum) would have played Indiana Jones in the movie ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"" except that he had already signed on to play Magnum. So in this episode, he finally gets to play Indiana Jones. This episode is a great parody of ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"" with many scenes and lines of dialog making references to the movie. I love the movie, and I love this parody.Transitions - The paper manuscript for Robin Masters's latest novel is stolen. Of course in the season 1 episode ""J. Digger Doyle"" we learned that Robin Masters didn't type out his manuscripts - he dictated them into a tape recorder. Luther Gillis also shows up, which can be good or bad, depending on your feelings toward him. In my opinion, this episode is largely filler.Resolutions - This is the two hour series finale. You know I won't spoil the plot for you. I always enjoy watching this episode. Good night!",5,A pint of stout.....

1129403,A2VD2X4DWDQ8FB,B00113ALL8,Jonathan Sharpe,"[19, 21]","I was 11 years old when this show went off the air and I remember how captivated I was by the characters, the action, and the mystery of it all; Magnum P.I. was the coolest character I'd ever seen. Now that I'm 30, I began revisiting the shows on DVD. Once I got past the styles and became immersed in the stories again, I was surprised to discover that this show has held up well with age, far better than many of my other favorite 80's shows such as The A-Team, Knight Rider, or Miami Vice. The reason why is that this show had the perfect balance of comedy, mystery, and from time-to-time an unexpected touch of melancholy wistfulness as we discover the true characters beneath the surface, including Thomas Magnum, (spoiler alert), a boy who lost his father on the fourth of July when he died in the Korean War, lost his youth, his innocence, and his brother in Vietnam, lost his wife to another man, lost several of his best friends to more violence, and who never seems whole again, never finding anything that seems to work out. What made Magnum so appealing is that he didn't always ride off into the sunset with the girl and the money. He was a guy who'd had a tragic life, but who still tried to make the most of his life, trying to recapture the youth he'd never had. Magnum had far more substance beneath the surface than most shows of that era and was rarely given its due. Most of the depth is due to Tom Selleck himself; he was Magnum and still is. If Harrison Ford can still play Indiana Jones, then Tom Selleck should be Magnum if and when they finally get the film into theatres. Buy the entire series, grab your Old Dusseldorf, Magnum's favorite beer, and remember a time when we were all younger and the sun always rose over Robin's Nest and the tidal pool and the guest house with a sleeping private investigator back from an all-night case...just hoping that Higgins isn't ready to fly any more model planes or blow up gopher holes on his day off.",5,Gets better with the years!,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,1969,"['was', '11', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'show', 'went', 'air', 'remember', 'how', 'captivated', 'was', 'characters', 'action', 'mystery', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'was', 'coolest', 'character', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Now', ""'m"", '30', 'began', 'revisiting', 'shows', 'DVD', 'Once', 'got', 'styles', 'became', 'immersed', 'stories', 'again', 'was', 'surprised', 'discover', 'show', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'age', 'far', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'favorite', '80', 'shows', 'such', 'A-Team', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'reason', 'why', 'show', 'had', 'perfect', 'balance', 'comedy', 'mystery', 'time-to-time', 'unexpected', 'touch', 'melancholy', 'wistfulness', 'discover', 'true', 'characters', 'surface', 'including', 'Thomas', 'Magnum', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'boy', 'who', 'lost', 'father', 'fourth', 'July', 'when', 'died', 'Korean', 'War', 'lost', 'youth', 'innocence', 'brother', 'Vietnam', 'lost', 'wife', 'man', 'lost', 'several', 'best', 'friends', 'more', 'violence', 'who', 'never', 'whole', 'again', 'never', 'finding', 'anything', 'work', 'out', 'What', 'made', 'Magnum', 'appealing', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'girl', 'money', 'was', 'guy', 'who', ""'d"", 'had', 'tragic', 'life', 'who', 'still', 'tried', 'make', 'most', 'life', 'trying', 'recapture', 'youth', ""'d"", 'never', 'had', 'Magnum', 'had', 'far', 'more', 'substance', 'surface', 'most', 'shows', 'era', 'was', 'rarely', 'given', 'due', 'Most', 'depth', 'due', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'was', 'Magnum', 'still', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'can', 'still', 'play', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'then', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'should', 'be', 'Magnum', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'film', 'theatres', 'Buy', 'entire', 'series', 'grab', 'Old', 'Dusseldorf', 'Magnum', 'favorite', 'beer', 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'sun', 'always', 'rose', 'Robin', 'Nest', 'tidal', 'pool', 'guest', 'house', 'sleeping', 'private', 'investigator', 'back', 'all-night', 'case', 'just', 'hoping', 'Higgins', ""n't"", 'ready', 'fly', 'more', 'model', 'planes', 'blow', 'up', 'gopher', 'holes', 'day', 'off']",Magnum P.I.: The Complete Eighth Season

Yoshi Tanaka(Kwan Hi Lim)dies off on his last homicide investigation, plus I found it intriguing that this DVD box set also includes a bonus episode of the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode of the ROCKFORD FILES especially since it got to show us Tom Selleck doing a gig before he became a star & started doing MAGNUM, PI on CBS back in December of 1980 which was a year later after NBC had cancelled Rockford all of the sudden back in January of 1980 when THE ROCKFORD FILES was in the middle of its 6th Season when James Garner had ran out of steam and had to quit doing the show, due to health issues after Rockford's 1974-80 run on NBC.It was also intriguing to watch the ""Tiger Fan"" episode of MAGNUM when Narcotics officers are doing a drug bust stakeout on the beach & are talking about watching the eccentric impeccable gumshoe Lance White(Tom Selleck)on the ROCKFORD FILES on TV talking about what a hot shot, pain in the butt fellow gumshoe Lance White was on Rockford and how Lance White was driving the often cynical private dick Jim Rockford(James Garner)up the wall & ended up stealing the show in both the ""White & White & Nearly Perfect"" and ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episodes since Lance White outclassed Rockford big time in every way by finding all the leads and all the clues to Rockford's case by making Rockford look bad K.O.ing Rockford in the process at Rockford's expense, which of course ruined the case Rockford was hired to investigate in the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode & again when Rockford reunites with Lance White in ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode at a private-eyes convention where a senators homicide ends up taking place at resulting in Lance White solving the case with the police's approval leaving Rockford lagging behind since Rockford could never seem to work well nor seem to be a good detective when Lance White is around along with the big age difference between James Garner & Tom Selleck along with the fact that Garner was already an old-fart while Selleck was still obviously a new-fart back then in the late 1970's.In addition to what makes this MAGNUM, P.I. DVD so cool, this DVD of MAGNUM's 8th Season provides a bonus episode from the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode of THE ROCKFORD FILES 5th Season, which was interesting since it shows us Tom Selleck as the exceptional private eye(Lance White)before his MAGNUM days and before Tom Selleck was even famous, since Tom Selleck didn't even become a superstar until he started doing MAGNUM, P.I. in the early 1980's when he became a sex symbol.Additionally, I find it kind of strange that Tom Selleck's role as the phenomenal private detective(Lance White)seemed to be a much smarter, wiser, and more successful private investigator than his role on this private detective drama as Magnum on MAGNUM, P.I. was, because the often exasperated Magnum(Tom Selleck) always seemed to be getting himself in a lot of trouble and a lot of mischief with his buddies and with the military, just like Rockford always did with the police and his buddies, especially with Rockford's persuasive ex-con buddy Angel Martin(Stuart Margolin) and his foxy attorney girlfriend(Beth Davenport).So MAGNUM's 8th Season is a definite upgrade to MAGNUM's 7th Season as well as the first 7 seasons, but what I don't understand is why didn't Universal put this as MAGNUM's final season like Universal did for the ROCKFORD FILES-SEASON 6, KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 4, & THE A-TEAM-SEASON 5, because I think it would've simply been more practical along with the fact that MAGNUM's Eighth Season had the least episodes throughout MAGNUM's whole 8-year run on CBS.It's just too bad that MAGNUM, PI didn't end up lasting longer and going for a 9th Season, because I think it would've been cool, not to mention that MAGNUM was probably the longest running detective drama of them all back then, but I think they could've done a better job in the series finale episode ""Resolutions"", since it ended as sort of a cliffhanger at the end of that episode when Rick didn't even verify if he did or didn't take Cleo(Phyllis Davis) to be his lawful wedded bride.In addition; I think it would've been a great idea if MAGNUM, P.I. would've ended up having former MATT HOUSTON co-stars guest star in at least one of the last 3 seasons of MAGNUM like Pamela Hensley for instance, which played Houston's sidekick(C.J. Parsons) on MATT HOUSTON, which would've been cool, especially since CBS's rival network ABC had already cancelled MATT HOUSTON in the Summer of 1985 just before MAGNUM hit it's Sixth Season in the Fall of 1985 on CBS since MATT HOUSTON tanked after it's 1982-85 run on ABC since it took a nose-dive in the ratings after it's 3rd Season since MATT HOUSTON started losing a lot of viewers through MIAMI VICE when it debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1984.MAGNUM's 8th Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""CBS Spirit: Oh Yes"", since that was CBS's motto from the Fall of 1987 thru the Summer of 1988 along with the fact that it was so nice being able to watch these episodes from this 1987-1988 Season complete & uncut as well with the proper introduction just like they were shown on CBS with the exception of being commercial-free plus we didn't have to watch these episodes with all those deleted scenes & added commercial interruptions we'd get on COZI-TV, WGN, USA, and A&E.;In addition to that; COZI-TV, A&E;, USA, and WGN would always use the introduction to MAGNUM, P.I.'s 6th Season for every single episode all the way from MAGNUM's 1st Season thru its 8th Season instead of using the proper & original introduction to each episode on top of that which made each episode and season less interesting to watch & made them quite boring since there wasn't much comparison to show us between the time this series started in the late Fall of 1980 & ended in the Spring of 1988.It's just too bad that THE ROCKFORD FILES couldn't have a series finale episode like MAGNUM, P.I. did.This 1987-1988 Season DVD of MAGNUM would've also been sweeter if Universal would've provided the original air-date to each episode like Universal did with MAGNUM's first 3 Seasons.For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1987-88 Season episodes on CBS was10/7/87: INFINITY & JELLY DOUGHNUTS10/14/87: PLEASURE PRINCIPLE10/28/87: INNOCENCE, A BROAD11/4/87: TIGER FAN11/11/87: FOREVER IN TIME11/18/87: THE LOVE THAT LIES1/13/88: A GIRL NAMED SUE1/20/88: UNFINISHED BUSINESS1/27/88: THE GREAT HAWAIIAN ADVENTURE COMPANY2/10/88: LEGEND OF THE LOST ART2/17/88: TRANSITIONS5/1/88: RESOLUTIONS(Aka Series Finale episode)It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Joe Santos in the episodes ""Tigers Fan"" and ""Resolutions"" after his co-starring days as Jim Rockford's often irritated police investigator buddy(Sgt. Dennis Becker)from the LAPD on the ROCKFORD FILES*Shanna Reed in ""The Great Hawaiian Adventure Company"" episode before her co-starring days on MAJOR DAD*Vincent Baggetta in the ""Unfinished

Great Hawaiian Adventure Company"", ""Transitions"", & ""Resolutions"" after his co-starring days as Arnold's best friend(Dudley)on DIFFERENT STROKESIn addition, now that Universal has released the complete series of KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, and THE INCREDIBLE HULK on DVD; I don't see what's taking Universal so long to make a MAGNUM, PI complete series DVD, especially since MAGNUM was a popular classic Universal TV show just like KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, and THE INCREDIBLE HULK all were.By the way, I have some interesting news in the works for all you classic detective drama fans out there to look forward to in the Spring of 2010.MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 is finally scheduled to be released on Tuesday March 9th,2010 and SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 is scheduled to be released on DVD on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are now both even available for pre-order as we speak.",5,Adios Magnum!,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,9215,"['time', 'Universal', 'released', 'abbreviated', '1987-88', 'Season',

While he was a hard nosed (and headed) PI, he was also a sympathetic ear for those in hard times.  His charm, natural athletic ability, and loyal circle of friends formed a cadre that oozed 'watch me'.  From Hawaii Five O (1968), Hawaii was the setting of a major show once more until 1988.The 8th and final season is delightful.  Seemingly an afterthought, this collection is addictive.  ""Infinity and Jelly Doughnuts"" is a remarkable episode that pulls Thomas back from his death just in time to solve a crime.  This season deals with the plot lines introduced in ""Infinity"", specifically his ex wife and daughter.  ""Unfinished Business"" finds Magnum on the look out for his family.  The final episode, ""Resolutions"" is a poignant, adventure filled look at Magnum as he faces the potential death of his daughter and ex wife.  Not only that, but as his grief rises, his questioning of Higgins and employment with Robin Masters comes to closure.  One family closes, and another opens.Other excellent episodes inclue ""Forever in Time"", ""Legend of the Lost Art"", and ""Tigers Fan"".  The audio commentaries and special feature, ""White On White and Nearly Perfect"" are cherries on the ice cream.Complete your Magnum collection today.
