Boobah is entertainment for babies not educational at all.  This show is nothing like sesame street(old school sesame street to be exact).I thought the purpose of educational television was to prepare children for school. At least that is what sesame street's original stated purpose was to prepare children for school.This show is entertainment under the guise of so called Educational Television.,3,This show is not educational in the least,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,528,"['show', 'designed', 'keep', 'kids', 'preoccupied', 'mom', 'dad', 'file', 'taxes', 'babysitter', 'friend', 'phone', 'Boobah', 'entertainment', 'babies', 'not', 'educational', 'show', 'nothing', 'sesame', 'street', 'old', 'school', 'sesame', 'street', 'be', 'exact', 'thought', 'purpose', 'educational', 'television', 'was', 'prepare', 'children', 'school', 'least', 'what', 'sesame', 'street', 'original', 'stated', 'purpose', 'was', 'prepare', 'children', 'school.This', 'show', 'entertainment', 'guise', 'so', 'called', 'Educational', 'Television']",Boohbah: Squeaky Socks

They absolutely LOVE the little stories that are in the middle of each episode.  They like to imitate boohbah as they do their ""exercises"".

826535,A208U42GARHSOR,B00028G51I,"Stephanie ""edenza""","[16, 18]","Instead of a snarky ""critique"" of ""Boohbah,"" here's a review of this DVD (and of ""Boohbah"" DVDs in general)If you're unfamiliar with ""Boohbah,"" the concept is that Boohbahs are five little alien-like furry creatures that dance and bop to electronic-style music. The educational value of Boohbah lies in getting pre-schoolers interested in movement, pattern and color. The Boohbahs do not speak (as opposed to the similar Teletubbies, created by the same company: Ragdoll).Another portion of the show is about ""The Story People."" Children present a gift-wrapped box in the Boohbah pod, blow the gift upward and send it to the Story People (Grandmama, Grandpapa, Mr Man, Mrs Lady, Brother & Sister, Auntie and Little Dog Fido). At least one of the Story People receives the gift and has a cute, wordless* adventure about the gift. The Boohbah videos/DVDs are named after the gifts given to The Story People (""squeaky socks"" for example). Another gift magically appears during the course of the Story People episode, to extend the adventure. *There is audio of children yelling ""Boohbah!"" and similar when the second gift appears.During the show, there is a third portion which is about children dancing and moving to music like the Boohbahs do. This is part of the ""extra features"" on Boohbah DVDs.This DVD features three 20-minutes segments of Boohbah:Squeaky Socks: Brother & Sister play in some oversized socks that squeak when one bounces in themPainting the Fence: Auntie finds a bucket of paint and paints a seemingly never-ending fenceHammock: Grandpapa has trouble getting into a hammockThe Boohbahs dance and play at the beginning and end of every segment, making color patterns and encouraging children to be active viewers. It's difficult for little ones to vegetate while watching ""Boohbah.""Your menu options include ""play all,"" which gives you all three 20-minute segments back-to-back, and ""select episode,"" which runs for that 20-minute period before returning to the menu.If you have questions/concerns about the educational content of Boohbah, there is a ""for parents"" feature on every DVD which explains the learning concepts behind ""Boohbah.""",4,How about aa actual review of this DVD?,1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,2159,"['Instead', 'snarky', 'critique', 'Boohbah', 'here', 'review', 'DVD', 'Boohbah', 'DVDs', 'general', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'Boohbah', 'concept', 'Boohbahs', 'are', 'five', 'little', 'alien-like', 'furry', 'creatures', 'dance', 'bop', 'electronic-style', 'music', 'educational', 'value', 'Boohbah', 'getting', 'pre-schoolers', 'interested', 'movement', 'pattern', 'color', 'Boohbahs', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'opposed', 'similar', 'Teletubbies', 'created', 'same', 'company', 'Ragdoll', '.Another', 'portion', 'show', 'Story', 'People', 'Children', 'present', 'gift-wrapped', 'box', 'Boohbah', 'pod', 'blow', 'gift', 'upward', 'send', 'Story', 'People', 'Grandmama', 'Grandpapa', 'Mr', 'Man', 'Mrs', 'Lady', 'Brother', 'Sister', 'Auntie', 'Little', 'Dog', 'Fido', 'least', 'one', 'Story', 'People', 'gift', 'cute', 'wordless*', 'adventure', 'gift', 'Boohbah', 'videos/DVDs', 'are', 'named', 'gifts', 'given', 'Story', 'People', 'squeaky', 'socks', 'example', 'gift', 'magically', 'course', 'Story', 'People', 'episode', 'extend', 'adventure', 'audio', 'children', 'yelling', 'Boohbah', 'similar', 'when', 'second', 'gift', 'appears.During', 'show', 'third', 'portion', 'children', 'dancing', 'moving', 'music', 'Boohbahs', 'do', 'part', 'extra', 'features', 'Boohbah', 'DVDs.This', 'DVD', 'three', '20-minutes', 'segments', 'Boohbah', 'Squeaky', 'Socks', 'Brother', 'Sister', 'play', 'oversized', 'socks', 'squeak', 'when', 'one', 'bounces', 'themPainting', 'Fence', 'Auntie', 'bucket', 'paint', 'seemingly', 'never-ending', 'fenceHammock', 'Grandpapa', 'trouble', 'getting', 'hammockThe', 'Boohbahs', 'dance', 'play', 'beginning', 'end', 'segment', 'making', 'color', 'patterns', 'encouraging', 'children', 'be', 'active', 'viewers', 'difficult', 'little', 'ones', 'vegetate', 'watching', 'Boohbah', 'menu', 'options', 'include', 'play', 'three', '20-minute', 'segments', 'back-to-back', 'select', 'episode', '20-minute', 'period', 'returning', 'menu.If', 'have', 'questions/concerns', 'educational', 'content', 'Boohbah', 'parents', 'feature', 'DVD', 'learning', 'concepts', 'Boohbah']",Boohbah: Squeaky Socks
