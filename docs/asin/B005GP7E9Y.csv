1460272,AH7FWHWAXMBPG,B005GP7E9Y,Digigirl,"[1, 1]","I am a newbie to yoga, having only been doing it regularly for a couple of months.  However, in that time I've tried quite a few videos from the library and a few that I just purchased.  I picked this one up on a whim and it's a great addition to my home practice video collection.My other favorite yoga video is a gentle workout that is awesome for stretching and for keeping my blood pressure low (I have high BP and use yoga as one way to keep it under control).  It is somewhat challenging in parts, but nothing too strenuous.This DVD, on the other hand, definitely gives a much harder workout and some goals for me to work toward - there are some positions I had a hard time with and some that I flat out couldn't do.  Not because they are so twisty or difficult to achieve, but just because my body is out of condition or too tight.  I did all 3 workouts (upper body, lower body and core) together.  By the time I got to core, I couldn't do some of the moves because my arms and legs were so tired from the first two parts.  So from now on I will do the different sections on different days.I did this workout yesterday - and my muscles are definitely letting me know today that they got a good workout!  Anyone who says yoga isn't a real workout hasn't done yoga like this!",5,Really feeling this workout,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,1280,"['am', 'newbie', 'yoga', 'having', 'only', 'been', 'doing', 'regularly', 'couple', 'months', 'However', 'time', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'quite', 'few', 'videos', 'library', 'few', 'just', 'purchased', 'picked', 'one', 'up', 'whim', 'great', 'addition', 'home', 'practice', 'video', 'collection.My', 'other', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'video', 'gentle', 'workout', 'awesome', 'stretching', 'keeping', 'blood', 'pressure', 'low', 'have', 'high', 'BP', 'use', 'yoga', 'one', 'way', 'keep', 'control', 'somewhat', 'challenging', 'parts', 'nothing', 'too', 'strenuous.This', 'DVD', 'other', 'hand', 'definitely', 'much', 'harder', 'workout', 'goals', 'work', 'are', 'positions', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'flat', 'out', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'Not', 'are', 'so', 'twisty', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'just', 'body', 'condition', 'too', 'tight', 'did', '3', 'workouts', 'upper', 'body', 'lower', 'body', 'core', 'together', 'time', 'got', 'core', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'moves', 'arms', 'legs', 'were', 'so', 'tired', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'now', 'will', 'do', 'different', 'sections', 'different', 'days.I', 'did', 'workout', 'yesterday', 'muscles', 'are', 'definitely', 'letting', 'know', 'today', 'got', 'good', 'workout', 'Anyone', 'who', 'yoga', ""n't"", 'real', 'workout', ""n't"", 'done', 'yoga']",Gwen Lawrence Fit Body Yoga

1460275,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B005GP7E9Y,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[18, 23]","Update 2/15/2012 (now three stars): Now that I have these exercises down, it's more fun to do although still hard. My arm strength has doubled and is showing definition. But I do have to drop this review down from five to three stars. Because the DVD was new before and I needed to know everything to do, I didn't realize how much this lady talks. I'm used to exercise DVDs where the instructor talks while she works out, and since they're exercising they tend to talk less, too. For this DVD, the workout scenes had no talking, but Gwen Lawrence's voice was in the background commentary style. I think that made her feel pressured to talk more, and it's really annoying. Even on the parts where we're supposed to relax, she's talking WHILE we're supposed to be relaxing. She never stops for more than a couple seconds. The stories about her class were fun to hear the first time, but now it's repetitive. I'm going to start hitting the mute button and just glancing at her to see what she does next because the talking is distracting now.Original review (five stars): I am not familiar with Gwen Lawrence and got this DVD only because I had a $5-off coupon for Gaiam products, and this DVD would give me 20% off of a yoga mat. Clearly I was going for the sale more than the person, but I happened to luck out. From first glance at the back cover, Gwen seemed pretty easy to follow so I figured, ""Why not? I'll choose her over the other Gaiam yoga DVDs."" While I wouldn't recommend everybody choose this way of buying a workout DVD, it worked out to my advantage. I honestly liked her!Upper Body Blast: The happy cow/miserable heifer joke cracked me up. This one was intermediate, not too hard but definitely not easy. There was a lot of stretching, holding and strength.Lower Body Tone: I loved this workout solely for the penguin pose. But that's only because the penguin pose was relaxing and easy to do, mainly because I'm double-jointed. Still intermediate level.I took a break after these two, but I decided after about 10 minutes that I wanted to do them all to see which one I liked best and to see whether I'd be able to handle doing all of the workouts together.Core Definition: I'm not sure if this one is so much harder because I did the other two workouts before it or was it just that hard, but this one was far more challenging for me. Part of the problem is that my upper body strength is weaker than my lower body strength (an issue with many women) so doing stuff like front planks, side planks and even doing the balancing and twist exercises required a lot of pausing to breathe. With the two other workouts, I could pretty much do everything at the level that Gwen was doing, but with this one, I spent more time in beginner poses. Usually the ones that are the hardest ones to do are the exercise segments I stick to most just for the challenge of mastering them, so I liked this one the best.Bonus Express Toning: There wasn't a lot of variation in this quick workout but it was as hard as the Core Definition. Whenever trainers give you ""short"" workouts, expect to bust a sweat because they're jamming all of that workout that's usually spread out into a fast paced, focused routine. Gwen encouraged people to not give up and continue with the exercises even when you want to give up. You better believe there were a few times I wanted to give up. With the other three 20-minute workouts, each exercise would be short counts (maybe a count of 5 or 10 and up to a minute), but these were long AND required plenty of strength and flexibility. I don't know how often I'll do this one.Other tips: Gwen has a habit of jumping from one workout to the next so it does take a little time to get used to her (especially for that plank, upward dog, downward dog). She's really good, but she never stops. She makes you get as much into her 20-minute or 10-minute workouts as she can possibly jam together. With that said, I'd recommend this DVD and theGaiam Eco Reversible Yoga Mat (Peacock), too.Only downside is for those who are not flexible, you may want to give up. For those who are looking for a light workout, don't even bother. I stood up after I was done and I'm walking like my inner thighs are giving each other the cold shoulder. It's great for the arms, legs, thighs and abs though.",3,Loved the workout but I wish she'd talk less,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,4309,"['Update', '2/15/2012', 'now', 'three', 'stars', 'Now', 'have', 'exercises', 'down', 'more', 'fun', 'do', 'still', 'hard', 'arm', 'strength', 'doubled', 'showing', 'definition', 'do', 'have', 'drop', 'review', 'down', 'five', 'three', 'stars', 'DVD', 'was', 'new', 'needed', 'know', 'everything', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'lady', 'talks', ""'m"", 'used', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'where', 'instructor', 'talks', 'out', ""'re"", 'exercising', 'tend', 'talk', 'less', 'too', 'DVD', 'workout', 'scenes', 'had', 'talking', 'Gwen', 'Lawrence', 'voice', 'was', 'background', 'commentary', 'style', 'think', 'made', 'feel', 'pressured', 'talk', 'more', 'really', 'annoying', 'Even', 'parts', 'where', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'relax', 'talking', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'relaxing', 'never', 'more', 'couple', 'seconds', 'stories', 'class', 'were', 'fun', 'hear', 'first', 'time', 'now', 'repetitive', ""'m"", 'going', 'start', 'hitting', 'mute', 'button', 'just', 'glancing', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'talking', 'distracting', 'now.Original', 'review', 'five', 'stars', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'Gwen', 'Lawrence', 'got', 'DVD', 'only', 'had', '5-off', 'coupon', 'Gaiam', 'products', 'DVD', 'would', 'give', '20', '%', 'yoga', 'mat', 'Clearly', 'was', 'going', 'sale', 'more', 'person', 'happened', 'luck', 'out', 'first', 'glance', 'back', 'cover', 'Gwen', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'easy', 'follow', 'so', 'figured', 'Why', 'not', ""'ll"", 'choose', 'other', 'Gaiam', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'everybody', 'choose', 'way', 'buying', 'workout', 'DVD', 'worked', 'out', 'advantage', 'honestly', 'liked', 'Body', 'Blast', 'happy', 'cow/miserable', 'heifer', 'joke', 'cracked', 'up', 'one', 'was', 'intermediate', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'definitely', 'not', 'easy', 'was', 'lot', 'stretching', 'holding', 'strength.Lower', 'Body', 'Tone', 'loved', 'workout', 'solely', 'penguin', 'pose', 'only', 'penguin', 'pose', 'was', 'relaxing', 'easy', 'do', 'mainly', ""'m"", 'double-jointed', 'Still', 'intermediate', 'level.I', 'took', 'break', 'two', 'decided', '10', 'minutes', 'wanted', 'do', 'see', 'one', 'liked', 'best', 'see', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'doing', 'workouts', 'Definition', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'harder', 'did', 'other', 'two', 'workouts', 'was', 'just', 'hard', 'one', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'challenging', 'Part', 'problem', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', 'weaker', 'lower', 'body', 'strength', 'issue', 'many', 'women', 'so', 'doing', 'stuff', 'front', 'planks', 'side', 'planks', 'even', 'doing', 'balancing', 'twist', 'exercises', 'required', 'lot', 'pausing', 'breathe', 'two', 'other', 'workouts', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'do', 'everything', 'level', 'Gwen', 'was', 'doing', 'one', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'beginner', 'poses', 'Usually', 'ones', 'are', 'hardest', 'ones', 'do', 'are', 'exercise', 'segments', 'stick', 'most', 'just', 'challenge', 'mastering', 'so', 'liked', 'one', 'best.Bonus', 'Express', 'Toning', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'variation', 'quick', 'workout', 'was', 'as', 'hard', 'Core', 'Definition', 'Whenever', 'trainers', 'give', 'short', 'workouts', 'expect', 'bust', 'sweat', ""'re"", 'jamming', 'workout', 'usually', 'spread', 'out', 'fast', 'paced', 'focused', 'routine', 'Gwen', 'encouraged', 'people', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'continue', 'exercises', 'even', 'when', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'better', 'believe', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'wanted', 'give', 'up', 'other', 'three', '20-minute', 'workouts', 'exercise', 'would', 'be', 'short', 'counts', 'maybe', 'count', '5', '10', 'up', 'minute', 'were', 'long', 'AND', 'required', 'plenty', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'often', ""'ll"", 'do', 'one.Other', 'Gwen', 'habit', 'jumping', 'one', 'workout', 'next', 'take', 'little', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'especially', 'plank', 'upward', 'dog', 'downward', 'dog', 'really', 'good', 'never', 'stops', 'get', 'much', '20-minute', '10-minute', 'workouts', 'can', 'possibly', 'jam', 'together', 'said', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'theGaiam', 'Eco', 'Reversible', 'Yoga', 'Mat', 'Peacock', 'too.Only', 'downside', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'flexible', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'light', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'stood', 'up', 'was', 'done', ""'m"", 'walking', 'inner', 'thighs', 'are', 'giving', 'other', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'great', 'arms', 'legs', 'thighs', 'abs']",Gwen Lawrence Fit Body Yoga
