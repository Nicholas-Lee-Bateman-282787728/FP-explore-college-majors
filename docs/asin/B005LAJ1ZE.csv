They have assembled such a great cast of characters, and most are all really funny and unique in their own way. They use elements of satire and parody in this show, but it's not meant to be taken too seriously or as an accurate portrayal of the suburbs, that's why it's well done. They play with the stereotypes while at the same time subverting the expectations of these stereotypes. The main character, Tessa, is perfectly played by Jane Levy. I don't think they could have chosen anyone better. And I find myself laughing throughout most episodes. Once the show found it's voice, you could really tell, and it just got better. The only down side of season 1 is a guest star they have at the end of the season but I am happy to find out that guest star will not be returning for Season 2.This show is definitely the best new comedy of 2011-2012.

1492783,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAJ1ZE,Chris Kennison,"[2, 2]","I had no idea this show even existed until Jane Levy was cast in the update of the &#34;Evil Dead&#34; movie. Out of curiosity as to who Jane Levy was, I rented disk 1 of season 1 and immediately fell in love with it for reasons I probably can't list, but I'm gonna try.I don't think I'm the typical target audience for a show like &#34;Suburgatory&#34;, but maybe I am; who knows? I didn't think I was the target audience for &#34;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#34; either before I got hooked on that show and realized that the target audience was not teenage girls, but EVERYBODY. The same goes for &#34;Suburgatory&#34;. You would assume that the target audience is teenage girls, but you would be sadly mistaken. The target audience is anybody with a heart and/or a sense of humor.The show is about a single father, George Altman, who moves he and his daughter, Tessa Altman, from the inner city to a suburb, against the daughters will. Tessa is a product of the city and much about her life is confusing, fast and overwhelming. She doesn't know her mother and she is trying to find a place to fit in with a rebellious outer-shell and a vulnerable inner-shell.The show is gifted with solid writing and creative comedy, but most importantly Jane Levy sells the character of Tessa and you can't help but feel invested in every conflicting situation she encounters. She's adorable, twisted, tougher than she appears, more vulnerable than she appears, confused and dealing with life as it comes; something we can all relate to.Bottom line, it's a funny quirky show with real emotions and real dilemma's camouflaged by an overall giddiness. Not being a big fan of formula shows, &#34;Suburgatory&#34; is right up my alley because in the course of watching the episodes, you come to know Tessa and George and you come to love them and wish they were your friends or neighbors and you want to keep coming back.

1492785,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B005LAJ1ZE,D. S. Thurlow,"[16, 22]","""Suburgatory"" is a new (2011-2012) ABC television comedy series, starring Jane Levy as Tessa Altman, cool and savvy New York City high school student, summarily transplanted to the suburbs by her architect father George (Jeremy Sisto) after he discovers a box of condoms in her room.  Tessa finds herself hilariously out of step with her new classmates, and must scramble to find her own niche.  Some of the best comedy of the show comes from Tessa's sarcastic voice-over commentary on her new life.The storylines typically proceed on two tracks, with Tessa finding new ways to prod and poke her overbearing classmates, and sometimes just being a typical teenager.  Her single (and eligible) father must also navigate a new environment of stuffy country clubs, militant PTA's, and pushy neighborhood watch organizations.  He is guided by old college friend and dentist Noah Werner (Alan Tudyk), who attempts to interpret the new rules for George.  George also gets some help from good-hearted but over-the-top female neighbor Dallas Royce (Cheryl Hines), who goes out of her way to help Tessa adjust; she may also have an agenda planned for George as well.  Alicia Silverstone makes a late-season appearence as a surrogate mother for Noah and his wife, and a possible love interest for George (and, of course, an inside joke for those who saw the movie ""Clueless"").  The interaction between Tessa and George is sometimes the best part of the show, as they take turns being the adult in their rather unique father-daughter relationship.The comedy is consistently good, and the show is willing to pursue its humor over, around, and through any number of stereotypes associated with American suburbia.

However, I thought I would chime in anyway =:)I generally have no tolerance for 30-minute programs either in real time or on-demand, as with 8-minutes (30%) of commercials there is too much fast forward for what amounts to 22-minutes of programming time.  The solution for moi has been to wait for the season to end and then purchase the season series where I can watch blocks of episodes interrupted only by the changing of the discs.I starting watching Suburgatory during the mid season semester break (AKA TV dead zone).  There were few options and my on-demand had all episodes broadcast to date.  I found the show to be a witty enough comedy with wise cracking Levy as an appealing character in the land of ""plastic"" that is Suburgatory.Advance apologies for my being overly familiar, though I tend to refer to actors either by prior roles or last names.  Suburgatory has an excellent cast around Levy.  I really like Alpha from ""The Dollhouse"" taking a stab at comedy, as Sisto's (Levy's dad) best friend.  Hines (Dallas) is M..F personified and being a betting man, I would give even money on a future hook-up with Sisto.  Lloyd from ""Entourage"" (coming dangerously close to being type cast - if he cares) is very good as the school Principal and perhaps my favorite character is ""dead pan"" Dahlia (Hine's daughter), as Levy's nemesis.  Not sure how I feel about Sisto in a comedy role?I subtracted a 1/2-star for the introduction of Silverstone as a surrogate and girlfriend to Sisto.  I actually found the storyline to be mildly annoying!  Amazing that when ""Clueless"" came out that AS was considered to be the savior of Sony Studios.  She has fallen so far out of the ""A-List"" to be placed as an additional character on a moderately successful comedy sitcom.Suburgatory is one of those programs where while watching is entertaining, though I tend not to think too much about it after and would not morn if it went away.",3,"3 1/2-Stars!

1492789,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005LAJ1ZE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","When ABC positioned its new sitcom ""Suburgatory"" between the wildly underrated ""The Middle"" and the consistently charming ""Modern Family,"" it had a cushy slot between two of my favorite shows on TV. But I was a bit skeptical. I have liked star Jeremy Sisto for years, but never envisioned him headlining a weekly comedy. And the idea of city folk making fun of the suburbs has been a topic of humor for decades. As I tuned in for the premiere, the show scored a number of easy laughs--maybe too easy. Truthfully, the program felt dated. I felt like the same sitcom with the same jokes could have been on in the eighties or the nineties. That's how familiar the suburban satire premise appeared. But as the season progressed, I found myself liking the show more and more as it found an increasingly unique voice. Through witty scripts, eccentric plot lines, and especially a deft comic ensemble of actors--""Suburgatory"" fully came into its own. It may not qualify as TV's best sitcom, but it is solidly entertaining and appealing.The basic set-up involves Sisto bringing his daughter (Jane Levy) into the clean living suburbs from their existence in New York City. Of course, they both love the city but Sisto thinks this is the best option for raising his teenaged girl. Levy, very Emma Stone-esque, is perfect as the wizened yet cynical protagonist. She and Sisto view their new home as a Wonderland of eccentricity and early episodes play largely off this fish-out-of-water concept. Both smart and funny, Levy brings a contemporary edge that helps to buoy the more well-worn elements of the initial storylines. As they get to know their neighbors, we do as well. And this is where the show really starts to shine as an ensemble piece. Among the cast, there is Ana Gasteyer (as the no-nonsense rule maker), Cheryl Hines (as the spoiled socialite) and Alan Tudyk (as Sisto's competitive best friend). There is also a talented young cast for Levy to play off of as she tries to adjust to her surroundings.While Levy is certainly the focal point of the show, the supporting characters all got stronger and more pronounced as the year went on. One of the show's more intriguing story line involves an increasing flirtation between Hines and Sisto and there is a funny rivalry between Hine's daughter and Levy. As with every sitcom, you might not fully love every plot thread. Late in the season, Alicia Silverstone has a romantic arc with Sisto that I was never particularly crazy for (it included a surrogate pregnancy angle that didn't really work for me either). But the appeal of the show is that the actors are game and energetic and sell the material. Gasteyer, for my taste, is absolute perfection (she's not even in the starring credits). Every time she's on screen. she serves up a laugh (double points when she's with her husband played by Chris Parnell). And Hines is deceptively complex, this is a real change of pace from her years on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" But everyone is fully committed to the madness, which is oftentimes slapstick in nature, and so the show is infectiously fun. And a final shout-out to Jane Levy for making a stock character seem fresh and real. Season One consists of 22 episodes.

My son (16) might go for it now that he knows Jane Levy (who is terrific in this show) is one of the stars of the new remake of EVIL DEAD. Ya never know.

1492792,A2K3ZJWLF0V4K,B005LAJ1ZE,"Rachel Holland ""miribeau""","[1, 2]","Suburgatory is one of those rare gems, a show where everything seems somehow to have gelled, perfectly, effortlessly, remarkably, into a funny, quirky, unique and brilliantly written romp. And yet, it is also just like every other show on television right now: suffering under the boot of the network overlords and their demands for changes to ""make it better"". The focus is an old story made new again: two fish out of water, in this case a father and daughter duo from the tough, modern streets of New York, uprooted and living a new life in the 'burbs, surrounded by an array of ever-present colorful characters who always have something interesting to say or something odd to do so that we, as the viewers, can witness through the eyes of that father and daughter, this bounty of crazy, wacky fun and immerse ourselves vicariously in this new culture.Unfortunately, at a certain point the focus on all the charm and strangeness and meeting of the minds for a better understanding, etc., was replaced by the standard ""let's tell a story about a single dad trying to get laid"" and everything pretty much fell apart. The father dating was not the issue, in fact that is a story that would have worked quite well, had it not taken over the entire show, essentially kicking every other plotline out of the room so that ABC execs could place all of their so-called eggs in the basket that is Alicia Silverstone who became the random and terrible love interest, previously mentioned. Now, I like Alicia Silverstone. I like her as an actress and I respect her as a human being. That being said, the character she is playing on this show is about as grating as any I have seen. Jeremy Sisto may as well be dating Fred Willard for all the good Silverstone's character, Eden, is doing on the program.This show, as envisioned originally, was about a young girl moving to a new town, bucking authority while trying to maintain a close relationship with her father and closest friend, learning about herself by learning about others, helping, almost accidentally, her new friends to find themselves and their own version of teenage rebellion in a society where rebellion might take the form of refusing to wear an oddball outfit to a family gathering or not sending a thank you note. It was about a man who went to college and did all the right things and ended up in a job he's actually really good at and actually enjoys but the pay is, well, crap, and he's never really figured out how to have an adult relationship since his daughter's absentee mother left him (an absentee mother who really never needs to be mentioned or seen because her plotline is resolved before we ever meet this father daughter team but who is mentioned and mentioned again and yet again in another sloppy ABC attempt to try to dramatize a comedy) and so, now, he is living in a suburb where women say things they actually mean and treat him like a human being and he's finding himself finally looking for the secretly held desire: a woman he could introduce to his daughter (a woman he's already met, no spoilers here, just watch the show) and a life he never knew he wanted, one populated by nutballs who have gambling addictions (not the serious kind, the funny kind) and their own secret desires (like opening up a cut crystal paper-weight store or being the best of all the Martha Stewart clones).It was the people that made the first half of this season magnificent and absolutely worth a watch. What it became was a regression into a standardized mold, a story about a man falling uncomfortably in love with a surrogate, who is pregnant with his best friend's child, while discovering his daughter's secret desire for a mother he never knew she wanted and it was this soap opera silliness (the kind that doesn't make you laugh) that ruined it. Here's hoping they get the magic back for season two of this truly outstanding concept comedy. That being said, there was one episode from the later half of the season that measured up to that old standard of magnificent oddity and laugh-until-you-cry  excellence comedy addicts will appreciate: Down Time.
