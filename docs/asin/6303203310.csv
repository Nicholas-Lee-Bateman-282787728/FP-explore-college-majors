362651,A3Q5VYUN1JN4VV,6303203310,"Daniel J. Seitler ""shinybear""","[0, 1]",I finished this tonight. Jack Webb tried to do for newspapers what he did for the police on &#34;Dragnet&#34; here. The odd title &#34;-30-&#34; is used in the newspaper business to mean &#34;the end&#34;. I think the title probably hurt the movie. It's almost like &#34;Airport&#34; set in a newspaper room. Jack Webb (who also produced and directed) is the managing editor and he and his staff work late to get out the morning edition. What seems like a slow news night suddenly changes as a couple big stories break- most notably a little girl lost underground in the rapidly flooding sewers. By the end many of the principal cast members lives have changed. The cast is odd. William &#34;Cannon&#34; Conrad is a loud sarcastic editor always feuding with David Nelson who has a bongo number in the middle of the movie. Also onhand in the newspaper are Joe Flynn and Richard Deacon! The sound track reminded me of the &#34;Ya ya&#34; song from Lolita. It's an oddity but not completely horrible and worthwhile for Jack Webb fans!,3,Airport in a newsroom.,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,1031,"['finished', 'tonight', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'tried', 'do', 'newspapers', 'what', 'did', 'police', '34', 'Dragnet', '34', 'here', 'odd', 'title', '34', '-30-', '34', 'used', 'newspaper', 'business', 'mean', '34', 'end', '34', 'think', 'title', 'probably', 'hurt', 'movie', 'almost', '34', 'Airport', '34', 'set', 'newspaper', 'room', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'directed', 'managing', 'editor', 'staff', 'work', 'late', 'get', 'out', 'morning', 'edition', 'What', 'slow', 'news', 'night', 'suddenly', 'couple', 'big', 'stories', 'break-', 'most', 'notably', 'little', 'girl', 'lost', 'underground', 'rapidly', 'flooding', 'sewers', 'end', 'many', 'principal', 'cast', 'members', 'lives', 'have', 'changed', 'cast', 'odd', 'William', '34', 'Cannon', '34', 'Conrad', 'loud', 'sarcastic', 'editor', 'always', 'feuding', 'David', 'Nelson', 'who', 'bongo', 'number', 'middle', 'movie', 'Also', 'onhand', 'newspaper', 'are', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'Richard', 'Deacon', 'sound', 'track', 'reminded', '34', 'Ya', 'ya', '34', 'song', 'Lolita', 'oddity', 'not', 'completely', 'horrible', 'worthwhile', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'fans']",30 VHS

He and a long list of reasonably well known actors recreate the night shift at a major city newspaper in the 1960s. The pace of the film is very fast which plays into the speed of the news. The script weaves all sorts of stories and characters together in a very good way. It uses the news stories to introduce all sorts of characters who come on screen and then are gone. Its much more light-hearted (with some exceptions) than Webb's usual fare.As with most of Webb's work, the film is obsessed with re-creation, detail and human interest stories. The technical people working at the newspaper even get covered (which I can't ever remember another film doing). William Conrad gives a good performance running the newsroom. It would have been better if the story had gone beyond the newsroom to see various people at work. But its still not a bad little movie from that era.",4,well paced character drama,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,907,"['Jack', 'Webb', 'film', 'long', 'list', 'reasonably', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'recreate', 'night', 'shift', 'major', 'city', 'newspaper', '1960s', 'pace', 'film', 'very', 'fast', 'speed', 'news', 'script', 'sorts', 'stories', 'characters', 'together', 'very', 'good', 'way', 'news', 'introduce', 'sorts', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'screen', 'then', 'are', 'gone', 'much', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'exceptions', 'Webb', 'usual', 'fare.As', 'most', 'Webb', 'work', 'film', 'obsessed', 're-creation', 'detail', 'human', 'interest', 'stories', 'technical', 'people', 'working', 'newspaper', 'even', 'get', 'covered', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'remember', 'film', 'doing', 'William', 'Conrad', 'good', 'performance', 'running', 'newsroom', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'story', 'had', 'gone', 'newsroom', 'see', 'various', 'people', 'work', 'still', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'movie', 'era']",30 VHS

This movie defied every notion I had of the actors and the newsroom formula film.  It was surprising in its building of plot and characters.  It was light-weight, almost comedic at times, heartbreaking and human at others. From Webb's upbeat character who is happily married but still haunted by the loss of a wife and child...to the senior writer who waits for news of her pilot grandson, the movie is build on real emotions and characters.  The at times silly rapport of a team of co-workers is balanced with the tension and sorrow of the news they must cover.  It doesn't matter they are shown working against the clock, pecking away at their typewriters and cutting and pasting their page, the movie is timeless. There is a real- time feel to the film.
