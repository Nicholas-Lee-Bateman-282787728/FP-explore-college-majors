973610,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000EHSVQO,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","Compulsion, 1959 filmThe story begins in 1924 Chicago. Two young men burglarize a fraternity house. They nearly run down a man in the road. Artie gives Judd an order. (This shows their viciousness and depravity.) They have a plan to do another crime. (Are they too smart for their own good?) Judd believes in the writings of Nietzsche (he died of insanity). Artie brags about himself. Another student, Sidney Brooks, works for a newspaper. Tom Daly at the `Globe' gets news about a kidnapping. Brooks visits the morgue, a boy was hit on the head and drowned. Was this the kidnapped boy? Yes. The glasses found by the body do not belong to the victim. Judd also admires Plato (another sick philosopher). [Note Artie's behavior in the group!] Brooks gets stuck with a big bill after Artie ducked out. Judd and Artie rehearse their alibis. Will it work? ""Pride goes before a fall"" because it is based on self-serving assumptions.Artie offers to help the police lieutenant investigating the crime. His advice makes trouble for some people. Artie's conversation shows his depraved personality. Judd also talks crazy to Ruth near where the boy was killed. These boys visit the stockyards where sheep are led to the slaughter. [Symbolism?] Judd is brought in for questioning. Can he explain how he lost his glasses? Judd mentions Artie Strauss for his alibi, so Artie is brought in for questioning on what he did. [This conversation is dramatic.] Reporters gather to ask questions. The chauffeur provides evidence that Judd's Stutz was in the garage that Wednesday! Prosecutor Harold Horne uses an old trick to get an emotional response from Judd, and a confession. Each blames the other. The famous Jonathan Wilk will defend the boys. He tells Art and Judd to say nothing to anyone. [Always good advice to a suspect as it prevents problems from false witnesses.] The defense doctors don't agree with the diagnosis of the accused (Artie is ""paranoid"", Judd is ""schizophrenic"").Jonathan Wilk questions the two about their personal lives. In court Wilk changes the plea to ""guilty"". Wilk believes he has a better chance with the Judge than the jury. Psychiatrists testify about Artie and Judd. Wilk points out that the killing was senseless, an act of madness. Those who plead guilty to murder and were under twenty-one were given life in prison. Wilk asks the Judge to follow this precedent, he places all responsibility on the Judge for deciding the sentence. Wilk claims that harsh sentences create more crime. [Believable?] Wilk's speech is rhetorical. Would hanging Artie and Judd stop the killing? [No, but it would prevent them from doing it again, and that is why the death penalty has been found useful over millenia.] The ending is suitably dramatic.This is a fictionalized version of a famous true crime that shocked America in 1924. Leopold and Loeb killed a young boy to show they were smart enough to get away with it (students of Nietzsche). Edmond Locard noted that every criminal leaves something at the crime scene, and takes something away. Writers like Upton Sinclair and William Jennings Bryan criticized the universities of America as teaching anti-democratic and anti-Christian beliefs. Many Robber Barons founded universities to give support and propaganda for the policies that favored Robber Barons. There is often a hidden agenda to many of their courses. Like other corporate employees, college professors do as they are told. Why do universities push writers like Nietzsche and Plato? To advance the corporate agenda of anti-democracy, which is not in the best interests of the students. Some might assume that the rich have no interest in attacking other people, yet the rich got that way by exploiting the common people.Does the ""Artie Strauss"" character remind you of some co-workers or managers in your corporate environment? Or some current or past politicians?

973611,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000EHSVQO,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","The Jazz Age, the time, the decade or so, right after the war, World War I one if anybody is asking, was a weird time in America in some respects. That was the careless, crime-ridden ""war on alcohol"" age made famous by the like of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, especially the latter for his take on American upward mobility with his unforgettable character Jay Ganz trying to climb up the social anyway he could, no matter the body count, in The Great Gatsby. Of course that was fiction, fiction though that cut to the core, cut to the core like the film under review, Compulsion, was fiction although based on the infamous actions of Leopold and Loeb in Chicago in the 1920s.Apparently our fictionalized lead characters here, Artie and Judd, two young men, boys really, from wealthy Chicago circumstances had spent too much of their spare time reading too many German philosophers, too much Nietzsche,  too seriously, especially those interested in creating a society led by ""supermen,"" the elite guided by no other criterion except pure rationality. No emotional attachments need apply.  And to prove that thesis, to try it out in practice, the pair crudely bludgeon some kid in park and depose of him in culvert after kidnapping him. They assume after such heroics that they have passed beyond the pale of mere mortals and have proven their superiority point. Except for the little problem of those damn glasses that Judd somehow left behind at the crime scene and that did them in posthaste. So from supermen they turned into, well, low- life cellmates in a trial for their lives.While the drama here is driven for a while by trying to corral the pair, trying to dissect their weird motivations, the real claim to fame of this film should be as a rather powerful argument against the death penalty. Certainly the heinous crime they committed was in another age death-penalty worthy but as powerfully articulated by Jonathan Wilk (Orson Welles), as their attorney, that barbaric form of punishment did nothing to deter the mad, the crazy and the socially isolated and offended against our evolving standard of civility. And so powerful was Mister Wilk's presentation that the judge actually gave both men life sentences. Life sentences to stew in their own juices over their views of the word and maybe change their perspectives around mere mortals. And those hardened inmates at Joliet will see to that.",4,Joliet Bound,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,2419,"['Jazz', 'Age', 'time', 'decade', 'so', 'right', 'war', 'World', 'War', 'one', 'anybody', 'asking', 'was', 'weird', 'time', 'America', 'respects', 'was', 'careless', 'crime-ridden', 'war', 'alcohol', 'age', 'made', 'famous', 'like', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'especially', 'latter', 'take', 'American', 'upward', 'mobility', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'Jay', 'Ganz', 'trying', 'climb', 'up', 'social', 'anyway', 'could', 'matter', 'body', 'count', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'course', 'was', 'fiction', 'fiction', 'cut', 'core', 'cut', 'core', 'film', 'review', 'Compulsion', 'was', 'fiction', 'based', 'infamous', 'actions', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'Chicago', '1920s.Apparently', 'fictionalized', 'lead', 'characters', 'here', 'Artie', 'Judd', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'boys', 'really', 'wealthy', 'Chicago', 'circumstances', 'had', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'spare', 'time', 'reading', 'too', 'many', 'German', 'philosophers', 'too', 'much', 'Nietzsche', 'too', 'seriously', 'especially', 'interested', 'creating', 'society', 'led', 'supermen', 'elite', 'guided', 'other', 'criterion', 'pure', 'rationality', 'emotional', 'attachments', 'need', 'apply', 'prove', 'thesis', 'try', 'out', 'practice', 'pair', 'crudely', 'bludgeon', 'kid', 'park', 'depose', 'culvert', 'kidnapping', 'assume', 'such', 'heroics', 'have', 'passed', 'pale', 'mere', 'mortals', 'have', 'proven', 'superiority', 'point', 'little', 'problem', 'damn', 'glasses', 'Judd', 'somehow', 'left', 'behind', 'crime', 'scene', 'did', 'posthaste', 'So', 'supermen', 'turned', 'well', 'low-', 'life', 'cellmates', 'trial', 'lives.While', 'drama', 'here', 'driven', 'while', 'trying', 'corral', 'pair', 'trying', 'dissect', 'weird', 'motivations', 'real', 'claim', 'fame', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'rather', 'powerful', 'argument', 'death', 'penalty', 'Certainly', 'heinous', 'crime', 'committed', 'was', 'age', 'death-penalty', 'worthy', 'powerfully', 'articulated', 'Jonathan', 'Wilk', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'attorney', 'barbaric', 'form', 'punishment', 'did', 'nothing', 'deter', 'mad', 'crazy', 'socially', 'isolated', 'offended', 'evolving', 'standard', 'civility', 'so', 'powerful', 'was', 'Mister', 'Wilk', 'presentation', 'judge', 'actually', 'gave', 'men', 'life', 'sentences', 'Life', 'sentences', 'stew', 'own', 'juices', 'views', 'word', 'maybe', 'change', 'perspectives', 'mere', 'mortals', 'hardened', 'inmates', 'Joliet', 'will', 'see']",N/A
973612,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000EHSVQO,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 7]","Loosely based off the truly heinous crime committed by the Loeb and Leopold boys, `Compulsion' is at times chilling and very effective; but still, there are moments (and even long stretches) where that affect wears off and leaves us with a half-hearted attempt at thrilling.The film opens rather over-the-top and somewhat irritatingly as it introduces us to Judd Steiner and Arthur Straus.  Straus is the obvious ringleader, bossy and controlling, while Judd almost cowers to his every whim in hopes of approval.  Once the title of the film flashes across the screen these two actors (Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman) ease into their characters and actually pull out two very entertaining and realistic portrayals of sick young men vying for attention in all the wrong places.  When their determination to `experience everything' gets the best of them and they go too far (murdering a young boy) they find themselves working up a convoluted story in order to free themselves from speculation, but as their story unravels they are left at the mercy of a jury and the District Attorney.Insert Orson Welles as Jonathan Wilk, the boys' lawyer.The film is essentially two halves of one whole.  The first half is all about Steiner and Straus and their crime, while the second half is primarily about the abolishment of the death penalty.  Welles closing arguments in particular are an outstanding example in persuasion as he attacks the concept of calculated murder in any instance; even court ordered.  My problem is that the lack of focus leaves the films resulted moral rather unfinished.  It just doesn't mesh as well as it could have.  When you look at films like `Dead Man Walking', that tackled the same line of logic but with much greater results (due to a more eloquent and woven structure), you can see where this film missed the mark in areas.The acting across the board is very good, especially from Stockwell and Dillman, who as I said really sunk into their characters.  That opening scene (""Hit him!"") was far too over-the-top, but once it was over the actors found their stride and stuck with it.  Much has been said about Orson, and I personally consider him one of the greatest actors of all time, and one of the greatest influences on cinema, but his performance here was a little stale for me.  In fact, the stand out supporting performance in my opinion comes from E.G. Marshall, who nailed the tough position of District Attorney Harold Horn.  Just look at his facial expressions as Welles is delivering his final speech.  Watch every word sink in.Genius.In parts this is a very well done film, and those parts make this more than worth checking out at least once.  Whether or not you decide it is worth revisiting is completely up to your perception of the film.  I like what it has to say, I just don't think it is as effective as it could have been in saying it.  Some very good acting saves it from falling completely off the map for me; but as far as legal thrillers are concerned, this same year sports `Anatomy of a Murder', which is a much better film all around.",3,"It doesn't completely work, but its redeeming features make it worth checking out...",1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,3091,"['Loosely', 'based', 'off', 'truly', 'heinous', 'crime', 'committed', 'Loeb', 'Leopold', 'boys', 'Compulsion', 'times', 'chilling', 'very', 'effective', 'still', 'are', 'moments', 'even', 'long', 'stretches', 'where', 'affect', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'thrilling.The', 'film', 'rather', 'over-the-top', 'somewhat', 'irritatingly', 'Judd', 'Steiner', 'Arthur', 'Straus', 'Straus', 'obvious', 'ringleader', 'bossy', 'controlling', 'Judd', 'almost', 'cowers', 'whim', 'hopes', 'approval', 'title', 'film', 'flashes', 'screen', 'two', 'actors', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Bradford', 'Dillman', 'ease', 'characters', 'actually', 'pull', 'out', 'two', 'very', 'entertaining', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'sick', 'young', 'men', 'vying', 'attention', 'wrong', 'places', 'When', 'determination', 'experience', 'everything', 'best', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'murdering', 'young', 'boy', 'find', 'working', 'up', 'convoluted', 'story', 'order', 'free', 'speculation', 'story', 'are', 'left', 'mercy', 'jury', 'District', 'Attorney.Insert', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Jonathan', 'Wilk', 'boys', 'lawyer.The', 'film', 'essentially', 'two', 'halves', 'one', 'whole', 'first', 'half', 'Steiner', 'Straus', 'crime', 'second', 'half', 'primarily', 'abolishment', 'death', 'penalty', 'closing', 'arguments', 'particular', 'are', 'outstanding', 'example', 'persuasion', 'concept', 'calculated', 'murder', 'instance', 'even', 'court', 'ordered', 'problem', 'lack', 'focus', 'films', 'resulted', 'moral', 'rather', 'unfinished', 'just', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'When', 'look', 'films', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'tackled', 'same', 'line', 'logic', 'much', 'greater', 'results', 'due', 'more', 'eloquent', 'woven', 'structure', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'film', 'missed', 'mark', 'areas.The', 'acting', 'board', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Stockwell', 'Dillman', 'who', 'said', 'really', 'sunk', 'characters', 'opening', 'scene', 'Hit', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'was', 'actors', 'found', 'stride', 'stuck', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'Orson', 'personally', 'consider', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'time', 'one', 'greatest', 'influences', 'cinema', 'performance', 'here', 'was', 'little', 'stale', 'fact', 'stand', 'out', 'supporting', 'performance', 'opinion', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'who', 'nailed', 'tough', 'position', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Harold', 'Horn', 'Just', 'look', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Welles', 'delivering', 'final', 'speech', 'Watch', 'word', 'sink', 'in.Genius.In', 'parts', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'parts', 'make', 'more', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'least', 'once', 'not', 'decide', 'worth', 'revisiting', 'completely', 'perception', 'film', 'like', 'what', 'say', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'effective', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'saying', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'saves', 'falling', 'completely', 'map', 'as', 'far', 'legal', 'thrillers', 'are', 'concerned', 'same', 'year', 'sports', 'Anatomy', 'Murder', 'much', 'better', 'film']",N/A

I WAS NOT familiar with that case when I viewed the movie.  From the onset of the film, I suspected some weird relationship between the two protagonists, possibly homosexual, definitely HERO WORSHIP on the part of Judd for Artie.  Dean Stockwell's character, Juddsie or Judd, is excellently acted. The Artie character is as well.  The writing is wonderful.  The movie provides fascinating insight into characters who are well developed that portray amazing intellects, but, the tragedy is, they find no suitable acceptable outlet for their superior minds.  They disdain society, their families, and what they perceive to be intellectually inferior authorities - the police and the justice system.  After their mental sickness is extracted for display in the courtroom scenes, Judd recognizes his illness and seems desirous that he could have maybe overcome it to form a relationship with one girl who did connect with him, Ruthie.  These two, Artie and Judd, are pretty far gone and even after the court does show them mercy from the death penalty, they are incapable of gratitude.

Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman portray Judd Steiner and Arthur Strauss. I'd have to refer back to the documentary on Leopold-Loeb to work out which is which. Strauss is the dominant one, the one most nearly evil in the classic sense of the term. He's the one who wants to run down a drunk in the road just because he feels like it. Judd turns the wheel away, but also tells Strauss he will do anything Strauss tells him to, that he wants Strauss to lead and order him.Some time is spent on the police work that went into discovering the identities of the killers, but it has the effect of showing that there is no effective defense on the facts, especially since both boys made confessions. OK, partly as accusing one another, but that matters little in such a crime.Things look pretty much like an inevitable hanging when the boys' wealthy parents hire Jonathan Wilk (Orson Welles) to defend them.

973623,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000EHSVQO,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[36, 40]","Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb were two intellectually gifted, extremely wealthy young men of 1920s Chicago--but they were also highly neurotic.  In 1924 their twisted relationship exploded into one of the most infamous crimes of the era: largely in order to demonstrate their supposed intellectual superiority, they kidnapped and murdered fourteen year old Bobby Franks.  But their ""perfect crime"" was not quite as perfect as they had thought: it quickly unraveled, and with the celebrated Clarence Darrow appearing for the defense the court case became as legendary as the crime.The 1959 film COMPULSION, based on the Leopold-Loeb case, had a great deal going for it.  The cast was superior and included a Hollywood legend; director Richard Fleischer was a rock-solid craftsman; production values from cinematography to composer to costumer were in experienced and capable hands.  But the film ran afoul of two issues: censorship codes of the day, which effectively prevented a no-holds-barred re-telling of the case, and the fact that Nathan Leopold was still very much alive.The result was a script that transformed Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb into characters named 'Judd Steiner' and 'Artie Straus' and which renamed Clarence Darrow 'Jonathan Wilk'--and which can only imply in vaguest possible terms aspects of the case that most find particularly fascinating.  With so much detail thrown out, the result is a film that divides into two rather awkwardly joined parts.The first half of the film focuses on Steiner and Straus.  The cast is indeed exceptional, with Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman extremely effective and receiving memorable support from the likes of Diane Varsi and Martin Milner.  Still, it is more a matter of implication rather than specification, and even the crime itself is somewhat glossed over.  The second half of the film brings in Orson Wells as attorney Wilk and unexpectedly shifts focus away from the killers and their crime, leaving Wells to dominate the screen with a series of powerful speeches. The ending of the film is remarkably abrupt and fails to tie the film together.When all is said and done, COMPULSION never quite manages to live up to its potential.  The memorable performances and stylish look of the film make it more than worth seeing, but any one who is familar with the Leopold-Loeb case will be disappointed--and even those who aren't will likely consider that one viewing is enough.  At present the film is only available to the homemarket on video in a pan-and-scan version that doesn't help it along.  Recommended--but only just.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Ellen R.

973630,A1ZQYRVSZDI42J,B000EHSVQO,"Julie L. Hayes ""bibliophile""","[2, 2]","Compulsion is the fictionalized account of the crime of the century--the kidnapping and murder of a young boy by two bored and wealthy young geniuses--which led to the trial of the century in which one of the most famous attorneys ever argued for their lives. This is the film version of that book, which came out in 1959, the year after Nathan Leopold (aka Judd Steiner) was paroled and released from prison.Having recently acquired an interest in Leopold and Loeb, and having read and reviewed the book Compulsion, it seemed only natural that I should watch and review the film with a critical eye toward seeing how well the book was translated onto the screen. I must say it was done very well.We first meet Judd Steiner (Dean Stockwell) and Artie Straus (Bradford Dillman) as they are gallivanting about in Judd's Stutz Bearcat and Artie tries to run down a drunken man who's walking down the road. This sets the tone, not only for the film, but for their relationship. Judd grabs the wheel and averts the potential murder, so Artie tells him to drive (keep in mind, it is Judd's car), and then orders him to run the bum down. Judd comes close, but at the last moment swerves, which angers Artie. To keep peace, Judd swears he'll do anything Artie wants. Anything. And although we don't know it yet, a murder is about to be born.Martin Milner (later famed for his role in Adam 12, among other things) plays Sid Brooks (a fictional character, based on Meyer Levin), a fellow student at the university with Judd and Artie, and a fledgling reporter for the newspaper. Chance involves him in the case, and also his girl Ruth, who develops a relationship with Judd and later testifies at the trial.This is a very faithful adaptation of the novel and captures the flavor of it very well. The cocksure attitude of the young geniuses who took the life of a young boy because they could, and to prove that such a thing could be done with great deliberation and no emotional involvement. We never see the victim, not even in the morgue, nor do we get a real sense of who he was. These things were not shown back then, too graphic. Today, I'm sure there would be a lot more gruesome scenes, but the film does not suffer for lack of them.They came close to getting away with their crime, but a pair of eyeglasses was the crack in the facade that became the first clue, and that ultimately led to them. E.G. Marshall plays the prosecutor, Horn, who is determined to see these two boys hang for what they've done, despite their tender ages--18 and 19--and despite the fact that never has the state put to death anyone below the age of 21.The boys' very wealthy parents hire the best attorney they can find--Jonathan Wilk (Clarence Darrow, in real life)--flawlessly played by Orson Welles. In a brilliant ploy, Wilk withdraws their plea of not guilty and changes it to guilty, with mitigating circumstances, thus eliminating the trial by jury. And despite the best efforts of the prosecutor, he does not plead insanity, as that would bring the jury back in. And as he explains to the boys' parents, he'd rather plead for their lives before one man, the judge, than twelve, in the form of the jury.Welles' performance is riveting. Despite being very familiar with him as an actor, his persona disappears and he becomes Wilk/Darrow, and his very eloquent summation speech is some of his finest work. That is the hallmark of a great actor, when you stop seeing the man, and only see the character.Although physically I thought the main characters were mis-cast, as Dean Stockwell resembled Artie more, and Bradford Dillman Judd, in terms of performance, they got the nuances of the characters down pat. Artie, the effervescent know-it-all who dominates Judd, and has to be in on everything, including ""helping"" the police with the case. The quieter, more introspective Judd, who allows Artie to control him.What you won't see in the movie that isin the book, and what is barely hinted at in the film (and you really need to be looking for it to catch it) is the true nature of the relationship between Judd and Artie, namely that they were lovers. Any mention of what the book presents has been excised, probably due to the sensibilities of the times. I don't think it would have played well, and probably would have muddied the waters. Today? Another story altogether.One comment on the opening music--although probably good for its time, now it sounded to me very 50ish and jarring, but perhaps that was the effect the composer was going for. It's jazzy and discordant, so maybe that's the right feel for two young men out of step with society.Look for Richard Anderson (Six Million Dollar Man) as Judd's bossy older brother Max. And a young Gavin MacLeod (Captain Steubing on the Love Boat) as Horn's assistant.Also on the DVD were the theatrical trailer and a teaser and two trailers from other Fox films--St. Valentine's Day Massacre (Jason Robards Jr) and Murder Inc. (Stuart Whitman and Peter Falk).One last comment on the film. As I said before, Judd was just beginning a relationship with Ruth Evans, who was Sid Brooks' girl, and I think that goes a long way to show his innate humanity, as opposed to Artie and his black book, his love 'em and leave 'em philosophy. There is a very intense scene between Judd and Ruth in the film.On the whole, I was very pleased with the film, and highly recommend it.",5,They did it because they could...,1372464000,"06 29,

973632,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B000EHSVQO,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[2, 3]","This is one of multiple films based on the Leopold and Loeb case. The film is basically done in halves. In the first half, Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman chew the scenery. Neither performance seemed very convincing. The problem of course is that given the times they can't really do it the way it would need to be done. The script also seems to tend toward making them more socially adjusted than they perhaps were. They are also being played older than perhaps they were.The second half of the film is a set-piece where Orson Welles does essentially a long dramatic speech. Content apart, its impossible to deny the power of Welles as a speaker and actor. Its similiar to what he did in Moby Dick. But its disconnected from the rest of the film and as good as it is, it has a ""mailed in"" quality to it.The trial itself is a farce. The judge plays it as if he is in the pocket of the defense. E.G. Marshall is a good actor, but he is not allowed to do anything. It would have been far more powerful to let him make an impassioned reply to the arguments Welles makes, but its not that kind of film. That Welles and his speech are so carefully protected weakens it considerably for me. They might well not have bothered giving anyone else lines during the courtroom scenes.Additionally, the film somehow gives the impression that Darrow simply on a whim in court decided to change the plea to guilty without any consultation of his clients. That is just weird.As with most things involving Darrow, the real case was a press farce. Two rich boys just happen to draw a judge whose pet cause is juvinile justice in a city which was not know in the first place for executions of the young and the predictable happend. Darrow's long political speech was more important in terms of press coverage for Darrow than it was to the case. The film also might have raised questions about Darrow's altruism and his reasoning for taking the case. Fees are one thing, but a national platform with daily press coverage is priceless.The worst part of the film is the ending. Its not true to the real Darrow at all. Nor is the subsequent history of the two even mentioned. One is murdered in prison and the other is eventually released.If you want to hear an impassioned speech against capital punishment, Welles does it about a good as it can be done. I think his argument was better and tighter than the original given by Darrow in court....at least from what I've read from extractions.But there is a whole lot of uninteresting film to sit through to get to the speech.",2,not very good aside from the Welles speech,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,2556,"['one', 'multiple', 'films', 'based', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'case', 'film', 'basically', 'done', 'halves', 'first', 'half', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Bradford', 'Dillman', 'scenery', 'performance', 'seemed', 'very', 'convincing', 'problem', 'course', 'given', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'way', 'would', 'need', 'be', 'done', 'script', 'also', 'tend', 'making', 'more', 'socially', 'adjusted', 'perhaps', 'were', 'are', 'also', 'being', 'played', 'older', 'perhaps', 'were.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'set-piece', 'where', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'essentially', 'long', 'dramatic', 'speech', 'Content', 'apart', 'impossible', 'deny', 'power', 'Welles', 'speaker', 'actor', 'similiar', 'what', 'did', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'disconnected', 'rest', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'mailed', 'quality', 'it.The', 'trial', 'farce', 'judge', 'pocket', 'defense', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'allowed', 'do', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'let', 'make', 'impassioned', 'reply', 'arguments', 'Welles', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'Welles', 'speech', 'are', 'so', 'carefully', 'protected', 'considerably', 'might', 'well', 'not', 'have', 'bothered', 'giving', 'anyone', 'else', 'lines', 'courtroom', 'scenes.Additionally', 'film', 'somehow', 'impression', 'Darrow', 'simply', 'whim', 'court', 'decided', 'change', 'plea', 'guilty', 'consultation', 'clients', 'just', 'weird.As', 'most', 'things', 'involving', 'Darrow', 'real', 'case', 'was', 'press', 'farce', 'Two', 'rich', 'boys', 'just', 'happen', 'draw', 'judge', 'pet', 'cause', 'juvinile', 'justice', 'city', 'was', 'not', 'know', 'first', 'place', 'executions', 'young', 'predictable', 'happend', 'Darrow', 'long', 'political', 'speech', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'terms', 'press', 'coverage', 'Darrow', 'was', 'case', 'film', 'also', 'might', 'have', 'raised', 'questions', 'Darrow', 'altruism', 'reasoning', 'taking', 'case', 'Fees', 'are', 'one', 'thing', 'national', 'platform', 'daily', 'press', 'coverage', 'priceless.The', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'ending', 'not', 'true', 'real', 'Darrow', 'subsequent', 'history', 'two', 'even', 'mentioned', 'One', 'murdered', 'prison', 'other', 'eventually', 'released.If', 'want', 'hear', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'capital', 'punishment', 'Welles', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'think', 'argument', 'was', 'better', 'tighter', 'original', 'given', 'Darrow', 'court', 'least', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'extractions.But', 'whole', 'lot', 'uninteresting', 'film', 'sit', 'get', 'speech']",N/A

973635,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B000EHSVQO,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[3, 6]","'Compulsion' is the brilliantly-performed film of a shocking event.  Two young men, after reading Nietsche and speculating on their own world-shaking intellects, decide to commit the perfect murder--a thrill kill.  They kidnap a young boy, murder him, dispose of the corpse, then toy with the police to lead them in the wrong direction and indulge their egos.Of course, it all goes wrong...otherwise there would have never been a trial, books and movies.  The killers are tied in the cord of their own 'brilliance.'This film, in fact, is two films rolled into one.  The first, and to my way of thinking the most interesting, film is the first...the story of the crime and the two murderers.  The second film starts abruptly on the arrest of the killers.  Orson Wells enters the movie as the ponderous, anti-capital punishment, defense attorney [Clarence Darrow in real life].  After first pleading 'Not Guilty', then observing the faces of the jurers, he abruptly changes the verdict to 'Guilty, with Mitigating Circumstances.'  This means that the jury must be removed and the case tried by only the judge.On the other hand, should Darrow aruge an 'Insanity' Defense, a jury must again be empanelled.  Nevertheless, Darrow brings 'experts' to the stand who testify that the killers are mentally deranged and one killer is diagnosed as 'schizophrenic'.  Somehow the judge lets all these shenanigans stand [remember Judge Ito?] so, despite the bias of the movie/directors/producers/writers, we know the bias of the judge.  He WILL return life imprisonment verdicts i.e. no capital punishment.  Nevertheless, Darrow goes on to passionately argue the immorality of capital punishment...and...might I say, his speeches are impressive.Still I downgraded this otherwise excellent movie from 5 to 4 stars because this is a film with a heavy-handed message, which is just another word for bias, prejudice and propaganda.  In that I am thoroughly sick of high school-dropout film makers preaching to the rest of the rest of us, I downgraded this one star and maybe should have downgraded it more.So what is the 'message' and propaganda?  It's the same as Capote's 'In Cold Blood'.  No matter how heinous a crime, the death verdict is NEVER justified.  Why?  Because, ultimately, no one is really, REALLY, responsible for his/her actions.  The fault is that of mothers, fathers, society and/or environment.  Afterall, anyone who does anything awful can't be sane....can he?  If he's not sane, how can we execute him?But I would turn this argument inside out.  If we...in an ultimate sense...are not responsible, how can we put ANYONE in prison?  Truly, it's not really a question of the death penalty, it's a matter of punishment.  If we aren't responsible, how is it possible that we can be punished?  Isn't it immoral?  Personally, I don't know, but do know this:  A society...any society...that acts as if the individual bears no responsibility, is finished.Ron Braithwaite, author of novels...'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'...on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico.",4,Propaganda,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,3058,"[""'Compulsion"", 'brilliantly-performed', 'film', 'shocking', 'event', 'Two', 'young', 'men', 'reading', 'Nietsche', 'speculating', 'own', 'world-shaking', 'intellects', 'decide', 'commit', 'perfect', 'murder', 'thrill', 'kill', 'kidnap', 'young', 'boy', 'murder', 'dispose', 'corpse', 'then', 'toy', 'police', 'lead', 'wrong', 'direction', 'indulge', 'egos.Of', 'course', 'wrong', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'trial', 'books', 'movies', 'killers', 'are', 'tied', 'cord', 'own', ""'brilliance"", 'film', 'fact', 'two', 'films', 'rolled', 'one', 'first', 'way', 'thinking', 'most', 'interesting', 'film', 'first', 'story', 'crime', 'two', 'murderers', 'second', 'film', 'abruptly', 'arrest', 'killers', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'movie', 'ponderous', 'anti-capital', 'punishment', 'defense', 'attorney', '[', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'real', 'life', ']', 'first', 'pleading', 'Guilty', 'then', 'observing', 'jurers', 'abruptly', 'verdict', ""'Guilty"", 'Mitigating', 'Circumstances', 'jury', 'must', 'be', 'removed', 'case', 'tried', 'only', 'judge.On', 'other', 'hand', 'should', 'Darrow', 'aruge', ""'Insanity"", 'Defense', 'jury', 'must', 'again', 'be', 'empanelled', 'Nevertheless', 'Darrow', ""'experts"", 'stand', 'who', 'killers', 'are', 'mentally', 'deranged', 'one', 'killer', 'diagnosed', ""'schizophrenic"", 'Somehow', 'judge', 'shenanigans', 'stand', '[', 'remember', 'Judge', 'Ito', ']', 'so', 'bias', 'movie/directors/producers/writers', 'know', 'bias', 'judge', 'WILL', 'return', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'verdicts', 'i.e', 'capital', 'punishment', 'Nevertheless', 'Darrow', 'passionately', 'argue', 'immorality', 'capital', 'punishment', 'might', 'say', 'speeches', 'are', 'impressive.Still', 'downgraded', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'movie', '5', '4', 'stars', 'film', 'heavy-handed', 'message', 'just', 'word', 'bias', 'prejudice', 'propaganda', 'am', 'thoroughly', 'sick', 'high', 'school-dropout', 'film', 'makers', 'preaching', 'rest', 'rest', 'downgraded', 'one', 'star', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'downgraded', 'more.So', 'what', ""'message"", 'propaganda', 'same', 'Capote', ""'In"", 'Cold', 'Blood', 'matter', 'how', 'heinous', 'crime', 'death', 'verdict', 'NEVER', 'justified', 'Why', 'ultimately', 'one', 'really', 'REALLY', 'responsible', 'his/her', 'actions', 'fault', 'mothers', 'fathers', 'society', 'and/or', 'environment', 'Afterall', 'anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'awful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sane', '.can', 'not', 'sane', 'how', 'can', 'execute', 'would', 'turn', 'argument', 'ultimate', 'sense', 'are', 'not', 'responsible', 'how', 'can', 'put', 'ANYONE', 'prison', 'Truly', 'not', 'really', 'question', 'death', 'penalty', 'matter', 'punishment', 'are', ""n't"", 'responsible', 'how', 'possible', 'can', 'be', 'punished', ""n't"", 'immoral', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', 'know', 'society', 'society', 'individual', 'responsibility', 'finished.Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'novels', 'Rack', ""'Hummingbird"", 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",N/A
973636,A1ADZQOL0PLBEW,B000EHSVQO,Scadhog,"[2, 3]","Magnificent thriller/police procedural/courtroom drama based on the infamous Leopold/Loeb murder case that took place in 1920's Chicago.  Two teenagers (Bradford Dillman and Dean Stockwell) kill a ten-year old boy to experience the thrill of it and to show their contempt for the rules of society.  In court they are represented by a famous lawyer (Orson Welles) who is known for taking on hopeless cases.  The lawyer chooses to focus, not on the guilt of the two (which is admitted) but rather on trying to keep them from receiving the death penalty.The often erratic Welles gives one of the best performances of his career.  Especially effective is his long monologue at the end of the film in which he pleads for the judge to spare these obviously deranged boys.  Dillman is chilling as the leader of the pair of murderers.  The scene where he interrogates Stockwell while talking to a teddy bear is particularly effective.  Stockwell is the less interesting of the two, but he does a fine job as the weak, subservient accomplice to Dillman.  Most of the rest of the supporting cast, including E.G. Marshall and Martin Milner, is fine as well.  The one exception is Diane Varsi as the girl who comes to Stockwell's defense.  She is as stiff and wooden as a piece of lumber.  The trailer advertises her as ""Academy Award nominee for `Peyton Place'.""  One can only hope she did a much better job in that film.  Needless to say, she was not nominated for this one.This must have been something of a controversial movie in its day.  Not only is Welles' monologue a scathing attack on capital punishment, widespread in the 1950's, but the homosexuality of the teenagers is all but stated bluntly.  The district attorney accuses Stockwell of never having a girlfriend, clearly indicating that Dillman was his boyfriend.  The master/slave relationship between him and Dillman is boldly stated in an early scene.
