The soundtrack, the acting, the directing - all totally commendable, I loved it all.I never thought that I would be watching a love story and a heart-breaking one at that. It was really emotional and believable and I really felt for the characters. For someone who is still searching for her longtime companion, I was undoubtedly sorrowful when tragedy struck just as the love between the two lead characters were blossoming beautifully. It was a truly premature end to something sweet. Worse still, this film is based on a true story.I must repeat - the performances and musical score are truly outstanding. I still could not believe it myself actually.

Barry was a soldier who was assigned to the 101st airborne division and he fell in love with Calpernia after watching her perform at a ""drag"" nightclub and theatre. Eventually a witch-hunt was persued under the DADT laws which was further helped by his back-stabbing roomate Justin Fisher who initiated it. Without giving too many details it results in tragedy for Addams and especially Winchell. The movie helps focus on the influence of the DADT laws in the creation of the tragedy that struck Winchell and its influence in generating a homophobic environment. Winchells parents were involved with pressing for re-examination of the DADT policys within the military and the real Calpernia Addams currently does transgender activism and continues to create television and theatre works.",5,Really Good.... but left me sad all day!,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,883,"['movie', 'true', 'love', 'story', 'Calpernia', 'Addams', 'Barry', 'Winchell', 'set', '1999', 'Barry', 'was', 'soldier', 'who', 'was', 'assigned', '101st', 'airborne', 'division', 'fell', 'love', 'Calpernia', 'watching', 'perform', 'drag', 'nightclub', 'theatre', 'Eventually', 'witch-hunt', 'was', 'persued', 'DADT', 'laws', 'was', 'further', 'helped', 'back-stabbing', 'roomate', 'Justin', 'Fisher', 'who', 'initiated', 'giving', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'results', 'tragedy', 'Addams', 'especially', 'Winchell', 'movie', 'focus', 'influence', 'DADT', 'laws', 'creation', 'tragedy', 'struck', 'Winchell', 'influence', 'generating', 'homophobic', 'environment', 'parents', 'were', 'involved', 'pressing', 're-examination', 'DADT', 'policys', 'military', 'real', 'Calpernia', 'Addams', 'currently', 'transgender', 'activism', 'create', 'television', 'theatre', 'works']",N/A

782148,A31RY1WMDBPAYT,B0000JD29M,calvinyw,"[6, 7]","Most gay-themed movies tend to be less refined and have a low-budget feel. (Even the highly-regarded ""Boys Don't Cry"" showed the same shortcoming, although its raw passion more than made up for it). With that in mind, I wasn't expecting much from this movie.It turned out to be better than I expected, if not by much. The story line could be a little more coherent and the movie should spend more time to develop the plot and the characters. For example, not enough details are given on how Winchell becomes attracted to Calpernia and get over the fact that she's a he, how their relationship evolved from attraction to love, or how Fisher's sudden jealousy turned into anger.On the other hand, the performance of the three actors are nothing less than stunning. Troy Garity successfully conveyed the struggle of a simple guy who's not an intellectual, but determined to be a good soldier and true to his love. Lee Pace brought Calpernia to life with such grace and beauty that it's just simple amazing. And finally, Shawn Hatosy, who played Winchell's roommate Fisher, turned a 2-dimensional stereotype into someone who's manipulative, destructive, but also has hopes and desires, who's confused but remained true to his redneck root. It's a complicated role, yet he made it so realistic. In my opinion, Shawn Hatosy gave the best performance of this movie.3 stars for the movie and 5 stars for the performance of the 3 leading actors.

This film, based on the murder of Barry Winchell, is a testament to good film making, good direction and incredible acting.  This could have been a movie that focused on the sensationalism of the subject matter but the director made this into a respectful and heart breaking love story.The story is about a young man based at Fort Cambell, Kentucky, and the harrassment he suffers from those in his barracks over a relationship he begins with a transgendered performer named Calpernia.  After meeting her at a club in Nashville, Tennessee, the young private becomes smitten and falls in love, a decision that ultimately leads to his mistreatment by other soldiers and eventually his death.Troy Garity gives a dignified performance and deserved the attention and the award nominations he received for this role.  Lee Pace also does well in his role as Calpernia, the transgendered woman that Barry falls in love with.  Shawn Hatosy plays Justin, the young man who sets all the tragic events in emotion.  He is a disturbed young man, with a drinking and drug problem with prejudices that he cannot get past.The dvd also features interviews with the actors as well as the real Calpernia and the mother of victim, Barry Winchell.  The dvd is a good dvd overall but it is the film and its message of love and accepting people as they are that is the most important aspect you should take away from this movie.

Barry is taken to a nightclub by his obnoxious and self-destructive roommate Fisher as a test to see if he is gay or straight.

782159,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000JD29M,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","SOLDIER'S GIRL was released in 2003, a landmark, brave film that stirred a lot of controversy as well as a lot of plaudits for the superb work of cinema that it was.  The story was written by Ron Nyswander ('Philadelphia', 'The Painted Veil', 'Mrs. Soffel' etc) and the director was Frank Pierson, also aligned with many important films as both writer and director ('Dog Day Afternoon', 'Cool Hand Luke', 'A Star is Born', 'Truman', 'Citizen Cohn', 'Presumed Innocent', etc). Obviously made on a low budget, the corners were cut where they should have been, not on the quality of the cast or the impact of the story.  It was and remains a brilliant film.Barry Winchell (Troy Garity)  is a sensitive, quiet soldier who is manacled by a homophobic roommate Justin Fisher (Shawn Hatosy).  Justin takes Barry to a nightclub where the performers are 'guys in drag' as a challenge to understand Barry's somewhat subdued nature.  There Barry observes performer Calpernia Addams (Lee Pace) and despite the negative atmosphere Justin has created, Barry connects with Calpernia.  Calpernia is working to get the money to have her final transgendersurgery: the reason she works in the club is to make enough to pay the bills and save for her surgery.  Barry and Calpernia become a couple despite all the cautions they fully see.  Barry's fellow soldier's do not understand how Barry can be attached to a 'freak' and despite Barry's love for Calpernia and Calpernia's protective outlook for Barry, the relationship is tested daily.  Barry is ostracized by his soldier 'friends' and in a brutally honest scene, Barry is beaten to death by Fisher.  How Calpernia endures and the fate of the perpetrators is decided leads to the ending of the film.In performances as real and powerful as those of Lee Pace and Troy Garity and yes, even Shawn Hatosy, the spectrum of the many permutations of the film are brilliantly delivered.  All are excellent, but the extraordinary work by Lee Pace (who has since become a very important actor in many films) deserves as many awards as possible.  The story is tough but exceptionally important, especially the manner in which it reveals the psychosocial and physical makeup of transgender people.  The film is at once a stunning love story as well as an expos&eacute; of man's inhumanity to man and the rigid impact of the military still bound by ancient and crude rules of behavior.  This is a film to see repeatedly for many reasons, not the least of which is that it has become a banner film for transgender citizens. It is based on a true story, a fact that makes it all the more painful to see.

It's noble attributes are not automatic, as each isolated, maligned and vilified segment of society has to endure ridicule until a certain number of deaths have accumulated to grudgingly acknowledge what others already accept. This is one extraordinary and courageous story about Barry Winchell (Troy Garity) who dreamed of being a soldier and serve his country. Believing he could do so with pride and honor, became an elite soldier and part of the Armed Forces. However he quickly learns, despite the overwhelming power of the military, it's still terrifies leaders that a gay man could virtually destroy the mightiest nation on earth with a forbidden kiss. Taken from the private life, military court records and public accounts of Barry Winchell, the young man visits a night club frequented by cross dressers, where he is attracted to and eventually falls in love with Calpernia Addams. (Lee Pace) Also known as 'Scottie' to his friends, the two begin a deep and passionate affair which led Barry to believe he had found true love. Unfortunately, bigoted fellow soldiers Justin Fisher and Calvin Glover (Shawn Hatosy, Philip Eddolls) become hate-filled adversaries of Barry and his lover and seek at first to torment and later to destroy their Homosexual relationship. What this film fails to accentuate is the ambivalent attitude of the military as it discovers to what length soldiers will go to destroy the personal choice of others. Touching and emotional, the film does allow some convincing interludes and compassionate notions between the two lovers. Indeed, their singular affair will at the very least give hope to other gays that eventually, the United States as well as the Military will accept the notion that there is more at stake than homophobic fear. ****",5,"""  Love in a world of hate """,1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,1957,"['always', 'amazed', 'how', 'country', 'superiority', 'other', 'nations', 'proclaiming', 'epicenter', 'freedom', 'nearly', 'always', 'last', 'endorse', 'noble', 'attributes', 'are', 'not', 'automatic', 'isolated', 'maligned', 'vilified', 'segment', 'society', 'endure', 'ridicule', 'certain', 'number', 'deaths', 'have', 'accumulated', 'grudgingly', 'acknowledge', 'what', 'others', 'already', 'accept', 'one', 'extraordinary', 'courageous', 'story', 'Barry', 'Winchell', 'Troy', 'Garity', 'who', 'dreamed', 'being', 'soldier', 'serve', 'country', 'Believing', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'pride', 'honor', 'became', 'elite', 'soldier', 'part', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'However', 'quickly', 'overwhelming', 'power', 'military', 'still', 'leaders', 'gay', 'man', 'could', 'virtually', 'destroy', 'mightiest', 'nation', 'earth', 'forbidden', 'kiss', 'Taken', 'private', 'life', 'military', 'court', 'records', 'public', 'accounts', 'Barry', 'Winchell', 'young', 'man', 'night', 'club', 'frequented', 'cross', 'dressers', 'where', 'attracted', 'eventually', 'love', 'Calpernia', 'Addams', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'Also', 'known', ""'Scottie"", 'friends', 'two', 'begin', 'deep', 'passionate', 'affair', 'led', 'Barry', 'believe', 'had', 'found', 'true', 'love', 'Unfortunately', 'bigoted', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'Justin', 'Fisher', 'Calvin', 'Glover', 'Shawn', 'Hatosy', 'Philip', 'Eddolls', 'become', 'hate-filled', 'adversaries', 'Barry', 'lover', 'seek', 'first', 'torment', 'later', 'destroy', 'Homosexual', 'relationship', 'What', 'film', 'accentuate', 'ambivalent', 'attitude', 'military', 'what', 'length', 'soldiers', 'will', 'go', 'destroy', 'personal', 'choice', 'others', 'Touching', 'emotional', 'film', 'allow', 'convincing', 'interludes', 'compassionate', 'notions', 'two', 'lovers', 'Indeed', 'singular', 'affair', 'will', 'very', 'least', 'give', 'hope', 'other', 'gays', 'eventually', 'United', 'States', 'as', 'well', 'Military', 'will', 'accept', 'notion', 'more', 'stake', 'homophobic', 'fear', '****']",N/A

This movie takes a big political issue, about someone being attacked by comrades in the US military for allegedly being gay, and turns it into a love story. The politics are left out of the movie and the viewer is left at the end to judge for themselves.There is some very excellent acting and you connect with the characters on many levels. It shows how a straight, but possibly gay, young man can fall in love with a former man. You connect with this on orthodox relationship.The military life is also very well portrayed except that it does have the standard host of Army reality errors -- calling NCOs sir, wearing hats indoors when not bearing weapons, calling a Sergeant Major ""sarge,"" etc.. Throughout the movie the machismo of the movie maybe overplayed; but it shows how this boy also has conflicted feelings with the military. He truly loves being in it and strives to be the best soldier and believes in the sacrifices that serving men make. Yet, he hates how he is being harassed how he has to live with a disturbed roommate. The drag club scene was great and entertaining compare to ""Pricilla Queen of the Desert.""I felt that the film could've been a bit longer - given the emotional toll, I can understand the need (or desire) to maintain a bit of economy, but I felt that certain characters and events should've been presented with a bit more detail, especially during the latter half of the film. The homophobia and generalized violence of the setting should've been presented in greater detail - this underlies my other criticisms, and would've removed the mystery from a few of the other characters. Winchell's fear was hinted at in many of his open-ended blow-ups with Fisher, and his confusion (which - though presented in beautiful fashion, is only really visible once) should've been depicted in greater detail - it would've done greater justice to his memory. The part that affected me the most was the ending (of course). Not the final scene, but the tribute to Barry Winchell and how old he was when he died. If I did my math correctly, he was only 22 when he was killed.America is virtually the only western nation (I believe the other is Turkey) that does not allow gays to serve in the military. After watching the ultimate result of codified homophobia that this movie relates, hopefully people will start understanding that homophobia does, indeed, kill, and start demanding a change.",4,My heart goes out to Barry's mother and family and those whom were involved.,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,2514,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'given', 'was', 'ShowTime', 'TV', 'budget', 'movie', 'big', 'political', 'issue', 'someone', 'being', 'attacked', 'comrades', 'US', 'military', 'allegedly', 'being', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'politics', 'are', 'left', 'movie', 'viewer', 'left', 'end', 'judge', 'themselves.There', 'very', 'excellent', 'acting', 'connect', 'characters', 'many', 'levels', 'how', 'straight', 'possibly', 'gay', 'young', 'man', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'former', 'man', 'connect', 'orthodox', 'relationship.The', 'military', 'life', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'have', 'standard', 'host', 'Army', 'reality', 'errors', 'calling', 'NCOs', 'sir', 'wearing', 'hats', 'indoors', 'when', 'not', 'bearing', 'weapons', 'calling', 'Sergeant', 'Major', 'sarge', 'movie', 'machismo', 'movie', 'maybe', 'overplayed', 'how', 'boy', 'also', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'military', 'truly', 'being', 'be', 'best', 'soldier', 'sacrifices', 'serving', 'men', 'make', 'how', 'being', 'harassed', 'how', 'live', 'disturbed', 'roommate', 'drag', 'club', 'scene', 'was', 'great', 'entertaining', 'compare', 'Pricilla', 'Queen', 'Desert', 'felt', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'longer', 'given', 'emotional', 'toll', 'can', 'understand', 'need', 'desire', 'maintain', 'bit', 'economy', 'felt', 'certain', 'characters', 'events', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'presented', 'bit', 'more', 'detail', 'especially', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'homophobia', 'generalized', 'violence', 'setting', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'presented', 'greater', 'detail', 'underlies', 'other', 'criticisms', 'would', ""'ve"", 'removed', 'mystery', 'few', 'other', 'characters', 'Winchell', 'fear', 'was', 'hinted', 'many', 'open-ended', 'blow-ups', 'Fisher', 'confusion', 'presented', 'beautiful', 'fashion', 'only', 'really', 'visible', 'once', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'depicted', 'greater', 'detail', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'greater', 'justice', 'memory', 'part', 'affected', 'most', 'was', 'ending', 'course', 'Not', 'final', 'scene', 'tribute', 'Barry', 'Winchell', 'how', 'old', 'was', 'when', 'died', 'did', 'math', 'correctly', 'was', 'only', '22', 'when', 'was', 'killed.America', 'virtually', 'only', 'western', 'nation', 'believe', 'other', 'Turkey', 'not', 'allow', 'gays', 'serve', 'military', 'watching', 'ultimate', 'result', 'codified', 'homophobia', 'movie', 'hopefully', 'people', 'will', 'start', 'understanding', 'homophobia', 'indeed', 'kill', 'start', 'demanding', 'change']",N/A

It is the story of an Army infantry soldier who falls for a transgendered performer at a drag club.  Barry Winchell is forced near Calpernia by circumstance, and is surprised by his own interest in and desire for her.The unlikely romance is beset by tensions originating from Winchell's obsessive-compulsive, Ritalin-addicted barracks roommate.  The roommate, Justin Fisher, is the one who dared Winchell to talk to Calpernia in the first place.  He's a lonely, conflicted redneck who is searching for friends while alienating nearly everyone around him.  Soldier's Girl is as much the story of Winchell and Calpernia as it is that of Fisher's explosive temper and confusion about the world.Winchell is a simple, courteous man who wants to succeed in the Army, keep the peace, and protect is right to a private life.  He's Fisher's only true friend, even as Fisher needles the company to create trouble for his friend.  Winchell's desire for a career in the Army is at odds with his ""deviant lifestyle""--and Fisher has prompted a company sergeant to launch an off-the-record investigation to root out out the ""homosexual"" hiding in their midst.The love story is Calpernia's first relationship with a man as a woman, so she's doing as much soul searching as her Army boyfriend, who much reconcile his love with the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy of the US military.  (Calpernia herself was enlisted in the Navy at one point, right out of high school.)  The behind-the-scenes interviews and documentary about the real life Barry Winchell enhance the presentation of this politically charged romance.

Crying?Well, it was worth it.Barry's story is well known, so I'll skip a retelling. Although I never fully understood Barry's interest in Calpernia, only because the movie didn't make any attempts to delve into the ""why"" of his attraction to her, I found myself moved by their love, and Barry's fierce determination to keep his private life (Calpernia) private.What a shame that he shared barracks with such a horrendous and sick person (Justin). I know some people in the armed forces that are gay (but don't ask me who, because I won't tell &lt;grin>), and they are well accepted by their ... I don't know the technical terms here...comrades in arms. How's that. A pity that Barry didn't get stuck with a person whose problem was certainly far worse than OCD.Anyway. What I found particularly moving, and what has caused me to watch the movie again, were the special features on the CD. Usually the special features are interesting for ancillary purposes. But these were different. First, I was surprised to find that Calpernia's [...] weren't real. I had been rather convinced that a real transgender was playing her role. Instead, it was a male, with a rather flat chest, so his performance was even more interesting. That's one of the main reasons I want to watch the film again.Calpernia Adams herself appeared in the Special Features, and I was so surprised. I don't have a tremendous amount of experience with transgenders, but did not expect her to be so much like a lady. NOT a gay man acting like a lady, but a real lady. Her comments on Barry were pointed and poignant. Also, she did have her final operation, and is working now in L.A.The other appearance of note in the Special Features was that of Barry's mother herself. We learned a little more about Barry than in the film. When he first went to Visions, his ""buddies"" were taking him there to get his mind off his breakup with his girlfriend of four years. She wondered if Barry was actually gay, but said that it didn't matter. What mattered is that what happened to him was a terrible crime, one of bigotry and hate, and so she and her husband have taken it upon themselves to speak when and wherever they can to combat closed minds. Good for them.There were only two things that angered me. One, the person that killed Barry will be eligible for parole in less than thirteen years. The manner in which he killed Barry should have garnered him life imprisonment without the possibility of parole - at best. Also, the instigator of his death, Justin, is up for parole very soon. If not for his pressuring, the little idiot (Glover?) that killed Barry probably wouldn't have done it.
