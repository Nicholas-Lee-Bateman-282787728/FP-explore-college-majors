They rolled off her tongue as if she really believed it herself.It is said to be digitally remastered. The clarity is very good quality considering it is 1950. The sound, well that part they forgot to remaster, it has to be high to hear what they are saying sometimes.As for Burns, his lines were about half good jokes and the delivery of his was not that great. Good thing he was an excellent writer.Overall, for jsut a few dollars (shipping included) it is reasonable. More than $4... I would probably pass.",3,good and bad news,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,572,"['good', 'news', 'ALlen', 'was', 'spectacular', 'delivery', 'jokes', 'rolled', 'off', 'tongue', 'really', 'believed', 'herself.It', 'said', 'be', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'clarity', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'considering', '1950', 'sound', 'well', 'part', 'forgot', 'remaster', 'be', 'high', 'hear', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'sometimes.As', 'Burns', 'lines', 'were', 'half', 'good', 'jokes', 'delivery', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'Good', 'thing', 'was', 'excellent', 'writer.Overall', 'jsut', 'few', 'dollars', 'shipping', 'included', 'reasonable', 'More', '4', 'would', 'probably', 'pass']",N/A

The quality varies--there are at least 2 episodes which have washed out badly over time that it looks as if a search light were on the set. But there are some treasured moments here, with Jack Benny in an amusing feud with a joke he stole from old pal George to Gracie turning a police precinct upside down over a matter of scalped football tickets.And of course, their Carnation Milk sponsor plugs their product like mad, having the announcer explain recipes, bits put in the script, and so forth.But it's a pleasure from the golden days of TV to watch George comment in mild amusement over something, or Gracie easily working the room with her zany ""logic"", which proved she wasn't as ""dumb"" as she led on! The supporting cast deserves mention as well: Bea Benadaret as hapless neighbor Blanche is a worthy co-hort in Gracie's schemes, and the Harry Morton character was played differently through a wide variety of actors.A nice follow-up to Volume 1!",5,The further TV adventures of George & Gracie,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,1045,"['Continuing', 'Volume', '1', 'DVD', 'early', 'episodes', 'beloved', 'TV', 'series', 'quality', 'varies', 'are', 'least', '2', 'episodes', 'have', 'washed', 'out', 'badly', 'time', 'search', 'light', 'were', 'set', 'are', 'treasured', 'moments', 'here', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'amusing', 'feud', 'joke', 'stole', 'old', 'pal', 'George', 'Gracie', 'turning', 'police', 'precinct', 'upside', 'down', 'matter', 'scalped', 'football', 'tickets.And', 'course', 'Carnation', 'Milk', 'sponsor', 'plugs', 'product', 'mad', 'having', 'announcer', 'explain', 'recipes', 'bits', 'put', 'script', 'so', 'forth.But', 'pleasure', 'golden', 'days', 'TV', 'watch', 'George', 'comment', 'mild', 'amusement', 'something', 'Gracie', 'easily', 'working', 'room', 'zany', 'logic', 'proved', 'was', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'led', 'supporting', 'cast', 'deserves', 'mention', 'as', 'well', 'Bea', 'Benadaret', 'hapless', 'neighbor', 'Blanche', 'worthy', 'co-hort', 'Gracie', 'schemes', 'Harry', 'Morton', 'character', 'was', 'played', 'differently', 'wide', 'variety', 'actors.A', 'nice', 'follow-up', 'Volume', '1']",N/A
