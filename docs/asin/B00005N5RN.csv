Just framing the scenes would have created a beautiful picture.  Although the settings were a little to clean and new, the costumes were excellent.  This 2000 turn of the century story with inspiration and love is directed by Ann Hu.  Watch the commentary by Hu for wonderful insight into the making of the film.  Like most Eastern movies, this is clean and something for the whole family.The story dates to 1902 China.  A young man, Liu, is so inspired by western technology and moving pictures, that  he submits himself to become the assistant to a traveling English photographer.  With persistence,  he succeeds and the townspeople become delighted with images of themselves.  The conflict arises when Liu is in love with the famed opera star's daughter.

666620,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B00005N5RN,Ping Lim,"[1, 5]","The material for this movie is good: a Westerner trying to strike it big in the Middle Kingdom a.k.a China by introducing Chinese to motion picture.  The movie was set in the early 20th century as China was on the verge of Industrial Revolution and prior to destruction of Ching Dynasty.  It was difficult for him to set up the business at first but through the help of a pro-Western and curious Chinese, motion picture gradually made its headway into the local scene.  Personally, I feel that the motion picture is a metaphor of modern time.  Naturally, there were Chinese who were reluctant to embrace motion picture because they felt that Chinese Opera Theatre had been going on since the beginning of time and thus, that should continue.  Anyway, the movie touched upon the cultural difference between East and West.  The Chinese character was coerced by his father to marry a wealthy widow who was significantly older than him.  In the olden times, the son had no option but conformed out of obligation.  However, the Western fellow (played by Jarred Harris) convinced the Chinese who had since become his best of friend that he should follow his heart, to pursue his dream lady the daughter of a revered Opera Singer of the time.  Jarred's character explained further that it's perfectly okay to display his affection for the opposite sex.  Then, there was mentioning about hierarchy difference.  Whereas the Opera singer's daughter was rich, the Chinese was poor.  Again, in the olden times, it was an impossibility to bridge the gap somewhat.  As a movie would have it, it would build to a climax where circumstances tried the friendship between the Chinese and the Western guy, the new against the old, complacency against courage.  Being a feel good movie, you can guess the rest.  I really feel that this movie is much aligned with ""Cinema Paradiso"" as the scenes of Chinese watching motion picture for the first time was exactly how it set up in the Italian movie.  Furthermore, the soundtrack utilised here is very much an Ernio Morricone rip-off.  It is expected for such kind of movie to be slow-moving.  It's unjust to compare this movie against Cinema Paradiso.  Yet, it's also unfair that the story is put to us in a condescending way suggesting that that's exactly what's going on in China during that time.  Naturally, there were touching moments but it's as if we have been down the same track before.  I question the accuracy of the depiction.  Is it the right kind of gramaphone used for the time?  There's never any display of chaos when the country was supposed to be filled with soldiers of both East and West trying to curb the civil war and the colonisation of various Western powers.  In this instance, Jarred Harris is THE only Westerner in the movie.  Overall, a well-made movie but in a shallow kind of way.

666624,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005N5RN,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 7]","Loosely based on the Chinese cinema history, &quot;Shadow Magic&quot; portrays the people surrounding the first showing of moving picture in Beijing, China in 1902.  But the film is more about the fictional chacaters involved in it rather than about the event itself, so do not expect any historical accuracy.  And &quot;Shadow Magic&quot; succeeds as the former kind of picture.Jared Harris (son of late Richard Harris) is in the film as a British entrepreneur Raymond Wallace, who is eagar to make some money, showing the films he brought from the West, but, good as he is, it is not Harris who carries the whole picture.  It is Chinese actor Xia Yu as Liu, a technician at photography studio who is really remarkable in &quot;Shadow Magic,&quot; and he is just wondeful.  Liu, interested in anything new from the West, is a kind of misfit in the traditional Chinese society, and naturally, is the first one to get hooked by the idea of Raymond -- showing the &quot;Shadow Magic&quot; in China.  They gradually begin to understand each other, and the rapport between these likable fellows is definitely the best part of the show.The story written by director Ann Hu, I must say, needs some trimming, sometimes filled with clithed moments.  And some viewers object to the way the Chinese society or culture is depicted here, claiming inaccuracy in the film.  Probably, the film's director Ann Hu is already conscious of that, for she is born in China, and lived through the time of Revolution and Chiarman Mao, and then she left the country to study abroad, in USA where she lives now.  Any production designs should be taken, I assume, as her own creations.  If the story or atomosphere of the film looks like a blend of the West and the East, it is probably her intention, or the result of her cultural background.  And I just do not think that the portrayals of Chinese people are seen through patronizing eye of Westerners.  True, they sometimes suffer from clithe, but fairly done, showing enough variety of people among them, avoiding one-dimentional characterization of the East.The most moving scene of the film is, of course, the first moment in which the people first see the picture and react joyfully.  You might have heard some famous episodes about the first viewers in Paris cafe where the Lumiere Brothers showed a short film of a train arriving at the station.  The same thing happens to the Chinese people.  The theme is thus universal.And again I say, the most joyful experience for us is to see the truly believable character of young Liu, who must decide his way of life between the two cultures.
