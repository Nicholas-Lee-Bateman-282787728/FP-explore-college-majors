908880,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0009NZ2RY,A. Burchfield,"[1, 1]","Some people love it but for me 3rd season was the poorest of the three seasons Roswell managed to get on the air. The show could have been so much better with only a little effort and so could this DVD set.Region 2 got it back in October 2004, we had to wait until August 2005- you'd think that might mean a better set of extra's but it didn't. For yor money you get 4 commentaries (I checked and I think season 2 with 20 episodes only had 2)a short ""Class of 2002"" featurette (a few behind the scenes bits in it but not many)and a video of Shiri Appleby on a Roswell promo tour in Japan back in July of 2004, no other extras of any sort. Like the first two seasons this one has been converted to widescreen format and has ""new cutting edge songs selected by the original Roswell music team""- basically that means if it wasn't specifically mentioned by name in an episode you probably won't find it here.As for the storylines, I never understood the whole Max in California trip bit although I didn't mind some parts. The saucer bit was especially dumb, the other protector (hinted at in ""Summer of '47"", 2nd season), has shirked his duty and is a top movie producer- you do- briefly, get to see his true form. ""Busted"" was the best episode of that segment. I didn't mind the addition of someone obviously Hispanic to the cast but the whole Isabel/Jesse plotline was weird (why couldn't Isabel have found a college student instead of a lawyer at her father's lawfirm?). The best parts of that line were in ""I married an Alien"", dumb plot but at least we learn something about Jesse. ""Chant down Babylon"" is the episode where Jesse learns the truth about his wife, it might be one of the best episodes this season, if you don't mind the whole Max/ Clayton body thing.I'd read, I think, that towards the last the network let the writers go their own way. I think that the later episodes (I admit most episodes had good bits) were generally better and more like the earlier seasons, except for seeming to drop the whole mission of returning to fight for Antar. #16 Crash involves an Air Force fighter colliding with a UFO then the gang protecting the pilot and his daughter from Air Force hitmen (I didn't get why the USAF kills pilots who have such incidents). The worst part is Jason Behr really should've gotten a haircut and a shave in posing as an airman- no way he'd have gotten on base looking so shaggy. #17 Four Aliens and a baby- It was Tess piloting that UFO, come back to Earth because Kivar has reneged on the deal she had to return to Antar with Max's son (baby Zan is full human, no Antarian DNA) she kind of patches things up with the gang (it's never explained why she always seems so much more powerful that the others)before returning to the airbase to destroy her ship, herself, and most of the base to get the Air Force off the other's trail. The biggest flaw in this one is that even though Max, Michael and Tess are unable to get out of Roswell with baby Zan- Tess and Liz are able to drive out to the base and Liz drive back without trouble from Air Force checkpoints. The way the Evan's parents so quickly adapted after their strange suspicion of their chidren was weak too. #18 Graduation was a sort of sad end to the series. An Air Force General has  reunited members of the Special Unit (that Nasedo disbanded) hunting down the aliens who destroyed his base. Thanks to visions Liz has the gang is able to foil their plot to kill them during graduation ceremonies. I had some problems with inconsistencies here as these ""professionals"" didn't appear to notice that Michael wasn't in the room, also- notice the lighting after Max darkens the place- it varies between full dark to just dim light with the hitmen's riflescopes either seeing nothing or seeing in green nightvision. I'd also say it would be unlikely that the school would permit a student, as Max did, taking over the speech.The best touch was having Shiri Appleby ""Liz"" do the voiceover for the end of the episode/series. She started the series and she was there at the end.I'll miss Roswell, even when it did get sloppy it had it's moments.",3,"Could so easily have been better, I'm sorry it's gone",1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,4128,"['people', 'love', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'poorest', 'three', 'seasons', 'Roswell', 'managed', 'get', 'air', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'only', 'little', 'effort', 'so', 'could', 'DVD', 'set.Region', '2', 'got', 'back', 'October', '2004', 'had', 'wait', 'August', '2005-', ""'d"", 'think', 'might', 'mean', 'better', 'set', 'extra', 'did', ""n't"", 'yor', 'money', 'get', '4', 'commentaries', 'checked', 'think', 'season', '2', '20', 'episodes', 'only', 'had', '2', 'short', 'Class', '2002', 'featurette', 'few', 'scenes', 'bits', 'not', 'many', 'video', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'Roswell', 'promo', 'tour', 'Japan', 'back', 'July', '2004', 'other', 'extras', 'sort', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'been', 'converted', 'widescreen', 'format', 'new', 'cutting', 'edge', 'songs', 'selected', 'original', 'Roswell', 'music', 'team', 'basically', 'was', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'mentioned', 'name', 'episode', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'storylines', 'never', 'understood', 'whole', 'Max', 'California', 'trip', 'bit', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'parts', 'saucer', 'bit', 'was', 'especially', 'dumb', 'other', 'protector', 'hinted', 'Summer', ""'47"", '2nd', 'season', 'shirked', 'duty', 'top', 'movie', 'producer-', 'do-', 'briefly', 'get', 'see', 'true', 'form', 'Busted', 'was', 'best', 'episode', 'segment', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'addition', 'someone', 'obviously', 'Hispanic', 'cast', 'whole', 'Isabel/Jesse', 'plotline', 'was', 'weird', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'Isabel', 'have', 'found', 'college', 'student', 'instead', 'lawyer', 'father', 'lawfirm', 'best', 'parts', 'line', 'were', 'married', 'Alien', 'dumb', 'plot', 'least', 'learn', 'something', 'Jesse', 'Chant', 'down', 'Babylon', 'episode', 'where', 'Jesse', 'truth', 'wife', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'whole', 'Max/', 'Clayton', 'body', 'thing.I', ""'d"", 'read', 'think', 'last', 'network', 'let', 'writers', 'go', 'own', 'way', 'think', 'later', 'episodes', 'admit', 'most', 'episodes', 'had', 'good', 'bits', 'were', 'generally', 'better', 'more', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'seeming', 'drop', 'whole', 'mission', 'returning', 'fight', 'Antar', '16', 'Crash', 'Air', 'Force', 'fighter', 'colliding', 'UFO', 'then', 'gang', 'protecting', 'pilot', 'daughter', 'Air', 'Force', 'hitmen', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'USAF', 'kills', 'pilots', 'who', 'have', 'such', 'incidents', 'worst', 'part', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'really', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'haircut', 'shave', 'posing', 'airman-', 'way', ""'d"", 'have', 'gotten', 'base', 'looking', 'so', 'shaggy', '17', 'Four', 'Aliens', 'baby-', 'was', 'Tess', 'piloting', 'UFO', 'come', 'back', 'Earth', 'Kivar', 'reneged', 'deal', 'had', 'return', 'Antar', 'Max', 'son', 'baby', 'Zan', 'full', 'human', 'Antarian', 'DNA', 'kind', 'patches', 'things', 'up', 'gang', 'never', 'explained', 'why', 'always', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'others', 'returning', 'airbase', 'destroy', 'ship', 'most', 'base', 'get', 'Air', 'Force', 'other', 'trail', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'one', 'even', 'Max', 'Michael', 'Tess', 'are', 'unable', 'get', 'Roswell', 'baby', 'Zan-', 'Tess', 'Liz', 'are', 'able', 'drive', 'out', 'base', 'Liz', 'drive', 'back', 'trouble', 'Air', 'Force', 'checkpoints', 'way', 'Evan', 'parents', 'so', 'quickly', 'adapted', 'strange', 'suspicion', 'chidren', 'was', 'weak', 'too', '18', 'Graduation', 'was', 'sort', 'sad', 'end', 'series', 'Air', 'Force', 'General', 'reunited', 'members', 'Special', 'Unit', 'Nasedo', 'disbanded', 'hunting', 'down', 'aliens', 'who', 'destroyed', 'base', 'Thanks', 'visions', 'Liz', 'gang', 'able', 'foil', 'plot', 'kill', 'graduation', 'ceremonies', 'had', 'problems', 'inconsistencies', 'here', 'professionals', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'notice', 'Michael', 'was', ""n't"", 'room', 'also-', 'notice', 'lighting', 'Max', 'place-', 'full', 'dark', 'just', 'dim', 'light', 'hitmen', 'riflescopes', 'seeing', 'nothing', 'seeing', 'green', 'nightvision', ""'d"", 'also', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'unlikely', 'school', 'would', 'permit', 'student', 'Max', 'did', 'taking', 'over', 'speech.The', 'best', 'touch', 'was', 'having', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'Liz', 'do', 'voiceover', 'end', 'episode/series', 'started', 'series', 'was', 'there', 'end.I', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'Roswell', 'even', 'when', 'did', 'get', 'sloppy', 'had', 'moments']",Roswell - The Complete Third Season The Final Chapter

908886,A282A0P69UT137,B0009NZ2RY,"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower""","[24, 49]","I was a big fan of Roswell's first two seasons.  It was a great dramatic show that had found a nice mix of romance, comedy, drama, and action, all rolled into a great group of characters as they struggle with an otherwordly secret.  I didn't like everything they did, especially in Season 2, but the overall charm of the show never died.  Until Season 3.I found Season 3 to lack the substance and quality of the first two years of the show.  They changed the show too much, and the changes are mostly not for the better.  Here are some reasons why Season 3 doesn't measure up:1) Its a good thing for characters to change over the course of a series, but change for the sake of change is not always good.  For example: While the growing maturity of Michael's character (while still maintaining some of his rebellious tendencies) in Season 3 was a great change and wonderfully handled.  On the contrary, the growing immaturity of Valenti was not a great change.  He went from villain in Season 1 to trusted friend and ally of the alien group in Season 2, but he always brought something of a mature presence to the teenage series.  He's the adult's perspective on the secret, you could say.  While the changes in Season 3 sort of fits what happened to Valenti in Season 2, can we really fit the image of rocker boy Valenti dating younger girls in Season 3 with the authority figure he was even after he lost his job in Season 2? Not really.  At the same time, some characters didn't change at all.  Kyle, for instance.  He is still the comic relief Buddha boy who can't get laid.  They could have really done somebetter things with him, and only waited to the end of the season to add to his character.2) The way the writers handled many of the characters' development and relationships in Season 3 really stunk.  Case in point-Isabel.  When we leave off at the end of Season 2, she is mourning Alex's death and dancing with his ghost at his grave.  Then, boom-Season 3 begins with her kissing and making out with some character we were just introduced to.  Big mistake.  It totally disregards the fact that Isabel has just lost her first true love, killed by a girl she considered a friend no less.  Also, we don't even know who this new guy Jesse is as a character and she is already all over him.  It makes her look like a cold, self-absorbed girl who is horny and wants a hot, money making husband. Now, if they had shown how their relationship developed, and given more distance between her post-Alex mourning period and her hook up with Jesse, then it might have been a great development for her character.  But it was handled poorly, and bringing Alex's ghost back a few episodes into the season to tell Isabel its okay to marry Jesse only slightly repaired some of the damage.  Plus, it sends a bad message to young women.  Get married right out of high school when your 18 to an older guy when you are just starting college?  Uh, not what I would recommend.3) One of the best things about Roswell was the group dynamic between the friends.  That is mostly lost in this season.  There isn't really a group.  They are just a bunch of individuals who only seem to see one or two of the others at times.  Also, there is a real lack of feeling this season that these teenagers are....well, teenagers.  That was part of Roswell's appeal was the fact that these are young people who are trying to deal with problems that would confound most adults.  Did we even see them in school more than once or twice this season?4) Most of the plots in Season 3 were absolutely moronic.  An old guy who runs a drug company wants to drain Max's life energy?  Max goes to hollywood?  Max and Michael impersonate Air Force personnel to get onto a base to rescue a pilot who the Air Force wants to kill?  Liz has powers now?  Khivar can beam his mind billions of light years and take over human bodies?  Absolutely dumb!  And I'm not going to even talk about the Bewitched parody!Now, there were a couple of good episodes this season, such as Tess' return and the episodes surrounding Jesse's discovery of Isabel's alien origins.  The finale is good, too.  The only good overall plot thread they did was Max's father finally investigating his son's strange behavior. Other than that, this season is pretty much a wash. I bought the first two DVD sets, but I am skipping this one.",1,When Roswell lost its way.,1118707200,"06 14, 2005",2005,4363,"['was', 'big', 'fan', 'Roswell', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'great', 'dramatic', 'show', 'had', 'found', 'nice', 'mix', 'romance', 'comedy', 'drama', 'action', 'rolled', 'great', 'group', 'characters', 'struggle', 'otherwordly', 'secret', 'did', ""n't"", 'everything', 'did', 'especially', 'Season', '2', 'overall', 'charm', 'show', 'never', 'died', 'Season', '3.I', 'found', 'Season', '3', 'lack', 'substance', 'quality', 'first', 'two', 'years', 'show', 'changed', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'changes', 'are', 'mostly', 'not', 'better', 'Here', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'Season', '3', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up:1', 'good', 'thing', 'characters', 'change', 'course', 'series', 'change', 'sake', 'change', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'example', 'growing', 'maturity', 'Michael', 'character', 'still', 'maintaining', 'rebellious', 'tendencies', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'great', 'change', 'wonderfully', 'handled', 'contrary', 'growing', 'immaturity', 'Valenti', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'change', 'went', 'villain', 'Season', '1', 'trusted', 'friend', 'ally', 'alien', 'group', 'Season', '2', 'always', 'brought', 'something', 'mature', 'presence', 'teenage', 'series', 'adult', 'perspective', 'secret', 'could', 'say', 'changes', 'Season', '3', 'sort', 'fits', 'what', 'happened', 'Valenti', 'Season', '2', 'can', 'really', 'fit', 'image', 'rocker', 'boy', 'Valenti', 'dating', 'younger', 'girls', 'Season', '3', 'authority', 'figure', 'was', 'even', 'lost', 'job', 'Season', '2', 'Not', 'really', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'Kyle', 'instance', 'still', 'comic', 'relief', 'Buddha', 'boy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'laid', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'done', 'somebetter', 'things', 'only', 'waited', 'end', 'season', 'add', 'character.2', 'way', 'writers', 'handled', 'many', 'characters', 'development', 'relationships', 'Season', '3', 'really', 'stunk', 'Case', 'point-Isabel', 'When', 'leave', 'off', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'mourning', 'Alex', 'death', 'dancing', 'ghost', 'grave', 'Then', 'boom-Season', '3', 'begins', 'kissing', 'making', 'out', 'character', 'were', 'just', 'introduced', 'Big', 'mistake', 'totally', 'fact', 'Isabel', 'just', 'lost', 'first', 'true', 'love', 'killed', 'girl', 'considered', 'friend', 'less', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'new', 'guy', 'Jesse', 'character', 'already', 'look', 'cold', 'self-absorbed', 'girl', 'who', 'horny', 'hot', 'money', 'making', 'husband', 'Now', 'had', 'shown', 'how', 'relationship', 'developed', 'given', 'more', 'distance', 'post-Alex', 'mourning', 'period', 'hook', 'up', 'Jesse', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'development', 'character', 'was', 'handled', 'poorly', 'bringing', 'Alex', 'ghost', 'back', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'tell', 'Isabel', 'okay', 'marry', 'Jesse', 'only', 'slightly', 'repaired', 'damage', 'bad', 'message', 'young', 'women', 'Get', 'married', 'right', 'high', 'school', 'when', '18', 'older', 'guy', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'college', 'Uh', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'recommend.3', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'Roswell', 'was', 'group', 'friends', 'mostly', 'lost', 'season', ""n't"", 'really', 'group', 'are', 'just', 'bunch', 'individuals', 'who', 'only', 'seem', 'see', 'one', 'two', 'others', 'times', 'Also', 'real', 'lack', 'feeling', 'season', 'teenagers', 'are', '.well', 'teenagers', 'was', 'part', 'Roswell', 'appeal', 'was', 'fact', 'are', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'deal', 'problems', 'would', 'confound', 'most', 'adults', 'Did', 'even', 'see', 'school', 'more', 'once', 'twice', 'season', '4', 'Most', 'plots', 'Season', '3', 'were', 'absolutely', 'moronic', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'drug', 'company', 'drain', 'Max', 'life', 'energy', 'Max', 'hollywood', 'Max', 'Michael', 'impersonate', 'Air', 'Force', 'personnel', 'get', 'base', 'rescue', 'pilot', 'who', 'Air', 'Force', 'kill', 'Liz', 'powers', 'now', 'Khivar', 'can', 'beam', 'mind', 'billions', 'light', 'years', 'take', 'over', 'human', 'bodies', 'Absolutely', 'dumb', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'even', 'talk', 'Bewitched', 'parody', 'Now', 'were', 'couple', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', 'such', 'Tess', 'return', 'episodes', 'surrounding', 'Jesse', 'discovery', 'Isabel', 'alien', 'origins', 'finale', 'good', 'too', 'only', 'good', 'overall', 'plot', 'thread', 'did', 'was', 'Max', 'father', 'finally', 'investigating', 'son', 'strange', 'behavior', 'Other', 'season', 'pretty', 'much', 'wash', 'bought', 'first', 'two', 'DVD', 'sets', 'am', 'skipping', 'one']",Roswell - The Complete Third Season The Final Chapter

Someone mentioned how several plot lines were started and not completed I don't agree. The episode in which Max jumps into the lake and has a violent reaction is pretty clear he think his son was contacting him. The plot of Liz's powers were simply her surpressing her anger and that anger being manifested into an alien like power. The series had so much potential and it's sad that it ended with them completely forgetting the plea of their true mother to comeback and save thier home planet. They instead choose to give up thier throne and bum around the earth so called helping those in need...what a waste. I was one that loved the sci-fi part of this story and I would have enjoyed seeing how they would eventually get back to their home planet and reclaim thier throne. I hated the ending although cute not very fulfilling. They should have done maybe a narrative stating how yes they traveled the world for a while helping others but eventually found a way to get back to thier home plant Antar and bring peace. Also I hated how poor Isabel was destined to be an old maid while stuck on earth never being allowed to have a permanent relationship.

908892,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B0009NZ2RY,Eric J. Anderson,"[21, 24]","Having enjoyed the first two seasons of Roswell, I wanted to enjoy the third season. I did up to a point, but objectively the series fell apart in the third year, and was brought to a merciful end after 18 episodes. This makes the season three set a poor value in both quantity and quality -- four shows short of a normal season of television, and deficient in imagination, continuity, and overall execution.I believe the young actors in this series improved throughout their tenure in Roswell, but this is against the backdrop of declining script quality. The writing ignored logic at so many points, that anyone not in the grip of blind fannish adoration for this series would be quite annoyed.To top it off, Jonathan Frakes produces some of the most inane audio commentary for a TV episode I've ever heard. Announcing the characters and actors as they come on the screen -- like we don't know who the stars of the show are???What led to the demise of Roswell is probably the lack of a good story arc for the third season. For the first half of the year, Max was looking for his son, taken from him in season two by the duplicitous Tess (played by Emilie de Ravin, currently appearing in LOST on ABC). Then, Max loses interest in that quest. Isabel inexplicably abandons all caution and common sense, marrying a man she has known but a few short months. Inevitably this leads to conflict, since she decides to deceive him about her alien heritage. When her ex-lover from the home planet shows up on their honeymoon, more silliness ensues. Michael and Maria are together, then they split up, then they get back together, kind of, and finally Maria decides to commit. Colin Hanks comes back as a ghost (sort of) in one episode -- which seemed like an act of desperation to me.Certainly there are enjoyable moments, and fans of the first two seasons will want to see the third. But keep your expectations low. Probably one of the best shows of the year, the one that is truest to the characters, is the episode about what the gang did on New Year's Eve. Maria and ex-Sherriff Valenti get to show their musical talents in several shows, Valenti with his country rock band the Kit Shickers, and Maria with her guitar in an aborted attempt at a recording career. I actually enjoyed the musical bits. The band Ivy puts in a cameo appearance in the wedding party.Season three was a year of crazy capers, confused lovers, badly choreographed fights and action scenes, and villians with about as much depth as cardboard cutouts. And don't forget a healthy dose of stupid, stupid writing. None of it really adds up to much, and in the end, a prophecy of doom leads the aliens and their human posse to abandon Roswell. The epilogue, which informs us via a voiceover that Romeo and Juliet eventually marry, is hardly fitting. We wanted to see the series mature and actually experience that wedding in a future episode. The first and last episodes of the season are reasonably good, but overall Roswell ended its TV run with a whimper, not an antimatter explosion.",3,"Two steps, and then a stumble",1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,3052,"['Having', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Roswell', 'wanted', 'enjoy', 'third', 'season', 'did', 'up', 'point', 'objectively', 'series', 'fell', 'apart', 'third', 'year', 'was', 'brought', 'merciful', 'end', '18', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'set', 'poor', 'value', 'quantity', 'quality', 'four', 'shows', 'short', 'normal', 'season', 'television', 'deficient', 'imagination', 'continuity', 'overall', 'execution.I', 'believe', 'young', 'actors', 'series', 'improved', 'tenure', 'Roswell', 'backdrop', 'declining', 'script', 'quality', 'writing', 'ignored', 'logic', 'so', 'many', 'points', 'anyone', 'not', 'grip', 'blind', 'fannish', 'adoration', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'annoyed.To', 'top', 'off', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'most', 'inane', 'audio', 'commentary', 'TV', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Announcing', 'characters', 'actors', 'come', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'What', 'led', 'demise', 'Roswell', 'probably', 'lack', 'good', 'story', 'arc', 'third', 'season', 'first', 'half', 'year', 'Max', 'was', 'looking', 'son', 'taken', 'season', 'two', 'duplicitous', 'Tess', 'played', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'currently', 'appearing', 'LOST', 'ABC', 'Then', 'Max', 'interest', 'quest', 'Isabel', 'inexplicably', 'caution', 'common', 'sense', 'marrying', 'man', 'known', 'few', 'short', 'months', 'Inevitably', 'conflict', 'deceive', 'alien', 'heritage', 'When', 'ex-lover', 'home', 'planet', 'up', 'honeymoon', 'more', 'silliness', 'ensues', 'Michael', 'Maria', 'are', 'together', 'then', 'split', 'up', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'kind', 'finally', 'Maria', 'commit', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'back', 'ghost', 'sort', 'one', 'episode', 'seemed', 'act', 'desperation', 'me.Certainly', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'fans', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'third', 'keep', 'expectations', 'low', 'Probably', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'year', 'one', 'truest', 'characters', 'episode', 'what', 'gang', 'did', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'Maria', 'ex-Sherriff', 'Valenti', 'get', 'show', 'musical', 'talents', 'several', 'shows', 'Valenti', 'country', 'rock', 'band', 'Kit', 'Shickers', 'Maria', 'guitar', 'aborted', 'attempt', 'recording', 'career', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'musical', 'bits', 'band', 'Ivy', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'wedding', 'party.Season', 'three', 'was', 'year', 'crazy', 'capers', 'confused', 'lovers', 'badly', 'choreographed', 'fights', 'action', 'scenes', 'villians', 'about', 'much', 'depth', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'healthy', 'dose', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'writing', 'None', 'really', 'up', 'much', 'end', 'prophecy', 'doom', 'aliens', 'human', 'posse', 'abandon', 'Roswell', 'epilogue', 'voiceover', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'eventually', 'marry', 'hardly', 'fitting', 'wanted', 'see', 'series', 'mature', 'actually', 'experience', 'wedding', 'future', 'episode', 'first', 'last', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'reasonably', 'good', 'overall', 'Roswell', 'ended', 'TV', 'run', 'whimper', 'not', 'antimatter', 'explosion']",Roswell - The Complete Third Season The Final Chapter

908898,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0009NZ2RY,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[49, 51]","Roswell came onto the scene in 1999, following Dawson's Creek in the WB lineup. The first two seasons were broadcast on the WB before the rights to the third season were picked up by UPN, which aired the final 18 episodes in the 2001-2002 television season.I never watched Roswell while it was on television, but after reading a good review about the first season, purchased the DVD set and was hooked on the story. Both the first and second season sets were quite good and I was certainly looking forward to the third and final season when it hit DVD stands earlier this year.Roswell follows the lives of alien-human hybrids Max Evans (Jason Behr), Isabel Evans (Katherine Heigl) and Michael Guerin (Brendan Fehr) as they try to live their lives as normally as possible in the alien-crazed town of Roswell, New Mexico. Their secrets were safe until Max used his powers to save Liz Parker (Shiri Appleby), bringing Liz and her friend Maria (Majandra Delfino) into the secret.Over the course of the first two seasons, Sheriff Jim Valenti (William Sadler), his son Kyle (Nick Wechsler) and Alex Whitman (Colin Hanks) found out about the aliens secret. Alex was killed at the end of season two by yet another alien-hybrid, Tess Harding (Emilie deRavin) who was carrying Max's son, the heir to the throne on their home planet. All of these aspects play a part in the start of the third season.Liz and Max, torn apart in season two by Max's relationship with Tess, are back together and in the very first episode, they are trying desperately to find a way to find Max's son. Throughout the season, that is one of the big story lines, as Max searches for the son that is rightfully his. He knows that Tess left Earth to return to her home planet, and he wants to find a way back to save his son. As the season, and the series, draw to a close, Tess returns to Earth to bring Max his son, who is 100 percent human, and Max, knowing he can't raise a son, gives him up for adoption.The story line between Max and Liz was the main motivation in season one and it again takes center stage in season three. Liz's father forbids the two from dating, even at one point, sending her off to boarding school in Vermont. These two actors share amazing chemistry and their relationship is an incredibly believable one straight to the final episode. You really get the sense that these two love each other. When Max is supposedly killed while rescuing Valenti from a fire (and the requisite bad guys), Liz, at boarding school in Vermont, has the sudden feeling that he is dead.Michael and Maria have quite possibly the stormiest relationship in town. Their on again, off again, human-alien relationship is put to incredible tests. Michael struggles in school, takes on another job in addition to his work at the Crash Down Cafe, Liz's parents' restaurant. All of this is tough on the relationship between the two characters, but again, as the series winds down, the viewer begins to realize just how much they mean to each other. Maria, on another note, gets her dream chance to be a singer, but the realities of the ""Music Industry"" send her back to Roswell.Isabel, we find out as the season opens, is in a relationship with Jesse Ramirez (Adam Rodriquez), a lawyer in her father's firm, who is eight years older than she is. She struggles with the truth about herself and her feelings for Jesse and how the two should intertwine. A visit from beyond from Alex helps convince her that Jesse is indeed the one she should be with. The two get married, but it is only after Isabel is shot that Jesse finds out the secret about his wife, her brother and their friend. This storyline is Isabel's strongest story line of the three seasons, by far. She showed her acting chops (which can now be seen on the ABC hit Grey's Anatomy) in fine form.Valenti and his son Kyle, as possessors of the alien secret, are always in on the goings on of the aliens, but in this season, their parts were not as great as in the first two. They both have major parts in a couple of episodes, particularly as the season drew to a close. but ultimately, the two characters were not as central to the show as they could have been. Valenti's career as a singer (he was fired as sheriff in season two) is an interesting turn of events, however.The final episode was very well done and everyone involved should be commended for wrapping up the series in a solid way, a way that brought closure to everything. The three aliens, Liz, Maria and Kyle, all pack up after a near sniper attack at graduation, where Max saved his friends and MIchael, in turn, saved Max, and leave town. Valenti, back in a uniform as a deputy (You've got to start somewhere), helps them get out of town and we hear, like we did in the very first episode, a journal entry from Liz, as she descibes how her life is now that she's left Roswell. We see her and Max's wedding and we see her father, reading the journal, finding out just all that had happened in the last three years of his daughter's life, as the van with the six friends leaves the church where Max and Liz tied the knot, and rides off into the sunset.As far as extras go, this set isn't bad. There are four commentary tracks, including a great one from Creator Jason Katims on the finale. The only bad thing about these tracks, is each of them features only one person, which can be a little boring, but for the most part, they are informative.There is a featurette on the making of season three and all that went into the final chapter of Roswell, as well as a short feature on Shiri Appleby's DVD tour in Japan, where we see the actress promoting the first season on DVD in Japan.All in all, this was a solid set. The series wrapped up in solid fashion, leaving no terribly loose ends. Anyone who tuned in from the beginning certainly should have been happy with the way things turned out. It was a fitting end.",4,The Final Chapter,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,5902,"['Roswell', 'came', 'scene', '1999', 'following', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'WB', 'lineup', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were',

908905,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009NZ2RY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","The third season of ""Roswell"" ended up being ""The Final Chapter,"" but it clearly was intended to be a transitional period for the show and its characters.  Because of that, even though the season ends with four of the characters graduating from high school, I ended up feeling more like too many things were left hanging than arriving at an actual sense of completion (specifically, what I take to be a U-turn regarding the character of ""Jesse"" at the end).  This is hardly the fault of the show's producers and there may well be an accumulated undercurrent of anger and disgust at termination of shows like ""Roswell,"" ""Dark Angel,"" ""Firefly,"" and ""Angel"" that die too young.  Then again, would ""Roswell"" really work if it was no longer set in Roswell?  I say, ""yes,"" but that is an argument for another day.If the first season of ""Roswell"" was about truly star-crossed romances and the second season focused more on science fiction, then the final season tries to find a happy balance between the two.  Max (Jason Behr) and Liz (Shiri Appleby) want to be together but events in the season's first episode, ""Busted,"" give her father (John Doe) ample reason to keep the two apart.  Meanwhile, in what becomes a major sub-plot, Max and Isabel's father (Garrett M. Brown) starts doing more than asking questions about what his kids are up to (""Interruptus"").  But while Mr. Evans has his eye on Max, he is missing the fact that Isabel (Katherine Heigl) is having a romance with Jesse (Adam Rodriguez), a young lawyer in his firm (""Secrets and Lies"").  As for Michael (Brendan Fehr) and Maria (Majandra Delfino), they actually seem to notice that the peculiar cycle of their relationship is not necessarily a good thing (""Behind the Music"").  But the couple exhibiting the most friction during this season is clearly Kyle (Nick Wechsler) and Jim (William Sadler), with the latter a fish out of water now that he no longer wears a badge.The relationship between Max and Liz is still the heart and soul of ""Roswell,"" and for the most part it is solid this season except for the brief boarding school bit (""Panacea""), which comes across as an unnecessary diversion.  Since I really liked Isabel and Alex (Colin Hanks), so I could never warm up to Jesse, and having Alex ""visit"" Isabel only reinforced that idea (""Significant Others"").  Taking the inevitability of Michael and Maria for granted does not making their going round and round on the same points of conflict over and over again any easier to take, especially since while Michael actually takes steps towards growing up (""Michael, The Guys and The Great Snapple Caper""), Maria is prevented from doing so (""Ch-Ch-Changes""), so it ends up a wash, which hardly seems fair.  Besides, there are other ways of pursuing a music career besides singing with a giant heartless label (""Panacea"").  This leaves little for the Valentis to do besides father and son comedy bits, with a few notable exceptions (""Chant Down Babylon"").Perhaps the biggest problem with this final season is how the kids are trying to figure out their love lives while so many people are after them.  In addition to Max and Isabel's parents there are the evil aliens (""Interruptus""), a pharmaceutical company (""Panacea""), the F.B.I. (""Who Died and Made You King?""), the U.S. Air Force (""Crash""), and sometimes most of the above (""Four Aliens and A Baby"").  When we get to the final episode and Michael suggests the time has come to get out of Dodge, you have to just go ""Duh!""  But then these pursuits often stop conveniently so that the Roswell aliens are not captured, or in some cases are apparently forgotten.  I understand that the government cannot be too smart or too competent, otherwise the series ends rather abruptly with Max, Isabel and Michael on vivisection tables or floating in giant tanks of fluid, but it gets to be bit much when the government has military troops run through a house chasing an alien and they do not bother to at least detain people for questioning.  I thought the best of the bunch was the investigation by Max and Isabel's parents, but even that one was affected by the rush to wrap things up at the end of the season.No one the comedy of ""Roswell"" tends to stand out as providing high points for the season.  This means not only an episode like ""I Married an Alien,"" which manages to tell a storyline both in ""reality"" and as a takeoff on a ""Bewitched"" type 1960s television situation comedy, but also the cute little moments.  The latter would include Max reading the role of an alien for a part on ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" (""Secrets and Lies""), Max and Michael breathing helium from balloons so they can play tin-foil covered aliens (""Crash""), and the moment in the finale when Liz turns to Maria and expresses disbelief that her best friend is made at her because she is not going to die like the rest of them.  Yes, I feel like that sometimes too.  Besides, it is not all fear and laughter on ""Roswell,"" as the show comes up with another moving Christmas episode (""Samuel Rising"").Granted, I would probably think more highly of the three-season run of ""Roswell"" if I were actually of an age more inclined to identify with the young, good looking protagonists.  Certainly their bonds of friendship are central to when ""Roswell"" is working at its best, but as was the case with ""The X-Files"" there is only so much dancing around the truth that you can do before things start to fall apart, or at least become problematic.  Fortunately, this series benefited from having the relationship between Max and Liz at its core.  That is where it began and it is also where the series most fittingly ends.  Now my question is whether anybody has been writing novels continuing where things were left off with this gang, because those could be pretty interesting.",4,"It is the end of the road for Max, Liz

The final piece of the Roswell puzzle is now available on DVD, and let me tell you I couldn't be happier. While Season 3 wasn't exactly the greatest season the show had to offer (that honor would have to go to season 1) it does offer great episodes and a final close to the Roswell story. I waited long to get my hands on this, and I can tell you I'm just as pleased with this one as I was with any of the other DVD sets, and I'm sure that most other fans will fall in love with this one the same way they fell in love with both of the previous releases.Season 3 starts off with Max and Liz trying to find a way for Max to get back to his home planet of Antar in order to save his son. If you recall the last episode from season 2 left us with Tess returning home carrying Max's child, but leaving Max, Isabelle and Micheal still on earth. So Max and Liz look into many things and try many ideas, even landing them in Jail at one point, which eventually prompts their parents to once again insist they not see eachother. Season 3, while the shortest of the three (only 18 episodes) does contain a lot of important moments: Tess's eventual return with Max's child, Jesse realizing that Isabelle is an ""alien"", Max and Isabelle being discovered by the FBI, Tess's Death, and Max's eventual decision to let his son Zan be adopted. There's a lot of great moments here. The season does take some occasional breaks, like the episode ""I Married An Alien"" (a spoof of bewitched), which offers some entertainment on the side, but doesn't further the story. The series eventually comes to an end with the episode ""Graduation"", which sees the gang ultimately leaving Roswell together, and Max and Liz getting married. While many questions were still left unanswered, it does give an appropriate end to a great series which I was glad see (keep hoping for that Roswell Movie).If you love Roswell, then buy this DVD set immediately. Just like the other two, I guarantee no complaints. If you own either of the other two sets, you know what to expect from the extras, so I want go into it. They're pretty standard, but the episodes are what we really care about. This season is just as memorable as any of the others, and a great final chapter to a great television series that never really got that much attention.

908908,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B0009NZ2RY,Marc Cabir Davis,"[0, 3]","With these simple words came the end of the phenomenon that was ""Roswell"", quite simply one of the greatest science-fiction shows to ever exist. To be a true Roswellian in this day and age is quite something - most of us who followed the show the first time around are older (and hopefully wiser), but we can still watch these episodes back to back despite being completely out of the age group of the leads on the show. Such is the timelessness of ""Roswell"". Through the years, its' fanbase has grown and grown, and if there is one TV-on-DVD that you need to own other than ""Firefly"", then this is it.Season Three, while being certainly less well-written than the first Season (which remains a classic season, and clearly the best season of Roswell), is essential, because its interesting to see how they tie up the loose ends. Even as a loyal fan of the series, I was disappointed at how rushed some storylines were, and how so many stories were left incomplete or conveniently forgotten about. For example, one of the greatly anticipated storylines carried over from Season One, is when the Alien Mother visits them and tells them to save their home planet. Of course by Season Three, no one seems to care about the home planet or going back, as they all choose to retain their human sides. Fine, but for fans who wanted closure, this season really skimped on that.The final three episodes were the most infuriating. One of the most discussed storylines was of Max's alien son, but in the end, the baby appeared only for one episode, and Max quickly gives the baby up for adoption. This was very weird, and very poorly thought out. It almost destroyed the series for me. The other thing was Katherine Heigl's character. She went from a fierce and stable woman to a simpering, whimpering waif, and this transition was not at all appreciated, or even interesting. What happened to the Isabel of the first season?The final episode has the entire group and their significant others leaving Roswell for good, without even saying goodbye to their families. Max and Liz finally do get married - their wedding is the last scene in the film as they all board a van to go off someplace. This is poignant, yes, but its also shocking at how much of a backstory was promised by the writers, and how little we actually got. Can't blame the makers though - they probably tried their best.As a long time Roswellian, the Third Season frustrated me, like it did a lot of hardcore Roswell fans. Our favorite characters deserved better ends, and Isabel especially deserved more happiness than what she got here.

Since then I have became one of the shows biggest fans. Now after a long wait the release of Roswell Season 3 the Final Chapter will be released on August 9, 2005. I was a bit concerned that the third season would not be as good as the first or second, but to my surprise it was just as good if not better. Roswell is still one of my favorite TV shows. Like the first and second season, season 3 still has a bit of a love story to it, but also keeps that sci-fi feel to it. I have to say I have never cared much for sci-fi series but Roswell is so much more than just that. Like the wonderful first and second season, this third season still takes you on a emotional journey. As you go through each episode you still find yourself growing more and more attached to the characters as they go on their own emotional journey and self discovery. The sad thing is unlike the previous seasons the characters are not always hanging out together at the crash down caf&eacute;. They are doing their own things which is a bit hard for me because I was so accustomed to them being together but I guess it is just part of them growing up. For me Season 3 is much more emotional because I enjoyed this show so much and it was hard to let it go. I have discovered one of the best shows with Roswell, and I can not wait till this final Roswell season 3 set is released on DVD on August 9 2005.ROSWELL"" SEASON THREE DVD COLLECTION Special Features: All episodes are compiled on five discs presented in 1.78:1 widescreen with English Dolby 5.1.

908918,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009NZ2RY,Robert Moore,"[8, 10]","For its 2001-2002 season UPN wanted to upgrade its schedule and appeal more to a younger age group and to this end pulled off one of the bigger TV shockers of the new century and outbid the WB for BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  Less publicized and apparently less well thought out was its acquisition of ROSWELL, which most people thought was going to be cancelled at the end of its second season.  Unfortunately, on UPN the show was never given a real chance to succeed, the network interfering considerably with the show concept and presentation.For context, BUFFY had established a new way of doing a television show for a prime time non-soap:  featuring a single arc over the course of a single season.  ROSWELL was one of the first shows to come along after BUFFY to benefit from this new way of doing narrative on TV.  In contrast, shows from the eighties that features multiple arcs that continued over multiple episodes really didn't attempt to engage in a master story arc.  Season One of ROSWELL was a wonderful piece of narrative story telling, with one episode flowing smoothly into another to tell a story that continued past one episode into the next.  Season Two started breaking up the narrative a bit, engaging in smaller arcs and in more stand alone episodes, but still the emphasis was in telling a big story.  Unfortunately, some of the arcs of Season Two were simply terrible, especially the revelation that our alien teens were actually royalty.  Season Three largely and happily abandoned most of the Royal Family nonsense and refocused the stories on the lives in Roswell of the aliens and their friends.  As a result, there was a greatly improved tone to the show in Season Three over Season Two.  Unfortunately, however, almost all longer arcs were abandoned at network insistence, so there is a sense that the final season really wasn't telling a story in the way that the first two seasons did.Then, of course, UPN pulled the plug.  Not only that, they failed to order a full 22-episode season, leaving the show almost no episodes to wrap up the series.  Unfortunately, the show ends with a host of dangling plot lines and beginnings of stories that would never get told.  For instance, early in the season Liz and Max go after an alien space ship that is being housed under a convenience story.  Obviously, they weren't able to pick that back up later.  Also early in the season, Max and Liz are at a lake and Max jumps in, only to react violently to something in the lake.  Again, this was never picked up on later.  During the course of the season Liz seems to be gaining some powers of her own, but this never gets integrated into the show, nor do we find out whether Kyle, who also had been healed of a mortal wound by Max, would develop powers of his own.  As the show wound down, they had to decide both how to wrap things up as elegantly as possible and which of the dangling arcs they would deal with.  The next to last episode deal with the biggest plotline:  Max's son.  Unfortunately giving only one episode made it feel like it was being dealt with too quickly.  This is hardly the fault of the show's writers and creators, but of UPN by not giving them the extra episodes needed to wrap things up properly.Another major plot line of Season Three that does gets wrapped up, though a bit too quickly for my taste, was the investigation of Max by his father.  Sensing that there are things about Max that need explaining, he begins prying into Max's life on a level he hadn't before.  Eventually things are brought to a head when they spy on Isabel and capture on film her engaging in telekinetic activity.  One would have liked this to be stretched out a bit longer.Still, given the restrictions placed on them, everyone involved managed to make a number of excellent episodes and end the series on a strong note.  Most fans like the way that Max and Liz manage to get together in the final season, though Liz's father makes things difficult for the first half of the season.  Parents play a big role in Season Three, despite the fact that both Liz and Maria's mothers disappear.  John Doe played a much larger role than in the first two seasons, though I have to add that I was always mystified that they didn't try to employ his musical ability more (for those who don't know, he was the front man for the legendary LA punk band X and has a notable solo career as well).  He did strum a guitar in one Season Three episode.  Not everything in the season was peachy, however.  I never warmed up to Adam Rodriguez as Isabel's new husband Jesse Ramirez.  He just never seemed to fit in the show very well.So, Season Three brought the story of three aliens living in Roswell and the friendships they made there to an end.  Given the low ratings is it hard to see how UPN could have justified renewing the show for another season, but it is just terrible that they didn't give them a full season to do a less rushed job of wrapping the show up.  However, one has to add that given the small amount of forewarning they did a good job.  The last episode leaves you with a good feeling, a sense that if it had to end, this was as good as any.  There is a wonderful symmetry.  The first episode of Season One had Max, Isabel, and Michael deciding that they had to leave Roswell because others now knew their secret.  They stayed and when they did finally have to leave in Season Three, they left with Liz, Maria, and Kyle as well, quite the self-made family.",4,Good season despite network interference and

All I know is that the collectible five-disc box set includes all 18 episodes from the third and final season of the cult television phenomenon, following the alien trio and their handful of loyal human friends as the Air Force and FBI close in. The main cast of season 3 is Max, Isabel and Michael. As they prepare to leave Roswell behind, Liz has a shocking vision which makes everyone realize that it is not only the aliens who are in danger but their human friends as well. Some bonus material includes select episode commentaries, ""Class of 2002"" featurette, ""Shiri Appleby's DVD Tour to Japan"" featurette and new cutting-edge songs selected by the original Roswell music team.
