The point of my mentioning that is that titanic was a horrendous movie. this movie, similar in its epic sea bound struggles and beauties is a magnificent piece of work. Tim roth plays the role of 1900 in top form. Tornatore's direction is romantic, elegant and takes you in with the loneliness that is the charactor. I was in high school when this came out and it was my big introduction into the music of morricone. The score for this is one of the most beautiful cinematic compositions i have ever heard. For years i have said that this movie is possibly my favorite movie of all time and it seems as though it is staying there holding that title.",5,a legend of beauty,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,758,"['movie', 'came', 'out', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'i', 'was', 'soarly', 'disgusted', 'horriblness', 'was', 'movie', 'titanic', 'point', 'mentioning', 'titanic', 'was', 'horrendous', 'movie', 'movie', 'similar', 'epic', 'sea', 'struggles', 'beauties', 'magnificent', 'piece', 'work', 'Tim', 'role', '1900', 'top', 'form', 'Tornatore', 'direction', 'romantic', 'elegant', 'loneliness', 'charactor', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'big', 'introduction', 'music', 'morricone', 'score', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'cinematic', 'compositions', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'years', 'i', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'staying', 'there', 'holding', 'title']",N/A

The premise is that a boy was born on a ship in 1900 and never set foot on land, truly a man without a country. The recreations of those olden days were simply a pleasure to behold. As in, the sets and the clothes. Tim Roth is talented, watchable and likeable. A brief appearance by Clarence Williams III is definitely a highlight of this film. Many years after THE MOD SQUAD, it's nice to see him having a bit of a career renaissance with a different generation of viewers.The cover bills this as ""a fable,"" and it is. I could comment on how the ship is a metaphor for the ""average"" life, blah blah blah. It's an old metaphor, perhaps one that worked in the novel. In the film, it was a surface little speech at the end. In essence, this film was about as boring as the one I started watching before it, yet I only saw 30 minutes of the first and the full two hours of this. What's the difference? I love the sound of a piano played by a master, preferably of the fast variety. Our protagonist was written as a prodigy, and I loved it whenever ""he"" played.Incidentally, when I found myself showing THE FIRM to three groups of students in two days, this is how I kept my sanity.

He is an actor's actor and I loved his directorial debut ""the War Zone"" and am presently reading the book by Alexander Stuart.I don't wish to give away the ending, bit I thought he was marvelous.  His humble beginnings began at sea (the Atlantic ocean) where he was abandoned and raised by the crew aboard.  He was a child prodigy, whereas, at about the age of 7 or 8 walked over to the piano and started playing ""magically"" as a professional musician, music that was alive in his head.  As he became a grown man, he played nightly, to the guest's amazement.  He would also entertain those less fortunate in steerage.He was kind, empathetic, sincere, intelligent and witty.  I personally, fell in love with his character and wish this would have been a  book, so I could have really gotten into his heart, soul and mind.He bonded and had a great friendship and rapport with the actor who played the trumpet in the band.  He seemed to appreciate his music and the man he was, more than anyone.  His life was sadly, lonely and sort of out of touch with ""reality"", in the terms of life on land.  The only life which was familiar and ""real to him' was life aboard an ocean liner.Unfortunately, I am having trouble, putting into words  all the emotion in the movie.  It was extremely moving and I found it surprising, that is didn't receive the credit it deserved.  I still, think of it often and find it so very moving and wish I could have known a person as the character he portrayed.By the the way, I own the CD. which is available through Amazon.

What a diversified actor with a talent for facial expression! He manages to capture whatever emotion the character is feeling with such conviction (and it never seems to matter what role he finds himself in) that you will find yourself feeling what he is feeling! Pain. Pleasure. Joy. Peace. Awe. You name it - he accomplishes it! Not many actors can pull that off - not in every role...Tim Roth can and does! I find him to be one of the most versatile, mesmerizing, and underrated actors today! Okay. With that said, now the movie.I caught this movie late one evening on the IFN channel of my local cable station. With so many cookie cutter, special effect hounds, and blockbuster type movies out there, IFN (independant film network) fills the void with clever, charming, and intriguing films...not movies...films! (Yes there is a difference!!!)""The Legend of 1900"" is a refeshing change from the summer of '02 actionfests! This is a simple movie with a simple concept with a profound message for us all delivered in a unique, clever, sentimental, charming, and deeply affecting way. Throughout the film the viewer is torn between two worlds as Roth's character grows. You want him to go, you want him to stay, you cheer for him all the way! You laugh with him, you cry for him. You see the impact this man has on the people around him and then you ache for the narrator at the end of the story! It's bittersweet to watch as this character becomes a man, faces his lonely life head on surrounded by people who love him, but don't really know him. All the while you are comforted by the impact he has on those around him.If this isn't enough reason to see this film...here's another one. My 14 year old son is a typical video game playing, action hero worshiping, Star Wars loving, teenager who is also counting the days until The Two Towers and the Matrix open. He can't sit still during a movie unless it is action packed with battles, fights, and loud sounds... As he came down to say goodnight one evening he stopped to watch this film with me for a few minutes - he thought it was something to do with the Titanic. Knowing it was his bed time, he asked if it would be on again. We checked and found it was scheduled for two days later right after school. I didn't think he'd want to watch it...but also being a Tim Roth fan (he loved Four Rooms and Planet of the Apes) he remembered, watched, and enjoyed the film. Ah - a convert to my side!

To appreciate this fabulous Italian director is to understand that the plot does not really matter in and of itself. The plot here is simle, if unusual, a boy who is a musical genuis - born and living his whole life on a transatlantic liner in the golden age of translatlantic voyages.Those looking for a ""period drama"" will be disappointed here. This movie, like many of Tornatorre's films, is a journey through time and human experiences. The film is interlaced with retrospectives back and forth through time, weaved on a canvas of beautiful images - such is the picture of fascinated passangers arriving in America when they see the statue of Liverty or the main character playing a piano which is ""dancing"" in the ballroom of a ship.This movie is a rich poetic and artistic exerience for those who are willing to take the journey. The music of Enio Morricone is wanderful, the performances are impressive and the experience memorable.Gen on the ship and enjoy the journey!p.s. for those who like the movie, I recommend other Tornatorre/Moricone features, such as ""Malena"" and, of course ""Cinema Paradiso""",5,"A journey, a dream, a fantasy",1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,1170,"['feel', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'Tornatorrwe', 'appreciate', 'fabulous', 'Italian', 'director', 'understand', 'plot', 'not', 'really', 'matter', 'plot', 'here', 'simle', 'unusual', 'boy', 'who', 'musical', 'genuis', 'born', 'living', 'whole', 'life', 'transatlantic', 'liner', 'golden', 'age', 'translatlantic', 'voyages.Those', 'looking', 'period', 'drama', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'here', 'movie', 'many', 'Tornatorre', 'films', 'journey', 'time', 'human', 'experiences', 'film', 'interlaced', 'retrospectives', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'weaved', 'canvas', 'beautiful', 'images', 'such', 'picture', 'fascinated', 'passangers', 'arriving', 'America', 'when', 'see', 'statue', 'Liverty', 'main', 'character', 'playing', 'piano', 'dancing', 'ballroom', 'ship.This', 'movie', 'rich', 'poetic', 'artistic', 'exerience', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'take', 'journey', 'music', 'Enio', 'Morricone', 'wanderful', 'performances', 'are', 'impressive', 'experience', 'memorable.Gen', 'ship', 'enjoy', 'journey', 'p.s', 'who', 'like', 'movie', 'recommend', 'other', 'Tornatorre/Moricone', 'features', 'such', 'Malena', 'course', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso']",N/A

I caught this film late one night and rushed out to buy the DVD the next day.  The music in this film compares with any other I've seen. The only other composer (for film) that I would place Ennio Morricone second to is the legendary Nino Rota. The reason why I love this film so much is flat out for the music.Tim Roth is amazing too. You really feel for his character. Also this film has some of the most beautiful images as expected with a Tornatore film.The only slight problems I found with the film was some of the dialogue.

All of us found it was very impressed and loved it very much. And my heart couldn't be calm because of this movie last night.I found that this pianist had a strange individuality, maybe it was because that he didn't get along with children who were at his age when he was a kid. But he had the talent of playing piano, and he seemed to be care about nothing. Confidence always showed on his face, even if another pianist came to challenge to him. I wondered that whether he has thought of becoming famous, but he thought his music couldn't be separated from him. I could see he was very uncomfortable and a little angry when he listened to the music he played in the record. I couldn't understand why he didn't want to go to the land, then disappeared with the old ship in the explosion, forever, and what left were pity and sadness, to his friend, and everyone loved him so much, also to us. How large the world will be enough for him, I wondered.I don't know what I said all above, but one of my friends online said, ""Only the Sea and the ship could contain the life and dreams of this talented pianist."" I think he was right, only the waves could make the pianist find the feeling of playing. So, the day when the ship must be exploded was the day when he had to go to the land, also the day to the end of his life. When I saw he looked up to the disreputable deck with his eyes filled with sadness and hopelessness, I could hardly hold back my tears.Hmm...

The strength of the story lies in the human journey of life, the poetic script and the delivery of lines, the hauntingly beautiful music and cinematography, the strong acting of a fine cast, the thoughtful production and vision of the director- all the elements we come to appreciate in European films as opposed to the pedestrian Hollywood box office stuff.  It's an Italian production directed by Giuseppe Tornatore and made in Rome.Tim Roth shines. Don't miss his stunning performance.The story begins with the touching scene of Max, a down and out talented musician selling his trumpet at a pawn shop for next to nothing to buy a decent meal.  He begged to play his trumpet one last time and began to play the music created by a ""nameless"" pianist known as 1900. The indifferent pawnbroker was at once moved by the music and curious about the story behind.Max reminisced the past on how he got to know 1900 when he played on the luxurious ocean liner, Virginian.  His first meeting scene with 1900 is absolutely mesmerising.  He was so sea sick that 1900 showed him the way to cure his misery - the now famous piano ride scene- with 1900 playing magical music on a moving grand piano (with brakes taken off).  It's an amazingly breathtaking scene that completely captivates the audience with the piano surging backward and forward to the rhythm of the rough sea, crashing everything in the way and landing them in trouble with the ship captain.  While being punished to shovel coal in the engine room, 1900's story was told.He was a newborn foundling in a lemon box on top of a grand piano in the first class cabin discovered by an engine room coal stoker.  Hardship and harshness of life had not diminished his kindness of heart and yearning for love so he raised the boy to avoid the boy's doomed fate of an orphanage.Audience will be moved and enjoy how 1900 still talked about people would be locked up in an orphanage if they don't have children as his adoptive father told him once in jest when he was little. This is 1900's own quiet way of coping with his private grief and keeping his adoptive father's memory alive.1900 knew little beyond the confines of the ship and was innocent and naive of the ways of the world.  His communication and interaction with people were through his music which he created instinctively to express himself and in response to his immediate environment through his keen observations of people and the world around him.He was born to make music on the piano with magical fingers which impressed the ship captain and others so much that he was allowed to stay on board to entertain after his adoptive father died in an engine room accident and was adored by all. But there would be lonely moments when he and his music were left abandoned by the adoring crowd after the ship docked and passengers flocked ashore to their respective lives and then he was all alone again with his piano.Through some lovely and thoughtful piano recital scenes for both first and third class passengers, the director shows us how unaffected 1900 was and how he was totally comfortable mixing with the rich and the poor unconscious of class distinction.  He was as relaxed with the rich in his tailed tuxedo in first class cabin as with the poor immigrants in the third class cabin who would utter some incomprehensible notes and asked 1900 to play a tune that reminded them of the home they left behind. 1900 would make magical music just on hearing a tune once, to the delight of the crowd.The three landmark episodes of his life were played out in the following poignant scenes:-1) His humble response to the ostentatious King of Jazz's bully and challenge to a piano duel. Watch out for how they use a cigarette to prove who has the lightest butterfly fingers whilst making the most earth shattering music and how he plays as if he had two pairs of hands.2) His gentle, brief yet profound encounter with the girl, a third class passenger, the power of which lies with the director's deliberate intent to leave an indelible mark on the audience through the unsaid, the unspoken and the unrequited love.3) His trust and friendship with Max culminating to the bittersweet ending of the story through his most endearing and enduring soliloquy about his fear of life not so much because of what he saw but what he didn't see -""Where the whole thing came to an end...how do you just choose one woman, one house, one piece of land to call your own, one landscape to look at ...one way to die...you don't even know where it all comes to an end...it's a voyage too long, perfume too strong...

The last year of the last century.It was an immensely unsuccessful movie in U.S unlike the other Tornatore movie ,i.e Cinema Paradiso. I pondered the reason why it was not only unpopular but also received such a mixed bag of reviews from critics ,then concluded that it is because of the huge difference of emotional receptiveness between U.S viewers and those of rest of the world. In addition to that, to majority of viwers, the movie's almost mawkish sentiment might be more than over the top as well as the larger than life character of 1900 seems to be quite unreal. Yet, as the cover of DVD says it is a fable , not realistic quotidian drama. In spite of its dismal performance in the U.S movie market,fortunately, it earned  such as cult status among its royal fans. It deserves its ""cult"" status though ,for acting , cinematography, and message it tries to convey is more than those of 2 or 3 star movies.This movie is very nostalgic one that make viewers look back the last century through the life of very fictional character named 1900( originally his name is Danny Boodman T.D Lemon 1900 after a stocker who became his surrogate father) who is born and died on the ship called ""Virginan"" and never set his food in land. 1900 is a some sort of Piano virtuos who can express the change of his emotion by the dint of playing the instrument. He and Max, through his narration movie progresses, meet by chance and subsequently there is very memorable scene that clearly cements their friendship. What truly superb about this movie is its wonderful soundtrack and cinematography. Lajos Koltai kept delivering a beautiful scene one after the other . 1900 is one of  very accentric protagonists ever..

One may find the movie inescapable as the ship that 1900 found inescapable. I know my wife and I were drawn in from the beginning. Imagine seeing a baby found on a piano while a coal stoker is searching the dance floor for something of value dropped by a passenger. The baby is given the name TD Lemon Daniel Boone 1900 based on a lemon box he was found in, his finder's name, and the year he is found. He goes by 1900. We then follow this child till adulthood on board the ""Virginian"" a luxury liner from the turn of the century to some time after World War II. The stoker raises the child until he is killed at his job. The ship's crew then takes on parenting until he is a man. From childhood to manhood he shows himself to be an accomplished piano player. His ability to play anything from jazz to classical is phenomenal. He gains fame aboard ship but he never steps off it.

Here he depicts the travelers to America, in a liner full of immigrants from various parts of Europe. They arrive, get ecstatic to see the Statue of Liberty, America is in sight. But not all of them get out. A baby is born there--in 1900--and never leaves the ship. He is a gifted musician, plays the piano and composes original and exciting music, and his sidekick who plays the trumpet urges him to get out and visit New York. He stays in the ship until it blown to pieces. Tim Roth is superb as the alienated man who finds in music and the piano keys a sort of infinity which gives him all the space he requires. Whether this is a metaphor for musical eternity, or self-sufficiency, we do not know. Stylistically glamorous, the movie offers generous soundtrack music, reminding somewhat of Being There, with Peter Sellers, a man who only lived in a garden and learned life by watching TV. A sort of modern Gregor Samsa, Tim Roth, nicknamed 1900, achieves a self-willed immortality by denying any other existence but that of the self. The piano has only a definite number of notes, but its music can achieve infinity. A human being that does not need the external world. And an America on which he never sets foot, for the infinitude inside him suffices. The ship, eventually a useless wreck, is blown up, and he with it. Incidentally, by missing America, he also missed the girl, the only thing he really wanted, but lost when she left the ship. She had understood his music.

It takes place entirely on a ship at sea, but the action spans more than 40 years. It is the story of a musical genius who is born, lives out his life, and ultimately dies on board a grand trans-Atlantic liner in the first half of the 20th century. He watches the world pass him by just a few thousand people at a time, has a fabulous piano-duel with none other than Jelly Roll Morton, is sought after by recording companies, and listens to and learns from the music of all the different cultures who are emigrating from the Old World to the New, but he never once leaves the ship. Indeed, the mere thought of setting foot on land is his ultimate nightmare.I remember having a guest over one evening who was seeing it for the very first time. His reaction (after wiping a tear from his eye) was to exclaim ""what a wonderful movie! How did anyone even get a film that quirky made?"" There is no Hollywood 'formula' to this film.

It may not be up there with your first time having sex but I do guarantee that you will never forget this film, its acting (and not only by Mr. Roth but the entire cast simply excells). If you ever get trapped into &#34;having&#34; to what your wife would  consider to be a &#34;chick flick&#34;, you will make her (and yourself), extremely happy by chosing this movie to watch with your significant other.In short, this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen in every aspect. If you need another Tim Roth movie to watch under the same potentially &#34;slit your wrist because you have to watch a chick flick movie&#34;, Mr. Roth has a smaller role in another movie called I believe &#34;Beautiful Country&#34; (might be wrong but I think its the only pairing of Mr. Roth and Nick Nolte. Again, Mr. Roths role in the latter movie is much smaller than his lead in The Legend of 1900 but once again his performance like every performance I have seen the man in is unforgettable. Always complicated, multi layered and outstanding.

699761,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B000065KH2,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[2, 3]","Upon searching through the long and windy halls of Netflix Watch Instantly one day, I came across this film with a premise that intrigued me. Two hours and five minutes later, speechless throughout most of the movie, I decided that it was not only one of the best dramas I had ever seen, but one of the best films I'd ever seen. Truly, The Legend is a 1900 is one of the most beautiful and moving films in modern film history, an overlooked classic, and a tribute to the Piano in every sense of the word.Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon 1900 was found orphaned, most likely born to and forgotten by immigrant parents, aboard the Virginian a luxury steamliner much like the Titanic, by a steam room worker. He took in the child as his own and named him Danny Boodmann (After himself) T.D. Lemon (After the advertisement on the box he was found in) 1900 (After the year he was found in). He is a man without a birthday, he is a man without a country, he is a man born to The Virginian. 1900 proceeds to live out his childhood in the ship, learning about the world and the languages of the passengers until one day, the crew discovers he's a piano virtuoso, and soon after that, he becomes part of the ships orchestra, as word of his talent is spread by anybody that has ever heard him. Occasionally, the film also flashes forward to around 1945, where The Virginian is being prepped to be scrapped after World War 2, but with 1900 still aboard, and his friend Max's efforts to get him off.Being the only English-language film of the Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore, the film is incredibly beautiful to look at. The striking beauty of the ship is one of the most stunning aspects, choosing to accent backdrops and provide a unique setting for the proceedings. The cinematography of the film is so well-done, as is with the rest of the film, I'm very disappointed that this was Tornatore's only English work, since his use of the language of the film is also very well done, considering most of the crew, including the screenwriters I believe, were Italian. But not only is the film striking as a whole, there's just so many memorable scenes in here that are simply brilliant in the way they are composed and played out. And what do all but two of these 7 or 8 scenes that stick out in my mind have in common? All of them involve the piano. I'm not a big fan of classical music by any means, but the instrumental works, and the way they're shown on screen is unequivocally magnificent. Composed mostly by Ennio Morricone, this is truly one of the aspects that makes the film stand out for me.Tim Roth leads out the cast played by relative unknowns to my mind, and he gives the performance of a career. After watching this film, I came out with a great deal of respect for Roth as he displayed acting talent I didn't even know he was capable of. He sells every aspect of 1900 perfectly. Whether it's the humorous side of the character, the quite side, the peaceful side, the cursing side, the romantic side, or the speech-making side, Roth makes you invested in the character, as if the character development in the movie weren't enough. I don't know if Roth actually learned to play the piano for this movie, but he sold me on that too. Pruitt Taylor Vince also plays the character of Max well, and even though he isn't asked to do all that much, he did a fine job portraying his lifelong friendship with 1900.I don't want to use the word ""beautiful"" too much in this review, but it aptly describes this movie. Some have called it epic, but it's only epic in its emotions. This movie will valiantly attempt to bring tears to your eyes, laughter, and everything in between. There's a particular scene where 1900 comes to accept his fate the only way he knows how, by playing the piano. But in this scene, there is no piano to play, so he plays air piano. But instead of cheesy, it's touching. There's no words needed to tell the audience the gravity of this scene and this moment, but you feel it. And that's what a movie should do. It should make you feel. It's only a couple hours long, but those couple of hours were all that I needed to be turned into an emotional wreak.",5,Danny Boodmann T.D.

699762,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000065KH2,"""flickjunkie""","[7, 9]","Director Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) has lovingly crafted a bittersweet story about life, music and the intricate weave of one upon the other.  Tornatore caresses the heart with characters steeped in emotion and sentimentality without descending into sappiness (okay, maybe just a little at the end).The setting is turn of the 20th century.  On New Year's Day, a baby is abandoned on an ocean liner and adopted by one of the crew members who names him ""1900"".  The boy never leaves the vessel and crosses back and forth for his whole life.  As a child he learns to play piano and proves himself to be a genius at the instrument.The story is interesting by itself, but Tornatore brings incredible feeling to the tale.  1900 has an amazing gift of being able to put not only his emotions to music, but characterizations of others he sees around the room.  All his pieces are impromptu and as original as the people surrounding him.Tim Roth is fantastic in the lead role, displaying extraordinary range.  He renders a believable pianist, but more importantly, he simultaneously brings the character dynamism and depth.  When he is playing the crowd he is the flamboyant showman, yet when he is alone or with Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) he is reflective and moody.Pruitt Taylor Vince also comes through with a strong performance as 1900's close friend and fellow musician.  Vince plays the part with great empathy and the interactions between him and Roth are often moving.  Clarence Williams III (yes, that's Linc from the Mod Squad TV series in the 60's) is electrifying as Jelly Roll Morton, the self proclaimed inventor of jazz.  Williams steals the show for at least 15 minutes as he and Roth duel it out on the piano.The music is exquisite.  Ennio Morricone is a prolific composer whose career spans 40 years with five Oscar nominations.  He has scored over 400 films including &quot;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Disclosure&quot;, and &quot;Twister&quot;.  His ability to find the right music for the multiple moods in this film is astounding.For viewers who enjoy complex character studies replete with unabashed sentimentality, this film is worth hunting down at the movie store.

699770,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000065KH2,Jeffrey Leach,"[21, 23]","I am always delighted to discover a new Tim Roth film. Like most filmgoers, I first saw this amazing actor flaunting his talent in Quentin Tarentino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" a decade ago. Obviously, I haven't seen every Tim Roth film, but every one that I have seen him in is usually good. Even if the film itself isn't that great, Roth still shines. Consider his small but critical role in Tarentino's ""Pulp Fiction."" With barely any screen time he still managed to contribute something special to the scenes he appeared in. The same goes for Peter Greenaway's ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover,"" which I think was Roth's first film role. He showed up in only a couple of scenes, yet stood out in a stellar cast that included Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren. Another great Roth movie is ""Rob Roy,"" where he plays a depraved prot&eacute;g&eacute; of a character played by John Hurt. Again, this actor easily held his ground. All of this blather brings me to ""Legend of 1900,"" a marvelous picture that shows Tim Roth can do the leading man thing just as easily as he can work in a supporting role. I guess I can understand some people not liking Roth, but I don't understand why they don't like this movie. It's a gem.Most of the film takes place on one of those luxurious ocean liners so popular as a means of transportation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One day, a grunt from the engine room named Danny (Bill Nunn) discovers an abandoned baby in the ship. Not knowing what to do about such a startling find, he decides to keep the little guy and raise him as his own son. With the help of some of his fellow employees, Danny also decides to name the infant 1900 as a tribute to the start of the new century. You would think a young baby on board an ocean liner might draw attention, but Danny keeps 1900 out of sight for years by keeping him in the engine room during work hours and in the sleeping quarters the rest of the time. The ship's crew is so busy dealing with the passengers that they hardly have time to notice one kid wandering around from time to time. But when a young 1900 hears a piano playing in the ship's lounge, he strolls inside for a closer look and ends up playing some tunes for the amazed passengers. When someone notifies the captain, he realizes the profit in having this young prodigy stay on and play the piano for the passengers. After Danny perishes in an accident, 1900 becomes a sort of mascot for the ship as well as its star music attraction. Most importantly, he never leaves the ship.We learn about the story of 1900 through a series of flashbacks from his best friend and fellow musician Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince). His story positively enthralls the owner of pawnshop to whom Max is attempting to sell his trumpet. For example, when Max first signed up to play with the ship's band, his inability to acquire his sea legs led to long bouts of nausea until 1900 stepped into the picture. He took the trumpet player on a most memorable tour of the lounge--you need to see it to believe it--that miraculously cures his seasickness and turns the two men into fast friends. Max also relates a lengthy story about 1900's duel with legendary musician Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III). The jazz great, amazed and angered to hear that a white musician on this ship plays the piano better than he does, arrives onboard to show this upstart who is the boss. After a lengthy back and forth battle of the ivories, good old Jelly Roll retreats with his tail between his legs. The story never reaches a wider audience because 1900 won't leave the ship and he won't record his music. His failure to do both of these things, even for the girl he falls in love with (played by Melanie Thierry), leads to obscurity and ultimate doom.I enjoyed this film. Roth does his usual bang up job as the melancholy yet supremely talented piano player 1900. His monologue delivered to Max towards the end of the film, explaining why he could never find it in his heart to leave the ship, is a wonderful piece of acting. Pruitt Taylor Vince was a good choice to play 1900's best friend and sometime confidant, and he also provides some much needed comic relief when the movie turns serious. The best part of the film, however, has to be the music, which should not come as a surprise considering this is a film where music essentially acts as a co-star. None other than the great Ennio Morricone scored ""Legend of 1900,"" and he did his usual fabulous job. The movie, I think, even won Morricone a Golden Globe award. As good as these elements are, I did have one problem with the movie: the CGI effects. The filmmakers often used computers to create the ship, and they also used them to create a whole city when 1900 makes his lone attempt to leave the boat. You know how there are good CGI and bad CGI effects? ""Legend of 1900"" uses bad CGI. Still, this small difficulty rarely intrudes on the story and does not act as a deterrent to enjoying the film.I also liked the extras on the DVD if for no other reason than hearing the song Roger Waters composed for the film. Called ""Lost Boys Calling,"" it's always great to hear the former front man for Pink Floyd recording new music. Aside from the music video for this song, the disc offers us a trailer and filmographies. Give this one a shot if you like colorful, introspective European films.",5,Magical,1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,5389,"['am', 'always', 'delighted', 'discover', 'new', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'film', 'most',

699773,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000065KH2,Joseph Haschka,"[75, 82]","THE LEGEND OF 1900  has as its protagonist a man named D.B.T.D.L. 1900. The &quot;1900&quot; is indicative of the year he was born and found abandoned on a luxury ocean liner, the &quot;Virginian&quot;, after its passengers had disembarked in New York. Let it suffice to say that the other initials stand for the ship's crewman that discovered him, and the brand name on the produce crate in which he was lying.The time frame of this film can be tricky at the beginning unless one pays attention. The &quot;now&quot; is, apparently, after WWII. After pawning his trumpet in an English hockshop, Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) begs to play it one last time. While doing so, the pawnbroker recognizes the melody as that played on a piano on an old record. He spins it for Max, who identifies the pianist as 1900, whom he met in 1927 when he (Max) signed aboard the Virginian as a band member. In a flashback, he recalls the story of 1900's birth, emphasizing that the man never ever left the liner to set foot on solid land. On being asked where he found the disk, purportedly the master copy of the recording session and the only one in existence, the shop owner says it was hidden in a piano that came off an old hospital ship berthed in the harbor. On going to the dock, Max recognizes the rusting hulk as the Virginian, which is in the process of being loaded with explosives designed to scuttle the vessel. Convinced that 1900 is still aboard and hiding, he insists on a search. Interspersed with this activity are more flashbacks to the 20s and 30s when Max played with 1900 in the ship's main ballroom.THE LEGEND OF 1900 is not a perfect film by any means. The character of The Girl (Melanie Thierry) and her relationship with 1900 are left frustratingly underdeveloped. Sad-faced Tim Roth is wonderful as the enigmatic 1900, who is perhaps too inscrutable. (But, then, legends generally are, or they wouldn't be legends. Remember the old saw, &quot;Familiarity breeds contempt.&quot;) Without the monolog by 1900 towards the end when he explains himself to Max, the viewer would be left with precious little of the former to fathom. However, one thing is known for sure - 1900 is a phenomenal musical talent. He can play a melody on the piano, no matter how complex, after having heard it only once. He demonstrates this and more (wow!) during a &quot;dueling pianos&quot; session with Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III), the &quot;inventor&quot; of jazz, who comes aboard for an Atlantic crossing just so he can challenge the famous upstart. And, in perhaps the film's most entrancing scene, 1900 plays the piano in the deserted ballroom while the ship rolls in the ocean swells. 1900 has unlocked the piano's anchor wheels, so the instrument glides serenely back and forth over the dance floor while managing not to hit anything until ... well, you have to see it.Viewed as a tragic figure, the viewer will understand 1900 when he says, &quot;The world has passed me by 2000 people at a time.&quot;  The film is bittersweet to be sure, but well done.

699777,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000065KH2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","""The Legend of 1900"" is another movie that might get me into trouble here on Amazon. It seems to be beloved by most reviewers, but ultimately--while there are some strong points--this is a film that just doesn't work for me. Being a fan of Tornatore's ""Cinema Paradiso,"" I looked forward greatly to this story--billed as a fable of a musical prodigy who is born and raised on a ship, never setting foot on land. And while ""Paradiso"" is a subtle homage to the movies, ""1900"" tries to cover similar territory with classical and jazz music.The music is beautiful, and whenever Tim Roth as the titular 1900 (it's his name) sits down at the piano--the movie comes alive. Music is the heart and breath of this picture. Roth is very good in the lead, but I would expect nothing less. This quiet oddball is a bit of a departure for the generally more intense Roth. His relationship with Pruitt Taylor Vince as his best friend and fellow musician is nicely played. If the film had concentrated more on them realistically and less on the ""fable"" aspect, I feel it would have been far more successful.Unfortunately, the narrative is told in an unnecessary flashback style with Vince relating the fable to various parties. These modern sequences are awkwardly inserted into the more compelling material. And they lack a bit of logic, as well. While no one has supposedly ever heard of 1900, he is presented in the flashbacks as a famous and notorious personality. In fact, the world's best jazz musician even comes aboard to challenge him to a piano duel--so his reputation must be known beyond the ship.Too much of the visual style is over-the-top and fanciful. Here, we are hitting on that ""fable"" again. One great sequence involves Roth playing the piano as it sails around the deck--it is at once beautiful and ridiculous--but it's taken too far so it becomes slapstick instead of poetry. By pulling back just a little in most sequences, Tornatore might really have improved his epic.Aside form Tim Roth and Pruitt Taylor Vince, nobody speaks in a real ""voice."" The dialogue can be extremely clunky and the delivery out of left field. I don't know if this had to do with international actors using English phonetically, but perhaps something is lost in the translation. Listen especially to the ambient crowd chatter--it is absolutely inane. And while this may seem like a small point, it distracted me to maximum effect. This could have been fixed easily by a sound effects editor. Also, as Taylor Vince relates 1900's story, the reactions that he gets are bizarrely overacted. There isn't a natural flow to the piece because much of it seems forced.Recommended for Roth and the music, ""The Legend of 1900"" is an interesting failure. Scaled back in it's excesses and shortened, it had the capacity to be a great film. I wished they would have trusted the story because I could have done without most of the outlandish and over-the-top accouterments. About 2 1/2 stars from me--I'm rounding up so I don't get slaughtered.

I could hear glasses tinkle and footsteps, and all the background stuff, but no voices...and oh my goodness...the music! Most enchanting and enthralling of all is the scene where they have decided after all these years, to finally record the main character playing his music.  As fate would have it, it happens on a day when a naturally pretty immigrant girl just happens to catch the eye of the pianist through a porthole, and what emerges from his fingers and the piano keys is one of the most poignantly romantic pieces of music to touch the hardest of hearts anyone has ever heard! You  can tell just what he must be feeling just from the sound of the music. (I replayed this part over and over several times the first time I saw this movie).  This film is one of those that you are likely to feel skeptical about at first, but will turn out to be one that you are ultimately glad you got just because of the feelings and emotions it will invoke in you through the music.

It was also kind of unbelievable that someone could be born on a cruise line, left behind, and be raised by employees.  At some point someone would intervene and take pity on a poor waif like 1900, but alas, it didn't happen.  It was an amazing story, nevertheless as we see the unfolding of the life of a man who becomes a celebrity on board ship because he is a talented pianist.  None of the music he plays is anything anyone has ever heard--it's all his own!  He is even challenged by the very notable Jelly Roll Morton, probably the greatest jazz and ragtime piano player of that time.  1900 also has the special talent of being able to read people which is kind of interesting because he really hasn't had many personal relationships in a life where his whole world view is from a ship.  He knows which people are stowaways, are potential criminals, have something to hide, and no one is the wiser.  Tim Roth really shines in this role and makes the character come alive.  His good and only friend, Max, played by Pruitt Taylor Vince acts as the narrator in this film and he plays an itinerant musician down on his luck very well.One of the best parts of this movie is the music of the jazz age and the dancing that goes on.  There are some humorous parts also as we see 1900 learning to read by looking at racing forms.  There's also the scene with Jelly Roll, played by Clarence Williams III which is pretty funny.

Novocento (played in his adult scenes by the always wonderful Tim Roth) has never set foot on dry land. After he grows up, he gets a job on the ship as a pianist and becomes fast friends with the ship's new trumpet player, Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince). The story is told in flashback by Max as he pawns his trumpet.The story of 1900 is the story of the passing of an era; to hear Max tell it, 1900 invented jazz (and in one of the film's climactic scenes, he's challenged to a piano duel by Jelly Roll Morton [Clarence Williams III]; the final seconds of this scene are truly unforgettable) and was, in his time, the most popularmusician on earth-- but he only allowed his music to be recorded once, and he destoryed the wax pressing afterwards in a fit of pique. Ah, but times pass, and the music, the cruise ship, and the man went out of fashion.The movie didn't spend much time on American shores, and that is truly a crime. If you get a chance to rent the video, do so. Roth is above even his usual level of excellence, Vince is finally given a role that his minor pieces in many great films (Barfly, The End of Violence, Jacob's Ladder, etc.) have convinced us he was capable of and he handles it with aplomb, and the music is marvelous.

This is a surface level film, looks good but nothing happening underneath. Its almost like the movie was a vehicle for the terrific music. Makes we wonder if the music came 1st...Besides the music the characters are weak and have little depth. Why is it the supporting actor, a trumpet playing best friend, despite being about the same age as 1900 (24) acts like some wise sage when lecturing to him at times?? Also the supporting actor's acting is a bit...transparent... His character if given more screen time would of been really annoying. The plot is simple, but thats fine, most of the best movies have a simple plot. Some people are upset by the ending, but it works and makes sense to me. I suppose I must mention the racial angle which also angered some viewers. I to rolled my eyes when he defeats Jelly-Roll, who I seriously doubt was so extravagant and wealthy due to his exploitation by the white music business owner's system. I also doubt they would let him enter and leave using the main ship exit.

First of all, as a pianist, I can tell you that the piano ""faking"" by Roth and Williams is FABULOUS! (We won't go into the trumpet mimicry, although I think Pruitt Taylor Vince is a major talent.)

It would make a mesmerizing stage musical, and I hope to see that someday. If you love magical,romantic, witty and intelligent fables, this is for you.
