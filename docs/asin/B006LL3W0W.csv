1517000,A2S11NSTM645SN,B006LL3W0W,David M. Perry,"[1, 1]","""Wyatt Earp's Revenge"" is a very weak addition to the Earp legend in film. It centers around an early incident in Earp's life while he was a peace officer in Dodge City. The biggest name in the cast is Val Kilmer, and he plays Earp in older age (he originally had a star-turn as Doc Holiday in ""Tombstone,"" a much superior movie to this one). The story is slow moving and poorly written. The cinematography is very good. The horses seemed doped up like the horse used for kiddy rides. The performers in the film, save Kilmer and the fellow playing Doc Holiday, were chosen more for their looks than acting skills. Trace Adkins is particularly acting challenged, and should not quit his day job -- country music singing. The story centers on a group of top lawmen of the era: Wyatt Earp, Charlie Basset, Bill Tilghman, and Bat Masterson; but none of the actors portraying these figures has the gravitas to convince anyone they are master lawmen. In fact, they were constantly getting surprised, shot up, and captured at gunpoint by the bad guys, who seemed to be well on top of their game. If you want to see movies about Earp, get ""Tombstone,"" ""Wyatt Earp"" with Kevin Costner, or even ""My Darling Clementine"" with Henry Fonda (a film that had no relation to actual historical events).",2,Lame Western,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1284,"['Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Revenge', 'very', 'weak', 'addition', 'Earp', 'legend', 'film', 'early', 'incident', 'Earp', 'life', 'was', 'peace', 'officer', 'Dodge', 'City', 'biggest', 'name', 'cast', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Earp', 'older', 'age', 'originally', 'had', 'star-turn', 'Doc', 'Holiday', 'Tombstone', 'much', 'superior', 'movie', 'one', 'story', 'slow', 'moving', 'poorly', 'written', 'cinematography', 'very', 'good', 'horses', 'seemed', 'doped', 'up', 'horse', 'used', 'kiddy', 'rides', 'performers', 'film', 'save', 'Kilmer', 'fellow', 'playing', 'Doc', 'Holiday', 'were', 'chosen', 'more', 'looks', 'acting', 'skills', 'Trace', 'Adkins', 'particularly', 'acting', 'challenged', 'should', 'not', 'quit', 'day', 'job', 'country', 'music', 'singing', 'story', 'centers', 'group', 'top', 'lawmen', 'era', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Charlie', 'Basset', 'Bill', 'Tilghman', 'Bat', 'Masterson', 'none', 'actors', 'portraying', 'figures', 'gravitas', 'convince', 'anyone', 'are', 'master', 'lawmen', 'fact', 'were', 'constantly', 'getting', 'surprised', 'up', 'captured', 'gunpoint', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'well', 'top', 'game', 'want', 'see', 'movies', 'Earp', 'get', 'Tombstone', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'even', 'Darling', 'Clementine', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'film', 'had', 'relation', 'actual', 'historical', 'events']",Wyatt Earp's Revenge

1517003,AYG1U47VFZ165,B006LL3W0W,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[14, 15]","The story of Wyatt Earp has been a popular fascination for people throughout the years.  Certainly, anyone who's heard of the `Gunfight at the O.K. Corral' knows there's a bit more to the story of the famous lawman - several great loves, a whole cadre of impressive partners, and famous meetings with some of history's notorious baddies.  Indeed, the O.K. Corral story has been told several times - many of them as very successful pictures - but there's even been a television show exploring the man's history, as well as scores of books involving his notable place in the dying days of the wild West.But before there was Wyatt and Doc and Virgil and Morgan and their scandalous days in Tombstone, Arizona, there was a younger Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, and that's the stomping grounds for Sony Pictures' latest DVD release, WYATT EARP'S REVENGE.Regarding the story, viewers turning in with expectations for yet another version of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral are bound to find themselves a bit confused, as REVENGE deals solely with Earp's time in Dodge City.  In this timeframe, there's no mention of `things to come,' though there was a storytelling device that could've hinted more at future events.  Specifically, this film recounts the events surrounding Wyatt's ride to bring the fugitive to justice for the murder of singer Dora Hand (a love interest of his).  Wyatt convinces some of the best guns in the West to join him in his quest for justice, and his posse includes Bat Masterson (played by Matt Dallas), Charlie Bassett (Scott Whyte), and Bill Tilghman (Levi Fiehler).  As fate would have it, REVENGE also features the brief initial meeting of Wyatt and the celebrated Doc Holliday (Wilson Bethel).  The film opens later in Wyatt's life, where the aging lawman meets with a young `reporter' for the purposes of clearing up a bit of confusion regarding the past.  This structure serves the picture well, and it's probably the narrative's greatest strength.As luck would have it, Val Kilmer may just be one of the few actors in the history of cinema to be given the unique distinction of playing both the legendary lawman - Wyatt Earp - as well as his gunslinging counterpart Doc Holliday, which Kilmer played to great effect in George P. Cosmatos's 1993 film, TOMBSTONE.  To be honest, Kilmer's outing as Earp in REVENGE is more of a supporting role; his work as the elder lawman is interspersed in segments throughout the picture, and actor Shawn Roberts handles the reins of Wyatt in his younger years.  Personally, I thought Kilmer handled himself quite well in both roles, but let's face it: Holliday is always gonna chew more scenery than Earp.As I always do, I tend to try to read up a bit on films depicting moments from history, and I did the same with REVENGE.  Without going into any details (as that would spoil some of what gets explored here), I'm led to believe that there are a few ""facts"" played fast and loose in the story as presented.  Some of that may very well be due to the fact that there are slightly differing versions of accounts for what precisely happened.  However, I think it's relatively safe to conclude - as I'm no expert on the subject matter, though I've read a few Earp books regarding Tombstone - that the picture doesn't take any huge leaps away from the major elements.  I think that when storytellers venture into the historical past, they do have a measure of responsibility to remain as true as possible; I've no doubt that an honest effort was made.  Where details have been `tweaked' was probably done more so from the standpoint of spinning a more interesting yarn than it was to be a deliberate misrepresentation of facts.  (I hope that's sufficiently spoiler-free!)However, if you're looking to get the most out of your viewing experience, then I'd strongly encourage you to go into REVENGE cold.  Don't bone up on the history.  Don't pull out any other films featuring Wyatt Earp or Doc Holliday.  Don't even put on your favorite Trace Adkins CD (he's featured in brief cameo as one of the notables from the account of these experiences).  Go into this one cold, and methinks you'll be pleasantly entertained with this modern `oater.'  (For those of you who don't know, `oater' is what Hollywood originally called `Westerns.')  It may not be all that grand, but, as promised, it's pleasant enough.Mostly, REVENGE is a harmless diversion.  It doesn't boast the best production qualities seen in a contemporary Western as most of the principles are immaculately dressed and squeaky clean despite riding hours on end.  Also, while the producers made pretty solid use of shooting locations, most of the sets were similarly `brand-new' looking, missing the usual wear and tear common to so much of the West as perhaps more accurately depicted in other films.  Still, it's shot with a bright palette (again, maybe not the best directorial choice), and the colors are crisp in presentation.  It has that ""TV movie"" look throughout, almost like it was all along intended to be a small release or direct-to-DVD property.  Sound quality is acceptable throughout, though there were a few sequences that were obviously re-recorded subsequent to filming.  The disc features a single special feature; titled ""Riding Along with Wyatt Earp,"" the short piece is essentially a series of brief interviews with the actors about acting in a Western wherein riding horses was a requirement.  Not Earth-shattering, but pleasant nonetheless.RECOMMENDED for fans of Westerns, though purists will find plenty of faults with some aforementioned details.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Carl Samrock Public Relations, Inc. provided me with a DVD screener copy of the film by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,2 & 1/2 Stars:

1517004,A2RIRJJPGPMM8N,B006LL3W0W,Everyone's_a_critic,"[3, 4]","Wow. This movie was a turkey. I've been collecting every film ever done on Wyatt Earp, and each one in its on way has a greatness to it. Until now. Truthfully, I only bought 'Revenge' to complete the collection. Why? I saw it coming... this video has turkey sign all over it:1) It was made after 'Wyatt Earp' and 'Tombstone'. Those movies set the bar so high one would have to wonder why anyone would bother remaking the Earp story for quite a long time.2) It has Val Kilmer playing Wyatt Earp. 'nuff said.3) The title alone casts suspicion.Once into the movie you notice all the things the other reviewers have commented on. Nice looking costumes... but they look like they just came off the rack. The titles stated the movie was based on a real event. Key word here is ""based on"", if even that much is true. There's way to much ""I-got-the-drop-on-you... no... I-got-the-drop-on-you... no I-got-the-drop-on-you... ad infinitum"". I also didn't like the way they handled the sexual assualt of the prairie wife. The whole scene with that family was stretched to the point that the story turned into a (bad) horror flick.

Spike was the son of a wealthy Texas rancher Captain Mifflin Kenedy who, with Richard King, had founded the King Ranch, one of the largest sources of income for Dodge City and the rest of the territory.The story is told to a newspaper reporter who has a special interest in hearing the story, from the perspective of Wyatt Earp in 1907.  This special interest is revealed at the end.Finding opposition from Judge Hinkle to issue arrest warrants Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson and Charlie Bassett turn in their badges to go after the Kenedy Brothers. Along the way they pick up Bill Tilghman which creates one of the most famous posses of the Old West.Spike Kenedy left a trail of bodies in his path as he headed home.  There were no redeeming qualities presented about this man--he was ruthless and took what he wanted.  Murder was a game to him.Along the way they meet Doctor John Henry Holiday.  Wilson Bethel of Hart of Dixie plays the infamous dentist and lunger, who would become Wyatt Earp's best friend, with a certain finesse.  His character was the only one in the film that seemed gleefully happy.  The other actors were very stoic men.Val Kilmer plays the laconic, aging legend in 1907 who gives a low-key but powerful performance as he relates the story from 1878.  There is a sadness about Wyatt which is given proper attention.Diana DeGarmo of American Idol fame plays Dora Hand, the young actress who fell in love with Wyatt.  Wyatt's duty and his desire for a normal life are contrasted in his relationship with Dora.This is a well-crafted film with good plot, story, cinematography and music.  It's enjoyable if you like this type of film. This would be a fine film to add to any Wyatt Earp collection if you are a fan.Please keep in mind the ""true story"" element is stretched and rewritten.  Now for some criticisms and historical facts:The DVD cover says, ""Based on the true story of a lawman gone renegade"".  As history accounts record this incident, they did not give up their badges.Spike Kenedy was in love with Dora Hand. Spike was granted acquittal for the murder, but he never fully recovered from his wounds and died December 29, 1884 at the age of 29.  It is reported that Spike's father paid over $25,000 for this acquittal.There is no historical evidence that Wyatt Earp and Dora Hand had a relationship.  Dora was a beautiful woman and had many men who appreciated her.",3,Wyatt Earp's Revenge,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,2490,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'murder', 'Dora', 'Hand', 'Fannie', 'Keenan', 'James', 'Spike', 'Kenedy', 'Spike', 'was', 'son', 'wealthy', 'Texas', 'rancher', 'Captain', 'Mifflin', 'Kenedy', 'who', 'Richard', 'King', 'had', 'founded', 'King', 'Ranch', 'one', 'largest', 'sources', 'income', 'Dodge', 'City', 'rest', 'territory.The', 'story', 'told', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'who', 'special', 'interest', 'hearing', 'story', 'perspective', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', '1907', 'special', 'interest', 'revealed', 'end.Finding', 'opposition', 'Judge', 'Hinkle', 'issue', 'arrest', 'warrants', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Bat', 'Masterson', 'Charlie', 'Bassett', 'turn', 'badges', 'go', 'Kenedy', 'Brothers', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'Bill', 'Tilghman', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'posses', 'Old', 'West.Spike', 'Kenedy', 'left', 'trail', 'bodies', 'path', 'headed', 'home', 'were', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'presented', 'man', 'was', 'ruthless', 'took', 'what', 'wanted', 'Murder', 'was', 'game', 'him.Along', 'way', 'meet', 'Doctor', 'John', 'Henry', 'Holiday', 'Wilson', 'Bethel', 'Hart', 'Dixie', 'infamous', 'dentist', 'lunger', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'best', 'friend', 'certain', 'finesse', 'character', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'seemed', 'gleefully', 'happy', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'stoic', 'men.Val', 'Kilmer', 'laconic', 'aging', 'legend', '1907', 'who', 'low-key', 'powerful', 'performance', 'story', '1878', 'sadness', 'Wyatt', 'given', 'proper', 'attention.Diana', 'DeGarmo', 'American', 'Idol', 'fame', 'Dora', 'Hand', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'Wyatt', 'Wyatt', 'duty', 'desire', 'normal', 'life', 'are', 'contrasted', 'relationship', 'Dora.This', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'good', 'plot', 'story', 'cinematography', 'music', 'enjoyable', 'like', 'type', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'film', 'add', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'collection', 'are', 'fan.Please', 'keep', 'mind', 'true', 'story', 'element', 'stretched', 'rewritten', 'Now', 'criticisms', 'historical', 'facts', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'lawman', 'gone', 'renegade', 'history', 'accounts', 'record', 'incident', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'badges.Spike', 'Kenedy', 'was', 'love', 'Dora', 'Hand', 'Spike', 'was', 'granted', 'acquittal', 'murder', 'never', 'fully', 'recovered', 'wounds', 'died', 'December', '29', '1884', 'age', '29', 'reported', 'Spike', 'father', 'paid', '25,000', 'historical', 'evidence', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Dora', 'Hand', 'had', 'relationship', 'Dora', 'was', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'had', 'many', 'men', 'who', 'appreciated']",Wyatt Earp's Revenge
