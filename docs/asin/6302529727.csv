But let me qualify for you which vampire movies I really liked. Dracula, with Bela Lugosi; Interview with the vampire, my favorite; Queen of the Damned; Underworld, Kindred, Vampire Journals, Forever Knight... I lament the fact that there are so few good vampire movies. I wish someone would do more movies based on Anne Rice's novels. The church, in this movie, where the girls went swimming in the basement crypt, is in fact a really cool church; I could live there. But swimming in a flooded crypt? Come on man. The vampires looked more like saber-toothed tigers than vampires. Most of them were plain slobs. Whoever heard of vampires meeting in a hunting lodge to play bingo and stuff? Oh, and the grandma vampire...please. That was seriously corny. So was the vampire who coughed up their lungs turning them inside out, outside their body to breathe while they slept. I saw this movie on fearnet and fast forwarded a lot of it. It's a real B movie. I'm really glad I didn't buy it.

I thought that was pretty strange..anyways Lucy's cross necklace falls to the bottom of the crypt and land on a vampire. Which makes him come to life, he attacks Cindy and Lucy flees. Cindy becomes a vampire and gets locked away with her mother who also turned to one. Before you know it the whole town is vampires to begin with. Even Lucy's mom becomes a vampire but luckily Lucy's teacher helps to fight them off and the local drunk.This more of a comedy action rather than horror.

It has bad acting (not saying Evil Dead does), especially little Billy the Familiar, but Children of the Night is probably the funniest vampire movie I have ever seen! What sets this movie apart from the other vampire flicks are the vampires that either cacoon themselves of cough up a lung before bed time.

318873,A26X2KY2VW9ULV,6302529727,"gespect ""gespect""","[0, 1]","i've watched a lot of horror films.  vampire films are usually boring and predictable.  i consider the three best vampire films to be: 'dracula'  1932- i think- [with bela], the original 'nosferatu', and 'abbot and costello meet dracula' [or maybe it was frankenstein] but once again bela was in it.  '30 days of night' was not bad.'children of the night' is the best vampire movie that i've ever seen through the first 75% to 80% of the film.  then it drops to all of the usual predictability.  maybe the original writer died before he could finsh the script.  there is a- swimming though a crypt scene [like a baptism to wash off the 'filth' of the town before you leave for college] which is absolutely great.  the suspense to see what is being kept in a bedroom on the second floor of the preist's house is really cool.  then the- karen black and her daughter- is totally spectacular.  the punk that is the vampire's familiar is a little unexpected but very nice.it's an infestation of a town due to nature releasing the trapped vampire.  [much like the book 'salem's lot]  and the infestation follows with it's cancer like spreading.  but the last 20% to 25% is just the 'same old...'  predictablity.in my opinion: when it comes to vampire movies: 'children of the night' gets five stars for the first 75% to 80% and three stars for 20% to 25%.  and that's about 4 and 3/4 stars.  rounding off that's 5 stars.  most of it is so good.",5,5 stars may be decieving,1249344000,"08 4, 2009",2009,1438,"['i', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lot', 'horror', 'films', 'vampire', 'films', 'are', 'usually', 'boring', 'predictable', 'i', 'consider', 'three', 'best', 'vampire', 'films', 'be', '1932-', 'i', 'think-', '[', 'bela', ']', 'original', ""'nosferatu"", 'costello', 'meet', 'dracula', '[', 'maybe', 'was', 'frankenstein', ']', 'once', 'again', 'bela', 'was', 'days', 'night', 'was', 'not', 'bad', ""'children"", 'night', 'best', 'vampire', 'movie', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'first', '75', '%', '80', '%', 'film', 'then', 'usual', 'predictability', 'maybe', 'original', 'writer', 'died', 'could', 'finsh', 'script', 'a-', 'swimming', 'crypt', 'scene', '[', 'baptism', 'wash', 'off', ""'filth"", 'town', 'leave', 'college', ']', 'absolutely', 'great', 'suspense', 'see', 'what', 'being', 'kept', 'bedroom', 'second', 'floor', 'preist', 'house', 'really', 'cool', 'then', 'the-', 'karen', 'black', 'daughter-', 'totally', 'spectacular', 'punk', 'vampire', 'familiar', 'little', 'unexpected', 'very', 'nice.it', 'infestation', 'town', 'due', 'nature', 'releasing', 'trapped', 'vampire', '[', 'much', 'book', ""'salem"", 'lot', ']', 'infestation', 'cancer', 'spreading', 'last', '20', '%', '25', '%', 'just', ""'same"", 'old', 'predictablity.in', 'opinion', 'when', 'vampire', 'movies', ""'children"", 'night', 'five', 'stars', 'first', '75', '%', '80', '%', 'three', 'stars', '20', '%', '25', '%', '4', '3/4', 'stars', 'rounding', 'off', '5', 'stars', 'most', 'so', 'good']",N/A

Well I suppose you can hate it but I actually thought it wasn't that bad and had one very genuinely creepy scene.Set in a small town called Allburg, two girls Lucy (Dolenz) and Cindy (Maya McLaughlin) visit an old abandoned church.  A creepy looking old gothic cathedral.  The legend goes that you can actuall swim in an old crypt beneath the church so the girls give it a try.  Well, Cindy loses her crucifix as it floats to the bottom of the crypt and awakens a vampire from his sleep and he immediately kills her while Lucy escapes.Meanwhile a former priest (DeLuise) has heard the legends of the vampires and comes to Allburg to invesigate and runs into Lucy as she is escaping from the vampire.  The pair along with the town drunk, (Garret Morris) have to find a way from stopping the vampire from spreading is bite as already dozens of townspeople have been turned into vampires themselves.  One of those, played by Karen Black, is imprisoned in the house of another priest who she constantly torments with her taunts and screams.The acting is nothig to write home about.  Black and Morris are both way over the top, but in kind of a fun and b-movie way.  The scene in the old gothic church was quite creepy although why ANYONE would ever want to go swim in a mold invested crypt is beyone me.
