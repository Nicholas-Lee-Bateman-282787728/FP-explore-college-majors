1045340,ALJWRGOANWDWJ,B000MEYKA0,,"[8, 8]","Having watched (almost) every episode of this classic television series as it played out every weeknight in the mid-70's, I was thrilled to see this wonderful show resurrected on DVD.  I was a bit concerned that its underplayed, bitingly satirical writing and acting would be diminished in the 30+ years since, however I was delighted to see that the show still resonates today.Louise Lasser, a true American comedic treasure, was absolutely amazing as the ultimate housewife-on-the-edge.  Her  deadpan line deliveries and pre-nervous-breakdown demeanor still make me laugh out loud!Throw in the country singer wannabe Loretta Haggers, played to pitch-perfection by Mary Kay Place, and the looney tunes (but still very lovable) Dody Goodman as Mary's mother Martha, and you have three of the funniest and most surprisingly sympathetic female characters in the medium's history.The men in this soap opera parody are definitely relegated to the second tier, commanding much less screen time (and much less empathy) than the female characters, as it should be, considering this show was one of the vanguards of the women's movement.SO--by all means join Mary, Loretta, Martha, sad-sack cheating husband Tom, Loretta's ""Baby Boy"" Charlie, Mary's hemorrhoid-challenged father George, soda-slurping ADD-addled daughter Heather, sexually liberated little sister Kathy, grandpa (the Fernwwod Flasher), little Davy the mass murderer, flirtatious and ever-helpful Sergeant Foley, and the rest of the strange, lovable and addictively watchable denizens of Fernwood, OH---if for no other reason than to see how satisfying (and devastatingly funny) TV could be when producers and writers created shows which did not underestimate the intelligence of their audiences.Oh, and by the way, let's hope that the distributors of this series do not drag the DVD release process out interminably.  The first 25 episodes included here don't even scratch the surface of the initial season, and I want MORE, NOW !!!",5,Extraordinarily Entertaining!,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,1990,"['Having', 'watched', 'almost', 'episode', 'classic', 'television', 'series', 'played', 'out', 'weeknight', 'mid-70', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'wonderful', 'show', 'resurrected', 'DVD', 'was', 'bit', 'concerned', 'underplayed', 'bitingly', 'satirical', 'writing', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'diminished', '30+', 'years', 'however', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'show', 'still', 'today.Louise', 'Lasser', 'true', 'American', 'comedic', 'treasure', 'was', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'ultimate', 'housewife-on-the-edge', 'deadpan', 'line', 'deliveries', 'pre-nervous-breakdown', 'demeanor', 'still', 'make', 'out', 'loud', 'Throw', 'country', 'singer', 'wannabe', 'Loretta', 'Haggers', 'played', 'pitch-perfection', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'looney', 'tunes', 'still', 'very', 'lovable', 'Dody', 'Goodman', 'Mary', 'mother', 'Martha', 'have', 'three', 'funniest', 'most', 'surprisingly', 'sympathetic', 'female', 'characters', 'medium', 'history.The', 'men', 'soap', 'opera', 'parody', 'are', 'definitely', 'relegated', 'second', 'tier', 'commanding', 'much', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'much', 'less', 'empathy', 'female', 'characters', 'should', 'be', 'considering', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'vanguards', 'women', 'movement.SO', 'means', 'join', 'Mary', 'Loretta', 'Martha', 'sad-sack', 'cheating', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Loretta', 'Baby', 'Boy', 'Charlie', 'Mary', 'hemorrhoid-challenged', 'father', 'George', 'soda-slurping', 'ADD-addled', 'daughter', 'Heather', 'sexually', 'liberated', 'little', 'sister', 'Kathy', 'grandpa', 'Fernwwod', 'Flasher', 'little', 'Davy', 'mass', 'murderer', 'flirtatious', 'ever-helpful', 'Sergeant', 'Foley', 'rest', 'strange', 'lovable', 'addictively', 'watchable', 'denizens', 'Fernwood', 'OH', '-if', 'other', 'reason', 'see', 'how', 'satisfying', 'devastatingly', 'funny', 'TV', 'could', 'be', 'when', 'producers', 'writers', 'created', 'shows', 'did', 'not', 'underestimate', 'intelligence', 'audiences.Oh', 'way', 'let', 'hope', 'distributors', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'drag', 'DVD', 'release', 'process', 'interminably', 'first', '25', 'episodes', 'included', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'scratch', 'surface', 'initial', 'season', 'want', 'MORE', 'NOW']",N/A

There will never be another show like it. Current TV should be so bold and daring! The storylines were creative and the characters were colorful. Modern televison shows wish that they could be so memorable. It was totally escapist fun for hip people that understood the humor. (Personally, the show was influential on my sense of humor and my creative endeavors.) No subject was taboo, which made the show interesting and quite visionary. And bonus points for the writers for introducing TV's first gay male couple who were not portrayed as effeminate stereotypes but rather masculine strong guys.

1045349,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000MEYKA0,Byron Kolln,"[4, 4]","Fernwood, Ohio is the setting for one of television's most outrageous and bold comedy classics.  MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN was developed by Norman Lear in 1976 as a satire on soap opera, but with a twist.  Unlike it's successor ""Soap"" (which debuted the following year), there was no laugh track or live studio audience to indicate where the humour fell.  Episodes originally aired five nights a week; the turn-around period was unusually fast, and the cast and crew had to keep up with a punishing schedule.The show revolves around the eponymous Mary Hartman (Louise Lasser), an ordinary housewife whose day-to-day life is a never-ending rollercoaster of trials and tribulations.  From impotent husband Tom (Greg Mullavey) to senile Grandpa Larkin (Victor Kilian) and next-door-neighbour, wannabe country singer Loretta Haggers (Mary Kay Place), MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN turns the bizarre world of the TV soap-opera on it's head.In the first episode alone, the Lombardi family (plus two goats and eight chickens) is mowed down in a hideous mass-murder, Grandpa Larkin is unveiled as the notorious ""Fernwood Flasher"", and Mary's kitchen floor, to her frustration, exhibits an unsightly waxy yellow buildup!  Louise Lasser, with her bemused, hang-dog face and infantile braids, is still unmatched in her ability to give a great deal of realistic drama to the role of Mary; and by playing her completely straight she in turn generates more underlying humour within the scripts.This 3-DVD set includes the first twenty-five episodes from the show's run.  At this stage in the game it seems that Sony isn't too fussed one way or the other about releasing more volumes.  That's a real shame because the show's writing only gets better from here on.  Perhaps a company like Shout! Factory might step into the breach; goodness knows they've done it with other shows left hanging by Sony.",4,subversive soap-opera satire supreme!,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,1883,"['Fernwood', 'Ohio', 'setting', 'one', 'television', 'most', 'outrageous', 'bold', 'comedy', 'classics', 'MARY', 'HARTMAN', 'MARY', 'HARTMAN', 'was', 'developed', 'Norman', 'Lear', '1976', 'satire', 'soap', 'opera', 'twist', 'successor', 'Soap', 'debuted', 'following', 'year', 'was', 'laugh', 'track', 'live', 'studio', 'audience', 'indicate', 'where', 'humour', 'fell', 'Episodes', 'originally', 'aired', 'five', 'nights', 'week', 'turn-around', 'period', 'was', 'unusually', 'fast', 'cast', 'crew', 'had', 'keep', 'up', 'punishing', 'schedule.The', 'show', 'eponymous', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'Louise', 'Lasser', 'ordinary', 'housewife', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'never-ending', 'rollercoaster', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'impotent', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Greg', 'Mullavey', 'senile', 'Grandpa', 'Larkin', 'Victor', 'Kilian', 'next-door-neighbour', 'wannabe', 'country', 'singer', 'Loretta', 'Haggers', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'MARY', 'HARTMAN', 'MARY', 'HARTMAN', 'bizarre', 'world', 'TV', 'soap-opera', 'first', 'episode', 'alone', 'Lombardi', 'family', 'two', 'goats', 'eight', 'chickens', 'mowed', 'down', 'hideous', 'mass-murder', 'Grandpa', 'Larkin', 'unveiled', 'notorious', 'Fernwood', 'Flasher', 'Mary', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'frustration', 'unsightly', 'waxy', 'yellow', 'buildup', 'Louise', 'Lasser', 'bemused', 'hang-dog', 'face', 'infantile', 'braids', 'still', 'unmatched', 'ability', 'give', 'great', 'deal', 'realistic', 'drama', 'role', 'Mary', 'playing', 'completely', 'straight', 'turn', 'generates', 'more', 'underlying', 'humour', 'scripts.This', '3-DVD', 'set', 'first', 'twenty-five', 'episodes', 'show', 'run', 'stage', 'game', 'Sony', ""n't"", 'too', 'fussed', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'releasing', 'more', 'volumes', 'real', 'shame', 'show', 'writing', 'only', 'better', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'company', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'might', 'step', 'breach', 'goodness', ""'ve"", 'done', 'other', 'shows', 'left', 'hanging', 'Sony']",N/A
1045350,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000MEYKA0,calvinnme,"[95, 98]","When this show first premiered in January 1976 it gave Saturday Night Live a run for its money in being one of the most daring and inventive shows that had been aired. Louise Lasser's deadpan delivery as the often put-upon, under-appreciated Mary was delightful, and the show had a very talented supporting cast. Besides doing a great job of satirizing the problems of life in the 70's, it was a deft parody of soap operas in general, such as when Martin Mull returned as Barth Gimble, the twin brother of Garth Gimble, who had just died. Dabney Coleman was also great as the mayor, a true cynic who was much more interested in staying mayor than actually accomplishing anything. This show also gave birth to that great satire of the talk shows, Fernwood Tonight. Life probably wasn't too far from art in this case, since the first season ended with Mary in a mental institution, and I think putting out a new episode every night, just like an actual soap opera, took its toll on the whole cast, and Louise Lasser in particular. If you happen to remember the episode of Saturday Night Live that Louise Lasser hosted during that time, you know what I mean - the stress really showed. People looked forward to each new episode - just like a real soap opera - and there were 130 episodes in the first season alone. Thus, although I am grateful that we have the first 25 episodes, that doesn't even get us through the first one-fifth of the first season, so I hope more releases of this show are pending.",5,Great comic satire of soap operas,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1500,"['When', 'show', 'first', 'premiered', 'January', '1976', 'gave', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'run', 'money', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'daring', 'inventive', 'shows', 'had', 'been', 'aired', 'Louise', 'Lasser', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'often', 'put-upon', 'under-appreciated', 'Mary', 'was', 'delightful', 'show', 'had', 'very', 'talented', 'supporting', 'cast', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'satirizing', 'problems', 'life', '70', 'was', 'deft', 'parody', 'soap', 'operas', 'general', 'such', 'when', 'Martin', 'Mull', 'returned', 'Barth', 'Gimble', 'twin', 'brother', 'Garth', 'Gimble', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'died', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'mayor', 'true', 'cynic', 'who', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'staying', 'mayor', 'actually', 'accomplishing', 'anything', 'show', 'also', 'gave', 'birth', 'great', 'satire', 'talk', 'Fernwood', 'Tonight', 'Life', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'art', 'case', 'first', 'season', 'ended', 'Mary', 'mental', 'institution', 'think', 'putting', 'out', 'new', 'episode', 'night', 'just', 'actual', 'soap', 'opera', 'took', 'toll', 'whole', 'cast', 'Louise', 'Lasser', 'particular', 'happen', 'remember', 'episode', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Louise', 'Lasser', 'hosted', 'time', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'stress', 'really', 'showed', 'People', 'looked', 'forward', 'new', 'episode', 'just', 'real', 'soap', 'opera', 'were', '130', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'alone', 'Thus', 'am', 'grateful', 'have', 'first', '25', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'first', 'one-fifth', 'first', 'season', 'hope', 'more', 'releases', 'show', 'are', 'pending']",N/A

I bought the two Best of MHMH videos years ago, which were out of print at that point, so I paid about 125 bucks for the set.  The box had some marker scribbling on the front, but fortunately the tapes played brilliantly, & the quality was decent, for previewed videos.The show was on originally at 7pm, on a local affiliate here, & again at 11pm on WNYW(?), channel 5, out of New York.  The show's settings are very 1970s, which add to the timeless charm of this show, which aired from 1976-78.  It wouldn't appeal to some, but there are many of us into cult television who can appreciate Norman Lear's creation in this series.  Too bad it didn't last awhile longer.  I think without Louise Lasser, the transition to Forever Fernwood was missing the magic of which this show was about.Philip Bruns was underated & a very enjoyable supporting character as George Shumway, & Grandpa Larkin was a card that would crack me up whenever he was in a scene!  Sergeant Foley was incredibly sexy & had the most amazing smile!Obviously, it's all about marketing sales, so every fan needs to buy a copy to show SONY we mean business about wanting this show & its subsequent seasons on DVD.  It would be great to watch every episode, starting with the first, & following the storylines & watching them unfold, such as The Fernwood Flasher, & Lombardi plots, & savor them & relive some of the greatest moments in tv history.It'll be great to have this on DVD!

The show is actually even better than my fond memories of it, from childhood.The lapse of 30+ years and viewing it from the perspective of an adult made me appreciate the innovativeness of this show even more. Truly was a once-in-a-lifetime role for the terrific Louise Lasser, who had delivery and timing that should be studied by anyone interested in the art of comedic acting. She was Emmy-nominated for this role, and in hindsight I don't think any other television actress of the 1970's had her range and near-genius that shines through in this DVD collection. Her acting chops- always evident and bubbling under, explode in Episode 24 of this DVD and left me in awe.What a tour de force this was for Lasser, which proved to be untoppable. I would have loved for her to have had another high-profile success to showcase her layers and layers of nuance, pathos, and hilarity, but at least she (and we) will always have ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.""The large ensemble of actors all are very enjoyable, from Emmy-winning supporting actress Mary Kay Place to Bruce Solomon, Philip Bruns, and every performer involved, really. I couldn't take my eyes off any of them and the excellent writing had me even watch some of the episodes with the closed-captioning on, it's that good.Surprise (for me) guest-stars in small roles include early performances from Sudie Bond (later of 'Come Back To The Five and Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean' and 'Silkwood') Ed Begley Jr., Carol Ita White, Michael Lembeck and Scott Colomby.I don't mind that there aren't any extras included, because while it'd be enjoyable to have some, these 25 episodes really speak for themselves. I see no evidence at all that these shows have been trunctuated, and the quality of picture resolution and sound are fantastic.I hope for a very speedy release of Volume 2, right away!! I really can't wait and would love to have the next volume released this summer and future volumes appear before the end of this year.I encourage everyone to purchase this, it is so remarkable a trip back to the 1970s, and I think it should (and will) provide Sony with a very large volume of sales.If available, I'd purchase every volume immediately and have never before felt such an urgency about other TV show box sets in my DVD collection. So I hope Sony keeps the momentum going and knows that there is a hungry market for this series.My favorite DVD purchase in at least a year!",5,Even better than I remembered!

For those of you who are unfamiliar with Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, it was originally broadcast from 1976-1978 and ran for 325 episodes.  The show was the brain-child of Norman Lear and was a late-night spoof of soap-operas.  It paved the way for other shows such as Soap, That 70's Show and Desperate Housewives.  But Mary Hartman was ground breaking for its time.  It dealt with an assortment of taboo subjects and was therefore turned down by every major network.  So Norman Lear sold the show into syndication accross the nation.  Most of the time slots were late-night, but there were a few during the day.  The show became an instant phenomenon which competed with most of the late-night news shows.  In fact, Mary Hartman is the one show that truly defines the look and feel of the 1970's.  The star of the show was the comic genius, Louise Lasser.  Her comic style is unique only to herself.  Many may remember her from one of the most famous and talked about episodes of Saturday Night Live (which can be seen on the Season 1 set), her guest appearances on Taxi (she played Alex's ex-wife) and from several of Woody Allen's early films, including Bananas and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask.  What she brings to Mary Hartman is pure genius.  It might take a few episodes to understand her humor, but once you do, you'll never regret it.  The show also launched the careers of several other major stars including Dabney Coleman and Mary Kay Place and revitalized the careers of others, most notably Dody Goodman (from the Jack Paar Show).  Countless guest stars appeared on the show - Dr. Joyce Brothers, Dinah Shore, Gore Vidal and David Suskind among others.  But the premise of the show is that it's a soap-opera spoof and a legitimate soap opera at the same time.  It's complete with passion, scandal and corny organ music.  And it also contains some of the most famous scenes from 1970's television.  Watch a man drown in chicken soup, see Mary Kay Place become a country-western singing star, beware of station wagons full of nuns and you can't miss the star of the show have a nervous breakdown on national television.  This show is for the ages.",5,THANK YOU SONY!!!!!,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,2323,"['just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'SONY', 'actually', 'releasing', 'monumental', 'show', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'thank', 'enough', 'SONY', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', '1976-1978', 'ran', '325', 'episodes', 'show', 'was', 'brain-child', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'was', 'late-night', 'spoof', 'soap-operas', 'paved', 'way', 'other', 'shows', 'such', 'Soap', '70', 'Show', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'was', 'ground', 'breaking', 'time', 'dealt', 'assortment', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'was', 'therefore', 'turned', 'down', 'major', 'network', 'So', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'sold', 'show', 'syndication', 'nation', 'Most', 'time', 'slots', 'were', 'late-night', 'were', 'few', 'day', 'show', 'became', 'instant', 'phenomenon', 'competed', 'most', 'late-night', 'news', 'shows', 'fact', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'one', 'show', 'truly', 'look', 'feel', '1970', 'star', 'show', 'was', 'comic', 'genius', 'Louise', 'Lasser', 'comic', 'style', 'unique', 'only', 'Many', 'may', 'remember', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'talked', 'episodes', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Taxi', 'played', 'Alex', 'ex-wife', 'several', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'early', 'films', 'including', 'Bananas', 'Everything', 'Always', 'Wanted', 'Know', 'Sex', 'Were', 'Afraid', 'Ask', 'What', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'pure', 'genius', 'might', 'take', 'few', 'episodes', 'understand', 'humor', 'once', 'do', ""'ll"", 'never', 'regret', 'show', 'also', 'launched', 'careers', 'several', 'other', 'major', 'stars', 'including', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'revitalized', 'careers', 'others', 'most', 'notably', 'Dody', 'Goodman', 'Jack', 'Paar', 'Show', 'Countless', 'guest', 'stars', 'appeared', 'show', 'Dr.', 'Joyce', 'Brothers', 'Dinah', 'Shore', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'David', 'Suskind', 'others', 'premise', 'show', 'soap-opera', 'spoof', 'legitimate', 'soap', 'opera', 'same', 'time', 'complete', 'passion', 'scandal', 'corny', 'organ', 'music', 'also', 'most', 'famous', 'scenes', '1970', 'television', 'Watch', 'man', 'drown', 'chicken', 'soup', 'see', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'become', 'country-western', 'singing', 'star', 'beware', 'station', 'wagons', 'full', 'nuns', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'star', 'show', 'have', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'national', 'television', 'show', 'ages']",N/A

There's no laugh track, and no time killing...  Jam packed with great script delivered by a crack ensemble.  In fact, the writing is SO brilliant you get broadsided by the humor sometimes and find yourself gigling without even realizing why... then if you go back a half a minute and watch it again you're like... ""oh my god ! ! !"" (am I the only person who reacts like this?) The strange, soap opera spoof, non-sequitor double entendre lines, TV commercial derived dialogue and strange scenerios all delivered in the dry quirky uniquely MH2 style makes this a must have/must see/must repeatedly see view... and Mary Hartman's unforgetable young, unhappy, valium dazed housewife is so great...  (and actually reminds me of my mother's friends and neighbors... back then going to shrinks and getting your tranqs to deal with the stresses of middle class American life was really in!)Anyway, as you watch you marvel at the ensemble, but can see them doing their best to hold back from cracking up over their own lines and delivery...  the show also strikes an edgy nerve...  almost like Vonnegut on Valium.  - - Though Louise Lasser may best be remember as one of Woody Allen's ex's, you can actually feel the Allenesque ""zeitgeist"" quirk via her brilliant acting.

I do love ""Mary Hartman"" though.  I remember catching episodes when  was a kid, which seems odd; most markets ran the show late at night as it was so controversial but my bedtime was at 8 but I distinctly remember it being on night after night.  How could anybody forget Dody Goodman calling, ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman!"" during the opening?I've been a fan of soaps for years, and if you want a good homage, MH2 is the best.  For starters, its ""five night a week, no reruns, no laugh-track formula"" is borrowed right from the daytime soaps and gives it more authenticity.  The lighting, the acting and those tight closeups make you feel like you're watching a serious drama, until Mary comes out with one of her bizarre observations or the plot takes a unique turn.  In fact, I'd heard so much about the hilarity of this show that the first few episodes were slightly tough going for me because it was all played so straight - just like a real soap.  Once I got over that, I fell right into the story and surprise, it's pretty involving on its own merits.Louise Lasser is perfectly cast as befuddled Midwestern housewife Mary, even if her New York accent comes through.  Her blank stares, lack of comprehension and worries over everyday things perfectly encapsulate the neuroses of the 1970s.  Mary Kay Place (who won an Emmy for her role) is also excellent as big-haired, kind-hearted Loretta Haggers, a country singer with a dream.  Dody Goodman is less successful as Mary's mother as she seems nervous and is always stumbling over her lines, but I can forgive that as it does somehow work to the advantage of her character who is always, always doing the housework.The blue-collar setting and the characters remind me somewhat of ""Roseanne,"" which came along over a decade later.  I suspect Roseanne herself saw that as she cast Martin Mull and Fred Willard on her show, and Mull and Willard were, of course, hosts of the MH2 spinoffs, ""Fernwood 2Night"" and ""America 2Night.""MH2 became a phenomenon for a time, and then flamed out but I hope we get all the episodes on DVD so that it won't flame out a second time.

While listing the ""stars"" of this show, it fails to mention Louise Lasser (who Made the character of Mary Hartman), Dody Goodman (Mary's ""long-suffering"" mother), and Mary Kay Place (lovable neighbor Loretta Haggers). Sheesh! What's up with that? Hopefully Amazon will correct this major oversight soon. Certainly this isn't the first time that Amazon has listed television shows without the main star included - looks like the help need to pay a visit to Google.Mary Hartman, for many, was a great guilty pleasure. People who scoffed at soap operas in the 1970s sat down and watched each night while Mary, early on, dealt with such issues as the waxy yellow buildup on her kitchen floor or her grandfather being arrested for exposing himself. Neighbor Loretta's funniest moments included her day stint appearance on The Dinah Shore Show cooking her sweet potato pie and making a crack that almost ended her career (Loretta's, not Mary's) , which included Dinah playing herself. Then there was the rivalry between Mary and her sister Cathy for the attentions of the police officer Dennis Foley. The show was also played ""straight"" and not for laughs, which added to the campiness and watchability of the show. Season One (probably the most famous season) ended with Mary melting down on the David Susskind Show. Season One also helped to spawn, briefly, the singing career of Mary Kay Place both as Loretta and under her own name.I sincerely hope that the powers-that-be can arrange for the 1976 hilarious spoof of Mary Hartman from The Carol Burnett Show to be put on as a future extra.

""The Jeffersons"" and ""One Day at a Time"" were being prepped.  Lear had the idea to poke fun at soap operas, which were outrageously unbelievable at that time. Since his track record was so great, you would have thought CBS would have jumped at the show, but they didn't. First of all, some very controversial subjects were going to be explored. Second, Lear wanted to air the program five times a week, like a REAL soap. Since CBS passed, Lear looked to syndicate the show, with it airing on local stations. The locals took a chance, and the show was an instant smash.The sophisticated humor of All in the Family is nowhere to be found. Instead, we have crazy, off the wall situations: like an 80 year old flasher, and a mass murder that kills goats and chickens.Since the show aired 5 nights a week, it racked up 325 shows in 3.5 years. But it wasn't popular in syndication, because you had to watch it every night to keep track of the storyline, episodes did not stand on their own.  TV Land did not like this fact, and Mary Hartman is seldom seen.The DVD gives you 25 shows, which is about one quarter of a season. But it's enough to give you a taste of this weird stew. ""Mary Hartman"" is definitely an aquired taste, you have to watch a few episodes before it grows on you. But if you're patient, you'll get sucked into the strange world of Fernwood.

I hadn't seen this show since it first aired in the mid 70s, so I was expecting it to be a bit dated and of it's time. With the first joke about Mary obsessing over the waxy yellow build-up on her kitchen floor, I realized that nothing has changed except that we've become even MORE obsessed and insecure 30 years later! Mary would have just replaced her floor wax insecurity with an obsession about botox injections. Loretta would be dreaming about appearing as a lame contestant on American Idol. Grandpa would be on Larry King defending himself against the ""unjust"" charges of flashing he'd been ""exposed"" to, while the rest of the people on the show would be waiting for their spots on Dr. Phil or Jerry Springer.

For instance, credits on first episode of third disc lists characters/actors who didn't even appear on that show and several shows feature highlights of ""next episodes"" that don't show up till several shows later. (I'm beginning to feel a bit like Mary's befuddled mom!) I remember all the publicity about the breakneck speed under which these shows were shot (exhausted actors, burned-out writers, etc.) but on second viewing am wondering how much of this inconsistency was accidental and how much was an intentional parody of shoddy production values of traditional soap operas.Either way, it works but as series progresses, I'm leaning toward the former notion. By third disc, forgotten lines, microphone shadows, etc. are less the exception than the rule.

While it is most like a soap opera in apperance, the show harks back even farther to the old silent movie serials of damsels in distress such a The Perils of Pauline.  In fact, Louise Lasser wears braids and a cute pinafore just like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.  Lillian Gish would be proud and the camera work (the closing of the aperature on the camera) and organ music are there too.  As a lover of silent films, I find it enchanting and quite daring for a TV to have ever tried that format for their show.I was in high school when Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman came on and I had to secretly watch the show (on at 11:30 pm) on my black and white TV with a little earphone I could plug into it.  I even learned to tape some episodes (no VCRs for me) by taping the sound off radio with a tape recorder.  I loved this show.The charm has not worn off.  As an adult, I get more of the jokes and find it even funnier.  Even through the jokes and crazy situations, the humanity and the pathos shine through.

I finished this DVD in about a week and a half--and LOVED every minute of it.  Yes, unfortunately, there are a couple of episodes that are screwed up--apparently, they used some summer compilation episodes instead of the regular season ones so a few scenes are missing.

I haven't seen these shows since they were first aired in syndication 30 years ago, and they are just as fresh today as they were before the arrival of Disco. The images are crisp and sharp.  Well done Sony!This 3-disk set contained the first 25 episodes. It's my understanding the two seasons of MH2 featured 307 episodes (some web sites state 325 episodes), but using the 307 episode number, there are 282 episodes yet to appear on DVD. If Sony produced the entire Mary Hartman Mary Hartman series, it could be easily made in a 10-12 volume set. At $20 to $25 a set, I find that a $250-$300 investment over a few years time span on one of the best television shows of all time would be a rare bargain.If Sony decided to make future volumes a four disk set with 30 episodes (which could easily be done), we could have the entire series sooner, and they could charge an additional $5, I'm sure fans would willingly pay.If Sony does decide to make the smart move and release the entire series, I only hope we get full episodes and not edited ones. I realize finding pristine copies of a 30 year old show may be difficult, but for the enjoyment of the fans and for archival reasons, full episodes would work better.One last comment, if the company (Sony) has the rights to the series and doesn't wish to release more MH2 box sets, please give another company the rights to release the remaining episodes. They're too good to leave in some warehouse gathering dust.

1045388,A65VX6CFK2TEH,B000MEYKA0,"R. Royall ""MH fan""","[30, 32]","TVDVDJunkie is correct--Episodes #22 and #24 are not the originals.  I have compared the DVD episodes to my videotapes, both from the 1980 CBS late night run and the 2002 TVLand run, and there are two 3 minute sequences missing involving the Haggars' run-in with the hillbillies.  There were three sequences in total:  (1) the initial hillbilly encounter at gunpoint at the end of Episode 22 which has been deleted, (2) the primary scene where the hillbillies suggest a song to Loretta in Episode 23, which survives intact, and (3) the lead-out scene in Episode 24 where Charlie and Loretta are alone in the car discussing what almost happened with the hillbillies, just before their car accident with the nuns, which discussion scene has been deleted.  Both deleted sequences run about 3 minutes.  I checked every episode on the third disc... Episodes 19 through 25 and this is the extent of the damage....just six minutes.  Everything else survived.How could this have happened?  I think it was carelessness, rather than deliberate.  This is my theory.  Many of you are too young to remember that during the summer hiatus of 1976 (July 5, 1976 to October 1, 1976), the stations participating in the MH syndication aired ""The Best of"" Mary Hartman.  These were 65 compressed, edited versions of the original first 130 episodes that aired January 5, 1976 to July 2, 1976.  Rather than choosing the best 65 episodes, the producers actually reedited all of the episodes in order to maintain a story flow and allow new viewers of the reruns to understand the show.  About 50 percent of the scenes had to be deleted to fit 130 episodes of material into 65 rerun episodes, so they eliminated extraneous tangents to stories, as well as some ""B"" stories, to just highlight the central plots of the show.  That is why I believe the entire hillbilly sequence was deleted, because it was not critical to the Haggars story, which focused on the car accident that put Loretta in a wheelchair.  I believe original Episodes 22, 23, and 24 were compressed into two episodes for summer rerun purposes.  The editors in the summer of 1976 deleted all 3 hillbilly-related sequences from Episodes 22, 23, and 24, but kept the Haggars' car accident with the nuns.  They also deleted previews of upcoming episodes, as well as the segments from Episode 23 that featured Coach Fedders at home, and Grandpa Larkin appearing in court.  This permitted 3 original episodes to be compressed into 2 rerun episodes for the 1976 summer season.  Episode 23's scene with Tom coming home from lunch to be confronted by Mary as she was waxing the floor, was cut into the end of Episode 22 to replace the first hillbilly encounter scene.  Episode 23's scene with Mary visiting Dennis at the police station to retrieve her shoe was edited into the beginning of Episode 24, replacing the scene where Loretta and Charlie are in the car discussing what almost happened with the hillbillies.  The rest of Episode 23 was not used in the 1976 summer reruns.Here is what I think Sony accidentally did.  They successfully preserved the entire Episode 23 that has the Coach Fedders scene and the Grandpa Larkin scene that was unused in the 1976 summer reruns.  But they incorrectly used the marginally recut versions of Episodes 22 and 24 that were specially prepared for the 1976 summer reruns for this DVD collection!  This is why one scene from DVD Episode 23 is duplicated at the end of DVD Episode 22 and another scene from DVD Episode 23 is duplicated at the beginning of Episode 24.  Yes, this is very frustrating and careless but at least the total damage is no more than 6 minutes.  The original episodes run 22 minutes, so we need not worry that every episode has something removed from it.  They don't. Episodes 19, 20, 21, and 23 are EXACT duplicates of my videotaped episodes, with nothing missing.One more point for us purists.  I also don't believe Episode 25 is the original one either.  HOWEVER, the only thing that is missing is some 3 minutes of previews at the end of the episode.  Every other original scene is intact word for word.  For the DVD release, Sony deleted the 3 minutes of previews that were at the end of original Episode 25 and replaced it with the first scene in Episode 26, when Tom comes home to Mary after finding out that Mae may have given him VD.  Sony may have believed that scene provided a more logical cliffhanger to the end of Volume 1...or perhaps, this also is an altered Episode 25 prepared for the 1976 summer rerun season.I hope my research clears up what actually happened.  Sony would need to confirm my suspicions.  I honestly believe the damage is contained and I hope someone from Sony reads this and realizes their mistake so that it won't be repeated.  Otherwise, I agree with those reviewers who have praised the picture quality and urge fans to still buy Volume 1. Otherwise, we will have no hope of seeing the later Volumes that have become so rare.  I have only seen Episodes #106-325 once, and have no videotapes whatsover of those shows.  They deserve to be seen.  Sony just needs to be a little more careful about who they send ""down to the vault"" and tell them to retrieve the ORIGINAL masters of the show, not the recut masters used for the 1976 summer reruns.",5,"Incomplete Yes, But Damage is Contained",1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,5281,"['TVDVDJunkie', 'correct', 'Episodes', '22', '24', 'are', 'not', 'originals', 'have', 'compared', 'DVD',

Spears ""Artwomyn""","[5, 5]","Just when you thought Norman Lear couldn't produce a more cutting-edge sitcom than All In The Family, he goes and outdoes himself, by creating Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. Actually Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, was not truly a sitcom at all. It could be more accurately described as a prime-time soap-opera. More specifically, a spoof of the soap-opera genre. Like the film Airplane poked-fun at those airport disaster movies, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman was a satire of the classic soap-opera.This show set the template for other bizarre comedy series that followed in its wake, such as Married With Children, and Strangers With Candy. Like both of those shows, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman was funny precisely because of it's warped premise, not in spite of it. It was the first TV comedy of it's kind, and the most avant-guard comedy on TV in the 70s.Louise Lasser was brilliant as the flummoxed housewife, Mary Hartman. She played Mary with such a droll, dead-pan style, that she was utterly hilarious. Only Mary Kaye Place as Mary Hartman's neighbor, Loretta Haggers, was as drop-dead funny as Lasser. The other characters in this show, were only mildly amusing, by comparison.I don't believe that Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman is in syndication anymore. But it's on DVD now. I definitely recommend it.

1045393,A1YPVQWX27T93T,B000MEYKA0,Steve,"[18, 26]","Been waiting for this release for years - YEARS.  Signed several online petitions in the past two years begging the studios to release it to DVD. Watched the message boards and websites like crazy, hoping for news. Was tempted for years to buy bootlegs, but I didn't.Today, before the DVDs even arrive at my door, I find out that the episodes on this release are edited - specifically, the final few episodes which contain the subplot with the attack on the Haggers by some hillbillies.  But it's not just cutting, as normally happens when a show is rerun on television. The vignettes dealing with the attack have been edited to the point that in its DVD version, this subplot will make little sense. Given the total runtime, other episodes are suspect as well.So this is what this will likely mean for me, you, Sony, and future releases:1. Both of my DVD sets will eventually be returned.2. Doubtless, other fans will be either passing this release up or returning it, and the editing will seriously affect the sales of this volume (as it did with other series such as Roseanne, The Cosby Show, and Mama's Family).3. Sony will see the poor sales and surmise (wrongly) that the show did not sell because of low interest.4. Because of low sales, the show will be pulled from release - meaning, sorry fans! No chicken soup episode, no episodes dealing with Mary's VD and her hysterical trip to the library, etc.I also feel that I should mention that this is at least the third series I bought this year that contained botched episodes.I close with a message to the studios, especially Sony:When you don't consult series creators or fans when producing a set like this and then end up releasing a botched, incomplete product that no one wants to buy, don't start crying the blues when sales are lost, whether to bootleggers who are fans of the show or to people who rely on file-sharing programs and bypass the DVD releases.
