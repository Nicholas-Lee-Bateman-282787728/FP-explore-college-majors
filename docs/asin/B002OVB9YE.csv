I ended up loving it, for the plot and the storyline.The characters, at times, border on being comical; but not in the usual way. What I mean by that is, that life is ironic and the movie mirrors the ironic way that life comes at you. Sometimes all you can do is laugh about it. The movie is full of twists, with a twist ending.The characters, go through a series of events; that test thier mettle. How they react to the situations that affect them is what makes this movie special.The performances are all top notch. Ethan Hawke made me sit up and take notice with the honesty of his performance.Vincent D'Onofrio was excellent as always. Seymour Cassell was able to make you understand his character, though he didn't utter a word. Just awesome. I definitely recommend this movie. Give it a try.

1281976,A1TKM36EYEQNSM,B002OVB9YE,Joseph J. Slevin,"[0, 0]","Having grown up in Staten Island it was nice to see something with that title in a movie.  Funny that the character who took D'Onofrio's place on Criminal Intent was ragging on Staten Island in one of the first few episodes this season (Spring/Summer '10).The movie has a pretty cool introduction, you see some quick sites of Staten Island, then you see all the names on the Island that have the word 'kill' in it.  For those who live in PA and know the Skullykill river, well, that is the same thing.  Names like Kill van Kull, Great Kills, Arthur Kill...all names Staten Islanders are familiar with. I laughed out loud on that beginning.The movies is a little slow in the beginning, and you are beginning in the middle of the movie.  A scene that you return to a few times in the movie.  There is a bit of a flash forward and back, so, if you need to walk away for a second, pause the movie or you will be lost.Ethan Hawke (Sully) plays a septic tank truck worker working in the better parts of the Island where people have septic tanks.  Julianne Nicholson plays his wife who is pregnant and cannot stand how he smells when he get home.  Seymour Cassel plays a hearing impaired deli owner, Jasper, whose deli is frequented by Vincent D'Onofrio playing a mob boss Parmie Tarzo with work that only this guy seems to do for him (dissecting dead bodies).  Staten Island being one of a couple of places for body dumps in addition to the Meadowlands in NJ, makes this an interesting theme.Jasper and Sully are friendly to one another and Sully share with him how his wife is doing.  You see a tear of joy in his eye now and then when Sully is giving him the news.  Jasper is tired of his responsibility to Tarzo and Tarzo finds out that his gang is tired of him too.  Sully's co-worker decides to make some extra money by taking advantage of an old woman who lives alone.  It is Tarzo's mom.  So, you see Sully in the Deli when Tarzo walks in, he is tense and you come to learn why.There are some cool scenes with D'Onofrio in the woods.  There is a green area in the hills on the Island, but this was filmed in NJ.  This is a pretty cool scene and really takes on a life of its own.This is a great story and aptly played by all.  You have seen Nicholson on Criminal Intent, and Rosemary De Angelis (mom Tarzo) is familiar to you if you have watch CI or Law and Order.Anyone who likes ""Brooklyn's Finest"" would like this.Brooklyn's FinestCassel, Hawke and D'Onofrio work well together in this movie.

1281977,AKR6UK8O6DM6X,B002OVB9YE,"Lemas Mitchell ""Libertarian/ Empiricist""","[18, 25]","Short Attention Span Summary:This was an ""intersecting stories"" type of movie a la ""Pulp Fiction.""1. We see a mobster who is in the process of plotting to take over the business of his rivals. It is at this point that we learn that he can hold his breath for a long period of time under water. At the beginning of the movie, he is trying to beat some money out of someone that stole it from him (literally). He leaves because he has to go and see after his mother.2. The mobster's associates try to kill him after a visit with his mother (the reason for which he had to interrupt the beating that started the movie) and his car veers off into a river. He manages to survive this attempt because of his underwater breathing exercises before.3. There is a man and his wife. He is a septic tank cleaner and they want to have a child. He gets the bright idea to rob this old woman (who happens to be Mr. Mobster's mother) in order to get the funds to finance his wife's fertility treatment. Oops.  Mr. Septic Tank is worried that the child will not be intelligent (it is painfully clear that he himself is not intelligent) and so the cost of the insemination also includes some way to ensure the intelligence of the offspring.4. Later still, we are introduced to a deaf mute who works at the meat shop that takes care of the bodies that Mr. Mobster brings in from his activities. It seems that this person has a friendly relationship with the Septic Tank Cleaner. Later, Deaf Mute Guy wins a horse race for $47,000 (it seems that he lives a lonely life and his only outlet is betting at the race track from time to time). He knows about the bad things that Mr. Mobster does, and wants to kill him to make the world a better place.5. Eventually, Mr. Mobster finds out that Mr. Septic tank stole his money, and orders his men to get the money back. Mr. Septic borrows the money from Deaf Mute Guy, but Mr. Mobster's workers kill him just the same. Mr. Deaf mute only finds this out because they send the body to him to dispose of-- and he finds out that he was not able to help a person whose life he thought he was going to save.6. Finally, Mr. Deaf Mute goes to visit Mr. Mobster at his mother's house and kills him and all three of the men who killed Mr. Septic tank (who were also going to come to kill Mr. Mobster) for a very nice denoument.As a post-script, the Deaf Mute man befriends the boy who is later born to Mr. Septic tank's wife (who, it is clear, is very smart).This was a welcome change after watching ""2012"" (the updated version of the ""Noah's Ark"" story in the Bible). A film like that had lots and lots and lots of special effects, but ultimately a very pedestrian/ derivative plot. This film, however, was the polar opposite. They did very good work with a very low budget.At the outset, the film was a bit slow. And listening to the soundtrack, I wasn't sure whether this was supposed to be a comedy or something more intense (like, say, Goodfellas).Seymour Cassel ultimately stole the show, with his intense acting. (And this is a testament to the man's acting ability that he managed to do that in a wordless role.) The fact that his role had no words also shows how carefully the movie was written. (For example, Jasper's red socks being used to identify him later in the movie. For another, the buttons that he took from the shirt of the bodies of which he disposed being a way to keep track of the number of times that he had done such disposals.)This was well worth the 5RMB and 2 hours that it took to watch it.  Highly recommended.",5,"A bit slow in the beginning, but ultimately very good",1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,3555,"['Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'was', 'intersecting', 'stories', 'type', 'movie', 'la', 'Pulp', 'Fiction.', '1', 'see', 'mobster', 'who', 'process', 'plotting', 'take', 'over', 'business', 'rivals', 'point', 'learn', 'can', 'hold', 'breath', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'water', 'beginning', 'movie', 'trying', 'beat', 'money', 'someone', 'stole', 'literally', 'go', 'see', 'mother.2', 'mobster', 'associates', 'try', 'kill', 'visit', 'mother', 'reason', 'had', 'interrupt', 'beating', 'started', 'movie', 'car', 'veers', 'off', 'river', 'survive', 'attempt', 'underwater', 'breathing', 'before.3', 'man', 'wife', 'septic', 'tank', 'cleaner', 'want', 'have', 'child', 'bright', 'idea', 'rob', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Mobster', 'mother', 'order', 'get', 'funds', 'finance', 'wife', 'fertility', 'treatment', 'Oops', 'Mr.', 'Septic', 'Tank', 'worried', 'child', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'intelligent', 'painfully', 'clear', 'not', 'intelligent', 'so', 'cost', 'insemination', 'also', 'way', 'ensure', 'intelligence', 'offspring.4', 'Later', 'still', 'are', 'introduced', 'deaf', 'mute', 'who', 'meat', 'shop', 'care', 'bodies', 'Mr.', 'Mobster', 'activities', 'person', 'friendly', 'relationship', 'Septic', 'Tank', 'Cleaner', 'Later', 'Deaf', 'Mute', 'Guy', 'horse', 'race', '47,000', 'lonely', 'life', 'only', 'outlet', 'betting', 'race', 'track', 'time', 'time', 'bad', 'things', 'Mr.', 'Mobster', 'kill', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place.5', 'Eventually', 'Mr.', 'Mobster', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Septic', 'tank', 'stole', 'money', 'orders', 'men', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Septic', 'money', 'Deaf', 'Mute', 'Guy', 'Mr.', 'Mobster', 'workers', 'kill', 'just', 'same', 'Mr', 'Deaf', 'only', 'out', 'send', 'body', 'dispose', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'help', 'person', 'life', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'save.6', 'Finally', 'Mr', 'Deaf', 'Mute', 'visit', 'Mr.', 'Mobster', 'mother', 'house', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'killed', 'Mr.', 'Septic', 'tank', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'going', 'come', 'kill', 'Mr.', 'Mobster', 'very', 'nice', 'denoument.As', 'post-script', 'Deaf', 'Mute', 'man', 'boy', 'who', 'later', 'born', 'Mr.', 'Septic', 'tank', 'wife', 'who', 'clear', 'very', 'smart', '.This', 'was', 'welcome', 'change', 'watching', '2012', 'updated', 'version', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'story', 'Bible', 'film', 'had', 'lots', 'lots', 'lots', 'special', 'effects', 'ultimately', 'very', 'pedestrian/', 'derivative', 'plot', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'polar', 'opposite', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'very', 'low', 'outset', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'listening', 'soundtrack', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'something', 'more', 'intense', 'say', 'Goodfellas', '.Seymour', 'Cassel', 'ultimately', 'stole', 'show', 'intense', 'acting', 'testament', 'man', 'acting', 'ability', 'managed', 'do', 'wordless', 'role', 'fact', 'role', 'had', 'words', 'also', 'how', 'carefully', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'example', 'Jasper', 'red', 'socks', 'being', 'used', 'identify', 'later', 'movie', 'buttons', 'took', 'shirt', 'bodies', 'disposed', 'being', 'way', 'keep', 'track', 'number', 'times', 'had', 'done', 'such', 'disposals', 'was', 'well', '5RMB', '2', 'hours', 'took', 'watch', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1281978,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B002OVB9YE,Linda Linguvic,"[0, 0]","This 2009 film is full of violence, love and originality and even though the plot is non-linear it is quite easy to follow.  Starring Vincent D'Onofrio as a mob boss, the film opens with him viciously beating up a man who is tied to a chair.  We don't know why, but as the plot develops in its unique way, we soon find out a little at a time.  D'Onofrio's character is complex and his acting is great.  Another important character is played by Ethan Hawke.  He's a septic tank cleaner who sees himself as stupid and would like his unborn child to be smart.  He hears of a fertility treatment for his wife which will do exactly what he wants but it costs $50,000.  And so he plans a robbery.  This sets the convoluted plot in motion and includes some extraordinary acting by Seymour Cassel, cast as a deaf mute deli clerk with a gambling problem who is also a butcher charged with dismembering the dead victims of the mob.If all this sounds gruesome, it is.  But it is also quite humorous and the story is played out in a ""tongue in cheek"" way.  There isn't one boring moment in the whole 1 hour 35 minutes of this fast-paced film.

This movie reminded me of the many b movie crime flicks that I seen that go all the back to the 1950's. A group of men rob a mob boss and it can't go well for them. Not that most armed robbers aren't eventually caught either but if you rob a mobster that's gonna be really a bad deal.  However this movie uses a jump around format that you can still follow without being confused, You get the mobsters story , One of theives story and a mute deaf man played by the excellent seymour casel, these stories interact and they are the focal point. This is not a action movie though and the violence is done offscreen mainly except for some shootings.It's a crime drama that's very much filled with characterization and it does not movie quickly. SO I would say that this movie is overall a good b movie but it's the acting that gives it four for me.  Just like those great low budget crime flicks of the 40's-50's the stories were good but the acting was often great.  Those movies were often darker than this, but this is a case of a good drama that uses the intertwined method to tell it's story.  I liked it and wouldn't compare this to a four star A movie either.

But if you get through this atypical low-level crime boss story, a single performance will stand out for Seymour Cassel as one of his best.The story follows a small crew crime boss in Staten Island trying to make it big. Life takes some unexpected turns for him, those he trusts and for those who have stolen from him. Along the way we are gracefully rewarded with several meaningful story lines being retold as they overlap. A convincing performance by Ethan Hawke, D'Onofrio in a sort of cheese mode (he worded in his interview supplement on the BD as it being a comical yet serious role) and Cassel's epiphany character all culminate into a well made narrative about getting what you deserve - no matter who you are.The Blu quality is solid throughout with only a few grainy shortcomings, the DTS gets both subtle and varying usages (the deaf/mute character scenes have the sound muffled in a way to try and represent his world) and the main supplement provided some excellent insight from two unlikely sources; the extras include:* D'Onofrio interview, 2:19 minutes. He has always been about letting the work speak for itself and shunning interviews, so this was the usual brief narrative about character and that's it.* Deleted scenes, 2:36 minutes. Glad they were cut.* Commentary by Hawke, D'Onofrio and director DeMonaco. I had a new respect for Hawke due to his performance in the film, but his wit/intellect were even more interesting to listen to as he recorded this. And for D'Onofrio to finally talk extensively about anything to do with a movie and film making in general - was great. A worthy commentary if you are fans of either of these guys.Region coded A/B/C, listed as 1080i with English and Spanish subs.

1281988,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002OVB9YE,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","""Staten Island"" is not your typical mobster movie as there is one particular plot line which I found intriguing and a bit off-beat. There are three central characters in this movie - mob boss Parmie Tarzo (Vincent D'Onofrio), septic tank worker Sully Halverson (Ethan Hawke), and an aging deaf-mute deli worker Jasper Sabiano (Seymour Cassel in a brilliant performance).The movie does go back and forth in time - Parmie finds out that his cronies are tiring of him, and after an altercation, ends up living on a tree, hoping to make some sort of difference (a bit late if you ask me); Sully is desperate to make some real money as he has a pregnant wife to support (played by Julianne Nicholson) and this desperation drives him to commit a terrible crime with his co-worker and suffer the consequences later; and of course, my favorite of the three story arcs centers on the deaf-mute deli worker, Jasper. He is just trying to get along with life, and the highlight of his existence is placing bets on the horse races, waiting vainly for his big break, and when it comes, he finds he doesn't have a clue what to do with his winnings. His peace of mind is already shattered by the grisly demands placed upon him by Parmie Tarzo, who demands Jasper ""process"" dead bodies for him.The scenes where Jasper is at ""work"", processing the bodies have a level of surreal morbidity, especially with the muted effect (that simulate the scene from a deaf-mute's perspective). Seymour Cassel delivers a compelling performance as a kind man who is placed in a horrific situation, whose previously peaceful and quiet existence is shattered by Tarzo's constant harassment. The final scene, is one that I will not soon forget for its sense of poignancy and optimism. Those looking for a shoot em' up mobster film will be disappointed but those who appreciate something different might just like this unique offering.",4,Good take on the mobster movie genre,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,1898,"['Staten', 'Island', 'not', 'typical', 'mobster', 'movie', 'one', 'particular', 'plot', 'line', 'found', 'intriguing', 'bit', 'off-beat', 'are', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'movie', 'mob', 'boss', 'Parmie', 'Tarzo', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'septic', 'tank', 'worker', 'Sully', 'Halverson', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'aging', 'deaf-mute', 'deli', 'worker', 'Jasper', 'Sabiano', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'brilliant', 'performance', '.The', 'movie', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'Parmie', 'out', 'cronies', 'are', 'tiring', 'altercation', 'up', 'living', 'tree', 'hoping', 'make', 'sort', 'difference', 'bit', 'late', 'ask', 'Sully', 'desperate', 'make', 'real', 'money', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'support', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'desperation', 'commit', 'terrible', 'crime', 'co-worker', 'suffer', 'consequences', 'later', 'course', 'favorite', 'three', 'story', 'arcs', 'centers', 'deaf-mute', 'deli', 'worker', 'Jasper', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'highlight', 'existence', 'placing', 'bets', 'horse', 'races', 'waiting', 'vainly', 'big', 'break', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'do', 'winnings', 'peace', 'mind', 'already', 'shattered', 'grisly', 'demands', 'placed', 'Parmie', 'Tarzo', 'who', 'Jasper', 'process', 'dead', 'bodies', 'him.The', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jasper', 'work', 'processing', 'bodies', 'have', 'level', 'surreal', 'morbidity', 'especially', 'muted', 'effect', 'simulate', 'scene', 'deaf-mute', 'perspective', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'compelling', 'performance', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'placed', 'horrific', 'situation', 'previously', 'peaceful', 'quiet', 'existence', 'shattered', 'Tarzo', 'constant', 'harassment', 'final', 'scene', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget', 'sense', 'poignancy', 'optimism', 'looking', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'mobster', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'who', 'appreciate', 'something', 'different', 'might', 'just', 'like', 'unique', 'offering']",N/A
