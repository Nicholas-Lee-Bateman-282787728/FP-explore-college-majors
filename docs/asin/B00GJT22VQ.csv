Unfortunately due to Warner Bros on-going restrictions on him, this last season was curtailed in number, still priced far too high, was a DVD-R product and had no satisfactory ending. He just got in a buckboard and drive off. Luckily, he would reappear as character in an episode of Kung Fu and in one of Kenny Roger's- The Gambler TV movies. Five stars for Clint Walker and the character &#34;Cheyenne&#34; -- but only three stars for the high price and sputtering end.",3,"It sputters, rather than sizzles.",1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,606,"['was', 'last', 'season', 'Cheyenne', 'one', 'greatest', 'Western', 'series', 'ever', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'commanding', 'presence', 'dominated', 'action', 'Unfortunately', 'due', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'on-going', 'restrictions', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'curtailed', 'number', 'still', 'priced', 'far', 'too', 'high', 'was', 'DVD-R', 'product', 'had', 'satisfactory', 'ending', 'just', 'got', 'buckboard', 'drive', 'off', 'Luckily', 'would', 'reappear', 'character', 'episode', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'one', 'Kenny', ""Roger's-"", 'Gambler', 'TV', 'movies', 'Five', 'stars', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'character', '34', 'Cheyenne', '34', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'high', 'price', 'sputtering', 'end']",Cheyenne: The Complete Seventh Season

1678628,AYV0BT5KNQFXX,B00GJT22VQ,Debbie Wilson,"[2, 2]","Clint Walker set the example of a knight of the plains as Cheyenne Bodie. He protected the weak, was kind and gentlemanly, and totally manly, and almost always chose to do right. Growing up on his reruns, I was delighted to find the DVDs and to share them with my children and grandchildren as exemplary of what a man should be. Although not as creative as some later writers, yet the writers did come up with a variety of storylines that fit the Big Man to a T.The only problem is that seven seasons is not enough for those of us who loved the show and the character.",5,always a fan of Cheyenne,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,568,"['Clint', 'Walker', 'set', 'example', 'knight', 'plains', 'Cheyenne', 'Bodie', 'protected', 'weak', 'was', 'kind', 'gentlemanly', 'totally', 'manly', 'almost', 'always', 'chose', 'do', 'right', 'Growing', 'up', 'reruns', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'DVDs', 'share', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'exemplary', 'what', 'man', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'creative', 'later', 'writers', 'yet', 'writers', 'did', 'come', 'up', 'variety', 'storylines', 'fit', 'Big', 'Man', 'T.The', 'only', 'problem', 'seven', 'seasons', 'not', 'enough', 'who', 'loved', 'show', 'character']",Cheyenne: The Complete Seventh Season
1678629,A2IYTNAMLR5TJR,B00GJT22VQ,Don McGregor,"[9, 10]","It has been noted that when Cheyenne premiered on September 20, 1955, as part of an anthology series, Warner Brothers Presents which contained three separate, alternating series, one show was based on Casablanca and the other was based on King's Row.Like the railroad stretching West, Cheyenne showed that a one hour dramatic vehicle was possible.The lone Western hero who could be marshal, cow puncher, wanderer, or anything the producer and/or writers wanted, changed television in a significant way.And by the time Cheyenne threw his last punch and pulled his trigger for a final showdown, one-hour filmed dramas had become the norm, filling nighttime airwaves on all three networks.By the time Cheyenne rode into its final season in 1963, the television landscape had changed dramatically, the way so many Western stories heralded the radical change of the West from unchartered frontiers into hustling boom-towns bursting on the edge of the Pacific Ocean.The Warner Brothers private eye and western series, along with Disney, made ABC, a real player as a third network.Sexuality was a prime motivator in early Cheyennes. I suggest you buy the first couple of seasons and compare it with the final season.I haven't relooked at the first season's Cheyennes, but I can tell you without any fear of being wrong that husky, handsome Clint Walker may talk softly and draw quickly, but as surely as there is gunplay, there is also always some reason for him to take his shirt off, and go into a clinch bare-chested with a female lead.Check out the episodes in Cheyenne Season 2, Volumes 1 & 2.As the entire series now becomes available on DVD with Cheyenne &#8211; Season 7, one more plea to Warner Archives, before they start putting the private eye series onto disc: restore the bumpers!I've written this before, I'm not stopping now.No one did bumpers between commercials better than Warners.Warners did them better than Disney! And the company from &#34;the entertainment capital of the world&#34; never did it better than they did on the detective shows. The theme-song came up. The announcer's voice was sure and clear. The title of the episode was against the Sunset Strip locale. All this told you that you were watching something special.If they can get the bumpers into Peter Gunn, Dobie Gillis and Hawaii 5-0, then why not get them from the company that showed them how to do it best?Please, Warner Archive, get back to me on this!You can read much more on Cheyenne in my latest Riding Shotgun column up on Comicsbulletin.com, along with photos.Don",5,http://www.comicsbulletin.com/columns/6384/cheyenne--season-7-the-quintessential-quiet-until-riled-loner-cowboy-rides-into-the-l,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,2557,"['been', 'noted', 'when', 'Cheyenne', 'premiered', 'September', '20', '1955', 'part', 'anthology', 'series', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Presents', 'contained', 'three', 'separate', 'alternating', 'series', 'one', 'show', 'was', 'based', 'Casablanca', 'other', 'was', 'based', 'King', 'Row.Like', 'railroad', 'stretching', 'West', 'Cheyenne', 'showed', 'one', 'hour', 'dramatic', 'vehicle', 'was', 'possible.The', 'lone', 'Western', 'hero', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'marshal', 'puncher', 'wanderer', 'anything', 'producer', 'and/or', 'writers', 'wanted', 'changed', 'television', 'significant', 'way.And', 'time', 'Cheyenne', 'threw', 'last', 'punch', 'pulled', 'trigger', 'final', 'showdown', 'one-hour', 'filmed', 'dramas', 'had', 'become', 'norm', 'filling', 'nighttime', 'airwaves', 'three', 'time', 'Cheyenne', 'rode', 'final', 'season', '1963', 'television', 'landscape', 'had', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'Western', 'stories', 'heralded', 'radical', 'change', 'West', 'unchartered', 'frontiers', 'hustling', 'boom-towns', 'bursting', 'edge', 'Pacific', 'Ocean.The', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'private', 'eye', 'western', 'series', 'Disney', 'made', 'ABC', 'real', 'player', 'third', 'network.Sexuality', 'was', 'prime', 'motivator', 'early', 'Cheyennes', 'suggest', 'buy', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'compare', 'final', 'season.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'relooked', 'first', 'season', 'Cheyennes', 'can', 'tell', 'fear', 'being', 'wrong', 'husky', 'handsome', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'may', 'talk', 'softly', 'draw', 'quickly', 'as', 'surely', 'gunplay', 'also', 'always', 'reason', 'take', 'shirt', 'go', 'clinch', 'bare-chested', 'female', 'lead.Check', 'episodes', 'Cheyenne', 'Season', '2', 'Volumes', '1', '2.As', 'entire', 'series', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'Cheyenne', '8211', 'Season', '7', 'one', 'more', 'plea', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'start', 'putting', 'private', 'eye', 'series', 'disc', 'restore', 'bumpers', ""'ve"", 'written', ""'m"", 'not', 'stopping', 'one', 'did', 'bumpers', 'commercials', 'better', 'Warners.Warners', 'did', 'better', 'Disney', 'company', '34', 'entertainment', 'capital', 'world', '34', 'never', 'did', 'better', 'did', 'detective', 'shows', 'theme-song', 'came', 'up', 'announcer', 'voice', 'was', 'sure', 'clear', 'title', 'episode', 'was', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'locale', 'told', 'were', 'watching', 'something', 'special.If', 'can', 'get', 'bumpers', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'Dobie', 'Gillis', 'Hawaii', '5-0', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'get', 'company', 'showed', 'how', 'do', 'best', 'Please', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'get', 'back', 'can', 'read', 'much', 'more', 'Cheyenne', 'latest', 'Riding', 'Shotgun', 'column', 'up', 'Comicsbulletin.com', 'photos.Don']",Cheyenne: The Complete Seventh Season

Benedictson,"[1, 1]","As was the previous seasons, Cheyenne in its last season never lost track of the production values that made this series the success that it was.  To bad it ran only for seven seasons but Warner Bros mixed the Cheyenne Show with several other series to make 39 episodes for each season as most other series did so on their own which may have only a one or two season run.
