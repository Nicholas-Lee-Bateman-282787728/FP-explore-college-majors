1287623,A38O6C1A8AWUGH,B002T4DTY4,A reader,"[5, 6]","This movie invites a quick comparison to the Big Chill, but the story only has superficial nods to that fine movie. ""Pretty Ugly People"" has things all too lacking in today's movies-character development, genuine drama, and thoughtfullness that lingers long after the DVD is ejected. I guess it wasn't enough of a feel good movie, or didn't have enough star power, or maybe was just too realistic for the megaplexes to like. This is a movie to make just about everybody squirm, and that's part of its charm. This movie is more real that the so-called ""reality"" shows on TV, and is a refreshing cold breeze compared to the slop and inferior remakes that Hollywood is churning out now.",4,Reality Biting Hard,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,683,"['movie', 'quick', 'comparison', 'Big', 'Chill', 'story', 'only', 'superficial', 'nods', 'fine', 'movie', 'Pretty', 'Ugly', 'People', 'things', 'too', 'lacking', 'today', 'movies-character', 'development', 'genuine', 'drama', 'thoughtfullness', 'lingers', 'long', 'DVD', 'ejected', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'star', 'power', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'realistic', 'megaplexes', 'like', 'movie', 'make', 'just', 'everybody', 'squirm', 'part', 'charm', 'movie', 'more', 'real', 'so-called', 'reality', 'shows', 'TV', 'refreshing', 'cold', 'breeze', 'compared', 'slop', 'inferior', 'remakes', 'Hollywood', 'churning', 'out', 'now']",N/A

Pretty people on the outside, ugly people on the inside. And maybe I was fooled by the way the cover and opening sequence seemed to make this movie a bright, cheery, funny movie like Sandra Bullock or Hugh Grant.Possibly spoilers:This movie was rarely funny. And what I could not get past was how such horrible people stay friends with each other. I could not imagine being friends with most of them. Maybe the steward (who was a saint or an idiot to keep going back to that narcissistic new-skinny chick, and helping that gay dude), and maybe the small-penis dude, who seemed like a genuine guy.I mean, really, they are just ugly people and halfway through I just wanted a meteor to come down and wipe most of them out. And I started wishing Freddy from Friday the 13th would appear.And yes, I get it. People are like that because of their past and things that happened to them. But, c'mon, to make us sit through an entire movie of hateful people (except for 2), shoot, I get enough of that everyday. I don't need to see this and again, I don't think any of them would stay friends with each other.Here are the pros: nicely acted, there are pretty people to look at, nice cinema photography.

The characters were so totally unsympathetic, that I didn't care at all what happened to them. The central character has gathered all her loser friends around her by claiming that she ""only had a little time left."" Naturally, they think she is about to die, and gather around her, out of a feeling of obligation. Most are outright annoyed by the plea for help. They are all vain, superficial and narcissistic.If we are supposed to be sympathetic to the main character, who is only about to announce that she has come close to her ""goal weight,"" the screenwriters have misjudged their audience. Even when she has her moment, announcing the realization that those friends are nothing to envy,  we still don't like her. The truth is, to this viewer, that the heroine is even worse than the rest.The ""joyous"" ending where all are now fully evolved and liberated to be who they really are meant to be is a tremendously convuleted plot twist about a bus crash.Oy vay.",2,"Lord, please keep people like this far away from me!

The movie kept my interest with a steady release of events or character nuance. I enjoyed the journey of literal and figurative hills and valleys.
