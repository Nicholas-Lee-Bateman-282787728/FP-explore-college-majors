1050508,AS558SNWF1DXG,B000MTEFPA,Clare Quilty,"[17, 17]","One young British soldier, who celebrates his 20th birthday while training for the impending D-Day invasion, writes a letter to his parents and tells them that as time passes, he feels like a smaller and smaller part of a bigger and bigger machine.Being a small component of a massive device is the central idea behind Stuart Cooper's ""Overlord,"" an odd, hazy, child's-fever-dream of a movie that uses staged black-and-white scenes interspersed with actual archival footage from World War II.We follow Tom (Brian Stirner) through a drab, dispiriting round of basic training; his experiences are interspersed with separate scenes of battle, of invasion and aftermath to illustrate events going on ""meanwhile"" all around him, events leading up to Normandy.The movie is a truly unique visual experience. John Alcott shot the storyline scenes (just before he began work on ""Barry Lyndon"") and the movie has a look not unlike ""The Elephant Man,"" or its thematic brother, ""Johnny Got His Gun.""Though the incorporation of actual footage is very smooth, I never had any trouble distinguishing what came from the 40s and what was shot in the 70s. That didn't ruin the experience for me: Look at the hauntingly beautiful scenes involving bombers flying above the cloudline at night, or a harrowing training sequence in which a rowboat ditches its passengers onto rocks (Cooper reveals in his commentary that one or two men actually died during the exercise).With its short, spare narrative and its stark conclusion, ""Overlord"" almost feels like a short story of a movie, but that doesn't downplay its impact or importance. This is a little-known movie worth reviving and it gets a fine Criterion presentation here. The commentary with Copper and Sterner is particularly good; it's worth listening to to hear how they did it even if you don't particularly connect with the film.",4,"""A smaller and smaller part of a bigger and bigger machine....""

1050509,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000MTEFPA,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","""Operation Overlord"", the code-name used for the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, commanded by General Dwight Eisenhower.  A code-name in which Americans, Canadians, British and French soldiers joined together to fight against the resistance and to overtake the Germans in Normandy.  Over 150,000 men were planned for a mass landing and the Allied Forces would end up as the victors in the second World War.Fast forward to the '70s and a new war taking place in Vietnam, needless to say that people were growing sick of the war and while previous war films were successful as propaganda films, in 1975, a film directed by Stuart Cooper would feature a young soldier named Tom Beddows who was called up to join the military and fight in the war but would have images of him being killed in battle.Unlike any war film seen ever in cinema at that time, Cooper who was to work on a documentary about soldier embroidery did a lot of research and in the process was able to find archived footage kept at the Imperial War Museum and instead, wanted to male a film about a young soldier's journey and outlook on life as a young man who is called up to join the military, his life in boot camp and his life and thoughts as he and his fellow soldiers are being whisked to the beaches to fight in the war.  But what made ""Overlord"" so much different from war films is that it effectively combined archived newsreel and fictional war footage captured by various sources and successfully creating a war film in 1975.  But also, the main character was influenced by the letters of several D-day soldiers.But because the film came out years after the Vietnam War and months after Nixon's resignation, people were wanting to get away from anything political let alone war-related and thus this UK brilliant film failed to get US theatrical distribution and although shown at some screenings and on television, especially winning the Silver Bear at the 1975 Berlin Film Festival, unfortunately ""Overlord"" was a film that was more or less forgotten.Fast forward to 2007, over 30-years later after the film's screening, the film was finally released in the US courtesy of The Criterion Collection.VIDEO:""Overlord - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #382' is presented in 1:66:1 black and white. According to THE CRITERION COLLECTION, the DVD release was supervised by director Stuart Cooper and the new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35mm fine-grain master positive.  The MTI Digital Restoration System was used to remove thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches.  Apple Shake software was utilized to reduce film jitter.  To maintain optimal image quality through the compression process, the picture on this dual-layer DVD-9 was encoded at the highest-possible bit rate for the quantity of material included.""Overlord"" looks appropriate with its black and white footage and wonderful cinematography by John Alcott (""A Clockwork Orange"", ""The Beastmaster"", ""No Way Out"") in capturing the feel of World War II and using the correct lens and getting the right shots to blend in with the archival footage from various sources.  The way the footage and the film came together was extraordinarily well done.  Very well-done cuts by Stuart Cooper and for the most part, a fantastic job!AUDIO:According to THE CRITERION COLLECTION, the soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from the 35mm magnetic stems and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The film is Dolby Digital 1.0 and thus is center channel-driven.  I chose to set my receiver to stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Overlord - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #382"" comes with the following special features:* Audio Commentary - Audio commentary by director Stuart Cooper and actor Brian Stirner.* Theatrical Trailer - (2:51) The original 1975 theatrical trailer.* Mining the Archive - (23:23) Imperial War Museum film archivists Roger Smither and Anne Fleming discuss Stuart Cooper's use of archival war footage for the film and also additional footage shot on D-day by service cameramen.* Soldiers' Journals - Featuring a text-based feature which include journals from D-Day soldiers, Sergeant Edward Robert McCosh and Sergeant Finlay Campbell.

Possibly one of the top war films ever created that people never saw, let alone a film that possibly many people have never heard of.  A wonderful UK film that received critical praise but yet has been forgotten.  A film that didn't follow the banality of war films, a film so fantastic, wonderfully filmed and well-acted but yet, is not a well-known film possibly due to the timing of the film's release and America's current state post-war and post-Whitewater, the film never received theatrical distribution until 30 years later courtesy of Janus Films and a DVD release from THE CRITERION COLLECTION.Effectively bringing together newsreel and fictional war footage from World War II and creating this harmonic tie-in with Stuart Cooper's film is quite amazing.  It was definitely seamless in how the film goes from regular film to war footage and to think that this film was created over 30-years after World War II and over 30-years  it took for this film to receive any kind of distribution here in the United States.And through the efforts of long research and for Stuart Cooper and those at the Imperial War Museum to select the right video cuts that would surprise the audience who probably are unfamiliar with this World War II footage.  May it be the night runs as bombs are dropped all over a city to the day run and more bombing and the city and to see the tragedy unfold with the various cities destroyed and to see also see many people dead.  As disturbing these images are, they were carefully selected and made part of the film.  In fact, it took Stuart Cooper years of hunting through these national archives for images and footage for the film.The cinematography by John Alcott (a cinematographer who had worked with Stanley Kubrick a good a number of times) is fantastic and to think that they had a limited budget with limited resources to create this film is amazing.  Where today's films need to use CG to effectively show many soldiers at war and incredible devastation.  But this was not the case back then in 1975, it all came down to the support of the museum, years of thorough research and a supportive military and most of all, having a wonderful cinematographer who was able to capture this amazing footage and through editing, making everything seem seamless and for the most part, the combined war footage worked.  And with Alcott's involvement, it makes you wonder how much of this film inspired Stanley Kubrick in his war film ""Full Metal Jacket"".Despite utilizing unknown talent, Brian Stirner along with Davyd Harries, Nicholas Ball and Julie Neesam were quite effective in their roles and because these talents were unknown, in some way or other, it made the film have a realistic feel to it.  The fact is that a soldier's life during a World War was uncertain.  This film was unlike many other war films out there.  What we do see is actual war footage which becomes the movie's own personal action sequence but also showing us the ugliness and devastation of war, while the movie portion which is through one young man's eye, it is a war film not about surviving but a war about a young guy who loves to read, drafted into the military and being trained to go into war and the protagonist feeling that the outcome in his life is death.Having grown up with a father in the military as with my grandfather, the whole concept of being drafted was so scary to me.  I was young at the time but I can remember hearing on television about the draft and of course, the threat of a nuclear attack from Russia was always looming as the threat of World War III was always talked about in the news, featured on television and movies.  Needless to say, at a young age, I was always in constant fear that I may be drafted and because of the films I was watching at the time, always had these nightmares of being a soldier and killed in battle.So, for me, watching ""Overlord"" was quite an interesting experience to see how the soldiers had their take on being drafted and just seeing them talk about their fears.  Granted, the demeanor of the main character Tom, who is perhaps your ""good boy"" type of character, I suppose having a life that one never really had to worry about danger and then being called up to serve in the military to fight a war, it was interesting to see if this young man would be phased by all this rough training and seeing if his friends and their worries would start to have an affect on him.  And once he starts having those recurring nightmares, although he may seem calm and collected, it's really interesting of how his character develops throughout the film, especially when he meets a woman that he likes at a dance hall or even watching a movie with a woman.In many ways, I saw this film and enjoyed of how it seemed quite poetic.  May it be due to director Stuart Cooper's handling of wartime footage and newsreel footage from World War II and effectively interweaving it with his film and if anything, I see ""Overlord"" as wonderful filmmaking for its time and its lack of a significant budget.  If anything, Cooper's film is quite inspirational for filmmakers as it shows the budding filmmaker of how an effective war film can be done without spending millions of dollars.  Granted, the film was created back in 1975 but still, you can't help but watch ""Overlord"" and be impressed of what was accomplished.As for THE CRITERION COLLECTION DVD release of""Overlord""...I felt it was fantastic.  From several lengthy and informative featurettes and interviews, especially to hear the staff from the Imperial War Museum to the reading of D-day soldier letters, tribute to service unit cameramen, audio commentary and a essay booklet from film critic Kent James, this DVD is a well-rounded release and is simply is deserving of my recommendation of a must-own Criterion Collection DVD, especially for those who are war cinema aficionados.Overall, ""Overlord"" is a unique and effective war film that is remarkably moving and visually impressive.  Definitely recommended!",4,The unknown and forgotten war classic that definitely deserves recognition...,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,11716,"['Operation', 'Overlord', 'code-name', 'used', 'Allied',

I watched it wanting to like it. To get that cinematic rush you get when you see something really fresh and inventive. What an unbelievable letdown. This movie stinks out loud.Many talk about the ""seamless"" melding of the archival footage with the new footage. It might have been near seamless in that they shot the new stuff to look like the old stuff but that's as far as it goes. The Action of the two is no where near seamless. When you're looking at the archival footage, it's just that and nothing more.As half the running time or less is new footage and the new footage is all very inexpensive, my guess is they simply had no money and digging up the archival stuff was a cheap way to go. As for the storyline:It's about as cliche ridden as they come. There is nothing here you have not seen or heard in any number of other war movies. The acting isn't particularly notable and there is not really much of a plot at all. It's dull beyond the meaning of the word.Had they been smarter, they might have tried starting with the archival footage and build the story around that. But they didn't so it stinks.Stay away at risk of being bored and ticked off at the same time.",1,Am I missing something here!?,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,1304,"['really', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'was', 'sucked', 'great', 'user', 'reviews', 'fact', 'was', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'watched', 'wanting', 'like', 'get', 'cinematic', 'rush', 'get', 'when', 'see', 'something', 'really', 'fresh', 'inventive', 'What', 'unbelievable', 'letdown', 'movie', 'out', 'loud.Many', 'talk', 'seamless', 'melding', 'archival', 'footage', 'new', 'footage', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'near', 'seamless', 'shot', 'new', 'stuff', 'look', 'old', 'stuff', 'as', 'far', 'Action', 'two', 'where', 'near', 'seamless', 'When', ""'re"", 'looking', 'archival', 'footage', 'just', 'nothing', 'more.As', 'running', 'time', 'new', 'footage', 'new', 'footage', 'very', 'inexpensive', 'guess', 'simply', 'had', 'money', 'digging', 'up', 'archival', 'stuff', 'was', 'cheap', 'way', 'go', 'storyline', 'cliche', 'ridden', 'come', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'heard', 'number', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'acting', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'notable', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'plot', 'dull', 'meaning', 'word.Had', 'been', 'smarter', 'might', 'have', 'tried', 'starting', 'archival', 'footage', 'build', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'stinks.Stay', 'away', 'risk', 'being', 'bored', 'ticked', 'off', 'same', 'time']",Overlord
1050511,A3LGFYDVKLICY8,B000MTEFPA,John Morgan,"[7, 7]","As with any film that Criterion chooses to put out, ""Overlord"" is well worth watching. If you're coming to this film as I did, however, not knowing anything about it, you may be surprised to find that this is NOT a retelling of D-Day in the style of ""The Longest Day"" or ""Saving Private Ryan."" Other than a few shots of air raids from the archives, there is no combat whatsoever depicted in this film, and it ends just as the Allies are first hitting the beaches on that day. I think it was a bit misleading to entitle the film ""Overlord"" and then have ""D-Day, June 6, 1944"" emblazoned across the cover, since nearly all of the film takes place BEFORE D-Day. Overlord (the Allies' code-name for the invasion) here seems to be used in a more metaphorical sense, since the only overlord in this film would seem to be war itself, an overarching unseen presence which first deprives men of their individuality and freedom, and then destroys them physically. As others have written, this film consists of two elements: archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, and the story of a young British Everyman who is called up and undergoes training in preparation for D-Day. The archive film is quite impressive; I've spent many hours watching WWII film and a lot of this material, which is quite interesting, was new to me. Other than some air raid film, however, most of it depicts the massive preparations that had to be carried out in order to prepare for the invasion. As for the new parts of the film, they are visually quite interesting, particularly since it was filmed by John Alcott, a veteran of four of Kubrick's greatest films. It looks distinctive and yet meshes well with the archive footage...in a few instances, it's hard to tell which is which. But I do have to agree with others here that the story itself, such as it is, falls flat. The story of the naive young recruit who has to undergo a rite of passage into the ranks of the military, and who frets about his possible fate in combat, has been done so many times, both before and since ""Overlord,"" in both books and films, that the plot aspect ends up being riddled with well-filmed but uninteresting cliches. So, I give this film five stars for its visuals, but only one star for its plot, and that averages out to three. One last note: as usual with Criterion, the extras are quite good on this disc and help to justify its cost. There are several short documentaries which discuss the origins of the archive footage that is used, plus some dramatic readings by the principal actor of excerpts from actual diaries kept by British D-Day veterans.",3,"Visually striking, but NOT a war film in the usual sense",1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,2613,"['film', 'Criterion', 'put', 'out', 'Overlord', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'coming', 'film', 'did', 'however', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'NOT', 'retelling', 'D-Day', 'style', 'Longest', 'Day', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Other', 'few', 'shots', 'air', 'raids', 'archives', 'combat', 'whatsoever', 'depicted', 'film', 'just', 'Allies', 'are', 'first', 'hitting', 'beaches', 'day', 'think', 'was', 'bit', 'misleading', 'entitle', 'film', 'Overlord', 'then', 'have', 'D-Day', 'June', '6', '1944', 'emblazoned', 'cover', 'nearly', 'film', 'place', 'D-Day', 'Overlord', 'Allies', 'code-name', 'invasion', 'here', 'be', 'used', 'more', 'metaphorical', 'sense', 'only', 'overlord', 'film', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'war', 'overarching', 'unseen', 'presence', 'first', 'men', 'individuality', 'freedom', 'then', 'destroys', 'physically', 'others', 'have', 'written', 'film', 'two', 'elements', 'archive', 'footage', 'Imperial', 'War', 'Museum', 'story', 'young', 'British', 'Everyman', 'who', 'called', 'up', 'undergoes', 'training', 'preparation', 'D-Day', 'archive', 'film', 'quite', 'impressive', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'many', 'hours', 'watching', 'WWII', 'film', 'lot', 'material', 'quite', 'interesting', 'was', 'new', 'Other', 'air', 'raid', 'film', 'however', 'most', 'massive', 'preparations', 'had', 'be', 'carried', 'out', 'order', 'prepare', 'invasion', 'new', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'visually', 'quite', 'interesting', 'particularly', 'was', 'filmed', 'John', 'Alcott', 'veteran', 'four', 'Kubrick', 'greatest', 'films', 'distinctive', 'yet', 'meshes', 'well', 'archive', 'footage', 'few', 'instances', 'hard', 'tell', 'do', 'have', 'agree', 'others', 'here', 'story', 'such', 'flat', 'story', 'naive', 'young', 'recruit', 'who', 'undergo', 'rite', 'passage', 'ranks', 'military', 'who', 'frets', 'possible', 'fate', 'combat', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'Overlord', 'books', 'films', 'plot', 'aspect', 'up', 'being', 'riddled', 'well-filmed', 'uninteresting', 'cliches', 'So', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'visuals', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'plot', 'out', 'three', 'One', 'last', 'note', 'usual', 'Criterion', 'extras', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'disc', 'help', 'justify', 'cost', 'are', 'several', 'short', 'documentaries', 'discuss', 'origins', 'archive', 'footage', 'used', 'dramatic', 'readings', 'principal', 'actor', 'excerpts', 'actual', 'diaries', 'kept', 'British', 'D-Day', 'veterans']",Overlord
1050512,A1FNW6H983I87V,B000MTEFPA,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[2, 3]","The film, shot deliberately in black & white, opens with a young man in England leaving home for boot camp. He appears to be the definition of average, neither overly bright nor stupid. Naive might be a label that applies, if anything. Young men all over England are being called up as casualties mount on the European front and the Allies prepare for D-Day. The strength of the film is in its use of terrific archival footage from the Imperial War Museum within the movie. Our young soldier survives boot camp and thanks to a fellow soldier becomes a little more worldly than before he entered the service. The use of the archival film to show the massive buildup of troops and equipment contrasted with the loneliness and fear of the solitary soldier is effective in understanding D-Day. Some of the footage from the archives is amazing and worth watching the film for that alone. You have the most massive military invasion in history and yet at its core is the individual soldier. He meets and falls in love with a very nice young girl but will there be a future together-will there be a future at all? Neither of them can be sure. His unit learns that they will be among the first to land on D-Day. Cannon fodder-that's what they begin to see themselves. How would you react knowing your chances of surviving the invasion are slim and none? While some see this an anti-war film, I think it is more a reality of war film. While war may be a necessary evil in the face of greater evils, that doesn't change the fact that is evil and young lives and families are forever changed. A film that will make you pause and consider the consequences of even the most just war.

1050513,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B000MTEFPA,maskirovka,"[5, 9]","Frankly, I was disappointed by this film.  I knew that it would not be a spectacular like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (which I also did not like that much except for the opening).  But I felt the movie was far too surreal and ""artistic.""  Case in point, there were several long sequences that tracked planes flying over Europe and showing the devastation (and I mean LONG sequences).  The ""hero"" of the story was an infantryman so the flight sequences were awfully disconnected from the very, very minimal plot.  There were a number of other ""out of place"" scenes as well, the most notable being one where inexplicably, we see two of the soldiers in the story sneak into a theater where a little girl is being made to sing on a stage by her mother.Another thing I did not like was the morbid nature of the hero.  I don't have a problem with him feeling that he was going to die.  I imagine a lot of our guys and the Brits did on the eve of Overlord.  I just can't imagine writing a letter forecasting my own death to my parents.  Given the fact that they would have been worried sick already, it would have been the wrong thing to do.  And I speak from experience since I was in the Army and while I did not see hand-to-hand combat, I was in several combat zones, and while I was scared, I managed to avoid writing morbid letters back home to my folks.On a final note, I can't help but wonder if this film is very much so a product of the 1970s and post-Vietnam era both in the rather dreamy nature of the film and the muted anti-war tone.If I had to do it over again, I would not have spent the money I did on this film to buy it new.

Though shot on the run, by many photographers, on little 16mm cameras, these 'real' images of war rise to the status of art.  'Overlord' takes this footage - or some of it - the selection process must have been a lengthy labour of love - and integrates it with new footage to tell the story of three representative, low-ranking 'ordinary' soldiers.  This story makes a framing device for the archival footage; we see call-up, induction, training, more training, postings hither and yon, anxiety and fear, and embarkation for Normandy and D-Day.  Meanwhile, London is bombed and burns, and B-52s raid the enemy.  The excellent editing juxtaposes the banal with the horrific.  The movie never glorifies war - on the contrary.  Unfortunately, however, the created 'story' of our three soldiers is a bit flat, maybe because of the director's determination that his three soldiers be just three ordinary Joes caught up in this massive event.  So no 'stars' to distract us, but no really engaging performances either.  The deliberately anti-climactic ending (see the excellent 'Extras' to confirm this) will probably disappoint many.

I can feel it, the way you feel it when you're going to get a cold.""Stuart Cooper's big screen directorial career has been curious one. As an actor he was one of the original Dirty Dozen, which may have helped him secure Donald Sutherland for his almost unseen Anglo-Canadian thriller The Disappearance - a title that all too accurately describes the fate of his intriguing, though not always successful low budget anti-war film. Critically slated on its minute original release and disappearing from distribution for more than 30 years before being rediscovered in the States, it focuses on one British private in the months leading up to the Normandy landings as he fantasises of the worst happening. It's a small, minimalist film, its attempt to widen its scope through footage from the Imperial War Museum (who commissioned the film) not as successful as the austere black and white photography. Despite using matching lenses and film stock that would have been used in the era the footage is less than seamlessly integrated, which can be distracting even in a film this deliberately stylised. Yet there's much here that is effective, be it the dream imagery of a kiss on an empty landing craft or the film's convincing portrait of the mixture of boredom and fear as the invasion draws closer - ""Die of boredom, die of battle, what's the difference?"" While it's hard to call the film a complete success, it is ultimately quietly haunting and affecting.Not for all tastes, but certainly a worthwhile release with some good extras on the DVD.",3,"""I don't think I shall live to see the end of this war.""",1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,1662,"['silly', 'war', 'killed', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'already', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'be', 'one', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'feel', 'way', 'feel', 'when', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'cold', 'Stuart', 'Cooper', 'big', 'screen', 'directorial', 'career', 'been', 'curious', 'one', 'actor', 'was', 'one', 'original', 'Dirty', 'Dozen', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'secure', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'almost', 'unseen', 'Anglo-Canadian', 'thriller', 'Disappearance', 'title', 'too', 'accurately', 'fate', 'intriguing', 'not', 'always', 'successful', 'low', 'budget', 'anti-war', 'film', 'Critically', 'slated', 'minute', 'original', 'release', 'disappearing', 'distribution', 'more', '30', 'years', 'being', 'rediscovered', 'States', 'one', 'British', 'private', 'months', 'leading', 'up', 'Normandy', 'landings', 'worst', 'happening', 'small', 'minimalist', 'film', 'attempt', 'widen', 'scope', 'footage', 'Imperial', 'War', 'Museum', 'who', 'commissioned', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'successful', 'austere', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'using', 'matching', 'lenses', 'film', 'stock', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'era', 'footage', 'less', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'can', 'be', 'distracting', 'even', 'film', 'deliberately', 'stylised', 'much', 'here', 'effective', 'be', 'dream', 'imagery', 'kiss', 'empty', 'landing', 'craft', 'film', 'convincing', 'portrait', 'mixture', 'boredom', 'fear', 'invasion', 'closer', 'Die', 'boredom', 'die', 'battle', 'what', 'difference', 'hard', 'call', 'film', 'complete', 'success', 'ultimately', 'quietly', 'haunting', 'affecting.Not', 'tastes', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'release', 'good', 'extras', 'DVD']",Overlord
