1458654,A19JPROF2J4PA4,B005FITIK0,Acheron's Flow,"[10, 10]","No, she's not quite that bad. If you are expecting the traditional American Rom Com with rosy happy ending and predictable in the first 10 minutes, you will hate this movie.Mavis Gary is having a crisis. Work is pressing for the last book in the teen series she writes continuing the story created by another writer. With out the acclaims. No one knows she writes it and the series is dying. So she is rethinking her life/loves after a divorce. You can see the world pressing in on her brain. And her journey begins back to the happy days she wants to recapture.The poor girl is neurotic and evil. Or maybe sees others as a means to what she wants. She plays the emotionless flat affect with the antisocial behavior to a tee. The scenes with her mother and father and the hair pulling disorder trichotillomania bring in some reality and focus I thought. As the movie progresses you see her evolution or will it end up devolution. I could not tell where she would end up. And I admit it ended more realistic I think. Scene with the sister is sublimely ironic. Karma.You still kind of like her even at the end. Just a little bit. This is due to the skill of Charlize Theron and a Diablo Cody script, directed by Reitman. The scenes with Patton Oswalt are fantastic. They need to work together more.This is more of a character study I think than a dark comedy. Though there are elements of dark humor. And Charlize, can she do a bad movie or part? I tried to remember a bad part she did and came up empty. Monster, a movie I didn't really like, was some great acting. I think you could put a bucket on her head while painting a fence and it would turn out good.If you like varied types of movies you should see this. At times I wanted to look away from the screen at what she was about to do. Don't listen to the one star reviews. No way is this only a one star. There are plenty of factory produced American films to make them happy. I like a good factory produced happy ending predictable movie complete with silliness but I need films like this too. Something to break into the numbness-watch this movie to see what I mean.Free on Prime.

I thought Charlize Theron was magnificent as Mavis, but I also want to highlight Beth/Elizabeth Reaser's performance.  She is not just a passive good wife.  She is not just a nice ordinary person.  She is no pushover.  You see glimpses of how funny, quirky and smart she is, so you understand why Buddy/Patrick Wilson is mesmerized - and completely in love with her; he is following her lead.  Elizabeth Reaser's performance is just perfect - from her smiles welcoming Mavis, her enthusiasm playing the drums, and the hurt look on her face when Mavis/Charlize Theron bellows at her.

1458657,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B005FITIK0,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 0]","Young Adult starring Charlize Theron is not one of those fluffy romantic comedies as it was portrayed to be. This film written by Diablo Cody and directed Jason Reitman (the winning duo behind Juno) is about a divorced woman who writes young adult fiction novels, and pretty much has a ""breakdown"" when she goes back home to try to win back her ex-boyfriend who's now married. Theron nails her role as Mavis, I don't think any other actress could have pulled it off but her. Mavis is a very delusional, depressed woman who drinks way too much, pulls out her own hair, and her life as a writer is coming to an abrupt halt. The thing that was the most frustrating and yet real about Mavis is she really makes no attempts to change her self-destructive behavior. Mavis will do anything to get what she wants, and along the way her friends and family start to notice she's falling apart in more ways than one. This movie doesn't have a clear-cut ending which makes Young Adult seem believable, but this movie is not for everyone. It's not a very happy film, there's a lot of unanswered questions and Mavis is not a likable character so it does make it nearly impossible to root for her.

Black comedy? I suppose. But it tends more towards pure drama. We've all seen movies where a writer narrates a film while penning their adventures. What a great twist here though. It's more of a deluded fantasy because the viewer hears an occasional lofty narrative, but what plays out is a weird anti- fairy tale.The main character leaves her phony glamorous life as a young adult book writer due to a miserable existence and heads back to small town USA where she grew up.  She tries to capture the boyfriend of her teens that is now married and has a baby.Great acting all around as the psychological passings of life give you a zing. Alcohol fuels the fire as an old nerdy high school classmate tries to set her straight while living in his own undesirable state. A film about not growing up and being full of yourself.

After Thank You for Smoking in 2005, Reitman proved he wasn't a one-hit wonder by earning Academy love for his next two films, Juno and Up in the Air. In his latest effort, Young Adult, Charlize Theron stars as Mavis Gary, a selfish, self-absorbed former prom queen-turned-writer who returns to her hometown in hopes of winning back her happily married high school sweetheart, instead reconnecting with a former classmate she barely remembers. Working from a script by Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody, Young Adult drummed up a little bit of early awards buzz, but ultimately got no love. Some have speculated that audiences didn't quite know how to respond to the film's bittersweet themes, and Mavis is such an unlikable character that it may have turned off others.

This is the tale of an alcoholic ""young teen"" who searches for her lost youth by trying to reconnect with her high-school boyfriend.  He is, however, happily married.  She is in denial of her alcoholism, her lost youth, his marriage, her lost dreams, and, like many alcoholics, repeats an alcoholic pattern in her life only resulting in further despair.The trailer did not do the movie justice.  The trailer gives the mistaken impression this is, somehow, a comedy.  It isn't.  The character Ms. Theron plays is complex and difficult to analyze.  The protagonist, a partially-crippled, slightly overweight high-school classmates whose locker was next to this ""prom queen"" reflects how evil high school can be--wrath so many of us know as coming from the prom queens and ""jocks"".  Yet, all over America, high school continue to nominate, and vote for, their ""mean-girl"" cheerleading squads and ""jock"" Homecoming Kings--only to, in reality, despise them in later years.This is that film.  But, here, the ""mean-girl"" really despises herself, her failures, and in reflection somehow seemingly makes amends with her old chubby classmate--only to, in reality, use him to fulfill the same cylical alcoholic spin-cycle.  Her old boyfriend?  Not a major player.  He isn't the story.  She is.It's a great movie.  If you want to retroflex your hatred for high school, reflect on your own failures, and bury yourself in another drink of bourbon, watch this movie.  I'd love to see a high-school literary class rip this one down to its educational basics.And, I dare say, if you're every nominated to be homecoming queen, or prom queen, or head cheerleader, you have just been relegated to being hated the rest of your life.

Up in the Air and Thank you for smoking are fine examples of such characters.

At 37. she is divorced, an alcoholic, a ghost writer for adult fiction series Waverly Prep, which is soon to be cancelled. Still Mavis thinks she has got it all and return to Mercury, Wisconsin to bring back her ex flame Buddy ( Patrick Wilson), who is now happily married and a father. After some awkward moments, the final embarrassment for Mavis come at the baby naming party. This film makes you feel bad and does offer hope, halfhearted at best at the end. Charlize Theron takes on her role to a new level and it is nice to see in form after Monster. What works in the film is the capturing of small town America and its people who seem to idolize Mavis because they think she has made it and the unexpected friendship that develops between Mavis and Matt ( Patton Oswalt), a former schoolmate and the victim of a hate crime.

This movie I would not need to see again, because the drama is just so cringeworthy.Charlize Theron plays this part well, although it just seemed too easy for her to project, maybe she knows what its like to be popular and fawned over for her looks.This movie actually earns an extra star because of Patton Oswalt! Who knew Patton could be so heartbreakingly good, and every part of it was believable, especially the scene where he has to take his shirt off and he crosses his arms.All in all I wouldnt recommend this film for the casual moviegoer, only people who can appreciate subtlety, a dark film, and maybe Patton Oswalt fans (but certainly not for Ratatouille)",3,3.5 Stars for this Drama,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,1072,"['movie', 'comedy', 'really', 'not', 'find', 'main', 'character', 'drunken', 'ramblings', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'seduction', 'funny', 'only', 'parts', 'found', 'funny', 'were', 'short', 'interactions', 'certain', 'hotel', 'clerk.That', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'certainly', 'was', 'different', 'then', 'say', 'Romy', 'Michelle', 'High', 'School', 'Reunion', 'Romy', 'Michelle', 'was', 'funny', 'rewatchability', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'need', 'see', 'again', 'drama', 'just', 'so', 'cringeworthy.Charlize', 'Theron', 'part', 'well', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'easy', 'project', 'maybe', 'what', 'like', 'be', 'popular', 'fawned', 'looks.This', 'movie', 'actually', 'extra', 'star', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'Who', 'knew', 'Patton', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'heartbreakingly', 'good', 'part', 'was', 'believable', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'take', 'shirt', 'off', 'arms.All', 'wouldnt', 'recommend', 'film', 'casual', 'moviegoer', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'subtlety', 'dark', 'film', 'maybe', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'fans', 'certainly', 'not', 'Ratatouille']",Young Adult
1458670,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005FITIK0,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 8]","Mavis Gary is a mess.  She is permanently sixteen.  She drinks herself to sleep while watching the Kardashian empire grow and she walks around oblivious to her own obscurity by convincing herself that she's somehow important.  She escaped small down life by moving to the Mini-Apple and she's never looked back once.  She writes a `dead in the water' YA series that is rounding the corner of completion and she thinks anything that isn't manufactured by media propaganda is `gross'.  She leans on her own crutch, a crutch created by a self-loathing she won't confront and enabled by those who loath themselves and will admit it (the little people are obsessed with her).  Like I said, she's a mess.In `Young Adult', former stripper and Oscar winner Diablo Cody crafts a sharply focused dissection of a woman who refused to grow up and who insists that she's above everyone else.`Young Adult' is a simple prose.  Mavis finds out that her high school sweetheart has become a new father just as she is being hit with her deadline for her final book.  Suffering from severe writer's block she heads to her home town to see the new baby and hopefully steal her ex back from his wife.  In the process she reconnects with an equally lost soul who becomes a voice of reason to the misguided Mavis.If only she'd listen.There is no fat here.  This film is sharp and to the point and just `gets it'.  Charlize is hilarious yet with a purpose.  You can see the dramatic weight of her past life haunting her current motives.  She nails this performance; possibly the best of her career.  Comedian Patton Oswalt is also flawless here.  The way that he embodies his character, Matt, with the right amount of self-pity is brilliantly colored.  He's believable; sad and lonely yet seemingly stable.  Yet again, Patrick Wilson is nothing more than a pretty prop (does NO ONE IN HOLLYWOOD RESPECT HIS OBVIOUS TALENT?????) but it doesn't fault the film since he needed to be that in order for this to work.Great film, great central performances; I'm ashamed that the Academy didn't bite!",5,Trim the fat...,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,2067,"['Mavis', 'Gary', 'mess', 'permanently', 'sixteen', 'sleep', 'watching', 'Kardashian', 'empire', 'grow', 'walks', 'around', 'oblivious', 'own', 'obscurity', 'convincing', 'somehow', 'important', 'escaped', 'small', 'down', 'life', 'moving', 'Mini-Apple', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'once', 'dead', 'water', 'YA', 'series', 'rounding', 'corner', 'completion', 'anything', ""n't"", 'manufactured', 'media', 'propaganda', 'gross', 'own', 'crutch', 'crutch', 'created', 'self-loathing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'confront', 'enabled', 'who', 'loath', 'will', 'admit', 'little', 'people', 'are', 'obsessed', 'said', 'mess.In', 'Young', 'Adult', 'former', 'stripper', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'sharply', 'focused', 'dissection', 'woman', 'who', 'refused', 'grow', 'up', 'who', 'everyone', 'else.', 'Young', 'Adult', 'simple', 'prose', 'Mavis', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'become', 'new', 'father', 'just', 'being', 'hit', 'deadline', 'final', 'book', 'Suffering', 'severe', 'writer', 'block', 'home', 'town', 'see', 'new', 'baby', 'hopefully', 'steal', 'ex', 'back', 'wife', 'process', 'equally', 'lost', 'soul', 'who', 'voice', 'reason', 'misguided', 'Mavis.If', 'only', ""'d"", 'listen.There', 'fat', 'here', 'film', 'sharp', 'point', 'just', 'Charlize', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'purpose', 'can', 'see', 'dramatic', 'weight', 'past', 'life', 'haunting', 'current', 'motives', 'performance', 'possibly', 'best', 'career', 'Comedian', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'also', 'flawless', 'here', 'way', 'character', 'Matt', 'right', 'amount', 'self-pity', 'brilliantly', 'colored', 'believable', 'sad', 'lonely', 'yet', 'seemingly', 'stable', 'again', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'nothing', 'more', 'pretty', 'prop', 'ONE', 'IN', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'RESPECT', 'HIS', 'OBVIOUS', 'TALENT', ""n't"", 'fault', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'order', 'work.Great', 'film', 'great', 'central', 'performances', ""'m"", 'ashamed', 'Academy', 'did', ""n't"", 'bite']",Young Adult

Her character is so unlikeable, yet realistic, and despite her horrible personality you can't help feeling sorry for her.At the age of 37 author Mavis Gary finds that she has hit a wall. Her young adult series has been cancelled, she's divorced and clearly suffering from depression. She self-medicates with alcohol and fast food, and comes up with a ""brilliant"" plan to win back her high school boyfriend Buddy - not because she never got over him but because he is associated with the happiest time in her life when she was popular and admired by all.That should tell you a lot about the type of person Mavis is. Shallow, spoiled and vain, she is unprepared when life doesn't go her way. Instead of dealing with disappointment like an actual adult and growing from it she tries to relive the past. Sadly for her though her journey back to her home town only makes her unhappier. She can't believe that the people she grew up with could be so content with so little while someone as fabulous as her is unfulfilled. She especially despises Buddy's sweet wife, a woman who is the opposite of her in every way, but who Buddy adores.When she stumbles upon Matt, one of the losers from her high school that she wouldn't have deigned to speak to back then they form an unlikely friendship. Matt is permanently damaged from a violent attack in high school, and his sarcasm and raw honesty are exactly what Mavis needs. He shows her the dark side of the high school world that she longs to return to, and even manages to get a few glimmers of humanity from her. It's not enough to prevent her spiral into self-destruction and there is no neat ending where she learns the errors of her ways because it's not that kind of movie (I wanted to punch Matt's sister when she tells her she doesn't need to change). I know some people don't believe it's a comedy but I did find it very funny in a dark way. It was also extremely cringe-inducing and at times I couldn't bear to watch.

I don't want to spoil the film for anyone but I will mention how heartbreaking it is to watch a person struggle beyond her means to even comfort herself. There is no transformation, no salvation, things do not get better. It is not hopeful, and does not pretend to leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling.

Their past hit film was the quirky, teenage comedy, melodrama JUNO which I enjoyed but found to be, for myself, a bit too cutesy and overly lovable in both the story and the dialogue. Now, with their second film YOUNG ADULT, it provides evidence that JUNO was not just a fluke.  These two continue to provide concrete evidence that they are great at what they do.This film's dialogue is dark, ironic and completely unpredictable. The story is offbeat and quirky yet somehow identifiable. Charlize Theron is brilliant as the one time high school popular girl who, now in her mid thirties, has spiraled downhill and is clutching on to her illustrious past by writing a series of teenage girl novels. Patton Oswalt steals the show as the awkward, geeky guy who had a crush on Theron in high school and, because of a tragic bullying experience, is now handicapped. They play off each others fears and quirks with hilarious and sometimes poignant outcomes. On the outside they seem like complete opposites but are more similar than either one wants to admit.After receiving an e-mail announcing the birth of a baby by her high school sweetheart and his wife, Theron decides that this is the most opportune time to return to her hometown and ""rescue him"" from an ordinary life as a husband and father and to rekindle the romance they had in high school and college.  Her ex-boyfriend is played by Patrick Wilson and he, along with the audience, is taken off guard when Theron returns and acts as if he had been waiting for her all this time.I won't say any more except that this film is really unique and outlandish but also very deep and complex with a showstopping scene near the end that finally brings some answers to her odd and unorthodox behavior.

This is a character study. We are not necessarily here to be made to feel good or to like the characters. We are here to judge whether or not they strike any chord of reality. And they certainly do. Charlize Theron is one of today's better actors and she scores a home run here as a post-college loser who tries to go back home to her small town and steal her old boyfriend away from his happy life and wife and baby. Along the way, she teams with a crippled high school guy who she never even looked at in high school. But today they are young adults, and their lives have taken somewhat dark turns. There's a lot of humor here, but the dull among us won't get it.

1458691,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B005FITIK0,California Dreaming,"[4, 4]","I just got pinged by Amazon - a web site in which you might be familiar - that recommended the movie ""Young Adult,"" most likely based upon my previous ratings.  Well, I've already seen it and I really liked it.  So to Amazon I would say, ""Better late than never"" but it made me want to rate it.Now, Charlize Theron is not just another pretty face.  She proves that over and over, and if you disagree with me, just watch ""Monster.""  (Yikes.  While her performance was maybe too good in that film since she was the spitting image of the serial killer she played, she surely couldn't be called ""attractive"" in that film.  Must have required some great makeup work and incredible acting.  A big recommendation by me on that film as well, however.)  But in real life, if you took Ms. Theron's looks away she would still get work, and that's what I would call an actress.But she also has terrific range.  ""Devil's Advocate,"" where she plays the confused housewife where her life is falling apart.  ""Monster,"" just mentioned.  ""Hancock,"" where her performance - and the movie itself - was highly underrated.  ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" where she played the meanest person in history.  And then ""Young Adult,"" where she plays a completely unsympathetic character, but paradoxically one that you still care about for some reason.  (Can't quite explain why or how this is possible, but it just is.  At least to me.  Maybe it was her acting?  Maybe it was because she gets humiliated at one point and you understand her pain?  Who knows?)Now, we haven't even talked about Patton Oswalt yet.  He is pitch-perfect here, a guy that for some reason understands the Ms. Theron character, and maybe even cares about her.  Perhaps he's looking at it from the same perspective as the audience?  Maybe he's just looking for someone to hang out with and drink home-grown whiskey?A pretty big recommendation from me on ""Young Adult.""

Buddy is inconveniently (or conveniently?) married to a non-blonde named Beth. Buddy and Beth just had a baby, something they for some unexplained reason want Mavis to know.Mavis calls and talks with Buddy while he is busy freezing fresh breast milk, generated thankfully, off camera. The fact that he does this so expertly while talking on a cell phone shows how comfortable he is with his new role of husband and father. Why he would want Mavis back in his life is not explained until much later in the film.Encouraged by his invitation to attend the naming ceremony for the new baby, Mavis avoids her editor and drives back to Mercury, Minnesota, where she grew up and which was the scene of her glory days.Mavis whips out her laptop periodically to work on her current book, the last one apparently, as the series is being canceled. You can just spend so many years in high school, I guess. Mavis stays current with teen dialog by eavesdropping on strangers. She does not appear to have any friends.Mavis is a slob and an alcoholic, but we root for her as she takes out her wiglet and primps herself for Buddy. She cleans up surprisingly well for a woman who has a nervous habit of pulling out her hair.  What she sees in Buddy is hard to imagine. He is almost forty and still has lunch with his father everyday.Avoiding the fact that this whole episode could just as easliy have occurred during an alcohol fueled dream, what if the roles were recast?What if Mavis became Marvin, a writer of, say, graphic novels, or video games (no, too hip, let&#8217;s stick with graphic novels). We would watch as Marvin whips out his toupee and primp wildly to look good for someone he knew as a teenager, a woman who is now a Mom in her thirties who stores breast milk in the freezer.The creep factor would escalate to slasher movie levels, and this story would no longer fit uncomfortably into the romantic comedy genre.",4,The creep factor,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,2276,"['8220', 'Sour', 'vinegar', 'popsicle', '8221', 'what', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'movie.It', 'also', 'movie', 'brave', 'breathtaking.Which', 'course', 'viewer', 'along', 'ride', 'Mavis', '37', 'year-old', 'woman', 'who', 'living', 'ghostwriting', 'teen', 'novels', 'tries', 'redirect', 'aimless', 'life', 'connecting', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Buddy', 'Buddy', 'inconveniently', 'conveniently', 'married', 'non-blonde', 'named', 'Beth', 'Buddy', 'Beth', 'just', 'had', 'baby', 'something', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'want', 'Mavis', 'know.Mavis', 'calls', 'talks', 'Buddy', 'busy', 'freezing', 'fresh', 'breast', 'milk', 'generated', 'thankfully', 'off', 'camera', 'fact', 'so', 'expertly', 'talking', 'cell', 'phone', 'how', 'comfortable', 'new', 'role', 'husband', 'father', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'Mavis', 'back', 'life', 'not', 'explained', 'much', 'later', 'film.Encouraged', 'invitation', 'attend', 'naming', 'ceremony', 'new', 'baby', 'Mavis', 'editor', 'back', 'Mercury', 'Minnesota', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'was', 'scene', 'glory', 'days.Mavis', 'out', 'laptop', 'periodically', 'work', 'current', 'book', 'last', 'one', 'apparently', 'series', 'being', 'canceled', 'can', 'just', 'spend', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'guess', 'Mavis', 'current', 'teen', 'dialog', 'eavesdropping', 'strangers', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'friends.Mavis', 'slob', 'alcoholic', 'root', 'out', 'wiglet', 'primps', 'Buddy', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'woman', 'who', 'nervous', 'habit', 'pulling', 'out', 'hair', 'What', 'Buddy', 'hard', 'imagine', 'almost', 'forty', 'still', 'lunch', 'father', 'everyday.Avoiding', 'fact', 'whole', 'episode', 'could', 'just', 'easliy', 'have', 'occurred', 'alcohol', 'fueled', 'dream', 'what', 'roles', 'were', 'recast', 'What', 'Mavis', 'became', 'Marvin', 'writer', 'say', 'graphic', 'novels', 'video', 'games', 'too', 'hip', 'let', '8217', 'stick', 'graphic', 'novels', 'would', 'watch', 'Marvin', 'out', 'toupee', 'primp', 'wildly', 'look', 'good', 'someone', 'knew', 'teenager', 'woman', 'who', 'now', 'Mom', 'thirties', 'who', 'stores', 'breast', 'milk', 'freezer.The', 'creep', 'factor', 'would', 'escalate', 'slasher', 'movie', 'levels', 'story', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'fit', 'uncomfortably', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre']",Young Adult

It also makes some subtle points about the most youth-obsessed, immature aspects of today's culture.  (It's no coincidence the main character constantly watches reality TV and writes young adult novels - there's even a veiled reference to Twilight at one point, that teen phenomenon that became curiously popular with adults.)Enter 37-year-old Mavis, once the prettiest and most popular girl in her high school.  Years later, Mavis still has the mentality of a lazy, snotty and self-obsessed adolescent . . . along with a drinking problem, depression, anxiety, and a foundering career as fiction writer.Mavis learns her high school boyfriend, Buddy, has had a baby with his wife.  Nostalgia for her glory days drives Mavis to hatch a ridiculous plan - return to her Minnesota hometown to ""save"" Buddy (who hasn't seen her in years) from his boring suburban existence.Once in town, Mavis runs into sarcastic former classmate, Matt - because every queen bee needs someone to listen to her talk about herself, Mavis strikes up a sort of friendship with Matt.  Matt still lives at home, immersed in his hobbies like the lonely, unpopular teen he once was.  A  severe beating by bullies in high school left him disabled - Matt is frozen in time due to tragedy, while Mavis is stuck because she peaked in high school.  While Matt sees Mavis for the lonely mess she is, Mavis is too deluded to realize how much they have in common.Theron and Oswalt are absolutely perfect in their roles. Mavis and Matt are extreme examples, but their malaise will strike a chord with anyone who ever struggled to become a grown-up, or wished they could recapture the promise of youth.Word to the wise: this isn't really a comedy, though it has some brilliant moments of dialogue.",4,Brilliant and biting,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,1883,"['movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'sharp', 'melancholy', 'tale', 'lost', 'youth', 'arrested', 'development', 'also', 'subtle', 'points', 'most', 'youth-obsessed', 'immature', 'aspects', 'today', 'culture', 'coincidence', 'main', 'character', 'constantly', 'reality', 'TV', 'young', 'adult', 'novels', 'even', 'veiled', 'reference', 'Twilight', 'one', 'point', 'teen', 'phenomenon', 'became', 'curiously', 'popular', 'adults', 'Enter', '37-year-old', 'Mavis', 'once', 'prettiest', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'Years', 'later', 'Mavis', 'still', 'mentality', 'lazy', 'snotty', 'self-obsessed', 'adolescent', 'drinking', 'problem', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'foundering', 'career', 'fiction', 'writer.Mavis', 'high', 'school', 'boyfriend', 'Buddy', 'had', 'baby', 'wife', 'Nostalgia', 'glory', 'days', 'Mavis', 'hatch', 'ridiculous', 'plan', 'return', 'Minnesota', 'hometown', 'save', 'Buddy', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'boring', 'suburban', 'existence.Once', 'town', 'Mavis', 'sarcastic', 'former', 'classmate', 'Matt', 'queen', 'bee', 'someone', 'listen', 'talk', 'herself', 'Mavis', 'up', 'sort', 'friendship', 'Matt', 'Matt', 'still', 'home', 'immersed', 'hobbies', 'lonely', 'unpopular', 'teen', 'once', 'was', 'severe', 'beating', 'bullies', 'high', 'school', 'left', 'disabled', 'Matt', 'frozen', 'time', 'due', 'tragedy', 'Mavis', 'stuck', 'peaked', 'high', 'school', 'Matt', 'Mavis', 'lonely', 'mess', 'Mavis', 'too', 'deluded', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'common.Theron', 'Oswalt', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Mavis', 'Matt', 'are', 'extreme', 'examples', 'malaise', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'struggled', 'become', 'grown-up', 'wished', 'could', 'recapture', 'promise', 'youth.Word', 'wise', ""n't"", 'really', 'comedy', 'brilliant', 'moments', 'dialogue']",Young Adult

1458705,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005FITIK0,C. Sawin,"[5, 9]","Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody have been kind of hit or miss for me or at least that's what I like to think. I didn't enjoy Juno nearly as much as everyone else seemed to while Jennifer's Body, while not great, may have been better received on my end than what most give it credit for mostly because I have such a soft spot for horror. On the other hand though, Up in the Air was fairly fantastic all around. With that said, the main thing attracting me to Young Adult was the fact that Patton Oswalt had a rather big supporting role. Despite the fact that Charlize Theron has done so many things since and has won an Oscar, films like The Astronaut's Wife and The Devil's Advocate only come to mind whenever she's featured in anything which isn't flattering at all. So there was kind of this sense of dread going into Young Adult, but was it justified? The short answer is no, but it doesn't completely blow you away either.There was an Entertainment Weekly article a few weeks ago where Theron said she aimed to not only be a mean-spirited individual, but also easily relatable as well. That's the trickiest part with a character like this. Anyone can be cold or act black hearted, but doing that while also displaying qualities that make you feel sorry for them and/or feel like something you went through in your life is something special. Imagining anyone else in this role is practically impossible, as well. The entire premise seems to be built around Theron. She seems to be playing herself or at least a slightly exaggerated version of how she is in real life. That more than likely contributes to the movie working as well as it does.One of the other great things about the movie is that it's mostly unexpected. Young adult fiction writer Mavis Gary (Theron) currently lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota but decides to return to her small hometown of Mercury after receiving an email from her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) welcoming his first child into the world. Mavis somehow thinks that her and Buddy are meant to be together and despite Buddy being happily married and having a daughter that he loves dearly, Mavis thinks they can work past that to make things right between them. The outcome of the events is probably pretty predictable, but the relationships in between unfold in a way that you probably don't see coming. I'm mostly referring to Mavis and Matt Freehauf's (Patton Oswalt) friendship as it goes in a direction that feels far too human for such a superficial individual like Mavis. Oswalt also seems to be playing an exaggerated version of himself as well as he makes full use of his geekiness. The Pixies shirt was also a nice touch. But Young Adult is mostly entertaining due to the way it feels genuine despite revolving around somebody who is as harsh and selfish as Mavis Gray is.Young Adult is very dark and downright bleak at times, but that's one of its most distinguishing traits. You'll more than likely find something to relate to in Mavis Gray whether it was you who was the popular kid in school, are just as depressed as she is, think you may be an alcoholic, or you're a writer, Mavis isn't really in the right frame of mind and maybe that's the most relatable part of her character. Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt share a kind of twisted chemistry that involves some fairly witty dialogue at times, but is mostly them dragging the other one through the mud with their words, which strangely only illustrates how miserable and similar their two characters are. Young Adult is a very fascinating dark comedy that is laugh out loud funny at times due to its cruelness, but shines thanks to its authenticity.",3,Feels genuine,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,3671,"['Jason', 'Reitman', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'have', 'been', 'kind', 'hit', 'miss', 'least', 'what', 'like', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Juno', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'seemed', 'Jennifer', 'Body', 'not', 'great', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'received', 'end', 'what', 'most', 'give', 'credit', 'mostly', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'horror', 'other', 'hand', 'Up', 'Air', 'was', 'fairly', 'fantastic', 'around', 'said', 'main', 'thing', 'attracting', 'Young', 'Adult', 'was', 'fact', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'had', 'rather', 'big', 'supporting', 'role', 'fact', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'won', 'Oscar', 'films', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'only', 'come', 'mind', 'whenever', 'featured', 'anything', ""n't"", 'flattering', 'was', 'kind', 'sense', 'dread', 'going', 'Young', 'Adult', 'was', 'justified', 'short', 'answer', ""n't"", 'completely', 'blow', 'away', 'was', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'article', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'where', 'Theron', 'said', 'aimed', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'mean-spirited', 'individual', 'also', 'easily', 'relatable', 'well', 'trickiest', 'part', 'character', 'Anyone', 'can', 'be', 'cold', 'act', 'black', 'hearted', 'doing', 'also', 'displaying', 'qualities', 'make', 'feel', 'sorry', 'and/or', 'feel', 'something', 'went', 'life', 'something', 'special', 'Imagining', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'practically', 'impossible', 'as', 'well', 'entire', 'premise', 'be', 'built', 'Theron', 'be', 'playing', 'least', 'slightly', 'exaggerated', 'version', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'more', 'likely', 'movie', 'working', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'great', 'things', 'movie', 'mostly', 'unexpected', 'Young', 'adult', 'fiction', 'writer', 'Mavis', 'Gary', 'Theron', 'currently', 'Minneapolis', 'Minnesota', 'return', 'small', 'hometown', 'Mercury', 'receiving', 'email', 'high', 'school', 'boyfriend', 'Buddy', 'Slade', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'welcoming', 'first', 'child', 'world', 'Mavis', 'somehow', 'Buddy', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'together', 'Buddy', 'being', 'happily', 'married', 'having', 'daughter', 'dearly', 'Mavis', 'can', 'work', 'past', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'outcome', 'events', 'probably', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'relationships', 'unfold', 'way', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', ""'m"", 'mostly', 'referring', 'Mavis', 'Matt', 'Freehauf', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'friendship', 'direction', 'far', 'too', 'human', 'superficial', 'individual', 'Mavis', 'Oswalt', 'also', 'be', 'playing', 'exaggerated', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'full', 'use', 'geekiness', 'Pixies', 'shirt', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'touch', 'Young', 'Adult', 'mostly', 'entertaining', 'due', 'way', 'genuine', 'revolving', 'somebody', 'who', 'harsh', 'selfish', 'Mavis', 'Gray', 'is.Young', 'Adult', 'very', 'dark', 'downright', 'bleak', 'times', 'one', 'most', 'distinguishing', 'traits', ""'ll"", 'more', 'likely', 'find', 'something', 'relate', 'Mavis', 'Gray', 'was', 'who', 'was', 'popular', 'kid', 'school', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'depressed', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'alcoholic', ""'re"", 'writer', 'Mavis', ""n't"", 'really', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'maybe', 'most', 'relatable', 'part', 'character', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'share', 'kind', 'twisted', 'chemistry', 'fairly', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'times', 'mostly', 'dragging', 'other', 'one', 'mud', 'words', 'strangely', 'only', 'how', 'miserable', 'similar', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'Young', 'Adult', 'very', 'fascinating', 'dark', 'comedy', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'times', 'due', 'cruelness', 'shines', 'thanks', 'authenticity']",Young Adult

Aware of the depression she is sinking into (but not exactly of how far into it she's already gone), Mavis thinks of the happiest time of her life: when she was in high school, dating the popular boy, Buddy Slade.  Despite the fact that Buddy has a wife and new child, Mavis heads back to the small town of Mercury to reclaim the lost days of her youth.It's a basic, even boring premise, yet Jason Reitman's YOUNG ADULT captures the complexities of depression/self-discovery perfectly, ripe with all the awkward moments, self-loathing, and even humor that goes along with it.  To call YOUNG ADULT a comedy would be doing it a disservice, as it is far more than that: it's an intricate, layered character study, anchored by Charlize Theron's lead performance.  That Theron wasn't even nominated for a Best Actress Oscar is almost a tragedy; the same can be said for Patton Oswalt, who goes from stand-up comedic to dramatic actor as the flip-side of Mavis: a kid who was largely ignored, even picked on, with tragic results.  Theron and Oswalt give deep, mesmerizing performances; also strong are Patrick Wilson (a grossly-underused actor) as Buddy, and Elizabeth Reaser as his wife.  Reitman, as usual, handles his actors perfectly, working from another solid script by Diablo Cody.

Some of them seem to be merely because the viewers were expecting a typical romcom or other ""lite"" romp, but with the exception of misleading trailers, I don't think the movie should be blamed for that. There are, indeed, cringe-worthy scenes in this film, but there are also laugh-out-loud moments. But what I really enjoyed was that there was no moralizing - the viewer is free to take away from the experience what they will. Mavis is not a terribly sympathetic character, but neither is she always wrong. When she attacks Patton Oswalt's character for letting his past define his life, she's being hypocritical in the extreme, but also perceptive. Her belief that suburban, married life can be a prison sentence is not entirely unjustified, either. But the real issue at hand is that her high school sweetheart has actively participated in his life, making choices that suit him, while she has been swept along, helpless. Mavis has a life - she just can't recognize it as such because it's happened TO her rather than being created BY her. And for a lot of us, that probably hits too close to home. Even when you think you're the one making the decisions, it's not uncommon to wake up in your late-30's, early 40's and say, ""How the heck did I end up here?""

1458710,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B005FITIK0,David Baldwin,"[7, 10]","I'm going to the matresses for ""Young Adult"".  I don't understand the plethora of negative reaction to it.  This is one of the best movies of last year.  Mavis Gary(Charlize Theron) is a thirty-seven year old writer of unfashionable teen fiction who emotionally hasn't escaped high school which kind of explains her occupation of choice.  She receives an e-mail from her high school beau, Buddy(Patrick Wilson), announcing the birth of his child.  Mavis surmises that Buddy wants to rekindle their former flame even though he is married with a newborn.  Is she on to something or deluded?  Regardless she hightails it to the Minneapolis suburb she grew up in to reunite with Buddy.  While there she encounters Matt(Patton Oswalt), a gnomish man who was crippled by some jocks in high school and scarred for life, who she didn't give the time of day.  During this visit Matt serves as the unlikely conscience and confidante to Mavis.  Theron is nothing short of stupendous here.  She conveys the complexities of Mavis-the narcissism, the vanity, the self-hatred, and the depressiveness.  Oswalt is every bit Theron's equal giving depth to what could have been a cliched character.  One of the more tender scenes I've seen in years is one towards the end of the film between Mavis and Matt.  Jason Reitman is proving with this and previous work to be a humanistic director.  Diablo Cody is also one of the better scribes as she crafts a script here that is colorfully detailed and nuanced.  One of my favorite scenes in the movie is where Mavis is at a bookstore attempting to sign one of her books designated for clearance.  The bookseller exhorts her not to because he tells her they can't return damaged merchandise to the publisher.  I think the film failed to find it's audience because it was promoted as straight comedy when in reality it is drama with comedic elements.  I think, too, that even though you're not supposed to like Mavis the makers of ""Young Adult"" take the leap that you will at least sympathize with her.",5,Can The Bad Reviews.

1458720,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B005FITIK0,Douglas King,"[13, 15]","When watching ""Young Adult"", I couldn't help but think of this year's ""Bad Teacher"". The two films have a similar central character: an aging former ""Queen Bee"", still beautiful, but also still stuck in adolescent, immature delusions about how her life should be (as well as a penchant for substance abuse). However, while ""Bad Teacher"" was a low-brow, lightweight comedy, ""Young Adult"" aims much higher, and although it has moments of humor, is a serious and often painful character study.Mavis left her small town home of Mercury to move to Minneapolis, where she has had a fairly successful career as a writer of young adult fiction. In her personal life, she has become isolated and lonely, filling up her time with excessive drinking and one-night-stands. When she receives an email notice that her former high school sweetheart, Buddy, had recently become a father, she develops a bizarre and unlikely plan to go back to her home town and win him back.And so it begins. Although affable Buddy is happy to meet Mavis for a friendly drink, he is clearly content with his life as a husband (to a fun and compassionate woman) and new father, and has no romantic interest in Mavis. Clueless, Mavis continues her pursuit of Buddy, believing that the two are meant to be together and that he secretly feels trapped in his small town life. The more Mavis continues her pursuit, the more she humiliates herself, revealing her immaturity and desperation.While staying in Mercury, Mavis does also make a genuine connection to Matt, a former classmate still physically crippled by a brutal attack in high school. Despite superficial differences the two have a lot in common: they're both stuck, unable to move on from the past, and share a love of excessive drinking. Matt, as disappointed and angry as Mavis, is probably the only person in the film to tell her the truth about herself.Charlize Theron gives a terrific, nuanced performance, and is willing to explore her character at both as her most humorous and bitchy as well as at her most pathetic and pitiful. And Patrick Wilson and Patton Oswold both create fleshed out human beings out of characters who could have easily been two dimensional.

1458721,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B005FITIK0,Ed Uyeshima,"[10, 16]","Without an iota of irony, Charlize Theron finally uses her intimidating beauty for pure Machiavellian evil, and the results are fortuitous in this dark-hued 2011 comedy, the latest collaboration of director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody (Juno). She's absolutely spot-on terrific playing Mavis Gary, the condescending, hateful high school girl who comes back to Mercury, her podunk hometown nearly two decades later. Mavis is no Blanche Dubois-type character whose ladylike beauty has faded into a gauzy romantic delusion. No, Mavis is still one hot babe and very much the complete narcissist she was as a teenager, emotionally stunted despite her relative worldliness having moved to Minneapolis to become a ghostwriter of a series of teen novels.It's not surprising she finds success writing for an adolescent audience since she still defines her life with teenage-level priorities and fantasies. As she has proven withJuno, Cody is thoroughly fluent with this perspective, but the twist is that this time, it's coming from a jaded 37-year-old woman. Even though Mavis is a divorcee who lives in a high-rise apartment with a toy dog and can easily get any man she wants, she is triggered by a birth announcement email she receives from her high school sweetheart Buddy Slade and becomes fixated on getting him back all these years later. It doesn't matter that he's happily married and perfectly content living in Mercury. She concocts a scheme to make herself so alluring that he will want to run away with her. Normally, this would be an excuse for broad comedy machinations, but Theron is so gorgeous that it makes her shameless attempts at seduction look all the more edgily desperate.It's a narrowly developed plot for sure, but surprisingly, what enriches the proceedings is the unexpected relationship Mavis develops with Matt Freehauf, a sad-sack former classmate whose sole claim to notoriety was being the victim of a hate crime when he was beaten up and left for dead by a group of jocks who assumed he was gay. Now crippled physically and emotionally, he lives in Mercury with his sister making his own home-brewed bourbon and putting together mix-and-match action figures. That Mavis and Matt connect is all the more intriguing since they were at opposite ends of the social spectrum back in school, and their bond is fueled by her obvious alcoholism, a point that is overlooked by her befuddled parents who wish to think of Mavis as the flawless pretty daughter of their own deluded fantasies. The story evolves in the direction you would expect but not before certain revelations come to light in a tortuous scene at the baby-naming party Buddy and his sensible wife Beth have with all their relatives and close friends in attendance.Beyond Theron's fearless work and intentionally deadpan line delivery, there is comedian Patton Oswalt's surprisingly affecting performance as Matt. I only know him from his recurring role as a comical sad-sack on the sitcomKing of Queens, so it's surprising to see the amount of texture he brings to this role. As Buddy, Patrick Wilson once again plays the sought-after himbo, but this time, his character's unshaven, small-town modesty comes across as more contrite with his character's feelings toward Mavis left quite elliptical. Elizabeth Reaser (Sweet Land) isn't given that much to do as Beth, probably by intention, but Collette Wolf has a few impactful moments as Matt's insulated sister still idolizing Mavis after all these years. As he showed withJunoandUp in the Air, Reitman shows a deft hand with actors playing flawed characters who try to manipulate their circumstances but fall short of their vaunted expectations.",4,Theron Delivers the Goods as the Unrepentant Queen of Small-Town Mean,1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,3695,"['iota', 'irony', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'finally', 'intimidating', 'beauty', 'pure', 'Machiavellian', 'evil', 'results', 'are', 'fortuitous', 'dark-hued', '2011', 'comedy', 'latest', 'collaboration', 'director', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'screenwriter', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'Juno', 'absolutely', 'spot-on', 'terrific', 'playing', 'Mavis', 'Gary', 'condescending', 'hateful', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'who', 'back', 'Mercury', 'podunk', 'hometown', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'Mavis', 'Blanche', 'Dubois-type', 'character', 'ladylike', 'beauty', 'faded', 'gauzy', 'romantic', 'delusion', 'No', 'Mavis', 'still', 'one', 'hot', 'babe', 'very', 'much', 'complete', 'narcissist', 'was', 'teenager', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'relative', 'worldliness', 'having', 'moved', 'Minneapolis', 'become', 'ghostwriter', 'series', 'teen', 'novels.It', 'not', 'surprising', 'success', 'writing', 'adolescent', 'audience', 'still', 'life', 'teenage-level', 'priorities', 'fantasies', 'proven', 'withJuno', 'Cody', 'thoroughly', 'fluent', 'perspective', 'twist', 'time', 'coming', 'jaded', '37-year-old', 'woman', 'Even', 'Mavis', 'divorcee', 'who', 'high-rise', 'apartment', 'toy', 'dog', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'man', 'triggered', 'birth', 'announcement', 'email', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Buddy', 'Slade', 'becomes', 'fixated', 'getting', 'back', 'years', 'later', ""n't"", 'matter', 'happily', 'married', 'perfectly', 'content', 'living', 'Mercury', 'scheme', 'make', 'so', 'alluring', 'will', 'want', 'run', 'away', 'Normally', 'would', 'be', 'excuse', 'broad', 'comedy', 'machinations', 'Theron', 'so', 'gorgeous', 'shameless', 'attempts', 'seduction', 'look', 'more', 'edgily', 'desperate.It', 'narrowly', 'developed', 'plot', 'sure', 'surprisingly', 'what', 'proceedings', 'unexpected', 'relationship', 'Mavis', 'Matt', 'Freehauf', 'sad-sack', 'former', 'classmate', 'sole', 'claim', 'notoriety', 'was', 'being', 'victim', 'hate', 'crime', 'when', 'was', 'beaten', 'up', 'left', 'dead', 'group', 'jocks', 'who', 'assumed', 'was', 'gay', 'Now', 'crippled', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'Mercury', 'sister', 'making', 'own', 'home-brewed', 'bourbon', 'putting', 'together', 'mix-and-match', 'action', 'figures', 'Mavis', 'Matt', 'connect', 'more', 'intriguing', 'were', 'opposite', 'ends', 'social', 'spectrum', 'back', 'school', 'bond', 'fueled', 'obvious', 'alcoholism', 'point', 'overlooked', 'befuddled', 'parents', 'who', 'wish', 'think', 'Mavis', 'flawless', 'pretty', 'daughter', 'own', 'deluded', 'fantasies', 'story', 'direction', 'would', 'expect', 'not', 'certain', 'revelations', 'come', 'light', 'tortuous', 'scene', 'baby-naming', 'party', 'Buddy', 'sensible', 'wife', 'Beth', 'have', 'relatives', 'close', 'friends', 'attendance.Beyond', 'Theron', 'fearless', 'work', 'intentionally', 'deadpan', 'line', 'delivery', 'comedian', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'surprisingly', 'affecting', 'performance', 'Matt', 'only', 'know', 'recurring', 'role', 'comical', 'sad-sack', 'sitcomKing', 'Queens', 'surprising', 'see', 'amount', 'texture', 'role', 'Buddy', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'once', 'again', 'sought-after', 'himbo', 'time', 'character', 'unshaven', 'small-town', 'modesty', 'more', 'contrite', 'character', 'feelings', 'Mavis', 'left', 'quite', 'elliptical', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'Sweet', 'Land', ""n't"", 'given', 'that', 'much', 'do', 'Beth', 'probably', 'intention', 'Collette', 'Wolf', 'few', 'impactful', 'moments', 'Matt', 'insulated', 'sister', 'still', 'idolizing', 'Mavis', 'years', 'showed', 'withJunoandUp', 'Air', 'Reitman', 'deft', 'hand', 'actors', 'playing', 'flawed', 'characters', 'who', 'try', 'manipulate', 'circumstances', 'fall', 'short', 'vaunted', 'expectations']",Young Adult

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[2, 5]","I've long suspected that most Hollywood scriptwriters and directors weren't particularly popular in high school because while there's a ton of movies about outcasts, there are few from the perspective of a Queen Bee or star quarterback.  ""Young Adult,"" while it has flaws, offers a side of the story that rarely gets told in movies.Charlize Theron plays Mavis, a thirty-something whose glory days were in high school, but who managed to escape her boring small town and move to the Big City, where she's a ghost-writer for a young adult novel series.  She's also the envy of a few of her former classmates who believe that she's living a glamorous lifestyle.  This is proven to be inaccurate within the first ten minutes of ""Young Adult,"" in which Theron wakes up from a drunken stupor and shuffles around her apartment groggily feeding her dog and other chores before logging onto her computer.  There she finds that someone's sent her a photo of a newborn whose dad is former flame Buddy (Patrick Wilson).  Because her life is going nowhere, she decides to return home and re-ignite her relationship with Wilson.  After a glimpse into his life of domestic bliss, anyone else would scrap this idea, but Mavis is either a sociopath, mentally ill or pathetically clueless, and besides which, if she didn't, there wouldn't be much of a movie.Mavis' insensitivity can be summed up in her reaction to encountering an old classmate, Patton Oswalt; after hearing the details of a hate crime, which left him permanently disabled in high school, she gets a little green-eyed.  ""You must have missed so much school!"" While the movie has some very funny moments, somehow they don't add up.  This is one of those movies, where you realize that all the witticisms that work were used in the trailer.  Still, I appreciated the fact that the rivalry between Mavis and Wilson's wife, didn't disintegrate into a full-fledged cat fight involving mud wrestling and hair pulling, which is what happened in Kristen Bell's ""You Again.""

She has an eye and ear for interesting characters and comes up with way left of center situations to put them in. This might not be her best but it's still well worth the watch.Here's the scoop. Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) is a ghost writer working on the final installment of a series of books written for young adults. The series has run its course and she doesn't know what she'll do when it's finished. She receives an e-mail announcing the birth of a baby fathered by an old high school flame (Patrick Wilson). She psychotically takes this as a sign she should visit him to rekindle a relationship with him even though he is happily married. She makes the trip and, as one can imagine, screws everything up.This is a character driven movie and Charlize is at the center. She is an alcoholic who cannot seem to get over her glory days as a high school prom queen, who could have had pretty much any guy she wanted. She can't carry on a meaningful conversation and lies incessantly. She has a tiny dog but why? She barely seems able to keep it alive much less fulfilled. She will plot and maneuver to get back with her beau and has deluded herself into thinking he's not happily married. She runs into Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt) with whom she was locker neighbors in high school. Now he's on a crutch after a beating he took at the hands of some jocks who thought, mistakenly, that he was gay. But he lives with his sister and does the things that mean something to him. He builds and paints super hero models, distills bourbon and other things that take his mind off his loneliness. He also doesn't take any crap from Charlize. He lets her know she's screwed up and that what she's doing is crazy and wrong.There's a lot to say about this movie so I'll stop here. This is a very good, very watchable flick. I liked scene after scene. Jason Reitman has been very consistent in his projects and is on the money here. The biggest problem is the ending. It's as though she didn't know where to take the character and just tacked on a totally pat, unbelievable ending. But it's still better than a lot of the stuff out there.

So Mavis invents a new dream for herself-- stealing back her high school boyfriend, now happily married with a baby.  You see, in twenty years Mavis has avoided growing up at all.

Add to this combination an actress of the caliber of Charlize Theron and you end up with one disturbing but excellent film.Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron), left her high school popularity in Mercury, MN to move on to Minneapolis to become a famous ghost writer of Young Adult romances.  Now age (she is now 37 years old), bad divorce, writer's block and alcoholism force her to stare in the mirror, see how she has slipped, and respond to an email birth announcement of a child born to her ex-flame Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) by deciding to return to Mercury and reignite her old passion for the now happily married Buddy.  She crams her tiny pet dog into her carryon, registers at the local motel (the desk is manned by a shrewd Louisa Krause), and is off to find a drink.  She there encounters Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt in a brilliant performance), a high school nobody who suffered massive physical abuse and subsequent permanent damage at the hands of jocks who beat him brutally for being gay (he isn't).  Mavis recognizes Matt, feels sorry for him, and confides in him that she is in town to rekindle her old romance with Buddy.  Despite Matt's warnings that Buddy is off limits Mavis, between bouts of drunken oblivion, fixes her appearance, makes contact with Buddy, is invited to Buddy's home to meet his wife Beth (Elisabeth Reaser) and new daughter, all the while focusing her wiles on seducing Buddy despite all evidence that the affair is dead. She eventually makes a fool of herself and finds her only solace is in Matt and Matt's very plain and bored sister Sandra (Collette Wolfe).  How the trip to Mercury ends is the surprising finale.Charlize Theron is such a fine actress that she is able to find crevices where we can peak into her life and find some love for her despicably ruined Mavis. The entire cast is excellent and includes cameos by Mary Beth Hurt and Jill Eikenberry.  Once again Diablo Cody invites us to look at just what defines `adult' and why so many people stumble on their way to that plateau. At times it is difficult to see the comedy in this film, but stand far enough back and it is the human comedy that we are watching.  Cody, with Reitman, makes that clear.

They sell a movie like it's a mainstream popcorn flick to get the butts in the seats, but then many of those butts are understandably pissed that it's not the formulaic comfortable feel-good comedy they were looking for.  This backfires because it creates instant bad word of mouth, rather than the slow, building, good word of mouth that happens when a film isn't hyped the wrong way and is allowed to find its audience.  So sad that the movie business just can't work that way anymore.  If ""Chinatown"" had come out now, the idiots in the marketing dept would have tried to make the commercials look like ""Basic Instinct.""  Fools.  As far as the movie goes, it's spectacular.

Her acting is great, and the movie was greatly cast. As for the movie, the one word that I can describe Young Adult is: ""realistic"". There's nothing dramatized here, nothing romanticized: we have Mavis (Theron) who hasn't grown up, and is stuck in denial and refuses to believe that she is a failed ""author"". In short, it's a story about a middle aged (possibly mentally insane)woman who hasn't grown up, and makes horrible choices trying to win back her married, high school sweetheart. Then at the end, when she realizes her mistakes, she learns from them and finally transitions from being a young adult to an empathetic, functioning adult.... well, that's where the tragedy sinks in. You root for her to change, to grow up, and to become a better person. But one conversation in the end makes her relapse, and makes us viewers want to smack her in the head, and proclaim that this was a bad movie. But it is because of this, it was a great movie for me.

If you're expecting big laughs, you'll be sorely disappointed since the only comedy here is pretty dark and often cringe-worthy when it arrives. The pathetic nature of the main character and her alcoholic binges make it hard to connect with her since she's routinely narcissistic, spoiled and just plain unlikable all at the same time.But while it doesn't deliver on the comedy front, it's actually a clever and complex observation of a thirty-something trapped in her high school years who just never became an adult. Her practical stalking of an old flame is believable and oddly touching despite being completely inappropriate, and it ends with a satisfying conclusion that fits the setup. The whole thing works because of Patton Oswalt's character who is also stuck in his life because of events at high school but helps lift the otherwise melancholic tone.I think most people will either love this or hate it. It's different to Reitman's other films such as Up in the Air but the same in that there's an undercurrent of malaise, frustration and boredom in his version of American culture.

I don't want to say it was a train-wreck, because that's just too obvious, given that the plot is about a woman who was a trainwreck. Charlize deserves as many awards for this as she does for her other transformative roles, like Monster, and I am on the verge of saying I liked this movie and doing the whole Facebook ""thumbs-up"" routine, but this film distinctly felt like a terrible movie surrounding a hypnotic performance. It is a very detailed character study, much like the film ""Terri,"" and I am sure it will get recognized more than Terri, but the empathy I had for the characters in Terri, I could not quite muster-up for the Young Adult characters. I wanted to laugh more, but the funny angles were all smothered in a sort of uneasiness. I don't think I will be able to fully make up my mind until I see it again, and it was prickly enough the first time, so that might not happen.

1458754,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B005FITIK0,jjceo,"[0, 0]",Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) is a 37 year old author of teen books for young adults. She has been relatively successful but she is faced with writing the last book of the series which spells the end of her writing career as she has experienced it. Most of the books have been a mixture of her past high school glory days modernized on the lingo and ideas she picks up while out in public around younger people.She gets an email from the wife of her old boyfriend in college about the birth of their new baby. She is filled with jealousy and a sense of loss over what might have happened if she had stayed with her old love and married him. Her divorced life and one night pick up dates seems to be a sad comparison to the possible joy she might have had if her and Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) had gotten married.She jumps out of bed from a one night stand and drives back to her old town to get Buddy back and show him what life with her could really be like if he left his wife and child...This is a sad and dark story about an alcoholic middle aged woman who is deeply depressed and she doesn't know how to go on with her life. She wants to relive the glory days of her teen and college years to regain the joys of living. This movie is extremely well acted and Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt who portrays Matt Freehauf do a wonderful job of acting the roles of middle age people still stuck in their younger years.What kills this movie is that it is just such a depressing storyline. There are some parts that are a comedy and Charlize is as hot as usual but the storyline is just downright gloomy about how people can be so miserable with their lives. It is a storyline about human nature but don't expect to watch this movie and feel like laughing.

There are lots of ""nice"" people, but that's hardly the same thing.  And yet, comparing this to The Great Gatsby, I see that we've got the same core concept -- old flame has new babby and ""must be saved"" according to obsessive ex -- but this retelling has more breadth of sincerity than Fitzgerald managed with his over-emphasis on the Leisure Class.  Theron's (and Cody's) rendering of Gatsby is genuinely deranged, and visibly so set in contrast with surroundings from even the first not-glamorous-at-all McDonald's French Fry.  The driving obsession isn't a positive driving character trait, it's a near-fatal flaw.  And while it feels mostly more honest, heartfelt, and creative than Cody's other work (Juno, Jennifer's Body), 90 minutes of scathingly bitter introspection is a bit rough on the system.

It was fun watching her attempts to skew reality in the way that best suited her needs; that's the defining trait of the Mean Girls, after all. Then the pity happens. We see that she's seriously broken under there, and we're expected to feel bad for her. Poor, sad drunk pretty girl. And just when she seems to be at the brink of a genuine breakthrough, she hops back into her broken life and drives away.While I admit that a magical Romey & Michelle redemption for Mavis would have infuriated me, it would've been nice to see that she learned even the slightest bit from her escapade. But the fact is, some people simply don't learn. They peak at 17, then face 60 long years of mediocrity. That's an ugly truth. Some people have their lives utterly ruined at 17 and never quite get over it, and that is also true. So don't expect a quippy, quirky, long overdue hair-pulling for the mean girl 'cause this ain't it.  DO, however, look for brilliant and nuanced performances from both Theron and Oswalt.

1458771,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005FITIK0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","In the latest collaboration between director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody (they gave us ""Juno"" and she won a Screenplay Oscar in the process), our protagonists may be older, but that doesn't make them any wiser. In fact, Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) still resides in the rarefied land where her high school days were the pinnacle of her success. She has an idealized memory of her popularity and perceived true love (Patrick Wilson), so when confronted with the disappointments in her big city existence--she attempts to reclaim some of her former glory. Specifically, she hatches a plot to return to her home town and rescue Wilson from what she believes is his domestic prison--namely a wife (Elizabeth Reaser) and new baby. ""Young Adult"" is marketed as a black comedy, and it certainly has some of the most awkward and uncomfortable humor that you're likely to encounter. But in essence, it seems like a dramatic character study whose narrative arc is depicted largely through bitterly funny encounters. This squirm inducing film has plenty of laugh out loud moments, but its truthfulness (and underlying sadness) resonate long after the film ends.In many ways, that's what really makes ""Young Adult"" a stand-out. Cody, dispensing with the rapid fire pop culture referencing she's known for, creates someone very believable and human in Mavis Gary. Selfish, vindictive, delusional--she is not a particularly nice person. She wears a veneer of confidence like a suit of armor, but all the cracks are starting to show. It is an uncompromising role, and Theron inhabits it with a fearless aggression. It may be one of my favorite performances of the year. Like a fine balancing act, the film never makes Theron a cartoon villain (which would happen in most other movies). She is always wildly real and unpredictable and, quite frankly, slightly dangerous. But the screenplay also makes another conscious choice that, again, few other mainstream movies (especially comedies) ever attempt. This is not a story of redemption or learning life's lessons. There is no moralistic posturing or hugs all around. There is, in short, no sell-out to who this character is. And that turns a good film into a really memorable one!Theron is, in a word, incredible. Both Wilson and Reaser do well as the couple targeted by Theron's machinations. But the film's most surprising role is fulfilled by Patton Oswalt, as a high school outsider who forms an unlikely alliance with the adult Theron. They play off each other effortlessly. Oswalt may be the one person who Theron can really be herself with, and the development of their relationship is one of the primary selling points of ""Young Adult."" Truthfully, I loved this movie. It showcases a complicated unpleasantness and brutal honesty that may not appeal to every viewer (especially those seeking frothy romantic comedy). But its grittier vibe is a real change of pace. Funny, and remarkably sad as well, ""Young Adult"" covers somewhat familiar territory but seems surprisingly fresh and different and smart.

I am struck by the dichotomy of Amazon's reviews and wonder how so many viewers could hold such opposite opinions. See for yourself: at this writing, 104 four and five stars, 85 one stars. I conclude this excellent character study of a narcissist steps on a lot of toes. Why else the near hatred reserved for this film? A few thoughtful reviewers did note a similarity between themselves and the Mavis character, so someone got something substantive, maybe even insightful, from it, unlike those who found it a `waste of my life'. Hmmm.At any rate, Young Adult has many attributes: the acting by Charlize Theron and others is spot-on; scenes that may appear throw-away or uneventful to some reveal personality. One reviewer questioned the manicure scenes: but what normal woman would get two manicures in two days? No one. Only a self-obsessed, desperate woman would think changing the color of her nails is going to make someone else's  husband fall for her. She ignores or resents her only friend, a Pomeranian. She relates to a hotel clerk and others with gratuitous lying, mostly about how she came to be in town at all (""real estate thing""). Her contempt for others is palpable; and what about the self-contempt? Her slatternly lifestyle is on parade through her apartment, vehicle, diet, and wardrobe. It's as if she thinks her beauty is enough, but the truth is beginning to break through and make her miserable. And while there are `darkly comic' moments, this film is anything but a comedy. Observe the train wreck unfold.Through minute chinks, the truth outs itself. Mavis flatly states to her clueless parents ""I may be an alcoholic"" and they brush it off.  After the excruciating scene on Buddy's front lawn, Mavis sees herself for what she is. Some reviewers say there's no point, no plot to this film. They're not paying attention. The denouement comes quietly, at Matt's kitchen table during a conversation between the newly-discerning Mavis and Matt's sister, who crushes Mavis' s revelation by assuring her that she's the same superior being she's always (never) been. The light recedes from Mavis's eyes and THAT is the point of the film. Redemption was offered and rejected.

1458796,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B005FITIK0,M. Bullions,"[11, 16]","We all know a woman like Mavis Gary. She's the kind of girl who everyone feared in high school, who was always effortlessly beautiful, and yet she had no personality whatsoever. She would do whatever was thought to be ""cool"". Her loved-but-feared status meant that she probably barely registered your existence at all. We assume that this kind of woman goes on to do great things, and becomes an amazing person who would have a whole new generation of people fearing her, but that is not always the case, and that is where we meet Mavis, in ""Young Adult"".Diablo Cody will forever be known for writing 2007's hip-dialogue laden and instantly memorable ""Juno"", a somewhat controversial teen comedy, which served as a star vehicle for Ellen Page, ensuring that she will play rebellious teenagers well into her thirties. Diablo Cody has reunited with her ""Juno"" director, Jason Reitman, for ""Young Adult"". I would like to mention that aside from auteur moments in Cody's writing, this is nothing at all like ""Juno"", and that's a good thing.""Young Adult"" is the study of a borderline psychotic personality. It's the story of Mavis Gary, a woman pushing 40, who lives alone, with her obviously neglected Pomeranian, in her disheveled condo in Minneapolis. She is a ghost writer of young adult fiction, which is ironic, considering she hasn't grown up at all since high school. She is not emotionally matured in any way, and thinks that her living in a neighboring city of her suburban hometown means that she has a life. She gets an e-mail from an old high school boyfriend who invites her to a baby-naming ceremony, or something like that. Fully intending to get him back, she blatantly ignores the fact that he is a husband and new father. In her mind, there is something not right in the universe, and she intends to fix it.We don't really know, as an audience, if we are supposed to feel empathy for Mavis, or if we should just feel pity. At several points in the film, we see Mavis laying face-down on a bed, either in her cold pigsty apartment, or her hotel room, where she appears to be dead. She's never dead, just dead drunk. Her character says to her parents at one point, ""I think I might be an alcoholic"", and the statement is largely ignored. Anyone who says this aloud knows damn well that they are, and the fact that her parents ignored this statement shows you what kind of family this woman came from. Mavis is definitely an alcoholic, seen repeatedly drinking heavily just to make it through the day. She may as well have been drunk in every scene. This is a study of a depressive character, but the thing that bothered me was that her parents ignored this statement, because they would obviously rather pretend that there is no issue. It's upsetting, but like I said, it shows where this woman became this way. That's good writing.This film works because the lead character is extremely well written and observed, but also because Charlize Theron knocks this one out of the park. First of all, before I get to any other facts about this character, I must say that Theron plays a drunk very well. The last thing I remember seeing her in was her infamous performance as Aileen Wournos in 2003's ""Monster"", and it is going to sound trite, but she's playing a different kind of monster here. She is a woman whose main goal in this film is to break up a marriage. She gave so much of herself to this character, and she may as well be responsible for the film's success. I personally liked Mavis, a character who we're supposed to hate, or feel great pity for, and I give Theron most of the credit for that.Patton Oswalt, of stand-up comedy fame, plays Mavis's ally in the whole thing, Matt, a guy who graduated with her, who she probably never talked to in high school, yet he is either fascinated by her antics, or just enjoys talking to her, because they become good friends. I know Oswalt from Cody's Showtime series ""United States of Tara"", where he also played the kind of character he plays here: the voice of reason to a borderline sociopath. He is a crucial ingredient to why this film is as good as it is, and had to be mentioned.With ""Juno"", ""Thank You For Smoking"", and ""Up in the Air"", and now ""Young Adult"", Jason Reitman has a fantastic track record. I have enthusiastically enjoyed each of his films thus far. It's interesting for me to think of this film as a companion piece to 2009's ""Up in the Air"", two films about emotionally stunted individuals. [George] Clooney's character in ""Up in the Air"" didn't want to feel anything, and didn't want to get too close to anyone. The film ends with him not exactly changing, but moving forward in his life, ignoring factors that would have emotionally devastated the average person, and just moving forward. Meanwhile, Mavis is irrevocably stuck in the past. The best time in her life was high school, where she was popular and kind of feared, and now she is just pitied. Yet she is obsessed with making her glory days a reality again.There is nothing warm, sentimental or happy about the ending of this film, let me just say that right off the top. The film itself is dour, bleak and emotionally brutal. The performances are powerful, and the writing is excellent, yet it doesn't have the warm, happy, everything-is-better-all-of-a-sudden ending that American audiences are used to, and that's a damn good thing. Most character studies about unlikable people typically have the antihero change for the better in the end, in an ending where everything is warm, and everyone is left happy, but Mavis doesn't get off the hook that easily. While the film, in a whole, is quite depressing, its brand of black-as-night comedy is refreshing and welcome. I would call it the meanest Hollywood film this year, and that's a very good thing.Grade: A-",5,A fearless character study of prolonged adolescence.,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,5808,"['know',

1458802,A6YDFT9VF31YY,B005FITIK0,minskim,"[6, 7]","I initially did not have any interest in seeing this movie based upon the trailers.  I saw this movie because it was free with Amazon Prime.  This movie is nowhere near as much of a downer, depressing, or sad as indicated by some of the other reviews.  There are depressing and sad moments throughout the movie, but I also found myself laughing at a lot of the lines and situations.  I may have a somewhat dark sense of humor, but how can you not laugh at some of the ridiculous statements and situations in the movie??  There's a lot of tongue in cheek humor to be had from the perspective of the movie viewer.Despite the outrageousness of the characters, I thought this was one of the few movies that rings as being honest, real and relatable with most people's lives.  The movie is filled with people who are leading unhappy and/or boring lives and who don't know it and/or are unable to admit it to themselves or to other people.  But none of them know how to deal with their own unhappiness, might as well as the unhappiness of others.  Surprisingly, it's Mavis who turns out to be the most genuine, real, honest and self-aware character in the movie.And because her character is so completely trashed by so many of the other reviewers, I feel the need to defend Mavis.  She is desperately unhappy and she knows it.  Unlike almost all of the other characters, with the exception of Freehaul, she knows just how unhappy she is even if she can't always admit it out loud.  But unlike the other characters, she DOES admit it out loud and for all to witness.  The scene where she lays all her emotions out to bare at the baby naming ceremony has got to be one of the most honest scenes I've seen in a movie.  I love Charlize Theron, and she owned that scene.  The emotions were so raw and real that it felt like my own nerves had been ripped open for everyone to see.  Mavis is not a hero but she's very real, and to me there's something to be admired in being able to admit the truth no matter how ugly it is.There are no heroes in this movie.  All of the apparently ""normal"" and supposedly well-adjusted people in this movie are just as messed up as she is in their own way, in my opinion.  For instance, what kinds of parents refuse to acknowledge the very real and obvious unhappiness in their daughter even when she tells them that she thinks she is an alcoholic?  What kind of unaware self-obsessed woman thinks that a surefire way to cheer up her husband's ex-high school girlfriend, who she thinks is lonely and confused, would be to invite her to their baby's naming ceremony?  Yes, I'm sure that will cheer her right up and make her feel less lonely and confused.  Seriously, WTF?  I've got more examples.  What kind of messed up fool thinks that it's at all acceptable to invite the woman who had a miscarriage with his baby to his baby's naming ceremony?  Did he forget that she miscarried his child??  Did he also forget that he kissed her when Mavis was confronting him about their alleged feelings for each other?  Pretending something didn't happen doesn't mean that it didn't happen.The people in this movie are messed up, and it's not limited to Mavis.  She's not even the most messed up in the movie, in my opinion.  But there's something very true about this movie, along with the darker humor, that makes me love it.",5,Surprisingly good,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,3338,"['initially', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'interest', 'seeing', 'movie', 'based', 'trailers', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'near', 'much', 'downer', 'depressing', 'sad', 'indicated', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'depressing', 'sad', 'moments', 'movie', 'also', 'found', 'laughing', 'lot', 'lines', 'situations', 'may', 'have', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'ridiculous', 'statements', 'situations', 'movie', 'lot', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'humor', 'be', 'had', 'perspective', 'movie', 'outrageousness', 'characters', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'rings', 'being', 'honest', 'real', 'relatable', 'most', 'people', 'lives', 'movie', 'filled', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'leading', 'unhappy', 'and/or', 'boring', 'lives', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'and/or', 'are', 'unable', 'admit', 'other', 'people', 'none', 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'own', 'unhappiness', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'unhappiness', 'others', 'Surprisingly', 'Mavis', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'genuine', 'real', 'honest', 'self-aware', 'character', 'movie.And', 'character', 'so', 'completely', 'trashed', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'feel', 'need', 'defend', 'Mavis', 'desperately', 'unhappy', 'almost', 'other', 'characters', 'exception', 'Freehaul', 'just', 'how', 'unhappy', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'admit', 'out', 'loud', 'other', 'characters', 'admit', 'out', 'loud', 'witness', 'scene', 'where', 'emotions', 'out', 'bare', 'baby', 'naming', 'ceremony', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'honest', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'love', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'owned', 'scene', 'emotions', 'were', 'so', 'raw', 'real', 'felt', 'own', 'nerves', 'had', 'been', 'ripped', 'open', 'everyone', 'see', 'Mavis', 'not', 'hero', 'very', 'real', 'something', 'be', 'admired', 'being', 'able', 'admit', 'truth', 'matter', 'how', 'ugly', 'are', 'heroes', 'movie', 'apparently', 'normal', 'supposedly', 'well-adjusted', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'messed', 'up', 'own', 'way', 'opinion', 'instance', 'what', 'parents', 'refuse', 'acknowledge', 'very', 'real', 'obvious', 'unhappiness', 'daughter', 'even', 'when', 'alcoholic', 'What', 'kind', 'unaware', 'self-obsessed', 'woman', 'surefire', 'way', 'cheer', 'up', 'husband', 'ex-high', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'lonely', 'confused', 'would', 'be', 'invite', 'baby', 'naming', 'ceremony', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'cheer', 'right', 'up', 'make', 'feel', 'less', 'lonely', 'confused', 'Seriously', 'WTF', ""'ve"", 'got', 'more', 'examples', 'What', 'kind', 'messed', 'up', 'fool', 'thinks', 'acceptable', 'invite', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'miscarriage', 'baby', 'baby', 'naming', 'ceremony', 'Did', 'forget', 'miscarried', 'child', 'Did', 'also', 'forget', 'kissed', 'when', 'Mavis', 'was', 'confronting', 'alleged', 'feelings', 'other', 'Pretending', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', ""n't"", 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.The', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'messed', 'up', 'not', 'limited', 'Mavis', 'not', 'even', 'most', 'messed', 'up', 'movie', 'opinion', 'something', 'very', 'true', 'movie', 'darker', 'humor', 'love']",Young Adult

Here a former beauty queen and most popular girl in high school realizes that her life isn't very fulfilling.  Now closer to 40 than 30, Mavis Gary (an extraordinary Charlize Theron) spends most night pounding down Bourbon shots and finding love in all the wrong places.  Yet, she's beautiful and sophisticated, at least in public.  She wears beautiful clothes and on the outside appears to be very successful.  On the inside, she's mean and unhappy with her life.Now living in the big city of ""Minnie Apples"" (Minneapolis), she decides to return to her roots in the small town of Mercury in upstate Minnesota.  There she expects to reacquaint herself with her former high school boyfriend Buddy (Patrick Wilson).  No matter that Buddy is now happily married and has a new baby.  To Mavis that is just an inconvenience and can be easily overcome.  As a published writer of ""young adult"" novels, Mavis is perceived as the girl who made the big time by the locals.  Mavis runs into another former student in a local bar who had the locker next to hers.  But she doesn't even remember Matt (Patton Oswalt), a bit of a schlub who Mavis never knew existed.  Matt tries to counter balance Mavis's attempt to sabotage Buddy's marriage.  The byplay between them throughout is the best thing in the film.  Both are excellent.Overall, however the writing is the weak link.  Films like ""Juno"" and Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" are filled with quick, witty dialog.  Here, it is uneven.  Still, Theron's depiction of Mavis is a revelation.  Mavis is not likeable.  She's clearly damaged and alcohol dependent.  At the same time, we tend to root for her to get it together.

1458809,AV252YPWNODEV,B005FITIK0,M. Oliver,"[12, 20]","This movie is awful.  It is proof that you cannot make a good movie by simply putting an academy award winning actress in it, even when her performance was incredibly good.The story is utterly non sequential nonsense with no dialogue continuity.  Theron's character is a 37 year old alcoholic who discovers her high school boyfriend just had a baby, and she decides to try and win him back.  The first 5 minutes of the movie show her in her self absorbed, narcissistic pointless life, having a one night affair, and leaving the guy in her bed as she dons a Hello Kitty shirt and drives off in her Mini Cooper to the little town in Minnesota where she grew up.  This short time is supposed to introduce you to this terribly flawed human.  She then arrives at a bar where a guy - who in high school she would not have (and did not) even notice - recognizes her, and they *immediately* strike up an in depth conversation demonstrating both of them as flawed and life abused.  Nonsense.  The guy is a cripple, apparently having been beaten to an inch of his life by a bunch of jocks who thought he was gay, to the point his penis is ""bent.""  This poor cripple - who does not even know the former boyfriend, then goes to some great length to try and disabuse the woman from her youth-recapture effort.  Nonsense.The story is so bad - there are multiple characters that are randomly introduced, who have some ""small town"" connection to the main character, and then they disappear.  Why?  For example, in a bar scene, a guy in a wheel chair appears - turns out he is one of those happy go lucky wheel chair bound people and the cousin of Theron's character?  Wait, what?  So what?  Why?  Pointless.  The dialogue here is just stupid.This is not a black comedy.  If that is what they were shooting for, they missed it by a mile and then some.  Someone else compared this to Christian Bale's effort in American Psycho.  Trust me, there is NO COMPARISON.  American Psycho pulls you into the main character's psychosis.  You want to watch a *masterful* black comedy - watch Kevin Spacey inAmerican Beauty (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray].  That movie defines the genre.  Black comedies are often narrated - this movie is not narrated.  They are narrated because it is hard to convey the rich flaws in just 2 hours of visual work.  This movie has effectively no sound score that builds either momentum or suspense.In the end, this is a movie with a bunch of sad people doing sad depressing things.  And the end of the movie . . .  I won't spoil it because it cannot be spoiled . . . she just drives off.  This movie is like listening to a musician who plays technically perfect with no soul or musical sense.When I looked here at the rating I was flabbergasted to see 5 star reviews.  Many of the scenes mentioned that were allegedly ""hilarious"" are so awful I literally was squirming.Notwithstanding the horrible script, lack of plot, lack of direction, lack of remotely suspenseful music or soundtrack and implausible dialogue . . . if there is a redeeming part of this movie, it was Ms. Theron's performance.  Her acting range is extreme, and some of the ""evil"" looks she gives to the boyfriends wife . . . sends chills down your back.  Her performance, as good as it was, simply does not save this horrible, horrible waste of celluloid.-mike",1,Utterly awful script and directing not buoyed by Theron best effort,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,3328,"['movie', 'awful', 'proof', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'simply', 'putting', 'academy', 'award', 'winning', 'actress', 'even', 'when', 'performance', 'was', 'incredibly', 'good.The', 'story', 'utterly', 'non', 'sequential', 'nonsense', 'dialogue', 'continuity', 'Theron', 'character', '37', 'year', 'old', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'boyfriend', 'just', 'had', 'baby', 'try', 'win', 'back', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'show', 'self', 'absorbed', 'narcissistic', 'pointless', 'life', 'having', 'one', 'night', 'affair', 'leaving', 'guy', 'bed', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'shirt', 'off', 'Mini', 'Cooper', 'little', 'town', 'Minnesota', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'short', 'time', 'supposed', 'introduce', 'terribly', 'flawed', 'human', 'then', 'bar', 'where', 'guy', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'notice', '*immediately*', 'strike', 'up', 'depth', 'conversation', 'demonstrating', 'flawed', 'life', 'abused', 'Nonsense', 'guy', 'cripple', 'apparently', 'having', 'been', 'beaten', 'inch', 'life', 'bunch', 'jocks', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'gay', 'point', 'penis', 'bent', 'poor', 'cripple', 'who', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'then', 'great', 'length', 'try', 'disabuse', 'woman', 'youth-recapture', 'effort', 'Nonsense.The', 'story', 'so', 'bad', 'are', 'multiple', 'characters', 'are', 'randomly', 'introduced', 'who', 'have', 'small', 'town', 'connection', 'main', 'character', 'then', 'disappear', 'Why', 'example', 'bar', 'scene', 'guy', 'wheel', 'chair', 'out', 'one', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'wheel', 'chair', 'people', 'cousin', 'Theron', 'character', 'Wait', 'what', 'So', 'what', 'Why', 'Pointless', 'dialogue', 'here', 'just', 'stupid.This', 'not', 'black', 'comedy', 'what', 'were', 'shooting', 'missed', 'mile', 'then', 'Someone', 'else', 'compared', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'effort', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Trust', 'COMPARISON', 'American', 'Psycho', 'main', 'character', 'psychosis', 'want', 'watch', '*masterful*', 'black', 'comedy', 'watch', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'inAmerican', 'Beauty', 'Sapphire', 'Series', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'movie', 'genre', 'Black', 'comedies', 'are', 'often', 'narrated', 'movie', 'not', 'narrated', 'are', 'narrated', 'hard', 'convey', 'rich', 'flaws', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'visual', 'work', 'movie', 'effectively', 'sound', 'score', 'momentum', 'suspense.In', 'end', 'movie', 'bunch', 'sad', 'people', 'doing', 'sad', 'depressing', 'things', 'end', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'spoiled', 'just', 'off', 'movie', 'listening', 'musician', 'who', 'technically', 'perfect', 'soul', 'musical', 'sense.When', 'looked', 'here', 'rating', 'was', 'flabbergasted', 'see', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'Many', 'scenes', 'mentioned', 'were', 'allegedly', 'hilarious', 'are', 'so', 'awful', 'literally', 'was', 'squirming.Notwithstanding', 'horrible', 'script', 'lack', 'plot', 'lack', 'direction', 'lack', 'remotely', 'suspenseful', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'implausible', 'dialogue', 'redeeming', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'Ms.', 'Theron', 'performance', 'acting', 'range', 'extreme', 'evil', 'boyfriends', 'wife', 'chills', 'down', 'back', 'performance', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'save', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'waste', 'celluloid.-mike']",Young Adult

1458812,A28J9NFHSF2ETC,B005FITIK0,M. Wilson,"[0, 1]","This movie was both funny and uncomfortable. I initially liked it because the character Mavis reminded me of someone I knew in h.s. who also chased an old boyfriend around. Theron does a great job of portraying a misguided, mentally unstable character. She is the beautiful, shallow girl who never emotionally developed, hence why she is a Y.A. writer.She is terribly unhappy, an alcoholic who wants to believe that she is free because she has shunned marriage and family. She makes it her goal to liberate her high school boyfriend Buddy from his otherwise happy marriage and new baby. The dream of getting back together with Buddy somehow might satisfy the longing for what she never had, but could have had if she had done things differently and made different choices.I am rating this movie a 3 because it might be a masterpiece, not sure, still processing it. Mavis definitely represents a demographic I have seen as I am in the same age group--the beautiful woman who partied in the city, had one night stands instead of deep relationships, who focused on appearance and having a good time (which descends into alcoholism). Now she finds herself childless, unmarried, aging, and despite all the years has not developed any sort of moral compass as to what is really important in life. In that way, Mavis is very representative of a particular type of person in our culture.She believes everyone from her hometown is inferior yet asks herself how they can be happy with so little. She is unable to learn the lessons that she needs to in order to grow as a human being. It is comedic and tragic.

1458815,A3009F8SKEDJNP,B005FITIK0,"Nick Name ""call me Mr. Name""","[0, 3]","""Young Adult"" confounds all expectations, including its own advertising, and not in a good way. Billed as a comedy and brought to us by the folks who created the winsome ""Juno,""""Young Adult"" turns out to be an unremittingly depressing, frequently ugly film that resolves itself in the end with a baldfaced lie. The premise of the film is recycled and old as time: a wandering ""star"" condescends to return to her hometown from the Big City to show the local yokels what it means to be important -- while of course setting herself up for the inevitable lesson that the ""folks at home"" are worthier than their Big World counterparts. And yes, ""wherever you go, there you are."" Numerous good films use the Homecoming Revelation to good effect -- funny, moving, even instructive -- but ""Young Adult"" is not one of them. No comedy indeed, it is largely a deeply offensive and demoralizing film. Here's why. First, the main character, played by Charlize Theron, manages to be pathetic and narcissistic, and to get herself into all kinds of trouble, while never eliciting a single shred of empathy or care from the viewer. It's a character whom we totally dislike; she's not even good to her dog (says sweet things, but neglects the pooch). Theron does a fantastic job bringing this failed and dislikeable person to convincing life. It is not at all the great comic turn advertised; it's a chillingly convincing rendition of an empty, awful person. It's a performance to admire but the viewer's main experience is one of revulsion. Plot? Well, this awful person causes genuinely cringe-worthy things to happen all around her -- watching it all feels like throwing up, and the film is mostly unbearable as a result. The resolution? She up and leaves for the city, we hear upbeat music and some words contending that she is now going to be a good, together person. This is the big lie in the film. The notion that people change their lives and their very character (and in this case, overcome alcoholism) just by deciding to do so is grossly untrue to the entire history of mankind. This lie diminishes all the true life stories of real people who have made themselves into better people, friends, and lovers not merely by concluding that they should -- we all know we're supposed to be good -- but by doing something about it. There's not one whit of demonstration of change from the main character. The only bright spots in ""Young Adult"" are the constellation of minor characters who are laboriously making decent, loving lives. But the movie is not about them -- all are thinly shown and undeveloped. What the film gives us is something else again: a reprehensible, self-centered, unlikeable protagonist whom we are to believe transforms herself through the magic of momentary thought. Apparently, all you need to remake everything about yourself is a good intention! Like most people, I like most movies and don't need or even want every one to be great. Good is fine!

1458817,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B005FITIK0,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[1, 1]","Dynamic duo, Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody, return with a vengeance with their dramatic comedy, Young Adult. Mavis (Charlize Theron), a former &iexcl;it&iexcl; girl and successful YA author, is fresh off a divorce and looking to escape her stagnant city life. She heads back to her small-town home with hopes of winning back an old high school flame (Patrick Wilson). Here&iexcl;s the catch: he&iexcl;s now married and father to a newborn. So what&iexcl;s a successful girl to do? Throw in a home distillery, a disabled former classmate (Patton Oswalt), a manipulative plan and what do you get? A whole lot of soul-searching.It&iexcl;s safe to say, I did not expect Young Adult to be what it was. From the previews I was anticipating more of a comedic romp with mild substance. Young Adult, however, is not that type of film.There are touches of comedy, sure, but it&iexcl;s a darker humour that&iexcl;s inspired more by the dramatic narrative than anything else. Cody (of Juno fame) is masterful at crafting a touching story and I think her writing resonates with me because she creates such amazingly relatable characters. There is a realness to them and the desperate situations in which they find themselves. These aren&iexcl;t your average stock characters&iexcl;each one is beautiful, funny, ugly and tragic in their own way. I liked them, I hated them and empathized with them all and that&iexcl;s what made this movie so damn memorable.Let&iexcl;s start with Mavis. Mavis was that perfect girl in high school, you know the type&iexcl;the one that all the guys wanted to be with and all the girls wanted to be. Like, gag me with a spoon! Yeah.To the townies she&iexcl;s seen as this successful hot-shot living the royal life in the big city. But almost immediately we learn that appearances aren&iexcl;t always what they seem. Mavis has become a neurotic egoist struggling to cope with a crumbling life and dwindling fame. She lacks any sort of moral compass and she quickly crosses the line into shallow territory when she plots stealing her ex away. It quickly becomes clear that Mavis has some serious personal issues. First, can I just say&iexcl;Charlize Theron has totally outdone herself and created nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece playing the anti-heroine. Theron is brilliant at bringing both the depth and range needed to play such a messed up individual. Not many people could pull off this type of role so successfully. The subtle nuances of her performance had me completely riveted and still rooting for Mavis despite how unlikable she really is.Now enter, Matt, the only seemingly reasonable person that Mavis hooks up with while visiting her hometown. In high school he was bullied and abused by people in the popular crowd, and though still bitter, manages to have a firm hold on who he is and what he wants. He is the only one who&iexcl;s not blinded by Mavis&iexcl; fame and doesn&iexcl;t hold back when trying to bring her back down to reality. In short, it&iexcl;s hard not to feel sorry for Matt. He&iexcl;s a pawn that people push around both physically and emotionally and he bears the scars to prove it. Mavis uses him for her own selfish reasons, yet you admire the sense of inner strength he&iexcl;s gained because of it. He&iexcl;s somewhat of a dorky character who carries his own personal demons but is altogether still loveable. Oswalt did a phenomenal job conveying the loneliness and wit needed for such a role. He&iexcl;s the most likable person in the entire movie and I spent the whole time wishing I could give him a big ol&iexcl; bear hug.So I won&iexcl;t spoil the ending, but believe me, it left me wondering&iexcl;do people ever really change? We&iexcl;re not necessarily given the happiest of conclusions but at least it&iexcl;s a brutally honest one. Reitman, once again, has done wonders at making supremely complicated people seem so utterly fascinating with appropriately timed comedy and engaging dialogue. He&iexcl;s given us a film that enables us to look deep within ourselves and question our own intentions as well as the intentions of the characters on screen. Mavis isn't always likable and that's the beauty of the film. Upon face value we see a pretty perfect life but by the end of the movie we know it's what's below the surface that counts&iexcl;and that right there, folks, makes for an incredibly grown-up notion indeed.Food for Thought: Young Adult, is at its core, a story about people&iexcl;one that is wonderfully written and brilliantly delivered. If you&iexcl;re looking for a movie that generates some serious self-reflection you&iexcl;ve come to the right place. Much like Reitman and Cody&iexcl;s former hit, Juno, this movie is definitely a thinker. Highest of accolades to Theron and Oswalt for their stellar performances!Rating: &iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;",4,Wonderfully written and brilliantly delivered!,1348531200,"09 25,

It begins uncomfortably, progresses awkwardly, and ends painfully. But that's the point of Jason Reitman's film. Reitman breaks with form to create such wondrously intrusive works as Thank You for Smoking, Juno, and Up in the Air. What Reitman delivers particularly well are intriguing characters that represent moral objections to society (a cigarette ambassador, pregnant teenager, and cold-hearted corporate professional who fires people for a living), but don't necessarily learn the lesson that you'd suspect when credits roll.Bring in Charlize Theron, a thirty-seven year old young adult novelist who's never outlived her teenage popularity bratty-queen self despite the fact that the rest of the world, two decades later, has. She's beautiful, but we can't stand her. What unfolds is a depiction of her continual efforts to remain youthful by possessing her past, yet how suddenly, and often, she comes undone to herself. How one person could be so arrogant of others happiness and their own misery baffles us. When the movies through, we like her even less. While not Reitman's greatest film, Young Adult may be the best critical commentary on the modern obsession with teenage literature, like Twilight, that I've ever seen.Films by Jason Reitman:Young Adult, 2011Up in the Air, 2009Juno, 2007Thank You for Smoking, 2005-Noel J Hadley",4,Young adults as viewed by mature minds,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1479,"['Matt', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'back', 'Mercury', 'Did', 'move', 'back', 'Mavis', 'course', 'not', 'Gross', 'Young', 'Adult', 'uncomfortable', 'movie', 'uncomfortably', 'awkwardly', 'painfully', 'point', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'film', 'Reitman', 'form', 'create', 'such', 'wondrously', 'intrusive', 'works', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'Juno', 'Up', 'Air', 'What', 'Reitman', 'particularly', 'well', 'are', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'represent', 'moral', 'objections', 'society', 'cigarette', 'ambassador', 'pregnant', 'teenager', 'cold-hearted', 'corporate', 'professional', 'who', 'people', 'living', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'learn', 'lesson', ""'d"", 'suspect', 'when', 'credits', 'roll.Bring', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'thirty-seven', 'year', 'old', 'young', 'adult', 'novelist', 'who', 'never', 'outlived', 'teenage', 'popularity', 'bratty-queen', 'self', 'fact', 'rest', 'world', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'What', 'depiction', 'continual', 'efforts', 'remain', 'youthful', 'possessing', 'past', 'how', 'suddenly', 'often', 'undone', 'herself', 'How', 'one', 'person', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'arrogant', 'others', 'happiness', 'own', 'misery', 'When', 'movies', 'like', 'even', 'less', 'not', 'Reitman', 'greatest', 'film', 'Young', 'Adult', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'critical', 'commentary', 'modern', 'obsession', 'teenage', 'literature', 'Twilight', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Films', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'Young', 'Adult', '2011Up', 'Air', '2009Juno', '2007Thank', 'Smoking', '2005-Noel', 'J', 'Hadley']",Young Adult

Yet, all of the good will established in the first 80 minutes of the film is completely undone in what I feel is a shameful epilogue.There's probably an alternative way of approaching this film's closing act; one could argue that a speech delivered by Oswald's sister is simply a means of feeding Theron with the only thing she may be willing to hear, just to get her out of town and stop destroying the people in it.  And, I can see how someone could see the ending in this way.However, I couldn't shake the feeling that the speech was actually a means of preventing Theron's character from becoming a better person.  In this scene, Theron's character looks for all the world as a woman desperately in need of saving.  She seems sincere in her willingness to change.  And, at this point in her life, when she needs to hear something that will help her, she just winds up finding another woefully misguided soul that feeds her a bunch of crap about being better than the so-called healthy and happy people.  In fact, all of her grotesque behavior is being heralded as some sign of being exceptional, above the need for civility or mental stability because she has killer good looks and a job writing fiction.If Theron's character had actually been given an opportunity to change, then I might have agreed that this film honestly depicts a sociopath, but as it stands, I see it as the same B.S. message from Hollywood -- people who aren't in the limelight aren't worth a minute of your consideration.I hated this movie despite its technical brilliance.",2,The Critics Must Be High -- Young Adult Is Deplorable,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,2112,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'director', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'fact', 'previous', 'film', 'Up', 'Air', 'made', 'very', 'top', 'Ten', 'Best', 'list', '2009', 'Young', 'Adult', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'films', '2011', 'film', 'executed', 'fine', 'craftsmanship', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'message', 'being', 'served', 'talents', 'just', 'downright', 'socially', 'irresponsible', 'off-putting', 'anyone', 'taste', 'class', 'sense.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'fine', 'performances', 'given', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Patton', 'Oswald', ""'re"", 'fine', 'form', 'lend', 'characters', 'believability', 'good', 'will', 'established', 'first', '80', 'minutes', 'film', 'completely', 'undone', 'what', 'feel', 'shameful', 'epilogue.There', 'probably', 'alternative', 'way', 'approaching', 'film', 'closing', 'act', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'speech', 'delivered', 'Oswald', 'sister', 'simply', 'means', 'feeding', 'Theron', 'only', 'thing', 'may', 'be', 'willing', 'hear', 'just', 'get', 'town', 'stop', 'destroying', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'could', 'see', 'ending', 'way.However', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake', 'feeling', 'speech', 'was', 'actually', 'means', 'preventing', 'Theron', 'character', 'becoming', 'better', 'person', 'scene', 'Theron', 'character', 'world', 'woman', 'desperately', 'need', 'saving', 'sincere', 'willingness', 'change', 'point', 'life', 'when', 'hear', 'something', 'will', 'help', 'just', 'up', 'finding', 'woefully', 'misguided', 'soul', 'bunch', 'crap', 'being', 'better', 'so-called', 'healthy', 'happy', 'people', 'fact', 'grotesque', 'behavior', 'being', 'heralded', 'sign', 'being', 'exceptional', 'need', 'civility', 'mental', 'stability', 'killer', 'good', 'looks', 'job', 'writing', 'fiction.If', 'Theron', 'character', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'given', 'opportunity', 'change', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'agreed', 'film', 'honestly', 'sociopath', 'see', 'same', 'B.S', 'message', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'limelight', 'are', ""n't"", 'minute', 'consideration.I', 'hated', 'movie', 'technical', 'brilliance']",Young Adult

1458831,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B005FITIK0,Poor Napoleon,"[0, 3]","Charlize Theron plays the character of Mavis as if she was taken from a bad Katherine Heigl Rom-Com and thrust into the real world.  Jason Reitrman and Diablo Cody have crafted a film that deceives the viewer by challenging film conventions, and that's a compliment.Theron's character travels back to her hometown in hopes of hooking up with an old flame, Buddy.  Throughout the entire film, she is self absorbed, and delusional as if this is meant to be.  What makes the film compelling is that if this was any other film, her character would either wind up with the guy or learn some lesson and wind up with an equally handsome great guy.  Yet, as in all of Reitman's work, Mavis is incredibly flawed and a happy ending isn't easily achieved.  What happen's is surprising and the ending isn't neccessarily fullfilling depending on how you view it.  Personally, I think it's fitting.While Theron is impressive, Patton Oswalt is equally good as a voice of reason for Mavis.  He plays one of her former classmates who was clearly unpopular and not even a footnote in Mavis's life, despite having a locker next to her.  Like Mavis, he's still somewhat trapped in the past, though for entirely different, shocking reasons.  The Reitman/Cody character study culminates in a great scene between Theron and Oswalt that almost literally strips the characters of any pretense, displaying both at their most vulnerable.This movie is not for everyone, and people seem to love it or hate it.  It has some light touches of comedy but by most counts, it's very clearly a drama.  Like all of Reitman's films, I wanted to pick this one up again and rewatch it.

Perhaps Ms Cody's script was from personal experience, and maybe Reitman thought he could rely on a good cast to make it work. It almost does.Charlize Theron plays the most selfish, unlikeable and despicable character I've seen in a long time...and she's magnificent. Her futile meltdown at the end is priceless. Patrick Wilson shows more depth of character than I've seen from him, and was quite good. Poor pitiful Patton Oswalt plays a guy we've all known; misunderstood, out-cast and bullied mercilessly in his youth, he's become cynical and all-knowing in his lonely later years. It's really not as bad as some of the 1-star reviews claim; the only unlikeable character is Charlize, and it's played fearlessly.I thought the script was clever in many places, and laughed out loud a few times. It's not really easy to watch, and I'll never buy it, but I'm glad I saw it.

1458835,A1PUDOUADJGBBG,B005FITIK0,RHW,"[4, 4]","I had to post a review after noticing that this movie has really polarized audiences.  There is no doubt this is a dark comedy - perhaps what may help people who are considering watching this movie is to know what to expect out of a dark comedy.Watch the trailer.  Notice that Theron's character is a walking train wreck that still makes any red blooded guy's jaw drop to the floor.  Notice that in nearly every scene in the trailer, Theron comes off as totally off, from the dog in her bag, to the binge drinking, to how she constantly tries to steal a husband who is happily married with a newborn child, and how everyone in the trailer knows she is a tad touched in the head.  If you found the trailer to be hilariously funny, you ain't seen nothing yet...that's just a warm-up to what will promise to be one of the funniest movie's you'll see in a long time.The laughs are similar to the laughs American Psycho delivers.  Christian Bale's signature film is also a similarly disturbing movie with another character that is totally off, yet somehow Bale is able to make you laugh again and again at lines that are so inappropriate that one can't help but to admire the comedy.  Like American Psycho, this movie also comes attached with what would otherwise be deeply disturbing content (if not for the humor), although not quite to that bloody of a degree.If you found American Psycho to be such a turn off that you had to turn away in revulsion, expect a similar result after viewing this film.  If you found American Psycho to be one hell of a dark comedy that was loaded with social commentary, you will find this film to be along the same vein, except with no blood and more laughs.  I have to commend Theron again for taking on a very challenging role - to act out a character that many will love to hate, will face no small amount of humiliation, and will leave audiences hating her even more when it is all said and done, all while looking her best.",5,"Watch the trailer, then watch the movie",1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1958,"['had', 'post', 'review', 'noticing', 'movie', 'really', 'polarized', 'audiences', 'doubt', 'dark', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'what', 'may', 'help', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'considering', 'watching', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'dark', 'comedy.Watch', 'trailer', 'Notice', 'Theron', 'character', 'walking', 'train', 'wreck', 'still', 'red', 'blooded', 'guy', 'jaw', 'drop', 'floor', 'Notice', 'nearly', 'scene', 'trailer', 'Theron', 'off', 'totally', 'dog', 'bag', 'binge', 'drinking', 'how', 'constantly', 'steal', 'husband', 'who', 'happily', 'married', 'newborn', 'child', 'how', 'everyone', 'trailer', 'tad', 'touched', 'head', 'found', 'trailer', 'be', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'ai', ""n't"", 'seen', 'nothing', 'yet', 'just', 'warm-up', 'what', 'will', 'promise', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'long', 'time.The', 'laughs', 'are', 'similar', 'laughs', 'American', 'Psycho', 'delivers', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'signature', 'film', 'also', 'similarly', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'character', 'totally', 'off', 'yet', 'somehow', 'Bale', 'able', 'make', 'laugh', 'again', 'again', 'lines', 'are', 'so', 'inappropriate', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'comedy', 'American', 'Psycho', 'movie', 'also', 'attached', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'content', 'not', 'humor', 'not', 'quite', 'bloody', 'degree.If', 'found', 'American', 'Psycho', 'be', 'such', 'turn', 'off', 'had', 'turn', 'away', 'revulsion', 'expect', 'similar', 'result', 'viewing', 'film', 'found', 'American', 'Psycho', 'be', 'one', 'hell', 'dark', 'comedy', 'was', 'loaded', 'social', 'commentary', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'same', 'vein', 'blood', 'more', 'laughs', 'have', 'commend', 'Theron', 'again', 'taking', 'very', 'challenging', 'role', 'act', 'out', 'character', 'many', 'will', 'love', 'hate', 'will', 'face', 'small', 'amount', 'humiliation', 'will', 'leave', 'audiences', 'hating', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'looking', 'best']",Young Adult

1458838,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B005FITIK0,RMurray847,"[9, 14]","Your enjoyment of YOUNG ADULT will depend pretty much on how able you are to enjoy a well-acted, well-written movie that also features a thoroughly unlikeable and irredeemable lead character engaging in fairly trivial and uninteresting activities.The excellent (at least in this film) Charlize Theron plays the lead character, a modestly successful ghost-writer of young adult novels who is nonetheless  deeply unhappy because her high school love (Patrick Wilson) is happily married to someone else (Elizabeth Reaser).  Although decades have gone by since high school, Theron is unable to shake the idea that she and Wilson belong together.  So she returns to her home town with the express purpose of seducing Wilson into realizing his mistake in marrying and to return to her.  To say that Theron is delusional is not a stretch.  I think the film wants us to see her as ""trapped in adolescence and unable to move on.""  I see her as crazy, unlikeable and unsympathetic.  She's a drunk (I'm not sure I've seen a female character more addicted to the booze since the days when Liz Taylor slung her whiskey around in VIRGINIA WOOLF) of the first order.  She's incapable of seeing true emotion in others...yet she's also almost completely non-self-aware at the same time.During her time in town, she shares a few drinks with Patton Oswalt, a former classmate who was a victim of some SERIOUS bullying back in the day.  Oswalt is now a self-conscious nerd, with a serious limp due to a beating he received...a disability he seems to use as an excuse to hide himself from the world.  He, too, is scarred and changed by his adolescence...but he's the pitiful character, because he IS self-aware.  He's also oddly drawn to Theron, and the two develop an interesting and surprising relationship that is the best part of the film, BY FAR.  Oswalt, always a solid actor, really takes a big leap in vulnerability.  The hints of real acting chops he showed in UNITED STATES OF TARA come into full realization here.Wilson does his patented ""handsome, slightly boring but generally agreeable guy"" character.  (See anything from LITTLE CHILDREN to LAKEVIEW TERRACE.)  He is NOT an exciting actor, and is often actively annoying (see PHANTOM OF THE OPERA...or not).  Often, he is cast opposite far more exciting performers (whether Kate Winslet or Samuel Jackson) and never comes out ahead.  It's much the same here...but his natural blankness works better, because we can never quite tell if he's interested in Theron still or just being a tolerant nice-guy.  Reaser shows some nice levels in the fairly thankless role of Wilson's wife, and it reminded me of how truly terrific she was in SWEETLAND.The film is written by Diablo Cody (JUNO) and directed by the extremely talented Jason Reitman.  The screenplay is witty and less ""cutesy clever"" than JUNO.  Cody is a super sharp observer of mundane details...and Reitman (THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, JUNO, UP IN THE AIR) is fantastic at taking dialogue heavy movies and making them pop, move and sizzle.

1458844,A3O8HCFECC2GT6,B005FITIK0,Ross,"[0, 1]","Charlize Theron is a phenomenal actress and gives a captivating performance as Mavis - a sort of female Patrick Bateman without the violence, a product of the same ""pursuit of loneliness"".  But unlike the American Psycho, this character is somewhat unusual in that she is emotionally intelligent while being morally vapid and that complexity shows the brilliance of the writing.  Plenty of characters are intellectually vapid and morally vapid, or even intelligent but emotionally vapid and morally bankrupt like Patrick Bateman, but it's rare to see a character portrayed with such a high humanistic i.q. and so fatally foolish.  It's as if screenwriters can't imagine one of their own being such a source of dysfunction and a reminder that all the knowledge in the world will never take the place of heart.Good supporting cast, Wilson, who doesn't break new ground but serves the role, and Oswalt, who once again seems to play himself, not that that's bad, it seems to suit him best as his professional choice of comic requires him to craft his personality into something stage-worthy.  And not that it's a contrivance, but a dedication to connect with the truth of his real life ""character"" to the extent that it's possible to plug ""Patton"" into movies without having to create a new character, i.e., his stand up persona, his role in ""Big Fan"" and this role aren't different people, and he's entertaining in all three.Young Adult is the quintessential protagonist is more antagonistic than not, fatalistic yet enlightening, and evidence that Reitman and Cody are the go-to production team for dark-comedy dramas.  The dark is the spiritual doom, the comedy is the mesmerizing juxtaposition of realism and contrivance in a character walking around in an emotional coma where people who would help, can't reach her, and the drama is the intellectually and physically overgrown teenager dealing with emotionally young adult issues.The kitchen table scene is so good it's all time, and it's significance is indescribable, and in that, demonstrates the need for cinema.  Theron does more with facial expressions in that scene than some movie stars will achieve in their whole career, and represents what professionalism looks like when someone is at the top of their game as opposed to early career success or a big break.A note about black comedies - they are as hardcore as any movie and by digging at the core of existence they tend to be more severe than thrillers where the tone matches the content or horror movies, which are usually silly and/or nothing more than momentary shock and gore.  Black comedies usually don't elicit out loud laughs, but then, I never thought Carlin did either, and like Young Adult, he was amusing in a way that prompts you to muse, it's more of a food for thought and satisfying contemplation than an uncontrolled laugh and can be worth much more.  It is mislabeling in the sense that it's more irony than comedy, according to the definition - ""situational irony - irony involving a situation in which actions have an effect that is opposite from what was intended, so that the outcome is contrary to what was expected.""  Mavis' intention is to be liked, but it's the young adult version of that, to be popular, and she gets the opposite of what she expected.  It worked then, everyone else moved on, grew up, and it doesn't work now, she alienates when her perverted intention was to gain acceptance.  The black of the comedy is that she's not adult enough to admit her need of others, to herself.Theron's performance is one of the more brilliant in recent memory along with Vera Farmiga in Higher Ground, Pitt in Moneyball, Shannon in Take Shelter and the entire cast of Animal Kingdom, all of whom give powerful performances without an ounce of over-acting.Theron deserves an award for Young Adult more than she did for Monster.",4,emotionally immature adult,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,3866,"['Charlize', 'Theron', 'phenomenal', 'actress', 'captivating', 'performance', 'Mavis', 'sort', 'female', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'violence', 'product', 'same', 'pursuit', 'loneliness', 'American', 'Psycho', 'character', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'emotionally', 'intelligent', 'being', 'morally', 'vapid', 'complexity', 'brilliance', 'writing', 'Plenty', 'characters', 'are', 'intellectually', 'vapid', 'morally', 'vapid', 'even', 'intelligent', 'emotionally', 'vapid', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'rare', 'see', 'character', 'portrayed', 'high', 'humanistic', 'i.q', 'so', 'fatally', 'foolish', 'screenwriters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'one', 'own', 'being', 'such', 'source', 'dysfunction', 'reminder', 'knowledge', 'world', 'will', 'never', 'take', 'place', 'heart.Good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Wilson', 'who', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'role', 'Oswalt', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'play', 'not', 'bad', 'suit', 'best', 'professional', 'choice', 'comic', 'craft', 'personality', 'something', 'stage-worthy', 'not', 'contrivance', 'dedication', 'connect', 'truth', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'extent', 'possible', 'plug', 'Patton', 'movies', 'having', 'create', 'new', 'character', 'i.e.', 'stand', 'up', 'persona', 'role', 'Big', 'Fan', 'role', 'are', ""n't"", 'different', 'people', 'entertaining', 'three.Young', 'Adult', 'quintessential', 'protagonist', 'more', 'antagonistic', 'not', 'fatalistic', 'yet', 'enlightening', 'evidence', 'Reitman', 'Cody', 'are', 'go-to', 'production', 'team', 'dark-comedy', 'dramas', 'dark', 'spiritual', 'doom', 'comedy', 'mesmerizing', 'juxtaposition', 'realism', 'contrivance', 'character', 'walking', 'around', 'emotional', 'coma', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'help', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reach', 'drama', 'intellectually', 'physically', 'overgrown', 'teenager', 'dealing', 'emotionally', 'young', 'adult', 'issues.The', 'kitchen', 'table', 'scene', 'so', 'good', 'time', 'significance', 'indescribable', 'need', 'cinema', 'Theron', 'more', 'facial', 'expressions', 'scene', 'movie', 'stars', 'will', 'achieve', 'whole', 'career', 'what', 'professionalism', 'when', 'someone', 'top', 'game', 'opposed', 'early', 'career', 'success', 'big', 'break.A', 'note', 'black', 'comedies', 'are', 'as', 'hardcore', 'movie', 'digging', 'core', 'existence', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'severe', 'thrillers', 'where', 'tone', 'content', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'silly', 'and/or', 'nothing', 'more', 'momentary', 'shock', 'gore', 'Black', 'comedies', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'elicit', 'out', 'loud', 'laughs', 'then', 'never', 'thought', 'Carlin', 'did', 'Young', 'Adult', 'was', 'amusing', 'way', 'muse', 'more', 'food', 'thought', 'satisfying', 'contemplation', 'uncontrolled', 'laugh', 'can', 'be', 'worth', 'much', 'more', 'mislabeling', 'sense', 'more', 'irony', 'comedy', 'according', 'definition', 'situational', 'irony', 'irony', 'involving', 'situation', 'actions', 'have', 'effect', 'opposite', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'outcome', 'contrary', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'Mavis', 'intention', 'be', 'liked', 'young', 'adult', 'version', 'be', 'popular', 'opposite', 'what', 'expected', 'worked', 'then', 'everyone', 'else', 'moved', 'grew', 'up', ""n't"", 'work', 'now', 'when', 'perverted', 'intention', 'was', 'gain', 'acceptance', 'black', 'comedy', 'not', 'adult', 'enough', 'admit', 'need', 'others', 'herself.Theron', 'performance', 'one', 'more', 'brilliant', 'recent', 'memory', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Higher', 'Ground', 'Pitt', 'Moneyball', 'Shannon', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'entire', 'cast', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'whom', 'give', 'powerful', 'performances', 'ounce', 'over-acting.Theron', 'deserves', 'award', 'Young', 'Adult', 'more', 'did', 'Monster']",Young Adult

Naimpally ""avid music and movie fan""","[2, 2]","Charlize Theron turns in her usual stellar performance in this dark and quriky drama from the people that brought you Juno, though it is quite different from Juno.  This is not a comedy so don't expect it to be funny.  Charlize portrays a successful writer of young adult novels.  But she is very messed up mentally - she is an adult but is very immature, a young adult.  She lives alone, has a habit of pulling her hair out, drinks herself to sleep every night, and has one night stands with men she barely knows.  When she receives an email birth announcement from her ex-boyfriend , who is now married, she decides on a whim to go back to her small hometown, naively thinking she can win him back.

I really enjoyed it, and if you're into satire, you'll enjoy it.-- tiny spoilers, I suppose! --Charlize Theron plays the Young Adult, Mavis, who is perfectly imperfect, and, in true Queen Bee fashion, has decided that now that her ex is unequivocally taken, she has to get him.

1458854,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B005FITIK0,Steve,"[2, 2]","This movie caught me by surprise. I hadn't heard about it at all and stumbled upon it on cable. Seeing Charlize Theron didn't pique my interest one way or the other, but I liked the others in the cast as well as the director, so I stuck around. What a fortunate discovery!The plot of this movie involves a small town homecoming for a mildly famous, alcoholic, self-loathing, ghost writer (Theron), overflowing with contempt, delusions of grandeur, and relentless narcissism. The writing is brilliant and the moving performances by Theron and Patton Oswalt make it shine even more.What stands out most for me is the way in which writer Diablo Cody captures the dichotomy between those who left their small towns and those who stayed. In particular, she addressed with deadly accuracy what happens when we create stereotypes to make us feel better about our damaged lives. I left my small town after high school, and it took me a while to realize that not everyone who stayed there was a loser, nor everyone who left better because of it. The only truth we can count on is that we've all changed, the past is dead, and all that has happened in between merely transformed that old friend into a familiar stranger. Cody doesn't give us the epiphany moment (thankfully), but rather allows us to see how we all deal with the past in various ways, and how that shapes our self-image.The unfortunately high number of one star votes reveals a lot about the expectations of movie fans for escapism, simple answers, and uncomplicated characters. You're not going to get much of that in Young Adult. What you will get is a brutally honest movie about a side of life that most don't want to acknowledge. Sometimes escape isn't a viable solution, answers aren't simple, and people are problematically complex. This movie is for those people.",5,You can't go home again,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,1827,"['movie', 'caught', 'surprise', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'stumbled', 'cable', 'Seeing', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'did', ""n't"", 'pique', 'interest', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'liked', 'others', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'stuck', 'around', 'What', 'fortunate', 'discovery', 'plot', 'movie', 'small', 'town', 'homecoming', 'mildly', 'famous', 'alcoholic', 'self-loathing', 'ghost', 'writer', 'Theron', 'overflowing', 'contempt', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'relentless', 'narcissism', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'moving', 'performances', 'Theron', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'make', 'shine', 'even', 'more.What', 'out', 'most', 'way', 'writer', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'dichotomy', 'who', 'left', 'small', 'towns', 'who', 'stayed', 'particular', 'addressed', 'deadly', 'accuracy', 'what', 'when', 'create', 'stereotypes', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'damaged', 'lives', 'left', 'small', 'town', 'high', 'school', 'took', 'while', 'realize', 'not', 'everyone', 'who', 'stayed', 'was', 'loser', 'everyone', 'who', 'left', 'better', 'only', 'truth', 'can', 'count', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'past', 'dead', 'happened', 'merely', 'transformed', 'old', 'friend', 'familiar', 'stranger', 'Cody', ""n't"", 'give', 'epiphany', 'moment', 'thankfully', 'rather', 'see', 'how', 'deal', 'past', 'various', 'ways', 'how', 'self-image.The', 'unfortunately', 'high', 'number', 'one', 'star', 'lot', 'expectations', 'movie', 'fans', 'escapism', 'simple', 'answers', 'uncomplicated', 'characters', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'much', 'Young', 'Adult', 'What', 'will', 'get', 'brutally', 'honest', 'movie', 'side', 'life', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'acknowledge', 'Sometimes', 'escape', ""n't"", 'viable', 'solution', 'answers', 'are', ""n't"", 'simple', 'people', 'are', 'problematically', 'complex', 'movie', 'people']",Young Adult

1458856,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B005FITIK0,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 4]","Young Adult (2011)Comedy, Drama, 94 minutesDirected by Jason ReitmanStarring Charlize Theron, Patton Oswalt and Patrick WilsonVideo:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 1.78:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1French: Dolby Digital 5.1Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles:English, English SDH, French, Spanish, PortugueseDisc:Single 50GB Blu-ray DiscThe Film 4.5/5Jason Reitman's first full-length feature was Thank You for Smoking and he followed it with Juno and Up in the Air. All three films are among my favorites and I was eager to see Young Adult in theaters. I consider Juno and Up in the Air to be just about perfect, so expectations were sky high.Diablo Cody won the Oscar for her Juno screenplay, but Young Adult is very different in tone. Juno MacGuff was extremely likable, but Mavis Gary (Theron) is anything but. She's selfish and doesn't consider anyone worthy of her time. She barely functions as an adult and is in all likelihood an alcoholic. The title refers to the fiction she writes for the teen market, but her series has run its course and she's writing the final installment.When she receives an email showing that her ex-boyfriend, Buddy (Wilson), is married and has recently become a father, all she can think about is going to her old home town to win him back. The fact that he is happily married is a minor convenience. After all, she has baggage too.Mavis makes the trip back to Mercury, Minnesota and calls Buddy. They arrange to meet the following evening so she visits a bar on her own the first night she's in town. It's there that she runs into Matt Freehauf (Oswalt), who had the locker next to her in high school. He was the victim of a hate crime in school because a group of thugs thought he was gay. It turns out that he wasn't, but it's left him unable to walk without using a crutch.Matt becomes an outlet for Mavis and he's used as a device to show the audience how deranged Mavis really is. She's not shy about announcing her intentions to wreck Buddy's marriage and steal him away. Matt casually informs her that she's mentally ill. The two form a kind of friendship which is aided by Matt's ability to brew alcohol and her need to talk about Buddy and stay permanently drunk.As you can tell, Young Adult isn't a typical comedy. Most romantic comedy has a likable woman pursuing a man, with the two ending up together and living happily ever after. This film is more of a character study than a traditional comedy. You'll laugh at Mavis because she's so outrageous and completely clueless about the negative impact she has on other people. You'll never really root for her, but something makes you want to see what she is going to do next.There is some small ray of hope for Mavis at the end of the film. She may not achieve what she sets out to do, but she does have an epiphany about her depressing existence. As usual, Reitman and Cody come up with a few surprises. Whatever you think of Mavis, you'll probably agree that the film is well-made and intelligently written. Some of the observations are funny, while others are sad, but they all fit the characters and feel authentic.Theron does a good job of appearing unlikable. We even see how Mavis transforms herself from a virtual zombie who can barely function into a woman attractive enough to get Buddy's attention. Mavis might not be a woman that you will like or recognize, but she's never boring. Oswalt's portrayal of Matt is vital and the film wouldn't work without it. He's funny, but his acting ability also gives him a convincing vulnerability. He's very honest about his flaws and he's a character that is easy to like.On first viewing, I gave Young Adult 4/5. After two further viewings, I'll raise that to 4.5/5. It doesn't have Ellen Page or George Clooney to help place it among my absolute favorite films, but I'm very happy to own it.The Blu-ray presentation is very good. Detail is strong and I didn't detect any weak points. The audio does exactly what it is supposed to, but the film is driven by dialogue and you won't be blown away by the sound. if you liked the film in theaters, the Blu-ray is worth picking up. With an audio commentary and more than an hour of special features, it's a good overall package.",5,Another good entry from Reitman and Cody,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,4259,"['Young', 'Adult', '2011', 'Comedy', 'Drama', '94', 'minutesDirected', 'Jason', 'ReitmanStarring', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'Patrick', 'WilsonVideo', 'Video', 'codec', 'MPEG-4', 'AVCVideo', 'resolution', '1080pAspect', 'ratio', '1.78:1Audio', 'English', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1French', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1Spanish', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1Subtitles', 'English', 'English', 'SDH', 'French', 'Spanish', 'PortugueseDisc', 'Single', '50GB', 'Blu-ray', 'DiscThe', 'Film', '4.5/5Jason', 'Reitman', 'first', 'full-length', 'feature', 'was', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'followed', 'Juno', 'Up', 'Air', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'favorites', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'Young', 'Adult', 'theaters', 'consider', 'Juno', 'Up', 'Air', 'be', 'just', 'perfect', 'expectations', 'were', 'sky', 'high.Diablo', 'Cody', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Juno', 'screenplay', 'Young', 'Adult', 'very', 'different', 'tone', 'Juno', 'MacGuff', 'was', 'extremely', 'likable', 'Mavis', 'Gary', 'Theron', 'anything', 'selfish', ""n't"", 'consider', 'anyone', 'worthy', 'time', 'barely', 'functions', 'adult', 'likelihood', 'alcoholic', 'title', 'refers', 'fiction', 'teen', 'market', 'series', 'run', 'course', 'writing', 'final', 'installment.When', 'email', 'showing', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Buddy', 'Wilson', 'married', 'recently', 'become', 'father', 'can', 'think', 'going', 'old', 'home', 'town', 'win', 'back', 'fact', 'happily', 'married', 'minor', 'convenience', 'baggage', 'too.Mavis', 'trip', 'back', 'Mercury', 'Minnesota', 'Buddy', 'arrange', 'meet', 'following', 'evening', 'so', 'bar', 'own', 'first', 'night', 'town', 'Matt', 'Freehauf', 'Oswalt', 'who', 'had', 'locker', 'next', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'victim', 'hate', 'crime', 'school', 'group', 'thugs', 'thought', 'was', 'gay', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'left', 'unable', 'walk', 'using', 'crutch.Matt', 'outlet', 'Mavis', 'used', 'device', 'show', 'audience', 'how', 'deranged', 'Mavis', 'really', 'not', 'shy', 'announcing', 'intentions', 'wreck', 'Buddy', 'marriage', 'steal', 'away', 'Matt', 'casually', 'mentally', 'ill', 'two', 'form', 'kind', 'friendship', 'aided', 'Matt', 'ability', 'brew', 'alcohol', 'need', 'talk', 'Buddy', 'stay', 'permanently', 'can', 'tell', 'Young', 'Adult', ""n't"", 'typical', 'comedy', 'Most', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'likable', 'woman', 'pursuing', 'man', 'two', 'ending', 'up', 'together', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'film', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'traditional', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'Mavis', 'so', 'outrageous', 'completely', 'clueless', 'negative', 'impact', 'other', 'people', ""'ll"", 'never', 'really', 'root', 'something', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'next.There', 'small', 'ray', 'hope', 'Mavis', 'end', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'achieve', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'have', 'epiphany', 'depressing', 'existence', 'usual', 'Reitman', 'Cody', 'come', 'up', 'few', 'surprises', 'think', 'Mavis', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'agree', 'film', 'well-made', 'intelligently', 'written', 'observations', 'are', 'funny', 'others', 'are', 'sad', 'fit', 'characters', 'feel', 'authentic.Theron', 'good', 'job', 'appearing', 'unlikable', 'even', 'see', 'how', 'Mavis', 'virtual', 'zombie', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'function', 'woman', 'attractive', 'enough', 'get', 'Buddy', 'attention', 'Mavis', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'woman', 'will', 'like', 'recognize', 'never', 'boring', 'Oswalt', 'portrayal', 'Matt', 'vital', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'funny', 'acting', 'ability', 'also', 'convincing', 'vulnerability', 'very', 'honest', 'flaws', 'character', 'easy', 'like.On', 'first', 'viewing', 'gave', 'Young', 'Adult', '4/5', 'two', 'further', 'viewings', ""'ll"", 'raise', '4.5/5', ""n't"", 'have', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'George', 'Clooney', 'help', 'place', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'films', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'own', 'it.The', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'very', 'good', 'Detail', 'strong', 'did', ""n't"", 'detect', 'weak', 'points', 'audio', 'exactly', 'what', 'supposed', 'film', 'driven', 'dialogue', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'sound', 'liked', 'film', 'theaters', 'Blu-ray', 'picking', 'up', 'audio', 'commentary', 'more', 'hour', 'special', 'features', 'good', 'overall', 'package']",Young Adult

In the first few minutes of the movie, her character is ingeniously established by showing us glimpses of her morning routine.

She meets an old friend Matt (Patton Oswalt) who she remembers as ""the hate crime kid"" because a group of jocks beat him up believing he was gay. The only thing that was hit harder was Theron's liver who is an excessive drinker.The irony of the film is that Theron is trapped by her own life, but doesn't realize it. She in turn believes ex-bf Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) is the one who is trapped because he is married and is saddled with a kid. Theron projects herself into the main character of her current novel. She has been influenced by the romance authors where the two people who were meant for each other come together in the end although such is not the case in life.The script is as predictable as a low budget Indie.

This is a movie that is not for everyone. While it is a comedy it's not really a laugh out loud/pee your pants comedy. I wouldn't quite call it a dark comedy although that is more accurate. This movie is done by the same writer and director of ""Juno"" so it's that type of comedy. Stuff you shouldn't laugh at and most of the movie you aren't sure if you should laugh or not. All that said I really liked this and the acting was fantastic. Patton Oswalt was great in this and I hope he gets more work like this character. I recommend this, but unless you have seen ""Juno"" it's hard to describe the comedy. Overall, a really good comedy that makes you laugh but feels weird when you do.

1458865,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005FITIK0,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","""Young Adult"" is a comedy drama, but being directed by Jason Reitman - known for ""Thank You for Smoking"" ""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air"" - it is not just an ordinary comedy. With Diablo Cody (who wrote for ""Juno"" in 2007) as a writer, the director shows us life's uncomfortable little truths in a comical, but somewhat disturbing way. To say people don't change is pretty easy, but to watch it on screen is not very comfortable, even though wrapped up in comical dark humor.Meet Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron), a 37-year-old writer (actually a ghost writer) of young adult novels living in a small Minneapolis apartment room with a Pomeranian. Obviously things are not going well for her as the YA series she has been ghostwriting is about to be cancelled.One day she receives an e-mail from Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), her ex-boyfriend now happily married in Mercury, Minnesota, where Mavis came from. And to the e-mail is attached a photo of his newborn daughter. Something deep inside her prompts her to travel back to the place she had left years ago, just to win back her former boyfriend ... or perhaps something else she does not know.The story revolves around a person you may find unpleasant. If you think Julia Roberts' character in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" unpleasant, you may find Mavis ten times more so. Self-absorbed Mavis (listening to an old cassette tape again and again) is a kind of person who never grows up. And if she does, she does it with a price to pay.But somehow I couldn't hate Mavis, mainly because of Charlize Theron's superb performance as Mavis, which is the driving force of the comedy that is always bitter and often dark. What she does is, you may find, either hilarious or annoying (or most likely, both), but her portrayal is very real, which will make some audience feel as if looking into a mirror. Patton Oswalt is also wonderful as Matt, who went to the same high school as Mavis (but she hardly remembers anything about him). The interaction between Mavis and Matt (who has a few things to say to Mavis) is one of the best moments of the film.This is not a film that everyone would enjoy watching, but still proves that Jason Reitman is one of the best directors of his generation.",4,"Not a Comedy Everyone Loves: from Jason Reitman, Director of ""Thank You for Smoking"" ""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air""",1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,2221,"['Young', 'Adult', 'comedy', 'drama', 'being', 'directed', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'known', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'Juno', 'Up', 'Air', 'not', 'just', 'ordinary', 'comedy', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'who', 'wrote', 'Juno', '2007', 'writer', 'director', 'life', 'uncomfortable', 'little', 'truths', 'comical', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'way', 'say', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'pretty', 'easy', 'watch', 'screen', 'not', 'very', 'comfortable', 'even', 'wrapped', 'up', 'comical', 'dark', 'humor.Meet', 'Mavis', 'Gary', 'Charlize', 'Theron', '37-year-old', 'writer', 'actually', 'ghost', 'writer', 'young', 'adult', 'novels', 'living', 'small', 'Minneapolis', 'apartment', 'room', 'Pomeranian', 'Obviously', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'well', 'YA', 'series', 'been', 'ghostwriting', 'be', 'cancelled.One', 'day', 'e-mail', 'Buddy', 'Slade', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'ex-boyfriend', 'now', 'happily', 'married', 'Mercury', 'Minnesota', 'where', 'Mavis', 'came', 'e-mail', 'attached', 'photo', 'newborn', 'daughter', 'Something', 'deep', 'prompts', 'travel', 'back', 'place', 'had', 'left', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'win', 'back', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'perhaps', 'something', 'else', 'not', 'know.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'person', 'may', 'find', 'unpleasant', 'think', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'character', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'unpleasant', 'may', 'find', 'Mavis', 'ten', 'times', 'more', 'so', 'Self-absorbed', 'Mavis', 'listening', 'old', 'cassette', 'tape', 'again', 'again', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'up', 'price', 'pay.But', 'somehow', 'could', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Mavis', 'mainly', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'superb', 'performance', 'Mavis', 'driving', 'force', 'comedy', 'always', 'bitter', 'often', 'dark', 'What', 'may', 'find', 'either', 'hilarious', 'annoying', 'most', 'likely', 'portrayal', 'very', 'real', 'will', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'looking', 'mirror', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Matt', 'who', 'went', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'Mavis', 'hardly', 'anything', 'interaction', 'Mavis', 'Matt', 'who', 'few', 'things', 'say', 'Mavis', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'film.This', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'still', 'Jason', 'Reitman', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'generation']",Young Adult

Yes.

They've both arrived at the same place and are stuck.Diablo Cody has a terrific way of designing characters who are all at once despicable and inspiring (no one wants to end up like Mavis).
