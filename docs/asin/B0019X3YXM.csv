1164906,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B0019X3YXM,Anticlimacus,"[8, 12]","*Spoilers Below*Why does Hollywood feel the need to take classic non-American films and rape them until they're deformed beyond all recognition? It must be nice to make millions of dollars by doing nothing more than crapping on various works of art from other countries. I'm apparently in the wrong line of business.First off, Jesse Bradford sounds like a weasel and gives a mediocre performance. Just watch his reaction after Elisha Cuthbert lies to his teacher - it's terrible. Cuthbert is your typical Hollywood actress under 30 years of age - very hot, but couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Watching her try to be ""sassy"" is incredibly painful because at times her mannerisms are overly accentuated to the point where she looks like she's got a bad case of hemorrhoids. As far as supporting actors go, the guy who played the runaway soldier was dreadful, and the old man near the end was even worse. Ji-hyun Jun's performance in the original was no fluke. South Korea has at least 5 times as much youthful acting talent than the States. That's no exaggeration.This is your typical Hollywood remake that reenacts a dozen or so scenes from the superior original in unimaginative, idiotic ways (ala ""The Departed"") in an effort to pander to the dim-wittedness and xenophobia of your typical American moviegoer who would rather slit their wrists than read subtitles. This is evident in the dialogue, which is way too cringeworthy for its own good. Every single line is opaque, thoughtless, and overly simplified to the point of sheer stupidity. Here are some direct quotes from the film:1. ""Death, man...death sucks!"" 2. ""I like you and the last three days have been some of the most interesting (if not painful) of my life. But my brain is hemorrhaging and my career is ruined and I just think it's better if we part ways."" 3. ""Who would be intrigued by a hot, mysterious, passionate, possibly bipolar, violent, drunken, arrogant, rude woman?"" 4. ""Whatever she was going through - it was beyond anything in my experience and beyond my ability to fix. I had no right to judge her. If I chose to stay with her (knowing the risks) all I could do was give her love and respect and see how the story would end."" 5. ""I'm sorry. He's just a guy my father made me go out with, but every second I was with him I was wishing it was you and that's why I called you tonight - I couldn't take it anymore. Charlie, I need you."" 6. ""Hey kid, is this a subway platform or your own piece of drawing paper?"" 7. ""You know what? I know that you really don't want to hurt me."" 8. ""Yessss, I'm free and I'm loving it. Train where are you. Wooo hooo. Choo choo.""Hollywood translation: ""We resent your lack of intelligence, so we are apparently forced to lower the quality of this film by providing superfluous exposition on the part of the characters for the sole purpose of explaining every little thing to you. You are incapable of extracting emotional content from subtle mannerisms, symbolism, or even the slightest bit of indirect communication. Yes, you are a moron, but if we talentless hacks want to make money, we simply need the characters to verbally and plainly explain every little emotion, lest you become completely lost.""Am I the only one who realizes just how much Hollywood hates its own fans? At least 90% of their films are devoid of any and all subtlety. This is even worse in the case of remakes, because they must knowingly suck every ounce of intelligence out of the original film. Wake up people. You can cut the patronization with a knife. These movies scream, ""You are an imbecile!"" And yes, supporting them does make you an imbecile.Oh, but that's not all. If the insipid, moron-proof dialogue weren't bad enough, this movie drops one of the most idiotic psychological twists humanly imaginable. Our two lovebirds decide to take exactly one year off so Cuthbert can heal her wounds, but she shows up 24 hours late because she needed one more arbitrary day for healing. That's beyond ridiculous. Only a Hollywood executive could think of something this mind-numbingly stupid.The only halfway decent moments in this movie use concepts from the original. There's not a shred of well-executed originality to be found in this steaming pile of excrement. The only positives I can think of are a few pretty camerashots. Hence the 2/10 rating. The only comfort I have is that this vile garbage went direct to DVD. A small victory in the neverending battle against the cinematic dark ages that we Americans currently reside in. Cultural naivety, ignorance, repetition, and incredibly low standards seem to be the favored cinematic ideals around here as of late. However, I must say that the original Korean film is still nowhere to be found at your local video store. One might expect a simultaneous DVD release along with the remake. Such is unfortunately not the case.People wonder why I generally hate Hollywood cinema as much as I do, but I ask you - my dear reader - how can I not? I don't like to be patronized by a bunch of talentless hacks in corporate suits who insult my intelligence by making a movie like this and actually expecting me to like it. Maybe I'm missing something, because everyone else around me finds comfort in this masochistic, self-hating existence. My fellow Americans may be flamboyant cowboys in terms of foreign policy, but in terms of entertainment they are the equivalent of abused housewives who keep coming back for more. Whether its ignorance or sheer stupidity, they just don't know any better.May Hollywood burn in hell for all eternity.

Erland,"[1, 4]","Would you be attracted to a seemingly bi-polar, erratic and extremely domineering young woman (Jordan) you met on a subway just as she was passing out in a drunken stupor? Well you might if she looked like Elisha Cuthbert. That's just what happened for conservative and highly motivated Charlie (Jesse Bradford) and from that moment on he would forever divide his life between the time before he met her and the time after.The '07 American remake of the Korean film of the same name, `My Sassy Girl' is an entertaining though inebriated love story that I like to refer to as `Serendipity' with alcohol.  For the majority of the film the viewer will most likely find themselves in a state of confusion, yet fully intrigued and engaged in to film. You will wonder more than once exactly where the storyline is heading, so much so that the fate of the film depended on a really good ending to weave all the disparate, unanswered aspects of the tale into an acceptable conclusion. Fortunately, the ending does exactly that providing the audience with not only understanding but a bit of unexpected depth.

1164908,A28HB1CS21SRDU,B0019X3YXM,canopy,"[11, 12]","I've seen the original twice.  As a native Korean, I loved the original movie.  It's a laugh-out-loud movie but also a heart-warming romantic comedy, excellently done by the two main actors.  A definite keeper.I was very curious to find out that they've done an American remake of the film.  As the original movie had a very distinct Korean culture, I was excited to see how they've turned it into an American film.  I expected to see much change in the plot but surprisingly there were many familiar scenes.  The scene on the subway and the games that the girl plays were all in the American version.  Even the rose scene which was a significant part in the original movie was kept in tact.  Unlike other reviewers, I was actually disappointed that they kept so many of the original movie.  I'm grateful that the film makers showed respect to the original movie but they forget that the original movie was geared towards a Korean audience which is why the craziness of a cute girl works.  In many Korean films, it is quite common to see a girl's charm manifested in her obnoxious behaviour and such.  But I wasn't convinced of it in the American version.  The girl just was really annoying and I was annoyed with the guy for taking such crap from a crazy girl.I think the movie should've been more Americanized.  It has a such a sweet story to it but the film makers' over sensitivity to the original movie was, in my opinion, a hindrance to recreating this film.  Lakehouse is another movie that was adapted from a very well known Korean film.  They kept the spirit of the original but changed quite a lot of the plot and even changed the characters a little bit, to suit an American audience and look how well that turned out.When a film is being remade, although there should be some homage to the original, the remade movie should still be able to stand on its own.

And there are funny parts, but not based on the now common gross gags or sexual double entendre. But the humor is not the core of the movie. Charlie Bellows is a typical romantic comedy straight man, so it's easy to see where viewers might be misled. Jordan Roark is not the typical inhabitant of a romantic comedy. In fact she's the mystery. What makes her so volatile and emotionally dangerous but compelling?The movie was deeper than I expected with a real reward at the end. I couldn't take my eyes off of Elisha Cuthbert. The story builds somewhat slowly but the nuance is there in Elisha's characterization to explain everything in retrospect. I found her compelling. There was no mystery why Jesse's Charlie Bellows fell in love, despite the Elisha's manic behavior as Jordan.It wasn't the romantic comedy I expected, but it was a rewarding, surprising and oddly compelling drama by the end. I've rewatched it several times and found additional subtlety, emotion and meaning each time. My Sassy Girl was much better than anticipated, and perhaps expectations play a role.Those viewers that saw the original Korean version have vastly different expectations and apparently wanted the same movie in English, and didn't get it.

Ehh, it's just one of the things I do, I guess. There's actually an Indian remake also, and a Chinese sequel - the Korean film was a huge success across Asia - but if they're no better than this, I won't be making an effort to track them down (well, not MUCH effort).  Still, I'd have to guess that the mixture of melodrama and broad comedy that the original film captures so brilliantly is not as foreign to other Asian filmmakers as it obviously was to American director Yann Samuel and screenwriter Victor Levin.Canadian actress Elisha Cuthbert plays the ""sassy"" (read: obnoxious, rude, nearly psychopathic in this film) girl, given a name in this version (""Jordan""), and Jesse Bradford plays her hapless savior/suitor Charlie. It's pretty much a scene-for-scene remake of the original, but transplanted entirely to Manhattan and cut by about 40 minutes, which removes any possibility of the subtleties of the Korean film, particularly in class and gender issues; here we get a much more simplistic contrast between uber-rich girl and struggling from-the-sticks guy.  The fantasy sequences here just seem like throwaways, because Jordan just isn't as well developed as Gianna Jun's character was in the earlier film, and because there is little that is endearing about her until near the end.  The Korean film's lengthy run-time (in the extended version) and use of a wider variety of locations helps give it an almost ""epic"" feel (if a romcom can be epic) and really does help to make the central relationship at least borderline believable. Here we're just racing towards an ending that feels nearly as cliched as the idiotic intro with our intrepic hero's flyover-country parents (the one signficant change from the original, and a poor one).It's not entirely worthless; some of the virtues in the sentimental ending of the first film seem to work against all odds in this gutless remake, and Cuthbert and Bradford are a very, very attractive couple.  But overall...blech.  There are loads of reasons why I'm so attracted to Korean romances, and why most American examples these days are just horrendous, and nearly all of them could be found just by watching these two Sassy Girls.",2,"Not entirely worthless, but it shouldn't make anyone forget the original",1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,2394,"['watched', 'original', 'South', 'KoreanMy', 'Sassy', 'Girl', 'Director', 'Cuta', 'couple', 'weeks', 'sad', 'American', 'remake', 'blew', 'away', 'so', 'why', 'might', 'ask', 'would', 'watch', 'very', 'poorly-reviewed', 'retread', 'Ehh', 'just', 'one', 'things', 'do', 'guess', 'actually', 'Indian', 'remake', 'also', 'Chinese', 'sequel', 'Korean', 'film', 'was', 'huge', 'success', 'Asia', ""'re"", 'better', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'making', 'effort', 'track', 'down', 'well', 'not', 'MUCH', 'effort', 'Still', ""'d"", 'have', 'guess', 'mixture', 'melodrama', 'broad', 'comedy', 'original', 'film', 'captures', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'not', 'foreign', 'other', 'Asian', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'was', 'American', 'director', 'Yann', 'Samuel', 'screenwriter', 'Victor', 'Levin.Canadian', 'actress', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'sassy', 'read', 'obnoxious', 'rude', 'nearly', 'psychopathic', 'film', 'girl', 'given', 'name', 'version', 'Jordan', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'hapless', 'savior/suitor', 'Charlie', 'pretty', 'much', 'scene-for-scene', 'remake', 'original', 'transplanted', 'entirely', 'Manhattan', 'cut', '40', 'minutes', 'possibility', 'subtleties', 'Korean', 'film', 'particularly', 'class', 'gender', 'issues', 'here', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'simplistic', 'contrast', 'uber-rich', 'girl', 'struggling', 'from-the-sticks', 'guy', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'here', 'just', 'seem', 'like', 'throwaways', 'Jordan', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'developed', 'Gianna', 'Jun', 'character', 'was', 'earlier', 'film', 'little', 'endearing', 'end', 'Korean', 'film', 'lengthy', 'run-time', 'extended', 'version', 'use', 'wider', 'variety', 'locations', 'helps', 'give', 'almost', 'epic', 'feel', 'romcom', 'can', 'be', 'epic', 'really', 'help', 'make', 'central', 'relationship', 'least', 'borderline', 'believable', 'Here', ""'re"", 'just', 'racing', 'towards', 'ending', 'feels', 'nearly', 'as', 'cliched', 'idiotic', 'intro', 'intrepic', 'hero', 'flyover-country', 'parents', 'one', 'signficant', 'change', 'original', 'poor', 'one', '.It', 'not', 'entirely', 'worthless', 'virtues', 'sentimental', 'ending', 'first', 'film', 'seem', 'work', 'odds', 'gutless', 'remake', 'Cuthbert', 'Bradford', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'attractive', 'couple', 'overall', 'blech', 'are', 'loads', 'reasons', 'why', ""'m"", 'so', 'attracted', 'Korean', 'romances', 'why', 'most', 'American', 'examples', 'days', 'are', 'just', 'horrendous', 'nearly', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'just', 'watching', 'two', 'Sassy', 'Girls']",My Sassy Girl us

The targeted audience of teen to twenty-somethings was obvious with two castings of the Bring It On actor Jesse Bradford and the popular 24 daughter Elisha Cuthbert.The requests for this one were already pouring in because of the original piece, plus the director from the highly rated Love Me if You Dare made his next film. I'll skip the comparisons between the two films and just try this one on its own merit.The storyline of two young strangers meeting in New York and falling in love appears quite forcefully after a novice storyboard coverage of the main character's early life. Our Cuthbert character plays the strange and mysterious rich girl with a damaged back story we know nothing about. Through the course of their strange meetings, dates or whatever you want to call them, all of the teens watching left the room within 20 minutes. I stuck it out to see if this dysfunctional relationship would become believable. It never really does, and as the love story grew painfully more boring and contrived, the middle-aged ladies gave up watching also.The ending had some heart, but overall the film never materializes into anything enjoyable, believable or rewatchable.

1164927,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0019X3YXM,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","The 2008 ""My Sassy Girl"" is, as you know, a remake of the Korean film of the same title made in 2001. But the remake went straight to DVD in USA, which suggests something is wrong with the film, but you know, Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was almost released straight to DVD instead of getting a theatrical release in America, so you just cannot judge the film by that alone. In the case of ""My Sassy Girl,"" however, my instincts proved right.In ""My Sassy Girl"" Elisha Cuthbert (best known as Kim Bauer in ""24"") plays the titular girl, slightly eccentric and unpredictable Jordan Roark. When good-natured, mild-mannered Charlie Bellow from Midwest (played by Jesse Bradford, ""Bring it on"") meets her on the subway platform in New York City, the girl is terribly drunk and she falls asleep on the bench. As Charlie is a kind guy, he couldn't leave her alone so he carries her (literally) to his room.This is probably a highly unusual (and unlikely) way of getting to know someone else, but the film goes on anyway. Knowing that life with this strange girl is big trouble, Charlie continues to meet Jordan, who keeps cropping up unexpectedly, and virtually sabotages his career. I don't know why, but he thinks she is still attractive and irresistible, so Charlie starts seeing her and falls in love with her.What is refreshing and intriguing in a certain situation doesn't necessarily look the same in another. Ji-hyun Jun's ""sassy girl"" in the original, so full of emotion, interested us because of the cultural background of the heroine and the hero and their reversed power relations between the sexes. Elisha Cuthbert's ""sassy girl"" on the other hand is only implausible and annoying. Her character lacks the soul that the original's sassy girl surely had.Or maybe someone else should be blamed. Yann Samuell, known for his unique and dark romance ""Love Me If You Dare"" (starring Marion Cotillard), is clearly not the best choice for director of this film, of which story includes very melodramatic elements. You need confidence in telling this kind of emotional love story, but judging from his previous effort which looks like darker ""Amelie,"" Yann Samuell's strength lies somewhere else.There are many romantic comedies set in New York City - ""Annie Hall"" ""When Harry Met Sally..."" and the list goes on - and like them the city itself plays a significant role in ""My Sassy Girl"" which is visually alluring. Sadly its soulless narrative lacks the charms and beauty of the photography.",2,Yet Another Remake That We Really Don't Need...,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,2509,"['2008', 'Sassy', 'Girl', 'know', 'remake', 'Korean', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'made', '2001', 'remake', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'USA', 'something', 'wrong', 'film', 'know', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Oscar-winning', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'was', 'almost', 'released', 'straight', 'DVD', 'instead', 'getting', 'theatrical', 'release', 'America', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'film', 'alone', 'case', 'Sassy', 'Girl', 'however', 'instincts', 'proved', 'right.In', 'Sassy', 'Girl', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'best', 'known', 'Kim', 'Bauer', '24', 'titular', 'girl', 'slightly', 'eccentric', 'unpredictable', 'Jordan', 'Roark', 'When', 'good-natured', 'mild-mannered', 'Charlie', 'Bellow', 'Midwest', 'played', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'Bring', 'subway', 'platform', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'girl', 'terribly', 'drunk', 'asleep', 'bench', 'Charlie', 'kind', 'guy', 'could', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alone', 'so', 'literally', 'room.This', 'probably', 'highly', 'unusual', 'unlikely', 'way', 'getting', 'know', 'someone', 'else', 'film', 'anyway', 'Knowing', 'life', 'strange', 'girl', 'big', 'trouble', 'Charlie', 'meet', 'Jordan', 'who', 'cropping', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'virtually', 'career', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'still', 'attractive', 'irresistible', 'so', 'Charlie', 'seeing', 'love', 'her.What', 'refreshing', 'intriguing', 'certain', 'situation', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'look', 'same', 'Ji-hyun', 'Jun', 'sassy', 'girl', 'original', 'so', 'full', 'emotion', 'interested', 'cultural', 'background', 'heroine', 'hero', 'reversed', 'power', 'relations', 'sexes', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'sassy', 'girl', 'other', 'hand', 'only', 'implausible', 'annoying', 'character', 'soul', 'original', 'sassy', 'girl', 'surely', 'had.Or', 'maybe', 'someone', 'else', 'should', 'be', 'blamed', 'Yann', 'Samuell', 'known', 'unique', 'dark', 'romance', 'Love', 'Me', 'Dare', 'starring', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'clearly', 'not', 'best', 'choice', 'director', 'film', 'story', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'elements', 'need', 'confidence', 'telling', 'kind', 'emotional', 'love', 'story', 'judging', 'previous', 'effort', 'darker', 'Amelie', 'Yann', 'Samuell', 'strength', 'somewhere', 'are', 'many', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'list', 'city', 'significant', 'role', 'Sassy', 'Girl', 'visually', 'alluring', 'Sadly', 'soulless', 'narrative', 'charms', 'beauty', 'photography']",My Sassy Girl us
