1398067,A2IR6GNQF5OID6,B004EFCVPE,B. Bates,"[11, 19]","At one point when I was using this DVD, I thought to myself, ""This guy doesn't know what he's doing."" I was frustrated with the lack of accurate counting, the lack of adequate active recovery time, and repetitive nature of using two-arm swings as filler.There are several other things wrong with this DVD.First is the exerciser/client. Her initial form is horrendous with her back arching to do two-arm swings. If anyone is new to kettlebells, and they followed her example, they would have an injured back the next day. She is also working out with a weight that is clearly too heavy for her because by the end of the workout she is using momentum to lift it.Second is that the director/producer/instructor doesn't follow the mirror-rule of exercise DVDs. This is a rookie mistake that many people making DVDs are guilty of. But unacceptable for someone who has been on TV for so many years. The lack of research into this small but integral detail is disappointing.Third is that there is too much talking and a lack of clear direction. The instructor treats this DVD like an impromptu training session not a finely crafted routine that will be performed over and over.Fourth is the lack of customer forethought. I think that encompasses the mirror-rule, the impromptu nature of the session, and the lack of accurate counting. And the instructor is also callous about an exercise that he included in the session that requires a large amount space for moving. He even jokes about hoping that the viewer has a large enough living room to perform the exercise.Fifth is the lack of variety for lower body training. There are no figure eights, and the lunges don't incorporate moving the kettlebell at all. There is also an exercise that requires you to swing the kettlebell along your side and then switch to the other side for more swings, but there isn't a safety cue to mind your knees--ouch.That being said there are some redeeming values to this DVD. It does give you a tough workout, and you will feel it the next day. But this should not be a beginner's introduction to kettlebell exercises.",3,Tough but weak in content,1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,2095,"['one', 'point', 'when', 'was', 'using', 'DVD', 'thought', 'myself', 'guy', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'was', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'accurate', 'counting', 'lack', 'adequate', 'active', 'recovery', 'time', 'repetitive', 'nature', 'using', 'two-arm', 'swings', 'filler.There', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'things', 'wrong', 'DVD.First', 'exerciser/client', 'initial', 'form', 'horrendous', 'back', 'arching', 'do', 'two-arm', 'swings', 'anyone', 'new', 'kettlebells', 'followed', 'example', 'would', 'have', 'injured', 'back', 'next', 'day', 'also', 'working', 'out', 'weight', 'clearly', 'too', 'heavy', 'because', 'end', 'workout', 'using', 'momentum', 'lift', 'it.Second', 'director/producer/instructor', ""n't"", 'follow', 'mirror-rule', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'rookie', 'mistake', 'many', 'people', 'making', 'DVDs', 'are', 'guilty', 'unacceptable', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'TV', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'lack', 'research', 'small', 'integral', 'detail', 'disappointing.Third', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'lack', 'clear', 'direction', 'instructor', 'DVD', 'impromptu', 'training', 'session', 'not', 'finely', 'crafted', 'routine', 'will', 'be', 'performed', 'over.Fourth', 'lack', 'customer', 'forethought', 'think', 'mirror-rule', 'impromptu', 'nature', 'session', 'lack', 'accurate', 'counting', 'instructor', 'also', 'callous', 'exercise', 'included', 'session', 'large', 'amount', 'space', 'moving', 'even', 'hoping', 'viewer', 'large', 'enough', 'living', 'room', 'perform', 'exercise.Fifth', 'lack', 'variety', 'lower', 'body', 'training', 'are', 'figure', 'eights', 'lunges', 'do', ""n't"", 'incorporate', 'moving', 'kettlebell', 'also', 'exercise', 'swing', 'kettlebell', 'side', 'then', 'switch', 'other', 'side', 'more', 'swings', ""n't"", 'safety', 'cue', 'mind', 'knees', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'redeeming', 'values', 'DVD', 'give', 'tough', 'workout', 'will', 'feel', 'next', 'day', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'beginner', 'introduction', 'kettlebell', 'exercises']",Bob Harper: Kettlebell Sculpted Body

SO I decided I needed a full workout and this definitely delivers.  I've never watched Biggest Loser so even though I knew who Bob Harper was, I wasn't aware of his training style.  The DVD delivers.  It moves you through an entire kettlebell workout and he also really focuses on form which is imperative with kettlebells.  You can really hurt yourself if you do not use proper form.  The thing with Kettlebells are that they are more than weights because swinging the bell is a cardio boost.

1398074,A27TQA0XCZUXZY,B004EFCVPE,Feles31,"[5, 13]","I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.CONS:The first ten minutes or so was distracting.  Seemed like the exerciser was in a world of her own, starting a move without direction and continuing the same move when told to change.  After that it smoothed out.Instructor took too much time to explain moves in the middle of the workout (especially the point with the wrist move onward) so whatever cardio you had going is lost.  Better if he broke down moves in warmup portion if they want to ensure you refresh on it every time or, better yet, as separate DVD segment.Overall, just too much time talking (explaining, yes, and valid points perhaps) but it distracts more than it benefits the workout.  More so if you are supposed to use this DVD again and again.  Better he use that time to count and just note a few correct form points on exerciser.Instructor notes that no trainer can count.  For me, one of the major pros of a DVD is that someone will count even reps on each side for you since I hate doing that when I'm sweating buckets.  Better yet, prefer when they count out loud or have a very basic musical beat to follow so you don't have to watch the screen the entire time.  I pretty much will not buy a DVD when some conscientious reviewer notes the reps are uneven.At the end of the workout, the exerciser totally runs out of steam and can barely do the moves.  While I appreciate the real world aspect and the fact that I'm not struggling alone, I much prefer the exerciser keep up a steady beat for me to match (or aspire to) and push myself.PROS:* Really like the moves that made up the routine* No perma-smilesI know about the Biggest Loser but have never really watched it or this trainer. I watched the clips for this routine and liked the moves but was soso on the trainer --- my first impression turned out to be true to form.  Speaking of Biggest Loser, I'm probably the only avid DVD exerciser that is not a huge fan of Jillian (totally subjective but I do not care for her as an instructor, either.)This was my first kettlebell DVD and it inspired me to want to buy another that would give more of what I'm looking for.

I really like this workout and Bob Harper's Kettlebell Cardio drill. I do think that they are mistitled - I get more cardio out of the Sculpted Body and more sculpting from the Cardio drill. While it is not to everyone's taste, I like the format - Bob is training just one exerciser who is not exactly perfect in form. This gives him a chance to correct her and remind the viewer of what correct form is. He has an engaging way about him. I also like the lack of musis.

Everything was perfect.Now, onto the DVD itself.  Wow, I did this workout yesterday and can really feel it today!  I was always intimidated by kettle bells (I mean, the shape...), but decided to take a class at my local martial arts gym where its being offered once a week.  I kind of became obsessed, because this is a workout unlike others!  I run, I weight lift, and do some other exercise dvd's, but kettle bells is different.  You get a total body workout that you can feel the next day...in a good way, the way that you know you worked different muscles!My class is only offered once a week so I decided to get this DVD and a small kettle bell (10 lbs, although I use a 15 lb at the gym) so that I could incorporate another day into my busy workout schedule, and I am glad I did.  Today I feel just like I do the day after my class at the gym!I felt Bob gave great instructions to Stephanie and you could tell she was really working!  What I really liked is that I felt that they were there with me in my living room.  It was not intimidating at all, because kettle bells can be intimidating at first.  Also, I really liked that Bob did most moves with Stephanie and you could tell she was really into.  I loved that there were no obvious breaks in the DVD where they came back looking refreshed and made over, like with most of the DVD's I already own.  She was dripping in sweat at the end, and so was I.  I liked the mix of weights and cardio as well.Obviously I love Bob Harper from The Biggest Loser, but this is my first DVD by him, and I'm seriously thinking I might look at others when my kettle bell obsession wears off.Very enjoyable DVD.

To say he's tough would be an understatement. As a longtime home exerciser, I know that a major downside to using home videos long term is they can get very boring and repetitious, so it's a good idea to have many videos and maybe a few different trainers in your collection. I like the fact that his workouts are a little longer (around 50 minutes). For me, between 30 minutes to 50 minutes is my workout sweet spot: the amount of time I feel like I've worked hard, but not so long I dread even starting it (as in P90X) and not so short I feel like I didn't get in a good workout (like a few of Jillian's). Working out with Bob is no joke. He is not easier than Jillian. He makes you do a lot more reps and because his workouts are longer, I think he's tougher. I'm glad I did Jillian first and and am working out to him now that I'm more fit, instead of the reverse. I do wish this workout was customizable, but that's only a minor issue.The kettlebells are tons of fun. They really change up a workout and strengthen your arms, back, and core in ways dumbbells and your own body weight doesn't. You can NOT substitute dumbbells for kettlebells in kettlebell workouts. They function differently and are weighted differently, so if you don't have a kettlebell, I suggest you pass on this video until you get one. I am a small woman in my mid 30s, am not very experienced with kettlebells but have worked out a long time, and I used a 10lb kettlebell, which seemed just right.

1398079,A359ZQMY6LP10Q,B004EFCVPE,"Linda D. Robinson ""The Queen""","[33, 36]","I don't understand a couple of these negative reviews about this workout, but those reviews are wrong.Let's be honest here, no matter what level you are in exercising, you have to initially start somewhere.  The great thing about this workout is that if you can only do one push up, great, keep at it because eventually you will do better as your endurance grows.  If you can only do 5 swings, keep at it because eventually you will improve as long as you keep at it.Another reason I like this workout is because Bob is using a KETTLEBELL, not a dumbbell.  Some dumbbells can be used for some of the moves, but it does not give you the effect of the move as a kettlebell.  This workout is great on form and instruction, as Jillian Michaels workout had major issues in this area, and I have had instruction from RKC certified instructors and have used kettlebells for over 2 years consistently.Bob works with Stephanie and he keeps the workout flowing, going.  I used a 22#, 25# kettlebell for more of a strength affect.  He incorporates body weight exercises (which are great for you in strength, total body conditioning) with the traditional kettlebell exercises.  He incorporates windmills, snatches, cleans, cleans/press, squats, swings, alternating swings, one arm swings.  All of these if done with a challenging kettlebell will sweat you death, and burn maximum calories while conditioning your body.  Also, using kettlebells works out your core/abdominal area with every swing.  You will see improvement in this area if you are consistent.  Lastly, this is a pure circuit workout which will burn the maximum calories in minimum time.This workout is highly recommended, especially for the beginner to kettlebell workouts.  Also remember, if you want maximum results your nutrition is 50%.  Remember that, if you are not watching your diet, you will not get the results you want.  Can't keep eating that big mac and expect magical results.

1398080,A3K4JPRTIKIVA7,B004EFCVPE,Michelle Way,"[63, 66]","I just did this DVD for the first time this morning and I really loved it.  Bob is his usual motivating and funny self.  I laughed when he said, ""If you're just standing there not doing anything you're not doing what I want you to do"" LOL.  He works out with a woman named Stephanie who is in great shape but clearly struggles during a few of the exercises.  I like that because it is a realistic portrayal of how challenging some of the moves are. He has you do something called sliders (a variation of the push-up) that I have never done before but really liked. I am new to Kettlebell workouts but am so glad I found this one.  I think it would be challenging to even a seasoned person if they used a heavier kettlebell.",5,Great Workout!,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,723,"['just', 'did', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'morning', 'really', 'loved', 'Bob', 'usual', 'motivating', 'funny', 'self', 'laughed', 'when', 'said', ""'re"", 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', ""'re"", 'not', 'doing', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'LOL', 'out', 'woman', 'named', 'Stephanie', 'who', 'great', 'shape', 'clearly', 'struggles', 'few', 'exercises', 'like', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'how', 'challenging', 'moves', 'are', 'do', 'something', 'called', 'sliders', 'variation', 'push-up', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'before', 'really', 'liked', 'am', 'new', 'Kettlebell', 'workouts', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'found', 'one', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'challenging', 'even', 'seasoned', 'person', 'used', 'heavier', 'kettlebell']",Bob Harper: Kettlebell Sculpted Body
1398081,A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ,B004EFCVPE,Peter Tsang,"[26, 27]","""Bob Harper: Kettlebell Sculpted Body"" is an intense workout.  Bob works with Stephanie, who uses one (moderate to medium) weight kettlebell.  I had a 4kg (a little over 8.8 pounds) kettlebell and an 8kg (a little over 17.6 pounds) kettlebell.  Whenever I used the heavier kettlebell, the exercise was intense and my heart rate went up quite a bit and I had difficulty finishing the exercise.  Whenever I used the lighter kettlebell, I could easily do the exercise.Warm up is about 3 minutes, 34 seconds.Workout is about 38 minutes, 3 seconds.Cool-down is about 7 minutes, 2 seconds.Not all the exercises and movements were named, but here is a fairly complete list of the names or descriptions of the exercises.SquatSquat with kettlebell (or bell)High pull with squatHigh pullHigh pull with squatBell swingSumo SquatBell swingPush-upsBell swingOne arm swingAlternating arm swingPush-upJumping jacksPush-upBell/horn practiceSquat with bell/horn movementHaloArm push from chest movementBell holdBell SwingSuitcase swingAlternating suitcase swingCliff scalerCliff scaler with push-upClean (I used a dumbbell, instead of a bell.
