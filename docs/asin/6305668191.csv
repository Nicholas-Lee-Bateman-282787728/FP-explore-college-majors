472418,A2HOM6XN2BABJT,6305668191,Adam,"[0, 0]",The transformation of Goku into a Super Saiyan is my favorite part in the whole series.  I don't know how to describe the feeling.  You really have to see the whole saga because it leads up to this very moment and you'll appreciate it a lot more.  There's lots of extras and a pretty good menu.  I really don't reccomend this unless you've already seen these episodes or you've seen the episodes leading up to it.,5,Goku is finally a SUPER SAIYAN!,1006387200,"11 22, 2001",2001,413,"['transformation', 'Goku', 'Super', 'Saiyan', 'favorite', 'part', 'whole', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'describe', 'feeling', 'really', 'have', 'see', 'whole', 'saga', 'up', 'very', 'moment', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'lot', 'more', 'lots', 'extras', 'pretty', 'good', 'menu', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'reccomend', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'leading', 'up']",N/A

Spoiler ahead:  Frieza has survived Goku's Genki-dama and takes out Piccolo and kills Krillin.  The loss of Goku's life-long friend is the final thread to give him desperation enough to make the transformation into a Super Saiya-jin.  This scene is one of the best in the entire anime.  His power level shoots from 2 million to 20 million in an instant.  He warns Gohan to leave the planet, and take the injured Piccolo with him, for he now has so much power that he does not yet have full control.  While Frieza is at only 12 million, he has experience with such power, and still holds an advantage.  And so begins the final battle between Frieza and Goku.",5,Turning point in Dragonball,996710400,"08 2, 2001",2001,773,"['DBZ', 'DVD', 'transformation', 'Goku', 'Super', 'Saiya-jin', 'defeat', 'conqueror', 'worlds', 'Frieza', 'Spoiler', 'ahead', 'Frieza', 'survived', 'Goku', 'Genki-dama', 'out', 'Piccolo', 'kills', 'Krillin', 'loss', 'Goku', 'life-long', 'friend', 'final', 'thread', 'give', 'desperation', 'enough', 'make', 'transformation', 'Super', 'Saiya-jin', 'scene', 'one', 'best', 'entire', 'anime', 'power', 'level', 'shoots', '2', 'million', '20', 'million', 'instant', 'Gohan', 'leave', 'planet', 'take', 'injured', 'Piccolo', 'now', 'so', 'much', 'power', 'not', 'yet', 'have', 'full', 'control', 'Frieza', 'only', '12', 'million', 'experience', 'such', 'power', 'still', 'advantage', 'so', 'final', 'battle', 'Frieza', 'Goku']",N/A
