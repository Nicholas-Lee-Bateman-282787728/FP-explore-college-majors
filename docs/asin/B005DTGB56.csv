I wasn't that big a fan of the SDF-1 series, the first series in Robotech, but when I saw the Master's Saga I liked the series more. I've been trying to find the Macross series, Super Dimensional Southern Cavalry, but even on Amazon it's sold out. I settled for the Master's Saga and it hasn't been a disappointment.",5,A entertaining series,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,454,"['had', 'first', 'been', 'exposed', 'Robotech', 'Saga', 'back', 'eighties', 'followed', 'later', 'became', 'fan', 'Macross', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'big', 'fan', 'SDF-1', 'series', 'first', 'series', 'Robotech', 'when', 'saw', 'Master', 'Saga', 'liked', 'series', 'more', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'Macross', 'series', 'Super', 'Dimensional', 'Southern', 'Cavalry', 'even', 'Amazon', 'sold', 'out', 'settled', 'Master', 'Saga', ""n't"", 'been', 'disappointment']",Robotech: The Masters Saga

Unlike the others which had full stories with many characters and real dimension to them, this one is just all about Dana and how she always is so gung ho for battle and her motley crew of followers.  No real drama and frankly, Dana is just not that likeable.",2,Skip this one.,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,332,"['lackluster', 'space', 'filler', '1st', '3rd', 'Robotech', 'Wars', 'others', 'had', 'full', 'stories', 'many', 'characters', 'real', 'dimension', 'one', 'just', 'Dana', 'how', 'always', 'so', 'gung', 'ho', 'battle', 'motley', 'crew', 'followers', 'real', 'drama', 'frankly', 'Dana', 'just', 'not', 'likeable']",Robotech: The Masters Saga
