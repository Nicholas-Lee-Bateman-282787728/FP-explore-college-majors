1663486,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00E0KWBE4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","- A disconsolate Emily: ""Thank you for the drink. I don't really drink, so I'm beginning to feel it.""- A concerned Henry: ""...It's ginger ale.""Emily Jones (Autumn Reeser) is an operations manager in Chicago, but that only describes what she does to make ends meet. Who she is, is a book enthusiast and a champion of old buildings. Her fashion taste leans toward vintage. She's an unofficial historical archivist. One of her great joys is coordinating Chicago's annual Thanksgiving parade each year. Except that this year, a financial consultant is hired to rein in the event's expenses.Now a mild plot SPOILER alert.Veteran of watching Hallmark movies that you are, you're clued in to the formula. We both know that 99.9% of the time, there's a happy ending around the corner. So the draw isn't in the destination, it's in the getting there. We know with rock-sure certainty that Emily Jones and that urbane consultant, Henry Williams (Antonio Cupo), will butt heads, what with Emily the sentimental idealist and Henry, the calculating bottom dollar fella. To her horror, he suggests that they charge people to attend the parade. More obstacles? Emily is in a five-year, long distance relationship with a marine biologist, and she's fretting that he hasn't proposed yet. Henry abides by the five date rule (because after five dates, she gets serious and so he bails).There is such a plethora of made-for-television holiday films that get churned out yearly, I've become stingy doling out them 5 out of 5 star ratings. LOVE AT THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE deserves five stars, maybe even more stars, it's that charming and watchable. It truly gets you in the holiday mood. And, by the way, to make it interesting, I've here and there injected mention of several Thanksgiving-themed films I'd watched in years past that did NOT at all get me in the right holiday mood.There's tremendous and undeniable chemistry between Autumn Reeser and Antonio Cupo. The film, in a wise move, opted to not portray Cupo's consultant as someone who requires a massive infusion of heart. Henry was already a good guy, it turns out. We the audience - and Emily - just needed to get to know him better. Okay, that'll be enough gushing about Antonio Cupo - dude's so damn suave and good-looking it's making me resent him.So, stay away from HOME SWEET HOME(1981). It's about an escaped mental patient who runs into a family celebrating Thanksgiving and decides to murder them. It's really not a well done slasher film and when I saw this a few years ago, it ripped me out of that proper festive frame of mind. But there's a fun drinking game in that each time the family encounters car problems, take a shot.Autumn Reeser is why I love this mov-THANKSKILLING (2009) definitely put me off my feed two years ago. It concerns a homicidal turkey itching to embark on a killing spree. Luckily for the turkey, a gang of college kids comes home during the Thanksgiving break. Shot on a $3,500 budget, this movie is, er, fowl. Also, make sure the young 'uns are asleep when you put this on. Don't make the same mistake I did. I'm still paying for that.But Autumn Reeser is why I love this movie. She is utterly captivating. Her character manifests such a joyful spirit and a deep yearning for romance. I think I fell in love with her within the first ten minutes. There are many moments that highlight how sweet and vulnerable she is. And if I had to pick my favorite scenes, they'd have to be Emily and Henry at the six star pizza parlor, Emily's explanation of why she wears vintage clothing (which may be the film's best scene), and the karaoke sequence with the Heart of Glass and Emily's weak (and yet awesome) robot dance. I don't mean to blaspheme by mentioning Audrey Hepburn and Autumn Reeser in the same sentence, but my favorite acting Hepburn did cross my mind whenever Reeser was on camera.There's this welcome retro feel. Watching this is like being swept back to better days, back to when pictures were more innocent and weren't afraid to show those old-fashioned values. And when I say welcome retro feel, I of course don't mean BLOOD FREAK (1972). You may or may not regard this as a Thanksgiving movie but, hey, it's got a serial killer with a mutant turkey head. This lunatic was a more disturbing sight than Joey's shoving his head in that turkey in that one FRIENDS Thanksgiving episode.",5,"""It was the kiss cam - we did not have a choice.""",1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,4375,"['disconsolate', 'Emily', 'Thank', 'drink', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'drink', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'feel', 'concerned', 'Henry', 'ginger', 'ale', 'Emily', 'Jones', 'Autumn', 'Reeser', 'operations', 'manager', 'Chicago', 'only', 'what', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Who', 'book', 'enthusiast', 'champion', 'old', 'buildings', 'fashion', 'taste', 'vintage', 'unofficial', 'historical', 'archivist', 'One', 'great', 'joys', 'coordinating', 'Chicago', 'annual', 'Thanksgiving', 'parade', 'year', 'year', 'financial', 'consultant', 'hired', 'rein', 'event', 'expenses.Now', 'mild', 'plot', 'SPOILER', 'alert.Veteran', 'watching', 'Hallmark', 'movies', 'are', ""'re"", 'clued', 'formula', 'know', '99.9', '%', 'time', 'happy', 'ending', 'corner', 'draw', ""n't"", 'destination', 'getting', 'there', 'know', 'rock-sure', 'certainty', 'Emily', 'Jones', 'urbane', 'consultant', 'Henry', 'Williams', 'Antonio', 'Cupo', 'will', 'butt', 'heads', 'what', 'Emily', 'sentimental', 'idealist', 'Henry', 'calculating', 'bottom', 'dollar', 'fella', 'horror', 'charge', 'people', 'attend', 'parade', 'More', 'obstacles', 'Emily', 'five-year', 'long', 'distance', 'relationship', 'marine', 'biologist', 'fretting', ""n't"", 'proposed', 'yet', 'Henry', 'abides', 'five', 'date', 'rule', 'five', 'dates', 'serious', 'so', 'such', 'plethora', 'made-for-television', 'holiday', 'films', 'get', 'churned', 'out', 'yearly', ""'ve"", 'become', 'stingy', 'doling', 'out', '5', '5', 'star', 'ratings', 'LOVE', 'AT', 'THE', 'THANKSGIVING', 'DAY', 'PARADE', 'five', 'stars', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'stars', 'charming', 'watchable', 'truly', 'holiday', 'mood', 'way', 'make', 'interesting', ""'ve"", 'here', 'there', 'injected', 'mention', 'several', 'Thanksgiving-themed', 'films', ""'d"", 'watched', 'years', 'did', 'NOT', 'get', 'right', 'holiday', 'tremendous', 'undeniable', 'chemistry', 'Autumn', 'Reeser', 'Antonio', 'Cupo', 'film', 'wise', 'move', 'opted', 'not', 'portray', 'Cupo', 'consultant', 'someone', 'who', 'massive', 'infusion', 'heart', 'Henry', 'was', 'already', 'good', 'guy', 'out', 'audience', 'Emily', 'just', 'needed', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'be', 'enough', 'gushing', 'Antonio', 'Cupo', 'dude', 'so', 'damn', 'suave', 'good-looking', 'making', 'resent', 'him.So', 'stay', 'away', 'HOME', 'SWEET', 'HOME', '1981', 'escaped', 'mental', 'patient', 'who', 'family', 'celebrating', 'Thanksgiving', 'murder', 'really', 'not', 'well', 'done', 'slasher', 'film', 'when', 'saw', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'ripped', 'proper', 'festive', 'frame', 'mind', 'fun', 'drinking', 'game', 'time', 'family', 'car', 'problems', 'take', 'shot.Autumn', 'Reeser', 'why', 'love', 'mov-THANKSKILLING', '2009', 'definitely', 'put', 'off', 'feed', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'homicidal', 'turkey', 'itching', 'embark', 'killing', 'spree', 'Luckily', 'turkey', 'gang', 'college', 'kids', 'home', 'Thanksgiving', 'break', 'Shot', '3,500', 'budget', 'movie', 'er', 'fowl', 'Also', 'make', 'sure', 'young', ""'uns"", 'are', 'asleep', 'when', 'put', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'did', ""'m"", 'still', 'paying', 'that.But', 'Autumn', 'Reeser', 'why', 'love', 'movie', 'utterly', 'captivating', 'character', 'manifests', 'such', 'joyful', 'spirit', 'deep', 'yearning', 'romance', 'think', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'highlight', 'how', 'sweet', 'vulnerable', 'had', 'pick', 'favorite', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'Emily', 'Henry', 'six', 'star', 'pizza', 'parlor', 'Emily', 'explanation', 'why', 'vintage', 'clothing', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'best', 'scene', 'karaoke', 'sequence', 'Heart', 'Glass', 'Emily', 'weak', 'yet', 'awesome', 'robot', 'dance', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'blaspheme', 'mentioning', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Autumn', 'Reeser', 'same', 'sentence', 'favorite', 'acting', 'Hepburn', 'did', 'cross', 'mind', 'whenever', 'Reeser', 'was', 'camera.There', 'welcome', 'retro', 'feel', 'Watching', 'being', 'swept', 'back', 'better', 'days', 'back', 'when', 'pictures', 'were', 'more', 'innocent', 'were', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'show', 'old-fashioned', 'values', 'when', 'say', 'welcome', 'retro', 'feel', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'BLOOD', 'FREAK', '1972', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'regard', 'Thanksgiving', 'movie', 'hey', 'got', 'serial', 'killer', 'mutant', 'turkey', 'head', 'lunatic', 'was', 'more', 'disturbing', 'sight', 'Joey', 'shoving', 'head', 'turkey', 'one', 'FRIENDS', 'Thanksgiving', 'episode']",Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade

It's perfect, full of fun, comedy, good actors, a Chicago backdrop, with lots of old fashioned style romance and conflict, exuding sexual tension without being vulgar or blatantly sexual.Countdown to the Thanksgiving Parade.  The sentimental heroine, Emily(Autumn Reeser), is in charge of coordinating it, but by order of the city, she must work with, better said, contend with a handsome development consultant,""jerk"", Henry(Antonio Cupo), who is set on doing drastic changes in order to make the parade solvent.Heads butt immediately between the two.  She determines to convince him of the worth of the parade as is.  What ensues is a series of funny romantic situations that the two constantly find themselves stuck in.Several problems, of course, exist(*Alert-don't read ahead if you don't want to know absolutely anything about the story's premise*): 1. He's still a ""jerk"" about to sell out the parade; 2. She's has a boyfriend.  He's a marine biologist who's always away, and their relationship of 5 years is mostly via Skype.  They apparently love each other greatly, and he's coming back to propose to her; moreover, she's already bought her wedding dress. 3. Henry has commitment problems, i.e., after the 5th date he breaks up because the woman starts talking marriage.  Her friend sums it up with a true RC maxim: ""Men don't know they want a long term relationship.  That is until they meet the right woman.""  *End alert.*The actors are terrific.  Studly, but not focused on it, Antonio Cupo plays the hero as an organized, calculating planner- self-absorbed, no place to call a home, his past haunts him.  If they gave out Oscars for Best Actress in a RC, it would go to Ms. Reeser.  Her Emily is cute and endearing- energetic, opinionated, deeply felt, she wears vintage clothes from the 50&60's, up for a fight if need be, with a strong front but a deep vulnerable core.  She dreams of only one thing(like many of us want and some of us are blessed to have).  She seeks true love with a lifetime partner through marriage.This film uses every RC trick in the book.

This year, Love at the Thanksgiving Parade wins the pick for &#8220;new favorite.&#8221;Emily Jones (Autumn Reeser) loves her life. Every day she gets to go to a job she loves &#8211; one that is perfectly tailor made for her, and sneaks in Skyping time with her marine biologist almost-fianc&eacute;, Brian in-between his travels and busy work schedule. A Chicago native and cop&#8217;s daughter, Emily thrives on being the best at her job as a coordinator for the annual parade with a specialty in knowing all the historical details and this year, it seems nothing could ruin her happiness&#8230; that is until Henry Williams (Antonio Cupo) comes along. Henry&#8217;s job is to close out places that aren&#8217;t earning the city any revenue and despite their less-than-cordial encounter, Emily and Henry are about to be paired off as working colleagues since part of his job as an independent consultant is being tasked with figuring out if the parade is still worth the resources and time it demands.You already know that I really loved this movie from the opening comments so I suppose now what I&#8217;ll ramble about is the &#8220;why&#8221; behind loving this telefilm&#8230; although other than saying this film was superior, I&#8217;m not sure what more to say! Judging by its seasonal genre, I am not sure when the last time was that I fell head over heels for a Christmas flick. Certainly up until now nothing has topped the sweet stories of 'The Christmas Card' or 'A Princess for Christmas' however this film held its own and one viewing later, I knew that again Hallmark had scored another winner. Too many films &#8211; particularly televised ones, rush their story and leave the audience feeling (partially) cheated out of a full circle concept. This one had a nice pace and the progression seemed very &#8220;easy&#8221;&#8211; both for the story line and the characters.This script was really fantastic. It added in some unique quirks that sought to blend the worlds of contemporary and vintage and fortunately, the filmmaker&#8217;s vision worked just right. Many of the scenes do a stupendous job of putting us in mind of the 40's/50&#8217;s era with its taste for vintage fashion, settings &#8211; Emily&#8217;s apartment and her determination that books are far more original than a download (see, this girl is awesome) and an adorable heroine whose goal for living in the past is to feel close to her mother, which brings me to the characters. They were so delightful&#8230; and fun&#8230; and special. Henry&#8217;s wealthy businessman persona was portrayed convincingly well by Antonio whom I&#8217;d not seen in anything before, yet thoroughly enjoyed as a leading man (he reminded of a young Peter Gallagher). Autumn pulled off a beautiful vintage look and with exception to one or two ensembles which looked horribly misplaced, she sported all of the cloths with snazzy style &#8211; and I applaud designers for putting together such a complimentary wardrobe. These two were also adorable together (did I already mention this?); I mean, their chemistry is infectious &#8211; they made fighting fun with plenty of sparks and it was sweet seeing the care and time Henry took to help Emily overcome some of her fears, basically, we find ourselves waiting for their next moments together.Though filmed in Canada, the Chicago setting was different, making the location somewhat unique to most films that are either in a small town or the big cities of the west and east coasts. Adding in the conflicting personalities of the characters (modern world vs. the old soul) was also something that added a memorable back-and-forth proving that cute &#8220;flirting&#8221; doesn&#8217;t always have to entail a bad vs. good scenario. Eventually, the conclusion may be one of those things that viewers have a hard time accepting as realistically satisfactory, however speaking for myself, this film is possibly the best holiday script I&#8217;ll watch this year.

This heartwarming love story set around the Thanksgiving parade in Chicago centers around Emily, the Thanksgiving Parade Coordinator and Henry the handsome consultant hired to cut costs.  These two likable characters at opposite ends, argue and banter beautifully as sparks and tension fly between them.  The music and the occasional split screen, highlights Emily and Henry's angst and turmoil for each other. This gem of a film is reminiscent of successful romantic films of the 60's. When Emily's fiancee of five years returns, it thickens the plot resulting in twists and surprises. The vintage attire worn by Emily throughout the film is charming and exemplifies the character's love for the past, propelling her to protect the city's history and annual Thanksgiving parade. Autumn Reeser as outspoken Emily gives a performance that is funny, vulnerable and adorable! ""Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade"" is sheer delight and acted with great comedic pacing.
