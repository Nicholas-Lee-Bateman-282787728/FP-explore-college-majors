923704,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000A88EV4,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Mike Leigh is that type of director who seems to love his characters.  He loves to allow the audience to come to know them from afar almost, building delicately as the actors flesh out the intricacies that most directors may overlook.  There is an effortless flow to most of his works (at least the ones that I have seen) that you can't help but respect the approach that Leigh takes to creating an easy naturalistic atmosphere.`Naked' almost feels like it was directed by a different personal altogether.There is an awareness that is too present in `Naked', a self-awareness that hurts the film's impact.  It is far too aware of the impact that it is trying to make, so it becomes somewhat self-indulgent and off-putting.  Maybe that was the point, but it also plays against the film as a whole.  It doesn't help that there isn't much of a connective story here, just some random conversations over the course of a night out for a rapist fleeing a vengeful family.  I'm not against films that feature no actual arcs but focus heavily on character development, but sadly the central character isn't interesting enough to validate this approach.  The supporting characters are all far more intriguing and actually develop more insightful and poignant looks at the human psyche.Many have toted David Thewlis's performance as one of the best of the year that was 1993, some even saying it is one of the best performances put to film.  I give that a bit of a shrug.  It is far too `on the nose'.  That's not to say that it isn't interesting from a certain angle, but overall it doesn't leave one with the intended impact.  Peter Wight and Lesley Sharp are far more ingrained in their characters and thus leave the viewer with a more impactful feeling.  Sharp especially glues this film together, for it is her at times silent observations that cement the film in some sort of emotional focal point.The whole concept of Ewen Bremner's character, Archie, is a major downfall for the film for it tries to give the story an arc and fails to feel connected to the rest of the film.  It serves as a yin and yang for Johnny (Thewlis's character) but not in a cohesive way.  Johnny is a rapist, but mentally haphazard and arguably harmless (or at least he is painted this way), while Archie is a cruel and demented psychopath.  It doesn't add anything to the film and actually takes away from the heart of the film because it cheapens it.Not to mention, Bremner's performance is gross.At the end of the day, I see why some appreciate this film, but I can't fathom why anyone would laud it.  It doesn't know how to balance out its parts and so it comes off unfocused and somewhat forgettable.",3,"Honestly, it's not naked enough...",1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,2679,"['Mike', 'Leigh', 'type', 'director', 'who', 'love', 'characters', 'allow', 'audience', 'come', 'know', 'afar', 'almost', 'building', 'delicately', 'actors', 'flesh', 'out', 'intricacies', 'most', 'directors', 'may', 'overlook', 'effortless', 'flow', 'most', 'works', 'least', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'respect', 'approach', 'Leigh', 'creating', 'easy', 'naturalistic', 'atmosphere.', 'Naked', 'almost', 'feels', 'was', 'directed', 'different', 'personal', 'altogether.There', 'awareness', 'too', 'present', 'Naked', 'self-awareness', 'film', 'impact', 'far', 'too', 'aware', 'impact', 'trying', 'make', 'somewhat', 'self-indulgent', 'off-putting', 'Maybe', 'was', 'point', 'also', 'film', 'whole', ""n't"", 'help', ""n't"", 'much', 'connective', 'story', 'here', 'just', 'random', 'conversations', 'course', 'night', 'out', 'rapist', 'fleeing', 'vengeful', 'family', ""'m"", 'not', 'films', 'feature', 'actual', 'arcs', 'focus', 'heavily', 'character', 'development', 'sadly', 'central', 'character', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'enough', 'validate', 'approach', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'intriguing', 'actually', 'develop', 'more', 'insightful', 'poignant', 'looks', 'human', 'psyche.Many', 'have', 'toted', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'year', 'was', '1993', 'even', 'saying', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'put', 'film', 'give', 'bit', 'shrug', 'far', 'too', 'nose', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'certain', 'angle', 'overall', ""n't"", 'leave', 'one', 'intended', 'impact', 'Peter', 'Wight', 'Lesley', 'Sharp', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'ingrained', 'characters', 'thus', 'leave', 'viewer', 'more', 'impactful', 'feeling', 'Sharp', 'especially', 'film', 'together', 'times', 'silent', 'observations', 'cement', 'film', 'sort', 'emotional', 'focal', 'point.The', 'whole', 'concept', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'character', 'Archie', 'major', 'downfall', 'film', 'give', 'story', 'arc', 'feel', 'connected', 'rest', 'film', 'yin', 'yang', 'Johnny', 'Thewlis', 'character', 'not', 'cohesive', 'way', 'Johnny', 'rapist', 'mentally', 'haphazard', 'arguably', 'harmless', 'least', 'painted', 'way', 'Archie', 'cruel', 'demented', 'psychopath', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'film', 'actually', 'away', 'heart', 'film', 'it.Not', 'mention', 'Bremner', 'performance', 'end', 'day', 'see', 'why', 'appreciate', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'laud', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'balance', 'out', 'parts', 'so', 'unfocused', 'somewhat', 'forgettable']",N/A
923705,AR0TPKBRIOECO,B000A88EV4,Azzan,"[0, 0]","NAKED is not an easy watch for most viewers. But it is not that should discredited after one screening either. This Mike Leigh masterpiece is one you'd have to look at more than once to get the point(s). You really have to delve to catch the main character's drift, and that of the others--main and supporting.Johnny (played by should-have-been-Oscar-winner David Thewlis) is drilling mad about the &#34;ghost world&#34; that is post-Thatcher England, and does not hesitate to voice it. Though he communicates through [supposed] non sequitur words and actions. (Similar to Enid in the Terry Zwigoff adaptation of GHOST WORLD). In addition, the late Katrin Cartlidge's performance as Sophie makes you want to take her and hold her in consolation. Louise, Johnny's ex (played by Lesley Sharp) shows that independent women do not have to be strong-willed to the point of pride. Plus, she is a picture who Johnny wants in a woman--though he never says so out loud. Greg Cruttwell's Sebastian shows how cowardly men (and women) tend to be when they want so desperately to be &#34;clothed&#34; in superiority and grandeur. And the consequences of not taking off that mask.Thanks to the essays accompanying the Criterion Collection copy, the first viewing of NAKED does not have to be the last or one of many before connecting to story and characters.Imagine. Johnny is the driving student that Scott (in HAPPY-GO-LUCKY) would have loved to have. In fact, NAKED in a sense does on a darker note what HAPPY-GO-LUCKY would do on a bright and sunnier note fifteen or so years later. Johnny is &#34;too mad&#34; (as some may put it); Poppy is &#34;too glad.&#34;Introverts of the world, who notice how bad, ugly, phony, and a drag modern society is yet seek better, NAKED is the film to see, share, and try to relate to. Not since DO THE RIGHT THING or CRASH has a film been so brutally honest. Mike Leigh is without a doubt the UK filmmaker of and beyond his age.

His co-stars Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp also contributed strong performances.The commentary track in this set is fascinating and thoroughly enhanced my appreciation of what I already considered a masterpiece.I can't remember if a comment I read (or maybe heard in the commentary) about Johnny was made by Thewlis or Leigh, but it was that Johnny is a character that is just a little too clever for his own good. Take the sarcastic bitter side of John Lennon without the hope and you've got a miserable man- that's Naked's Johnny all over. Although we see Johnny do some horrible things, he is also an idealist who is enraged by how far the world (and probably he himself) falls short of his expectations.I'm glad Criterion is giving this film the presentation it deserves.",5,An incredible character study,1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,1184,"['DVD', 'release', 'film', 'way', 'overdue', 'concur', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Thewlis', 'outstanding', 'film', 'say', 'least', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'award', 'given', 'what', 'often', 'vicious', 'character', 'Thewlis', 'character', 'Johnny', 'was', 'not', 'surprising', 'Oscars', 'ignored', 'performance-', 'Academy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'allow', 'endorse', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'Safe', 'Milk', 'co-stars', 'Katrin', 'Cartlidge', 'Lesley', 'Sharp', 'also', 'contributed', 'strong', 'performances.The', 'commentary', 'track', 'set', 'fascinating', 'thoroughly', 'enhanced', 'appreciation', 'what', 'already', 'considered', 'masterpiece.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'comment', 'read', 'maybe', 'heard', 'commentary', 'Johnny', 'was', 'made', 'Thewlis', 'Leigh', 'was', 'Johnny', 'character', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'clever', 'own', 'good', 'Take', 'sarcastic', 'bitter', 'side', 'John', 'Lennon', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'got', 'miserable', 'man-', 'Naked', 'Johnny', 'over', 'see', 'Johnny', 'do', 'horrible', 'things', 'also', 'idealist', 'who', 'enraged', 'how', 'far', 'world', 'probably', 'short', 'expectations.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Criterion', 'giving', 'film', 'presentation']",N/A
923708,AROTQNRZ51CUU,B000A88EV4,Brendan A. MacWade,"[2, 2]","The 1990s were better than the 80s overall for cinema.  Not to give a history lesson, but the rise of the new independent market in 1989 (Miramax, Sex Lies & Videotape, etc.) led to  large number of successful independent films (the most since the 1970s).  When this film debuted at Cannes, in May of 1993, the decade was still finding itself (I use 1991-2000 as the scientific definition of the 1990s).I think this incredibly well-made drama is a true 90s film.  There had been a few up until that point.  I would use The Double Life of Veronique (1991), Unforgiven (1992), Hard Boiled (1992), Short Cuts (1993), as great examples of the best of early 90s cinema.  And this film in particular is so well put together, that it is the first film I mention when someone asks me to indentify the best english-language films of the 90s.Briefly stated, Naked is an incredibly well acted, well shot, and perfectly executed drama about transient people and how they interact in the digital age.  That alone must sound pretentious.  And when I first saw Naked on Criterion laserdisc in 1994, I thought the same thing.  But then the film simply grew on me.  This is a drama that demands that the audience sympathize with a brilliant-yet-brutal drifter of a man, Johnny, created and portrayed by the gifted David Thewlis.  Further complicating things for the audience, Johnny is from Manchester, a region of England that is not too well understood, even among Londoners.  But this film quickly makes you acquainted with Johnny and where he's from through the dialogue, which was put together by director Mike Leigh and his actors through intensive rehearsals and improvisations (making this film all the more remarkable).  They created these characters, the start point, and the end point as a team.  And it is an extraordinary work of art.This film felt ultra-contemporary when it was new, and it still seems fresh today.  It was very well shot by Dick Pope, who has been Mike Leigh's DP ever since Life is Sweet (1991).  It features high-contrast day and night shots, revealing a London we seldom see in color films today.  Some shots - the 'catering carts' shot and the Johnny 'apocalypse monologue' in the office building in particular are  stunning.Mike Leigh is not a filmmaker I would compare to Rainer Werner Fassbinder, but his dark themes and stagy dramatic elements in this film sure do come close to an urban Fassbinder film.  Like Fassbinder, Leigh  is both a playwright and filmmaker.  Each time you watch this movie, a new theme, icon, cultural or historical reference reveals itself.  This isn't Lost or a Rush album cover, but there are more than enough little bits for thinking audience members to chew on and discuss.This film is somewhat experimental, in that it throws a lot at you in just over two hours.  It is not entirely realistic in that the topics the characters discuss are not usually what real people talk about when they first meet.  But I think that makes this movie all the more fascinating.  It is a real thinking person's movie - a true 21st century drama.  And you can immediately tell how much each actor was directed to construct their characters as much as possible.  Mike Leigh has his story take shape mainly through rapid and clever dialogue, and what a sweeping picture his actors' words create.  This is a movie about people without a home.  It is a simple yet rare theme in movies.Johnny moves through London in a scenario loosely inspired by The Odyssey.  His journey takes him through over 30 sleepless hours, and 4 long conversations (or monologues if the other party is bewildered by his complexity).  But unlike The Odyssey, where our hero comes back to where he started to vanquish a villain, Johnny comes back to his odyssey's start point to meet another brutal, albeit wealthier version of himself.  That man, played by writer/director/producer Greg Crutwell (in his acting debut), is simply one of the greatest villains of the 90s, in my opinion.  His Jeremy/Sebastian character is at once unusual, unique, evil, awkward, brutal, and simply wonderful to watch.  Hollywood remembers great 90s villains played by Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Spacey, and Ed Harris, among others.  But I will never forget this guy (he's an alt-villain, perhaps).  It is a real stroke of genius that Mike Leigh would construct the film so that the two male protagonists are essentially variations of the same theme (brilliant mind, brutal towards women, masochistic, perhaps suicidal), which allows this film to build layers and layers upon itself and the audience without hitting viewers on the head to pay attention to any one of the themes being thrown at them.  It takes multiple viewings to understand and appreciate Naked.The editing and the film's score come together wonderfully.  Mike Leigh totally went outside his comfort zone to do many scenes that propel this multi-themed story forward (I think this movie set a record for number of shots and scenes in a Mike Leigh film).  Again, it feels fresh and crisp today as it wowed Cannes in 1993 (where Leigh took home best director honors, and David Thewlis was crowed best actor).  You just have to see it in order to understand what an amazing accomplishment it is.  Some scenes will sound like Montey Python.  Other scenes will feel like older Mike Leigh movies or plays.  And still other sequences are unlike anything Leigh had done before.  But the end result is Leigh's darkest and one of his very best works.  A must for any 90s collection.  And a truly visionary, risk-taking film that tries to dissect western civilization.....""in a quirky sort of way.""",5,One Of The Greatest Films Of The 1990s,1260230400,"12 8,

923709,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000A88EV4,Christopher Culver,"[0, 0]","Mike Leigh's 1993 film NAKED is a drama on sexual relations -- how men hurt women, how some women accept that hurt out of low self-esteem and a desire to be wanted or supported. It is distinguished by its remarkably lifelike characters. Most of the film was worked out in improvisations for several months before shooting began. Leigh wanted his actors to create elaborate back stories for their characters, fully living inside of them so that when the cameras started rolling they would be completely convincing.As the film opens, Johnny (David Thewlis) has to flee Manchester after a sexual encounter with a married woman turns into rape and she threatens to set her husband after him. Stealing a car, he heads to London to crash at his ex-girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp), gets involved with her flatmate Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge), and spends a couple of nights homeless in London. Interspliced with this are scenes of Jeremy, a rich real estate broker whose sexual conquests serve as an upper-class counterpart to Johnny's own. Naturally the viewer is led to wonder what will happen when these two men meet.Something is wrong with Johnny, he answers anything said to him with a rambling torrent of words, a logorrhea that is a form of intellectual bullying; this deeply wounded man seems to feel the best defense against the cruelties of the world is a good offense. Only 27, Johnny is so wasted that he is taken for much older. In this, Thewlis's performance is one of the masterful screen portrayals of an eccentric or mentally ill person, like Dustin Hoffmann in RAIN MAN or Peter Sellers in BEING THERE.But all of the characters here are memorable, and my thoughts have often gone back to them in the time since I saw this film. I do have reservations about the plot, inasmuch as the last scenes of the film (which were decided only late in the filmmaking process) too suddenly change the tone and may seem anticlimactic. Nonetheless, I would recommend this film and believe it a great one in spite of its undeniable flaws.The Criterion Collection edition of this film is ample. The audio commentary track features Leigh, Thewlis, Cartlidge (and so must have been recorded before Cartlidge's death in 2002), and gives many details of the back stories that Leigh had his actors create. There's Leigh's 1987 short film ""The Short and Curlies"", where Thewlis plays a nerdy young man whose continual repartee might be seen as a prototype for Johnny.A less worthwhile extra is an interview with film critic Neil LaBute, which is not especially interesting or informative.  There is also the godawful American trailer, with its American advertising voice actor, cheery music that never appears in the film, and a series of one-line bits of dialogue that make the film seem like a conventional comedy.",4,Memorable for its characters that are so lifelike that you feel like you know them deeply,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,2802,"['Mike', 'Leigh', '1993', 'film', 'NAKED', 'drama', 'sexual', 'relations', 'how', 'men', 'hurt', 'women', 'how', 'women', 'accept', 'hurt', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'desire', 'be', 'wanted', 'supported', 'distinguished', 'remarkably', 'characters', 'Most', 'film', 'was', 'worked', 'out', 'improvisations', 'several', 'months', 'shooting', 'began', 'Leigh', 'wanted', 'actors', 'create', 'elaborate', 'back', 'stories', 'characters', 'fully', 'living', 'so', 'when', 'cameras', 'started', 'rolling', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'convincing.As', 'film', 'Johnny', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'flee', 'Manchester', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'married', 'woman', 'rape', 'set', 'husband', 'Stealing', 'car', 'London', 'crash', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Louise', 'Lesley', 'Sharp', 'involved', 'flatmate', 'Sophie', 'Katrin', 'Cartlidge', 'couple', 'nights', 'homeless', 'London', 'Interspliced', 'are', 'scenes', 'Jeremy', 'rich', 'real', 'estate', 'broker', 'sexual', 'conquests', 'serve', 'upper-class', 'counterpart', 'Johnny', 'own', 'Naturally', 'viewer', 'led', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'meet.Something', 'wrong', 'Johnny', 'anything', 'said', 'rambling', 'torrent', 'words', 'logorrhea', 'form', 'intellectual', 'bullying', 'deeply', 'wounded', 'man', 'feel', 'best', 'defense', 'cruelties', 'world', 'good', 'offense', 'Only', '27', 'Johnny', 'so', 'wasted', 'taken', 'much', 'older', 'Thewlis', 'performance', 'one', 'masterful', 'screen', 'portrayals', 'eccentric', 'mentally', 'ill', 'person', 'Dustin', 'Hoffmann', 'RAIN', 'MAN', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'BEING', 'THERE.But', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'memorable', 'thoughts', 'have', 'often', 'gone', 'back', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'reservations', 'plot', 'inasmuch', 'last', 'scenes', 'film', 'were', 'decided', 'only', 'late', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'too', 'suddenly', 'change', 'tone', 'may', 'seem', 'anticlimactic', 'Nonetheless', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'believe', 'great', 'one', 'spite', 'undeniable', 'flaws.The', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'edition', 'film', 'ample', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'features', 'Leigh', 'Thewlis', 'Cartlidge', 'so', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'Cartlidge', 'death', '2002', 'many', 'details', 'back', 'stories', 'Leigh', 'had', 'actors', 'create', 'Leigh', '1987', 'short', 'film', 'Short', 'Curlies', 'where', 'Thewlis', 'nerdy', 'young', 'man', 'continual', 'repartee', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'prototype', 'Johnny.A', 'worthwhile', 'extra', 'interview', 'film', 'critic', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'not', 'especially', 'interesting', 'informative', 'also', 'godawful', 'American', 'trailer', 'American', 'advertising', 'voice', 'actor', 'cheery', 'music', 'never', 'film', 'series', 'one-line', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'conventional', 'comedy']",N/A

Does genius preclude or cause madness? Most people can't see the dots to connect them unlike geniuses who are able to see the bigger picture. Naked is a film that is as direct and honest as its title suggests.Mike Leigh's portrait of London is a drab, grungy one filled with desperate lonely souls and dirty, rubble-strewn streets - the antithesis of the warm, romanticism of Richard Curtis movies like Notting Hill. There is nothing romantic about Naked and it is Johnny's cynical worldview that dominates the film and is one of its most intriguing aspects. Naked is one of the most important films to come out in the 1990s. It is an angry howl of protest against Margaret Thatcher's `80s England.The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Mike Leigh and actors David Thewlis and Katrin Cartlidge that was taken from the previously released laser disc. This is a smart, extremely informative track with excellent comments from all the participants.Also included is the original theatrical trailer.The second disc features ""Neil LaBute on Naked."" The director of Your Friends and Neighbors (1998) discusses what he likes about Leigh's film: the relationships between people living in a city like London and how they don't quite connect with one another.""The Art Zone: `The Conversation'"" features novelist Will Self interviewing Leigh in March 2000 for a BBC arts show. Self comes off as pretentious at times (especially when he talks about his own work) but does have some spot-on observations like when he describes Leigh's work as being ""spiritual"" in nature.Finally, there is ""The Short and Curlies,"" a short film Leigh made with Thewlis and Alison Steadman in 1987 about a romance between a hairdresser's daughter and a young man. This is a whimsical comedy and certainly a sharp contrast to the future Leigh-Thewlis collaboration, Naked.",5,"A tough, uncompromising view of London",1127433600,"09 23, 2005",2005,2067,"['been', 'said', 'fine', 'line', 'genius', 'madness', 'certainly', 'epitomized', 'protagonist', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'Naked', 'scathing', 'uncompromising', 'portrait', 'angry', 'young', 'man', 'genius', 'preclude', 'cause', 'madness', 'Most', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'dots', 'connect', 'geniuses', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'bigger', 'picture', 'Naked', 'film', 'direct', 'honest', 'title', 'suggests.Mike', 'Leigh', 'portrait', 'London', 'drab', 'grungy', 'one', 'filled', 'desperate', 'lonely', 'souls', 'dirty', 'rubble-strewn', 'streets', 'antithesis', 'warm', 'romanticism', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'movies', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'nothing', 'romantic', 'Naked', 'Johnny', 'cynical', 'worldview', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'films', 'come', 'out', '1990s', 'angry', 'howl', 'protest', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', '80s', 'England.The', 'first', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'actors', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'Katrin', 'Cartlidge', 'was', 'taken', 'previously', 'released', 'laser', 'disc', 'smart', 'extremely', 'informative', 'track', 'excellent', 'comments', 'participants.Also', 'included', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer.The', 'second', 'disc', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'Naked', 'director', 'Your', 'Friends', 'Neighbors', '1998', 'what', 'Leigh', 'film', 'relationships', 'people', 'living', 'city', 'London', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'connect', 'one', 'Art', 'Zone', 'Conversation', 'features', 'novelist', 'Will', 'Self', 'interviewing', 'Leigh', 'March', '2000', 'BBC', 'show', 'Self', 'off', 'pretentious', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'own', 'work', 'have', 'spot-on', 'observations', 'when', 'Leigh', 'work', 'being', 'spiritual', 'nature.Finally', 'Short', 'Curlies', 'short', 'film', 'Leigh', 'made', 'Thewlis', 'Alison', 'Steadman', '1987', 'romance', 'hairdresser', 'daughter', 'young', 'man', 'whimsical', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'future', 'Leigh-Thewlis', 'collaboration', 'Naked']",N/A

923715,A3Q33Y0V8M1GNL,B000A88EV4,Jeff the Zombie,"[3, 3]","My first contact with Mike Leigh's film Naked came with a series of soundbites that DJ's at the University of Maryland's college radio station had sampled and turned into station ID's. These included several monologues by David Thewlis' frustrated and angry protagonist, Johnny, including his rants about the coming apocalypse. This prompted me to seek Naked out on VHS, and I was both troubled and fascinated by Leigh's film.Nearly twenty years later, Criterion has released naked on Blu-Ray, for the first time giving me the chance to see the film as it was intended. I'm struck by the composition and stark cinematography -- both of which hold up remarkably well, whereas many other films from the 1990's do not. And although the film documents a very specific time at the turn of the century in economically-depressed post-Thatcher England, it is still very relavent today.Naked centers around Johnny, a young man from Manchester fleeing the repercussions of an act of brutality that occurs within seconds of the film's opening. He arrives in London, where he calls on his ex-girlfriend and her flatmate, developing a physical relationship with one as he longs for a romantic relationship with the other.We then follow Johnny through the next forty-eight hours of his life, drifting through nighttime London and disrupting the lives of the various people he encounters until he inevitably returns to his ex-girlfriend's flat. Johnny's odyssey is at once satirical, tragic and so unflinchingly brutal that it becomes difficult to watch.There is also a parallel storyline involving the owner of the flat, an affluent sociopath named Jeremy who is perhaps one step away from American Psycho's Patrick Bateman. Both Johnny and Jeremy are brutal to the women they meet, but are fundamentally different. Although the consequences of their behavior on the women they encounter is the same, their motivations are diametrically opposed. Without Jeremy, it would be impossible for the audience to have any compassion for Johnny.Much has been made of Naked's misogyny, but I think it's important to understand the distinction between documenting misogyny and condoning it. Naked doesn't justify such behavior, but lays it bare for the audience to see. It may not be pleasant, but it's a part of human life that should be examined and discussed.The film is in the middle in terms of getting the ""Criterion treatment"" -- besides offering up a solid HD transfer, it includes an interview with American director Neil Labute (In the Company of Men) about the film, who has also been charged with misogyny for his own cinematic studies of the dark side of masculinity, a thirty minute interview with Leigh recorded for the BBC, a commentary track featuring the director and some of the actors, and the original theatrical trailer (which makes Naked look like a relationship comedy). The extras all help to enlighten Leigh's motivations for making the film, but lack the ""film school in a box"" quality of other Criterion releases.If you're coming to Naked as a fan of Leigh's other films, particularly those centered around family dynamics, I think you should be aware that this film is very different from his other work. It dispenses with his usual ensembles and almost solely focuses on a single character. However, if you're interesting into delving into the psyche of one angry and embittered young man and seeing how he effects the people around him, then Naked is definitely worth your time.",5,A Portrait of the Misogynist as a Young Man,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,3484,"['first', 'contact', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'film', 'Naked', 'came', 'series', 'soundbites', 'DJ', 'University', 'Maryland', 'college', 'radio', 'station', 'had', 'sampled', 'turned', 'station', 'ID', 'included', 'several', 'monologues', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'frustrated', 'angry', 'protagonist', 'Johnny', 'including', 'rants', 'coming', 'apocalypse', 'prompted', 'seek', 'Naked', 'out', 'VHS', 'was', 'troubled', 'fascinated', 'Leigh', 'film.Nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Criterion', 'released', 'naked', 'Blu-Ray', 'first', 'time', 'giving', 'chance', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'intended', ""'m"", 'struck', 'composition', 'stark', 'cinematography', 'hold', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'whereas', 'many', 'other', 'films', '1990', 'do', 'not', 'film', 'documents', 'very', 'specific', 'time', 'turn', 'century', 'economically-depressed', 'post-Thatcher', 'England', 'still', 'very', 'relavent', 'today.Naked', 'centers', 'Johnny', 'young', 'man', 'Manchester', 'fleeing', 'repercussions', 'act', 'brutality', 'seconds', 'film', 'opening', 'London', 'where', 'ex-girlfriend', 'flatmate', 'developing', 'physical', 'relationship', 'one', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'other.We', 'then', 'follow', 'Johnny', 'next', 'forty-eight', 'hours', 'life', 'drifting', 'nighttime', 'London', 'disrupting', 'lives', 'various', 'people', 'inevitably', 'ex-girlfriend', 'flat', 'Johnny', 'odyssey', 'once', 'satirical', 'tragic', 'so', 'unflinchingly', 'brutal', 'difficult', 'watch.There', 'also', 'parallel', 'storyline', 'involving', 'owner', 'flat', 'affluent', 'sociopath', 'named', 'Jeremy', 'who', 'perhaps', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Johnny', 'Jeremy', 'are', 'brutal', 'women', 'meet', 'are', 'fundamentally', 'different', 'consequences', 'behavior', 'women', 'encounter', 'same', 'motivations', 'are', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'Jeremy', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'audience', 'have', 'compassion', 'Johnny.Much', 'been', 'made', 'Naked', 'misogyny', 'think', 'important', 'understand', 'distinction', 'documenting', 'misogyny', 'condoning', 'Naked', ""n't"", 'justify', 'such', 'behavior', 'bare', 'audience', 'see', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'pleasant', 'part', 'human', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'examined', 'discussed.The', 'film', 'middle', 'terms', 'getting', 'Criterion', 'treatment', 'offering', 'up', 'solid', 'HD', 'transfer', 'interview', 'American', 'director', 'Neil', 'Labute', 'Company', 'Men', 'film', 'who', 'also', 'been', 'charged', 'misogyny', 'own', 'cinematic', 'studies', 'dark', 'side', 'masculinity', 'thirty', 'minute', 'interview', 'Leigh', 'recorded', 'BBC', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'director', 'actors', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Naked', 'look', 'relationship', 'comedy', 'extras', 'help', 'enlighten', 'Leigh', 'motivations', 'making', 'film', 'lack', 'film', 'school', 'box', 'quality', 'other', 'Criterion', 'releases.If', ""'re"", 'coming', 'Naked', 'fan', 'Leigh', 'other', 'films', 'particularly', 'centered', 'family', 'dynamics', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'work', 'usual', 'ensembles', 'almost', 'solely', 'single', 'character', 'However', ""'re"", 'interesting', 'delving', 'psyche', 'one', 'angry', 'embittered', 'young', 'man', 'seeing', 'how', 'effects', 'people', 'then', 'Naked', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time']",N/A

However, if one is looking for rich, life-like, and carefully crafted characters than this film will satisfy and appeal to people who appreciate realistic and witty dialogue, interesting and complex relationships and very convincing performances.The relationships that are manifested through this work of art are also carefully crafted to perfection as well; a film with a total of four main characters drives this film's run time of (128 minutes) into what feels like a nano second.Our beloved protagonist, Johnny, will garner the majority of the attention and rightfully so because he is so entertaining and easy to fall in love with; Johnny is raw, incredibly intelligent, witty, voluble, gregarious and highly charming. Johnny is a mere vagabond; a drifter; a true conversationist in every sense who converses with people on all different levels of society; he is a criminal on the run and yet so attractively likable.The consequence of this criminal act moves Johnny like a magnet to it's opposite pole, or in this case, to Louis's flat in London (Johnny's ex-girlfriend)After being invited inside by Sophie, one of Louise's roommates. It is here that we are delightfully invited into Johnny's outlook on life, time, space, technology and human nature.The owner of the flat, Jeremy, is about as despicable and chauvinistic as a male can get. This is more plainly manifested through his treatment of women and material possessions. To Jeremy, women are less than material objects but are designed for humiliation and sexual abuse. He interchanges women faster than a politician exchanges handshakes at a campaign rally. Jeremy's brief appearances are powerful as he abuses his role as a landlord with impunity as well as dominating women with his wealth. His complete disregard for people's privacy along with his general outlook on life is appalling and highly disturbing indeed. Jeremy's character is immediately and appropriately defined when he is receiving a massage from a woman and candidly asks her, ""do you think women like getting raped""?Jeremy's distasteful traits are further enhanced when he shares the same space with Sophie. Unlike Louise, Sophie is mentally weak and submissive but strikingly attractive in her own quirky sort of way as Jeremy confesses to her.  Sophie lives very much in the present or day-to-day sort to speak. She is by far the least dominating character in the film. Her attraction to Johnny is instantaneous and his interaction with Sophie truly exposes her neediness and emotional attachment.Louise is the alpha female of the flat. She is the only female who is able to directly challenge Jeremy's personality. Her relationship with Sophie can be best described as delicately calculated. They are not close in any emotional sense, more like an economical one, but nonetheless, they make the best of living with each other. Interestingly enough, there relationship evolves into something a little deeper when Jeremy feels it necessary to spend the night.The relationships between these four main characters are captivating because all of their performances are convincing and seem so very real. Observing Johnny's interaction with people is entertaining and very enlightening; no one is left unscathed when sharing the same space with him, not even the mentally unstable.  The real power in this film lies in the main character, Johnny, and the director's ability to invoke sympathy and compassion for a man who has committed such a horrid criminal act of rape.By the end of the film we forget about Johnny's mistakes, in fact, we are so interested in Johnny's past life and where the forces of nature will take him that we don't want to see him leave.  It is quite saddening actually. Initially, Johnny begins with a clear concrete destination, towards the end of the film, he becomes a free-floating leaf during a fall breeze in the streets of London once again because According to Johnny, he has an infinite amount of places to go, but it's where he stays is the problem.On a side note, I feel it would be unfair not too mention the beautiful score to this film by Andrew Dickson, another masterpiece from start to finish.

Dreary settings and encounters with a variety of sad characters transform Johnny's bleak rants into an indictment of sorts against England's rotting welfare state.

923720,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000A88EV4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[32, 33]","Having seen this movie upon its release in 1993, I remember seeing a tough, brutal little picture with a great leading performance by David Thewlis.  I didn't actually remember liking it, however.  Thirteen years later, I've had the pleasure of revisiting Mike Leigh's ""Naked"" in its Criterion issue.  And being older and more savvy, I've discovered the film as if it were my first time viewing it.  And what a lot of pleasures there are to be had in ""Naked.""First, David Thewlis is brilliant!  The ferocity of his performance captivated audiences around the world and won him Cannes and other acting honors, but no Oscar nomination.  I would contend that if this movie were released now, with Mike Leigh and David Thewlis better known and respected, the outcome would have been much different.  All the performers bring a realness to the film that make it so effective, but it is Thewlis's show.Thewlis's Johnny is a despicable human being.  He is rude, violent, petulant, unwashed, selfish, and totally at odds with anything even resembling humanity.  He proceeds to make his way through London meeting up with various characters each more loathsome or desperate then the last.  It is a bleak portrait, at best.  Every woman, inexplicably, is drawn to Johnny.  I mean--what a catch, huh?  Some might label the film misogynistic, and it's treatment of women isn't glamorous--but I'd contend that the men are all ogres as well which helps balance things out.So why is this movie great?  Sounds like a nasty piece of work (and it is).  But aside from the blistering performances, the film is scathingly and brutally funny.  The impeccably literate script actually has something to say about the modern world, about philosophy, about the human condition.  It's a tremendously smart black comedy.  And Johnny becomes one of the most well-spoken and funny antiheroes in modern movie history.  It's refreshing for a movie that is so brutal and tough to be so intelligent as well.  And for all you despise about Johnny, there will be a grudging respect too.  You understand why people are drawn to him.I've thought about this film many times since I rewatched it last week, and now I've felt compelled to add my two cents here.  Check it out.

923721,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000A88EV4,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[11, 13]","Mike Leigh generates the ideas for his films through intense reflections on an original idea that interests him.  Through his cerebral process and in corporation with the cast, he fleshes out the characters and the story around the conceptual idea, which brings both filmmaker and cast together into an enlightening experience.  Before shooting the film, both Leigh and the cast can identify themselves with the characters to the very essence of their being, which offers a deeper and more meaningful character.  Thus, Leigh centers most of his film on himself, as the idea originates within him. This is also the case with Naked.The title that Leigh applied to his 1993 cerebral mesh of cinematic cynicism does tangibly imply the notion of self-exposure.  Even though it might, and does, suggest a physical display of the human anatomy, the title, more accurately, provides an allusion towards the complete revelation of the character, Johnny (David Thewlis), in the film.  Naked offers an absolute exposure of Johnny's thoughts, values, and other accumulated information both assimilated and adapted throughout a lifetime.  Nothing is too sacred, or secret, in Leigh's film, which viciously displays Johnny's contempt for society as a whole.  The contemptuous mood of the film filters through Johnny's personal confessions with strangers and outsiders, which seemingly rests within the highly intelligent, but mutilated mind of Johnny.  In a sense, this confessional approach of telling the tale of Johnny, functions almost like a personal purging of Leigh's own implacable characteristics.A dark and secluded alley strikes the audience's retina in the initial scene.  The sporadic light in the alley exposes some of the bare red brick and a little of the dirty cement underneath.  The camera shakily and swiftly advances through the narrow alleyway accompanied by the intensifying sound of carnal lust.  A rapid succession of frames moves the audience closer to a man and a woman that, at first, seem to express their shameless desires for one another, when suddenly the man turns violent and grabs the woman's throat and wrist.  He continues his repeated hip thrusting motion while the woman begins to whimper and begs him to stop.  Abruptly, the man ceases his defilement of the woman, which gives the woman an opportunity to escape.  This man is Johnny.From the brief, yet disturbing opening, the audience quickly discovers the dark side of Johnny, as he truly becomes the antihero. Most viewers will deem Johnny after his actions, as a spineless beast without moral fiber that deserves the worst possible punishment.  This is a notion that Johnny seems to be highly aware of, as he consequently steals a car and escapes the possible repercussions of social shame and the possibility of severe punishment.  However, what trigged Johnny to commit this vile act nourishes the curiosity, as he does have a strong sense of what is right and wrong.The lengthy cinematic rationalization of Johnny begins when he seeks refuge in London, where an old girlfriend becomes his last opportunity for temporary sanctuary.  Antagonistically, Johnny thrusts his hostile and negatively skewed perspective of life on all that enter his existence such as the ex-girlfriend, Louis (Lesley Sharp), her roommate (Katrin Cartlidge), Brian the Nightwatchman (Peter Wight), a Scot with a severe tick problem (Ewen Bremner), and the sadistically misogynic Jeremy (Greg Cruttwell).  Everything from childhood trauma with his mother's sinful occupation to religious debates eventually leads into existentialism in regards to predetermined existence exposed by Nostradamus to the big bang theory.  Eloquent criticism oozes out of Johnny's spiteful mouth with intentional scornfulness that forms cerebral depositions in regards to the misery humanity faces.  All of these lengthy viewpoints should be revered and cherished, as Johnny emerges with a conviction similar to Achilles' faith in his own invulnerability.  It gets to the point where Johnny's ridicule of the society becomes intriguingly entertaining while his supreme ego crushes all verbal opposition with articulate and depressing gibberish.Within the strong conviction of his own intelligence an immediate weakness surfaces in Johnny, as he always sees the glass as half full.  One of his strongest and self-supporting comments, ""...you might already have had the happiest moment in your whole life and all you got to look forward to is sickness and purgatory.""  In essence, Johnny's depressing cognitive skills seem to prevent himself from climbing out of the deepest of intellectual pits, as he always pushes himself down with his own negative perspectives while always assimilating newly acquired information to his already pessimistic life philosophy.  Johnny is that kind of person that brings darkness and sickness into the existence, which so many attempt to escape with self-help books and expensive shrinks.  However, Leigh seems to be painfully aware of this notion, as he exuberantly dives into this project to pull out something extremely dark within himself by exorcizing his own cerebral demons by fully exposing himself.Naked opens with a despicable scene, an event that most could never see themselves accomplishing.  Through this scene, Leigh captures self-hatred through Johnny's existence in darkness, shadows, and an environment from which people strive to escape.  Nonetheless, Johnny seeks out these depressive times and places both physically and cerebrally, which the script and mise-en-scene so powerfully displays.  David Thewlis' performance is straight-out spectacular, as he embodies physically, intellectually, and spiritually the archetype for gloominess.  It is a performance that went under the Oscars radar most likely due to its negative content, but nonetheless, Thewlis mesmerizes, antagonizes, and amuses any viewer in any continent.  Lastly, Naked provides a cinematic canvas upon which Leigh freely reveals the darker parts of personal self-reflection, which offers humanity a chance through understanding and deeper contemplation beyond the mere glumness of existence.",5,Brilliant Character Study in Exceptional Film by Mike Leigh...,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,6148,"['Mike', 'Leigh', 'ideas', 'films', 'intense',

Everyone Johnny meets is twisted in some way, and the effect is only heightened by the couple of seemingly sane people the film offers, amongst them Johnny's original love interest played by Lesley Sharp.In one scene Johnny is admitted into an empty office building watched over by a security guard, and rages aloud his dark world-view that includes both time and space, and the illusion of the present, ""But you're not in it now; you're not in it now,"" because the future is constantly kicking the present in the behind.  He is as merciless to a tourettic stutterer as he is ultimately to himself, and Johnny pushes to the very brink of madness in a film that uniquely captures the razor-thin divide between genius and savagery.From a brutal landlord's wonderfully mangled French to another superb performance by Katrin Cartlidge, ""Naked"" stands testament to the sheer raw power and insight that occasionally graces our screens.",5,"Essential, Quintessential, Profound, and Disturbing",1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,1249,"['greatest', 'movie', 'many', 'Americans', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Naked', 'won', 'best', 'director', 'actor', 'Cannes', '1993', 'action', 'Johnny', 'played', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'who', 'London', 'night', 'series', 'encounters', 'abuses', 'vitriolic', 'scorn', 'laced', 'brilliant', 'humor', 'Everyone', 'Johnny', 'meets', 'twisted', 'way', 'effect', 'only', 'heightened', 'couple', 'seemingly', 'sane', 'people', 'film', 'offers', 'amongst', 'Johnny', 'original', 'love', 'interest', 'played', 'Lesley', 'Sharp.In', 'one', 'scene', 'Johnny', 'admitted', 'empty', 'office', 'building', 'watched', 'security', 'guard', 'aloud', 'dark', 'world-view', 'time', 'space', 'illusion', 'present', ""'re"", 'not', 'now', ""'re"", 'not', 'now', 'future', 'constantly', 'kicking', 'present', 'behind', 'as', 'merciless', 'tourettic', 'stutterer', 'ultimately', 'Johnny', 'pushes', 'very', 'brink', 'madness', 'film', 'uniquely', 'razor-thin', 'divide', 'genius', 'savagery.From', 'brutal', 'landlord', 'wonderfully', 'mangled', 'French', 'superb', 'performance', 'Katrin', 'Cartlidge', 'Naked', 'testament', 'sheer', 'raw', 'power', 'insight', 'occasionally', 'screens']",N/A

Mike Leigh's strengths are his ability to demonstrate the 'lives' of working class britons with heaps of wit, charm, cleverness and bits of rather heavy-handed (tho not quite sappy) emotionalism.  He's best when he keeps it light overall whilst making one or two quite heavy points.  The problem with Naked is that it is all about heavy with very little light.  In addition, Mr. Leigh tries but fails to lade his tale with deep metaphorical meaning in the way that the rather hideously bad film The Thief, Cook, Wife and Lover did although without the fantasmagorical posturing, pretension, piffle and puck. In a nutshell this is the tale of a working class Mancunian who is either insane or being driven insane by the workings of his mind.  His problem is that he is too smart for his class (that's breeding, mind), which shows in his glib verbosity and abstruse philosophical riffs which he bundles up in clever entendre and verbal puns.  The problem is that he is speaking university to working class yobs and yobettes which causes him to be alienating and alienated to those he interacts with, rather assaults.  His failure, or inability to connect on a purely personal, human level further damaging his diseased mind which causes him to act out more and so on.  Mr. Leigh attempted to stir in a few different ingredients into his metaphorical stew but he fails to, for instance, demonstrate that the working class protagonist's angry, abusive manner is equivalent to the posh anti-heroe's equally angry abusive behaviour with the difference being only that one can afford to 'pay' for his rapine behaviour while the other must merely take his rapes for free.  I'm uncertain why Mr. Leigh brought that psycho-social angle into the story because he had enough semi-meaningless flux to deal with in the story as it is.  There are other random bits of disconnectedness that I shan't bother to comment upon.  To sum up, this is an interesting but unentertaining, non-thought-provoking movie that is worth watching if you are a big fan of Leigh's movies.",2,"Leigh veered off into thief, wife, lover, cook country and shouldna have",1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,2166,"['unfortunate', 'film', 'actually', 'mostly', 'interesting', 'grate', 'one', 'midway', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'strengths', 'are', 'ability', 'demonstrate', ""'lives"", 'working', 'class', 'britons', 'heaps', 'wit', 'charm', 'cleverness', 'bits', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'not', 'quite', 'sappy', 'emotionalism', 'best', 'when', 'light', 'overall', 'whilst', 'making', 'one', 'two', 'quite', 'heavy', 'points', 'problem', 'Naked', 'heavy', 'very', 'little', 'light', 'addition', 'Mr.', 'Leigh', 'lade', 'tale', 'deep', 'metaphorical', 'meaning', 'way', 'rather', 'hideously', 'bad', 'film', 'Thief', 'Cook', 'Wife', 'Lover', 'did', 'fantasmagorical', 'posturing', 'pretension', 'piffle', 'puck', 'nutshell', 'tale', 'working', 'class', 'Mancunian', 'who', 'insane', 'being', 'driven', 'insane', 'workings', 'mind', 'problem', 'too', 'smart', 'class', 'breeding', 'mind', 'glib', 'verbosity', 'abstruse', 'philosophical', 'riffs', 'up', 'clever', 'entendre', 'verbal', 'puns', 'problem', 'speaking', 'university', 'working', 'class', 'yobs', 'yobettes', 'be', 'alienating', 'alienated', 'rather', 'assaults', 'failure', 'inability', 'connect', 'purely', 'personal', 'human', 'level', 'further', 'damaging', 'diseased', 'mind', 'act', 'out', 'more', 'so', 'Mr.', 'Leigh', 'attempted', 'stir', 'few', 'different', 'ingredients', 'metaphorical', 'stew', 'instance', 'demonstrate', 'working', 'class', 'protagonist', 'angry', 'abusive', 'manner', 'equivalent', 'posh', 'anti-heroe', 'equally', 'angry', 'abusive', 'behaviour', 'difference', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'afford', ""'pay"", 'rapine', 'behaviour', 'other', 'must', 'merely', 'take', 'rapes', 'free', ""'m"", 'uncertain', 'why', 'Mr.', 'Leigh', 'brought', 'psycho-social', 'angle', 'story', 'had', 'enough', 'semi-meaningless', 'flux', 'deal', 'story', 'are', 'other', 'random', 'bits', 'disconnectedness', 'sha', ""n't"", 'bother', 'comment', 'upon', 'sum', 'up', 'interesting', 'unentertaining', 'non-thought-provoking', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'Leigh', 'movies']",N/A
