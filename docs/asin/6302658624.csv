It ranks right up there will Teen Witch as one of the campiest movies of the decade.  This movie has all that goofy, cheesy charm that we've come to expect from 80's comedy.

The only saving grace is Toni Basil as the mother (she has a great bod). Aside from that this whole movie stinks to high heaven.A teenage vampire wants to fit in. He can't even agree with his reflection. He's always arguing at his reflection in the mirror! Let's see 'vampire', 'reflection'....... You see what I mean? Anyway, he forms a band named 'Rockula'.

326256,A200FYUVU6GG4P,6302658624,"J. T. Nite ""mightybjorn""","[24, 24]","For fans of campy cult movies, this is a godsend.  Toni Basil as a horny vampire mom!  Thomas Dolby as a vampire-hunting coffin salesman!  Bo  Diddley as himself!  Not to mention the simple fact that this is an 80's  rock Vampire Musical!Oh, man . . . no one would confuse this with a good  movie, but you can laught at it and with it.  The filmmakers were obviously  going for cheese, and they hit it right on the money.  Dean Cameron (with  his eyebrows in a supporting role) plays a sensitive vampire who's cursed  to fall in love with a girl once every century, only to have a peglegged  pirate beat her to death with a hambone every time.  Can he break the curse  this time?  Can he become the world's first rock 'n' roll 'n' rap  vampire?So much to love here.  The songs, first and foremost: elaborate  production numbers of howlingly so-bad-they're-good 80's tunes and even  some that were *meant* to be funny and are.  Cameron's wise-cracking mirror  reflection, who may be the ghost of Elvis.  Cameron's bat transformation --  a two-foot tall, flatulent goblin.I could go on and on.  If you're  looking for Citizen Kane or Schindler's List, keep looking.

So you can check it out with out having to buy it on VHS and try to find a working VHS player.If anyone is wondering what the guitar that Mona is holding in the first part of the movie its a Casio DG-20.This is one movie that would make it in to my DVD/Bluray collection.I have watched it a few hundred times in the last 20 years or so.,5,Campy but good movie,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,692,"['are', 'great', 'performances', 'Toni', 'Basil', 'Phoebe', 'LaVie', 'Thomas', 'Dolby', 'Stanley', 'bad', 'guy', '.When', 'saw', 'movie', 'early', '90', 'was', 'so', 'love', 'Tawny', 'Fere', 'who', 'played', 'Mona.This', 'fun', 'movie', 'just', 'watch', 'great', 'songs', 'Why', 'not', 'DVD', 'now', 'Bluray', 'dumb.If', 'have', 'Netflix', 'have', 'stream', 'now', 'then', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'out', 'having', 'buy', 'VHS', 'try', 'find', 'working', 'VHS', 'player.If', 'anyone', 'wondering', 'what', 'guitar', 'Mona', 'holding', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'Casio', 'DG-20.This', 'one', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'DVD/Bluray', 'collection.I', 'have', 'watched', 'few', 'hundred', 'times', 'last', '20', 'years', 'so']",Rockula VHS
