1422858,A267U5ACM1VWHW,B004OA684Y,AWR,"[3, 4]","I thought this movie was very interesting and enjoyable but don't think it was amazing.It was good in that it gave a glimpse of a perspective that is rarely portrayed in mainstream movies. That perspective is of a young man raised in a strict muslim household. Evan Ross plays, Tariq, the young man who is trying to adjust and create a new start for himself at college. Despite his attempts, he constantly runs up against symbols of his old world. The film gives background by jumping between the present and flashback's of Ross' character's youth.Ross' performance was good. He aptly portrayed that feeling that most 17 year olds have before entering college: ""this time I'll be who I want to be. This time, I'm going to be cool and like everyone else.""  Unfortunately, a lot of the film was spent brooding for Ross. There were some gem moments where he was able to demonstrate his fantastic acting skills, like when he took his new female friend back to her room or when he made a very touching confession to his sister. It was nice to see him in this movie as I had only seen him in fun fluff like 90210. The child who played young Tariq was also very good.What made this film not amazing for me was the underdevelopment of some of the characters. Tariq's parents were amazing actors who deserved a bit more character development. All we know about the father, to justify his severely strict adherence to islam, was that he ""marched with Malcolm."" In addition, I wish Nia Long had more screen time, not just because she's stunning but because she is an amazing actress and every time she entered a scene in this film, she was great.  I would have also liked to learn more about the racist characters. Danny Glover and the white kid mob seemed to be straight evil characters who lacked complexity.This film was educational and enjoyable but I thought it could have been better.

It looked boring, but I guess last night was I had the right feeling to watch.  Some muslims might say that 'allah' made it so for me to watch!Well, when you are in your right mind to watch a film like this, it did not appear as boring as I assumed, although it still drags to get to the point, although we know one point is to stop people from 'picking on muslims.'  The truth be told, it never really gets to the point until the end, then you realize that should have been the point in this propaganda piece.Islam can be good for the weak minded and those looking to belong to something greater than themselves.  The problem with islam for many and particularly for African-American mulsims is, islam takes you out of concern for the issues of blacks, your mindset as a black, where you are as a black, where you should be going as a black and the black experience in a world dominated by less melaniated enemies.  Instead, your prime concerns as a muslim tend to be worrying about Palestinians (as if they are worried about you), transferring your identity and concerns as a black man onto the concerns and identity of Asian and Asiatics muslim - all while trying to impress them.  By impressing them, it generally means showing them how less black you are and how you can be more like them, be they Arabic or Paki.  Pakis are trying to be like arabs while others will find a Paki muslim and try to be like them if they do not have anyone else.Being a muslim changes the way that you dress.  You go from dressing how you dressed to wearing clothes that have nothing to do with your environment, history or culture.  If has everything to do with Asian muslims, but not America.  You change your name to a so-called muslim name, which is nothing more than a ploy to make you drop who your were so that muslims rule your life.  If you were Chinese, then changing your name erases your culture for Arabia.  If you are African-American, then you are all too proud to change your name by rationalizing that it was a slave name to begin with.  The problem is, you pick up an older slave name while trying to be a part of a larger world in order to gain what every black man is seeking - respect.  You'd better get respect while being black!  If they can't respect for that and only when you become a muslim, then those people you don't need in your life!Too bad the director did not have it in him to do a film about the black experience in America instead of worrying about some Moozlums.  IF they did 911, then SOME of them only got about .0000009897666% taste of what blacks have received while being in the US, so they cannot even complain!  911 was a good time for blacks, as for a brief almost year, blacks were no longer public enemy #1, muslims were.  At the time, whites did not see blacks as bad knowing that blacks never attacked the nation.  Of course years later, the agenda to get back onto hating blacks (just look at any internet, news or celeb 'slip up') and muslims are getting treating with maximum respect.

1422863,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004OA684Y,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","Today is September 11, 2011, a propitious time to view this small scale but important film based on a true story by the writer and director Qasim Basir. It presents in a very underplayed manner the Muslim generation who were also part of the tragedy ten years ago. The film is an excellent reminder of how important it is to view America as a true melting pot, the citizenry of peoples of all races, nationalities, religions - every one who is a part of this country was at one time an immigrant and struggled. It is our history and we need to consider it at all times but especially now.Tariq (played as a young boy by Jonathan Smith and as a young man by Evan Ross - 23 year old son of artist Diana Ross) is from a strict Muslim family: his father Hassan (Roger Guenveur Smith) wears a thobe and taqiyah and is immersed in his religion and culture while his mother Safiyah (Nia Long) wears traditional Muslim hijabs and body covering garments but is not as strict in her beliefs as Hassan,  They also have a daughter Taqua (Kimberley Drummond).  Hassan forces Tariq leave home study  and to go to a Muslim school much against Safiyah's wishes.  At the school he is beaten by a cruel instructor and suffers taunting when he finds interest in a Catholic girl.  Time flips ahead and Hassan is driving Tariq to college where Hassan has demanded a Muslim roommate for Tariq - Hamza (Kunal Sharma) who is a traditional Muslim but when Tariq requests his privacy and to be called T, Hamza willingly complies.  Tariq is clearly in a state of anxious confusion about who he is and how to deal with the demands of his father and the experiences of his Muslim schooling. He attends a class on World Religions taught by professor Jamal (Dorian Missick) who happens to be Muslim and encourages Tariq to embrace his culture: the professor must face the consequences of his religious beliefs with the Dean of the College (Danny Glover). Tariq falls in with an old friend Cedric (Vladimi Versailles) who lives across the hall in his dorm and Cedric introduces Tariq to alcohol and women.  At the height of Tariq's dilemma about his training and discovering who he really is, the September 11, 2001 happens and the campus non-Muslims turn against the Muslims and Tariq must forge his new self image as his beliefs are now openly challenged because of the threat of terrorism.  How he settles into his new existence is the manner in which the film ends - in a very subtle and touching way.The cast is strong, particularly Nia Long and Evan Ross who manage to carry the audience into a place where understanding of differences becomes credible and meaningful.  There are flaws in the film - the musical score is created on electronic keyboards resulting in a rather 'budget conscious' demeaning style, certain characters are not fleshed out enough to be believable, and other characters (the non-Muslims enraged after 911) are portrayed as stereotypes.  But the message is clear and the film helps the viewer understand the difficulty Muslims and other minorities had immediately after 911 ....and still today.  As-Salm Alaikum, wa-laikum as-Salm.

I never doubted his fathers love for him, but he is clearly a strict man.  Tariq is distant with regards to his faith.  In school his muslim roomate is met with the cold shoulder constantly.  Nia Long, his mother, played a good supportng role but we don't see much of her until the climax. The movie picks up about 80 minutes into it where 9/11 occurrs and the campus is in a stir about 'the terrorists'. Tariq's sister and her friend (probably of Arabic descent) find themselves picked on by campus whites. Tariq gets attacked as he is defending them.

Though this could have been an exercise in futility, Evan makes you believe in the character, a true story of the director/writer's experience.When I saw it in San Francisco, the theater had several religious-garbed muslims in attendance. You could feel the anxiety and tension during some of the more controversial parts like a venture into a madrasa and then the American-fear element after 9/11.It is a film that should be part of any theological study or investigation of the muslim tradition.Highly recommend it!",5,Evan Ross Gives a Captivating Performance,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,891,"['8th', 'released', 'indie', 'movie', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'expand', 'body', 'work', 'practically', 'non-verbal', 'performance', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'shape', 'up', 'being.The', 'story', 'two', 'fold', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'journey', 'find', 'religious/spiritual', 'foundation', '2nd', 'part', 'knee-jerk', 'reaction', 'lot', 'muslims', '9/11', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'exercise', 'futility', 'Evan', 'believe', 'character', 'true', 'story', 'director/writer', 'experience.When', 'saw', 'San', 'Francisco', 'theater', 'had', 'several', 'religious-garbed', 'muslims', 'attendance', 'could', 'feel', 'anxiety', 'tension', 'more', 'controversial', 'parts', 'venture', 'madrasa', 'then', 'American-fear', 'element', '9/11.It', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'theological', 'study', 'investigation', 'muslim', 'tradition.Highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[8, 9]","The creator of this film was on ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" and after his interview I immediately wanted to see this film. I hadn't heard much about it--either I missed out on promos or it wasn't advertised very well, and I'm betting on the latter. With major players like Danny Glover, Nia Long and Roger Guenveur Smith, I knew there'd be some great acting. Evan Ross has done an excellent job in every film he's been in no matter how dramatically different they are, from ""90210"" to ""ATL"" to this film.The movie is based on a young boy (Tariq) who is being raised to be Muslim, but he's having such a hard time adjusting because kids (one in particular) are constantly teasing him about being different. The film sorta reminded me of a little boy I went to elementary school with who was a Jehovah's Witness. Clearly that's a different religion, but I immediately recognized the outsider treatment he got for being different. However, instead of just inquisitive children and the occasional mean-spirited joke, his father (Hassan played by Roger Guenveur Smith) was determined to have a Muslim son and sent him to a program to learn more about Muslim culture. I cringed a little bit because I was hoping ""Mooz-Lum"" wouldn't remind me of ""Sleepers."" As much as I loved the latter film, I cringed during the horrible memories those kids had. Thankfully this film didn't go that far, but the treatment he got in that school was horrendous.By the time he'd returned home, he was a different person and wanted nothing to do with being a Muslim. Problem is his father made sure he had a Muslim roommate in college, his Muslim sister was still around wondering why her brother was always mad and one particular female wondered why he seemed so different than everybody else. And then September 11th hit and everything went even crazier.Cons: While I certainly enjoyed the main family and the actors/actresses who played their roles, too many characters were lacking. The college fight scene was faker than the fight in the film ""Daddy's Little Girls."" I wish they would've played that up a little bit more and made us feel like it was really happening. Instead of feeling tense, I was disappointed that the instigators sounded like they were reading from a piece of paper. Dorian Missick (who played Professor Jamal) was really good, too, but I couldn't get into Tariq's neighbor's character. Something was a little too square about his character; I didn't really buy into Cedric (played by Vladimi Versailles) being an antagonist or running with the cool crowd.Pros: The women in the film were really strong, and I didn't know any of them outside of Nia Long. From Tariq's sister Taqua (played by Kimberley Drummond) to the little girl at school Erin (played by Molly Paddock), I thought they did a great job for newbies (on the film scene anyway). But back to Evan Ross, he did such a good job at looking uncomfortable around women that he actually made me uncomfortable watching him. Instead of smiling about his alone time with Ayanna (played by Maryam Basir), I cringed and wanted it to be over quickly--that's a good thing. That means he did a convincing job.I highly recommend this film. I think it would do some good for recreational movie watching as well as in the classroom.",4,Wanted to see this film for awhile now,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,3281,"['creator', 'film', 'was', 'Real', 'Time', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'interview', 'immediately', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'much', 'missed', 'out', 'promos', 'was', ""n't"", 'advertised', 'very', 'well', ""'m"", 'betting', 'latter', 'major', 'players', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Roger', 'Guenveur', 'Smith', 'knew', ""'d"", 'be', 'great', 'acting', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'been', 'matter', 'how', 'dramatically', 'different', 'are', '90210', 'ATL', 'film.The', 'movie', 'based', 'young', 'boy', 'Tariq', 'who', 'being', 'raised', 'be', 'Muslim', 'having', 'such', 'hard', 'time', 'adjusting', 'kids', 'one', 'particular', 'are', 'constantly', 'teasing', 'being', 'different', 'film', 'sorta', 'reminded', 'little', 'boy', 'went', 'elementary', 'school', 'who', 'was', 'Jehovah', 'Witness', 'Clearly', 'different', 'religion', 'immediately', 'recognized', 'outsider', 'treatment', 'got', 'being', 'different', 'However', 'instead', 'just', 'inquisitive', 'children', 'occasional', 'mean-spirited', 'joke', 'father', 'Hassan', 'played', 'Roger', 'Guenveur', 'Smith', 'was', 'determined', 'have', 'Muslim', 'son', 'sent', 'program', 'learn', 'more', 'Muslim', 'culture', 'cringed', 'little', 'bit', 'was', 'hoping', 'Mooz-Lum', 'would', ""n't"", 'remind', 'Sleepers', 'As', 'much', 'loved', 'latter', 'film', 'cringed', 'horrible', 'memories', 'kids', 'had', 'Thankfully', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'treatment', 'got', 'school', 'was', 'horrendous.By', 'time', ""'d"", 'returned', 'home', 'was', 'different', 'person', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'being', 'Muslim', 'Problem', 'father', 'made', 'sure', 'had', 'Muslim', 'roommate', 'college', 'Muslim', 'sister', 'was', 'still', 'wondering', 'why', 'brother', 'was', 'always', 'mad', 'one', 'particular', 'female', 'wondered', 'why', 'seemed', 'so', 'different', 'everybody', 'else', 'then', 'September', '11th', 'hit', 'everything', 'went', 'even', 'crazier.Cons', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'main', 'family', 'actors/actresses', 'who', 'played', 'roles', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'were', 'lacking', 'college', 'fight', 'scene', 'was', 'faker', 'fight', 'film', 'Daddy', 'Little', 'Girls', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'played', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'Instead', 'feeling', 'tense', 'was', 'disappointed', 'instigators', 'sounded', 'were', 'reading', 'piece', 'paper', 'Dorian', 'Missick', 'who', 'played', 'Professor', 'Jamal', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'too', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Tariq', 'neighbor', 'character', 'Something', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'square', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'buy', 'Cedric', 'played', 'Vladimi', 'Versailles', 'being', 'antagonist', 'running', 'cool', 'crowd.Pros', 'women', 'film', 'were', 'really', 'strong', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Tariq', 'sister', 'Taqua', 'played', 'Kimberley', 'Drummond', 'little', 'girl', 'school', 'Erin', 'played', 'Molly', 'Paddock', 'thought', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'newbies', 'film', 'scene', 'anyway', 'back', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'looking', 'uncomfortable', 'women', 'actually', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'Instead', 'smiling', 'alone', 'time', 'Ayanna', 'played', 'Maryam', 'Basir', 'cringed', 'wanted', 'be', 'over', 'quickly', 'good', 'thing', 'did', 'convincing', 'job.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'do', 'good', 'recreational', 'movie', 'watching', 'as', 'well', 'classroom']",N/A
