The dog training scenes were awesome and the way one dog stopped to help another was amazing.  The writer really did a good job in coming up with a new and unique way to rob a bank using the dogs.

1384974,AC1UOIA4ERNS4,B00449C4BQ,"Monty Britton ""crazy about movies""","[9, 10]","Wow!! Finally! The Doberman Gang and The Daring Dobermans are on DVD, and together in one package! Tired of the old VHS tapes from the '80s? Get this great package. The only downside to this two disc release is: it is not ""pressed "" from Warner Brothers. It was made by Warner Brothers and burned on a DVD-R (the purple bottom gives it away) and contains no documentaries on the making of these two films. That is a minor quibble, since I have been waiting years for these to be released on a digital format (DVD) and in anamorphic widescreen (1.78) for the first time on home video.The quality of the prints are pretty good for early '70s films. Still don't know if ""burning"" or ""pressing"" would help with the video looking amazing. After watching poor versions of these over the years, this DVD set IS a sight for sore eyes! Why these films aren't made like regular DVDs with special features is beyond me. They don't make G-rated action movies like these anymore! Got this for about $15 and to me, that's a steal for this double feature. May be corny for some, for me it brings me back to why I like movies in the first place.",5,This double feature looks great for a DVD-R!

1384977,A2ZMH05LYXCVT7,B00449C4BQ,Shaunna Jaynes,"[0, 0]","Who doesn't remember these two 70's cult TV movies. As a little girl I always gravitated towards the beautiful doberman pincher,and I remember every time these movies were on tv, my mom always knew where I was. As an adult now, and still have the love for dogs, I also have  strong feelings for a really good movie along with great acting, these movies  don't have either. The stories are really out of left field. The actors clearly were expelled from acting class,if attended at all. With all this being said, the dogs are unbelievably amazing. Everyone dog lover or not have an appreciation for a well trained dog. Also every DVD collector has at least a handful of cult classic movies,and they probably are not on any Oscar or Emmy list. But  they have always been your favorites, fun to watch,that's why we have them. These two movies are no different. Every movie buff at one time or more root for the bad guy, in this case the bad guys are bank robbing dobermans,in the second movie it picks right up where everyone is trying to catch these dobermans with satchel full of $$$ . I apologize for this review, reviewing these dvd's has me reminiscing about tv viewing as a child. WOW am I old. I have said before that movie reviews is always a very personal opinion. Everyone's taste is different. Anyone who does enjoy these types of 70's movies might also be interested in the movie ""TRAPPED"" about a divorced father trapped in a department store at night with 5 or 6 trained guard dogs,starring James Brolin.
