It is more like a series of tableaux ""inspired"" by 18th century Armenian poet Nova. It is nonetheless fascinating, and should be required viewing for anybody interested not only in Armenian culture but in cinema in general (or, if you wish, the visual arts). This movie has inspired many artists, including some music videos (admittedly not among the arts' highest form), including REM's ""Losing my Religion"" and Deep Forest's ""Sweet Lullaby"". There is a heavy homoerotic subtext to many of the tableaux, and as a matter of fact, Paradjanov would later spent several years in jail in the Soviet Union accused, among other things, of homosexuality. Though released under international pressure, it would take him another 16 years to make another movie, shortly before his untimely death in 1990.",5,Fascinating and unusual film,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,916,"['Color', 'Pomegranates', 'made', '1968', 'also', 'released', 'name', 'Sayat', 'Nova', 'not', 'really', 'conventional', 'movie', 'more', 'series', 'tableaux', 'inspired', '18th', 'century', 'Armenian', 'poet', 'Nova', 'nonetheless', 'fascinating', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'anybody', 'interested', 'not', 'only', 'Armenian', 'culture', 'cinema', 'general', 'wish', 'visual', 'arts', 'movie', 'inspired', 'many', 'artists', 'including', 'music', 'videos', 'admittedly', 'not', 'arts', 'highest', 'form', 'including', 'REM', 'Losing', 'Religion', 'Deep', 'Forest', 'Sweet', 'Lullaby', 'heavy', 'homoerotic', 'subtext', 'many', 'tableaux', 'matter', 'fact', 'Paradjanov', 'would', 'later', 'spent', 'several', 'years', 'jail', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'accused', 'other', 'things', 'homosexuality', 'released', 'international', 'pressure', 'would', 'take', '16', 'years', 'make', 'movie', 'shortly', 'untimely', 'death', '1990']",Color of Pomegranates VHS

Unless you are muslim or wear a scarf around your face, then you won't be at all interested in this pretentious piece of poetry from the bloated and overrated director Sergei Parajanov. It deals with some Armenian poet who wrote under the influence of opium and the film is a testament to the visions he saw. In art direction, and sets, there are passable glimpses, but so what, if it bores us out of our minds or if there is no story involved, then why do we care if we see implacably designed sets?I had a hard time sitting through it and had to forward it because it was just too much. I think Fellini had a better mood in &#34;Satryican&#34; because he emphasized not only set design but at least some method of story telling, however disfigured. But Parajanov, who hails from the mountain regions of the Caucasus, is so accustomed to Soviet film making, which is quite vapid and slow moving, that he does nothing to engage our senses. If I were at a play, then at least I'd attempt to be polite but I must say that this is horrible. An extra on the DVD is Parajanov being interviewed in which he states that, &#34;a director is born&#34;, and shows his elitist self. Then there are clips of him from annoying art festivals from europe, hailing him as the next messiah of film, its all very insipid for non-Parajanov fans.",2,"Nice Images But Who Cares if its Boring?,",1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,1414,"['very', 'boring', 'piece', ""'art"", 'nothing', 'person', 'living', 'west', 'are', 'muslim', 'wear', 'scarf', 'face', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'interested', 'pretentious', 'piece', 'poetry', 'bloated', 'overrated', 'director', 'Sergei', 'Parajanov', 'Armenian', 'poet', 'who', 'wrote', 'influence', 'opium', 'film', 'testament', 'visions', 'saw', 'art', 'direction', 'sets', 'are', 'passable', 'glimpses', 'so', 'what', 'minds', 'story', 'involved', 'then', 'why', 'do', 'care', 'see', 'implacably', 'designed', 'sets', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'sitting', 'had', 'forward', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'Fellini', 'had', 'better', 'mood', '34', 'Satryican', '34', 'emphasized', 'not', 'only', 'set', 'design', 'least', 'method', 'story', 'telling', 'however', 'disfigured', 'Parajanov', 'who', 'mountain', 'regions', 'Caucasus', 'so', 'accustomed', 'Soviet', 'film', 'making', 'quite', 'vapid', 'slow', 'moving', 'nothing', 'engage', 'senses', 'were', 'play', 'then', 'least', ""'d"", 'attempt', 'be', 'polite', 'must', 'say', 'horrible', 'extra', 'DVD', 'Parajanov', 'being', 'interviewed', '34', 'director', 'born', '34', 'elitist', 'self', 'Then', 'are', 'clips', 'annoying', 'art', 'festivals', 'europe', 'hailing', 'next', 'messiah', 'film', 'very', 'insipid', 'non-Parajanov', 'fans']",Color of Pomegranates VHS
381204,A1JCN10T0TPOPH,6303593720,"Esn024 ""esn024""","[3, 4]","The first images I saw in Pomegranates left me thinking, ""there's no way the director can keep this up throughout the whole film!""He can and he does.The entire film is made up of nothing but poetic images.  Acting is almost a non-issue; the only thing the actors in this movie have to worry about is keeping a straight face while staring straight ahead and not moving their heads.  The images are often beautiful and striking in their artificiality, but this will no doubt prove to be overkill for many viewers...  this is definitely not a film to buy blindly; I reccommend seeing it somewhere else first, like in a library.  Personally, the images kept me interested.  Each one seems to be an allegory for something real (the movie is, after all, designed to be an abstract representation of a poet's mind), but while some of the allegories are quite easy to figure out (ie. young Nova picking up a book in one scene, then in the next scene he's surrounded by hundreds of huge books, their pages flapping in the wind), others are very difficult.  It would be very nice for me to have a special commentary feature on a dvd where somebody explains what each scene is supposed to represent.The best way to see this movie is definetely on a big screen on the original 35mm film... the VHS version that I had (Director's Cut released by CONNOISSEUR VIDEO COLLECTION) simply SCREAMED to me for greater detail; Paradjanov doesn't always zoom in on important small details, and the picture quality on the VHS was like all VHSs a bit fuzzy.  From what I heard, the Kino DVD isn't much better, so I don't really know what options there are.(...).I'd like to point out that for one thing, we don't SEE the lamb get slaughtered; the knife is brought to its neck and then we see the hanging dead body of a lamb.  Also, this may come as a surprize to some people, but in the real world lambs actually DO GET slaughtered.  Is it better to turn a blind eye to things we don't like, while hypocritically continuing to eat meat?  As for the allegations of a homoerotic scene, I think that it's a bit of a stretch.  All we see really is one man walking on top of another's back... certainly nothing even remotely pornographic.The only ""innaproproate"" thing I noticed is one scene where a woman's breast is shown.Anyway, I personally liked this film better than Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.  The music wasn't as annoying (bagpipe-like instruments do become annoying after a while), and it seemed to me that Parajanov's final forsaking of the story form was a step in the right direction; in ""Shadows"" I always felt like the story wasn't being told and I wasn't getting to know the characters. Here, since the film is purely symbolic, I didn't feel such a void.One more thing: in the edition that I saw, almost half of the dialogue is not translated with subtitles!  This seems to me to be a very poor effort, either that or there's STILL a conspiracy to censor some things in the film for non-Armenian viewers.Overall, this is reccommended for those who like Tarkovsky (who was a friend of Parajanov), poetry, or have an interest in Armenia... or for those who want to see something REALLY strange!

381205,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,6303593720,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[4, 5]","This is one of those films that you can't make any literal sense about it.  It's all images.  It's like Fellini's Satyricon, Greenaway's Prospero's Books, and, to a lesser extent, Argento's Inferno.  But WHAT IMAGES!  This is a magnificent, breathtaking beautiful, poetic, painterly masterpiece.  You could freeze any frame of this, and they would look like medeval paintings come to life.  Paradjanov did not make many films (the Soviet authorities made life a living hell for him because of his outspoken views on politics and his nationalistic leanings), but the ones that he did will always live.  No one in this world made films like he does.  They are so unique in world cinema.  This is an abstract film about the Armenian poet Sayat Nova.  It is not a literal biographical film.  It is a film that enters into the poet's world.  Many have complained about the transfer by Kino.  It is not great, but the fact that this film has survived at all is a miracle in itself.  And it's Paradjanov's original cut too.  The conditions in which it was made were not very good, so it is possible that the film stock Paradjanov shot on was defective, or very worn.  One little known problem with Soviet filmmaking was that many crews had to share equipment with each other, and that it wasn't the greatest to begin with.  That might be why the film looks faded and old.  But the fact that we have it is magnificent enough.  The documentary, Paradjanov: A Requiem, is very good.  It is not filled with talking heads analyzing Paradjanov's films and life.  Most of the film features Paradjanov himself.  It contains the final interview he did.  He is fully alive and very boisterous during the whole film.  He is still very outspoken about life in the USSR (which was falling apart by the time this film was made), and he is just amazing to behold.  The film has clips from many of Paradjanov's early work, none of which has ever been released here.

381206,A2CV19XK9VI136,6303593720,"""hakob""","[46, 47]","Sergei Paradjanov's THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES (1969) is easily among the most remarkable films produced in the former Soviet Union. Every conceivable aspect of filmmaking-mise-en-scene, color, editing, acting, music and sound effects, settings and costumes-is exploited to create a  sensuous and dense film-poem. The film's tragic vision is balanced by the  director's quirky sense of humor, which comes through in his editing  (objects playfully appear and vanish as if by magic, reminding one of  M&eacute;li&egrave;s' trick films) and the childlike wonder through which the world is  depicted.The film is not a literal biography of its subject, Sayat-Nova  (ca. 1712-1795), but an attempt to evoke the ""inner world"" of the poet and  the environment in which he lived. Sayat-Nova was born in Tbilisi, the  capital of Georgia (which has traditionally contained a sizable Armenian  population). The film evokes popularly accepted notions about his life,  adding imaginative details of its own along the way. Born Harutiun Sayadian  (""Sayat-Nova"" is a pen-name supposedly meaning ""King of Song""), he was  raised by a family of Armenian carpet weavers in Tbilisi. As a young man,  he made his mark as an ""ashugh,"" a kind of troubadour poet peculiar to the  Transcaucasus. He wrote in the three main languages of the region:  Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijani. Appointed court poet by King Irakli II,  he was eventually banished, as legend has it, for falling in love with the  Princess Anna. He then retired to the Haghpat monastery in northern Armenia  before reputedly dying during the sack of Tbilisi in 1795.The visual  style of the film is influenced by Armenian medieval miniatures and the  19th-century Tbilisi folk painters Pirosmani (something of an artistic  saint in Georgia) and Hakob Hovnatanian (a fellow Tbilisi Armenian, like  Paradjanov and Sayat-Nova). In a drastic stylistic break with the  director's previous film, SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS (1964), the camera  rarely moves; rather, Paradjanov creates precisely composed tableaus in  which his characters stand motionless or perform ritualized pantomimes.  Paradjanov himself was a gifted artist, creating hundreds of collages and  sketches, most of which are on display at the Sergei Paradjanov Museum in  Yerevan .Like Fellini, Paradjanov had a talent  for finding remarkable faces to populate his films. Most notable among them  is the popular Georgian actress Sophiko Chiaureli, who played several  roles, including: both the young poet and his beloved the Princess Anna,  the ""Nun in White Lace,"" and the ""Poet's Muse."" She is ravishingly  beautiful both as a male and female, mesmerizing in a wordless performance  that relies entirely on stylized gestures and facial expressions.Although the film is renowned for its unique imagery, the soundtrack is  equally stunning. Fragments of poems and songs by Sayat-Nova are interwoven  with Armenian and Georgian traditional music and sound effects to create a  dense audio montage. Paradjanov, it should be noted, studied music before  entering film school. Also significant is the rich display of material  culture of the Transcaucasian region, including carpets and fabrics,  metalwork, and religious relics. Ancient Georgian, Armenian and Azerbaijani  works of architecture are used as settings, most notably the Haghpat  monastery in the second half of the filmThe film and its director have  had a rocky history. Upon its release in Armenia, the film was refused  distribution in the rest of the Soviet Union until it was trimmed of  several minutes, re-edited and given new Russian intertitles. (The  videotape, fortunately, contains the original ""director's cut."") In 1973,  as part of a political campaign against intellectuals in Ukraine-where the  director had previously worked and where his wife and son still  lived-Paradjanov was arrested and charged with various crimes. Convicted of  homosexuality, he was sentenced to several years of prison in  Dnipropetrovsk, a camp of  ""severe regime."" A bootleg copy of the film was  screened at various film festivals and a campaign was launched in the West  to have him released from prison. Its supporters included film scholar  Herbert Marshall, a group of French film directors and John Updike. After  four years in prison, he was released thanks to international pressure. He  was not able to make another feature until THE LEGEND OF SURAM FORTRESS  (1984). He passed away due to lung cancer in 1990.Kino's video transfer  is identical to the version previously released by Connoisseur Video. The  picture is ""windowboxed,"" meaning that there are black edges around all  four sides of the image to present as much of the original image as  possible, since transferring films to video usually involves cropping a bit  of the sides. The colors are somewhat faded-prints I've seen of the Russian  version have richer color, as does the Japanese videotape. This may be due  to the condition of the print used. However, it's acceptable for now and if  anything, Kino's tape looks slightly sharper than the old Connoisseur tape  due to better quality duplication.Included on the tape is a delightful  10-minute short, ""Hakob Hovnatanian"" (circa 1967) based on the 19th century  Tbilisi-Armenian portrait painter. Paradjanov made this short while working  on POMEGRANATES. Through details in the paintings themselves as well as  costumes, architcture, etc., Paradjanov evokes the colorful atmosphere of  old Tbilisi.To be sure, this film is not for everyone. Some will be  completely baffled, others bored. However, there is no question that  Paradjanov is a true original. Although some will prefer SHADOWS OF  FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS (1964), which has a stronger storyline and dazzling  camera movements, I feel that THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES is his masterpiece.  Along with Tarkovsky, Paradjanov was the greatest Soviet director of the  post-WWII era.",5,A lavishly beautiful film-poem,958089600,"05 12, 2000",2000,5930,"['Sergei', 'Paradjanov', 'THE', 'COLOR',

I also wanted to expand the internationality of my film collection by adding an Armenian film.  I was also interested in learning something about Armenia and the Armenian people.  If you have similar interests, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  I knew this was an ""art"" film, and I tried desperately to keep an open mind, however I could not stomach watching this without the aid of the FF button.  To me this film was quite simply utter trash.  I am not easy to offend; for example I really enjoyed Harvey Keitel in the Bad Lieutenant.  I think I was most sickened by the scenes (implied or actual) of animal abuse.  To be fair, I do think some people can enjoy it, however I think at least three of the following four conditions would have to be met:1) be a fan of poetry with an interest in Armenia2) enjoy homo-erotic human mosaic3) enjoy cruelty to animals4) enjoy art films with little formal plot structureTragically, Parajanov was sent to the gulag for making this film, apparently on trumped up charges of homosexuality.  Watching this film, its not hard to see where the Soviets got the idea.  I wanted to give this film two star in respect for Parajanov, but really one star is sufficiently generous in this case.  Perhaps the lesson of this film is that some feelings are better left surpressed.

The soundtrack is distorted, the subtitling is distractingly coloured and arbitrary, the print is scratchy and washed-out.

Slow, dream-like (but never surrealist), tender, at times confronting - there are very few films that can sit beside this (Syberberg's ""Parsifal"", Anger's ""Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome"", Tarkovsky's ""Nostalghia"", Cavalier's ""Therese"" come to mind).Yes, it needs to be re-issued and given a full restoration.Yes, it's over-priced given the quality of the presentation here.But to refuse to buy it is to deny yourself something very precious.

Unless you are muslim or wear a scarf around your face, then you won't be at all interested in this pretentious piece of poetry from the bloated and overrated director Sergei Parajanov. It deals with some Armenian poet who wrote under the influence of opium and the film is a testament to the visions he saw. In art direction, and sets, there are passable glimpses, but so what, if it bores us out of our minds or if there is no story involved, then why do we care if we see implacably designed sets?I had a hard time sitting through it and had to forward it because it was just too much. I think Fellini had a better mood in ""Satryican"" because he emphasized not only set design but at least some method of story telling, however disfigured. But Parajanov, who hails from the mountain regions of the Caucasus, is so accustomed to Soviet film making, which is quite vapid and slow moving, that he does nothing to engage our senses. If I were at a play, then at least I'd attempt to be polite but I must say that this is horrible. An extra on the DVD is Parajanov being interviewed in which he states that, ""a director is born"", and shows his elitist self. Then there are clips of him from annoying art festivals from europe, hailing him as the next messiah of film, its all very insipid for non-Parajanov fans.",2,Nice Images But Who Cares if its Boring?,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,1398,"['very', 'boring', 'piece', ""'art"", 'nothing', 'person', 'living', 'west', 'are', 'muslim', 'wear', 'scarf', 'face', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'interested', 'pretentious', 'piece', 'poetry', 'bloated', 'overrated', 'director', 'Sergei', 'Parajanov', 'Armenian', 'poet', 'who', 'wrote', 'influence', 'opium', 'film', 'testament', 'visions', 'saw', 'art', 'direction', 'sets', 'are', 'passable', 'glimpses', 'so', 'what', 'minds', 'story', 'involved', 'then', 'why', 'do', 'care', 'see', 'implacably', 'designed', 'sets', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'sitting', 'had', 'forward', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'Fellini', 'had', 'better', 'mood', 'Satryican', 'emphasized', 'not', 'only', 'set', 'design', 'least', 'method', 'story', 'telling', 'however', 'disfigured', 'Parajanov', 'who', 'mountain', 'regions', 'Caucasus', 'so', 'accustomed', 'Soviet', 'film', 'making', 'quite', 'vapid', 'slow', 'moving', 'nothing', 'engage', 'senses', 'were', 'play', 'then', 'least', ""'d"", 'attempt', 'be', 'polite', 'must', 'say', 'horrible', 'extra', 'DVD', 'Parajanov', 'being', 'interviewed', 'director', 'born', 'elitist', 'self', 'Then', 'are', 'clips', 'annoying', 'art', 'festivals', 'europe', 'hailing', 'next', 'messiah', 'film', 'very', 'insipid', 'non-Parajanov', 'fans']",Color of Pomegranates VHS
381211,A3T8Y73DOFUIR6,6303593720,S. Smith-Peter,"[3, 3]","I feel conflicted about this film, which is an exploration of the life of Armenian poet Sayat Nova.  There are some beautiful scenes here, but I felt excluded by the extremely stylized portrayal of the poet's life.  Instead of presenting a sense of his life, we get a series of set pieces that may well have profound meaning to someone who is an expert on Nova, but tells a less expert audience rather little.  One of the reviewers noted that only an Armenian could really understand the movie.  Hopefully this would also include people who deeply studied Armenia.  Even so, I think he or she has a point.  Of course, one could watch this movie purely as an exercise in formalism, but I feel that point of view is rather sterile.  A commentary track by someone who knows Nova's work would have added a great deal.  I was also frustrated by the lack of translation in many places, particularly of the prayers.  I don't know if the translation was done under the Soviets, but I can't think of any other reason not to translate prayers, which make up a lot of the dialogue.Issues of translation are especially problematic in Paradjanov: A Requiem, which is nearly all in Russian, which I know.  There are quite a few places where the translation is simply incorrect.  For example, Paradjanov says of a film that it would be for a great German, which the subtitles give as a grown-up German.  That's like calling the founder of St. Petersburg Peter the Grownup rather than Peter the Great.  There are many gaps in the translation as well.  It seems to be a sloppy rush job.The short feature Hagop Hovnatanian, which explores the life of a nineteenth-century Armenian artist, is my favorite of all the pieces on the DVD.  The Russian intertitles aren't translated, though.  It begins by saying ""Tiflis [now Tbilisi] of the 19th Century,"" but if you don't know Russian, I guess you're not going to get any help.  Clearly there are problems with translation throughout this DVD, which I think is the weakest of those in the box set.",3,"Worth watching, but don't start with this one",1273795200,"05 14, 2010",2010,2025,"['feel', 'conflicted', 'film', 'exploration', 'life', 'Armenian', 'poet', 'Sayat', 'Nova', 'are', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'here', 'felt', 'excluded', 'extremely', 'stylized', 'portrayal', 'poet', 'life', 'Instead', 'presenting', 'sense', 'life', 'get', 'series', 'set', 'pieces', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'profound', 'meaning', 'someone', 'who', 'expert', 'Nova', 'less', 'expert', 'audience', 'rather', 'little', 'One', 'reviewers', 'noted', 'only', 'Armenian', 'could', 'really', 'understand', 'movie', 'Hopefully', 'would', 'also', 'include', 'people', 'who', 'deeply', 'studied', 'Armenia', 'Even', 'so', 'think', 'point', 'course', 'one', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'purely', 'exercise', 'formalism', 'feel', 'point', 'view', 'rather', 'sterile', 'commentary', 'track', 'someone', 'who', 'Nova', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'great', 'deal', 'was', 'also', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'translation', 'many', 'places', 'particularly', 'prayers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'translation', 'was', 'done', 'Soviets', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'reason', 'not', 'translate', 'prayers', 'make', 'up', 'lot', 'dialogue.Issues', 'translation', 'are', 'especially', 'problematic', 'Paradjanov', 'Requiem', 'nearly', 'Russian', 'know', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'translation', 'simply', 'incorrect', 'example', 'Paradjanov', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'German', 'subtitles', 'give', 'grown-up', 'German', 'calling', 'founder', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'Peter', 'Grownup', 'rather', 'Peter', 'Great', 'are', 'many', 'gaps', 'translation', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'sloppy', 'rush', 'job.The', 'short', 'feature', 'Hagop', 'Hovnatanian', 'life', 'nineteenth-century', 'Armenian', 'artist', 'favorite', 'pieces', 'DVD', 'Russian', 'intertitles', 'are', ""n't"", 'translated', 'though', 'saying', 'Tiflis', '[', 'now', 'Tbilisi', ']', '19th', 'Century', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Russian', 'guess', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'help', 'Clearly', 'are', 'problems', 'translation', 'DVD', 'think', 'weakest', 'box', 'set']",Color of Pomegranates VHS
