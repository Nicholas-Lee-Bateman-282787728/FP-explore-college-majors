However, even though I like this workout, there are some drawbacks: I like to max out on weight based on body part worked, but this isn't really possible with this because it moves pretty quickly using the same weight throughout. But that doesn't bother me as much as the fact that she has a tendency to leave out chest (she does that also in her 'I want that Body' video), I can't figure out why. Otherwise, very good video indeed.",4,Good overall,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,544,"['Nice', 'sectioned', 'workouts', 'best', 'part', 'Tamilee', 'calmness', 'friendly', 'personality', 'just', 'love', 'However', 'even', 'like', 'workout', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'like', 'max', 'out', 'weight', 'based', 'body', 'part', 'worked', ""n't"", 'really', 'possible', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'using', 'same', 'weight', ""n't"", 'bother', 'as', 'much', 'fact', 'tendency', 'leave', 'out', 'chest', 'also', 'want', 'Body', 'video', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Otherwise', 'very', 'good', 'video', 'indeed']",Tamilee Webb: Tight on Time - Hot Spots

1016592,A2SRX0T9IH6MW,B000HT3S8A,J.W. & S.W.,"[0, 0]","I'm a fitness walker who always hated strength training (I find it boring). Last spring my doctor told me I had osteoporosis at the ripe old age of 40 (a genetic gift from my mother), and I needed to start taking 2,000 units of D and strength training. This DVD really takes the pain out of strength training for me...the moves are mostly easy even for a balance-challenged individual like myself (though I do have a hard time following Total Body Rocks), they're only ten minutes so I can fit them in before or after my power walk and before work, and they're effective - you just need to increase the weight when they become too easy. I'm due for another bone scan in two years; it will be interesting to see if this and the vitamin D do the trick and reverse some of the bone density loss. If it helps to tone me up, so much the better!UPDATE: Well, two years later, and my doctor's recommendation worked! 2K units of Vitamin D3 every day plus the ToT video and my bone density has improved so that I'm no longer in the osteoporosis range. Plus, I love how NOT time consuming these exercises are!J.W.",4,Got me to strength train,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,1103,"[""'m"", 'fitness', 'walker', 'who', 'always', 'hated', 'strength', 'training', 'find', 'boring', 'Last', 'spring', 'doctor', 'told', 'had', 'osteoporosis', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', '40', 'genetic', 'gift', 'mother', 'needed', 'start', 'taking', '2,000', 'units', 'D', 'strength', 'training', 'DVD', 'really', 'pain', 'strength', 'training', 'moves', 'are', 'mostly', 'easy', 'even', 'balance-challenged', 'individual', 'do', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'following', 'Total', 'Body', 'Rocks', ""'re"", 'only', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'can', 'fit', 'power', 'walk', 'work', ""'re"", 'effective', 'just', 'need', 'increase', 'weight', 'when', 'become', 'too', 'easy', ""'m"", 'due', 'bone', 'scan', 'two', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'vitamin', 'D', 'do', 'trick', 'reverse', 'bone', 'density', 'loss', 'tone', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'UPDATE', 'Well', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'doctor', 'recommendation', 'worked', '2K', 'units', 'Vitamin', 'D3', 'day', 'ToT', 'video', 'bone', 'density', 'improved', ""'m"", 'longer', 'osteoporosis', 'range', 'love', 'how', 'NOT', 'time', 'consuming', 'exercises', 'are', 'J.W']",Tamilee Webb: Tight on Time - Hot Spots
1016593,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B000HT3S8A,Leanne,"[18, 18]","I you like Tamilee's ""I Want that Body"" DVD, then you'll also really love this one!  Tamilee is her usual positive, low-key, yet motivating self, and it's a great toning workout.The DVD is broken down into three ten-minute segments that work your entire body through the use of three-pound dumbbells.  One of the segments focuses on abs, one on the entire body, and one on arms and shoulders.  There is also one extra ten-minute bonus workout that works your entire body using a resistance band.Overall, this is one tough workout!  Tamilee has great new moves that are not on her other DVD's, and I certainly feel sore the day after doing this workout.  Just also be aware that this is a weight/strengh-training workout and not a cardio workout; although some of the segments did get my heart rate up, the segments are designed more for toning.An additional bonus of this workout is that it also includes a three-minute warmup section and a three-minute cooldown.  The DVD menu includes the option of playing these all the way through with the three main strength sections, so that you don't have to constantly go back to the main menu.There were only a few negatives to this video, none of which hindered my ability to enjoy it.  One negative is that the DVD is shot in a more ""modern"" (for lack of a better word) way that means that you're not always able to see what Tamilee is doing. At the end of each segment, she also starts stretching, but the camera cuts out before she's done (so that you can't finish the quick stretch) since the whole concept of ""tight on time"" means that they are trying not to waste any extra time.  The only other negative is that I wish the bonus resistance-band section was part of the main workout; in order to do this extra workout, you have to exit the workout, go to the main menu, do the workout, and then go back to the main menu in order to get the cooldown stretch.  It's nothing major, but it does take a little more time.Overall, though, this is great!  I love Tamilee, and this video is of her usual high quality, with lots of new, intense moves!",5,Another great DVD from Tamilee!,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,2091,"['Tamilee', 'Want', 'Body', 'DVD', 'then', ""'ll"", 'also', 'really', 'love', 'one', 'Tamilee', 'usual', 'positive', 'low-key', 'yet', 'motivating', 'self', 'great', 'toning', 'workout.The', 'DVD', 'broken', 'down', 'three', 'ten-minute', 'segments', 'work', 'entire', 'body', 'use', 'three-pound', 'dumbbells', 'One', 'segments', 'abs', 'one', 'entire', 'body', 'one', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'also', 'one', 'extra', 'ten-minute', 'bonus', 'entire', 'body', 'using', 'resistance', 'band.Overall', 'one', 'tough', 'workout', 'Tamilee', 'great', 'new', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'other', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'feel', 'sore', 'day', 'doing', 'workout', 'Just', 'also', 'be', 'aware', 'weight/strengh-training', 'workout', 'not', 'cardio', 'workout', 'segments', 'did', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'segments', 'are', 'designed', 'more', 'toning.An', 'additional', 'bonus', 'workout', 'also', 'three-minute', 'warmup', 'section', 'three-minute', 'cooldown', 'DVD', 'menu', 'option', 'playing', 'way', 'three', 'main', 'strength', 'sections', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'constantly', 'go', 'back', 'main', 'menu.There', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'negatives', 'video', 'none', 'hindered', 'ability', 'enjoy', 'One', 'negative', 'DVD', 'shot', 'more', 'modern', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'way', ""'re"", 'not', 'always', 'able', 'see', 'what', 'Tamilee', 'doing', 'end', 'segment', 'also', 'stretching', 'camera', 'out', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'finish', 'quick', 'stretch', 'whole', 'concept', 'tight', 'time', 'means', 'are', 'trying', 'not', 'waste', 'extra', 'time', 'only', 'other', 'negative', 'wish', 'bonus', 'resistance-band', 'section', 'was', 'part', 'main', 'workout', 'order', 'do', 'extra', 'workout', 'have', 'exit', 'workout', 'go', 'main', 'menu', 'do', 'workout', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'main', 'menu', 'order', 'get', 'cooldown', 'stretch', 'nothing', 'major', 'take', 'little', 'more', 'time.Overall', 'though', 'great', 'love', 'Tamilee', 'video', 'usual', 'high', 'quality', 'lots', 'new', 'intense', 'moves']",Tamilee Webb: Tight on Time - Hot Spots

That's what you want in a good instructor and that's what you get here.  She makes this fun and not boring in the least.There are three toning workouts (one on the floor and two standing).  You use basic moves and equipment like dumbbells (even for the ab workout).  She is a good cuer and that helps you stay focused on your moves rather than trying to figure out what's coming up next.  Each segment is toning - there is abs, arms and shoulders and a 'total body rocks' segment.  It's not the toughest workout, but like the title suggests, it is good if you are pushed for time but want to do a little something.  It has a bonus workout at the end using an X-ertube, but for the main workout, all you need is dumbbells and you're all set to go.
