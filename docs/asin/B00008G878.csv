741817,A1Q02WFA087CTF,B00008G878,"Anthony Nasti ""Music Maniac""","[11, 23]","By 1981, The Rolling Stones had lost a lot of the magic. Their singles were hardly making the top 20 and their albums still sold high (""Black And Blue"" was number one for nine weeks in a row) but were not as good as ""Sticky Fingers"", ""Exile On Main Street"" or anything from the peak period. Also suffering was their live shows. Once a group whose concerts were full of energy and theatrics, they now are boring and don't even do most of the songs that good.The main problem I have with this dvd is the songs themselves. They don't sound like Stones songs at all. ""Beast Of Burden"", ""Shattered"" and ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" (to name a few) could have been done by any hack tribute band. Their performance of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" is good, but you can tell by the way they just jump right into  the second verse when you go to it that it's been edited. ""Miss You"" is bland despite some great sax work, and ""Let It Bleed"" (a song I was intially looking forward to) doesn't work live. If you want to see a great live performance of this song, buy the ""4 Flicks"" boxed set, watch the Madison Square Garden concert (which I happened to attend). See how well they do this song in an indoor venue rather than an outdoor stadium.The only redeeming momenst in this film are ""Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)"" and the models on ""Honky Tonk Women"". Otherwise, this dvd is a total waste of time and money. Also, I advise to stay away from ""Still Life"", the 1982 live album that was culled from the same tour.",2,This Is The Stones?!,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,1516,"['1981', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'had', 'lost', 'lot', 'magic', 'singles', 'were', 'hardly', 'making', 'top', '20', 'albums', 'still', 'sold', 'high', 'Black', 'Blue', 'was', 'number', 'one', 'nine', 'weeks', 'row', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Sticky', 'Fingers', 'Exile', 'Main', 'Street', 'anything', 'peak', 'period', 'Also', 'suffering', 'was', 'live', 'shows', 'Once', 'group', 'concerts', 'were', 'full', 'energy', 'theatrics', 'now', 'are', 'boring', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'most', 'songs', 'good.The', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'dvd', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'Stones', 'songs', 'Beast', 'Burden', 'Shattered', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Always', 'Get', 'What', 'Want', 'name', 'few', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'hack', 'tribute', 'band', 'performance', 'Jumpin', 'Jack', 'Flash', 'good', 'can', 'tell', 'way', 'just', 'jump', 'right', 'second', 'verse', 'when', 'go', 'been', 'edited', 'Miss', 'bland', 'great', 'sax', 'work', 'Let', 'Bleed', 'song', 'was', 'intially', 'looking', 'forward', ""n't"", 'work', 'live', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'live', 'performance', 'song', 'buy', '4', 'Flicks', 'boxed', 'set', 'watch', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'concert', 'happened', 'attend', 'See', 'how', 'well', 'do', 'song', 'indoor', 'venue', 'rather', 'outdoor', 'stadium.The', 'only', 'redeeming', 'momenst', 'film', 'are', 'Just', 'My', 'Imagination', 'Running', 'Away', 'Me', 'models', 'Honky', 'Tonk', 'Women', 'Otherwise', 'dvd', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'Also', 'advise', 'stay', 'away', 'Still', 'Life', '1982', 'live', 'album', 'was', 'culled', 'same', 'tour']",N/A
741818,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B00008G878,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[9, 24]","The 1981-82 tour The Rolling Stones did for their album ""Tattoo You"" was marred by ongoing tensions between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, who were at this point not even talking to each other. The tension between the band's two leaders affected their live shows, as the tension was carried onstage, resulting in their worst performances ever.Looking back on the 1981-82 tour, one wonders why someone chose to document the tour and make it into a movie. But, someone did do it, a director named Hal Ashby. When you consider how awful this concert was, one must ponder if Ashby was just a fan who decided to film the concert as a keepsake with a video camera and sold it to a movie company, since I can't imagine why a person in their right mind would actually would want to film this concert. The arrangements of the songs are awful, and the band sounds like a hack tribute band. Songs like ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"", ""Honky Tonk Women"" (which is enjoyable for the parade of women that storm the stage for it) and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" are almost completely indistinguishable under the muffled sound and bad performances of them in general. Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman carry the show, as they are the only musicians (other than longtime pianist Ian Stuart) who seem to be putting in any effort.This dvd is not worth owning.

But, yeah, that's skipping ahead.  &quot;Let's Spend The Night Together&quot; is quite redeemable with the inclusion of Ian Stewart, on what was, sadly, to be his last tour.  It's funny, watching Mick cuss Ron Wood out (this seems to be a running gag during the first ten songs), and &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; is a hoot:  the stage curtains open, and out comes a line of - whew! - scantily clad women, led by Jerry Hall who was Mick's main squeeze at the time.  &quot;Honky Tonk,&quot; I'll leave that up to you to discern, because Shirley, the great Charlie Watts' wife, makes a very brief, ephemeral cameo, flirting with her man, and Ron Wood's young daughter runs out onstage.

Knowing what I now know, this turns out to be the capstone on their legendary live performing career -- everything after this was pure tribute (and I write that based on having run across ""Steel Wheelchairs"" on PBS one night a few months back -- really pro forma, that one and everything since, it's Stones spelled out for the masses, for anyone not smart enough to figure it out for themselves, and thus not really art at all). That's part of what makes this movie so good, it has none of the self-consciousness and micro-attention to spelled-out detail of their later tours and films (see: ""Shine a Light""). The camera in this film is unblinking, which means the editor just let the scenes roll along and speak for themselves -- and they are nice, long scenes, from some really outstanding angles that get us close without being too close, and sometimes just far enough away to see what they were up to. No jumbo-trons, very few big effects, really -- just a great rock band doing their thing. I really got a sense from looking at this what the Stones were like in concert on that tour, which seems to have been the closest in their late-modern phase ('75-on) to being great in concert while also having some decent product in the record stores and on the radio. This was really it for them and for us -- and I regret being part of the group that probably drove them into their later incarnation, which was perfectly executed live and not very memorable on record.",5,The last of the real Stones live,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,1742,"['purchased', 'lark', 'part', 'wanted', 'show', 'wife', 'how', 'campy', 'Mick', 'was', 'back', 'day', 'opinion', 'based', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'here', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'put', 'thing', 'MacBook', 'beheld', 'incredibly', 'well-shot', 'view', 'early-80s', 'Stones', 'Knowing', 'what', 'now', 'know', 'out', 'be', 'capstone', 'legendary', 'live', 'performing', 'career', 'everything', 'was', 'pure', 'tribute', 'write', 'based', 'having', 'run', 'Steel', 'Wheelchairs', 'PBS', 'one', 'night', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'really', 'pro', 'forma', 'one', 'everything', 'Stones', 'spelled', 'out', 'masses', 'anyone', 'not', 'smart', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'thus', 'not', 'really', 'art', 'part', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'none', 'self-consciousness', 'micro-attention', 'spelled-out', 'detail', 'later', 'tours', 'films', 'see', 'Shine', 'Light', 'camera', 'film', 'unblinking', 'editor', 'just', 'let', 'scenes', 'roll', 'along', 'speak', 'are', 'nice', 'long', 'scenes', 'really', 'outstanding', 'angles', 'get', 'close', 'being', 'too', 'close', 'sometimes', 'just', 'far', 'enough', 'away', 'see', 'what', 'were', 'up', 'jumbo-trons', 'very', 'few', 'big', 'effects', 'really', 'just', 'great', 'rock', 'band', 'doing', 'thing', 'really', 'got', 'sense', 'looking', 'what', 'Stones', 'were', 'concert', 'tour', 'have', 'been', 'closest', 'late-modern', 'phase', ""'75-on"", 'being', 'great', 'concert', 'also', 'having', 'decent', 'product', 'record', 'stores', 'radio', 'was', 'really', 'regret', 'being', 'part', 'group', 'probably', 'drove', 'later', 'incarnation', 'was', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'live', 'not', 'very', 'memorable', 'record']",N/A

741841,A36T2TEF5SKPUM,B00008G878,Laon,"[5, 8]","I've been listening to the Stones a lot recently, after pretty much forgetting about them for a decade or so. And re-discovered a terrific band, of course.The best Stones music is just astonishingly good. Jagger and Richard, with Brian Jones, Mick Taylor or Ron Wood, and Wyman and Watts in the back, all produced performances that now seem even more heartfelt, also more sophisicated, than they did at the time. The Stones really were ""the greatest rock'n'roll band"", at least for a while, but they were also a great blues and soul band, whose slower, more emotional songs were often the real highlights of each album.There were brilliant singles from the first albums, then the run of sheer greatness from ""Beggars' Banquet"" to ""Exiles on Main Street"", and even in their long decline after ""Exiles"" they still produced a lot of great music. The last Mick Taylor albums are still good, especially ""Goats Head Soup"", and though the Ron Wood albums are noticeably weaker, the quality was still maintained at a fairly high standard up to 1981's ""Tattoo You"". After ""Tattoo You"" the albums were at best patchy, mostly ofering only a couple of worthwhile tracks apiece, and some (""Dirty Work"", for example) not even offering that.So I'm currently re-visiting the Stones catalogue with fresh interest and appreciation. Therefore, as you do, I wanted to buy a live show captured on film. So I got this DVD, ""Let's Spend the Night Together"", which records three nights of the 1981 tour promoting ""Tattoo You"". These shows were from the last tour on which the Stones could push a strong new album as well as their amazing back catalogue. So I bought ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" and put it in the player with high expectations.And I'm afraid it's a terrible disappointment. I've played it once and put it on the shelf, and I doubt that I'll ever play it again. So what's wrong with it? I could quibble with the song selection, which drew too heavily on some of the weaker tracks from some of their weaker albums (far too much from ""Emotional Rescue"" and too little from, say, ""Sticky Fingers"" or ""Let it Bleed"", for example), but that wasn't the real problem.The first major disappointment is the sound quality. I'm not terribly fussy about audio quality, especially where the Stones are involved, but this film sounds abysmal: muffled, distant, and indistinct. At first I thought this was a deliberate effect, as the film starts from a helicopter far above the stadium. But though the cameras soon get close to the stage the sound never gets any clearer or closer. The whole concert, throughout, sounds like it was recorded from inside a car parked outside the stadium. With the doors closed.Worse, the Stones don't seem to have their heart in these performances. All of the songs are given a slightly off-hand performance, with a brisk, efficient, mechanical tempo that seems to get imposed on everything they play. Every song, from their greatest classics to basic boogie filler, comes out sounding much the same; the individuality of the best songs is lost, thrown away.There is one other problem, and I feel kind of shallow mentioning it, but the Stones are supposed to be a visual band. Jagger in particular is supposed to have a certain style, a certain amount of wicked charisma. The Jagger persona, the decadent and dangerous ""man of wealth and taste"", was always an act, but it was still an important part of the way he sold his songs.  Unfortunately, he does this show wearing some sort of sports costume, with pants that are padded at the backside and crutch, which I supposed is why Jagger thought they looked good, then taper down to skintight leggings with knee pads.Unfortunately, the visual effect is that Jagger appears to be wearing a nappy over long-john underpants, and not even Jagger can manage charisma in that. He looks a joke, an absolute goose, throughout. The rest of the band are fine, and Keef is his pyratical self as ever, but regrettably the front man spends the movie being a visual embarrassment. With the Stones, I'm afraid that hurts the performance.So this DVD may look like an attractive package, from the outside. The Stones were making good music in 1981, just not on this DVD. Their songs are great, just not on this DVD. This DVD is fairly cheap, but disappointment and lacklustre performances are never value for money.I remember once seeing a concert film of the Stones from the Mick Taylor period, with Jagger and the rest in excellent form throughout. I strongly recommend buying that, if/when it gets released on DVD. But I have to recommend not spending your hard-earned on this one. The Stones are a great band, just not on this DVD.Cheers!Laon",2,"Consumer warning: soundtrack, performance problems",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,4690,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'listening', 'Stones', 'lot', 'recently', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgetting', 'decade', 'so', 're-discovered', 'terrific', 'band', 'course.The', 'best', 'Stones', 'music', 'just', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'Jagger', 'Richard', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'Ron', 'Wood', 'Wyman', 'Watts', 'back', 'produced', 'performances', 'now', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'heartfelt', 'also', 'more', 'sophisicated', 'did', 'time', 'Stones', 'really', 'were', 'greatest', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'band', 'least', 'while', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'blues', 'soul', 'band', 'slower', 'more', 'emotional', 'songs', 'were', 'often', 'real', 'highlights', 'were', 'brilliant', 'singles', 'first', 'albums', 'then', 'run', 'sheer', 'greatness', 'Beggars', 'Banquet', 'Exiles', 'Main', 'Street', 'even', 'long', 'decline', 'Exiles', 'still', 'produced', 'lot', 'great', 'music', 'last', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'albums', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'especially', 'Goats', 'Head', 'Soup', 'Ron', 'Wood', 'albums', 'are', 'noticeably', 'weaker', 'quality', 'was', 'still', 'maintained', 'fairly', 'high', 'standard', '1981', 'Tattoo', 'Tattoo', 'albums', 'were', 'best', 'patchy', 'mostly', 'ofering', 'only', 'couple', 'worthwhile', 'tracks', 'apiece', 'Dirty', 'Work', 'example', 'not', 'even', 'offering', 'that.So', ""'m"", 'currently', 're-visiting', 'Stones', 'catalogue', 'fresh', 'interest', 'appreciation', 'Therefore', 'do', 'wanted', 'buy', 'live', 'show', 'captured', 'film', 'got', 'DVD', 'Let', 'Spend', 'Night', 'Together', 'records', 'three', 'nights', '1981', 'tour', 'promoting', 'Tattoo', 'shows', 'were', 'last', 'tour', 'Stones', 'could', 'push', 'strong', 'new', 'album', 'as', 'well', 'amazing', 'back', 'catalogue', 'bought', 'Let', 'Spend', 'Night', 'Together', 'put', 'player', 'high', 'expectations.And', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'terrible', 'disappointment', ""'ve"", 'played', 'once', 'put', 'shelf', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'play', 'again', 'what', 'wrong', 'could', 'quibble', 'song', 'selection', 'drew', 'too', 'heavily', 'weaker', 'tracks', 'weaker', 'albums', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Emotional', 'Rescue', 'too', 'little', 'say', 'Sticky', 'Fingers', 'Let', 'Bleed', 'example', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'problem.The', 'first', 'major', 'disappointment', 'sound', 'quality', ""'m"", 'not', 'terribly', 'fussy', 'audio', 'quality', 'especially', 'where', 'Stones', 'are', 'involved', 'film', 'abysmal', 'muffled', 'distant', 'indistinct', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'deliberate', 'effect', 'film', 'helicopter', 'far', 'stadium', 'cameras', 'soon', 'get', 'close', 'stage', 'sound', 'never', 'clearer', 'closer', 'whole', 'concert', 'was', 'recorded', 'car', 'parked', 'stadium', 'doors', 'closed.Worse', 'Stones', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'heart', 'performances', 'songs', 'are', 'given', 'slightly', 'off-hand', 'performance', 'brisk', 'efficient', 'mechanical', 'tempo', 'get', 'imposed', 'everything', 'play', 'Every', 'song', 'greatest', 'classics', 'basic', 'boogie', 'filler', 'out', 'sounding', 'much', 'same', 'individuality', 'best', 'songs', 'lost', 'away.There', 'one', 'other', 'problem', 'feel', 'kind', 'shallow', 'mentioning', 'Stones', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'visual', 'band', 'Jagger', 'particular', 'supposed', 'have', 'certain', 'style', 'certain', 'amount', 'wicked', 'charisma', 'Jagger', 'persona', 'decadent', 'dangerous', 'man', 'wealth', 'taste', 'was', 'always', 'act', 'was', 'still', 'important', 'part', 'way', 'sold', 'songs', 'Unfortunately', 'show', 'wearing', 'sort', 'sports', 'costume', 'pants', 'are', 'padded', 'backside', 'crutch', 'supposed', 'why', 'Jagger', 'thought', 'looked', 'good', 'then', 'taper', 'down', 'skintight', 'leggings', 'knee', 'pads.Unfortunately', 'visual', 'effect', 'Jagger', 'be', 'wearing', 'nappy', 'long-john', 'underpants', 'not', 'even', 'Jagger', 'can', 'manage', 'charisma', 'joke', 'absolute', 'goose', 'rest', 'band', 'are', 'fine', 'Keef', 'pyratical', 'self', 'ever', 'regrettably', 'front', 'man', 'movie', 'being', 'visual', 'embarrassment', 'Stones', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'performance.So', 'DVD', 'may', 'look', 'attractive', 'package', 'outside', 'Stones', 'were', 'making', 'good', 'music', '1981', 'just', 'not', 'DVD', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'just', 'not', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'cheap', 'disappointment', 'lacklustre', 'performances', 'are', 'never', 'value', 'money.I', 'remember', 'once', 'seeing', 'concert', 'film', 'Stones', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'period', 'Jagger', 'rest', 'excellent', 'form', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'if/when', 'released', 'DVD', 'have', 'recommend', 'not', 'spending', 'hard-earned', 'one', 'Stones', 'are', 'great', 'band', 'just', 'not', 'DVD.Cheers', 'Laon']",N/A

Couldn't get enough of those extended wide-angle scenes (often, less seen) in a commercially available release as such. Truly, a superb audio and video document of the Stones 'Tattoo You' summer-fall 1981 U.S. tour. I tend to enjoy the outdoor footage the most - due to the fact that they featured more of those wide-angle snippets. However, I noticed that during toward the end of this DVD, during the songs taken from a couple of their indoor venue gigs that Jagger mentions Kansas City. Hey, I was there (for the) first of two sold-out concerts - where former Stones guitarist Mick Taylor came out and guested on a several songs. Track here that are sure to live on in my heart (and soul) forever are the somewhat humorous ""Neighbors"", ""Just My Imagination"", ""Let Me Go"", the Motown classic ""Going To A Go-Go"", the most memorable ""All Down The Line"", ""Start Me Up"", ""Honky Tonk Woman"" (accompanied with forty decently hot-looking women strutting across the stage following Mick Jagger) and the finale ""Satisfaction"" complete with a couple hundred balloons lowered over the band.

741849,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,B00008G878,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[1, 1]","A great DVD of 24 Stones classics, filmed in 1981, it was also one of Hal Ashby's last films (the bearded wild man him self appears in a backstage scene halfway through the movie). The film starts off at a stadium show in the afternoon, filmed at the Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona (13 December 1981), before later on moving into the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey (filmed 5-6 November 1981). I came into this film with fairly low expectations, but it blew me away - in this video Mick is about the same age as I am now, and he's in amazing shape; he pulls off a great show - the whole band does!But not everything's perfect, and the movie is a bit slow starting off - for starters, the opening scenes feel a bit odd, as the song is a bit jarringly studio-sounding, and there's a non-live feel to it, like it's been performed in a small empty room with some crowd noises mixed in. We get a nice behind-stage view of Charlie's bald spot (what happened to it more recently - wig?). Great ariel shot, balloons rising. Mick's kneepads look quite horrible. Ian Stewart on piano, only four years before he died. Bill Wyman in shell suit (and later in a pastel yellow suit - ewwww!!!). Random backstage shots edited in during some numbers. Mick snarling to Ron about time. Ron's make-up people do their thing. During the afternoon gig, we get to see edited in goofy shots from the evening gig. Keith looks like a poor man's Bruce Springsteen at times, he later comes out in these magnificent bare-chested ripped shirts - wow! Mick plays a Gibson SG on some songs (and also an Ovation), using it mostly as a prop rather than actually playing significant (and distinguishable) guitar parts; no big deal, though, he makes great use of it as a prop, and ""(Just My Imagination) Running Away With Me"" is really awesome!! Funny to see Bill shaking his head at Mick's guitar antics (me too).Weird editing - there's at least one scene, involving a frisbee landing on the deck near Mick's feet, reused in the film, and then at another point we see Mick being strapped into his Ovation guitar at stage right and in the next frame immediately he's singing and playing (it's at 35:00). What's missing in between? During ""Time Is On My Side"" we get images of the young Stones, as well as strange political images, and the weird WTF Nazi costume dress stuff (as we see below). Strange! Mick dons an ugly shoulder-padded blazer, double yuck!! There's another time capture montage during ""Going To A Go-Go"" when we see the Meadowlands stage being built, with its weird turntable so that the whole stage can rotate to face all four sides of the place through the course of the gig. Nice touch, great design, must have been a strange effect, though (they had wanted to do something similar at Woodstock, actually, it didn't work out). Great version of ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"", with great sound - we even hear the pop of Mick removing his mic from the mic clip on his mic stand!! There's another weird montage during ""She's So Cold"". Mick does a weird crotch wash at 59:30, and an awful lot of mincing throughout. Hmmm... at one point Keith takes a relatively fresh cig that he's already smoking and throws it on the ground. ""Let It Bleed"" is full of gag reel shots of Bill and Charlie (the rhythm section), like an off-sync Rolling Stones gag reel. During ""Honkey Tonk Women"", out come 100 honkey tonk women, including Gerry Hall!! Wow!!! Ron's daughter in there too?? Bobby Keys finally shows up near the end, in ""Brown Sugar"". During ""Jumping Jack Flash"" Mick moves around by cherry picker. During encore of ""Satisfaction"" they release a million balloons from the ceiling, they bounce around the stage, Ron blasts some of them with his mouth-held cigarette. Nice shots of Mick draped in US/UK flag, other endings and finales from various evenings are then also spliced in.Altogether a really fantastic visual document - just love it!!",5,Much better than I expected - top notch Stones!!,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,3955,"['great', 'DVD', '24', 'Stones', 'classics', 'filmed', '1981', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'Hal', 'Ashby', 'last', 'films', 'bearded', 'wild', 'man', 'self', 'backstage', 'scene', 'halfway', 'movie', 'film', 'off', 'stadium', 'show', 'afternoon', 'filmed', 'Sun', 'Devil', 'Stadium', 'Tempe', 'Arizona', '13', 'December', '1981', 'before', 'later', 'moving', 'Meadowlands', 'Sports', 'Complex', 'East', 'Rutherford', 'New', 'Jersey', 'filmed', '5-6', 'November', '1981', 'came', 'film', 'fairly', 'low', 'expectations', 'blew', 'away', 'video', 'Mick', 'same', 'age', 'am', 'now', 'amazing', 'shape', 'great', 'show', 'whole', 'band', 'not', 'everything', 'perfect', 'movie', 'bit', 'slow', 'starting', 'off', 'starters', 'opening', 'scenes', 'feel', 'bit', 'odd', 'song', 'bit', 'jarringly', 'studio-sounding', 'non-live', 'feel', 'been', 'performed', 'small', 'empty', 'room', 'crowd', 'noises', 'mixed', 'get', 'nice', 'behind-stage', 'view', 'Charlie', 'bald', 'spot', 'what', 'happened', 'more', 'recently', 'wig', 'Great', 'ariel', 'shot', 'balloons', 'rising', 'Mick', 'kneepads', 'look', 'quite', 'horrible', 'Ian', 'Stewart', 'piano', 'only', 'four', 'years', 'died', 'Bill', 'Wyman', 'shell', 'suit', 'later', 'pastel', 'yellow', 'suit', 'ewwww', 'Random', 'backstage', 'shots', 'edited', 'numbers', 'Mick', 'snarling', 'Ron', 'time', 'Ron', 'make-up', 'people', 'do', 'thing', 'afternoon', 'gig', 'get', 'see', 'edited', 'goofy', 'shots', 'evening', 'gig', 'Keith', 'poor', 'man', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'times', 'later', 'out', 'magnificent', 'bare-chested', 'ripped', 'shirts', 'wow', 'Mick', 'Gibson', 'SG', 'songs', 'also', 'Ovation', 'using', 'mostly', 'prop', 'rather', 'actually', 'playing', 'significant', 'distinguishable', 'guitar', 'parts', 'big', 'deal', 'though', 'great', 'use', 'prop', 'Just', 'My', 'Imagination', 'Running', 'Away', 'Me', 'really', 'awesome', 'Funny', 'see', 'Bill', 'shaking', 'head', 'Mick', 'guitar', 'antics', 'too', '.Weird', 'editing', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'involving', 'frisbee', 'landing', 'deck', 'Mick', 'feet', 'reused', 'film', 'then', 'point', 'see', 'Mick', 'being', 'strapped', 'Ovation', 'guitar', 'stage', 'right', 'next', 'frame', 'immediately', 'singing', 'playing', '35:00', 'What', 'missing', 'Time', 'My', 'Side', 'get', 'images', 'young', 'Stones', 'as', 'well', 'strange', 'political', 'images', 'weird', 'WTF', 'Nazi', 'costume', 'dress', 'stuff', 'see', 'Strange', 'Mick', 'ugly', 'shoulder-padded', 'blazer', 'double', 'yuck', 'time', 'capture', 'montage', 'Going', 'Go-Go', 'when', 'see', 'Meadowlands', 'stage', 'being', 'built', 'weird', 'turntable', 'so', 'whole', 'stage', 'can', 'rotate', 'face', 'four', 'sides', 'place', 'course', 'gig', 'Nice', 'touch', 'great', 'design', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'strange', 'effect', 'had', 'wanted', 'do', 'something', 'similar', 'Woodstock', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'Great', 'version', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Always', 'Get', 'What', 'Want', 'great', 'sound', 'even', 'hear', 'pop', 'Mick', 'removing', 'mic', 'mic', 'clip', 'mic', 'stand', 'weird', 'montage', 'So', 'Cold', 'Mick', 'weird', 'crotch', 'wash', '59:30', 'awful', 'lot', 'mincing', 'Hmmm', 'one', 'point', 'Keith', 'relatively', 'fresh', 'cig', 'already', 'smoking', 'ground', 'Let', 'Bleed', 'full', 'gag', 'reel', 'shots', 'Bill', 'Charlie', 'rhythm', 'section', 'off-sync', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'gag', 'reel', 'Honkey', 'Tonk', 'Women', 'come', '100', 'honkey', 'tonk', 'women', 'including', 'Gerry', 'Hall', 'Wow', 'Ron', 'daughter', 'too', 'Bobby', 'Keys', 'finally', 'up', 'end', 'Brown', 'Sugar', 'Jumping', 'Jack', 'Flash', 'Mick', 'around', 'cherry', 'picker', 'encore', 'Satisfaction', 'release', 'million', 'balloons', 'ceiling', 'bounce', 'stage', 'Ron', 'mouth-held', 'cigarette', 'Nice', 'shots', 'Mick', 'draped', 'US/UK', 'flag', 'other', 'endings', 'finales', 'various', 'evenings', 'are', 'then', 'also', 'spliced', 'really', 'fantastic', 'visual', 'document', 'just', 'love']",N/A

What happened to the great movie poster that graced the cover of the VHS version?Having said that, the content is excellent, capturing the Stones on what I consider to be the last of their ""sloppy"" tours, before they regrouped, cleaned up completely (Richards was off the smack by the time of this one, but Wood was heavy into free-basing throughout this period), and started doing overly polished and professional tours supported by an army of side musicians and background singers.  There's merits to both periods, and perhaps this is a little too ramshackle for some, but it is a great, high energy concert that delivers hit after hit, particularly if you're a fan of the ""Tattoo You"" and ""Some Girls"" albums (in my mind, the two best discs they've ever done).The garish early 80's pastels, Jagger's soccer pads, Ron Wood looking like he just got through auditioning for the Sex Pistols or something, Wyman in his track suit...it's an image of the Stones you'd never seen before or since, and it makes for an exciting concert.

741851,A1ISW6NMR45Y71,B00008G878,Tome Raider,"[5, 10]","I'm a life-long fan of the Stones and I basically have everything they've ever produced in multiple formats.  As I write this I'm waiting for UPS to deliver the two comprehensive vinyl box sets which were just released.  Last week I watched ""Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones"" and I was amazed at how good it was.  That DVD reveals the Stones in their most intense and psychedelic splendor.This DVD is almost a decade later from ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" and the vibe has changed considerably. This is their ultra-commercial phase.  The crowds are huge.  (The sound quality at Candlestick, where I was way back in '81, and as I well recall it, was awesome; not so in this video.  The music is very washed out and hollow here throughout.)Keith and Ron are still without affectation and  jam away like the pros they've always been. Keith is arguably in his prime in these shows, both physically and musically.  Ron is definitely into the music and he looks like he is really enjoying putting it out there.Charlie looks mildly amused throughout. He has an emerging bald spot on the back of his head which kind of seems symbolic to me of the overall decline (or, more charitably, change) of the band as the boys age out. Bill Wyman looks bored and slightly indignant.  Congruously, he wears saggy ""athletic/leisure suits"" which would be consistent with what you'd see at a retirement home or amongst any hip geriatric crowd.  Bill's entire vibe on this tour is the antithesis to rock and roll. But maybe that is part of his appeal, in an ironic sort of way??  He doesn't cater to the whole ""fame"" thing.But the real disappointment is Mick. Maybe I should say ""embarassment"" rather than disappointment. I had declared to my young daughters before our viewing that I thought Mick was the ""the most major dude on the planet since Alexander the Great or Julius Ceasar,"" and ""even more famous"" than Sinatra and Dino.  These bold proclamations caught their attention and they readied themselves for the big show.My words came back to haunt me, and they soon began mocking me.  The way Mick dressed on this tour is literally visually painful.  He wears skimpy feminine tops and bright pastel jackets with shoulder pads.  Even worse are these white football pants complete with knee pads and an (exagerrated)crotch cup.  His dancing style would be very compelling for a (female) stripper at an upscale strip club. At one point he pulls off his shirt, and I was half expecting to see breasts underneath. He swings his boney hiney here for 90 minutes like he thinks he is Vanessa del Rio. My older daughter kept asking why he danced like a girl, and I explained the concept of ""androgyny"" to her.  She replied ""this isn't androgony (sic), this is a man acting like a girl. And, the Chairman of the Board isn't androgonous, he dresses really classy.""  I couldn't disagree with her in good conscience. She also asked, ""Is Sir Mick like Sir Elton John?"" (Whom we also greatly admire.)  ""Is it the same 'situation' with Mick?,"" she asked. I told her ""no,"" and I emphasized all the exotic super models Mick has dated over the decades as proof, but I'm not sure she believed me.  A lot of Mick's movements here are indeed keenly provocative in a highly feminine manner, and in my view they are NOT cool at all.  I don't recall this particular vibe at all in any of the other concerts I've attended or videos I've seen of the Stones. Mick normally struts like a territorial bantam cock; here, he is gallavanting, with the aforementioned disconcerting hiney shaking.  This was clearly an unfortunate little phase Mick went through. It is probably mostly the clothing which blemishes his style here as it so dated.  The Mick from before this tour and after is pure brilliance, but this phase is painfully garish to behold.None the less, when you admire a band like the Stones as much as I do, you pretty much need to have everything that is out there, and this tour is one installment in an unprecedented five-decades-long legacy. This band has definitely been the ""soundtrack for my life,"" and I love them despite their eccentricities.  I think it is worth having this DVD despite Mick behaving and dressing in such a cringe-worthy manner.",3,I Guess It Captures Well an Era We'd Be Better Off Forgetting,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,4221,"[""'m"", 'life-long', 'fan', 'Stones', 'basically', 'have', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'produced', 'multiple', 'formats', 'write', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'UPS', 'deliver', 'two', 'comprehensive', 'vinyl', 'box', 'sets', 'were', 'just', 'released', 'Last', 'week', 'watched', 'Ladies', 'Gentlemen', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'DVD', 'Stones', 'most', 'intense', 'psychedelic', 'splendor.This', 'DVD', 'almost', 'decade', 'later', 'Ladies', 'Gentlemen', 'vibe', 'changed', 'considerably', 'ultra-commercial', 'phase', 'crowds', 'are', 'huge', 'sound', 'quality', 'Candlestick', 'where', 'was', 'way', 'back', ""'81"", 'well', 'recall', 'was', 'awesome', 'not', 'so', 'video', 'music', 'very', 'washed', 'out', 'hollow', 'here', 'Keith', 'Ron', 'are', 'still', 'affectation', 'jam', 'away', 'pros', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'Keith', 'arguably', 'prime', 'shows', 'physically', 'musically', 'Ron', 'definitely', 'music', 'really', 'enjoying', 'putting', 'out', 'there.Charlie', 'looks', 'mildly', 'amused', 'emerging', 'bald', 'spot', 'back', 'head', 'kind', 'symbolic', 'overall', 'decline', 'more', 'charitably', 'change', 'band', 'boys', 'age', 'out', 'Bill', 'Wyman', 'bored', 'slightly', 'indignant', 'Congruously', 'saggy', 'athletic/leisure', 'suits', 'would', 'be', 'consistent', 'what', ""'d"", 'see', 'retirement', 'home', 'amongst', 'hip', 'geriatric', 'crowd', 'Bill', 'entire', 'vibe', 'tour', 'antithesis', 'rock', 'roll', 'maybe', 'part', 'appeal', 'ironic', 'sort', 'way', ""n't"", 'cater', 'whole', 'fame', 'real', 'disappointment', 'Mick', 'Maybe', 'should', 'say', 'embarassment', 'rather', 'disappointment', 'had', 'declared', 'young', 'daughters', 'viewing', 'thought', 'Mick', 'was', 'most', 'major', 'dude', 'planet', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'Julius', 'Ceasar', 'even', 'more', 'famous', 'Sinatra', 'Dino', 'bold', 'proclamations', 'caught', 'attention', 'readied', 'big', 'show.My', 'words', 'came', 'back', 'haunt', 'soon', 'began', 'mocking', 'way', 'Mick', 'dressed', 'tour', 'literally', 'visually', 'painful', 'skimpy', 'feminine', 'tops', 'bright', 'pastel', 'jackets', 'shoulder', 'pads', 'Even', 'worse', 'are', 'white', 'football', 'pants', 'complete', 'knee', 'pads', 'exagerrated', 'crotch', 'cup', 'dancing', 'style', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'compelling', 'female', 'stripper', 'upscale', 'strip', 'club', 'one', 'point', 'shirt', 'was', 'half', 'expecting', 'see', 'breasts', 'underneath', 'swings', 'boney', 'hiney', 'here', '90', 'minutes', 'Vanessa', 'del', 'Rio', 'older', 'daughter', 'kept', 'asking', 'why', 'danced', 'girl', 'explained', 'concept', 'androgyny', 'replied', ""n't"", 'androgony', 'sic', 'man', 'acting', 'girl', 'Chairman', 'Board', ""n't"", 'androgonous', 'really', 'classy', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'good', 'conscience', 'also', 'asked', 'Sir', 'Mick', 'Sir', 'Elton', 'John', 'Whom', 'also', 'greatly', 'admire', 'same', ""'situation"", 'Mick', 'asked', 'told', 'emphasized', 'exotic', 'super', 'models', 'Mick', 'dated', 'decades', 'proof', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'believed', 'lot', 'Mick', 'movements', 'here', 'are', 'indeed', 'keenly', 'provocative', 'highly', 'feminine', 'manner', 'view', 'are', 'NOT', 'cool', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'particular', 'vibe', 'other', 'concerts', ""'ve"", 'attended', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Stones', 'Mick', 'normally', 'territorial', 'bantam', 'cock', 'here', 'gallavanting', 'aforementioned', 'disconcerting', 'hiney', 'shaking', 'was', 'clearly', 'unfortunate', 'little', 'phase', 'Mick', 'went', 'probably', 'mostly', 'clothing', 'style', 'here', 'so', 'dated', 'Mick', 'tour', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'phase', 'painfully', 'garish', 'behold.None', 'less', 'when', 'admire', 'band', 'Stones', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'need', 'have', 'everything', 'there', 'tour', 'one', 'installment', 'unprecedented', 'five-decades-long', 'legacy', 'band', 'definitely', 'been', 'soundtrack', 'life', 'love', 'eccentricities', 'think', 'worth', 'having', 'DVD', 'Mick', 'behaving', 'dressing', 'such', 'cringe-worthy', 'manner']",N/A

Jagger has never sounded worse, almost losing his voice, slurred, hoarse, a lot of low bellowing.The camera work is pretty lazy. At one point they spend a whole song on the bass player standing still not moving an inch.Even the crowd seemed bored, only becoming briefly excited when Jagger finally gets close to the audience.I've seen several other performances of theirs, this was the worst one of any of them. I'd say the high rating are from true fanatics who would give 5 stars to Jagger belching for an hour.",1,"So disappointing, don't waste your time",1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,605,"['band', 'worst', 'players', 'are', 'indifferent', 'going', 'motions', 'Jagger', 'never', 'sounded', 'worse', 'almost', 'losing', 'voice', 'slurred', 'hoarse', 'lot', 'low', 'bellowing.The', 'camera', 'work', 'pretty', 'lazy', 'one', 'point', 'spend', 'whole', 'song', 'bass', 'player', 'standing', 'still', 'not', 'moving', 'inch.Even', 'crowd', 'seemed', 'bored', 'only', 'becoming', 'briefly', 'excited', 'when', 'Jagger', 'finally', 'close', 'audience.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'other', 'performances', 'theirs', 'was', 'worst', 'one', ""'d"", 'say', 'high', 'rating', 'are', 'true', 'fanatics', 'who', 'would', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'Jagger', 'belching', 'hour']",N/A

I caught this on TCM the other night at like 2 in the morning and I was astounded at just how truly awful and embarrassing The Stones were in the 80s. I could be wrong but I think a big part of it has to do with the brainless choice in changing the guitar sounds from natural raw amplification to that really weak dreadful almost reggae inspired mild phase tone. Coupled with some puke inducing synth keyboards and cheesy saxophones its no surprise when the camera does a rare pan to the direct center of the audience you see a sea of working class long haired men (haha on you Mick) with blank disappointed stares. They wanted to get loose and hear Street Fighting Man and Brown Sugar done somewhat faithfully to the record, instead it you got uninspired sloppy performances making these awful twinky weak sounds whiles Mick Jagger struts around lowly moaning into the microphone. Its no surprise you see these same faces rushing the barricades at Metallica concerts only a year later (another band that also went to hell but thats another story).Seriously, this is atrocious, how did this band keep afloat after sucking completely for 32 years or so?
