It was released the same year as The Exorcist, and so it did not get the wide recognition it deserved.  After The Exorcist, we had the gore and effects, and less of the story-themed horror films.This film captures the mood of the Victorian interest in psychic research.  It was a blend of scientific exploration and interest in the mystic forces of nature.  Robert Stephens is the lead and gives an excellent performance as Sir Hugo.  Sir Hugo is on a quest for immortality.  He becomes obsessed with his mission and pays higher and higher prices for his fixation.

The film revolves around a psychic researcher's attempts to attain immortality.  Of course the don't-tread-on-God's-territory theme is strong here, with tragedy at every turn.  While the film is interesting, there are surprising gaps and leaps in logic, especially odd in a film that attempts intelligence.  Says Phil Hardy, ""the static nature of the script fails to generate any of the cerebral excitement the theme demands, and leaves various contradictions and loopholes which hamper credibility.""  The cinematography, while professional, is nonetheless bland.  Apparently ""The Asphyx"" failed at the box office.  Its gothic tone and theme simply did not attract an audience in '73 (when it was released in America), an audience which, that same year, flocked to see the horrors of ""The Exorcist.""

Back when BBC1 and ITV in the UK used to show late night movies, films of it's ilk would regularly turn up and be etched forever into impressionable young minds like mine. I remember first seeing it after my father taped it off of the now defunct 'Thames Television' station back in the early nineteen eighties. Images from it have stayed with me to this day and, reappraising it again, I was impressed by how well it has stood the test of time and how it treats its subject matter in the kind of adult and deftly subtle manner that you very rarely see in horror-film making these days. It's a thoroughly interesting horror film because there is not really an evil character in it - indeed, the character who would generally be tarred with the ""evil"" brush in a less subtle treatment is deeply humanitarian and only really motivated by a profound sense of loss and a fear of being left alone in the world. It's this fear and vulnerability that will eventually set in motion a chain of events that will have devastating consequences for all involved, but, as it is, the rendering of the character by the late, great Robert Stephens engenders only sympathy for his plight as that which he holds most dear is slowly and systematically stripped away. There is virtually no onscreen gore in this film and virtually no violence, but it's denouement is still one of the most haunting that I've ever seen and leads me to wonder whether a young Stephen King didn't borrow elements of it for 'The Green Mile'. In the hands of a director like Christopher Nolan, a remake of this film would be most welcome, if crafted with same care and attention lavished on the original.

553858,A1PKEOMVR3LKVU,B00004W50O,D. C. Squires,"[2, 4]","""The Asphyx"" is a 1973 British horror film directed by Peter Newbrook. It was also known as ""Spirit of the Dead"" and ""The Horror of Death"". It stars Robert Stephens and Robert Powell.It tells the exploits of rich Scientist-Philanthropist Sir Hugo Cunningham, who discovers an unimaginable blur being recorded while he searches the negatives of dying men whom he had recorded. Later on, at a party, he is making a motion picture of his wife and son, who are playing in a pool and ends up filming their accidental deaths as well. At first, Cunningham doesn't realize that he's captured that same misshapen blur on the camera, but once he does, he comes to a conclusion: that the blur is a person's soul leaving the body. It isn't until he re-examines the pictures and film however, that he makes the startling discovery that the blur was not moving away from the bodies of those who were dying, it was moving TOWARDS them. After doing some research, the good Doctor finds that he has found a ticket to immortality through the blur, an ancient Greek spirit known as an ""Asphyx"". According to legends, the spirit will appear only at the moment of a person's death to take them away to the Underworld. Cunningham, in his brilliant madness soon deduces that if he can only stop this process from happening at all, it would make any person immortal and unable to die... unless their particular Asphyx is released.The Doctor soon goes to his task and makes a deal with his adopted son for help in perfecting and utilizing the procedures, and, from there his laboratory becomes filled with torturous devices and instruments of death. He soon comes to understand however, that immortality comes at a high price, not easily fulfilled by mortal man.Creepy, huh?",4,Overlooked & Underhyped,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,1749,"['Asphyx', '1973', 'British', 'horror', 'film', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Newbrook', 'was', 'also', 'known', 'Spirit', 'Dead', 'Horror', 'Death', 'Robert', 'Stephens', 'Robert', 'Powell.It', 'exploits', 'rich', 'Scientist-Philanthropist', 'Sir', 'Hugo', 'Cunningham', 'who', 'unimaginable', 'blur', 'being', 'recorded', 'negatives', 'dying', 'men', 'whom', 'had', 'recorded', 'Later', 'party', 'making', 'motion', 'picture', 'wife', 'son', 'who', 'are', 'playing', 'pool', 'up', 'filming', 'accidental', 'deaths', 'well', 'first', 'Cunningham', ""n't"", 'realize', 'captured', 'same', 'misshapen', 'blur', 'camera', 'once', 'conclusion', 'blur', 'person', 'soul', 'leaving', 'body', ""n't"", 'pictures', 'film', 'however', 'startling', 'discovery', 'blur', 'was', 'not', 'moving', 'away', 'bodies', 'who', 'were', 'dying', 'was', 'moving', 'TOWARDS', 'doing', 'research', 'good', 'Doctor', 'found', 'ticket', 'immortality', 'blur', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'spirit', 'known', 'Asphyx', 'According', 'legends', 'spirit', 'will', 'appear', 'only', 'moment', 'person', 'death', 'take', 'away', 'Underworld', 'Cunningham', 'brilliant', 'madness', 'soon', 'deduces', 'can', 'only', 'stop', 'process', 'happening', 'would', 'make', 'person', 'immortal', 'unable', 'die', 'particular', 'Asphyx', 'released.The', 'Doctor', 'soon', 'task', 'deal', 'adopted', 'son', 'help', 'perfecting', 'utilizing', 'procedures', 'laboratory', 'filled', 'torturous', 'devices', 'instruments', 'death', 'soon', 'understand', 'however', 'immortality', 'high', 'price', 'not', 'easily', 'fulfilled', 'mortal', 'man.Creepy', 'huh']",N/A

He pursues this idea, with unintended consequences.Everything about this film is top flight.  Excellent cinematography, spot on costumes and period sets, very solid acting and an intriguing storyline characterize this highly entertaining film.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I quite liked it (it's a great addition to my collection).I wouldn't exactly classify it as horror or science fiction, it belongs somewhere in the middle.  The story is an advisory of sorts, don't muck about with powers you know nothing about.  Unfortunately, when tempted, man will investigate, experiment, and seek to do things he shouldn't.  The boob in question, scientist Sir Hugo Cunningham (Robert Stephens), is utterly fascinated with parapsychology.  He has a morbid preoccupation with dying and the notion of capturing a photo of the soul as it leaves the body.  Using the `smudges' evidenced on only 3 photos, Sir Hugo announces this as conclusive verification, his theory is sound.............but he needs further proof to satisfy family and colleagues.  ""It's all right.  I won't resort to murder.""  He does, however, show up at a local hanging, photo equipment in hand, to gain additional confirmation.  From that point on, a new plan surfaces.  He wants to capture his asphyx and thus achieve immortality.  Things don't run as smoothly as planned.  The results are ironic and terribly sad.Beautifully photographed by Oscar winning cinematographer Freddie Young, this movie is a stuffy but absorbing period piece.  People take time for tea before experiments.  They chat.  There is no monster (per se) but the asphyx does shriek in an unnerving fashion.  There are a couple of (tasteful) shocks.

The UK cut is beautiful. However, not so much in the expanded version. The history of the 2 cuts is a little muddy, but it seems some scenes were cut for the UK version due to censorship laws at the time. The full version was released in the US, so calling it the extended cut is a misnomer.There is a disclaimer on the long cut that states they ""inserted"" the added scenes from the US source which is a lower quality. That's an understatement! The transition is so jarring it can take you right out of the movie. I'm not talking about a minor shift, it looks like it was from an old tape and is windowboxed. In most instances it's in the middle of a scene.I still have my All Day version and it is the long cut. It is very typical of the early DVDs in that is not remastered in Hi-Def and is letterboxed. Even so the quality is the same thoughout and looks far better than what was used for this version. I wish Kino had tried that source instead.I've not seen the Hen's Tooth or region 2's but it leaves me wanting. Please comment if you have because there has got to be something better than this.Honestly, this is a niche movie that very few would have seen on it initial release.
