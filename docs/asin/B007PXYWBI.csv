1535909,ADA56HQ6DIP4U,B007PXYWBI,Carlton D. Fisher,"[4, 4]","This is the movie that introduced me to Parker Posey.  It's probably not for everyone, but it has a wicked sense of humor.  I don't want to give away too much about the plot, because, if you don't know anything going into the movie, it's doubly shocking/disturbingly hilarious.  This is definitely a dark comedy--the laughs are uncomfortable ones for the most part, but there is much to laugh at.  The screenplay is adapted from a stage play, and at times the filming retains some of that ""stagey"" feel to it--the dialogue can feel like clever theater dialogue rather than naturalistic film dialogue--but it is intelligent and witty, and there are some stand-out performances.  Tori Spelling and Freddie Prinze Jr. turn in decent performances considering they are not known for being the most dynamic actors.  They are relegated to supporting roles.  Genevieve Bujold as the mother is truly quirky and adds a wonderful touch to the entire proceeding, but Parker is the centerpiece and star.  As Jackie O--a girl living in the past, forever dressed as Jackie Kennedy like she was on one fateful Halloween in her childhood--she alternates between manic and psychotic with that edgy darkness that probably only Parker and a very few other actresses can still make likeable and funny.  This movie was the root of my obsession with her, and I have watched almost every movie she has ever made as a result.",5,One of Parker's Best!,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,1400,"['movie', 'introduced', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'probably', 'not', 'everyone', 'wicked', 'sense', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'going', 'movie', 'doubly', 'shocking/disturbingly', 'hilarious', 'definitely', 'dark', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'ones', 'most', 'part', 'much', 'laugh', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'times', 'filming', 'stagey', 'feel', 'dialogue', 'can', 'feel', 'clever', 'theater', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'naturalistic', 'film', 'dialogue', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'are', 'stand-out', 'performances', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'turn', 'decent', 'performances', 'considering', 'are', 'not', 'known', 'being', 'most', 'dynamic', 'actors', 'are', 'relegated', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Genevieve', 'Bujold', 'mother', 'truly', 'quirky', 'wonderful', 'touch', 'entire', 'proceeding', 'Parker', 'centerpiece', 'star', 'Jackie', 'O', 'girl', 'living', 'past', 'forever', 'dressed', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'one', 'fateful', 'Halloween', 'childhood', 'manic', 'psychotic', 'edgy', 'darkness', 'probably', 'only', 'Parker', 'very', 'few', 'other', 'actresses', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'likeable', 'funny', 'movie', 'was', 'root', 'obsession', 'have', 'watched', 'almost', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'result']",The House of Yes

1535911,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B007PXYWBI,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","As many have noted, adapting a play to film can be a tricky business. This is one of the better outings.Here's the scoop. A rich family, sans dad, lives on the east coast next to a Kennedy mansion. Sister Jackie O ( Parker Posey) is obsessed with the real Jackie O and the JFK assassination. She's unbalanced. When her twin brother arrives home, with a fiance, she pops a cork. Unfortunately her mom and brother have little better hold on reality the she so the going gets rough.This is of the absurdest vein of playwriting and is replete with goofy, clever dialogue. It's fun to take in even when you know the writing is for its own sake. The situation is way out there and, when a certain note in the relationship between the twins is revealed, an uncomfortable note enters the proceedings. The characters are good overall. The mom (Genevieve Boujold) might be the source for the craziness in the family, but she's crazy like a fox and manipulates everyone around her. Brother Marty (Josh Hamilton), on the outside, seems the most sane and is trying to keep it that way by marrying a near wallflower of a girl (Tori Spelling). But even he gets drawn back into the web once he hits home. Brother Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is probably the least believable of the lot. He's somewhere between dumb and nuts but doesn't quite fit in either space. They all dance madly around the situation. Jackie O' just loves her brother and doesn't want to let him go. She's the star here. I like Parker Posey and she grabs onto this role and shakes it like a dog with a stuffed toy. She alone is worth the price of admission.The acting is good overall. They didn't quite get the ""stage"" feeling away from it. It's all shot on a very few sets. One particular plot point with Prinze and Spelling just didn't work. It seemed it was there to move the plot in a particular direction, but this is still a good time. It's always a pleasure to see the English language used in such a fun and clever fashion.If you're at all predisposed to this sort of thing, this should fill your time well.",4,The House of Maybe,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,2070,"['many', 'have', 'noted', 'adapting', 'play', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'tricky', 'business', 'one', 'better', 'scoop', 'rich', 'family', 'sans', 'dad', 'east', 'coast', 'Kennedy', 'mansion', 'Sister', 'Jackie', 'O', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'obsessed', 'real', 'Jackie', 'O', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'unbalanced', 'When', 'twin', 'brother', 'home', 'fiance', 'cork', 'Unfortunately', 'mom', 'brother', 'have', 'little', 'better', 'hold', 'reality', 'so', 'going', 'rough.This', 'absurdest', 'vein', 'playwriting', 'replete', 'goofy', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'fun', 'take', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'writing', 'own', 'sake', 'situation', 'way', 'there', 'when', 'certain', 'note', 'relationship', 'twins', 'revealed', 'uncomfortable', 'note', 'proceedings', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'overall', 'mom', 'Genevieve', 'Boujold', 'might', 'be', 'source', 'craziness', 'family', 'crazy', 'fox', 'everyone', 'Brother', 'Marty', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'outside', 'most', 'sane', 'trying', 'keep', 'way', 'marrying', 'near', 'wallflower', 'girl', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'even', 'drawn', 'back', 'web', 'once', 'home', 'Brother', 'Anthony', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'probably', 'least', 'believable', 'lot', 'somewhere', 'dumb', 'nuts', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'space', 'dance', 'madly', 'situation', 'Jackie', 'O', 'just', 'brother', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'go', 'star', 'here', 'like', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'grabs', 'role', 'dog', 'stuffed', 'toy', 'alone', 'price', 'admission.The', 'acting', 'good', 'overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'stage', 'feeling', 'away', 'shot', 'very', 'few', 'sets', 'One', 'particular', 'plot', 'point', 'Prinze', 'Spelling', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'seemed', 'was', 'there', 'move', 'plot', 'particular', 'direction', 'still', 'good', 'time', 'always', 'pleasure', 'see', 'English', 'language', 'used', 'such', 'fun', 'clever', 'fashion.If', ""'re"", 'predisposed', 'sort', 'thing', 'should', 'fill', 'time', 'well']",The House of Yes
