1171046,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B001B8TUG0,Anthony Pittore,"[10, 13]","After a mishap with a new drug, the experiment's subjects (aka 'victims') turn into ravenous flesh-eating zombies. Locked up in a strip club, a group of exotic dancers must fight for their lives against the horde of undead or fall victim to the infectious bite of the rotting ghouls.Rookie director Jason Murphy brings another installment in the 'Undead Exotic Dancer' subsubgenre (being released just before Zombie Strippers! (2008)) with his film Zombies! Zombies! Zombies!. While I wasn't such a fan of the mildly entertaining Zombie Strippers!, I thought I would give this one a look to help viewers choose which Naked Flesheaters (title for the next one?) were more worth the watch. When it comes down to it, this film doesn't have to work very hard to please me. Horror-comedies make up a good amount of my favourite films (from Freaked to Shaun of the Dead, I'll take 'em all). Toss in zombies (the best subgenre in horror) and naked, blood-soaked women and you've got it made. Zombie Strippers! failed, for me, because it tried too hard without the ability to attain what it wanted to be. Had it simply take itself less seriously, it would've been more enjoyable. Luckily, Zombies! Zombies! Zombies! knew how to take itself for what it was: A fun, light-hearted zombie romp through a gentleman's club. The opening scene alone, while not technically part of the film itself, is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a horror film. It ranks up there with Nic Cage in a bear costume (though this one was intentionally hilarious). As a $200,000 budget would suggest, there are some pretty obvious problems. Most notably, the audio/video quality is very cheap. The sound ranges from ear-piercing to muffled and can get annoying. Also, the cheap shot-on-video look is something that has been putting off a lot of horror fans from modern low-budget cinema. It's something that needs to be looked past, however, in order to enjoy a film like this. It is helped, however, that the poor video quality is showing someone like Lyanna Tumaneng (who plays Dallas Skye). Beyond the a/v problems, the rest of the problems of low-budget filmmaking show, but the filmmakers knew how to utilize them in a way that makes them funny enough to laugh WITH instead of laugh AT. That's really what makes the film worth it. . . it knows it's bad, and it takes advantage of that. If cheesy schlock isn't for you, then neither is this film.Final verdict: 5.5/10 - Averaged from an 8/10 for entertainment and a 3/10 as a film.-AP3-",3,"Very fun, low-budget shlock horror",1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,2517,"['mishap', 'new', 'drug', 'experiment', 'subjects', ""'victims"", 'turn', 'ravenous', 'flesh-eating', 'zombies', 'Locked', 'up', 'strip', 'club', 'group', 'exotic', 'dancers', 'must', 'fight', 'lives', 'horde', 'undead', 'fall', 'victim', 'infectious', 'bite', 'rotting', 'ghouls.Rookie', 'director', 'Jason', 'Murphy', 'installment', ""'Undead"", 'Exotic', 'Dancer', 'subsubgenre', 'being', 'released', 'just', 'Zombie', 'Strippers', '2008', 'film', 'Zombies', 'Zombies', 'Zombies', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'fan', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'Zombie', 'Strippers', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'look', 'help', 'viewers', 'choose', 'Naked', 'Flesheaters', 'title', 'next', 'one', 'were', 'more', 'worth', 'watch', 'When', 'down', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'please', 'Horror-comedies', 'make', 'up', 'good', 'amount', 'favourite', 'films', 'Freaked', 'Shaun', 'Dead', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Toss', 'zombies', 'best', 'subgenre', 'horror', 'naked', 'blood-soaked', 'women', ""'ve"", 'got', 'made', 'Zombie', 'Strippers', 'failed', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'ability', 'attain', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'Had', 'simply', 'take', 'less', 'seriously', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Luckily', 'Zombies', 'Zombies', 'Zombies', 'knew', 'how', 'take', 'what', 'was', 'fun', 'light-hearted', 'zombie', 'romp', 'gentleman', 'club', 'opening', 'scene', 'alone', 'not', 'technically', 'part', 'film', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'horror', 'film', 'there', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'bear', 'costume', 'one', 'was', 'intentionally', 'hilarious', '200,000', 'budget', 'would', 'suggest', 'are', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'problems', 'Most', 'notably', 'audio/video', 'quality', 'very', 'cheap', 'sound', 'ear-piercing', 'muffled', 'can', 'get', 'annoying', 'Also', 'cheap', 'shot-on-video', 'look', 'something', 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'lot', 'horror', 'fans', 'modern', 'low-budget', 'cinema', 'something', 'be', 'looked', 'past', 'however', 'order', 'enjoy', 'film', 'helped', 'however', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'showing', 'someone', 'Lyanna', 'Tumaneng', 'who', 'Dallas', 'Skye', 'a/v', 'problems', 'rest', 'problems', 'low-budget', 'filmmaking', 'show', 'filmmakers', 'knew', 'how', 'utilize', 'way', 'funny', 'enough', 'laugh', 'WITH', 'instead', 'laugh', 'AT', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'bad', 'advantage', 'cheesy', 'schlock', ""n't"", 'then', 'film.Final', 'verdict', '5.5/10', 'Averaged', '8/10', 'entertainment', '3/10', 'film.-AP3-']",Zombies!

Actors are bad, production value is bad, but the worse part was the casting. The ""tough guy pimp"" is obviously not tough. The ""ladies man DJ"" seems like a gay guy trying, and failing, to act straight. There are others as well, but that's a large part of what makes this movie a joy to laugh at. Most of the women who actually bare themselves look good without a top on regardless of what American Soldier said. At least in my opinion anyway. I'm kind of glad this movie didn't have a larger budget though. I don't think I would have laughed half as hard as I did then. The extras in this movie are a treat to watch. You get to see these people who are in their first movie have it go to their head... hilarious!! I hope the let down isn't that hard on them when they find that this isn't a spring board to stardom for them.

1171052,A1NKJJCBBYVP4V,B001B8TUG0,"Philip C. Perron ""Philip""","[22, 25]","Now here is a film that was highly anticipated for months by many the horror fan and zombie fan alike.  Okay, the topic alone, strippers and zombies, is pure fluff for the gratuitous B-movie blood-and-boobs crowd (the B&B; crowd).  So if you like 1970's exploitation cinema or today's popcorn horror, you must be saying to yourself that you have to see this.  So let's talk about the film.The movie takes place around a gentleman's club right at the closing.  As one would figure, the film's characters are either bouncers or exotic dancers.  With a few setup scenes, we are brought to understand that an amoral scientist at a private/government facility has a connection with a small time suburban drug dealer.  The dealer, a swarmy overweight man, steals some experimental drugs while the scientist retrieves a fix for the man.  Eventually the dealer hooks up with a streetwalker and shares the experimental drug with her resulting in the beginning of a zombie outbreak (in the likes of 28 Days Later).  Since the streetwalker and her friends hang out waiting for johns at the gentleman's club, the epicenter of the outbreak is the parking lot of the club itself.  So far, so good, right?Well, this film could have been great for its genre.  Unfortunately it takes itself for what it is rather than trying to play out as a true horror or true exploitation film.  I'm as big a fan of horror comedy as anyone but the issue here is that there were too many characters that were true caricatures and obviously written to be that.  In most horror-comedies, the main protagonists are unaware that they are in such a film (i.e. Shaun of the Dead, Evil Dead 2, Feast, Dance of the Dead, etc.).  Here, however, we get a few characters that just don't work (specifically the pimp character and his main girlfriend).  As a result, we get a fun and entertaining film but ultimately a film that unrealized its potential.  Being a zombie stripper film, one would think that their would be a lot of blood and boobs.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case.  The gore will satisfy the B&B; crowd but the boobs are few for such a film.All in all, the film gets 3 stars.  There were a few standout performances especially Jessica Barton and many of the actors in smaller roles (such as the drug dealer, the main streetwalker, the DJ, and the scientist).  The screenplay was worthy with constant zombie and guts action, and the film had good set pieces.  The unrealized potential of the film, however, is unfortunate since this film could have been a cult classic; a true blood-and-boobs classic. Instead, we only get a popcorn film to enjoy.The DVD deserves mention as a standout.  The extras and documentaries were great.  The people behind this film, the writer and director, have great futures ahead of them.  And don't forget the cameo by Tiffany Shepis in a pre-credit five minute scene at the beginning of the film.  As always, she was great.",3,Worthy film to view but flawed,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,2928,"['Now', 'here', 'film', 'was', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'months', 'many', 'horror', 'fan', 'zombie', 'fan', 'alike', 'Okay', 'topic', 'alone', 'strippers', 'zombies', 'pure', 'fluff', 'gratuitous', 'B-movie', 'blood-and-boobs', 'crowd', 'B', 'B', 'crowd', 'So', 'like', '1970', 'exploitation', 'cinema', 'today', 'popcorn', 'horror', 'must', 'be', 'saying', 'yourself', 'have', 'see', 'So', 'let', 'talk', 'film.The', 'movie', 'place', 'gentleman', 'club', 'right', 'closing', 'one', 'would', 'figure', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'bouncers', 'exotic', 'dancers', 'few', 'setup', 'scenes', 'are', 'brought', 'understand', 'amoral', 'scientist', 'private/government', 'facility', 'connection', 'small', 'time', 'suburban', 'drug', 'dealer', 'dealer', 'swarmy', 'overweight', 'man', 'experimental', 'drugs', 'scientist', 'fix', 'man', 'Eventually', 'dealer', 'up', 'streetwalker', 'shares', 'experimental', 'drug', 'resulting', 'beginning', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'likes', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'streetwalker', 'friends', 'hang', 'out', 'waiting', 'johns', 'gentleman', 'club', 'epicenter', 'outbreak', 'parking', 'lot', 'club', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'right', 'Well', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'genre', 'what', 'rather', 'trying', 'play', 'out', 'true', 'horror', 'true', 'exploitation', 'film', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'horror', 'comedy', 'anyone', 'issue', 'here', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'were', 'true', 'caricatures', 'obviously', 'written', 'be', 'most', 'horror-comedies', 'main', 'protagonists', 'are', 'unaware', 'are', 'such', 'film', 'i.e', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2', 'Feast', 'Dance', 'Dead', 'etc.', 'Here', 'however', 'get', 'few', 'characters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'specifically', 'pimp', 'character', 'main', 'girlfriend', 'result', 'get', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', 'ultimately', 'film', 'unrealized', 'potential', 'Being', 'zombie', 'stripper', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'blood', 'boobs', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'case', 'gore', 'will', 'satisfy', 'B', 'B', 'crowd', 'boobs', 'are', 'few', 'film.All', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'were', 'few', 'standout', 'performances', 'especially', 'Jessica', 'Barton', 'many', 'actors', 'smaller', 'roles', 'such', 'drug', 'dealer', 'main', 'streetwalker', 'DJ', 'scientist', 'screenplay', 'was', 'worthy', 'constant', 'zombie', 'guts', 'action', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'set', 'pieces', 'unrealized', 'potential', 'film', 'however', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cult', 'classic', 'true', 'blood-and-boobs', 'classic', 'Instead', 'only', 'get', 'popcorn', 'film', 'enjoy.The', 'DVD', 'mention', 'standout', 'extras', 'documentaries', 'were', 'great', 'people', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'have', 'great', 'futures', 'ahead', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'cameo', 'Tiffany', 'Shepis', 'pre-credit', 'five', 'minute', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film', 'always', 'was', 'great']",Zombies!

So keep that in mind while reading my review.I was terrifed going into this film... sure if I hated it I could tell them that I hadn't watched it yet... but I wanted so badly for them to have made a good movie.And they did - well, good movie if you are a B-movie Zombie fan.  ZZZ is a strict B movie, filled with sub par acting, questionable sfx, and low production quality.  Where this movie excels is in it's fun factor.  So some junkie drug dealer steals some glowing crystals from a bio lab mistaking them for crack... then it ends up in the hands of a pack of crackwhores hanging out near the den of their arch-nemesis, the strippers.  Of course strippers and whores don't get along, so when the hoes turn man-eating zombie, it's up to the strippers and their flavor of the week boyfriends to try to defeat them.What surprised me most was how well thought out the script actually was - if you can get past the poor execution, they really did have a pretty decent script.  Since many of the bit parts were played by one of my favorite sketch comedy troupes (doodiehumor) there were plenty of laughs involved.  I wasn't going to review this because I was afraid I would love it just for seeing all of their faces (it's been too long) but my husband who has never met any of these people before had to pause the movie twice because he was laughing so hard. (Once was a line in the diner, and the second was in the club with the pimp).  The best actors were our main hero who played an excellent deadpan normal guy, The Bouncer, and I've wavered back and forth on the pimp.  At first I hated him, but by the end of the film he had really grown on me.Do I recommend this film to everyone?  NO! But I do recommend it to B movie Zombie fans.  There are boobies but not as many as you would expect given the setting, and there is plenty of blood and gore, in all shapes and colors, both good and bad.In the end I would summarize this as an excellent group popcorn and beer flick for everyone to laugh and enjoy provided you have low expectations on production value and acting.",3,One of the Funnier Zombie Flicks out there,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,2251,"['start', 'am', 'bit', 'biased', 'knew', 'many', 'people', 'involved', 'film', 'High', 'School', 'College', 'have', 'fallen', 'touch', 'many', 'years', 'So', 'keep', 'mind', 'reading', 'review.I', 'was', 'terrifed', 'going', 'film', 'sure', 'hated', 'could', 'tell', 'had', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', 'wanted', 'so', 'badly', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'movie.And', 'did', 'well', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'B-movie', 'Zombie', 'fan', 'ZZZ', 'strict', 'B', 'movie', 'filled', 'sub', 'par', 'acting', 'questionable', 'sfx', 'low', 'production', 'quality', 'Where', 'movie', 'fun', 'factor', 'junkie', 'drug', 'dealer', 'glowing', 'crystals', 'bio', 'lab', 'mistaking', 'crack', 'then', 'up', 'hands', 'pack', 'crackwhores', 'hanging', 'out', 'den', 'arch-nemesis', 'strippers', 'course', 'strippers', 'whores', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'when', 'hoes', 'turn', 'man-eating', 'zombie', 'up', 'strippers', 'flavor', 'week', 'try', 'defeat', 'them.What', 'surprised', 'most', 'was', 'how', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'script', 'actually', 'was', 'can', 'get', 'poor', 'execution', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'pretty', 'decent', 'script', 'many', 'bit', 'parts', 'were', 'played', 'one', 'favorite', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'troupes', 'doodiehumor', 'were', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'involved', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'review', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'love', 'just', 'seeing', 'been', 'too', 'long', 'husband', 'who', 'never', 'met', 'people', 'before', 'had', 'pause', 'movie', 'twice', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'Once', 'was', 'line', 'diner', 'second', 'was', 'club', 'pimp', 'best', 'actors', 'were', 'main', 'hero', 'who', 'played', 'excellent', 'deadpan', 'normal', 'guy', 'Bouncer', ""'ve"", 'wavered', 'back', 'forth', 'pimp', 'first', 'hated', 'end', 'film', 'had', 'really', 'grown', 'me.Do', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'NO', 'do', 'recommend', 'B', 'movie', 'Zombie', 'fans', 'are', 'boobies', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'would', 'expect', 'given', 'setting', 'plenty', 'blood', 'gore', 'shapes', 'colors', 'good', 'end', 'would', 'summarize', 'excellent', 'group', 'popcorn', 'beer', 'flick', 'everyone', 'laugh', 'enjoy', 'provided', 'have', 'low', 'expectations', 'production', 'value', 'acting']",Zombies!

1171054,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001B8TUG0,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 5]","Zombies! Zombies! Zombies! (Jason Murphy, 2008)So let me ask you: why is it that, after the great zombie revolution of 1968, and the great zombie revitalizations of 1985 and 2004, it took someone forty years to make the most obvious movie ever: zombies vs. strippers? I mean, it seems to me that they go together like oil and vinegar. Potatoes and dill. Brains and... okay, I'll stop that one before I piss someone off.In this typically cheesy, low-budget affair, a scientific experiment goes wrong (big surprise) and unleashes a horde of hungry zombies. Being for the most part men, the zombies do what is expected of them: they head for the nearest strip club. A bevy of different types of folks, including a number of strippers, one stripper's boyfriend, a bouncer, and a brutal pimp, among others, are trapped by the zombies, and have to both survive the night (why do they always have to survive the night? Zombies don't go away in daytime) and figure out where the zombies came from to see if they can come up with any clues to stop them.It was quite a pleasant surprise to me that the script here, the first feature-length offering from screenwriter Anthony Steven Giordano, is clever and witty, if not subtle most of the time. I actually laughed out loud two or three times, which is rare for me when watching zombedies; there are quite a few amusing ones, but laugh-out-loud funny is rare. Unfortunately, the script is the only thing that really distinguishes the movie; the acting is sometimes competent, but generally not, while the special effects are about the level one would usually find in a high school movie shot direct to video. (Actually, given the existence of Pathogen, that's not strictly true; the special effects there were a fair sight better.) Still, it's not an entirely awful movie, and if you're the kind of person who can judge a movie by the potential it almost realizes, then you'll get a few kicks out of this. **",2,Amusing enough.,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,1947,"['Zombies', 'Zombies', 'Zombies', 'Jason', 'Murphy', '2008', 'So', 'let', 'ask', 'why', 'great', 'zombie', 'revolution', '1968', 'great', 'zombie', 'revitalizations', '1985', '2004', 'took', 'someone', 'forty', 'years', 'make', 'most', 'obvious', 'movie', 'ever', 'zombies', 'strippers', 'mean', 'go', 'together', 'like', 'oil', 'vinegar', 'Potatoes', 'dill', 'Brains', 'okay', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'one', 'piss', 'someone', 'off.In', 'typically', 'cheesy', 'low-budget', 'affair', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'wrong', 'big', 'surprise', 'horde', 'hungry', 'zombies', 'Being', 'most', 'part', 'men', 'zombies', 'do', 'what', 'expected', 'head', 'nearest', 'strip', 'club', 'bevy', 'different', 'types', 'folks', 'including', 'number', 'strippers', 'one', 'stripper', 'boyfriend', 'bouncer', 'brutal', 'pimp', 'others', 'are', 'trapped', 'zombies', 'have', 'survive', 'night', 'why', 'do', 'always', 'have', 'survive', 'night', 'Zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'daytime', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'zombies', 'came', 'see', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'clues', 'stop', 'them.It', 'was', 'quite', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'script', 'here', 'first', 'feature-length', 'offering', 'screenwriter', 'Anthony', 'Steven', 'Giordano', 'clever', 'witty', 'not', 'subtle', 'most', 'time', 'actually', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'rare', 'when', 'watching', 'zombedies', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'amusing', 'ones', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'rare', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'movie', 'acting', 'sometimes', 'competent', 'generally', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'level', 'one', 'would', 'usually', 'find', 'high', 'school', 'movie', 'shot', 'direct', 'video', 'Actually', 'given', 'existence', 'Pathogen', 'not', 'strictly', 'true', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'fair', 'sight', 'better', 'Still', 'not', 'entirely', 'awful', 'movie', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'judge', 'movie', 'potential', 'almost', 'then', ""'ll"", 'get', 'few', 'kicks', '**']",Zombies!

This film is Night of the Living Dead meets Striptease...is it any good?The film is certainly entertaining, but it should have been much better.  For every positive there are two negatives.  For starters, if you are making a movie about strippers there had damn well better be more than a few seconds of exposed female goodness.  The hottest stripper is the fake, catty, blonde bombshell, Dakota (Jessica Barton) who performs a titillating lap dance and all we get is a peek-a-boo nipple through a tuft of hair!  WTF!?!  I want to see topless bimbos blasting zombies with pump action shotguns whose kickback causes fake boobies to jiggle uncontrollably.  Don't sell me a horse and then hand me a pig dammit.To be fair, it's not all bad.  The focus is clearly on the zombie action.  There are some fun special effects and practically every weapon that is a staple of the genre is on display.  Sadly, much of the effective zombie splatter is overshadowed by the amateurish CG effects.  The ending in particular looks like a scene from the videogame instead of a live action film.  I would have much preferred a more basic and organic approach.  The zombies do look good and they nail the slow and steady variation made famous by Romero.Some of the more memorable characters are the aforementioned Dakota, the slap happy Pimp Johnny ""Backhand"" Vegas (Anthony Headen), and the reluctant hero Chris (Sean Harriman). Headen steals every scene he can as he channels Bernie Mac while Harriman won me over with his average Joe, deadpan delivery.  The rest of the cast was pretty bad, but I've seen much worse in movies with larger budgets.I didn't love this movie nor did I hate it.  It could have been better, but given the inexperience of the people making it, they certainly did a commendable job.  It scores points for being the first film that turns whores into zombies via smoking crack, but there are too many glaring flaws to fully appreciate the sleazy genius on display.  Strippers vs zombies is an unreal premise and I hope that someday a more capable film crew can take the idea and run with it.Final Grade: C-",2,A+ Premise Mired with Lackluster Execution,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,2254,"['Zombies', 'strippers', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'combination', 'chunky', 'slob', 'slathered', 'peanut', 'butter', 'jelly', 'couple', 'slices', 'bread', 'film', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Striptease', 'good', 'film', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'positive', 'are', 'two', 'negatives', 'starters', 'are', 'making', 'movie', 'strippers', 'had', 'damn', 'well', 'better', 'be', 'more', 'few', 'seconds', 'exposed', 'female', 'goodness', 'hottest', 'stripper', 'fake', 'catty', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'Dakota', 'Jessica', 'Barton', 'who', 'titillating', 'lap', 'dance', 'get', 'peek-a-boo', 'nipple', 'tuft', 'hair', 'WTF', 'want', 'see', 'topless', 'bimbos', 'blasting', 'zombies', 'pump', 'action', 'shotguns', 'kickback', 'fake', 'boobies', 'jiggle', 'uncontrollably', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sell', 'horse', 'then', 'hand', 'pig', 'dammit.To', 'be', 'fair', 'not', 'bad', 'focus', 'clearly', 'zombie', 'action', 'are', 'fun', 'special', 'effects', 'practically', 'weapon', 'staple', 'genre', 'display', 'Sadly', 'much', 'effective', 'zombie', 'splatter', 'overshadowed', 'amateurish', 'CG', 'effects', 'ending', 'particular', 'looks', 'scene', 'videogame', 'instead', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'preferred', 'more', 'basic', 'organic', 'approach', 'zombies', 'do', 'look', 'good', 'nail', 'slow', 'steady', 'variation', 'made', 'famous', 'Romero.Some', 'more', 'memorable', 'characters', 'are', 'aforementioned', 'Dakota', 'slap', 'happy', 'Pimp', 'Johnny', 'Backhand', 'Vegas', 'Anthony', 'Headen', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'Chris', 'Sean', 'Harriman', 'Headen', 'steals', 'scene', 'can', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Harriman', 'won', 'over', 'average', 'Joe', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'much', 'worse', 'movies', 'larger', 'budgets.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'movie', 'did', 'hate', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'given', 'inexperience', 'people', 'making', 'certainly', 'did', 'commendable', 'job', 'points', 'being', 'first', 'film', 'zombies', 'smoking', 'crack', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'glaring', 'flaws', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'sleazy', 'genius', 'display', 'Strippers', 'vs', 'zombies', 'unreal', 'premise', 'hope', 'more', 'capable', 'film', 'crew', 'can', 'take', 'idea', 'run', 'it.Final', 'Grade', 'C-']",Zombies!

I loved this movie!  This film is great fun.  Don't expect great acting.  At best it's below average.  But thats okay, it works for this film.

Will they seriously just put anything on film and thrust it onto a DVD and shove it into a bargain bin at Best Buy or throw it up on Netflix?What do people like?  Well they like large breasted topless women and they like zombie movies where people hole up in a place and try to fight them off.  Throw them together, sure that sounds like a block buster hit to me!The video quality is crap, the story is so lame that it's almost painful, the acting is completely awful.  The sets look like they found an old abandoned building and threw some vials of color water up on Bunsen burners and presto!  We've got a science lab to do science stuff in!  Then get one of the actors to have their buddy who owns a diner let us shoot there after hours and then throw in a strip club that looks faker than a political candidate's smile on election day, pump in some 3rd rate dance music that was thrown together using Windows Media Player and presto!  We've got a stip club!  And those are our locations for the entire film!  On top of that, the CGI effects were so lame that they looked faker than the actress's breasts during the topless scenes!The only good part of this movie was we had the black pimp quoting Samuel L Jackson's famous line from Snakes on a Plane.Just, oh my god!  My brain hurts from how awful this movie was!  How do I get the 80 minutes of my life back that I wasted watching this piece of celluloid garbage!?!Stay away and warn others!
