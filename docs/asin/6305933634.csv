For most of them, the heartache was only just beginning; liberation and the end of the War for them were not the same as they were for the soldiers who had fought in the War or the non-Jewish people who had been in the camps or in the various nation-states across Europe.  Many of them found they had no home to go back to, and were often greeted with hatred and disgust that they'd dared to return and survive.  Some angry villagers even killed the returning survivors, as happened in the Kielce pogrom of 1946.  During and before WWII, most of the nations in the world had sealed their borders against the people trying to immigrate before the Nazis devoured them, and even after the War finally ended, they continued keeping them out.  Even nations that hadn't been able to wait to get rid of them, such as Poland and Hungary, now made it very difficult for the ""repatriated"" survivors to leave, and many of them had to be smuggled out in very secretive dangerous border crossings, with border guards who had to be bribed heavily.  The initial destination for many of them was a DP camp.  Many of these camps were in Germany, and were in the very sites of actual concentration-camps.  The Americans running them insisted barbed wire be strung along the fences and that armed guards be in watch towers.  There also often wasn't enough to eat, there was little privacy, and the people still had to sleep on the wooden planks.  The only difference between life in a DP camp and life in a concentration-camp was that in the DP camps the Allies running them weren't exterminating people or physically abusing them.  And yet in spite of all of this, the amount of marriages and children being born were totally off of the charts, people finding one another and recreating families, getting together out of loneliness, these people who never would have found one another or considered getting married under such circumstances, after such short courtships, were it not for the Shoah.97% of the survivors wanted to go to Israel, and when asked for a second destination, hundreds wrote ""The crematorium"" on their applications.  Many survivors did go to other places, such as Australia, America (which was still holding to its pre-war racist xenophobia immigration quotas, coupled with millions of citizens who didn't want any immigrants either), Canada, and South America.  But for the majority, Israel was the only place they could envision themselves being.  The British too were keeping the survivors out of Israel, and only six ships managed to elude being captured.  The rest were pirated, many of the people on board severely abused, and sent to concentration-camps on Cyprus.  And yet these people still kept hoping for the day when they would be released and would finally live as free people again, in their own land.  Some of them even admitted they were only surviving and getting through these postwar years so their children would have a future.  The world closed its doors and its eyes and ears while millions of people were slaughtered and barely changed its tune after the War, but as these people proved on their long road home, they were strong enough to survive another round of hardships and never gave up on their dream of going home.",5,Highly recommended,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,3417,"['two-hour', 'Oscar-winning', 'documentary', 'great', 'job', 'narrating', 'events', '1945-48', 'survivors', 'Shoah', 'often', 'horrific', 'ordeal', 'refugees', 'most', 'heartache', 'was', 'only', 'just', 'beginning', 'liberation', 'end', 'War', 'were', 'not', 'same', 'were', 'soldiers', 'who', 'had', 'fought', 'War', 'non-Jewish', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'camps', 'various', 'nation-states', 'Europe', 'Many', 'found', 'had', 'home', 'go', 'back', 'were', 'often', 'greeted', 'hatred', 'disgust', ""'d"", 'dared', 'return', 'survive', 'angry', 'villagers', 'even', 'killed', 'returning', 'survivors', 'happened', 'Kielce', 'pogrom', '1946', 'WWII', 'most', 'nations', 'world', 'had', 'sealed', 'borders', 'people', 'trying', 'immigrate', 'Nazis', 'devoured', 'even', 'War', 'finally', 'ended', 'continued', 'keeping', 'out', 'Even', 'nations', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'wait', 'get', 'rid', 'such', 'Poland', 'Hungary', 'now', 'very', 'difficult', 'repatriated', 'survivors', 'leave', 'many', 'had', 'be', 'smuggled', 'out', 'very', 'secretive', 'dangerous', 'border', 'crossings', 'border', 'guards', 'who', 'had', 'be', 'bribed', 'heavily', 'initial', 'destination', 'many', 'was', 'DP', 'camp', 'Many', 'camps', 'were', 'Germany', 'were', 'very', 'actual', 'concentration-camps', 'Americans', 'running', 'insisted', 'barbed', 'wire', 'be', 'strung', 'fences', 'armed', 'guards', 'be', 'watch', 'towers', 'also', 'often', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'eat', 'was', 'little', 'privacy', 'people', 'still', 'had', 'sleep', 'wooden', 'planks', 'only', 'difference', 'life', 'DP', 'camp', 'life', 'concentration-camp', 'was', 'DP', 'Allies', 'running', 'were', ""n't"", 'exterminating', 'people', 'physically', 'abusing', 'yet', 'spite', 'amount', 'marriages', 'children', 'being', 'born', 'were', 'totally', 'charts', 'people', 'finding', 'one', 'recreating', 'families', 'getting', 'together', 'loneliness', 'people', 'who', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'one', 'considered', 'getting', 'married', 'such', 'circumstances', 'such', 'short', 'courtships', 'were', 'not', 'Shoah.97', '%', 'survivors', 'wanted', 'go', 'Israel', 'when', 'asked', 'second', 'destination', 'hundreds', 'wrote', 'crematorium', 'applications', 'Many', 'survivors', 'did', 'go', 'other', 'places', 'such', 'Australia', 'America', 'was', 'still', 'holding', 'pre-war', 'racist', 'xenophobia', 'immigration', 'quotas', 'coupled', 'millions', 'citizens', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'immigrants', 'Canada', 'South', 'America', 'majority', 'Israel', 'was', 'only', 'place', 'could', 'envision', 'being', 'British', 'too', 'were', 'keeping', 'survivors', 'Israel', 'only', 'six', 'ships', 'managed', 'elude', 'being', 'captured', 'rest', 'were', 'pirated', 'many', 'people', 'board', 'severely', 'abused', 'sent', 'concentration-camps', 'Cyprus', 'yet', 'people', 'still', 'kept', 'hoping', 'day', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'would', 'finally', 'live', 'free', 'people', 'again', 'own', 'land', 'even', 'admitted', 'were', 'only', 'surviving', 'getting', 'postwar', 'years', 'so', 'children', 'would', 'have', 'future', 'world', 'closed', 'doors', 'eyes', 'ears', 'millions', 'people', 'were', 'slaughtered', 'barely', 'changed', 'tune', 'War', 'people', 'proved', 'long', 'road', 'home', 'were', 'strong', 'enough', 'survive', 'round', 'hardships', 'never', 'gave', 'up', 'dream', 'going', 'home']",N/A

This remarkable documentary fills in the missing piece between this period and the creation of the state of Israel.  It was an excruciatingly difficult transition.  From the concentration camps, the Jews went to displaced persons camp because they could not return to their old ways of life.  These camps were scarcely an improvement.  As one survivor states, ""The Nazis killed us, but the Allies do not let us live.""  Anti-Semitic feelings remained strong among the people of surrounding countries as well as the ranks of the Allies themselves.  The Jews began to work toward a homeland and many survivors made the difficult journey to Palestine, only to be blocked by the British, who still administrated that land in these final years of their colonial empire, and sent to still other camps on the island of Cyprus.  The film also covers the debate in the United Nations concerning Israel, the strong support from U.S. President Harry Truman despite ambivalence among his Cabinet, and the opposition of the Arabs.Featuring incredible archival footage, fascinating interviews, and skilled actors performing the testimonies of eyewitnesses, this important film casts light on a period of world history that is often glossed over.",5,After the happy ending,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,1360,"['Much', 'been', 'said', 'Holocaust', 'stories', 'usually', 'end', 'liberation', 'Jews', 'concentration', 'camps', 'remarkable', 'documentary', 'fills', 'missing', 'piece', 'period', 'creation', 'state', 'Israel', 'was', 'excruciatingly', 'difficult', 'transition', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Jews', 'went', 'displaced', 'persons', 'camp', 'could', 'not', 'return', 'old', 'ways', 'life', 'camps', 'were', 'scarcely', 'improvement', 'one', 'survivor', 'states', 'Nazis', 'killed', 'Allies', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'live', 'Anti-Semitic', 'feelings', 'remained', 'strong', 'people', 'surrounding', 'countries', 'as', 'well', 'ranks', 'Allies', 'Jews', 'began', 'work', 'homeland', 'many', 'survivors', 'made', 'difficult', 'journey', 'Palestine', 'only', 'be', 'blocked', 'British', 'who', 'still', 'administrated', 'land', 'final', 'years', 'colonial', 'empire', 'sent', 'still', 'other', 'camps', 'island', 'Cyprus', 'film', 'also', 'debate', 'United', 'Nations', 'concerning', 'Israel', 'strong', 'support', 'U.S.', 'President', 'Harry', 'Truman', 'ambivalence', 'Cabinet', 'opposition', 'Arabs.Featuring', 'incredible', 'archival', 'footage', 'fascinating', 'interviews', 'skilled', 'actors', 'performing', 'testimonies', 'eyewitnesses', 'important', 'film', 'casts', 'light', 'period', 'world', 'history', 'often', 'glossed', 'over']",N/A

483289,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,6305933634,Jack E. Levic,"[0, 0]","THE LONG WAY HOME tells a very often overlooked part of the aftermath of the Holocaust. There have been countless stories about the Holocaust and how people survived in horrific conditions againts impossible odds. Here is the stroy of what one might call surviving the survival. What happened to Holocaust survivors immediately after liberation? Where does a person go when he or she has lost everything and everyone in his life?From the ashes of the Holocaust was born the modern Jewish state of Israel. After liberation, concentration camp survivors became ""disaplaced persons."" Displacement camps were set up to house them. At times they were back in concentration camps and in situations not much better than before. As someone mentions in the documentary, they were back in concentration camps but without the mass killings.THE LONG WAY HOME was the ACADEMY AWARD winning Best Documentary in 1997. With archival footage and interviews with survivors, an heartbreaking story is told. This story focuses on the Jewish displaced persons and the fight to create a homeland in Israel. Officially stateless, most survivors had no homes left. Poland is singled out as a country that denounced returning Jews and communists and less than human. Stories are told of over 40 of 200 Jews in a community being killed by a lynch mob. Only the wretched displaced persons camps had some safety. Attempts were made to cross the Mediterranean into Palestin. The British controlled Palestine and limited the number of refugees alowed in. Thousands of refugees were forced back to Europe or sent to displacement camps on Cyprus.Being a survivor wasn't a cause for celebration or respect from others. Survivor's guilt was strong. One survivor tells of being one of the lucky ones to go to the US. Her family does want to hear about her experiences. In fact, she is told that the Jews in America ""had it rough, too."" This is a story of a nearly destroyed people who fought to live and rebuild their lives.The stories are fascinating as is the archival footage. Stories are told of the British Prime Minister ranting against the Jews. Anti-semitism was in overdrive at the time. For the Jews, a homeland in Palestine was the only solution.This documentary is full of information and thought-provoking stories, but it is one sided as it focuses on the Jewish side of the story. The Arabs in Palestine are portrayed as not willing to compromise with a two state solution - an Arab Palestine and a Jewish Israel. It seems like this issue is worthy of more attention and its own documentary. A lot of questions arise. What happened to other non-Jewish Holocaust survivors? They have a story thats hould be told. What about the Palestinians and the concern over the huge influx of Jewish refugees. There are so many stories here. THE LONG WAY HOME probably could have just focused on the plight of the survivors after liberation - the reactions by American soldiers to the sight of concentration camp survivors, the fact that  many starving survivors died from the shock of having too much food. There is so much here. Certainly, WWII and the Holocaust changed the world forever and generations will be discussing the aftermath of the war.",5,HEARTWENCHING STORY OF SURVIVING AS A SURVIVOR,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,3217,"['LONG', 'WAY', 'HOME', 'very', 'often', 'overlooked', 'part', 'aftermath', 'Holocaust', 'have', 'been', 'countless', 'stories', 'Holocaust', 'how', 'people', 'survived', 'horrific', 'conditions', 'againts', 'impossible', 'odds', 'Here', 'stroy', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'call', 'surviving', 'survival', 'What', 'happened', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'immediately', 'liberation', 'Where', 'person', 'go', 'when', 'lost', 'everything', 'everyone', 'life', 'ashes', 'Holocaust', 'was', 'born', 'modern', 'Jewish', 'state', 'Israel', 'liberation', 'concentration', 'camp', 'survivors', 'became', 'disaplaced', 'persons', 'Displacement', 'camps', 'were', 'set', 'up', 'house', 'times', 'were', 'back', 'concentration', 'camps', 'situations', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'before', 'someone', 'mentions', 'documentary', 'were', 'back', 'concentration', 'camps', 'mass', 'killings.THE', 'LONG', 'WAY', 'HOME', 'was', 'ACADEMY', 'AWARD', 'winning', 'Best', 'Documentary', '1997', 'archival', 'footage', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'heartbreaking', 'story', 'told', 'story', 'Jewish', 'displaced', 'persons', 'fight', 'create', 'homeland', 'Israel', 'Officially', 'stateless', 'most', 'survivors', 'had', 'homes', 'left', 'Poland', 'singled', 'out', 'country', 'denounced', 'returning', 'Jews', 'communists', 'less', 'human', 'Stories', 'are', 'told', '40', '200', 'Jews', 'community', 'being', 'killed', 'lynch', 'mob', 'Only', 'wretched', 'displaced', 'persons', 'camps', 'had', 'safety', 'Attempts', 'were', 'made', 'cross', 'Mediterranean', 'Palestin', 'British', 'controlled', 'Palestine', 'limited', 'number', 'refugees', 'alowed', 'Thousands', 'refugees', 'were', 'forced', 'back', 'Europe', 'sent', 'displacement', 'camps', 'Cyprus.Being', 'survivor', 'was', ""n't"", 'cause', 'celebration', 'respect', 'others', 'Survivor', 'guilt', 'was', 'strong', 'One', 'survivor', 'tells', 'being', 'one', 'lucky', 'ones', 'go', 'US', 'family', 'want', 'hear', 'experiences', 'fact', 'told', 'Jews', 'America', 'had', 'rough', 'too', 'story', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'people', 'who', 'fought', 'live', 'rebuild', 'lives.The', 'stories', 'are', 'fascinating', 'archival', 'footage', 'Stories', 'are', 'told', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'ranting', 'Jews', 'Anti-semitism', 'was', 'overdrive', 'time', 'Jews', 'homeland', 'Palestine', 'was', 'only', 'solution.This', 'documentary', 'full', 'information', 'thought-provoking', 'stories', 'one', 'sided', 'Jewish', 'side', 'story', 'Arabs', 'Palestine', 'are', 'portrayed', 'not', 'willing', 'compromise', 'two', 'state', 'solution', 'Arab', 'Palestine', 'Jewish', 'Israel', 'issue', 'worthy', 'more', 'attention', 'own', 'documentary', 'lot', 'questions', 'arise', 'What', 'happened', 'other', 'non-Jewish', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'have', 'story', 'thats', 'hould', 'be', 'told', 'What', 'Palestinians', 'concern', 'huge', 'influx', 'Jewish', 'refugees', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'stories', 'here', 'THE', 'LONG', 'WAY', 'HOME', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'focused', 'plight', 'survivors', 'liberation', 'reactions', 'American', 'soldiers', 'sight', 'concentration', 'camp', 'survivors', 'fact', 'many', 'starving', 'survivors', 'died', 'shock', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'food', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'Certainly', 'WWII', 'Holocaust', 'changed', 'world', 'forever', 'generations', 'will', 'be', 'discussing', 'aftermath', 'war']",N/A
483290,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,6305933634,Joe Sherry,"[40, 40]","A film by Mark Jonathan HarrisWinner of the 1997 Academy Award for Best Documentary, ""The Long Way Home"" is the story of the Jewish survivors of the Nazi Holocaust and what happened after the concentration camps were liberated.  This is a very important, though little told story.  Much of what I have been taught glosses over this period, telling only that Americans helped to liberate the camps and then three years later the nation of Israel was formed by the United Nations.  ""The Long Way Home"" is the story of how the Jewish survivors made it from the camps to having their own nation, and the title of the film is a very apt one.  It was a long, long way home and for many of the survivors, the war did not truly end until they made it to Israel.We are taken through the horror of the Jewish experience from the end of the concentration camps up through the creation of the state of Israel.  After the camps, when we might expect that the situation of the survivors would improve dramatically, it didn't.  There were so many survivors, so many ""displaced persons"" that the Allied Forces had to set up camps of their own to provide shelter as the survivors can get medical treatment and food.  Many of these camps had the misfortune to be surrounded by barbed wire, so that some survivors remarked that it was as if they traded one camp for another and nothing had changed.  From these temporary camps for ""displaced persons"" (as the survivors were called), the survivors were searching for a home even though they no longer had a home in their native countries.  Finding passage to Palestine was just as difficult.Somehow I naively assumed that after the war the survivors had an easier time in founding Israel and finally finding peace in their lives (whatever peace that was left to be found), but this film shows the Jewish people in a constant struggle even as nations that had fought to help free them from the concentration camps turned their backs on the Jewish people.  This is a powerful, powerful story and the documentary does it justice.  I don't know what other documentaries came out in 1997, but I can scarcely imagine one that is nearly as good as this one.

Between their ""liberation"" by allied forces in 1945 and the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, many were held as ""DPs"" (displaced persons) in camps throughout Europe.  In many cases, they were detained in the same camp in Germany in which they had spent the holocaust and often under very similar conditions.  Many Jews died in these camps after the liberation, as the world stuggled to determine what to do with the thousands of survivors.  The concept of a Jewish state or homeland started to gain traction, leading in 1948 to the formation of the state of Israel.  However, these 3 years were filled with turmoil for most survivors.  Through interviews with survivors and the use of archival footage, ""The Long Way Home"" recounts this difficult journey.This documentary does an excellent job of simplifying the complex political story behind these years.  I've read several accounts of this time period previously and come away somewhat confused by the political complexities.  ""The Long Way Home"" is obviously told from the perspective of the Jewish people, with a focus on their suffering during this period; any anti-Israeli sentiments are given little emphasis.  However, even with this drawback, it's an important documentary.I have a few minor quibbles with how this documentary is presented.  First, numerous quotes from survivors are presented; however, these quotes are read by movie actors without any indication of the name of their source.  By not identifying their source, it makes the survivors that much more faceless.  Second, the documentary is often lax about presenting dates and details that would help put the story into greater context.  However, overall, ""The Long Way Home"" is a moving and effective document about an important time in our recent history that has often been given short shrift in other documentaries.  The film was awarded the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, winning over Spike Lee's acclaimed ""4 little Girls.""  Lee has been critical of ""The Long Way Home,"" claiming that the second half of the movie was little more than Pro-Israeli propaganda; see the film and judge for yourself.",5,Moving documentary,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,2250,"['Long', 'Way', 'Home', '1997', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'many', 'Jewish', 'survivors', 'holocaust', 'Between', 'liberation', 'allied', 'forces', '1945', 'formation', 'state', 'Israel', '1948', 'many', 'were', 'held', 'DPs', 'displaced', 'persons', 'camps', 'Europe', 'many', 'cases', 'were', 'detained', 'same', 'camp', 'Germany', 'had', 'spent', 'holocaust', 'often', 'very', 'similar', 'conditions', 'Many', 'Jews', 'died', 'camps', 'liberation', 'world', 'stuggled', 'determine', 'what', 'do', 'thousands', 'survivors', 'concept', 'Jewish', 'state', 'homeland', 'started', 'gain', 'traction', 'leading', '1948', 'formation', 'state', 'Israel', 'However', '3', 'years', 'were', 'filled', 'turmoil', 'most', 'survivors', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'use', 'archival', 'footage', 'Long', 'Way', 'Home', 'difficult', 'journey.This', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'job', 'simplifying', 'complex', 'political', 'story', 'years', ""'ve"", 'read', 'several', 'accounts', 'time', 'period', 'previously', 'come', 'away', 'somewhat', 'confused', 'political', 'complexities', 'Long', 'Way', 'Home', 'obviously', 'told', 'perspective', 'Jewish', 'people', 'focus', 'suffering', 'period', 'anti-Israeli', 'sentiments', 'are', 'given', 'little', 'emphasis', 'However', 'even', 'drawback', 'important', 'documentary.I', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'how', 'documentary', 'presented', 'First', 'numerous', 'quotes', 'survivors', 'are', 'presented', 'however', 'quotes', 'are', 'read', 'movie', 'actors', 'indication', 'name', 'source', 'not', 'identifying', 'source', 'survivors', 'much', 'more', 'faceless', 'Second', 'documentary', 'often', 'lax', 'presenting', 'dates', 'details', 'would', 'help', 'put', 'story', 'greater', 'context', 'However', 'overall', 'Long', 'Way', 'Home', 'moving', 'effective', 'document', 'important', 'time', 'recent', 'history', 'often', 'been', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'other', 'documentaries', 'film', 'was', 'awarded', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Feature', 'winning', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'acclaimed', '4', 'little', 'Girls', 'Lee', 'been', 'critical', 'Long', 'Way', 'Home', 'claiming', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'Pro-Israeli', 'propaganda', 'see', 'film', 'judge']",N/A

Winner of the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1997, ""The Long Way Home"" traces the journey of survivors of the Holocaust in the post-liberation period in 1945 till the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. Morgan Freeman is the main narrator and does an excellent job in stirring one's emotions though this painful, arduous and epic journey. There are other narrators that convey the feelings and experiences of the various survivors, and testimonies by actual survivors such as Israel Lau, Chief Rabbi of Israel at the time.Throughout the documentary, there are countless archival footage of events such as the discovery of the death camps by the liberating forces, the torment of the survivors as they discover how many of their family members have been decimated, and the long process towards finding a real home of their own in Eretz Israel, which was not smooth sailing, but fraught with obstacles. This documentary would make a great teaching tool for high school and college students, and runs about 2 hours.
