The DVD is up to the standards of the usual Doctor Who offerings, and the included extras were interesting.I confess that I dislike this time in Doctor Who -- I thought Sylvester McCoy had the potential to be a great Doctor... but the writing was, frankly, awful, and the stories didn't make a lot of sense.The extras helped reveal why this was so... they new brood of writers (and script editors) brought on-board by JNT wanted to tell their views on things, and just used the vehicle of Doctor Who to do so.When I first saw the show on PBS many years ago, I did not immediately think it was a satire of the Thatcher government; I just thought it was another disappointing show that didn't make sense.  The Kandy Man!?!  What kind of rubbish monster is this? You squirt lemonade at it, and it can't move?Even the entire premise seems a little flawed... the Doctor tells Ace that he has been hearing reports of the planet not being run well, so he's going to look into it.  How does he hear these kind of things, and aren't there more important matters to &#34;look into&#34;?And then there's the blues harmonica player... what's he in the story for again?  He seems to be just a rebel type that no one can catch.A disappointing, disjointed story...

Parts of the following storyDoctor Who: Silver Nemesis (Story 154)were pretty OTT but at least it had a little oomph to it, what with Nazis, Cybermen and the newly mysterious Doctor.'Happiness Patrol' just grinds on and plays more like a pantomime than a fully realized story.

The main protagonist is this Cruel-la-de-vil rip-off and her henchman is some insane villain made of what appears to be candy (are you kidding me?) The author tries to be clever by placing this roaming harmonica player who acts as a sort of narrator the  (completely bored ) viewer much in the way th DJ was in Revelation of the Daleks. The only difference is the DJ worked and this does not. The whole story is a silly George Orwell type story line that was so PLAYED OUT after 25 years for doctor who on TV (this story was sadly part of what should have been a glorious 25Th anniversary season...but was not). If I ever finish building a time machine I am taking a copy of this back to the BBC in 1985 to show them how wrong they were to tamper with the show in it's final years. No doubt after viewing this silliness they will instantly hire back Colin Baker (Or keep the GREAT Peter Davison) and keep Eric Saward as script editor.... to avert this nonsense (The Silliness patrol) from ever being made.

The writers were ingenious because instead of blatant stories about racism or class structure that Star Trek was famous for they were just trying to tell a good story and often enough political views and social commentary made its way into the fabric of the story. The Happiness Patrol is one of those more overt and as the then head writer notes it wasn't just about Thatcher who was Prim Minister then, it was also about what was going on in South Africa and raids on townships and the &#34;disappearances&#34; of non conformists. It's an intriguing episode, but if you get it really, seriously watch the documentary first or last, but do watch it because that's what makes this DVD worth the money!Other than that I do admit that this is a great episode featuring Ace, Sophie Aldred. It showcases her acting talents nicely and seems to me more about her than the Doctor here. Also, as it's been said the Kandy Man... that's K A N D Y not Candy Man is probably one of the best monsters DW ever had had. And it really is much too bad he isn't in the show a lot more and you really don't get to see how he is defeated (they kind of skip that part) and just show him done in rather than exactly what happens between him running through the tunnels and turning out at the end of the shoot. The style and costumes and painting the TARDIS pink is a nice touch. I know many had said or think that the last season of the McCoy era is the best and darker but frankly I thought it was pretty boring. The Curse of Fenric is a big bore and not worth the $100.00 price tag currently on Amazon by 3rd party sellers. $16.00 for The Happiness Patrol is perfect, it should never go above that.My personal feeling is that the BEST Sylvester McCoy stories were mainly at his beginning: Time and the Rani, Paradise Towers, Delta and the Bannermen, Dragonfire and Remembrence of the Daleks to me were the top of the crop. Of course The Brig shows up in Battlefield and I have yet to watch that one again... stay tuned.",5,What makes The Happiness Patrol 'Special' are the Features!!!!,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,2607,"['Happiness', 'Patrol', 'OK', 'serial', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'classic', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'years', 'years', 'becauseof', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'am', 'making', 'up', 'lost', 'time', 'collecting', 'fav', 'episodes', 'also', 'renting', 'local', 'library', 'system', 'see', 'memory', 'jives', 'story', 'Everyone', 'think', 'Happiness', 'Patrol', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'stories', 'having', 'just', 'watched', 'last', 'nightit', 'not', 'story', 'getting', 'DVD', 'Extras', 'particular', 'documentary', 'how', 'political', 'anti-establishment', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'really', 'been', 'time', 'writers', 'were', 'ingenious', 'instead', 'blatant', 'stories', 'racism', 'class', 'structure', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'famous', 'were', 'just', 'trying', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'often', 'enough', 'political', 'views', 'social', 'commentary', 'made', 'way', 'fabric', 'story', 'Happiness', 'Patrol', 'one', 'more', 'overt', 'then', 'head', 'writer', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'Thatcher', 'who', 'was', 'Prim', 'Minister', 'then', 'was', 'also', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'South', 'Africa', 'raids', 'townships', '34', 'disappearances', '34', 'non', 'conformists', 'intriguing', 'episode', 'get', 'really', 'seriously', 'watch', 'documentary', 'first', 'last', 'do', 'watch', 'what', 'DVD', 'money', 'Other', 'do', 'admit', 'great', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Ace', 'Sophie', 'Aldred', 'acting', 'talents', 'nicely', 'more', 'Doctor', 'here', 'Also', 'been', 'said', 'Kandy', 'Man', 'K', 'A', 'N', 'D', 'Y', 'not', 'Candy', 'Man', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'monsters', 'DW', 'ever', 'had', 'had', 'really', 'much', 'too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'show', 'lot', 'more', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'how', 'defeated', 'kind', 'skip', 'part', 'just', 'show', 'done', 'rather', 'exactly', 'what', 'running', 'tunnels', 'turning', 'out', 'end', 'shoot', 'style', 'costumes', 'painting', 'TARDIS', 'pink', 'nice', 'touch', 'know', 'many', 'had', 'said', 'think', 'last', 'season', 'McCoy', 'era', 'best', 'darker', 'frankly', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'boring', 'Curse', 'Fenric', 'big', 'bore', 'not', '100.00', 'price', 'tag', 'currently', 'Amazon', '3rd', 'party', 'sellers', '16.00', 'Happiness', 'Patrol', 'perfect', 'should', 'never', 'go', 'that.My', 'personal', 'feeling', 'BEST', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'stories', 'were', 'mainly', 'beginning', 'Time', 'Rani', 'Paradise', 'Towers', 'Delta', 'Bannermen', 'Dragonfire', 'Remembrence', 'Daleks', 'were', 'top', 'crop', 'course', 'Brig', 'up', 'Battlefield', 'have', 'yet', 'watch', 'one', 'again', 'stay', 'tuned']",Doctor Who: The Happiness Patrol
1528875,A2BKL7UWZ2MI64,B007AAF1FW,Fuzzy Tomato,"[0, 0]","This specific Doctor Who story was produced at a very difficult time for the show. The years in between the 1985 hiatus in the sixth doctor era to the cancellation of the show at the end of 1989.After a mediocre 1st season for the seventh doctor, and the enirety of the sixth doctor era (although he is very underrated), the show started to find its path again in season 25. Remembrance of the Daleks, the premiere episode, was probably better than anything we had seen in 2 seasons. Silver Nemesis, the third story of the season, wasn't very good though. But it was better than anything in season 24. The final story, the Greatest Show in the Galaxy, was a pretty excellent story. And then there was The Happiness Patrol. And let me just say... it is the (second) most underrated serial in the history of the show!The story has a dark, eerie feel to it. The plot itself is dark. If you aren't happy, you get killed quickly by the happiness patrol. Or get mauled by the leader of the happiness patrol, Helen A's, pet Fifi. Or, of course, there is the Kandy Kitchen where Helen A's psychotic henchman deals with you - The Kandy Man.Many people hate the Kandy Man. And not just ""oh, i don't like that villian"" or ""man, that villian is kind of stupid"", I mean ""$@!/, that was the worst thing to ever happen to Doctor Who!"" And i just don't get it. I LOVE the Kandyman. So why all the hate for him? And why all the hate for this brilliant story?Anyway, here's the list of the special features:1.

1528876,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B007AAF1FW,Happy Reader,"[10, 16]","How can you go wrong when the bad guy is a robot made of different kinds of candy?Well, Kandy Man is not the only bad guy on the planet Terra Alpha. He is only the executioner for the real power, Helen A., who rules with an iron fist. And a smile. Her first rule is that it is against the law to be unhappy. And if you are labeled a Killjoy, her secret police, the Happiness Patrol, will either kill you or haul to off to the Waiting Zone. There, you will either A.) undergo enough conditioning so you regain your natural state of happiness, or B.) be recruited to the Happiness Patrol, where killing people will restore you to your happiness, or C.) be taken to the Kandy Kitchen, where meeting Kandy Man will be the last thing you do.There're other subplots, but for me the subplots are footnotes to the Doctor's dealings with Kandy Man, and the clever way he stops the sweet robot in his tracks.This episode first aired in 1988. Helen A. was supposed to be a thinly disguised caricature of Margaret Thatcher. In 2010, Sylvester McCoy (Doctor Who) told the Sunday Times: ""Our feeling was that Margaret Thatcher was far more terrifying than any monster the Doctor had encountered.""  When the Doctor urges the workers of Terra Alpha to revolt against Helen A., it is intended as a reference to England's 1984-1985 miners' strike and the Iron Lady's repressive response.There is a very brief gay rights reference that can be easily missed. Early on, we see Kandy Man execute a man in a suit, and the man is wearing a pink triangle.From what I've read, most of Graeme Curry's original script's social commentary was toned down in production. I love the comedy and the seriousness of this episode.This review is of the 2012 DVD release, the first time ""The Happiness Patrol"" has been released on DVD. BBC has released the extras to be included in this DVD release. .1.  Audio Commentary. Toby Hadoke moderates, with commentary by Sophie Aldred (who plays Ace), writer Graeme Curry, script editor Andrew Cartmel, composer Dominic Glynn and director Chris Clough. Some of the commentary is about the script, and it's political points. Clough mostly talks about his extreme budget constraints, including how Ace and the Doctor had to make sloooooow getaways, because they couldn't afford vehicles with any umph!2.  Happiness Will Prevail (23 min), a making of documentary. Includes commentary by Andrew Cartmel (script editor), John Pope (who played the Kandyman, a very uncomfortable costume), Sophie Aldred (Ace) and Sylvester McCoy (the Doctor).(Added after my DVD was received and watched:) I thought this documentary was excellent. For one thing, they try to answer the unanswerable question of WHY did the Doctor hang from his umbrella over the ice abyss?  The subtle sub-themes are talked about, it goes deeper than Margaret Thatcher. Sophie Aldred talks about how she got the job, and lots more.3.  When Worlds Collide (46 min) documentary. Presented by Shaun Ley, broadcaster, this takes a look at the times when Doctor Who scripts took on politics in the real world, in varying degrees. Many people contribute to this short, including people not involved with this episode, such as Terence Dicks. I have a feeling this documentary is going to be too short for me!(Added after my DVD was received and watched:)  As I suspected, I really really enjoyed this documentary. They talk about the personalities of each Doctor incarnation, and how such personalities were reflected in any ""message"" in any particular serial. And there's the fact that they had to be careful about having TOO much message, and losing viewers. Or, more likely, getting lots of letters.4.  Deleted and Extended Scenes (23 min)(Added after my DVD was received and watched:) I think this is the very first Dr. Who Deleted Scenes that actually kept my interest!5.

What the Doctor doesn't know is the leader a woman known as Helen A has institued a no saddness policy within the colony.  Anyone not smiling or even being happy is sentenced to death.  With her all female sqauds known as the ""Happiness Patrols"" they enforce her rules on the colony.  However force of arms is not the only thing at her disposal she also has her candy kitchen and within is the being called ""The Candy Man"" a being who loves to make sweets. Sweets that kill that is and of course when all else fails Helen A has her faithful pet Fifi a creature that only Helen A could love.Meanwhile on the planet itself the Doctor encounters Trevor Sigma a Terrian census taker is on the colony to see the numbers of those on the planet are kept up and also to ensure that proceduers are kept up to regulation.  A visting medical student who enjoys the harmonica and is trapped on Terra Alpha until he can find a way to escape and get back to Earth.  Ace also meets a young happiness patrol memebr who wants nothing more then to be sad, but fears what would happen if the rest of her sqaud ever finds out the truth.  Also strange beings seem to be watching from the shadows and seem to be waiting for something to happen.Can the Doctor stop Helen A, her spies, the happiness patrols, The Candy Man and even Fifi and try to sort out the colony so no one has to keep smiling forever?  Or will those that are on Terra Alpha live in the grip of fear if they show anything but happiness?

1528880,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B007AAF1FW,Little Roy Blue,"[14, 15]","""The Happiness Patrol"" comes from an unpopular and often-neglected era of Doctor Who -- the end of the original series, when ratings were poor and internal BBC support for the show was practically nonexistent. But in spite of all that, this is a pretty cool serial that deserves a charitable reassessment.The basic premise is that the Doctor and his companion Ace arrive on a planet where sadness has been banned, and is punishable by death. The planet is ruled by the insane dictator Helen A, who is an obvious parody of Margaret Thatcher. (Amusingly, British journalists didn't notice the Thatcher parallel until 2010, when ""The Happiness Patrol"" was exhumed and re-examined by the media, and became briefly controversial.) Helen A's chief henchman is a robot, made of candy, who kills dissidents by drowning them in syrup.Does all this sound a bit grotesque, perhaps even ridiculous? Well, it is ridiculous, of course. But for those who agree with the left-wing politics of this serial, and can enjoy its peculiar brand of dark humor, there is much to appreciate here. Indeed, I quite like the gutsy social commentary in the script, and I think it's still very relevant. Meanwhile, some of the serial's perceived weaknesses -- false-looking sets, over-the-top acting, and a general campy atmosphere -- become more acceptable, and perhaps even appropriate, when you view them through the lens of political satire.As for the DVD itself, it's one of the best single-disc Doctor Who editions to come along in a while. It includes a making-of special that intelligently examines the serial's politics and production strengths/weaknesses, as well as an extensive collection of extended and deleted scenes (the highlight of which is a much better introduction scene for the character Susan Q). The DVD also includes a fairly long featurette on the politics of Doctor Who, which covers the show's entire decades-long history, touching upon all of the obviously political stories. This is a really interesting, substantive special feature of the sort that I particularly enjoy, since it goes beyond surface analysis of stuff like sets and special effects in order to unpack what Doctor Who is actually about. Good times.So, in the end, I recommend both this serial and the DVD. This isn't exactly classic Doctor Who -- other serials have better writing and better production -- but still, this is an intelligent and underrated story, not a goofy camp-fest that deserves to be written off. The Kandyman alone makes this worth watching again; his costume is so demented that it must be seen to be disbelieved.",4,"Cool serial, nice DVD package",1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,2601,"['Happiness', 'Patrol', 'unpopular', 'often-neglected', 'era', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'end', 'original', 'series', 'when', 'ratings', 'were', 'poor', 'internal', 'BBC', 'support', 'show', 'was', 'practically', 'nonexistent', 'spite', 'pretty', 'cool', 'serial', 'charitable', 'reassessment.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'Doctor', 'companion', 'Ace', 'arrive', 'planet', 'where', 'sadness', 'been', 'banned', 'punishable', 'death', 'planet', 'ruled', 'insane', 'dictator', 'Helen', 'A', 'who', 'obvious', 'parody', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'Amusingly', 'British', 'journalists', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Thatcher', 'parallel', '2010', 'when', 'Happiness', 'Patrol', 'was', 'exhumed', 're-examined', 'media', 'became', 'briefly', 'controversial', 'A', 'chief', 'henchman', 'robot', 'made', 'candy', 'who', 'dissidents', 'drowning', 'syrup.Does', 'sound', 'bit', 'grotesque', 'perhaps', 'even', 'ridiculous', 'Well', 'ridiculous', 'course', 'who', 'agree', 'left-wing', 'politics', 'serial', 'can', 'enjoy', 'peculiar', 'brand', 'dark', 'humor', 'much', 'appreciate', 'here', 'Indeed', 'quite', 'gutsy', 'social', 'commentary', 'script', 'think', 'still', 'very', 'relevant', 'Meanwhile', 'serial', 'perceived', 'weaknesses', 'false-looking', 'sets', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'general', 'campy', 'atmosphere', 'become', 'more', 'acceptable', 'perhaps', 'even', 'appropriate', 'when', 'view', 'lens', 'political', 'satire.As', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'single-disc', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'come', 'along', 'while', 'making-of', 'special', 'intelligently', 'serial', 'politics', 'production', 'strengths/weaknesses', 'as', 'well', 'extensive', 'collection', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'highlight', 'much', 'better', 'introduction', 'scene', 'character', 'Susan', 'Q', 'DVD', 'also', 'fairly', 'long', 'featurette', 'politics', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'show', 'entire', 'decades-long', 'history', 'touching', 'obviously', 'political', 'stories', 'really', 'interesting', 'substantive', 'special', 'feature', 'sort', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'surface', 'analysis', 'stuff', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'order', 'unpack', 'what', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'actually', 'about', 'Good', 'times.So', 'end', 'recommend', 'serial', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'classic', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'other', 'serials', 'have', 'better', 'writing', 'better', 'production', 'still', 'intelligent', 'underrated', 'story', 'not', 'goofy', 'camp-fest', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'Kandyman', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'costume', 'so', 'demented', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'disbelieved']",Doctor Who: The Happiness Patrol

Mr. Curry seems determined to come across as a fair and balanced critic, who (pun intended) does not care what other people think BECAUSE if one is fair and balanced, critics of your criticism must be misguided.Rather than a review of ""The Happiness Patrol"", what we have here is an attack on Liberal perspectives on unregulated Capitalism greed; a denunciation of the author's and producer's perspectives on what they see as a potential future if uncontrolled Capitalism reaches its ultimate end---a society wherein people are forced to be happy, no matter what their circumstances----or else. Certainly ""Orwellian"" in form, but not necessarily Socialist; rather REALIST.Stepping away from a harsh judgment on political ideology and reviewing ""The Happiness Patrol"" itself: Is it the WORST (or second worst) Doctor Who ever? Well, since individual tastes vary widely, some people might consider it so. It is certainly not one of the best. However, it IS generally well acted. Sophie Aldred always charms and Sylvester McCoy (here's that darned old opinion again) was a consistantly better Doctor than, say, Peter Davison (ducks quickly). The story was interesting enough to watch, but perhaps not one to PURCHASE to watch time and again. I would rank it in the bottom ranks of the Who catalog, but, not being vituperative to the point of excess, I would not give it ONE star.Any Doctor Who is better than a ONE star ranking. Simply the fun of it should rank a TWO, even if the story is not the best. I would give ""The Happiness Patrol"" a 2.81 if I could, but I can't.
