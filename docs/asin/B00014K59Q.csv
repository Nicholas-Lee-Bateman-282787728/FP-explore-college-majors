But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.""-from Luke10:41,42Most of us had probably already made up our minds about Martha Stewart long before the sentence came in for her trial earlier this year.  Even though you may not actively pay attention to celeb gossip, it's hard to avoid hearing the little stories about her personal life and forming an image in our heads of a strong, smart and ruthless woman who is at odds with her own gently spoken tv persona. I don't know how accurate this movie was in terms of the real-life facts about Martha, but if it comes close to the truth then most of the negative image is reinforced, but with underlying sympathy for Martha rather than condemnation.Martha, Inc. is a portrait of a woman who is driven to succeed at any cost.  She has plenty of personal demons in her past to drive her:  loathing for her own poor New Jersey family, neighborhood and upbringing, a critical and perfectionistic father whom she spent a lifetime trying to impress,  a belief that money was her salvation and the answer to everything.  This is somebody who derives her sense of self-worth from her bank account if this film is to be believed.  We see her sacrifice every personal relationship in her life for this idol; friends, husband, family.  In the end all she has is her adoring public who is in love with a false image of Martha that she has so carefully cultivated over her years in the spotlight.  A sad, cautionary tale for those of us who might lose sight of the truly important things in life.The film does not delve far into the actual details of her indictment and/or trial, in fact it doesn't really seem to comment on whether or not she was in fact guilty of the formal charges.  Instead, the story seems to judge her for wrong choices in her personal life.  It's a moral that hits you in the face; people are more important than things.  Make time for those you love, for there but for the grace of God go we all.I did enjoy learning about Martha's backstory more than I expected, and Cybil Shepherd's impersonation/portrayal was a dead ringer for Martha's mannerisms.  This film had its comedic moments, although the overall tone was serious for the most part.  I can recommend Martha, Inc. as a fascinating look into the motivations of a relentless soul more than as the comedy that the editorial summary would suggest it to be.And finally, dear Martha, would you now choose the better part?-Andrea, aka Merribelle.",4,The rise & fall of a true American idol.,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,2615,"['Jesus', 'answered', 'said', 'Martha', 'Martha', 'are', 'worried', 'troubled', 'about', 'many', 'things', 'one', 'thing', 'needed', 'Mary', 'chosen', 'good', 'part', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'Luke10:41,42Most', 'had', 'probably', 'already', 'made', 'up', 'minds', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'long', 'sentence', 'came', 'trial', 'earlier', 'year', 'Even', 'may', 'not', 'actively', 'pay', 'attention', 'celeb', 'gossip', 'hard', 'avoid', 'hearing', 'little', 'stories', 'personal', 'life', 'forming', 'image', 'heads', 'strong', 'smart', 'ruthless', 'woman', 'who', 'odds', 'own', 'gently', 'spoken', 'tv', 'persona', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'accurate', 'movie', 'was', 'terms', 'real-life', 'facts', 'Martha', 'close', 'truth', 'then', 'most', 'negative', 'image', 'reinforced', 'underlying', 'sympathy', 'Martha', 'rather', 'condemnation.Martha', 'Inc.', 'portrait', 'woman', 'who', 'driven', 'succeed', 'cost', 'plenty', 'personal', 'demons', 'past', 'drive', 'loathing', 'own', 'poor', 'New', 'Jersey', 'family', 'neighborhood', 'upbringing', 'critical', 'perfectionistic', 'father', 'whom', 'spent', 'lifetime', 'trying', 'impress', 'belief', 'money', 'was', 'salvation', 'answer', 'everything', 'somebody', 'who', 'sense', 'self-worth', 'bank', 'account', 'film', 'be', 'believed', 'see', 'sacrifice', 'personal', 'relationship', 'life', 'idol', 'friends', 'husband', 'family', 'end', 'adoring', 'public', 'who', 'love', 'false', 'image', 'Martha', 'so', 'carefully', 'cultivated', 'years', 'spotlight', 'sad', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'who', 'might', 'lose', 'sight', 'truly', 'important', 'things', 'life.The', 'film', 'not', 'delve', 'far', 'actual', 'details', 'indictment', 'and/or', 'trial', 'fact', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'comment', 'not', 'was', 'fact', 'guilty', 'formal', 'charges', 'Instead', 'story', 'judge', 'wrong', 'choices', 'personal', 'life', 'moral', 'face', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'Make', 'time', 'love', 'grace', 'God', 'go', 'all.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'learning', 'Martha', 'backstory', 'more', 'expected', 'Cybil', 'Shepherd', 'impersonation/portrayal', 'was', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Martha', 'mannerisms', 'film', 'had', 'comedic', 'moments', 'overall', 'tone', 'was', 'serious', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'recommend', 'Martha', 'Inc.', 'fascinating', 'look', 'motivations', 'relentless', 'soul', 'more', 'comedy', 'editorial', 'summary', 'would', 'suggest', 'be.And', 'finally', 'dear', 'Martha', 'would', 'now', 'choose', 'better', 'part', '-Andrea', 'aka', 'Merribelle']",N/A

792917,AZMY6E8B52L2T,B00014K59Q,"JP ""J.P.""","[2, 2]","Long ago this film first aired on NBC as a made for TV movie.  I had wanted to watch it again and finding it on DVD was a delightful surprise.  At the time, you could love Martha Stewart, you could hate her, but she could not be ignored.  As an unauthorized biographical look at the rise of the Martha Stewart Empire, this movie captures what one would envision as the bumps, bruises and successes of a women determined to make a name for herself and play with the big boys.Cybil Shepard, in my opinion, did an excellent job portraying Martha Stewart and bringing her character to life.  We all have unflattering parts of our lives we would prefer not be paraded in-front of the public but as a powerful name face, Martha Stewart drew criticism for how she treated staff, friends and family in real life.  Guilty, Innocent?  To me I never cared nor thought much of it, with this film you should use your own judgement of what is fact and what is not.  However, if you have ever wondered what the perils can be for taking your life style and brand public, this film will give you great insight.This film leaves off where the courts and real life continued on.  We do not see the SEC trial of Martha Stewart, just her divorce from Andy Stewart.  As a movie created and released prior to conviction and her prison stay, this movie leaves the judgement up to the audience of Martha Stewart's guilt, or innocence.",5,An Interesting Insight...,1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,1408,"['Long', 'ago', 'film', 'first', 'aired', 'NBC', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'had', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'finding', 'DVD', 'was', 'delightful', 'surprise', 'time', 'could', 'love', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'could', 'hate', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'unauthorized', 'biographical', 'look', 'rise', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'Empire', 'movie', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'envision', 'bumps', 'bruises', 'successes', 'women', 'determined', 'make', 'name', 'herself', 'play', 'big', 'boys.Cybil', 'Shepard', 'opinion', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'bringing', 'character', 'life', 'have', 'unflattering', 'parts', 'lives', 'would', 'prefer', 'not', 'be', 'paraded', 'in-front', 'public', 'powerful', 'name', 'face', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'drew', 'criticism', 'how', 'treated', 'staff', 'friends', 'family', 'real', 'life', 'Guilty', 'Innocent', 'never', 'cared', 'thought', 'much', 'film', 'should', 'use', 'own', 'judgement', 'what', 'fact', 'what', 'not', 'However', 'have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'perils', 'can', 'be', 'taking', 'life', 'style', 'brand', 'public', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'great', 'insight.This', 'film', 'where', 'courts', 'real', 'life', 'continued', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'SEC', 'trial', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'just', 'divorce', 'Andy', 'Stewart', 'movie', 'created', 'released', 'prior', 'conviction', 'prison', 'stay', 'movie', 'judgement', 'up', 'audience', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'guilt', 'innocence']",N/A

It covers the sides of Martha Stewart that you don't see in her TV shows but occasionally read about on the covers of those check out lines sensations.  Both bad and good characteristics are covered as are the tactics used to sell the Martha lifestyle to the public.  It also covers some of  the controversy surrounding her conviction for insider trading.  Cybil Shepherd does a good job in the part but assuming this is a true perspective of Martha's character one must assume that she will do what is necessary to further her image at the expense of her friends and co-workers and undoubtedly even her public following.  You have to admire her ambition and dedication to her goals while questioning the personal costs and ethics.,4,A legend Revealed,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,811,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'end', 'up', 'love-hate', 'feelings', 'Martha', 'sides', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'TV', 'shows', 'occasionally', 'read', 'covers', 'check', 'out', 'lines', 'sensations', 'bad', 'good', 'characteristics', 'are', 'covered', 'are', 'tactics', 'used', 'sell', 'Martha', 'lifestyle', 'public', 'also', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'conviction', 'insider', 'trading', 'Cybil', 'Shepherd', 'good', 'job', 'part', 'assuming', 'true', 'perspective', 'Martha', 'character', 'one', 'must', 'assume', 'will', 'do', 'what', 'necessary', 'further', 'image', 'expense', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'undoubtedly', 'even', 'public', 'following', 'have', 'admire', 'ambition', 'dedication', 'goals', 'questioning', 'personal', 'costs', 'ethics']",N/A
