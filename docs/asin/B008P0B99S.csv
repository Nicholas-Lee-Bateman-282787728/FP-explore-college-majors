I honestly don't have anything bad or negative to say about the film. Not a single joke falls flat, the kills, while not all incredibly gory, were great. Definitely a great movie to to have a few beers and pizza with. It doesnt take itself seriously at all and the pacing is super fantastic.One thing that I've noticed that plagues low budget horror are lighting and sound. Especially sound. I've always had to lower the volume or turn it all the way up. I'm very happy to report that NEITHER of these issues plague BBBC. If you can find the set that has the vhs as well, get it. The vhs is one of the nicest collectible tapes to come out in awhile (yes, better than the Mondo vhs releases of Things, Sledgehammer, and Burning Moon).In closing, if you're looking for a damn fun slasher film, that doesn't take itself seriously, and doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to be funny...I couldn't recommend this film highly enough.PS.

As a Christian myself, I had a hard time with some of the sacrilegious elements in this movie, but I do have an open mind. So I was able to push my beliefs aside and enjoy the slasher and comedy elements that this movie had in store. This is a fast-paced and fun ride that delivers everything a good slasher needs to. And in many parts of the film, it had a real Friday the 13th feel to it. The setting, the murders, and even some of the music really paid good homage to the Friday the 13th series. And this thing is full of gore. There are several murders in the first ten minutes alone! And there is also nudity.

1573316,A70LW1392FFA,B008P0B99S,JamesA,"[1, 4]","This movie isn't bad. I actually liked it. But Bloody Bloody Bible Camp is in no way an homage to 80's slashers. Let me explain my reasons. First, the opening scenes seem to last for over half an hour. And to go along with the title of my review this seemed like a parody movie instead of an homage. The acting is very over the top so much so that it seemed they were spoofing the 80's slasher rather than trying to be like one. If this is what the filmakers were going for then they did an excellent job of it. An example of a movie that was a great homage to 80's slashers was Return To Sleepaway Camp.

1573317,A3G1ATNDU80KAE,B008P0B99S,"J. Autrey ""jimmyplm""","[4, 10]","Generally I like the horror movies that Tim Sullivan makes. They are usually campy with some decent gore thrown in. I also admire him for taking chances with his movies and doing things that other filmmakers are afraid to do. However, ""Bloody Bloody Bible Camp"" was a big disappointment. I regret buying this one and will pass it on to someone else rather than keeping it in my collection. This doesn't even rank as the kind of movie that would be fun to watch ironically with friends. It's just plain terrible all around.The movie reminds me of the ""Sleepaway Camp"" sequels (but is nowhere near as good or fun as those movies). The acting reminded me of the old movie ""Psycho Cop"", and that's not a compliment at all. The characters are all annoying without exception, so I couldn't have cared less if they all got killed off. The movie was meant to be funny, but there were only a handful of things in the whole movie that made me laugh (the holy water joke and some of Tad's monologues). The movie seemed to drag on for way too long and didn't have a satisfactory ending. The only murder sequence that impressed me at all was the kind-of-cool cinder block kill.One thing that could have been great was the concept. I think that this movie could have been great with a better script and more capable cast. The slasher in the movie (Sister Mary Copper) was actually quite fun in her scenes. Her mask, costume, and weapon were all great. Tim Sullivan played the villain well enough and managed to be the highlight of the movie. Perhaps this movie would have been better off ditching the lame potty humor and doing a more serious tone. This movie might have been a serious critique of biblethumper culture, but instead it just seems offensive with no real message. The campers (many of which look like they are in their late 30s/early 40s, but are trying to act like teenagers) don't act like any of the rightwing folks I've met. I think the movie could have just as easily been ""Bloody Bloody Regular Camp"" in that aspect. It seemed like a complete missed opportunity to create a horror movie with a thought-provoking message. Don't get me wrong. I love a good horror comedy from time to time, but this one just didn't work as a comedy or as a horror flick.My advice is to skip this one altogether or at least rent it before you buy it.

It is a blast to watch and found myself seriously laughing out loud 3 times, which is rare.BUT i am an 80's kid, so i found issues that bugged me with styling a movie placed in 1977 and 1984.  The makers of the movie did a fine job and for most they may never notice the things i did, but i have this weird thing in me that goes looking for ""lack of 80's-ness"" and that is what dropped 1 star off my vote.First, the 1977 part looked great except one dude had to keep his ""Justin Bieber / Shane Dawson Hair"" - sorry, if it were fashioned more like the Monkeys maybe... Now to 1984... They admitted in the commentary about having trouble with background cars in the parking lot across the street at the General Market.  Other things though included Giant brightly colored energy drink cans in the cooler, the cash register being modern and although they did ok with the purchases of the chubby kid, you really couldn't buy Jester Hats in local gas stations back then - a likely substitute that ""could"" be at any gas station was the Steve Martin ""Arrow-Thru-the Head"", but overall that is passable.  What really wasn't was:  Although they did a good job with fashion of the period, one character didn't and that was Brittany.  I can see some reason for ""why"" as she is the main sex object of the film, but even though she went ""retro"" almost none of her clothes existed back in 1984.  All of her outfits even though done with a retro style were modern low-cut boy shorts and ultra minis right down to her barrettes, being kinda heart shaped colored metal, which you had 2 choices in 1984 straight colored metal or colored solid plastic with animals.  One thing with promiscuous girls fashion then or even fashion in general were Tube-tops - they were everywhere and it was that thing where you didn't wear a bra with them - oh she wore a bra... from Victoria's Secret most likely and no 80's panties.  So yeah, she dressed modern day retro, most likely to keep the level of sex appeal to modern day boys watching this movie. So, 1 star subtracted for promising 80's and not fully delivering.The movie though was a blast.  I really enjoyed the acting and the casting seemed spot-on.  The characters were fun stereo-types and the comedy was pretty solid.  The kills and gore were just as good.  The movie took a slight pause for me at the 1 hour mark, but picked right back up and never got too dull.  It was a very enjoyable fun ride all the way and is highly recommended even if you can't overlook the period flaws.  The bonus materials were also good with an excellent commentary track.",4,coulda been 5 stars,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,2631,"['will', 'begin', 'saying', 'YES', 'i', 'love', 'movie', 'blast', 'watch', 'found', 'seriously', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', '3', 'times', 'rare.BUT', 'i', 'am', '80', 'kid', 'i', 'found', 'issues', 'bugged', 'styling', 'movie', 'placed', '1977', '1984', 'makers', 'movie', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'most', 'may', 'never', 'notice', 'things', 'i', 'did', 'i', 'have', 'weird', 'thing', 'looking', 'lack', ""80's-ness"", 'what', 'dropped', '1', 'star', 'vote.First', '1977', 'part', 'looked', 'great', 'one', 'dude', 'had', 'keep', 'Justin', 'Bieber', '/', 'Shane', 'Dawson', 'Hair', 'sorry', 'were', 'fashioned', 'more', 'Monkeys', 'maybe', 'Now', '1984', 'admitted', 'commentary', 'having', 'trouble', 'background', 'cars', 'parking', 'lot', 'street', 'General', 'Market', 'Other', 'things', 'included', 'Giant', 'brightly', 'colored', 'energy', 'drink', 'cans', 'cooler', 'cash', 'register', 'being', 'modern', 'did', 'ok', 'purchases', 'chubby', 'kid', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Jester', 'Hats', 'local', 'gas', 'stations', 'back', 'then', 'likely', 'substitute', 'could', 'be', 'gas', 'station', 'was', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Arrow-Thru-the', 'Head', 'overall', 'passable', 'What', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'fashion', 'period', 'one', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'Brittany', 'can', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'main', 'sex', 'object', 'film', 'even', 'went', 'retro', 'almost', 'none', 'clothes', 'existed', 'back', '1984', 'outfits', 'even', 'done', 'retro', 'style', 'were', 'modern', 'low-cut', 'boy', 'shorts', 'ultra', 'minis', 'right', 'down', 'barrettes', 'being', 'kinda', 'heart', 'shaped', 'colored', 'metal', 'had', '2', 'choices', '1984', 'straight', 'colored', 'metal', 'colored', 'solid', 'plastic', 'animals', 'One', 'thing', 'promiscuous', 'girls', 'fashion', 'then', 'even', 'fashion', 'general', 'were', 'Tube-tops', 'were', 'everywhere', 'was', 'thing', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'wear', 'bra', 'oh', 'wore', 'bra', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'most', 'likely', '80', 'panties', 'So', 'yeah', 'dressed', 'modern', 'day', 'retro', 'most', 'likely', 'keep', 'level', 'sex', 'appeal', 'modern', 'day', 'watching', 'movie', 'So', '1', 'star', 'subtracted', 'promising', '80', 'not', 'fully', 'delivering.The', 'movie', 'was', 'blast', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'casting', 'seemed', 'spot-on', 'characters', 'were', 'fun', 'stereo-types', 'comedy', 'was', 'pretty', 'solid', 'kills', 'gore', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'took', 'slight', 'pause', '1', 'hour', 'mark', 'picked', 'right', 'back', 'up', 'never', 'got', 'too', 'dull', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'ride', 'way', 'highly', 'recommended', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'period', 'flaws', 'bonus', 'materials', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'track']",N/A
