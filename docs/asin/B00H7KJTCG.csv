However, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a fantasy exploration of the adult psyche grasping to the childhood bewilderment of endless daydreaming. It is a movie about take action and defining yourself.  It is amazing to watch Walter transcend from the life he feels he is expected to live and never living the life he envisions to actually play out those dreams.  I think the directors and actors did the original short story justice and was a pleasure to watch.

1684115,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00H7KJTCG,Anthony L.,"[0, 0]","THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY is the story of a man who escapes his mundane reality through wishful fantasies, who one day steps outside his door to DO something noteworthy, and in the process discover that life is worth living, and worth living *bravely*. It is a warm, rich, beautiful, big-hearted film that brims with earnestness, passion, and a wide-eyed love for cinema. Ben Stiller did something rare to me with Walter Mitty: he made me realize the true potential of the movies to change people again.The cast is led by Ben Stiller, ditching the goofball persona that served him so well in Tropic Thunder and Zoolander, and showing admirable restraint. His Mitty is an everyday-guy who is forced to step outside of his dream world and do something brave, even dangerous, and in the process discovers excitement, friendship, love, and the joy of living. It's a fabulous performance, earnest and full of heart, with Stiller's comedic talents serving him well in fantasy scenes. He's backed up by a charming and smart Kristen Wiig, and a supporting cast filled with talented performers like Sean Penn, a hateable Adam Scott, Shirley McClaine, and Patton Oswalt.But the movie's unique visual style impressed me as well. Stylistic, almost retro, Mitty moves between anonymous offices, the bustling life of the streets, and the vast open lushness of Iceland with equal aplomb. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the colors are rich and vibrant. Stiller's implementation of CGI, especially in the day-dream scenes is admirable, reminiscent of Robert Zemeckis. The score and soundtrack is earnest and rousing, coupling perfectly with the theme of the film. One small gripe I do have is with a few camera angles. Ben Stiller is not a new director, but he's never worked with this budget before, and you can tell in some scenes that he's trying a new angle to show off his expensive set, or putting the camera in this place to get a striking shot, without realizing that it doesn't really add anything to the movie.But in conclusion, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a beautiful, rich, feel-good drama comedy with a great performance from Ben Stiller, gorgeous visuals, and a great message. This is just the kind of film you want to curl up on the couch and watch with your family. 5 Secret Lives out of 5.",5,"Touches the eyes, the head, and the heart!",1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,2307,"['SECRET', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'WALTER', 'MITTY', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'mundane', 'reality', 'wishful', 'fantasies', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'steps', 'door', 'DO', 'something', 'noteworthy', 'process', 'discover', 'life', 'worth', 'living', 'worth', 'living', '*bravely*', 'warm', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'big-hearted', 'film', 'earnestness', 'passion', 'wide-eyed', 'love', 'cinema', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'did', 'something', 'rare', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'made', 'realize', 'true', 'potential', 'movies', 'change', 'people', 'again.The', 'cast', 'led', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'ditching', 'goofball', 'persona', 'served', 'so', 'well', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'Zoolander', 'showing', 'admirable', 'restraint', 'Mitty', 'everyday-guy', 'who', 'forced', 'step', 'dream', 'world', 'do', 'something', 'brave', 'even', 'dangerous', 'process', 'discovers', 'excitement', 'friendship', 'love', 'joy', 'living', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'earnest', 'full', 'heart', 'Stiller', 'comedic', 'talents', 'serving', 'well', 'fantasy', 'scenes', 'backed', 'up', 'charming', 'smart', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'supporting', 'cast', 'filled', 'talented', 'performers', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'hateable', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'Shirley', 'McClaine', 'Patton', 'Oswalt.But', 'movie', 'unique', 'visual', 'style', 'impressed', 'well', 'Stylistic', 'almost', 'retro', 'Mitty', 'anonymous', 'offices', 'bustling', 'life', 'streets', 'vast', 'open', 'lushness', 'Iceland', 'equal', 'aplomb', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'colors', 'are', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'Stiller', 'implementation', 'CGI', 'especially', 'day-dream', 'scenes', 'admirable', 'reminiscent', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'score', 'soundtrack', 'earnest', 'rousing', 'coupling', 'perfectly', 'theme', 'film', 'One', 'small', 'gripe', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'camera', 'angles', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'not', 'new', 'director', 'never', 'worked', 'budget', 'can', 'tell', 'scenes', 'trying', 'new', 'angle', 'show', 'off', 'expensive', 'set', 'putting', 'camera', 'place', 'get', 'striking', 'shot', 'realizing', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'movie.But', 'conclusion', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'feel-good', 'drama', 'comedy', 'great', 'performance', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'gorgeous', 'visuals', 'great', 'message', 'just', 'kind', 'film', 'want', 'curl', 'up', 'couch', 'watch', 'family', '5', 'Secret', '5']",N/A

Why are there no movies with women having these sort of adventures?  The scenery is fantastic and the locations amazing, but would have been a great film with stronger and more defined lesser characters.  As much as I wanted to really love this movie I can't help but feel as if Ben Stiller cast himself purely out of ego and not for the greater good of the film.

I loved how it was fairy tale, yet realistic, yet finding the balance between the two and not going over the top within either to produce a very entertaining story. The acting was excellent and understated for all the main characters and supporting actors. Yes, that was Shirley MacLain on the screen, but it was really Walter's mother.

1684149,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00H7KJTCG,DanD,"[0, 0]","PREFACE: I haven't seen the original.  I try not to compare remakes to the originals anyways, unless they're by-the-numbers remakes designed solely to make a little cash.  This film comes across as a true labor of love, so I feel I'm justified in giving it an unbiased review.Walter Mitty works in the cellars of LIFE magazine, and his job may be on the line: a trio of bearded wonderboys (headed by snob-for-hire Adam Scott) has come strolling in with the news that the magazine is switching to online-only, and a lot of people are about to be out of their jobs.  Walter, who spends equal parts of his time daydreaming about the person he'd like to be, and fantasizing about the woman of his dreams whom he can barely talk to, is sure to get axed.  Especially when famed photographer Sean O'Connell sends in his latest snaps...with his most cherished picture missing.So Walter takes a leap of faith and pursues O'Connell across the globe, and this is where the film begins to fall apart.  Don't get me wrong: it's incredibly easy to root for Walter.  Writer/director Ben Stiller portrays him perfectly, a nuanced performance that is a bit by-the-numbers, but Stiller has enough charisma (especially with costar Kristen Wiig) that it's hard not to like him.  However, the film is at its strongest when it's portraying Walter as a day-dreaming everyman, an ordinary schmuck who doesn't realize his full potential.  THIS is the heart of the film (and, hence, the title).  When Walter impulsively starts acting out his fantasies, we begin to lose touch.  The film strays away from its point.  Cue the dramatic music and endearing scenes of self-fulfillment.THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY gets one thing right from start to finish: it looks fantastic.  I mean amazing.  The film slips seamlessly from fantasy to reality, a polished cinematic gem burdened mainly by its script.

Favorite movie of the year, hands down.My partner bought the Target edition Blu-ray and, although the packaging is really nice (looks like a book), the included spread of Life magazine covers isn't something that I will enjoy over and over again (I prefer her suggestion, a replica of Sean's wallet).But loving this movie like I do, I decided to dip my toe once again into the world of digital copies.  I had only tried this once before with Rango and been sorely disappointed in the results.  I hate to say that this experience has not endeared me any more to the process.First let me say that I'm no computer newbie.  I know my way around Androids, etc. and can usually figure out almost any problem I encounter.  Having said that, getting my digital copy made me feel exactly the opposite.  Worse, there doesn't seem to be any way to reverse an incorrect decision.For example, choice one is method of delivery.  I chose the Google Play store, but in retrospect wonder if iTunes wouldn't have been more user friendly.  Too late.I then chose an HD quality download, not realizing that it downloads to your device and there is no way to move it over to your SD card where you have three times the storage capacity.  Had I known this, I would have chosen a smaller file to download.  Too late.You also can't use your Android player of choice to watch, only the device's stock player.  And you can't find the file in your file system, it can only be accessed through the Google Movies and TV or Play app (I did actually find it after digging through some Android forums, but it's in an almost unknown format called .wvm that can't be converted to anything more conventional).It's cool that you can download it to multiple devices, since obviously I might not be using my current one forever, but it's still very irritating that the download is ""yours,"" but only so far.  I'm not comfortable with things existing only in ""the cloud"" since I have no control over it if something goes wrong.  Obviously this is an anti-piracy measure, but again we see punishing the law-abiding citizens along with the crooks.If I'm wrong about any of this, please, correct me.

A photographer gets bored with his dull, uneventful life and goes on a vacation to Greenland, inspired by his wild imagination. And that's basically it. The quote on the mountain about the purpose of life is just fancy, pretentious, empty words that bear no deep, thought-provoking or philosophical meaning. Plus the sexual jokes--like the one about the volcanic eruption--added nothing useful to the script and were merely included to appeal to a lazy, unrefined and uneducated audience.

Having never been a big fan of Ben Stiller, I basically decided to see this film because the trailer was good and the other movies available at the time left me cold.  I was stunned at how good this was.  This is really the only role I've ever seen Stiller in where I felt his performance was outstanding.  Unlike the usual goofy roles he ordinarily plays, this one gave him the opportunity to be a real guy--shy and intimidated at first, and then courageous and indomitable as he pursued his goal.  Despite his more realistic portrayal, he is still funny--and actually, perhaps funnier--because his humor is understated and does not undermine his portrayal as an everyday guy rather than a caricature.  He is likable, and before long you find yourself rooting for him.  Kristen Wiig's performance was especially engaging.  We don't really see enough of her in the movie, but she is the driving force behind Stiller's transformation.  Sean Penn is seen even more briefly in the film, but his portrayal of the renowned adventurer/photographer is terrific and believable. In the sea of mediocre films that Hollywood has churned out in the past few years, this is one of the few standouts.

I have felt all of those at some point in my life and have always wanted better.

Despite some moments of action the movie moves at a snails pace, and at times you forget what the movie is even about. I think it is supposed to be about a man who wants more out of life but just does not have it in him to take it, but the movie never fully achieves this and because of that I came away unsatisfied. I think there was too much going on in the plot that distracted from the human story, such as what was on the negative, the adventurous photographer (whose legendary mysteriousness was a letdown once he was revealed in character), the jerk corporate exec guy and what was going on at LIFE, the eHarmony stuff, the woman of interest and her ex drama.

Walter takes action in the real world embarking on a global journey to find the missing picture that is needed for Life Magazine's last printed cover image.

It was adapted into a tasteless vehicle for Danny Kaye in 1949, then into this ho-hum vehicle for Ben Stiller in 2013.  The latest version was trapped in development Hell for twenty years; it was repeatedly re-written for many lead actors until Stiller came along.  We can be thankful for some things; it doesn't go to the vulgar depths of humiliation that Stiller films often do, and it tries hard to be thoughtful.  If it didn't claim to be derived from Thurber's story, it might have earned a better reception.The best that can be said for this film is that it is visually beautiful.  It is based on the theme of photography - specifically photography for Life Magazine - and lives up to that ambition.  The color palette and contrasts are wonderful; if you don't see this in Blu-Ray, you've missed the boat.  But when someone's first comment about a film is: ""It looked beautiful,"" you know that the story was lacking, and it is.Anyone familiar with Thurber's short story knows that it is built around the hero's preposterous fantasies of living a heroic life while suffering a life of pointless tedium.  It is a story that mixes a little pathos with a lot of humor.  Unfortunately, it doesn't provide enough material for a full-length film.  In the Danny Kaye version, the early Thurber-based fantasies are padded out with an inane spy plot.  In the Stiller version, the fantasies are an afterthought that don't flow well with the hero's real-life adventures.  The ""extras"" section of the recording show that most of the fantasy work ended up cut out of the film.  The result is a bittersweet film that echoes Stiller's more ambitious efforts.  Despite the over-the-top nature of those real life adventures, the film retains its drowsy maudlin mood.There is a socio-cultural angle to this film too, an attempt to make an important comment about the phenomenon of ""downsizing"" that pervades America.  We the people have seen this before: a multi-million dollar corporate film taking shots at crass corporate goons ruining our society.  Not surprisingly, the piety leaves a sour aftertaste.  Even if Mitty and his sweetheart end up with each other, what does it matter if they don't have jobs?  Apparently, that's unimportant to Twentieth Century Fox; they've got our movie money.",3,"""Life"" is beautiful, but the story is a big ""meh.""",1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,2398,"['James', 'Thurber', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'one', 'most-loved', 'short', 'stories', 'English', 'language', 'was', 'adapted', 'tasteless', 'vehicle', 'Danny', 'Kaye', '1949', 'then', 'ho-hum', 'vehicle', 'Ben', 'Stiller', '2013', 'latest', 'version', 'was', 'trapped', 'development', 'Hell', 'twenty', 'years', 'was', 'repeatedly', 're-written', 'many', 'lead', 'actors', 'Stiller', 'came', 'along', 'can', 'be', 'thankful', 'things', ""n't"", 'go', 'vulgar', 'depths', 'humiliation', 'Stiller', 'films', 'often', 'do', 'hard', 'be', 'thoughtful', 'did', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'derived', 'Thurber', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'earned', 'better', 'reception.The', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'based', 'theme', 'photography', 'specifically', 'photography', 'Life', 'Magazine', 'up', 'ambition', 'color', 'palette', 'contrasts', 'are', 'wonderful', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Blu-Ray', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'boat', 'when', 'someone', 'first', 'comment', 'film', 'looked', 'beautiful', 'know', 'story', 'was', 'lacking', 'familiar', 'Thurber', 'short', 'story', 'built', 'hero', 'preposterous', 'fantasies', 'living', 'heroic', 'life', 'suffering', 'life', 'pointless', 'tedium', 'story', 'little', 'pathos', 'lot', 'humor', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'provide', 'enough', 'material', 'full-length', 'film', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'version', 'early', 'Thurber-based', 'fantasies', 'are', 'padded', 'out', 'inane', 'spy', 'plot', 'Stiller', 'version', 'fantasies', 'are', 'afterthought', 'do', ""n't"", 'flow', 'well', 'hero', 'real-life', 'adventures', 'extras', 'section', 'recording', 'show', 'most', 'fantasy', 'work', 'ended', 'up', 'cut', 'film', 'result', 'bittersweet', 'film', 'Stiller', 'more', 'ambitious', 'efforts', 'over-the-top', 'nature', 'real', 'life', 'adventures', 'film', 'drowsy', 'maudlin', 'socio-cultural', 'angle', 'film', 'too', 'attempt', 'make', 'important', 'comment', 'phenomenon', 'downsizing', 'America', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'corporate', 'film', 'taking', 'shots', 'crass', 'corporate', 'goons', 'ruining', 'society', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'piety', 'sour', 'aftertaste', 'Even', 'Mitty', 'sweetheart', 'end', 'up', 'other', 'what', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'jobs', 'Apparently', 'unimportant', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'money']",N/A

I think that because of all the wrongfully epic popularity of certain movies out there, people ignore movies like Walter Mitty. Walter Mitty is a movie that will make you see yourself and life through new eyes. It is not just some random ""feel-good"" movie. It is an extremely meaningful movie with several important themes that we as a society have forgotten all about. This movie shows us that there is some beauty in life, there are good things out there and within ourselves, and that it's right there, waiting for you to grab it. Also, that you truly CAN break out of your shell, sometimes by accident, or on purpose, just by taking a leap. I have a hard time finding anything else out there that actually have positive themes and truly meaningful concepts in them these days. So, I really and truly from my heart recommend that you get this movie and watch it. Thank you Ben Stiller, for making this wonderful film.I really thought the cinematography in this was amazing and wonderful.The first 35 minutes of this film are full of humor, slapstick humor, and down-right cheesy humor.

1684291,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00H7KJTCG,StrangePegs,"[2, 4]","This will be very spoilery, by the way, so be aware.I think the movie starts out fantastically. There are all these moments where we shift into Mitty's imagination without realizing it until he snaps back to himself. It meshed well with my vague impression of the short story, and Stiller was great in those scenes. What I really liked, though, is the reaction from the people around Mitty. Especially the stuff from Ted Hendricks (played by the excellent Adam Scott).Unfortunately, the daydreams get more and more fantastic as the movie goes along leading to an epic battle between Mitty and Hendricks through the streets of New York as they fight over a Stretch Armstrong doll. The power of the earlier scenes is that the daydreams are (mostly) normal. They are the kinds of things that anyone would wish they had done instead, things like asking the girl out or telling off your obnoxious boss. So, in the early movie, it's not always clear when he's gone off in his head until he snaps back to reality, and that stuff works really well. The fantastical stuff works less well.Still, even the fantastic stuff, the superhero fights, would have worked well in small doses if the film had stuck to Walter Mitty being this guy that just goes off in his head. However, to make the point of the movie, Mitty eventually moves off into a real life adventure full of fantastic moments. Like, you know, getting attacked by a shark or skateboarding near a volcano while it's erupting. These things made me uneasy with the movie, and, although I was enjoying it, I wasn't fully enjoying it, because it just didn't feel right.Of course, what I kept wondering was whether it was because it wasn't fitting with my perception of the short story.To be clear, I enjoyed the movie well enough. I especially enjoyed the ending moment of the movie. But I was still feeling... unsettled... about the whole thing. Okay, that meant I needed to find a copy of the short story so that I could figure out if that's what was causing the issue. And I did that, and the short story and the movie are not really alike except that the movie takes the concept of the story and turns it into a movie. After all, the short story is only a few pages long and is about a trip into town with Mitty and his wife (Mitty has no wife in the movie. In fact, that is part of the conflict in the movie, Mitty wanting &#34;the girl&#34;). There is no revelation in the short story that life is better lived than imagined.The departure from the source material didn't really bother me. Well, there was some botherment in that the movie changed the point of the story, but, really, that was okay overall. But it was still bothering me. The movie, that is. After a lot of thought, it finally settled in me what it was:The idea of the movie, which is right there on the poster, is that you should live your life, not daydream about it. And, really, I get that. There are those things that we should not just wish we did, you know, like ask out the girl. What's the worst that's going to happen, after all? She'll say no and you won't go out with her which you're already not doing so just ask her out already. However, telling off your boss is not necessarily the best idea in the world. Not if you want to keep your job.Of course, part of the idea of the movie is that you shouldn't want to keep your job. Your job keeps you from the things you are dreaming about, so you should just take off and do those things. It's a message that's impossible for the &#34;normal&#34; person to do. I mean, here's the thing, in the movie, Mitty is this 40ish, single guy with much more money in his bank account than the average person. We do see that he's concerned with money and somewhat compulsive about tracking his money, but, really, he's doing okay and has thousands of dollars available to him, so, when he decides to take off, he's able to just do it. Most of us (I'd guess 99% of us) can't just do that kind of thing. And he's single with no kids. So, like, if I was a real jerk, I could just wipe out my family's finances, abandon my wife and kids, and go live life as the movie suggests. That's what it would take, ruining the lives of the people in my family. And that's where almost all of us are, and, I suppose, that's why the movie falls apart for me: it supposes that any of us can just (ought to, in fact) get up and do the things we've always dreamed about. And, maybe, some of us could. If we're real jerks. Because it would take abandoning our families, jobs, responsibilities to do it. Then, therefore, this idea of just taking off becomes another dream that we can't actually attain.Not to mention that upon quitting your job and taking off, you suddenly become without an income source and, eventually, you're going to be screwed. I'm not thinking it's likely that it's going to be all that easy to get a new job when you just abandoned your previous job.I suppose, in the end, I would have liked the movie more if it was actually about a guy that was constantly losing himself in his daydreams instead of being about a guy that learned to do the things he always daydreamed about. I think there was probably more to be said in the story they didn't tell rather than the one they did, one that is actually told all the time. It would have, at least, been kind of unique.The acting was good, though. Stiller was great. I loved Adam Scott. Kristen Wiig was Kristen Wiig, which is great if you want Kristen Wiig in a role, because no one plays her like she does. Kathryn Hahn was also pretty hilarious. Sean Penn is... well, he's there, which is what he's supposed to be. Patton Oswalt was amusing; that whole story line is interesting and goes along with the idea of the movie which is both good and bad, I suppose.The movie was enjoyable, for sure. It's good. It's just not great. I mean, telling people to live their dreams is all well and good -- I'm for that -- but, if that's going to be your message, I think you ought to tell people how to do that in a realistic way, because taking off for Iceland and all the rest of what follows is hardly something that's going to work out for most people.",4,Secret Lives,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,6164,"['will', 'be', 'very',

1684313,A4YXKE5F62II8,B00H7KJTCG,Visual Bureau,"[6, 18]","&#34;My second time seeing a cinema-released film on Christmas Day since Django Unchained last year. What would you make out of life if you lived in a dream-like, lucid state of mind? Well, Ben Stiller responds to this question with this esoteric, psychedelic or hippie-influenced, and quirky remake of the 1947 film of the same name and film adaptation of James Thurber's magazine story. Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty seems like an earnest choice since his character, remembering from some clips and pre-evaluated knowledge, is not over-the-top, raunchy, or stoned as today's comedic actors would come across.Stiller evokes a sort of Truman Show-esque vibe to this character and his peculiar episodes dealing with his dreams, his love interest, and adventures through Iceland, Greenland, and the Himalayas. Mitty is done in a way, and with some of the film's choice of environment and place, like an 80s or 90s film where there the technology is there but it feels minimalist and too kind to be out-there and a bit too rough and stylised to be considerably respectable to the older generation. Given this element, I found myself laughing little in this film but being intrigued by the cinematography and oddball events that Mitty encounters more than the humour alone. The Iceland and Greenland scenes were well-done and the beginning scene (which is cleverly done comedy by being subtle) but the scenes set in the Himalayas and elsewhere felt a bit stale and overlooked.The plot does feel a bit loose too with scenes going on for quite a few minutes without any kind of intriguing traction or element of suspense and emergency which adds to the good but not always brilliant &#34;hippie/psychedelic&#34; label to this film (not to say, the excellent choice of David Bowie, nature shots, quotes of strength, and other pieces of music in it). It did not help that the film used the same title twice which could be an editing error in the opening credits and I honestly wish there could have been more dream sequences or ending the film like it was a dream as that concept flew over the cuckoo's nest 1/3 into the film. The possibly perceived anti-corporate, anti-TSA/pro-privacy, pro-nature, pro-culture message might be off-putting to some but it was done within the confines of exploring out of your surroundings and feeling life for what it is almost like a travel guide on Globe Trekker or a crazy episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations but without the food or all-out vulgarity.One thing that intrigued me more (not just how much product placement there was which was something that didn't bother me really but it was funnily done) was the PG rating (which is more appropriately granted here than a PG-13) for this film given it has no kid appeal and features language (ass, hell, damn) and adult humour (a heroin and genitalia joke) which might scratch parents' heads more for a PG than if it was another animated work from Disney or DreamWorks. Aside from that, I probably might have missed this film if it was not for the PG curioso element to a film that looks like it would be another commercial PG-13 film aimed at adults these days. As a film, it works to be a modern-day homage and it does its job and does not squirm on over-the-top elements here which add to the film's dryly comic yet ultimately dramatic presentation.It also works by allowing you feel like in a place other than somewhere else which is ultimately what Christopher Nolan's Inception did three years ago but considering how overrated and confusing I though of it, Walter Mitty (the two versions included, 1947 and 2013) was better done with the lucid concept. I watched this film during Christmas day knowing of a family relative's respect and admiration for the original and being from the new generation, I gave this title a chance and I was not disappointed as much as some of the critics have said. It was far from perfect but it was nicely done and the Iceland/Greenland scenes were worth the admission at least and the PG curiosity to it.&#34;",3,"For today's filmgoers, this is Inception but without the confusing action but it was worth the admission.

But I wouldn't expect any less from Ben Stiller.  His entire oeuvre pretty much can be summed up in that sentiment.  Heck, if he asks I'll let him use it on his tombstone.But it's not all him.  Well, other than the fact that he picked this movie to make and this role to charm us with.Some tales are timeless, but not all-surely not Walter Mitty's.  I'm sure it captivated millions back in the 1920s or whenever Thurber cranked it out.  Jonathan Seagull captivated the hippies in the 70s and Bridget Jones life was the end all and be all of the 90's.  But these are just passing fancies.  Sure, the author put the story to paper and some classified these tales as literature.  But time will tell.  And this movie sure tells that regardless of how Stiller et al adapted it to the big screen it was way too much, way too late-and literature it ain't.I can't imagine anybody was spending the last 30 years dying for this tale to be updated and splattered with all sorts of overwrought acting and overwrought CGI.  But maybe there was that crowd and I'm wrong.  Stranger things and all.I'm sure it had to be a big blow to Stiller though that when Oscar season came along he was disappointed he got passed over.  Has there been a more obvious ploy for respectability and rewardability than this flick in the last 10 years?  Pure desperate attempt.  Unadulterated greed if you ask me.Granted, this movie was harmless enough.  I'm sure only the most jaded and cynical such as myself could be even the least bit offended by this picture gracing the screen of overcrowded multiplexes.  Sure, Lars Von Tiers does far more to offend and torture the eye and senses with his work; some of it grand and some of it rather horrid.  But at least regardless of his intentions and results he always provokes and challenges our better sensibilities.  As for Ben Stiller I think he may qualify as the complete opposite in film.
