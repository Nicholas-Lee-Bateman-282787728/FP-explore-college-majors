1385753,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0045NXMJE,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","Not only am I a big fan of French film, I am also a big fan of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Suffice to say, I was really excited about this movie.  Sadly, while the tone of the film was certainly in line with what I expected from this modern master of cinematic enjoyment (yes, I said it), I must admit that this film failed to do much of anything for me.  It is loud and charismatic and a carnival of sorts, but in the end it just seems like a hodgepodge of mediocrity.Saying that makes me very sad.Don't get me wrong; I love the macabre and the absurd, which are two things that Jean-Pierre Jeunet understands and it is precisely why I love him so much.  I mean, I don't have to explain to anyone my adoration of `Amelie', and that is considered by many to be one of his lesser works; so know that I love him THAT much.  That said; while `Micmacs' certainly is entertaining and it has that whole `absurd' quality that I love so much, it fails to balance it out with anything substantial.  At least `Amelie' knew how to create an absurdity that teetered on emotional complexity; something that felt human and lived in and truly cherished.  `Micmacs' feels slightly underdeveloped; like a gimmick tossed on a plate for minimal effect.The film follows a bunch of freaks as they embark on a mission to turn two major players in arms dealing against one another and create major problems for them; all the while helping one particular freak exact semi-revenge on the company responsible for his father's death and the company who produced the bullet that haphazardly found its way into his skull.Get all that?I like the story.  It has so much promise, and in the capable hands of Jeunet I'd expect it to be embellished to perfection, but it wasn't.  It was just a silly mess that never seemed to go anywhere important, and then when they did try and make some sort of poignant point about arms dealing (that whole ending) it came across manipulative and out of bounds with the rest of the film.I still have faith in Jeunet.  Every director is allowed a misstep here and there.  Even the greats have had their fair share of failed projects.At least Raphael Beau's score is effectively awesome.",3,Mic is macked to death...,1307404800,"06 7, 2011",2011,2190,"['Not', 'only', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'French', 'film', 'am', 'also', 'big', 'fan', 'director', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'Suffice', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'movie', 'Sadly', 'tone', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'line', 'what', 'expected', 'modern', 'master', 'cinematic', 'enjoyment', 'yes', 'said', 'must', 'admit', 'film', 'failed', 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'loud', 'charismatic', 'carnival', 'sorts', 'end', 'just', 'hodgepodge', 'mediocrity.Saying', 'very', 'sad.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'macabre', 'absurd', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'understands', 'precisely', 'why', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'explain', 'anyone', 'adoration', 'Amelie', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'one', 'lesser', 'so', 'know', 'love', 'THAT', 'much', 'said', 'Micmacs', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'absurd', 'quality', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'balance', 'out', 'anything', 'substantial', 'least', 'Amelie', 'knew', 'how', 'create', 'absurdity', 'teetered', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'something', 'felt', 'human', 'lived', 'truly', 'cherished', 'Micmacs', 'feels', 'slightly', 'underdeveloped', 'gimmick', 'tossed', 'plate', 'minimal', 'effect.The', 'film', 'bunch', 'freaks', 'embark', 'mission', 'turn', 'two', 'major', 'players', 'arms', 'dealing', 'one', 'create', 'major', 'problems', 'while', 'helping', 'one', 'particular', 'freak', 'exact', 'semi-revenge', 'company', 'responsible', 'father', 'death', 'company', 'who', 'produced', 'bullet', 'haphazardly', 'found', 'way', 'skull.Get', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'capable', 'hands', 'Jeunet', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'embellished', 'perfection', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'mess', 'never', 'seemed', 'go', 'anywhere', 'important', 'then', 'when', 'did', 'try', 'make', 'sort', 'poignant', 'point', 'arms', 'dealing', 'whole', 'ending', 'came', 'manipulative', 'bounds', 'rest', 'film.I', 'still', 'have', 'faith', 'Jeunet', 'Every', 'director', 'allowed', 'misstep', 'here', 'there', 'Even', 'greats', 'have', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'failed', 'projects.At', 'least', 'Raphael', 'Beau', 'score', 'effectively', 'awesome']",Micmacs

The gadgetry and Parisian backgrounds (mostly in non-tourist venues) are a rich canvas for the antics, however improbable, of this troup. The characters are mostly believable and well-drawn. The movie's only flaw is that the subtitles are not complete. I can't comment on accuracy since I am not a Francophone. But there are several segments when the characters are singing or speaking and the subtitles are absent. Most subtitling of foreign films for Anglophone audiences is poor quality and it's this kind of carelessness that turns people off from subtitled films they would otherwise enjoy.

1385755,AO4WFALWQYTW0,B0045NXMJE,"Bobby Hami ""Ultimateserge""","[14, 42]","Micmacs is a small, french film that must be viewed in the theater to produce the smallest amount of joy. In no way is this an interactive film as The Rocky Horror how is, but in witnessing the laughter of members of the audience, it may be possible to endure this film with a skeptical grin.Micmas is a jumbled mess that involves the orphaned Bazil who is in critical condition after being hit by a gunshot, but miraculously survives. Having lost job, and with no prior savings, he is forced to hit the streets and find his living through unconventional methods. To his good luck he meets the Slammer, himself an ex-con, who introduces him to a group of individuals, with varied talents, who have chosen to live in a dump. Varyingly artistic and athletic, these individuals choose to adopt Bazil by way of an obscure selection process. Bazil eventually becomes aware of identity of the individuals and organization(s) who were responsible for nearly ending his life. Unable to take action by himself, he enlists the talents of his new brothers and sisters in divulging the true identity of these despicable people.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is well known for his exquisite characters studies, but going awry devotes little time on his characters in this picture. It actually seems like Jeunet has no interest in developing these characters as Bazil and his new-found characters lack personality; all that is known is that one of them is an artist, the other a contortionist and etc. Not only does this limited information make them seem superficial, but also unable the actors to give better performances. For their characters to become convincing and pleasant the actors have to deliver bombastic and overblown performances to conceal their weakly written characters.Jeunet has admitted that Micmacs was largely influenced by silent comedy with scenes that seem to be replicas of the old comedy masters-such as Buster Keaton. Were Chaplin, Keaton,  and Lloyd were whimsical, Jeunet is overindulgent and lacks the sense of control in guiding the comedic elements. Rather than serving as an administrator over the picture, he is too absorbed by the gags and special effects to comprehend where whimsy becomes just becomes wasteful and pathetic. Silent comedy functions greatly, to this day, because their humor is substitutes for their shortage of dialogue. Micmacs uses comedy to conceal its weakness in storytelling.With the Home Alone series families received a unique experience as the envisioned gags of the series, despite their excessive nature, were so basic in their conception that they still remained hilarious. Micmacs's gags are as excessive as the Home Alone series, but are also substantially sophistication. The success of the gags is impressive, but is undercut by the realization that there must have been a dozen easier methods of completing the mission of the film. The gags are so flawless that it seems that the raw materials for these gags are always too conveniently within the reach of our heroes. The gags are exquisitely done, but their technical value pales when it is realized that Jeunet's attempt is to carry the film on the weight of the gags alone.Micmacs is among those cute, little, French films that Jeunet, as the director of Amelie, has proved more than able to conceive time and time again. The difference is that unlike his other films, in this instance he lacks an approach. Many may find the film funny, but as a whole Micmacs is a hallow mess.",2,Micmacs takes unrealism to the absurd and preposterous,1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,3487,"['Micmacs', 'small', 'french', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'theater', 'produce', 'smallest', 'amount', 'joy', 'way', 'interactive', 'film', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'how', 'witnessing', 'laughter', 'members', 'audience', 'may', 'be', 'possible', 'endure', 'film', 'skeptical', 'grin.Micmas', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'orphaned', 'Bazil', 'who', 'critical', 'condition', 'being', 'hit', 'gunshot', 'miraculously', 'Having', 'lost', 'job', 'prior', 'savings', 'forced', 'hit', 'streets', 'find', 'living', 'unconventional', 'methods', 'good', 'luck', 'Slammer', 'ex-con', 'who', 'group', 'individuals', 'varied', 'talents', 'who', 'have', 'chosen', 'live', 'dump', 'Varyingly', 'artistic', 'athletic', 'individuals', 'choose', 'adopt', 'Bazil', 'way', 'obscure', 'selection', 'process', 'Bazil', 'eventually', 'aware', 'identity', 'individuals', 'organization', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'nearly', 'ending', 'life', 'Unable', 'take', 'action', 'talents', 'new', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'divulging', 'true', 'identity', 'despicable', 'people.Director', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'well', 'known', 'exquisite', 'characters', 'studies', 'going', 'awry', 'devotes', 'little', 'time', 'characters', 'picture', 'actually', 'like', 'Jeunet', 'interest', 'developing', 'characters', 'Bazil', 'new-found', 'characters', 'lack', 'personality', 'known', 'one', 'artist', 'other', 'contortionist', 'etc', 'Not', 'only', 'limited', 'information', 'make', 'seem', 'superficial', 'also', 'unable', 'actors', 'give', 'better', 'performances', 'characters', 'become', 'convincing', 'pleasant', 'actors', 'have', 'deliver', 'bombastic', 'overblown', 'performances', 'conceal', 'weakly', 'written', 'characters.Jeunet', 'admitted', 'Micmacs', 'was', 'largely', 'influenced', 'silent', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'replicas', 'old', 'comedy', 'masters-such', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Were', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'Lloyd', 'were', 'whimsical', 'Jeunet', 'overindulgent', 'sense', 'control', 'guiding', 'comedic', 'elements', 'Rather', 'serving', 'administrator', 'picture', 'too', 'absorbed', 'gags', 'special', 'effects', 'comprehend', 'where', 'whimsy', 'becomes', 'just', 'becomes', 'wasteful', 'pathetic', 'Silent', 'comedy', 'functions', 'greatly', 'day', 'humor', 'substitutes', 'shortage', 'dialogue', 'Micmacs', 'comedy', 'conceal', 'weakness', 'storytelling.With', 'Home', 'Alone', 'series', 'families', 'received', 'unique', 'experience', 'envisioned', 'gags', 'series', 'excessive', 'nature', 'were', 'so', 'basic', 'conception', 'still', 'remained', 'hilarious', 'Micmacs', 'gags', 'are', 'as', 'excessive', 'Home', 'Alone', 'series', 'are', 'also', 'substantially', 'sophistication', 'success', 'gags', 'impressive', 'undercut', 'realization', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'dozen', 'easier', 'methods', 'completing', 'mission', 'film', 'gags', 'are', 'so', 'flawless', 'raw', 'materials', 'gags', 'are', 'always', 'too', 'conveniently', 'reach', 'heroes', 'gags', 'are', 'exquisitely', 'done', 'technical', 'value', 'pales', 'when', 'realized', 'Jeunet', 'attempt', 'carry', 'film', 'weight', 'gags', 'alone.Micmacs', 'cute', 'little', 'French', 'films', 'Jeunet', 'director', 'Amelie', 'proved', 'more', 'able', 'conceive', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'difference', 'other', 'films', 'instance', 'approach', 'Many', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'funny', 'whole', 'Micmacs', 'hallow', 'mess']",Micmacs

1385757,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0045NXMJE,C. Sawin,"[4, 8]","It seems as though I have a lot of catching up to when it comes to director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. With Amelie in the top 250 on IMDb and many people talking about how great both Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children are, it's definitely something I'll have to look into. In the meantime, before Micmacs Alien: Resurrection had been the only film of Jeunet's that I'd seen. It had been way too long since my last viewing of that, so I didn't make the connection that it was the same director until after Micmacs was over. There are quite a lot of positive reviews and comments about Micmacs all over the internet, so I felt like I had to see it. Unfortunately, it didn't click with me as much as it did with others.The film does have a unique look to it that was originally what grabbed a hold of my interest. The first thing that comes to mind is how quirky and eccentric the animation and visual effects are. Whether it's the mechanical creatures Petit Pierre creates with recycled materials or the unusual bits of animation in the film, it's all incredibly eye catching.The biggest element the film is missing, however, is character development. There really seems to be not much of any in this film. You're introduced to these oddball characters, but then the rest of the film is devoted to this intricate plan on how to take down these two weapons manufacturers. Even the one subplot that has two of the characters fall in love doesn't get enough screen time. It's like the film becomes too wrapped up and involved within its own whimsical desires to really establish much of anything else. To add to that, the film isn't really funny despite being labeled as a comedy. It has its short lived charming moments that will put a smile on your face, but there's maybe one or two scenes that might make you snicker audibly.Micmacs devotes too much time to its playfully involved and original tale of revenge that results in you not really caring about the characters by the time the film ends. It's visually stunning, but has little to offer other than fantastic visuals that ooze creativity from every frame. Despite being a rather elaborate tale of revenge, the film is slightly reminiscent of what Michel Gondry's take on Snatch would be like. Whether that's good or bad lies entirely within the person viewing the film.",3,"Exquisite eye candy, but little else.",1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,2325,"['have', 'lot', 'catching', 'up', 'when', 'director', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'Amelie', 'top', '250', 'IMDb', 'many', 'people', 'talking', 'how', 'great', 'Delicatessen', 'City', 'Lost', 'Children', 'are', 'definitely', 'something', ""'ll"", 'have', 'look', 'meantime', 'Micmacs', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', 'had', 'been', 'only', 'film', 'Jeunet', ""'d"", 'seen', 'had', 'been', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'last', 'viewing', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'connection', 'was', 'same', 'director', 'Micmacs', 'was', 'over', 'are', 'quite', 'lot', 'positive', 'reviews', 'comments', 'Micmacs', 'internet', 'felt', 'had', 'see', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'others.The', 'film', 'have', 'unique', 'look', 'was', 'originally', 'what', 'grabbed', 'hold', 'interest', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'how', 'quirky', 'eccentric', 'animation', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'mechanical', 'creatures', 'Petit', 'Pierre', 'recycled', 'materials', 'unusual', 'bits', 'animation', 'film', 'incredibly', 'eye', 'catching.The', 'biggest', 'element', 'film', 'missing', 'however', 'character', 'development', 'really', 'be', 'not', 'much', 'film', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'oddball', 'characters', 'then', 'rest', 'film', 'devoted', 'intricate', 'plan', 'how', 'take', 'down', 'two', 'weapons', 'manufacturers', 'Even', 'one', 'subplot', 'two', 'characters', 'fall', 'love', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'film', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'involved', 'own', 'whimsical', 'desires', 'really', 'establish', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'add', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'funny', 'being', 'labeled', 'comedy', 'short', 'lived', 'charming', 'moments', 'will', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'might', 'make', 'snicker', 'audibly.Micmacs', 'devotes', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'playfully', 'involved', 'original', 'tale', 'revenge', 'results', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'characters', 'time', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'little', 'offer', 'other', 'fantastic', 'visuals', 'ooze', 'creativity', 'frame', 'being', 'rather', 'elaborate', 'tale', 'revenge', 'film', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'what', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'take', 'Snatch', 'would', 'be', 'Whether', 'good', 'bad', 'lies', 'entirely', 'person', 'viewing', 'film']",Micmacs

1385760,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0045NXMJE,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Jean Pierre Jeunet is one crazy film director. His thought processes are entirely singular. Watching one of his movies is like watching a Rube Goldberg machine. All these goofy things happen, along a circuitous route, but in the end it all works.Micmacs might not be his best best movie but it's still a lot of fun to watch. The basic outline of the plot is fairly simple. The film's hero, Bazil (played delightfully by Dany Boon) has a bullet lodged in his noggin. He got it as an innocent bystander in a robbery attempt. If the doctors yank the bullet he could become a vegetable. If they leave it in he could die. The decision is made by the flip of a coin. Also, he lost his father to a land mine. So now, with the help of a loose-knit family of people, occupying space in a junk yard, (they are the Micmacs of the title) he tries to bring down the two arms manufacturers responsible for the bullet and the land mine. They devise an intricat plot, fueled by an array of weird gadgets honed together from detritus in the junk yard, to do the deed.Jeunet uses a similar color palette to the one he used in 'A very Long Engagement' with a lot of yellows and golds. As usual, it's a great looking movie where not a frame is wasted. It has the usual array of crazy characters and great attention is given to even the most minute of details.Where it falters a bit is in the script. The beginning is a bit clunky. Not enough time is given to our meeting the Micmacs and his building a relationship with them. They ""adopt"" him, and in a heartbeat, they're off on their mission. Also, this movie is set in the here and now so his sense of whimsy doesn't work as well as it has in his other films. As a jaded society, we realize that there is no way these people will get anywhere near enough to these arms manufacturers to pull off their stunt. He also needed to do a better job building the romance between Bazil and the contortionist. That all happens just a bit too quickly.That being said, this is still a wild ride.

Now an adult, he works in a video store and is obsessed by old movies whose lines he learned by heart.  When a stray bullet ricochets into his brain and the doctors are afraid to operate, he loses his job and ends up on the streets, finally to be adopted by a bizarre band of tinkerers and circus-style ""freaks.""

It's both whimsical and poignant, silly and serious.  Each of the members of his new ragtag family has something unique to offer, that turns out to be exactly what they need in their efforts to strike a blow at the military industrial complex.  There is the contortionist and the human calculator, the human cannonball and the collector of cliches; these and others allow him to infiltrate the lives of his nemeses, and create unpredictable havoc, all in the service of a brilliant scheme.

In its whimsy, and its resemblance to classic silent comedy, and for its visual inventiveness, the film feels like a return to the lighthearted dark comedy styling ofDelicatessen(and there's a wonderful moment here that is a very direct reminder of that film), but there's more at stake here and the fantasy realm he invents is embedded in a reality that is manifestly that of our world.

Amelie, City of Children (La cit&eacute; des enfants perdus), Delicatessen, etc...all exceptional movies and all having those surrealistic, fantastical, whimsical-laden settings and heart-tugging story lines that Jean-Pierre Jeunet does so well.  Micmacs seems very much in the same vein of his previous films with a minor exception for me.  I just didn't feel the character development was on par with his previous works.  That one little ingredient in a Jean-Pierre Jeunet film that usually cements the experience for me is a level of empathetic bonding with the characters.  He's phenomenal at portraying and visualizing a character's emotional response in a way that is so easy to relate to, usually in a very child-like and innocent way.And that's where this movie just didn't quite reach the same bar as the rest of his works (for me anyway). The cinematography and set design were, per usual, incredible.  The story line is interesting and entertaining, and the ensemble of characters he's created have that magical element, but I can't say I felt the same level of emotional connection to the characters as I have in his past movies.  It seemed like he didn't have enough time to develop the background and pull the viewer in so effortlessly, say like the opening sequence in Amelie (still one of my all-time favorite sequences in a movie).If you like Jean-Pierre Jeunet films, I expect you'll like this.  I did, just not quite as much as his previous works (a couple of which I would probably rate 6 out of 5 stars), but it was still a very enjoyable escape during the hour and 45 minutes it ran.

This lies squarely betweenAmelieandThe City of Lost Childrenin a number of ways: in warmth, in contact with reality, in believable characters. But, with fantasy of this calibre, you just have to take it in its own terms, whatever the heck those are.This starts with gritty urban credibility. As a boy, Bazil's father is killed by a weapon from one dealer. As an adult, he's nearly killed by a weapon from another. Brain-injured but capable, he finds a new home among an urban salon de refusees - the people refused by the rest of society. The take him in as one of their own and with him, his mission for revenge. From there, Micmacs creates a beautiful assemblage of slapstick, political commentary, personal warmth, and intellectual goofing. Each character (and they are characters) contributes in his or her own way. Early on, though, I glommed onto the contortionist. Really, she has a central spot in all the good scenes.Fun, fantasical, and fairly flaky, I wish this for everyone with a taste for the quirky.-- wiredweird",5,Surreal French fantasy,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,1050,"['Almost', 'not', 'quite', 'squarely', 'betweenAmelieandThe', 'City', 'Lost', 'Childrenin', 'number', 'ways', 'warmth', 'contact', 'reality', 'believable', 'characters', 'fantasy', 'calibre', 'just', 'have', 'take', 'own', 'terms', 'heck', 'are.This', 'gritty', 'urban', 'credibility', 'boy', 'Bazil', 'father', 'killed', 'weapon', 'one', 'dealer', 'adult', 'nearly', 'killed', 'weapon', 'Brain-injured', 'capable', 'new', 'home', 'urban', 'salon', 'refusees', 'people', 'refused', 'rest', 'society', 'take', 'one', 'own', 'mission', 'revenge', 'there', 'Micmacs', 'beautiful', 'assemblage', 'slapstick', 'political', 'commentary', 'personal', 'warmth', 'intellectual', 'goofing', 'character', 'are', 'characters', 'own', 'way', 'Early', 'glommed', 'contortionist', 'Really', 'central', 'spot', 'good', 'scenes.Fun', 'fantasical', 'fairly', 'flaky', 'wish', 'everyone', 'taste', 'quirky.', 'wiredweird']",Micmacs
