It's arguably one of the best road movies ever made and unusual in that the two protagonists are female. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis gave the performances of their lives - and so became iconic.When independent waitress Louise and her downtrodden housewife friend Thelma take a vacation to a mountain cabin, mayhem ensues. Stopping for a drink in a country western bar, Thelma steps out to get some air and is almost raped by a local thug. Louise shoots him and the two women become outlaws heading towards Mexico. Along the way, Louise, with her tortured past, becomes softer and more vulnerable while Thelma casts off her southern girlishness and gets bad to the bone.Harvey Keitel as the compassionate cop, Michael Madsen as Louise's sexy yet commitment shy musician boyfriend, Brad Pitt as Thelma's bad ass one night stand  give stand out performances. Christopher McDonald, particularly, shines as Darryl, Thema's pig of a husband, and is absolutely hilarious.Beautifully written, poignant, funny and thrilling--if you haven't seen it yet [or for a long time]--it's a must.

Husbands who  do not understand what a Woman has gone through and women who do not understand, because they were not raped.  Guess what it can happen to any woman and in our society we have seen this happening, also to men.You must remember at the time this was made, so many women were afraid to come forward if raped.  Many live with this horror the rest of their lives unless they find help or want help to take way those nightmares.  The story is well written and direction of the movie was perfect to make this a block buster movie for all times.

The people that Thelma and Lousie meet are characters we all have run across at sometime in our lives, One character in particular no other than Brad Pitt a first role for him, as a very young man who is out to take what he wants from anyone.  The characters were like some I have met in my travels and if you have traveled the open roads you know what I mean.  The Good and the Bad are part of humanity, we just need to be aware of our surroundings and beware of strangers in general.An Adult movie for a Friday or Saturday night to very much enjoy.Below is the link to watch a movie that has gone down in history:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I2VEOII/ref=wtls_list_pr_19",5,"WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN RAPED NEVER FORGET, BELIEVE ME",1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,1534,"['Thelma', 'Louise', 'what', 'most', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'raped', 'feel', 'lives', 'Husbands', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'Woman', 'gone', 'women', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'were', 'not', 'raped', 'Guess', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'woman', 'society', 'have', 'seen', 'happening', 'also', 'men.You', 'must', 'remember', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'were', 'afraid', 'come', 'forward', 'raped', 'Many', 'live', 'horror', 'rest', 'lives', 'find', 'help', 'want', 'help', 'take', 'way', 'nightmares', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'direction', 'movie', 'was', 'perfect', 'make', 'block', 'buster', 'movie', 'times', 'Directed', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'written', 'Callie', 'Khouri.Geena', 'Davis', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'as', 'well', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'were', 'perfect', 'actors', 'roles', 'Especially', 'character', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'people', 'Thelma', 'Lousie', 'meet', 'are', 'characters', 'have', 'run', 'sometime', 'lives', 'One', 'character', 'particular', 'other', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'first', 'role', 'very', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'take', 'what', 'anyone', 'characters', 'were', 'have', 'met', 'travels', 'have', 'traveled', 'open', 'roads', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Good', 'Bad', 'are', 'part', 'humanity', 'just', 'need', 'be', 'aware', 'surroundings', 'beware', 'strangers', 'general.An', 'Adult', 'movie', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'night', 'very', 'much', 'enjoy.Below', 'link', 'watch', 'movie', 'gone', 'down', 'history', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I2VEOII/ref=wtls_list_pr_19']",N/A
