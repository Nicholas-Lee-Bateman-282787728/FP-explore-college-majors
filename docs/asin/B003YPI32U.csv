However there is a clear divide between chef's who have no hope, chef's who start fine but are on a sinking ship, and the chef's that demonstrate potential to stay in the game longer. But even that last group has strong/weak division. I enjoyed this season but it is slower then other seasons.For me it worked as I enjoyed this cast but for some it won't for many understandable reasons. I like this season but it's one of the lower seasons I like.",4,The First Round,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,557,"['Hell', 'Kitchen', 'Season', '1', 'nice', 'start', 'show', 'not', 'crazy', 'cast', 'grow', 'However', 'clear', 'divide', 'chef', 'who', 'have', 'hope', 'chef', 'who', 'start', 'fine', 'are', 'sinking', 'ship', 'chef', 'demonstrate', 'potential', 'stay', 'game', 'longer', 'even', 'last', 'group', 'strong/weak', 'division', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'slower', 'then', 'other', 'seasons.For', 'worked', 'enjoyed', 'cast', 'wo', ""n't"", 'many', 'understandable', 'reasons', 'season', 'one', 'lower', 'seasons', 'like']",N/A
