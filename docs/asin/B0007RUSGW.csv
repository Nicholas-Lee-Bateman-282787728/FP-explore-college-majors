888702,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0007RUSGW,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 4]","""Sideways"" has a fine premise for a movie:  Two friends go traveling in Northern California to celebrate the freedom of bachelorhood before one of them gets married.  Both have their own selfish interests and addictions:  (One is addicted to alcohol [Paul Giamatti]; the other is addicted to sex [Thomas Hayden Church].)  Their passions seem to be their only bond, for they increasingly separate from one another, each to pursue his own obsession.  Their escapades reveal desperation for each and provide some revealing and comic situations along the way.The acting is exceptional.  Paul Giamatti is particularly expert at playing the lonely wino and conniosseur.  We may not always like the characters (and maybe we're not supposed to), but we can find their struggles and the story appealing enough.  The story is complete, unlike some films that only try to illustrate relationships and do little else.

888705,A6NJ1GAUXC1JW,B0007RUSGW,A Customer,"[16, 31]","If I read another review comparing this movie to a fine Pinot Noir, or a modest vintage, or some other lame wine reference, I'm going to throw up.  ""Sideways"" was clearly this year's winner for ""mediocre film that was fashionable to like.""  When I read the glowing reviews for this snoozefest, I keep wondering - what the hell movie were these people watching?!?Let's take a close look at the movie ""Sideways.""  Let's start with an unbelievably dull story featuring two pathetic, unlikeable characters - our male protagonists - that we don't really know a whole lot about - or care.Take randomn, unbelievable situations, two likeable, female characters who have NO chemistry with our protaganists, and be sure to add generous amounts of lame wine metaphors for life.  Mix thoroughly and there you have the movie, ""Sideways.""  Trust me, the yucks are far and few in between.No knock on the actors, they do a decent job, but there's nothing there, script or story-wise, that makes this movie work or enjoyable.  Don't kid yourself.The other thing that gets me is the pretentious, high brow appreciation people seem to associate with the film - maybe because the movie has something to do with wine - I guess they assume that lends a level of ""sophistication"" to the film.  In reality, nothing but the opposite could be true.  This movie reaches for the lowest common denominator and relies on crude humor: language, nudity, and sexual situations - in order to garner what few laughs the film has.When I hear people talk about the ""subtleties"" of the film and its humor, I just have to laugh.  Trust me, there's nothing ""subtle"" about ""getting your bone smooched,"" or watching a crazy naked guy chasing after Paul Giamatti with his shlong swinging around.

888707,A3OGWBZV2F8M74,B0007RUSGW,"Adam Rosenbaum ""Author of 'How to Remember No...","[6, 8]","Sideways is the story of two best friends, Miles (a neurotic wine loving depressive) and Jack (overloaded with testosterone), who leave on a one-week vacation to Southern California wine country ahead of Jack's marriage the following week.The two men clearly see life quite differently, where Miles is bogged down in everything that's wrong with the world, Jack is just looking to have a good old time, in spite of the fact that he's about to get married. The movie focuses heavily on this conflict, which is intensified when the duo comes in contact with two local woman (played by Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen), and Jack has a wild fling with one of them. The main focus of this film is the dialogue that outlines the conflict between Miles and Jack, as well as the setting in wine country, which provides great scenery but also serves as the basis for a lot of the conversation and the direction of the plot.This movie can stand on its own with the plot and dialogue, but it will be more meaningful to someone who either knows about wine (which I do not) or who has spent time driving through California wine country. Since the setting is a very key aspect of the film, familiarity with the location is useful. There is plenty humor in this movie, although it's subtle, and it's not the type of picture that will have you falling out of your chair with laughter.I recommend ""Sideways"" if you're looking for a film with clever dialogue and a serious plot with crafty humor. If you like movies like ""Lost in Translation"" this should be appealing.

888708,AHL35XZ3OND2Z,B0007RUSGW,Adron Gardner,"[13, 15]","The FilmWhat a great film. Sideways is one of the few movies based on a book that improves a good deal over its source material. And it is absolutely hilarious. The reason I like Sideways, for better or for worse, is I know both Jack and Miles too well. At one time or another, I've walked in both of their shoes. Alexander Payne reaches a zenith of sorts with his quiet eccentric style. The film blends friendship, the road trip and a party flick. The wine provides an interesting tenor to boot. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are completely irreplaceable in their respective roles. They're sort of cosmopolitan R2D2 and C3P0 roadies.The Blu-RayThere's been a lot of complaints over perceived Blu-Ray quality over the standard DVD.  I can tell you, the Blu-Ray is better.  On a large 1080p screen, there is a noticeable difference.  Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael created a unique look for the visuals to give the film a signature feel.  All those smudgy light plumes, and glowing highlights come from diffusion and slight overexposure folks, maybe even a shot of digital grading to punch the highlights.  None of those things lend themselves to the sharpest end products - the end product is a vintage style soft image.  The Blu-Ray IS indeed better. There is no way i would choose the DVD over this. If you don't have a big enough 1080p screen for it to matter, however, the DVD will probably suffice.  But come on, at $10 for the BD, why choose the DVD?",5,"""I think it was Bukowski...""",1287792000,"10 23, 2010",2010,1468,"['FilmWhat', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'based', 'book', 'good', 'deal', 'source', 'material', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'reason', 'like', 'Sideways', 'better', 'worse', 'know', 'Jack', 'Miles', 'too', 'well', 'one', 'time', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'shoes', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'zenith', 'sorts', 'quiet', 'eccentric', 'style', 'film', 'friendship', 'road', 'trip', 'party', 'flick', 'wine', 'interesting', 'tenor', 'boot', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'are', 'completely', 'irreplaceable', 'respective', 'roles', ""'re"", 'sort', 'cosmopolitan', 'R2D2', 'C3P0', 'roadies.The', 'Blu-RayThere', 'been', 'lot', 'complaints', 'perceived', 'Blu-Ray', 'quality', 'standard', 'DVD', 'can', 'tell', 'Blu-Ray', 'better', 'large', '1080p', 'screen', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'Cinematographer', 'Phedon', 'Papamichael', 'created', 'unique', 'look', 'visuals', 'give', 'film', 'signature', 'feel', 'smudgy', 'light', 'plumes', 'glowing', 'highlights', 'come', 'diffusion', 'slight', 'overexposure', 'folks', 'maybe', 'even', 'shot', 'digital', 'grading', 'punch', 'highlights', 'None', 'things', 'lend', 'sharpest', 'end', 'products', 'end', 'product', 'vintage', 'style', 'soft', 'image', 'Blu-Ray', 'IS', 'indeed', 'better', 'way', 'i', 'would', 'choose', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'enough', '1080p', 'screen', 'matter', 'however', 'DVD', 'will', 'probably', 'suffice', 'come', '10', 'BD', 'why', 'choose', 'DVD']",Sideways (Region 2)
888709,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0007RUSGW,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 12]","I will continually stand by my point with two arguments pertaining to this film.  The first being that this fine piece of cinematic brilliance should have won an Academy Award this year.  The Academy should not have just handed Alexander Payne the award for Best Screenplay (as they did Sophia Coppola), but instead awarded him top honors.  This was more than just a story about a famous singer, or an aviator, or a suffering boxer, but instead a story about the human spirit, the bond of friendship, and the power of wine.  To me, all very symbolic of being a human being.  The second argument that I have is that Paul Giamatti was, literally, robbed from being involved with the Oscars this year.  His performance was the strongest that I saw last year, and the strongest that I have seen so far this year.  He brought his character to life, giving us this sense of ""every man"" coupled with that oh-so-familiar feeling of loss and frustration.  We have all been there, we have all seen the effects that it can have on us, and I truly think that Giamatti best embodied that sensation.With that grumbling aside, I strongly think that this was an amazing film by any standards.  The performances, like wine, were rich, subtle, and just some small scents of fruitiness.  Alexander Payne has proven, with this film and his previous outings that he can capture the American spirit while also showing us a world that is originally not seen in other films.  I cannot remember the last film that I saw where wine was nearly the central character and the surroundings just happened to be quaint little bits of wine country.  The cinematography was beautiful and breathtaking.  For any of us that have never been to that side of the world, Payne gives us that glimpse and creates that sensation of excitement.  After seeing this film, I want to go there, I want to smell what Miles smelled, while racing through the vineyards.  You know that a film has been successful when it actually creates a stir in your body to want to visit that place and experience it yourself.  Payne not only miraculously showed us a beautiful part of our country, but also brought forward the passion for wine.  Wine enthusiasts could only have written the speeches that Giamatti delivers.  While I know that Payne did not do this all his own, you could almost taste the wine that he, Jim Taylor, and Rex Pickett tasted while they were writing.  It is one of those rare cinematic moments where the wine just seeps from the edges of your television, and you instantly fall in love.So, you have a brilliant mind behind the camera giving the direction, you have a passionate subject that explores one of America's pastimes, what else is there to rave about this film.  Well, as if I didn't semi-mention it already, how about the acting?  Could anyone else have put together a stronger cast than Payne did?  Would anyone else have seen Giamatti as the lead and thought that he could handle the pressures of a leading man?  What about Thomas Haden Church?  Did anyone think that this material would put his name into the Oscar scrapbook?  Then there is Madsen, who literally ventured out of the dark to do this project, and she proved that she is ready for Hollywood.  To say that the acting in this film carried this picture would be bad, because every element co-existed together perfectly, but the acting was a notch above your normal field of Hollywood movies.  Giamatti was, well, a genius and I will forever wave my fist at the Academy for forgetting him.  He couldn't have carried this film on his own, thanks to Oh, Church, and Madsen, these four prove they were the power behind this movie.  They were jaw-dropping pieces of perfection.Overall, as if you couldn't tell already, I thought that this was one of the best cinematic outings to come out of Hollywood this year.  Payne, unlike his early work with Miramax, had complete creative control over this project and he proved that he could handle a balanced story, with complex characters and plenty of wine.  His passion for our American landscape shined brightly through this film as it did with About Schmidt, as he toured us through some unknown nooks and crannies of our nation.  He proved that he could bring some lost nobodies out into the mainstream light and prove that he could bring the best out from them.  He proved, to the film community, that he is ready for bigger, bolder projects, and I have no doubt in my mind that we will soon see his face with a ""Best Director"" Oscar right next to it.  Alexander Payne is one of Hollywood's most underappreciated secrets, and it is about time that he is unleashed onto the world.Bravo Sideways, Bravo.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,I like how wine continues to evolve...,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,4707,"['will', 'continually', 'stand', 'point', 'two', 'arguments', 'pertaining', 'film', 'first', 'being', 'fine', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'brilliance', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'year', 'Academy', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'just', 'handed', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'award', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'did', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'instead', 'awarded', 'top', 'honors', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'famous', 'singer', 'aviator', 'suffering', 'boxer', 'instead', 'story', 'human', 'spirit', 'bond', 'friendship', 'power', 'wine', 'very', 'symbolic', 'being', 'human', 'being', 'second', 'argument', 'have', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'was', 'literally', 'robbed', 'being', 'involved', 'Oscars', 'year', 'performance', 'was', 'strongest', 'saw', 'last', 'year', 'strongest', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'brought', 'character', 'life', 'giving', 'sense', 'man', 'coupled', 'oh-so-familiar', 'feeling', 'loss', 'frustration', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'have', 'seen', 'effects', 'can', 'have', 'truly', 'think', 'Giamatti', 'best', 'embodied', 'sensation.With', 'grumbling', 'aside', 'strongly', 'think', 'was', 'amazing', 'film', 'standards', 'performances', 'wine', 'were', 'rich', 'subtle', 'just', 'small', 'scents', 'fruitiness', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'proven', 'film', 'previous', 'outings', 'can', 'capture', 'American', 'spirit', 'also', 'showing', 'world', 'originally', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'last', 'film', 'saw', 'where', 'wine', 'was', 'nearly', 'central', 'character', 'surroundings', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'quaint', 'little', 'bits', 'wine', 'country', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'breathtaking', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'side', 'world', 'Payne', 'glimpse', 'sensation', 'excitement', 'seeing', 'film', 'want', 'go', 'there', 'want', 'smell', 'what', 'Miles', 'smelled', 'racing', 'vineyards', 'know', 'film', 'been', 'successful', 'when', 'actually', 'stir', 'body', 'want', 'visit', 'place', 'experience', 'Payne', 'not', 'only', 'miraculously', 'showed', 'beautiful', 'part', 'country', 'also', 'brought', 'forward', 'passion', 'wine', 'Wine', 'enthusiasts', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'written', 'speeches', 'Giamatti', 'delivers', 'know', 'Payne', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'all', 'own', 'could', 'almost', 'taste', 'wine', 'Jim', 'Taylor', 'Rex', 'Pickett', 'tasted', 'were', 'writing', 'one', 'rare', 'cinematic', 'moments', 'where', 'wine', 'just', 'seeps', 'edges', 'television', 'instantly', 'fall', 'love.So', 'have', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'camera', 'giving', 'direction', 'have', 'passionate', 'subject', 'one', 'America', 'pastimes', 'what', 'else', 'there', 'rave', 'film', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'semi-mention', 'already', 'how', 'acting', 'Could', 'anyone', 'else', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'stronger', 'cast', 'Payne', 'did', 'Would', 'anyone', 'else', 'have', 'seen', 'Giamatti', 'lead', 'thought', 'could', 'handle', 'pressures', 'leading', 'man', 'What', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Did', 'anyone', 'think', 'material', 'would', 'put', 'name', 'Oscar', 'scrapbook', 'Then', 'Madsen', 'who', 'literally', 'ventured', 'dark', 'do', 'project', 'proved', 'ready', 'Hollywood', 'say', 'acting', 'film', 'carried', 'picture', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'element', 'co-existed', 'together', 'perfectly', 'acting', 'was', 'notch', 'normal', 'field', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Giamatti', 'was', 'well', 'genius', 'will', 'forever', 'wave', 'fist', 'Academy', 'forgetting', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'carried', 'film', 'own', 'thanks', 'Oh', 'Church', 'Madsen', 'four', 'prove', 'were', 'power', 'movie', 'were', 'jaw-dropping', 'pieces', 'perfection.Overall', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'already', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'cinematic', 'outings', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'year', 'Payne', 'early', 'work', 'Miramax', 'had', 'complete', 'creative', 'control', 'project', 'proved', 'could', 'handle', 'balanced', 'story', 'complex', 'characters', 'plenty', 'wine', 'passion', 'American', 'landscape', 'shined', 'brightly', 'film', 'did', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'toured', 'unknown', 'nooks', 'crannies', 'nation', 'proved', 'could', 'bring', 'lost', 'nobodies', 'out', 'mainstream', 'light', 'prove', 'could', 'bring', 'best', 'out', 'proved', 'film', 'community', 'ready', 'bigger', 'bolder', 'projects', 'have', 'doubt', 'mind', 'will', 'soon', 'see', 'face', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'right', 'next', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'secrets', 'time', 'unleashed', 'world.Bravo', 'Sideways', 'Bravo.Grade', '*****', '*****']",Sideways (Region 2)
888710,A3KMMXLJFQENDZ,B0007RUSGW,Alex A. Fintonis,"[6, 7]","I must admit before I watched this film, I had no idea what it was about.  It was recommended to me from friends and I decided to take a break from my horror movies and get into some drama.  Don't get me wrong I am not a stranger from the drama genre but it's not my forte. I have always been a fan of Paul Giamatti.  I remember the first time I saw him in ""Private Parts"" and though he was just hilarious.  I then rented ""American Splendor"", and ""Cinderella Man"" and though he did a wonderful performance in both films, in ""Sideways"" he was incredible.  I am not sure what it is, but he is able to play very memorable characters.In ""Sideways"" he plays a recently divorced 8th grade school teacher who is a wine connoisseur.  A very unique character to say the least, Thomas Haden Church plays Jack a friend Miles (Giamatti) who is having doubts about his wedding.  The two characters venture out on a trip to tour different wineries.  Jack not knowing anything about wine is hilarious when Miles tries to explain the joys of wine drinking to him.  During this trip both characters get involved with two women and that's when the dominos just begin to fall.  Miles is looking for a real relationship but is struggling with still feeling like he needs his ex-wife, while Jack however is just looking for some wild fun before he gets married.  Miles fights through the whole film trying to get Jack to do the right thing while also trying to deal with his own demons.  Jack meanwhile just gets them both in deeper and deeper trouble.  While viewing this film I was constantly rooting for Giamatti's character.  His loyalty to his unmoral friend is amazing.  Seeing how Jack nearly ruins his chances of reinventing his life for the better.  This was a film that I truly enjoyed.

888711,ANS1HSO6D54DX,B0007RUSGW,"Allen ""Eric""","[1, 10]","First off, I want to say that ""Sideways"" is one of the most well written movies I have come across in a long time, and for the most part I really enjoyed this movie. I thought Paul Giamatti had excellent comedic timing, but also did a great job of showing utter dissapointment with life in ones middle age. It's very much a coming of age film for people who face a mid-life crisis. So with that stated, let me break down first the good aspects of ""Sideways"".GoodWriting- Loved the qups between Jack and MilesChemistry- All 4 characters were perfectly well cast. I especially liked Virginia Madsen's performacne, as she had the ability to do what Miles wanted from someone all along, and that was to tell him he wasn't a failure. Somtimes in life, we need people like that.Symbolism- I loved how they would discuss wine as a metaphor for life and love. Beautiful.The badNUDITY(specifically last 5 minutes)- There are 2 ""sex"" scenes in this movie. The first involves Jack(Haden Church) and Stephanie(Sandra Oh). I actually found this scene to be pretty funny, and quick. The one scene that hurt the movie, was the last 5 minutes of the movie, in which Miles goes to retrive Jack's wallet that he has left at an apartment, in which he sleeps with a married woman(not the same woman in sex scene 1). I do want to warn everyone that thisb scene is graphic, and probably classifies as Porn by my defintion. It involves the dead beat trucker driver and the cheating wife using such foul language, that even I(and I'm not a prude mind you) blushed. This scene is very misoginistic and hurts the tone of the movie. It could have been handled more discretly, and still managed to be funny(I found the part where the guy was running naked after Miles, HILARIOUS).Overall, a wonderful film about life, love and what friendship really entails, and yes it was very profound at times, and yes it was extremly funny on many occassions, but that one scene in the final 5 minutes really hurt this film considerably.",4,It almost was perfect,1117670400,"06 2, 2005",2005,1997,"['First', 'want', 'say', 'Sideways', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'written', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'time', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'thought', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'had', 'excellent', 'comedic', 'timing', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'utter', 'dissapointment', 'life', 'ones', 'middle', 'age', 'very', 'much', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'face', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'So', 'stated', 'let', 'break', 'down', 'first', 'good', 'aspects', 'Sideways', '.GoodWriting-', 'Loved', 'qups', 'Jack', 'MilesChemistry-', 'All', '4', 'characters', 'were', 'perfectly', 'well', 'cast', 'especially', 'liked', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'performacne', 'had', 'ability', 'do', 'what', 'Miles', 'wanted', 'someone', 'was', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'failure', 'Somtimes', 'life', 'need', 'people', 'that.Symbolism-', 'loved', 'how', 'would', 'discuss', 'wine', 'metaphor', 'life', 'love', 'Beautiful.The', 'badNUDITY', 'specifically', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'are', '2', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movie', 'first', 'Jack', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Stephanie', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'actually', 'found', 'scene', 'be', 'pretty', 'funny', 'quick', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Miles', 'retrive', 'Jack', 'wallet', 'left', 'apartment', 'married', 'woman', 'not', 'same', 'woman', 'sex', 'scene', '1', 'do', 'want', 'warn', 'everyone', 'thisb', 'scene', 'graphic', 'probably', 'classifies', 'Porn', 'defintion', 'dead', 'beat', 'trucker', 'driver', 'cheating', 'wife', 'using', 'such', 'foul', 'language', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'prude', 'blushed', 'scene', 'very', 'misoginistic', 'tone', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'more', 'discretly', 'still', 'managed', 'be', 'funny', 'found', 'part', 'where', 'guy', 'was', 'running', 'naked', 'Miles', 'HILARIOUS', '.Overall', 'wonderful', 'film', 'life', 'love', 'what', 'friendship', 'really', 'entails', 'yes', 'was', 'very', 'profound', 'times', 'yes', 'was', 'extremly', 'funny', 'many', 'occassions', 'one', 'scene', 'final', '5', 'minutes', 'really', 'hurt', 'film', 'considerably']",Sideways (Region 2)

The other one, a womanizing jerk, who is getting married, but tries to chase down every skirt that crosses his field of vision. Now, one of these skirts is Sandra Oh, (which improves the bouquet of any movie she's on) so that can be justified, but after she breaks up with him, with the creative use of a helmet, he links up with a married, fluffy waitress, who is more the ""wine in a box"" varietal.These two losers (the guys, not the girls) take off in a tour of the California wine country, where one shows off his (greatly imaginary) wine knowledge, and the other just tries to pick up girls. A scene where he is chewing gum while tasting wine is, to me, a classic.If you (like me) grew up in a culture where wine is what you mix baby formula with, it is even funnier to see someone remember what bottle of wine turned her into an aficionada.I recommend this one without reservations.

This is the sort of movie that critics love.  Others in the same vein include Little Miss Sunshine and Annie Hall.  This is supposed to be a hilarious comedy, the best movie of the year with an incredible script.  To me it's a pretentious sitcom, but because it's a movie and not a show it can have heaps of nudity and awkward sex situations for shock humor.  The script for the first half of the movie is forced and the characters, instead of being realistic are fleshed out cliches.  At least when the women enter the dialogue gets better.  Yes, the scene between Miles and Maya is nice, but it can't save the movie.  I kept watching Miles's life tailspin wondering when the humor was supposed to come.  It, in my humble opinion, never did.  I must have been missing something, right?  I must not be smart enough and the jokes must have gone over my head.  I think, however, that they went under me.  There's a lot of low-brow humor here and the script feels weighted down by over-use of profanity.  No, saying [...] doesn't make you more realistic, nor is it especially funny.  Yet that's the opening punchline and the script-writers go-to bag of tricks.  This is a film about a loser winning (Jack) and a loser losing but perhaps making a surprise come-back (Miles).  What it never explains is the relationship between the two losers.  Why are Jack and Miles friends, and why is Miles Jack's best man?  I know, I know-- they're the odd couple and that's the point of the film, but when the only glue to hold that premise together is the excuse that they were roommates in college, then it's not credible from the beginning.

My wife dropped watching after 20 minutes saying two main characters are jerks and she doesn't feel any empathy for them. Well, all I can say - don't stop watching after the beginning - this movie really deserves to be seen. Giamatti's and Church's characters may not be role models but they are truthful and full of life. This is very true-life film in general. The genre is hard to define, it's just a movie about life.Characters are very vivid, situations are real, relashionship is full of nuances, ""Sideways"" sometimes are extremely funny and very sad also. You really start feeling compassion towards the characters especially if you try to imagine yourself in their shoes. And especially if you're a man.

They yearn to, if only for a second, or a weekend, escape from or rise above the tedium of their existence.

It was not.  I think my wife and I chuckled at exactly one line in the movie.  Maybe if I hadn't heard so much about how funny it was, I could've appreciated it as a non-comedy.  But as a comedy, it falls flat.Other reviewers are correct that the acting was excellent.  Too many times an actor takes the blame for poor directing, editing, script, etc.  In this case, I think the film got a lot of kudos due to the fine acting.The scenery is gorgeous.  My wife and I recently toured through some California wineries and the cinematography brought all of that back.  But I never mistook my good feelings about California wine country with good feelings about the movie.All I ask in a movie is to give me characters, however flawed, that I CARE about.  In this movie, the main characters were people I wouldn't give the time of day.  All we SAW was their flaws.  In order to care, we need to see some good qualities early in the movie.  Some good qualities are revealed too late in this movie to make me think more than, ""Well, maybe he's not a TOTAL loser"".  Add to that the fact that I could basically predict the ending of the film after the first 15 minutes.  ""Formulaic"" comes to mind.My advice is to wait to see it for free on TV.

Well I don't know about Church but Giamatti is definitely not. There is a thin line between being human with feelings & a looser. People like Giamatti put a lot of emotion & feeling in what they do be it wine tasting, experiencing gourmet cooking or writing a novel so when something goes wrong it sort of eats away at their soul; its more like an amalgamation of midlife crisis, loss & low sense of worth. A deadly combination, whichever way you look at it.There is no shortage of human emotion in this movie although I really thought Giamatti ought to have been nominated for an Oscar as opposed to Church; don't get me wrong I like Thomas Haden Church, I've been a fan of his ever since Wings & Ned & Stacy, he's good, versatile & overall quite believable but I think Giamatti takes the cake in this movie & a great choice for his role.Verdict: Overall quite an enjoyable movie with some really witty dialogue not to mention the mini-plots within the main plot.

888737,A34PAZQ73SL163,B0007RUSGW,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[3, 5]","I think that it's truly the mark of a stupendous actor when you can't believe they're pulling off role that you're simultaneously seeing them in. This is exactly the case with Paul Giamatti playing Miles in this film. After seeing American Splendor, I could not fathom how the same man could so convincingly depict a Californian metrosexual, wine snob who is far more sensitive than the women he meets. Giamatti's is a heckuva talent because, on top of everything else, he takes the thoroughly beaten clich&eacute; of unpublished layabout writer and morphs it into a believable role, or as his friend says, which so aptly describes his life: ""They think you're a writer."" If I would have read the description of his character on paper, there would be no way that I'd even be slightly interested in him, but in this movie you cannot help but care throughout.The film definitely has an avant-guard feel with its early double, triple, and quadruple feature frames and camera angles. The landscape of the wine country is marvelous so the physical setting could not be improved upon. Authenticity is the most accurate word for the film making. The actors look like real people and so does everybody else. When Miles calls his ex-wife via a payphone, her voice legitimately sounds as if we're listening to it through an obsolete receiver.The only real quandary I had when watching Sideways is just how Thomas Haden Church, who plays Jack, ever became best friends with Miles in the first place even if they were college roommates. Church is a wooden, shallow Ken doll who just wants to have a good time and forget that he's getting married; whereas, Miles wishes he were still married. The one is a connoisseur of outstanding wine while the other just wants to know what the alcohol content is.Virginia Madsen is the sister of Michael Madson and she looks far younger than her real age. Speaking of which, it was a fine idea to use older, mature looking actors in this film because there are few wine enthusiasts in their early twenties. A particularly well-done, and uncommon, scene occurs when Miles projects his own personality onto the Pino grape. He seems to have no idea that he is doing it but, in Madsen's eyes, we can see that she comprehends.I'd have to say that Sideways is a highly refreshing film as it is subtle, sensitive, and redeeming.",5,Incredibly Original.,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,2346,"['think', 'truly', 'mark', 'stupendous', 'actor', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'re"", 'pulling', 'off', 'role', ""'re"", 'simultaneously', 'seeing', 'exactly', 'case', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'playing', 'Miles', 'film', 'seeing', 'American', 'Splendor', 'could', 'not', 'fathom', 'how', 'same', 'man', 'could', 'so', 'convincingly', 'depict', 'Californian', 'metrosexual', 'wine', 'snob', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'sensitive', 'women', 'Giamatti', 'heckuva', 'talent', 'top', 'everything', 'else', 'thoroughly', 'beaten', 'clich', 'eacute', 'unpublished', 'layabout', 'writer', 'morphs', 'believable', 'role', 'friend', 'so', 'aptly', 'describes', 'life', 'think', ""'re"", 'writer', 'would', 'have', 'read', 'description', 'character', 'paper', 'would', 'be', 'way', ""'d"", 'even', 'be', 'slightly', 'interested', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'care', 'throughout.The', 'film', 'definitely', 'avant-guard', 'feel', 'early', 'double', 'triple', 'quadruple', 'feature', 'frames', 'camera', 'angles', 'landscape', 'wine', 'country', 'marvelous', 'physical', 'setting', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'improved', 'Authenticity', 'most', 'accurate', 'word', 'film', 'making', 'actors', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'so', 'everybody', 'else', 'When', 'Miles', 'ex-wife', 'payphone', 'voice', 'legitimately', ""'re"", 'listening', 'obsolete', 'receiver.The', 'only', 'real', 'quandary', 'had', 'when', 'watching', 'Sideways', 'just', 'how', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'who', 'Jack', 'ever', 'became', 'best', 'friends', 'Miles', 'first', 'place', 'even', 'were', 'college', 'roommates', 'Church', 'wooden', 'shallow', 'Ken', 'doll', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'forget', 'getting', 'married', 'whereas', 'Miles', 'were', 'still', 'married', 'one', 'connoisseur', 'outstanding', 'wine', 'other', 'just', 'know', 'what', 'alcohol', 'content', 'is.Virginia', 'Madsen', 'sister', 'Michael', 'Madson', 'far', 'younger', 'real', 'age', 'Speaking', 'was', 'fine', 'idea', 'use', 'older', 'mature', 'looking', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'wine', 'enthusiasts', 'early', 'twenties', 'particularly', 'well-done', 'uncommon', 'scene', 'occurs', 'when', 'Miles', 'projects', 'own', 'personality', 'Pino', 'grape', 'have', 'idea', 'doing', 'Madsen', 'eyes', 'can', 'see', 'comprehends.I', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Sideways', 'highly', 'refreshing', 'film', 'subtle', 'sensitive', 'redeeming']",Sideways (Region 2)

It is not the acting, though this cast does some of the best work I have seen in ages, nor is it the writing, though if I could write like this, I certainly would not be here talking to you about Sideways at 2am on a Monday morning.But this film has an amazing way of making you sympathize, and care for, two deeply flawed characters. Miles, (Paul Giamatti) who broke up with his previous girlfriend, is waiting to hear if his novel will see print, and is drinking heavily, decides to bring his friend Jack on a last party through California Wine Country a week before he gets married.Miles is depressed about his state of affairs, and this shows both in how limps himself through the trip, and the amount he drinks. He is a wine expert, but a definite swallower as opposed to a taster. This becomes clearly evident when he grabs an entire bowl of spit out wine at a tasting and, in a desperate moment, gulps the vino.Jack's (Thomas Haden Church) problem is women. He tries, and succeeds, at picking up any women he meets during the trip, despite his upcoming tying of the not. Depressed and drunk as Miles is he is unable to partake in any of this, even when the friends pick up two beautiful and smart women on their road adventure. (Sandra Oh and Virgina Madson)Both men engage in more than their share of bad behavior during the trip, but it is behavior driven by depression, compulsion, and the most human of heartbreak and vulnerability. We have all acted like this or felt this bad at one point or another. But watching the relationship between the two men, how they support and compliment each other in their imperfection, is what makes us love these characters.The buddy film goes back to the beginning of cinema, and the road movie has been used regularly since the 1960s. Both devices work here, but it is how Sideways shows how two incredibly faulted yet fundamentally decent people can connect with each other, and us. I was reminded watching Sideways how hard, and easy, it is, to keep a bond with someone as imperfect as I am.

His life is going ""Sideways"".Miles is headed to No-wheresville. He's a failed writer, has a messed up friendship with a nearly washed-up actor named Jack (Thomas Haden Church...remember the low-IQ mechanic from the WINGS TV series? Yep, he's back), and is spinning into a pit of self-loathing since his divorce two years prior.If that weren't enough, Jack, his best buddy, is now getting married and Miles has to be his Best Man. Oh! And did we mention that Miles' ex-wife and her new husband are coming to the wedding, too. Lovely! For Miles, already on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications, something is about to break. Better do something unpredictable. But what? Ah yes! ROAD TRIP!So Miles and Jack take a jaunt into California's wine country. Miles, who is a connoisseur of great wines, tries to teach Jake (who's only interests are in getting nasty with a girl -- any girl -- who's interested in him) how to enjoy Pinots, Blancs, and all the other available grape incarnations.But what the two have brought along with them on this trip is their pasts, their present, and, ultimately, their futures.Will this trip spell the end of Jack's engagement if he falls in love with someone else (or thinks he falls)? Can Miles wrestle his own personal demons out from under him while meanwhile trying to keep his best friend from self-destructing?Okay, so some of you might be asking yourselves, ""So what's with the title of your film review?"" Let me explain. First off, this movie has zero CGI effects (Did you hear that! Zero!). Second, there are no heroic battle scenes (not really, unless you consider Susan Oh beating on someone with her motorcycle helmet a ""battle scene"") or impressive set shots. Third, this film moves you into the characters' lives gently, kind of like getting into a pool filled with ice water. You have to go slowly, let your body adjust to the temperature change. For film, this is known as plot and character development (something that Hollyweird sometimes has trouble with). Fourth, you won't find Cindy Crawford look-alikes, or Vin Diesel muscle-types strutting their stuff in this film. This movie has ""true"" characters."" They're F#@$ed up people who look like you or me. And they have real-world problems (they aren't trying to save the world from Zork-the-Terrible before he implodes Earth with his Confabulator 9000).So if you're the type who goes into a theater expecting to be ""blown away"" by the special effects, bypass this one and spare us your review here. But if you enjoy character studies, and don't mind a slow, funny, touching, and downright realistic film, you'll probably love this one.(Congratulations to the screenwriters for their Oscar win!)",5,"Are You A Knuckle-Dragger?

The other day I thought about watching ""Sideways"" for a second time, and I thought to myself, ""..no, its too depressing!""  I'll get to why in a minute.The acting was excellent.  I don't see the genius that others find in Paul Giamatti, except as perhaps, a modern Woody Allen, the world's greatest ""sad sack."" But Giamatti doesn't have Woody's comedy genius - so I'll have to revise what I just said - Paul Giamatti is the world's greatest sad sack.  Tom Church played a man with absolutely no redeeming characteristics, except perhaps that he has befriended the worlds greatest sad sack.I thought Virginia Madsen was very good until the scene where she describes her romantic interest in wine.  Then, like other reviewers, I thought she was amazing.  In this movie, I think wine is a metaphor for what can be cheap, pompous and superficial.  Wine experts are usually just trying to impress other people with cheap, self-serving superficiality.  But then ""Maya"" gives us an honest and genuine assessment, reminding us that there is decency and honesty, even in the world of wine.""Sideways"" very effectively portrayed lives that seemed to be going nowhere but sideways.  And this is the reason, despite all the funny things that happen in this movie, why I think its sad.  The character development in ""Sideways"" is excellent.  As I got to know the characters, I began to empathize with them, so I began to feel bad about the miserable lives they are leading.  Worst of all, was life so miserable for Madsen's magnificent ""Maya"" character that she would find comfort in Giamatti's miserable ""Miles"" character?  Ouch.  And the young woman who actually believed everything she heard from the Tom Church character.  Oh well.  (pun intended).  Basically, these to guys are complete losers.  But because I felt I knew them, I cared for them, and thus, in between the humor, it was painful to watch.One day, I may watch it again for the humor, which had its moments, like when Giamatti takes the monster hit from the dregs bucket, or Tom Church walking around with the bandage on his nose (which seemed to advertise, I am a loser, a complete loser), or the two people having sex while Giamatti re-steals Church's wallet.

888750,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0007RUSGW,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 5]","Nominated for five Academy Awards, and winner of Best Screenplay adapted from an outside source, Sideways turned out to be one of the surprise blockbusters of 2004. Based on the Rex Pickett novel of the same name, Sideways is a clever comedy about wine, life, and a group of friends - each in search of his unique identity. Unlike the plot-driven movies that traditionally dominate Hollywood, Sideways is one of those rare pictures which actually ""reads"" like a novel. The film resembles Seinfeld in that it's really about nothing, but it's about everything all at the same time. With very little to speak of in the way of plot, the movie relies heavily on the development of its quirky characters, and in this aspect, Sideways is an overwhelming success. Something about this movie (which I can't quite put my finger on) makes me love it, and I'm willing to bet that you'll enjoy it too...Paul Giamatti plays the role of Miles Raymond, a middle-aged, recently-divorced high school teacher struggling to publish his novel, The Day After Yesterday (which is, of course, ""today"" - but it's not the same). The film begins when Miles picks up his college roommate Jack (Thomas Haden Church) for a one week bachelor party excursion into the vineyards of Napa Valley. With one week left as a single man, Jack is set for a week of drunkenness and debauchery - but Miles stands in his way. Suffering from a mild depression, Miles wants to savor wine rather than chug it, talk to a woman rather than sleep with her, and generally act as a drag on any of Jack's plans.But when Jack pushes Miles to chase after his waitress friend Maya (Virginia Madsen), life takes a turn for Miles. Meanwhile Jack carries on a torrid affair with Maya's friend Stephanie (Sandra Oh), neither of the women knowing of Jack's impending marriage. When the truth about Jack's wedding slips out, the tidbit threatens to destroy each character's relationship with the other...Oftentimes hilarious, sometimes deeply symbolic, Sideways runs the gambit of human emotion. In addition, the lack of a manufactured plot template serves the purpose of keeping the audience on edge. You never quite know what to expect next. Thomas Haden Church (formerly of Lowell Mather fame on Wings, one my all-time favorite sitcoms) shows his diversity as an actor in his fascinating portrayal of the aggressive, hormone-driven Jack. Determined to live out a wild week of drunken sexual conquest before his wedding day, Jack's self-destructive binge behavior stands in stark contrast to the paralyzed, low risk attitude of Miles. Together, Haden Church and Giamatti create an unforgettable screen combination.And it's this powder keg mixture of relationships between Jack, Miles, Maya, and Stephanie that give Sideways its enticing cinematic flavor. Virginia Madsen received her own Academy Award nomination to go along with Thomas Haden Church, but the Oscar nominations could just as easily have gone to Paul Giamatti and Sandra Oh. In short, Sideways wanders the hills of California wine country as well as the peeks and valleys of the human experience. It's a film about life and decisions and relationships and happiness and everything else. More importantly, it's one of the most interesting and entertaining films of the last several years, and that's why Sideways is a definite must-see film...The DVD Report",5,A extremely enjoyable movie experience...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,3361,"['Nominated', 'five', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'winner', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'adapted', 'outside', 'source', 'Sideways', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'surprise', 'blockbusters', '2004', 'Based', 'Rex', 'Pickett', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Sideways', 'clever', 'comedy', 'wine', 'life', 'group', 'friends', 'search', 'unique', 'identity', 'plot-driven', 'movies', 'traditionally', 'dominate', 'Hollywood', 'Sideways', 'one', 'rare', 'pictures', 'actually', 'reads', 'novel', 'film', 'resembles', 'Seinfeld', 'really', 'nothing', 'everything', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'little', 'speak', 'way', 'plot', 'movie', 'heavily', 'development', 'quirky', 'characters', 'aspect', 'Sideways', 'overwhelming', 'success', 'Something', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'love', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'too', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'role', 'Miles', 'Raymond', 'middle-aged', 'recently-divorced', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'struggling', 'publish', 'novel', 'Day', 'Yesterday', 'course', 'today', 'not', 'same', 'film', 'when', 'Miles', 'up', 'college', 'roommate', 'Jack', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'one', 'week', 'bachelor', 'party', 'excursion', 'vineyards', 'Napa', 'Valley', 'one', 'week', 'left', 'single', 'man', 'Jack', 'set', 'week', 'drunkenness', 'debauchery', 'Miles', 'way', 'Suffering', 'mild', 'depression', 'Miles', 'savor', 'wine', 'rather', 'chug', 'talk', 'woman', 'rather', 'sleep', 'generally', 'act', 'drag', 'Jack', 'plans.But', 'when', 'Jack', 'Miles', 'chase', 'waitress', 'friend', 'Maya', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'life', 'turn', 'Miles', 'Meanwhile', 'Jack', 'torrid', 'affair', 'Maya', 'friend', 'Stephanie', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'women', 'knowing', 'Jack', 'impending', 'marriage', 'When', 'truth', 'Jack', 'wedding', 'out', 'tidbit', 'destroy', 'character', 'relationship', 'other', 'Oftentimes', 'hilarious', 'sometimes', 'deeply', 'symbolic', 'Sideways', 'gambit', 'human', 'emotion', 'addition', 'lack', 'manufactured', 'plot', 'template', 'purpose', 'keeping', 'audience', 'edge', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'next', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'formerly', 'Lowell', 'Mather', 'fame', 'Wings', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'sitcoms', 'diversity', 'actor', 'fascinating', 'portrayal', 'aggressive', 'hormone-driven', 'Jack', 'Determined', 'live', 'out', 'wild', 'week', 'drunken', 'sexual', 'conquest', 'wedding', 'day', 'Jack', 'self-destructive', 'binge', 'behavior', 'stark', 'contrast', 'paralyzed', 'low', 'risk', 'attitude', 'Miles', 'Together', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Giamatti', 'create', 'unforgettable', 'screen', 'combination.And', 'powder', 'mixture', 'relationships', 'Jack', 'Miles', 'Maya', 'Stephanie', 'give', 'Sideways', 'enticing', 'cinematic', 'flavor', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'received', 'own', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'go', 'along', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'have', 'gone', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'short', 'Sideways', 'hills', 'California', 'wine', 'country', 'as', 'well', 'peeks', 'valleys', 'human', 'experience', 'film', 'life', 'decisions', 'relationships', 'happiness', 'everything', 'else', 'More', 'importantly', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'films', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'why', 'Sideways', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'DVD', 'Report']",Sideways (Region 2)

Around Oscar time I'd heard some buzz about it, but I really didn't know what to expect (and I'm always a little suspicious of such effervescence anyway). During the two hours I was hooked to the headphones, I became hooked on this movie.  A wonderful gem, it is a rarity in its elegant simplicity.  The human comedy of the four characters who collide over the course of a wine-imbued weekend is alternately touching and laugh-out-loud.  There is no standout character because the main character IS the ensemble comprised of the four main actors. Such remarkable chemistry within an ensemble is also rare, which means they were likely well-directed (kudos to Alexander Payne).  Sandra Oh is someone I'd seen only once before, and her unusual features and quirkiness just beg to get more camera time---more movies with Sandra, please.  Virginia Madsen managed to convey tremendous sexiness/heat/compassion/passion while waxing almost Shakespeare-poetic---terrific actress.  Thomas Hayden Church has to be one of the most rubber-faced, he's-so-ugly-he's-cute actors and, while the character could have been unsympathetic to the audience, Church played it to perfection so that we felt sorrow and pity for him.  Finally, Paul Giamatti is no one I've seen in anything (who's he?), but his talent in conveying charm, pathos, hope and determination rivaled even the greatest of the classic clowns of cinema.

888757,A2HVKT2ZYDMFKQ,B0007RUSGW,"Captdoherty ""Captdoherty""","[7, 10]","Sideways is a classic film, because it perfectly captures the angst of a growing american demographic-  older singles who are still spiritually lost as they approach middle age. Many films explore the angst of the young. This movie is one of the few that explore the angst of those who are no longer young. This movie is so true to some people's lives that they will view it like a horror movie- it will make them squirm in discomfort.Living in New York City, I have encountered many people like Miles, the main character in ""sideways"".They are in their late thirties and early forties, and they are surprised that their lives are not turning out the way they were supposed to. They live in small rented apartments, work in boring jobs, have endured painful breakups, and wonder what the hell happened to all of their grand plans.They are intelligent, but the hard knocks of life have taken their toll. They no longer have youth on their side, and they  find they don't enjoy the things that used to distract them when they were younger like drinking and partying. They have started to realize the emptiness of a shallow existence. They still want to reach out, but their growing cynicism makes it harder for them to do so. They are simply adrift and don't know where to go next.Sideways is the story of such a man, Miles, played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti ( he was flat out robbed of not only an oscar nomination, but the oscar itself).The entire movie takes place in the course of a road trip to wine country in santa barbara, where Miles and his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church, who is a revelation)are celebrating Jack's last week of freedom before getting married. They meet two women (Sandra oh and virginia madsen) who will affect each of them in surprising ways.What I love about sideways is that it is realistic, but ultimately hopeful. Miles may be divorced, a failed writer, and a near alcoholic, but the last scene shows that he may still find the contentment he so desperately craves.Though it could be seeen as a horror film for the lost middle aged, it is also ultimately a life affirming story for them. And that is why this film is a classic.",5,A horror film for the still lost but no longer young,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,2162,"['Sideways', 'classic', 'film', 'perfectly', 'angst', 'growing', 'american', 'demographic-', 'older', 'singles', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'spiritually', 'lost', 'approach', 'middle', 'age', 'Many', 'films', 'explore', 'angst', 'young', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'explore', 'angst', 'who', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'young', 'movie', 'so', 'true', 'people', 'lives', 'will', 'view', 'horror', 'movie-', 'will', 'make', 'squirm', 'discomfort.Living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'have', 'encountered', 'many', 'people', 'Miles', 'main', 'character', 'sideways', '.They', 'are', 'late', 'thirties', 'early', 'forties', 'are', 'surprised', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'turning', 'out', 'way', 'were', 'supposed', 'live', 'small', 'rented', 'apartments', 'work', 'boring', 'jobs', 'have', 'endured', 'painful', 'breakups', 'wonder', 'what', 'hell', 'happened', 'grand', 'plans.They', 'are', 'intelligent', 'hard', 'knocks', 'life', 'have', 'taken', 'toll', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'youth', 'side', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'things', 'used', 'distract', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'drinking', 'partying', 'have', 'started', 'realize', 'emptiness', 'shallow', 'existence', 'still', 'want', 'reach', 'out', 'growing', 'cynicism', 'harder', 'do', 'so', 'are', 'simply', 'adrift', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'go', 'next.Sideways', 'story', 'such', 'man', 'Miles', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'was', 'flat', 'robbed', 'not', 'only', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'oscar', '.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'place', 'course', 'road', 'trip', 'wine', 'country', 'santa', 'barbara', 'where', 'Miles', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'who', 'revelation', 'are', 'celebrating', 'Jack', 'last', 'week', 'freedom', 'getting', 'married', 'meet', 'two', 'women', 'Sandra', 'oh', 'virginia', 'madsen', 'who', 'will', 'affect', 'surprising', 'ways.What', 'love', 'sideways', 'realistic', 'ultimately', 'hopeful', 'Miles', 'may', 'be', 'divorced', 'failed', 'writer', 'near', 'alcoholic', 'last', 'scene', 'shows', 'may', 'still', 'find', 'contentment', 'so', 'desperately', 'could', 'be', 'seeen', 'horror', 'film', 'lost', 'middle', 'aged', 'also', 'ultimately', 'life', 'affirming', 'story', 'why', 'film', 'classic']",Sideways (Region 2)
888758,AKV2BGUT50B1X,B0007RUSGW,Carl Robinson,"[3, 3]","Sideways is the story of two men, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) who take a week off from their normal lives in San Diego and go to California's wine country.  The pair is a subtle, comedic duo of contrasting personalities.  Miles, is a deeply serious man who is working on a book, Jack is a carefree part-time actor who is betrothed to the sumptuous daughter of a wealthy Armenian businessman.  Additionally, Jack is one of those men who have little talent other than seducing women.In both cases they are men who have failed to launch.  Miles is a divorced 8th Grade English Teacher who dreams of publishing a great work of literature, but hasn't yet and Jack has a difficult time admitting to himself his acting career is going nowhere.While away from home and commitments, they connect with two women, Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh).  Jack's affair with Stephanie leads to serious, last minute doubts on the part of Jack and his pending marriage, but Miles meets his soul mate.  The resulting situation is a complex, interesting study of the gray areas of life.  It is a balanced, well-aged, full bodied comedy.The movie is filmed in a most realistic way.  It is clearly California 2005.  Illegal immigrants pick the grapes, Bush and Rumsfeld are shown on TV, the hotel has the pre-fabricated, mid-grade Hotel look, there are many shots of on-ramps, freeways, and suburban sprawl.  The apartments of both Maya and Miles have an old, shabby-made in the 1950's look to it.  When the characters drink, the film takes a soft focus of wine goggles.As the vacation progresses, Jack decides to make the commitment and get married and the movie ends with Miles seemingly able to get the inspiration he needs to make it as a writer from Maya.",5,Abbott and Costello Take a California Wine Tour,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,1777,"['Sideways', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'Miles', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Jack', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'who', 'take', 'week', 'normal', 'lives', 'San', 'Diego', 'go', 'California', 'wine', 'country', 'pair', 'subtle', 'comedic', 'duo', 'contrasting', 'personalities', 'Miles', 'deeply', 'serious', 'man', 'who', 'working', 'book', 'Jack', 'carefree', 'part-time', 'actor', 'who', 'betrothed', 'sumptuous', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'Armenian', 'businessman', 'Additionally', 'Jack', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'talent', 'other', 'seducing', 'women.In', 'cases', 'are', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'failed', 'launch', 'Miles', 'divorced', '8th', 'Grade', 'English', 'Teacher', 'who', 'publishing', 'great', 'work', 'literature', ""n't"", 'yet', 'Jack', 'difficult', 'time', 'admitting', 'acting', 'career', 'going', 'nowhere.While', 'away', 'home', 'commitments', 'connect', 'two', 'women', 'Maya', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Stephanie', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Jack', 'affair', 'Stephanie', 'serious', 'last', 'minute', 'doubts', 'part', 'Jack', 'pending', 'marriage', 'Miles', 'soul', 'mate', 'resulting', 'situation', 'complex', 'interesting', 'study', 'gray', 'areas', 'life', 'balanced', 'well-aged', 'full', 'bodied', 'comedy.The', 'movie', 'filmed', 'most', 'realistic', 'way', 'clearly', 'California', '2005', 'Illegal', 'immigrants', 'pick', 'grapes', 'Bush', 'Rumsfeld', 'are', 'shown', 'TV', 'hotel', 'pre-fabricated', 'mid-grade', 'Hotel', 'look', 'are', 'many', 'shots', 'on-ramps', 'freeways', 'suburban', 'sprawl', 'apartments', 'Maya', 'Miles', 'have', 'old', 'shabby-made', '1950', 'look', 'When', 'characters', 'drink', 'film', 'soft', 'focus', 'wine', 'goggles.As', 'vacation', 'Jack', 'make', 'commitment', 'get', 'married', 'movie', 'Miles', 'seemingly', 'able', 'get', 'inspiration', 'make', 'writer', 'Maya']",Sideways (Region 2)
888759,A1CBIEDRRVM4CR,B0007RUSGW,Carlton M. Vandiver,"[3, 6]","Other than bedding Virginia Madsen and displaying strong self-awareness, Miles our protaganist has limited appeal.  His foibles and Jack's (the counter-point protaganist) drive the movie.  Interesting the ethos that permits stealing from one's lonely mother for a boys' weekend but balks at philandering.  Meanwhile, the philanderer is displaying a sense of principle in not wanting to take a father in law's job offer.The similarities and dissimilarities between Jack and Miles make the movie interesting.  A few funny lines (""flutter of Edam cheese"") and scenarios (retrieving a lost wallet) are welcome in a story that seems a miserable view of men and men's relationships.  Miles is so pathetic, though, that it's surprising that he's been embraced by hordes of vacationing amateur oenthologists wishing to stay at the same crappy motel.  I suppose some yuppies have trouble finding their own dives.The redeeming scene in the movie, the one that salvages it from mediocrity, is the revealing exchange between two thoughtful characters explaining their appreciation of wine.  Both have reasons that are rooted in their self-image and are surprisingly well-developed.A fun little movie with a different feel and several laughable moments.

This movie reflected the lives of two less than admirable guys.  One of them starts out by stealing from his mother, and he goes downhill from there.  He is an English teacher, which I would have thought would be an admirable profession, but he seems to hate it.  He has no admirable qualities, none at all.  He goes on and on about wine, and all that meant to me was that wine aficionados are shallow, empty people who specialize in a knowledge which is trivial at best, irrelevant at worst.  The other guy has a little more on the ball, but his last week before his marriage has been less than exemplary.There is no saving grace in this movie.  It moves, ever so slowly, from one boring situation to another, specializing in the frowns and depression of the would-be author and true-life loser.  If I got one thing from this terrible, terrible movie, it is that I will never have any respect for anyone who talks wine . .Don't waste your time with this one.  The only people who can appreciate this tripe are probably those who will not admit how bad it is  . . . trying to pretend there is something here . . . like the people raving about modern art that they will not admit they know nothing about . . when in actuality it was painted by an Elephant or a Chimpanzee.

He wants to take his friend since college, Jack (Thomas Haden Church), on a wine tour before Jack gets married. Jack is anxious to sow a few wild oats before he gets hitched, and also wants Miles to sow a few of his own, so Miles can get over the depression of his divorce. Jack is a bounder, a bit of a cad, and an aging rake. He is an actor, primarily television, soap operas, and commercials. His career has peaked, though, and he sees marriage as his last chance. But before that ball and chain gets strapped on to his ankle, he manages to hook up with Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and fixes Miles up with Maya (Virginia Madsen). Together they will go on a double date that will take them through deception to ultimate truth, and for Jack and Miles, it will be a lesson in life, betrayal, and a chance for redemption.Sideways is a great film about 4 humans, each with their own good points and flaws. It was played by 4 actors, each with their own virtues and shortcomings. There was also a writer, who wrote a book that was turned into a screenplay by the director. The director was married to one of the actresses in real life. She was quoted as saying that her favorite rock musician was Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips, because he looked like her husband, Alexander Payne, and she could fantasize that she was married to a rock star. They married shortly before starting the film project, and divorced soon after. In an interview on NPR Sandra Oh said that it was all right working with a spouse, but on the way home from the set each night, they would talk about themselves in the third person. Alexander would say, ""So, was the director being too harsh with you today?"" I am speculating that some of the steamy love scenes might have created a lot of friction, that wasn't being resolved because of their oblique approach to conflict resolution, the third person discussions of themselves, the disguised arguments that must have come off like some kind of passive-aggressive Olympics.Sandra Oh gave an excellent performance in Sideways. Nowadays she plays Dr Christina Yang on Gray's Anatomy. I used to like the TV show, but the preposterous plots finally got in the way of my enjoyment of the strong characters. I stopped believing in it, I think, after Dr Gray somehow got her hand stuck on a bomb that might go off if she let go, while in the OR next door, another doctor's lover was having brain surgery, and then, they realized that all of the oxygen tubes that ran throughout the hospital would ignite if even a small bomb went off, it would start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire hospital. Puh-lease.I have been watching Oh work since she made The Diary of Evelyn Lau for Canadian television. Evelyn Lau ran away from home, and became a drug addict, a prostitute, and a poet and a writer. Out of 1,000 young women who auditioned for the role, Oh got the part, and gave a very memorable performance, so I wasn't surprised to see her turn up again in Sideways, and doing Oh so well.Her character in Sideways is Stephanie, a single mother who works as a bartender in a winery. She is very knowledgeable about wine, and also has a zest for living. Even though she may be a product of the wish fulfillment principle, she was a very real person, who was totally believable. If I met her, I might pinch myself, but there she was.Virginia Madsen, who played Maya, was also fantastic. Her brother, Michael Madsen, played a cold blooded killer who gleefully sliced off a man's ear while rocking out to Stuck in The Middle with You by Stealer's Wheel in Quentin Tarrentino's Reservoir Dogs. I guess acting talent runs in their family, because she was equally convincing in her role as a wine country waitress studying for her Master's degree in Horticulture (I am surprised that Miles didn't pun ""You can lead a horticulture, but you can't make her think"" at that point). She not only feigned attraction to Miles, but also gave an excellent monologue about how much she loved wine, and how she came to realize that she loved wine.  She was too good to be true, but there she was.Alexander Payne did a great job of directing. Repeated viewings constantly reward you with new details and insights into how well the story was paced, how the momentum flowed, how little details were juxtaposed to either counterpoint or enhance the main action. The settings were all so well chosen. California, from Los Angeles to the little wine country towns. The wineries, the Wind Mill motel, the golf courses, The Hitching Post restaurant. There seemed to be a bit of a wind mill motif running through it all, as if they were on a quixotic journey, and The Hitching Post was a foreshadowing of Jack's eminent marriage. One scene in a restaurant with elaborately carved woodwork in the faux Danish town of Solvang was reminiscent of Pinocchio and Lampwick before setting off to Pleasure Island. Another scene was filmed in a run down house that had recently been a meth lab, and was left intact, except for a new door that replaced the one the cops busted down. The cinematography was excellent, with colors that were almost pastel, or depending on the mood, dark and foreboding. Payne takes risks, making Miles and Jack do despicable things, daring you to not care about the characters.Thomas Haden Church has a life that in some ways parallels his character Jack. He is an actor who has appeared in sitcoms, maybe not soap operas, but he was the mechanic Lowell on Wings, and played Ned in Ned and Stacy. Wings wasn't a very good show, but he was someone who really stood out. You just knew that if only he had the right vehicle, he could really shine. Sideways is that vehicle. There are so many great scenes and little touches that make his character come to life. The way he praises the latest draft of Miles' novel, though he obviously hasn't read it. The way he keeps three condoms for himself and gives Miles one when they all end up at Stephanie's after their double date. And then later the next day, takes it back. And for this, he was nominated for an Oscar.Miles is exasperating and pretentious. As they embark on their journey, they stop off to visit Miles' mother. He steals money from her. How can you care about someone who would do that? He is passionate about wine, especially Pinot Noir, and seems sincere and genuine, but is an alcoholic, or at least using wine to escape from his problems--one of them being excessive drinking. Paul Giamatti is perfectly cast in this role. He has the middle aged paunch, the bald spot, the pretentious bohemian goatee, and a flair for physical comedy. He played Harvey Peckar in American Splendor, and has that quirky, awkward, misfit kind of character down. He can go from funny to sad in 60 seconds. There are lots of great scenes and little touches that make his character come to life, like the way he sprinkles his vocabulary with French, does crossword puzzles from the New York Times in pen, and refuses to drink Merlot, because it is too prosaic, too much the worn out clich&eacute;.If Sideways was a bottle of wine instead of a movie, it would be Pinot Noir, not Merlot.",5,"Pinot Noir, Not

A film whose subtle touches, scenes and words stay with you long after you've left the theater. A few serious plot holes in the second half can't cancel out the writing, acting and ""I-know-someone-just-like-that (and sometimes it's me)"" realism of so many of the situations and characters' reactions to them.The location shooting (almost all the wineries and restaurants are referred to by their real names; the Windmill Inn, which in real life is a Days Inn, is one of the few exceptions) adds to both the realism and the ""indie"" feel of the film. Likewise the writers' knowledge of wine is extensive - though it's odd that Miles would shout ""I'm NOT drinking any EFFING Merlot"" when his most prized bottle, a 1961 Cheval Blanc Bordeaux, is 40% Merlot.Obviously the most discussed scene concerns the gorgeous metaphors exchanged by Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Maya (Virginia Madsen) on Stephanie's back porch. Absolutely nobody in the theater exhaled until the cutaway of Miles cursing himself in the bathroom. Here's hoping the Academy will use a strategically-placed bleep to permit what one wit on IMDB called ""The Virginia Monologue"" to be shown in its entirety when they acknowledge Madsen's nomination. Some here have protested that ""people don't really talk like that"", but Maya has an impressive academic resume (a professor's ex-wife who's taking post-graduate courses), and who among us hasn't used a nice buzz as an excuse to make profound pronouncements? (Nobody really says things like ""the problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world"" either....)The plot holes (spoilers):- Jack *had* to know that it was Miles who spilled the beans about the wedding.- Jack's confessional about really loving Christine. If it was on the level, it runs totally counter to the scenes where he raves about Stephanie and considers calling off the wedding. If it was a put-on (remember, Jack's an ACTOR), then the audience was never given the ""wink"" to let us in on the scam.- Miles is built up as the ultimate ""loyal friend"" with a sense of duty, yet as Best Man he abandons the wedding before the reception where he has the obligation to make the toast. This is not only completely out of character, it squanders the tragi-comic possibilities of the reception (Miles + Jack + pregnant ex-wife + alcohol...).But again, the thoughtfulness and performances overcome these annoyances. It's also interesting that a film set entirely in California is so non-Hollywood: the lead is a balding overweight alcoholic with a blanket of back hair, there are no CGI effects, the one car crash goes ""wrong"", and even though there's a lot of sex, neither female lead has a gratuitious topless shot (and trust me, NOBODY is going to do a screen capture of the film's one frontal nudity scene!).",4,The movie itself ages like wine,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,2895,"['2004', 'little', 'film', 'could', 'following', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'film', 'subtle', 'touches', 'scenes', 'words', 'stay', 'long', ""'ve"", 'left', 'theater', 'few', 'serious', 'plot', 'holes', 'second', 'half', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cancel', 'out', 'writing', 'acting', 'I-know-someone-just-like-that', 'realism', 'so', 'many', 'situations', 'characters', 'reactions', 'them.The', 'location', 'shooting', 'almost', 'wineries', 'restaurants', 'are', 'referred', 'real', 'names', 'Windmill', 'Inn', 'real', 'life', 'Days', 'Inn', 'one', 'few', 'exceptions', 'both', 'realism', 'indie', 'feel', 'film', 'Likewise', 'writers', 'knowledge', 'wine', 'extensive', 'odd', 'Miles', 'would', 'shout', ""'m"", 'NOT', 'drinking', 'EFFING', 'Merlot', 'when', 'most', 'prized', 'bottle', '1961', 'Cheval', 'Blanc', 'Bordeaux', '40', '%', 'Merlot.Obviously', 'most', 'discussed', 'scene', 'gorgeous', 'metaphors', 'exchanged', 'Miles', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Maya', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Stephanie', 'back', 'porch', 'Absolutely', 'nobody', 'theater', 'exhaled', 'cutaway', 'Miles', 'cursing', 'bathroom', 'Here', 'hoping', 'Academy', 'will', 'use', 'strategically-placed', 'bleep', 'permit', 'what', 'one', 'wit', 'IMDB', 'called', 'Virginia', 'Monologue', 'be', 'shown', 'entirety', 'when', 'acknowledge', 'Madsen', 'nomination', 'here', 'have', 'protested', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'talk', 'Maya', 'impressive', 'academic', 'resume', 'professor', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'taking', 'post-graduate', 'courses', 'who', ""n't"", 'used', 'nice', 'buzz', 'excuse', 'make', 'profound', 'pronouncements', 'Nobody', 'really', 'things', 'problems', 'three', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'amount', 'hill', 'beans', 'world', 'plot', 'holes', 'spoilers', 'Jack', '*had*', 'know', 'was', 'Miles', 'who', 'spilled', 'beans', 'wedding.-', 'Jack', 'confessional', 'really', 'loving', 'Christine', 'was', 'level', 'totally', 'counter', 'scenes', 'where', 'Stephanie', 'considers', 'calling', 'off', 'wedding', 'was', 'put-on', 'remember', 'Jack', 'ACTOR', 'then', 'audience', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'wink', 'let', 'scam.-', 'Miles', 'built', 'up', 'ultimate', 'loyal', 'friend', 'sense', 'duty', 'yet', 'Best', 'Man', 'wedding', 'reception', 'where', 'obligation', 'make', 'toast', 'not', 'only', 'completely', 'character', 'tragi-comic', 'possibilities', 'reception', 'Miles', '+', 'Jack', '+', 'pregnant', 'ex-wife', '+', 'alcohol', '.But', 'again', 'thoughtfulness', 'overcome', 'annoyances', 'also', 'interesting', 'film', 'set', 'entirely', 'California', 'so', 'non-Hollywood', 'lead', 'balding', 'overweight', 'alcoholic', 'blanket', 'back', 'hair', 'are', 'CGI', 'effects', 'one', 'car', 'crash', 'wrong', 'even', 'lot', 'sex', 'female', 'lead', 'gratuitious', 'topless', 'shot', 'trust', 'NOBODY', 'going', 'do', 'screen', 'capture', 'film', 'one', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'scene']",Sideways (Region 2)

It is a stream of consciousness story, but it has all the elements of a good adventure.The best part about this movie is its reality. Two pre-middle aged guys, one who loves wine and the other who could care less, take a trip from Los Angeles northward to the wineries of the Santa Ynez Valley on the eve of the latter's wedding. They find great wine, good women, and bad situations. Each scene takes place in a real restaurant, winery, or hotel located on California's Central coast. This sense of reality really makes you connect with the characters.Paul Giamatti is classic Paul Giamatti in this movie. He's a neurotic writer who can't get over his ex-wife or his love of wine. These two loves provide the conflict in the story and make for some really funny adventures with his neanderthal-like co-star who also loves women and wine for the totally wrong reasons.As stories go, ""Sideways"" isn't your typical love story or comedy. It's a little of both that reminds you of the relationship between Vince Vaughn and John Favreau in ""Swingers"".If you're looking for a movie with a clear cut introduction, problem and solution - this isn't it.

I'm not sure what they mean--there are lots of funny scenes, but this is the most melancholy comedy I've ever seen.  In fact, I'm not sure the writers/directors would even classify this as a comedy.  The characters are well developed, with two, Sandra Oh and Thomas Haden Church, as the shallow, drop-your-trousers-quickly-while-we're-still-young ones, and two, Giamatti and Madsen, as requiring some time to learn about each other.  Perhaps because Giamatti and Madsen get to explore deeper characters, they can shine more--and they do.The filmmaking is nice, and there are some beautiful views of California's wine country, and some poignant moments.  To me, the most poignant is when Giamatti, near the end of the movie, finds out something about his ex-wife.

888775,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0007RUSGW,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 2]","Sideways was a 2004 sleeper comedy hit by director Alexander Payne that really deserved its plaudits. He previously made the funny Reese Witherspoon comedy Election and the so-so Jack Nicholson film About Schmidt. The film's title comes from the proper way to store a bottle of wine, as well the angle a drunk sees the world from when he's recovering from passing out on the floor. While not a particularly deep film, and at two hours and four minutes in length it is about a half an hour too long, the film nonetheless does provide some insights into male insecurities and mid-life crises, as it celebrates human foibles in an intelligent manner. It was adapted by Payne and Jim Taylor from an unpublished novel by a writer named Rex Pickett, and won a well deserved Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.The film follows in a long tradition of buddy comedies, from the silent era, wherein one guy is a good fellow, and the other is his ne'er do well pal. Basically, a week before the bad pal, his ex-college roommate, Jack (Thomas Haden Church), a failed actor, is to get married, his good pal, Miles (Paul Giamatti), a divorced school teacher of English, and an aspiring novelist, plans to take him on a week's getaway to the California wine country, to relax and play golf.... the film is a ray of hope for viewers who want intelligent films, especially comedies, from someone not named Woody Allen. Payne was quoted as saying, in an online interview: `I want Sideways, which has no movie stars in it, and a movie for which I had final cut, to make money, not just for my own career but for other film makers so that film makers and studios can point, if I didn't have stars to make money, Sideways didn't have a gun or a chase even though that made money, we have to be changing our cinema, little by little and have more human films. But the only way it's going to happen is there are examples they can point to, where they made money. It was just like that in the late 60s and 70s. Look, Easy Rider made money, The Graduate made money, Midnight Cowboy made money, and we should make more movies like those. That's what we need.'He's right, of course. Here's hoping that he has a long career of such hits as Sideways, but that he only gets better with each succeeding film.",4,Good film,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,2275,"['Sideways', 'was', '2004', 'sleeper', 'comedy', 'hit', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'really', 'deserved', 'plaudits', 'previously', 'made', 'funny', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'comedy', 'Election', 'so-so', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'film', 'Schmidt', 'film', 'title', 'proper', 'way', 'store', 'bottle', 'wine', 'as', 'well', 'angle', 'drunk', 'world', 'when', 'recovering', 'passing', 'out', 'floor', 'not', 'particularly', 'deep', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'four', 'minutes', 'length', 'half', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'provide', 'insights', 'male', 'insecurities', 'mid-life', 'crises', 'human', 'foibles', 'intelligent', 'manner', 'was', 'adapted', 'Payne', 'Jim', 'Taylor', 'unpublished', 'novel', 'writer', 'named', 'Rex', 'Pickett', 'won', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay.The', 'film', 'long', 'tradition', 'buddy', 'comedies', 'silent', 'era', 'wherein', 'one', 'guy', 'good', 'fellow', 'other', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'pal', 'Basically', 'week', 'bad', 'pal', 'ex-college', 'roommate', 'Jack', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'failed', 'actor', 'get', 'married', 'good', 'pal', 'Miles', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'divorced', 'school', 'teacher', 'English', 'aspiring', 'novelist', 'take', 'week', 'getaway', 'California', 'wine', 'country', 'relax', 'play', 'golf', 'film', 'ray', 'hope', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'intelligent', 'films', 'especially', 'comedies', 'someone', 'not', 'named', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Payne', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', 'online', 'interview', 'want', 'Sideways', 'movie', 'movie', 'had', 'final', 'cut', 'make', 'money', 'not', 'just', 'own', 'career', 'other', 'film', 'makers', 'so', 'film', 'makers', 'studios', 'can', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'stars', 'make', 'money', 'Sideways', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'gun', 'chase', 'even', 'made', 'money', 'have', 'be', 'changing', 'cinema', 'little', 'little', 'have', 'more', 'human', 'films', 'only', 'way', 'going', 'happen', 'are', 'examples', 'can', 'point', 'where', 'made', 'money', 'was', 'just', 'late', '60s', '70s', 'Look', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'made', 'money', 'Graduate', 'made', 'money', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'made', 'money', 'should', 'make', 'more', 'movies', 'what', 'need', 'right', 'course', 'Here', 'hoping', 'long', 'career', 'such', 'hits', 'Sideways', 'only', 'better', 'succeeding', 'film']",Sideways (Region 2)
888776,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0007RUSGW,Craig MACKINNON,"[7, 10]","Lost in all the hype about Oscar nominations and accusations of overkill is the fact that Sideways is a fun little movie.  It makes no pretention to be anything else.  It is in the style of Bridget Jones (the first one) - two flawed and over-the-top stereotyped guys (in this case) get into situations that lead to comedic results.  What makes the movie good, though, is that the situations and the reactions to them are consistent and grow out of the characters, not because of plot points that must be followed.This is basically a guy's version of a chick flick.  It is probably not a teenager date movie (certainly not for a 1st date).  The audience at which the film is aimed is probably the same as the main characters - slightly balding, slightly pauncy 30-40 year olds (of both sexes).  Okay, only the guys will be slightly balding, but you know what I mean!  The story - two male friends take off on a road trip in a last week of ""freedom"" before one's wedding.  The best man, Miles, thinks this is a good opportunity to introduce his friend to the fine art of oenology (wine tasting), especially since he will be marrying into a socially elite and rich family.  That Miles is an alcoholic using this as an excuse to go drinking is obvious to the audience, but probably not to Miles himself.  The friend, Jack, wants nothing from the alcohol except as a lubricant to get as much single-guy sex in before he's tied down.There's no way around this description, even though it makes the two characters seem like cads.  They are - not only is Miles an alcoholic (and a petulant one at that), he even steals money from his own mother in one scene.  Jack is an amoral compulsive womaniser who cannot be convinced that anonymous sex is cheating on his fiancee.  Similarly, they lie to themselves, each other, and to the women they meet.  Somehow, though, we immediately care for them and like them, knowing objectively that they are inherently unlikeable.  Part of it is the performances by Giamatti and Church, which are very good.  The other part is the direction and the script - they are written just a little bit over-the-top, which allows the audience to relax and forgive them their foibles.  Well, the guys in the audience will, I'm not so sure of the gals.The women in the film are much more realistic and more subtle.  They provide the solid emotional grounding and realism that offsets the insanity revolving around the two guys.  The film is really about relationships - much is said about the wine, but that's incidental.  The movie's hook could have been anything - baseball, environmental activism, or a motorcycle club.  The characters' relations to each other (and, granted, to the object holding it all together, wine) underpins all the events in the film.  There are poignant moments, but most of the time the film is humourous in its observations about the people, and the humour grows naturally from the characters and the inextricable logic they must follow once they get themselves into the situation they are in.On reflection at the end, you know that in the real world, Miles would continue to be an alcoholic and Jack would promptly cheat on his wife.  But this is a pseudo-fantasy world where the people, if they don't quite live happily ever after, at least are better off then when they started.  And we have spent a satisfying and fun 2 hours with the characters, without having been cheated by a cheap and artificially contrived grand resolution.This DVD edition has some interesting tidbits.  The audio commentary by the two stars is fun, if not particularly informative.  There are some cut scenes, which, on seeing them, were rightfully cut.

Miles is depressed and in a mid-life crisis, but do we know why? No. There is no real insight given to the audience as to why he is the way he is. And he's not a very good person, so without understanding the reason behind his motives, we cannot identify with the protagonist. The only thing I knew about Miles is that he is selfish and depressed.Also, I failed to find much humor in Sideways. The situations are sometimes strange and bizarre, but they aren't really funny.

888778,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0007RUSGW,Cubist,"[2, 5]","Payne's last film, About Schmidt, continued his fascination with American cinema in the `70s by featuring one its biggest (and most prolific) stars, Jack Nicholson. His latest movie, Sideways, continues the road movie motif from Schmidt and combines it with the buddy film. Jack (Haden Church) is a failed actor about to be married. He decides to go on one last week of uninhibited fun with his best friend, Miles (Giamatti), a school teacher and struggling author. They go on a wine-tasting tour through California's Central Coast and squeeze in a bit of golfing as well.Jack and Miles are complete messes as human beings. They lack direction and are hypocrites. Miles says he is an author but his book is going nowhere, while Jack is getting married and proceeds to hit on anything in a dress. They are hardly a sympathetic pair. And yet Payne is able to get a good amount of comedic mileage from the pair. An interesting thing happens during the course of the movie. At first, Miles starts off as an unsympathetic character while we warm up to Jack's funny repartee as the charming rogue. Halfway through the film they flip roles and it is Jack who is exposed as a pathetic womanizer and Miles becomes more sympathetic thanks to Maya's (Madsen) influence.Fresh off the success of American Splendor, Paul Giamatti is one of those actors who makes it look so effortless as he inhabits the characters he plays completely. Giamatti is able to tap into his character's deep reservoir of pain and anger and pull out an incredible performance that is, in some ways a variation of his take on the equally acerbic Harvey Pekar in Splendor.Ever since Ned and Stacey, Thomas Haden Church has been an untapped resource and with Sideways he has finally been given the role of his career. As Miles' crass, philandering best friend, he plays Jack as a middle-aged frat boy who still calls women, ""chicks."" Haden Church's deadpanned delivery of smart-ass lines works well against Giamatti's uptight straight man.20th Century Fox's recent DVD release includes a modest collection of supplemental material. There is an audio commentary by actors Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church. As a review in Entertainment Weekly has pointed out, this track is almost a sequel of sorts as Haden Church goes into vintage smart-ass mode while Giamatti plays the straight man and tries to keep things on track by occasionally commenting on what we are seeing. Haden Church then proceeds to deflate this by delivering ironic statements like, ""Also, I love your head in this scene,"" in a deadpan style that is very funny.Also included are seven deleted scenes with written introductions by Payne that explain why they were cut. Most of this footage was rightly excised, including a nasty subplot involving a dog being hit and killed by Miles' car.Rounding out the DVD is a theatrical trailer and a ""Behind-the-Scenes Featurette"" that is pretty standard stuff with clips of Payne and the cast talking about the movie mixed with clips from the movie.",5,An ode to buddy films of the '70s...,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,3019,"['Payne', 'last', 'film', 'Schmidt', 'continued', 'fascination', 'American', 'cinema', '70s', 'featuring', 'one', 'biggest', 'most', 'prolific', 'stars', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'latest', 'movie', 'Sideways', 'road', 'movie', 'motif', 'Schmidt', 'combines', 'buddy', 'film', 'Jack', 'Haden', 'Church', 'failed', 'actor', 'be', 'married', 'go', 'one', 'last', 'week', 'uninhibited', 'fun', 'best', 'friend', 'Miles', 'Giamatti', 'school', 'teacher', 'struggling', 'author', 'go', 'wine-tasting', 'tour', 'California', 'Central', 'Coast', 'squeeze', 'bit', 'golfing', 'well.Jack', 'Miles', 'are', 'complete', 'messes', 'human', 'beings', 'lack', 'direction', 'are', 'hypocrites', 'Miles', 'author', 'book', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Jack', 'getting', 'married', 'proceeds', 'hit', 'anything', 'dress', 'are', 'hardly', 'sympathetic', 'pair', 'yet', 'Payne', 'able', 'get', 'good', 'amount', 'comedic', 'mileage', 'pair', 'interesting', 'thing', 'course', 'movie', 'first', 'Miles', 'off', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'warm', 'up', 'Jack', 'funny', 'repartee', 'charming', 'rogue', 'Halfway', 'film', 'flip', 'roles', 'Jack', 'who', 'exposed', 'pathetic', 'womanizer', 'Miles', 'becomes', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'thanks', 'Maya', 'Madsen', 'influence.Fresh', 'off', 'success', 'American', 'Splendor', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'look', 'so', 'effortless', 'characters', 'completely', 'Giamatti', 'able', 'tap', 'character', 'deep', 'reservoir', 'pain', 'anger', 'pull', 'out', 'incredible', 'performance', 'ways', 'variation', 'take', 'equally', 'acerbic', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'Splendor.Ever', 'Ned', 'Stacey', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'been', 'untapped', 'resource', 'Sideways', 'finally', 'been', 'given', 'role', 'career', 'Miles', 'crass', 'philandering', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'middle-aged', 'frat', 'boy', 'who', 'still', 'women', 'chicks', 'Haden', 'Church', 'deadpanned', 'delivery', 'smart-ass', 'lines', 'well', 'Giamatti', 'uptight', 'straight', 'man.20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'recent', 'DVD', 'release', 'modest', 'collection', 'supplemental', 'material', 'audio', 'commentary', 'actors', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'review', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'pointed', 'out', 'track', 'almost', 'sequel', 'sorts', 'Haden', 'Church', 'vintage', 'smart-ass', 'mode', 'Giamatti', 'straight', 'man', 'tries', 'keep', 'things', 'track', 'occasionally', 'commenting', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'Haden', 'Church', 'then', 'deflate', 'delivering', 'ironic', 'statements', 'Also', 'love', 'head', 'scene', 'deadpan', 'style', 'very', 'funny.Also', 'included', 'are', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'written', 'introductions', 'Payne', 'explain', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'Most', 'footage', 'was', 'rightly', 'excised', 'including', 'nasty', 'subplot', 'involving', 'dog', 'being', 'hit', 'killed', 'Miles', 'car.Rounding', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'Featurette', 'pretty', 'standard', 'stuff', 'clips', 'Payne', 'cast', 'talking', 'movie', 'mixed', 'clips', 'movie']",Sideways (Region 2)

It sounds like a relatively simple-plotted or plodded movie, but it is the screenplay and the acting that makes this movie stands out.Giamatti, in a career defining role, fills in the role of Miles, a failed author and husband, comfortably. With his hang-dog loser looks, he embodies every failing aspect of being middle aged. Jack, on the other hand, seems to have his pathetic dead-end life on a turnaround, with him getting married to a beautiful bride and standing to inherit his father-in-law's business.Miles and Jack heads out for one last chance in their sorry lives to recapture their lost youth in typical ""Animal House"" college manner. With Miles as his reluctant accomplice, we see Jack lusting over a wine pourer (Sandra Oh) and Miles, pondering over Maya (Virginia Madsen in a comeback mode).Ultimately, even though the focus early on is on Jack's hedonistic exploits, it is really about Miles, and his inner journey towards self-reflection and redemption.Even though, the DVD looks great with its green slip cover, the special features were a little tad disappointing.

Jack (Church) is an entertaining actor and is a little sleazy while Miles (Paul Giamatti) is his paranoid friend who thinks the world is caving in on him. Meanwhile, all Jack wants to do is get laid and he wants Miles to help him in this endeavor. Don't worry ladies, most guys aren't like this (but I'm sure a few are). Both play their parts well, however Giamatti does such a good job and is very believable. Church's part isn't nearly as demanding. Miles meets Maya, (the beautiful Virgina Madsen) but he's so wrapped up in his own emotions he can barely even notice her and I'm thinking man, you need to pull yourself out of your hole and do anything you can to get this woman. She would be the best thing that could ever happen to this guy. Well it goes on and Jack gets what he deserves while ruining Miles chances with Maya.

The artsy, deep, hip and high-brow. Films about those people going through a turning point in their lives. Mid-life crisis's and the like. And ones like this in paticular always seem to reap critical praise, a crowd of feverent fans and prestigious award nominations.""Sideways"" strangely has one of those cool quirky titles that sounds really hip and grabs your attention. You know, it'll be an edgy movie. Like ""Entourage,"" ""Purgatory,"" ""Angel Eyes"" and the like. Something about ""Sideways"" says it's going to be different. Smarter. Sharper. In a word, better.But unlike the title for the Johnny Depp-Winona Ryder vehicle ""Finding Neverland,"" this one doesn't pretty much reveal the whole movie in with it's title. ""Sideways"" is about something--more than just moving in a different direction.""Sideways"" uses wine and wine country as a backdrop, yes, but the movie is about more than just the symbolism of wine and it's drinkers. It's essentially about people who are connected and realize how hard, brief and fragile life itself is and pursue happiness by any means necessary. And they're so true and worthy of it, we want them to find it and thus, assure we will find it ourselves. It has the mixed feeling of life.It's stars, Miles Richmond and Jack Lopate have been buddy-buddy since their college dorm years. And have always been (and will be) total polar opposites. Miles is just a sad-sack neurotic nebbish with a bundle of neuroses that seem unwilling to disappear no matter how much therapy or medication he can get his hands on. His book won't get sold, his ex-wife is remarried (not that Miles was happy with her), he seems to be closer to death than life and he hasn't made an iota of the impact he wanted to.Jack's a less-than-successful actor who's most respected credit was a short-lived role on a soap opera years ago. Now his more recent stuff is the voice-over who mumbles the warning for the side effects from non-prescription meds near the end of the commercial. Jack is living an ideal life otherwise and Miles has seen better days. In fact, he's borderline suicidal--taking plenty of meds and alcohol himself, usually all at once. Jack is about to get married. He wants to go out to local wine country and bring Miles with him, and hopefully out of his funk.Miles thinks and feels too much. He's been borderline suicidal for a while now and it's only getting worse. He was unhappy during his marriage which led to him giving his wife the perfect reason to end.Jack is a self-satisfied animal who enjoys giving in to his baser animal instincts. Jack doesn't give so much as a damn about wine that's ""just right."" He only wants a drink. And the movie illustrates how that's exactly who he is. A total tomcat who enjoys being ""on the edge"" and flirting with danger, he sort of enjoys toeing the line. The most outrageous thing about Jack is he often gets off lighter than he should. We all root for Miles and idolize Jack.Maybe a trip out to wine country is just what Miles needs. We all know some big things are about to happen over the course of this one week.One of Miles' true passions that does bring him happiness in wine. The right wine. And with great wine, you have to know what you're talking about. You treat it as an art, as yourself. It's not like any other drug. It becomes a way of like, not only as art and a way of life, but as a way of who you are.Paul Giamatti is simply an actor who never ceases to amaze me. From his breakthrough role as the anal-retentive watchdog station manager in ""Private Parts"" (he was one of the bigger surprises in that movie. The fact that he was passed over for an Oscar nod for this one (as well as ""American Splendor"" and ""Cinderella Man"") borderlines on criminal. On felony.Thomas Hayden Church, who was pretty much just vaguely remembered for his stock idiot second-banana comic relief mechanic character the on the one of the world's most generic sit-com, simply rivets here. He's eons ahead of Lowell and ""Wings.""As Jack, he has the charm of a stud who's about to peak, but doesn't realize and doesn't care. A serial philanderer, he is literally willing to cheat on his fianc&eacute;e without second thought or guilt right before the wedding. He has a womanizer charm that doesn't seem lecherous or arrogant. We don't mind him cheating. In fact, we encourage it. Let's see where his libido might lead him. To pleasure, now, yes. But we all know it'll lead him into a hornet's nest eventually. And we're anxious to see how.When the arrive at their destination, two women come into the picture. A waitress, Maya (Virgina Madsen) and a hostess, (Sandra Oh) come into the picture. We know they're the ones who are going to put everything into play.Sandra Oh, writer-director Payne's then-wife, moves us in a big way as one of the wine hostess who falls for Jack and his animal way. They wind up having a fast relationship and one of the most surprising moments comes when Miles realizes how fast their relationship is going. We know Jack is sticking his pride and joy into a hornet's nest and we want him to, because we know he'll have a blast and we'll do the same just watching. She isn't just a hottie, she has a wild spirit we'd all want to get into.And Virgina Madsen (""The Rainmaker"") plays the kind of angel from above here on Earth, walking as a mortal that Miles seems to have been praying for. And when she's on screen, we all feel that Miles may be finally saved. And is there a chance someone like her will rush down at save us when we really need it?The film owes a lot to the works of Albert Brooks of Woody Allen, where the most effective comedy and drama comes the ordinary plight of the human condition. It's the kind of movie where  you keep thinking, ""Yeah, this is life. This is so exactly true to life... right down to every last detail.""Co-writer-director Alexander Payne (""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"") along with co-writer Rex Pickett (from his own novel) have fashioned their screenplay in a natural true-to-life way all about the fascination of human nature. The ways of ordinary life--laughter, anger, frustration and brain candy--all translate to a cathartic experience for it's little characters as well as it' audience. Composer Rolfe Kent gives ""Sideways"" a light, loose jazzy score. Sometimes rocking. Not unlike the works of Ryan Shore. And Payne not only directs beautifully and passionately, but manages to get the right feel in every frame. We even identify with his slapstick scenes.Like most of the population who saw ""Sideways,"" I was relieved to see that the screenplay managed to walk off with nearly every honor for writing there was: The Oscar, the British Academy Award, the Golden Globe, the Independent Spirit Award, the New York Film Critic Circle Award. And it's cast got it's props as well. Speaking as someone who saw this movie as well as others that came out for '04, yeah.One of those rare and precious years where the Academy actually got it right.NOTE: This review is dedicated in loving memory to my grandfather, Arthur Benzie. He had a lot of Miles in him. A schoolteacher with a passion for the written word--especially the well-written word. Life was harder than for him than most and he always seemed frustrated that society was doing it's best to become intellectually sterile and eager to turn back mankind's long evolutionary process as quickly as possible.It all got to him in a big way. Like Miles, he had a deep passion, an insight. For the highbrow and the savory. The man always appreciated a good drink. And needed it more than he really should have.--To ""Sideways,"" Dane Youssef",5,"A Glorious Vintage.

But they were roommates as college freshmen, and so Miles takes Jack on a tour of California's wine country a week before his wedding in a sort of two-person, weeklong bachelor party of wine-tasting and golf. Miles is a clinically depressed, misanthropic, divorced, alcoholic middle school teacher whose novel has been rejected. He oozes self-hatred and is utterly endearing. Jack is a back-slapping, good looking hunk of a bit-actor who wants to bed a few women before he settles down to marriage. The plot revolves around the two women they meet on their trip, Stephanie and Maya, and the consequences for all involved. Side-splitting humor and deeply human poignancy combine in this travel narrative. I loved Paul Giamatti (Miles) in American Splendor, and he is every bit as good in this film. His character is developed more than Jack's, but perhaps Jack has little character to develop?

888787,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,B0007RUSGW,Daniel Hurley,"[1, 4]","My wife called this the odd couple movie and she is right as two forty something men go off for a lost weekend with contrasting goals. One is a manically depressed teacher and aspiring writer (Giamatti) trying to get over his divorce while the other is a former well known actor (Church) who although he is getting married is determined to have a final fling. The aspiring writer is a wine connoisseur and a bit of a snob who plans their week long escape into wine country where, besides a wine tasting spree, they run into two wonderful independent women. Church plunges into a torrid romance while the depressed Giamatti is for more cautious. Church's charcter goes forward with reckless abandon that culminates into a terrific relationship disaster of large proportions. But of course Church barely escapes to get caught in a virtually worse situation that Giamatti has to help solve. Definitely a dark comedy that has very funny moments and but neither of the two male characters are anything to empathize with but both Madsen and Oh play positive characters and they balance the film.

Jack determined to have one last fling gives this vacation a more problematic twist.  Miles is a wine expert, and he intises this hobby as he meets a local waitress who he has seen time by time.  Little do Miles and Jack know is that how their female finds will affect them in the next few days and even their lifetimes.  This becomes more than just a journey.  This is a journey of them finding themselves and why their lives are so dramatic.""Sideways"" proceeded to win several awards, including two Golden Globes and one Oscar.  It stars Paul Giamotti (""American Splender""), Thomas Haden Church (TV's ""Wings""), Virginia Madsen (""Candyman""), and Sandra Oh (TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"").  This film was well adapted from the book version with its soft-headed humor with a dramatic twist.  This unique storyline combines love, reflection, and alcohol finely.  It contains the style that of old-fashioned journey films and modernizes it with the alcohol hobbies.  This technique combines well with all of the themes and turn of events.  This allows the characters to have a motive to bond so well instead of just cause.  Therefore, this comedy is not just an action comedy; this is a thematic comedy.Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen make terrific comebacks in this film in their Oscar and Golden Globe nominated roles (both supporting performances).  Not just did they make comebacks; they performed the best roles in their careers.  Paul Giomatti proves his acting capabilities with the second consecutive outstanding performance in a film (the first being ""American Splender"").  His performance notes the overall film theme the truest.  Though Sandra Oh didn't receive many award nominations for this film, she still gave great essence to it like her fellow cast members.Such film quality gives ""Sideways"" the worthiness for becoming a classic in the following years.

The first time without the commentary on so you can appreciate the terrific jazz score by Rolfe Kent that terrifically underscores the action on the screen.  Criminally, Kent's score was not even nominated for an Oscar.  The commentary track by the film's stars Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church is indispensible and not to be missed.  This pair have infinite clever bon mots about the action on the screen and the making of the film.  As for the film itself it is a humorous account of two college buddies, one depressive the other libidinous, who go on an extended bachelor party through California wine country.  In the process they learn about life, love, themselves, some of it painful, some of it wickedly hilarious.  Director Alexander Payne with this film and his previous comic masterworks, ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"" continues to rise to the upper echelon of American filmmakers.  We can thank him for advancing the careers here of Paul Giamatti, star of last year's brilliant ""American Splendor"", Thomas Haden Church, best known for his work in sitcoms, ""Wings"" and ""Ned and Stacey"".  Particular mention should be made of his utilization of Virginia Madsen as Maya, the waitress that captures the heart of Giamatti's character, Miles.  Madsen had fallen from grace with the powers-that-be in Hollywood even though she delivered solid work in movies as diverse as the horror film ""Candyman"" and Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of John Grisham's ""The Rainmaker"".

Having said that, I finely decided to rent it and take a look at the hype. I must said I was pleasantly surprised, and found it to be a highly intellectual film.I do think that this film might be lost on non creative working people. Meaning if you have not been involved in the arts, acting, writing novels, photography, painting, dancing.......then you may not understand the struggles of the two main characters. Those two guys remind me so much of the type of people you meet in the world of the Arts. Meaning that the highs are high and the lows are low. Most of them are selfish and very weak people, as we will see with the two main characters.I found 80% of the script to be spot on, and very realistic. The subject of wine was actually interesting, and I find wine info to be about as exciting as watching paint dry. But this storyteller did an outstanding job. There are moments where the dialogue is outstanding. When actress Virginia Madsen talks about why she got into wine, I was blown away. Very intense and impressive performance. However he and Giamatti being a pair just does not strike me as real. Ok, well it takes place in California so anything is possible!What I find to be most impressive about this movie, is the fact that it is an accurate portrait of life in general. It just so happens that a wild number of things occur in a few days in the film. But if you stretch that out in your own life, you'll find that we all go through things like this. So the message to me if you find this film confusing is to really ""look before you leap,"" in the decisions you make with your life.I do not consider this film to be a comedy, it has funny moments to be sure. I consider it a drama, that is very serious. I do not wish to refer to it as a chick flick, but there are moments when it comes close. I think I would call it a life lesson film. So if you want insight into your own life and how to relate that to others, then I think this film might offer you a gaze into that world.",4,"Life is sweet, bitter, funny and stupid",1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,2100,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'admittedly', 'was', 'very', 'hesitant', 'too', 'watch', 'first', 'place', 'Having', 'said', 'finely', 'decided', 'rent', 'take', 'look', 'hype', 'must', 'said', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'found', 'be', 'highly', 'intellectual', 'film.I', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'lost', 'non', 'creative', 'working', 'people', 'Meaning', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'involved', 'arts', 'acting', 'writing', 'novels', 'photography', 'painting', 'dancing', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'struggles', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'two', 'guys', 'remind', 'so', 'much', 'type', 'people', 'meet', 'world', 'Arts', 'Meaning', 'highs', 'are', 'high', 'lows', 'are', 'low', 'Most', 'are', 'selfish', 'very', 'weak', 'people', 'will', 'see', 'two', 'main', 'characters.I', 'found', '80', '%', 'script', 'be', 'spot', 'very', 'realistic', 'subject', 'wine', 'was', 'actually', 'interesting', 'find', 'wine', 'info', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'exciting', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'storyteller', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'dialogue', 'outstanding', 'When', 'actress', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'talks', 'why', 'got', 'wine', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Very', 'intense', 'impressive', 'performance', 'However', 'Giamatti', 'being', 'pair', 'just', 'not', 'strike', 'real', 'Ok', 'well', 'place', 'California', 'anything', 'possible', 'What', 'find', 'be', 'most', 'impressive', 'movie', 'fact', 'accurate', 'portrait', 'life', 'general', 'just', 'so', 'wild', 'number', 'things', 'occur', 'few', 'days', 'film', 'stretch', 'out', 'own', 'life', ""'ll"", 'find', 'go', 'things', 'message', 'find', 'film', 'confusing', 'really', 'look', 'leap', 'decisions', 'make', 'life.I', 'do', 'not', 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'comedy', 'funny', 'moments', 'be', 'sure', 'consider', 'drama', 'very', 'serious', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'refer', 'chick', 'flick', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'close', 'think', 'would', 'call', 'life', 'lesson', 'film', 'So', 'want', 'insight', 'own', 'life', 'how', 'relate', 'others', 'then', 'think', 'film', 'might', 'offer', 'gaze', 'world']",Sideways (Region 2)

888801,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B0007RUSGW,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[2, 8]","When a low-budget, independent film like ""Sideways"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" gains a wider audience, the accompanying hype always ruins the pleasure of discovery; if you come to it too late, you are often disappointed.  And so it was for me with ""Sideways."" This buddy story of two unmarried men (one newly divorced and one about to be married for the first time) who spend a bachelor-party week in California wine country is competent and smoothly written/acted, but it lacks the pizzazz of a memorable movie.  This film is enjoyable and often funny, but also somewhat predictable.Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) have been friends since college, and they are dedicated friends despite being caught in their own personal dramas.  Miles, a whiney middle school English teacher, is mourning his divorce and hoping that his 750 page novel will be published.  Jack is a former soap opera star now relegated to commercial voice-overs who is about to get married to an Armenian beauty; Jack isn't sure about settling down, so he wants to sleep with as many women as will have him.  Miles knows everything about wine (at least, he thinks he does), and Jack knows nothing and is barely willing to learn.  The two men meet up with Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh), two wine-loving friends who are as different from each other as the guys are.Sandra Oh, in the smallest part of the four, steals the show with her luminous, sexy, no-nonsense characterization of Stephanie.  Giamatti's Miles grows on the viewer despite the pathetic and not always sympathetic nature of his character; the changes in Miles form the core of the film. Madsen doesn't get enough screen time, especially since her seductive monologue about ""living wine"" is riveting.  Church, on the other hand, plays a jerk, and it's difficult to do much with that kind of role.The film turns on wine, particularly the delicacy of pinot noir, and the wine talk makes the film incredibly pretentious at times. If not for the sweetness of true love and friendship, the movie could have become mired in self-importance. Ironically, Jack's ignorance keeps the tone light and saves the movie from its own snobbishness.  It is Jack's stupidity and single-mindedness that moves everything forward.This film is worth watching for the performances as it is more character- than plot-driven.  As long as you don't expect too much, you'll enjoy this film that melds male bonding with romantic comedy, thus appealing to both genders. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4,A Buddy Movie in California Wine Country,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,2540,"['When', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'Sideways', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'gains', 'wider', 'audience', 'accompanying', 'hype', 'always', 'pleasure', 'discovery', 'come', 'too', 'late', 'are', 'often', 'disappointed', 'was', 'Sideways', 'buddy', 'story', 'two', 'unmarried', 'men', 'one', 'newly', 'divorced', 'one', 'about', 'be', 'married', 'first', 'time', 'who', 'spend', 'bachelor-party', 'week', 'California', 'wine', 'country', 'competent', 'smoothly', 'written/acted', 'pizzazz', 'memorable', 'movie', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'often', 'funny', 'also', 'somewhat', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Jack', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'college', 'are', 'dedicated', 'friends', 'being', 'caught', 'own', 'personal', 'dramas', 'Miles', 'whiney', 'middle', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'mourning', 'divorce', 'hoping', '750', 'page', 'novel', 'will', 'be', 'published', 'Jack', 'former', 'soap', 'opera', 'star', 'now', 'relegated', 'commercial', 'voice-overs', 'who', 'get', 'married', 'Armenian', 'beauty', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'sure', 'settling', 'down', 'sleep', 'as', 'many', 'women', 'will', 'have', 'Miles', 'everything', 'wine', 'least', 'Jack', 'nothing', 'barely', 'willing', 'learn', 'two', 'men', 'meet', 'up', 'Maya', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Stephanie', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'two', 'wine-loving', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'other', 'guys', 'are.Sandra', 'Oh', 'smallest', 'part', 'four', 'show', 'luminous', 'sexy', 'no-nonsense', 'characterization', 'Stephanie', 'Giamatti', 'Miles', 'viewer', 'pathetic', 'not', 'always', 'sympathetic', 'nature', 'character', 'changes', 'Miles', 'form', 'core', 'film', 'Madsen', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'especially', 'seductive', 'monologue', 'living', 'wine', 'riveting', 'Church', 'other', 'hand', 'jerk', 'difficult', 'do', 'much', 'kind', 'role.The', 'film', 'wine', 'particularly', 'delicacy', 'pinot', 'noir', 'wine', 'talk', 'film', 'incredibly', 'pretentious', 'times', 'not', 'sweetness', 'true', 'love', 'friendship', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'mired', 'self-importance', 'Ironically', 'Jack', 'ignorance', 'tone', 'light', 'movie', 'own', 'snobbishness', 'Jack', 'stupidity', 'single-mindedness', 'everything', 'forward.This', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'performances', 'more', 'character-', 'plot-driven', 'As', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'male', 'bonding', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'thus', 'appealing', 'genders', 'Debbie', 'Lee', 'Wesselmann']",Sideways (Region 2)

Suddenly, though, Germany seems ever so much more interesting ...The problems with the film start in the first line of dialogue, in the first scene, where we see that the central character of the film is an habitual liar - you know, the stupid kinds of lies people make as excuses?  A little later we see this 40-ish character make an unannounced visit to his aging mother, ostensibly as a birthday surprise, but in reality to steal money from her.  In many movies this kind of incident is a set-up scene for later events - one might expect that before the end of the film he would have a growth moment, return the money, make apologies, etc., etc., and become a better person. But no, not so much.  Not in this film.The other male character is not as sympathetic.  He merely decides to decieve a single mother for a week of sex as a prelude to marriage to his fiancee.The film follows this nebish guy and his lounge-lizard-Larry friend as they proceed from vinyard to vinyard - one wine commercial after another, in effect.Altough the film never says so (is it in denial?) the central character is pretty clearly an alcoholic, and one can understand from his phone call to his former wife that his over-indulgence in the fruit of the grape may have been a factor in their divorce.  So the movie then details his attraction to another woman eminently suited to enabling his alcoholism.  His friend has problems with a sex drive that needs therapy and all sorts of problems with honesty and trustworthiness.The movie is supposed to be a (romantic?) comedy.It is diverting.  The scenery isn't bad to look at.  There are worse movies, definitely.The comedy, and the script generally, is pretty lame - rather like a guy who has had too much to drink and can't, ... well, ... you know...",3,2 hour California Wine-growers' Commercial,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,2091,"['somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'more', 'anything', 'else', '2', 'hour', 'commercial', 'vintners', 'California', 'particular', 'north', 'Santa', 'Barbara.The', 'irony', 'were', 'thinking', 'going', 'wine', 'tour', 'vacation', 'California', 'watched', 'movie', 'heighten', 'interest', 'Suddenly', 'Germany', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'problems', 'film', 'start', 'first', 'line', 'dialogue', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'central', 'character', 'film', 'habitual', 'liar', 'know', 'stupid', 'kinds', 'lies', 'people', 'make', 'excuses', 'little', 'later', 'see', '40-ish', 'character', 'make', 'unannounced', 'visit', 'aging', 'mother', 'ostensibly', 'birthday', 'surprise', 'reality', 'steal', 'money', 'many', 'movies', 'kind', 'incident', 'set-up', 'scene', 'later', 'events', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'end', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'growth', 'moment', 'return', 'money', 'make', 'apologies', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Not', 'film.The', 'other', 'male', 'character', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'merely', 'decieve', 'single', 'mother', 'week', 'sex', 'prelude', 'marriage', 'fiancee.The', 'film', 'nebish', 'guy', 'lounge-lizard-Larry', 'friend', 'proceed', 'vinyard', 'vinyard', 'one', 'wine', 'commercial', 'film', 'never', 'so', 'denial', 'central', 'character', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'alcoholic', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'phone', 'call', 'former', 'wife', 'over-indulgence', 'fruit', 'grape', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'factor', 'divorce', 'movie', 'then', 'details', 'attraction', 'woman', 'eminently', 'suited', 'enabling', 'alcoholism', 'friend', 'problems', 'sex', 'drive', 'therapy', 'sorts', 'problems', 'honesty', 'trustworthiness.The', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'romantic', 'comedy.It', 'diverting', 'scenery', ""n't"", 'bad', 'look', 'are', 'worse', 'movies', 'definitely.The', 'comedy', 'script', 'generally', 'pretty', 'lame', 'rather', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'ca', ""n't"", 'well', 'know']",Sideways (Region 2)
888803,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0007RUSGW,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 6]","I was a little surprised to see this billed as a comedy.  Not that I didn't experience many wry grins, tickling chuckles, and some outright belly laughs as I watched it.  I did.  And it is a whole lot funnier than most movies that are supposed to be comedies.  But this is not a comedy, per se.  It is a relationship movie.  It is a buddy movie.  It is a brilliant tour de force by Alexander Payne, who along with Jim Taylor wrote the script, and who directed, based on the novel by Rex Pickett.  On the basis of seeing two of his movies, this and Election (1999) I can say without the slightest doubt, Payne is one very talented man who has Hollywood by the proverbials.Both the script and the direction were superb.  One might say Payne spent a little too much time developing character, but when you see the result, you have to say, it was worth it.  Yes, the movie begins a little slowly, just a little.  Everything seems a little on the ordinary side.  There is not much happening.  We can see that Miles is one of life's losers and that his best bud Jack is one of life's lucky guys.  They are off to the wine country for one last buddy time together before Jack gets married.Jack is a sometime, somewhat talented actor.  God, I knew a few of those guys.  And Miles is a talented but somehow failed writer, a school teacher who has penned a 750-page novel.  Oh, Lord let me buy you a Mercedes Benz.  (Sorry that lyric just slipped in.)  He also reminds me of someone.Miles recently (two years ago actually) got dumped by the true love of his life, his now ex-wife Victoria.  And Jack, bless his heart, is about to marry a very well appointed and very nice looking young woman who lives in a grand house in Palos Verdes (in the script; in the movie it's more like BelAir or thereabouts--which amount to about the same thing).  And so off the two go for wine and golf and the open road.  But be back by Friday night for the rehearsal.  (I'll say no more about that, but keep the word ""rehearsal"" in mind.  Those who have seen the movie know what I mean.)All right I confess.  This movie hit home with me.  I have been there and done that in a number of ways.  In fact, the familiarity kind of put me off at the beginning.  I mean, I have been to France and I have drunk Chateau Cheval Blanc, and to be honest I have also drunk great burgundies with (God help us) fast food, although unlike Miles I took the food home; I wouldn't de-sanctify the wine by drinking it on the sly at a diner.  By the way, Cheval Blanc is NOT a burgundy and it not made with Pinot Noir grapes.  It is a red wine from Bordeaux made with Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapes.And I and a buddy dated two young women many years ago and almost the same thing happened.  But never mind.In other words, the movie is realistic, so much so that I suspect a lot of viewers will find something in it that relates directly and even spookily to their own lives.  Watch it and see.Can you be too realistic?  Can a movie be so absolutely true to life that it...what?  Loses something?  Is too painful?  Is too prosaic?  Well, I almost thought that in the beginning.  But the movie is so well planned, so well contrived (if you will) so aggressively true to life and honest about human nature that I came within a hair breath of turning it off.Don't you do that!  Don't give up on this movie!  It is craftily planned to reward the viewer with a most interesting and enjoyable movie experience.  This is not to say it is perfect.  Some of the wine dialogue is compromised because what is said must make sense to the general viewer while at the same time remain true (almost) to what afficionados of wine would actually say.  And yes, Payne could have cut to the chase a little quicker.  But sometimes the appetite is whetted when the meal is delayed.In addition to a brilliant script and some very fine direction from Payne, the movie is blessed with some excellent casting.  Paul Giamatti is perfect as Miles, who really is not a loser.  Thomas Haden Church is exactly right as the attractive and confident, every-hustling, womanizing, marginal actor who will get his comeuppance in the next life, not in this one.  Sandra Oh provides a perfect fit as the Asian-American who falls heavily for American men who are not necessarily of Asian descent; and Virginia Madsen keeps just enough of her beauty hidden to be believable as the waitress with a head on her shoulders.I guess I could give Hollywood the ultimate compliment and say that this movie is so slick that it doesn't seem in the slightest bit slick.  That it is so realistic that one never thinks for a moment that it is contrived.  To paraphrase somebody, the essence of the art of story, whether it be a novel, a short story or a movie, is in believable characters in believable situations doing the things we all do, but in a way that goes beyond realism to artistry.  If you can fake that you can make it big not only in Hollywood but anywhere there is an audience, a viewer, a reader, anybody who seeks to be enlightened and entertained and experience the catharsis that art can bring.See this for director Alexander Payne who knows what he is doing at all times.",5,"Clever, very clever",1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,5189,"['was', 'little', 'surprised', 'see',

Alexander Payne's direction is bland, and the script is often too melodramatic and cute.  There is also one completely unnecessary and just plain bad scene: the one in which Jack (Thomas H. Church), who's a sex addict, gets in trouble and loses his wallet, which his buddy Miles (Paul Giamatti) has to retrieve for him.  On the positive side, ""Sideways"" is a pleasure to watch for Giamatti's and Virginia Madsen's (Maya) performances.  These are characters we can like, and they have true chemistry.  Church and Sandra Oh (Stephanie) are also very good, but I would have liked more screen time for Oh's character, and more exploration of the lives of Maya and Stephanie.  The concept of male bonding that might lead to the elusive goal of men growing up, set against the backdrop of a winery tour, isn't bad, but Jack and Miles aren't always incredibly interesting.

It works as a date movie and as a solitary adventure. With humor and sadness, Sideways tracks two men on a last tango in Napa as they guzzle the grape extract, golf and find love and romance.

For those of you who seem to especially loath this movie ( and you know who you are! ) you may wish to stop reading here as I have no intention of damning "" Sideways "" with faint praise. Let the accolades begin!A good starting off point might very well be that many film-goers fully expected "" Sideways "" to be little more then a flat-out comedy. Rather a ' boys adventure ' with beautiful scenery and a few healthy guffaws as we watch the misadventures of Miles and Jack all wrapped up with a nice and tidy predictable Hollywood ending. If that was indeed your expectations when viewing this film then you truly were in for a huge disappointment. "" Sideways "" encompasses not just comedy ( and an extremely black comedy at that! ) but also a healthy dose of drama with a sprinkle of suspense thrown in. Miles, played by the remarkable Paul Giammatti, portraying a teacher/writer ( unpublished at that! ) who is essentially an 'everyman' who when it comes to life is the perennial sad sack. He's simply a man who goes thru life with his tail between his legs and fully expects life to hit him square in the face at every juncture. Miles is portrayed not as a sympathetic character and that is important to remember. He's self-absorbed and when at first we are introduced to him it doesn't take long for us to have ambivalent feelings about our protagonist. But there are several issues which are key here...1) is that most men can identify with a character such as this as life continues to throw things at us that we are ill prepared for. Miles is not unlike you and me and I suspect many of thse who dislike this movie are perhaps uncomfortable with that fact. Miles is the perennial downer who never got to go to the prom, never achieved success in his chosen field and whose history with women is little more then one disastrous relationship after yet another. Its not a character that deserves much empathy from the viewer but it is one in which we can, at one time or another, certainly identify with. If not then you have most definitely lead a charmed life! 2) Is that like many of us Miles secretly seeks redemption in the oddest of places. For most men it might the love of a good woman. But for Miles not only is he searching for his 'soul mate' ( I hate that term but it fits so what the heck! ) but he also finds solace and comfort in his one true passion. That of course being a good bottle of wine. The wine acts as a metaphor for what Miles truly believes in and it creates a certain nurturing aspect that is missing from his hum-drum existence.What truly, for me at least, turned this film from being simply good to arguably a great movie experience is that as "" Sideways "" developes we unknowlingly turn a sympathetic eye toward Miles and ultimately by the end of the movie are cheering him on and crossing our fingers for our very own 'happy ending.' What director Alexander Payne does so effectively is to let his characters develope at their very own pace, knowing full well that as more and more of Miles character is revealed the audience will begin to understand and empathize with his faults and liabilities. That is key in a movie such as this and if one walks into the theatre, watches the character and passes a quick value judgement without any sense of compassion and understanding then in the case of "" Sideways "" your expereince will be a disappointing one. But as a viewer we stay with Miles, learn form his odd sense of narcissism and begin to care then as a movie-going experience our lives will be enriched ten-fold. I know mine was!Overall, "" Sideways "" is a movie with many layers and dimensions. Some truly inspired comedic moments i.e. Jack and Miles purposefully wrecking Miles car so as to help convince Jacks soon-to-be-bride of the fictitious story in order to help his friend out of yet another predicament. Yet there are some terribly moving episodes as well such as Miles and his recently divorced waitress/friend Virginia Madsen explaining to the other as to their heart-felt devotion to wine. Its moments like these that makes "" Sideways "" a movie that like a fine bottle of wine ( and no Merlot please! ) simply gets better and more fully appreciated with the passing of time.",5,All Too Human,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,4576,"['generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'point', 'responding', 'previous', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'critiques', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'how', 'so', 'loved', 'Sideways', 'feel', 'over-whelming', 'need', 'throw', 'two', 'cents', 'regarding', 'magnificent', 'film', 'question', 'venom', 'mixed', 'particular', 'brand', 'animosity', 'many', 'critics', 'here', 'have', 'heaped', 'film', 'who', 'seem', 'especially', 'loath', 'movie', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'may', 'wish', 'stop', 'reading', 'here', 'have', 'intention', 'damning', 'faint', 'praise', 'Let', 'accolades', 'begin', 'good', 'starting', 'off', 'point', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'many', 'film-goers', 'fully', 'expected', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'then', 'flat-out', 'comedy', 'boys', 'adventure', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'few', 'healthy', 'guffaws', 'watch', 'misadventures', 'Miles', 'Jack', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nice', 'tidy', 'predictable', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'was', 'indeed', 'expectations', 'when', 'viewing', 'film', 'then', 'truly', 'were', 'huge', 'disappointment.', 'not', 'just', 'comedy', 'extremely', 'black', 'comedy', 'also', 'healthy', 'dose', 'drama', 'sprinkle', 'suspense', 'thrown', 'Miles', 'played', 'remarkable', 'Paul', 'Giammatti', 'portraying', 'teacher/writer', 'unpublished', 'who', 'essentially', ""'everyman"", 'who', 'when', 'life', 'perennial', 'sad', 'sack', 'simply', 'man', 'who', 'thru', 'life', 'tail', 'legs', 'fully', 'life', 'hit', 'square', 'face', 'juncture', 'Miles', 'portrayed', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'important', 'remember', 'self-absorbed', 'when', 'first', 'are', 'introduced', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'have', 'ambivalent', 'feelings', 'protagonist', 'are', 'several', 'issues', 'are', 'key', 'here', '1', 'most', 'men', 'can', 'identify', 'character', 'such', 'life', 'throw', 'things', 'are', 'ill', 'prepared', 'Miles', 'not', 'suspect', 'many', 'thse', 'who', 'dislike', 'movie', 'are', 'perhaps', 'uncomfortable', 'fact', 'Miles', 'perennial', 'downer', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'go', 'prom', 'never', 'achieved', 'success', 'chosen', 'field', 'history', 'women', 'little', 'more', 'then', 'one', 'disastrous', 'relationship', 'yet', 'not', 'character', 'much', 'empathy', 'viewer', 'one', 'can', 'one', 'time', 'certainly', 'not', 'then', 'have', 'most', 'definitely', 'lead', 'charmed', 'life', '2', 'many', 'Miles', 'secretly', 'redemption', 'oddest', 'places', 'most', 'men', 'might', 'love', 'good', 'woman', 'Miles', 'not', 'only', 'searching', ""'soul"", 'mate', 'hate', 'term', 'so', 'what', 'heck', 'also', 'solace', 'comfort', 'one', 'true', 'passion', 'course', 'being', 'good', 'bottle', 'wine', 'wine', 'acts', 'metaphor', 'what', 'Miles', 'truly', 'certain', 'nurturing', 'aspect', 'missing', 'hum-drum', 'truly', 'least', 'turned', 'film', 'being', 'simply', 'good', 'arguably', 'great', 'movie', 'experience', 'Sideways', 'unknowlingly', 'turn', 'sympathetic', 'eye', 'Miles', 'ultimately', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'cheering', 'crossing', 'fingers', 'very', 'own', ""'happy"", 'ending', 'What', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'so', 'effectively', 'let', 'characters', 'develope', 'very', 'own', 'pace', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'more', 'more', 'Miles', 'character', 'revealed', 'audience', 'will', 'begin', 'understand', 'empathize', 'faults', 'liabilities', 'key', 'movie', 'such', 'one', 'theatre', 'character', 'quick', 'value', 'judgement', 'sense', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'then', 'case', 'Sideways', 'expereince', 'will', 'be', 'disappointing', 'one', 'viewer', 'stay', 'Miles', 'learn', 'form', 'odd', 'sense', 'narcissism', 'begin', 'care', 'then', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'lives', 'will', 'be', 'enriched', 'ten-fold', 'know', 'mine', 'was', 'Overall', 'Sideways', 'movie', 'many', 'layers', 'dimensions', 'truly', 'inspired', 'comedic', 'moments', 'i.e', 'Jack', 'Miles', 'purposefully', 'wrecking', 'Miles', 'car', 'so', 'help', 'convince', 'Jacks', 'soon-to-be-bride', 'fictitious', 'story', 'order', 'help', 'friend', 'yet', 'predicament', 'are', 'terribly', 'moving', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'Miles', 'recently', 'divorced', 'waitress/friend', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'explaining', 'other', 'heart-felt', 'devotion', 'wine', 'moments', 'Sideways', 'movie', 'fine', 'bottle', 'wine', 'Merlot', 'please', 'simply', 'better', 'more', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'passing', 'time']",Sideways (Region 2)

888813,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0007RUSGW,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 7]","In director/co-screenwriter Alexander Payne's hands, the buddy picture takes on deeper shades of complexity and vulnerability. Adapting Rex Pickett's2004 novelwith Jim Taylor, Payne continues on the particularly idiosyncratic filmmaking path that he started with the hilariously acidicCitizen RuthandElectionand seemed to deepen with the meanderingAbout Schmidt. The premise of this 2004 film sounds flimsy on the surface - two guys, one about to get married, take a week-long trip through the Santa Barbara wine country as a last hurrah celebration filled with fine wine, good food and golf. But the execution of this plot is full of shrewd observations and so many delightfully unexpected scenes that seem like non-sequiturs at first but somehow mesh into a story that keeps you guessing what will come next. It's a fascinating journey, often hysterical, sometimes painful, about lost opportunities and facing one's deep-seeded fears.The characters are familiar and unpredictable at the same time, and the actors inhabiting them are terrific. In a relatively understated, finely detailed performance, Paul Giamatti provides the emotional core of the story as put-upon, unrelentingly dissatisfied Miles, the pinot wine aficionado so caught up in his passion for the grape he has no idea how pretentious he sounds. His character's aching, post-divorce vulnerability and decreased sense of worth wring truthfully through his hound dog expressions, excessive drinking and pained fits of anger. A failing novelist and quite likely an alcoholic, Miles hides behind his extensive wine knowledge to avoid getting hurt again even when confronted by a beautiful woman open to the possibility of starting a relationship with him. After years of medium-level success in TV sitcoms, Thomas Haden Church makes the ideal comic foil as Jack, a has-been soap star and self-proclaimed ladies' man who is not nearly ready to face commitment at the altar.The two actors have an easy and sometimes tense rapport as best friends with opposite approaches to life but a strong sense of devotion to each other. Their wine tasting scenes with a liberal use of jargon, in particular, are hilarious in that only-in-California sort of way. Of course, women complicate the journey. Sandra Oh shows surprising female swagger as wine pourer Stephanie, who blindly falls for all of Jack's lines. And it's gratifying to see Virginia Madsen make the most of a good role. This beautiful, searingly intelligent actress had been kicking around bad potboilers and horror flicks for over two decades, and it's about time someone saved her from Lifetime TV-movie hell. She plays the smart, wine-worshipping waitress Maya with lovely subtlety and has a wonderfully transfixing, wine-as-life monologue that makes Miles look all the more foolish for not capitalizing on the moment.But like a wine that peaks and fades, as she seductively describes, so does Miles in fits of depression that make his search for love and fulfillment an evasive proposition at best. The 2005 DVD package provides a wonderfully hilarious commentary track courtesy of the improvisational wit of Giamatti and especially Church, who seems to be a treasure trove of erudite trivia. Make sure to have the English subtitle feature on as they talk non-stop over the film. Their natural chemistry is unforced off-screen. Eight deleted scenes are included with Payne's written descriptions of what function they served and why they were ultimate excised.

It had nothing to do with the acting, I love the four main actors and their work was stellar but it was the story that sucked big time. First off let&#8217;s be honest, if you identify with this film you are a sad, sad individual. In fact if you weren&#8217;t a little repulsed by the actions of the two male stars you seriously have zero standards in your life. Perhaps that is why I didn&#8217;t like the film, I wouldn&#8217;t associate with Cretans like this and to be totally honest I have never met anyone that is this pathetic so the film loses out on the believability scale.I love good stories and unbelievable charcters and science fiction but that was the problem, the film tried to portray this a real-life scenario. And while I don&#8217;t doubt that there are losers like this, they usually appear on Jerry Springer for all of us to gawk.To those who call this a buddy flick, you completely missed the fact that Jack and Miles don&#8217;t like each other very much. I find it amazing reading other people&#8217;s reviews who don&#8217;t see this and think they are in fact true friends.  The movie went to great lengths to show that they are only together because it seems no one else would be friends with these consummate losers in life.If you think this is a wine flick then you have almost zero knowledge of wine. Personally I think all of the wine faux pas were the writers attempt at making fun of the audience who want to be as pretentious as Miles without having any knowledge of what they are talking about. It also pokes funs at Miles who values intelligence over anything else but shows that he actually is not as bright as he thinks while Jack who doesn&#8217;t give a damn about IQ is actually the more intelligent one, albeit the more slimy one.The bottom line is if you are identifying with this film or claiming that you know Jack or Miles you need some serious help. This film is about the pathetic losers in life and how they can make almost everyone miserable around them. If this sort of thing appeals to you than enjoy, as for me I will give it a pass.",1,"Sad, Really Sad",1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,2182,"['8217', 'rare', 'walk', 'movie', 'Sideways', 'prompted', 'leave', 'get', 'refund', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'acting', 'love', 'four', 'main', 'actors', 'work', 'was', 'stellar', 'was', 'story', 'sucked', 'big', 'time', 'First', 'let', '8217', 'be', 'honest', 'identify', 'film', 'are', 'sad', 'sad', 'individual', 'fact', 'weren', '8217', 't', 'little', 'repulsed', 'actions', 'two', 'male', 'stars', 'seriously', 'have', 'zero', 'standards', 'life', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'didn', '8217', 'film', 'wouldn', '8217', 'associate', 'Cretans', 'be', 'totally', 'honest', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'anyone', 'pathetic', 'film', 'out', 'believability', 'scale.I', 'love', 'good', 'stories', 'unbelievable', 'charcters', 'science', 'fiction', 'was', 'problem', 'film', 'tried', 'portray', 'real-life', 'scenario', 'don', '8217', 'doubt', 'are', 'losers', 'usually', 'appear', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'gawk.To', 'who', 'call', 'buddy', 'flick', 'completely', 'missed', 'fact', 'Jack', 'Miles', 'don', '8217', 'other', 'very', 'much', 'find', 'amazing', 'reading', 'other', 'people', '8217', 's', 'reviews', 'who', 'don', '8217', 'see', 'think', 'are', 'fact', 'true', 'friends', 'movie', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'show', 'are', 'only', 'together', 'one', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'friends', 'consummate', 'losers', 'life.If', 'think', 'wine', 'flick', 'then', 'have', 'almost', 'zero', 'knowledge', 'wine', 'Personally', 'think', 'wine', 'faux', 'pas', 'were', 'writers', 'attempt', 'making', 'fun', 'audience', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'as', 'pretentious', 'Miles', 'having', 'knowledge', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'also', 'funs', 'Miles', 'who', 'intelligence', 'anything', 'else', 'actually', 'not', 'as', 'bright', 'Jack', 'who', 'doesn', '8217', 'give', 'damn', 'IQ', 'actually', 'more', 'intelligent', 'one', 'more', 'slimy', 'one.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'are', 'identifying', 'film', 'claiming', 'know', 'Jack', 'Miles', 'need', 'serious', 'help', 'film', 'pathetic', 'losers', 'life', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'almost', 'everyone', 'miserable', 'sort', 'thing', 'appeals', 'enjoy', 'will', 'give', 'pass']",Sideways (Region 2)

888820,A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,B0007RUSGW,"Erik Olson ""Seeker Reviews""","[5, 7]","While reading the novel that this movie is based upon, I was struck by how timing and identification can make or break one's reaction to a book.  The same goes for movies. In 1995 I probably wouldn't have given this movie a second glance.  But I had gotten into drinking wine a couple of years before ""Sideways"" came out, and I was also close to the age of the main characters.  So in 2005 I was primed to empathize with their cathartic journey of middle-aged self-discovery.The plot is pretty straightforward.  Miles and Jack are two fortysomething guys who've been friends since college.  Miles is a divorced schoolteacher and failed writer, while Jack is a has-been actor engaged to a rich young woman.  Despite his shaky financial status, Miles likes the finer things in life - such as fine dining and stimulating conversation over a good pinot noir.  So, as a ""last hurrah"" before Jack's marriage, Miles decides to take him on a weeklong trip through California wine country.  However, they get more than they bargained for, especially after meeting Maya and Stephanie.  To say much more would turn a fine vintage into vinegar.The four main actors are uniformly excellent.  Paul Giamatti brings a sharp pathos to Miles, and Thomas Haden Church embodies Jack as a likeable but selfish aging lothario.  As for the ladies, Virginia Madsen's Maya is a lovely, intelligent woman with a great palate who is a bit out of Miles' league, and Sandra Oh's Stephanie is sexy, sassy, and vulnerable to Jack's seductive charisma.  For me, Giamatti's performance is especially poignant, since he perfectly embodies the solitary, yearning existence of a middle-aged singleton whose literary and relational dreams have withered on the vine.  In addition, as a single man that has ""lost"" many friends to marriage, I identified with Miles' reactions to Jack's withdrawal from their friendship into matrimony (not to mention his withdrawal into Stephanie).  Based on my own life, I could tell that Miles had plenty of practice making the best of solitude.The DVD extras add body and flavor to the feature presentation.  For example, each of the deleted scenes comes with a text introduction by the director explaining its significance and why it was cut.  But the real standout is the commentary by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church.  They have a natural chemistry, and their banter really shines.  The intriguing insights they provide are leavened with plenty of self-deprecating humor (almost as funny as the movie itself), with just enough trivia to leave one wanting more.  It's how film commentary should be done.  The only possible improvement would've been input by the female leads.  I certainly would've enjoyed their perspective on the proceedings.Anyone heading towards mid-life (or already there) will identify with the themes of loss, regret, and second chances in ""Sideways.""

I adamantly refused to see this film when it was new, because I didn't like what I read in the reviews.  When it came out in 2004 I was a relatively new wine connoisseur, and the film seemed to represent superficial notions about wine.  I might still find fault with the film's depiction of drinking in wine bars, since my idea of mixing wine and romance is a tete-a-tete with a great wine and a great meal prepared by a sensuous lover...but that's a different story.  I thoroughly sympathized with Miles' disdain for mediocre so-called ""Merlot"" - but felt a wine-lover's annoyance at the unfair slight to a great grape!  I know - what doest this have to do with film?  It's CA Merlot that is the problem!  Smith Haut-Laffite '95 was an awesome wine - a Bordeaux blend based primarily on Merlot. Joseph Phelps Insignia from CA is an excellent Bordeaux-style blend which depends on Merlot.  Pape Clement makes an excellent moderately expensive wine based primarily on Merlot. So let's not diss Merlot!  What does that have to do with the film?  Nothing! Since I study film, and this film received great reviews including a 96% Rotten Tomatoes rating, I had to watch it - and I enjoyed it very well.  It's an excellent ensemble film, in which wine isn't much more than a pretense for the story, which in many ways follows a pattern of other good stories featuring one uptight guy and one looser.  The writers received an Academy Award for their excellent work and deserved it.  The acting was excellent as well, and the characters are appealing.  I recommend this enjoyable film - even to wine connoisseurs who think they know better (~;",4,A very decent film - best drunk before 2008...,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1693,"['Warning', 'attitude', 'film', 'idiosyncratic', 'adamantly', 'refused', 'see', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'did', ""n't"", 'what', 'read', 'reviews', 'When', 'came', 'out', '2004', 'was', 'relatively', 'new', 'wine', 'connoisseur', 'film', 'seemed', 'represent', 'superficial', 'notions', 'wine', 'might', 'still', 'find', 'fault', 'film', 'depiction', 'drinking', 'wine', 'bars', 'idea', 'mixing', 'wine', 'romance', 'tete-a-tete', 'great', 'wine', 'great', 'meal', 'prepared', 'sensuous', 'lover', 'different', 'story', 'thoroughly', 'sympathized', 'Miles', 'disdain', 'mediocre', 'so-called', 'Merlot', 'felt', 'wine-lover', 'annoyance', 'unfair', 'slight', 'great', 'grape', 'know', 'what', 'doest', 'have', 'do', 'film', 'CA', 'Merlot', 'problem', 'Smith', 'Haut-Laffite', ""'95"", 'was', 'awesome', 'wine', 'Bordeaux', 'blend', 'based', 'primarily', 'Merlot', 'Joseph', 'Phelps', 'Insignia', 'CA', 'excellent', 'Bordeaux-style', 'blend', 'Merlot', 'Pape', 'Clement', 'excellent', 'moderately', 'expensive', 'wine', 'based', 'primarily', 'Merlot', 'So', 'let', 'not', 'diss', 'Merlot', 'What', 'have', 'do', 'film', 'Nothing', 'study', 'film', 'film', 'received', 'great', 'reviews', 'including', '96', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'rating', 'had', 'watch', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'well', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'film', 'wine', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'pretense', 'story', 'many', 'ways', 'pattern', 'other', 'good', 'stories', 'featuring', 'one', 'uptight', 'guy', 'one', 'looser', 'writers', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'excellent', 'work', 'deserved', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'are', 'appealing', 'recommend', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'even', 'wine', 'connoisseurs', 'who', 'think', 'know', 'better', '~']",Sideways (Region 2)
888827,A1AW35YVQ61AA3,B0007RUSGW,Frank Leonidas,"[2, 8]","I have only seen four of Alexander Payne's films: Citizen Ruth, Election, About Schmidt and Sideways. These four irreverent films share a common thread. They are each in their own way a meditation on hopelessness and despair. Payne's gift, or rather his forte, is to coat most of this misery with a black comic enamel. They are mostly all character-driven stories with what can only be described as 'sometimes-lovable-losers' at the helm.In Citizen Ruth it's Laura Dern as poor ""Ruth Stoops"" the glue-sniffing titular anti-heroine; in Election it's Matthew Broderick's poor ""Mr. McAllister"" who engages in some highly questionable personal and professional affairs including adultery, student council election rigging and revenge among other things; in About Schmidt it's Jack Nicholson's poor ""Warren Schmidt"" who must come to terms with a life of failed relationships and a future just as worse; and now it's Paul Giamatti (arguably the biggest loser of them all) who portrays poor ""Miles"" in Sideways as a wounded man who lives in his own little world but soon finds himself on a precipice and is given the chance to stay put or transform into something more.Like all of these interesting and inventive characters, Miles' journey is not an easy one. There are plenty of set-backs, obstacles, awkward sexual encounters and most of all demons that he must face. Miles seems to like his demons however, or at least he's gotten used to them. I wish we could have learned more about this man other than what he knows about wine and how he responds to his gregarious friend and horny road-trip mate. The only problem I have with Payne's major body of work is -- they are all essentially the same character on the same quest. What makes each of these movies interesting is not necessarily the constant personal misery that the main characters face (or rather resist facing until the end) but the supporting players along for the ride.In Sideways, it's Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen (both nominated for Academy Awards for this film). Church's ""Jack"" is a mixed bag. He's equally engaging and completely revolting. It's no wonder for he plays a spoiled playboy and soap opera actor in this. He is a delight to watch. He is also perhaps the only character in the film who knows exactly who he is as a person even though he never really knows what he wants. Madsen plays ""Maya"", the waitress with a heart of gold. What could have been an easily forgettable female protagonist is saved and graced by Madsen with one Oscar-clip moment that in my humble opinion almost elevates the entire film. If you've seen the movie or watched the Oscars you know what scene I'm referring to. There's no tears, no fancy camera tricks, no heightened drama really. It's simply Maya talking about wine (yet so much more). This brief and wonderful moment made the whole film worth watching for me or perhaps it's the one bright thing that I have taken away from this movie and held onto inside.Sideways is a sometimes-funny film (I think it was supposed to be a comedy) but it tries too hard to be about 'real life' that it seems more movie-real than anything else. There's enough anxiety in this film to make even Woody Allen or Albert Brooks blush a little and the great Paul Giamatti handles most of it with deft aplomb but like all of Payne's miserable losers his character just runs out of steam by the end. I intentionally stayed far away from this one when it first came out. I didn't want the hype (like near-unanimous critical praise and one Academy Award for Payne's adapted screenplay) surrounding it to effect my viewing and potential enjoyment. I'm glad I saw this film (like all of Payne's films) but he really needs to get a new act. I'm starting to think he's cornered the market on movies with pathetic people resisting the urge to change.In that respect, I feel Citizen Ruth is his best film. Ruth certainly manufacturers her own problems but she's also being exploited by everyone else in the system and there's the difference. It's also his least cloying and most edgy film to date. Ultimately, I wanted Sideways to be better than what it was. It's the greatest movie about the art of appreciating wine that I have ever seen. Sure there's a lot more going on but that's what I found most successful about it. I think Payne might have been reaching for a little more.",3,A Payne-ful experience,1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,4368,"['have', 'only', 'seen', 'four', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'films', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'Election', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'Sideways', 'four', 'irreverent', 'films', 'share', 'common', 'thread', 'are', 'own', 'way', 'meditation', 'hopelessness', 'despair', 'Payne', 'gift', 'rather', 'forte', 'coat', 'most', 'misery', 'black', 'comic', 'enamel', 'are', 'mostly', 'character-driven', 'stories', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', ""'sometimes-lovable-losers"", 'helm.In', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'poor', 'Ruth', 'Stoops', 'glue-sniffing', 'titular', 'anti-heroine', 'Election', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'poor', 'Mr.', 'McAllister', 'who', 'highly', 'questionable', 'personal', 'professional', 'affairs', 'including', 'adultery', 'student', 'council', 'election', 'rigging', 'revenge', 'other', 'things', 'Schmidt', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'poor', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'who', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'life', 'failed', 'relationships', 'future', 'just', 'worse', 'now', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'arguably', 'biggest', 'loser', 'who', 'poor', 'Miles', 'Sideways', 'wounded', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'soon', 'precipice', 'given', 'chance', 'stay', 'put', 'transform', 'something', 'interesting', 'inventive', 'characters', 'Miles', 'journey', 'not', 'easy', 'one', 'are', 'plenty', 'set-backs', 'obstacles', 'awkward', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'most', 'demons', 'must', 'face', 'Miles', 'like', 'demons', 'however', 'least', 'gotten', 'used', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'learned', 'more', 'man', 'other', 'what', 'wine', 'how', 'gregarious', 'friend', 'horny', 'road-trip', 'mate', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'Payne', 'major', 'body', 'work', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'character', 'same', 'quest', 'What', 'movies', 'interesting', 'not', 'necessarily', 'constant', 'personal', 'misery', 'main', 'characters', 'face', 'rather', 'resist', 'facing', 'end', 'supporting', 'players', 'ride.In', 'Sideways', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'film', 'Church', 'Jack', 'mixed', 'bag', 'equally', 'engaging', 'completely', 'revolting', 'wonder', 'spoiled', 'playboy', 'soap', 'opera', 'actor', 'delight', 'watch', 'also', 'perhaps', 'only', 'character', 'film', 'who', 'exactly', 'who', 'person', 'even', 'never', 'really', 'what', 'Madsen', 'Maya', 'waitress', 'heart', 'gold', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'female', 'protagonist', 'saved', 'graced', 'Madsen', 'one', 'Oscar-clip', 'moment', 'humble', 'opinion', 'almost', 'entire', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'watched', 'Oscars', 'know', 'what', 'scene', ""'m"", 'referring', 'tears', 'fancy', 'camera', 'tricks', 'heightened', 'drama', 'really', 'simply', 'Maya', 'talking', 'wine', 'yet', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'brief', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'made', 'whole', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'perhaps', 'one', 'bright', 'thing', 'have', 'taken', 'away', 'movie', 'held', 'inside.Sideways', 'sometimes-funny', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'too', 'hard', 'be', ""'real"", 'life', 'more', 'movie-real', 'anything', 'else', 'enough', 'anxiety', 'film', 'make', 'even', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'blush', 'little', 'great', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'most', 'deft', 'aplomb', 'Payne', 'miserable', 'losers', 'character', 'just', 'steam', 'end', 'intentionally', 'stayed', 'far', 'away', 'one', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hype', 'near-unanimous', 'critical', 'praise', 'one', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Payne', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'surrounding', 'effect', 'viewing', 'potential', 'enjoyment', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'film', 'Payne', 'films', 'really', 'get', 'new', 'act', ""'m"", 'starting', 'think', 'cornered', 'market', 'movies', 'pathetic', 'people', 'resisting', 'urge', 'change.In', 'respect', 'feel', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'best', 'film', 'Ruth', 'certainly', 'manufacturers', 'own', 'problems', 'also', 'being', 'exploited', 'everyone', 'else', 'system', 'difference', 'also', 'least', 'cloying', 'most', 'edgy', 'film', 'date', 'Ultimately', 'wanted', 'Sideways', 'be', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'greatest', 'movie', 'art', 'appreciating', 'wine', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Sure', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'successful', 'think', 'Payne', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'reaching', 'little', 'more']",Sideways (Region 2)

He is also a terrific writer, and he shared those honors with his often used collaborator Jim Taylor; who also has directed a couple of Indie films. It is based on the best-selling novel by Rex Pickett, who prior to this was considered a film script writer; and who also has directed a movie; HOLLYWOOD TO DEADWOOD (1989).Rarely has a novel transferred so seamlessly to the screen. Roger Ebert wrote,""Payne finds plots that service his characters, instead of limiting them."" Payne has a terrific eye for his casting as well. Ebert wrote further,"" He chooses actors who will prevent you from ever being able to imagine anyone else in the role.""One critic wrote,"" This is a film about wine and whine."" Two old college buddies decide on a bachelor party adventure. Jack, a middle-aged actor clinging to the last of his looks, and delegated to voice overs on commercials, is getting married. His buddy, Miles, a dumpy depressed Junior High English teacher, still stunned after two years from his divorce, sets them off to northern California, near San Luis Obispo, to take a wine tour of some of his favorite vineyards. It is the story of faded youth and faded potential.It is a comedy with dramatic moments. It is a drama with laughs in it. It is both tragic farce, mixing Commedia absurdity with John Steinbeck scenarios, and slapstick situational comedy, mixing belly laughs with geniune heart-touching moments. Miles has envisioned a halcyon week of wine tasting, stimulating conversations, and some winner hangovers. Jack has envisioned a series of hustles giving him a chance to score heatedly before the finality of his upcoming nuptials. Enter two incredible women, one a waitress going to night school, and one a counter pour-girl at a local winery who is a single mother. They are very well written characters, and these women appear real and fresh and sexy and complicated.Paul Giamatti is Miles. He is a fine character actor with a theatre background who has been delegated to a score of lightweight comedies, punctuated by good work in DONNIE BRASCO (1997), MAN IN THE MOON (1999), and a star-turn as Harvey Pekar in AMERICAN SPLENDOR (2003). SIDEWAYS is his best work to date. He did not receive a Golden Globe, though nominated. Perhaps Oscar will be kinder. Thomas Haden Church played Jack. This film was his breakthrough role. Most of his films, and TV work over the last twenty years has been less than classic in stature. The lovely Virginia Madsen played Maya, the fetching waitress. Payne coaxed her very best performance to date onto the screen. She is stunning, vulnurable, and beautiful to her core. A scene she has with Miles, where they sit quietly discussing wine, is one of the most heartwarming scenes in any film this year. Sandra Oh, Payne's real-life wife, played Stephanie, and she had a red hot passionate presence; like a cat in heat.

888835,A3S583K80QN1VG,B0007RUSGW,"G. M. Handlon ""the brewfisher""","[11, 27]","First, let me say that if you liked this movie, it might be indicative of why you're middle-aged and going through a crisis, have a trail of broken marriages behind you, and wondering why you're single yet again.  Please, for all of our sakes, grow up.That's a good segue into why this is such a sophomoric movie.  The main perps are pitiful, narcissistic boomers who never grew up, and when the credits roll, should you somehow make it that far, you realize they never will.  I found every aspect of this story stupid, but maybe that was their point.  I can accept that, but to then call it ""intelligent comedy""?  Doublespeak.Miles, the hero, is is a 40-something man/boy who gets his mom drunk and steals her money when she passes out so that he and his role model can get drunk for a week. He strives for, achieves and laments mediocrity.  He knows wrong from right, but like the rest of the PC crowd, he looks the other way, afraid that if he identifies wrong, people might not like him.  He tries to impress others with his pretentiousness and lives his life in fear.  Worst of all, he's a school teacher, and we're supposed to think he's funny?  If you think it's funny that someone this lacking in quality of character could be teaching YOUR kids, you need professional help, and a visit from social services.Jack is a self-absorbed *user* whose must unzip his pants to engage his brain.  Engaged to be married in a week, he's out to screw as many women as he can before it becomes grounds for divorce, which is inevitable.  This behavior isn't unusual for him, it's SOP, and we are to believe he's not a walking STD incubator.  It's obvious he doesn't value marriage because one of his conquests is married.  When confronted by another of his trophies, he gets the snot beat out of him. Honestly, I was very disappointed that she didn't shoot him.  He does meet the love of his life though...in every mirror.  Jack is so Hollywood.Maya is a hard working waitress, and the least dysfunctional of the cast, which isn't saying much.  Everyone else in the movie is trying to get her to sleep with loser, er, Miles.  She tries to like Miles, but it's a constant compromise of her standards. The more she finds out about him, the more she realizes her instincts are correct about his true character (or lack thereof).  In the end, she's a compromised loser like everybody else and the movie begs us to pity her.And Stephanie?  Well, Steph is just looking for a man to take care of her and her daughter, and she's not getting any younger, you know.  The Stephanie method; jump into bed with every guy who comes along and screw his brains out, of course.  After all, sex=love, love=sex, right?  In the end, she's been had (yet again).  But she was a willing participant, so why is she so angry?  Because she's stupid, that's why.  She thinks men want to marry women who jump into bed with them after two hours.  She apparently also thinks that she's entitled to marriage after screwing the same stranger four times.  If she were 16, we might call her naive. But Steph's been around this block and should know better.I have a question for the women out there who loved this film.  Is this how you want men to behave with you?  Is this (compromising, stupid, sleazy and desperate) the image of women that you want men to have in mind when they meet you?  How about when they meet your daughter?  Yeah, that's what I thought.This was not a comedy.  It was a sad film about unhappy people.  At the end, you aren't left laughing, you are just stricken by the hopelessness of it all.  The only redeeming quality to be found in this toilet bowl full of soft porn and vulgarity is as a warning to grow up.Why did the Hollywood crowd so eagerly buzz over this garbage?  No, not because they're flies (well, I might reconsider that).  It's because this type of self-indulgent and stupid behavior is reflective of liberal Hollywood values.  It's how the liberal crowd lives...indulging every animalistic urge no matter what sad consequences result.  Like Jack, they simply love themselves, and they litter a path of brokenness in their wake as they screw their way through their loveless lives.The wise accumulate wisdom; fools get stupider by the day.I can't wait to read your comments, should you disagree.",1,Moronic and sad,1169769600,"01 26, 2007",2007,4297,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'liked', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'indicative', 'why', ""'re"", 'middle-aged', 'going', 'crisis', 'have', 'trail', 'broken', 'marriages', 'wondering', 'why', ""'re"", 'single', 'yet', 'again', 'Please', 'sakes', 'grow', 'good', 'segue', 'why', 'such', 'sophomoric', 'movie', 'main', 'perps', 'are', 'pitiful', 'narcissistic', 'boomers', 'who', 'never', 'grew', 'up', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', 'should', 'somehow', 'make', 'far', 'realize', 'never', 'will', 'found', 'aspect', 'story', 'stupid', 'maybe', 'was', 'point', 'can', 'accept', 'then', 'call', 'intelligent', 'comedy', 'Doublespeak.Miles', 'hero', '40-something', 'man/boy', 'who', 'mom', 'drunk', 'steals', 'money', 'when', 'out', 'so', 'role', 'model', 'can', 'get', 'drunk', 'week', 'achieves', 'laments', 'mediocrity', 'wrong', 'right', 'rest', 'PC', 'crowd', 'other', 'way', 'afraid', 'wrong', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'impress', 'others', 'pretentiousness', 'life', 'fear', 'Worst', 'school', 'teacher', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'funny', 'think', 'funny', 'someone', 'lacking', 'quality', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'teaching', 'YOUR', 'kids', 'need', 'professional', 'help', 'visit', 'social', 'services.Jack', 'self-absorbed', '*user*', 'must', 'unzip', 'pants', 'engage', 'brain', 'Engaged', 'be', 'married', 'week', 'out', 'screw', 'many', 'women', 'can', 'grounds', 'divorce', 'inevitable', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'unusual', 'SOP', 'are', 'believe', 'not', 'walking', 'STD', 'incubator', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'value', 'marriage', 'one', 'conquests', 'married', 'When', 'confronted', 'trophies', 'snot', 'beat', 'Honestly', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'meet', 'love', 'life', 'mirror', 'Jack', 'so', 'Hollywood.Maya', 'hard', 'working', 'waitress', 'least', 'dysfunctional', 'cast', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'Everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'trying', 'get', 'sleep', 'loser', 'er', 'Miles', 'like', 'Miles', 'constant', 'compromise', 'standards', 'more', 'out', 'more', 'instincts', 'are', 'correct', 'true', 'character', 'lack', 'thereof', 'end', 'compromised', 'loser', 'everybody', 'else', 'movie', 'pity', 'her.And', 'Stephanie', 'Well', 'Steph', 'just', 'looking', 'man', 'take', 'care', 'daughter', 'not', 'getting', 'younger', 'know', 'Stephanie', 'method', 'jump', 'bed', 'guy', 'who', 'along', 'screw', 'brains', 'out', 'course', 'sex=love', 'love=sex', 'right', 'end', 'been', 'had', 'yet', 'again', 'was', 'willing', 'participant', 'so', 'why', 'so', 'angry', 'stupid', 'why', 'men', 'want', 'marry', 'women', 'who', 'jump', 'bed', 'two', 'hours', 'apparently', 'also', 'entitled', 'marriage', 'screwing', 'same', 'stranger', 'four', 'times', 'were', '16', 'might', 'call', 'naive', 'Steph', 'been', 'block', 'should', 'know', 'better.I', 'have', 'question', 'women', 'who', 'loved', 'film', 'how', 'want', 'men', 'behave', 'compromising', 'stupid', 'sleazy', 'desperate', 'image', 'women', 'want', 'men', 'have', 'mind', 'when', 'meet', 'How', 'when', 'meet', 'daughter', 'Yeah', 'what', 'thought.This', 'was', 'not', 'comedy', 'was', 'sad', 'film', 'unhappy', 'people', 'end', 'are', ""n't"", 'left', 'laughing', 'are', 'just', 'stricken', 'hopelessness', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'be', 'found', 'toilet', 'full', 'soft', 'porn', 'vulgarity', 'warning', 'grow', 'up.Why', 'did', 'Hollywood', 'crowd', 'so', 'eagerly', 'buzz', 'garbage', 'No', 'not', ""'re"", 'flies', 'well', 'might', 'reconsider', 'type', 'self-indulgent', 'stupid', 'behavior', 'reflective', 'liberal', 'Hollywood', 'values', 'how', 'liberal', 'crowd', 'lives', 'indulging', 'animalistic', 'urge', 'matter', 'what', 'consequences', 'result', 'Jack', 'simply', 'love', 'litter', 'path', 'brokenness', 'wake', 'screw', 'way', 'loveless', 'lives.The', 'wise', 'accumulate', 'wisdom', 'fools', 'get', 'stupider', 'day.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'read', 'comments', 'should', 'disagree']",Sideways (Region 2)

Two years into his divorce Miles (Giamatti) has sunk into a depressive funk so deep he is prone towards unintentionally but automatically sabotaging everything around him.  His latest novel is passed over for publication, and nothing is going right for him.  Jack (Haden Church) is a sunny-dispositioned, womanizing, has been soap actor eking out a life doing commercials and out for one last go at bachelor freedom.  Together, they are quite a pair.During the trip they meet and woo local wine country gals Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen, each of them just about as different as the boys.One of the highlights of the film - and not a comical one - is Virginia Madsen as Maya describing why she loves wine - describing the ""life"" of a bottle of wine in a manner that wine truly and instantly comes alive:  the words and Madsen's delivery of them is nothing less than astonishing, powerfully moving combining the sensual and spiritual.Everything about Sideways resonated strongly, beautifully, sadly and hilariously for me.

888837,AYOO12C9Y2T95,B0007RUSGW,"Greg Brady ""columbusboy""","[4, 8]","SYNPOSIS:Jack (Thomas Haden Church) is an engaged actor fighting commitment, toying with women, and seeking some sophistication, while his morose English teacher buddy Miles (Paul Giamatti) is popping Xanax, hoping to get a novel published, and struggling to keep his ex-wife's flame flickering after 2 years apart. SIDEWAYS is a road film, following along as the pair take a trip into California Wine Country. Miles has visions of wine tastings and golf outings, while Jack sees it as his last chance to sow wild oats before getting married. Along the way, Jack finally learns the grass may not really be greener on the other side of the fence after all (through a dalliance with Sandra Oh's character ""Stephanie"") and Miles learns he may still find new love outside of his ex-wife in a fellow wine connoisseur, beautiful waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen). The flick won Golden Globe awards for Best Picture (Comedy/Musical) and Best Screenplay as well as an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.WHAT I LIKED:Miles' speech to Maya about Pinot wines that reveals his own character:""it's thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early, it's not a survivor like Cabernet..pinot needs constant care and attention"" (Scene 15)Miles' epiphany with the '61 wine in the diner: I won't ruin the ending but I'll just say I liked how it didn't fully resolve, paralleling Miles' own unpublished novel.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:The scene where Miles goes to retrieve Jack's wallet after it's been left behind when he runs away from the husband of the woman he's been caught in bed with (Scene 27). I'm sure some critics will insist it has to be there to show the deep fraternity between Jack and Miles but I didn't see it as being essential to the plot, more of just a device to show again how much of a screw-up Jack is. It wouldn't have really ruined the movie to leave it out.BOTTOM LINE:Even though all the high-falutin' reviewer types seemed to eat the movie up, it didn't have the pretentious aura many critic's darlings do.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a middle-aged man myself, but I cannot relate to either of the weasels in this movie, or the dumb screenplay and its cliche, and much too obvious, theme of wine as a metaphor for life.The first 2/3 of the movie was almost passable--I would have given it three stars up to that point--but like many movies of its kind, it falls too far below the beltline in the end, esp. when Mr. can't-keep-it-in-his-pants ""picks up"" a chubby waitress and ""BF's"" her on the floor of her squalid living room, and gets chased out of the house by her neanderthal husband...yeah, really classy and sophisticated humor here. I don't require humor to be sophisticated--hell, I've seen Caddyshack ten times!--but this movie seemed like it was trying to be a more grown up comedy, only to go ""right for the crotch"" in the end.I allowed my wife to ""drag"" me to see this movie on the eve of the academy awards, because she's a real movie buff, and she likes to see all of the oscar-nominated movies each year. I had vetoed it once before when she tried to get me to see it after the initial positive reviews.

888852,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0007RUSGW,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[3, 7]","""Sideways"" is at once a quirky comedy, and a moving, sometimes painful, drama about two men approaching middle-age, struggling with their identity and uncertain futures. Director Alexander Payne adapted the screenplay with his longtime writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book ""Sideways"" by Rex Pickett.  They created a well crafted plot, and complex, flawed characters. And the actors provide superb performances.Miles Raymond, (played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti), a somewhat nerdy, middle school English teacher and would-be novelist, has been unhappily divorced for two years, and is lonely, perpetually depressed and disappointed by his own failures and missed opportunities. He anxiously awaits a publisher's decision about the fate of his book, entitled ""The Day After Yesterday,"" while he prepares for a much needed get-away trip with friend Jack Lopate. Jack, (Thomas Haden Church), and Miles were college roommates and have maintained a close, if neurotic friendship. Jack, a fading bit part TV actor and total commitment-phobe, is getting married in a week - for the first time. Before the wedding the two 40-something schlemiels take-off on a road trip through California's wine country. Miles wants to give his friend a worthy send-off, a wedding gift, before he finally takes the walk down the aisle. An amateur wine enthusiast and snob, Miles has planned a week of wine tasting, fine food, male bonding and golf. Jack has another agenda. He wants to sow as many wild oats as he can cram into seven days. And he wants the melancholy, unwilling Miles to have at least one one-night-stand. This is so not your father's bachelor party! They travel light but carry some heavy baggage with them.The two travel and taste wine throughout the gorgeous Santa Ynez region. The cinematography is wonderful and some of the rural landscapes resemble paintings. At a restaurant Miles frequents when in the area, they meet waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen), who Miles has long been attracted to. Jack is immediately on his buddy's back to ""party"" with Maya. His pushy insistence fills Miles with disgust and dismay. Then the men meet winery employee, Stephanie (Sandra Oh). Jack immediately hits on the young hottie and is successful!? However, he fails to mention his upcoming wedding plans to her. After 24 hours he does mention that he loves her and is thinking of moving to the valley, and, perhaps, buying a winery. Sadly he believes every word he says. Stephanie knows Maya, and the four get together for dinner. Later, while Jack and Steph are romancing, Miles and Maya talk about their passion for wine. When Maya asks Miles why he ""has a thing for Pinot Noir,"" his response is sad and self-revealing. ""It's a hard grape to grow. It's thin-skinned, temperamental, and ripens early. It is not like Cabernet, which can grow anywhere and thrive, even when it's neglected. In fact, it can only grow in these specific tucked-away corners of the world. Only the most patient and nurturing of growers can do it...to understand Pinot's potential and coax it into its fullest expression."" Maya, a wise and sensitive woman, who is studying horticulture at the local university, understands. Her response, a wonderfully poetic monologue about what wine means to her, is mesmerizing. This gem of a scene is one of my favorites in the film.Eventually, after much character development, multiple adventures, plot twists, excellent dialogue, terrific humor, (there is a golf course scene which is hilarious!), many a bottle of great wine imbibed, and intense moments of self-revelation, the two guys, still friends, go home - back to reality. This is definitely a 5 Star film, nuanced, complex, with fabulous depth, seductive and not too fruity!

An old acquaintance from college has sent him a wedding invitation, and because Giamatti's character doesn't have many friends, he decides to take this guy (Thomas Haden Church, who was nominated for an Academy Award for this role) on a wine-tasting tour of the California wine country as a wedding gift. This is more an excuse for companionship than an act of generosity.The friend is blustery, claims to be blissfully happy with his impending marriage and is delighted to take off on the tour. The minute they get out of town, he starts being an absolute jerk. He is immediately unfaithful to his fianc&eacute;e, gets into one scrape after another and generally turns this &#34;gift&#34; into an unmitigated disaster. HE is on a wine-drinking tour, not a wine-tasting one.Sandra Oh plays one of the women with whom he hooks up.

Both main characters are pretty pathetic and despicable.  Who would marry either one?  I won't recap the plot, such as there is one, besides two losers bumbling from one drunken screw-up to the next.Miles is a depressed, low-self-esteemed, would-be writer, obsessed with his Ex and a borderline alcoholic.  He wants to appear a wine snob and knowledgeable.  He so worried about his wine that he has lost the ability to enjoy the $5 bottle in the park, in coffee mugs.  (At least he knows that Richebourg kicks any CA pinot noir!  Riesling right next to pinot noir, next to cabernet sauvignon, next to syrah, next to chardonnay, next to zinfandel?!  Give me a break.)Jack is an arrogant, washed-up soap opera actor, uncertain about his impending marriage - uncertain enough to go after anything in a skirt and lie to everyone around him for a final, sordid fling before the wedding.The two female leads are decent enough characters (though why Sandra Oh's character would fall for that loser Jack is beyond me.)I'm male, straight, married, well-educated, well-read, well-traveled, and I have made a serious study of wine.  There wasn't much here to interest me.  It had a few funny moments, here and there, that's about it.  Virtually nothing about wine, and what was there was about 50% wrong.  A lot of it was rather ham-handed (the scene behind the ""industrial"" winery; the scene where Miles tells Maya why he likes Pinot Noir - gag me!).  It thoroughly deserves its ""R"" rating:  sex, nudity, language.  The final scene is at least hopeful - probably the best scene in the movie.  The film won an Oscar for screen writing adaptation from a novel.  It may have deserved that -- if so, that sure wouldn't make me want to run out and read the novel!Only very mildy amusing and mostly mildy offensive.  I saw it to see what the hype was about.

Great acting, especially on the part of Paul Giamatti, realistic characters, and a very interesting subplot involving California wines and those who immerse themselves in them -- both as consumers and as students.The film is about a couple of middle-aged guys, one of whom is about to get married, who want to spend a week having a good time before the ceremony. Predictably, this means that the groom-to-be is looking to hook up with as many women as possible before the big day. His travel companion (Giamatti) is a gloomy oenophile who can't get over the fact that his own marriage fell apart. He compensates by crawling inside a bottle -- not as a drinker, but as a wine aficionado. Studying wine makes up for the great hole in his emotional life. The mismatch between the temperament and aspirations of these two men is what many find charming about the film.Still, I found the film disappointing.

The acting and casting are excellent: Giamatti, Church, Madsen and Oh are all very good. The story is bittersweet, but the movie has some very funny scenes. The movie is literate and intelligent. My favorite part is when the characters of Giamatti and Madsen discuss why they love wine. The movie gives me insight into an obsession and a world of which I am not familiar.There are several scenes where the characters are talking, eating, drinking wine and enjoying life and each other. The movie works in part, because the characters seem to enjoy each others company. There is nothing I really dislike about the movie. The two main characters are not very likeable, but the movie works because the characters are not perfect or even good people. They are two losers and that is the point.The DVD has extra features. The deleted scenes are okay, but nothing stands out. The commentary by Church and Giammatti is funny, but not very poignant.

""A New Yorker""","[12, 15]","Tonight had been the first time I seen this film and the reason why it took me so long to see this film was because it wasn't high on my ""Must See List."" At the end of this film I quite enjoyed it and for many reasons. One may be that I will never see a commemorative Sideways bottle of wine or the Sideways happy meal at McDonald's. My point is that Sideways is a great movie and nothing more. It doesn't rely on blockbuster star power. It doesn't need flashy special effects or gimmicks. Paul Giammatti performs flawlessly as a flawed and deeply troubled character. I found myself forgetting he was acting. I only saw the character he was playing and became engrossed by his presence. Thomas Haden Church offers a very nice contrast by playing what appears to be a two-dimensional, sophomoric, womanizer.The story is simple and focuses more on character development. It is easy to connect with each of the main characters. They may not be likable but what they are is human. If you can't relate to them personally, they remind you of a family member or close friend.Overall, this film is for those who like movies based in reality, which as you will see can produce some of the most bizarre and comical situations of all. If you like movies with jokes you don't have to think about (Who doesn't from time to time) don't worry, this film has a surprisingly high amount of low brow, and immature humor.

Wine snobbishness, wine overindulgence, proper wine etiquette, wine as a prelude to sex, wine as an obsession, etc.  Wine is a character, a driving force in this film.  This isn't a film for everyone, and it most likely has appeal to the age group featured in the plotline.The two male leads are former college roommates and complete opposites-Giamatti is an over-indulging, depressed wannabe novelist who just went through a divorce.  Church is an actor/playboy looking for one last fling before he gets married.  The two take a weekend bachelor party trip to wine country.  At first, Giamatti seems like a loser who is dragging everyone down, but then Church takes over as the jerk, the character we are all supposed to hate for his self-centered, reckless behavior.  The movie explores their friendship and their attempts at relationships with women.  This is a powerful drama with some very comedic scenes interspersed (including the discussion of whether committing suicide with further Giamatti's novel, and the scene in which a naked cuckholded husband chases down the pair, beating on their car).",5,A coming of age story for adults in their 30's,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1298,"['Sideways', 'evocative', 'film', 'male', 'friendship', 'relationships', 'flings', 'marriage', 'careers', 'approach', 'middle', 'age', 'settling', 'instead', 'realizing', 'true', 'dreams', 'course', 'wine', 'Wine', 'snobbishness', 'wine', 'overindulgence', 'proper', 'wine', 'etiquette', 'wine', 'prelude', 'sex', 'wine', 'obsession', 'etc', 'Wine', 'character', 'driving', 'force', 'film', ""n't"", 'film', 'everyone', 'most', 'likely', 'appeal', 'age', 'group', 'featured', 'plotline.The', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'former', 'college', 'roommates', 'complete', 'opposites-Giamatti', 'over-indulging', 'depressed', 'wannabe', 'novelist', 'who', 'just', 'went', 'divorce', 'Church', 'actor/playboy', 'looking', 'one', 'last', 'fling', 'married', 'two', 'take', 'weekend', 'bachelor', 'party', 'trip', 'wine', 'country', 'first', 'Giamatti', 'loser', 'who', 'dragging', 'everyone', 'down', 'then', 'Church', 'over', 'jerk', 'character', 'are', 'supposed', 'hate', 'self-centered', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'movie', 'friendship', 'attempts', 'relationships', 'women', 'powerful', 'drama', 'very', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'interspersed', 'including', 'discussion', 'committing', 'suicide', 'further', 'Giamatti', 'novel', 'scene', 'naked', 'cuckholded', 'husband', 'down', 'pair', 'beating', 'car']",Sideways (Region 2)

Miles, a schoolteacher and aspiring novelist, is precise and enjoys a good Pinot Noir. Jack, over his frat-boy prime and a mediocre acting career, shoots off the cuff and enjoys pushing his man-child behavior to the limit.It's true that opposites attract, and former college roommates Miles and Jack have managed to remain friends despite their extreme differences. After two years, Miles is still nursing the wounds of his divorce. Jack on the other hand is ready to take the big plunge. To celebrate the occasion, Miles takes Jack on a week-long trip through California's wine country.Sideways, the new film from writer-director Alexander Payne and writer Jim Taylor (Election, About Schmidt), starts off as an amusing tale of male bonding, and before the bottle is empty, turns into a heartfelt examination of a wounded man's enduring spirit.Like all of Payne and Taylor's films, Sideways takes us on a journey of self-reflection, a celluloid mirror that totally captures the honesty and reality of the characters and situations. Even when the characters stray off the beaten path, it proves advantageous to all concerned. Instead of a movie about two best friends who come to blows over wine and women, we are treated to an engrossing analysis of the fragile state of the human psyche.Giamatti, with his sad, hang dog eyes and introspective kowtow, is perfectly cast as Miles, a man looking for meaning in his life but settling for mediocrity. Miles prides himself on his vast knowledge of all things grape, unaware he's becoming a raisin. Miles doesn't just want this week off, he needs it. He's waiting word from his agent about his long-in-the-works novel, afraid with every ring of the phone comes rejection.Miles is so lost in himself that he becomes vulnerable to Jack's last minute attempt to sow his wild oats, lying to sweet, good natured tasting room server Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and hurting her best friend and potential suitor Maya (Virgina Madsen) in the process.

It's a great road trip/buddy movie.  It isn't perfect--Jack's emotional breakdown at the end is a bit unbelieveable given his character to that point--but the performances throughout are wonderful, and the two leads play off each other perfectly.It's a wonderful actor's movie.  The players run with their characters.  Giamatti and Church play off each other like a comfortable old team; it's a pleasure to watch them.  I read somewhere that George Clooney wanted the role of Jack--the philandering sidekick.  The director was wise enough to avoid the temptation--if it even was a temptation--and go with Church, who is far more believeable than Clooney would have been as a one-time soap opera star now getting by on voice-over work. How would we have felt about such vile language pouring out of Mr. Suave's mouth?It's a poignant comedy, but it does have its crude moments--if you are of a prissy nature, forget it, this one's not for you.  There's nudity, sex, foul language, and drunkenness.The commentary track on the movie features Giamatti and Church...there isn't much there.

888873,A1D2GEP07I0VSS,B0007RUSGW,"Jon M. Lepine ""jaycatt""","[4, 7]","I really enjoyed this movie, even more the second time I saw it.  The first time, in the theater, I had the impression that it was a good movie, but not a great one.  After thinking about it, and talking with other people about it, I've upgraded my opinion.  It's still not a GREAT film, but it certainly is an excellent story.  There aren't a lot of middle-age coming-of-age movies that pull it off as well as this one.  There also aren't a lot of two person (technically) films that can hold your interest.  These two just hae such a rapport together that you find yourself drawn in to whatever they're talking about.  They really do sound like old friends.  I haven't seen such natural dialog since the older Woody Allen films.Add the availability of some excellently themed jazz as a soundtrack and that makes this a 5 star movie for me.  I even bought the soundtrack as a ""reading album"" (something for background while reading) and I have to say it's currently my favorite album.  I even listen to it in the car, as it makes a wonderful driving soundtrack.My favorite aspect of this movie is getting to watch it with people who have never seen it, so I can remember what it was like for me to see some of my favorite scenes for the first time.  It helps that I myself am a lot like Paul's character, and I have a friend very much like Thomas's character (albeit not quite as manipulative).It's also a very good wine movie.  The wine involved in the movie becomes symbolism for the two characters themselves, and how they live their lives.  It's a shame that merlot sales have been hurt due to this movie (according to a friend of mine) because merlot is an excellent way to introduce a person to wine.  Pinot Noir's good and all, but it's not for everybody.  I must confess that I did pick up more than my share of bottles after watching the movie, because Paul G. does such a great job of describing the details of Pinot.The commentary track is absolutely wonderful to listen to.  The two main actors, Paul and Thomas, work just as well off camera as on.  Some of the play between the two is just hysterical.  I listened to it last night, and was laughing out loud at many of the things they said and described.  The deleted scenes are also great, with ""stills"" describing the scene, and then a little portion before and after of the original movie, so you can place the scene.  I didn't watch all of them (as I was eager to listen to the commentary track) but I will eventually.Rent it if you like, but after you've been thinking about it, you'll be wanting to see it again and own a copy to bring out or over to parties to watch with folks who have never seen it.",5,An Excellent Story,1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,2672,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'theater', 'had', 'impression', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'thinking', 'talking', 'other', 'people', ""'ve"", 'upgraded', 'opinion', 'still', 'not', 'GREAT', 'film', 'certainly', 'excellent', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'middle-age', 'coming-of-age', 'movies', 'pull', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'two', 'person', 'technically', 'films', 'can', 'hold', 'interest', 'two', 'just', 'hae', 'such', 'rapport', 'together', 'find', 'drawn', 'whatever', ""'re"", 'talking', 'really', 'do', 'sound', 'old', 'friends', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'such', 'natural', 'dialog', 'older', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films.Add', 'availability', 'excellently', 'themed', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'even', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'reading', 'album', 'something', 'background', 'reading', 'have', 'say', 'currently', 'favorite', 'album', 'even', 'listen', 'car', 'wonderful', 'driving', 'soundtrack.My', 'favorite', 'aspect', 'movie', 'getting', 'watch', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'can', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'see', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'first', 'time', 'am', 'lot', 'Paul', 'character', 'have', 'friend', 'very', 'much', 'Thomas', 'character', 'not', 'quite', 'manipulative', '.It', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'wine', 'movie', 'wine', 'involved', 'movie', 'symbolism', 'two', 'characters', 'how', 'live', 'lives', 'shame', 'merlot', 'sales', 'have', 'been', 'hurt', 'due', 'movie', 'according', 'friend', 'mine', 'merlot', 'excellent', 'way', 'introduce', 'person', 'wine', 'Pinot', 'Noir', 'good', 'not', 'everybody', 'must', 'confess', 'did', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'share', 'bottles', 'watching', 'movie', 'Paul', 'G.', 'great', 'job', 'describing', 'details', 'Pinot.The', 'commentary', 'track', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'listen', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'work', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'off', 'camera', 'play', 'two', 'just', 'hysterical', 'listened', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'things', 'said', 'described', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'stills', 'describing', 'scene', 'then', 'little', 'portion', 'original', 'movie', 'can', 'place', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'was', 'eager', 'listen', 'commentary', 'track', 'will', 'eventually.Rent', 'like', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wanting', 'see', 'again', 'own', 'copy', 'bring', 'out', 'parties', 'watch', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen']",Sideways (Region 2)
888874,AO1J8CI7CZ52Z,B0007RUSGW,Jordan,"[20, 41]","I saw Sideways in the theater only because it was being so well reviewed. This is perhaps the only time i have done this, and now i regret doing so. The previews for the film didn't interest me at all, mostly because i find wine snobs about as interesting as obscure winter sports. This, ultimately, was my problem with the film. I just didn't care. I was generally bored, until the second half when i began to be occasionally offended.I agree with other reviewers who question the plausibility of the friendship between these two men. The film was marketed as a buddy-flick, making it more frustrating to watch two actors with so little chemistry. I also was vaguely annoyed by Virginia Madsen's attraction to Paul Giamatti, she was obviously far too good for him, not to mention attractive, and no amount of love for wine would enable her to get past his neuroses.Thomas Hayden Church's character was simply offensive. It's not that I question the morality of his character (I've learned that Mr. Payne doesn't really deal in morality), I just found certain scenes very hard to watch, especially the saga of the ""fat"" waitress. I didn't think it was funny, i simply felt sorry for her, until the audience is subjected to a terrible view of the ugliest sex i could ever imagine. Then you just wish the movie was over. At that point (after the husband's disgusting body is slammed against the car), I wanted to leave. But my little brother said, ""If I've sat through this much, I'm going to find out how it ends."" So we stayed. And it ended as expected, ambiguously and unsatisfyingly.Finally, I just thought the film's humor was a little elitist (not that i didn't ""get it,"" but that it was desigend to go over the head of most folks, probably red-staters). I think in order to laugh at most of it you either need to be a middle aged man in the middle of a midlife crisis with an obsession with Pinot, or you have to be really concerned with finding obscure, snobbish humor to be funny. This aspect of the film simultaneously bored me and rubbed me quietly the wrong way. I did laugh when Giamatti goes completely crazy, so i wasn't immune to laughter. In fact, I wanted to like the film. But if I told you I did I'd be just as much of a poser as the critics that reiviewed this film so glowingly.

The movie tries to capture that elusive, intangible quality that makes California just a great state to live in, and drive around and enjoy life.The second thing that struck me was how much I learnt about grapes and wines. The film goes into details about the different kinds of grapes and wine, and how fine wine is made. If you pay close attention you might pick up a couple of tips. For instance, I did not know that Pinot is a thin-skinned and temperamental grape that needs constant attention and care.This is basically a wine-based roadtrip movie that Miles  (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church)take before Jack gets married. Miles is a wine afficianado and a divorced struggling writer, who teaches to support himself, while Jack is an actor. The pair travel around the wine country area north of Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, and get into some interesting situations that almost ruins Jack's wedding.

Upon another viewing and a visit to the Wine Country (Napa, not Santa Barbara as depicted in the film) I have decided that this is worth adding to my collection. Basically, it's a good old-fashioned ""buddy picture"" in the same spirit as ""The Odd Couple."" It deals with serious adult issues of marriage, divorce, sex, commitment, jealousy, failure, shame, rage... with a lot of humor. And that's life! (My favorite line was Thomas Haden Church's response to Paul Giamatti's lament that he wasn't even famous enough to commit suicide -- ""What about that guy who wrote ""Confederacy of Dunces?"") Parts of this film are very slapstick-y, but I admit I laughed a lot.

888884,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B0007RUSGW,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[3, 5]","Alexander Payne's wonderful, Academy Award winning film, ""Sideways"" is a mixture of two types of comedy genres, the 'road picture' and the 'buddy picture'. Both these genres mesh together perfectly to create both big laughs and some sobering reflections about how people live their lives.In the film we meet two old friends. First there is Miles (Paul Giamatti) a schlumpy, depressed, middle aged, high school teacher and would-be novelist. He is also a wine connoiseur, who is using his hobby as a cover to get drunk and medicate his depression over his divorce from two years ago. His life is basically stuck in neutral. Then there is Jack (Thomas Haden Church) a handsome but shallow actor, who seems to do most of his thinking with his private parts. His addiction is women and he will say just about anything to get them into bed.As the film opens, Jack is about to get married. The two middle aged men embark on a ""bachelor's week"", vacation road trip, before the nupitals occur. Miles' plan is to go north from San Diego, visit a number of wineries for ""tastings"", have some good meals and take in a little golf. But Jack has other ideals, which are basically more carnal in nature. In their travels, they meet and pick-up, both Maya (Virginia Madsen) a local waitress (and fellow wine connoisseur) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) a sexy winery employee. Romantic sparks fly and entanglements occur, that produce humor, hidden truths, and self-realizations for the characters.The Academy Award winning Script (""2005 Best writing, Adapted Screenplay"") by Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor is both witty, funny and emotionally moving. They have created interesting characters, who you just want to listen to and find out more about. The most interesting scenes in the movie don't necessary involve the slapstick humor, but are the parts, where the characters just sit and talk about themselves. In one of the most memorable scenes of the film, Miles is describing Pinot Noir grapes (his favorite) but eventually you realize he's actually talking about himself. Maya's response to his description is just as good. The scene is almost poetic.The cast in this film is just first rate. Paul Giamatti as the morose, Miles, dosn't just play his part, but inhabits it! The fact that Giamatti wasn't even nominated for an Academy award is mind-boggling. Virginia Madsen (who was nominated) plays the Maya character with a special vitality and sexiness, that the role requires. She makes it believable, that this bright, sexy woman could fall for this sad-sack of a man. Thomas Haden Church (also nomimnated) and Sandra Oh are very funny in their indespensible roles. After seeing these actors you can't imagine anyone else playing these characters.I also want to mention how much this film does work as a road picture. Most movies of this nature ar either filled with endless highways or national monuments. But in this picture, not only are the characters interesting, but so are their vacation stops. Both the locations and the beautiful cinematography (By Phedon Papamichael) just hold your interest and make wish you were there! (In real life the film locations became tourist hotspots!) Finally, I want to mention the breezy, light jazz sountrack from composer, Rolfe Kent, that unobtrusively adds to the flavor of the film. You will unknowingly be humming along with it. This is a wonderfully, funny and moving film, that has some interesting characters.

True, it's not an action flick, nor does the movie set out to convey some deep meaning.  Two middle aged buddies, one about to get married, embark on a trip to enjoy his last days of ""freedom"" as they know it, and they go about in ways neither the bride (or I) would approve.  And while it's hard to forgive the many ""trespasses"" on trust, well, maybe so many viewers hated that movie because they saw so much about themselves they don't want to admit.  I laughed out loud several times, and not always at the obvious spots.  This is a finely crafted movie that goes into so many little details such as that last minute scribbling on the mother's birthday card, the forgotten flowers on the television set -- hello, haven't we all been there???  The movie works because it remains real and true to itself.  The wine tasting dialogue is hilarious -- the well-versed, refined wine-oholic's flowery description versus the average beer gulper's ""huh?"" look on his face is simply priceless.

888886,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007RUSGW,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 13]","Early one morning while everything seemed difficult and problematic as usual, Miles (Paul Giamatti) wakes up to a neighbor knocking on the door telling him to move his car.  Miles, an interesting character in his own right, suffers internally from his long ago divorce that keeps him in a prolonged depression.  He feeds this depression with his preoccupation of negative thinking, which even oozes from his poor appearance and his untidy tiny apartment.  He is the kind of guy most would steer away from, as his presence provides contagious negativity.  He sees himself as a failed writer that tries to get by in life teaching English while the students probably openly disrespect him.  The essence of his character has all of the negative traits of a lonely middle-aged man that has hit a middle age crisis and believes that there is nothing better for him in life than a bleak, sad, pass&eacute;, and isolated existence.Miles returns to the apartment while being aware that he is behind schedule, as he has over slept.  Over the phone Miles excuses himself, which he probably does frequently, for being late while he still finds a moment to escape reality through the thousands of books that cover most of his apartment.  The apartment alone tells more than a thousand words in regards to Miles' situation in life, as all the books suggest that he must be escaping reality as often as he can.  Besides having a fetish for books Miles also dreams of having his own vineyard, which explains his inclination for wine.  Wine is also the reason for why he has overslept, as he recovers from last night's hangover and begins his journey to meet his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church).These two middle-aged men have decide to venture through the Californian wine land while visiting as many vineyards and golf courses as possible over a period of six days.  The reason for this expedition is Jack's upcoming wedding, as they have decided that Jack should enjoy freedom before marriage one final time.  One striking notion is how Jack could be friends with Miles, as Jack is the polar opposite of Miles.  Jack has a career and options to try new things while being a positive, strong, and confident man who seems to have it all.  Why would a person such as Jack hang out with Miles?  Well, this question will answer itself, as Jack is the kind of guy that most people like to know, but only until the moment his true self appears.Middle-age depression compiled by feelings of unworthiness, poor self-esteem, professional rejection, loneliness, and much more seem to be the reason why Miles welcomes Jacks presence.  After all Miles is the key for Jack to be able to be himself - a first-class jerk.  Jack's persona reveals itself when the audience hears Jack say, """"...I was dying in there."" in regards to his new family and wife to be.  This, however, could be Jack expressing his anxiety for the wedding by having cold feet.  Later, in the film, more of Jack's two-facedness will become more consistent which only exists in order to serve his own personal desires without consideration for others.  Jack's career as an actor truly seems to be self-servant for him, as he cheats his way through conversations by deceiving people to like him.  Also, somewhere under this exterior Jack seems to have some form of a confused ego that only lives in the present.  Miles seems to be the only one who is aware of Jack's true nature, but accepts it due to his psychosocial status.Sideways turns into an likable dissection of these two characters, as they will find a crossroad through golf, wine, and women.  On their way to this crossroad Miles will explore his own and other's existence and character, which will give him an opportunity to expand sideways.  Miles realize that he does not have to try to move forward to find what he needs.  Much of this Miles owe to Jack who is the catalyst that pulls him out of his own miserable void.  Yet, Miles does not approve of Jack's methods, which places him in a conundrum.  As an interesting side note, Conundrum is also the name of the publishing company that might publish Miles book.Words such as vibrantly alive and authentic come to mind when listening to what the two main characters say.  This is due to a brilliantly adapted screen play by Alexander Payne who co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Taylor, which originates from a novel by Rex Pickett.  Illustrative, the communication between Miles and Jack displays their friendship by default, as the chemistry between the two transparently exhibits each character's psychology and their interaction with their present social environment.  Ultimately, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church's character contrasts makes the film very absorbing while providing performances of the highest level.  The female antagonists performed by Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh help augment the characteristics of these two, in their own way, pathetic men.  This leaves the audience with an authentic tale of existence, hope, and love, which makes it ok to dream while also trying to work toward those dreams.",5,Witty and Vibrantly Alive Comedy of Personal

Oh, there is lots of wine, but there is far more ""whine"" as well.The first time I saw this a couple of years ago, I thought it was interesting.

The combination, far from being amusing, is often cringe-inducing.Another duality is that Miles is well-versed in wine lingo but has no clue about women, while Jack doesn't have a clue about wine but is willing to go along with whatever any pretty woman has to say about whatever is being poured at the moment if it advances his agenda with her.The movie is probably better for people who have actually been to Los Olivos, Buellton and Solvang. They can appreciate the scenery more and possibly recognize local landmarks such as the Hitchin' Post restaurant (Jocko's in nearby Nipomo is better) that is featured prominently in the film.You'll see that the story is really carried by the main female characters though I could never figure out what the attractive and intelligent Maya saw in a pitiful, snivelling loser like Miles. Then there is the beautiful and flirtatious Stephanie, winningly portayed by Sandra Oh, who at least comes away with her dignity intact after her dalliance with and subsequent revenge on the smarmy Jack.Overall, it wasn't a bad movie. It probably would have been better had the male leads been more likeable. We are supposed to feel sorry for a guy who steals money from his mother and another one who thinks the world revolves around him?

Why would that happen?

It helps to have a somewhat skewed sense of humor and slant on life to enjoy this film, but if you like movies from directors like John Waters, Peter Greenaway, or Australian director Shirley Barrett (especially Love Serenade), you probably won't be put off by that, not to mention some of the more graphic language and occasional nudity and sex scene.Most of the movie isn't like that, though, and much of it is spent discussing the fine points of wine appreciation, hardly a subject for physical or low-brow humor which the movie has its share of. The subject of wine becomes a metaphor for several of the other themes in the movie, including unpredictability of relationships and life in general, and even the misadventures that befall the two main characters' during their week-long R & R, which seems destined to be an unmitigated but hilarious disaster from the very start.Another thing I enjoyed about it, which is more of a personal nostalgia thing, is that I've visited many of the places in the movie, including Buelton, Solvang, Sanford Winery, The Hitching Post Steakhouse, and others, and it was fun to watch the film and recognize so many of them from my past travels. I'm no wine connoisseur but I've read a book or two on the subject and so was able to follow most of the dialog about wine. :-)Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church as the pair of old college buddies were perfect in their roles and did a wonderful job of acting. I think they played off each other well enough so that I hope the director does a sequel or at least another film with both of them in the lead roles.Although not a film for everybody's taste I enjoyed its skewed and downbeat humor and slant on life and I look forward to seeing what this director does in the future.Also, if you haven't seen Love Serenade but enjoyed this movie, I can recommend that one also. Although not well known it has something of a cult following and until last year was the only movie the director had made in many years.",5,A brief comment,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,2205,"['risk', 'sounding', 'cheap', 'sensationalistic', 'tagline', 'movie', 'quirky', 'kinky', 'decadent', 'just', 'plain', 'perversely', 'funny', 'jaded', 'downbeat', 'sort', 'way', 'other', 'words', 'sort', 'movie', 'have', 'somewhat', 'skewed', 'sense', 'humor', 'slant', 'life', 'enjoy', 'film', 'like', 'movies', 'directors', 'John', 'Waters', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'Australian', 'director', 'Shirley', 'Barrett', 'especially', 'Love', 'Serenade', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'not', 'mention', 'more', 'graphic', 'language', 'occasional', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scene.Most', 'movie', ""n't"", 'though', 'much', 'spent', 'discussing', 'fine', 'points', 'wine', 'appreciation', 'hardly', 'subject', 'physical', 'low-brow', 'humor', 'movie', 'share', 'subject', 'wine', 'metaphor', 'several', 'other', 'themes', 'movie', 'including', 'unpredictability', 'relationships', 'life', 'general', 'even', 'misadventures', 'befall', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'week-long', 'R', 'R', 'destined', 'be', 'unmitigated', 'hilarious', 'disaster', 'very', 'start.Another', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'personal', 'nostalgia', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'visited', 'many', 'places', 'movie', 'including', 'Buelton', 'Solvang', 'Sanford', 'Winery', 'Hitching', 'Post', 'Steakhouse', 'others', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'film', 'recognize', 'so', 'many', 'past', 'travels', ""'m"", 'wine', 'connoisseur', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'two', 'subject', 'so', 'was', 'able', 'follow', 'most', 'dialog', 'wine', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'pair', 'old', 'college', 'buddies', 'were', 'perfect', 'roles', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'acting', 'think', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'well', 'enough', 'hope', 'director', 'sequel', 'least', 'film', 'lead', 'not', 'film', 'everybody', 'taste', 'enjoyed', 'skewed', 'downbeat', 'humor', 'slant', 'life', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'director', 'future.Also', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Love', 'Serenade', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'can', 'recommend', 'one', 'also', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'something', 'cult', 'following', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'director', 'had', 'made', 'many', 'years']",Sideways (Region 2)

Paul plays Miles, a middle-aged 8th grade english teacher who writes good novels that his agent can't find a publisher for.  Miles is also an amateur wine expert, and enjoys the spirits a little more than is good for him.  You get the sense that much of the unhappiness in his life he has brought on himself from his drinking, and his unhappiness only makes him drink so...  Despite all this, Miles seems an honestly good-hearted fellow and I felt myself pulling for him.Church plays Jack, an actor who once played a Doctor on a soap opera, but now can only get work recording incredibly fast ""fine print"" material at the end of car dealer ads.  He and Paul were roommates as freshmen in college, and although Paul has grown into a sad, balding geek, Jack retains enough of those good looks that got him on a soap - and he can't help but use those good looks to come on to the prettiest girl he spies in every building he walks into.Jack is now engaged, and Paul wants them to have a final bachelor's week in California wine country.  Paul wants his friend to develop a little appreciation for the wine.  Jack wants them both to meet willing women.Virginia Madsen plays Maya, who is a waitress working her way through Horticulture grad school.  She has met Miles on his previous trips to wine country, but what Miles doesn't know initially is that pretty Maya was divorced last year.  Maya is also an amateur wine expert and everyone in the film can tell that they are soulmates.At another winery they meet Sandra Oh as Stephanie, pouring wine and acknowledging to randy Jack that she is a bad girl and ""needs to be spanked"".  Jack pours on the soap actor charm and leaves out the fact that he's getting married on Saturday.Without being preachy, the movie provides a stark contrast between Jack, who is interested in having as much hot sweaty bedroom encounters as possible, and Miles, who is dumpy and middle-aged and hesitantly pursues a much deeper relationship with Maya.There are no moments when I laughed my head off, but the clever screenplay made me chuckle appreciatively every couple of minutes.

888913,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0007RUSGW,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[10, 20]","Sideways is an entertaining but vastly overrated film about the pleasures of life and wine. A first-rate cast deliver good, but not extraordinary performances in this tale about two men reaching middle age with not much to show but disappointment, who embark on a week long road trip through California's wine country, just as one is about to take a trip down the altar.If anyone in this film deserved an Oscar nomination it was Paul Giamatti, a terrific actor always overlooked by the Academy for his brilliant turns in independent cinema. He is constantly robbed of a nomination, and is once again shut out for this film. Sandra Oh was also robbed, the nomination instead going to Virginia Madsen, an actress I've admired since seeing Candyman, but whose performance I thought was nothing out of the ordinary. She wasn't the problem at all, it was more the fact that her role was very small and she didn't have scenes of pure emotion that Sandra Oh's character had. All the actors were good,if not special, but the wrong actors were nominated.The screenplay, written by director Alexander Payne (Sandra Oh's husband) and Jim Taylor, from the novel by Rex Pickett, is a twist on the conventional romantic comedy. One of its most wonderful qualities is that all four characters are necessary. The women are not plot conveniences, but elements in a complex romantic and even therapeutic process. It is these characters that make the movie so likeable, and different from other romantic comedies.I liked this movie, but wasn't impressed by it. Yes, I was entertained, but didn't leave the theatre a changed man that movies like Million Dollar Baby made me feel. Perhaps I have to see it again to truly appreciate it, but I just feel this was a really good film for the romantic comedy genre and nothing more. I recommend it yes, but beware, it is one of the most overrated films of the year, if not ever. Wine lovers might especially enjoy the dialogue, especially a scene between Giamanti and Madsen, who is the one scene I think got her the nomination.See this movie because it is entertaining, not because you've heard it's a masterpiece and you'll come out enjoying it.

Wanting one last fling together, Miles and Jack go on a road trip through the vineyards of California. Jack has an urgent need to sow his wild oats before he's tied down for life. Miles, just looks forward to the getaway and some extended time with his best friend. Their goals are very different. More than once, while Jack is running wild, Miles says, why can't we just relax and go back to the hotel room, maybe play some golf. He has little energy to socialize and is visibly awkward when he tries.One night, Jack and Miles go to a restaurant that Miles has been to often. Maya, a recently divorced waitress, is happy to see Miles. Maya's friend and Jack get busy sewing the last of Jack's wild oats.

888917,A16X7GKCK83WUE,B0007RUSGW,"Matthew Bratkowski ""mattster""","[5, 7]","In Sideways, Paul Giamatti plays Miles, a divorced english teacher who is hopelessly trying to get his novel published.  Miles and his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) go on a wine tasting trip as sort of a bachelor party for Jack who is a former soap opera actor and is about to get married.  Crazy adventures occur on the trip involving infidelity, love, and above all lots of wine.Giamatti is probably most recently recognized for his role in American Splendor where he played a comic book writter who was kind of a loser.  Giamatti's character in this movie has some similarities to the one in American Splendor, but Miles is more of a funny loser because he is prone to hissy fits, alcoholic silliness, and general nervousness around women.  The intelligent yet insecure character of Miles plays a good foil to that of Jack, the cool, convident ladies' man who is just looking to have some fun before he gets married.  The characters' friendship works well in the movie and enlights many instances of humor.This movie also includes contrasts between romances: a semi-serious one between Miles and Mya (Virginia Madsen), a bar-tender, and a fling between Jack and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) that is mainly for pleasure.  While watching this movie, I couldn't help but hope that the relationship between Miles and Mya would work out because they seemed so perfect for each other; at the same time I was also hoping that the relationship between Jack and Stephanie would fall apart because he as just using her.Sideways may not have won the best picture of the year and I don't really think that it deserved the award either because it is a bit formulic and maybe a bit too much of the story's plot revolves around information about wine than most viewers would not understand.  But this is a good movie and I would recommend watching it.

Each has a mid-life crisis in full swing. Miles solution has been to become a wine expert, a pursuit that gives him intellectual satisfaction. Perhaps even better, it also gives him justification to drink a great deal. While Miles is still recovering from a bitter divorce, Jack's answer is to get married. Just before the nuptials, the guys take a road trip together to California's wine country. Miles, a frustrated writer, tries to teach Jack the intricacies of wine, but Jack is more interested in the intricacies of women. For him, the trip is just an excuse to have one last fling before settling down to married life. [We suspect Jack is just kidding himself!]Giamatti and Church are excellent. They create memorable characters.

This movie is about two men who are still coming of age and despite their adult years still have much learning and growing up to do. One is a wine expert who reveals his incredible knowledge of the subject in the movie and the other is too busy chang skirts to know the differecne between a Pinot and White Zin. Essentially the two men embark on a week holiday, comprised of golf, relaxing, eating, flirting, and ofcourse drinking wine. One of the men is soon to be married but before he settles he wants to have one last fling with a woman and despite his lack luster ways he actually finds a cutie and they become intimate and a relationship begins; ofcourse she has not clue that he is to marry another woman in just a few days, OUCH! Talk about a low blow. Clearly he has much growing up to do and maybe he thinks once he sows his wild oats he will finally be able to marry and commit to one lady. The other man, his friend, doesn't approve of his cheating ways and is upset in general. He is a sympathetic character which is what i like about him. He drowns his sorrows and frustration in his beloved wine and associated wine with life. Actually wine is used as a metaphor about life in this movie.

It boasts realistic characters with real problems, and touches on the nature and meaning of friendship, romance, betrayal, etc.  The movie relies on the stunning beauty of southern California's wine region and the natural but undeniable appeal of its four leads, not computer generated effects and flavor-of-the-day ""stars"".  The result is a deeply touching but hilarious masterpiece.The cast is perfect.  Paul Giamatti has mastered the frumpy, angry white male but injects so much pathos and irony that he's always fun to watch.  Virginia Madsen reinvents herself as a quiet, thoughtful siren (although at 42 she can hardly be considered ""mature"", as described by many critics).  Sandra Oh is effective with the few lines she has, but it is wonderful to see an Asian actor portray a character who could be of any ethnicity, white, black, or whatever!  I loved the fact that there was no explanation about why she and her mother and daughter were not the same race!  The true revelation here is Thomas Haden Church.  Not sure if he really is a dumb, has-been TV star or if simply nailed the portrayal - regardless, this was THE star making performance of the year.Some may think the movie moves along too slowly, but I say enjoy it and its wonderful pace.

Miles and Jack are as different as night and day, and while Miles plans on simply having a good time with his friend, Jack fully intends to make the most of his final days of bachelorhood and has only one objective: to get laid.As they explore the vineyards, Miles and Jack encounter two women (Sandra Oh, Virginia Madsen) that they get to know over a series of double-dates. While Jack enjoys his last hurrah before saying ""I do,"" Miles finds light at the end of the tunnel with Maya, a woman who awakens feeling in him that have been dead for a long time.

Kreca ""mkreca@earthlink.net""","[11, 17]","I utterly detested this slick and glittery but pretentious and shallow attempt at a ""buddy film,"" first of all because it reminds me of the scores of insufferable, nauseating, viciously condescending yuppie ""wine snob"" phonies I have often encountered.Jack and Miles were just utterly loathsome and completely pathetic characters; their whiny immaturity,  aimless self-conscious materialism, fierce self-absorption and utter cluelessness was just awful and quite unfunny for a film that claims to be a sophisticated and deft comedy/satire--the tragic thing is that scores of people here in Southern California these days are just like those two if not worse; like Miles and Jack, they seem to quickly grow old without ever really growing up. Worse, these overgrown boys are quite thoughtlessly destructive; blithely creating meaningless tragedies all along the way while not learning much of anything useful or life-changing.What's most unfortunate is that this picture had great potential to be a clever and brutal satire lambasting the greedy, pretentious snobbery, barely concealed sadism and exhaustingly neurotic phoniness of so many upper-class (and upper-class wannabe) Southern Californians, but the director, Alex Payne (whose prior films, ""Citizen Ruth,"" ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"" were superb) seems to have dropped the ball. Two grown, unmarried, presumably heterosexual men going on a ""wine tasting"" road trip together? Face it, it's absurd, but with a different director (say, Christopher Guest or Alex Cox) it could have been hilarious, a male version of the wonderful Britcom ""Absolutely Fabulous,"" perhaps.In view of films like ""Sideways,"" it appears that over the past 30 odd years the time-honored American ""buddy film"" concept, sadly, has degenerated significantly, falling from the heights of deep, gritty and often amusing and touching studies about male friendship to the pathetic current lows of castrated, juvenile, prissy, lily-livered, mutual whining. I think of such ""buddy"" films of the past, the best of them from the 1970s (e.g., ""Scarecrow"" with Al Pacino and Gene Hackman; ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot"" with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges; ""The In-Laws"" with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk; ""Bang The Drum Slowly"" with Robert DeNiro and Michael Moriarty) and they easily stand head and shoulders above transparently self-indulgent yuppie trash like ""Sideways.""I give ""Sideways"" two stars only because it had done a fine job of capturing and reflecting the bucolic beauty of California's largely still-rural central coast.",2,"Pretentious, Shallow Nonsense",1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,2550,"['utterly', 'detested', 'slick', 'glittery', 'pretentious', 'shallow', 'attempt', 'buddy', 'film', 'first', 'scores', 'insufferable', 'nauseating', 'viciously', 'condescending', 'wine', 'snob', 'phonies', 'have', 'often', 'encountered.Jack', 'Miles', 'were', 'just', 'utterly', 'loathsome', 'completely', 'pathetic', 'characters', 'whiny', 'immaturity', 'aimless', 'self-conscious', 'materialism', 'fierce', 'self-absorption', 'utter', 'cluelessness', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'quite', 'unfunny', 'film', 'be', 'sophisticated', 'deft', 'comedy/satire', 'tragic', 'thing', 'scores', 'people', 'here', 'Southern', 'California', 'days', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'not', 'worse', 'Miles', 'Jack', 'seem', 'quickly', 'grow', 'old', 'ever', 'really', 'growing', 'up', 'Worse', 'boys', 'are', 'quite', 'thoughtlessly', 'destructive', 'blithely', 'creating', 'meaningless', 'tragedies', 'way', 'not', 'learning', 'much', 'anything', 'useful', 'life-changing.What', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'picture', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'be', 'clever', 'brutal', 'satire', 'lambasting', 'greedy', 'pretentious', 'snobbery', 'barely', 'concealed', 'sadism', 'exhaustingly', 'neurotic', 'phoniness', 'so', 'many', 'upper-class', 'upper-class', 'wannabe', 'Southern', 'Californians', 'director', 'Alex', 'Payne', 'prior', 'films', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'Election', 'Schmidt', 'were', 'superb', 'have', 'dropped', 'ball', 'Two', 'grown', 'unmarried', 'presumably', 'heterosexual', 'men', 'going', 'wine', 'tasting', 'road', 'trip', 'together', 'Face', 'absurd', 'different', 'director', 'say', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'Alex', 'Cox', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'male', 'version', 'wonderful', 'Britcom', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'view', 'films', 'Sideways', 'past', '30', 'odd', 'years', 'time-honored', 'American', 'buddy', 'film', 'concept', 'sadly', 'degenerated', 'significantly', 'falling', 'heights', 'deep', 'gritty', 'often', 'amusing', 'touching', 'studies', 'male', 'friendship', 'pathetic', 'current', 'lows', 'castrated', 'juvenile', 'prissy', 'lily-livered', 'mutual', 'whining', 'think', 'such', 'buddy', 'films', 'past', 'best', '1970s', 'e.g.', 'Scarecrow', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Thunderbolt', 'Lightfoot', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'In-Laws', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'Drum', 'Slowly', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'easily', 'stand', 'head', 'shoulders', 'transparently', 'self-indulgent', 'yuppie', 'trash', 'Sideways', 'give', 'Sideways', 'two', 'stars', 'only', 'had', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'capturing', 'reflecting', 'bucolic', 'beauty', 'California', 'largely', 'still-rural', 'central', 'coast']",Sideways (Region 2)

If you see the DVD version, check out the outtakes, which I think really help to understand the craft of editing a great film.

I still enjoy a nice merlot but I have to admit that I now know about and buy pinot noir which I did not do before I first saw SIDEWAYS. (One wonders if pinot noir vineyards had an investment in this film. Hmmmm....) Paul Giamatti plays Miles, a hyper, twitchy would-be novelist, recently divorced, and Thomas Haden Church plays his best friend Jack, a laid-back, hunky, second-rate actor. Both take a boys-only, wine-tasting excursion together through the vineyards of California. For Miles this is an opportunity perhaps to contemplate his failed marriage. For Jack, it is his last time to get laid before getting married. Miles, the nuerotic nerd, is a serious student of wines and Jack, the shallow stud, is a serious student of women. One wonders how these two complete opposites ever became best friends. But, putting convenient and somewhat strange screenplay logic aside, Miles and Jack together find adventure, romance and redemption on the road. I have seen SIDEWAYS twice; the second time I enjoyed it more than the first viewing. It is a film that grows on you; a character study and a film with some depth, the perfect antidote to mindless thrillers. The scene where Miles and a recently divorced acquaintance of Miles, played by Virginia Madsen, passionately discuss what they like about wine is worth the price of admission.

There is more drama than comedy, though, as middle-aged pals Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) set off on a week-long trip through California wine country just before Jack is to be married. Miles is a wine fanatic -connoisseur would be an understatement- intent on sending his friend off ""in style"" by guiding him through the finest wines California has to offer. Jack has other ideas. He wants to sow his wild oats before plunging into matrimony, and he thinks Miles should do the same. Miles has been morose, self-deafeatist, and uncomfortable around the opposite sex since his divorce 2 years before. Through their adventures, they meet two women: Maya (Virginia Madsen), a soulful old acquaintance of Miles who enjoys wine as much as he does. And Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who pours wine at vineyard and likes adventure as much as Jack.Every once in a while a ""food movie"" comes along, but I don't recall ever seeing a ""drink movie"" before now. ""Sideways"" is a drink movie, not to be confused with a ""drunk movie"", although there is a bit of that too. It does for wine what ""Big Night"" and ""Babette's Feast"" did for food. Oenophiles will probably enjoy ""Sideways"" for the passion it expresses for wine. I found the film only mildly comic, though, and the humor generally relies on Miles' neuroses or Jack's insensitivity. ""Sideways"" fault is that it makes dysfunction its central gag and plot device. Miles is simply not someone you'd want to be around if he were real. The story revolves around the men, but Maya and Stephanie are more interesting characters. ""Sideways"" is a solid adaptation, but 2 hours of characters who are essentially annoying wears on the audience, even if what they do is amusing.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005 release): Bonus features include 7 deleted scenes, 1 featurette, a theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary. The ""Behind-the-Scenes Featurette"" (6 minutes) features interviews with the 4 principle actors and director Alexander Payne in which they primarily discuss characters.

888938,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B0007RUSGW,Missing Person,"[6, 10]","Director Alexander Payne followed up his 2002 masterpiece ""About Schmidt"" (starring Jack Nicholson) with this fine 2004 film ""Sideways"".  Like the three previous movies Payne has directed himself, the screenplay for ""Sideways"" was written by him and Jim Taylor.  It's similar to ""About Schmidt"" in the way that it straddles the line between being a comedy and a drama, but ""Sideways"" is considerably more lightweight.There are many positive aspects to this movie.  Payne and Taylor once again demonstrate their incredible knack for rich dialogue, as well as sly and occasionally over-the-top hilarity.  It's great to see former Wings star Thomas Haden Church get a role that he can really go to town with.  Virginia Madsen is also wonderful, delivering a sensitive and tender performance.""Sideways"" does work very well as a comedy, but overall, it's not a full-blown masterpiece.  The basic plot really is kind of stupid and hard to take seriously, which makes some of the more 'serious' scenes a little eyeroll-inducing in context, particularly ones later in the movie featuring Thomas Haden Church.  I mean, the Haden Church character really is quite a knucklehead.The movie also comes across as strangely incomplete.  Madsen should have been given some more screen time--like I said before, her performance here is terrific, and at the end of the movie, it just feels like we haven't seen quite enough of her.If you love ""About Schmidt"" and ""Election"", ""Sideways"" is a must see.  It's unfair to say that ""Sideways"" is just another 'road movie' or 'buddy flick', but those remarks are understandable in the sense that I think it does lean a little too far toward the 'buddy flick' stereotype for its own good.

Carrying a red hot torch for his ex-wife who has married a man who is handsome, rich and successful, everything Miles is NOT. Trying to become something of consequence before he dies, such as a novelist. But such a bad novelist that he can't even describe what his book is ABOUT to Maya! So how's his agent supposed to market this mishmash and who is his readership? He's a failure, looking at more failure in his future. Who doesn't know a guy like this? Maybe he's YOU!That's why he drowns his life in drink and that's why he's a wine snob- just so he can attempt to lift his station in life above what it and he really is. Miles can't write because he hasn't LIVED! He's afraid to live. He stands on the side of the pool called Life and just paces, too afraid to jump in and then has contempt for Jack because that dude climbs to the highest diving board and does a cannonball straight down into Life!I don't believe I've ever seen anything with Paul Giamatti in it before and I am an instant fan! He got right into the skin of this complex character!Jack- Yes, the King of Pig Men! I've dated pigs like this and worked with them. Always on the make! Always the Big Lie when it comes to women. It's a pathetic game to them. Young women should watch this movie to see guys like this in action. But Jack was funny! Jack is an uncomplicated happy dog that seeks out life and bites big chunks out of it. When Jack leaves his wallet at the waitress's dirty house (if you live like a slob, you SHOULD be outed in a movie!), he forces Miles to go in to retrieve it. This is probably the first time Miles had ever done anything courageous.Jack forces the sulky, reluctant Miles to LIVE!This is a road movie about facing the things in your life that need changing if you're ever going to move ahead, instead of sitting, drinking and  moaning about it like Miles in the beginning.I did not agreee with the scene of Miles stealing money from his mother or reading magazines like Barely Legal, but the rest of the movie is Real Life. People's careers and lives, more often than not, don't turn out the way we planned them as kids. Life happens and it ain't always happy ever after. But this movie does have a happy ending and Miles' life did make a turn because he got the backbone to grab for happiness instead of dwelling on his past failures.

888955,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0007RUSGW,Nicholas Carroll,"[4, 12]","I made the mistake of watching this film after I had just finished reading the novel, after all the critical acclaim and awards...which meant that I couldn't experience it fresh, without all the hype. Thus, I had to watch it a few times before I could really appreciate this film for what it is...a tale of two buddies in the last days of their friendship before one of them gets married off. First, let me say that if you haven't read the novel and you love this film, then I hope you will buy and read the novel. There were so many amusing scenes left out, which only added to my disappointment upon first viewing...but I understand that they had to cut a lot of things out to keep the film to a decent running time.This film has plenty going for it: a fine cast, a great and complimentary soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, awesome location, and a clever script. Unfortunately, the story shows a rather unsavory side to men, which I hope women won't think ALL MEN have some compulsary need to have one last affair before getting married. Both men are rather pathetic and its surprising that they have remained friends for so long (from freshmen in college through middle age). Paul Giamattie is simply great in his role as an introverted loser who lacks confidence with women and tends to go to the dark side of pessimistic outlook. He has a great sparring partner in Thomas Harden Church, who plays an extroverted, womanizing lout with a diminishing acting career. In the Santa Ynez valley on a wine tasting tour, hanging out at the Windmill Motel near the Danish tourist town of Solvang, they meet two ladies and begin their unique ways of flirtation. Thomas plays the more confident one of the two and quickly has Stephanie (Sandra Oh) wanting to get jump in the sack with him. The scenes between Paul and Virginia Madsen are the best in the film...as their dialogue about life and using wine as a metaphor represents a cool style of flirtation. Paul's character simply is slower when it comes to attracting women, and its interesting to hear Virginia comparing the quality of a wine and when it begins its decline. Is she talking about wine or him? She's brilliant and the best thing about this film.The scene I didn't like, however, comes near the end of their sojourn when Jack (Thomas Harden Church) begs his friend to retrieve an important item left at a one night stand's house. Although that scene was in the book...I was shocked by what they actually show the audience. It does add a bit of humor (on the gross-out side) but I thought it was unnecessary. Because of that scene, I couldn't recommend this film to many people I'd otherwise recommend it to (their sensibilities would not find much humor in it). Other than that...it was a good film. For those who like or love this film, I would recommend you to read the novel by Rex Pickett. It is so much better and you'll gain a fuller appreciation for the characters. Plus, the film made some changes in the beginning and the ending, as well as changing Stephanie from the novel's character of ""Terra"".

Jack, however, sees the trip as a final opportunity to sow his very wild oats before entering into the eternal servitude of marriage.

It was passionate and interesting.Also, let me add my voice to the chorus of people who were surprised when Paul Giamatti was not nominated for an Academy Award last year. He did a great job in Sideways. What I liked best about Miles was that he was a contradictory character, like so many of us are. He did bad things, like steal money from his mother and lie to his best friend, but he was also capable of great loyalty, self-examination, and devotion.

Jack (Thomas Haden-Church) is a part-time actor and full-time ladies man who is soon to be married in to a wealthy family.As best man, Miles, decides that a tour of California's wine country and an introduction to the finer things in life is the perfect wedding gift for his best friend.

If you want to know more about the movies plot read the next review, I'm sure it will be helpful.Some may accuse the plot as a bit too plodding but when taken into consideration the plodding lives of our two antiheros, it's a perfect complement.  The warm tones and stylistic visuals of the vinyards will give you the free feel of driving through the valley yourself.  Your characters aren't completely original but they way they are spun off by these four actors is nothing short of brilliant.Although Sideways may not be as side splitting as you might hope it's a delightful introspective of a friendship that is preparing to be changed forever.

There are many hints about Miles in the dialog, plot action, and scenery that lesser viewers (who were merely bored) failed to notice.  What book was being read from in the classroom?  Notice anything about the class?  Why exactly didn't Miles want to hang out with his sister and mother the next day?  Why was he driving an old, faded Saab?

These two old college roommates are perfect examples of failed adults and latent adolescents. They drift through life working sporadic ""careers"" while telling themselves that their true callings are really something more meaningful. They aren't. Don't expect a buddy comedy here- even though it was marketed as that in some areas._The film starts out with our two ""heroes"" heading of for a weekend of wine tasting and golf. It ends up as a prolonged ordeal of illicit sex and drunken irresponsible behavior. I know that sounds funny, but it turns painful. You see, both Miles and Jack are walking train wrecks. Jack (a would-be actor) is apparently a male nymphomaniac who is absolutely incapable of showing restraint by not bedding every woman he meets (he is engaged to get married immediately after the trip.) Miles (a would-be writer) on the other hand is a passive train wreck incapable of not being swept along by the actions of others. Neither is an adult (demonstrated by the fact that the trip is financed by Miles visiting his 70 year old mother on the way- and stealing the money for the trip from her dresser.) While the trip starts with high aspirations in the best wineries of the Napa Valley, it ends with Miles surreptitiously swilling wine from a paper cup in a fast food restaurant. It would seem that the difference between wine connoisseur and wino is less than one would imagine- the moral difference is even less._Oh, by the way, while there are a few writers' names thrown around there is never any real discussion of anything of a true, meaningful intellectual nature- this film is no ""My Dinner with Andre.""_I primarily enjoyed this film because of its shining accuracy in depicting so many of the people I see around me.

Jack must run 5 miles through the countryside back to the motel nekkid as a jaybird, through an OSTRICH FARM! That's FUNNY! He said they were really mean.2.

He co-erces Miles into sneaking into the filthy house to recover the wallet.Miles sneaks into the bedroom while the walrus fat waitress and tow-truck driver are having some hot ""punishment sex"" and snags the wallet, but the fat tow-truck driver chases him outside. Watching the fat guy run BUCK NAKED towards the car and down the street with his manhood swinging in the wind is hilarious!3.

Miles last hope for redemption in life is that his novel will get published which is currently being shopped around by his agent.

Miles has plans of a week long low key male bonding trip but Jack has different plans. Jack envisions a week of chasing women and cutting loose and the contrasting bachelor party ideas collide as the two head out to wine country...""Sideways"" is not for everyone but I loved this movie. Although classified as a comedy I think of this as more of a character examination movie. Sideways is a character driven movie and is primarily about Miles as he attempts to deal with the shambles he feels his life has become while at the same time trying to be a gracious host to Jack as Jack stomps all over Miles plans for their week in wine Country. As you watch you see Miles go through an emotional roller coaster ride as he deals with Jack who is almost his polar opposite, tries to get over his ex wife and looks for something positive to hope for in the future as he indulges in the last thing he truly enjoys which is drinking good wine.The Good: The acting all around was great. Paul Giamatti was absolutely perfect for the Miles character and Thomas Haden Church was a perfect to play off of Gimatti's Miles and the character dynamic between the 2 was great. You can't help but to pull for Miles as runs into one pitfall after another usually created by Jack.The score for this movie was superbly done. The music perfectly accents Miles and his moods and feelings. With the combination of Gimatti's acting and the score I felt like I knew exactly what was going on in Miles' head.The Bad: Nothing memorable.Overall: This is not for everyone so be warned. This is not an overtly funny movie even though it is labeled as a comedy.

The characters are completely evil or saintly.  The characters are incredibly beautiful and rich with fabulous possessions or incredibly poor and yet noble.  The events are incredibly emotional, e.g., violent deaths or long hoped-for births.Sideways eschews the crutch of taking us out of everyday life first.  The characters are not unbelievably good-looking or wealthy.  They live in apartments and drive 5-year-old cars.  There are no explosions or murders.  Given these constraints one can still hope for a movie that makes us laugh, that tells us things about the human condition, and that makes us more sympathetic to the foibles of our friends and familes.  Sideways delivers on those hopes.  It is a great achievement.  Certainly the best movie of 2004.

If I wanted to be depressed, I'd hang around clinically depressed people more often and not seek them out at the movies where I go to be entertained.Thomas Hayden Church's character Jack was a foul-mouthed, libidinous, amoral friend of the somewhat less foul-mouthed, sad sack ""anti-hero"" Miles, played by Paul Giamotti.  I guess that some guys have one of those friends like Jack who continually goof up their friend's lives and maybe Miles hangs around him because he's just so gosh-darn fun to be around when he's ruining his possessions and begging him to join him on his juvenile sexual excursions.  Maybe, but fortunately I don't know anyone like that and I resent the implication that men behave this way when we're hanging around our buddies.While the plot moved along nicely, I found that I didn't like these characters, nor care what happened to them after 45 minutes.  Also, I could not get over the liberal use of the ""f"" word.  Was it really necessary to include that in every other scene?  I don't speak that way, my friends and coworkers don't speak that way, and it gets old after a few minutes to hear these allegedly educated male and female characters swear and curse as though they were high school boys.The one bit of praise that I have for ""Sideways"" was the dialogue (minus the ""f"" word).  It sounded as though it was natural conversation and Virginia Madsen was particularly good.  I chuckled a few times during the movie, but for the life of me I cannot remember them now.As an aside, what was the deal with Stephanie's place?  Do most people live in ramshackle hovels or am I just being picky?Finally, maybe I'm just too un-hip to get it, but to what did ""Sideways"" refer?  Was it some sort of wine reference?

Miles is a depressed divorcee who is an English teacher, but is trying to get a novel published while Jack is a womanizing former soap opera star that is making a living doing voiceovers.  Miles is also a major oenophile and wine plays a huge part in the film.  Miles & Jack go out to dinner at a restaurant Miles frequents while he's in the area and they meet a waitress, Mya (Virginia Madsen), that Jack tries to hook Miles up with.  Jack falls for a server at a vineyard, Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who ends up being friends with Mya and the four have dinner and end up spending time together.  Through it all Miles can't break out of his depression and Jack ends up paying a price for his sexual dalliances.  All four lead actors are excellent, but Mr. Giamatti is the heart and soul of the film.  He gives a brilliant performance and his lack of an Academy Award nomination will go down as one of the biggest snubs in history.  The one problem with the film is that the last half-hour is quite slow and doesn't live up to rest of the picture.  Other than that, Sideways is an excellent film.

It's a lot of little things (along with an apparent hangover) that gives us this impression.  That's one of the keys to ""Sideways""; the many subtle little things that enhance the movie.We come to understand that the man is picking up a former college roommate for a two-some bachelor party weekend in the California wine district.  The ex-roommate has a personality; our main character seems to lack anything of the sort.They arrive at their motel and start checking out the scene and we gradually get to know more and more about these guys.  The ex-roommate is out to have fun; the other has planned how they will have fun.  One is spontaneous and the other is calculated and that is another key to ""Sideways""; the way these two play off each other.There's a lot of funny things that take place in the movie.  I would categorize ""Sideways"" as a comedy.  However, the part that impressed me the most was the romantic aspect of the movie.

He also sleeps with an 18 year old waitress whose giant husband chases him down the street when he runs back to get his wallet that he has left behind. Miles, his best friend, is constantly moping about his failed marriage and crappy novel.

888985,A2WL02ENWFU9PM,B0007RUSGW,Rex Macaroe,"[7, 10]","Sideways starts off like your typical behavioral comedy. We meet the main characters and become familiar with their little eccentricities as they go through the motions of a normal miserable day. We meet Miles, a forty-something wine enthusiast who really makes an effort to be friendly to the people around. It's dishonest, and we can see that easily. But there's something about the way he makes small talk which makes him easy to empathize with from the get-go.His friend Jack is about to be married. Like Miles, Jack is kind to those around him. But where Miles seems more miserably isolated, Jack is an egotistical jerk. Still, like all great egotistical jerks in comedies, we secretly want to be like him, to carry that confidence that eludes us. We want to be antiheroes.Before Jack's wedding, Miles and Jack decide to take a week-long trip to wine-country. On the way, they stop at the home of Miles' mother, a sweet lady whose good intentions often lead to more misery. During dinner, Miles excuses himself to steal about $1000 from his mother's bedroom. This is a shock, but typical of the way children exploit their parents. Miles needed the money for the trip. We see the shame in his eyes, but also the helplessness. He seems beyond the point of redemption, but from what exactly?When he returns to dinner we find out. Like all mother's she tells Miles that he needs to get married, but while our brains are processing this cliche she continues one word longer than expected, saying ""You should get married again."" Suddenly all the pieces fall into place, and we understand how he came to be so heartbroken.There's something about Miles that I really connected with. He just wants to have a peaceful weekend, but circumstance demands that he puts up Jack's bullsh*t antics. The film never feels like it's exploiting Jack for comedic effect, but his utter lack of inhibition allows us to greater experience Miles' listlessness. He lives from wine sample to wine sample, percieving a poetry in the taste that no one else can appreciate. This is the one thing that keeps him going, but it also keeps him isolated from those around him.In a pivotal scene in the film, Miles ""drinks and dials"" his ex-wife who, as cruel fate would have it, has remarried. The lenswork in this scene awed me beyond belief my first time viewing it. Miles paces as he talks on the phone, to and from the camera's point of view. He stays in focus, but his his movements cause the background to drift between different levels of focus. As well as offering an intimite look at Miles' detachment from the world, it also gave the distinct impression of being drunk.A lot of people call Sideways overrated, but the way I see it, they just have an underdeveloped pallette and can't appreciate its bittersweet taste. In my opinion, this is the best film of 2004 (Kill Bill: Volume 2 is inferior unless combined with Volume 1).",5,"""It tastes so f*cking good""",1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,2906,"['Sideways', 'typical', 'behavioral', 'comedy', 'meet', 'main', 'characters', 'become', 'familiar', 'little', 'eccentricities', 'go', 'motions', 'normal', 'miserable', 'day', 'meet', 'Miles', 'forty-something', 'wine', 'enthusiast', 'who', 'really', 'effort', 'be', 'friendly', 'people', 'dishonest', 'can', 'see', 'easily', 'something', 'way', 'small', 'talk', 'easy', 'empathize', 'get-go.His', 'friend', 'Jack', 'be', 'married', 'Miles', 'Jack', 'kind', 'where', 'Miles', 'more', 'miserably', 'isolated', 'Jack', 'egotistical', 'jerk', 'Still', 'great', 'egotistical', 'jerks', 'comedies', 'secretly', 'want', 'be', 'carry', 'confidence', 'want', 'be', 'antiheroes.Before', 'Jack', 'wedding', 'Miles', 'Jack', 'decide', 'take', 'week-long', 'trip', 'wine-country', 'way', 'stop', 'home', 'Miles', 'mother', 'sweet', 'lady', 'good', 'intentions', 'often', 'lead', 'more', 'misery', 'dinner', 'Miles', 'steal', '1000', 'mother', 'bedroom', 'shock', 'typical', 'way', 'children', 'exploit', 'parents', 'Miles', 'needed', 'money', 'trip', 'see', 'shame', 'eyes', 'also', 'helplessness', 'point', 'redemption', 'what', 'exactly', 'When', 'dinner', 'find', 'out', 'mother', 'Miles', 'get', 'married', 'brains', 'are', 'processing', 'cliche', 'one', 'word', 'longer', 'expected', 'saying', 'should', 'get', 'married', 'again', 'Suddenly', 'pieces', 'fall', 'place', 'understand', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'so', 'something', 'Miles', 'really', 'connected', 'just', 'have', 'peaceful', 'weekend', 'circumstance', 'demands', 'up', 'Jack', 'bullsh*t', 'antics', 'film', 'never', 'exploiting', 'Jack', 'comedic', 'effect', 'utter', 'lack', 'inhibition', 'greater', 'experience', 'Miles', 'listlessness', 'wine', 'sample', 'wine', 'sample', 'percieving', 'poetry', 'taste', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'appreciate', 'one', 'thing', 'going', 'also', 'isolated', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'film', 'Miles', 'drinks', 'dials', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'cruel', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'remarried', 'lenswork', 'scene', 'awed', 'belief', 'first', 'time', 'viewing', 'Miles', 'phone', 'camera', 'point', 'view', 'focus', 'movements', 'cause', 'background', 'drift', 'different', 'levels', 'focus', 'As', 'well', 'offering', 'intimite', 'look', 'Miles', 'detachment', 'world', 'also', 'gave', 'distinct', 'impression', 'being', 'drunk.A', 'lot', 'people', 'call', 'Sideways', 'overrated', 'way', 'see', 'just', 'have', 'underdeveloped', 'pallette', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'bittersweet', 'taste', 'opinion', 'best', 'film', '2004', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Volume', '2', 'inferior', 'combined', 'Volume', '1']",Sideways (Region 2)

With reasonably high expectations, a comfortable chair and an open mind, I sat back to enjoy this film's much talked about endearing quirkyness. Ouch. Despite the sometimes richly descriptive dialog, there is little chance the average viewer will exit a viewing armed with a new-found appreciation for Chardonnay.....Charolais maybe. We've been down this path before. This film ranks right up there with ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" as examples of shamelessly overhyped and medocre product trotted out by a well oiled and savvy media machine to be presented as a cinematic version of a four course feast. Middle aged angst can be fertile ground for satire but I have to reasonably ask just what is so funny about the central character of Miles, (Paul Giamatti) a divorced, depressed borderline alcoholic prone to occasional violence, a high school teacher who consumes ""barely legal"" porn and with some premeditation, steals money from his elderly mother to subsidize a road trip with his boyhood friend?  Then there is Jack, (Thomas Haden Church) a fading voice-over actor mere days from being wed.  Jack is driven with childish and mindless abandon to copulate with every willing consort he can possibly seduce before his impending nuptials. I suppose the fact that responsible condom use by Jack  emphasized more than once in this film makes his unrestrained behavior all the more endearing and acceptable. Hmm. Alternatively, I was easily impressed and enchanted by the gifted and beautiful Virginia Madsen in her effortless turn as Maya, a sensitive and introspective wine country waitress who is inexplicably attracted to Miles. Madsen is one talented and woefully underemployed actress that should be high on Hollywood's A list. Sandra Oh played Stephanie, an unwed mother searching for love and was considerably more appealing than the cosmopolitan lesbian mom she portrayed in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". Much comment has been given over to the male full frontal nudity that supposedly shattered conventional taboos about such things in mainstream film and I will concede to its mildy amusing if totally ridiculous context though. All in all, 3 stars is all I could honestly muster even though I liked all of the actors and some of the dialog. We all read reviews...the opinions of others in the hope of validating our preconcieved  expectations. I wish I could have been a bit more supportive of this film but there you have it.  I've said enough.  By the closing credits, you are either going to love this movie or scratch your head in mild bemusement as to what the fuss is all about.  Sigh.

How interesting would a movie be with 2 perfect buddies taking a trip, enjoying wine, and then going home?  C'mon.  Try to think a little critically here.I found this to be a strongly entertaining and funny movie about two ""FLAWED"" men who are lost in the world of relationships.  One is introverted and withdrawn--deeper--the other is extroverted and fun, but just as lost.The extroverted one, played beautifully by Thomas Haden Church (of ""Wings"" fame) can get a woman in bed, no problem, but fails to value and understand intimacy.The introverted one, played by Giamatti is extremely neurotic and self-conscious, but has an attractive and undying passion for wine.  One of his most memorable moments has him expressing why he loves ""Pinot Noir"" due to the effort it takes to nurture and grow a healthy Pinot Noir grape.  It's metaphorical for how he now realizes he should have approached his now over marriage.  Ironically, Giamatti, although nearly crippled by regret and neurosis, grows more and exposes his feelings with more honesty than Haden Church's character, who just sleeps around.Watching the characters develop, make mistakes, and grow is what changes a viewer who's paying attention.  I learned from this movie.  I identified with some of the flaws of the characters.The beauty of the wine, countryside, and lovely women only adds to the entertainment value of this gorgeous movie.

888994,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0007RUSGW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[13, 28]","Sideways (Alexander Payne, 2004)According to IMDB, Sideways won ninety-four awards worldwide, and was nominated for over a score more, including Best Picture and Best Director at the Academy Awards. Having now seen it, I cannot for the life of me understand why. This is a romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor funny. Its pacing is interminable, its characters stupid, its script (adapted by Payne from Rex Pickett's novel) an interesting if failed attempt at... something. I could never quite figure out what.Plot: Jack (Wings' Thomas Haden Church) is about to get married, and his friend Miles (Paul Giamatti, recently of The Hawk Is Dying) takes him on the ultimate bachelor party: a week in Napa wine country. There, the two run into Miles' old friend Maya (The Haunting in Connecticut's Virginia Madsen) and her party-girl friend Stephanie (Sandra Oh of Grey's Anatomy). Jack, in the pursuit of getting Miles hooked up with the recently-divorced Maya, finds himself hooked up with Stephanie, which leads to a possible crisis in his future; does he want to marry the safe girlfriend at home, or drop everything and ride off into the sunset with Stephanie? And meanwhile, can Miles grow enough of a spine to finally woo Maya, who's obviously attracted to him? Oh, and I should add that all of these characters (save Jack, who could care less) know far more about wine than you or I ever will, and never let you forget it.Now, because it's been addressed in a couple of reviews I've read, I'll start off by saying that my problem with these characters is not that they are, in the main, hateful, depraved beasts. I generally love movies with hateful, depraved beasts as characters (viz., for example, The Sweet Smell of Success). No, my problem with these characters is one that literary types know as the golden rule: these characters, with one exception, do not change. And that one exception is not Miles; he's as spineless at the end of the movie as he is in the beginning. (I hope that's not a spoiler.) Unless he feels there's no chance he'll get caught, Miles takes no initiative unless he's prodded to the point where he has no other choice, from the first scene to the last. As Miles is the center of the movie, that he doesn't change is the cardinal sin.Not that the movie doesn't have other problems. The pacing is constantly undermined by the movie stopping to talk wine. Which, I guess, is fine if you're a wine snob. And yes, I do understand that the wine is being used as a metaphor. I'd find it hard not to; it's constant, heavy-handed, and just as much hammering you with the message as it would be if he just came out with it (as he did, for example, in Election; despite that, Election is by far the better movie. Relatively, of course). I'd say that that makes the movie only worthwhile for wine snobs, but this is obviously not the case, given the number of people who seem to enjoy it. Unless there are a whole lot more wine snobs in America than I think there are.I was planning on going on, but why bother? I'm sure you can tell where I'm going with this. Terrible movie, only worth watching because Virginia Madsen is, in general, the best thing about any movie she's in. Never has that been more the case than it is here. *",1,"I hated, hated, hated... oh, you get the idea.",1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,3258,"['Sideways', 'Alexander', 'Payne', '2004', 'According', 'IMDB', 'Sideways', 'won', 'ninety-four', 'awards', 'worldwide', 'was', 'nominated', 'score', 'more', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'can', 'not', 'life', 'understand', 'why', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'funny', 'pacing', 'interminable', 'characters', 'stupid', 'script', 'adapted', 'Payne', 'Rex', 'Pickett', 'novel', 'interesting', 'failed', 'attempt', 'something', 'could', 'never', 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what.Plot', 'Jack', 'Wings', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'get', 'married', 'friend', 'Miles', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'recently', 'Hawk', 'Is', 'Dying', 'ultimate', 'bachelor', 'party', 'week', 'Napa', 'wine', 'country', 'two', 'run', 'Miles', 'old', 'friend', 'Maya', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'party-girl', 'friend', 'Stephanie', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'Jack', 'pursuit', 'getting', 'Miles', 'hooked', 'up', 'recently-divorced', 'Maya', 'hooked', 'up', 'Stephanie', 'possible', 'crisis', 'future', 'want', 'marry', 'safe', 'girlfriend', 'home', 'drop', 'everything', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'Stephanie', 'meanwhile', 'can', 'Miles', 'grow', 'enough', 'spine', 'finally', 'woo', 'Maya', 'who', 'obviously', 'attracted', 'Oh', 'should', 'add', 'characters', 'save', 'Jack', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'know', 'far', 'more', 'wine', 'ever', 'will', 'never', 'let', 'forget', 'it.Now', 'been', 'addressed', 'couple', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', ""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'problem', 'characters', 'not', 'are', 'main', 'hateful', 'depraved', 'beasts', 'generally', 'love', 'movies', 'hateful', 'depraved', 'beasts', 'characters', 'viz.', 'example', 'Sweet', 'Smell', 'Success', 'No', 'problem', 'characters', 'one', 'literary', 'types', 'know', 'golden', 'rule', 'characters', 'one', 'exception', 'do', 'not', 'change', 'one', 'exception', 'not', 'Miles', 'spineless', 'end', 'movie', 'beginning', 'hope', 'not', 'spoiler', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'get', 'caught', 'Miles', 'initiative', 'prodded', 'point', 'where', 'other', 'choice', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'Miles', 'center', 'movie', ""n't"", 'change', 'cardinal', 'sin.Not', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'problems', 'pacing', 'constantly', 'undermined', 'movie', 'stopping', 'talk', 'wine', 'Which', 'guess', 'fine', ""'re"", 'wine', 'snob', 'yes', 'do', 'understand', 'wine', 'being', 'used', 'metaphor', ""'d"", 'find', 'hard', 'not', 'constant', 'heavy-handed', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'hammering', 'message', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'example', 'Election', 'Election', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'Relatively', 'course', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'wine', 'snobs', 'obviously', 'not', 'case', 'given', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'are', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'wine', 'snobs', 'America', 'think', 'are.I', 'was', 'planning', 'going', 'why', 'bother', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'tell', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'Terrible', 'movie', 'only', 'worth', 'watching', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'general', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'Never', 'been', 'more', 'case', 'here', '*']",Sideways (Region 2)

Two ex-college room mates get in the car and hop off to the Coastal Wine Region of Southern California.  It doesn't take too long to figure out the two men, Miles and Jack, are not the finest examples of human beings.  They openly drink champagne in the car.  Miles steals cash from his mother in a brief stopover.  Jack is getting married on the upcoming Saturday and he sees this trip as a means to let loose his carnal desires.  It gets worse as the trip goes on.  Each is a self-absorbed loser, but each in different way.Most films of this type will have one or both of the characters ""grow"" as the trip progresses.  This is not the case here.  When all is said and done, the two end up no different than how they started.  This is why the film is titled ""Sideways"" as the characters do not move forward.  This is probably why some viewers have trouble with this film.  It doesn't fit the mold.I like the film's attention to detail - particularly the accuracy of the locations as I am familiar with this region.  The interaction between the two main characters and the women they meet is engaging.  Every one of them seems very real to me as they each remind me of people I know or knew.

889001,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0007RUSGW,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 5]","Alexander Payne`s ""Sideways"" is what is known in the movie business as a ""Little Movie That Could,"" a low budget, independent film without major stars or dazzling special effects that, nevertheless, achieves a measure of success at the box office and, in this case at least, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture of the year.Based on the novel by Rex Pickett, ""Sideways"" tells the story of two middle-aged men, Miles and Jack, who head to the wine country of Central California for one final fling before Jack gets married.  Miles is an aspiring writer whose recent failures in life have left him bruised, cynical and deeply depressed.  In fact, he feels like a loser on two fronts, both as an author and as a husband, for he has yet to have a single work of his published, and he has recently gotten divorced from a woman whom he obviously still loves deeply and whom he can't quite seem to let go of.  The one aspect of life in which Miles really seems to excel and in which his passion is given free rein is his connoisseurship of fine wine.  His buddy, Jack, is a has-been TV actor who has spent the last few years doing voiceover work for pharmaceutical commercials.  Jack wants his final week as a bachelor to be a non-stop orgy of wine, women and song, but Miles prefers a quiet week of three parts wine tasting to one part self pity.Like a rare, vintage Pinot Noir, ""Sideways"" is a film best appreciated by those with a finely developed taste for the subtle and offbeat.  What often happens with a ""small"" film that achieves an unexpectedly wide crossover success is that it tends to suffer a certain critical backlash from people who go into it with soaring expectations and come out wondering what all the fuss is about.  The ideal way to experience a film like ""Sideways"" is to allow it to sneak up on you, to let it catch you unawares with its uniqueness and charm.  But since none of us can turn back time to that particular moment of nascent discovery, we are forced to watch it through the filter of our own preconceived notions and expectations.All this is preparatory to saying that ""Sideways"" is a very enjoyable little film for those willing to give it a chance.  Not only are the premise and the setting novel and unique, but the film boasts some of the finest ensemble acting in any movie of recent years.  Paul Giamatti, long one of our most talented and underrated actors, gives a performance of tremendous understatement and restraint, creating an entire character as much through facial expressions and body language as through dialogue.  Miles isn't even all that likeable at times - he actually steals money from his own mother on her birthday then leaves without saying goodbye - but his lack of self-image, his clear-eyed rationality and his puppy dog vulnerability win us over anyway.  As the playboy, Jack, Thomas Hayden Church reveals a layer of sensitivity buried under all that cold-blooded crassness.  Playing the two women who enter into their lives that week, Sandra Oh and, especially, Virginia Madsen provide a sweetness and warmth that contrasts nicely with these two emotionally stunted middle-aged ""losers.""In a perfect blending of form and content, Payne and co-author Jim Taylor have created a tasty mixture of revelatory conversation, understated humor and lyrical camerawork.  So sit back, uncork a bottle of your favorite vintage and enjoy the aperitif that is ""Sideways.""",4,a mellow elixir that goes down easy,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,3418,"['Alexander', 'Payne', 's', 'Sideways', 'what', 'known', 'movie', 'business', 'Little', 'Movie', 'That', 'Could', 'low', 'budget', 'independent', 'film', 'major', 'stars', 'dazzling', 'special', 'effects', 'nevertheless', 'measure', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'case', 'least', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year.Based', 'novel', 'Rex', 'Pickett', 'Sideways', 'story', 'two', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'Miles', 'Jack', 'who', 'head', 'wine', 'country', 'Central', 'California', 'one', 'final', 'fling', 'Jack', 'married', 'Miles', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'recent', 'failures', 'life', 'have', 'left', 'bruised', 'cynical', 'deeply', 'depressed', 'fact', 'loser', 'two', 'fronts', 'author', 'husband', 'yet', 'have', 'single', 'work', 'published', 'recently', 'gotten', 'divorced', 'woman', 'whom', 'obviously', 'still', 'deeply', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'let', 'go', 'one', 'aspect', 'life', 'Miles', 'really', 'excel', 'passion', 'given', 'free', 'rein', 'connoisseurship', 'fine', 'wine', 'buddy', 'Jack', 'has-been', 'TV', 'actor', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'doing', 'voiceover', 'work', 'pharmaceutical', 'commercials', 'Jack', 'final', 'week', 'bachelor', 'be', 'non-stop', 'orgy', 'wine', 'women', 'song', 'Miles', 'quiet', 'week', 'three', 'parts', 'wine', 'tasting', 'one', 'part', 'rare', 'vintage', 'Pinot', 'Noir', 'Sideways', 'film', 'best', 'appreciated', 'finely', 'developed', 'taste', 'subtle', 'offbeat', 'What', 'often', 'small', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'wide', 'crossover', 'success', 'suffer', 'certain', 'critical', 'backlash', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'soaring', 'expectations', 'come', 'out', 'wondering', 'what', 'fuss', 'about', 'ideal', 'way', 'experience', 'film', 'Sideways', 'allow', 'sneak', 'up', 'let', 'catch', 'unawares', 'uniqueness', 'charm', 'none', 'can', 'turn', 'back', 'time', 'particular', 'moment', 'nascent', 'discovery', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'filter', 'own', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'expectations.All', 'preparatory', 'saying', 'Sideways', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'film', 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'premise', 'setting', 'novel', 'unique', 'film', 'finest', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'movie', 'recent', 'years', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'long', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'underrated', 'actors', 'performance', 'tremendous', 'understatement', 'restraint', 'creating', 'entire', 'character', 'much', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'dialogue', 'Miles', ""n't"", 'even', 'likeable', 'times', 'actually', 'money', 'own', 'mother', 'birthday', 'then', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'lack', 'self-image', 'clear-eyed', 'rationality', 'puppy', 'dog', 'vulnerability', 'win', 'anyway', 'playboy', 'Jack', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'layer', 'sensitivity', 'buried', 'cold-blooded', 'crassness', 'Playing', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'enter', 'lives', 'week', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'especially', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'provide', 'sweetness', 'warmth', 'nicely', 'two', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'middle-aged', 'losers', 'perfect', 'blending', 'form', 'content', 'Payne', 'co-author', 'Jim', 'Taylor', 'have', 'created', 'tasty', 'mixture', 'revelatory', 'conversation', 'understated', 'humor', 'lyrical', 'camerawork', 'sit', 'back', 'uncork', 'bottle', 'favorite', 'vintage', 'enjoy', 'aperitif', 'Sideways']",Sideways (Region 2)

Jack, an unaccomplished actor, is about to marry a woman he doesn't really love.  Miles, an unaccomplished writer and wine enthusiast, has already lost the woman he loves, and is on the verge of having his just-finished novel rejected by his publisher.  Though trapped in an existence teaching literature to unimpressed high-schoolers, and unlikely to make an impact with his own writing, Miles is buoyed by his wine senses.  (Especially Pino, the sensitive grape that requires lots of TLC; he resolutely refuses to even look at Merlot, which seems to be the Paris Hilton of wines.)  Looking for distractions, the two drive out to California's wine country for an antidepressant-free weekend of fine wines, good food and wholesome golf.  Jack - out of a mixture of sympathy for the downtrodden Miles and his own compulsion for pleasure - is determined to have both of them...serviced.  Miles is smart enough to see through Jack's plans - which include a passionate and free-spirited winery pourer named Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and a pretty waitress named Maya (Virginia Madsen) - but lacks the force of will to object to them.  Jack won't listen to reason - even as a failed actor, he's ruled by his actor's instincts.  Of course neither Maya nor Stephanie know of Jack's wedding plans, and Miles overlooks the imminent possibility that his novel won't be published.  Jack salves his near-dead ego by feeding his passion for fine wines -sampling the finest Pinot and also sharing his intellectual love with Maya.Almost everybody in this flick loves wines (or in the case of Jack, he shares an emotional bond with everybody else into wines).  Happily ""Sideways"" manages not to become a movie about wines (like ""Year of the Comet"") as much as a story about people who are into wines.  We're never asked to accept the virtues of the vine as much as recognize why the characters have a weakness for it.  For its passion, ""Sideways"" is a soft-spoken movie that never becomes remote.  Not a laugh-riot, it does have its comic moments - mostly towards the end of Jack & Miles's strange weekend.  Giamatti works pretty well for a depressive character who seems to seek in wine what he knows he can't find in other people; Church also excels as another seemingly unsympathetic character - he lies and exploits, though it's obvious that he's the most consistent victim of his own instincts and desires; Sandra Oh rises to the occasion but gets little attention from the story; Virginia Madsen is a revelation as Maya, who seems to be as sensitive as Miles.It's no spoiler to reveal that nothing happens as our heroes planned, yet like a glass of fine wine, we pretty much see the end from the beginning, and savor instead the taste left between the two moments.",4,Why we HATE Merlot,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,2910,"['Sideways', 'tells', 'weekend', 'road', 'trip', 'shared', 'Jack', 'Miles', 'two', 'unlikely', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'borderline', 'losers', 'pivotal', 'weekend', 'lives', 'Jack', 'unaccomplished', 'actor', 'marry', 'woman', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'Miles', 'unaccomplished', 'writer', 'wine', 'enthusiast', 'already', 'lost', 'woman', 'verge', 'having', 'just-finished', 'novel', 'rejected', 'publisher', 'Though', 'trapped', 'existence', 'teaching', 'literature', 'unimpressed', 'high-schoolers', 'unlikely', 'make', 'impact', 'own', 'writing', 'Miles', 'buoyed', 'wine', 'senses', 'Especially', 'Pino', 'sensitive', 'grape', 'lots', 'TLC', 'resolutely', 'even', 'look', 'Merlot', 'be', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'wines', 'Looking', 'distractions', 'two', 'drive', 'California', 'wine', 'country', 'antidepressant-free', 'weekend', 'fine', 'wines', 'good', 'food', 'wholesome', 'golf', 'Jack', 'mixture', 'sympathy', 'downtrodden', 'Miles', 'own', 'compulsion', 'pleasure', 'determined', 'have', 'serviced', 'Miles', 'smart', 'enough', 'see', 'Jack', 'plans', 'include', 'passionate', 'free-spirited', 'winery', 'pourer', 'named', 'Stephanie', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'pretty', 'waitress', 'named', 'Maya', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'force', 'will', 'object', 'Jack', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'reason', 'even', 'failed', 'actor', 'ruled', 'actor', 'instincts', 'course', 'Maya', 'Stephanie', 'know', 'Jack', 'wedding', 'plans', 'Miles', 'imminent', 'possibility', 'novel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'published', 'Jack', 'near-dead', 'ego', 'feeding', 'passion', 'fine', 'wines', '-sampling', 'finest', 'Pinot', 'also', 'sharing', 'intellectual', 'love', 'Maya.Almost', 'everybody', 'flick', 'wines', 'case', 'Jack', 'shares', 'emotional', 'bond', 'everybody', 'else', 'wines', 'Sideways', 'not', 'become', 'movie', 'wines', 'Year', 'Comet', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'wines', ""'re"", 'never', 'asked', 'accept', 'virtues', 'vine', 'as', 'much', 'recognize', 'why', 'characters', 'have', 'weakness', 'passion', 'Sideways', 'soft-spoken', 'movie', 'never', 'remote', 'Not', 'laugh-riot', 'have', 'comic', 'moments', 'mostly', 'end', 'Jack', 'Miles', 'strange', 'weekend', 'Giamatti', 'pretty', 'well', 'depressive', 'character', 'who', 'seek', 'wine', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'other', 'people', 'Church', 'also', 'seemingly', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'exploits', 'obvious', 'most', 'consistent', 'victim', 'own', 'instincts', 'desires', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'occasion', 'little', 'attention', 'story', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'revelation', 'Maya', 'who', 'be', 'as', 'sensitive', 'Miles.It', 'spoiler', 'reveal', 'nothing', 'heroes', 'planned', 'yet', 'glass', 'fine', 'wine', 'pretty', 'much', 'see', 'end', 'beginning', 'savor', 'instead', 'taste', 'left', 'two', 'moments']",Sideways (Region 2)

889006,A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,B0007RUSGW,Scooter McGavin,"[6, 20]","I finally got around to catching on of last years most critically acclaimed movies, Sideway.  All during awards season, everyone keeps talking how the movie should win or how it got shafted in certain categories.  So with all the build up, I had high expectations for the film.  And to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.The film follows two guys around on one last hooray the week before one of their wedding.  The major problem with the film is neither male lead is likeable.  We first catch them in a lie, then we drinking and driving, then they stop by one of their mother's because it the day before her birthday.  Except the son steals her money then skips out on her before she can wake up on her birthday.  So before the first half hour is over, I could care less about the characters.  Thing don't get much better from their when they meet some girls on their getaway.There are also a lot of scenes that go excruciatingly long while the characters talk excessively about wine.  The movie could have been cut an hour off its run time if they cut the unnecessary talk about wine.  There was even a wine montage that looked liked like a montage from the Partridge Family. Okay, they like wine, now let's get on with the movie.The movie does pick up once the female leads disappear, but it's never a good sign when the first time you laugh in a comedy is an hour and a half in.  I think it is easy to see why movie critics like this movie as the main character is a fail writer, and I'm sure many critics can relate as they probably have a few rejected novels or screenplay cluttering up their closets.  And I find it odd how all the movie critics can pan movies like Wedding Crashers for its gratuitous nudity yet their quite a lot of it in Sideways.  And referring to Sidways, by nudity, I mean male nudity.  Full frontal male nudity.  A lot of it.  I was beginning to think there was a gay porn that accidentally got edited into the film.In the end, I can't see how anyone who isn't gay, over the hill, wannabe writer, wine coinsurer could possibly enjoy this movie.

889007,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0007RUSGW,Scott Schiefelbein,"[66, 73]","It's always dangerous when you are late in coming to a small movie that has unexpectedly hit the big time -- your viewing enjoyment may be hampered by the crushing weight of expectations.  It's wonderful when you can be among the first to see small-budget classics like Stanely Tucci's ""Big Night,"" but I didn't get to see ""Sideways"" until after the Oscar nominations, the critics' Top 10 lists, and so on.  How could ""Sideways"" possibly live up to these awesome credentials?Well, ""Sideways"" does live up to its billing, and it does so through one simple virtue -- truth.  ""Sideways"" is an extremely funny and insightful examination of two men struggling with their mediocrity -- one who is all too aware of his shortcomings, and another who uses a pathetic Peter Pan syndrome to keep at bay the harsh glare of reality.The self-aware guy is Miles (the lovable schlub Paul Giamatti), a recently divorced middle school English teacher who's having a difficult time getting his novel published . . . or even explained.  Miles is awash in bitterness, but he knows deep down that he's a sweet guy once you get past the sour layers (of which there are many).  The ignorant guy is Jack (Thomas Hayden Church), Miles' freshman roommate from San Diego State and a mildly successful actor.  Jack is one of those guys who should be thankful for the successes he has, but is incapable of doing so because by accepting a given success, he is placing a ceiling on his dreams.The ""plot"" of ""Sideways"" revolves around Jack's impending marriage.  Engaged to a rich beauty and walking down the aisle on Saturday, Jack gets escorted by Miles for a week of freedom in the California central coast wine country.  While wine, for Jack, is a means for getting drunk, it is a religion for Miles.  Of course, it's obvious to anyone who spends five minutes with Miles that he uses his mastery of wine as a defense mechanism (""I appreciate great wine, so I must be worth something"") - thanks to the witty script, ""there's just like the faintest soupon of like, uh, asparagus,"" has entered our lexicon of pretentious criticism.  Miles can use his focus on wine to avoid meeting people who could possibly reject him.That's difficult on this trip, because Miles has met his soulmate, Maya (Virginia Madsen), who is a waitress at a wine country restaurant.  Miles and Maya share a devotion to wine, and Miles is continuously surprised at the depth and character of this woman.  The question of whether Miles can break out of his various layers of emotional armor to forge a connection with this delightful woman dominates the movie.Unfortunately for Miles, Jack is as shallow as Miles is deep.  In a classic self-destructive move, Jack gets involved with Stepanie (Sandra Oh), a vibrant single mother and good friend of Maya's.  A pell-mell romance ensues, with the ever-so-slight complication that Jack hasn't told Stephanie about his impending marriage.  Watching Jack skirt emotional ruin while selfishly justifying his caddish behavior is a gruesome delight.Through it all, the script for ""Sideways"" puts believable, memorable lines into the mouths of these talented actors.  Long narratives about wine reveal surprising details of the speakers, and each character receives a separate, distinct voice (this isn't a Quentin Tarantino movie where all the actors sound like Saint Quentin, or a George Lucas movie where all the actors sound like idiots).  A ""talky"" movie, ""Sideways"" never runs out of steam.There is plenty of humor in ""Sideways,"" but most of it is reserved - you will chuckle more often than laugh outright - but there are a few gut-busting moments, as well.""Sideways"" is an attractive movie, but it is shot with a realistic eye -- the California wine country looks great, but this is not an ""eye candy"" movie like ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" which looked sumptuous but had little else to offer.  ""Sideways"" gets the balance of visuals and substance just right - one can easily imagine Miles liking his own movie, and that is high praise.",5,"A ""Little Film"" Makes the Big Time",1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,4021,"['always', 'dangerous', 'when', 'are', 'late', 'coming', 'small', 'movie', 'unexpectedly', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'viewing', 'enjoyment', 'may', 'be', 'hampered', 'crushing', 'weight', 'expectations', 'wonderful', 'when', 'can', 'be', 'first', 'see', 'small-budget', 'classics', 'Stanely', 'Tucci', 'Big', 'Night', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Sideways', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'critics', 'Top', '10', 'lists', 'so', 'How', 'could', 'Sideways', 'possibly', 'live', 'up', 'awesome', 'credentials', 'Well', 'Sideways', 'live', 'up', 'billing', 'so', 'one', 'simple', 'virtue', 'truth', 'Sideways', 'extremely', 'funny', 'insightful', 'examination', 'two', 'men', 'struggling', 'mediocrity', 'one', 'who', 'too', 'aware', 'shortcomings', 'who', 'pathetic', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'syndrome', 'keep', 'harsh', 'glare', 'reality.The', 'self-aware', 'guy', 'Miles', 'lovable', 'schlub', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'recently', 'divorced', 'middle', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'getting', 'novel', 'published', 'even', 'explained', 'Miles', 'awash', 'bitterness', 'deep', 'down', 'sweet', 'guy', 'once', 'get', 'sour', 'layers', 'are', 'many', 'ignorant', 'guy', 'Jack', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'Miles', 'freshman', 'roommate', 'San', 'Diego', 'State', 'mildly', 'successful', 'actor', 'Jack', 'one', 'guys', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', 'successes', 'incapable', 'doing', 'so', 'accepting', 'given', 'success', 'placing', 'ceiling', 'dreams.The', 'plot', 'Sideways', 'around', 'Jack', 'impending', 'marriage', 'Engaged', 'rich', 'beauty', 'walking', 'down', 'aisle', 'Saturday', 'Jack', 'escorted', 'Miles', 'week', 'freedom', 'California', 'central', 'coast', 'wine', 'country', 'wine', 'Jack', 'means', 'getting', 'drunk', 'religion', 'Miles', 'course', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', 'five', 'minutes', 'Miles', 'mastery', 'wine', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'appreciate', 'great', 'wine', 'must', 'be', 'worth', 'something', 'thanks', 'witty', 'script', 'just', 'faintest', 'soupon', 'uh', 'asparagus', 'entered', 'lexicon', 'pretentious', 'criticism', 'Miles', 'can', 'use', 'focus', 'wine', 'avoid', 'meeting', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'possibly', 'reject', 'him.That', 'difficult', 'trip', 'Miles', 'met', 'soulmate', 'Maya', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'who', 'waitress', 'wine', 'country', 'restaurant', 'Miles', 'Maya', 'share', 'devotion', 'wine', 'Miles', 'continuously', 'surprised', 'depth', 'character', 'woman', 'question', 'Miles', 'can', 'break', 'various', 'layers', 'emotional', 'armor', 'forge', 'connection', 'delightful', 'woman', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'Miles', 'Jack', 'as', 'shallow', 'Miles', 'deep', 'classic', 'self-destructive', 'move', 'Jack', 'involved', 'Stepanie', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'vibrant', 'single', 'mother', 'good', 'friend', 'Maya', 'pell-mell', 'romance', 'ensues', 'ever-so-slight', 'complication', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'told', 'Stephanie', 'impending', 'marriage', 'Watching', 'Jack', 'skirt', 'emotional', 'ruin', 'selfishly', 'justifying', 'caddish', 'behavior', 'gruesome', 'delight.Through', 'script', 'Sideways', 'believable', 'memorable', 'lines', 'mouths', 'talented', 'actors', 'Long', 'narratives', 'wine', 'reveal', 'surprising', 'details', 'speakers', 'character', 'separate', 'distinct', 'voice', ""n't"", 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'movie', 'where', 'actors', 'sound', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'George', 'Lucas', 'movie', 'where', 'actors', 'sound', 'idiots', 'talky', 'movie', 'Sideways', 'never', 'steam.There', 'plenty', 'humor', 'Sideways', 'most', 'reserved', 'will', 'chuckle', 'more', 'often', 'laugh', 'outright', 'are', 'few', 'gut-busting', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'Sideways', 'attractive', 'movie', 'shot', 'realistic', 'eye', 'California', 'wine', 'country', 'great', 'not', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'looked', 'sumptuous', 'had', 'little', 'else', 'offer', 'Sideways', 'balance', 'visuals', 'substance', 'just', 'right', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'Miles', 'liking', 'own', 'movie', 'high', 'praise']",Sideways (Region 2)

889016,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B0007RUSGW,Sirin,"[3, 6]","Hollywood needs more films like this. Director Alexander Payne took a gigantic risk in choosing non superstar actors for major roles- Paul Giamatti (Miles) and Alexander Payne Thomas Hadden Church (Jack) and sending these two guys, facing various mid life difficulties, on a road trip just prior to Jack's upcoming wedding to a smart girl in San Diego. Miles is a failed novelist, sensitive intellectual and Pinot Noir quaffing wine snob who awaits news on his 750 page autobiographical novel which is churning around a small publishing house in New York, and looks forwards to a civilized, convivial week of good food and wine with his one time college roomate. Jack on the other hand is a compulsive ass chaser who wants one more bout of sexual freedom before he ties the knot. The friends' two personalities grate terrifically, which makes for some superb character comedy .Sideways works so well because the characters of Miles and Jack are so realistically and intelligently drawn by Payne, bringing them from Rex Pickett's novel to the screen with thoughtful dexterity. Every man at some point in his life has been a Miles (self pitying, depressed, anxious about his failings with women) or a Jack (anxious to get his rocks off), or if not has encountered men like this.The comedy is a mixture of high farce (the scenes when Jack is playing the field as ferociously as he can in his final pre- marital days), and the more poignant comedy of self absorbed anquish (such as when Miles pours the tasting bucket in a wine tasting bar over himself in a climactic moment of self loathing and mental collapse). The romantic sagas of the two guys perfectly reflects their characters. Jack wastes no time in going to bed with Stephanie (played by Sandra Oh who is one of those women with a unique, indefinable sex appeal) whereas Miles is more unnerved by the whole process and needs to be jolted into action by the almost implausibly tolerant Maya (Virginia Madsen). The sexual tension between them allows some poignant scenes. Miles, unable to communicate his emotions in bare form uses wine as a metaphor for his existence - he adores Pinot Noir because it is a delicate grape that requires nurturing, not a survivor in all situations like the more common Cabernet (which reads obviously as a metaphor for the more sexually confident Jack).If there is a criticism, it is that the characters are perhaps too crassly drawn as representing the various totems of male mid life crisis too one sidedly, and the extras on the DVD are missable - a trite, self indulgent commentary on the movie by Giamatti and Hadden Church and some deleted scenes. But Sideways is an important film that suggests there is a potential for quality filmaking in contemporary Hollywood that doesn't solely involve one dimensional glamour models thrashing around in formulaic plots that touch the subtleties of human relationships not one jot.",5,"Essential, original breath of fresh air",1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,2914,"['Hollywood', 'more', 'films', 'Director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'took', 'gigantic', 'risk', 'choosing', 'non', 'superstar', 'actors', 'major', 'roles-', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Miles', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'Thomas', 'Hadden', 'Church', 'Jack', 'sending', 'two', 'guys', 'facing', 'various', 'mid', 'life', 'difficulties', 'road', 'trip', 'just', 'prior', 'Jack', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'smart', 'girl', 'San', 'Diego', 'Miles', 'failed', 'novelist', 'sensitive', 'intellectual', 'Pinot', 'Noir', 'quaffing', 'wine', 'snob', 'who', 'news', '750', 'page', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'churning', 'small', 'publishing', 'house', 'New', 'York', 'forwards', 'civilized', 'convivial', 'week', 'good', 'food', 'wine', 'one', 'time', 'college', 'roomate', 'Jack', 'other', 'hand', 'compulsive', 'ass', 'chaser', 'who', 'one', 'more', 'bout', 'sexual', 'freedom', 'knot', 'friends', 'two', 'personalities', 'grate', 'terrifically', 'superb', 'character', 'comedy', '.Sideways', 'so', 'well', 'characters', 'Miles', 'Jack', 'are', 'so', 'realistically', 'intelligently', 'drawn', 'Payne', 'bringing', 'Rex', 'Pickett', 'novel', 'screen', 'thoughtful', 'dexterity', 'man', 'point', 'life', 'been', 'Miles', 'pitying', 'depressed', 'anxious', 'failings', 'women', 'Jack', 'anxious', 'get', 'rocks', 'off', 'not', 'encountered', 'men', 'this.The', 'comedy', 'mixture', 'high', 'farce', 'scenes', 'when', 'Jack', 'playing', 'field', 'as', 'ferociously', 'can', 'final', 'pre-', 'marital', 'days', 'more', 'poignant', 'comedy', 'self', 'absorbed', 'anquish', 'such', 'when', 'Miles', 'tasting', 'bucket', 'wine', 'tasting', 'bar', 'climactic', 'moment', 'self', 'loathing', 'mental', 'collapse', 'romantic', 'sagas', 'two', 'guys', 'perfectly', 'characters', 'Jack', 'time', 'going', 'bed', 'Stephanie', 'played', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'who', 'one', 'women', 'unique', 'indefinable', 'sex', 'appeal', 'whereas', 'Miles', 'more', 'unnerved', 'whole', 'process', 'be', 'jolted', 'action', 'almost', 'implausibly', 'tolerant', 'Maya', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'sexual', 'tension', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'Miles', 'unable', 'communicate', 'emotions', 'bare', 'form', 'wine', 'metaphor', 'existence', 'Pinot', 'Noir', 'delicate', 'grape', 'nurturing', 'not', 'survivor', 'situations', 'more', 'common', 'Cabernet', 'obviously', 'metaphor', 'more', 'sexually', 'confident', 'Jack', '.If', 'criticism', 'characters', 'are', 'perhaps', 'too', 'crassly', 'drawn', 'representing', 'various', 'totems', 'male', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis', 'too', 'one', 'sidedly', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'missable', 'trite', 'indulgent', 'commentary', 'movie', 'Giamatti', 'Hadden', 'Church', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Sideways', 'important', 'film', 'potential', 'quality', 'filmaking', 'contemporary', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'solely', 'involve', 'one', 'dimensional', 'glamour', 'models', 'thrashing', 'around', 'formulaic', 'plots', 'touch', 'subtleties', 'human', 'relationships', 'not', 'one', 'jot']",Sideways (Region 2)

Miles is a wine connoisseur, so his idea of a really good time is a trip through wine country. Jack's idea of a good time? Getting laid as often as possible before he ties the knot. Oh, by the way, Miles is funding their little jaunt with cash he stole from his mother's secret nightie-drawer stash. Are you in love with these guys yet?Predictably, Jack spends the entire trip chasing women, while Miles never seems to tire of alternately rolling his eyes at Jack's antics and feeling sorry for himself because he hasn't had a book pubished and because his ex wife has recently remarried. Trying to milk some meaning from all of this, I wonder if sneering at Jack's jerkiness makes Miles feel like a better person by comparison. 'Cause, if you're stealing from your mother, you gotta self-validate somehow.As the hapless pair meanders through Whine Country, hilarity keeps threatening to ensue (but doesn't). Miles drunkenly phones his ex-wife. Jack has a torrid affair with a single mother. Miles angsts over an attractive woman (Maya) who seems interested, but doesn't meet up to his high standards. ""How is THAT going to work?"" he complains, ""She's a HOSTESS!"" Later, trying to explain to her his love of Pinot grapes, he explains that he loves them because they are so delicate, very thin-skinned, and they need a lot of nurturing to bring out their full potential. He's obviously talking about himself and it's almost funny, but any hope of ""comedy"" is ruined when Maya listens with a straight face, hanging on his every word.The plot wanders on, offering the occasional chuckle, but little in the way of enjoyment. And there's a gratuitous nude scene that made me wish I could somehow erase what I had just seen from my memory. (If you watch the movie, you'll KNOW which scene I'm talking about.) So, when you're groaning and flinching over what just got etched onto your mind's eye, I guess that's what the critics call ""dark comedy.""To sum up, I didn't like the plot, didn't like the characters, didn't like the movie.

His previous films Election and About Schmidt are light social commentary comedies. His latest, Sideways, is no different.Sideways tells the story of two middle aged men, one a middle school Social Studies teacher named Miles Raymond played by Paul Giamatti, and the other an actor named Jack played by Thomas Haden Church. Jack is supposedly getting married in a week, while Miles is still suffering from a two year old divorce. The two men go on a trip through the wine counties of California on a wine-tasting tour that Miles is an expert at. Along the way, they meet the humble, charming waitress Maya, played by Virginia Madsen, and the wild single mother Stephanie, played by Sandra Oh. Jack has a dirty plan of enjoying one last sexual fling before he ties the knot and at the same time show his depressed buddy Miles that life is still worth looking into and enjoying by trying to hook him up with Maya. Miles becomes outraged with Jack's disloyalty and at the same time his own struggles to fall in love again.With funny dialogue and the Alexander Payne style of realism, Sideways succeeds in making a connection with the audience.

889024,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B0007RUSGW,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[4, 5]","In the first-hand surveys I've taken, this film, surprisingly, has been more popular with men than women. Women, perhaps influenced by the stalest sort of conventional feminist propaganda, complain that the hero of the film is shown, among other defects, stealing from his own mother, and this without payback. But surely such a narrow response is to miss the point. Miles (Paul Giamatti) may wind up the ultimate hero, but the film shows his growth, not his initial perfection. At the start, he's no more than an incipient drunk and a liar. His stealing from his own mother, in order to enjoy a drinking weekend with his about to be married buddy, is thus thoroughly, though sadly enough, in character.As a matter of fact, it is the influence of Maya (Virginia Madsen), a woman and the moral center of the film, who sets him on the path toward true personhood. She initiates the process of turning a sow's ear into a silk purse. This is not because, as a woman, she's in any way obligated to such a duty. Instead, she has had occasion to see through his limitations to his potential value, and, therefore, she finds him worth her while. At the same time as their companion couple commence a dishonest relationship, Miles and Maya, out on a patio, begin a wonderful conversation, ostensibly about the merits of pinot noir, but in fact a conversation about human value and longing.  This scene is the turning point of the film and one of the most beautifully written scenes in world cinema.After it, Miles, a former failed husband, is able to greet his ex-wife at her remarriage with civility, rather than the rage he'd forecasted. It is Maya, finally, whom he seeks to bond with, rather than his reprehensible male buddy. Only a man or woman without a heart could fail to be impressed by Miles' growth through the film, and this owing to his connection with a woman more profound than he.One final and amusing note on Miles' pretentiousness as a wine conoisseur. A local (Los Angeles) wine critic has pointed out that the cherished bottle which the Merlot hating Miles drinks on his way to Santa Barbara at the film's end is actually a Merlot blend. So much for the idea that Miles is to any extent writer and director Alexander Payne's insufficiently criticized hero.",5,"""Merlot!""",1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,2268,"['first-hand', 'surveys', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'been', 'more', 'popular', 'men', 'women', 'Women', 'perhaps', 'influenced', 'stalest', 'sort', 'conventional', 'feminist', 'propaganda', 'complain', 'hero', 'film', 'shown', 'other', 'defects', 'stealing', 'own', 'mother', 'payback', 'surely', 'such', 'narrow', 'response', 'miss', 'point', 'Miles', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'may', 'wind', 'up', 'ultimate', 'hero', 'film', 'growth', 'not', 'initial', 'perfection', 'start', 'more', 'incipient', 'drunk', 'liar', 'stealing', 'own', 'mother', 'order', 'enjoy', 'drinking', 'weekend', 'about', 'be', 'married', 'buddy', 'thus', 'thoroughly', 'sadly', 'enough', 'character.As', 'matter', 'fact', 'influence', 'Maya', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'woman', 'moral', 'center', 'film', 'who', 'path', 'true', 'personhood', 'process', 'turning', 'sow', 'ear', 'silk', 'purse', 'not', 'because', 'woman', 'way', 'obligated', 'such', 'duty', 'Instead', 'had', 'occasion', 'see', 'limitations', 'potential', 'value', 'therefore', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'companion', 'couple', 'commence', 'dishonest', 'relationship', 'Miles', 'Maya', 'out', 'patio', 'begin', 'wonderful', 'conversation', 'ostensibly', 'merits', 'pinot', 'noir', 'fact', 'conversation', 'human', 'value', 'longing', 'scene', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'written', 'scenes', 'world', 'cinema.After', 'Miles', 'former', 'failed', 'husband', 'able', 'greet', 'ex-wife', 'remarriage', 'civility', 'rather', 'rage', ""'d"", 'forecasted', 'Maya', 'finally', 'whom', 'bond', 'rather', 'reprehensible', 'male', 'buddy', 'Only', 'man', 'woman', 'heart', 'could', 'fail', 'be', 'impressed', 'Miles', 'growth', 'film', 'owing', 'connection', 'woman', 'more', 'profound', 'he.One', 'final', 'amusing', 'note', 'Miles', 'pretentiousness', 'wine', 'conoisseur', 'local', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'wine', 'critic', 'pointed', 'out', 'cherished', 'bottle', 'Merlot', 'hating', 'Miles', 'way', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'film', 'end', 'actually', 'Merlot', 'blend', 'So', 'much', 'idea', 'Miles', 'extent', 'writer', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'insufficiently', 'criticized', 'hero']",Sideways (Region 2)

As it stands, ""Sideways"" is more a collection of scenes, some good, some great, than a movie, but that doesn't stop it from shining in many moments, including a would-be golf course rumble and the gutbuster where the usually annoying Sandra Oh gets to kick the daylights out of the usually annoying Thomas Haden Church.

889028,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B0007RUSGW,Steve,"[5, 7]","I liked Sideways for many reasons, but mostly because the characters were very believable and honest to me. I have read critics say they were upset about the undeserving happy ending. I'm not sure what movie they were watching but a happy ending is not the conclusion I drew at all. At best, it is a vague and open-ended conclusion. The only thing we might infer is that Miles, as played by Paul Giamatti in what should have been an Oscar winning performance, finally begins to realize that he is a worthwhile person and that he has made peace with his divorce and begun the slow move forward. When he opens the forty year old bottle of wine he had been saving for the ""right moment with the right person,"" and drinks it alone, I knew that his character had stopped the self-loathing that had eaten away at his happiness, his confidence, and his self-esteem. He was the right person and that was a powerful statement.As for his sexually compulsive acquaintance, the mere fact that he managed to get away with his debauched and troubling week of infidelity and cruel behavior does not mean that he got the happy ending. Without any sense of the kind of self-actualization Miles went through, this shallow and most likely self-hating person is doomed to continue his need for self-value via sexual conquests until his marriage is ruined or he has the chance to find out the root of his self-destructive behavior. The grin he flashes Miles as he is getting married is all I need to know that there was no epiphany in his tearful plea to Miles at the motel. His future looks far from happy to me.The women both seemed to be far ahead of their male counterparts. Maya, the perfect compliment to the needy and delicate Miles, has already re-directed her life after her deceit-filled marriage ended and it is her steadfastness and her new-found confidence and independence that allow her to re-connect with Miles and give him the benefit of a second chance. The scene between Miles and Maya in which they describe their love of wine is one of the most eloquent I have seen in a movie in a long while.This is a movie of characters. It is a movie about people who are wounded and far from perfect and yet who battle through the misery that life can be. These characters do things that make you angry and perhaps feel pity for them, but don't we all in the course of our lives? There are indeed no syrupy happy endings to Sideways. There is merely the knock at the door and the uncertainty of what will happen next. If you crave explosions, fast moving plots, blood, gore, puerile humor (all of which I can find quite entertaining!), Sideways is most assuredly not any of those things. It is a quiet movie that takes a wealth of empathy and understanding of the frailties of man to fully appreciate. Calling the characters whiny or saying it is boring means you simply didn't get it. Not everyone will. Not all movies are made for everyone on the planet to enjoy either.

There is no subtlety in filmmaking these days.  As if I couldn't tell the characters were having sex unless I actually see their legs in the air and their bare ugly asses.  For some reason film directors have a need to shock us with pornographic images.  The depictions od sex in this film weren't as graphic as what you often see, but they were totally unnecessary.  Same goes for the drug use.  Is getting the R rating really that important?But besides that, there was, as I said plenty to dislike about the characters.

889032,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B0007RUSGW,Takis Tz.,"[5, 9]","Despite being hesitant about watching this (the director was behind the overrated About Schmidt) i came out of the theater reasonably happy that i did.While ""Sideways"" is actually a film that blends many familiar themes in its plot it manages to introduce them achieving an atmosphere that makes it a very warm and ultimately very human film. These themes include a traditional loser type who cant get over his collapsed marriage (Giammati) and who has become self-loathing and bitter about it as well as about his soon NOT to be published book, and his friend who fully exploits him for a few sexual adventures before he himself gets married as they both embark in a weekly trip culminating to the wedding.Now, if you feel that the storyline might be one of those pseudo-intellectual comedies rest assured that it isn't.Sideways is genuingly funny in a manner that we all know real life can be. It's also equally tragic mostly because the loser of the story is a terrifically convincing character, one of those people that actually proclaim themselves losers even though they possess wonderful qualities that they themselves do not realise. This character is given a great performance by Giammati, one that should easily be considered for Oscar material even if the film doesnt have the otherwise flashy credentials recquired for such a consideration.The world of ""Sideways"" evolves around this loser and his efforts to somehow fit in despite his defeats. His closest friend isnt too interested in saving him and couldnt even if he intended to. Not only that but he leads him from one hilarious disaster onto another. Hilarious yes, farsical even, but still very believable. The scriptwriter obviously managed to achieve a very fine balance here, without which we'd have another fine idea messed up on celluloid.I's definetely not a situational comedy as most of the charm of the film is based on some seriously self-sarcastic and poignant dialogue and this counts as an extra asset to it.One of the bigger surprises in films this year, ""Sideways"" shouldnt be ignored by anyone who looks for a comedy which isnt really a comedy or for a drama which isnt that either, but something in between which will have you laughing and thinking at the same time..",5,Losers don't always lose...,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,2253,"['being', 'hesitant', 'watching', 'director', 'was', 'overrated', 'Schmidt', 'i', 'came', 'theater', 'reasonably', 'happy', 'i', 'did.While', 'Sideways', 'actually', 'film', 'many', 'familiar', 'themes', 'plot', 'introduce', 'achieving', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'warm', 'ultimately', 'very', 'human', 'film', 'themes', 'include', 'traditional', 'loser', 'type', 'who', 'cant', 'get', 'collapsed', 'marriage', 'Giammati', 'who', 'become', 'self-loathing', 'bitter', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'soon', 'NOT', 'be', 'published', 'book', 'friend', 'who', 'fully', 'few', 'sexual', 'adventures', 'married', 'embark', 'weekly', 'trip', 'culminating', 'wedding.Now', 'feel', 'storyline', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'comedies', 'rest', 'assured', 'genuingly', 'funny', 'manner', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'equally', 'tragic', 'mostly', 'loser', 'story', 'terrifically', 'convincing', 'character', 'one', 'people', 'actually', 'proclaim', 'losers', 'even', 'possess', 'wonderful', 'qualities', 'do', 'not', 'realise', 'character', 'given', 'great', 'performance', 'Giammati', 'one', 'should', 'easily', 'be', 'considered', 'Oscar', 'material', 'even', 'film', 'doesnt', 'have', 'otherwise', 'flashy', 'credentials', 'recquired', 'such', 'consideration.The', 'world', 'Sideways', 'loser', 'efforts', 'somehow', 'fit', 'defeats', 'closest', 'friend', 'isnt', 'too', 'interested', 'saving', 'couldnt', 'even', 'intended', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'hilarious', 'disaster', 'Hilarious', 'yes', 'farsical', 'even', 'still', 'very', 'believable', 'scriptwriter', 'obviously', 'managed', 'achieve', 'very', 'fine', 'balance', 'here', ""'d"", 'have', 'fine', 'idea', 'messed', 'up', 'celluloid.I', 'definetely', 'not', 'situational', 'comedy', 'most', 'charm', 'film', 'based', 'seriously', 'self-sarcastic', 'poignant', 'dialogue', 'extra', 'asset', 'it.One', 'bigger', 'surprises', 'films', 'year', 'Sideways', 'shouldnt', 'be', 'ignored', 'anyone', 'who', 'comedy', 'isnt', 'really', 'comedy', 'drama', 'something', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'thinking', 'same', 'time..']",Sideways (Region 2)
889033,A31K0IGAB25GQM,B0007RUSGW,the_baseball_man2003,"[0, 1]","What do you get when you put together two guys going through a mid-life crisis, wine country and a humorous yet moving portrayal of all the ups and downs of life?  You get the best film of 2004.  Miles is a depressed English teacher that went through a divorce two years ago and has a drinking problem.  His best friend Jack is an irresponsible has-been actor that is about to get married.  The two of them take a trip to wine country to celebrate Jack's wedding.  While Miles believes that this is going to be a regular trip, Jack decides to have one last fling before the big day.  While in wine country, they come across Maya (an acquaintance of Miles) and her friend, Stephanie.  During this one week, Miles and Jack will learn important lessons about who they are, what they want and that little ""Sideways"" adventure called life.  The direction and script are top notch but what really makes this film are the performances by the four leads.  Paul Giamatti gives the performance of the his career a man who's life is not turning out the way he would like it too and where he goes from here.  Thomas Haden Church also shines as a guy who makes many reckless mistakes but also learns about himself in the process.  You might not like them at first but by the end of the film, you find yourself both liking and feeling sympathy for the both of them (especially Miles).  Virginia Madsen is terrific as a waitress at Miles favorite restaurant that is going through the growing pains of life.  The scene with her and Miles talking about wine (when in actuality they are describing themselves) is a major highlight.  Sandra Oh was also good even though we do not see as much of her.  She is lively and feisty as Jack's ""love interest.""  The film works because all of these characters are real people with hopes, dreams, desires and their own sets of problems.  Because of this, we can relate to all of them.  The film received a total of five Academy Award nominations (Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor for Church and Supporting Actress for Madsen).  The real crime here is that Paul Giamatti's humorous and moving performance was not nominated for Best Actor.  This man was the emotional core of the entire movie.  His character might have seemed pompous and self-centered but we really feel for this guy and hope that things will turn around for him.  The ending perfectly does this.  As a little side note, the ending mirrors the very beginning of the film but you will have to see it for yourself.  For anyone going through the ups, downs and ""sideways"" of life (whether young, middle aged or old), you need to see this movie.  It was a life changing experience for me and I am only 23-years-old.  The first time I watched it I was a couple of years ago.

I was just expecting a lot more than what I saw...there were some GREAT funny bits, but the overall feeling of the movie left me a bit 'sideways' too...either I missed the point or was expecting something else (a few more laughs, perhaps).On the upside, I was so happy that a movie like this made it into the mainstream, because so many of them are - well - crap.

I was pleased that I finally saw it.  A friend of mine is planning a wine-tasting trip to everywhere the movie went (which are all real places, I believe--even the Hitching Post).The cast is outstanding.  The production is top-notch.  But it takes a while to get going.  I don't know if it needed all that set-up to get the characters going but I stuck it out through a dry opening.  Miles, the Paul Giammatti character, nearly loses me right off the bat.  Okay, he's a frustrated writer who isn't going anywhere (I just watched WE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE and that was about TWO frustrated writer/teachers who didn't go anywhere).  Fine.  But when he steals money from his mother...how do you get ""lovable loser"" back after that?  Misstep or really revealing character flaw?  That's up to each viewer.His hopeless behavior with women and then adding alcohol to unleash darker rages didn't help either.  He is such a loser by the midpoint that, instead of seeing him pull it together and win the girl or whatever happy ending you want to tag on this, I wanted to see him pay for his boorish behavior to everyone.Thankfully, Thomas Haden Church is on hand to goose this movie to life.  His wild, reckless needs give an unpredictable energy to everything.

889036,AT7W1EXT0PF2Y,B0007RUSGW,The Patriarch,"[4, 15]","Hollywood pabulum is best left in Hollywood. But when Thomas Haden Church is in a movie, any movie, I will see it. Thus I subjected myself to this nightmare. Church played lovable but borderline psychotic moron Lowell, in Wings. He played not-so-lovable and borderline psychotic businessman Ned in Ned n Stacey. So what could I watch and not like him in? Answer: Sideways. Church plays a not-so-lovable psychotic womanizer whose idea of a good time is going out to cheat on his wife as much as possible before their wedding. If there could be a better example of human filth it would be his friend and co-star Miles. Miles is a whiny, spineless, sack of worthless human being. His goal in this movie is to get laid period. Yes, what a wonderful and totally brand-new plot we've been given. So while they are on this mission, they drive through California orchards and drink a lot of wine.Keep in mind how the words whine and wine are homophones. Either one of these two things come out of Miles' mouth whenever he speaks. He's either talking about wine or whining about something or other. What kind of grown man is this fixated on wine? Yes, I like wine, I like to drink it. I don't like to memorize every frikkin kind there is, what years are best, etc. I don't like to stand around sniffing wine, like a cocker spaniel sniffs its urine, I have better things to do.In this ridiculous work of the author's imagination, the wimpy, spineless man gets the girl in the end. There is no character development. He doesn't realize that he's a pathetic fool, improve himself and ultimately win the girl. He stays a disgusting pitiful wretch of a human being and that's fine with her. If I haven't given you enough reasons not to watch this film, by all means read on cause here's the coup de grace. We get to see a nude Thomas Haden Church copulating with a woman in the butterfly position. I DID NOT need to see this. I did not want the image of THC's buttocks forever tattooed on my psyche. Any faith and respect I ever had for THC is nuked to nothingness when he breaks down in the end like a whiny spineless Miles.

Miles is recuperating from a divorce, and Jack will marry for the first time the Saturday following the trek.At first look we notice the many differences between the two men.  Miles is , cerebral, introverted, literary and a connaiseur ofg fine wines.  Jack is a good-looking, outgoing, smooth-talkin, philistine, actor.The two men have not acheived success according to societal standards.  Miles has already had had two novels rejected and expects the same fate for a recently completed work.  He teaches 8th grade, a position neither well remunerated, nor -unfortunately-well respected.  Jack gets the occasional voice-over gig and, his claim to fame, once had a starring role in a soap opera.  Now he hopes to secure a corporate position through the help of his soon-to-be brother-in-law.When the old friends meet a couple of local waitresses, Maya andStephanie, we notice another common trait.  Both men depend  largely on women for ego-gratification, though this gets expressed differently according to each character's personality.Miles cannot get over the divorce and his hopes of getting back with his ex-wife are dashed when Jack informs him that she has remarried.  His self-worth has been annihilated.  We understand that one reason for the divorce may have been Miles' inability to impregnate her.  Anti-depressants offer no relief. He is drowning in self-absorption, self-pity and when inebriated, he calls his wife for some succor to his bruised ego, gets rebuked and plummets further.Jack on the other hand gets his ego stroked by womanizing.  His acting skills serve him well in this role, and he manages to fool Stephanie into believing that he loves her.  What's worse, he gets so caught-up in his lie that he imagines himself to be in love and even considers calling-off the marriage with his fiancee, Victoria.When the truth about the upcoming nuptials gets outted.  Maya and Stephanie send both men packing.  We resist calling Miles and Jack losers; despite their flaws, we feel sympathy for them.

889039,A3VZ4LAHI144EC,B0007RUSGW,"tomato cow ""JSC""","[3, 4]","One of the best movies of 2004 was this highly entertaining 'feel good' drama/comedy of a week-long 2 man bachelor's party. It's kind of a 'mut and jeff' story. Set in the beautiful California wine country, this is an amusing human character study of two guys, old friends from college, and very different from each other in temperament.The husband-to-be experiences his second guessing, particularly as he encounters any member of the opposite sex as he gleefully views the week as his 'last harrah' and wastes no time nor opportunity to 'live it up'. The other, emotionally conservative, cerebral and introspective, and still lamenting over a failed marriage, is so wrapped up in his own feelings of inadequacy that he doesn't really want to be there in the first place. The dynamic between the two is great. They actually really complement each other in their contrasting yet endearing friendship.The screenplay is exceptionally well written with very 'human' character flaws revealed in these two rather lovable clowns that are displayed in the most humorous of ways. Along the way they meet up with interesting and provocative women and each guy has a very different reaction to the whole thing. The scenery is of course wonderful and the film also serves as an introductory primer about those who live with an attuned awareness of fine wines. A rather interesting world, it seems almost cult-like. It inspires me to want to take such a trip someday, bouncing from winery to winery, sampling the grapes. Sound like fun? Does to me!The combination of drama to humor is a deft mix. The story is progressively interesting yet interjected with a lot of dry humor. It really captivates one's interest as these characters are further defined. By the end of the film both of their personalities are revealed to a degree of complexity that is rare for a movie coming out of hollywood these days. Both men have the propensity to deceive themselves, although to greatly different degrees. The net result is the viewer comes away with a good deal of empathy for these flawed characters.All in all, an excellent, light film that will make you laugh out loud and end up making you feel good.

My overall impression is that it was well done, but I don't think it rose to ""Best Picture of the Year"" worthiness. I'm not sure how much of it I'll remember many years from now, except possibly to laugh about the cultural influence it has had in attitudes about pinot noir and merlot. I thinking the acting was excellent. Paul Giamatti perfectly personified the neurotic author-poseur wine-snob, and Thomas Haden Church captured the immature actor on his bachelor party ""final fling"", while Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh were great as the two wine country women who the guys hook up with. The direction was impeccable, with Alexander Payne not only getting great performances out of his actors, but beautifully capturing the setting, the odd juxtaposition of beautiful central California oak-studded hillsides, cheap roadside motels, and the Danish kitsch of Solvang. Payne doesn't over-accentuate the kitsch (which as anyone who's read Susan Sontag's famous essay knows would puncture its delicate facade), but simply shows it and lets it speak for itself.So where does this film fall short? That would be in this bizarre story, centered on two rather repulsive main characters, one of which has overslept, parked in a tow zone, told a few small lies to his best friend, and stolen money from his own mother all in the first ten minutes of the movie. And he's the better of the two. Perhaps I'm a bit old-fashioned that way, or perhaps it's my idealism, but I found the deep cynicism inherent in the story unpleasant to take. And what's with that ending? It was so non-sequitur. I can only imagine that the original story had Miles dump his novel in the trash just before slitting his wrists, but the Hollywood execs said no, no, no, we have to end it on a note of hope. Well here's what I hope: I hope that Maya slams the door in his face and avoids getting further mixed up with that loser poseur.Perhaps what was most off-putting (even disturbing in the sort of way that sticks with me) was the notion that this movie might be a deeply cynical commentary on life in California. Is that the reality behind the California dream, where everyone is an actor and everyone's life is an act, a bunch of self-absorbed amoral people? When an outsider (think Woody Allen) ridicules California stereotypes, it's easy to laugh and shrug it off. But when one of our own becomes disillusioned (think Joan Didion), the cynicism of disillusionment can cut to the bone.

The character is one who has written a novel that he hoped to publish and turn his life around. Instead he now has to retreat from fantasy and to look at his life and start to rebuild it getting a job and trying to enter a relationship. Perhaps more importantly he has to cope with his ordinariness.The action of the film takes place mainly during a week when the aspiring writer takes a university buddy on a week trip to a wine growing area. The author's friend is a former soapy star whose career has been declining probably and his main work is doing voice-overs. Both characters are unattractive being adolescents who have not made the transaction to adulthood. One steals a large sum of money from his alcoholic mother to finance the trip and the other cheats on his fiancee in a way that is almost pathological.After hearing a summary of the plot one would think that the film is a grim affair which might have a week season in one or two art-house cinemas. In fact the film has been one of the most successful low budget films in years. The reason for that is despite the repellent nature of the characters it is hilarious. Each scene is a minor masterpiece either comic in itself or part of the gradual development of the character study of both of the participants.Perhaps one of the most bizarre things about the film is that you feel drawn to the two protagonists. Despite the fact that one is a brilliantly drawn pompous wine snob and the other is both superficial and not bright, one cheers for them. Some of the scenes are classics of comedy.

889046,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007RUSGW,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 6]","Many say 'Sideways' is a funny comedy, and that is not without truths.  But for anyone who knows something about so-called mid-life crisis, this film means much more than being a well-made comedy.  In short, 'Sideways' is a bitter-sweet tale about the life -- life with regrets and a little bit of hope -- and as that it is fantastic.Nothing remarkable happens in 'Sideways.'  One English teacher (and recently divorced) Miles (Paul Giamatti) travels with his friend Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) around California tasting good Californian wine, playing golf, and having a double date with two women Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh).  Jack was a popular TV star (and an occasional TV commercian narrator) who is getting married in a week, and for him this is the last chance to be really 'free.'  In the menawhile, Miles has his own concern because he wants to be a writer though none of the publishers he submitted his manuscript wouldn't accept it, not even give a call to him.  And Miles vaguely senses that success is eluding him.Nothing more attractive than the written story, but these characters and their emotions are so real, so amusing and often so painful that the film becomes a tour to get to know these people, whose virtues and even flaws start to look very adorable.  Jack is a hopeless case of womamizer, but we understand his personality, if not tolerate.  Miles ia haunted by the perpetual self-loathing habit, and we know it when he calls his ex-wife, asking if there could be a second chance.  Of course, there is not, we know it, and he knows it.  But he had to phone, and ask, and hates himself for doing that.Though wine plays the integral part of the film, it does so not with some knowledge about vintages, but with a slyly concealed allegory about life.  I cannot reveal the part in detail, but at one scene, which virtually brought an Oscar nomination to Virginia Madsen, Miles and Maya talk about something in the candle-lit room.  Apprantly Miles talks about wine.  But we soon know Maya's answer to him means much deeper Miles initially suspected.

Paul Giamatti stars as the slightly-mild mannered and extremely intelligent Miles Raymond. Miles is finding himself in a serious mid-life crisis. His wife of several years divorced him two years prior, running away with her extramarital lover. Miles is a writer, but every publishing company in the country has rejected his manuscript except for one. He can't even get any free lance work and has wound up teaching 8th grade English at a college prep school. Miles' best friend is Jack (Thomas Haden Church). They first met as roommates during their freshmen year at college. Their lives are very much total opposites: Jack is a jock, Miles is not; Jack is very handsome and suave, Miles is an everyman; Jack isn't all that intelligent, Miles is too smart for his good sometimes. Nevertheless, the two became best friends in college and have remained so throughout their lives.Jack is engaged to a beautiful young woman whom he seems to love very much. The wine-tasting trip is Miles' gift to Jack for his wedding. The duo really don't journey all that far geographically. But each of them travels an immense distance emotionally, mentally, and psychologically during their week trip. The two travel from one winery to another. Along the way, Jack meets up with a young woman named Stephanie whom he becomes consumed by lust for. Miles on the other hand, realizes that a young waitress at one of the local eateries is someone who he shares a great deal in common with. Troubles ensue for both men, but the picture ends on a note of unsaccharinated hope.The writing in the movie is fantastic. Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor's script has some unbelievable dialogue. Wine is a key backdrop in the film, but serves more as metaphor than anything else. In addition to the writing, the acting is superb. Paul Giamatti gives a brilliant performance and was once again snubbed by the Academy for his efforts. I guess Hollywood is ready to let normal looking people back into their elite club, yet. All of the supporting roles were just as strong as Giamatti's performance and are a joy to watch together.A couple of side notes, Payne brings back a character (Dr. Hendricks) from one of his previous works, ELECTION, as a very minor character in the film. Also, Jack makes several references to his career in the movie. Many of these references are actually sidebars about Thomas Haden Church's real-life career.Overall, SIDEWAYS is a wonderful and brilliant quirky, little film. Not everyone will enjoy it. But it does capture the essence of the struggle of a man at midlife and is worth watching for Giamatti's performance.",5,Our Place in This World,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,2766,"['SIDEWAYS', 'buddy', 'flick', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'travel', 'week', 'wine-tasting', 'together', 'one', 'last', 'hurrah', 'one', 'friends', 'married', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'slightly-mild', 'mannered', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'Miles', 'Raymond', 'Miles', 'finding', 'serious', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'wife', 'several', 'years', 'divorced', 'two', 'years', 'prior', 'running', 'away', 'extramarital', 'lover', 'Miles', 'writer', 'publishing', 'company', 'country', 'rejected', 'manuscript', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'free', 'lance', 'work', 'wound', 'up', 'teaching', '8th', 'grade', 'English', 'college', 'prep', 'school', 'Miles', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'first', 'met', 'roommates', 'freshmen', 'year', 'college', 'lives', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'total', 'opposites', 'Jack', 'jock', 'Miles', 'not', 'Jack', 'very', 'handsome', 'suave', 'Miles', 'everyman', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'intelligent', 'Miles', 'too', 'smart', 'good', 'sometimes', 'Nevertheless', 'two', 'became', 'best', 'friends', 'college', 'have', 'remained', 'so', 'lives.Jack', 'engaged', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'whom', 'love', 'very', 'much', 'wine-tasting', 'trip', 'Miles', 'gift', 'Jack', 'wedding', 'duo', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'journey', 'far', 'geographically', 'immense', 'distance', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'psychologically', 'week', 'trip', 'two', 'travel', 'one', 'winery', 'way', 'Jack', 'up', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Stephanie', 'whom', 'consumed', 'lust', 'Miles', 'other', 'hand', 'young', 'waitress', 'one', 'local', 'eateries', 'someone', 'who', 'shares', 'great', 'deal', 'common', 'Troubles', 'ensue', 'men', 'picture', 'note', 'unsaccharinated', 'hope.The', 'writing', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'Jim', 'Taylor', 'script', 'unbelievable', 'dialogue', 'Wine', 'key', 'backdrop', 'film', 'more', 'metaphor', 'anything', 'else', 'addition', 'writing', 'acting', 'superb', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'snubbed', 'Academy', 'efforts', 'guess', 'Hollywood', 'ready', 'let', 'normal', 'looking', 'people', 'back', 'elite', 'club', 'yet', 'supporting', 'roles', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'Giamatti', 'performance', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'together.A', 'couple', 'side', 'notes', 'Payne', 'back', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Hendricks', 'one', 'previous', 'works', 'ELECTION', 'very', 'minor', 'character', 'film', 'Also', 'Jack', 'several', 'references', 'career', 'movie', 'Many', 'references', 'are', 'actually', 'sidebars', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'real-life', 'career.Overall', 'SIDEWAYS', 'wonderful', 'brilliant', 'quirky', 'little', 'film', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'capture', 'essence', 'struggle', 'man', 'midlife', 'worth', 'watching', 'Giamatti', 'performance']",Sideways (Region 2)

What begins as a tour of California wineries and golf courses takes a fateful turn as the groom-to-be makes clear his intention to sample more than just prestigious vintages and pristine fairways.  It is a dearth of the more salacious pleasures (rather those of dusky pinots and well-manicured greens) that Jack anticipates with the coming of married life, as his quest for wanton female companionship becomes the focus of their trip.  This change of agenda proves to be unnerving to poor Miles: an intellectual oenophile, English teacher, and frustrated novelist still gun shy in wake of his recent divorce.  Nevertheless, these adventures prove illuminating for these two very different friends.

Marshall,"[2, 3]","Believe all the hype that you have heard on this film it is absolutely wonderful in so many ways.Meet Miles (Paul Giamatti) and his engaged friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) as they embark upon a last effort at freedom before Jack heads down the aisle. Miles is a hapless writer struggling to overcome a breakup with an old flame and Jack is every woman's worst nightmare...that really stupid, overly sexy man who lies like a fiend! The friends end up going for a tour of wineries, Miles is obsessed with Pinot Grigio and Jack with sex. As they spend a week together things start to unravel because of lost dreams, new lives and selfish indulgences that lead to broken hearts along the way. The boys meet a couple of bright and wonderful women who add to the fiasco. A waitress (Virginia Madsen) coming to terms with a divorce and a new way of life describes wine as only a true poet can. While a wild and exuberant wine pourer (Sandra Oh) indulges herself in more than one area. So it is a week of laughter, disappointment, rage and discovery for all the parties involved. But the wine is the true star!This film is written lyrically and it flows like the wine which remains its sub-textural subject. It deals with the complexities of relationships the same way that wineries deal with their crops, some are quick and tart while others have to sit before they build their full bouquets. The acting is phenomenal offering both comic and emotional depth in each of the characters. Madsen is luminous and has the best lines; her character probably the best soul. Giamatti is subtle yet hilarious as the unconfident man with a heart of gold. Church makes women swoon and then cringe but he also makes viewers laugh out loud.

889053,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B0007RUSGW,Wayne C. Rogers,"[2, 3]","It's taken me three long years to finally see the film, Sideways, starring Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church.  I'm like the coyote in the ""Roadrunner"" cartoons that pays a visit to the kicking machine after every stupid mistake.  Not seeing this brilliant movie sooner was certainly a mistake on my part.  At least it's now been corrected.  Though this movie is referred to as a comedy (and it is funny in a lot of places), I saw Sideways as more of a serious drama with humor mixed in.  There's a lot of emotional sadness and heartache in this film, and it's not to be taken lightly.The movie deals with two middle-aged California men who are experiencing somewhat of a mid-life crisis.  Miles (played by Giamatti) is an 8th Grade schoolteacher who has dreams of being a published writer.  Also, after being divorced for two years, he still hasn't gotten over his ex-wife and foolishly believes that there's a chance they'll eventually get back together.  Jack (played by Church) is a long-time struggling actor whose career may actually be over.  He just doesn't know it, yet.  Jack's about to marry into a rich family in a few days, and he's starting to have second thoughts about his decision.  Miles decides to take Jack on a road trip up to the wine vineyards in Santa Barbara the week before the wedding so that they can sample a lot of different wines, played golf, and relax a little bit before the big day finally arrives.  During the trip, the two men inadvertently get involved with two very intelligent, passionate, and independent women (Maya who's played by Virginia Madsen and Stephanie who's played by Sandra Oh), setting the stage for humor, betrayal, and a great deal of emotional turmoil.  This is why I say that Sideways isn't a comedy, but rather a serious drama.  Both men are attempting to face their own inner demons and to find solutions to stheir dilemmas.  Through an up-and-down roller coaster ride of emotions that involve the relationships that are developed with Maya and Stephanie, the two guys soon realize that it may be necessary to let their old dreams go, if they want to embrace a better future and to finally be happy.Sideways is a vivid study of male friendship, mid-life crisis, and how difficult it is to give up your old dreams for newer and better ones.  The acting by the four main principles is subtle; yet also deeply truthful in its grasp of human behavior.  There are three really powerful scenes in the film that stood out for me.  The first is at the beginning when Miles and Jack stop on their way to Santa Barbara to see Miles' mother.  While there, Miles pays a visit to his mother's bedroom and steals several hundred dollars from her dresser bureau.  This is when you suddenly know that Sideways isn't a comedy.  You unexpectedly find yourself filled with a mixture of dark emotions as Miles stares into the mirror on the bureau, not liking what he sees and feeling disgust over what he's just done.  The second scene is when Miles is explaining to Maya why he likes and maybe subconsciously identifies with a particular type of grape.  Maya then explains to him the things that drew her to an appreciation of good wine, especially how a bottle of wine is alive and constantly developing and how it can taste different from one moment to the next.  This scene is definitely one of Virginia Madsen's best.  The third scene in the movie is near the end when Jack is literally begging Miles to help him retrieve his lost wallet because it has the wedding rings in it.  Jack finally admits that he's done a bad thing and that he doesn't want to lose his fianc&eacute;.  This is powerful acting by both Giamatti and Church.  The expression on their faces captured perfectly the heart-felt emotions that two friends can have for each other, knowing that it's impossible not to help the other.  Alexander Payne, the director of Sideways, is going to have hard time trying to surpass this masterpiece of a film.

889055,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0007RUSGW,Wheelchair Assassin,"[5, 9]","Since it's tough to classify (it's not quite a comedy, not quite a drama, and not quite anything else) and  it rewards repeated viewing, it's probably no surprise that Sideways wasn't exactly a commercial blockbuster on the level of Jurassic Park, but that didn't stop it from being probably the best movie released last year.  Although granted, I've been a total Alexander Payne sycophant since I went and saw Election back when I was 20, so I may be somewhat biased.  There's just something he manages to put in every one of his movies that can appeal to just about anyone who takes the time to appreciate them, and this one is no exception.  Sideways is certainly far from the twisted and violent fare I typically patronize, but no matter.  I also hate wine, which occupies a good deal of the focus in this movie, but that proved to be nothing more than a minor stumbling block as well.  This is, to put it simply, a brilliant movie, sometimes not all that easy to watch but in the end all the better for it.  Those accustomed to movies with tidy plots and unambiguous endings will probably find themselves disappointed with this one, but I actually found its irregular rhythms and relaxed pace to be a welcome deviation from the norm.  Sideways is filled with open spaces, uncomfortable silences, and some truly painful moments, but it's also filled with hilarious, deadpan dialogue, occasionally unlikable but persistently believable characters, and random bits of outrageous slapstick humor and unforgettable imagery.  At its best, this movie perfectly captures the boredom, frustration, and mounting indignities of lives that don't turn out the way we think they will.  Not to mention, it further demonstrates Payne's genius when it comes finding meaning and hilarity in the lives of completely ordinary people.Payne has long since demonstrated a knack for crafting characters who are deeply flawed but strangely sympathetic at the same time, and in Miles Raymond he may have his best protagonist yet.  Played in note-perfect fashion down to the minutest facial expression by Paul Giamatti, Miles is a pudgy bundle of nerves, hangups, and regrets who could turn a trip to the bathroom into an occasion for negativity and self-loathing.  This guy is, for lack of a better term, a tool, but at the same time he's the kind of tool you can easily find yourself sympathizing with, even rooting for, in spite of his many less-than-stellar qualities.  Stuck teaching English to eighth-graders while he tries to get his mammoth novel published, and still trying to get over his three-year-old divorce, Miles is rocketing towards middle age and clearly primed for a blowup.  At more than one point in the movie, I found myself thinking Miles was a prime candidate to be found dangling at the end of a rope in his bachelor pad by the end.It's against this backdrop that Miles embarks on a weeklong bachelor-party trip to California wine country with Jack (Thomas Haden Church), his mismatched best buddy, who's looking to score some action before his wedding.  Jack is everything Miles isn't: a laid-back, charming, seat-of-his-pants-living actor who means well but seems completely oblivious to the consequences of his actions.  Although it starts out promisingly enough, the trip quickly becomes an ordeal for Miles as his lack of anything meaningful in common with Jack and his utter discomfort in social situations become increasingly apparent.  It ends up descending into a tangle of lies, infidelity, recriminations, and resentments, as the movie explores such weighty subjects as friendship, love, and the meaning of life without ever being heavy-handed or manipulative about it. There are also plenty of classic comedy moments thrown in to lighten the mood a bit, a few of which rival even anything from Election in terms of hilarity: Miles's erm, vehement objections to ordering Merlot on a double date; his complete meltdown at a low-grade winery when he can't get enough to drink; his discovery of Jack violating a woman in their hotel room; and of course the indelible image of an overweight couple having makeup sex.In a wise move, Payne decides to leave the camera on Miles througout the movie (repeating the device he used with Jack Nicholson's character in About Schmidt), a strategy that pays off as we get to see him at his highest and (mostly) lowest moments, capturing the mounting desperation and alienation that he experiences.  This is obviously a guy who has major difficulty connecting with people, a trait that's certainly not going to serve him well as he continues getting older and less attractive.  The only hope he manages to find comes in the form of Mya (Virginia Madsen, who's old enough to be my much older sister but still pretty hot), a local waitress with whom he manages to form an unlikely connection in spite of himself.  To its credit, though, the movie even leaves that relationship open-ended, as there's ultimately only a hint of an indication where it's going to end up, fitting the air of uncertainty that generally prevails.  The depiction of their relationship is kept pretty low-key, but in a movie that's generally as subdued as this one it wouldn't feel right otherwise.Just in the case the movie isn't enough (which it should be) the DVD edition comes with a commentary from Giamatti and Church that just may be the BEST COMMENTARY TRACK EVER, even better than the classic Henry Hill commentary from the special edition of Goodfellas.  Too many director commentaries wind up dwelling excessively on the technical aspects of the movies, but obviously there's no concern about that here, as the two actors seem intent on just having a good time.  The tone of the commentary is mock pretentious and consistently self-deprecating, as Giamatti and Church spend two hours making high-toned allusions and ripping on themselves as well as occasionally talking about the movie.  At some points it's even funnier than the movie itself, which is saying something.  Not to mention, it reveals that Paul Giamatti is the son of none other than A. Bartlett Giamatti, the late former commissioner of Major League Baseball best known for banning Pete Rose, one of those little-known facts that are always nice to find out when watching a DVD.  Oh and of course, it goes without saying that you should pick up the widescreen edition, as the transfer you get with it is decidedly excellent.",5,"""I'm not drinkin' any bleepin'

889060,AMMEMPM9MPS55,B0007RUSGW,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[2, 4]","I watched this twice on two consecutive days, and then vowed not to watch it again for a while - I have a tendency to indulge in too much of a good thing, and it ruins the experience. As it was, I really savoured this wonderful comic drama.The story concerns a would-be-novelist and wine connoisseur, divorced and depressed, dissatisfied as a high-school English teacher, and struggling financially. It's his best friend's wedding, and the two of them take off into Californian wine country for a last bit of fun together.This central relationship is beautifully portrayed. The two are poles apart on every level, having in common only the fact they shared a room together in college, and yet they share a strong bond that goes deep.Paul Giamatti's performance as Miles is the backbone of the film. You're always wondering what he's thinking, and even though for a long time you're unsure whether you even really *like* him, he immediately garners our sympathy, because his pain shows through in so many ways. He invests the character with all kinds of nuances.Having praised Giammati's performance, let's not underrate his support. His scenes with Virginia Madsen are particularly poignant. The porch scene, in which the script gets heavily into wine-as-metaphor-for-life territory, could have been disastrously pretentious, but it works because of two perfect performances and because it is obvious the characters are aware of what's going on - she's trying to communicate with something deep inside Miles, while he's trying to fasten his seatbelt and avoid getting close. Their deep connection, her warm heart and his hurt are so evident.Other delights in the film are the Californian landscape and Guy Rolfe's quirky, jazzy score. Payne is a great storyteller, and throws in lots of neat devices to tell us more about the characters and the story without having to hit us in the face with the script all the time.",5,"Like fine wine, holding many pleasures",1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,1917,"['watched', 'twice', 'two', 'consecutive', 'days', 'then', 'vowed', 'not', 'watch', 'again', 'while', 'have', 'tendency', 'indulge', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'experience', 'was', 'really', 'savoured', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'drama.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'would-be-novelist', 'wine', 'connoisseur', 'divorced', 'depressed', 'dissatisfied', 'high-school', 'English', 'teacher', 'struggling', 'financially', 'best', 'friend', 'wedding', 'two', 'take', 'off', 'Californian', 'wine', 'country', 'last', 'bit', 'fun', 'together.This', 'central', 'relationship', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'two', 'are', 'poles', 'apart', 'level', 'having', 'common', 'only', 'fact', 'shared', 'room', 'together', 'college', 'yet', 'share', 'strong', 'bond', 'deep.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'performance', 'Miles', 'backbone', 'film', ""'re"", 'always', 'wondering', 'what', 'thinking', 'even', 'long', 'time', ""'re"", 'unsure', 'even', 'really', '*like*', 'immediately', 'sympathy', 'pain', 'shows', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'character', 'kinds', 'nuances.Having', 'praised', 'Giammati', 'performance', 'let', 'not', 'underrate', 'support', 'scenes', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'are', 'particularly', 'poignant', 'porch', 'scene', 'script', 'heavily', 'wine-as-metaphor-for-life', 'territory', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'disastrously', 'pretentious', 'two', 'perfect', 'performances', 'obvious', 'characters', 'are', 'aware', 'what', 'going', 'trying', 'communicate', 'something', 'deep', 'inside', 'Miles', 'trying', 'fasten', 'seatbelt', 'avoid', 'getting', 'close', 'deep', 'connection', 'warm', 'heart', 'hurt', 'are', 'so', 'evident.Other', 'delights', 'film', 'are', 'Californian', 'landscape', 'Guy', 'Rolfe', 'quirky', 'jazzy', 'score', 'Payne', 'great', 'storyteller', 'lots', 'neat', 'devices', 'tell', 'more', 'characters', 'story', 'having', 'hit', 'face', 'script', 'time']",Sideways (Region 2)

A funny thing with hype is that it raises the bar on the quality of the movie which makes it hard to live up to yet with all that publicity the movie has a better success rate. It's a no-win situation.But overall Sideways does come out on top although it's not meant for all audiences (besides the R rating) you need to have gone through the ups & downs of life to experience what Paul Giamatti is going through & me being divorced know exactly how that feels (especially the Xanax phase).Reading some of the earlier reviews, I've noticed reviewers branding Giamatti & Thomas Haden Church, as loosers! Well I don't know about Church but Giamatti is definitely not. There is a thin line between being human with feelings & a looser. People like Giamatti put a lot of emotion & feeling in what they do be it wine tasting, experiencing gourmet cooking or writing a novel so when something goes wrong it sort of eats away at their soul; its more like an amalgamation of midlife crisis, loss & low sense of worth. A deadly combination, whichever way you look at it.There is no shortage of human emotion in this movie although I really thought Giamatti ought to have been nominated for an Oscar as opposed to Church; don't get me wrong I like Thomas Haden Church, I've been a fan of his ever since Wings & Ned & Stacy, he's good, versatile & overall quite believable but I think Giamatti takes the cake in this movie & a great choice for his role.Verdict: Overall quite an enjoyable movie with some really witty dialogue not to mention the mini-plots within the main plot. It strikes a decent balance between good filmmaking & a modern-day romantic comedy.Rating: 4 &  stars for a well written movie made with a lot of emotion & creditable performance.",5,Back To Basics,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,2058,"['remember', 'when', 'was', 'time', 'used', 'watch', 'movies', 'entertainment', 'good', 'editing', 'good', 'direction', 'excellent', 'scripts', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'went', 'back', 'basics', 'create', 'masterpiece.The', 'only', 'thing', 'equally', 'harmed', 'movie', 'yet', 'made', 'success', 'was', 'hype', 'funny', 'thing', 'hype', 'bar', 'quality', 'movie', 'hard', 'live', 'up', 'yet', 'publicity', 'movie', 'better', 'success', 'rate', 'no-win', 'situation.But', 'overall', 'Sideways', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'not', 'meant', 'audiences', 'R', 'rating', 'need', 'have', 'gone', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'experience', 'what', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'going', 'being', 'divorced', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'especially', 'Xanax', 'phase', '.Reading', 'earlier', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'reviewers', 'branding', 'Giamatti', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'loosers', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Church', 'Giamatti', 'definitely', 'not', 'thin', 'line', 'being', 'human', 'feelings', 'looser', 'People', 'Giamatti', 'put', 'lot', 'emotion', 'feeling', 'what', 'do', 'be', 'wine', 'tasting', 'experiencing', 'gourmet', 'cooking', 'writing', 'novel', 'so', 'when', 'something', 'wrong', 'sort', 'eats', 'away', 'soul', 'more', 'amalgamation', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'loss', 'low', 'sense', 'worth', 'deadly', 'combination', 'whichever', 'way', 'look', 'shortage', 'human', 'emotion', 'movie', 'really', 'thought', 'Giamatti', 'ought', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'opposed', 'Church', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'ever', 'Wings', 'Ned', 'Stacy', 'good', 'versatile', 'overall', 'quite', 'believable', 'think', 'Giamatti', 'cake', 'movie', 'great', 'choice', 'role.Verdict', 'Overall', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'really', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'not', 'mention', 'mini-plots', 'main', 'plot', 'decent', 'balance', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'modern-day', 'romantic', 'comedy.Rating', '4', 'stars', 'well', 'written', 'movie', 'made', 'lot', 'emotion', 'creditable', 'performance']",Sideways (Region 2)
889062,A1SMTC16E3UW9T,B0007RUSGW,"Yogesh. Pama ""Yogesh""","[14, 27]","I have only just seen the film, having been obliged to await its arrival on DVD with eager anticipation, as the Oscar nomination and several reviewers spoke so overwhelmingly in its favour.Let me begin by stating that I am completely mystified by the film's positive reception and, so much so, that I feel compelled to air my views publicly. Although most of the performances are certainly acceptable if even excellent by notably the lead and the two main actresses and several of the supporting cast, I personally found it hard to look at the main actor's sidekick, who reminded me uncomfortably of Schwartzenegger with a bad wig. In his defense, I should probably add that he did the best that could have been expected from him with the disgusting part that was written for him.Having said this, my main objection to the film, however, was its unapologetic, torrid subject matter, which actually propogates (and almost approves) of conduct so unbecoming that it left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.  The script also makes absolutely no attempt to excuse the errant behaviour of its main persona.  Of course people such as this probably do exist, but I wish to suggest that too many of their reactions were contrived and ridiculously improbable:  allow me to name the retrieval of the wallet merely as as one such example, but in the end, there are simply too many examples such as this, not to destroy the film's credibility altogether.I was equally appalled by the script's suggestion that wine-tasting by apparent connoisseurs and uncontrolled inebriation may go hand in hand, not to mention its condonation of the sexual mores of its principal characters.  I am by no means conservative or a moralist, but do believe that conduct such of this in a relatively serious film, needs to be qualified to avoid creating the impression that this would be considered normal behaviour under the circumstances.I was equally appalled by the shallowness of the script, the cliched camera work and its heavy-handed and its insensitive approach to life and people in general.In fact, many scenes which were clearly intended to be humerous, failed miserably and merely managed to make me feel vaguely uncomfortable and embarrassed.Finally I would like to end by saying that I find it almost impossible to believe that the film's reviewers were not influenced by reasons of their own.  I do not believe this to simply be a matter of taste.  As the film deals with the consumption of excellent wines to the extent that it does, it would do to be reminded that there exists a very definite distinction between good and bad wines.  Apropos more than a merely superficial inspection this film cannot possibly be considered a good vintage and most certainly one undeserving of its acclaim, the remarkable presence of which prompted this entirely superfluous letter.Yogesh Pama",2,A very ordinary wine at best,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,2863,"['have', 'only', 'just', 'seen', 'film', 'having', 'been', 'obliged', 'await', 'arrival', 'DVD', 'eager', 'anticipation', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'several', 'reviewers', 'spoke', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'favour.Let', 'begin', 'stating', 'am', 'completely', 'mystified', 'film', 'positive', 'reception', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'feel', 'compelled', 'air', 'views', 'publicly', 'most', 'performances', 'are', 'certainly', 'acceptable', 'even', 'excellent', 'notably', 'lead', 'two', 'main', 'actresses', 'several', 'supporting', 'cast', 'personally', 'found', 'hard', 'look', 'main', 'actor', 'sidekick', 'who', 'reminded', 'uncomfortably', 'Schwartzenegger', 'bad', 'wig', 'defense', 'should', 'probably', 'add', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'disgusting', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'him.Having', 'said', 'main', 'objection', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'unapologetic', 'torrid', 'subject', 'matter', 'actually', 'almost', 'approves', 'conduct', 'so', 'unbecoming', 'left', 'extremely', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'script', 'also', 'absolutely', 'attempt', 'excuse', 'errant', 'behaviour', 'main', 'persona', 'course', 'people', 'such', 'probably', 'do', 'exist', 'wish', 'suggest', 'too', 'many', 'reactions', 'were', 'contrived', 'ridiculously', 'improbable', 'allow', 'name', 'retrieval', 'wallet', 'merely', 'one', 'such', 'example', 'end', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'examples', 'such', 'not', 'destroy', 'film', 'credibility', 'altogether.I', 'was', 'equally', 'appalled', 'script', 'suggestion', 'wine-tasting', 'apparent', 'connoisseurs', 'uncontrolled', 'inebriation', 'may', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'not', 'mention', 'condonation', 'sexual', 'mores', 'principal', 'characters', 'am', 'means', 'conservative', 'moralist', 'do', 'believe', 'conduct', 'such', 'relatively', 'serious', 'film', 'be', 'qualified', 'avoid', 'creating', 'impression', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'normal', 'behaviour', 'circumstances.I', 'was', 'equally', 'appalled', 'shallowness', 'script', 'cliched', 'camera', 'work', 'heavy-handed', 'insensitive', 'approach', 'life', 'people', 'general.In', 'fact', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'clearly', 'intended', 'be', 'humerous', 'failed', 'miserably', 'merely', 'managed', 'make', 'feel', 'vaguely', 'uncomfortable', 'embarrassed.Finally', 'would', 'like', 'end', 'saying', 'find', 'almost', 'impossible', 'believe', 'film', 'reviewers', 'were', 'not', 'influenced', 'reasons', 'own', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'simply', 'be', 'matter', 'taste', 'film', 'deals', 'consumption', 'excellent', 'wines', 'extent', 'would', 'do', 'be', 'reminded', 'very', 'definite', 'distinction', 'good', 'bad', 'wines', 'Apropos', 'more', 'merely', 'superficial', 'inspection', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'vintage', 'most', 'certainly', 'one', 'undeserving', 'acclaim', 'remarkable', 'presence', 'prompted', 'entirely', 'superfluous', 'letter.Yogesh', 'Pama']",Sideways (Region 2)
