960773,A3GML6TLG3TH6E,B000CQM4YM,"Adam Barnett ""Freddy""","[7, 13]",I've been waiting a long time for Sam to return to DVD. Here we continue on the journey of Sam and Al more fantastic adventures in time. A remark was made as to season 3's copy of Die hard music well if that being the case its great that they waited. Now I think I have to make a comment about the other seasons as compared to Season 4. Does anyone notice how they pieced together the previous seasons to where at the end of some of the episodes they do not correspond to the next episode on the disc? I mean what the heck is that? Now I'm not complaining about this either but in Season 2 the face cover as they see some of the episodes that are supposed to be in that disc set are actually upcomming seasons such as Season 4 where Al and Sam trade places in leaps at the end of Season 3's Shock Theatre. Okay now that I have given my two cents on that. I want to fully reccomend to you fans out there to get this season its what a lot of us have been waiting for. Here's to they get Season 5 out soon as possible.,5,Quantum Leap Season 4,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,1015,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'Sam', 'return', 'DVD', 'Here', 'continue', 'journey', 'Sam', 'Al', 'more', 'fantastic', 'adventures', 'time', 'remark', 'was', 'made', 'season', '3', 'copy', 'Die', 'hard', 'music', 'well', 'being', 'case', 'great', 'waited', 'Now', 'think', 'have', 'make', 'comment', 'other', 'seasons', 'compared', 'Season', '4', 'Does', 'anyone', 'notice', 'how', 'pieced', 'together', 'previous', 'seasons', 'where', 'end', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'correspond', 'next', 'episode', 'disc', 'mean', 'what', 'heck', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'Season', '2', 'face', 'cover', 'see', 'episodes', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'disc', 'set', 'are', 'actually', 'upcomming', 'seasons', 'such', 'Season', '4', 'where', 'Al', 'Sam', 'trade', 'places', 'leaps', 'end', 'Season', '3', 'Shock', 'Theatre', 'Okay', 'now', 'have', 'given', 'two', 'cents', 'want', 'fully', 'reccomend', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'get', 'season', 'what', 'lot', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'Here', 'get', 'Season', '5', 'out', 'soon', 'possible']",Quantum Leap: The Complete Fourth Season

960780,A1WUEAZFC6QSCT,B000CQM4YM,"D.B.K. ""dbkinstc""","[25, 26]","Just thought I would weigh in on the music controversy.  I don't have a particularly strong positive or negative feeling about it, but wanted to add some logic to the equation.  I can't help it; I'm an engineer.I, too, felt that the stories seemed a little flat and did not know why until I started reading about the missing music in these reviews.  One of the complaints stood out because of the glaring mathematical error.One of the reviewers said he heard that the music companies wanted $10,000 a song.  The reviewer stated that if they sold as few as 10,000 DVDs, they'd only have to charge an extra dollar each - a price nearly every fan would be willing to pay.  The error is that that assumes there is only ONE SONG per season worth buying.  These aren't single episode DVDs, but DVD sets - a complete season.  What if (as is more likely) it is a song (or two) per episode?  That changes the final cost significantly.Even so, it would come down to how many copies of the season sets they could sell.  If the price went up by $5, it would make a bigger difference in how many people would be willing to buy them.  On the other hand, if they are selling a quarter million sets for each season, then the reviewer's extra dollar per DVD is back in play and that little amount should not have been an issue.My other take on this situation is that we are griping to the wrong people.  I think we ought to complain to the music companies for being so greedy and stupid.  It's counter-productive anyway.  They should let the music go for a song.  (Sorry, I couldn't help that one.)  When people hear this great music, they are tempted to buy more CDs.  The music companies are missing a huge advertising opportunity.  D'oh!!!I'm buying the DVD sets anyway.

I'm impressed with how entertaining this episode is, while also dealing with a wide range of the issues around homophobia (including internalised homophobia).I particularly appreciate that Sam is totally at ease in his temporary new skin as naval sports jock Tommy - readily accepting Ziggy's strong prediction (86%) that Tommy is gay.Previous seasons of Quantum Leap have informed us that Sam Beckett is honest, compassionate and refreshingly free of prejudice. And so in this program Sam quickly pulls Al back into line for making ill-informed value judgements about Tommy's natural mannerisms.This show has relevance to gays to the military - but it's really a universal statement that homophobia is everyone's problem.I've always had a crush on Scott Bakula (and a boyhood crush on Dean Stockwell).

I ended up having a complete & utter break about halfway through the season - I was on holiday for two weeks, but I reckon I stopped watching it close to four weeks! I can't describe how disappointed I was in this series. It was so bland compared to the previous ones, and there were very few standout episodes in my opinion. It wasn't going downhill, but I reckon the makers knew they were heading for a close, as for me, it was getting way too repetitive.Season three ended with Sam & Al switching places, and as Al had the link to Ziggy, they couldn't swap, and Sam had no way of contacting Ziggy. 'The Leap Back' was a shockingly sad way to start the season, and I think I've worked out how it's going to end, which is probably why I'm on such a downer about the whole season. It was a good way to start the series, as we did see Sam go back to the future, see his wife, and see everybody, leaving Al to do the leaping. But just for an episode. How funny was Al?!My other favourite episodes include:Raped, where Sam leaps into a young girl who has been raped and no one believes her, as the attacker is a popular guy. This was a very emotional episode, and quite sad at points. And once more, we get to see Sam dressed as a woman. They liked doing this to Scott, didn't they?The Wrong Stuff, which is straight after Raped, and makes for an absolutely hilarious episode! Sam leaps into a CHIMP and as to be one of the highlights of the entire show. There are some sad moments, and some funny moments, when a female chimp falls for Sam's chimp body. Give us a kiss!Running For Honour resorts back to the earlier seasons, by using a prejudice as the story line. This time it's about a fellow classmate of Sam's who will die at the hands of his classmates because of his sexuality.Temptation Eyes was absolutely stunning, as a psychic in a serial killer's case can see Sam for who he really is, and it's again, quite an emotional episode when they fall in love (lust?), and Sam doesn't want to leap. It causes some funny moments as she can sense Al by feeling a strange energy in the room when he's there.A Song For The Soul gets Sam once again dressed as a young girl, in a three-girl group in the sixties, trying to keep the lead singer out of the clutches of a very predatory man. Sam's all arms and legs and seeing him trying to dance and sing at the same time was hilarious. Although he doesn't sing properly. Boo. Loving the pink sequins too.Ghost Ship was an excellent episode, as Sam is a pilot (again) trying to get to Bermuda to save a passenger with a burst appendix, but that means getting through the Bermuda Triangle. I don't know enough about this to understand it, but watching Al's reactions was so funny (""UFOs?! Where?!""). The co-pilot also has a history of being in the Bermuda Triangle. Being in the Bermuda Triangle also means that Sam & Al lose their connection. Al trying to say 'appendicitis' was definitely the highlight of the episode, and had me crying with laughter.It's A Wonderful Leap was another funny episode as Sam knocks over his 'guardian angel', who can see who he is and can actually see Al. Which causes some problems as she doesn't like Al and his taste in clothes, and he doesn't like her! Cue some funny faces from Dean Stockwell.A Leap For Lisa rounded up the series, but I was quite disappointed in the last episode. Sam leaps into a very young Al, who's accused of raping & murdering a woman. Sam has to change this, but keeps changing history the wrong way, sending Al to the gas chamber! An old guy replaces Al, Tina is married to Gushi, and Ziggy is now called Alpha and a male! Thankfully, Sam manages to change things the right way, and Al reappears with apparently no recollection of what happened. It doesn't end on much of a cliff-hanger in my opinion either, it doesn't make me that eager to see the next series, but I will.

960797,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000CQM4YM,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[3, 3]","I would have to say that Quantum Leap is one of my favorite televisions shows of all time.  The key behind the success of this show was the chemistry between Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell.  The manner in which these two actors interact is really the heart of Quantum Leap.The premise of this show is basically Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) leaps (euphuism for time travel) into a person's body in order to ""make right that once went wrong"".  When Sam leaps into a person his only guide is Al (Dean Stockwell).  Al is from the same time Sam is from and steps into a chamber that allows only Sam to see Al as a hologram.  Al provides insight on what Sam is suppose to do in order to ""leap"".  The hope is that Sam will leap home (back to his own time).  Mind you there is a bit more to this show, but this is the series in a nutshell.The thing that made this show so wonderful is that each week the theme of the show would be different, due to the fact that Sam would be ""leaping"" into different scenarios.  One week the show would be a comedy, a drama, an adventure, a romance, a thriller and so forth. Quantum Leap sadly only ran for five seasons before it was cancelled.I have to say that out of the ninety-six episodes made there really isn't one that I don't like.  I choose to review season four because this season was very dark and edge. This might not seem like much of a big deal today, but in 1991/1992 the playing field on public television was a little different.  There were twenty-two episodes in season four of Quantum Leap the following are some of the darker and edger episodes:- Hurricane: Sam leaps into a sheriff who must stop a woman from being killed by a hurricane, or perhaps an ex-lover?- Justice: Sam leaps into a man who just joined the Ku Klux Klan and must prevent a black civil rights leader from being lynched by the Klan.  This is a great episode that touches many social issues.- Permanent Wave: Sam leaps into a hairdresser who is living with a single mother and her son.  When the child witnesses a murder, Sam must keep the killer from slaughtering the boy.- Raped: Sam leaps into a girl named Katie, who has just been raped. Sam has to make sure the person who raped Katie is brought to justice.  However, the only suspect is the town hero.  This episode really pushed the envelope.- Dreams:  Sam leaps into a cop investigating a multiple homicide.  However the haunting childhood memories this cop has experienced are now affecting Sam.- Running For Honor: Sam leaps into a cadet at a Naval Academy who might be homosexual.  Sam must stop his former roommate (who is gay) from being killed via a hate crime.  This episode also really pushed social issues.- Temptation Eyes: Sam leaps into a television reporter in San Francisco.  Sam ends up working with a psychic on solving a murder.  The twist is that this psychic knows that Sam is a time traveler.- Moments to Live: Sam leaps into a soap opera star that is kidnapped by his number one fan, which happens to suffer from borderline personality disorder.- The Curse of Ptah-Hotep: Sam leaps into an archeologist who finds a Pharaohs' tomb and curse.- Leap for Lisa: Sam leaps into Al when he was still serving in the military. Al is put on trial for murder of his commander's wife.  Sam makes some dubious choices that result in changing Al's future and not for the better!As for the DVD set itself there are three dual sided discs, not my personal favorite.  I would prefer six discs to the three dual sided.  As for special features......there really aren't any.  I must be honest, special features would have been great but I am just so happy that these shows are available on DVD.  From my understanding Universal has changed some of the music played in certain episodes for copyright reasons.  It had been so long since the original shows aired and when this DVD was released that I don't even remember where the music was changed. Let the record state I am not thrilled that some of the music has been changed, but I am not going boycott the show or this DVD set.Quantum Leap was a great show that really was different.  I think that was both its curse and blessing.  These episodes, for the most part, have aged nicely and since the show is about time traveling there is an ageless aspect.

Hence TV shows would utilize pop music (aka those pop shows from the 80s that included rock music during 3 minute empty driving-around scenes) and it was novel and rather cool at the time, I must admit...QL did the same thing as needed, also because QL took place in America's past and the music was relevant to the story - not because it was a novel gimmick.I've yet to buy ANY of the QL releases because, quite frankly, such filleting of these episodes out of ""marketable necessity"" makes them, quite frankly, ""not economically viable"" for me AS A CUSTOMER.The day this series comes out proper is the day I will buy them.  Not a day before.Indeed.  I know that the base price for a song can be rather high.  Other TV shows that do have the original music have the creators, in commentary, saying how much they've spent (if nothing more to aggrevate the suits, LOL).  The average cost seems $10,000 for one song.  How many people buy these DVD sets?  If ONLY 10,000 people bought them, then you'd only have to raise the price of each set by a one whopping dollar!  OMG!  What a fortune!  Is that too much extra money to ask a consumer to pay?

960799,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000CQM4YM,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[44, 46]","The best of times--Another leap forward for the series as we got a number of memorable episodes that played with the format of the show. Among the highlights of this season--In ""The Leap Back"" Sam and Al switch places when lightning hits just as Sam is about to make his leap.  ""Raped"" is a memorable episode where Sam is thrown into the body of a woman who has been raped. No one wants to believe ""her"" because the person accused is the son of a prominent member of the community. In ""Temptation Eyes"" a serial murderer is at work and Sam becomes a TV reporter that must prevent the psychic helping the police from becoming the next victim. Sadly ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" is missing (if I'm correctly remembering it being int he episode).""It's a Wonderful Leap"" has Sam as a New York cab driver trying to earn his medallion. He runs over a lady who claims to be an angel there to help Sam achieve his mission which makes it tough for Al because the two don't get along. ""A Leap for Lisa"" is a terrific episode in which Sam leaps into Al as a navy pilot facing rape and murder charges. Sam changes history by asking a key witness not to testify on his behalf and it becomes clear that Al may be put on trial.The transfer looks pretty good. The images are occasionally soft and there's dirt and debris in some of the transfers (some more than others)but on the whole acceptable. Audio is solid throughout the set. Image quality varies depending upon the amount of optical effects as well and those scenes tend to be on the softer side with more debris and dirt noticeable.It was the worst of times--There are songs that have been replaced in this set (it is at least noted on the box) but not in all the episodes. For those where the music issue looms large I'd wait for the Region 2 discs in the UK. It's sad that such a unique and terrific show should be the victim of greed (whether it is on Universal's end, the music publisher's end or both)or a lack of interest in securing the rights to important songs. Personally, I would think that the publishers would want additional exposure for their music (it can continue to lead to additional sales and with the music industry in a slump I would have thought they would see that as an important extra).We get two extras. One is a preview of the season five episode ""Liberation"" where Sam leaps into the body of a mother who must prevent her daughter from being killed at a protest. The second is a featurette that was produced for Universal's 80's TV shows. It's pretty generic but does have some interesting comments from both newspaper and TV writers. None of the extras co-producer/writer Deborah Pratt had offered Universal are included. I'm not sure what Universal's issue is with this but it would be nice if Universal actually showed that they cared what the fans felt (although that's been pretty clear with every set after the first season). This generic focuses on ""Quantum Leap"" for about 5 or 6 minutes of its nearly 20 minute running time. I would gladly forgo expensive extras if Universal would secure the rights to music to key episodes (and let the original producers decide what is key to the scenes in the episodes).Packaging is like the 3rd season with the individual slimline holders for each episode and the show is, once again, presented on dual sided DVD18 discs. Five stars for the show minus a star for the poor extras and the changes in music.",4,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...",1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,3424,"['best', 'times', 'leap', 'forward', 'series', 'got', 'number', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'played', 'format', 'show', 'highlights', 'season', 'Leap', 'Back', 'Sam', 'Al', 'switch', 'places', 'when', 'lightning', 'hits', 'just', 'Sam', 'make', 'leap', 'Raped', 'memorable', 'episode', 'where', 'Sam', 'thrown', 'body', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'raped', 'one', 'believe', 'person', 'accused', 'son', 'prominent', 'member', 'community', 'Temptation', 'Eyes', 'serial', 'murderer', 'work', 'Sam', 'TV', 'reporter', 'must', 'prevent', 'psychic', 'helping', 'police', 'becoming', 'next', 'victim', 'Sadly', 'Want', 'Know', 'What', 'Love', 'Is', 'missing', ""'m"", 'correctly', 'remembering', 'being', 'int', 'episode', 'Wonderful', 'Leap', 'Sam', 'New', 'York', 'cab', 'driver', 'trying', 'earn', 'medallion', 'lady', 'who', 'be', 'angel', 'there', 'help', 'Sam', 'achieve', 'mission', 'tough', 'Al', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'Leap', 'Lisa', 'terrific', 'episode', 'Sam', 'Al', 'navy', 'pilot', 'facing', 'rape', 'murder', 'charges', 'Sam', 'changes', 'history', 'asking', 'key', 'witness', 'not', 'testify', 'behalf', 'clear', 'Al', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'trial.The', 'transfer', 'pretty', 'good', 'images', 'are', 'occasionally', 'soft', 'dirt', 'debris', 'transfers', 'more', 'others', 'whole', 'acceptable', 'Audio', 'solid', 'set', 'Image', 'quality', 'varies', 'depending', 'amount', 'optical', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'tend', 'be', 'softer', 'side', 'more', 'debris', 'dirt', 'noticeable.It', 'was', 'worst', 'times', 'are', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'set', 'least', 'noted', 'box', 'not', 'episodes', 'where', 'music', 'issue', 'large', ""'d"", 'wait', 'Region', '2', 'discs', 'UK', 'sad', 'unique', 'terrific', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'victim', 'greed', 'Universal', 'end', 'music', 'publisher', 'end', 'lack', 'interest', 'securing', 'rights', 'important', 'songs', 'Personally', 'would', 'think', 'publishers', 'would', 'want', 'additional', 'exposure', 'music', 'can', 'continue', 'lead', 'additional', 'sales', 'music', 'industry', 'slump', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'see', 'important', 'extra', 'get', 'two', 'extras', 'One', 'preview', 'season', 'five', 'episode', 'Liberation', 'where', 'Sam', 'body', 'mother', 'who', 'must', 'prevent', 'daughter', 'being', 'killed', 'protest', 'second', 'featurette', 'was', 'produced', 'Universal', '80', 'TV', 'shows', 'pretty', 'generic', 'have', 'interesting', 'comments', 'newspaper', 'TV', 'writers', 'None', 'extras', 'co-producer/writer', 'Deborah', 'Pratt', 'had', 'offered', 'Universal', 'are', 'included', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Universal', 'issue', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'Universal', 'actually', 'showed', 'cared', 'what', 'fans', 'felt', 'been', 'pretty', 'clear', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'generic', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'about', '5', '6', 'minutes', 'nearly', '20', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'would', 'gladly', 'forgo', 'expensive', 'extras', 'Universal', 'would', 'secure', 'rights', 'music', 'key', 'episodes', 'let', 'original', 'producers', 'decide', 'what', 'key', 'scenes', 'episodes', '.Packaging', '3rd', 'season', 'individual', 'slimline', 'holders', 'episode', 'show', 'once', 'again', 'presented', 'dual', 'sided', 'DVD18', 'discs', 'Five', 'stars', 'show', 'star', 'poor', 'extras', 'changes', 'music']",Quantum Leap: The Complete Fourth Season
