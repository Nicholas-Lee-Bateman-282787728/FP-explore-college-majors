IT IS A MOST INTERESTING ROLE FOR THIS STAR AND VERY WELL ACTED. HIS ROLE IS ABOUT A LIKEABLE AGING BUT YET SEDUCTIVE TEACHER/PROFESSOR. THIS IS A DIFFERENT SOFTER CHARACTER PART FROM SOME OF HIS PREVIOUS ROLES SHOWING THE DRAMATIC OFTEN VICIOUS SIDE OF HIM. THERE ARE ONLY THREE MAIN ROLES, HIS AND THAT OF TWO YOUNGER STUDENTS, ONE MALE AND ONE FEMALE. ANY FAN OF RH SHOULD ENJOY THIS ONE AND ADD IT TO THEIR COLLECTION...IF THEY CAN FIND A COPY. I SAW IT ON TV BUT WASN'T ABLE TO LOCATE A DVD OF THE SAME. I WAS SO WAS SURPRISED WHEN I FINALLLY FOUND IT LISTED THAT I SNATCHED IT UP IMMEDIATELY.

1366529,A1LMQHB3ZANNVN,B003UYP1Z2,C. Oliver,"[4, 7]","I saw this movie in 2007, as a youthful and budding writer.  It had the most lasting effect on me that any film has ever had.  It was on Starz.  I quickly came to Amazon only to discover it wasn't available.  I searched the web only to discover it wasn't anywhere.  I saw the movie a second time, this time, I only missed twenty minutes of the beginning, and I put in a tape.  I watched the tape a few times in the next six months and then missed it on television when the opportunity arised to watch it.  I swore that I would catch it the next time.  Now that it is available on Amazon to purchase, this top notch Indie film, that is a bit rough around the edges, is worth the money.The movie goes around a college professor now in his thirties who gets word that his mentor has passed away.  As he goes to the funeral we get flashbacks to this mentorship.  Including his seduction of the young woman his mentor had seduced before him.  The film has a few pacing issues, as many films that use flashbacks to tell the story do.  But this film was to me one of the most interesting and unique films I had had the privilege of watching.  I say privilege, because I always considered it an amazing coincidence that I would run upon this film on the rare occasion that it would play on the Starz network.The movie has great acting from all the cast and a strong script.  At times the story can be a bit cluttered, which is why, even though after two years of having not even seen this film, I can still remember lines from it, and yet I give it four stars.  I don't know how others will react to it.  I do know this is a good movie and worth the watch, if not the purchase.  At worst, I say, get it used.  I don't think you'll regret it.",4,By Far The Most Lasting Film I've Watched,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1733,"['saw', 'movie', '2007', 'youthful', 'budding', 'writer', 'had', 'most', 'lasting', 'effect', 'film', 'ever', 'had', 'was', 'Starz', 'quickly', 'came', 'Amazon', 'only', 'discover', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'searched', 'web', 'only', 'discover', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'saw', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'time', 'only', 'missed', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'put', 'tape', 'watched', 'tape', 'few', 'times', 'next', 'six', 'months', 'then', 'missed', 'television', 'when', 'opportunity', 'arised', 'watch', 'swore', 'would', 'catch', 'next', 'time', 'Now', 'available', 'Amazon', 'purchase', 'top', 'notch', 'Indie', 'film', 'bit', 'rough', 'edges', 'money.The', 'movie', 'college', 'professor', 'now', 'thirties', 'who', 'word', 'mentor', 'passed', 'away', 'funeral', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'mentorship', 'Including', 'seduction', 'young', 'woman', 'mentor', 'had', 'seduced', 'film', 'few', 'pacing', 'issues', 'many', 'films', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'tell', 'story', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'unique', 'films', 'had', 'had', 'privilege', 'watching', 'say', 'privilege', 'always', 'considered', 'amazing', 'coincidence', 'would', 'run', 'film', 'rare', 'occasion', 'would', 'play', 'Starz', 'network.The', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'cast', 'strong', 'script', 'times', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'cluttered', 'why', 'even', 'two', 'years', 'having', 'not', 'even', 'seen', 'film', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'lines', 'yet', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'others', 'will', 'react', 'do', 'know', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'not', 'purchase', 'worst', 'say', 'get', 'used', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'regret']",N/A
1366530,AVUZRNQBB3S6G,B003UYP1Z2,Keith Nichols,"[2, 4]","This flick seems to be the outline of a possible plot.  Aside from Rutger Hauer, it features unknown actors.  The story is told in flashbacks that establish that a male graduate student has, on the recommendation of his major professor, become an English teacher in some college (none of the schools or locations in the film are identified, although Ivy-League country is suggested by the action's apparent proximity to New York City).  In flashback, we find that Hauer is that major professor, a noted author of some sort of books -- novels I gather -- and that the graduate student has pursued a sporadic sexual relationship with the prof's comely graduate assistant, who is already banging the prof.  The tension and action in the film arise from the assistant's preferring her stable relationship with the prof to committing herself to the uncertain future of the student.  (One wonders how long she expects the prof to need her once her graduate-school days end and he takes on another assistant.)  Flashes forward and back then reveal the death of the prof and the meeting of a lawyer and the prof's two former students to settle the estate.  The girl is now a book editor in New York.  In a video, the prof bequeaths his summer house and his Porsche to the two students, and they motor off in the car, apparently to take up life together.  End of film.  One easily imagines that this sort of relationship happens in universities all over the world, although I imagine that few award the participants a house and car.  Perhaps the moral is that if you wait long enough, things sort out on their own.",3,Talented people with little to do,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,1605,"['flick', 'be', 'outline', 'possible', 'plot', 'Aside', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'unknown', 'actors', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'establish', 'male', 'graduate', 'student', 'recommendation', 'major', 'professor', 'become', 'English', 'teacher', 'college', 'none', 'schools', 'locations', 'film', 'are', 'identified', 'Ivy-League', 'country', 'suggested', 'action', 'apparent', 'proximity', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'flashback', 'find', 'Hauer', 'major', 'professor', 'noted', 'author', 'sort', 'books', 'novels', 'gather', 'graduate', 'student', 'pursued', 'sporadic', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'prof', 'comely', 'graduate', 'assistant', 'who', 'already', 'banging', 'prof', 'tension', 'action', 'film', 'arise', 'assistant', 'preferring', 'stable', 'relationship', 'prof', 'committing', 'uncertain', 'future', 'student', 'One', 'how', 'long', 'prof', 'need', 'once', 'graduate-school', 'days', 'end', 'assistant', 'Flashes', 'forward', 'back', 'then', 'reveal', 'death', 'prof', 'meeting', 'lawyer', 'prof', 'two', 'former', 'students', 'settle', 'estate', 'girl', 'now', 'book', 'editor', 'New', 'York', 'video', 'prof', 'bequeaths', 'summer', 'house', 'Porsche', 'two', 'students', 'motor', 'car', 'apparently', 'take', 'up', 'life', 'together', 'End', 'film', 'One', 'easily', 'sort', 'relationship', 'happens', 'universities', 'world', 'imagine', 'few', 'participants', 'house', 'car', 'Perhaps', 'moral', 'wait', 'long', 'enough', 'things', 'sort', 'out', 'own']",N/A
