973930,A2U5ASY5JSL2WA,B000EJ9VS4,"Bakajanaino? ""raven cat""","[0, 0]","I absolutely love this series, so I'll try to be as short and sweet about this as possible. This is a very lovely, endearing story about twelve-year-old Mitsuki (which actually means  a 'full moon' in Japanese). This anime is adapted from a shoujo manga by Arina Tanemura, who has created the most beautiful manga I've ever read. While she tends to reuse certain character facial types, etc. which she has created, if you can get over this she has a talent which is not matched by very many manga-ka.  In fact, the repetitive look of the characters can actually make you like her even more as her work is easily recognizable. Not only are the facial expressions bewitching, the clothing she gives her characters at certain times are elaborate and interestingly outlandish.  The anime is not quite as detailed as her original artwork, however this is the case with most manga-based titles.Now, about Mitsuki. Singing is her passion, but it is not an empty ambition driven by glory...she wants to sing in order to attract the attention of a special someone in her life who was separated from her long ago. She has a voice that could rival any Japanese pop-idol to boot. There's just one problem...She has a cancerous polyp in her throat which doesn't allow her to sing in a loud voice.So how does she overcome this and win the heart of the boy she has been longing to contact? And how will she climb the staircase to fame?I won't spoil the whole plot, since you want to find that out on your own. What I will say is that the animation is very true to Tanemura's unique style, and very pleasing to the eyes, which is what is important for this genre. The characters other than Mitsuki are also instantly lovable, almost fairy-tale like but with a modern twist. This series is targeted at younger teenage girls, however I think there's something everyone will enjoy about this series. It is very hope instilling, and while there are serious moments there is also a good balance between these times and the comic relief.The only complaint I have is that the ending sequence has...no sequence. At the end of the show you just hear the closing song, and the credits roll against a pink starry screen. Luckily the song is good enough to keep your attention. The opening theme song is very upbeat, and while The ' Scanty (the group who sings the opening theme) was grating on my ears at first, I find myself dancing to the theme song now. It is I' LOVE YOU, a very catchy j-pop number.You can get the individual DVDs on Amazon for a very reasonable price (I believe volume two or three costs $8.00 total), so I would suggest to buy it on this website.Any shoujo anime fan cannot be without Full Moon wo Sagashite.

Ok! I know that the English dub is horrible, so I went for the Japanese language with the English subtitles. I always go for the Japanese with the English subtitles because it sounds more original. If you can just overlook the English dub, you will love this anime for sure.The story is about a 12-year-old Mitsuki who wants desperately to become a singer, so she can fulfill her promise to her first love, Eichi. She always wanted to be a singer but her grandmother is against her dream because she is blaming Mitsuki's father who used to be a singer, for her daughter's death. There is another problem, which is that she has a malignant tumor in her throat and she has to go through an operation but she might lose her voice with this operation, so she refuses to go through with it.That's when she met the two death spirits, Takuto and Meroko. Takuto will make her into a beautiful 16-year-old girl in order to have a chance in the audition and she won. She then decided on her stage name to be, Full Moon.I wonder what will happen with Mitsuki and Takuto because it seems that Takuto has a crush on her. I like Takuto so much and I wish that he and Mitsuki will end up together.I liked the Ending theme, ""New Future"" of the first six episodes. It is so beautiful.If you're interested, you can also read the manga. I have all the volumes except for the final seventh volume, which is going to be released this month. There is a slight difference between the manga and the anime in some of the scenes but I liked the anime more.Try to watch it and you are not going to regret it, if you can just overlook the English dub.",5,Beautiful and touching!!,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,1752,"['watched', 'first', 'two', 'volumes', 'anime', 'can', 'say', 'hooking', 'interesting', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Ok', 'know', 'English', 'dub', 'horrible', 'went', 'Japanese', 'language', 'English', 'subtitles', 'always', 'go', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'more', 'original', 'can', 'just', 'overlook', 'English', 'dub', 'will', 'love', 'anime', 'sure.The', 'story', '12-year-old', 'Mitsuki', 'who', 'desperately', 'become', 'singer', 'can', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'first', 'love', 'Eichi', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'singer', 'grandmother', 'dream', 'blaming', 'Mitsuki', 'father', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'singer', 'daughter', 'death', 'problem', 'malignant', 'tumor', 'throat', 'go', 'operation', 'might', 'lose', 'voice', 'operation', 'go', 'it.That', 'when', 'met', 'two', 'death', 'spirits', 'Takuto', 'Meroko', 'Takuto', 'will', 'make', 'beautiful', '16-year-old', 'girl', 'order', 'have', 'chance', 'audition', 'won', 'then', 'decided', 'stage', 'name', 'be', 'Full', 'Moon.I', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Mitsuki', 'Takuto', 'Takuto', 'crush', 'like', 'Takuto', 'so', 'much', 'wish', 'Mitsuki', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together.I', 'liked', 'Ending', 'theme', 'New', 'Future', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'so', 'beautiful.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'can', 'also', 'read', 'manga', 'have', 'volumes', 'final', 'seventh', 'volume', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'month', 'slight', 'difference', 'manga', 'anime', 'scenes', 'liked', 'anime', 'more.Try', 'watch', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'regret', 'can', 'just', 'overlook', 'English', 'dub']","Full Moon, Vol. 1: I Want to Sing"

She promised the boy she loves that she will become a famous singer one day, and that her voice will reach him in America. One day, a couple of death spirits visit and tell her that she has a year to live. They reluctantly decide to help her achieve her dreams.

There are several very good characters, decent animation, and a good soundtrack. The story is very cute. It has lots of comedy, drama, and some romance. I am very happy that I came across this adorable series. I only have 2 complaints. 1: They only dubbed season 1. The 2nd season is hard to find, and in Japanese only. 2: The dub is very mediocre. I have heard many that are worse, but they didn't spend much on this dub. It isn't as bad as others may lead you to believe though.

973935,A2P0ZMEXYJJLZF,B000EJ9VS4,skyhack,"[1, 1]","Full Moon starts of like a million other shoujo anime titles, a sickly heroine with a dream, a dose of magic, a clear direction for the plot. It all seems so formulaic, but Full Moon breaks the mold for this type of show with its plot twists, tragedies, and triumphs.Mitsuki is a 12 year old girl who has a dream to become a well known singer, in order to convey her unspoken love to a boy she met while living in an orphanage. Mitsuki, however, has throat cancer, and refuses to get an operation for it because it will harm her vocal chords.Eichi, the object of Mitsuki's affection was adopted and taken to America, while Mitsuki went to live with her maternal grandmother, a wealthy woman with traditional tastes, and an utter dislike for music.Because Mitsuki likes music, her grandmother has her live in a guest house rather than the main house.One day, two shinigami (spirits who escort the souls of the dead to their appointed place) appear in her room, discussing Mitsuki's fate - she has one year to live, and they will be by her side until her time comes. For some reason (covered in the manga the series is based on), Mitsuki is able to see the shinigami and hear their conversation.Since Mitsuki only cares about being able to sing, and is not worried about dying, the shinigami decide to help her accomplish her dream of being a singer so she lives out her last year in hope.As a series with a focus on music, Full Moon has a very nice soundtrack, although the main songs are used very often, and can get repetitive.A recipe for something that would normally be slushy and sappy turns into something much better as the series unfolds.Full Moon has a plot that is much more intricate than what is seen on the surface, it has endearing, believable characters, and one of the finest endings you will ever see in any medium, any genre.See it.",5,"Give it time, reap the reward.",1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,1850,"['Full', 'Moon', 'starts', 'million', 'other', 'shoujo', 'anime', 'titles', 'sickly', 'heroine', 'dream', 'dose', 'magic', 'clear', 'direction', 'plot', 'so', 'formulaic', 'Full', 'Moon', 'mold', 'type', 'show', 'plot', 'twists', 'tragedies', 'triumphs.Mitsuki', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'dream', 'become', 'well', 'known', 'singer', 'order', 'convey', 'unspoken', 'love', 'boy', 'met', 'living', 'orphanage', 'Mitsuki', 'however', 'throat', 'cancer', 'get', 'operation', 'will', 'harm', 'vocal', 'chords.Eichi', 'object', 'Mitsuki', 'affection', 'was', 'adopted', 'taken', 'America', 'Mitsuki', 'went', 'live', 'maternal', 'grandmother', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'traditional', 'tastes', 'utter', 'dislike', 'music.Because', 'Mitsuki', 'music', 'grandmother', 'live', 'guest', 'house', 'rather', 'main', 'house.One', 'day', 'two', 'shinigami', 'spirits', 'who', 'escort', 'souls', 'dead', 'appointed', 'place', 'appear', 'room', 'discussing', 'Mitsuki', 'fate', 'one', 'year', 'live', 'will', 'be', 'side', 'time', 'reason', 'covered', 'manga', 'series', 'based', 'Mitsuki', 'able', 'see', 'shinigami', 'hear', 'conversation.Since', 'Mitsuki', 'only', 'being', 'able', 'sing', 'not', 'worried', 'dying', 'shinigami', 'decide', 'help', 'accomplish', 'dream', 'being', 'singer', 'out', 'last', 'year', 'hope.As', 'series', 'focus', 'music', 'Full', 'Moon', 'very', 'nice', 'soundtrack', 'main', 'songs', 'are', 'used', 'very', 'often', 'can', 'get', 'repetitive.A', 'recipe', 'something', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'slushy', 'sappy', 'turns', 'something', 'much', 'better', 'series', 'unfolds.Full', 'Moon', 'plot', 'much', 'more', 'intricate', 'what', 'seen', 'surface', 'endearing', 'believable', 'characters', 'one', 'finest', 'endings', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'medium', 'genre.See']","Full Moon, Vol. 1: I Want to Sing"
