Deirdre is very pleasant and cues really well and eventually an advanced exerciser will master this routine and feel quite accomplished, but it takes some practice. You have to know how to improvise along the way, otherwise, you will be frustrated and not get a good workout while learning it. I have done the main step combos several times, but still have a few rough spots to work through. I have not yet tried the double-step routine, but it says you can do it with just one step. The ab workout is good, but too short for me. It seemed only about 5 - 7 minutes or so and then goes immediately into the stretch.",5,It's a Blast!,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,734,"['music', 'fantastic', 'workout', 'advanced', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'endurance', 'learn', 'complex', 'choreo', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'Deirdre', 'very', 'pleasant', 'cues', 'really', 'well', 'eventually', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'will', 'master', 'routine', 'feel', 'quite', 'accomplished', 'practice', 'have', 'know', 'how', 'improvise', 'way', 'otherwise', 'will', 'be', 'frustrated', 'not', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'learning', 'have', 'done', 'main', 'step', 'combos', 'several', 'times', 'still', 'have', 'few', 'rough', 'spots', 'work', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'tried', 'double-step', 'routine', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'one', 'step', 'ab', 'workout', 'good', 'too', 'short', 'seemed', 'only', 'about', '5', '7', 'minutes', 'so', 'then', 'immediately', 'stretch']",N/A

Trust me; it's complex (yet part of the fun is getting the moves right) and definately absolutely for advanced exercisers.  I am not unfit - yet I had to take two breaks during this workout which is a sign that I'm doing a workout that's out of my comfort zone.  It doesn't let up from start to finish and while you're doing tough choreography to begin with, like the title says, there aren't a lot of taps (which help you transition usually to the next move).  At one point, you can even put two steps together (although you don't have to).  If you use two steps, you better have the space to do it in.I don't want to put people off buying this.  It's definately what you want in a workout because it really pushes you and gives you something to work towards.  I found Deirdre to be a good instructor who motivates and encourages throughout.  I also loved the music and that pushes you along too.  Don't try this if you are a beginner - you won't like it.  You have to be fairly fit and co-ordinated to find this enjoyable.  Either way, hang in there - I've done this two times already and haven't mastered it yet, but I'm enjoying challenging myself and progressing a little more each time.  It's really good.",5,You better be fit BEFORE you try this :-),1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,1338,"['are', 'looking', 'fun', 'way', 'burn', 'fat', 'challenge', 'are', 'already', 'fit', 'then', 'workout', 'Trust', 'complex', 'part', 'fun', 'getting', 'moves', 'right', 'definately', 'absolutely', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'am', 'not', 'unfit', 'yet', 'had', 'take', 'two', 'breaks', 'workout', 'sign', ""'m"", 'doing', 'workout', 'comfort', 'zone', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'start', 'finish', ""'re"", 'doing', 'tough', 'choreography', 'begin', 'title', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'taps', 'help', 'transition', 'usually', 'next', 'move', 'one', 'point', 'can', 'even', 'put', 'two', 'steps', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'use', 'two', 'steps', 'better', 'have', 'space', 'do', 'in.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'put', 'people', 'off', 'buying', 'definately', 'what', 'want', 'workout', 'really', 'something', 'work', 'towards', 'found', 'Deirdre', 'be', 'good', 'instructor', 'who', 'also', 'loved', 'music', 'pushes', 'along', 'too', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'are', 'beginner', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'have', 'be', 'fairly', 'fit', 'co-ordinated', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'hang', ""'ve"", 'done', 'two', 'times', 'already', 'have', ""n't"", 'mastered', 'yet', ""'m"", 'enjoying', 'challenging', 'progressing', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'really', 'good']",N/A

Deirdre Morris is very likeable and an excellent instructor.  She moves along quickly so you can't get bored.  The choreography is advanced so if you are new to stepping, this is definitely not the one to buy.  Initially, I had a bit of trouble trouble learning all the choreography but learning the moves is half the fun and the fun level was way up there. She offers 3 premixes which I was delighted with. One does the first half of the workout with the warm up and cool down and abs- the 2nd premix does just the 2nd half of the workout with the warm up cool down and abs. The 3rd premix is a must for step workouts in my opinion.  It is the finished product - all combinations in their entirety all put together run through multiple times. No breakdown - for advanced exercisers and step enthusiasts this is essential.  I don't want to do the breakdown of each combo after I have already learned it over and over.  Believe me, this is boring.  Once you know how - you just want to run through it.  The last premix also includes the warmup, the abs and cooldown.

Though the music is OUTSTANDING; the constant spins on the step made it virtually impossible to learn how to do the moves for a beginning stepper.  They tell the basic steppers to follow Janie but Janie is often doing the same moves as the instructor.  It was very frustrating following Janie who seemed to forget that she was supposed to be doing the moves in a more basic form.I recommend this DVD for people who are used to doing a LOT OF SPINS on the step and, therefore, are used to not watching the instructor every minute of the workout.",3,My step instructor at the gym is very advanced but this DVD is worse!,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,609,"['got', 'DVD', 'hoping', 'could', 'practice', 'step', 'moves', 'home', 'music', 'OUTSTANDING', 'constant', 'spins', 'step', 'made', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'learn', 'how', 'do', 'moves', 'beginning', 'stepper', 'tell', 'basic', 'steppers', 'follow', 'Janie', 'Janie', 'often', 'doing', 'same', 'moves', 'instructor', 'was', 'very', 'frustrating', 'following', 'Janie', 'who', 'seemed', 'forget', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'moves', 'more', 'basic', 'form.I', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'doing', 'LOT', 'OF', 'SPINS', 'step', 'therefore', 'are', 'used', 'not', 'watching', 'instructor', 'minute', 'workout']",N/A

I had to replay portions (which I don't mind doing) to get some of the steps.  I consider myself an intermediate to advanced stepper.  Towards the end, I just did my own moves to keep my heartrate up and watched the DVD so I would be ready for the next time.  I appreciate the fact that this is interestting enough to want to continue learning.The cool down is sufficient and the stretch is a little short for me, but I usually complete a yoga stretch on my own after working out, so it didn't bother me.I will keep this DVD in my rotation.",4,Great workout.,1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,898,"['like', 'step', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'familiar', 'instructor', 'style', 'do', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'out.It', 'vigorous', 'warm-up', 'step', 'then', 'single', 'step', '45', 'minute', 'routine', 'short', '5', 'minute', 'double-step', 'two', 'steps', 'side-by-side', '45', 'minute', 'portion', 'truly', 'advanced', 'workout', 'had', 'replay', 'portions', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'doing', 'get', 'steps', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'stepper', 'end', 'just', 'did', 'own', 'moves', 'keep', 'heartrate', 'up', 'watched', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'ready', 'next', 'time', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'interestting', 'enough', 'want', 'continue', 'learning.The', 'cool', 'down', 'sufficient', 'stretch', 'little', 'short', 'usually', 'complete', 'yoga', 'stretch', 'own', 'working', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'me.I', 'will', 'keep', 'DVD', 'rotation']",N/A
