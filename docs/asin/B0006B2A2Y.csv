864827,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B0006B2A2Y,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 1]","Sorry, but Balto III is the weakest link in the trilogy. But that certainly doesn't make it a bad film by any stretch. This is still perfectly good family fun and if you're not uptight about sequels, then you'll enjoy it.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Nome, Alaska's dog sled team has a problem on their hands. An airplane pilot arrives into town and claims he can deliver the mail faster the sled team, which leads to a competition between the two groups. The sled team of course recruits Balto to help them, and the dog sled team wins the challenge. However, they won because of a snowstorm, and the pilot has gone missing. After a few days, the townspeople begin to get worried, so Balto along with the help of his son Kody (Where did this son come from? All of Balto's kids in the second film were girls. Hmmm....PLOT HOLE!) and the other members of the dog sled team must find the pilot along with Balto's missing uncle Boris who is a goose.MUSIC: The score fits the mood, but sadly just about everything lacks the panache of the first two films. This score like most of the things in this film could have been better.ACTING: This is one area this film retains that its predecessors had; great acting. Once again the voice-acting for the characters has been changed, and once again, fitting replacements have been found and they fit their roles well.ACTION: This film isn't as interesting or thrilling as the other two films, and it can be a bit boring at times. However this film brought the humor the second film lacked, which is a definite plus. However, once this film picks up steam it is pretty entertaining and rarely boring. While these action moments won't thrill you as much, they still get the job done.OVERALL: Though not as good as the other two, it is still a great sequel that gets the job done. While I can't hide my mild disappointment, this film still provides the spirit of the Balto series and it is still a very entertaining film that rocks. One thing I must say however, please Universal Pictures, don't make anymore films because we don't need what you did with The Land Before Time (Twelve sequels is ridiculous, and all but the decent second film sucked and paled considerably in comparison to the original).THE GOOD: Great voice-acting, good music, good action moments, and a fun sense of humor.THE BAD: The problem is that it just lacks the panache of the other two films.",4,"THE LEAST OF THE TRILOGY, BUT STILL HIGHLY ENJOYABLE  8 OUT OF 10",1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,2390,"['Sorry', 'Balto', 'III', 'weakest', 'link', 'trilogy', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'film', 'stretch', 'still', 'perfectly', 'good', 'family', 'fun', ""'re"", 'not', 'uptight', 'sequels', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'it.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Nome', 'Alaska', 'dog', 'sled', 'team', 'problem', 'hands', 'airplane', 'pilot', 'town', 'claims', 'can', 'deliver', 'mail', 'faster', 'sled', 'team', 'competition', 'two', 'groups', 'sled', 'team', 'course', 'recruits', 'Balto', 'help', 'dog', 'sled', 'team', 'challenge', 'However', 'won', 'because', 'snowstorm', 'pilot', 'gone', 'missing', 'few', 'days', 'townspeople', 'begin', 'get', 'worried', 'so', 'Balto', 'help', 'son', 'Kody', 'Where', 'did', 'son', 'come', 'Balto', 'kids', 'second', 'film', 'were', 'girls', 'Hmmm', '.PLOT', 'HOLE', 'other', 'members', 'dog', 'sled', 'team', 'must', 'find', 'pilot', 'Balto', 'missing', 'uncle', 'Boris', 'who', 'goose.MUSIC', 'score', 'mood', 'sadly', 'just', 'everything', 'panache', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'score', 'most', 'things', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.ACTING', 'one', 'area', 'film', 'predecessors', 'had', 'great', 'acting', 'Once', 'again', 'voice-acting', 'characters', 'been', 'changed', 'once', 'again', 'fitting', 'replacements', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'fit', 'roles', 'well.ACTION', 'film', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'thrilling', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'boring', 'times', 'However', 'film', 'brought', 'humor', 'second', 'film', 'lacked', 'definite', 'plus', 'However', 'once', 'film', 'up', 'steam', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'rarely', 'boring', 'action', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'thrill', 'much', 'still', 'get', 'job', 'done.OVERALL', 'Though', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'two', 'still', 'great', 'sequel', 'job', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'mild', 'disappointment', 'film', 'still', 'spirit', 'Balto', 'series', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'rocks', 'One', 'thing', 'must', 'say', 'however', 'please', 'Universal', 'Pictures', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'what', 'did', 'Land', 'Time', 'Twelve', 'sequels', 'ridiculous', 'decent', 'second', 'film', 'sucked', 'paled', 'considerably', 'comparison', 'original', '.THE', 'GOOD', 'Great', 'voice-acting', 'good', 'music', 'good', 'action', 'moments', 'fun', 'sense', 'humor.THE', 'BAD', 'problem', 'just', 'panache', 'other', 'two', 'films']",N/A

I like many loved the wolf aspect of the others and was surprised that it is absolutely forgotten in the third movie, I mean it was a constant theme in BOTH the others. Like I saw on a few other reviews I too was hoping that there would be some news of Alue, but I knew there wouldn't be, after all that story was done and they were on another now, disappointing but nothing to count off for. For this movie they went back to the sled dog side of the firs story with was well and good, they got their wolf business done in the second movie, but did Balto suddenly become full husky or what because they never show/mention/even hint at anything wolf related.The characters seem pretty goofy to me and I find Stella to just be annoying for the most part, and when did Boris get a phobia of flying? I know he never flew much but he DID fly at least a limited amount in the first one, mildly irritating, but I guess I've seen worse changes in movies. I honestly was interested in Kodiak just because he is another of Balto's pups (and one of Alue's siblings) and as far as his attitude, meh, well there are those like him and he did become nicer as the movie went on. There were two moose later in the movie that I found incredibly irritating, reminding me of any number of other irritating characters from other cartoons and once again just being goofy.Over all I didn't mind watching once and own it just to finish the trilogy, but it certainly isn't for me or any other Balto fan that liked the movies for the wolf aspect of them.

Not only because I recognize their vocal traits but because of the contrast in their characters. Astin is Kodiak, one of Jenna and Balto's Husky-like pups and the younger Carradine is a Human called Duke who proves progress is inevitably arriving via the introduction of his airplane. Now, in largely animal films I don't tend to like human characters so I assumed wrongly that Carradine would be a bad guy here. Far from it. Duke is very kind. Kodiak sees Duke as a threat due to possibly causing the dog teams to lose their status and function in their home town. When Duke is hurt, Kodiak initially refuses to offer assistance due to being mad...again this is relatable...it sometimes takes time to see the big picture of a scenario fully.

I thought Wings of Change was not quite as good as the first one, but it was better than the second one. Sequels tend to not be made very well, and while it's not a perfect movie, it was a very good movie, and I thought it was very well made. I would have given this movie 4.5 stars if I could, but since I couldn't I gave it 5 stars.Story:I was pleasantly surprised to see that Wings of Change was quite entertaining. It was humorous at times, and it had nice story. The story itself does deviate from the wolf themes of the previous two movies, but I didn't mind that too much because the story was still quite good.Characters:I felt that it stayed true to the characters themselves. Balto felt like Balto. He was adventurous, and even when he doubts himself, he perseveres and does his best (just like the original movie). So, I was very happy with how he was portrayed. The new characters were funny and interesting. I was also surprised at how well they were portrayed. Balto's son was a likable character with flaws that made him interesting to watch and see him grow.Animation:The animation was quite good. The scenes and characters looked nice, and they moved very well. My only complaint is that the obvious use of 3D effects sticks out like a sore thumb at times, but it's not too bad, and it looks pretty decent. I know that the money it saved during production probably helped the movie get made, so I'm not going to complain too much about that.Music/Soundtrack:The music was very nice, and I even didn't mind the singing moments (even though the original Balto never had singing) because I thought they were done pretty well, and they were quite touching at times. There was only one part of the soundtrack that sounded out of place when a goofy hi-jinks type theme was played during a dire falling into a river scene. I kept half expecting something funny to happen because the music implied it, but it didn't. Instead it was actually a rather serious, tense moment, which just left me a little confused as to why they chose that music for that scene. Quite an odd choice. Other than that, the music was great.Overall:This movie is a family friendly movie that I think both the adults and kids would enjoy. It does a good job of teaching some valuable  lessons that ought to be quite beneficial for the kids, but it's not overly emphasized so it won't rub adults the wrong way. In fact, I found it to be quite charming, and besides, they are probably lessons that many adults could learn from also. This is quite a fun movie that didn't get much attention as a direct to video sequel, but it's well worth the purchase if you enjoy animated films (especially if you liked Balto).

Not only because I'm a Balto fan, but because it's a really good animated movie, especially for a DTV (and we all know that the DTV sequels are usually all but good!).In fact, it gives a slightly different feeling compared to the original or Wolf Quest. I don't know exactly why, but this is the first time I felt that with an animated sequel...And it's really a nice thing ;) The story is one of the best points : there are a lot of things happening, perhaps even more than in the first, and everything goes quickly. There are no boring passages, although some will probably not please everyone. No magic here, the humans are back for good, all the key points of the scenario give a feeling of reality; so it is much closer to the original on that side. The characters aren't still very well drawn; in fact, it depends, sometimes they are perfectly drawn, nearly as in the first one, and sometimes much less. I would say it is common for a DTV on that side. However, the backgrounds are AWESOME. The colors are more than beautiful, and the less beautiful backgrounds are on pair with the most beautiful in the original. It's another thing that is really impressive for a DTV sequel, seeing that IMO they are as beautiful as some big animated movies like ""Brother Bear"" or ""Spirit"", and perhaps even more! As for the musics : I would say the same thing. While there are still some empty passages, the soundtrack is really, really awesome, impressive, especially near the end. It may not have the shrewd style of Horner's Balto 1 soundtrack, yet the score from Adam Berry is exceptional, and make some passages unforgettable. To give a better idea of what I overall think of the film, I would summarize that into one word : beautiful. Really, really beautiful. Beautiful scenario, beautiful musics, beautiful graphics... Some of you might be wondering if they will rent it or buy it directly. Well, I believe that this film has more than enough replay value, when Wolf Quest had nearly none; so IMO, it is definitely a must-buy for every Balto fan, and even for everyone else ;)To summarize : A wonderful film. Definitely a must-see for Balto fans, and one of the best DTV sequels ever made to an animated movie (maybe the best with TLK 1/2). It may have some flaws, but there are so many qualities in the scenario, graphics, musics...that everyone will let through these minor problems, and enjoy the great story it offers. If you liked Wolf Quest, you have all chances to love it. If you didn't, but still liked the original Balto, believe me : it's somewhat different from WQ, so you don't have any reason to not watch it just because WQ was a disappointment. Unlike Wolf Quest, I really can't see anyone who wouldn't like it.",5,Wonderful!
