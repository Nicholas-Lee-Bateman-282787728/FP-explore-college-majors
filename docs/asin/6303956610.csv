This movie gives an elementary introduction to the fugitive slave law of 1850, the Underground Railroad, and the slave catchers hired to return fugitives.  There are some serious problems: mainly the audio is terrible. Considering how bad it is I am stretcheing ti to give three stars to this video.  This problem has been discussed by previous reviewers, and if I had read them before buying it I might have not spent the money.  Eith my fvolume turned as high as possible I still missed half the dialogue.If you can get this for a couple of dollars it is worth the price.  The story is fair, the quality of the disk is terrible.",3,An introduction to the antislavery movement,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,695,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'class', 'study', 'agree', 'movie', 'elementary', 'introduction', 'fugitive', 'slave', 'law', '1850', 'Underground', 'Railroad', 'slave', 'catchers', 'hired', 'return', 'fugitives', 'are', 'serious', 'problems', 'mainly', 'audio', 'terrible', 'Considering', 'how', 'bad', 'am', 'stretcheing', 'ti', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'video', 'problem', 'been', 'discussed', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'had', 'read', 'buying', 'might', 'have', 'not', 'spent', 'money', 'Eith', 'fvolume', 'turned', 'as', 'high', 'possible', 'still', 'missed', 'dialogue.If', 'can', 'get', 'couple', 'dollars', 'price', 'story', 'fair', 'quality', 'disk', 'terrible']",N/A

391904,A39EWZC263SF0W,6303956610,Lim C. Yin,"[6, 9]",The movie has a good story line on the sufferings on some of the unfortunate early settlers in the United States.  It has a good moral on the sympathetic and humane action by some fellow humans that are more fortunate in helping those that are not.

I liked how the female character had gained favor with her master only to turn around and break camp with her handsome field hand. Both she and the field hand wanted to get married.Then came the suspense! Oh boy! Once the massah found out his little peach pie of a black girl had jumped ship, he sent the hound dogs after them.The ending, while not expected, was quite refreshing and uplifting. I gave it four stars instead of five because it could have been a little longer.

This is a very good educational documentary that details the path and roots that slaves took to reach freedom as well as the role the white abolitionists' played in helping.This is all new film footage for me and I now understand who the black woman everyone called Moses. There is a lot of good stuff in this DVD and I fully recommend you purchase it.

It's a very sad but true depiction of the underground railroad and I highly recommend it for any teacher who wants to show and not just tell the story of slavery in America and the people who stood up against it. This gripping story follows 4 runaway slaves on their journey north to freedom and shows the obstacles they met along the way and who survived the journey despite being followed.
