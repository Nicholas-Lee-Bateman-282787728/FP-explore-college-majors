339217,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,6302820715,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[14, 15]","This movie succeeds in being hugely entertaining thanks to Holly Hunter's amazing performance in the title role. She is thoroughly convincing as the trashy, pushy mom who's dedication to the success of her daughter's future  as a cheerleader eventually leads to attempted murder. The realism is  heightened by the use of restaged media footage, and &quot;interviews&quot;  with Hunter (in character), who's cracked logic and twitchy mannerisms will  have you in stitches. All the performances are good, and the result is a  very black comedy that effectively ridicules this misguided woman's bizarre  and near-deadly obsession with success and one-upmanship.

I do remember when the news hit the nation, and it was a shocking one back then. Now, it's no longer so anymore. Holly Hunter, as always a wonderful actress, plays her role very well, and I like Beau Bridges' performance. However, the campy aspect of the film is too much for me to take, ruining the overall effect. All in all, The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom could have been better if the story was taken more seriously.",3,"Holly and Beau, That's All.",1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,636,"['Viewed', '11/13Rate', '510/13', 'Positively', 'True', 'Adventures', 'Alleged', 'Texas', 'Cheerleader-Murdering', 'Mom', 'such', 'long', 'title', 'give', 'movie', 'points', 'off', 'do', 'remember', 'when', 'news', 'hit', 'nation', 'was', 'shocking', 'one', 'back', 'then', 'Now', 'no', 'longer', 'so', 'anymore', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'always', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'like', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'performance', 'However', 'campy', 'aspect', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'ruining', 'overall', 'effect', 'Positively', 'True', 'Adventures', 'Alleged', 'Texas', 'Cheerleader-Murdering', 'Mom', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'story', 'was', 'taken', 'more', 'seriously']",N/A

I bought this dvd in a supermarket for less than I've ever paid before, expecting nothing much, purely on the basis of the peculiar title and the name of Holly Hunter. It's an absolute masterpiece: story, direction, acting, the lot! Made 13 years ago, and I'd never heard of it. One of the mothers talks about skill, not promotion, and that must be it. Tons of skill, no promotion. It is simply too good to be plugged, and its reputation can only get steadily better: see the other reviews --- a chorus of agreement. Holly is amazing, and everyone else is just perfect. Every scene is a delight: weirdly true and truly weird. This goes straight into the small group of films that I regard as the best ever.Later. Well, I just have to add something to try to work out just what makes this movie so perfect. Basically, it must be down to the writing, which is superb. The dialogue never puts a foot wrong. These characters are fully rounded, totally developed, highly comic, yet incredibly real. Everything in the relationships is understated, subtle, accurately observed, and convincing. You feel you know exactly what these people are like, and can visualize precisely how this bizarre situation arose. Holly's performance is out of this world. The scene in the car with Beau Bridges is one of the two or three funniest I have ever seen. You know that Wanda doesn't really believe what she is saying, yet at the same time she really does want Verna gone. Verna's reactions are just as brilliant, and the slide into celebrity status of all the participants, including the school kids, is so accurate it hurts. The family atmosphere in the Holloway household is spot on; and the boy's performance is particularly good.

It's a cynical docu-drama (mockumentry?) about a real-life woman in Texas who plotted to kill another mom whose daughter was in junior high school cheerleading competition with her daughter.  The idea was to mess up the girl enough that her kid would win the competition to get on the squad.Holly Hunter is outstanding as the ""competitively-challenged"" mother, ""Wanda Holloway."" Also, I liked Beau Bridges in his low-key in his role of ""Terry Harper"" and thought he was just as entertaining as Hunter.Hunter, with her real Texas twang that we have to endure in her other films, is perfect for this role. Her accent is so strong in here it's hard to understand a third of what she says, but her acting and the fascinating story make this fun to watch.I was amazed to find out this was a made-for-TV film.
