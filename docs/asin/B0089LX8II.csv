It moves fast, sometimes too fast--the pacing could use some work--and too much of the conflict is bluntly explained away in the script. ERASED also relies too much on shoot-'em-ups and punch-'em-outs, and the super-tough former agent who's done some terrible things but is a good guy at heart, blahly and routinely played by Eckhart, manages to beat some pretty unbelievable odds.

This is a very watchable film but, at the end of the day, it doesn't rise above he fray.Here's the scoop. Ben Logan (Aaron Eckhart) is ex-CIA now working with a a security firm in Brussels to troubleshoot their products. He comes up with an odd finding regarding patents. Now he finds the office he reported to is gone as though it never existed. No recent record of him exists and soon he finds himself on the run with his daughter and fighting for his life.The beginning of this movie is actually very good. You get to see Eckhart as an adviser, his testing of products and the results he gives to his superiors give the viewer an insider's view of what the high stakes security industry involves. When he starts asking questions though you know something's afoot. Then, when his co-workers begin showing up dead, and he hightails it with his daughter, it devolves into a rather typical cat and mouse outing. The Belgium settings give it that 'international intrigue' bit of flavor and help show off Eckhart's ability to move and make things happen. This is shot well, acted well enough (Eckhart isn't digging deep here) and generally well executed all the way around. The story moves at an even clip and much of it makes sense (save for the cheesy, terrible ending) but it has some tough acts to follow. You don't put Lucifer's Friend on stage after Led Zeppelin.This is a steady, entertaining watch. But after it's ended you won't be rushing in for a second viewing.",3,Been There.

Shot in Antwerp and Brussels the cities are extraordinarily beautiful, written by Arash Amel and directed by Philipp St&ouml;lzl - both of whom are young and new to the business and it shows.Ben Logan (Aaron Eckhart in a solid performance) is an ex-CIA agent employed by a huge conglomerate Halgate and working for one of their subsidiary companies as a security engineer. He has invited his daughter Amy (Liana Liberato) to move from the US to Belgium to live with him to reconnect after a lengthy separation. Ben's job is to try to get pass security protocols, fool the eye scanners and break into safes. But overnight Ben discovers that his company, Halgate, no longer inhabits his workplace and that all evidence of Ben's existence has been erased. Slowly he discovers that there is a huge conspiracy surrounding his employer and that soon he and his daughter will become subjects of a manhunt. Ben's co-workers are all murdered with the exception of his colleague Derek Kolper (Neil Napier) who apparently has possession of documents that will bring the conspiracy into the open. Ben relies on his US operative colleague Anna Brandt (the beautiful Ukrainian actress Olga Kurylenko) who is not who she seems. Amy grows from being a dysfunctional disgruntled teenager to a keen `agent' with some help from her boyfriend Nabil (the very bright handsome new rising star Yassine Fadel). Targeted for termination by a company with seemingly unlimited recourses, they only have one choice: get to the bottom of this conspiracy in a hope that it will save their lives.Though there are holes in this story and many borrowed concepts from other films in this genre, the film provides visual if not intellectual excitement. The cast is solid and there is always the magnificent beauty of Belgium to fill in the gaps.

One day, Ben is presenting flaws in a billion-dollar security system that he plans to work out with his colleagues, but the next day when he returns to work, the office is stripped and abandoned; his entire life for six months is completely erased. Now, on the run with his daughter, Ben works to find out why he's been erased, and along the way, reveals dark secrets about his past.Erased is a thriller that is far from original, but is happily a semi-fresh take on the reworked plot-line. The direction of Philipp Stolzl is actually very well-done, having a some-what calm feeling in this very urgent crisis instead of a constant feeling of impending doom and danger. Sure, the action and intensity are there, but even some action-thrillers make the calm moments feel intensified, as if time is running out by the millisecond. Aaron Eckhart is great, as he is with most of his movies. Here, his character felt like a cross between Jason Statham's Luke Wright (from 2012's Safe) and Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills (Taken); this is a good thing, by the way. Olga Kurylenko was very good as Anna, an old flame and CIA operative who had worked with Ben before, but is now on the other side. Liana Liberato was good as Ben's daughter Amy, but nothing truly gripping or captivating. Sure, we felt for her, but it wasn't tears. If it were Dakota Fanning here instead, then we might have just created the new Niagara Falls (I'm not saying Liana is a bad actress, but she could have done a wee bit better). The script was good, nothing award-winning or really new, but the climax of the movie was just stunning. The way it was shot, the slow-burning build-up, it was just fantastic.Erased is not an original thriller, but it is a damn good one to add to your movie collection if you like action-thrillers, political-espionage thrillers or a good chase film. Eckhart is in top-form here, and gets to show off some really awesome fighting skills.

Well, that was my experience with Erased (aka The Expatriate outside the U.S.) Taking obvious influences from many action-thrillers that preceded it, Erased, like Ben Logan (Aaron Eckhart), suffers from a lack of identity. While interesting at times, the story being told is one we've seen many times before and, in some cases, it's been done better. With that being said, though, the film still managed to hold my attention despite its derivative nature and when it was all said and done I actually had a good time.You follow the life of Ben Logan and his daughter Amy (Liana Liberato). Ben is an ex-CIA agent and because of this he made sure that Amy wasn't a huge part of his life while she was growing up. I guess in his eyes having no father was better than having a father who worked 24/7. Anyway, the two of them wind up on the run after Ben goes to work one day only to find that the company had vanished. As a confused Ben tries to put the pieces together, a government conspiracy unravels which forces these two to literally fight for their life.Truth be told, I knew very little about this film going in. I had seen a trailer beforehand, but beyond that I went in pretty blind. For me, the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how much promise it had. You see, it is possible to make great films regardless of whether or not they draw from previous works, but you need to add something different tot he mix. Well, in Erased's starting moments I was convinced that I was going to receive just that. While the broken father/daughter relationship is a bit overdone, Eckhart and Liberato had some great chemistry and it seemed as if the film was setting itself up for something amazing. It didn't take long for things to fall apart, though.One or two cliches here and there are ok, but within the first 30 minutes I was slapped with every action-thriller cliche in the book. Unfortunately, I can't even say that it stopped there. Not only is his relationship with his daughter rocky, he's a CIA agent. Not only is he late to his daughter's award ceremony, the man at his work is secretly working for the people trying to set him up. Not only did he split up with the mother of his child, she never told Amy why or what he did. The cliches kept coming and it reached a point where it became too much. Still, as much as I seemingly disliked this movie so far, I continued on. Why? Well, I don't have an answer for that. It's probably because I try to give every movie the benefit of the doubt and this is probably a character flaw of mine.Anyway, as cliched as the scenes were, the bits with Ben and Amy were actually the most enjoyable sequences in the film. It wasn't until the writer's attempted to get technical with the outside workings of the organization that I really wanted to pull my hair out. Now I'm a fairly intelligent guy, but nothing seemed to make any sense. All the hard details about his previous job never felt important or authentic. It was almost as if they were thrown in at the last minute. It's like the writers realized that a backstory is important, but they didn't think about it until they were already in the process of filming. The only thing these scenes really accomplished was destroying the crippled flow that was built up by the previous scenes with Ben and Amy.Now up to this point I've kind of torn this movie to shreds, but it's not all bad. In fact, it's not bad at all. It's just very underwhelming. With that said, though, Erased did manage to create some pretty intense action sequences and the acting was solid as well. While the action scenes may not have been extremely innovative, they always kept me on my toes. The fighting didn't feel stiff and the scenes never felt like they were dragged on for too long. They were in, they were out, and they were moving on. Also, Eckhart and Liberato performed really well in the scenes they were in together. While most of the supporting cast never felt important, these two really did a good job of bringing these characters to life.Finally, the score, composed by Jeff Danna, was... inconsistent, at best. Like majority of the elements present in the movie, the score borrows from things we've heard from in the past. Majority of the time I didn't even notice it was there because none of the compositions really stood out to me, but there were a few notable exceptions. For example, the piece heard in the final scene leading into the credits was really well done, but other than that most of it was just background noise.Overall Score: 6/10 - Personally, had they focused more on Ben and Amy and less on the CIA then this score would probably be higher. With the chemistry they had on screen there was a lot of potential to do something amazing, but in the end they just settled for something average. The story isn't anything to write home about and there's a ton of cliches, but the acting was solid and the fight scenes were entertaining. Part of me wishes there was something substantial for me to really love this movie, but alas this is what we were given.",3,6/10 - One big cliche,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,5204,"['Note', 'May',

Yes, it is a formula product, but surprisingly even productions that rip from the blueprint often screw up. Having been able to, at the very least, overcome the astounding amount of inane and worthless flicks that populate the cinematic landscape nowadays is in itself a success. This tracked true to the recipe, so I would categorize it as very solid.Preface caveat: Aaron Eckart is one of those performers that I seemingly cannot connect with on any level. He has all the hallmarks of a quality actor - projection, presence, and personality. Yet for all those talents - I can't seem to find common ground. And I honestly can't explain why.That said, I found his performance in this production surprisingly engaging and quite entertaining. Hopefully it's a trend.In 'Expatriate' he plays Ben Logan, tech security specialist. Hired by a global security company for his expertise - breaking into previously thought of unhackable systems - exposing vulnerabilities, weaknesses and flaws in their product lines.To showcase his level of commitment to the company, Ben chooses to stay overseas in order to work at the Belgian offices of the corporation. Along with him is his young daughter Amy, although she isn't nearly as pleased with her new status as an expatriate. But the death of her mother back in the states left no other choice. Having had little contact with her father since birth, the incongruent pair are just now learning to adjust to one another; her dad's comfortable paycheck acting as a stable platform for their fresh start, making the transition bearable.Until the day that his company literally disappears.Everyone he knew is gone. The office he has been going to daily for the past six months is stripped bare, his fellow employees vanished. Everything a modern person uses to define a life no longer exists for Logan - no bank account, no money, no digital records, no identification, nothing. Not even his cell phone, which is company property, works anymore. His existence has been erased.Just what's going on?As father and daughter are caught up in a bizarre and terrifying world of espionage and twisted corporate shadows, they're forced on the run. With little or no break, they have to stay one step in front of professional assassins and various spy agencies looking to put them into a set of anonymous graves.There were some weaknesses in the film that have to be acknowledged.Young co-star Liana Liberato's character as Amy was often artificially too self-aware. For someone who projected typical adolescent immaturity at the beginning of the film, to then flip a switch and become a strong and emotionally composed character - i.e. The driving sequence/interrogation - was ridiculous. And certain aspects of the script rang false; particularly when the intelligence officers gather to discuss the true situation of Ben Logan.Still, those minor criticisms were mostly forgivable when balanced out with the enjoyable heart-thumping pace of the movie.Overall, you'll enjoy this if you can imagine Jason Bourne with a kid.",4,Very Solid High Octane Thriller,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,3222,"['expatriate', 'Residing', 'different', 'country', 'maintaining', 'citizenship', 'native', 'homeland.An', 'enjoyable', 'high', 'octane', 'action', 'flick', 'utilizing', 'cookie-cutter', 'screenplay', 'Yes', 'formula', 'product', 'surprisingly', 'even', 'productions', 'rip', 'blueprint', 'often', 'screw', 'up', 'Having', 'been', 'able', 'very', 'least', 'overcome', 'astounding', 'amount', 'inane', 'worthless', 'flicks', 'populate', 'cinematic', 'landscape', 'nowadays', 'success', 'tracked', 'true', 'recipe', 'would', 'categorize', 'very', 'solid.Preface', 'caveat', 'Aaron', 'Eckart', 'one', 'performers', 'seemingly', 'can', 'not', 'connect', 'level', 'hallmarks', 'quality', 'actor', 'projection', 'presence', 'personality', 'talents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why.That', 'said', 'found', 'performance', 'production', 'surprisingly', 'engaging', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'Hopefully', 'trend.In', ""'Expatriate"", 'Ben', 'Logan', 'tech', 'security', 'specialist', 'Hired', 'global', 'security', 'company', 'expertise', 'breaking', 'previously', 'thought', 'unhackable', 'systems', 'exposing', 'vulnerabilities', 'weaknesses', 'flaws', 'product', 'lines.To', 'showcase', 'level', 'commitment', 'company', 'Ben', 'stay', 'overseas', 'order', 'work', 'Belgian', 'offices', 'corporation', 'young', 'daughter', 'Amy', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'pleased', 'new', 'status', 'expatriate', 'death', 'mother', 'back', 'states', 'left', 'other', 'choice', 'Having', 'had', 'little', 'contact', 'father', 'birth', 'incongruent', 'pair', 'are', 'just', 'now', 'learning', 'adjust', 'one', 'dad', 'comfortable', 'paycheck', 'acting', 'stable', 'platform', 'fresh', 'start', 'making', 'transition', 'bearable.Until', 'day', 'company', 'literally', 'disappears.Everyone', 'knew', 'gone', 'office', 'been', 'going', 'daily', 'past', 'six', 'months', 'stripped', 'bare', 'fellow', 'employees', 'vanished', 'Everything', 'modern', 'person', 'define', 'life', 'no', 'longer', 'Logan', 'bank', 'account', 'money', 'digital', 'records', 'identification', 'nothing', 'Not', 'even', 'cell', 'phone', 'company', 'property', 'anymore', 'existence', 'been', 'erased.Just', 'what', 'going', 'father', 'daughter', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'bizarre', 'terrifying', 'world', 'espionage', 'twisted', 'corporate', 'shadows', ""'re"", 'forced', 'run', 'little', 'break', 'have', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'front', 'professional', 'assassins', 'various', 'spy', 'agencies', 'looking', 'put', 'set', 'anonymous', 'graves.There', 'were', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'acknowledged.Young', 'co-star', 'Liana', 'Liberato', 'character', 'Amy', 'was', 'often', 'artificially', 'too', 'self-aware', 'someone', 'who', 'projected', 'typical', 'adolescent', 'immaturity', 'beginning', 'film', 'then', 'flip', 'switch', 'become', 'strong', 'emotionally', 'composed', 'character', 'i.e', 'driving', 'sequence/interrogation', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'certain', 'aspects', 'script', 'rang', 'false', 'particularly', 'when', 'intelligence', 'officers', 'gather', 'discuss', 'true', 'situation', 'Ben', 'Logan.Still', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'were', 'mostly', 'forgivable', 'when', 'balanced', 'out', 'enjoyable', 'heart-thumping', 'pace', 'movie.Overall', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'can', 'imagine', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'kid']",The Expatriate

I think he's got more leading man status than it seems like most movie producers are willing to give him credit for, because if he's not playing second fiddle in big-budget fare, then he's playing front-runner on derivative B-grade shlock like this.Shlock is harsh, I'll admit. The film isn't bad, per se. It's just doesn't try to transcend beyond any of the usual spy/thriller cliches that dominate the genre. Eckhart plays Logan, an ex-CIA operative who works for a security company by searching for flaws in their various safety/lock-em-up devices. One day, after a rough night with his daughter, Amy, Logan returns to his company to find that not only is it gone, but so is every single piece of evidence proving that he's worked for them. Wha happa?!Turns out the company wasn't what it seemed to be, and so begins the movie's long spiral into predictability. What could've been a taut action-paced thriller is crippled by a needlessly convoluted plot. Those extraneous twists and turns are there, I suspect, to detract from the fact that the screenwriter couldn't really come up with any inventive or clever ways for Logan to show off his CIA skills, and so we are left with happenstance, silly levels of brutality, and tedium to make up for the gap.To distract from this there is also a paper-thin romantic subplot (involving a female CIA agent who may as well have been a mannequin for as detailed as her character was). Plus there is the traditionally annoying teenage-daughter-doesn't-get-along-with-Daddy subplot. Please, for the love of God, can Hollywood get some screenwriters who know how to create teenage characters? They don't all have to be entitled, self-important, irrational whiners, do they? Of course, Logan having to lug Amy everywhere complicates things, but not in a way that's tense or intriguing. Instead, Amy shows preternatural skill at detection and evading when it furthers the plot, and she shows an agonizing level of idiocy and pubescence when the story is in danger of going too fast.

Amy quickly goes from a snarky teen to Internet sleuth.The film consists of a lot of double agents. The twists are shown to the audience which takes away from any mystery aspect.

When he finds out that all the people he worked with are dead and he is the next target he must find a way to save him and his daughter as well as find out the truth. This is a good movie and is worth watching but isn't really as exciting as the plot sounds. The movie is very tense at times and really keeps you watching. The easiest way to describe the movie is a mix of Mission Impossible, Eraser, and The Net. The only thing that really bugged me in this was the daughter. She seemed to be bi-polar, really wanting her dad to help, then next second being mad that he did. Watch and you will see what I mean. Overall, this is very much worth seeing.

""Erased"" is little more than ""Taken"" with a bit of ""Safe House"" and other spy thrillers thrown into the mix and as derivative as they come.Eckhart plays Ben Logan a former CIA operative and killer who has ""retired"" working now as a security consultant in Antwerp. He has his daughter Amy (Liana Liberato) living with him after the death of his ex-wife. It's a somewhat uneasy existence as the two are still working out their differences and how to live together peacefully. One morning Logan goes into work to discover that his division has never existed; what's more all of his co-workers are in the morgue. Suddenly, Logan and his daughter are on the run themselves with an assassin on their trail and Ben must piece together what happened and who is behind the conspiracy to erase his existance.Eckhart makes a fine action thriller hero and is a terrific actor. I can only suspect that the timing of the project, the chance to shoot overseas and have a vacation and the price was right. Actors, after all, have to (and like to) work and I'm sure that ""Erased"" looked fine on paper. It is a decent thriller it's just not something we haven't seen a dozen times before and done better on a larger budget.The film is ably directed by Phillip Stoizi and the screenplay by Arash Amel (who just completed scripting the sequel toI Am Legend [Blu-ray]) certainly does a good job of developing the father-daughter relationship between the two main characters. Where the film falls down is in the lack of originality of its execution as well as the twist and turns of the plot.What makes ""Erased"" memorable is Eckhart's dependable performance as an actor everything else is recycled and derivative from better made films.",2,If this Aaron Eckhart thriller was erased no one would notice (review of the on-demand version),1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,1953,"['Erased', 'had', 'been', 'made', '30', 'years', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'novel', 'thriller', 'wake', 'what', 'come', 'before', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'same', 'light', 'lingering', 'impression', 'mistake', 'erased', 'piece', 'paper', 'Erased', 'little', 'more', 'Taken', 'bit', 'Safe', 'House', 'other', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'thrown', 'mix', 'as', 'derivative', 'come.Eckhart', 'plays', 'Ben', 'Logan', 'former', 'CIA', 'operative', 'killer', 'who', 'retired', 'working', 'now', 'security', 'consultant', 'Antwerp', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'Liana', 'Liberato', 'living', 'death', 'ex-wife', 'somewhat', 'uneasy', 'existence', 'two', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'out', 'differences', 'how', 'live', 'together', 'peacefully', 'One', 'morning', 'Logan', 'work', 'discover', 'division', 'never', 'existed', 'what', 'more', 'co-workers', 'are', 'morgue', 'Suddenly', 'Logan', 'daughter', 'are', 'run', 'assassin', 'trail', 'Ben', 'must', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'who', 'conspiracy', 'erase', 'existance.Eckhart', 'fine', 'action', 'thriller', 'hero', 'terrific', 'actor', 'can', 'only', 'suspect', 'timing', 'project', 'chance', 'shoot', 'overseas', 'have', 'vacation', 'price', 'was', 'right', 'Actors', 'have', 'work', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Erased', 'looked', 'fine', 'paper', 'decent', 'thriller', 'just', 'not', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'dozen', 'times', 'before', 'done', 'better', 'larger', 'budget.The', 'film', 'ably', 'directed', 'Phillip', 'Stoizi', 'screenplay', 'Arash', 'Amel', 'who', 'just', 'completed', 'scripting', 'sequel', 'toI', 'Am', 'Legend', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'certainly', 'good', 'job', 'developing', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Where', 'film', 'down', 'lack', 'originality', 'execution', 'as', 'well', 'twist', 'turns', 'plot.What', 'Erased', 'memorable', 'Eckhart', 'dependable', 'performance', 'actor', 'everything', 'else', 'recycled', 'derivative', 'better', 'made', 'films']",The Expatriate
