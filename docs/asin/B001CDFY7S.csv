1176036,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001CDFY7S,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Gus Van Sant has a lot of loyal followers.  I haven't seen a lot of his movies, but I've seen a handful (I think about 5 or 6) and while I appreciate his keen eye and directorial visions, I don't really sink into his work like so many others.  I remember the first time I saw `Elephant'.  It was such a conflicting experience, and I feel that way about a lot of his work.  `Paranoid Park' is a lot like `Elephant' in ways, but for me (and maybe it's because, having seen `Elephant' and pondered it immensely) this film understands the awkwardness a little better and thus relays a deeper, more rapturous message.The film tells the story of a teenager named Alex who happened to visit a skate park called Paranoid Park on the night a security guard was killed.  He's interrogated by police (as are every other skater in the school) but he hides his involvement in the killing.  His guilty conscience begins to erode his persona, distancing him from those he loves and those closest to him.He's falling apart.I mention an awkwardness on the outset of this review, and what I mean by that is this naturally stiff feeling of teenage angst that runs through each frame.  The narration is poor to a profit, for the stumbled reading portrays the emotionally confused state that Alex finds himself.  The conversations all read true (even when they appear pointless, there is a point) and the plot unraveling is marvelously textured from start to finish.  Some have concluded that this film is a gay allegory, and I can totally see that.  I don't think that Alex is gay (his separation from his girlfriend is most definitely a part of his emotional confliction due to his current state) but I do feel that the undertones are there.  This film is very much about concealing something you feel will ostracize you and the pain that comes from that concealment.  Beings that Van Sant is a gay man, I can see his influence and personal story bleeding into this films moral core.Using regular kids (newbies to the business) to play the parts here was a major plus.  They seem uncomfortable in their own skin, and that isn't something you can readily display unless, well, you are uncomfortable in your own skin.For me, the anticlimactic ending is perfection.  When reviewing `Elephant' I mentioned that the film was basically designed to make you feel nothing about the killings.  You walked away void of feeling.  `Paranoid Park' is similar in that you can feel the coldness (and true testament to the moral state of society today) but there is an emotional resonance that truly connects the audience to Alex here.  Alex is not void of feeling.  His breakdowns are strong and passionate.  He feels the consequences of his actions so profoundly that the final frames, that fire, burn brightly as a loud statement, reigning in our personal feelings and delivering a severe blow to our consciences.  We are brought into his world and brought to his level and then suddenly we are left contemplating whether what Alex concludes is what we would have concluded.It's stunning.",5,Write it to me...,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,3056,"['Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'lot', 'loyal', 'followers', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'handful', 'think', '5', '6', 'appreciate', 'keen', 'eye', 'directorial', 'visions', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'sink', 'work', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Elephant', 'was', 'such', 'conflicting', 'experience', 'feel', 'way', 'lot', 'work', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'lot', 'Elephant', 'ways', 'because', 'having', 'seen', 'Elephant', 'pondered', 'immensely', 'film', 'awkwardness', 'little', 'better', 'thus', 'relays', 'deeper', 'more', 'rapturous', 'message.The', 'film', 'story', 'teenager', 'named', 'Alex', 'who', 'happened', 'visit', 'skate', 'park', 'called', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'night', 'security', 'guard', 'was', 'killed', 'interrogated', 'police', 'are', 'other', 'skater', 'school', 'involvement', 'killing', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'erode', 'persona', 'distancing', 'closest', 'him.He', 'falling', 'apart.I', 'mention', 'awkwardness', 'outset', 'review', 'what', 'mean', 'naturally', 'stiff', 'feeling', 'teenage', 'angst', 'frame', 'narration', 'poor', 'profit', 'stumbled', 'reading', 'emotionally', 'confused', 'state', 'Alex', 'conversations', 'read', 'true', 'even', 'when', 'appear', 'pointless', 'point', 'plot', 'unraveling', 'marvelously', 'textured', 'start', 'finish', 'have', 'concluded', 'film', 'gay', 'allegory', 'can', 'totally', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Alex', 'gay', 'separation', 'girlfriend', 'most', 'definitely', 'part', 'emotional', 'confliction', 'due', 'current', 'state', 'do', 'feel', 'undertones', 'are', 'there', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'concealing', 'something', 'feel', 'will', 'ostracize', 'pain', 'concealment', 'Beings', 'Van', 'Sant', 'gay', 'man', 'can', 'see', 'influence', 'personal', 'story', 'bleeding', 'films', 'moral', 'core.Using', 'regular', 'kids', 'newbies', 'business', 'play', 'parts', 'here', 'was', 'major', 'plus', 'seem', 'uncomfortable', 'own', 'skin', ""n't"", 'something', 'can', 'readily', 'display', 'well', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'own', 'skin.For', 'anticlimactic', 'ending', 'perfection', 'When', 'reviewing', 'Elephant', 'mentioned', 'film', 'was', 'basically', 'designed', 'make', 'feel', 'nothing', 'killings', 'walked', 'away', 'void', 'feeling', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'similar', 'can', 'feel', 'coldness', 'true', 'testament', 'moral', 'state', 'society', 'today', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'truly', 'audience', 'Alex', 'here', 'Alex', 'not', 'void', 'feeling', 'breakdowns', 'are', 'strong', 'passionate', 'consequences', 'actions', 'so', 'profoundly', 'final', 'frames', 'fire', 'burn', 'brightly', 'loud', 'statement', 'reigning', 'personal', 'feelings', 'delivering', 'severe', 'blow', 'consciences', 'are', 'brought', 'world', 'brought', 'level', 'then', 'suddenly', 'are', 'left', 'contemplating', 'what', 'Alex', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'concluded.It', 'stunning']",N/A
1176037,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B001CDFY7S,Andrew Raker,"[1, 2]","I thought Paranoid Park was relatively well-done for its budget. Certainly, it was a very low production cost film.  Therefore, if it were a Hollywood production, I would have to give it 1 star.However, the film really tries to convey its message through songs, imagery, and silence. While I think that helps to create a proper mood, I prefer films there to have more dialogue, a slightly more orderly plot, and better picture quality.Now, the goal might have been to create a film that reminds you of a home-made production. If this was the intent, the film delivered moderately well. Certainly, the viewer is acquainted to the the struggles Gabe Nevins' character faces: parents' breakup, girl problems, and then, his responsibility for the death of a watchman.The end presents another difficulty. SPOILER. For a young man who is pretty well involved (i.e. they find his skateboard with victim's DNA), I would have thought the film would include what actually happens to him. As it is, the film does not address this issue.Also, the film contains no scenes that I feel should give a rating over PG. In fact, there are G-rated films with just as much violence. In short, while the film does have violence in a way, it is through images, music, and facial expression that you come to realize what the characters are experiencing inside their mind.",3,A Different Kind of Film,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,1347,"['thought', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'was', 'relatively', 'well-done', 'budget', 'Certainly', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'production', 'cost', 'film', 'Therefore', 'were', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'give', '1', 'star.However', 'film', 'really', 'convey', 'message', 'songs', 'imagery', 'silence', 'think', 'create', 'proper', 'mood', 'prefer', 'films', 'there', 'have', 'more', 'dialogue', 'slightly', 'more', 'orderly', 'plot', 'better', 'picture', 'quality.Now', 'goal', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'create', 'film', 'home-made', 'production', 'was', 'intent', 'film', 'delivered', 'moderately', 'well', 'Certainly', 'viewer', 'acquainted', 'struggles', 'Gabe', 'Nevins', 'character', 'parents', 'breakup', 'girl', 'problems', 'then', 'responsibility', 'death', 'watchman.The', 'end', 'difficulty', 'SPOILER', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'pretty', 'well', 'involved', 'i.e', 'find', 'skateboard', 'victim', 'DNA', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'film', 'would', 'include', 'what', 'actually', 'film', 'not', 'address', 'issue.Also', 'film', 'scenes', 'feel', 'should', 'give', 'rating', 'PG', 'fact', 'are', 'G-rated', 'films', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'violence', 'short', 'film', 'have', 'violence', 'way', 'images', 'music', 'facial', 'expression', 'come', 'realize', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'experiencing', 'mind']",N/A

That's the dilemma facing teenaged Alex (Gabe Nevins) in the chillingly plausible, very realistic film Paranoid Park.Alex is a normal kid, and an avid skateboarder. The crowd he hangs with are always chasing the next adrenaline thrill. One popular spot they congregate to hone their boarding skills is in a bad part of town they've nicknamed ""Paranoid Park"". Definitely not a hangout their parents would approve of, so they usually sneak off there when they're supposed to be at other places.One fateful night when Alex was supposedly at a sleepover at his friend Jared's (Jake Miller) house, they were instead out boarding at Paranoid Park. Some friends brought up an extreme but dangerous alternative to boarding, called Train Jumping at the adjacent tracks. Yes, it's exactly what it sounded like, the thrill seekers were jumping onto moving trains and hitching short rides. But while they were doing this, a security guard at the tracks ends up dead.What at first appears to be a tragic accident may be something more, and police are following up saying that it was foul play, and that it had something to do with the skateboarders.Police officials relentlessly question all the teens, find out about the subculture and that particular bad-news bit of real estate. The one thing they suspect although they can't get any information from the closely knit group is that Alex may know more than he's letting on.Through a series of flashbacks, we follow Alex's memories of the night and the guard's death, little by little, and the final pieces of the puzzle don't come together until the end. Not revealing anything more, I can tell you that the end sent chills down my very spine.This was so real, so plausible it haunted me for days after seeing it. The storyline is strong, and deeply rooted in suspense. Definitely worth at least one watch.Paranoid Park",3,Paranoid Park,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1976,"['*What', 'something', 'so', 'terrible', 'happens', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'too', 'much', 'burden', 'keep', 'yourself', 'dilemma', 'facing', 'teenaged', 'Alex', 'Gabe', 'Nevins', 'chillingly', 'plausible', 'very', 'realistic', 'film', 'Paranoid', 'Park.Alex', 'normal', 'kid', 'avid', 'skateboarder', 'crowd', 'are', 'always', 'chasing', 'next', 'adrenaline', 'thrill', 'One', 'popular', 'spot', 'congregate', 'hone', 'boarding', 'skills', 'bad', 'part', 'town', ""'ve"", 'nicknamed', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'Definitely', 'not', 'hangout', 'parents', 'would', 'approve', 'usually', 'sneak', 'off', 'when', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'other', 'places.One', 'fateful', 'night', 'when', 'Alex', 'was', 'supposedly', 'sleepover', 'friend', 'Jared', 'Jake', 'Miller', 'house', 'were', 'instead', 'boarding', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'friends', 'brought', 'up', 'extreme', 'dangerous', 'alternative', 'boarding', 'called', 'Train', 'Jumping', 'adjacent', 'tracks', 'Yes', 'exactly', 'what', 'sounded', 'thrill', 'seekers', 'were', 'jumping', 'moving', 'trains', 'hitching', 'short', 'rides', 'were', 'doing', 'security', 'guard', 'tracks', 'up', 'dead.What', 'first', 'be', 'tragic', 'accident', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'police', 'are', 'following', 'up', 'saying', 'was', 'foul', 'play', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'skateboarders.Police', 'officials', 'relentlessly', 'question', 'teens', 'find', 'out', 'subculture', 'particular', 'bad-news', 'bit', 'real', 'estate', 'one', 'thing', 'suspect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'information', 'closely', 'knit', 'group', 'Alex', 'may', 'know', 'more', 'letting', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'follow', 'Alex', 'memories', 'night', 'guard', 'death', 'little', 'little', 'final', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'end', 'Not', 'revealing', 'anything', 'more', 'can', 'tell', 'end', 'sent', 'chills', 'down', 'very', 'spine.This', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'plausible', 'haunted', 'days', 'seeing', 'storyline', 'strong', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'suspense', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'watch.Paranoid', 'Park']",N/A
1176041,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001CDFY7S,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Paranoid Park is a pretty boring movie overall.  What definitely had potential in the concept quickly deteriorated when it was soon realized that the writers are going for an actual laidback ""skateboarder type"" environment.You see the storyline is supposed to be about a security guard who mysteriously dies as a result of a skateboarder making a horrible mistake.  The investigation team comes to the school to determine the involvement the skateboarders had in the mans death, however that element (that *crucial* element) was never developed enough.  In fact the police were WAY too easy on the kids who obviously showed total disrespect towards them by mocking them in the classroom in one segment and never taking anything serious enough.A man dies under tragic circumstances and *none* of the skateboarders shed any tears or showed any remorse whatsoever.  I don't care how cool or hip it is being among the skateboarding crowd- a lack of human emotions is totally unrealistic.In fact the one investigator only came to the school twice- the REST of the movie was devoted to the skateboarders supposedly retracing their steps pertaining to the death of the security guard, but we the viewers have to sit through a LOT of pointlessness involving the one skateboarders girlfriend and their relationship, and tricks being performed at the downtown park in slow-motion for dramatic effect, and a few trips to the local mall.  NONE of these things advance the storyline whatsoever.Oh, and a good ending could have saved the movie at least somewhat, but... no, that ending is really terrible and accomplishes nothing.

The whole film hitches on the performance of its star, Gabe Nevins; fortunately, Nevins is in just about every scene of the movie.  Nevins is an absolute newcomer to movie-acting, but he works perfectly here.  Every scene that he's in, the viewer is completely captured in his quiet, emotional turmoil.  Nevins' big, beautiful, sulky eyes tell a story all their own.  He's wonderful.Unfortunately, the other young actors are not so comfortable or capable in front of the camera.  They are genuine enough though for it to be forgiven though.  The real problem here is Van Sant, who's cinematography is trying far too hard to ""look"" independent.  The goofy camera angles and Van Sant's trademark moving-angle/moving-actor camerawork seem un-natural and distract from developing the characters more (which is where more focus was needed).  The story jumps forwards and backwards in time so much that sometimes you don't know when you are, but once you've figured the chronology out, that's not a big complaint for me.Overall, the film is a success.  It's a reasonable enough story with interesting characters that's well-held-together by an amazing and fresh young performance by Gabe Nevins (just watching him is reason enough to see this movie).  As a bonus, the material he's acting out is unique and interesting.  A solid thumbs-up purchase for me.

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[0, 1]","Since Gus Van Sant is so devoted at langorously following around ennui-filled young folks about to do something violent, I'll take it as assumed that he has a purpose for it.  Following Gerry, Elephant, and Last Days, I didn't really look forward to sitting through Paranoid Park, and in truth, I was starting to wonder if Van Sant is coasting on his own high-minded fumes.  Using the story of Alex (Gabe Nevins), the compendious skater who can't quite straighten out his thoughts on a murder he may or may not have been a part of, Van Sant, it turns out, is onto something.  Amidst the slow tale of mystery, and of how Alex will approach the mystery, he gives us, quietly, a story about a teenager's disaffection from the people around him.  He dramatizes, with convincing sadness and creativity, the way in which the most ""normal"" of us can harbor dark, perplexing thoughts, and have no one in their life they feel comfortable voicing them to.  I felt for Alex, who does something, and sorta doesn't do it, and who sees the ""freaks and punks"" at Paranoid Park as people that are truly ""free.""  I was struck and sympathetic, but I confess I don't have any affection for Van Sant's MO of letting stiff, ""regular"" people wander around until they do something.  Here, his story has some moral implications, but I wonder if it's worth the psuedo-romantic gaze to get there - visually arresting as it is, can't Van Sant get there without the pretentious window dressing?

1176047,A1ZOUKFV07V8RK,B001CDFY7S,hated and proud,"[0, 0]","The other reviews on this pretty well say it all, I just enjoyed this film so much I had to write one myself, to get it out there I guess.The stroy is explained very well because it is very simple. A teenage skater is involved in a security guards death, and instead of coming forward he decides to hide the crime. Not terribly complicated.I guess what won me over the most was the acting. In no way is any of it considered oscar worthy, but that is exactly what makes it great. The dialouge is exactly with the times. A ton of ""likes"", ""whatever's"" and ""so yeah's"", words in everyones lexicon these days. It just made it seem so real. No crocodile tears, nothing to make it seem like a movie. I wouldn't doubt it if the script was written by high school kids themselves.Another great aspect of this particular film is the almost total lack of adult or authority figures in it. The main character's parent are rarely seen, and when they are seen it is usually from far away, from behind, or blurred in some way or another. Teachers are all but absent. The only real adult in the film is the detective, and even his appearance is pretty short and ultimately unimportant. The entire film is from an adolescent point of view, but that doesn't mean that there is no underdstanding therein.As said by many the camera work during the sequences of skating are remarkable. Slow motion, close-up points of view, all of I found made it kind of surreal and beautiful. Those scenes brought tranqulity to the chaoctic circumstances presented in it.It does a very good job of presenting the main character as sympathetic, a teen troubled with what he had been involved in, a broken family, a going-nowhere- relationship with his girlfriend, all of it made him seem like someone we all could know or have known.The only drawback I have with this film is the music. Some of it (especially during the skateboarding scenes) was amazing. But at other points I couldn't tell if it was taking itself seriously. It's difficult for me to explain, but sometimes it almost seemed like the director wanted me to laugh just due to their selection during certain scenes.My overall impression it that this was a very good movie, very well made, and I would recommend this to anyone for sure.",4,My own piece,1305417600,"05 15, 2011",2011,2262,"['other', 'reviews', 'pretty', 'well', 'say', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'write', 'one', 'get', 'there', 'guess.The', 'stroy', 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'simple', 'teenage', 'skater', 'involved', 'security', 'guards', 'death', 'instead', 'coming', 'forward', 'hide', 'crime', 'Not', 'terribly', 'complicated.I', 'guess', 'what', 'won', 'most', 'was', 'acting', 'way', 'considered', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'exactly', 'what', 'great', 'dialouge', 'exactly', 'times', 'ton', 'likes', 'so', 'words', 'everyones', 'days', 'just', 'made', 'seem', 'so', 'real', 'crocodile', 'tears', 'nothing', 'make', 'seem', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'themselves.Another', 'great', 'aspect', 'particular', 'film', 'almost', 'total', 'lack', 'adult', 'authority', 'figures', 'main', 'character', 'parent', 'are', 'rarely', 'seen', 'when', 'are', 'seen', 'usually', 'far', 'away', 'blurred', 'way', 'Teachers', 'are', 'absent', 'only', 'real', 'adult', 'film', 'detective', 'even', 'appearance', 'pretty', 'short', 'ultimately', 'unimportant', 'entire', 'film', 'adolescent', 'point', 'view', ""n't"", 'mean', 'underdstanding', 'therein.As', 'said', 'many', 'camera', 'work', 'sequences', 'skating', 'are', 'remarkable', 'Slow', 'motion', 'close-up', 'points', 'view', 'found', 'made', 'kind', 'surreal', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'brought', 'tranqulity', 'chaoctic', 'circumstances', 'presented', 'it.It', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'main', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'teen', 'troubled', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'broken', 'family', 'going-nowhere-', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'made', 'seem', 'someone', 'could', 'know', 'have', 'known.The', 'only', 'drawback', 'have', 'film', 'music', 'especially', 'skateboarding', 'scenes', 'was', 'amazing', 'other', 'points', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'taking', 'seriously', 'difficult', 'explain', 'almost', 'seemed', 'director', 'wanted', 'laugh', 'just', 'due', 'selection', 'certain', 'scenes.My', 'overall', 'impression', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'sure']",N/A
1176048,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B001CDFY7S,J. Martin,"[1, 1]","Gus Van Sant is by far the most interesting director working today. He's good enough at making mainstream Hollywood movies (likeTo Die For,Good Will Hunting,Psycho, andMilk) to get funding to make the movies he really cares about, like Paranoid Park, ""little"" movies that are infinitely more interesting than the big ones. He's made use of Hollywood, but so far he hasn't shown any sign of selling out to Hollywood. After every blockbuster, he goes home to Portland and gets back to work.Since he follows his own muse (and her alone) in making these little movies, it wouldn't matter if every reviewer here thought they were too slow or boring or pretentious, as a large number do. He obviously makes them to please himself and not any audience, so it's almost a coincidence if anybody else likes them. Fortunately, I'm one who does.Every ""real"" Van Sant movie, fromMala NochetoParanoid Park, is a fascinating invitation to see and hear and (best of all) feel his very personal, quirky, lyrical, surreal, usually gritty and always fascinating take on a tiny little corner of this very wide world. He doesn't care enough what any of us think about his work to make it more palatable. Thank God. Like a true creator, he does what feels right to him. The beauty in that approach is that it gives us access to something completely unique, unavailable anywhere else.People who insist on being spoon-fed their entertainment in familiar packages tend not to like Van Sant's little independent movies, but those people have many other options. Neatly packaged, predigested entertainment in familiar formats is what Hollywood cranks out by the hundreds every year. For the rest of us, there are the few odd geniuses like Gus Van Sant, willing to share their vision untainted by the public's demands for entertainment. He keeps on making these quirky gems, and they are consistently challenging, brilliant and very distinctive. Nobody would ever mistake a real Van Sant movie for one from The Walt Disney Company.Van Sant is at heart a painter, after all, not a writer, not a storyteller, not a teacher. He gives us an impression of a story, a glimpse into it, not a neatly sequential, fully wrapped-up and satisfying narrative. He never gives us all the facts or answers every question or ties up every loose end, and he rarely tells a story in chronological order. He never, ever thinks for us. He gives us a glimpse into an experience and leaves us free to get whatever we can out of it.I'm not saying that Van Sant's movies are just free-associating, chaotic messes. Paranoid Park, for example, is beautifully if unconventionally structured. The ghastly ""crime"" is in almost the exact center of the movie, with the details and consequences weaving in and out around it in both directions like swirls in a whirlpool.Like Van Sant's other independent movies (and like all truly great movies), Paranoid Park cannot be fully appreciated in one viewing, or even two or three. That may be one reason some people don't like them--you don't get up from the first viewing as satisfied as if you'd finished a good meal. If anything, you leave hungrier than when you started. Only the second or third time do you even begin to comprehend what you've seen, to appreciate how the various, disparate elements fit together into an emotionally coherent and powerful whole.I'll give an example. One very unusual thing Van Sant does in Paranoid Park is use background music originally composed for somebody else's movie, in this case several of Nino Rota's 40-year-old themes from Fellini'sJuliet Of The Spirits. That music often accompanies one of the long slow-motion scenes of Alex just walking that so many reviewers complain about.When I was watching Paranoid Park the first time, I noticed that that music sounded familiar, and I liked it, but I didn't recognize what it was until I saw the end credits. So I thought a while about why Van Sant would do such a strange thing, and I started remembering Juliet, and seeing similarities between Juliet's story and Alex's, and how perfectly her music fitted his experiences, and so the second time it was like watching a whole new movie.That's how great movies are supposed to be. If you get all there is to get the first time, it means there wasn't much worth getting.I'm tempted to say that Paranoid Park is the best Van Sant movie yet, but that's just because it's the one that's freshest in my mind. I rememberMala Noche, or the River Phoenix scenes inMy Own Private Idaho, or the long dolly shot inLast Days, and I have to rein myself in. So I'll just say that Paranoid Park is the latest little masterpiece in a string of little masterpieces that hopefully will keep growing between the blockbusters for a long, long time.",5,"Quirky,

I not only started paying money to see his films in theaters, but actually bought the DVDs. Beginning with Gerry in 2002, Gus Van Sant recaptured an oeuvre that sadly so many former auteurs lose when they taste mainstream success for the first time. Following Gerry came the exceptional Elephant, Last Days, and 2007's understated masterpiece, Paranoid Park. Based on the story of a young skateboarder and high school student (Alex) who accidentally kills a security guard in the midst of a botched jump from a freight train, Paranoid Park captures the loss of innocence with originality and visceral honesty. After the accident and subsequent discovery of the skateboard that struck the guard, police officers begin to question the protagonist and his friends, some of whom take notice of Alex's changed behavior, building a rich level of tension and internal struggle in the process. Set in Portland, Oregon, and the surrounding region, Paranoid Park stars mostly unknown young actors who effectively express a sense of confusion at one of their own committing a serious crime and their subsequent need to go on with life as usual. Among the many unconventional methods employed in the film, Van Sant allowed several of his young actors to write their own dialogue and wear their own clothes to convey a greater degree of reality. In one of the more famous scenes, skaters in the Burnside Skatepark move in slow motion to Alex's narration, a joyous, yet muted, blend of cinematography and plot. Van Sant recently returned to mainstream cinema with Milk, though he may have created one of the greatest biopics of all time.

But somehow 2007&#8242;s &#8220;Paranoid Park&#8221; slipped by without me noticing.Well no longer. This is &#8220;Paranoid Park&#8221; &#8216;s day in the sun (and a modest sun it is; this website is more like a black dwarf).Before I continue I should warn you though that the title of this non-review reflection is actually a bit of a spoiler. For that I apologize. But what&#8217;s done is done.The film centers on the meandering life of Alex, a teenage skateboarder who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. He&#8217;s not a bad kid. But circumstances conspire against him and, before you know it, somebody has died. But not just died. The death is one of the most disturbing I can recall seeing in a film. Not because it is especially grisly (it is grisly, but not Tarantino grisly) but rather because it is so real.Indeed, like &#8220;Elephant&#8221;, the sheer ordinariness of  &#8221;Paranoid Park&#8221; is one of its most unsettling aspects. As the film unfolded I thought of the dreams (nightmares really) that I&#8217;ve had in the past in which I mistakenly killed somebody. Was I ever relieved to wake up from those dreams. But poor Alex was already awake.The reality is that we could easily find ourselves in Alex&#8217;s scuffed up Converse shoes. I think here of the time I drove twenty hours straight down the interstate even though near the end (on the long drive through Wyoming) I had taken to microsleeps. Semi in the distance. Blink. Semi dangerously close. Yikes. Better get a Steve Winwood cassette in the stereo to wake myself up. Thank God I never ran head long into a Chrysler minivan crammed with a family on their way to Yellowstone. But I could have. And with the right (or wrong) set of circumstances, so could you.With that sobering thought in mind, I invite you to watch Alex as his life unfolds painfully around that fateful event.

1176055,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001CDFY7S,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","When he isn't busy making commercial movies for a mainstream audience (""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Milk""), Gus Van Sant is out there toiling away on the fringes of American cinema, creating low budget, highly idiosyncratic works for a niche market (""Gerry,"" ""Elephant,"" ""Last Days"").In ""Paranoid Park,"" which has been derived from the novel by Blake Nelson, Van Sant sets his sights on the skateboarding underclass of Portland, Oregon.  Alex is a fairly typical angst-ridden teen, whose parents are in the process of getting a divorce and who finds little in life to ignite his passion beyond skateboarding.  Yet, he is generally respectful of his elders and lacks the initiative even to be truly rebellious.  Alex's life changes dramatically, however, when he inadvertently becomes involved with the death of a man not far from the local skater park where he and his buddy have just recently begun to hang out.  The majority of the movie is focused on Alex's attempts to both maintain the secret of what he's done and cope with the overwhelming guilt caused by the incident.Like many of Van Sant's movies, ""Paranoid Park"" is guaranteed to leave certain members of the audience cold, frustrated by its lapses into artiness and the deliberately amateurish nature of many of its performances.  Yet, it is this very lack of commercial slickness that gives the movie its much needed air of authenticity.  Alex's response to what he's done is wholly in accordance with the way we feel a real person caught in this situation would react.  Nothing about this film feels forced or phony, and Gabe Nevins, with his appropriately understated performance as the troubled teen, engages our sympathy from the outset.  Yet, at the same time, Van Sant's characters seem to move through life as if in a dream, emotionally detached from the world around them, an effect achieved, stylistically, through slow motion photography, a time-shifting narrative, and an eclectic musical score which includes snippets of Nino Rota's pieces from various of Fellini's more phantasmagoric films.Without a whole lot of contrivance or fanfare, ""Paranoid Park"" presents a credible and haunting view of teenage life in America today.",4,The Power of Simplicity,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,2194,"['When', ""n't"", 'busy', 'making', 'commercial', 'movies', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Milk', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'there', 'toiling', 'away', 'fringes', 'American', 'cinema', 'creating', 'low', 'budget', 'highly', 'idiosyncratic', 'works', 'niche', 'market', 'Gerry', 'Elephant', 'Last', 'Days', '.In', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'been', 'derived', 'novel', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'Van', 'Sant', 'sights', 'skateboarding', 'underclass', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'Alex', 'fairly', 'typical', 'angst-ridden', 'teen', 'parents', 'are', 'process', 'getting', 'divorce', 'who', 'little', 'life', 'ignite', 'passion', 'skateboarding', 'generally', 'respectful', 'elders', 'initiative', 'even', 'be', 'truly', 'rebellious', 'Alex', 'life', 'changes', 'dramatically', 'however', 'when', 'inadvertently', 'involved', 'death', 'man', 'not', 'far', 'local', 'skater', 'park', 'where', 'buddy', 'have', 'just', 'recently', 'begun', 'hang', 'out', 'majority', 'movie', 'focused', 'Alex', 'attempts', 'maintain', 'secret', 'what', 'done', 'cope', 'overwhelming', 'guilt', 'caused', 'incident.Like', 'many', 'Van', 'Sant', 'movies', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'guaranteed', 'leave', 'certain', 'members', 'audience', 'cold', 'frustrated', 'lapses', 'artiness', 'deliberately', 'amateurish', 'nature', 'many', 'performances', 'Yet', 'very', 'lack', 'commercial', 'slickness', 'movie', 'much', 'needed', 'air', 'authenticity', 'Alex', 'response', 'what', 'done', 'wholly', 'accordance', 'way', 'feel', 'real', 'person', 'caught', 'situation', 'would', 'react', 'Nothing', 'film', 'feels', 'forced', 'phony', 'Gabe', 'Nevins', 'appropriately', 'understated', 'performance', 'troubled', 'teen', 'sympathy', 'outset', 'same', 'time', 'Van', 'Sant', 'characters', 'seem', 'move', 'through', 'life', 'dream', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'world', 'effect', 'achieved', 'stylistically', 'slow', 'motion', 'photography', 'time-shifting', 'narrative', 'eclectic', 'musical', 'score', 'snippets', 'Nino', 'Rota', 'pieces', 'various', 'Fellini', 'more', 'phantasmagoric', 'films.Without', 'whole', 'lot', 'contrivance', 'fanfare', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'credible', 'haunting', 'view', 'teenage', 'life', 'America', 'today']",N/A
1176056,AZBMTXXNPS6YD,B001CDFY7S,"Subauthor ""jeffgonsalves dot com""","[24, 26]","Alex, the narrarator and protagonist of ""Paranoid Park"", is not your typical romanticised culluloid teen. He is quiet, introspective, and near mute when it comes to verbalizing his feelings. He is the antithesis of a sullen, vapid adolescent skater. On the contrary, I found his parents to be vapid. When he speaks to them, what they say hardly makes an impact, because their efforts to really get through to him are ineffective. It's like carrying out an inane conversation with a stranger in which nothing is really said. Pleasantries are exchanged, but little beyond superficial subjects is broached.The aftershock of a gruesome accident has left Alex shell-shocked. The entire film is about the way guilt haunts him like a shadowy executioner. Close-ups of his friends' faces emphasize the way he searches their expressions for the slightest hint of accusation. Alex lives in a world that offers little joy. His parents are getting divorced, and he has dislocated himself to the lonely confines of a journal. The journal is his confidante, his only witness to paralyzing emotions that stalk him during his waking hours.Alex's character is not glorified in any way. He is awkward like most teens, he is not an expert skateboarder, and is reluctant to venture down the concrete slopes of the skate park carved under a colossal bridge. He is drawn toward Paranoid park because he seeks something resembling companionship and family. Jumping a boxcar leads to a fatal and grisly accident. Alex must live with the consequences of this mistake, which leads to intriguing questions about morality and the complexities of unintentional manslaughter. Gus Van Sant is not interested in the cogs of the judicial system, however, he is interested in the tormented machinery ticking away inside the young skater's head. Every aspect of reality is overshadowed by shame.A scene in which Alex dissociates in a hot shower was compelling because every part of his body seemed to be weeping, except for his eyes, as if they were afraid to betray his secret. He wanders through gloomy rooms, turning on lights almost as an afterthought. When he has sex with his girlfriend, he does so in a stupor. Immediately afterward, she gets up and brags to her friend on the phone that it was ""fantastic"". To Alex it did little to penetrate the numbness soaking his body. A nimble detective questions him in a way that makes him suspect if he is found guilty, a vast nothing will swallow him. Faces and eyes and vague gestures judge him at every opportunity. Bizarre music in the background informs us that Alex is supposed to be feeling happy or sad, but his facial expression remains flat; incapable of smiling.Gabe Nevins is an expressive actor who captures Alex's blank affect perfectly. He has an extremely difficult task in trying to capture Alex's mental state through posture and facial expressions, rather than simple words. His relationships with family and friends are so meaningless he has no one to confess to, so he buries his suffering to keep from being injured by emotions that are unfamiliar and threatening. Many will complain that the film moves at a snail's pace, but I think this is intentional: the director is submerging us in Alex's psyche, his dread and depression making situations slog by as if mired in quicksand.",5,Guilt as Grim Reaper,1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,3316,"['Alex', 'narrarator', 'protagonist', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'not', 'typical', 'romanticised', 'culluloid', 'teen', 'quiet', 'introspective', 'mute', 'when', 'verbalizing', 'feelings', 'antithesis', 'sullen', 'vapid', 'adolescent', 'skater', 'contrary', 'found', 'parents', 'be', 'vapid', 'When', 'what', 'say', 'hardly', 'impact', 'efforts', 'really', 'get', 'are', 'ineffective', 'carrying', 'out', 'inane', 'conversation', 'stranger', 'nothing', 'really', 'said', 'Pleasantries', 'are', 'exchanged', 'little', 'superficial', 'subjects', 'broached.The', 'aftershock', 'gruesome', 'accident', 'left', 'Alex', 'shell-shocked', 'entire', 'film', 'way', 'guilt', 'haunts', 'shadowy', 'executioner', 'Close-ups', 'friends', 'emphasize', 'way', 'expressions', 'slightest', 'hint', 'accusation', 'Alex', 'world', 'little', 'joy', 'parents', 'are', 'getting', 'divorced', 'dislocated', 'lonely', 'confines', 'journal', 'journal', 'confidante', 'only', 'witness', 'paralyzing', 'emotions', 'stalk', 'waking', 'hours.Alex', 'character', 'not', 'glorified', 'way', 'awkward', 'most', 'teens', 'not', 'expert', 'skateboarder', 'reluctant', 'venture', 'down', 'concrete', 'slopes', 'skate', 'park', 'carved', 'colossal', 'bridge', 'drawn', 'Paranoid', 'park', 'something', 'resembling', 'companionship', 'family', 'Jumping', 'boxcar', 'fatal', 'grisly', 'accident', 'Alex', 'must', 'live', 'consequences', 'mistake', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'morality', 'complexities', 'unintentional', 'manslaughter', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'not', 'interested', 'cogs', 'judicial', 'system', 'however', 'interested', 'tormented', 'machinery', 'ticking', 'away', 'young', 'skater', 'head', 'aspect', 'reality', 'overshadowed', 'shame.A', 'scene', 'Alex', 'hot', 'shower', 'was', 'compelling', 'part', 'body', 'seemed', 'be', 'weeping', 'eyes', 'were', 'afraid', 'betray', 'secret', 'gloomy', 'rooms', 'turning', 'lights', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'When', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'so', 'stupor', 'Immediately', 'afterward', 'up', 'brags', 'friend', 'phone', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Alex', 'did', 'little', 'penetrate', 'numbness', 'soaking', 'body', 'nimble', 'detective', 'questions', 'way', 'suspect', 'found', 'guilty', 'vast', 'nothing', 'will', 'swallow', 'Faces', 'eyes', 'vague', 'gestures', 'judge', 'opportunity', 'Bizarre', 'music', 'background', 'Alex', 'supposed', 'be', 'feeling', 'happy', 'sad', 'facial', 'expression', 'flat', 'incapable', 'smiling.Gabe', 'Nevins', 'expressive', 'actor', 'who', 'Alex', 'blank', 'affect', 'perfectly', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'task', 'trying', 'capture', 'Alex', 'mental', 'state', 'posture', 'facial', 'expressions', 'rather', 'simple', 'words', 'relationships', 'family', 'friends', 'are', 'so', 'meaningless', 'one', 'confess', 'suffering', 'keep', 'being', 'injured', 'emotions', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'threatening', 'Many', 'will', 'complain', 'film', 'moves', 'snail', 'pace', 'think', 'intentional', 'director', 'submerging', 'Alex', 'psyche', 'dread', 'depression', 'making', 'situations', 'slog', 'mired', 'quicksand']",N/A
