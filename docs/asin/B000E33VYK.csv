967091,A2KSRJFZ2R9JK3,B000E33VYK,Fuwwyfootpaws,"[0, 0]","All Dogs Go To Heaven: The Series is a really pleasant show filled with lovable characters, cute light hearted stories, and lots of great humor. I know the DVD boxsets of this show have recently come out, but I would like to review this 4 episode DVD because I've had it for a while.This DVD of All Dogs Go To Heaven: The Series contains 4 great episodes. The episodes are the following.La Doggie Vita: Charlie meets Belladonna who tries to make Charlie turn bad.Magical Misery Tour: Charlie, Itchy, and David find a magic box that can multiply anyone who goes into it. Charlie tries to use it to get through all his noon appointments.Fearless Fido: Charlie and Itchy are at a carnival/fair, and they meet up with Itchy's girlfriend Bess. They soon get harassed by the boxer named Manfred. Manfred is a bully who often tries to scare and intimidate Itchy. Manfred also tries to flirt with Bess, but she dislikes him a lot. Charlie tells him off, then Manfred leaves temporarily. Later, Itchy watches a Hypnotist show, and he becomes hypnotized into thinking he's a superhero.The Big Fetch: This episode is hilarious. Charlie gets knocked on the head, and the whole episode takes place in Charlie's dream. He dreams that he is a detective in a 1930's setting. This episode is hysterically funny, and I laughed out loud many times^^.The complete series of this show has recently come out on DVD. If you find this DVD in stores, you can buy it, or you can just get the seasons on DVD instead. This is a really fun and lovable show.",5,"A fun, cute, and hysterically funny show",1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,1528,"['Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', 'Series', 'really', 'pleasant', 'show', 'filled', 'lovable', 'characters', 'cute', 'light', 'hearted', 'stories', 'lots', 'great', 'humor', 'know', 'DVD', 'boxsets', 'show', 'have', 'recently', 'come', 'out', 'would', 'like', 'review', '4', 'episode', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'had', 'while.This', 'DVD', 'All', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', 'Series', '4', 'great', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'are', 'following.La', 'Doggie', 'Vita', 'Charlie', 'meets', 'Belladonna', 'who', 'make', 'Charlie', 'turn', 'bad.Magical', 'Misery', 'Tour', 'Charlie', 'Itchy', 'David', 'find', 'magic', 'box', 'can', 'multiply', 'anyone', 'who', 'Charlie', 'use', 'get', 'noon', 'appointments.Fearless', 'Fido', 'Charlie', 'Itchy', 'are', 'carnival/fair', 'meet', 'up', 'Itchy', 'girlfriend', 'Bess', 'soon', 'get', 'harassed', 'boxer', 'named', 'Manfred', 'Manfred', 'bully', 'who', 'often', 'scare', 'intimidate', 'Itchy', 'Manfred', 'also', 'flirt', 'Bess', 'lot', 'Charlie', 'off', 'then', 'Manfred', 'temporarily', 'Later', 'Itchy', 'Hypnotist', 'show', 'hypnotized', 'thinking', 'superhero.The', 'Big', 'Fetch', 'episode', 'hilarious', 'Charlie', 'knocked', 'head', 'whole', 'episode', 'place', 'Charlie', 'dream', 'detective', '1930', 'setting', 'episode', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'times^^.The', 'complete', 'series', 'show', 'recently', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'find', 'DVD', 'stores', 'can', 'buy', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'instead', 'really', 'fun', 'lovable', 'show']",All Dogs Go to Heaven - Dogs Undercover
