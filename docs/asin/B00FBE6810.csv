But it had 1 element in common with those movies. The story was thin. Very thin. It feels like these types of films are made by crafting scenes around the treatment, as opposed to an actual fully completed script. In this movie, the story is about how 1 family's trauma affects each sibling, all daughters. Good premise, good idea, but not fully developed or executed. For instance, the movie dragged up until the climax. The daughters carried a ton of potential for dramatic tension , individually and collectively, (1 was a felon, the other a stripper, and the third an addict with a high level dealer boyfriend; the latter was a half sister actually, and her existence was key to the family trauma). But it was only hinted at, with the same flashback sequence shown repeatedly. The dialogue between them did not feel genuine to me, meaning I would not imagine real people in their shoes using the language the actors had to deliver. It didn't fit and it distracted me. Anyway, not much happened, in terms of setting up any tension I could feel, .post arrival at the house and the climactic sequence. The 2 actual events that started to were dispatched posthaste. Then I was back to the same old, same old. Once the climax arrived, it was good, though the style of dialogue carried on till the bitter end. So, while it was better than much of what I've seen lately, it could've been so much better and it was so noticeable to me that I couldn't help but thinking it as I was watching. Still, worth a watch for horror junkies in these days of prohibition.",3,"Horror Junkie's review: 3.5 really, potential for 4 wasted",1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,1681,"['pros', 'real', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'expected', 'actual', 'acting', 'so', 'definitely', 'not', 'horrorible', 'subgenre', 'had', '1', 'element', 'common', 'movies', 'story', 'was', 'thin', 'Very', 'thin', 'types', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'crafting', 'scenes', 'treatment', 'opposed', 'actual', 'fully', 'completed', 'script', 'movie', 'story', 'how', '1', 'family', 'trauma', 'affects', 'sibling', 'daughters', 'Good', 'premise', 'good', 'idea', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'executed', 'instance', 'movie', 'dragged', 'up', 'climax', 'daughters', 'carried', 'ton', 'potential', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'individually', 'collectively', '1', 'was', 'felon', 'other', 'stripper', 'third', 'addict', 'high', 'level', 'dealer', 'boyfriend', 'latter', 'was', 'half', 'sister', 'actually', 'existence', 'was', 'key', 'family', 'trauma', 'was', 'only', 'hinted', 'same', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'shown', 'repeatedly', 'dialogue', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'genuine', 'meaning', 'would', 'not', 'imagine', 'real', 'people', 'shoes', 'using', 'language', 'actors', 'had', 'deliver', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'distracted', 'Anyway', 'not', 'much', 'happened', 'terms', 'setting', 'up', 'tension', 'could', 'feel', '.post', 'arrival', 'house', 'climactic', 'sequence', '2', 'actual', 'events', 'started', 'were', 'dispatched', 'posthaste', 'Then', 'was', 'back', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'Once', 'climax', 'arrived', 'was', 'good', 'style', 'dialogue', 'carried', 'bitter', 'end', 'So', 'was', 'better', 'much', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'so', 'noticeable', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'was', 'watching', 'Still', 'watch', 'horror', 'junkies', 'days', 'prohibition']",House of Bad

Actually, I thought this movie might have been even better simply as a family drama, minus the supernatural ghost scenes, although they certainly added an effectively creepy touch.  The only unrealistic aspect of the story line was the youngest sister's heroin withdrawal, which had to be the gentlest and mildest ever!  Withdrawal from opiates is no joke; it's notorious for being excruciatingly painful, with severe, flu-like symptoms.  But don't let that get in the way of this finely-made film that has a lot going for it.
