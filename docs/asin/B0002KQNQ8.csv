838833,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0002KQNQ8,Alistair McHarg,"[9, 9]","What Alice Found is Spartan, it breaks the craft of filmmaking down into its most basic elements and executes well on every one.  There are no flaming helicopters to be found here, or big name stars, nowhere to hide.  Instead of distractions you find a well-conceived script, excellent acting, and subtle moral choices that never invite cheap, easy answers.The entire cast of the picture could, and does, fit into an RV - it's a three-person ensemble piece.  Digital photography gives What Alice Found a scruffy, high school project feeling that is perfectly in step with the protagonist's innocence and the cheesy ambience of truck stop hooking.  In short, writer/director Dean Bell has turned drawbacks into allies.The simple plot supports a complex character study.  Alice, played admirably by newcomer Emily Grace, is running away from home to visit a friend in Florida.  Brief flashbacks are used effectively to inform this decision, and help us understand her background.  On the road she is befriended, unless ""Shanghaied"" is a better word, by a couple that roams truck stops in their mobile brothel RV.  Part pimps and part surrogate parents, they quickly fold Alice into their world.  Though she stays naive, we track her downward spiral by the way she looks.The showcase performance here is by Judith Ivey, her Sandra manages to convey a broad range of emotions, and motives, without ever once seeming forced.  She knows a lot, and she's quick to instruct Alice in the ways of the world, all she's discovered since she escaped Paducah, Kentucky.  Through the course of the film we come to understand that neither Alice nor Sandra are completely innocent or guilty, and despite the unkind conditions, an important bond of understanding has been formed.That is the greatest strength of What Alice Found.  Had it been about an innocent waif victimized by horrid road vagabonds, it would have been two-dimensional.  As it is, there's real depth.  Highly recommended.",4,You Should Find It Too,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,1972,"['What', 'Alice', 'Found', 'Spartan', 'craft', 'filmmaking', 'down', 'most', 'basic', 'elements', 'well', 'one', 'are', 'flaming', 'helicopters', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'nowhere', 'hide', 'Instead', 'distractions', 'find', 'well-conceived', 'script', 'excellent', 'acting', 'subtle', 'moral', 'choices', 'never', 'invite', 'cheap', 'easy', 'answers.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'picture', 'could', 'fit', 'RV', 'three-person', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'Digital', 'photography', 'What', 'Alice', 'Found', 'scruffy', 'high', 'school', 'project', 'feeling', 'perfectly', 'step', 'protagonist', 'innocence', 'cheesy', 'ambience', 'truck', 'stop', 'hooking', 'short', 'writer/director', 'Dean', 'Bell', 'turned', 'drawbacks', 'allies.The', 'simple', 'plot', 'complex', 'character', 'study', 'Alice', 'played', 'admirably', 'newcomer', 'Emily', 'Grace', 'running', 'away', 'home', 'visit', 'friend', 'Florida', 'Brief', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'used', 'effectively', 'inform', 'decision', 'help', 'understand', 'background', 'road', 'befriended', 'Shanghaied', 'better', 'word', 'couple', 'truck', 'stops', 'mobile', 'brothel', 'RV', 'Part', 'pimps', 'part', 'surrogate', 'parents', 'quickly', 'fold', 'Alice', 'world', 'naive', 'track', 'downward', 'spiral', 'way', 'looks.The', 'showcase', 'performance', 'here', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'Sandra', 'convey', 'broad', 'range', 'emotions', 'motives', 'ever', 'once', 'seeming', 'forced', 'lot', 'quick', 'instruct', 'Alice', 'ways', 'world', 'discovered', 'escaped', 'Paducah', 'Kentucky', 'course', 'film', 'come', 'understand', 'Alice', 'Sandra', 'are', 'completely', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'unkind', 'conditions', 'important', 'bond', 'understanding', 'been', 'greatest', 'strength', 'What', 'Alice', 'Found', 'Had', 'been', 'innocent', 'waif', 'victimized', 'horrid', 'road', 'vagabonds', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'two-dimensional', 'real', 'depth', 'Highly', 'recommended']",What Alice Found

Although this is a small-budget film, with all the drawbacks that implies, it's still very much worth seeing. The characters are engaging and complex, and you come to care deeply what will happen to them, especially Alice.I'll look forward to seeing more from director Dean Bell, and will certainly watch for Judith Ivey in future roles.

838836,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0002KQNQ8,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 4]","""What Alice Found"" is one of those flicks that just grabs at you when you're skimming channels for a movie to watch.  It stars newcomer Emily Grace as Alice, a young girl fed up with her dull life in New England who decides to run off to Miami, FL to find herself and possibly get a degree in Marine Biology.  Along the way, she has car trouble and is ""helped"" by Bill and Sandra, an older couple who seem to be as sweet as all get out.  The duo, especially Sandra, becomes attached to Alice and they basically help her out in any way possible.  As the miles pile up on her roadtrip, however, Bill and Sandra take her down the dark road of truck stop prostitution.Emily Grace does a great job as the gullible young Alice.  Judith Ivey, who's probably the only actor in this film that you'll recognize, is wonderful as Sandra.  By the end of the film, you don't know whether to hug her or hit her.  She's so sugary sweet that she's almost too hard to swallow.  However, she gives a great performance.  Bill Raymond plays Bill, who comes across as such a nice guy in the beginning of the film but eventually turns into a dirty and dispicable old man.The story moves along at a solid pace and has a pretty good soundtrack to boot.  It's recommended to fans of indie flicks but the average movie-goer should give it a peek.",4,Engaging,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,1319,"['What', 'Alice', 'Found', 'one', 'flicks', 'just', 'grabs', 'when', ""'re"", 'skimming', 'channels', 'movie', 'watch', 'newcomer', 'Emily', 'Grace', 'Alice', 'young', 'girl', 'fed', 'up', 'dull', 'life', 'New', 'England', 'who', 'run', 'off', 'Miami', 'FL', 'find', 'possibly', 'get', 'degree', 'Marine', 'Biology', 'way', 'car', 'trouble', 'helped', 'Bill', 'Sandra', 'older', 'couple', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'sweet', 'get', 'out', 'duo', 'especially', 'Sandra', 'attached', 'Alice', 'basically', 'help', 'out', 'way', 'possible', 'miles', 'pile', 'up', 'roadtrip', 'however', 'Bill', 'Sandra', 'take', 'down', 'dark', 'road', 'truck', 'stop', 'prostitution.Emily', 'Grace', 'great', 'job', 'gullible', 'young', 'Alice', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'who', 'probably', 'only', 'actor', 'film', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'wonderful', 'Sandra', 'end', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'hug', 'hit', 'so', 'sugary', 'sweet', 'almost', 'too', 'hard', 'swallow', 'However', 'great', 'performance', 'Bill', 'Raymond', 'Bill', 'who', 'across', 'such', 'nice', 'guy', 'beginning', 'film', 'eventually', 'dirty', 'dispicable', 'old', 'man.The', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'solid', 'pace', 'pretty', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'boot', 'recommended', 'fans', 'indie', 'flicks', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'should', 'give', 'peek']",What Alice Found
838837,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B0002KQNQ8,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","While made for what literally looks like $50, and shot on what seems tobe a home video camera, film-maker Bell manages to make theselimitations work for him, giving this disturbing, ambiguous story asense of odd reality. His actors are so good, (especially the great NYtheater actress Judith Ivey) that rather than feeling amateurish, thestyle makes the film feel uncomfortably voyeuristic and appropriate.Alice is running away from an awful home life when she meets awell-meaning couple on the road who help her out, and take her on withthem.  Then they turn out to be less altruistic and somewhat creepierthan they appear.While this might sound like a recipe for a low budget horror film, Bellkeeps the film and the characters in shades of tense but low key grey.Everyone, even our heroine, has their secrets, and true motives arealways a question mark. No heroes, no villains just people survivingand using each other in the process.If this is a 'thriller' at all, it's a thriller of behavior, not actionand violence, ala more recent films like 'We Need to Talk About Kevin'and 'Shame'. It's really more a dark coming-of-age film.Not all the acting is up to Ivey's level, and some of the flashbacksare a bit on-the-nose, but overall I found the film far more quietlyhaunting and thought provoking than the vast majority of what I see.One frustration on the DVD front.  The newer Wellspring is in 1:66,the older Fox Lorber is listed as 1:85 (although I haven;t seen it).While imdb lists 1:85 as correct, it's hard to imagine a generallyfilm friendly company like Wellspring changing to a wrong aspectratio for no reason.  And trying to research it I could find nodefinitive answer as to the film-maker's original intent.  Thatsaid, the Wellspring has a very nicely done commentary track,which is not listed as a feature on the Fox-Lorber.",5,Haunting and effective dark coming of age drama,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,1840,"['made', 'what', 'literally', '50', 'shot', 'what', 'tobe', 'home', 'video', 'camera', 'film-maker', 'Bell', 'make', 'theselimitations', 'work', 'giving', 'disturbing', 'ambiguous', 'story', 'asense', 'odd', 'reality', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'especially', 'great', 'NYtheater', 'actress', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'rather', 'feeling', 'amateurish', 'thestyle', 'film', 'feel', 'uncomfortably', 'voyeuristic', 'appropriate.Alice', 'running', 'away', 'awful', 'home', 'life', 'when', 'awell-meaning', 'couple', 'road', 'who', 'help', 'out', 'take', 'withthem', 'Then', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'less', 'altruistic', 'somewhat', 'appear.While', 'might', 'sound', 'recipe', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'film', 'Bellkeeps', 'film', 'characters', 'shades', 'tense', 'low', 'key', 'grey.Everyone', 'even', 'heroine', 'secrets', 'true', 'motives', 'question', 'mark', 'heroes', 'villains', 'just', 'people', 'survivingand', 'using', 'other', 'process.If', ""'thriller"", 'thriller', 'behavior', 'not', 'actionand', 'violence', 'ala', 'more', 'recent', 'films', ""'We"", 'Need', 'Talk', ""Kevin'and"", ""'Shame"", 'really', 'more', 'dark', 'coming-of-age', 'film.Not', 'acting', 'up', 'Ivey', 'level', 'flashbacksare', 'bit', 'on-the-nose', 'overall', 'found', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'quietlyhaunting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'vast', 'majority', 'what', 'see.One', 'frustration', 'DVD', 'front', 'newer', 'Wellspring', '1:66', 'older', 'Fox', 'Lorber', 'listed', '1:85', 'haven', 'seen', 'imdb', 'lists', '1:85', 'correct', 'hard', 'imagine', 'generallyfilm', 'friendly', 'company', 'Wellspring', 'changing', 'wrong', 'aspectratio', 'reason', 'trying', 'research', 'could', 'find', 'nodefinitive', 'answer', 'film-maker', 'original', 'intent', 'Thatsaid', 'Wellspring', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'commentary', 'track', 'not', 'listed', 'feature', 'Fox-Lorber']",What Alice Found
838838,A2MXTD5CO8SDFE,B0002KQNQ8,U2girl,"[4, 6]","I got this movie because Amazon recommended it based on some other movie that I watched.  I am not sure what movie that was or how it tied to this one, but I guess that is besides the point.  This movie is about a girl that is trying to get away from the town she grew up in like her girlfriend that left to go to college, but she doesn't have it so easy.  She ended up stealing from her boss in order to have some money.  Once she gets on the road in her beat up Escort, her car has problems and she runs into Sandra and Bill.  Because of my usual pessimistic attitude, I was immediately suspicious of this couple.  They were just tooo nice.  That never bodes well with me.Anyways, it is a pretty good film.  It was very real in the sense that alot of girls may run away or somehow get on the streets and are so naive thinking that someone is going to help them just because.  It is a pessimistic attitude, but more than likely if someone comes out of nowhere to help you, normally there is a large price to pay. You have to think about if what you are running away from is really worth the price you will pay for help from strangers.  Alice found out.This movie is not for children, so don't watch it with your little ones.  The Sandra character was a mixed bag, she was just so doggone sweet and understanding that you just don't really know how to feel about her.  Even though I did like the film, I am not sure if/when I would watch it again.  I did find the movie interesting and I thought the acting was great.  I also thought they did a good job of setting the characters up so that you could actually feel during the movie.
