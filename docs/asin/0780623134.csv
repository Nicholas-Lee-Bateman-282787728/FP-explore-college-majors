32292,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,0780623134,AbeStreet,"[2, 6]","One of the best films I've ever seen.  Unfortunately I did not get to see this film in the theaters. When this film was released in 1994 I had grown tired of the ""prison"" movie. I had already seen TANGO & CASH (T&C;) and LOCK UP (LU) both of these films starred Sylvester Stallone. I had also seen Death Warrant (DW) with Jean Claude Van Damme and figured that this would just be another run of them mill movie about a guy wrongfully imprisoned. Eventually I rented this film and boy was I wrong! Unlike the earlier mentioned films this was not an action flick but an emotional story about the hardships of prison life and the struggle an inmate encounters trying to maintain hope of eventually leaving the prison. I so enjoyed this movie that I obtained the original novel and found that while there are some changes to the story they are relatively minor and do not detract from the theme of the story. In my review I will compare the book to the film.1. In the book Andy Dufresne is in jail until 1975. In the movie he is only in jail until 1967.2. In the book Andy's poster at the time of his departure is one of Linda Ronstadt. In the movie it is Raquel Welch.3. In the book Andy served time under several wardens and head guards. In the movie Warden Norton was in office for Andy's entire prison stay as was the head guard Byron Hadley. Actually in the book Byron Hadley was the head guard when Andy arrived in Shawshank and had retired by the time Norton became warden.4. In the book Red is describe as Irish and although no reference is made to his race I assumed he was white. In the movie Red is black being portrayed by Morgan Freeman, and the character Red indicates that he is Irish. While this does not contradict the book I think by making Red an African American it differed from most readers conception of Red. However, Morgan Freeman did such a fine job in the role of Red it is impossible for me to think of anyone else in that role.5. In the book Andy, with help from a friend in the outside world, invests all his money prior to his arrest under a false identity so that when he leaves Shawshank he has money to start over with. In the movie Andy departs with Warden Norton's ill gotten gains to start his new life.6. In the book no warden commits suicide and no prisoner is killed after the warden stages a fake escape attempt. Both these acts occur in the move.There are other small differences between the movie and the book but none that alter the overall story. I would suggest to all that this story is worth reading and watching. There is a reason that it is ranked so high in IMDB's ranking chart.Just a bit of trivia for Stephen King fans. The character of Andy Dufresne also has a key cameo role in Stephen King's book APT PUPIL. It is Andy Dufresne that unknowingly helps escaped Nazi henchman Kurt Dussander set up a life in America. This occurs while Andy is working at the Maine bank prior to going to Shawshank.",5,It's hard to believe this film didn't win Best Picture!!!!!,1032912000,"09 25, 2002",2002,2947,"['One', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'film', 'theaters', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1994', 'had', 'grown', 'tired', 'prison', 'movie', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'TANGO', 'CASH', 'T', 'C', 'LOCK', 'UP', 'LU', 'films', 'starred', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'had', 'also', 'seen', 'Death', 'Warrant', 'DW', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'figured', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'run', 'mill', 'movie', 'guy', 'wrongfully', 'imprisoned', 'Eventually', 'rented', 'film', 'boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'earlier', 'mentioned', 'films', 'was', 'not', 'action', 'flick', 'emotional', 'story', 'hardships', 'prison', 'life', 'struggle', 'inmate', 'encounters', 'trying', 'maintain', 'hope', 'eventually', 'leaving', 'prison', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'obtained', 'original', 'novel', 'found', 'are', 'changes', 'story', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'theme', 'story', 'review', 'will', 'compare', 'book', 'film.1', 'book', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'jail', '1975', 'movie', 'only', 'jail', '1967.2', 'book', 'Andy', 'poster', 'time', 'departure', 'one', 'Linda', 'Ronstadt', 'movie', 'Raquel', 'Welch.3', 'book', 'Andy', 'served', 'time', 'several', 'wardens', 'head', 'guards', 'movie', 'Warden', 'Norton', 'was', 'office', 'Andy', 'entire', 'prison', 'stay', 'was', 'head', 'guard', 'Byron', 'Hadley', 'Actually', 'book', 'Byron', 'Hadley', 'was', 'head', 'guard', 'when', 'Andy', 'arrived', 'Shawshank', 'had', 'retired', 'time', 'Norton', 'became', 'warden.4', 'book', 'Red', 'describe', 'Irish', 'reference', 'made', 'race', 'assumed', 'was', 'white', 'movie', 'Red', 'black', 'being', 'portrayed', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'Red', 'Irish', 'not', 'contradict', 'book', 'think', 'making', 'Red', 'African', 'American', 'differed', 'most', 'readers', 'conception', 'Red', 'However', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'role', 'Red', 'impossible', 'think', 'anyone', 'else', 'role.5', 'book', 'Andy', 'help', 'friend', 'outside', 'world', 'money', 'prior', 'arrest', 'false', 'identity', 'so', 'when', 'Shawshank', 'money', 'start', 'movie', 'Andy', 'Warden', 'Norton', 'ill', 'gotten', 'gains', 'start', 'new', 'life.6', 'book', 'warden', 'commits', 'suicide', 'prisoner', 'killed', 'warden', 'fake', 'escape', 'attempt', 'acts', 'occur', 'move.There', 'are', 'other', 'small', 'differences', 'movie', 'book', 'none', 'overall', 'story', 'would', 'suggest', 'story', 'worth', 'reading', 'watching', 'reason', 'ranked', 'so', 'high', 'IMDB', 'ranking', 'chart.Just', 'bit', 'trivia', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fans', 'character', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'also', 'key', 'cameo', 'role', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'APT', 'PUPIL', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'unknowingly', 'escaped', 'Nazi', 'henchman', 'Kurt', 'Dussander', 'set', 'up', 'life', 'America', 'Andy', 'working', 'Maine', 'bank', 'prior', 'going', 'Shawshank']",N/A

32294,ADLVFFE4VBT8,0780623134,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[6, 6]","I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered the Shawshank Redemption on Blu. It was my third, having already enjoyed the VHS and the DVD. It's one of my favorite movies, the all-time 'guy movie' (but all genders should love it), a show of friendship, loyalty, love of freedom and, above all, love of life in freedom. And who could tell a story better than Stephen King, the number one story-teller in residence? And who else practically exhales humanity if not Morgan Freedman as Red Redding? Add Tim Robins as the mysterious and never tired of living Andy Dufresne and it's a movie that at least I keep watching over and over again. I've already watched the Blu edition twice after having watched the DVD and the VHS who knows how many more times.But I won't be reviewing the movie or the script - it's been done thousands of times already by others, much better qualified. I only want to discuss this most impressive Blu-ray rendition. So, here it comes.THE BINDINGPhysically, it comes in what I see it's called a 'book' binding. I have one other edition of 'The Matrix' put together in the same fashion. It is literally a book. Hard-cover style, the disk attached to the inner side of the back cover. If you open the book, carefully, you will find glossy, beautifully illustrated pages dedicated to the many great actors that played in Shawshank, to Stephen King, of course, the director, the writer. Being a book, it doesn't lock. It also doesn't open very well so, like I said, open it carefully.I am not going to say that ""this book binding alone should be reason enough to get yourself the Blu edition"" because it would be silly but the pretty package shows that some TLC was invested when putting this together this release, unlike some other do-it-quick-and-cheap DVD-to-Blu translations - and they know who they are.PICTURE AND SOUNDThe quality is dramatically better when compared to the previous DVD edition. And, no, it does not compare with an upscaled DVD. I watched the first few minutes on the DVD and on the Blu on a PS3 that upscales DVDs and there is no comparison. There is some graininess in scenes shot in semi-dark surroundings but I would call the overall quality of the picture as somewhere between 'excellent' and 'spectacular'.Almost the same to be said about the sound. The TrueHD makes a significant difference on a 7.1 surround system. I know it because the Dolby 5.1 track is also included and even my untrained ears can tell the difference.SPECIAL FEATURESSadly, there's nothing new here. Three LENGTHY features (40-plus minutes each), including a full Charley Rose episode discussing the movie with all the two main actors and the director. The other two extras feature Stephen King, the script writer, the director, the actors, the town where the movie was shot, the 'Shawshank Prison' building (a former real prison in real life), even former 'true' prisoners, talking about how it really was. All three features are worth watching but, sadly, they are in the old 'narrow screen', low-res TV format with 2-channel stereo sound.An alternative sound track with director's commentary is also available.RATING THIS EDITIONWith all the little shortcomings noted, it HAS to be a 5-star because I'm comparing it with any of the prior editions. There are very few movies I have on DVD that I would buy again on Blu but, this would be the one I'd get even if I could only afford buying one.If you have a Blu player and you love The Shawshank Redemption you owe yourself getting this.",5,Blu-ray 'book' edition - a must have,1255651200,"10 16, 2009",2009,3510,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'ordered', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Blu', 'was', 'third', 'having', 'already', 'enjoyed', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'all-time', ""'guy"", 'movie', 'genders', 'should', 'love', 'show', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'love', 'freedom', 'love', 'life', 'freedom', 'who', 'could', 'tell', 'story', 'better', 'Stephen', 'King', 'number', 'one', 'story-teller', 'residence', 'who', 'else', 'practically', 'humanity', 'not', 'Morgan', 'Freedman', 'Red', 'Redding', 'Add', 'Tim', 'Robins', 'mysterious', 'never', 'tired', 'living', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'movie', 'least', 'keep', 'watching', 'over', 'again', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'Blu', 'edition', 'twice', 'having', 'watched', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'who', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'times.But', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'script', 'been', 'done', 'thousands', 'times', 'already', 'others', 'much', 'better', 'qualified', 'only', 'want', 'discuss', 'most', 'impressive', 'Blu-ray', 'rendition', 'So', 'here', 'BINDINGPhysically', 'what', 'see', 'called', ""'book"", 'binding', 'have', 'one', 'other', 'edition', ""'The"", 'Matrix', 'put', 'together', 'same', 'fashion', 'literally', 'book', 'Hard-cover', 'style', 'disk', 'attached', 'inner', 'side', 'back', 'cover', 'open', 'book', 'carefully', 'will', 'find', 'glossy', 'beautifully', 'illustrated', 'pages', 'dedicated', 'many', 'great', 'actors', 'played', 'Shawshank', 'Stephen', 'King', 'course', 'director', 'writer', 'Being', 'book', ""n't"", 'lock', 'also', ""n't"", 'open', 'very', 'well', 'so', 'said', 'open', 'carefully.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'say', 'book', 'binding', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'get', 'Blu', 'edition', 'would', 'be', 'silly', 'pretty', 'package', 'TLC', 'was', 'invested', 'when', 'putting', 'together', 'release', 'other', 'do-it-quick-and-cheap', 'DVD-to-Blu', 'translations', 'know', 'who', 'are.PICTURE', 'SOUNDThe', 'quality', 'dramatically', 'better', 'when', 'compared', 'previous', 'DVD', 'edition', 'not', 'compare', 'upscaled', 'DVD', 'watched', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'PS3', 'DVDs', 'comparison', 'graininess', 'scenes', 'shot', 'semi-dark', 'surroundings', 'would', 'call', 'overall', 'quality', 'picture', 'somewhere', ""'excellent"", ""'spectacular'.Almost"", 'same', 'be', 'said', 'sound', 'TrueHD', 'significant', 'difference', '7.1', 'surround', 'system', 'know', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'track', 'also', 'included', 'even', 'untrained', 'ears', 'can', 'tell', 'difference.SPECIAL', 'FEATURESSadly', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'Three', 'LENGTHY', 'features', '40-plus', 'minutes', 'including', 'full', 'Charley', 'Rose', 'episode', 'discussing', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'director', 'other', 'two', 'extras', 'feature', 'Stephen', 'King', 'script', 'writer', 'director', 'actors', 'town', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', ""'Shawshank"", 'Prison', 'building', 'former', 'real', 'prison', 'real', 'life', 'even', 'former', ""'true"", 'prisoners', 'talking', 'how', 'really', 'was', 'three', 'features', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'sadly', 'are', 'old', 'screen', 'low-res', 'TV', 'format', '2-channel', 'stereo', 'sound.An', 'alternative', 'sound', 'track', 'director', 'commentary', 'also', 'available.RATING', 'THIS', 'EDITIONWith', 'little', 'shortcomings', 'noted', 'be', '5-star', ""'m"", 'comparing', 'prior', 'editions', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'DVD', 'would', 'buy', 'again', 'Blu', 'would', 'be', 'one', ""'d"", 'get', 'even', 'could', 'only', 'afford', 'buying', 'have', 'Blu', 'player', 'love', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'owe', 'getting']",N/A

I like quality in a movie, in every aspect.  Sure I have my favorites among the silly and cheesy films, but for the most part, I'm a tough critic.I find myself without words to properly describe it.  It's a prison movie, yet it's more about freedom than anything--  freedom of both mind and body.  It's about the little things in our lives that make us truly free.My favorite scene in the movie is the one where Andy (Tim Robbins) receives the shipment of library materials and locks himself in the warden's office so he can play a record.  It is an aria from &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and he turns on the loudspeakers so all the men in the yard can hear it too.  Red (Morgan Freeman) says  &quot;I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are better left unsaid. I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful it can't expressed in words, and it makes your heart ache because of it. I tell you, those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a grey place dares to dream. It was as if some beautiful bird had flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away, and for the briefest of moments, every last man in Shawshank felt free.&quot;Gives me goosebumps everytime.

32298,A3BMUBUC1N77U8,0780623134,ahoffoss,"[1, 1]","Let me begin by saying I believe this to be the greatest movie ever made in the history or movie making.  That being said, if there were a way to give this a higher score,...I would.  I've read the book and this movie stays very true to it.  (aside from a few slight modifications to allow it to fit into the ""movie"" time frame)  In all honestly, I've probably watched this movie between 150-200 times.  And I plan to watch it even more.Now for the actual review:  *******There will be spoilers although I'm going to try not to do too much*******This movie takes place in the 1940's and chronicles the struggle of Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) life sentence in Shawshank prison.  In the first scene we witness Andy in the courtroom being cross examined for the double murder of his wife and her lover.  Throughout his explanation, we see his words transformed into scenes depicting his time prior to the murder and what he says actually happened.  Unfortunately for Andy, his words are lost on the jury and the Judge sentences him to two consecutive life sentences (one for each victim).We get our first look inside Shawshank as Red (Morgan Freeman) and some other cons are placing bets on the incoming prisoners.  Each time a bus shows up, bets are placed on which convict will be the first to ""crack"".  After scanning the crew, Red puts all his chips on Andy.  A move that will unfortunately leave him 2 packs of smokes lighter the next morning.  During the night as the other prisons put pressure on the newbies, we discover just how brutal this prison can be as we are fully introduced to Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown).As time passes by, Andy begins his desire to return to a former hobby of his,....polishing and shaping rocks.  He learns that Red is the ""go to"" for smuggling in such items, so he introduces himself.  He and Red quickly form a friendship and so sets the stage for the rest of the movie.Andy quickly falls into a routine filled with both good times and bad (dealing with the other ""not so friendly"" inmates).  The monotony is finally broken when Andy reveals himself a most useful ""employee"" by giving some helpful advice to Captain Hadley while tarring a roof.  Hadley then introduces Andy to Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), who finds Andy a more suitable ""job"" than his current, working in laundry.  He sends Andy to work with librarian, Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore).  After learning about his former job as a Bank President and his help with Captain Hadley's ""problem"", the prison guards begin to come to Andy for financial advice and eventually help with their taxes.  As time passes Andy begins helping Warden Norton launder money through several different programs the Warden sets up. (all while maintaining his innocence)As the years go by, several things have changed at the prison.  Inmates have been released (Brookes) and new ones have arrived. (Tommy - Gil Bellows).  During this time, Andy has been busy building the new ""Brooks Hatlen Memorial Library"", which is considered ""the finest prison library this side of the Mississippi"".  Tommy hears that Andy has helped some inmates get their high school diplomas, so he approaches Andy for help.  During this time Tommy learns of Andy's past and reveals something he's learned during his stay's at various prisons in his lifetime.  With this new information in hand, Andy goes directly to Warden Norton for help, but is, instead, refused.  Andy explains the situation, which only angers the warden and as punishment, is thrown into solitary confinement for a month (which is then extended to two months).  During his time in the hole, Andy learns that Tommy has, in deed, passed his high school equivalency test (with a C+ average).  By the time Andy gets out, Tommy is no longer in the prison and time continues.....At this point, Andy has had enough and decides his time in the jail has come to an end.  He approaches Heywood (William Sadler) on the loading docks and asks for a 6' length of rope.  Without thinking, Heywood gives him the rope and goes about his business.  When Red learns of this, he can't sleep and spends the whole night worrying.  The next morning every prisoner is accounted for,...except Andy.  When the guards rush to his cell to find out what's taking him so long, they not only realize the existing problem, but are then faced with one MUCH, MUCH worse!I REALLY don't want to ruin this movie for the few people still left that haven't seen it.

This is the start of the film but it's basically a catalyst for changing the lead characters life as well as a few others.After being convicted of a double-homicide, Andy is stripped of his life of privilege and sent to feared Shawshank Prison.  Once there things go from bad to worse for him, but that's only for the first few years.  Eventually the warden learns that Andy has special financial talents that can be put to use by means that are legal and otherwise.A twist of fate will cause Andy to get so close to a new trial and the possibility of freedom and redemption that he can taste it.  But prison is not a fairy tale world as the viewer learns from Andy's friend Red.  But hope is never completely lost, and the man who perseveres can triumph over great adversity.There is a happy ending, but don't believe for a second that this is a happy film.Shawshank Redemption is a movie based on a Stephen King story titled ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.""  The movie is dark, but more importantly has adult tones and therefore I recommend not allowing children under the age of 14 to view this film.  This film deals with aspects of prison life that most people would just like to pretend don't exist.The soundtrack is a great bit of music and could stand alone, but works even better within the movie.  The symphonic score was composed by Thomas Newman.  There's even some Mozart thrown in for a few minutes.  Hank Williams sings a song for those who don't like classical.Not much on DVD extras here, but a great movie worth owning.",5,What happens when and honest man goes to prison?,1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2003,1611,"['Andrew', 'Dufresne', 'man', 'convicted', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'start', 'film', 'basically', 'catalyst', 'changing', 'lead', 'characters', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'others.After', 'being', 'convicted', 'double-homicide', 'Andy', 'stripped', 'life', 'privilege', 'sent', 'feared', 'Shawshank', 'Prison', 'Once', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'only', 'first', 'few', 'years', 'Eventually', 'warden', 'Andy', 'special', 'financial', 'talents', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'use', 'means', 'are', 'legal', 'otherwise.A', 'twist', 'fate', 'will', 'cause', 'Andy', 'get', 'so', 'close', 'new', 'trial', 'possibility', 'freedom', 'redemption', 'can', 'taste', 'prison', 'not', 'fairy', 'tale', 'world', 'viewer', 'Andy', 'friend', 'Red', 'hope', 'never', 'completely', 'lost', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'triumph', 'great', 'happy', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'second', 'happy', 'film.Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'movie', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'titled', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'movie', 'dark', 'more', 'importantly', 'adult', 'tones', 'therefore', 'recommend', 'not', 'allowing', 'children', 'age', '14', 'view', 'film', 'film', 'deals', 'aspects', 'prison', 'life', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'pretend', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist.The', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'bit', 'music', 'could', 'stand', 'alone', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'symphonic', 'score', 'was', 'composed', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'even', 'Mozart', 'thrown', 'few', 'minutes', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'song', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'classical.Not', 'much', 'DVD', 'extras', 'here', 'great', 'movie', 'owning']",N/A

32303,ANUN5B8HYZXEJ,0780623134,Alexander Arsov,"[2, 3]","For once, the IMDB top 250 is pretty close to the truth! I am perfectly dismayed to see in Top 10 such perfectly mediocre movies, to say the least, like ''Pulp Fiction'' or ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', but ''The Shawshank Redemption'' and ''The Godfather (Part 1)'' sharing the first place is one of the exceptions when popular taste seems to go hand in hand with great and profound art.''The Shawshank Redemption'', indeed, is one of those movies which are extremely close to perfection; perhaps the indifferent soundtrack is the only weak point but this is of no consequence. The movie has a terrific screenplay, to begin with. Hardly is there a scene that is less than memorable, and most are unforgettable, and the dialogue is superb throughout, combining light humour with unobtrusive but far from negligible philosophical depth. I was amazed to learn that the scene with Mozart's music is not in Stephen King's original, and indeed he didn't like it. I have always thought of this scene as one of the most moving in the movie, together with the harrowing lives of those who come out after 40 or 50 years of imprisonment. It really is damn true that everything in life boils down to this ultimate question: ''Get busy living, or get busy dying?'' In addition to all that, Frank Darabont's direction is masterful. I honestly envy everybody who watches this movie for a first time without knowing any details of the story; he will be able to appreciate Darabont's genius for directing which is apt to be overlooked after numerous viewings. To take but one example: the discovery of Andy's escape and the explanation of it, with the retrospect shots, the consequences and Red's narrative, is well-nigh perfectly executed scene.Having mentioned Andy and Red, need I add that the cast is outstanding? Too bad that Tim Robbins never attained a more prominent place in the Hollywood hall of fame, for he is a fine actor of considerable talent, but Morgan Freeman did. And it is he who delivers many of the most haunting lines here, such as his great (and so true!) speech about the definition of ''institutionalized'' culminating in ''They send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take. The part that counts, anyway.'' Few actors have the ability of Morgan Freeman to make the best of their lines without in the least exaggerating. The supporting cast is equally perfect. Bob Gunton as the warden and Clancy Brown as the chief guard, both of them profoundly sadistic and with rather perverse ideas of gratitude (though I confess I enjoyed Hadley's ''thanks''), are fantastic and so are some of the inmates such as William Sadler as the greatest fan of Hank Williams, Mark Rolston as one of the Sisters who are not homosexual because ''one must be human first and they don't qualify'' (Red) and especially James Whitmore as the old Brooks, probably the most heart-rending character in the movie.There really is no need of wasting words. ''The Shawshank Redemption'' remains one of the most powerful tributes to human spirit ever made for the screen. Everybody MUST see this gem at least once. It is an incredibly inspiring movie, a movie that gives me hope (yes, the best of things!) in human nature like few other works of art, let alone personal experiences, do. Like another equally shattering masterpiece (''One Flew over Cuckoo's Nest''), it reminds us, the free men who rather presumptuously calls ourselves ''normal'', that prisons and lunatic asylums are full, not so much with monsters of depravity, but mostly with ordinary people like you and me who just did one stupid thing more or for whom the pressure of society turned out to be too much; to say nothing of the ridiculously inept prison system rife with callousness and cruelty that range from terror behind the bars to starving outside of them. What better way to finish than one memorable quote from Red's ''institutionalized speech'':''These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.''",5,"''Hope is a good thing, perhaps the best of things.''",1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,4068,"['once', 'IMDB', 'top', '250', 'pretty', 'close', 'truth', 'am', 'perfectly', 'dismayed', 'see', 'Top', '10', 'such', 'perfectly', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'say', 'least', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Godfather', 'Part', '1', 'sharing', 'first', 'place', 'one', 'exceptions', 'when', 'popular', 'taste', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'great', 'profound', 'art', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'indeed', 'one', 'movies', 'are', 'extremely', 'close', 'perfection', 'perhaps', 'indifferent', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'weak', 'point', 'consequence', 'movie', 'terrific', 'screenplay', 'begin', 'Hardly', 'scene', 'less', 'memorable', 'most', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'dialogue', 'superb', 'combining', 'light', 'humour', 'unobtrusive', 'far', 'negligible', 'philosophical', 'depth', 'was', 'amazed', 'learn', 'scene', 'Mozart', 'music', 'not', 'Stephen', 'King', 'original', 'indeed', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'scene', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'movie', 'together', 'harrowing', 'lives', 'who', 'come', 'out', '40', '50', 'years', 'imprisonment', 'really', 'damn', 'true', 'everything', 'life', 'boils', 'down', 'ultimate', 'question', 'Get', 'busy', 'living', 'get', 'busy', 'dying', 'addition', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'direction', 'masterful', 'honestly', 'envy', 'everybody', 'who', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'knowing', 'details', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'Darabont', 'genius', 'directing', 'apt', 'be', 'overlooked', 'numerous', 'viewings', 'take', 'one', 'example', 'discovery', 'Andy', 'escape', 'explanation', 'retrospect', 'shots', 'consequences', 'Red', 'narrative', 'well-nigh', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'scene.Having', 'mentioned', 'Andy', 'Red', 'need', 'add', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'Too', 'bad', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'never', 'attained', 'more', 'prominent', 'place', 'Hollywood', 'hall', 'fame', 'fine', 'actor', 'considerable', 'talent', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'did', 'who', 'many', 'most', 'haunting', 'lines', 'here', 'such', 'great', 'so', 'true', 'speech', 'definition', 'institutionalized', 'culminating', 'send', 'here', 'life', 'exactly', 'what', 'take', 'part', 'anyway', 'Few', 'actors', 'have', 'ability', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'make', 'best', 'lines', 'least', 'exaggerating', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'perfect', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'warden', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'chief', 'guard', 'profoundly', 'sadistic', 'rather', 'perverse', 'ideas', 'gratitude', 'confess', 'enjoyed', 'Hadley', 'thanks', 'are', 'fantastic', 'so', 'are', 'inmates', 'such', 'William', 'Sadler', 'greatest', 'fan', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'Mark', 'Rolston', 'one', 'Sisters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'homosexual', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'human', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'Red', 'especially', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'old', 'Brooks', 'probably', 'most', 'heart-rending', 'character', 'movie.There', 'really', 'need', 'wasting', 'words', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'tributes', 'human', 'spirit', 'ever', 'made', 'screen', 'Everybody', 'MUST', 'see', 'gem', 'least', 'once', 'incredibly', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'movie', 'hope', 'yes', 'best', 'things', 'human', 'nature', 'few', 'other', 'works', 'art', 'let', 'alone', 'personal', 'experiences', 'do', 'equally', 'shattering', 'masterpiece', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'free', 'men', 'who', 'rather', 'presumptuously', 'normal', 'prisons', 'lunatic', 'asylums', 'are', 'full', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'monsters', 'depravity', 'mostly', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'did', 'one', 'stupid', 'thing', 'more', 'whom', 'pressure', 'society', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'say', 'nothing', 'ridiculously', 'prison', 'system', 'rife', 'callousness', 'cruelty', 'range', 'terror', 'bars', 'starving', 'outside', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'finish', 'one', 'memorable', 'quote', 'Red', 'institutionalized', 'speech', ""''These"", 'walls', 'are', 'funny', 'First', 'hate', 'then', 'get', 'used', ""'em"", 'Enough', 'time', 'passes', 'get', 'so', 'depend', 'institutionalized']",N/A

Every time I watch the movie it amazes me.The true beauty of the story lies in the fact that even in a place of gloom and despair people can change their lives.

32316,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780623134,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Every time I watch `The Shawshank Redemption' my first thought upon its closing is `how in the world did this lose the Best Picture Oscar to `Forrest Gump'?'.  In all honesty there really is no comparison when you look at the two films.  One is a generic feel good film wrapped in saccharine clich&eacute;s and the other, this one, is a magnificent character study that slowly yet poignantly captures the very essence of life.No comparison.`The Shawshank Redemption' begins with banker Andy Dufresne being wrongfully accused of murdering his wife and her lover.  He is sentenced to two life sentences (due to his cold demeanor) to be served at Shawshank correctional institution.  He is immediately pegged as a weakling, not build for survival within the prison walls, but Andy soon turns heads as he proves those presumptions false.  Not only is he built for survival, but his presence ultimately helps the other inmates survive as well.  The film focuses on Andy and fellow inmate Red as they build a friendship that will last them forever, each of them learning from and teaching each other about life and what you make of it.  Red has been in prison a time now and has a lot to teach Andy about life within the prison walls, but in the end it is Andy's lessons of hope that bring a new light to Red's eyes.When watching `The Shawshank Redemption' I am constantly in awe at its power.  There is not a single aspect of this film that feels off kilter or missing; in fact I cannot think of a single flaw to write about.  It's hard when a film is this astonishing, for how can you really critique it, and no one wants to read redundant praising that lasts paragraph after paragraph.I will praise it though, and hopefully these praises don't find themselves repetitious.The first major selling point to this film is the script, which beautifully captures the genuine emotional state of the men involved.  You have the fear and hopelessness that corrupts the minds of the newly incarcerated, as well as the comfortable contentment that glosses over those fears as you adjust to life on the inside.  You have the greed and selfishness that infiltrates the eyes of those with power, and the disgust and resentment that permeates the air.  What I think is brought out to perfection is the displacement that shatters the lives of those `lifers' who find themselves out on parole, living amidst the rest of the world and unable to adjust to this freedom that feels to foreign to them.  Every single emotion bubbles to the surface and captivates the audience.Seriously people; `Forrest Gump'?From a technical standpoint, this film is superb.  The camera angles and close framed cinematography is stunning and helps capture each of the emotions the script so wonderfully fleshes out.  You audience can feel the restraint and claustrophobia that the characters feel emotionally, expounding upon the already deeply rooted emotional resonance.  The score, the lighting, the mood, the direction; everything helps elevate the film and create a magnificent cinematic experience.And then, there is the acting.Much praise has been given to Morgan Freeman for his powerful and moving portrayal of Red, but one cannot single out Freeman without mentioning Tim Robbins who serves as the emotional and moral clutch of the whole film.  Without his riveting performance the film would have failed to amount to all that it has become.  As Andy, Robbins brilliantly sifts through his emotional response to his surroundings, capturing his misery but never losing his hope, even when all feels lost.  Freeman is the perfect compliment to Robbins, cycling though Red's loyalty and admiration as well as his experienced emotional callousness.  They are the perfect pair and in all honestly should have BOTH been nominated at the Academy Awards.The long list of supporting players is also exceptional, from Clancy Brown's diabolical Captain Hadley to the slew of inmates that inhabit Shawshank.  William Sadler is memorable as Heywood, and James Whitmore is devastatingly real as Brooks.  His sub-plot regarding his release is one of the most resounding moments in the film.  Gil Bellows has a nice turn as Tommy, a young spunky rookie who makes an impact on the lives of Andy and Red; but when we are speaking of supporting players the one that stands out the most is none other than Bob Gunton.  His portrayal of the sinister Warden Norton is flawless.  He creeps up on you slowly, tearing at your nerves, and when he finally comes out and nails Andy with the bluntest of threats you are utterly blown away.In the end I am ashamed that the Academy went for generic and happy over meaningful and moving.  `The Shawshank Redemption' is not only the greatest film of 1994, but it is possibly one of the greatest films ever made.  There is so much to be learned about ourselves and others, so much which is lurking within every crevasse of Shawshank that we cannot just see this film once but are forced to witness its power over and over again.In the end `The Shawshank Redemption' is about just that; redemption.  One is uplifted upon the closing frames, the fact that hope prevails further cemented into their souls.  `The Shawshank Redemption' is the perfect example of a perfectly balanced film, one that slowly yet masterfully weaves a tail of humanity, starting with emotional death and ending with an abundance of life.",5,The very reason cinema exists...,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,5395,"['time', 'watch',

He is then sent to the Shawshank Prison, where he spends ten years before escaping.  The movie really portrayed what it can be like in prisons-- not how the guards treated people-- but hoe prisoners treat each other. During the movie, you forget that the people are convicts and criminals, and then think of them as people.  During the course of the movie, we see Andy, the main character, bring dramatic changes to the prison, and how he copes with life there. He gets a library, a way for inmates to get out and do better work in the community, educates some of the people he befriends, and uncovers the scandel that the prison warden is doing.

32318,ABSX5TGEGRH76,0780623134,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[6, 6]","The Shawshank Redemption is widely considered to be one of the greatest films in history, and that claim definitely is valid.  Telling the stories of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), the film looks at the brutality of prison life and how sometimes, the most human people in the prison are the prisoners as opposed to the guards.Convicted of killing his wife and the man she was sleeping with, Andy is sent to Shawshank Prison, one of the grittiest and most terrible prisons in Maine.  The warden, Sam Norton (Bob Gunton) is a stern man of God who is a crook at heart; he ""allows"" Andy, who is a former banker, to manipulate the prison accounts so that he can appropriate extra money.  The guard captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) beats prisoners with very little provocation, in fact, he had his men beat a man to death on his first night because he was crying.  However, the prisoners aren't saints either.  Beatings, rape, and other kinds of abuse go on between prisoners, and the guards tend to let it happen.  Meanwhile, Red looks on as Andy slowly adjusts to life at Shawshank.  Red is ""the guy who can get stuff"", and Andy begins requesting strange items.  He asks for a rock hammer so that he can continue his hobby of geology and he asks for a poster of Rita Hayworth in order to have something pretty to look at.  Andy and Red become friends, and soon Andy is fairly popular around the yard.He cements his status as the favorite of both the guards and the prisoners when he gives valuable financial advice to Hadley in exchange for getting some beers for his friends.  Soon, Warden Norton employs him in the prison library, which he turns into the most comprehensive and well-run prison library in New England.  Eventually, Andy becomes the go-to guy in Shawshank, turning felons and guards into more civilized people.In addition to the story, the movie has great themes and observations.  Throughout his sentence, Andy claims that he is innocent of the crime.  After he begins doing shady accounting for Norton, Andy comments to Red that it wasn't until after his incarceration that he became a crook.  The ideas of hope and fear are expertly dealt with in the film.  Both are seen as having the possibility to do good or evil, and it all comes down to how we want our lives to turn out.For a movie about prison life, The Shawshank Redemption is surprisingly uplifting.  It has numerous moments of intense violence and hatred, but overall, it is a story about hope and the goodness that can exist even in the hardest of convicts.  This movie should definitely be on every person's list of movies to see in their lifetime.",5,A Wonder In Filmmaking,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,2669,"['Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'history', 'claim', 'definitely', 'valid', 'Telling', 'stories', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Ellis', 'Red', 'Redding', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'film', 'brutality', 'prison', 'life', 'how', 'sometimes', 'most', 'human', 'people', 'prison', 'are', 'prisoners', 'opposed', 'guards.Convicted', 'killing', 'wife', 'man', 'was', 'sleeping', 'Andy', 'sent', 'Shawshank', 'Prison', 'one', 'grittiest', 'most', 'terrible', 'prisons', 'Maine', 'warden', 'Sam', 'Norton', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'stern', 'man', 'God', 'who', 'crook', 'heart', 'Andy', 'who', 'former', 'banker', 'manipulate', 'prison', 'accounts', 'so', 'can', 'appropriate', 'extra', 'money', 'guard', 'captain', 'Byron', 'Hadley', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'prisoners', 'very', 'little', 'provocation', 'fact', 'had', 'men', 'beat', 'man', 'death', 'first', 'night', 'was', 'crying', 'However', 'prisoners', 'are', ""n't"", 'saints', 'either', 'Beatings', 'rape', 'other', 'kinds', 'abuse', 'go', 'prisoners', 'guards', 'tend', 'let', 'happen', 'Meanwhile', 'Red', 'Andy', 'slowly', 'life', 'Shawshank', 'Red', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'stuff', 'Andy', 'requesting', 'strange', 'items', 'rock', 'hammer', 'can', 'continue', 'hobby', 'geology', 'poster', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'order', 'have', 'something', 'pretty', 'look', 'Andy', 'Red', 'become', 'friends', 'soon', 'Andy', 'fairly', 'popular', 'yard.He', 'status', 'favorite', 'guards', 'prisoners', 'when', 'valuable', 'financial', 'advice', 'Hadley', 'exchange', 'getting', 'beers', 'friends', 'Soon', 'Warden', 'Norton', 'prison', 'library', 'most', 'comprehensive', 'well-run', 'prison', 'library', 'New', 'England', 'Eventually', 'Andy', 'go-to', 'guy', 'Shawshank', 'turning', 'felons', 'guards', 'more', 'civilized', 'people.In', 'addition', 'story', 'movie', 'great', 'themes', 'observations', 'sentence', 'Andy', 'innocent', 'crime', 'doing', 'shady', 'accounting', 'Norton', 'Andy', 'comments', 'Red', 'was', ""n't"", 'incarceration', 'became', 'crook', 'ideas', 'hope', 'fear', 'are', 'expertly', 'dealt', 'film', 'are', 'seen', 'having', 'possibility', 'do', 'good', 'evil', 'down', 'how', 'want', 'lives', 'turn', 'out.For', 'movie', 'prison', 'life', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'surprisingly', 'uplifting', 'numerous', 'moments', 'intense', 'violence', 'hatred', 'overall', 'story', 'hope', 'goodness', 'can', 'exist', 'even', 'hardest', 'convicts', 'movie', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'person', 'list', 'movies', 'see', 'lifetime']",N/A

This is the tale of Andy Dufrense convicted of murdering his wife &quot;and the fella she was banging.&quot; Andy is then sent to Shawshank prison to server back to back life sentences. While there he meets Red, the only guilty man in Shawshank, and his group of friends that make the time easier. He also meets Boggs and the bull queers who make his life a living hell.  Through the course of actions, Andy begins to accept he is in prison and makes the best of it.  He uses his skills as a banker to do favors for the warden and the guards, and in return he tries to make Shawshank more tolerable for all, by building a library and helping to educate the inmates.  Andy seems content to remain in prison, he has found his niche, then he gets word that there may be evidence that could set him free, when the warden disregards the information, Andy generally goes insane and makes a last ditch effort to get out. The film is a roller coaster of emotions, some comical, some tragic, and in the end total redemption.  I have seen it many times and still come close to tears at points.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman create wonderful characters and should have both won Oscars.

Without any high-adrenaline action sequences or steamy sex scenes (two sure-fire ways to get the vewer's attention), this film somehow has the power to make you sit through all 142 minutes without for a moment getting bored. And I challenge anyone who has seen it to delete any scene, even any minute, from the final edit. The fact is, you can't. Because every single scene is an essential element that contributes to the final result: a masterpiece that captures the drama of enduring friendship and resiliency of the human spirit more powerfully than any other film ever made. Even those who normally do not watch movies with a critical eye will find themselves so drawn into this experience. I really can't say enough about this film. Suffice it to say that this is certainly the Greatest Movie Not to Win an Oscar.

Both themes of redemption and friendship show greatly throughout the movie. Shawshank Redemption is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.Andy Dufresne, a very clever and mild mannered New England Banker, is convicted of murdering his wife and her secret lover and is sent to jail. Despised at first by other inmates, he is quite and keeps his business to himself. Andy slowly creates a friendship with Red, known for his ability to smuggle things in to the jail, and his gang. Later, Andy also forms a friendship with the guards by assisting them with financial help and is rewarded with protection from the rougher convicts. To add even more exitement  to the plot, the Prison Warden takes advantage of his banking knowledge for financial counseling and will go as far as to kill someone to maintain him in the jail, even if there is evidence that he is innocent. Andy is able to preserve his sanity and dignity by using his mental force. His smarts and confidence keep him going and he is able to teach the other prisoners that hope is the ultimate mean of survival.Shawshank Redemption taught me, and I hope everyone who has seen it a great lesson. It taught me that violence will get you nowhere. Instead when you use your brain, and strive to do the best that you can, you will almost always win. Feeling that Shawshank Redemption's rating of R for language and prison violence is not a fair rating and therefore I recommend it to all people 13 and older.

The evidence was circumstantial, but to be fair, there was really no other suspect. He was sent to Shawshank Prison for two life terms. The warden is a sadistic bastard with a Bible. The captain of the guards is at least as brutal, but doesn't pretend with the Bible.A couple of cells down from Andy's is Red (Morgan Freeman), the guy who can get things for you. He has a delivery system set up through the laundry delivery. Apparently the laundry done at the prison is for more than just their own use. Andy and Red become friends, watching each other's backs in the brutal world of the prison.One day Andy overhears Captain Hadley (of the prison guards) bitching about how he inherited $35,000 from his brother's estate, but it will probably be cut to nothing by the IRS. Andy, who had been a banker before his wife was killed, risks his wrath to interrupt his conversation and point out that he could set it up in a trust so the IRS would not get a penny.This begins a new ""career"" for Andy of doing taxes and estate planning for all the guards, and especially for the warden. In fact, he becomes the warden's personal accountant. As a cover, he is assigned to be assistant to the librarian, Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore). Through endless letter-writing to the state comptroller, he eventually gets a $500 grant to refurbish a room to be a real library.

But the fact that the DVD is so unremarkable drags the rating down much lower than the movie deserves. Keep reading and you'll see my reasons.I cannot praise the movie well enough, since it is one of my all time favorites. It tells the story of Andy Defresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who was wrongfully convicted of murder, and spent 19 years in prison for it. During his time, he befriends a pretty, but intellegent, crook (Morgan Freeman), and their bond solidifies as the years grow. Dufresne himself makes a difference in almost all the prisoner's lives, by showing that the cruelty of the prison cannot darken his will and spirit. It is an inspiring movie, it's almost hard to believe that it is based on a Stephen King story. Everything about the movie fits, the acting, the writing, and the entertainment. It is an exceptional movie.Why is it that Warner decided to release this great movie in DVD devoid of quality extras. Next to one theatrical trailer, some totally uninteresting filographies, and a paper-thin photo gallery, there is nothinh else of interest beside the movie itself. There are no commentaries, no featurettes, and no insight from the filmmakers. Basically, everything you would want is not included on the DVD. But worse yet is the packaging. I don't know why Warner thinks that it's a good idea to sell DVDs in those cheap ""Snapper"" cased (The thin cardboard with a plastic frame that 'snaps' on the side), because it will not last long without getting dinged and scratched. As a principle, I refuse to buy movies in ""Snapper"" cases. This was the one exception.If you already have the VHS version, the only real incentive to get the DVD is the anamorphic widescreen transfer, which gives the picture a crisp, clear look. The sound quality is also nicely kicked up, and it's a special benefit to those with surround sound, because it's the next best thing to actually being in the theatre.One of the biggest qualms I have with the standard of DVDs today is that second-rate movies get the 2-disc ""all inclusive"" DVD treatment, while brilliant movies like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" get the minimalist, barren treatment. I am hoping that they will release a special edition DVD sometime in the near future, because this is not the ""definitave edition"" of the movie.

This movie is nothing short of brilliant.  Every single role is perfectly portrayed by each actor, from the leads, with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, all the way down to the smallest supporting roles.  This is NOT your simple everyday prison drama.  It reaches for greater heights of filmaking and even larger themes, such as patience(a theme rarely touched upon in cinema), hope, perseverence, sacrifice, true friendship, and resolve(get busy living or get busy dying).  That's a long list and there's probably more.  Anyway, the basic jist of the story is an accountant(Tim Robbins) gets thrown in prison for murdering his wife and her lover(we don't know whether or not he did it, the camera cuts away as we see him loading his gun).  When he gets to prison, people start realizing that there is something different about him.  The danger and reality of his situation doesn't seem to affect him, it's as if he is separated from his surroundings and has his own island of calm and steady resolve. Interestingly, the film is narrated by a long time inmate(Morgan Freeman) who soon befriends Robbins.  This subtle touch helps add to the mystique of Robbins' character because we never really know who he is, or how he finds the quiet strength and hope deep down inside to keep him mentally apart from the horrifying prison life.  The story spans about 20-30 years, and we are submitted to a variety of plot turns, colorful characters, and most of all, the inescapable duration of time.  This film teaches not only the characters but the audience about patience.  It is long, but it has to be.  It shows us that every painful and seemingly hopeless turn of events only makes the moments of love and bonding sweeter, truly proving that we have to learn pain before we can appreciate pleasure.  The movie is filmed with that in mind: lowpoints and pitfalls followed by small, temporary redemptions.  But on the grand scale, it is all simply setting the scene for one of the greatest endings EVER put on film.  I won't even give a hint as to what happens, but the last twenty minutes of this film are so good, you'll simply sit there in awe as the credits roll.  It is truly that good.  Keep in mind that the ending would never be as sweet had so much pain not been endured before hand.  But oh that last shot, I'll probably never forget it, and neither will you.  Buy this movie now.

32358,A24M2KN27MDEXO,0780623134,bill_the_great,"[10, 11]","When it was released, The Shawshank Redemption quickly faded out of the theater's and although it was considered for several Academy Awards, it was generally regarded as a bomb, a well-made bomb, but a bomb none-the-less.  But, when it was released on video, word-of-mouth and endless showings on cable began to spread the movie like wildfire, and like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, The Shawshank Redemption has become one of the most beloved films in recent memory.The film starts out as a conventional prison drama: Andy Dufresne, a respected banker on the outside, is convicted of a crime he didn't commit and is sentenced to life in prison at a maximum security penitentiary.  From there, we see how Andy interacts in the harsh environment of prison, climbs his way up the ladder of pison politics and how an unlikely friendship develops between him, &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman) and an assorted gang of convicted criminals.  Andy's indomitable spirit brings him through his trials while in prison and leads the film to an incredible conclusion that will have you jumping up and down and running around the room.What was initially billed as the film's greatest detriment, its length, actually turns out to be its greatest asset.  In an era of quick MTV-style editing and jump cuts, The Shawshank Redemption's deliberate pacing helps the audience truly bond with the characters and ultimately when the film's many strands come together for its conclusion, the emotional payoff is vastly more satisfying for the viewer.The only significant problem with the film itself is the DVD that it has been packaged in.  If any film is screaming for a special edition DVD, it is certainly this one.  The &quot;extras&quot; are the trailer, production notes and some stills from the director.  Although the present packaging for the DVD is unacceptable for a film of its quality, I have hope that with the 10-year anniversary of the film's release just a year away, Castle Rock is hard at work rectifying the wrong that happened when this sub-par DVD was released.With that small slight aside, I must conclude by saying that if you haven't seen this film yet, just get the DVD anyway!

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those rare movies.Now, I have come across people who initially resist watching this movie because they don't want to watch a ""prison"" movie.

When hope is all you have left.Two things always stand out to me the most in this movie. The first is having the always outstanding Morgan Freeman eloquently narrate the story along the way. It is a stroke of pure genius, and it adds so much to the movie. The second thing is the musical score. I am a big fan of movie scores, and how much they enhance the story.

32369,AB8J8L6AZHWEM,0780623134,Bradford Van Slooten,"[6, 58]","This film really perplexes me. With the hundreds of people I have interviewed and the thousands of surveys I have sent out to video store customers, who have seen The Shawshank Redemption, I must say, you either love or hate this film. There seems to be no gray area here.There was obviously some disdain, hate, and indifference at the box office in the fall of 1994. Nobody saw it. Nobody cared to see it. According to Variety magazine, this film grossed domestically a total of $28.6 million and only lasted 9 weeks in the national theaters before it was yanked and shelved for good. For those of you keeping score at home that's an average of $3.17 million a week. That's a joke!!Heck, &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; made over $40 million in it's first day of release. According to Variety magazine, &quot;Mission Impossible II&quot; made $63 million in its first day of national release. Now that's firepower at the Box Office and the only true way to prove the artistic value and quality of a motion picture. Furthermore, that's the only way American audiences keep score!Back to Shawshank. I must be the only person who found middle ground with this movie. It's a good movie, but not nearly a great one. There are a lot of flaws, annoying scenes, and very unrealistic occurrences that just unexplainably happen (a few times I almost wanted to get up and walk out).Here are some of the things that are laughable and flawed in The Shawshank Redemption.1.) Would or would a prison NOT keep a convicted murderer felon locked up at all times; especially in the presence of the prison Warden. EVERY scene Andy is in, he never has handcuffs on. Therefore the ending scene would never have taken place.2.) Would someone please explain to me how they where going to get Rita Heyworth snuck into the prison? This happens to be one of the most ridiculous scenes in movie history and very laughable. When I was in the theater there were well deserved sneers and laughs of sarcasm and contempt. This was the movie theater scene when the inmates are watching the Rita Heyworth movie and Andy sneaks in requesting to have Rita Heyworth.3.) The narration is weak and unjustified. Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up holes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist's inner feelings and thought. Here, it conveys somebody (his friend) who is basically telling us what we are witnessing on the screen. It's like listening to a football play by play announcer describing the action on the field. This does not advance our involvement in the film at all.4.) The acting of Tim Robbins is an embarrassment. He's too wooden and stiff. Furthermore, he mumbles too much in his Brando imitation of &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and is barely intelligible.5.) It's hard to believe the prison brutality in this film. I find it hard to believe that the Warden's 'right hand man' Hadley, would terrorize the inmates arbitrarily.Here are some of the good things about this film:1.) It's not a bad story and at times inspirational. The dramatic arc is right on target and there are plot surprises.2.) The pacing by the director is very good. The suspenseful buildup is well timed and the scenes snap in place with good tempo and rhythm.  3.) If you can get by the dry, aloof, and uninspired performance by Robbins, you will really like the acting job by Freeman. This is a well rounded, three-dimensional performance by Freeman and he really saves the film's credibility.4.) The villain is believable and more importantly sinister. We wouldn't expect the prison warden to be the villain, but here he is. It's well written and more importantly, played out realistically.5.) The sound engineering is excellent. Put this movie on a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound System with 14 speakers running at 140 watts with 8 Ohms a peice for the front 5 speakers and 110 watts per channel for your surround speakers into 8 ohms from 20Hz to 20,000Khz with less than 0.07 percent THD and you'll be blown away. Also, try to keep your Digital-to-analog audio converter at 24-bit/96 kHz and your frequency response at (+/- 3 dB): 10 Hz to 100,000KHz to achieve the perfect sound for the DVD's soundtrack.You wouldn't expect a film with plain sets and dull interiors to have exceptional sound, but the sound engineers really pulled off a miracle on this movie.

It had it's share of rivals in Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, but I must say with complete humbleness, that this is one of the most underappreciated, underrated, and best films of the modern era of motion pictures.  I think the reason why the movie did little box office was the very odd title of the film and the fact that it is a film about prison.The story written by the horror master, Stephen King, shapes a unique and compelling story with many surprise twists including an ending that shocks and completely catches you off guard.  I read his short story on this movie in his novella, ""Different Seasons"" and King, a master at creating complex characters, reaches out and develops the two main protagonists extremely well.I can't see how a normal and sensible person cannot like this film.  It has everything: great story line, likable characters, a truly evil sinister antagonist, and surprise elements along the way.The movie is so well crafted that you feel you are eavesdropping on the main characters all the time.  For example, when Red finds Andy's treasure and personal note at the end of the film, Red opens up an envelope with a huge amount of cash and looks around as if someone is eavesdropping on him.  It's a poignant yet funny moment that takes the edge off of his discover.See this film.

That movie is called Woman in Red.  Now, which one sounds more interesting to you?Meanwhile, back in prison, the two gentleman played by Morgan Freeman (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) and Tim Robbins (Cadillac Man) plan to break out of jail, but their plans are doomed.  That part starts to get interesting, until you realize that this is just another way that Hollywood glamorizes prison life and why should we be rooting for prisoners to break out of jail anyway?

If so, let me know about it because I don't think I've seen it.After years of being available only on a ho-hum DVD with no extras, ""Shawshank"" finally gets the double-disc treatment.  The movie - in which Tim Robbins plays a convict who, over the course of decades, seeks an elaborate revenge - was a flop when released in 1994. Now it's a popular favorite that holds the No. 2 spot on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 movies. It's just a good, old-fashioned yarn.Unknown screenwriter Frank Darabont adapted Stephen King's short novel, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" into a script that was so sought-after that he was able to demand the right to direct it, and this is an excellent book-to-movie translation. In fact, the few moments when ""Shawshank"" doesn't quite work are when Darabont injects scenes that weren't in the novel - when every tough guy in the prison-yard is struck speechless by the sound of Mozart, for example, or when the elderly prisoner Brooks makes his somewhat tear-jerky re-entry into society.Critics of the movie claim it's often sappy and, at times, maybe so, but it has the kind of sap that makes movies entertaining, it's the kind of earnestness that's just too much trouble to resist.Critics also claim it's too long but, at 142 minutes, I think it's just right. Constant TV broadcasts of the film disguise the fact that this is a story about patience.  Patience tends to chafe against commercial breaks and TNT's habit of using pop-ups to remind you that, say, ""Law & Order"" is coming on next.Patience is also what makes ""Shawshank"" a slow-burning, engrossing fuse for the first two hours, and the final act a series of beautifully timed storytelling explosions - the Raquel Welch poster, the drain, the rain, the shoes, the bank, the final hearing, a box under a rock and one beautiful beach.",4,The kind of movie people go to the movies hoping to see.,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,1979,"['Has', 'been', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'past', '10', 'years', 'wraps', 'up', 'as', 'movingly', 'satisfyingly', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'so', 'let', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'it.After', 'years', 'being', 'available', 'only', 'ho-hum', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Shawshank', 'finally', 'double-disc', 'treatment', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'convict', 'who', 'course', 'decades', 'elaborate', 'revenge', 'was', 'flop', 'when', 'released', '1994', 'Now', 'popular', 'favorite', 'No', '2', 'spot', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', 'Top', '250', 'movies', 'just', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'yarn.Unknown', 'screenwriter', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'adapted', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'novel', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'script', 'was', 'so', 'sought-after', 'was', 'able', 'demand', 'right', 'direct', 'excellent', 'book-to-movie', 'translation', 'fact', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'Shawshank', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'are', 'when', 'Darabont', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'novel', 'when', 'tough', 'guy', 'prison-yard', 'struck', 'speechless', 'sound', 'Mozart', 'example', 'when', 'elderly', 'prisoner', 'Brooks', 'somewhat', 'tear-jerky', 're-entry', 'society.Critics', 'movie', 'claim', 'often', 'sappy', 'times', 'maybe', 'so', 'kind', 'sap', 'movies', 'entertaining', 'kind', 'earnestness', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'resist.Critics', 'also', 'claim', 'too', 'long', '142', 'minutes', 'think', 'just', 'right', 'Constant', 'TV', 'broadcasts', 'film', 'disguise', 'fact', 'story', 'patience', 'Patience', 'chafe', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'TNT', 'habit', 'using', 'pop-ups', 'remind', 'say', 'Law', 'Order', 'coming', 'next.Patience', 'also', 'what', 'Shawshank', 'slow-burning', 'engrossing', 'fuse', 'first', 'two', 'hours', 'final', 'act', 'series', 'beautifully', 'timed', 'storytelling', 'explosions', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'poster', 'drain', 'rain', 'shoes', 'bank', 'final', 'hearing', 'box', 'rock', 'one', 'beautiful', 'beach']",N/A

And that that film comes out and is praised to death despite having either low box office return, unknown stars or an extended length. Well among all the teen gross out comedies, teen romances and just convuluted messy and totally unneccessary films, Shawshank towers over them all.Tim Robbins plays Andy, an intelligent banker who is convicted of killing his wife and lover, he's sent to Shawshank Prison. Despite having rather brutal guards and gay men who keep assaulting him, Andy becomes very likable due to his intelligence. He does the guards tax returns and financial advice, gets a big library rather than the 2 shelves they used to have and in one scene, actually let's people listen to a song from the speakers for the first time. He also befriends Red, a kind of convenience store man who can get anything. Over the course of 20 years, we see Andy and Red going through Shawshank and how to have resilience even at it's worst.All this leads up to one incredibly satisfying ending which benefits from a seemingly long film and great acting, this is a very good film to buy, yes I said buy, don't rent this.

32411,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,0780623134,C. Middleton,"[6, 6]","Once in a while a film emerges that goes beyond the mainstream, though manages to touch many hearts and minds. These films somehow give us hope, inspiration and a reason to carry on despite the obstacles thrown unremittingly across our paths. They show us that the human being is capable of enduring great suffering yet can push through this suffering and shine like never before. The Shawshank Redemption is one such film.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) has been tried and found guilty for the murder of his wife and her lover. His sentence is two life terms and is sent to Shawshank prison to do his time. Andy is innocent though he seems to take this disaster in stride. Andy is an unusual character. He is a man of great intelligence and patience, a man with a basic goodness that shines forth despite the horrors that befall him. He is a man of great humanity and never ever loses hope because he holds fast to those simple aspects in life that define our humanity. In the scene where he risks his life to help the sadistic Captain of the guard (Clancy Brown) by showing him how he can avoid being taxed with his inheritance, all Dufresne asks for in return is two cold beers for each of his ""work associates"". Why does he do such a thing? Red (Morgan Freeman) comes to the conclusion that the act simply made him and his fellow prisoners feel more human. And that's exactly what happened.Morgan Freeman as Red narrates the story about Andy and their relationship with an almost undefinable heart. I truly believe Freeman is one of the best ""voice-overs"" in cinematic history. His resonate and wise voice pulls the viewer into the tale making the story feel real and significant. Freeman makes us listen because what he's saying is true and we hold on to every word because we know we'll learn something. Morgan Freeman is one of our greatest actors.Taken from a novella by Stephen King, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", director and writer, Frank Derabont, also the screenwriter of The Green Mile, ensured the film was carried by the acting and nothing else. The soundtrack is beautiful, but it is Robbins and Freeman, including the entire cast, that makes this film an extraordinary one.As has been written and said many times almost too numerous to mention, The Shawshank Redemption is about hope, it also is about friendship, patience and endurance. In this round, somehow, against all odds to the contrary, good triumphs over evil. And it is done with such flair, elegance and real justice, that most of us coming away from the tale are left almost dumbfounded: how did Andy do it?These are good men in appalling conditions, where most would fall and become part of the evil. Here is a story about a man who holds fast to his integrity, cares about his friends and pushes against unspeakable conditions to, at last, come through to the other side with his humanity in tact.The Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film.",5,When Good Triumphs over Unspeakable Odds,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2934,"['Once', 'while', 'film', 'mainstream', 'manages', 'touch', 'many', 'hearts', 'minds', 'films', 'somehow', 'give', 'hope', 'inspiration', 'reason', 'carry', 'obstacles', 'thrown', 'unremittingly', 'paths', 'show', 'human', 'being', 'capable', 'enduring', 'great', 'suffering', 'yet', 'can', 'push', 'suffering', 'shine', 'never', 'before', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'one', 'such', 'film.Andy', 'Dufresne', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'been', 'tried', 'found', 'guilty', 'murder', 'wife', 'lover', 'sentence', 'two', 'life', 'terms', 'sent', 'Shawshank', 'prison', 'do', 'time', 'Andy', 'innocent', 'take', 'disaster', 'stride', 'Andy', 'unusual', 'character', 'man', 'great', 'intelligence', 'patience', 'man', 'basic', 'goodness', 'forth', 'horrors', 'befall', 'man', 'great', 'humanity', 'never', 'ever', 'hope', 'fast', 'simple', 'aspects', 'life', 'humanity', 'scene', 'where', 'risks', 'life', 'help', 'sadistic', 'Captain', 'guard', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'showing', 'how', 'can', 'avoid', 'being', 'taxed', 'inheritance', 'Dufresne', 'return', 'two', 'cold', 'beers', 'work', 'associates', 'Why', 'do', 'thing', 'Red', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'conclusion', 'act', 'simply', 'made', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'feel', 'more', 'human', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Red', 'story', 'Andy', 'relationship', 'almost', 'undefinable', 'heart', 'truly', 'believe', 'Freeman', 'one', 'best', 'voice-overs', 'cinematic', 'history', 'resonate', 'wise', 'voice', 'viewer', 'tale', 'making', 'story', 'feel', 'real', 'significant', 'Freeman', 'listen', 'what', 'saying', 'true', 'hold', 'word', 'know', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'something', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors.Taken', 'novella', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'director', 'writer', 'Frank', 'Derabont', 'also', 'screenwriter', 'Green', 'Mile', 'ensured', 'film', 'was', 'carried', 'acting', 'nothing', 'else', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'Robbins', 'Freeman', 'including', 'entire', 'cast', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'one.As', 'been', 'written', 'said', 'many', 'times', 'almost', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'hope', 'also', 'friendship', 'patience', 'endurance', 'round', 'somehow', 'odds', 'contrary', 'good', 'triumphs', 'evil', 'done', 'such', 'flair', 'elegance', 'real', 'justice', 'most', 'coming', 'away', 'tale', 'are', 'left', 'almost', 'dumbfounded', 'how', 'did', 'Andy', 'do', 'are', 'good', 'men', 'appalling', 'conditions', 'where', 'most', 'would', 'fall', 'become', 'part', 'evil', 'Here', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'fast', 'integrity', 'friends', 'pushes', 'unspeakable', 'conditions', 'last', 'come', 'other', 'side', 'humanity', 'tact.The', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'remarkable', 'film']",N/A

Any number of the set pieces...Andy's rapes, the teaching and then death of the young inmate, the income tax help, the old con, etc...could have been edited down or, in some cases, eliminated. Morgan Freeman seems to have a lock on roles calling for weary wisdom and humanity. His voice over, it seems to me, continuously punches home messages that don't need to be punched home. His last testimony before the parole board struck me as just more manipulation of the audience. This is no criticism of Freeman, but it is of the script. (If you want to see just how effective Freeman can be, this time as a bad guy, check him out as Fast Black in a movie called Street Smart. He plays a charismatic and vicious pimp.) The whole James Whitmore stuff seemed to me to be padding.On the other hand, the beating of the new inmate quickly established the kind of place the prison was, and did so efficiently and brutally. The atmosphere of the movie was first rate. Tim Robbins was excellent. He was likeable, intelligent and sly. Best of all, in my view, was Bob Gunton as the warden. This guy walked off with every scene he was in, even those he shared with Robbins.The movie was based on two of King's short stories, and it has always felt to me like a short story that's been padded out to make a long novel.

I'm going to use this forum to sing the praises of Morgan Freeman because this film is his greatest accomplishment in an impressive film career.  As good as the ensemble of actors employed here Freeman's Red is the glue that holds the whole enterprise together.  This performance is the difference between a very good film and a great one.  I remember when Siskel and Ebert were doing their Oscar show back in 1995, I can't remember which, but one selected Freeman as best actor and the other picked Tom Hanks for ""Forrest Gump"" the logic being that Freeman had the less showy but no less powerful role while Hanks performed more mannerly.  As time goes on, Freeman's role eclipses Hanks but that's not how the Academy saw it at the time.  This year Freeman is nominated for the Oscar again for his role in ""Million Dollar Baby"".  I hope he gets it.  I watched the Golden Globes and it broke my heart to see Clive Owen beat Freeman for his part in ""Closer"".

32446,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0780623134,Dennis Littrell,"[15, 18]","At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison.  He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win.  (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.)  What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement.  Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone.  Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays.  It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing.  I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy.  I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed.  They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R).  On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon.""  The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect.  You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you.  As most people know, it was adapted  from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.""  Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell.  The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford.  We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears.  If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie.  She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955).  It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs.  Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966).  In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story.  There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself.  Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED.  Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent.  The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie.  The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out.  But never mind.  We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul.  It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement.  It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb.

32449,A5P4JIH5SJH3U,0780623134,D. Ian Crutchley,"[17, 17]","First off, this reviewer regularly rates this movie as his personal favourite of all time. Why only four stars then? Because we are asked to rate the DVD, not the movie, and the criminal lack of DVD extras for one of the best films ever made is shameful. So, film five stars, DVD three - averaging out at 4. Maths lesson over, on with the review.Based on the Stephen King novella ' Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption ' this really has become a modern day classic. Other films have grossed more, and may have a more immediate following, but Shawshank will endure for years, and become another 'Casablanca ' loved by generations to come.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, sent to the maximum security prison of Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover. Played with an under-stated intelligence by Tim Robbins in a career defining turn, and supported by sterling performances from Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, and veteran James Whitmore. Morgan Freeman's work is particularly notable, not just for his performance ( let's face it, the man doesn't know how to give a bad one! ) but also for the fact that his is the voice of the film. His chocolate-rich tones were director Frank Darabont's choice for the voice-over of the film, as if his character Red is talking to us, and explaining the sub-text of the film. Voice overs often dont work ( Blade Runner being a prime example ) but this one does, perfectly.Beginning at a slow pace, the film begins with the brutal de-humanising regime meted out to the 'Fresh Fish' as they begin their incarcaration in Shawshank. I remember suggesting my wife watch the film after I'd seen it, and she, being of a considerably more sensitive nature than me, found the early scenes difficult. If you too find the opening 45 minutes a tad heavy going, stick with it - the reward is worth it.Eventually as we progress through the film, we see how Red's initial suspicion of Andy becomes a deep respect, and eventually a deep friendship, indeed it would be true to say that these two men love each other like brothers by the end. There are a few key scenes that really stick in the memory - the rooftop scene, the opera aria scene, the exam result scene - all of which enable us to begin to like these men, men we probably wouldn't have wanted in our homes before the film, but who we'd happily sit down to dinner with after.The film's true emotional impact of course comes in the final third as we learn the truth about Andy's guilt or otherwise. True to many of King's works, there is a twist in the end which leaves us all stunned, and with a big stupid grin on our faces. The total and utter defeat of the dark forces in the film is accomplished with such applomb that you find yourself rooting for the bad guys  - the prisoners, a bunch of murderers and misfits that two hours earlier you were deeply suspicious of. Indeed the last section of the film plays almost totally without our hero, and remains almost my favourite portion of it. By this time we are crying out for the final fulfilment of our hopes for the characters. It is to Frank Darabont's eternal credit that he accomplishes this in a scene without dialogue, and a sweeping panoramic withdrawl from the characters, leaving us with not a dry eye in the house, and a feel-good glow that lasts for days.... while in [a local store] I noticed this man and wife trying to decide which DVD they would buy to view that evening. I pointed to Shawshank. ""Ever seen this one?""""No""""Trust me"" I said, ""It's the best movie you've never seen."" He bought it, and I like to think I made that man and wife cry, laugh and smile that evening.To conclude, Warner Bros and Castle Rock - SHAME ON YOU! This movie deserves better. The Region 2 version rocks, so get busy, re-package, and give us fans the extras this classic deserves!P.S. The ten-year anniversary edition has righted many wrongs. The film has finally been done justice. I watched it again the other night, and again my eyes welled up at the end. Either I am a wus, or I'm right, or maybe both!

Even though the setting is a prison from the early part of the 20th century, it is one of the most uplifting movie experiences that you will ever have! This is the story about a convicted man (Tim Robbins) who is sent to Shawshank Prison and meets Red (Morgan Freeman)- a man who can get you pretty much anything you desire. This is also a story of hope and what it can do to a man who is locked up for life and how he changes things (and people) while incarcerated. You have to see this film at least twice to appreciate the fine acting done by Robbins and Freeman, and to see how their friendship developes and changes over time. Every actor in this film does an excellant job in their portrayals. The film is directed by Frank Darabont (who also directed The Green Mile) and he has done an awesome job of taking this novella written by Stephen King (yes, that Stephen King!) and turning it into a beautiful and timeless film. The music score is fantastic, perfect for this type of film. I highly recommend this film to everyone who can appreciate a film that has substance, will stick with you long after you've seen it and make you want to watch it again!",5,A 'Must-see' Movie for everyone!,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,1254,"['Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'one', 'movies', 'film', 'buff', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'Even', 'setting', 'prison', 'early', 'part', '20th', 'century', 'one', 'most', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'experiences', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'story', 'convicted', 'man', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'who', 'sent', 'Shawshank', 'Prison', 'meets', 'Red', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'desire', 'also', 'story', 'hope', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'man', 'who', 'locked', 'up', 'life', 'how', 'things', 'people', 'incarcerated', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'least', 'twice', 'appreciate', 'fine', 'acting', 'done', 'Robbins', 'Freeman', 'see', 'how', 'friendship', 'developes', 'changes', 'time', 'actor', 'film', 'excellant', 'job', 'portrayals', 'film', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Green', 'Mile', 'done', 'awesome', 'job', 'taking', 'novella', 'written', 'Stephen', 'King', 'yes', 'Stephen', 'King', 'turning', 'beautiful', 'timeless', 'film', 'music', 'score', 'fantastic', 'perfect', 'type', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'substance', 'will', 'stick', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

It was the main reason I stayed away from THE SHAWHANK REDEMPTION when it made its theatrical run; it was definitely the reason I never caught the film on cable--even after I had heard from countless folks what a fabulous movie it is.  And then recently I stumbled upon it late at night on one of the classic movie channels; the film was well underway, but as soon as I began watching I was hooked.  Subsequently I've seen it several times, rented it, and very much plan to add SHAWSHANK to my DVD collection.  Because--like or no like Robbins--THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one of the best movies of its--or any--era.Here we have a story of patience and persistence--a story of deep friendship and ultimate triumph.  In SHAWSHANK, a New England maximum security prison, as Morgan Freeman's character, Red, laments, ""All a man has is time.""  So it's what you do with that time that measures a man's worth; for (wrongfully) convicted murderer and former banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins), he elects to eat that proverbial elephant, one bite at a time, because, as we eventually learn, he has the discipline and the fortitude to celebrate a victory of almost unthinkable proportions.  Pitted against a corrupt administration and a brutal prison culture, Andy has the patience and the persistence to score a stunning victory; his journey to the film's superb ending is spellbinding.Freeman and (yes, I have to admit) Robbins are spectacular; all of the cast is terrific, but special kudos to Bob Gunton as the sinister warden and the late great James Whitmore as Brooks, an aging lifer suddenly released back into the ""real world""--a place he no longer recognizes, a place he now very much fears.  It may or may not be a coincidence, but the two greatest films to celebrate the indomitable human spirit are both products of the mid-nineties:Cast Awayand THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.

Lets see....1.)  Innocent man sent to jail for crime he did not commit2.)  Crooked guards3.)  Malignant Warden who manipulates prisoners and the system4.)  Saintly fellow convicts who spout metaphysical wisdom like Grandpa on Walton's mountain.5.)  Edgy violence when hero is attacked by fellow inmates (supposed to show the terror of everyman).6.)  Hero appears to be co-opted by the system but then tiumphs  with a semi-spiritual redemption leading to the come-uppence of his tormentors.That pretty much sums up the plot of Shawshank, nothing but a formula picture that you have seen before.

32479,A3L2U581LL17EB,0780623134,Eric,"[6, 6]","For me, The Shawshank Redemption and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, two movies which have virtually nothing in common, have forever been ingrained as my favorite films of all-time. The reason: both films represent the reasons why I watch movies in the first place. In The Last Crusade's case, it's plain and simple fun escapism, and never has Hollywood movie magic achieved the rousing exhilaration that the third Indy movie has done for me.Then there's the other, more complex reason I see movies, to be enlightened, thought-provoked, challenged, and inspired, all of which The Shawshank Redemption accomplishes and more. Back in 1994, I would have thought someone was pulling my leg if they told me a prison drama starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins (the latter of whom I had never even heard of at the time) would endure as one of the most popular films ever. Now, I'm just kicking myself for never having seen the film in theaters.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a banker who's been sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. His first year is in 1947, and from this point on, we're introduced to several other characters and situations over the many years that pass, Dufresne's developing friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), and his becoming a mentor to a hotheaded thief (Gil Bellows), all of which culminate to a masterful conclusion which sharply delivers the film's message.What is that message, you might ask? Why, it's all about hope, about what we do with our lives. To most, living is hell, a harsh reality that involves pain and endurance. But if we take charge of our very own existence, appreciate everything we have and can accomplish, then the very process of living can be wonderful. Even the most cynical people I know still love this movie, a grand statement for just how powerfully effective it is. The plot may not sound interesting to the unitiated (take my word for it, I first saw this film when I was a 14-year old with the attention span of a fly, and the movie still gripped me like no other), but it fits perfectly with the themes at work, and much of the dialogue is so beautifully written, the film simply demands repeat viewings to gather it all.Frank Darabont adapted the script from Stephen King's novella, keeping much of the storylines and dialogue verbatim, while making a few crucial changes, for the better, believe it or not. Darabont's direction is equally as terrific, keeping things low-key and seemingly unexceptional, but truly crafting something memorable and brilliant. Thomas Newman's remarkable score is emotionally touching and uplifting, perfectly fitting with the movie's tone.But great as the direction and writing may be, what puts this over the top for me are the performances. Everyone here is excellent, without the slightest minor exception. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver the best, most powerful performance of their careers in crafting two of the most memorable characters in cinema, with the former proving why he's the greatest actor around and the latter showing why he's one of the more underrated performers. The film is primarily about the friendship between Dufresne and Red, how a man can bring hope to a cynic in even a place as confined as Shawshank Penitentiary. In supporting turns, James Whitmore and William Sadler are exceptional as prisoners who befriend Dufresne. Sadler, in particular, begins the film as a total ass, and it's to his credit that by the end, his transformation to a genuinely likeable character is entirely believable. Even Gil Bellows is excellent here, and anyone who's seen Ally Mcbeal knows he typically defines bland.The Shawshank Redemption's ending is, quite simply, fabulous. Everything about the final half-hour is perfect, from the big surprise twist to the pacing to the music to the acting right down to the very final scene. I'm probably sounding a bit repetitive by now, but everything about the conclusion (much as the rest of the film) is pure genius. There are flaws in The Shawshank Redemption, most particularly why Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown never appear to age over the years that go by, but such a minor mistake isn't even worth muttering to the overwhelmingly positive attributes the film bears. The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect film, and I'm absolutely certain nothing will ever match it, much less surpass it.",5,A movie that makes me want to be a better person.,1066262400,"10 16, 2003",2003,4405,"['Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'two', 'movies', 'have', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'common', 'have', 'forever', 'been', 'ingrained', 'favorite', 'films', 'all-time', 'reason', 'films', 'represent', 'reasons', 'why', 'watch', 'movies', 'first', 'place', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'case', 'plain', 'simple', 'fun', 'escapism', 'never', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'magic', 'achieved', 'rousing', 'exhilaration', 'third', 'Indy', 'movie', 'done', 'me.Then', 'other', 'more', 'complex', 'reason', 'see', 'movies', 'be', 'enlightened', 'thought-provoked', 'challenged', 'inspired', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'accomplishes', 'more', 'Back', '1994', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'someone', 'was', 'pulling', 'leg', 'told', 'prison', 'drama', 'starring', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'latter', 'whom', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'time', 'would', 'endure', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'films', 'ever', 'Now', ""'m"", 'just', 'kicking', 'never', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'theaters.Tim', 'Robbins', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'banker', 'who', 'been', 'sentenced', 'consecutive', 'life', 'terms', 'prison', 'murder', 'wife', 'lover', 'first', 'year', '1947', 'point', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'situations', 'many', 'years', 'pass', 'Dufresne', 'developing', 'friendship', 'Red', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'becoming', 'mentor', 'hotheaded', 'thief', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'culminate', 'masterful', 'conclusion', 'sharply', 'film', 'message.What', 'message', 'might', 'ask', 'Why', 'hope', 'what', 'do', 'lives', 'most', 'living', 'hell', 'harsh', 'reality', 'pain', 'endurance', 'take', 'charge', 'very', 'own', 'existence', 'appreciate', 'everything', 'have', 'can', 'accomplish', 'then', 'very', 'process', 'living', 'can', 'be', 'wonderful', 'Even', 'most', 'cynical', 'people', 'know', 'still', 'love', 'movie', 'grand', 'statement', 'just', 'how', 'powerfully', 'effective', 'plot', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'interesting', 'unitiated', 'take', 'word', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', '14-year', 'old', 'attention', 'span', 'fly', 'movie', 'still', 'gripped', 'other', 'perfectly', 'themes', 'work', 'much', 'dialogue', 'so', 'beautifully', 'written', 'film', 'simply', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'gather', 'all.Frank', 'Darabont', 'adapted', 'script', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'keeping', 'much', 'storylines', 'dialogue', 'verbatim', 'making', 'few', 'crucial', 'changes', 'better', 'believe', 'not', 'Darabont', 'direction', 'equally', 'terrific', 'keeping', 'things', 'low-key', 'seemingly', 'unexceptional', 'truly', 'crafting', 'something', 'memorable', 'brilliant', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'remarkable', 'score', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'uplifting', 'perfectly', 'fitting', 'movie', 'tone.But', 'great', 'direction', 'writing', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'top', 'are', 'performances', 'Everyone', 'here', 'excellent', 'slightest', 'minor', 'exception', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'deliver', 'best', 'most', 'powerful', 'performance', 'careers', 'crafting', 'two', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'cinema', 'former', 'proving', 'why', 'greatest', 'actor', 'latter', 'showing', 'why', 'one', 'more', 'underrated', 'performers', 'film', 'primarily', 'friendship', 'Dufresne', 'Red', 'how', 'man', 'can', 'bring', 'hope', 'cynic', 'even', 'place', 'as', 'confined', 'Shawshank', 'Penitentiary', 'supporting', 'turns', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'William', 'Sadler', 'are', 'exceptional', 'prisoners', 'who', 'befriend', 'Dufresne', 'Sadler', 'particular', 'film', 'total', 'ass', 'credit', 'end', 'transformation', 'genuinely', 'likeable', 'character', 'entirely', 'believable', 'Even', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'excellent', 'here', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Ally', 'Mcbeal', 'typically', 'bland.The', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'ending', 'quite', 'simply', 'fabulous', 'Everything', 'final', 'half-hour', 'perfect', 'big', 'surprise', 'twist', 'pacing', 'music', 'acting', 'right', 'down', 'very', 'final', 'scene', ""'m"", 'probably', 'sounding', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'now', 'everything', 'conclusion', 'much', 'rest', 'film', 'pure', 'genius', 'are', 'flaws', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'most', 'particularly', 'why', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'never', 'appear', 'age', 'years', 'go', 'minor', 'mistake', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'muttering', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'film', 'bears', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'perfect', 'film', ""'m"", 'absolutely', 'certain', 'nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'match', 'much', 'less', 'surpass']",N/A

It was nominated for seven Oscars in 1995 including best  picture, but it came up empty, trodden under by the Gump stampede.Frank  Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's short story was a thing of beauty.  The story of an banker who thinks his way out of a maximum-security prison,  and survives on sheer intelligence, guile and will is expertly spun and  engrossing.  The ending is uplifting and exhilarating.Both Tim Robbins  and Morgan Freeman gave career performances.  Robbins was outstanding in  the portrayal of a character whose phlegmatic and understated persona  belied his cunning and razor sharp intellect.  Freeman was also fantastic  as the old convict who knew how to get things done in the joint.  Freeman's  performance got him a Best Actor nomination in a year when Tom Hanks was a  cinch.Everything about this film was superlative.  The direction, the  cinematography, the sound and the music were all top flight.  It is  difficult to comprehend how such an accomplished film was left with so  little acclaim.I rated this film a 10/10.

Whether it was the lack of a catchy title, or the rather bland movie poster showing Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the true spirit of this film never got the attention it deserved at it's big-screen opening.  For this, I'm guilty, too.  I showed no interest in it when it opened.  Never have I been so wrong in judging a movie.  The motion picture awards institutions were wrong in not properly recognizing this film as possibly the greatest of all time.  I never expected a prison film to be my all-time favorite.It was two precious years before my brother convinced me to see it.  I must say, no film has ever driven me to tears like this one did.  It is a compelling story of the strength of human character, emerging from the most hopeless of situations.  As it turns out, hope is exactly what empowers the prisoners of Shawshank.(Spoiler ahead!) The cinematography and musical score are magical, especially in the scene where Red is dropped off in Buxton to search the fields for Andy's stash, and where he finally reunites with Andy in Mexico.  It just streams with emotion.  The script: superbly written.  All this was put together by a talented director who can go to his grave knowing he orchestrated one of the finest films in history.  Of course, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown and other supporting cast members deserve much credit for the emotion they put into their respective characters.If you are one of the unfortunate people who haven't seen this film, you're missing out, big time.

It was a fine, fine movie and for under four dollars! I'm amazed that this didn't get a Best Picture Academy Award, it's that good. Okay, it was nominated for seven awards. Does  that tell you something?Well, what can I say? Five stars! Alas, this one already has over a thousand Amazon reviews and a lot of them are very well done! I'd just like to add a few of my impressions and suggest you read some of the very fine top reviews. The direction, the photography and sound and the flow of the story were all first rate. No question. The acting was excellent across the board and throughout the movie. I felt that I was in a very real and very menacing situation and these were real people. It wasn't an action movie or anything like that, but what action there was gripped your attention. No boredom here!The story involved Andy (Tim Robbins), who was wrongly convicted of the double murder of his wife and her lover and was given a double-life prison sentence. He ended up in the Shawshhank State Prison of Maine. There he met long-teerm resident ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman) and they very gradually developed a deep friendship over the next several decades. The movie documents their friendship and the brutality, meaninglessness and boredom of prison life. Some of the prisoners come off rather badly, as might be expected. The guards and prison administration fare much worse. The whole place is just a very slowly unfolding nightmare. Finally, after enduring decades of this depraved life, Andy manages a very clever escape. ""Red"" rejoins him on the outside deep in Mexico after he is paroled. It's the only bright spot in the movie and may put a few tears in your eyes.The plot was extremely well done and carried out with only one exception. The last ten minutes, after Andy had escaped prison, was glossed over to an extreme degree. It made no difference to the story, and I wouldn't suggest changing it. That little ending part of the movie just doesn't fit well with the preceding flow.

Sometimes, however, something truly deserving works its way into the public consciousness.  The now massive popularity of 'The Shawshank Redemption' proves that the supposed biases of the typical film viewer aren't as set in stone as idiot executives and critics would have you believe.  This film is all about character and relationships, and it's rather long and has no action or sex appeal (no female characters at all, really) in it.  However, the strong human connection that is possible in film comes through here better than in just about any other film I've ever seen, and it seems like plenty of other people feel the same way.The film centers on two characters, Red and Andy Dufresne, both lifers, convicted murderers, in Shawshank prison.  These guys are played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, respectively, and the two great actors give the best performances that I've seen from either of them.  No one else has too huge of a role, but everyone is certainly believable enough, and the minor characters have enough quirks and strange things about them to make them interesting with out turning them into caricatures. (Well Bob Gunton's Norton is perhaps a bit too villainous to be utterly believable, but it's just a little bit too much.)The direction is firm and not at all flashy, save for a few nice establishing shots designed to acquaint us with the prison.  I typically like my movies to be flashy, but that isn't necessary here, and would probably prove to be distracting.  The score is fairly conventional, but it's also very beautiful and haunting, and a perfect backdrop to the more significant scenes.Both critics and fans of the film accuse it of being 'slow', but I don't really agree.  This movie doesn't even really have a plot to it, and thus can't really be fast or slow.  It doesn't seem to be building to anything, though this impression is, of course, proven wrong.  This film is just about the characters' lives, and it's largely just a series of individual episodes narrated and commented on by Red's character where we learn about the mysterious, untouchable Andy and how his stoic character effects those around him.  Thus, pretty much every scene is important, in its way.It also deserves particular credit for the remarkably good adaptation.  The Stephen King novella that this is based on is good, but hardly transcendent.  It also covers a longer period of time and contains fairly few specific details and virtually no minor characters.  They manage to both condense and bolster the material, combining characters and creating new ones and just solidifying a tale that was remarkably formless and free flowing, all while remaining quite faithful to the source material.  Furthermore, the screenwriter had a particularly good eye for the most memorable lines of the novella and finds a way to include all of them in the film.Again, this is a film that relies on human interest and is fundamentally a feel-good kinda film, in spite of the fact that almost everything that happens in this film is bad.  Of course, this is probably why it works with so many people.  A film that talks about how wonderful life is unlikely to make anyone feel good about themselves if they think about it too much.  Thematically it is simple, just saying that happiness come form within, and how we have to find joy in little things and always cling to hope and so on.  Again, simple stuff, but absolutely true and I've never heard anything truly profound in a movie anyway.  The best you can hope for with thematic effect in a films comes from making you remember and believe what you already knew, again.  (Interestingly enough, the film in recent memory which  is most effective on this level is `28 Days Later'.  Lotsa people didn't seem to notice that, as that isn't what you're looking for in a horror movie, but it's there if you want it, and makes that into a truly great film. I know I'm getting off topic, but I really like to promote that film.)Needless to say, there are gonna be plenty of people out there who are sufficiently cynical and that it won't be able to affect them, and the generally episode driven drama will probably be insufficient to hold your interest if you can't feel for the characters.  If you're this kinda person you need not bother with this film.  But, on the other hand, I'm a fairly bitter and cynical person myself, yet I love this movie and am moved by the more effective scenes every time even after about 10 or so viewings over a decade.

No. He subtly  works his magical patience and resolve over a span of many years and  delivers to other memorable characters and to us, the one thing we all need  to know exists....hope.One of my first favorite scenes is when Andy  outwits a guard on a blazing hot rooftop for a few icy cold beers for  himself and other prisoners.

32530,A1GBMGSDDG7BFL,0780623134,James Crouch,"[103, 109]","Every so often, a certain type of movie comes along that deeply moves anyone who watches it. This movie is grand in scope and scale, its character portrayals so moving and so real, that you cannot help becoming completely engrossed by it. I believe that the Shawshank Redemption is one of these movies. Often times, movies based on books are sub par, with the common complaint being, &quot;The book is better.&quot; Well I, for one, have read the book and watched the movie, and I assure you that the movie is not a let down at all, but rather a triumph of modern cinema. The DVD disc itself is a little thin on features, but at an average price of about $15, anyone with a DVD player and a taste for Drama(or anyone who simply likes excellent movies) should own this movie on DVD.  Now, on to the movie itself. The Shawshank Redemption saw career-defining performances from many of its cast members,including Tim Robbins, who became a top star after his incredible performance, and Morgan Freeman, who added to his already impressive list of accolades with his perfect supporting role. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a Maine banker who is unjustly convicted of killing his wife and her lover after he discovers that she is having an affair. Andy is a true outsider in the bleak world of Shawshank prison, an educated man not used to violence and despair that are an everyday part of prison life. Robbins plays this part to perfection, showing emotional vulnerability, as well as the stregnth to overcome the greatest adversity. Freeman plays Red, &quot;The man who can get it all,&quot; a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder, who befriends Andy. Red adapts to his life in prison by becoming a source for bringing outside goods to prisoners.  The interplay between Robbins and Freeman is one of the highlights of the movie, as these two wonderful actors test each other's limits. James Whitmore plays Brooks Hatlin, a man who spends his entire life in Shawshank as a librarian. Once released,as an old man, Brooks finds that he would rather die that live another day in a unfamiliar world. His character is a tragic example of how the human mind can become so attached to its circumstances(even the blak setting of a prison) that it simply cannot let go of them. Bob Gunton takes a memorable turn as Bible-quoting Warden Samuel Norton, whose facade of morality is merely a mask for his depraved behavior and illegal activites.  Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay and directed this movie,is a master of skilfully portraying human emotions. He deserves all the credit he gets for helping to shape this memorable movie experience.

In the case of Oscar Schindler, he used  the corrupt NAZI government system to save lives.  In the Shawshank  Redemption, banker Tim Robbins (Andy) is convicted of a double-murder --  killings that he did not commit.Tim Robbins (Andy) realizes that  bucking the system will only get him hurt.  So, Tim Robbins decides to use  his time constructively.  That is, instead of rocking the boat and causing  problems, he uses the corrupt and brutal prison system to his benefit.Eventually, by being the model, helpful prisoner; he earns the trust of  the crooked prison warden and the cruel, brutal jailers. This opens the  door for Robbins's escapeSure, we can focus on Andy's escape from  prison.  However, this is not the point of the film.  The lesson in this  movie is on using time constructively to work within a given system, not  against it. Working against a system gets you branded as a trouble maker, a  ne'er-do-well, a radical; and, eventually, it could get you thrown in jail,  or worse.  You can accomplish more by working within a system -- no matter  how corrupt, cruel, or brutal -- to achieve a desired goal; to make a  difference -- as in the case of Oscar Schinder and Andy.This movie is  definitely worth watching more than one time.  The film does not drag on;  it moves along at a decent pace.  While watching this film, you will see  how Tim Robbins uses the system to his benefit.  Tim Robbins and Morgan  Freeman put on a stellar performance.Good movie. . . .Good Acting. . .  Good Lesson. . .

But, what of those who never get out? Next, the realism of the movie is abeted by its brutality scenes, pictures of which one would rather deny. One would also assume in 2008, the likelihood of such a scheme succeeeding would be next to impossible.Yet,  reports of 3 million incarcerations at present in the USA makes one wonder.

He is loading it while sitting outside the house where his wife is in bed with the local golf pro.  He claims that he sobered up and drove home and threw his gun into the river and didn't do anything.  Andy (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her boyfriend.  The evidence is not strong but he is still convicted to a double life sentence to be served sequentially.  They declare the act a horrific crime as the victims were shot 8 times and he had to reload the gun to do that and shoot them in the head.As he arrives to prison he is on a bus and the entire prison population is in the yard taunting those on the bus.  The prisoners are betting on which of the new comers will break down first.  The captain of the guards is Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) and he is tough on the prisoners and the warden, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) is religious but he believes in punishment and lets Byron have his way in dealing out pain.Andy becomes friends with Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) who is the main smuggler for the inmates to get them contraband items.  Andy wants a small rock hammer to hand make a stone chess set and he also wants a poster of Rita Hayworth for his wall.  Andy is a quiet man but he has a fire that burns within him, an intelligent mind and he has a plan.....This is simply the best conversion of a Stephen King novel to a movie that has been done.  The movie is also one of my all-time favorites as the storyline, directing and especially the acting is superb.  This little known movie should have won academy awards but it did not win any even though it was nominated for 7.  It is one of Morgan Freeman's and Tim Robbins best roles.

Well, remember that time you first discovered you thought little Jennifer or Emily was kind of.....cute? The other boys would pick on her and call her a kootie-face but you stood up for her, ever though it meant envoking the wrath of every guy-friend you had during that time.  Well, years later, when little Jenny or Emily grew up and became a complete hottie and she didn't forget the way you took up for you? Remember the feeling you had when everyday she passed you in the halls and gave you the smile that she saved only for you?

Yes, this is one of those yummy films.In it, we can feel the complete desperation of Andy Dufresne(played perfectly by Tim Robbins) and we can see deep into his heart, witnessing his pain, his agony, and helplessness. Just about the time when we feel all's lost for poor Andy, we get to take one of the sweetest breaths of fresh air that a movie has ever handed out.  It's just plain tastey!The plot is the stuff of Pulitzer Prizes. Dufresne is accused of killing his wife, thrown in jail for life, and forced to deal with a group of corrupt guards, a gang of rape-minded prisoners, and a warden who is the embodiment of evil.  Sound like fun? Believe me, it is.Andy meets up with ""Red"" Redding(played magnificently by Morgan Freeman) and soon the two become very good friends.  After a few years of getting raped and abused by other inmates, Dufresne learns that his special knowledge(bank management) can go a long way in helping him keep from being assaulted anymore.  He helps the guards with their taxes and becomes the warden's assistant, only this means he has to deal with dirty money and soon, a dramatic climax develops.Hands down my favorite movie of all time, The Shawshankk Redemption(first set in the fourties) will leave you standing up in applause by the time the end credits role around.  The cast is electrifying, the plot flawless, and the musical score a complete gem(done handsomely by Thomas Newman).NOTE: How much do I love this film? Tons.

I had rated this film as the best film I had ever seen until I saw The Thin Red Line which is another overlooked film and the only film that in my mind surpasses The Shawshank Redemption.  That these two films were passed over is reason enough to stop even having the academy awards.This film explores many fundamental questions about man's human nature and our society in general.  What is the purpose of our penal system?  How do we cope with adversity?  What is the measure of a man?  What motivates us?  What is beauty?  The list goes on and on.Prison life is harsh.  From the spartan living conditions to sadistic inmates to cruel guards and administrators.  But to me one of the ultimate truths that the film displays is that there is justice in the end for all although it may take a different form for each individual and circumstance.The power of persistence to overcome adversity.  The strength that we gain from each other.  The necessity to risk and challenge our own assumptions.

I loved it so much that I saw it a total of 3 times! I soon after bought the VHS when it was available and now I own the DVD as well.The Shawshank Redemption follows Andy Dufresne who is incorrectly convicted for murdering his wife and the man  she was cheating with. Andy has a hard time upon first entering prison as Bogs, a violent sexual molester often beats him up and rapes him. Andy befriends Red, a man who smuggles contraband for prisoners for money. When the warden finds out that Andy is great with numbers and was a banker before entering prison, he has Bogs paralyzed by Hadley, his main guard, and Andy begins working for Warden Norton. He has Andy create a fake person for which he can make a bank account to put all of his bribes in and money he steals from the prison. When a young man named Tommy enters the prison, he realizes he's previously done time with the man who really killed Andy's wife. Warden Norton will not hear it though as he believes Andy will reveal his scams, so he's sent to solitary confinement for 2 months and Tommy is quickly murdered by Hadley. Andy then decides he's had enough of prison and tries to escape although he and Red have become the best of friends.This movie shows viewers the harsh reality of prison and encourages people to stay away from it.

While movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, Shawshank does the opposite by putting the viewer in a harsh reality with seemingly no escape from it...yet Andy Dufresne manages to find a way.While both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins had some memorable roles before and after this movie, their roles as Red and Andy, respectively, are career-defining roles.  In any time period, one can see those who have thrown in the towel after life has dealt them a harsh hand, while others hold onto boundless optimism in spit of the bad hand life has given them so far.

Although my vote would be for The Shining (a film he hates) I see what he means.  The novella, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, is one of King's ""non-horror"" works.  As such, director Frank Darabont doesn't fall into the trap that almost all other filmmakers do when adapting King's work: ignore characterization for cheap thrills.  One of the things that make Stephen King a great writer (and I mean this) is that his books are about PEOPLE.  He makes us care about the characters, and then we are frightened when they are put in jeopardy.  The movie, The Shawshank Redemption, succeeds because it is all about the characters - who they are, and the journey they take.The story is about an innocent man (Tim Robbins) sentenced to life in prison - well, two life sentences, actually.  He forms a friendship with a fellow-inmate named Red (Morgan Freeman) and uses his own natural resources to create a life for himself.  The film does differ from the source material in several ways.  Ironically, because of the shortness of King's story, more is put-in than taken-out.  The ending is changed slightly, but it works for the screen.  The message of the film (and the book) is that hope springs eternal.  ""Either get busy living or get busy dying.""

Shawshank Redemption is the story of a quiet accountant named Andy Dufrane who is convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. The story takes place in Shawshank prison, where Andy must learn to defend himself from violent guards, and prisoners who take a more-than-friendly interest in him. However, these are only minor points in the plot, which focuses on the development of a unique friendship between Andy and a fellow prisoner named Red. Red is the prison bookie, but he also specializes in bringing in goods from the outside ""for a small fee"". The two first meet when Andy requests an uncommon item: a rock hammer, used to shape precious stones.Some say this movie is long and slowly-paced. I can't say I noticed. Perhaps this movie is slow compared to the average prison movie (which usually involves many murders and large-scale prison riots), but a faster pace would destroy the emotional context of the film. One of the major themes of Shawshank Redemption is ""A man will do almost anything to keep his mind occupied in prison."" That point wouldn't come across in a fast-paced movie.To me, everything about this film is great. It's brilliantly cast, has wonderful characters, and comes with a beautiful score to set the mood.

Overall, it's a good movie.  Definitely entertaining and very uplifting, even made me get teary-eyed sometimes.  But, there are some major problems with it....For one, it's so black and white.  The good guys, though rough on the edges, are still so incredibly good and likable that you are rather unable to imagine them having committed the crimes that they did in order to land in there.  The bad guys are people so stereotyped that it's ridiculous: the hypocritical, vindictive Fundamentalist Christian warden (he even had a freaking southern accent, what's up with that,) the brutal guards who only leave people alone whenever they get something out of it.I think a big problem was the decision to make Andy actually innocent.  If he had actually committed the crime, it could have been a lot better.  It would have been less ""System crushes an innocent man"" and more about the power of redemption.  It could have been like Dostoevsky... I guess they didn't think that people would be able to sympathize with a murderer.  So instead they rely on a crazy coincidence: it just SO HAPPENED that the night Andy was drunk and considering shooting his wife and her lover, they got murdered by someone else!  Wow!  Now THAT is timing!The part that was most ridiculous to me was when they killed Tommy.  Why wouldn't they let Andy get a retrial?  Why did they actually MURDER the kid and not just, like, threaten him or send him to an insane asylum or something?Another part that I found rather dumb was how Andy escaped.  I guessed from day one that he kept that rock hammer in the Bible; it's one of the most cliche stowing places of all time, so why wouldn't they check it during a cell inspection?  Wouldn't they also make sure that nothing was behind a poster?And I'd like to know how a former convict breaking parole could make it to Mexico.  Also, how the heck Andy got a suit to go to the banks in.Still, it's a good enough movie, it's just not a masterpiece.  It's something you should watch if you need a soulful movie.  One of the best scenes is when Andy blasts the duettino ""Sull'aria"" from Le Nozze di Figaro over the prison loudspeakers.  I also like how the ending made all little things throughout the movie completely pull together, almost like a Dickens novel.But overall, I just can't overlook those problems.  Why is it called the Shawshank Redemption if Andy is innocent?  And no one else was redeemed; from day one they were fine, upstanding people--like I said, you had to keep reminding yourselves that they were convicted criminals.  No need for redemption.I mean, don't kid yourselves, guys.

32602,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,0780623134,K. Driscoll,"[2, 2]","It isn't always easy to find the words to describe a great film.  It is just that every ten years or so there is a film that lifts me up and forces me to take a deeper look at some facet of my life, in this case an understanding of value for my own personal freedom.  The Shawshank Redemption feels like a deeply personal film for me.  It gets under my skin and by its conclusion I want to well up like a big baby no matter how many times I've seen it.  I know that other people feel the same way I do about this film but I never approach them to ask why and I only sometimes decide to express a feeling like that in writing, like I am now.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films that reflects something real enough that I can almost empathize with its characters for two hours, at least enough that I find a new respect for the life I have.  After all, no murderer is only that.  He or she is or was a son or daughter to someone; maybe a wife, a husband, a lover, or a best friend to others.  That doesn't make anyone's crimes more or less forgivable, it just provides more than a one-dimensional perspective on such profound character dynamics.  Redemption is a process by which the redeemed find enough comfort in whatever they have or whatever they've done that they can keep going again.  But this is not just a film about some men gaining atonement for their guilt.  It is far more than that; it is about survival and hope and I always feel a little sense of salvation myself every single time I watch it.Directed by frequent Stephen King novel interpreter and outstanding screenwriter Frank Darabont (The Green Mile,The Mist), The Shawshank Redemption is a film that takes place in the late 1940s at Shawshank Prison in Maine.  It follows two prisoners; Ellis Boyd Redding or ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), who has long known of the accountability he has for his crimes and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a quirky banker serving two consecutive life sentences for the murder of his wife and another man, crimes he did not commit.  Andy is easy to root for as both an innocent man and a fish out of water.  His ethics, his honesty, and his moral character are crucial elements to a story taking place in a world of such corruption and guilt.  It is beautiful to watch and Robbins is so compelling.  Freeman truly becomes the redeemed and in the end he can only find his sense of hope and freedom in the ways that an innocent man, perhaps unwittingly, inspired him.This was actually not a huge hit in theaters and I didn't even see it until about three or four years after its initial release in 1994.  It was nominated for seven Oscars but was overlooked due to Forrest Gump, a film I can do without.  All of sudden it seems everyone is coming out of the woodwork to hail the Shawshank Redemption as one of the greatest films of all time.  It is hard to see any film from the last twenty years or so on lists next toCitizen KaneorThe Godfather, but I can't say it troubles me to see this particular film get so much credit.  The movie is emotionally powerful enough that it almost feels like a relative or an old familiar friend up there getting a round of applause and all the credit in the world.

Great story, great characters, great twists, great cast .. Everything can be found in this film. And I don't say that lightly.The story unfolds in 1947 when banker Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment.

After viewing it however, this film spoke to me on a level that I didn't expect at all. I just thought it was going to be a touching story about friendship. Yes, this *is* included, but there is more.Tim Robbins' character epitomizes the type of individual who usually succeeds in life. Not only is he gifted with above average intelligence, but he has an amazing work ethic. Yes, bad things happen to him in the film, but he doesn't let these things slow him down. He keeps going. He realizes that life isn't fair, bad things happen, and that we can either &quot;get busy living, or get busy dying.&quot;It was tremendously sad for me to see what happened to Brooks, the librarian. I for one, do not consider people who choose to do what he did to be &quot;losers,&quot; - a term I hear thrown around by insensitive types whenever the aforementioned subject comes up. But at the same time, I realize that he did make the wrong choice in that it was a total and complete waste. Our lives are a gift that comes with good and bad, but in the end we *do* have the power to make our own destiny. Even if it takes decades of suffering to make it happen.I'm choosing an angle when I recommend this film. My angle is this: there is something to be said for hard work and ingenuity. And if you aren't gifted with ingenuity, then align yourself with someone who is, and put yourself to work for that individual. Sooner or later, your work WILL pay off. Even if it's for an evil warden, as the film so brilliantly depicted. This is a film about choosing life over death.Life is too short to wait around for it to happen. We either &quot;get busy living&quot; or &quot;get busy dying&quot;. I get it now.

At  Shawshank Prison, the cruel warden (Bob Gunton) and guards treat the convicts like animals. Their lives are filled with misery and hopelessness.  Andy's only relief comes from his friendship with fellow inmate, Red (Morgan Freeman), an old-timer who never expects to get out. Andy gradually adjusts to life at Shawshank, working in the warden's office and helping to get a prison library. Resourceful Andy has also been secretly working for years on a wild escape plan.With all the prison cruelty, this is a very painful movie to watch, but it has a hopeful and heartwarming ending. Robbins and Freeman have a great chemistry and are a pleasure to watch. James Whitmore has a small but touching role as a convict who gets released after spending most of his life behind bars.

The masterful way the story is unfolded through a mixture of real time, flashback and narration by Red (Morgan Freeman) keeps you glued to the screen from beginning to end - even after having seen the film several times.  Though I appreciate and acknowledge Tim Robbins' restrained performance as Andy DuFresne and the fact that the supporting cast is consistently outstanding, this is Morgan Freeman's star turn.  His expressive face is always a pleasure to watch.  Every track of Thomas Newman's soundtrack is evocative and haunting.  Several other reviewers have mentioned the shots in the field near Buxton -- you can literally feel the heat shimmer off the screen (subtle background insect sounds here make this scene).  No other movie I've ever seen can touch Shawshank Redemption for consistent excellence and thorough attention to detail.Bottom line:  everyone who took part in the making of this film should feel deeply proud of what they produced, and everyone who wants to feel the power of human hope and friendship should see it.

The storytelling and quality acting make for a winning combination.  The experience is moving, and when you watch it from beginning to end, you'll have something to think about for a while.  Its upbeat message will pull you in all directions, and then eventually bring warmth to your soul.Andy Dufresne is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947, convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  Within two months of his sentence, he meets friends, such as Red, who make up the little prison family that Andy grows accustom to.  Through his experiences, you'll see first-hand the hardships and emotional twists Andy must endure, as he finds himself coming to terms with his former life, and his current situation.The movie approaches the theme of institutionalization with a pinch of dread, as you come to realize how easy it is to succumb to the protective walls prison can bare, if given enough time.  True, the movie is long, but hardly ever drags.  You're always kept thinking, and if anything you'll be entertained, until the rousing climax.  And no movie's ending has ever captivated me as much as this one's has.How anyone could judge this film so harshly baffles me.  It's not special effects driven, and it's no horror flick.

This review of The Shawshank Redemption is specifically about its context in the American Film Institute's Top 100 listing.The first release of the AFI Top 100 came out and while it covered movies through 1996 somehow it did NOT have The Shawshank Redemption on its list. This even though the list had a variety of other movies that even most casual film-watchers would consider far less worthy. I suppose one could launch a wide variety of conspiracy theories about why. Is it because there were practically no females in the entire movie? That in the entire, long 142 minutes of film lines I think we have 3 lines total by a female voice? That can't be true, because Patton was on the AFI list and I'm fairly sure it had NO female speaking role at all. Neither did Platoon, with the exception of a female villager who briefly spoke in Vietnamese.OK, is it the rough prison atmosphere in general? I'd be hard pressed to say that was true. After all, they included A Clockwork Orange which has some pretty foul rape scenes in it. Pulp Fiction had bondage and male-rape scenes. So it's probably not that.But in looking at the original AFI Top 100 listing, pretty much the *only* film which features a key black character is Guess Who's Coming to Dinner which squeaked in at spot #99. That was it. And the portrayal there was extremely banal. I do love the movie, don't get me wrong. But the character was as ""squeaky clean"" as they came. Heck, we had more Native Americans in the AFI Top 100 than we had blacks.So then fast forward ten years, with everyone screaming about some of the choices they'd made with this first listing. Off went Guess Who's. And on came In the Heat of the Night. On came Do the Right Thing which in its wildest dreams didn't have anything even remotely close on the first list. And on came The Shawshank Redemption.Absolutely I feel The Shawshank Redemption *should* have been on the AFI list in the first place. And I'm pleased that it vaulted right into the #72 spot in the new revised listing. But it feels odd the way that it happened. I wish it had always been on the list, and that it hadn't seemingly been part of some of this on-and-off behavior.Still, with that all being said, clearly the movie is incredibly well done and well worth watching.

32634,A3B90F5YX0SU0N,0780623134,L. Johnson,"[11, 12]","The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made.  The acting is incredible, the characters are great, and the story is gripping.  Tim Robbins, who plays the main character, Andy Dufresne, does an incredible  job.  He plays the heroic role of Andy to perfection, gaining the  audience's sympathy and respect, while capturing their hearts with every  step his character takes.  While Robbins is great, though, Morgan Freeman  is the one who steals the show in my eyes.  His narration adds a lot to the  movie, as does his overall portrayal of Ellis ""Red"" Redding.  To think that  he didn't win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor is truly mind-boggling.  Together, Freeman and Robbins have incredible chemistry, and make for one  of the best on-screen duos in recent memory.The story is a great one.  Without giving anything away, I will only say that although this is a  rather lengthy movie (bordering on 2 and a half hours), it is time well  spent.  There are highs and there are lows; there are offensive points,  such as excessive swearing and sexual innuendos, but nothing in the movie  is done without purpose.  As Freeman's character puts it during the movie,  ""prison is no fairy tale.""  When you watch this one to the end, you'll have  an appreciation for the realism that was presented within the film.This  movie isn't just for those who enjoy prison movies; almost everyone who  sees this movie will have an appreciation for it on some level.  The  Shawshank Redemption is a great one, folks; the fact that it didn't win  Best Picture at the Oscars is truly a shame.  If you have managed to avoid  watching this one so far, don't put it off for another day.  Rent it  immediately, give it a watch, and I think that you'll find it difficult to  resist buying it.I would also recommend buying the DVD of this movie if  you have a player to accomodate it.  It is admittedly short on features,  but the picture is incredibly crisp and clear, and the sound comes through  brilliantly.

32637,A3EKLO0WDCM01F,0780623134,L. Wimberley,"[2, 3]","It has been a week since I saw this movie for the first time, and it still has lingered with me.  Very rarely does that happen anymore.  This movie is based off of the novella written by Stephen King (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption).  I am an avid Stephen King reader and fan.  I had read the novella, and very much enjoyed it.Those who read books (especially Stephen King books) know that very rarely, are the movies based on books made correctly.  Very rarely, are the movies based on books enjoyed at the same level as the books, because one cannot simply film a book.  One cannot capture the same feelings, the same depth, the same character development and emotions that a book depicts, and that is why so many movies based on books are dissapointments.  Even more rarely, are the movies based on books considered to be 'just as good as the book'.I have never said this about another movie before in my life, and probably never will again, but the movie version of the 'The Shawshank Redemption' was in fact, 110% better then the book.  Yes, you read that correctly.  The novella itself was very short.  Coming in at around 100 pages, it was an extremely quick read.  I personally felt the movie opened up Red's character more, and made the viewer relate to Andy a little more, and allowed room for more sympathy.After the credits began to roll, I had a lump in my throat and a feeling that just hasn't shook from me in the past week.  Everything about the movie was done... just right.  It was a quiet, gentle, yet harsh and sorrowful movie.  Imagine recieving TWO life sentences for a crime you did not commit.  I can't even comprehend it.  One of the best things about this movie, is the fact that it makes you share these feelings with the characters.  The lonliness, the sorrow, the anger, the hope.Tim Robbins has given one of the finest performances I have ever seen in an American movie.  Morgan Freemans performance and narration are top notch as well.I live in Cleveland Ohio, which is about 50 minutes from Mansfield Ohio.  Mansfield Reformatory was the jail that Shawshank was filmed at.  You can take tours of the enormaous abandoned building that has been standing since the late 1800's.  The building in it of itself is amazing, bursting at the seems with history.  I had taken a tour last summer, before I saw the movie.

It is an excellent movie that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a bank manager who has been convicted of murdering his wife and sent to  serve out a life sentence in Shawshank prison. He quickly meets an inmate  named Red (played by Morgan Freeman) who helps him through some of the  struggles of prison life. Between frequent beatings by the  &quot;Sisters&quot; and isolation, Andy Dufresne makes it his will to  survive. This movie isn't so much about prison life as it is about life in  general, which is what makes it so good.The screenplay was  well-written, based upon the Stephen King novella &quot;Rita Hayworth and  the Shawshank Redemption&quot;. In my opinion (some people will disagree)  in this particular case, the movie is better than the book. The story is  slowly laid out before the viewer and certain incidents are introduced  throughout the movie that show the integrity of Andy Dufresne as well as  his ingenuity (i.e. doing taxes for the prison guards). It helps if you pay  attention to every little detail since they all collectively contribute to  the turning point or climax.Without a doubt, the best part of the movie  is the climax, which occurs near the end. I was totally taken away by what  was revealed and I hadn't even expected it. You will definitely need to  watch the movie to find out what happens here -- don't let anyone ruin it  for you by telling you ahead of time.Overall, with the great story,  good casting and acting, and an interesting soundtrack, the Shawshank  Redemption is a classic movie that should not be missed.

And to a lesser extent, the notion of 'redemption' was also realized by the character, Red, played superbly by actor, Morgan Freeman when he remembered the words of his friend, Andy - ""Get busy living, or get busy dying.""Yet, less often did we read about a more troublesome type of 'redemption'. And that was the 'redemption', which was borne of despair and which sent character Brook Hatlen [played admirably by veteran actor James Whitmore] to his death.I've participated in counseling for the elderly; seniors who when faced with loss of purpose, loss of belonging, loss of the ability to remain minimally independent, and who suffer loss of health/spouse/family, etc., the pain of despair sets in.  For many of the elderly, this sense of loss often becomes grave, and it becomes all consuming in the depths of their souls.  Then, many become emotionally tormented because their despair becomes devastating for the human spirit to thrive - at the moment when they acquiesce all 'hope'.Finally, gripped by fear and the pang of loneliness, the desire to 'give up'; to die  becomes both urgent and intense.  And, it is in this context that the character Brook Hatlen [through surrender] found 'redemption' - paradoxically, AFTER he was freed from Shawshank.How tragically sad.Maizie JamesApril 12, 2009",5,Hope vs Despair At SHAWSHANK,1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,1882,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'award', 'winning', 'movie', 'THE', 'SHAWSHANK', 'REDEMPTION.Most', 'reviews', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'Kings', 'short', 'story', 'allow', 'readers', 'glimpse', 'how', 'main', 'character', '[', 'played', 'Tim', 'Robbins', ']', 'eventual', ""'redemption"", 'horrors', 'suffered', 'when', 'convicted', 'then', 'incarcerated', 'twenty', 'years', 'murder', 'did', 'not', 'commit.Many', 'America', 'top', 'movie', 'critics', 'other', 'reviewers', 'point', 'out', 'repeatedly', 'how', 'Robbins', 'character', 'Andy', 'clung', 'hope', 'hope', 'end', 'was', 'dramatically', 'depicted', 'courageous', 'escape', 'lesser', 'extent', 'notion', ""'redemption"", 'was', 'also', 'realized', 'character', 'Red', 'played', 'superbly', 'actor', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'when', 'remembered', 'words', 'friend', 'Andy', 'Get', 'busy', 'living', 'get', 'busy', 'dying', 'Yet', 'less', 'often', 'did', 'read', 'more', 'troublesome', 'type', ""'redemption"", 'was', ""'redemption"", 'was', 'borne', 'despair', 'sent', 'character', 'Brook', 'Hatlen', '[', 'played', 'admirably', 'veteran', 'actor', 'James', 'Whitmore', ']', 'death.I', ""'ve"", 'participated', 'counseling', 'elderly', 'seniors', 'who', 'when', 'faced', 'loss', 'purpose', 'loss', 'belonging', 'loss', 'ability', 'remain', 'minimally', 'independent', 'who', 'suffer', 'loss', 'health/spouse/family', 'etc.', 'pain', 'despair', 'sets', 'many', 'elderly', 'sense', 'loss', 'often', 'grave', 'consuming', 'depths', 'souls', 'Then', 'many', 'become', 'emotionally', 'tormented', 'despair', 'devastating', 'human', 'spirit', 'thrive', 'moment', 'when', 'acquiesce', ""'hope'.Finally"", 'gripped', 'fear', 'pang', 'loneliness', 'desire', ""'give"", 'up', 'die', 'becomes', 'urgent', 'intense', 'context', 'character', 'Brook', 'Hatlen', '[', 'surrender', ']', 'found', ""'redemption"", 'paradoxically', 'AFTER', 'was', 'freed', 'Shawshank.How', 'tragically', 'sad.Maizie', 'JamesApril', '12', '2009']",N/A

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[8, 16]","The Shawshank Redemption has a couple of violent parts in it, and a little bit of rough language, BUT - if that's not an instant disqualifier for you it is also one of the best movies you'll ever see.  I don't agree with those who voted it on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB.COM) the #2 film of all time - ahead of Casablanca and everything but ""The Godfather"", but it's still a dang good thing to watch.Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne is that rarity of a prison inmate - he actually HAS been unjustly sent up river.  To make matters worse, the warden at his prison (Bob Gunten's Warden Samuel Norton) is a sadistic troll of a man.  But Andy has intelligence and patience, and much of the film is about how Andy comes to gain the respect of his fellow inmates as well as the Warden.  Andy is a financial wiz and he makes the Shawshank Prison a money-making enterprise for the Warden.Morgan Freeman is wonderful as Red, a prison ""Lifer"" who carries the weariness of his life matter-of-factly and befriends Andy.  I'd love to tell you the story, but that would detract from the pleasure of discovering it yourself.

The story is compelling, and tells of a man, Andy Dufresne, wrongfully convicted and committed for a murder he did not do, but he uses his intellect and the help of a friend he made in prison to survive and even in some ways thrive within the system. He even goes so far as to be of help to the Warden and various police officers, and helps various prisoners better themselves and find something useful to do while they're stuck within the four walls of the prison.Of course, there are problems to deal with, such as being bullied by a particularly vicious inmate, but so many inmates have come to appreciate Andy so that these men will not tolerate anyone trying to harm him and help him whenever they can. However, he also has to deal with a corrupt Warden who actually destroys his chance to get out of prison when evidence of his innocence is brought up. In the end, Andy has to rely on himself and his intellect along with what he has accomplished in prison to beat the system.This is a solid, stellar film which I cannot recommend enough.

32669,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,0780623134,M. Fields,"[6, 6]","Excellent Picture!  The story revolves not so much around prison life as it does the friendship that developes between Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) and some of the other inmates.  Sort of a woman's movie for guys.  Dufresne has the usual troubles in prison but there's one major item that looms in the air.  He really is innocent.  Robbins gives a good performance here.  He still speaks through his teeth.  You know how he does when he's got a serious scene.  I must comment though.  Morgan Freeman steals almost every scene.  He has developed his craft like an old master.  He is one of todays best actors and I believe he is still very underrated.  He can easily carry a starring role with no problem.  I do wish that Hollywood would stop using him as a second banana.Bob Gunton as the bible toting, evil, crooked warden, Samuel Norton, does an exquisite job with his role.  He is deliciously evil.  You can't wait to see him get what's coming to him.  As evil as he was though, he did have a real fondness for Andy.  As long as Andy didn't cross him things were okay.  Guntons's performance works because he is evil but still adds some good qualities deep inside.  Way deep, deep, deep inside.  Some folks say the movie is too long.  I strongly disagree.  The length is necessary as the story is about the passage of time in prison.  These men are supposed to be ""lifers.""  You can't do that in a half hour of film!The cinematography is beautiful.  As the picture begins, the helicopter shot of the prison passing below along with the scoring is picture perfect.  It's a lovely shot.  The score is beautiful.  My favorite shot is another helicopter shot of Red and Andy after they are released from prison.  Andy tells Red where to find him if he's ever released.  He also tells Red to go to a spot where He's left some money for Red.  He finds the money, breaks parole and buys a bus ticket out of town.  Red arrives to find Andy on the beach trying to restore an old fishing boat.  As the two men lay eyes on each other the music is playing and the shot pulls back further and further.  There is no dialogue here.  Just two old friends embracing each other as the copter shot pulls back further still.  It's as if the intention is not to intrude on this personal, private moment between these old friends.  I have to admit I sometimes watch that scene again and again.Freeman narrates the film.  We are seeing the story through his character's remembrances so it's appropriate.  He does so without being over emotional or sappy.  This film can be watched again and again without it going stale.  There is some prison stereotype behavior but it is easily overlooked in this well acted drama.  Casting was very accurate all the way around.  What a shame that no Oscars were handed over to anyone involved with this film.  Please don't let this one get away.  It's a real gem.  Well directed.

With director/screenwriter Frank Darabont's careful execution, this movie offers us Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in some of their most outstanding film work.  Years later, both actors would win supporting actor Oscars, which can only be inclusive of their work in this film as well.  As far as its length goes, I think Darabont wanted us to experience the time factor of being locked up in a prison, where hope is certainly not on the menu for these doomed gentlemen.  As the movie unfolds, we are treated to some fine characterizations and superb, understated performances.  In addition to the brilliant work from Robbins and Freeman, savor the other performers:  Bob Gunton as Warden Norton, a Bible spouting hypocrite who uses Robbins to become a wealthy man; James Whitmore as Brooks, who after fifty years of incarceration is set free and cannot face life in the outside world; William Sadler as the loud-mouthed but affable prisoner; Clancy Brown as the brutal and vindictive guard; Gil Bellows in his brief but powerful turn as Tommy, whose fate only vilifies the corrupt warden even more.

Based on the story by Stephen King, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is a powerful movie filled with talented actors, a brilliant story, and more.Morgan Freeman, who plays &quot;Red&quot;, narrates the story.  He has been in Shawshank prison for many years for murder.  It starts out like everyday.  Him and the other prisoners would run as soon as they hear the bus bringing in the &quot;new meat&quot;, and make bets on who is going to crack first.  Red bets on Andy, who is played by Tim Robins.  As it turns out, Andy went through the first night without saying a word to anybody.Andy has been confined to Shawshank for being convicted of murder.  Although he maintains his innocence, it seems that nobody believes him, and for that he must serve hard time in the unforgiving prison which is filled with violent guards who are just waiting for an excuse to brutally beat prisoners to death, and a crooked warden who holds the Bible close to him.  Soon, Andy and Red become friends, as Andy does his best to never let his hopes of freedom die.  However, he sure learns that most of the people that enter Shawshank never come out human, and do not know how to handle freedom.  Still, Andy knows in his heart that he will be free someday.This is a terrific film which gives the true meaning of friendship, and what one must go through in order to find the final redemption.  I would've liked it if there were more extras on the DVD, but other than that this is a must-have.  This film is brillantly directed, and the screenplay is outstanding.

This movie is so gripping, so aweome, and it's great. A monumental achievement for Frank Darabont.This movie takes place in the 40's where Andy(Tim Robbins) is charged with the deaths of his wife and the man who was having an affair with her. He gets two life sentences for the crime. He meets up with Red(Morgan Freeman) in prison and the two form a friendship that teaches Red about life and hope. Red is the guy who can get things for people and Andy ask for something a little unusual Rita Haworth. The reason is not clear until later in the movie. Red delivers with a poster of her. The movie reaches its highpoint near the end and I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone that hasn't seen this movie. The ending is awesome. Both actors here deliver their best performances and the director/writer Frank Darabont does an excellent job of adapting the story to screen. (He's a big Steven King fan by the way).

A movie where you don't sit through it and think to yourself how you might have done it all differently had you been  the director. I have a couple of movies like that, and &quot;The Shawshank  Redemption&quot; is one of them. I still remember clearly walking out of  the theater in 1994 and thinking that I've just seen one of the best movies  that I'll ever have the pleasure of sitting through. A movie so elegant and  emotional that is perfect in its way of storytelling. A movie that is about  how hope can never die. The movie earned several Academy Award nominations  that were certainly well-deserved, but it left theaters all too quickly.  Over the years though, it has gained a strong cult following.The movie  stars Tim Robbins in one of his very best performances as Andrew Dufresne,  a quiet man who is convicted of the murder of his wife and is sent to  Shawshank prison. It's there he meets &quot;Red&quot;, a convict played by  Morgan Freeman who gets things from the outside for a price. He first sees  Andy as he's lead into the prison and predicts that he won't last long  inside the prison walls. Over time though, he's suprised that the young man  is able to survive and soon, the two become friends with respect for each  other. Andy is not a man who &quot;fights the system&quot;. He spends his  days in his own quiet world, a courage that the other prisoners don't quite  understand at first. Robbins has built this character in a way that we  the performance is not showy, but subtle. The result is that we want to  know more and when we do begin to understand his ways, that only makes us  want him to succeed that much more. I won't go into much more in the way of  detail about the movie; if you haven't seen it, I don't want to ruin any of  the enjoyment of the movie; if you have, I'm sure you already have your  feelings about the movie. This is a movie that's not depressing; it has a  lot of life to it and I think that when they look back at the 90's, they  will see that this is one of the best pictures that was released during  this time.Yes, Warner Brothers has proven to made an error in judgement  about their way of going about putting this DVD out. There was an  announcement over a year ago, I believe; then previous announcements came  later after the first delay promising a director's commentary, then a  Morgan Freeman commentary, then, in the final moments before the DVD is  released this week...nothing. It's a shame, as &quot;Shawshank&quot; is a  film deserving of much more. I suppose part of me is happy with the fact  that this film is finally on DVD, although if this is the final product,  there is no reason in my mind that this couldn't have been released a long,  is an excellent looking image. One of the best cinematographers in the  business (Roger Deakins- &quot;Fargo&quot;) did the filming on this picture  and the pale colors are represented well throughout the picture, mainly  browns and greys. Like the movie, there is an elegance to the visual style  on this picture that is apparent in every movie that Deakins has worked on.  Images are clear and crisp throughout; sharp, but not overly sharp for a  &quot;smooth&quot; feeling that looks very film-like.There are few  problems, and none of them are terribly distracting at all. There is a  slight shimmering in a scene or two and some very small instances of grain.  Other than that, this is an excellent looking image that will certainly  beautiful sound mix. It's also a newly remastered 5.1 mix. It's not flashy  or showy, nor does it need to be. It does however, do what it needs to do  best very well. The score by Thomas Newman is absolutely wonderful and it  sounds clear and crisp throughout the picture. Surrounds are put into use  occasionally, but always in a subtle way that is right for the picture.  What I was pleased about most though, was how rich and clean the score  sounded on this DVD. Dialogue is clear and without problems as well. Again,  Non-animated main menus that have the score playing in the  dissapointment of this DVD; all that's included is the trailer and some  production  stills.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final  Thoughts Although it's unfortunate that this isn't the special edition that  it should have been it is a must for any collection.

Sent to Shawshank Prison to serve a life sentence, Andy starts out having a hard time and existing only in appearance. That is until he meets Red ( Morgan Freeman)- the man in Shawshank that can get you anything. Andy and Red soon become the best of friends. Andy's demeanour and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look within himself, and the world around him, while Andy proves to all the inmates at Shawshank that hope and determination can get you through even the cruelest of circumstances.Everything about this film, from the directing to the musical score, is absolutely flawless. Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novella &quot; Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot; is absolutely incredible. The adaption is so good, that the film manages to be even better, because the story is too rich to be limited to a 100 page short story, and the film puts it on much grander scale. Darabont really shows how much emotion a musical score can get from the audience. It is one of the best I have ever heard, and it really drives the film. The story itself deals with the concepts of hope and freedom. They are the concepts of humanity which everyone wants, and it gives the film a more personal feel. These concepts are so intricately drawn into the plot, that the audience can't help being drawn in to the film.The actors are do a phenomenal job. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give the performances of their careers. The warden played by Bob Gunton is outstanding because of how well he plays both sides of his character. He claims to be highly religious, but shows his truly dispicable nature at the same time. Great two face character!

This movie has a luster, a shimmering quality that has yet to dim, even after all the times I have watched it.""Redemption"" is a stark look at prison life.  From the brutal discipline of the guards, and the crushing lonliness that each and every prisoner feels.  Andy (A stirring Tim Robbins) is wrongfully convicted of his wifes' and her lover's murder, and is sentenced to life in a prison at Shawshank prison.  There, he befreinds Red (Morgan Freeman at the utmost of his abilities), a black inmate who was convicted of murder back in the '20s, and is one of the few men in Shawshank who will admit he is guilty.  For the first few years, Andy is only stays quiet staying out of the reach of the prisons' homosexual gang, who have their eye on him.  After that threat passes, he comes into his own at the prison.  He revitalizes the prison library, keeps financial records for the warden, and ends up doing the taxes for all the guards in Shawshank.  Later on, he struggles to find the truth to the murder he is convicted of, in light of new evidence brought forth from a new inmate.Andy's story is not the only compelling one in Shawshank.  Morgan Freeman brings a vulnerability and a maturity to his character that  gives it depth and dimension that makes it seem that Red's soul is borne before you eyes, and you know him as if he were yourself.  And the voiceovers that he gives never come off as unnecessary filler.  Instead, they serve to give even more perspective to the movies' themes of freedom lost, despair, helplessness and triumph.I really wish I could say more, but that would make this review seem drawn out and repetitive, and spoil the movie.

That is because the movie is carefully made in detail so that this movie can tolerate being watched over and over again.In 1998, I got to the point where I know who says what at what timing, so I stopped watching it. In other words the movie now exists within me that I don't need to see it. I really digested it, and the Shawshank Redemption became a part of me.

Had anyone else been cast in the role played by Tim Robbins, this otherwise flawless movie would have fallen apart. The perfect look, charisma and acting skill put into this by Robbins makes this entire movie worth while, in itself.It would be unfair of me to explain the plot any further, as this movie is best seen when fresh, and when the viewer is unaware of the turn out, or various surprises that occur throughout the plot.

It's so beautifully written that it does seem like a true story, and i wish it was, but it's not i think. It's too perfect. And that old prison where they filmed this, is allegedly haunted, and the show ghosthunters went there to investiagte paranormal acitivy, and they had the props on display like the hole where andy crawled out, and the room where brooks committed suicide in. And the place actually turned out to have some activity. But back to the film. What i like most about this movie is it captures both sides of prison life, both the bad and good. I guess most people have this notion that prison is all about violence, rape, and assualting day and night. But there is also another side, which is loyalty, friendship, and believe it or not some good times, especially for lifers who come to get use to the place and make friends. The saddest part, well there are two, but it was extremely sad to me when they released brooks. You really understood why he felt the way that he did. No family, no friends, not much understanding of life on the outside in such times, because he was in prison for 50 years. And times change. Not only that, just imagine having to leave your friends, and the life you knew, and being a senior citizen. To me, that was so depressing, especially after he freed his bird who he took care of since it was a baby. I'm sure he felt very homesick to say the least after he was released because that was his home, his life for 50 years. It's like now what? A crap job, and live in some halfway house till the day he died, lonely, and afraid, and sad. That part has always been a tearjerker for me. And the second saddest part, is when the evil warden, had that kid shot because he had information that could free andy. That made me sick, and he had the nerve to talk about God and the bible, and what's right and wrong, and then he has a witness murdered in cold blood. Sadistic, hypocrit SOB. The acting is outstanding, especially tim robbins and morgan freeman. They had that chemistry you dont see too often in films. I can't say enough about this film, and the ending is the best ending to any movie in film history, when andy escapes, and has the information to take the wardens laundered money, and get him busted by the fbi at the same time.

Andy's wife was murdered and he gets convicted of the crime but he cannot remember that night.  It is a high profile case and his conviction makes him a celebrity prisoner (which is not good.)Red takes Andy under his aged wing and shows him the ropes.  They become fast friends. But Red cannot protect Andy and he becomes fresh meat for the prisoners to abuse.  This continues until one day Andy does a favor for a guard and gets his crew a treat.  This endears him to the men.Andy gets assigned to the library.  Then the guards start to see Andy for financial advice, earning him more favors.  When the librarian Brooks (James Whitmore) is paroled, we follow his attempt to adjust to outside life.Andy wants to build a proper library for the prison and after a concert effort the Brook Hatlen Memorial Library is opened.  The warden is impressed by Andy's ingenuity and asks him to help him launder his kickbacks.  This causes a problem when a new inmate tells Andy about his old cellmate that killed a banker's wife and her lover.  The warden cannot let Andy go free.This is a great film about man's humanity under oppression.  Frank Darabont has crafted a masterpiece.  Morgan Freeman received his third Oscar nomination for this film and should have won.  James Whitmore once again shows what a great supporting performance is.  Once again he gets ignored at awards time for more critically favored actors in less demanding roles.  Tim Robbins has the lead role but his character is the one that everything hangs from.DVD EXTRAS: None",5,Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins go to Jail,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,1801,"['Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'non-supernatural', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'great', 'human', 'drama', 'film', 'place', 'Shawshank', 'State', 'Prison', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Ellis', 'Red', 'Redding', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Andy', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'convicted', 'crime', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'night', 'high', 'profile', 'case', 'conviction', 'celebrity', 'prisoner', 'not', 'good', 'Red', 'Andy', 'aged', 'wing', 'ropes', 'become', 'fast', 'friends', 'Red', 'can', 'not', 'protect', 'Andy', 'fresh', 'meat', 'prisoners', 'abuse', 'one', 'day', 'Andy', 'favor', 'guard', 'crew', 'treat', 'men.Andy', 'assigned', 'library', 'Then', 'guards', 'start', 'see', 'Andy', 'financial', 'advice', 'earning', 'more', 'favors', 'When', 'librarian', 'Brooks', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'paroled', 'follow', 'attempt', 'adjust', 'outside', 'life.Andy', 'build', 'proper', 'library', 'prison', 'concert', 'effort', 'Brook', 'Hatlen', 'Memorial', 'Library', 'opened', 'warden', 'impressed', 'Andy', 'ingenuity', 'help', 'launder', 'kickbacks', 'problem', 'when', 'new', 'inmate', 'tells', 'Andy', 'old', 'cellmate', 'killed', 'banker', 'wife', 'lover', 'warden', 'can', 'not', 'let', 'Andy', 'go', 'free.This', 'great', 'film', 'man', 'humanity', 'oppression', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'crafted', 'masterpiece', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'received', 'third', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'great', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Once', 'again', 'ignored', 'awards', 'time', 'more', 'critically', 'favored', 'actors', 'less', 'demanding', 'roles', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'lead', 'role', 'character', 'one', 'everything', 'hangs', 'from.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A
32704,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,0780623134,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[3, 4]","Frank Darabont's classic prison yarn based on a Stephen King novella (that is well worth reading) has only gained its fame retrospectively.  Failing at the box office it has since become a classic among modern movies.  The story has wealthy banker Andy (Robbins) jailed in Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Whilst there he makes friends with Red (Freeman), the 'man who can get things'.This is one of those rare films where the story isn't really at the forefront of the picture.  Rather Darabont takes his time to introduce us to his characters and build up a realistic and touching friendship between the two Shawshank lifers.  This is a movie that tackles with such tricky themes as hope, friendship and freedom of spirit and pulls them all off in spectacular style.  Never resorting to schmaltz or unnecessary violence this hits you in all the right places without ever putting a foot out of place.  In fact, for a prison film this is surprisingly tender, proving once and for all that this is a genre that can have a wide appeal when done right.'The Shawshank Redemption' also benefits from fleshing out the plot of the original novella (which is only just over 100 pages) by drawing out several characters into some genuinely moving storylines.  Of particular notice is a young Gil Bellows (who most will probably recognise as Billy from 'Ally McBeal'), as an aggressive youth who wants to get some qualifications.  There's also the story of the librarian .Of course, what holds the movie together most of all are the performances by the two male leads, who both give the performances of their respective careers.  Whilst never becoming mushy they both act out beautifully the depth of the friendship and the deep desire for freedom to perfection.  .This established Darabont as one of the most exciting new directors around and remains one of the best movies of its genre ever made.

Among my favourite passages in this singular  masterpiece is the sequence of Brooks trying to adjust to life on the  outside, looking for his bird in the park, its one of the most sublimely  moving sequences in film history, and underlies the films central theme ,  which is voiced in a great scene by Freeman &quot;These Walls are funny,  first you hate them, enough times passes, you come to depend on  them.&quot;Meaning in life, people liiving in terrible conditions for a  long enough period of time might actually go back to them voluntarily if  they don't do something about it soon enough.(I did mention that I lose all  elequence, so no apologies).

32708,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,0780623134,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[1, 3]","What can you say about The Shawshank Redemption that hasn't already been said? It must be one of the best loved and indeed greatest films ever made. I do not know anybody that has seen this film that doesn't LOVE it. It really is that superb.Adapted from Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, it tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), an outwardly timid man convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and jailed for life. Arriving at Shawshank prison in 1947, Andy becomes the victim of prison brutality in the early part of his stay but he also befriends another lifer, the prison ""fixer""  named Red (beautifully played by Morgan Freeman) and his buddies. Through his knowledge of taxation and financial transactions he also becomes popular with the prison warden and the guard that runs his brutal regime but Andy also soon realises that in prison life means life and that's what they try to take from him.This is the most beautiful and ultimately uplifting film you could ever hope to see, whilst recognising the traditional conventions of prison drama (such as brutality and rape), it is really a film that demonstrates that the human spirit can overcome brutality with faith, friendship (and a rock hammer). This is as close to the perfect film as you will ever get. It is perfectly cast from the leads Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, who give wonderfully understated performances to the supporting cast of Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Bob Gunton and Gil Bellows. It is subtly directed by Frank Darabont who carefully manages to avoid overstatement and oversugaring the cake with sentiment and pathos.The most amazing thing about this film is that although it was nominated for seven academy awards in 1994 it didn't win any (they were dominated by Forrest Gump) and it is described in Leonard Matlin's film guide as ""terribly overlong"", ""hollow and predictable"". How wrong could you be?

The film also briefly follows the experiences of other prisoners, representing the unfair treatment some recieve whilst in prison, cleverly allowing the film to expand on other issues apart from friendship.Although the film unfolds at a slow pace, we are justly rewarded for our patience near the end when the film throws up one of the greatest twists in film history (don't worry I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it!) which makes the film worth watching for this part alone.The Shawshank Redemption is successful (like so many other films and stories) because it focuses so well on the theme of friendship. When watching the film you long for yourself to have a friendship as strong and trusting as Andy and Ellis' to the point where one could say that you yourself would like to be in that prison (but do not be mistaken to think that the whole film glamourises prison, it can sometimes quite the opposite as some of the brtual and shocking scenes show).However, and contrary to what many people say, the Shawshank Redemption is not an all-out masterpiece.

But for my money, I have never seen a movie that transcends the greatness of this one.If you want great performances, The Shawshank Redemption has them in spades: Tim Robbins, Moragan Freeman, and the always excellent Clancy Brown do some of their best work here. The rest of the supporting cast does likewise (especially that Miracle-Gro guy who plays Brooks).If you want screenwriting, you cannot top Darabont's script. He turns a somewhat over-long and dreary novella by Stephen King into a hymn to hope and a contemplation of the meaning of freedom. I especially love the joke about why Morgan Freeman's character is called Red (you need to have read the story to fully get it).If you want cinematography on a grand and sweeping scale, look no further. From the opening fly-over of the dreary prison grounds to the warm light of the field in buxton, to the final beauty of the pacific coastline--this movie has it all. Thomas Newman's score is the perfect complement to the action and the scenery.The story of Andy Dufresne as it is told in this movie is the story of an inner journey to freedom.

But to my mind, the Shawshank Redemption never rises above simply ""satisfactory"".With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at the helm, it was always going to be a worthy sort of picture. Alas, it scores worthiness points in that numb-skulled Hollywood way, by painting the moral world in black and white. The characters are either completely virtuous, or they're thoroughly nasty. That makes the moral lesson easy to preach, but also completely undermines it, because we know the real world just isn't like that. Well, mine isn't, anyway.To wit: the prison gang into which wrongly convicted (of course - but how much better would the picture have been had he actually done it?) Andy Du Fresne falls - lifers, all - comprises only genuinely nice, decent, hard working, obedient folk.Freeman's character, Red, is an avuncular figure not a million miles from B. B. King, but who is continually, inexplicably, rejected for parole by the nasty white folk. He accepts his lot without complaint (but when he finally does speak his mind, he gets released!) Old timer Brooks (equally avuncular, but this time not a million miles from namesake Mel) is eventually paroled, but he doesn't want to leave his home of 50 years, and when pushed out in to the cruel modern world ... well, I don't want to give anything away. But it isn't hard to guess.The remainder of the moral lessons are the standard Hollywood fare; it's a film that attempts the epic sweep of The Dead Poets' Society, without the lyricism (but, to its credit, also without Robin Williams) and attempts to portray the brutal life of prison, without the brutality of say Sleepers.The hook line ""you get busy livin', or you get busy dyin'!"" is pure schmaltz, and I'm surprised Robbins didn't refuse point blank to deliver it. And if that wasn't bad enough, then Freeman reprises the line (only tacking on  ""that's goddamn right!"") as the credits roll. Ugh.And just for those who hadn't picked it up from watching the film (or reading its title), the director helpfully gushes ""it's all about redemption!"" in a fairly unenlightening accompanying documentary.The resolution of the film may be predictable, but the manner of its arrival is nicely engineered: well plotted, Stephen King.And as for ending up in Zihuatanejo - great call; it's a truly beautiful place - I once went there. It's just a pity the film crew didn't. Zihuatanejo is snuggled amongst some hills in a pretty little inlet, about a hundred miles west of Acapulco. Lord only knows, then, why they filmed the final shot on an outwardly curving ocean beach, which could be anywhere on the planet BUT Zihuatanejo...",3,Never rises above the hollywood platitudes,1027209600,"07 21, 2002",2002,3047,"['Gees', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'caned', 'saying', 'are', ""n't"", 'I.The', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'always', 'been', 'pegged', 'great', 'movie', 'clearly', 'Amazon.com', 'readership', 'so', 'finally', 'got', 'round', 'seeing', 'last', 'night.It', 'definitely', 'engaging', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'well', 'enough', 'acted', 'quite', 'nicely', 'not', 'little', 'obviously', 'twist', 'was', 'so', 'predictable', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Chubby', 'Checker', 'mind', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'never', 'simply', 'satisfactory', '.With', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'helm', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'worthy', 'sort', 'picture', 'Alas', 'worthiness', 'points', 'numb-skulled', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'painting', 'moral', 'world', 'black', 'white', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'virtuous', ""'re"", 'thoroughly', 'nasty', 'moral', 'lesson', 'easy', 'preach', 'also', 'completely', 'undermines', 'know', 'real', 'world', 'just', ""n't"", 'Well', 'mine', ""n't"", 'anyway.To', 'wit', 'prison', 'gang', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'course', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'would', 'picture', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'actually', 'done', 'Andy', 'Du', 'Fresne', 'lifers', 'comprises', 'only', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'decent', 'hard', 'working', 'obedient', 'folk.Freeman', 'character', 'Red', 'avuncular', 'figure', 'not', 'million', 'miles', 'B', 'B', 'King', 'who', 'continually', 'inexplicably', 'rejected', 'parole', 'nasty', 'white', 'folk', 'lot', 'complaint', 'when', 'finally', 'speak', 'mind', 'released', 'Old', 'timer', 'Brooks', 'equally', 'avuncular', 'time', 'not', 'million', 'miles', 'namesake', 'Mel', 'eventually', 'paroled', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'home', '50', 'years', 'when', 'pushed', 'out', 'cruel', 'modern', 'world', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', ""n't"", 'hard', 'guess.The', 'remainder', 'moral', 'lessons', 'are', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'film', 'epic', 'sweep', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'lyricism', 'credit', 'also', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'attempts', 'portray', 'brutal', 'life', 'prison', 'brutality', 'say', 'Sleepers.The', 'hook', 'line', 'get', 'busy', 'livin', 'get', 'busy', 'dyin', 'pure', 'schmaltz', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Robbins', 'did', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'point', 'blank', 'deliver', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'then', 'Freeman', 'line', 'only', 'tacking', 'goddamn', 'right', 'credits', 'roll', 'Ugh.And', 'just', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'picked', 'up', 'watching', 'film', 'reading', 'title', 'director', 'helpfully', 'redemption', 'fairly', 'unenlightening', 'accompanying', 'documentary.The', 'resolution', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'predictable', 'manner', 'arrival', 'nicely', 'engineered', 'well', 'plotted', 'Stephen', 'King.And', 'ending', 'up', 'Zihuatanejo', 'great', 'call', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'place', 'once', 'went', 'there', 'just', 'pity', 'film', 'crew', 'did', ""n't"", 'Zihuatanejo', 'snuggled', 'amongst', 'hills', 'pretty', 'little', 'inlet', 'hundred', 'miles', 'west', 'Acapulco', 'Lord', 'only', 'then', 'why', 'filmed', 'final', 'shot', 'outwardly', 'curving', 'ocean', 'beach', 'could', 'be', 'anywhere', 'planet', 'BUT', 'Zihuatanejo']",N/A

Seeing as we are all in agreement, I'll be brief.  Frank  Darabont's debut is a masterclass of storytelling.  Nary a single moment is  wasted in the telling of this beautiful story of friendship (Darabont is  good at friendship - see The Green Mile).  Every word, gesture and glance  is ultimately of the greatest importance to the unfolding story, leading to  a totally unforeseen resolution which left the audience I saw it with  gasping.  The friendship portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is  believable and deeply touching, yet somehow avoids the sentiment a lesser  filmmaker would have been unable to resist.

Andy gets beaten up many times in prison by a group of men called the sisters who feel they have to beat him up as he's different in the way he looks, acts, walks and everything at the prison.

He ends up serving a life sentance alongside Red, a sly criminal who can ""get you anything"", and the two develop a several-decade-long friendship. Andy was a smart banker before his arrest and helps the evil warden with his paperwork. Not to give away the plot or anything, but there is some definate LES MISERABLES influence in this movie as well. Not to say that it doesn't stand alone as an original work of wonderful writing and directing. The classic references only enhance the fulfilling story of friendship, faith, hope and perserverence.This is simply a perfect film and will leave you close to tears, if not actually shedding them.

Hansen,"[3, 4]","This outstanding work is coterminous with films like `The Longest Yard' and `Cool Hand Luke' in that it touches upon our ambivalence about prison inmates. It is indicative of the dichotomous view that our society has in regard to the penal system when we can clarion lex talions among our fellow citizens yet identify with and cheer on movie criminals in theatres. Quite possibly it is the underlying threat of being immured ourselves, as we realize that it is really a fine line that keeps us free.Of course it takes more than a play on our hidden fears to produce a film this good. It takes a good script, solid acting and characters that we can give a damn about, all of which are gathered here brilliantly. Above all it takes a good story, and obviously Frank Darabont knew one when he adapted this Stephen King novella into a movie script (you never really can tell what you will end up with when you endeavor to bring one of King's books to the big screen). He also knows how to use a camera to draw us into the prison world and how to exploit the power of narration (assisted nicely by the warm voice and splendid diction of Freeman).SPOLIER ALERT!!!

32777,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,0780623134,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[2, 2]","I've seen 'The Shawshank Redemption' at least a dozen times, and each time it resonates with me for different reasons.  Like the characters in the movie, it seems that this is a film that can grow and change and evolve with the viewer.The first time I saw it, I was one of the few who went to the theatre to see its initial run. The Stephen King novella it was based on, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" was one of my all-time favorites (still is), and I wanted to see how well it was brought to the screen. Despite changes in the story and in some of the characters, I found that Frank Darabont stayed true to the heart of the story, and magnified what made the story such a wonder to read. Simply put, 'The Shawshank Redemption' was the best adaptation of a Stephen King story I had ever seen committed to film, and it remains so today.And beyond that, on its own merits, it is a fine film -- very nearly a perfect film. It stands the test of time, with themes that are universal, characters that come to life immediately, music that strikes a deep emotional chord, images that quicken the heart and move the soul, and words that are familiar, yet new. In other words, this story of men serving lifelong terms in prison, in all its simplicity and unpretentious presentation, becomes something that nearly anyone can identify with...and something that we can all gain a measure of hope from as well.The story opens with Andy Dufresne going to jail for killing his wife and her lover, a crime which he says he did not commit. It is a common premise, one which might (in other movies) lead to an investigation and a story of justice returned or vengeance wrought. And while we do find out the truth of Andy's story in due course, it is not the main thrust of the overall story arc. Andy's story is a part of the larger story at work here, a tale of routine and of struggle and of the possibilities and risks that come with a hope for something better.I've mentioned ""hope"" several times already, and no wonder, as the idea of hope is one of the central themes in 'The Shawshank Redemption.' The idea that, even in the darkest places of the world, there are things that can keep us from madness and despair, and those things are to be found within all of us, as long as we do not lose the will to look for it. If you're thinking like a movie about a Maine prison in the mid-20th century couldn't possibly convey this theme very well, think again.  Somehow, this premise ends up being an ideal vehicle for a story about friendship and hope.'The Shawshank Redemption' is no metaphor, and that's where it gets its strength. The prison it is named for is treated as the hardest of stone-cold realities, and the characters kept within those prison walls are as real as a next-door neighbor. It's a specific story about specific people in a specific situation...but it is told in such a way that its themes can be applied to many people, and many situations. Such a good story, so well-made, and offering such a positive message of hope and (yes) redemption...why wouldn't anyone treasure this film?",5,To believe in hope,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,3104,"[""'ve"", 'seen', ""'The"", 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'time', 'different', 'reasons', 'characters', 'movie', 'film', 'can', 'grow', 'change', 'evolve', 'viewer.The', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'went', 'theatre', 'see', 'initial', 'run', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'was', 'based', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'was', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'still', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'brought', 'screen', 'changes', 'story', 'characters', 'found', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'stayed', 'true', 'heart', 'story', 'magnified', 'what', 'made', 'story', 'wonder', 'read', 'Simply', 'put', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'was', 'best', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'committed', 'film', 'so', 'today.And', 'own', 'merits', 'fine', 'film', 'very', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'film', 'test', 'time', 'themes', 'are', 'universal', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'immediately', 'music', 'deep', 'emotional', 'chord', 'heart', 'move', 'soul', 'words', 'are', 'familiar', 'yet', 'new', 'other', 'words', 'story', 'men', 'serving', 'lifelong', 'terms', 'prison', 'simplicity', 'unpretentious', 'presentation', 'something', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'can', 'identify', 'something', 'can', 'gain', 'measure', 'hope', 'well.The', 'story', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'going', 'jail', 'killing', 'wife', 'lover', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'common', 'premise', 'one', 'might', 'other', 'movies', 'lead', 'investigation', 'story', 'justice', 'returned', 'vengeance', 'wrought', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'Andy', 'story', 'due', 'course', 'not', 'main', 'thrust', 'overall', 'story', 'arc', 'Andy', 'story', 'part', 'larger', 'story', 'work', 'here', 'tale', 'routine', 'struggle', 'possibilities', 'risks', 'come', 'hope', 'something', 'better.I', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'hope', 'several', 'times', 'already', 'wonder', 'idea', 'hope', 'one', 'central', 'themes', ""'The"", 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'idea', 'even', 'darkest', 'places', 'world', 'are', 'things', 'can', 'keep', 'madness', 'despair', 'things', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'as', 'long', 'do', 'not', 'lose', 'will', 'look', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'movie', 'Maine', 'prison', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'convey', 'theme', 'very', 'well', 'think', 'again', 'Somehow', 'premise', 'up', 'being', 'ideal', 'vehicle', 'story', 'friendship', 'hope', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'metaphor', 'where', 'strength', 'prison', 'named', 'treated', 'hardest', 'stone-cold', 'realities', 'characters', 'kept', 'prison', 'walls', 'are', 'as', 'real', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'specific', 'story', 'specific', 'people', 'specific', 'situation', 'told', 'such', 'way', 'themes', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'many', 'people', 'many', 'situations', 'good', 'story', 'well-made', 'offering', 'such', 'positive', 'message', 'hope', 'yes', 'redemption', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'treasure', 'film']",N/A

This film should top all the lists for the best of 1994. Great acting, great photography, great script, great direction: the script particularly is a work of art; not a single word is wasted in telling the story of two men who become friends in prison.I can't really say any more about the plot without spoiling it, so trust me, it's full of twists, and turns and surprises, and is ultimately, extraordinarily fulfilling. Andy (Tim Robbins) is possibly the only wrongly convicted killer in Shawshank Prison. None of the other prisoners believe that he's innocent, of course, and for a long time the viewer doesn't know what to believe either. Andy was a banker, and very smart. He's also very patient, and his patience serves him well in his finest hour. He becomes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman), a lifer who's already served two decades when Andy arrives at Shawshank. Red can arrange to smuggle anything into the prison-- anything at all. We learn this at the beginning, but don't realize its importance until much later. There's some wonderful foreshadowing that is so subtle, most viewers won't pick it up until it plays out.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are understated and perfect. Their characters are so solid, it's easy to forget that these are actors we've seen many times before, in other roles. The supporting cast is great as well.The camera work is superb. In the greatest movies, the camera is not just a machine for recording the action, but is an active participant in telling the story.

I got almost every emotion from this movie, albeit not at a huge scale as I could predict some scenes.

Set in the 1940s, successful banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is wrongfully accused for the murders of his wife and lover and is sentenced to serve two life sentences at Shawshank Prison. Over the 20 years, Andy eventually gains the respect of his fellow inmates and forms a strong friendship with a resourceful life-timer (Freeman). Based on the novel by Stephen King, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a perfectly crafted and emotionally moving film triumph. The 142-minute drama features a compelling plot and great performances by Robins and Freeman. The fine cast also includes Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler and James Whitmore. Though ""The Shawshank Redemption"" failed in theaters, it received favorable reviews from critics, was nominated for seven Academy Awards and gained a strong following upon television airings and home video release.If you haven't picked up this fantastic film then don't miss out on ""The Shawshank Redemption"" Special Edition. The 1994 prison drama is presented in a fine 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format.

32785,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,0780623134,RJ Smoove,"[4, 4]","The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films that I have ever seen. It may well be the best period. For quite a while it has ranked at #1 on the internet movie database, and with good reason. Not often does a film seamlessly blend gripping dramatic storytelling, with moments of lighthearted humor, as well as moments of deep sadness like this one does. I'm sure that just about everyone has seen this film, but I'll still run through the main plot really quick. An intelligent banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) discovered that his wife was stepping out on him with another man. After a night of drinking, and misguided decisions, he ended up in front of a judge and jury for their murders. In prison for life, he befriended a guy named Red (Morgan Freeman), and eventually the Warden (Bob Gunton). And the journey goes on from there. There are so many great things for me to address, but my favorite is the acting. The entire cast was perfect. Tim Robbins gave probably the best performance of his entire career. At first his character appeared quiet and timid, but after while he seemed to loosen up, and grew as a person from then on. Character development does not get any better than this. He also grew on me, and I felt like I was on the journey with him. Because of how great Robbins was at being secretive, I could not tell if his character was really innocent, or guilty. He also could not have done better at portraying Dufresne's deceptive intelligence. Andy Dufresne was definitely the whole package, and so was Robbins.When an actor gives such a powerful performance, there usually are not any other actors that stand out in the film, but The Shawshank Redemption is exceptional in many ways, including this one. Beside Tim Robbins's, there are a few more perfect performances. There could not have been a better choice for the supporting role than Morgan Freeman as Ellis Redding, or 'Red'. I was really convinced that he was a veteran inmate. His specialty was smuggling in things that his fellow inmates requested. Usually for cash, but cartons of cigarettes seemed just as important as cash in Shawshank Prison. I enjoyed watching Red grow throughout the story, right alongside Andy. In the beginning, Red was as guilty as they come. He knew what he did was terrible, and regretted it, but he didn't know how to convey that sorrow to the parole committee. Honestly, I'm not even sure if he was regretful for his crime, or the fact that he was in prison for life. Every ten years when he got his chance to face the committee, he was rejected because he wasn't confident enough with himself to prove that he was ready to be a member of society again. But he grew as a character and finally proved worthy, simply by admitting that he was young and stupid, and there's nothing he can do to change what he did.Bob Gunton was great as Warden Norton. He wasn't brutal and violent like his head guard Captain Hadley, but he still as sinister as your typical movie villain can be (without being one note and cheesy). He definitely earns his place on my ""Favorite Movie Villains"" list. Speaking of Captain Hadley, Clancy Brown's performance as the prison guard who enjoyed his authority way too much was quite memorable. Not often in film, does the secondary antagonist stand out as much as the primary. But like I said, The Shawshank Redemption is exceptional in many ways. Captain Hadley is right on par with Warden Norton, in my opinion. I cannot give so much attention to the characters without mentioning one of my favorites, Brooks. James Whitmore gave a solid performance as an inmate spent nearly fifty years of his life in Shawshank Prison. He appeared to be just a poor sweet old man that walked around with a bird in his pocket, but we later saw how institutionalized his time behind bars made him. It was really sad, and one of the most effective parts on the story. But enough of the actors. I always pay attention to the music in films. So with that said, I have to mention the wonderful score done by the legendary composer Thomas Newman. He has composed some beautiful scores for big films like WALL-E, American Beauty, Finding Nemo, The Green Mile, Road to Perdition and Jarhead. But the music he did for The Shawshank Redemption ranks among his best, in my opinion.I don't know what else to say about this wonderful film, besides how beautiful it is. I cannot think of anything at all to complain about. It's one of my favorite films because it never gets dull, and it never gets old. It's a film that needs to be watched, and rewatched. Director Frank Darabont has not done many films, but I doubt he will ever be able to top this one anyway. The Shawshank Redemption is a classic that should not be missed by anyone. And the Blu-ray presentation should not be missed by anyone either. This is a gorgeous looking transfer. A beautiful transfer for a beautiful film. Highly Recommended!",5,"""Get busy living or get busy dying.""",1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,4927,"['Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'may', 'well', 'be',

32787,A8EMYIOE9SVR5,0780623134,"""robbyk""","[2, 3]","I remember seeing this movie for the first time back in '95. The movie wasn't getting good reviews mostly because of its length, so I didn't want to see it in the theater. When it came out on video, I grudgingly borrowed  it when nothing else was available. 4 amazing hours later, I realized that  not only was it the best movie I had ever seen, but it was the kind of  movie that changes my whole outlook on the way movies should be.The  Shawshank Redemption is not about prison life, or about unjust crime, but  it revolves around human emotion and the strength of one man, Andy Dufresne  (Tim Robbins), who must find the injustice around him and find his own  freedom. It is also about how such a man can change the people around him,  like Andy does to Red (Morgan Freeman), the (as he puts it) &quot;guy who  can get it for you&quot;. At first, Red doesn't believe that Andy can make  it through a terrible place like Shawshank, but Andy continues to prove his  friend wrong everyday, because of his will to be free and his undying hope.Hope is another central part to this movie. Although Red warns Andy of  hope's dangerous grasp, Andy knows that it is the only thing that keeps him  alive, the only thing that can help him go on in the corrupt and filthy  world of the prison. And after the remarkable and surprising ending (which  is still exciting after every viewing), Red realizes Andy's great internal  strength.Frank Darabont does a terrific job with the directing and the  script; his adaptation of Steven King's novella is downright flawless. The  visuals and cinematography is also flawless. Flawless is really the only  word to describe this movie, and it is a shame that it did not receive the  kind of attention that it deserved. Thankfully, the movie has made a  pseudo-revival through video and DVD release. Robbins and Freeman (who  should've won the Oscar but lost to Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump)) are  sensational in their roles, considering the fact that they couldn't rely on  flashy sets of dramatic changes of scenery. Wearing the same clothes and  being in the same set scene after scene can truly demonstrate fine acting.I'm very glad that I picked up this movie on that one night; I learned  never to listen to critics drag on and on about film length, and to never  underestimate the power of one film. This movie truly shows the fine craft  that is a timeless movie, one that remains in your mind since the first  time you finished watching the ending credits. 147 minutes?

32788,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0780623134,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont, 1994)At this point, I have two problems facing me: first, that I have seen The Shawshank Redemption more times than I can count in the past fourteen years, and have still never quite found the words for a proper review, and second, that everything I could say about this movie has probably been said more concisely and more eloquently than I could say it. Why add one more ""me too"" to the mass? (Yes, I did take a break and think about this question for fifteen minutes before deciding to go forward with this review.) In my case, I think I went back to Darabont's greatest success (to date) as a director after witnessing his greatest failure (to date) as a director, The Mist. That was a movie that had mountains of potential and blew it all. The Shawshank Redemption was a movie with mountains of potential that is almost completely realized. There are a few quizzical changes to the original text, but what made it to the screen did so in the best of ways.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man sent to Shawshank prison for a life sentence after being convicted of the murder of his wife. Dufresne maintains his innocence, but as we are told (those of us who don't already know, anyway), ""you can't throw a stone in prison without hitting an innocent man."" Morgan Freeman plays Ellis ""Red"" Redding, Dufresne's first friend in the prison, and the man who slowly draws Dufresne into a circle of the gentler, more intelligent prisoners, even as he's menaced by the, shall we say, less cultured of the bunch. (Even so, there does seem to be quite a bit of smoothing on the edges of this prison tale.) Dufresne soon becomes a force to be reckoned with inside the walls, cooking the prison's books, doing tax returns for the guards, and singlehandedly petitioning the state for money to expand the woeful prison library, where Dufresne works under the tutelage of fellow lifer Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore, who has mostly retired since his 1991 appearance in The Majestic). But Dufresne, whose philosophy is that freedom is all in your head, never does stop maintaining his innocence.The one thing that always confused me about Darabont's adaptation seems like the most minor of the changes he made; the thing with the poster. In the original story, the girl on the poster changes. It's one of the ways King uses to show the passage of time in the story, and it's an effective little tool; he shows not only the passage of twenty years of Andy Dufresne's life, but the changing fashions in the world outside the prison, as well. It's another aspect of Andy's ""freedom is all in your mind"" refrain, and it plays very well. In Darabont's screenplay. Rita Hayworth begins the trip, and Rita Hayworth ends it. Could the movie budget not afford two more vintage posters? That's the only reason I can see for changing such an effective detail. And while that's the only one that really stands out, it does plant the seeds. I'm certainly not saying it is in any way a bad movie; it is, in fact, an excellent one, one of the best ever made. I just wonder if, perhaps, it could have been just a touch better. **** ",4,"Great, but as good as it could have been?",1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,3146,"['Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Frank', 'Darabont', '1994', 'point', 'have', 'two', 'problems', 'facing', 'first', 'have', 'seen', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'count', 'past', 'fourteen', 'years', 'have', 'still', 'never', 'quite', 'found', 'words', 'proper', 'review', 'second', 'everything', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'probably', 'been', 'said', 'more', 'concisely', 'more', 'eloquently', 'could', 'say', 'Why', 'add', 'one', 'more', 'too', 'mass', 'Yes', 'did', 'take', 'break', 'think', 'question', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'deciding', 'go', 'forward', 'review', 'case', 'think', 'went', 'back', 'Darabont', 'greatest', 'success', 'date', 'director', 'witnessing', 'greatest', 'failure', 'date', 'director', 'Mist', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'mountains', 'potential', 'blew', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'was', 'movie', 'mountains', 'potential', 'almost', 'completely', 'realized', 'are', 'few', 'quizzical', 'changes', 'original', 'text', 'what', 'made', 'screen', 'did', 'so', 'best', 'ways.Tim', 'Robbins', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'man', 'sent', 'Shawshank', 'prison', 'life', 'sentence', 'being', 'convicted', 'murder', 'wife', 'Dufresne', 'innocence', 'are', 'told', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'throw', 'stone', 'prison', 'hitting', 'innocent', 'man', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ellis', 'Red', 'Redding', 'Dufresne', 'first', 'friend', 'prison', 'man', 'who', 'slowly', 'Dufresne', 'circle', 'gentler', 'more', 'intelligent', 'prisoners', 'even', 'menaced', 'shall', 'say', 'less', 'cultured', 'bunch', 'Even', 'so', 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'bit', 'smoothing', 'edges', 'prison', 'tale', 'Dufresne', 'soon', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'walls', 'cooking', 'prison', 'books', 'doing', 'tax', 'returns', 'guards', 'singlehandedly', 'petitioning', 'state', 'money', 'expand', 'woeful', 'prison', 'library', 'where', 'Dufresne', 'tutelage', 'fellow', 'lifer', 'Brooks', 'Hatlen', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'who', 'mostly', 'retired', '1991', 'appearance', 'Majestic', 'Dufresne', 'philosophy', 'freedom', 'head', 'never', 'stop', 'maintaining', 'innocence.The', 'one', 'thing', 'always', 'confused', 'Darabont', 'adaptation', 'most', 'minor', 'changes', 'made', 'thing', 'poster', 'original', 'story', 'girl', 'poster', 'changes', 'one', 'ways', 'King', 'show', 'passage', 'time', 'story', 'effective', 'little', 'tool', 'not', 'only', 'passage', 'twenty', 'years', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'life', 'changing', 'fashions', 'world', 'prison', 'as', 'well', 'aspect', 'Andy', 'freedom', 'mind', 'refrain', 'very', 'well', 'Darabont', 'screenplay', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'trip', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Could', 'movie', 'budget', 'not', 'afford', 'two', 'more', 'vintage', 'posters', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'see', 'changing', 'effective', 'detail', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'plant', 'seeds', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'saying', 'way', 'bad', 'movie', 'fact', 'excellent', 'one', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'just', 'wonder', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'touch', 'better', '****']",N/A
32789,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,0780623134,Robert Blake,"[1, 2]","""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the kind of film we rarely get nowadays at the movies. Its the kind of film you can watch several times and it still retains a feeling of freshness and eventhough you know the secrets, watching the film never becomes tiresome. Taken from a Stephen King novella, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a horror story, eventhough it has truly frightening moments, it is a story about hope, patience and the human condition in general. Director Frank Darabont finds the perfect tones in cinematography, writing and casting to breath life into this story with great flare and intelligence. Like all great movies it never feels too long, every scene feels like it was shot, written and performed with great care. It almost feels as if Darabont is directing for the sheer sake of wanting to make a good movie, this is of course the same feeling we would later get from films like ""The Majestic"" and another modern classic taken from a King book, ""The Green Mile."" The framing of the story is brilliant, the photography is cold and rich, really taking us into the Shawshank prison and it's interiors. The performances are superb with Morgan Freeman really standing out as Red, our narrator, but Tim Robbins also delivers an immortal performance as the quiet, intelligent Andy who comes to personify freedom and defiance in a way only a great character could. Darabont's script has a wonderful style to its writing, it feels like literature with a modern twitch. 10 years after it's release (when like ""Citizen Kane"" it flopped only to be re-discovered later), ""The Shawshank Redemption"" returns in this impressive 2 disc set which gives us the film in a beautiful print and documentaries featuring fascinating stories from the making of the picture and interesting examinations at the movie's popularity and appeal to audiences.

32792,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0780623134,Robert Morris,"[0, 0]","Based on a Stephen King novella and directed by Frank Darabont, this film covers a 20-year period during which Andy Defresne (Robbins), a former banker convicted of murder, somehow preserves his dignity while surviving the brutalities he endures in a state prison in Maine. There are many reasons why this film retains its appeal to me during the eight years since I first saw it. Here are three. First, the evolving friendship between Defresne and ""Red"" Redding (Freeman) enables both actors to play off each other while developing their respective, quite different characters. (Color of skin is among the least significant of those differences.) Also, the unhurried pace of the film seems appropriate to the pace of life within a state prison. While seeing this film once again recently, although familiar with all plot details, I found myself relaxing and ""going with the flow"" the way many inmates presumably do. Darabont's skillful control of the pace givens sudden, unexpected plot developments even greater dramatic force. Finally, I admire Bob Gunton's portrayal of Warden Samuel Norton, a clever but corrupt and (when he deems it necessary) brutal public official. His fate is obviously not the ""redemption"" he has in mind for himself. FYI, cinematographer Roger Deakins was later hired by the Brothers Cohen to provide his services to the filming of Fargo. The Shawshank Redemption now has and certainly deserves a high level of esteem which it did not (but should) have when first released in 1994.",5,Gettin' ready to live or to die?,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,1509,"['Based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'film', '20-year', 'period', 'Andy', 'Defresne', 'Robbins', 'former', 'banker', 'convicted', 'murder', 'somehow', 'dignity', 'surviving', 'brutalities', 'state', 'prison', 'Maine', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'appeal', 'eight', 'years', 'first', 'saw', 'Here', 'are', 'three', 'First', 'evolving', 'friendship', 'Defresne', 'Red', 'Redding', 'Freeman', 'actors', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'developing', 'respective', 'quite', 'different', 'characters', 'Color', 'skin', 'least', 'significant', 'differences', 'Also', 'unhurried', 'pace', 'film', 'appropriate', 'pace', 'life', 'state', 'prison', 'seeing', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'recently', 'familiar', 'plot', 'details', 'found', 'relaxing', 'going', 'flow', 'way', 'many', 'inmates', 'presumably', 'do', 'Darabont', 'skillful', 'control', 'pace', 'sudden', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'developments', 'even', 'greater', 'dramatic', 'force', 'Finally', 'admire', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'portrayal', 'Warden', 'Samuel', 'Norton', 'clever', 'corrupt', 'when', 'necessary', 'brutal', 'public', 'official', 'fate', 'obviously', 'not', 'redemption', 'mind', 'FYI', 'cinematographer', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'was', 'later', 'hired', 'Brothers', 'Cohen', 'provide', 'services', 'filming', 'Fargo', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'now', 'certainly', 'high', 'level', 'esteem', 'did', 'not', 'should', 'have', 'when', 'first', 'released', '1994']",N/A

32809,A27NTH2Y9DAR31,0780623134,Schuyler V. Johnson,"[5, 5]","I hope the Pacific Ocean is as blue as I think it is. I hope.This is really the perfect movie; not one single flaw, and every second of film is important and meaningful to the plot and character development. Movies are not to be rushed through; they should be savored and enjoyed, and this one has it's own special place in moviemaking.I have never liked prison movies, but this one (and the Green Mile) transcends the genre. It is not really a movie about a prison, it is a movie about hope and the strength of the human spirit despite unbelievable obstacles. Tim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne, is fantastic. Very slow, calm and with a shy, quiet wit and a keen eye to the human frailties of his tormentors, notably the warden and the brutal prison guard, he adapts quickly and learns the ropes about how to survive in an atmosphere that few could. Morgan Freeman, who narrates in his beautiful, soothing voice, plays Red, Andy's best friend, and the relationship between the two is deeply moving.Andy bucks the system, often, but not just to show off or be a smart alec, to improve the lives of the prisoners who must survive under a primitve, sadistic regime, and to help them feel like men, and have a taste of freedom and dignity. The first night that Andy is there, a heavyset prisoner, very young, breaks down and calls for his mother; unfortunately, he pays a high price for his emotions, in the first scene that demonstrates the true evil that rules this dark, Gothic world.Tommy arrives, some years later, a young, brash criminal in the making, with a great sense of humor and defensive about his lack of education; notably, his inability to read...this is resolved by Andy, who takes the young man under his wing and teaches him letters and eventually, Tommy passes his test.The next scene that really shocked me was the warden's response to Tommy's story about who the real killer of Andy's wife was; via a confession from a former cellmate. The warden and most of the guards have a vested interest in keeping Andy right where he is, after finding out he was able to save them a lot of money on their income tax returns due to his banker's background. Far too valuable a man to lose just because he was unjustly charged.SPOILER!But Andy is nothing if not resourceful, and he has had years to plan his escape...and not only an escape but one that nets him hundreds of thousands of the warden's own money, blows the whistle on the atrocities that have been going on in the little fiefdom the warden so enjoyed as his own personal outlet for brutality, and a permanent freedom to do whatever he wants to do with the money to do it with.The ending is one of, if not the, most satisfying it has ever been my pleasure to see, and wonderfully satisfying after all the horrors these men have been put through. Red eventually wins his freedom, and departs the only place he knew for a world that is strange, unwelcoming, and hostile. I love the scene of Red, after having walked for miles through deserted fields, he comes upon a buried box that Andy had told him about, opens it and finds a nice wad of cash. He looks around several times, although in the middle of nowhere; he cannot believe there isn't someone watching him; after all, he has been watched 24/7 for several decades.This money is his ticket back to Andy, and a reunion that satisfies the soul.I watch this every time it is on TV, and every time I do, I find it as wonderful as the first time...and enjoy it just as much, if not more; it is a movie that doesn't lose impact after repeated viewings and actually makes you feel good after seeing it, because it proves that no matter how bleak things are in your life, someone else's is always worse, and things will get better if you only perservere...take a page from Andy's book and thank God for what you have.",5,I HOPE TO GET TO SEE MY FRIEND AGAIN,1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,3827,"['hope', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'as', 'blue', 'think', 'hope.This', 'really', 'perfect', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'flaw', 'second', 'film', 'important', 'meaningful', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'Movies', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'rushed', 'should', 'be', 'savored', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'own', 'special', 'place', 'moviemaking.I', 'have', 'never', 'liked', 'prison', 'movies', 'one', 'Green', 'Mile', 'genre', 'not', 'really', 'movie', 'prison', 'movie', 'hope', 'strength', 'human', 'spirit', 'unbelievable', 'obstacles', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'fantastic', 'Very', 'slow', 'calm', 'shy', 'quiet', 'wit', 'keen', 'eye', 'human', 'frailties', 'tormentors', 'notably', 'warden', 'brutal', 'prison', 'guard', 'quickly', 'ropes', 'how', 'survive', 'atmosphere', 'few', 'could', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'beautiful', 'soothing', 'voice', 'plays', 'Red', 'Andy', 'best', 'friend', 'relationship', 'two', 'deeply', 'moving.Andy', 'bucks', 'system', 'often', 'not', 'just', 'show', 'off', 'be', 'smart', 'alec', 'improve', 'lives', 'prisoners', 'who', 'must', 'survive', 'primitve', 'sadistic', 'regime', 'help', 'feel', 'men', 'have', 'taste', 'freedom', 'dignity', 'first', 'night', 'Andy', 'there', 'heavyset', 'prisoner', 'very', 'young', 'breaks', 'down', 'mother', 'unfortunately', 'high', 'price', 'emotions', 'first', 'scene', 'true', 'evil', 'rules', 'dark', 'Gothic', 'world.Tommy', 'arrives', 'years', 'later', 'young', 'brash', 'criminal', 'making', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'defensive', 'lack', 'education', 'notably', 'inability', 'read', 'resolved', 'Andy', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'wing', 'teaches', 'letters', 'eventually', 'Tommy', 'test.The', 'next', 'scene', 'really', 'shocked', 'was', 'warden', 'response', 'Tommy', 'story', 'who', 'real', 'killer', 'Andy', 'wife', 'was', 'confession', 'former', 'cellmate', 'warden', 'most', 'guards', 'have', 'vested', 'interest', 'keeping', 'Andy', 'right', 'where', 'finding', 'out', 'was', 'able', 'save', 'lot', 'money', 'income', 'tax', 'returns', 'due', 'banker', 'background', 'Far', 'too', 'valuable', 'man', 'lose', 'just', 'was', 'unjustly', 'charged.SPOILER', 'Andy', 'nothing', 'not', 'resourceful', 'had', 'years', 'plan', 'escape', 'not', 'only', 'escape', 'one', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'warden', 'own', 'money', 'whistle', 'atrocities', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'little', 'fiefdom', 'warden', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'own', 'personal', 'outlet', 'brutality', 'permanent', 'freedom', 'do', 'whatever', 'do', 'money', 'do', 'with.The', 'ending', 'one', 'not', 'most', 'satisfying', 'ever', 'been', 'pleasure', 'see', 'wonderfully', 'satisfying', 'horrors', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'Red', 'eventually', 'freedom', 'only', 'place', 'knew', 'world', 'strange', 'unwelcoming', 'hostile', 'love', 'scene', 'Red', 'having', 'walked', 'miles', 'through', 'deserted', 'fields', 'buried', 'box', 'Andy', 'had', 'told', 'nice', 'wad', 'cash', 'several', 'times', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'can', 'not', 'believe', ""n't"", 'someone', 'watching', 'been', 'watched', '24/7', 'several', 'decades.This', 'money', 'ticket', 'back', 'Andy', 'reunion', 'soul.I', 'watch', 'time', 'TV', 'time', 'do', 'find', 'as', 'wonderful', 'first', 'time', 'enjoy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'movie', ""n't"", 'lose', 'impact', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'actually', 'feel', 'good', 'seeing', 'matter', 'how', 'bleak', 'things', 'are', 'life', 'someone', 'else', 'always', 'worse', 'things', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'only', 'perservere', 'take', 'page', 'Andy', 'book', 'thank', 'God', 'what', 'have']",N/A
32810,A1C58YXM2A30CY,0780623134,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[0, 0]","Directed by Frank Darabont. Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton.I just finished reading one of the novelettes by Stephen King, ""Rita Hayworth & the Shawshank Redemption,"" from the collected stories of ""Different Seasons.""  I was pleased to see that many of the points of the novel were not changed in the movie.Though the book has its dark moments, the movie is even darker.  And though I won't compare the book too much, I may allude to it from time to time in this short review.Plot:  Overall, it's about Andy Dufresne, a banker who had the unfortunate fate of being married to a woman who was cheating on him.  The book portrays Andy as a quiet man that the jury in his trial mistook for being cold and calculated.  As in the novel, the prosecutor goes over Andy's claim that he loaded a gun and then threw it away.  More likely, says the prosecutor, Andy shot the victims four times, reloaded and shot them again.Andy is totally railroaded.  Even though it's only a short part of the film, I'm sure that trials such as these will resonate with an audience.  Trials and being fair are part of the constitutional system of law in the United States.  To see it perverted and throwing a man into prison, two life terms, is quite a criticism of that system.The second guy in the mix is Warden Norton and his thugs as they run Andy so tight; they let him have his library and some semblance of protection from ""bull rapists"" as long as Andy keeps fixing the books for Norton's under-the-table schemes.  This is an interesting part of the tale - not only does Norton continue his criminal ways, but he also hides behind his Bible and his righteousness.  Scary.(Spoiler) There is a part of the tale where a prisoner, Tommy Williams, knows who actually killed the couple that Andy is accused of killing.  Andy sees this as an opportunity to provide his innocence.  The Warden Norton will have none of it.  In the book Williams is transferred.  In the film, Norton has Williams assassinated under the guise of ""escaping.""  Pretty thrilling yet amazing what some will do to protect their own interests, even at the sacrifice of others' freedoms.Bottom Line:  The story goes on, being narrated by ""Red"" his only friend, with some amazing acting skill by the veteran actor James Whitmore as a prisoner who's been locked up for fifty years.  The running joke of the Parole Board, the viciousness of the prisoners and the guards and the hypocrisy among the warden and his staff are very evident, very entertaining and shocking at the same time.

When it was released in 1994, it lost credit to the ever pop-culture appealing, Tom Hanks fueled film Forrest Gump (not a bad movie, but come on) this movie had far better storytelling,  acting, impact and endurance. Now I am glad to see people stand up and  really embrase The Shawshank Redemption in all it's glory.Tim Robbins  is brilliant as the character of Andy Dufrense who personifies hope,  patience and persistence, during his long spent time in Shawshank Prison  for a double murder, in which he was framed.This is basically what The  Fugitive would have been if the bus didn't crash, with Kimble  escaping.Morgan Freeman is beyond brilliant as Ellis &quot;Red&quot;  Redding who personifies friendship and a great heart, and has a really  heart warming ending narration.And it's about time to mention his narration  throughout the move which is perhaps the best ever, only rivaled by Robert  De Niro's narrations in Taxi Driver.This film works as both a character  study and a feel-good movie.When Forrest Gump becomes less respected, this  deserving contender will rise even higher!

32819,ABE14SVILZLNY,0780623134,"SID ""Punk""","[2, 2]","At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.",5,"Great story, wondrously told and acted",1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,4370,"['heart', 'extraordinary', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'indelible', 'performance', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Red', 'man', 'who', 'how', 'get', 'things', 'only', 'guilty', 'man', 'Shawshank', 'prison', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Best', 'Actor', '1995', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'won', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'What', 'Freeman', 'so', 'beautifully', 'slightly', 'underplay', 'part', 'eternal', 'boredom', 'cynicism', 'lifer', 'yet', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'warmth', 'life', 'man', 'confinement', 'Someday', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'going', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'will', 'be', 'belated', 'recognition', 'performance', 'think', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'subtle', 'Academy', 'members', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'time.But', 'Freeman', 'not', 'alone', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'hero', 'story', 'banker', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'who', 'been', 'falsely', 'convicted', 'murdering', 'wife', 'lover', 'Robbins', 'unique', 'quality', 'actor', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'bemused', 'irony', 'characters', 'part', 'amused', 'what', 'doing', 'believe', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'might', 'be', 'compared', 'work', 'Player', '1992', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Mystic', 'River', '2003', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor.It', 'said', 'good', 'story', 'villain', 'Bible-quoting', 'Bible-thumping', 'massively', 'hypocritical', 'sadistic', 'Warden', 'Samuel', 'Norton', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'have', 'doozy', 'want', 'tell', 'Norton', 'so', 'evil', 'fundamentalist', 'Christians', 'actually', 'hate', 'movie', 'how', 'precisely', 'vile', 'character', 'revealed', 'also', 'hate', 'movie', 'depiction', 'violent', 'predatory', 'homosexual', 'behavior', 'reason', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'wall', 'office', 'hiding', 'safe', 'ill-gotten', 'contents', 'duplicitous', 'accounts', 'framed', 'plaque', 'words', 'judgment', 'cometh', 'right', 'soon', 'irony', 'words', 'apply', 'men', 'prison', 'ultimately', 'warden', 'just', 'perfect', 'will', 'take', 'delight', 'promise.Here', 'other', 'information', 'movie', 'may', 'interest', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'was', 'adapted', 'novella', 'Stephen', 'King', 'entitled', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'figures', 'story', 'Red', 'poster', 'Andy', 'up', 'wall', 'cell', 'poster', 'still', 'film', 'Gilda', '1946', 'starring', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'see', 'clip', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'prisoners', 'watch', 'cheering', 'hollering', 'when', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'check', 'out', 'old', 'movie', 'really', 'gorgeous', 'forerunner', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'who', 'next', 'Andy', 'wall', 'still', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Itch', '1955', 'famous', 'shot', 'skirt', 'blown', 'up', 'reveal', 'shapely', 'legs', 'Following', 'Andy', 'wall', 'way', 'pinups', 'figure', 'prominently', 'plot', 'Rachel', 'Welsh', 'One', 'Million', 'Years', 'B.C', '1966', 'simple', 'effective', 'device', 'pinups', 'show', 'graphically', 'how', 'long', 'Andy', 'Red', 'have', 'been', 'pining', 'away.Frank', 'Darabont', 'direction', 'full', 'similar', 'devices', 'clearly', 'naturally', 'tell', 'story', 'Brooks', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'who', 'out', 'fifty', 'years', 'so', 'institutionalized', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cope', 'life', 'outside', 'Playing', 'Red', 'periodic', 'appearance', 'parole', 'board', 'where', 'parole', 'summarily', 'REJECTED', 'Watch', 'how', 'out', 'end.The', 'cinematography', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'excellent', 'editing', 'superb', 'not', 'single', 'dead', 'spot', 'whole', 'movie', 'difference', 'good', 'guys', 'Red', 'Andy', 'Brooks', 'etc', 'bad', 'guys', 'warden', 'guards', 'sisters', 'etc', 'perhaps', 'too', 'starkly', 'drawn', 'perhaps', 'Andy', 'bit', 'too', 'heroic', 'determined', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'realistic', 'perhaps', 'redemption', 'bit', 'too', 'miraculous', 'how', 'beautifully', 'out', 'never', 'mind', 'love', 'it.All', 'great', 'story', 'vividly', 'told', 'will', 'leave', 'true', 'sense', 'redemption', 'soul', 'not', 'chick', 'flick', 'understatement', 'male', 'bonding', 'movie', 'friendship', 'strength', 'character', 'about', 'going', 'up', 'what', 'wrong', 'unfair', 'coming', 'out', 'top', 'pure', 'true', 'grit', 'little', 'luck']",N/A

The main character, played by Tim Robbins, is a banker named Andy who's sent to Shawshank Prison on a murder charge, but as he gets to know a life-term prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman), the audience is led to realize the banker's crime was probably justifiable homocide.

32823,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,0780623134,Sky,"[6, 6]","There aren't many film's that are better than the book (or short story...or novella) that they are based on, but The Shawshank Redemption is absolutely one that could actually be better than it's pulp predecessor.Back in 1982 Stephen King released a compilation of novellas under the title Different SeasonsDifferent Seasons (Signet). And two of the best King movie adaptations EVER came out of that book: Stand By Me in 1986Stand By Me (Special Edition)and The Shawshank Redemption in 1994.But what inspired me today to write a review about a 13 year old movie? Well...three things actually:1) I saw a customer review on Amazon today calling the 2006 video game adaptation-film Silent HillSilent Hill""visionary"" and ranking it 5 stars. I tried to think of movies that were 5 star movies in my book; there aren't many (relatively), and Silent Hill is far from 5 stars in my book. So, I was inspired to find a movie to write about that truly made the cut.2) I wrote a review today for the 2007 film adaptation of King's short story 1408 (see1408 (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)&Everything's Eventual : 14 Dark Tales). But 1408 was also far from 5 stars in my book, so I was looking for redemption in the way of something better to write about.3) And finally, I saw an ad today for the late 2007 release of The Mist, another film adaptation of a King short story this time from 1985's Skeleton CrewSkeleton Crew (Signet). But what's really interesting is that the director of The Mist is the same guy that directed The Shawshank Redemption...Frank Darabont...so my expectations for The Mist are very high! (Darabont also directed King's The Green MileThe Green Mile (Two-Disc Special Edition).)So back to Shawshank. This movie was terrific...one of the top 5 I've ever seen. It kept all of the most impressionable book scenes entirely intact. And keep in mind that this was a Stephen King novella, so there's some pretty interesting stuff (you can count on King to wow you with precise tales that include plenty of thrills...and when he doesn't thrill you he goes for the gross-out!).Importantly, Shawshank really captured the bonds of friendship so perfectly created in King's novella. The Shawshank Redemption was a moving, realistic portrayal of a day in the prison-life of a wrongly convicted man; the movie really is the novella come to life.Kudos to Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman for exact incarnations of the characters in King's story; kudos to Darabont for his direction; and kudos to all for putting their hearts into the roles to create a show that not only entertains, but evokes emotional reminisces in viewers that grew up in a very different world from today.The Shawshank Redemption is truly worthy of it's 5 stars here at Amazon, and it should be added to your collection.",5,King Of King Adaptations,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,2785,"['are', ""n't"", 'many', 'film', 'are', 'better', 'book', 'short', 'story', 'novella', 'are', 'based', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'absolutely', 'one', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'better', 'pulp', 'predecessor.Back', '1982', 'Stephen', 'King', 'released', 'compilation', 'novellas', 'title', 'Different', 'SeasonsDifferent', 'Seasons', 'Signet', 'two', 'best', 'King', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'EVER', 'came', 'book', 'Stand', 'Me', '1986Stand', 'Me', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', '1994.But', 'what', 'inspired', 'today', 'write', 'review', '13', 'year', 'old', 'movie', 'Well', 'three', 'things', 'actually:1', 'saw', 'customer', 'review', 'Amazon', 'today', 'calling', '2006', 'video', 'game', 'adaptation-film', 'Silent', 'HillSilent', 'Hill', 'visionary', 'ranking', '5', 'stars', 'tried', 'think', 'movies', 'were', '5', 'star', 'movies', 'book', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'relatively', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'far', '5', 'stars', 'book', 'So', 'was', 'inspired', 'find', 'movie', 'write', 'truly', 'made', 'cut.2', 'wrote', 'review', 'today', '2007', 'film', 'adaptation', 'King', 'short', 'story', '1408', 'see1408', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Everything', 'Eventual', '14', 'Dark', 'Tales', '1408', 'was', 'also', 'far', '5', 'stars', 'book', 'was', 'looking', 'redemption', 'way', 'something', 'better', 'write', 'about.3', 'finally', 'saw', 'ad', 'today', 'late', '2007', 'release', 'Mist', 'film', 'adaptation', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'time', '1985', 'Skeleton', 'CrewSkeleton', 'Crew', 'Signet', 'what', 'really', 'interesting', 'director', 'Mist', 'same', 'guy', 'directed', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'so', 'expectations', 'Mist', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'Darabont', 'also', 'directed', 'King', 'Green', 'MileThe', 'Green', 'Mile', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'So', 'back', 'Shawshank', 'movie', 'was', 'terrific', 'one', 'top', '5', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'kept', 'most', 'impressionable', 'book', 'scenes', 'entirely', 'intact', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'can', 'count', 'King', 'wow', 'precise', 'tales', 'include', 'plenty', 'thrills', 'when', ""n't"", 'thrill', 'gross-out', '.Importantly', 'Shawshank', 'really', 'captured', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'so', 'perfectly', 'created', 'King', 'novella', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'was', 'moving', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'day', 'prison-life', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'man', 'movie', 'really', 'novella', 'come', 'life.Kudos', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'exact', 'incarnations', 'characters', 'King', 'story', 'kudos', 'Darabont', 'direction', 'kudos', 'putting', 'hearts', 'roles', 'create', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'emotional', 'reminisces', 'viewers', 'grew', 'up', 'very', 'different', 'world', 'today.The', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'truly', 'worthy', '5', 'stars', 'here', 'Amazon', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'collection']",N/A

Based on the ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" novella that appeared in Stephen King's Different Seasons and directed by Frank Darabont, The Shawshank Redemption is the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a young banker who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in the Shawshank State Prison in Maine.  His guts and resourcefulness earn the friendship of Red (Freeman), a lifer who is known around the prison for procuring otherwise unattainable things, such as the rock hammer Andy uses for his sculpting hobby.  Because of Andy's will to survive the harsh conditions of the prison as well as the corruption of the warden and the guards he soon earns the respect and friendship of the other inmates as well.  Although Andy seems to have accepted his life sentence, the other inmates soon find out otherwise when it is discovered that he might not be the guilty party in the murder of his wife and her lover after all.All in all, The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie with a fine supporting cast in Bob Gunton (the warden), James Whitmore (Brooks), Clancy Brown (the head guard), William Sadler, and Gil Bellows.

32835,A1O7OMW58QWG5K,0780623134,Stacey Cochran,"[2, 3]","Frank Darabont wrote the screenplay and directed ""The Shawshank Redemption"" based on Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,"" which was published in ""Different Seasons"". Darabont had worked once before with adapting King's fiction in his film school, award-winning, three year long production of ""The Woman in the Room"" -- a movie Stephen King says is one of the ten best fiction-to-movie adaptations ever made. Darabont was best known for directing modern remakes of ""B"" movies when he first optioned Shawshank (The Fly and The Blob and the USA television movie Buried Alive).His Shawshank Redemption is the story of a man wrongfully charged with the murder of his wife and her lover, a man sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison, and this man's undying spirit of hope in a place where hopes seems all but lost. Tim Robbins plays this character: Andrew Dufresne. Dufresne's kindness and intelligence help him to make friends with both the prisonkeeps and the prisoners. Morgan Freeman plays Ellis Boyd Redding, ""Red"" to his friends, a ""man who can get you things"" and Freeman's voice-over narration gives the film both a world-weary and noble sensibility. In one respect, Red is just as intelligent as Dufresne (albeit a kind of ""street smart"" intelligence) -- each know how to work within the system. However, Red keeps quiet around authority, whereas Dufresne draws into a more involved (and dangerous) working relationship with the guards and the warden.It is an emotional drama -- one where friendship and kindness rises above cruelty and injustice. Hence, it is kind of ""romantic"" in the classical sense; that is, you ain't gonna find any prison in the US where guys are this buddy-buddy. However, this is balanced (in my opinion) by Roger Deakin's masterful cinematography, and the story's ultimate message of hope. I believe Deakins won an Oscar for his work and though the venerable cinematographer's collaboration with the Coen brothers may give you a better understanding of his range -- it is clear in Shawshank that his range is damn well, wide open. If ever you wanted to learn cinematography, Roger Deakins is the man to study. His camera work gives life to scenes that are ostensibly void of life, and his masterful work with black and white, with light and color, is one of the major components that gives Shawshank its powerful psychological tension and brilliance.Bob Gunton plays the sanctimoneous and corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancey Brown turns in a fine performance as the brutal Captain of the Guards, Byron Hadley. I also enjoyed the performance of Brian Libby as the jocular ""Floyd"". And several of the scenes with James Whitmore's ""Brooks Hatlen"" are heartrenderingly emotional. Noteable also is the Hank-Williams loving ""Heywood"" played by William Sadler, and Gil Bellows's first film role as ""Tommy"".My two favorite scenes are: 1) the scene with the prisoners drinking beer atop the license plate factory and 2) the final scene, filmed in the US Virgin Islands. These are the images that stay with me the most after viewing this film. They are the scenes where prisoners are made free, and the story rises above existential bleakness. They are colorful and alive, intended to show redemption realized. Altogether ""The Shawshank Redemption"" may well be my favorite ""stuck on an island"" movie because it is the story of hope realized no matter the circumstances. It offers us the possibility of redemption from injustice, futility, and despair. It offers us a story wherein kindness and belief triumph. And in that, it may well be one of the finest movies of the human spirit at its best.",5,Hope Realized,1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,3660,"['Frank', 'Darabont', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'directed', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'was', 'published', 'Different', 'Seasons', 'Darabont', 'had', 'worked', 'once', 'adapting', 'King', 'fiction', 'film', 'school', 'award-winning', 'three', 'year', 'long', 'production', 'Woman', 'Room', 'movie', 'Stephen', 'King', 'one', 'ten', 'best', 'fiction-to-movie', 'adaptations', 'ever', 'made', 'Darabont', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'directing', 'modern', 'remakes', 'B', 'movies', 'when', 'first', 'optioned', 'Shawshank', 'Fly', 'Blob', 'USA', 'television', 'movie', 'Buried', 'Alive', '.His', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'story', 'man', 'wrongfully', 'charged', 'murder', 'wife', 'lover', 'man', 'sentenced', 'two', 'life', 'sentences', 'Shawshank', 'State', 'Prison', 'man', 'undying', 'spirit', 'hope', 'place', 'where', 'lost', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'Andrew', 'Dufresne', 'Dufresne', 'kindness', 'intelligence', 'help', 'make', 'friends', 'prisonkeeps', 'prisoners', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ellis', 'Boyd', 'Redding', 'Red', 'friends', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'things', 'Freeman', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'film', 'world-weary', 'noble', 'sensibility', 'one', 'respect', 'Red', 'just', 'as', 'intelligent', 'Dufresne', 'kind', 'street', 'smart', 'intelligence', 'know', 'how', 'work', 'system', 'However', 'Red', 'quiet', 'authority', 'whereas', 'Dufresne', 'more', 'involved', 'dangerous', 'working', 'relationship', 'guards', 'warden.It', 'emotional', 'drama', 'one', 'where', 'friendship', 'kindness', 'rises', 'cruelty', 'injustice', 'Hence', 'kind', 'romantic', 'classical', 'sense', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'find', 'prison', 'US', 'where', 'guys', 'are', 'buddy-buddy', 'However', 'balanced', 'opinion', 'Roger', 'Deakin', 'masterful', 'cinematography', 'story', 'ultimate', 'message', 'hope', 'believe', 'Deakins', 'won', 'Oscar', 'work', 'venerable', 'cinematographer', 'collaboration', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'may', 'give', 'better', 'understanding', 'range', 'clear', 'Shawshank', 'range', 'damn', 'well', 'wide', 'open', 'ever', 'wanted', 'learn', 'cinematography', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'man', 'study', 'camera', 'work', 'life', 'scenes', 'are', 'ostensibly', 'void', 'life', 'masterful', 'work', 'black', 'white', 'light', 'color', 'one', 'major', 'components', 'Shawshank', 'powerful', 'psychological', 'tension', 'brilliance.Bob', 'Gunton', 'sanctimoneous', 'corrupt', 'Warden', 'Norton', 'Clancey', 'Brown', 'fine', 'performance', 'brutal', 'Captain', 'Guards', 'Byron', 'Hadley', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'Brian', 'Libby', 'jocular', 'Floyd', 'several', 'scenes', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'Brooks', 'Hatlen', 'are', 'heartrenderingly', 'emotional', 'Noteable', 'also', 'Hank-Williams', 'loving', 'Heywood', 'played', 'William', 'Sadler', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'first', 'film', 'role', 'Tommy', '.My', 'two', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', '1', 'scene', 'prisoners', 'drinking', 'beer', 'license', 'plate', 'factory', '2', 'final', 'scene', 'filmed', 'US', 'Virgin', 'Islands', 'are', 'images', 'stay', 'most', 'viewing', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'prisoners', 'are', 'made', 'free', 'story', 'existential', 'bleakness', 'are', 'colorful', 'alive', 'intended', 'show', 'redemption', 'realized', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'favorite', 'stuck', 'island', 'movie', 'story', 'hope', 'realized', 'matter', 'circumstances', 'possibility', 'redemption', 'injustice', 'futility', 'despair', 'story', 'wherein', 'kindness', 'belief', 'triumph', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'movies', 'human', 'spirit', 'best']",N/A

32838,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,0780623134,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[2, 4]","+++++This movie, adapted from Stephen King's short novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" can be summarized easily.  It tells the story of quiet banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been unjustly sent to Shawshank Prison to serve a double life sentence.  In prison, he forms a strong friendship with long-time inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (played exquisitely by Morgan Freeman) who, though he doesn't realize it, helps Andy escape after 19 years in prison.  Also, help for this escape is provided by Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, Rachel Welch, and geology!!But there is more to this movie--much more.  Even a wrongful imprisionment, a corrupt warden and a ruthless prison guard captain (played superbly by Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown respectively), and enemies within the prison (such as Bogs and his ""sisters"") cannot get the best of Andy.  Why?  His hope never dies.  This is the art of this movie: it perfectly paints a picture of a man who will not give up the only thing that can't be taken away from him--hope.This is also a magical movie since you are completely enveloped in Shawshank from the very first movie shot.  You experience a prison life composed of routine, after routine, after routine.  This is one reason the movie is relatively long: to get the viewer involved in this routine.  Also, the long length of this movie gets across the passage of time which is crucial to this story about patience, the squeaky wheels of justice, and the growth of a long-term friendship.All actors in their supporting roles do a fantastic job and some of these roles have been mentioned above.  Also, look for James Whitmore's heart-wrenching portrayal of Brooks, a very long-term inmate.Something else that should be mentioned is Freeman's narration as Red.  His voice when he is narrating seems to add to the movie.  In fact, I can't imagine the movie without his narration!Here's other things that you'll find in this movie: contrasts, opposites, unpredictability, humor, persistence, justice and redemption, renewal, and the importance of freedom.At the end of the movie, there is a double surprise ending.  These endings answer two questions: (1) How did Andy escape? (2) How does Red benefit from Andy's escape?Since this is an all-male prison movie, there is some violence and foul language.  But these are not gratuitous and add realism to the movie.This movie has many memorable lines.  My two favorites are as follows: (1) ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" (2) ""Hope is a good thing--maybe the best of things.""This is one of the few movies where subsequent viewings actually enhances its impact.  Why is this?  Because there are so many wonderful things on-screen that are presented to the viewer.The only minor complaint I have with the movie is that it sometimes can be unrealistic.  But this can be forgiven since the story is so engrossing.In conclusion, as mentioned Andy escapes Shawshank prison.  The viewer, however, will find the she/he cannot escape watching this powerful movie!!(1994; 2 hr, 20 min; widescreen)+++++",5,"Prison Escape Involving R.Hayworth, M. Monroe, & R.

32839,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,0780623134,Steve Douglas,"[2, 2]","No matter how many times I see this film, it never loses its power.  I have had the Standard Def version for a long time and just bought the Steelbook on Blu Ray. Glad I did.  It was up for 7 Oscars and, criminally, didn't win one.  I won't be redundant and go through a summary of the storyline and sub plots, discussions of the acting,book, etc.  It's been done so I will only focus on the quality of the transfer itself.VIDEO....The transfer to blu ray is as clean as you can expect it to be.  There were no artifacts or film stock dirt anywhere that I could see though I doubt if this is a complete remastering of the film.  The color grading tends to produce muted colors, often somewhat desaturated to match the bleakness of the prison environment.  Contrast on the Blu Ray has definitely been boosted and improved from what I can see comparing it to the Standard Def release.  Details in background scenes tend to be a bit soft but are razor sharp in many of the close ups.  Details in dark scenes are not hidden behind crushed blacks making for a good video transfer.AUDIO.... This is more of a dialogue driven film so do not expect much coming from your surround speakers or your sub.  There are some left and right foley from the front sides and the rears are used somewhat for that ambient echo of doors closing and cell bars sliding shut but that is about it.  The lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 audio does provide for a very clean and transient dialogue, easy to hear and understand even in whispering moments.  Lossless audio, even when the full theater system is not in use, still provides a much more transparent listening environment.EXTRAS...Can't say I have watched them all yet but there are plenty of good extras here.  I did watch the 1/2 'Hope Springs Eternal' extra and found it very interesting and moving as well. There is a great parody of Shawshank Redemption call 'Sharktank Redemption' that is a must to watch and is dedicated to production/film agent assistants. It's excellent.  I look forward to seeing the others. The trailer is also in high def and there is a comic spoof on the film which I have yet to watch as well as a collection of stills, storyboards and more.If you don't already own this film on Standard Def, why not?  If you do, get the Blu Ray anyway as it is well worth it and will remain an iconic film with legs for years to come.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.Thanks for reading.",5,"Shawshank Redemption, Blu Ray Steel Book",1368662400,"05 16, 2013",2013,2649,"['matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'film', 'never', 'power', 'have', 'had', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'long', 'time', 'just', 'bought', 'Steelbook', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Glad', 'did', 'was', 'up', '7', 'Oscars', 'criminally', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'redundant', 'go', 'summary', 'storyline', 'sub', 'plots', 'discussions', 'acting', 'book', 'etc', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'will', 'only', 'focus', 'quality', 'transfer', 'itself.VIDEO', 'transfer', 'blu', 'ray', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'expect', 'be', 'were', 'artifacts', 'film', 'stock', 'dirt', 'anywhere', 'could', 'see', 'doubt', 'complete', 'remastering', 'film', 'color', 'grading', 'tends', 'produce', 'muted', 'colors', 'often', 'somewhat', 'desaturated', 'match', 'bleakness', 'prison', 'environment', 'Contrast', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'definitely', 'been', 'boosted', 'improved', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'comparing', 'Standard', 'Def', 'release', 'Details', 'background', 'scenes', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'soft', 'are', 'razor', 'sharp', 'many', 'close', 'ups', 'Details', 'dark', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'hidden', 'crushed', 'blacks', 'making', 'good', 'video', 'transfer.AUDIO', 'more', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'film', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'coming', 'surround', 'speakers', 'sub', 'are', 'left', 'right', 'foley', 'front', 'sides', 'rears', 'are', 'used', 'somewhat', 'ambient', 'echo', 'doors', 'closing', 'cell', 'bars', 'sliding', 'shut', 'lossless', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', '5.1', 'audio', 'provide', 'very', 'clean', 'transient', 'dialogue', 'easy', 'hear', 'understand', 'even', 'whispering', 'moments', 'Lossless', 'audio', 'even', 'when', 'full', 'theater', 'system', 'not', 'use', 'still', 'much', 'more', 'transparent', 'listening', 'environment.EXTRAS', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'watched', 'yet', 'are', 'plenty', 'good', 'extras', 'here', 'did', 'watch', '1/2', 'Springs', 'Eternal', 'extra', 'found', 'very', 'interesting', 'moving', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'parody', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'call', 'Redemption', 'must', 'watch', 'dedicated', 'production/film', 'agent', 'assistants', 'excellent', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'others', 'trailer', 'also', 'high', 'def', 'comic', 'spoof', 'film', 'have', 'yet', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'collection', 'stills', 'storyboards', 'more.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'film', 'Standard', 'Def', 'why', 'not', 'do', 'get', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'anyway', 'well', 'worth', 'will', 'remain', 'iconic', 'film', 'legs', 'years', 'come.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfers', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'audio', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'decisions', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'type', 'review.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A
32840,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,0780623134,Steven Aldersley,"[3, 4]","The Shawshank Redemption sits at the top of the IMDB Top 250 with a rating of 9.2/10, so it clearly appeals to the majority of those who have seen it. It's also hated by some because they can't agree that it's the best film ever made. While I understand that argument, I find it difficult to believe that the haters can't respect it on some level. However, I don't care about any of that, I love the film.The story begins in 1946 with the trial of Andy Dufresne (Robbins) and we see him convicted for murdering his wife and her lover. The next 30 minutes shows him arriving at the prison and slowly adapting to life behind bars. Darabont uses a number of violent scenes to establish that prison life is somewhat brutal, but he doesn't dwell on it as the film progresses.This is a film about hope and friendship more than anything else. It just happens to be set in a prison. Andy befriends Red (Freeman), because he's a man who knows how to obtain items from the outside world. Their friendship and mutual respect is there from the start and develops throughout the film.Andy is an educated man and he finally attracts the attention of the most brutal prison guard in a memorable rooftop scene. The guard has inherited some money and fears that the IRS will take a big chunk. Andy shows him a way to avoid losing any of it. That single event is the catalyst for significant change in Andy's life. The guards begin to protect him and he's given a job which enables him to use some of his knowledge. He's well-liked by both the inmates and the guards.Warden Norton (Gunton) is one of the most corrupt men in Shawshank, even though he runs the place. He seems fairly harmless, but he's actually evil, greedy and dangerous. He provides the main source of conflict in the film.Andy strives to improve prison life for everyone, as evidenced by his campaign to win funding for the library. He makes the best of his situation at all times.The final 30 minutes of the film is extremely uplifting. Stephen King wrote the short story on which the film is based and his influence can clearly be seen. One of the things I like about King is the sense of justice present in his stories. If you think back to The Green Mile, you'll see what I mean. The Shawshank Redemption covers 20 years of Andy's life. Darabont wanted the final scene to be omitted, but the conclusion is still incredible.In the 18 years since the film was made, you've probably heard dozens of Morgan Freeman voice-overs. If you watch the film, you'll see why.One of the themes present in the film is how inmates can become institutionalized. Imagine being in prison for 50 years. How would things have changed in the outside world? It would be bad enough missing 20 years. Think about the advances made since the early 1990s. If you stepped out of a prison cell after 20 years, wouldn't you wonder why everyone walked around talking into their cellphones? You might light a cigarette and be arrested.I would recommend The Shawshank Redemption to anyone. You might not like it, but there's a strong chance you will. Robbins and Freeman are both superb. I watch the film twice a year and never tire of seeing it.",5,Hope is not a dangerous thing,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,3167,"['Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'top', 'IMDB', 'Top', '250', 'rating', '9.2/10', 'clearly', 'appeals', 'majority', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'also', 'hated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'understand', 'argument', 'find', 'difficult', 'believe', 'haters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'respect', 'level', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'love', 'film.The', 'story', '1946', 'trial', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', 'Robbins', 'see', 'convicted', 'murdering', 'wife', 'lover', 'next', '30', 'minutes', 'arriving', 'prison', 'slowly', 'adapting', 'life', 'bars', 'Darabont', 'number', 'violent', 'scenes', 'establish', 'prison', 'life', 'somewhat', 'brutal', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'film', 'progresses.This', 'film', 'hope', 'friendship', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'just', 'be', 'set', 'prison', 'Andy', 'Red', 'Freeman', 'man', 'who', 'how', 'obtain', 'items', 'outside', 'world', 'friendship', 'mutual', 'respect', 'there', 'start', 'film.Andy', 'educated', 'man', 'finally', 'attention', 'most', 'brutal', 'prison', 'guard', 'memorable', 'rooftop', 'scene', 'guard', 'inherited', 'money', 'fears', 'IRS', 'will', 'take', 'big', 'chunk', 'Andy', 'way', 'avoid', 'losing', 'single', 'event', 'catalyst', 'significant', 'change', 'Andy', 'life', 'guards', 'begin', 'protect', 'given', 'job', 'use', 'knowledge', 'well-liked', 'inmates', 'guards.Warden', 'Norton', 'Gunton', 'one', 'most', 'corrupt', 'men', 'Shawshank', 'even', 'place', 'fairly', 'harmless', 'actually', 'evil', 'greedy', 'dangerous', 'main', 'source', 'conflict', 'film.Andy', 'strives', 'improve', 'prison', 'life', 'everyone', 'evidenced', 'campaign', 'win', 'funding', 'library', 'best', 'situation', 'times.The', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'extremely', 'uplifting', 'Stephen', 'King', 'wrote', 'short', 'story', 'film', 'based', 'influence', 'can', 'clearly', 'be', 'seen', 'One', 'things', 'like', 'King', 'sense', 'justice', 'present', 'stories', 'think', 'back', 'Green', 'Mile', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', '20', 'years', 'Andy', 'life', 'Darabont', 'wanted', 'final', 'scene', 'be', 'omitted', 'conclusion', 'still', 'incredible.In', '18', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'made', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'dozens', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'voice-overs', 'watch', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why.One', 'themes', 'present', 'film', 'how', 'inmates', 'can', 'become', 'institutionalized', 'Imagine', 'being', 'prison', '50', 'years', 'How', 'would', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'outside', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'enough', 'missing', '20', 'years', 'Think', 'advances', 'made', 'early', '1990s', 'stepped', 'prison', 'cell', '20', 'years', 'would', ""n't"", 'wonder', 'why', 'everyone', 'walked', 'talking', 'cellphones', 'might', 'light', 'cigarette', 'be', 'arrested.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'anyone', 'might', 'not', 'strong', 'chance', 'will', 'Robbins', 'Freeman', 'are', 'superb', 'watch', 'film', 'twice', 'year', 'never', 'tire', 'seeing']",N/A

Not only the pinnacle of the prison film genre, it's one of the best films of all time. Everything works here: the screenplay is stunning; the performances flawless; it looks great, sounds great; and at 142 minutes it's perfectly paced. A film spanning two decades of developing friendship needs to be long, but Darabont unwinds his tale with such consummate skill that your interest never wanes. In fact, it keeps growing. He makes us feel for Andy, Red and their fellow cons, so their quest for dignity and survival becomes our own. The vignettes mix comedy and violence, striking just the right balance between hope and despair. It's never allowed to stray into self-indulgent mawkishness. For raw emotional power, the climax and denouement are almost unrivalled; and the themes of hope and self-determination will stay with you forever. If you can get your hands on a copy of Darabont's screenplay, read it. I picked it up the other day in search of a character's name.

For the Horror genre it was Psycho, for Action, Aliens and for Drama, it is the Shawshank Redemption. These films change the way we look  at movies. They raise the bar for how a film should be made. The film  queitly crept into theaters in 1994, and was overshadowed because of the  lack of blockbuster stars in the picture. But that didnt keep it from  gaining 7 academy award nominations. The film focuses on Andrew Dufresne  (played to perfection by Tim Robbins) as a convicted murder sent to prison  for the murder of his wife and her lover, a crime he did not commit. The  film takes no prisoners in delving into the hardcore realities of prison  life. At first, Andy has trouble fitting in, often resulting in him being  violated by other prison memebers and guards. But one day, he meets  &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman) who changes the way he looks at life. Red  has the ability to access things for people, and through this, the story  progresses. Morgan Freeman also does the naration along the way, which is  worth the price of the dvd by itself. The film could have easily been a  disturbing and hardcore look at prison life, and at times it is. But, the  main focus is hope, and thats what makes it so great. As you watch, the  movie starts to grow on you. No longer does this prison look to be such a  bad place. The film grows on you. Everytime you veiw it, something new is  picked up which makes it that much more enjoyable. The music and direction  of the film is remarkable.

32853,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,0780623134,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[0, 0]","In an era when Hollywood applauds idiocy, where movie heros shoot first and make funny quips later, where leading men crush beer cans against their heads, where, as one social critic recently put it, ""Stupid people are cool,"" this movie stands as a shining beacon. The Shawshank Redemption got made because a famous author wrote the story. If it had been written by John Q. Screenwriter, it would still be sitting in a desk somewhere, and if he were lucky enough to get to pitch it to a studio exec, he'd get the patronizing lecture about how things like this just aren't commercial material. As it is, it's a small miracle that a story with no love interest, no women (not even a woman to come home to, the timeless clich&eacute;), no sex, little violence (and none of it glorified) and no special effects made it to the screen. But it's a more audacious film than that. The movie dares to tell us that the mind is a beautiful thing, the most beautiful thing. Andy Dufresne doesn't survive by using his fists. He survives by using his intellect. Name me another prison movie where that happens.  Heck, name me another movie where this happens, period.There are few movies in existence where the ""egghead"" raises the bar of those around him, rather than lowering himself to fit in and be accepted. Yet the film tells us, without being preachy or pretentious, that the chessboard is mightier than the sword, that Mozart and Moliere can do more to rehabilitate the soul than solitary confinement and license-plate making. Ask yourself this: when was the last time did a movie play classical music and did not either denegrate it, or show how pop music is really more ""fun"" and ""cool.""Yet few reviews of the movie really delve into this fact: the Shawshank Redemption unapologetically glorifies the intellect. All the more ironic that it was triumphed that year at both the box office and the Academy by an ode to anti-intellectualism, Forrest Gump. While Shawshank advocated thinking through consequences and taking action based on planning, Gump said ""Don't Worry, Be Happy""-is it any wonder it took home the gold?  Forrest Gump fell into the comfortable Hollywood niche of ""just ask for little and you will receive plenty""-funny how Hollywood's own never seem to live by that philosophy.  Shawshank challenged people to be responsible for their actions and motivated to change their fate, regardless of the ""systems"" around them.But, as Forrest Gump also observes, ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know how it's going to turn out."" The Shawshank Redemption has been redeemed on home video, where it has become one of the most popular titles of all time. Forrest Gump has done okay too, but I suspect in 50 years' time, when listmakes are compiling the greatest films of the decade or century, Forrest will be forgotten, while this film will stand alongside masterpieces such as Casablanca, The Third Man and The Wizard of Oz-films that also received lukewarm reviews initially, by the way. As Red might say, some things just take time, a lot of time. It's a lession Hollywood will never learn as it starts filming its next dumbed-down idiocy coming to a theater near you and going to Christmas video just as fast.",5,A rarity among Hollywood movies--it celebrates the intellect,928713600,"06 7, 1999",1999,3225,"['era', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'idiocy', 'where', 'movie', 'heros', 'shoot', 'first', 'make', 'funny', 'quips', 'later', 'where', 'leading', 'men', 'crush', 'beer', 'cans', 'heads', 'where', 'one', 'social', 'critic', 'recently', 'put', 'Stupid', 'people', 'are', 'cool', 'movie', 'shining', 'beacon', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'got', 'made', 'famous', 'author', 'wrote', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'John', 'Q.', 'Screenwriter', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'sitting', 'desk', 'somewhere', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'get', 'pitch', 'studio', 'exec', ""'d"", 'get', 'patronizing', 'lecture', 'how', 'things', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'commercial', 'material', 'small', 'miracle', 'story', 'love', 'interest', 'women', 'not', 'even', 'woman', 'come', 'home', 'timeless', 'clich', 'eacute', 'sex', 'little', 'violence', 'none', 'glorified', 'special', 'effects', 'made', 'screen', 'more', 'audacious', 'film', 'movie', 'tell', 'mind', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'most', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'Andy', 'Dufresne', ""n't"", 'survive', 'using', 'fists', 'using', 'intellect', 'Name', 'prison', 'movie', 'where', 'Heck', 'name', 'movie', 'where', 'are', 'few', 'movies', 'existence', 'where', 'egghead', 'bar', 'rather', 'lowering', 'fit', 'be', 'accepted', 'film', 'being', 'preachy', 'pretentious', 'chessboard', 'mightier', 'sword', 'Mozart', 'Moliere', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'rehabilitate', 'soul', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'license-plate', 'making', 'Ask', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'did', 'movie', 'play', 'classical', 'music', 'did', 'not', 'either', 'denegrate', 'show', 'how', 'pop', 'music', 'really', 'more', 'fun', 'cool', 'few', 'reviews', 'movie', 'really', 'delve', 'fact', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'unapologetically', 'intellect', 'more', 'ironic', 'was', 'triumphed', 'year', 'box', 'office', 'Academy', 'ode', 'anti-intellectualism', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Shawshank', 'advocated', 'thinking', 'consequences', 'taking', 'action', 'based', 'planning', 'Gump', 'said', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Worry', 'Be', 'Happy', '-is', 'wonder', 'took', 'home', 'gold', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'fell', 'comfortable', 'Hollywood', 'niche', 'just', 'ask', 'little', 'will', 'receive', 'plenty', '-funny', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'own', 'never', 'seem', 'live', 'philosophy', 'Shawshank', 'challenged', 'people', 'be', 'responsible', 'actions', 'motivated', 'change', 'fate', 'regardless', 'systems', 'them.But', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'also', 'Life', 'box', 'chocolates', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'been', 'redeemed', 'home', 'video', 'where', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'titles', 'time', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'done', 'okay', 'too', 'suspect', '50', 'years', 'time', 'when', 'listmakes', 'are', 'compiling', 'greatest', 'films', 'decade', 'century', 'Forrest', 'will', 'be', 'forgotten', 'film', 'will', 'stand', 'alongside', 'masterpieces', 'such', 'Casablanca', 'Third', 'Man', 'Wizard', 'Oz-films', 'also', 'received', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'initially', 'way', 'Red', 'might', 'say', 'things', 'just', 'take', 'time', 'lot', 'time', 'lession', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'never', 'learn', 'filming', 'next', 'dumbed-down', 'idiocy', 'coming', 'theater', 'going', 'Christmas', 'video', 'just', 'fast']",N/A

32855,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,0780623134,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[2, 4]","Director:  Frank DarabontCast:  Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, Mark Rolster, James Whitmire, Larry Brandenburg.Running Time:  142 minutesRated R for language, prison violence, and sexual innuendo.Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.  Based on a short story written by Stephen King, the film begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins), victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis (Morgan Freeman), commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of King's equally noteworthy novella, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"". In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.  While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does employing the cunning Thomas Newman (who would later dazzle us with his score for ""American Beauty"") showing recognition for the film's needs of an emotional score; the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong seed to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.  This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich&eacute;s and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film, proving that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.",5,The Shawshank Redemption  (1994),1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,5323,"['Director', 'Frank', 'DarabontCast', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Morgan',

32856,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,0780623134,Thomas Glebe,"[5, 6]","This is easily one of the best prison/prison-escape movies of all time, but more, it's one the best MOVIES of all time, period.Set at a deliberate but never uninteresting/boring pace, the film tells of an unlikely, intelligent, passive, and innocent prisoner sent to a rough, rough place, Shawshank maximum security prison.  Run by a true sociopath warden who is a Bible quoting fanatic who practices hardly what he assumes to be in the position of preaching, he is as corrupt (or moreso) as the most corrupt guilty and abusive/animalistic prisoners he is in control of.  Tim Robbins has never been finer in a mostly dramatic role, and exhibits it throughout his ample acting talent.  Morgan Freeman, playing ""Red"" also has never had a better role.There are parts of this film that are quite difficult to watch, especially the prison-rape scenes, and scenes of the brutality and ""obtuse"" nature of the psychotic warden.  But they are all worth enduring, and very important to the overall concept of this movie, which is that there is something in the human spirit which is incorruptible and enduring, the sense of ""hope,"" the feeling that no matter how bleak one's situation and surroundings may be, keeping hope alive is essential to getting through the incomprehensible and obscene circumstances which Tim's character has to endure before his final reward, freedom.There are just so many good things about this movie, that it's hard to know where to begin or end.  The acting by all is superb.  The musical score is contemplative and powerful at times, and every situation and character is believable and seems well thought out and played consistently throughout.  Each scene has its own special grace and power, from the sublime and subtle.  Despite its length, this movie never bores, never becomes uninteresting in the slightest.  It moves along magically at its own speed, which is just about perfect given the subject matter.This is a story about trying to remain ""human"" in an inhumane place, and is almost existential in its various ways of pointing the importance of that concept out.  From the meek ""library"" keeper and his birds, to the scene where Tim Robbins KNOWS he's gonna be punished (in solitary, in the ""hole"") for his actions but he opts instead to treat himself and to the prison to some simple music, because some things are simply worth suffering for, to the final ones of ""redemption,"" everything clicks here, big time.Despite its length, when watching and re-watching (it's one of those movies you just have to watch parts of at least, time and time again) Shawshank Redemption, I feel tingles up my spine at certain parts and though I know the truly inspiring and touching ending by heart, it never fails to disappoint.  Every single scene seems so well thought out, not only from a coherent, reasonable, believable, and heart/mind tugging sense, but from an overall sense of ""human-ness"" which embraces the movie as a whole, start to finish.I can't recommend this movie enough to those who have not yet experienced its power, its grace, and its testament to hope, and faith, and belief that no matter what the odds, whatever the conditions we all may find ourselves in this game (sometimes very cruel and unforgiving) called life, keeping hope alive is or should be our first commandment.""Get busy living, or get busy dying,"" Tim says at a point when he's had quite enough of the vicious and barbarous circumstances he, an innocent man, has been made to suffer at what cost?  Damn straight.  Kudos to old-timer (and eventual suicide victim) James Whitmore as well, but every actor and every scene and every move in this excellent film is top-notch.This movie may not be for everyone, however, last I checked, it was RATED #2 (only behind the original ""Godfather"" film at the internet movie datebase website) as greatest film of all time.  While that may be stretching it a bit, there is little to quibble with here, and I wish it could've gone on for another two hours to tell the truth.A great, great, great, great movie.""I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.

32857,A30OXD42ZFYZLO,0780623134,Thomas Keneally,"[8, 8]","I have watched this movie more than a dozen times. Most of these people who have given bad reviews are due to their not liking Morgan Freeman's role. Well, this is a character actors' movie with the interaction between Freeman and Robbins. If these people cannot understand it, it is their problem. In my opinion, Freeman deserves an oscar for his role, it was fresh, original and beautifully done. Though Forrest Gump won a lot of the awards, it is my prediction that it will soon be forgotten. For instance, they have not announced relaunch of its DVDs, while there are 2 different versions of this movie that have been announced. You cannot watch that movie too many times, while this movie will soon become a classic (if it has not already become one, but that takes time). It is sad that people do not understand Morgan Freeman's breadth of acting. These people put it down to be the worst movie ever, it being boring etc, well that shows their lack of understanding of the movie. It is sad and their loss, as this is one of the greatest movies made. It was recently rated the greatest movie not to have won an oscar. If people wish to write an honest review, they should point out justified criticisms, instead of saying ""There is not a honest moment in the movie"". It is a travesty towards the others and most of us are intelligent, despite what these people think of us. Seeing the kind of movies and books that they like, it is obvious that they do not see eye to eye with the rest of us. Well, no one is asking them to watch the movie. My honest advice to the rest is please see the movie for yourself and make up your mind. This movie is rated #2 in the IMBD (Internet Movie DataBase), after ""Godfather"". No movie gets there by being silly, unintelligent or without good storyline, acting etc. It is a favorite for me, and I can proudly say that I know more about movies than these reviewers.",5,"Disregard reviews of Kyle, Delorean and Joe Shabdou",1096416000,"09 29, 2004",2004,1903,"['have', 'watched', 'movie', 'more', 'dozen', 'times', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'bad', 'reviews', 'are', 'due', 'not', 'liking', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'role', 'Well', 'character', 'actors', 'movie', 'interaction', 'Freeman', 'Robbins', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'problem', 'opinion', 'Freeman', 'oscar', 'role', 'was', 'fresh', 'original', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'won', 'lot', 'awards', 'prediction', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'forgotten', 'instance', 'have', 'not', 'announced', 'relaunch', 'DVDs', 'are', '2', 'different', 'versions', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'announced', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'will', 'soon', 'become', 'classic', 'not', 'already', 'become', 'one', 'time', 'sad', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'breadth', 'acting', 'people', 'put', 'down', 'be', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'being', 'boring', 'etc', 'well', 'lack', 'understanding', 'movie', 'sad', 'loss', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'made', 'was', 'recently', 'rated', 'greatest', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'won', 'oscar', 'people', 'wish', 'write', 'honest', 'review', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'justified', 'criticisms', 'instead', 'saying', 'not', 'honest', 'moment', 'movie', 'travesty', 'towards', 'others', 'most', 'are', 'intelligent', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'Seeing', 'kind', 'movies', 'books', 'like', 'obvious', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'rest', 'Well', 'one', 'asking', 'watch', 'movie', 'honest', 'advice', 'rest', 'please', 'see', 'movie', 'yourself', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'movie', 'rated', '2', 'IMBD', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'DataBase', 'Godfather', 'movie', 'there', 'being', 'silly', 'unintelligent', 'good', 'storyline', 'acting', 'etc', 'favorite', 'can', 'proudly', 'say', 'know', 'more', 'movies', 'reviewers']",N/A

32860,AUY5FSOVQMD3H,0780623134,"Tim Hill (""B.C."")","[6, 6]","This review refers to the one disc DVD edition of the film.THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, Mark Rolston, Jeffrey DeMunn, Larry Brandenburg, Brian Libby, Neil Giuntoli, David Proval, Joseph Ragno, Paul McCrane, Jude Ciccolella, James Whitmore. Score Composed By Thomas Newman. Director of Photography Roger Deakins (B.S.C.). Based on the Short Novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" Written By Stephen King. Screenplay Written and Directed By Frank Darabont. This Film is Rated (R) For Violence, Profanity, Very Brief Nudity, Sexual Content and Suggested Rape; 142m. 1994.WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Not surprisingly, this is a very powerful drama which has been adapted from the pen of Maine author Stephen King. I say not surprisingly, because this came from the same collected works which brought us the equally stunning ""Stand By Me"". King is not only a legendary horror novelist, he's also a staggeringly prolific writer of human drama, capturing each nuance perfectly and precisely and leaving room to bring those nuances easily to film. Director Frank Darabont pieced all the right elements into place to bring a faithful rendition of King's work to the screen (he would later do the same thing for ""The Green Mile""). The central premise is that of honest, forthright banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins) going to the Shawshank penitentiary after being convicted of murdering his wife. Protesting his innocence all the way, he remains determined to not let prison life crush his soul. He soon acquires a small group of friends on the inside, using them to support his idea of hope. Andy's inner light manages to touch everyone in different ways, not only fellow prisoners, but the guards and warden as well. His list of feats include (without giving away any real spoilers to the film) arranging a beer break for his friends while they tar a roof, building a better library at Shawshank, helping prisoners to earn their high school diplomas, doing taxes for Shawshank's guards and briefly (but memorably) bringing music into the lives of the inmates. The entire film has a tone of its own that closely captures the period between the 1940's and the 1960's. Adding to that tone is the sumptuous musical score by the always reliable Thomas Newman (""American Beauty"", ""Meet Joe Black"") and the stark cinematography by frequent Coen Brothers' collaborator Roger Deakins. The exemplary cast includes Morgan Freeman who not only brings his charm in front of the camera, but to the voiced over narration as well. Freeman turns in one of the best performances of his career (and that's certainly saying something) playing ""the only guilty man in Shawshank"", Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding. Even though this film came out a mere three years after ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" (in which he starred alongside Kevin Costner), Freeman appears to have aged twenty years...a necessary adjustment to make his character more believable. Tim Robbins, on the other hand, underplays his Andy Dufresne character in the early reels of the film, opening up only when one becomes convinced he's not going to show any true emotion in the entire movie. In some respects, that makes his character more enjoyable to watch as we uncover each separate layer of a very complex individual. Clancy Brown gives a wonderfully understated performance as prison guard Byron Hadley, a refreshing change from the outrageously over the top performance he gave in the original ""Highlander"" film eight years prior. The sleeper performance of the film comes from aging screen veteran James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlin. He can tell his character's whole story (fifty years of being institutionalized) merely with his haunted, sallow eyes. Still, the best moments of this movie come in the scenes shared by Robbins and Freeman. These two consummate professionals play off each other so beautifully that it's easy to forget this is only a movie and not an actual historical snapshot of two convicted prisoners. Ultimately this is a story of immense hope in a place where normally none is found. A genuine feel good film that will stick with you long after you've watched it.THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: This DVD contains a fair, relatively clean 1.85:1 widescreen transfer. A minimal amount of grain pops up from time to time but nothing overtly distracting. The grey, hollow tones of the film are accentuated, while the brighter moments tend to be slightly dust-colored. A fairly pointless 5.1 Dolby surround sound has been added which fails to fully immerse the viewer in its depths. The majority of the audio (with the exception of a briefly fascinating lightning storm) is reserved for the score, which tends to be a bit overwhelming in a few spots. The dialogue, however, is crisp and evenly separated while gunshots are upfront and brilliant to the ear. The background speakers are rarely utilzed, even where the score is concerned. There's also a French Dolby 2.0 surround sound as well as English and French subtitles, both of which are presented in drab coloring to match the feel of the film. The package itself is a wonderful recreation of the original video release cover, although it has been issued in an atypical Warner Bros. paper case. The disc has been painted with a display that features the lower half of the front cover, brought closer into view. The nearly two and a half hour movie has been broken up into forty chapter stops, a generous amount for a drama-oriented, slightly slow-paced film such as this. Bonus features for this disc include an enjoyable cast and crew information section which gives brief histories for Robbins, Freeman and director Frank Darabont. There's also a minimally entertaining production stills gallery, which showcases thirty behind-the-scenes photographs, and notations for the awards this film won upon its initial release. The only really meaty special feature is the original theatrical trailer (2:12). It's a neatly arranged presentation which spotlights the film's best virtues and captures the potential viewer's interest.THE YOLK'S ON YOU: Sorry guys, this is an early Warner Bros. DVD release. There aren't any hidden easter eggs I've ever heard about on this one.THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: For the raunchier viewer interested in the seamy underbelly of Hollywood's grand cavalcade, there's some slight nudity but none of it's the right kind. The only remotely interesting piece of sexuality comes during the opening credits of this movie when Andy Dufresne's wife (Renee Blaine) has her panties removed by her illicit lover.THE GORE REPORT: For fans who follow the cinematic blood trail Hollywood has left behind through the years, Tim Robbins gets a realistic bloody lip and the last gunshot wound inflicted in the movie leaves an interesting trace of blood, but that hardly qualifies as gore.SAY AGAIN: ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice really. Get busy living...or get busy dying."" - Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)THE FINAL SAY: No, I don't recommend buying this DVD. Warner Bros. finally got on the ball in late 2004 when they released a two-disc special edition of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". It contains a commentary track with director Frank Darabont, two documentaries, interviews from ""The Charlie Rose Show"" and more. That effectively makes this one disc release of the movie irrelevant.PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM: ""If I Didn't Care"" Performed By the Ink Spots.

Not that I haven't read plenty of both types from Mr. King, but this happens to be one of my favorites.Derived from a short story in King's &quot;Different Seasons&quot; collection (which also contains &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; and &quot;The Body&quot; which were adapted into the movies &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; and &quot;Stand By Me&quot;), Shawshank is one of the few cases where I can say that the movie was actually slightly better than its print predecessor.  Although I enjoyed the short story thoroughly, it is only a novella, and the movie adds significant breadth and depth that are lacking in King's narrative, as well as making the story more linear and chronological.  By making it less anecdotal, the story is much more cohesive, and Robbins' character arc is much more complete.Sadly, TNT has seized the rights to the film as a &quot;new classic&quot; and plays it ad nauseum, but it is well worth owning the unedited version on DVD.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins' acting is understated and subtle, and the supporting cast is impressive.  Shawshank is one of those rare films where everything just clicks perfectly, and all of the seemingly disparate pieces fit perfectly together to leave the viewer feeling as redeemed as the main character.",5,"One of Stephen King's Best, Brilliantly Adapted",1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,1596,"['worst', 'Stephen', 'King', 'horror', 'hack', 'who', 'ordinary', 'objects', 'supernatural', 'killers', 'terrorize', 'New', 'England', 'towns', 'crammed', 'people', 'dirty', 'little', 'secrets', 'best', 'King', 'writes', 'stories', 'Shawshank', 'Green', 'Mile', 'create', 'memorable', 'characters', 'humanity', 'more', 'focus', 'supernatural', 'Not', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'plenty', 'types', 'Mr.', 'King', 'be', 'one', 'favorites.Derived', 'short', 'story', 'King', 'quot', 'Different', 'Seasons', 'quot', 'collection', 'also', 'quot', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'quot', 'quot', 'Body', 'quot', 'were', 'adapted', 'movies', 'quot', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'quot', 'quot', 'Stand', 'Me', 'quot', 'Shawshank', 'one', 'few', 'cases', 'where', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'slightly', 'better', 'print', 'predecessor', 'enjoyed', 'short', 'story', 'thoroughly', 'only', 'novella', 'movie', 'significant', 'breadth', 'depth', 'are', 'lacking', 'King', 'narrative', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'story', 'more', 'linear', 'chronological', 'making', 'less', 'anecdotal', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'cohesive', 'Robbins', 'character', 'arc', 'much', 'more', 'complete.Sadly', 'TNT', 'seized', 'rights', 'film', 'quot', 'new', 'classic', 'quot', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'unedited', 'version', 'DVD', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'acting', 'understated', 'subtle', 'supporting', 'cast', 'impressive', 'Shawshank', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'where', 'everything', 'just', 'clicks', 'perfectly', 'seemingly', 'disparate', 'pieces', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'together', 'leave', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'as', 'redeemed', 'main', 'character']",N/A

Eighteen syllables.  Endless emotions.The work began as short story fiction which first appeared in a collection of four novellas by author Steven King.Different Seasons (Signet)- which contains the original RITA HAYWORTH AND THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and gave rise to three film adaptations from the pages within, (the stellarStand by Me, the limpApt Pupiland this film) - marked the starting line for this race, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION - starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in each actor's finest roles - marks the finish line.  But the race against time and tide that occurs across both formats has absolutely nothing to do with what the casual observer might suspect.  Contrary to what you might think, this tale has much less to do with a wrongly imprisoned man who manages a stunning and bold escape than it does with one simple ideal: Hope.  The story compels both the reader and the filmgoer to never give up on hope.Bettering the original text by miles, Frank Darabont's 1994 masterpiece captures and conveys the struggle, despair and - ultimately - the hope that exist at odds with each other in the life of wrongly convicted and (at first appearance) defeated Andy Dufresne.  The cuckolded Dufresne (pronounced Doo Frane - I mention this simply because when I first read the novella in high school, I could not for the life of me figure out how the pronounce the guy's name! - and played with a weariness and determination second to none by Robbins in all of his postBull Durhamglory) is arrested, charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the cold blooded, heat-of-the-moment murder of his Wife and her illicit secret lover.  All of this occurs within the first few minutes of the film, and following Dufresne's arrival at the upstate Maine, maximum security prison, we are off to the races.  What follows is a series of tests for the battle worn Dufresne; each subsequent hardship more brutal and vicious than the previous.  Yet all the while Dufresne holds onto the notion that hope will endure.  You see, Andy is an innocent man.  Don't believe him?  Neither does anyone else within the prison.  Not even his newest ""friend"", Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Freeman).  But Andy holds on.  And in time... prevails.Borrowing heavily from King's actual text, Darabont - who also penned the screenplay - moves the story into a tighter space.  Excising some of the characters (the numerous Prison Wardens of the novella have been spliced into one raging beast of a man, expertly played by Bob Gunton) and streamlining the narrative provide Darabont the means to bury the idea of fading but eternal hope straight into the heart of the viewer.  The basic premise is still present... in fact much of King's actual dialogue is used throughout the film.  But Darabont makes just enough changes to push the story in a more open and raw direction.  (The character of Red, for example, is a hard living, red haired Irishmen in the original story; Darabont cast Freeman and turned the friendship between the two main characters on its head.)I could go into greater explanation about how this film has affected me in a very deep and graphic way.  I could explain how the scene in which Andy, drenched in the new rain of freedom, arms outstretched to the heavens and standing alone as a free man for the very first time, sends chills down my spine every time I even envision it in my mind.  I could explain how the scene in which Red feels the need to beg for a bathroom break from his new ""Boss"" at the grocery store causes me to feel so sad for the lost soul that Red has become.  I could explain how the sad post script messages left by not only Brooks but by Red himself dug into the boarding house rafters bring on an insurmountable grief the likes of which I cannot define.  I could explain how the final pilgrimage undertaken by Red as he skips town and streaks southward on a Greyhound bus, reciting King's exact words along the way - ""I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.  I hope to see my friend... I hope to shake his hand... I hope."" - bring a flood of tears and goose bumps forward in my psyche.  I could explain how witnessing Andy and Red's final reunion on a sandy Mexico beach reminds me of the hope I hold onto that I too will have a similar reunion with my long deceased Mother in heaven.  I could but I won't.  And I won't detail more elements of the film as many here have already done so.  Besides, has anyone reading this not seen this film?  I doubt it.  What I would like to do, however, is to have the reader consider a different take on why this film is so moving and so important in the lexicon of Hollywood.This film is by far one of the greatest films to come out of the 1990's... a time when America was at war in Iraq - the first time around - and the stability of our hopes and dreams were in doubt.  Sure that conflict ended quickly.  But at the time, for many members of Generation X, (myself included) an all out Holy war seemed imminent.  Having survived the Cold War and the notion of immediate nuclear annihilation, (anyone remember the made for television movieThe Day After?) we were once again thrown back on our heels at the thought of further destruction.  Our hope was fading.  Perhaps Darabont sensed this when he optioned the rights to King's novella, originally published in 1982.  Or perhaps there were other more divine sources at work.  Who knows.  Maybe it just took that long to get the script up on its feet.  But whether it was Darabont, the Gods or just the ever present weight of time... this film came along right when we needed it to.  King's tale of hope is felt so deeply throughout the film.  This eternal idea that hope never dies.  Trapped by time and circumstances beyond his control, Andy chips away at a future free from the confines of cinder and steel.  So too did the rest of us. We just didn't know it at the time.  Andy's struggle mirrored our own.  The film provided a glimpse toward hope.Fast forward to 2001.  Steel came crashing down and fires surged under the ground in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.  Can you imagine a better time for the renewal of hope than September of 2001.  And again, along came THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  In 2004, the Tenth Anniversary Edition DVD dropped into our laps as a subtle reminder that hope springs eternal.  Sure, it came three years after 9/11.  But it also came along at a time when our hearts were beginning to heal and our minds were beginning to open.  And there it was once again, reminding us that good things never die.It is for this reason that I believe that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one of the greatest films of all time.  Showing us the path in 1994, and providing us a gentle reminder in 2004.  I am curious to see what 2014 will bring.  Curious and cautious at the same time.  But I know one thing that will be there regardless: Hope.  Because, as Andy himself writes in his last letter to his dear friend Red: """"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things... and no good thing ever dies.  I hope this letter finds you... and finds you well.""It is a credo that I live by and live for.  Hope.  And in a very real sense, every time I watch this film, hope springs eternal.",5,Hope springs eternal.,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,7348,"['Hope', 'good', 'thing', 'maybe', 'best', 'things', 'good',

My only advice in regards to enjoying the plot/storyline/etc is to read the novella by Stephen King first.  This movie adapts the book flawlessly, while keeping almost everything in tact.  When direct quotes from the book were used in the film, I started tearing up every time.Now about the Blu Ray.  Though I have yet to see a BD release that hasn't added a goodly increase in picture and audio quality from a likewise DVD release, you occasionally run across some that don't really improve that much.  With Shawshank, however, the improvement isn't just obvious, but an in-your-face smack of clarity that will even make the snobbiest blu ray fan's jaw drop open.From here I could go on to say how rich the blacks are and how warm the red tones look, but to be honest there aren't enough adjectives to properly describe the perfection of the quality.  ""Perfect"" is, I guess, the only one that comes closest.  This release shows exactly how the movie was meant to be seen.  It shows details and colors the way the director wanted them to be shown, it enhances movement, and blasts with glorious uncompressed audio.  It is, ultimately, a new release in that no one has been able to watch this movie at home with this much clarity ever before.  I cannot recommend it enough.Overall, this is a fantastic movie and a top notch blu ray release.  If you've never seen The Shawshank Redemption before, you owe it to yourself to witness a film masterpiece - but, I add, if you have never seen it before, you also owe it to yourself to read what is easily a masterpiece in the literary world as well.  Stephen King's short novella is more than worth reading, and at only a 100 pages you could probably read it in less time than it would take to watch the movie.And, of course, if you've seen it before, are a fan, or even if you already own a DVD copy, let me assure you that it is worth reliving all over again thanks to Blu Ray.",5,"Beautiful Movie, Phenomenal Blu Ray Transfer",1285113600,"09 22, 2010",2010,2064,"['know', 'movie', 'ranked', 'one', 'best', 'time', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'necessary', 'go', 'how', 'wonderful', 'only', 'advice', 'regards', 'enjoying', 'plot/storyline/etc', 'read', 'novella', 'Stephen', 'King', 'first', 'movie', 'book', 'flawlessly', 'keeping', 'almost', 'everything', 'tact', 'When', 'direct', 'quotes', 'book', 'were', 'used', 'film', 'started', 'tearing', 'up', 'time.Now', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'BD', 'release', ""n't"", 'added', 'goodly', 'increase', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'likewise', 'DVD', 'release', 'occasionally', 'run', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'improve', 'much', 'Shawshank', 'however', 'improvement', ""n't"", 'just', 'obvious', 'in-your-face', 'smack', 'clarity', 'will', 'even', 'make', 'snobbiest', 'blu', 'ray', 'fan', 'jaw', 'drop', 'here', 'could', 'go', 'say', 'how', 'rich', 'blacks', 'are', 'how', 'warm', 'red', 'tones', 'look', 'be', 'honest', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'adjectives', 'properly', 'describe', 'perfection', 'quality', 'Perfect', 'guess', 'only', 'one', 'closest', 'release', 'exactly', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'details', 'colors', 'way', 'director', 'wanted', 'be', 'shown', 'movement', 'blasts', 'glorious', 'uncompressed', 'audio', 'ultimately', 'new', 'release', 'one', 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'movie', 'home', 'much', 'clarity', 'ever', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'enough.Overall', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'top', 'notch', 'blu', 'ray', 'release', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'owe', 'witness', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'add', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'also', 'owe', 'read', 'what', 'easily', 'masterpiece', 'literary', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'novella', 'more', 'worth', 'reading', 'only', '100', 'pages', 'could', 'probably', 'read', 'less', 'time', 'would', 'take', 'watch', 'movie.And', 'course', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'fan', 'even', 'already', 'own', 'DVD', 'copy', 'let', 'assure', 'worth', 'reliving', 'over', 'again', 'thanks', 'Blu', 'Ray']",N/A

I think it's a fine movie in many ways. But as a writer and former reporter, I notice small details. Too bad the writers of the screen play and the director didn't notice these:1. The movie takes place in Maine, but ""down east"" accents are as scarce in it as hen's teeth. The ""bad guys,"" that is, all the prison staff from warden on down, plus a few of the prisoners, sound vaguely Southern. The warden sounds especially like a Son of the South when he makes his little speech to the arriving prisoners about the Bible. The movie seems to ridicule both religious beliefs and white Southerners by making the warden a smug, tyrannical hypocrite.2. The lead character was supposedly in the prison for 19 years. How likely is it that the same warden, and the same guards commander, would have been there that whole time (never mind with their appearance hardly changing at all)? I sure don't look like I looked 19 years ago!3. There seem to be a fair number of black men incarcerated in the prison, besides the Morgan Freeman character. I bet in 1947 there weren't as many black people in the whole of Maine as are shown in Shawshank.4. None of the prisoners seem to have any family whatsoever, nor any contact, ever, with an attorney. No visitors, period. I realize things have changed in prisons since the 1940s, but does it seem likely that they were totally at the mercy of the prison administration 24-7?5. Why did the parole boards routinely deny all petitions for parole? That is never even hinted at; I suppose all the members were just no-good so-and-sos who liked to see people suffer.6. When the wrongly convicted banker climbs out of the hole he has chiseled in his cell wall, he has to remove the poster of Raquel Welch to do so. He doesn't go back to replace the poster.

32891,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0780623134,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[20, 25]","""The Shawshank Redemption"" based on Stephen King's short novel ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"" finally gets the deluxe treatment. This 10th Anniversary edition has a beautiful, rich, vivid and sharp transfer. While there's some minor digital blemishes, it looks remarkably crisp with a faithful reproduction of the original theatrical appearence of the movie. Although some of the darker sequences are a bit murky, the DVD compression doesn't effect the look of the movie substanially.Tim Robbins plays a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover on circumstanial evidence and send to Shawshank prison for two life terms. He befriends Red (Morgan Freeman)while on the inside and begins quietly trying to rebuild as close to a normal life as possible behind bars becoming a good friend to Red's circle of friends as well. Most folks are probably familiar with this well written and directed movie so I'll skip any additional summation of the plot. Besides, to reveal more would spoil the pleasure of viewing this treasure.The first disc consists of the movie with a great commentary track from writer/director Frank Darabont. Darabont discusses the difficulties in adapting King's short novel and the challenges to translating literature to the screen. He also discusses some of the changes he made to King's novel to make it work better as a dramatic presentation and the challenges of casting, performance and location shooting. It's an enlightening commentary track that educates as much as it entertains.The second disc includes ""The Charlie Rose Show"" segment devoted to ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and features Darabont, Robbins and Freeman in a great discussion on the making of the film. It's clear that all involved enjoyed working together and that atmosphere carries over to the film that they created together. We also get 2 marvelous documentaries; the first ""Hope Springs Eternal: A Look Back at The Shawshank Redemption""  is a marvelous featurette that covers everything from what inspired Darabont to adapt King's short novel in the first place to the rigors of producing a film at an abandoned closed prison. ""Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature"" examines the powerful impact of the movie and features a number of prominent critics and individuals that both discovered this powerful movie when it played in cinemas and on home video. It's not as involving as the first featurette but does give a wealth of detail about the reach and scope of a work of art when it touches an audience in a unique, personal way.We also get the comic spoof of the film ""The Sharktank Redemption"" which is actually quite funny. I hadn't seen this before although you'll appreciate it best after having watched the movie. Storyboards, a still gallery and the original theatrical trailer are also included. All are of top quality.The Special Edition Boxed Set includes the BFI book published on the film. It's quite a good book and would be a great reference for film buffs. It's also got a wealth of insight some of which will be worthwhile to film students and hardcore fans of the film. On the other hand, the more casual fan will probably be quite satisfied with the two DVD set. The Special Edition Boxed Set also comes with the film's original soundtrack. The marvelous score by Thomas Newman doesn't have an isolated channel (my one complaint about this DVD)on the DVD so fans of the film who also like the beautifully written but restrained music by Newman will probably want this as well. Other than these two items (and a nice box) there's no difference between the two movies.Is this a great movie? It's a well made epic film that chronicles the redemption of two very different men that end up by circumstance becoming friends. Sure, it deals in some cliches but then so do all movies. It's used as short hand. What matters is that Darabont, like King, turns some of these cliches inside out for many of these characters. This isn't a film for those expecting the latest ""Jason"" movie but one that demands patience as it builds the characters over time. In many respects, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" reminds me of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life""; it's about missed opportunities and a second chance to try and live life to the fullest again.",5,Deluxe treatment for a terrific movie,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,4272,"['Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'novel', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'finally', 'deluxe', 'treatment', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'edition', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'vivid', 'sharp', 'transfer', 'minor', 'digital', 'blemishes', 'remarkably', 'crisp', 'faithful', 'reproduction', 'original', 'theatrical', 'appearence', 'movie', 'darker', 'sequences', 'are', 'bit', 'murky', 'DVD', 'compression', ""n't"", 'effect', 'look', 'movie', 'substanially.Tim', 'Robbins', 'banker', 'convicted', 'murdering', 'wife', 'lover', 'circumstanial', 'evidence', 'send', 'Shawshank', 'prison', 'two', 'life', 'terms', 'Red', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'inside', 'quietly', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'close', 'normal', 'life', 'possible', 'bars', 'becoming', 'good', 'friend', 'Red', 'circle', 'friends', 'well', 'Most', 'folks', 'are', 'probably', 'familiar', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'additional', 'summation', 'plot', 'Besides', 'reveal', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'treasure.The', 'first', 'disc', 'consists', 'movie', 'great', 'commentary', 'track', 'writer/director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'Darabont', 'difficulties', 'adapting', 'King', 'short', 'novel', 'challenges', 'translating', 'literature', 'screen', 'also', 'changes', 'made', 'King', 'novel', 'make', 'work', 'better', 'dramatic', 'presentation', 'challenges', 'casting', 'performance', 'location', 'shooting', 'enlightening', 'commentary', 'track', 'as', 'much', 'second', 'disc', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'Show', 'segment', 'devoted', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Darabont', 'Robbins', 'Freeman', 'great', 'discussion', 'making', 'film', 'clear', 'involved', 'enjoyed', 'working', 'together', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'created', 'together', 'also', 'get', '2', 'marvelous', 'documentaries', 'first', 'Hope', 'Springs', 'Eternal', 'Look', 'Back', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'marvelous', 'featurette', 'everything', 'what', 'inspired', 'Darabont', 'adapt', 'King', 'short', 'novel', 'first', 'place', 'rigors', 'producing', 'film', 'abandoned', 'closed', 'prison', 'Shawshank', 'Redeeming', 'Feature', 'powerful', 'impact', 'movie', 'number', 'prominent', 'critics', 'individuals', 'discovered', 'powerful', 'movie', 'when', 'played', 'cinemas', 'home', 'video', 'not', 'as', 'involving', 'first', 'featurette', 'give', 'wealth', 'detail', 'reach', 'scope', 'work', 'art', 'when', 'audience', 'unique', 'personal', 'way.We', 'also', 'get', 'comic', 'spoof', 'film', 'Sharktank', 'Redemption', 'actually', 'quite', 'funny', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'best', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'Storyboards', 'still', 'gallery', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'are', 'top', 'quality.The', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'BFI', 'book', 'published', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'reference', 'film', 'buffs', 'also', 'got', 'wealth', 'insight', 'will', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'students', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'casual', 'fan', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'also', 'film', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'marvelous', 'score', 'Thomas', 'Newman', ""n't"", 'have', 'isolated', 'channel', 'one', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'fans', 'film', 'who', 'also', 'like', 'beautifully', 'written', 'restrained', 'music', 'Newman', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'as', 'well', 'Other', 'two', 'items', 'nice', 'box', 'difference', 'two', 'movies.Is', 'great', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'epic', 'film', 'redemption', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'end', 'up', 'circumstance', 'becoming', 'friends', 'Sure', 'cliches', 'then', 'so', 'do', 'movies', 'used', 'short', 'hand', 'What', 'Darabont', 'King', 'cliches', 'inside', 'out', 'many', 'characters', ""n't"", 'film', 'expecting', 'latest', 'Jason', 'movie', 'one', 'patience', 'characters', 'time', 'many', 'respects', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'second', 'chance', 'try', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'again']",N/A

32903,A1TOML01ZYPUFR,0780623134,"Zachary S. Houp ""RAREfiend""","[1, 1]","Shawshank, externally, is nothing spectacular. There've been prison movies in the past; we can expect more in the future.  What makes Shawshank any different is that it puts magic--perhaps the most foreign of elements, considering the setting--into the film.  It doesn't break any new ground, and the story isn't particularly awe inspiring, but where this film represents a model for cinema production is that it shows that Heart is of more importance than glitz; in short, it shows the faults of Hollywood by doing the opposite.It is my favorite movie, because I am Andy Dufresne.  I bet every person who watches it becomes Andy Dufresne.  We all feel imprisoned and we want to get out, but Life, society, puts the bars around us all.  Andy is just unique enough to be the outsider, and just normal enough to be the spokesperson for a species.There is a joke in Shawshank: &quot;Everyone here is innocent; everybody knows that.&quot;  With the exception of &quot;The Sisters,&quot; I defy a person to show me a character in Shawshank who is a criminal at heart.  They may have done the crime, they are, of course, doing the time, but just which character in the prison is someone that a regular, &quot;law-abiding&quot; man or woman would be afraid of.  The inmates at Shawshank are no different than you or I.They are innocent men, caught in a cruel world; at the forefront is an innocent INNOCENT man driven down beyond what, for most, would be intolerable.  How can the viewer do anything but sympathize, when it is his own face he sees though the slats of the bars, whose own picture bares the bright, red words &quot;Parole Rejected&quot; on it.  You can't punish someone you love so fiercely.And then there is Hope, which takes a mind of its own in Shawshank.  People--you, me--have been overpowered before by what we consider to be the injustice of society, but we live on and live again.  For some, life ends in a cell--to live again is to break from prison or relinquish one's grasp of his own soul.  As we stand (Andy united), we hold on dearly for the soul, and we encourage our hero to do the same.  If he loses hope, so too shall we.What the filmmakers of Shawshank have created is Life, at its lowest--but only temporarily.  It contradicts what people consider right, wrong, good, bad, and leaves them with their inner villain, the prisoner we all harbor, the Andy Dufresne in anticipation for escape.  This movie is OUR release from all that we fear and all that oppresses us.  Watching yourself on screen becomes the most intimate cinema experience of a lifetime.

Andy is sent to prison for life, and thus begins his journey which is an uphill struggle all the way. It's a very moving film, told from the perspective of Red, another convicted murderer and Andy's best friend, whose first impression of Andy is that a stiff breeze would blow him over. As time progresses though, Andy's values of hope have an impact on Red who develops a better understanding and different perspective on things. When I first saw it, I was overwhelmed. It should have done way better in the oscars. This is one of the best films I have ever seen and would strongly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. I've seen it at least 400 bajillion times (much thanks to TNT) but wouldn't hesitate to pop in the DVD and watch it again if prompted. Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) are great. They play truly believable parts. Andy, Red, and the rest of the prison crew are people that you grow to like at an early point in the movie and you really hope that things turn out okay for them. When a filmmaker makes you really feel for the characters he's done his job. It appeals to every type of movie, it's suspenseful, it's funny, it's even romantic (in a friendship sort of way), it's just a great drama. The poor guy goes through so much just to get his freedom and to be right. You have to see it to believe it.",5,The Shawshank Redemption,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,1450,"['film', 'truly', 'masterpiece', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'were', 'great', 'delivered', 'perfect', 'performances', 'Andy', 'sent', 'prison', 'life', 'thus', 'journey', 'uphill', 'struggle', 'way', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'told', 'perspective', 'Red', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'Andy', 'best', 'friend', 'first', 'impression', 'Andy', 'stiff', 'breeze', 'would', 'blow', 'over', 'time', 'Andy', 'values', 'hope', 'have', 'impact', 'Red', 'who', 'better', 'understanding', 'different', 'perspective', 'things', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'way', 'better', 'oscars', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', '400', 'bajillion', 'times', 'much', 'thanks', 'TNT', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'pop', 'DVD', 'watch', 'again', 'prompted', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Andy', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Red', 'are', 'great', 'play', 'truly', 'believable', 'parts', 'Andy', 'Red', 'rest', 'prison', 'crew', 'are', 'people', 'grow', 'like', 'early', 'point', 'movie', 'really', 'hope', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'okay', 'When', 'filmmaker', 'really', 'feel', 'characters', 'done', 'job', 'appeals', 'type', 'movie', 'suspenseful', 'funny', 'even', 'romantic', 'friendship', 'sort', 'way', 'just', 'great', 'drama', 'poor', 'guy', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'get', 'freedom', 'be', 'right', 'have', 'see', 'believe']",N/A
