1660722,A14W8HXP3RM3ZS,B00DRQETNI,Jukebox Dave,"[0, 0]","THE NEW THREE STOOGES-COMPLETE CARTOON COLLECTION: Endlessly released, reissued and regurgitated during the DVD age, this animated version of every red blooded male's favorite numbskulls obviously can't compare to the original Colombia shorts with CURLY and SHEMP...or for that matter, not even the final full length flicks made with CURLY JOE DERITA. Although each five minute cartoon boasts MOE, LARRY and CURLY JOE's original voices (as opposed to the lame brained characterizations of the later ROBONIC STOOGES) and color live action wraparound segments, the storylines and animation are pretty pedestrian. The questionable quality of these prints goes with the territory of all public domain material, but at least this massive set includes all 156 toons in the series (although only 40 live intros were filmed) and a bonus cd of THE THREE STOOGES NONSENSE SONGBOOK and some cracked Christmas carols.

1660725,A1SA5D0QD4GZEI,B00DRQETNI,Raven Shaddock,"[9, 10]",Good news this is the complete set as you remember seeing on TV that includes the live skits in between the animation.Bad news the audio fluctuates from scene to scene. The opening theme song clip is loud. Then the live skits are low and the animation is a little louder than the skits but lower than the opening theme song. So you might have to find a happy medium for volume.It looks like they didn't clean up the footage just recorded as is. But this is rare to have and pretty sure no one else is going through the trouble of putting it together.No bonus stuff other than 2 CDs of Three Stooges singing children & Christmas songs.Added option you can view all the animation w/out the live skits or view the live skits w/ out the animation. I like to view them as I originally did on tv w/ usually Moe introducing the next cartoon. So if you are a Stooges fan like myself I think you'll enjoy it w/ some of the defects.This would of been 5 stars if the volume was the same level and would of been 3 stars if it wasn't The Three Stooges.,4,Complete Set but Audio Woes,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,1039,"['Good', 'news', 'complete', 'set', 'remember', 'seeing', 'TV', 'live', 'skits', 'animation.Bad', 'news', 'audio', 'scene', 'scene', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'clip', 'loud', 'Then', 'live', 'skits', 'are', 'low', 'animation', 'little', 'louder', 'skits', 'lower', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'might', 'have', 'find', 'happy', 'medium', 'volume.It', 'looks', 'did', ""n't"", 'clean', 'up', 'footage', 'just', 'recorded', 'as', 'rare', 'have', 'pretty', 'sure', 'one', 'else', 'going', 'trouble', 'putting', 'together.No', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'other', '2', 'CDs', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'singing', 'children', 'Christmas', 'songs.Added', 'option', 'can', 'view', 'animation', 'live', 'skits', 'view', 'live', 'skits', 'w/', 'out', 'animation', 'like', 'view', 'originally', 'did', 'tv', 'w/', 'usually', 'Moe', 'introducing', 'next', 'cartoon', 'So', 'are', 'Stooges', 'fan', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'w/', 'defects.This', 'would', 'been', '5', 'stars', 'volume', 'was', 'same', 'level', 'would', 'been', '3', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'Three', 'Stooges']",The New Three Stooges: Complete Cartoon Collection
1660726,A1AO0Z5F3UBSX3,B00DRQETNI,RB,"[0, 0]","I remember watching these cartoons in the mid to late 1960's mornings on WLS-TV in Chicago. There would be two episodes of The New Three Stooges mixed with two episodes of Roger Ramjet. I hadn't seen these cartoons since then except on a couple of five or six episode vhs collections. Could the quality of this release been better? Absolutely! As has been reported on here before Image/Madacy obviously did not have access to the original prints. There are plenty of signs of these being video tape transfers. I have also noticed the music on the ending credits does not conclude correctly. What this set does have going for it is that it is the complete collection and the colors are generally very vibrant and not faded at all. The bonus cd is also a nice little piece of nostalgia. Don't get me wrong, I really have enjoyed watching these cartoons again but I just couldn't give the set a five star rating because of the flaws.
