352705,A3CTUY8E7IWOSZ,6303046495,005,"[5, 6]","Instead of remaking good movies, Hollywood really needs to take B-movies that are filled with great ideas but fail to live up to their potential because of time and money.  There's just a goldmine of movies out there waiting to be tapped, and THE LEECH WOMAN is one such movie.  Think about it.  With the advent of the usually anorexic supermodels, this movie seems to apply to our society now more than ever.  LEECH WOMAN could've made for some dead-on social commentary, and to a certain extent, it does.  All of the characters, however, become completely unlikable, taking away from its impact.  Instead, the message comes out as &quot;Everyone is a scumbag or psychotic.&quot;  The relationships between the two couples (doctor and Leech Woman, their layer and his girlfriend) aren't fleshed out enough, so you don't really see how the two women are driven to violence.  I mean, it's easy enough when you see how they are treated to sympathize with them, but their reactions are too extreme and absolutely unnecessary, which makes them look psychotic.  And of course, all of the men in this movie are scumbags.  The movie does hit the right beats on occasion, and it certainly is memorable (e.g., the pineal ring).  In short, a great premise turned into a depressing movie due to missed potential and likable characters made so unlikable then given pretty terrible fates.",3,Missed Potential,1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,1375,"['Instead', 'remaking', 'good', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'take', 'B-movies', 'are', 'filled', 'great', 'ideas', 'fail', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'time', 'money', 'just', 'goldmine', 'movies', 'there', 'waiting', 'be', 'tapped', 'THE', 'LEECH', 'WOMAN', 'one', 'such', 'movie', 'Think', 'advent', 'usually', 'anorexic', 'supermodels', 'movie', 'apply', 'society', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'LEECH', 'WOMAN', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'dead-on', 'social', 'commentary', 'certain', 'extent', 'characters', 'however', 'become', 'completely', 'unlikable', 'taking', 'away', 'impact', 'Instead', 'message', 'out', 'quot', 'Everyone', 'scumbag', 'psychotic.', 'quot', 'relationships', 'two', 'couples', 'doctor', 'Leech', 'Woman', 'layer', 'girlfriend', 'are', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'how', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'driven', 'violence', 'mean', 'easy', 'enough', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'are', 'treated', 'sympathize', 'reactions', 'are', 'too', 'extreme', 'absolutely', 'unnecessary', 'look', 'psychotic', 'course', 'men', 'movie', 'are', 'scumbags', 'movie', 'hit', 'right', 'beats', 'occasion', 'certainly', 'memorable', 'e.g.', 'pineal', 'ring', 'short', 'great', 'premise', 'turned', 'depressing', 'movie', 'due', 'missed', 'potential', 'likable', 'characters', 'made', 'so', 'unlikable', 'then', 'given', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'fates']",The Leech Woman VHS
352706,AEBFU9QIDT9BT,6303046495,1960Fury,"[0, 0]","This highly under-rated film is one of my old favorites, an item which turned up on TV horror host shows in the 1970s.  It's interesting for several reasons:""The Leech Woman"" was absolutely the last of the horror films of old Universal or Universal-International.  After a string of popular '50s films like ""Creature From the Black Lagoon,"" ""This Island Earth"" and many others, the sci-fi/horror cycle was perceived as over by 1960.The film features an outstanding performance by Colleen Gray, who was an ingenue in the 1940s and continued acting into the 1970s.  Ms. Gray was expert and playing either sympathetic or bitchy types and she combines both aspects in her role here.  Another 1940s veteran, Phillip Terry (Joan Crawford's ex), plays her rotten, heartless hubby.  Few actors can pull this off without being either scary or laughable.  Gray and Terry's hilariously mean-spirited scenes together are clearly played for tongue in cheek fun and both skillfully avoid overdoing it.Estelle Hemsley as ""Old Malla"", Gloria Talbott as the nurse and Grant Williams as the lawyer each turn in excellent performances as well.  There are other pleasures, including scenes filmed in a gorgeous and rare 1958/59 Chrysler convertible.High point: Artificially aged June must make herself young and gorgeous again for her big date with her lawyer boyfriend.  Needing a pineal donor, she puts on her best furs & jewels, then goes slumming in search of a gigolo.  She finds one (Arthur Batanides) and goes for a drive with him, knowing he'll try to rob her or worse.  Their dialogue, as he ogles her expensive accessories and prepares to kill her, is absolutely priceless.The charcoal cinematography is clear and rich, the music is good and the plot, though grim, is interesting and original.  The special effects makeup for ""aging"" June are quite good and when I first saw the film as a child I gasped at the big reveal of just how much June had aged...just as the producers intended.Highly recommended for lovers of offbeat vintage sci fi and horror; or lovers of attractive hairstyles, clothes and cars.

352707,A3MTQQ5N6GOV23,6303046495,"Annaleise Ferreira ""Acolyte of Cthulhu""","[3, 5]","The MST3K episode was great, as we all know, but the movie itself is actually (and I don't say this often) not too bad. It does have some good messages, but doesn't make full use of them.The idea that society finds middle aged women to be hateful and deserving of death because of their lack of beauty is a good observation, but the movie also seems to support this idea by making the titular Leech Woman a villain, along with Mala, who also attains youth through killing. Old women are evil, as Mike says at the very end.I thought that Coleen Gray was quite good in her middle-aged role, she brought a real heaviness to her role. Rare in an MST3K movie, I actually enjoy her performance up till the point when she gets young. After that she loses something. She becomes a different character, just as Mala does, somebody less compelling. I didn't like Ms. Gray at all in Phantom Planet, for the same reason. She doesn't make a good temptress. Perhaps she tries too hard. But she seems very natural in her role here as a very lonely and self-loathing middle aged wife whose husband never loved her.",2,A woman made of gravy skins,1083024000,"04 27, 2004",2004,1098,"['MST3K', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'know', 'movie', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'often', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'have', 'good', 'messages', ""n't"", 'make', 'full', 'use', 'them.The', 'idea', 'society', 'middle', 'aged', 'women', 'be', 'hateful', 'deserving', 'death', 'lack', 'beauty', 'good', 'observation', 'movie', 'also', 'support', 'idea', 'making', 'titular', 'Leech', 'Woman', 'villain', 'Mala', 'who', 'also', 'killing', 'Old', 'women', 'are', 'evil', 'Mike', 'very', 'end.I', 'thought', 'Coleen', 'Gray', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'middle-aged', 'role', 'brought', 'real', 'heaviness', 'role', 'Rare', 'MST3K', 'movie', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'up', 'till', 'point', 'when', 'young', 'something', 'different', 'character', 'just', 'Mala', 'somebody', 'less', 'compelling', 'did', ""n't"", 'Ms.', 'Gray', 'Phantom', 'Planet', 'same', 'reason', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'temptress', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'hard', 'very', 'natural', 'role', 'here', 'very', 'lonely', 'self-loathing', 'middle', 'aged', 'wife', 'husband', 'never', 'loved']",The Leech Woman VHS

During the climax she was really hurt when Zinthrop throws the &quot;break-away&quot; acid jar at her face. The acid smoke-effects nearly suffocated her because there was no open mouth area, just two little holes in the nose area. When she fell out the window she had to enlist the men who caught her to help take off the mask and as a result, took off a bit of neck skin as well!
