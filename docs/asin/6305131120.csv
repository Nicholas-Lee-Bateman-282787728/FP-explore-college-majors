450357,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,6305131120,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[1, 1]","This concert dvd was filmed during 1987 or around that time. Most of the performances by Stevie & her band are simply outstanding, but some of the performances are not all that great. It is my understanding that when this dvd was filmed/recorded, that Stevie was addicted to cocaine and klonopin. Also, it's my understanding that after this concert dvd, Stevie checked herself in the Betty Ford Rehabiliation Center for treatment. However, I am not positive about those two things, but I can see that Stevie does act a little strange in this dvd.Stevie and her band do a fantastic job on ""Talk to Me"", ""Stand Back"" & ""Edge of Seventeen"". Her background singers are fabulous as usual. However, on the other performances, Stevie and her band are not so great.This dvd was supposed to feature guest artists, Mick Fleetwood & Peter Frampton, however, you don't get to see very much footage of either of them, especially Peter Frampton. The entire concert only lasts about 57 minutes. It seems like there was a lot of expectations here for a longer, & more organized concert than what it turned out to be. Stevie's lead guitar player Waddy Wachel even seems to be frustrated in this dvd. He tried to ""get down"" and really jam on guitars with Peter Frampton, but it only happened to a very limited extent.It seems there is just something lacking in this concert dvd. However, the good does out-weigh the bad, so I'd say it's definitely worth the purchase, especially for Stevie Nicks fans.

450358,A2FU48DTHMR0CV,6305131120,GoodTaste80,"[5, 5]","WHAT A CLASSIC! This is Stevie Nicks at her all time best onstage! TRUE Rock and Roll. Shot at the beautiful Red Rocks ampitheatre in Colorado on her 1986 Rock A Little Tour, the crowd is CERTAINLY enthusiastic about this performance. She opens with a powerful version of &quot;Outside The Rain&quot; which segues into &quot;Dreams&quot; beautifully, and then into &quot;Talk to Me&quot;, a number which she rarely does onstage because she says its difficult and draining - although she does a fantastic job with it. Tom Petty's &quot;I Need to Know&quot; is awesome, as is her single from the Rock A Little album, &quot;No Spoken Word.&quot; She treats the audience to a truly beautiful version of another rare onstage performance, &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot;, complete with a photo montage of Mick Fleetwood, who she wrote this song about. The best performance of the night, in my opinion, is &quot;Stand Back&quot;. Bobbye Hall, percussionist from Stevie's &quot;White Wing Dove Tour '81&quot; and &quot;Wild Heart Tour '84&quot;, gives an awesome opening before the synthesizers kick in and Stevie dances unlike you have ever seen her dance before on an extra long intro and guitar solo. She and her dance partner do a really great job, giving a really high energy performance. She closes with &quot;Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You&quot; - TRULY beautiful and complete with live white doves released at the end, a surprise for Stevie. One lands on her hand won't leave, which really touches her. She gives it to Mick and finishes with &quot;Edge Of Seventeen&quot;. Peter Frampton plays guitar on this one in an all too brief appearance. Personally, this was not the best performance of this song, as she painfully adds extra lyrics and literally screams through half of it, not keeping up with the medley. Although this was shot during the time that Stevie was overcoming a coke addiction, it DOES NOT diminish her ability to give an EXCELLENT and POWERFUL performance..well, minus &quot;Edge of Seventeen.&quot; All of the favorites from Stevie's solo band - the legendary Waddy Wachtel on guitar, percussionist Bobbye Hall, back up vocalists Sharon Celani &amp; Lori Perry-Nicks, are included in this performance. The lights and staging are superb. Keep in mind this was shot before Dolby Digital Sound, but the sound is quality. Typical 1980's close ups of Stevie singing that were recorded after the performance are also on this DVD and although it is &quot;totally&quot; 1980's with big hair and glam, it's one you'll watch over and over again!

For over 30 years, this lady has sold millions of records and sold out concerts, with Fleetwood Mac and as a solo artist. Yet some people still try to knock her. Let's put it this way: of her female(and male for that matter) contemporaries such as Pat Benatar, Heart, Blondie, and The Pretenders, who charted at #5 and sold 2 million copies to date of their latest CD in 2001 and had the #7 tour of 2001? Stevie Nicks. Who had the #1 world tour of 2003? Fleetwood Mac. While her former popular contemporaries(Many of whom I like a lot) play rodeos, cruise ships and state fairs, Stevie Nicks sells out arenas. Why? This concert video is a great explanation, especially during the end credits of Stevie shaking hands and interacting with her adoring fans. Both seem equally touched. Stevie isn't fake. She hasn't had her 10th face lift, upteenth botox injections or done the ""Cher"" thing. She has survived 30 years of rock stardom, kicked drugs, lost over 60 pounds, and kicked smoking. She doesn't try to be ""hip"", nor does she change her image the way Madonna(not knocking her) does. Stevie is Stevie.

I was inspired to revisit this concert after hearing the uncut bootleg of Red Rocks.  Man, did they clean up the vocals for this dvd!  Her voice was shot to the point that she talked quite a few of her lyrics or just let the girls sing them for her at times.  I've heard that the guy that edited the dvd said they couldn't show closeups of her because ""she looked bad"".  Next time you watch Stand Back, pause it where they show her briefly to the right of Frampton.  She looks so wasted I can't help wonder if she even remembers anything about that concert.  Also during that song, check out the way her backup singers are looking at her when she sings ""it's not all right"" rather than the actual lyrics ""it's all right"".  She was correct, it wasn't all right and I'm glad she quit the hard partying in the nick of time.  5 stars since I love Stevie Nicks and live footage of her during the 70s and 80s is scarce and I'll watch anything I can get my hands on from that period.

My mother was totally excited because they would be performing at the Pepsi Arena, here in Albany, NY, on Thanksgiving Eve ... so of course we went.  I was HOOKED from that day forward.  For Christmas that year my mother got me Stevie's greatest hits album, Timespace, and then I went from being hooked to being OBSSESSED!In 1999 I got the Red Rocks concert and I loved it.  Actually, at this point in my life, I was in the middle of losing 60 pounds, so every night for months on the stationary bike I would watch the show.Perhaps the only problem I might have NOW with the show is that not EVERY song performed that night in 1986 are included on the disc, like ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,"" ""Sara,"" and ""I Can't Wait.""  These probably weren't included for obvious Stevie reasons, being, for one, that ""Sara"" is a very personal song to her and she's always reluctant to perform it in front of people, not to mention that it, like ""I Can't Wait,"" turned out MUCH better on recording and didn't transfer to stage all that well.  But seeing that this Rock a Little Tour was the only in which she performed ""I Can't Wait,"" it would have made the disc more of a collector's item ... and thus a better concert.",4,A few problems ... but you can't deny Stevie ...,1094774400,"09 10, 2004",2004,1287,"['first', 'got', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'back', '1997', 'when', 'were', 'Dance', 'Tour', 'mother', 'was', 'totally', 'excited', 'would', 'be', 'performing', 'Pepsi', 'Arena', 'here', 'Albany', 'NY', 'Thanksgiving', 'Eve', 'so', 'course', 'went', 'was', 'HOOKED', 'day', 'forward', 'Christmas', 'year', 'mother', 'got', 'Stevie', 'greatest', 'hits', 'album', 'Timespace', 'then', 'went', 'being', 'hooked', 'being', 'OBSSESSED', '1999', 'got', 'Red', 'Rocks', 'concert', 'loved', 'Actually', 'point', 'life', 'was', 'middle', 'losing', '60', 'pounds', 'so', 'night', 'months', 'stationary', 'bike', 'would', 'watch', 'show.Perhaps', 'only', 'problem', 'might', 'have', 'NOW', 'show', 'not', 'EVERY', 'song', 'performed', 'night', '1986', 'are', 'included', 'disc', 'Stop', 'Draggin', 'My', 'Heart', 'Around', 'Sara', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Wait', 'probably', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'obvious', 'Stevie', 'reasons', 'being', 'one', 'Sara', 'very', 'personal', 'song', 'always', 'reluctant', 'perform', 'front', 'people', 'not', 'mention', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Wait', 'turned', 'out', 'MUCH', 'better', 'recording', 'did', ""n't"", 'transfer', 'stage', 'well', 'seeing', 'Rock', 'Little', 'Tour', 'was', 'only', 'performed', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Wait', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'disc', 'more', 'collector', 'item', 'thus', 'better', 'concert']",N/A
