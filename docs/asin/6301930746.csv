272943,A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ,6301930746,Blahblahblah,"[8, 10]","In the mid to late 1980s, about the only science fiction you could see on TV outside of original Star Trek reruns were Mad Max ripoffs which were all either brainless no-budget actioners or uninsightful downers (Mad Max is one of the top 5 imitated movies of all time).  I still automatically get a sense of revulsion when I see an ad for any movie with a sandy, post-apocalyptic setting.  In comparison to all these films, Blood of Heroes is second only to the Mad Max films themselves in quality.  In fact it seems to me that Blood of Heroes might have been made even if Mad Max never existed, so my rating might be a bit harsh, but I am a jaded.What makes this watchable despite having seen so many similar films are such things as good acting and interesting characters(especially Hauer, who is very likeable and you actually care about what happens to him) and a different than usual perspective upon post-apocalyptic, water and fuel starved society.  This film builds upon the idea that there would still be a need for entertainment and sports.Hauer and co. are members of a team in a brutal new sport (people die in every match).  Teams compete against each other to win resources.  Hauer is the team leader and weathered veteran while Joan Chen plays the new rookie.  The sport is well outlined and seems real. And it has more of the feeling of a sports film than films like Rollerball (the original -- I haven't seen the remake).  Unlike most sci-fi sports films it is not so much about rich people exploiting the powerless like the Romans did their gladiators, but about people trying to find empowerment through their sport and escape their humble origins, like Rocky (only there is no real great wealth to look forward to).Less jaded viewers might want to give this a try.",3,Surpisingly Good,1057881600,"07 11, 2003",2003,1784,"['mid', 'late', '1980s', 'only', 'science', 'fiction', 'could', 'see', 'TV', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reruns', 'were', 'Mad', 'Max', 'ripoffs', 'were', 'brainless', 'no-budget', 'actioners', 'uninsightful', 'downers', 'Mad', 'Max', 'one', 'top', '5', 'imitated', 'movies', 'time', 'still', 'automatically', 'get', 'sense', 'revulsion', 'when', 'see', 'ad', 'movie', 'sandy', 'post-apocalyptic', 'setting', 'comparison', 'films', 'Blood', 'Heroes', 'second', 'only', 'Mad', 'Max', 'films', 'quality', 'fact', 'Blood', 'Heroes', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'even', 'Mad', 'Max', 'never', 'existed', 'rating', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'harsh', 'am', 'jaded.What', 'watchable', 'having', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'similar', 'films', 'are', 'such', 'things', 'good', 'acting', 'interesting', 'characters', 'especially', 'Hauer', 'who', 'very', 'likeable', 'actually', 'care', 'what', 'different', 'usual', 'perspective', 'post-apocalyptic', 'water', 'fuel', 'starved', 'society', 'film', 'idea', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'need', 'entertainment', 'sports.Hauer', 'co.', 'are', 'members', 'team', 'brutal', 'new', 'sport', 'people', 'die', 'match', 'Teams', 'compete', 'other', 'win', 'resources', 'Hauer', 'team', 'leader', 'weathered', 'veteran', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'new', 'rookie', 'sport', 'well', 'outlined', 'real', 'more', 'feeling', 'sports', 'film', 'films', 'Rollerball', 'original', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'remake', 'most', 'sci-fi', 'sports', 'films', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'rich', 'people', 'exploiting', 'powerless', 'Romans', 'did', 'gladiators', 'people', 'trying', 'find', 'empowerment', 'sport', 'escape', 'humble', 'origins', 'Rocky', 'only', 'real', 'great', 'wealth', 'look', 'forward', '.Less', 'jaded', 'viewers', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'try']",N/A

You must be patient with it like ""Rollerball"" or ""Robot Jox"" to fully appreciate it's message and acting. It starts slow with the typical SciFi Apocalpyse that has made a wasteland out of what was once fertile. A small group of ""ruggers"" is travelling from dogtown to dogtown playing matches to get by. Now at first it is almost so depressing you may want to turn it off, but give it a chance. If you can hang with it past the first half hour you will see the movie truly is worth watching and the story and acting is pretty good. I must admit if not for the cast with Hauer, Lindo, D'Onofrio, and Chen I probably would have been less forgiving. But their acting keeps you interested.

My friends and I saw this back when it came out in theaters, and it worked well for what it was, a movie about a post apocalyptic sport where the goal is to put a dog skull on an opposing teams' post starring Rutger Hauer?  We were so there.  And we weren't disappointed.Rutger Hauer is Sallow, a once great player in the sport, made a mistake of getting too close to a woman outside his class, and is now reduced to playing matches outside of the system, in the rugged, barren, waste world.  His team of 'juggers' consists of five people, including himself.  There's Young Gar (Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio), Mbulu (Delroy Lindo), Big Cimber (Anna Katerina), and Dog Boy (Justin Monjo).  Each player has his or her own responsibilities, but the main goal is to protect the runner, as that is the player that handles the dog skull, and will ultimately decide the outcome of the game based on his/her ability to place the skull on the opposing team's post.  The sport is quite brutal, leading to severe injuries, and, sometimes, even death.  No penalties, no rules, anything goes.  Sallow and his group travel from town to town, challenging the home team, squeaking out a living.  The ultimate goal is to win enough games for the honor to petition the league to compete in the league, opening up a world unknown to many as league players are treated very well.  Joan Chen plays Kidda, a wannabe runner who gets into Sallow's clan when Dog Boy is injured.  Poor little Dog Boy...anyway, as she learns the ropes, Sallow's team advances, and finally collects enough dog skulls (victories) to petition the league.  What happens then?  Watch and find out...I enjoyed this movie, even though it's a familiar story.  The game, the players, the weapons, it was all very well thought out and the characters motivations seem simple at first become more complicated.  The end game will have you rooting for the underdog, even if you don't care for the movie itself.  I would have liked to given this movie another star, but I found the DVD presentation to be somewhat lacking.  Where's the clarity?  The most noticeable problems are with the darker scenes.  The definition was very poor, providing a muddled at best picture.  I am surprised Lions Gate couldn't find a better copy to put on DVD.  And since I saw this in the theaters, I know it was originally presented in wide screen, but not here.  And the sound is pretty poor.  At least you can view the subtitles, to see what is being said, but why should you have to?  A very disappointing release of a great movie.",3,"""Play hard, you'll forget the fear.

So was wondering if there was some kind of gay sub-theme going on in the film. Watched it again on late night TV and was surprised the action scenes aren't that bad.Considering the theme of Rutger Hauer being punished for having loved the wrong woman, and especially considering the way the sport Jugging is played, the 70's film Rollerball had to be a major influence on the film makers. Rollerball, starring James Caan, is a favorite of mine. In my review of Rollerball I compared it to the film The Running Man. Rollerball is an insanely too violent film, and this no doubt helped sell tickets, yet it has a theme of anti-violence. Blood of Heroes does not even pretend this bit of sophistry.

It is a no brainer action packed flic with little plot, but it is very engaging.What I have seen is the biggest dispute is over quality issues between the VHS and DVD.  Granted, the VHS is a better quality version, and yes, the DVD is terrible in regards to the brightness of the picture once the movie goes underground (really, you can't see anything it's so dark).  There is a simple solution, and that is to turn the brightness on your television all the way up.  Having done this, you'll find that the movie is bright enough so that you can not only watch it without developing a headache, but you'll be able to make out the finest details on the screen.  So don't let the quality of this print divert you from getting it.As for the movie itself I'll say a little.It's your typical 1980s post-apocalyptic film really.  Lots of desert landscapes filled with strange people, strange buildings, and strange customs, much like Mad Max.  Of central importance to this new society is its national pastime, a brutal blood sport where athletes called juggers beat the hell out of each other in a contest to impale a dog skull onto a spike.  It's like soccer if the Romans had invented it.The film concerns itself with one particular group of juggers and their attempt to compete against the League.  The League are the best juggers around who enjoy a life of opulence and leisure when they are not fighting in the vast underground complex called the Nine Cities.  Here, the movie is a lot like Rocky with the underdogs coming in to face the much more feared League, juggers so talented they have never lost a match.What this movie comes down to is some great one-liner dialogue, very well choreographed fight scenes, and some terrific set design, particularly in the Nine Cities.  The Nine Cities are dark, depressing, a life of turmoil and despair, a bit reminiscent of the futuristic scenes in Terminator.The end of the movie is one of the ultimate endings in the sci-fi action genre.  You really have to check it out.  Every detail just adds so much to the last bloody match where these juggers beat one another to pulp, chains are flying, heads crushing, meat being tenderized by multiple kicks and punches.  You just can't beat it.  It's like a darker version of A Clockwork Orange.So the Blood of Heroes is a lot like some weird hybrid of Mad Max, Rocky, Terminator, and A Clockwork Orange.

It conveyed more of the gladiatorial/ brutal nature of the game that is played, and the heroism of those who not just play it but survive it. Blood of heroes is such a nothing title for what is an extremely good movie.The DVD version is slightly different to the film (at the end- the DVD cuts before the 'movie' did). This actually improves the film I think.This movie is lean, fast and full of heavy action within the game field, but out of has a nice tenderness because of Joan Chen- she is both beautiful and powerful in the movie, sensual and brutal. And Rutger Hauer gives an excellent performance as the leader/guru of the team. The cast is strong and play their roles in a manner that individualizes them all and mimicks their in game personas.Okay this was no big budget feature, but succeeds all the more because of that. It's about a hard, brutal game played in a hard brutal world, where survival is tenuous and fragile, and the people barely subsist. The closeness of the film really emphasizes humanity there clinging together to hold on. The game is the epoch of civilization so the Juggers are revered. It is the thing that unifies them.This is a truly brilliant film because it steps outside of cliche and corniness and the typical hollywood drivel. The dialog is excellent and the action in the game sequences are first rate. There is no sentimentality.

A low budget affair, it really gets a lot for it's money.  The story is fairly simple, a team of juggers go from town to town playing other teams to then possibly challenge one of the great league teams that play in one of the nine cities that remain in this post apocolyptic world.  The game is straight forward.  You must get your runner with a dog skull through the enemy lines to place it on a stake.  It is very brutal however, with lots of action and blood.  The stories two main characters are a disgraced former league player who leads his team to challenge again.  Also, the girl runner or quick who wants more from her life that her squalid village can offer.  This is a great underdog movie, and you will find yourself caught up in the action.  The problem with the movie however is the dvd.  It is presented only in full screen.  It shows only one version of the movie.  There is a slightly longer cut with a differant ending out there.  Also the picture quality is very muddy.  In the daylight scenes it will get by, but when they go underground, it is very hard to see anything.  This is one film that needs a special edition.

272969,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6301930746,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 3]","The reviewers are right - this was a surprise, all the more so because it was about as pleasant a surprise as you can watch involving a brutal, post-apocalyptic future in which human existence has been reduced to a life of beating people up.  We don't know what's happened to the world, but it happened long ago by the time the story begins.  For most, life is a trial of bare subsistence in the sun-baked villages that dot the world.  The only entertainment is ""The Game"" (I honestly don't remember it having a name, and the story makes it clear that this is basically the sole form of athletic competition left).  The basics of the game are simple enough - one team must get something to the other side.  NCAA sanctioned competition ends there: you're blockers carry clubs or flying whips with bladed tips; instead of getting a ball into the end-zone, you're impaling a dog's skull on a spike; and in case the foregoing hasn't made it crystal clear, no degree of roughness is unnecessary.  Thus it's unsurprising that careers are short, and even the champs bear painful souvenirs of their wins.  Those lucky enough to win in the small villages win the right to take on the majors - ""The League of 9 Cities"" and thus have earned the chance to get clubbed, whipped-scarred and otherwise beaten to a bloody pulp by a higher grade of pro.  Joan Chen is an eager hopeful that first plays against the band managed by Rutger Hauer, then joins up with them.  Hauer is the team's scarred and venerable vet - and we get hints that he has already faced The League, if not played for them in the past.  Then...something happened.  As Hauer and Chen comb the land, they ready themselves for another stab at greatness.For a cinema inundated by ""Mad Max"" clones, BOH is actually refreshing.  There is no great evil or tyrant that must be taken care of.  There are no whammo scenes or great catchphrases.  Instead, the story starts with our ""heroes"" (yes, I know that they're not all that heroic) and stays true to their travails.  We get a feeling for this crude game that champions brutality, and are glued to the screens even as we feel that we should turn away (I always thought Joan Chen as sweet, though this flick reveals a determinedly Mike Tyson side to her).  I love the set design - the dried out villages where people try to survive and eke out some measure of entertainment.  I also loved the way the film displays the care the characters extend to their equipment (we're supposed to wonder about the many spikes that now-dried skull has seen; or about what soft and frilly things were once stored in the dresser that now carries the clubs and whips).The biggest star of the flick is the game itself.  It's a brutal game, but not really about brutality.  Chen's character starts out justifying the punishment she's subjected herself to - it's okay as long as the others were worse.  Instead, and in the flick's clincher line (spoken by one of the league's stars) we learn that the opposite is true: there's no end to the pain that a player will inflict - but none will hurt a fly for any other reason but to win.  The game, like the movie and much like life, isn't about finding out what went wrong or goes wrong every day on our world, it's about getting up after you've been knocked down, and getting that dog's head to the spike.",4,surprisingly sweet flick...about beating people up,1073865600,"01 12, 2004",2004,3331,"['reviewers', 'are', 'right', 'was', 'surprise', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'about', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'can', 'watch', 'involving', 'brutal', 'post-apocalyptic', 'future', 'human', 'existence', 'been', 'reduced', 'life', 'beating', 'people', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'world', 'happened', 'long', 'ago', 'time', 'story', 'most', 'life', 'trial', 'bare', 'subsistence', 'sun-baked', 'villages', 'dot', 'world', 'only', 'entertainment', 'Game', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'having', 'name', 'story', 'clear', 'basically', 'sole', 'form', 'athletic', 'competition', 'left', 'basics', 'game', 'are', 'simple', 'enough', 'one', 'team', 'must', 'get', 'something', 'other', 'side', 'NCAA', 'sanctioned', 'competition', 'ends', 'there', ""'re"", 'blockers', 'carry', 'clubs', 'flying', 'whips', 'bladed', 'tips', 'instead', 'getting', 'ball', 'end-zone', ""'re"", 'impaling', 'dog', 'skull', 'spike', 'case', 'foregoing', ""n't"", 'made', 'crystal', 'clear', 'degree', 'roughness', 'unnecessary', 'Thus', 'unsurprising', 'careers', 'are', 'short', 'even', 'champs', 'bear', 'painful', 'souvenirs', 'wins', 'lucky', 'enough', 'win', 'small', 'villages', 'win', 'right', 'take', 'majors', 'League', '9', 'Cities', 'thus', 'have', 'earned', 'chance', 'get', 'clubbed', 'whipped-scarred', 'otherwise', 'beaten', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'higher', 'grade', 'pro', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'eager', 'hopeful', 'first', 'plays', 'band', 'managed', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'then', 'up', 'Hauer', 'team', 'scarred', 'venerable', 'vet', 'get', 'hints', 'already', 'faced', 'League', 'not', 'played', 'past', 'Then', 'something', 'happened', 'Hauer', 'Chen', 'comb', 'land', 'ready', 'stab', 'greatness.For', 'cinema', 'inundated', 'Mad', 'Max', 'clones', 'BOH', 'actually', 'refreshing', 'great', 'evil', 'tyrant', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'care', 'are', 'whammo', 'scenes', 'great', 'catchphrases', 'Instead', 'story', 'heroes', 'yes', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'heroic', 'true', 'travails', 'get', 'feeling', 'crude', 'game', 'champions', 'brutality', 'are', 'glued', 'screens', 'even', 'feel', 'should', 'turn', 'away', 'always', 'thought', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'sweet', 'flick', 'determinedly', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'side', 'love', 'set', 'design', 'dried', 'villages', 'where', 'people', 'try', 'survive', 'eke', 'out', 'measure', 'entertainment', 'also', 'loved', 'way', 'film', 'care', 'characters', 'extend', 'equipment', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'wonder', 'many', 'spikes', 'now-dried', 'skull', 'seen', 'what', 'soft', 'frilly', 'things', 'were', 'once', 'stored', 'dresser', 'now', 'clubs', 'whips', '.The', 'biggest', 'star', 'flick', 'game', 'brutal', 'game', 'not', 'really', 'brutality', 'Chen', 'character', 'out', 'justifying', 'punishment', 'subjected', 'okay', 'as', 'long', 'others', 'were', 'worse', 'Instead', 'flick', 'clincher', 'line', 'spoken', 'one', 'league', 'stars', 'learn', 'opposite', 'true', 'end', 'pain', 'player', 'will', 'inflict', 'none', 'will', 'hurt', 'fly', 'other', 'reason', 'win', 'game', 'movie', 'much', 'life', ""n't"", 'about', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'day', 'world', 'getting', 'up', ""'ve"", 'been', 'knocked', 'down', 'getting', 'dog', 'head', 'spike']",N/A

The movie is about post-modern age where instead of gladiators, some people voluntarily play a very violent game. While the game shows graphic scenes of beating and some bloodletting it certainly doesn't engage in the over use of splattering blood. It is rather dour and it's hard to feel any connection with the players, even Rutger.

272974,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,6301930746,Zack Davisson,"[3, 3]","I picked this up on whim, basically on a ""buy two, get one free"" kind of deal, where I grabbed ""The Blood of Heroes"" as the freebie.  I figured it couldn't be too bad, and hey, Joan Chen in a post-apocalypse flick, along with Rutger Hauer...I was quite surprised at what a good movie it was.  Much, much better than I had expected.  The post-apocalypse genre has put out some really bad films, far more bad ones than good ones, so my expectations weren't too high.  ""Blood of the Heroes"" is essentially a sports flick, based around ""The Game"" which is a rough gladiator sport using a dog's skull as the ""ball"", so the actual setting of the film isn't too important. It could be Earth, it could be somewhere else. No details are actually given, nor are they needed.  All that matters is the sense of desperation, and the knowledge that excelling in this sport is the one thing that will raise the team out of the gutters and into the limelight and easier life of silk sheets and adoration.Aside from the simplicity of the plot, what really makes this movie stand out is the cast.  Rutger Hauer, of course, is a master at this kind of role, the world-weary warrior with an edge of nobility.  He is a man past his prime, simply trying to hang on to what he has, and regain the dignity he has lost.  The ever-lovely Joan Chen (The Last Emperor,Heaven & Earth) is a young upstart, full of talent and ambition and using both to buy herself a ticket to a better life.  Vincent D'Onofrio (The Whole Wide World) is also a young buck with just enough talent and ambition to come along for the ride, and maybe earn a little slice of the dream while he is at it.  All of them put in excellent performances, and raise the level of the movie to something much better than the script.It's too bad this DVD release didn't do justice to the flick.  The quality is about standard VHS quality, and it was clearly a rush job.  It is also a shame that this is the shorter, 91 minute cut of the film, rather than the longer UK release.  If you have a region-free DVD player, you would be better of getting a copy from overseas, which would be better quality and have the full film.",4,The Game is everything,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,2159,"['picked', 'up', 'whim', 'basically', 'buy', 'two', 'get', 'one', 'free', 'kind', 'deal', 'where', 'grabbed', 'Blood', 'Heroes', 'freebie', 'figured', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'bad', 'hey', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'post-apocalypse', 'flick', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'Much', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'expected', 'post-apocalypse', 'genre', 'put', 'out', 'really', 'bad', 'films', 'far', 'more', 'bad', 'ones', 'good', 'ones', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'high', 'Blood', 'Heroes', 'essentially', 'sports', 'flick', 'based', 'Game', 'rough', 'gladiator', 'sport', 'using', 'dog', 'skull', 'ball', 'actual', 'setting', 'film', ""n't"", 'too', 'important', 'could', 'be', 'Earth', 'could', 'be', 'somewhere', 'else', 'details', 'are', 'actually', 'given', 'are', 'needed', 'matters', 'sense', 'desperation', 'knowledge', 'excelling', 'sport', 'one', 'thing', 'will', 'raise', 'team', 'gutters', 'limelight', 'easier', 'life', 'silk', 'sheets', 'adoration.Aside', 'simplicity', 'plot', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'cast', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'course', 'master', 'kind', 'role', 'world-weary', 'warrior', 'edge', 'nobility', 'man', 'prime', 'simply', 'trying', 'hang', 'what', 'regain', 'dignity', 'lost', 'ever-lovely', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'young', 'upstart', 'full', 'talent', 'ambition', 'using', 'buy', 'ticket', 'better', 'life', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Whole', 'Wide', 'World', 'also', 'young', 'buck', 'just', 'enough', 'talent', 'ambition', 'come', 'along', 'ride', 'maybe', 'earn', 'little', 'slice', 'dream', 'put', 'excellent', 'performances', 'raise', 'level', 'movie', 'something', 'much', 'better', 'script.It', 'too', 'bad', 'DVD', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'flick', 'quality', 'standard', 'VHS', 'quality', 'was', 'clearly', 'rush', 'job', 'also', 'shame', 'shorter', '91', 'minute', 'cut', 'film', 'rather', 'longer', 'UK', 'release', 'have', 'region-free', 'DVD', 'player', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'getting', 'copy', 'overseas', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'quality', 'have', 'full', 'film']",N/A
