I watched the second half of it and was so moved that I had to buy it.  I hadn't bought anything from PBS in some years and I have many PBS works in my library, but I just couldn't resist after seeing this.  I didn't even know that I had only caught the second half until I got the DVD and watched it in its entirety.  Truly brilliant work on the part of Ric Burns.  I then ordered some of the DVDs of O'Neill's plays and saw first hand why the subject of this film was so admired.  This film does O'Neill and his work justice.  The readings of his plays from Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer, Liam Neeson and others are fantastic.  Jason Robards who performed in the original productions of some O'Neill plays says some great words on theater acting.  This is yet another great work from Burns.  Very moving and inspiring in its depth of exploration of such a powerful figure as O'Neill.",5,Great Documentary Film Making!!!,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,945,"['got', 'exposed', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'PBS', 'documentary', 'watched', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'had', 'buy', 'had', ""n't"", 'bought', 'anything', 'PBS', 'years', 'have', 'many', 'PBS', 'works', 'library', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'seeing', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'had', 'only', 'caught', 'second', 'half', 'got', 'DVD', 'watched', 'entirety', 'Truly', 'brilliant', 'work', 'part', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'then', 'ordered', 'DVDs', ""O'Neill"", 'plays', 'saw', 'first', 'hand', 'why', 'subject', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'admired', 'film', ""O'Neill"", 'work', 'justice', 'readings', 'plays', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'others', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'who', 'performed', 'original', 'productions', ""O'Neill"", 'plays', 'great', 'words', 'theater', 'acting', 'yet', 'great', 'work', 'Burns', 'Very', 'moving', 'inspiring', 'depth', 'exploration', 'such', 'powerful', 'figure', ""O'Neill""]",American Experience - Eugene O'Neill: A Documentary Film
959062,A10ODC971MDHV8,B000CNEQWI,John Farr,"[3, 3]","Built around the idea of what it costs in emotional and psychological terms to be an artist, Ric Burns's captivating docu-portrait is disquieting rather than celebratory, and ultimately quite moving. O'Neill's cathartic personal struggles, like those of so many creative minds, fed into plays like ""A Long Day's Journey Into Night"" and ""The Iceman Cometh,"" but exacted a hefty toll on the man himself. Kushner and theater director Brustein highlight what made O'Neill's unrelentingly savage moral vision so effective--and his technique unmatched--while Pacino, Redgrave, and Zoe Caldwell demonstrate why the finest actors always sought to interpret his works.",5,American Experience - Eugene O'Neill,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,659,"['Built', 'idea', 'what', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'terms', 'be', 'artist', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'captivating', 'docu-portrait', 'disquieting', 'rather', 'celebratory', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'moving', ""O'Neill"", 'cathartic', 'personal', 'struggles', 'so', 'many', 'creative', 'minds', 'fed', 'plays', 'A', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Night', 'Iceman', 'Cometh', 'exacted', 'hefty', 'toll', 'man', 'Kushner', 'theater', 'director', 'Brustein', 'highlight', 'what', 'made', ""O'Neill"", 'unrelentingly', 'savage', 'moral', 'vision', 'so', 'effective', 'technique', 'unmatched', 'Pacino', 'Redgrave', 'Zoe', 'Caldwell', 'demonstrate', 'why', 'finest', 'actors', 'always', 'sought', 'interpret', 'works']",American Experience - Eugene O'Neill: A Documentary Film

O`Neill was able to take the sadness of his family and create something of value, something most cannot do with such personal devastation. The interview subjects all add to the whole, there is not an ounce of fat in it. [It could have been twice the length to expand the focus to include more on the plays only briefly touched on.] As a portrait of an imperfect man who created great art, it is unique. I think the subtle but powerful score and the excerpts read by Plummer and others add up to a great impression/introduction to O`Neill, and I`ve watched this four times, and each time have been moved. If you are at all interested in the subject, get this dvd.",5,The saddest* documentary I know,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,851,"['*I', 'have', 'seen', 'countless', 'documentaries', 'nonfiction', 'T.V', 'programs', 'depressed', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'one', 'starkly', 'different', 'profound', 'sense', 'sadness', 'O', 'Neill', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'sadness', 'family', 'create', 'something', 'value', 'something', 'most', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'such', 'personal', 'devastation', 'interview', 'add', 'whole', 'not', 'ounce', 'fat', '[', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'twice', 'length', 'expand', 'focus', 'include', 'more', 'plays', 'only', 'briefly', 'touched', ']', 'portrait', 'imperfect', 'man', 'who', 'created', 'great', 'art', 'unique', 'think', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'score', 'excerpts', 'read', 'Plummer', 'others', 'add', 'up', 'great', 'impression/introduction', 'O', 'Neill', 've', 'watched', 'four', 'times', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'moved', 'are', 'interested', 'subject', 'get', 'dvd']",American Experience - Eugene O'Neill: A Documentary Film

From the day he was born, life on this earth was difficult for him.  This documentary explores his life from his early childhood to his forming years as a writer.  We learn how O'Neill's experiences shaped him as a writer that made him one of the most prominent american playwrights and eventually Nobel Prize winner for literature.At the end of this documentary, you may not like O'Neill as a father or a husband; but you will definitely find a path to better understanding of his craving for privacy and why he made both personal and professional choices that he did.",5,Biography of a literary giant,1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,689,"['internal', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'contributes', 'writer', 'talent', 'then', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'certainly', 'earned', 'rights', 'day', 'was', 'born', 'life', 'earth', 'was', 'difficult', 'documentary', 'life', 'early', 'childhood', 'forming', 'years', 'writer', 'learn', 'how', ""O'Neill"", 'experiences', 'shaped', 'writer', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'prominent', 'american', 'playwrights', 'eventually', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'winner', 'literature.At', 'end', 'documentary', 'may', 'not', 'like', ""O'Neill"", 'father', 'husband', 'will', 'definitely', 'find', 'path', 'better', 'understanding', 'craving', 'privacy', 'why', 'made', 'personal', 'professional', 'choices', 'did']",American Experience - Eugene O'Neill: A Documentary Film

Done in a quiet, introspective fashion, and aided by Brian Keane's hauntingly beautiful music, we are taken inside the life of a great writer and inside the workings of his great masterworks.  Extensive time is given - deservedly so - to ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"", his greatest play and one that, near the end of his life, brought O'Neill back home to his childhood.If you are a fan of O'Neill, you will enjoy this film immensely.  If you have not yet discovered his work, this film will lead you, as it did me, to seek him out.
