821912,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00022PYO8,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","We're on the Western Front in 1917 and the Germans have nearly finished work on a breakthrough secret weapon. This fiendish device emits high pitched, powerful sound waves that...I'd better keep this simple...destroy the sub-cleotic structure of an object's crone base, causing crystatin failure with subsequent nektonic surt degradation on a massive scale. This results in catastrophic softening of human flesh and brittle crumbling of metal structures and objects. At least that's how I think it works.If the Hun uses this weapon, it could change the course of history as we know it. There's only one man who can stop this madness...British Captain James Bigglesworth, ""Biggles"" to those who know him, adventurer, warrior, always there when things are the diciest, and yet driven by resolute honor. Biggles is the sort of man that schoolboys would look up to and who would devour the stories of his adventures. In fact, between the end of WWI and the start of WWII, British schoolboys did just that in tale after tale written by W.E. Johns.In this movie we discover something Johns apparently was unaware of. Some people, it seems, have time twins. When one of the time twins is in danger, his twin will be sent instantly through time and space to help. That's the pickle young American marketing hotshot Jim Ferguson (Alex Hyde-White), head of Celebrity Dinners, finds himself in. One moment he's worrying about whether the creamed corn looks like a dog's breakfast and the next he's running toward a downed British bi-plane in the middle of a blasted battlefield, with whiz bangs falling around. He rescues the pilot...who is Biggles (Neil Dickson). Only when Jim lands back to his own time does he get an explanation, from no other than Peter Cushing in his last screen role as the aged Air Commodore William Raymond, Special Air Force (Retired) who has quarters in 1A, Tower Bridge, London. Raymond was Biggles commander back then. He explains to Jim the phenomenon of time twins, something modern scientists still are only beginning to understand. More importantly, he explains the vital importance of Biggles' effort to locate and destroy this new German monstrosity. Biggles is aided only his loyal team made up of Ginger, Algy and Bertie. Facing Biggles is the might of the Hun, led by German fighter ace Eric Von Stalheim. Even though Jim's fianc&eacute;e, Debbie, thinks he's crazy, Jim prepares himself to aid Biggles. Of course, before long, Debbie finds herself back in time, too.The movie is absolute nonsense, but good nonsense in my opinion. There's no nudge-nudge by the director or the actors to let us know they're in on the joke. They play it straight, which makes things all the more enjoyable. Neil Dickson is just fine as the strong-chinned, resolute, resourceful, brave, honorable, dashing Biggles. ""I'll not put a bullet in your head, old boy,"" he says at one point to Von Stalheim, ""because that's not how we do business!"" Alex Hyde-White holds his own as the baby-faced but resolute Jim Ferguson, very much a creature of the 1980's who now finds himself bouncing in and out of WWI. ""It looks like this town's been nuked,"" he says to Biggles when they find themselves in the middle of a ruined town square. ""Nuked? What's that?"" Biggles asks. ""It's an American slang term. It means to overreact."" And Peter Cushing, looking even more skeletal than usual at 73 but still a commanding actor and reasonably spry, brings the same kind of utterly believable delivery to his lines that he gave to mummies, vampires and werewolves. It was good to see him again.Biggles was unfortunate in being released a year after Back to the Future came out. As a time-travel adventure it didn't compare and quickly faded. Still, it's a fine example, in my view, of an affectionate, stiff-upper-lip boy's own adventure. Biggles isn't a great movie or even a memorable one, but it's competently made and it's fun. That's not a bad epitaph for a movie.The DVD transfer looks just fine.

821913,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00022PYO8,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[24, 24]","The movie BIGGLES:ADVENTURES IN TIME is a rather odd movie to try and review. All logic says that the movie should be soundly panned - a low budget time travel movie about two ""time twins"" who bounce back and forward between 1980s New York and London and the Western Front in the French trenches of World War I whenever the other is in mortal peril.Though the movie has plenty moments that make you cringe - the `old boy attitude' of the British flyers in WWI, the dated fashions of the 1980s and some of the most awe inspiringly terrible dialogue and dialogue deliveries in recent years. Yet in spite of it all this movie also has a certain amount of charm and there are a number of times in which you cannot help but feel seduced by the Boy's Own adventure of it all.Drawing its inspiration from a series of Biggles novels by British author Capt. W.E. Johns, the movie is really the story of American celebrity dinners CEO Jim Ferguson (played by Alex Hyde-White). Following a visit from a mysterious elderly Englishman (played by Peter Cushing in his last movie), Ferguson finds himself transported back to World War One France where he meets British flying ace Biggles, whose Sopwith Camel bi-plane crashes nearby.It becomes apparent that Ferguson must help Biggles complete his mission to destroy a German sound machine, a technology that could lead to Germany winning the war (one wonders why Germany didn't simply build more than one). The young cast are quite good in their roles, the music is serviceable and there is some very nice biplane dogfight scenes between Biggles and his archenemy Von Stalhein.Faithful only in spirit to the Johns books, this movie was obviously meant to be the start of a franchise as evidenced by the ending, but that never transpired. This movie has its moments and for time-travel fans it will fill a nice couple of hours, but it's a movie where its parts are better than the whole.

821919,A1MHJTVNMPDBES,B00022PYO8,Ravyn,"[3, 7]","Biggles is based on an old British sci fi book or comic book series which was quite popular in the UK. A young American frozen food CEO, Ferguson, is suddenly, inexplicably transported back in time onto the French front lines of the Western front of WWI where he meets British flying ace Biggles, whose plane has been downed. After assisting Biggles, he's suddenly back in his NY apartment, but a lot worse for the wear which at least tells him it wasn't all some awful dream.An old British officer (Peter Cushing) then visits and explains that his suddenly traveling through this time portal back to 1918 France could happen again whenever WWI flying ace Biggles and his men are in trouble trying to complete his dangerous mission. Somehow the two men are linked. Ferguson dismisses all of this, but after suddenly getting wrenched through time again from the floors of a food trade show to the middle of an aerial battle with a German pilot over 1918 France, he's convinced he has to go to London, learn more about Biggles in order to help him complete his mission and end the time traveling so he can get on with his life and marry his fiance.Ferguson learns Biggles is out to destroy a German doomsday high frequency sound device which turns solid objects, including people, into dust. If he fails, the device could alter the outcome of WWI causing the Germans to win and, of course, the future/present day (the film was made in the late 1980s) would be dramatically altered.With a lot of humor and an appealing young cast, Ferguson, at the worst possible times (including right after getting out of the shower with only a towel around his waist) finds himself suddenly transported back to 1918. And Biggles gets a jolt when he's  transported with Ferguson to late 1980's London filled with Punk groups, and sees and flies his first helicopter.Aside from the humor, lots of danger and excitement with bi-plane aerial battles, and an appealing cast. I don't know if this got a theatrical release in the States, but the film has excellent production values, is shot on location in London (including the Tower hotel and Tower Bridge) and about rural England. Only thing I dislike is some of the rock music used during the helicopter flights.

821920,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00022PYO8,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","For those unfamiliar, the Biggles books were a long-running series of boys own style adventures about a WW1 British pilot (the series ran long enough to take in WW2, post-war secret service adventures and even a series of Kiplingesque prequels about his childhood in India), and terrific fun they were too. The movie was in development for more than a decade (at one point a hideously miscast Dudley Moore was mooted for the lead after hitting it big in 10) and the finished film looks like they finally just decided to make something, anything because they'd spent so much money in development.The end result is the biggest misconceived fiasco of a potential franchise until Working Title's 2004 Thunderbirds came along and turned a weekly sci-fi disaster movie series into a bad kiddie flick. So, to appeal to an audience with no interest in the series and to alienate anyone who was, the plot centres around an American TV dinner promoter who finds himself traveling back in time to 1917 to help his 'time twin' Biggles destroy a secret German weapon that could help them win the war and change the course of history. If that isn't bad enough, it comes with a woefully wrong score by Stanislas that sounds like a BBC Radiophonic attempt to do New Romantic via Kraftwerk, a complete absence of dogfights, poor action scenes, weak comic relief, lazy direction from John Hough and terrible writing (the 'love' story is related entirely as backstory by one of Biggles' sidekicks). Peter Cushing is fine in his last film role and the film does have one deliriously demented line of dialog - 'Get us out of here before they realize you're not a god, you're just an American!' - but is definitely best avoided.",2,The 'Thunderbirds - the movie' of its day,1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,1706,"['unfamiliar', 'Biggles', 'books', 'were', 'long-running', 'series', 'boys', 'own', 'style', 'WW1', 'British', 'pilot', 'series', 'ran', 'long', 'enough', 'take', 'WW2', 'post-war', 'secret', 'service', 'adventures', 'even', 'series', 'Kiplingesque', 'prequels', 'childhood', 'India', 'terrific', 'fun', 'were', 'too', 'movie', 'was', 'development', 'more', 'decade', 'one', 'point', 'hideously', 'miscast', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'was', 'mooted', 'lead', 'hitting', 'big', '10', 'finished', 'film', 'looks', 'finally', 'just', 'decided', 'make', 'something', 'anything', ""'d"", 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'development.The', 'end', 'result', 'biggest', 'misconceived', 'fiasco', 'potential', 'franchise', 'Working', 'Title', '2004', 'Thunderbirds', 'came', 'along', 'turned', 'weekly', 'sci-fi', 'disaster', 'movie', 'series', 'bad', 'kiddie', 'flick', 'So', 'appeal', 'audience', 'interest', 'series', 'alienate', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'plot', 'around', 'American', 'TV', 'dinner', 'promoter', 'who', 'traveling', 'back', 'time', '1917', 'help', ""'time"", 'twin', 'Biggles', 'secret', 'German', 'weapon', 'could', 'help', 'win', 'war', 'change', 'course', 'history', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'woefully', 'wrong', 'score', 'Stanislas', 'BBC', 'Radiophonic', 'attempt', 'do', 'New', 'Romantic', 'Kraftwerk', 'complete', 'absence', 'dogfights', 'poor', 'action', 'scenes', 'weak', 'comic', 'relief', 'lazy', 'direction', 'John', 'Hough', 'terrible', 'writing', ""'love"", 'story', 'related', 'entirely', 'backstory', 'one', 'Biggles', 'sidekicks', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'fine', 'last', 'film', 'role', 'film', 'have', 'one', 'deliriously', 'demented', 'line', 'dialog', 'here', 'realize', ""'re"", 'not', 'god', ""'re"", 'just', 'American', 'definitely', 'best', 'avoided']",Biggles - Adventures in Time
821921,A31U58HK83GUUB,B00022PYO8,"Walter Lutsch ""The Dark Knight""","[1, 1]","The story of Biggles starts with a British novelist (W.E. Johns)who writes a series of adventure novels starring James Bigglesworth, an ace British pilot during the First and Second World Wars.The novels were well recieved, and developed into an ongoing pulp magazine that published from the early '30s well into the '70s.The movie, Biggles: Adventures in time, was periled from the beginning. Cursed with a small budget and a rather dated script, many consider this movie to be just a B list adventure flick.I think differently.Though the special effects are lacking, and some of the lines are quite bad (even for an 80's flick), this movie captures a certain type of adventure you don't see too often.The script lacks, but the actors took their lines and made the best of them, giving rather unique performances that dispel your disbelief and genuinely intrigue. The music fits surprisingly well for an 80's adventure film, and many, loving scenes of British fighter planes dogfighting German warplanes help to put you into Biggles' world. The plot, as fantastical and outlandish as it may seem, flows really well and fits in with the 30's pulp adventure theme.In short, this movie is a bit of a trip back in time, to not only the 80's when it was made, but to the 30's when Biggles came into being. It drives you along in a thrilling and genuinely fun adventure that, accompanied by great acting and well scored music, delivers a great film to watch with the whole family.",5,Biggles: Pilot Ace and Time Traveler Extraordinaire!,1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,1475,"['story', 'Biggles', 'British', 'novelist', 'W.E', 'Johns', 'who', 'series', 'adventure', 'novels', 'starring', 'James', 'Bigglesworth', 'ace', 'British', 'pilot', 'First', 'Second', 'World', 'Wars.The', 'novels', 'were', 'well', 'recieved', 'developed', 'ongoing', 'pulp', 'magazine', 'published', 'early', 'well', ""'70s.The"", 'movie', 'Biggles', 'Adventures', 'time', 'was', 'periled', 'beginning', 'Cursed', 'small', 'budget', 'rather', 'dated', 'script', 'many', 'consider', 'movie', 'be', 'just', 'B', 'list', 'adventure', 'flick.I', 'think', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'lacking', 'lines', 'are', 'quite', 'bad', 'even', '80', 'flick', 'movie', 'certain', 'type', 'adventure', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'too', 'often.The', 'script', 'lacks', 'actors', 'took', 'lines', 'made', 'best', 'giving', 'rather', 'unique', 'performances', 'dispel', 'disbelief', 'genuinely', 'intrigue', 'music', 'surprisingly', 'well', '80', 'adventure', 'film', 'many', 'loving', 'scenes', 'British', 'fighter', 'planes', 'dogfighting', 'German', 'warplanes', 'help', 'put', 'Biggles', 'world', 'plot', 'fantastical', 'outlandish', 'may', 'seem', 'really', 'well', 'fits', '30', 'pulp', 'adventure', 'theme.In', 'short', 'movie', 'bit', 'trip', 'back', 'time', 'not', 'only', '80', 'when', 'was', 'made', '30', 'when', 'Biggles', 'came', 'being', 'along', 'thrilling', 'genuinely', 'fun', 'adventure', 'accompanied', 'great', 'acting', 'well', 'scored', 'music', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'whole', 'family']",Biggles - Adventures in Time
