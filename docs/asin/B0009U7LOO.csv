Screen legend Christopher Walken (Catch Me If You Can) steps into the wily feline's magical boots in this exciting live-action version of the classic Brothers Grimm fairy tale, complete with singing, dancing...and acrobatics!""A dying mill owner divides his meager wealth among his sons, leaving only his beloved cat, Puss (Walken), to his youngest son Corin (Jason Connery). Initially disappointed with his four-legged bounty, Corin soon discovers that Puss is no average kitty. In fact, the cat's a brilliant strategist who concocts a daring plan to win both the king's favor - and the princess' heart - for his new master!""The Cannon Movie Tale series of nine films has become nearly as popular among fairy tale enthusiasts and family film fans as Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre.

Overall, this was a fun romp of a movie, with a couple of creative little twists to the story.The ineptitude of the guards at Puss' first arrival is hysterical - all the guards and attendants were sleeping or inattentive as Puss waltzed right in with his gift. I was a bit disappointed in the size of the Ogre - I was hoping they would have used their CG skills to make him appear bigger, after all they did use the CG for the animals whose forms he took. When Puss challenged him in human form, the Ogre was not much bigger, so the effect was not as impressive. At least the actor who played Ogre DID try, even if his role was a bit comical at times.

912596,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B0009U7LOO,Monty Moonlight,"[22, 22]","Well, my favorite anyway. The legendary performer brings a classic French fairy tale to life in the Cannon Movie Tale, ""Puss In Boots."" The sole inheritance of a poor miller's son, Puss (Walken) leads the young man from sudden homelessness to the lap of luxury by using his cat-skill and wit and a pair of boots that make him appear human to all those around him. Together, Puss and his master deceive the king and confront a man-eating ogre in an effort to win the heart of a princess and the title of Marquis of Carabass!""Puss In Boots"" sits among the best of the nine wonderful Cannon Movie Tales, which are among the best live-action fairy tale films available to date. Sticking more closely to the original stories than the usual fare, ""Puss In Boots"" and the other Cannon tales mix in simple but fun-filled songs with fantastic casts and writing that blends realism and fantasy seamlessly. ""Puss In Boots"" may be less fairy and more tale than the others, but the clever story and magical and magnificent performance of Christopher Walken as the singing and dancing cat make it a must see! It's so terrific that these childhood favorites many of us remember from the Disney Channel's 1980's and early 90's glory are finally available on DVD (most of them at least). The DVDs include trailers (not sure if these films ran anywhere theatrically), and most (including Puss) are presented in fullscreen format. The Cannon Movie Tales are mostly family fun, though be warned that some can have their scary moments (for example, ""Red Riding Hood,"" my favorite, is done as a werewolf story that at times may be a bit frightening). The other Cannon Movie Tales, all of which I highly recommend, are: Rumpelstiltskin, The Emperor's New Clothes, Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Hansel and Gretel, Beauty and the Beast, The Frog Prince, and Sleeping Beauty. Those last two have not yet been released to DVD, and I have yet to see Rumpelstiltskin at any retail stores, though Amazon seems to carry it. I wish to get them all, but currently only own my favorites: Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Puss In Boots, and Hansel and Gretel. Fairy tale fanatics should own all these films, and I also highly recommend my top favorites, the Disney animated versions. Also, for a scarier version of Snow White, pick up the outstanding, ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror,"" starring the beautiful Monica Keena. More recommendations: Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre collection (also best known from the Disney Channel airings), Shrek and Shrek 2, The Slipper and the Rose (for a live-action Cinderella), Ever After (another live-action Cinderella), The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996), Peter Pan (2003), The Wizard of Oz, Return to Oz, and Rodger's and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1965) among others!",5,Christopher Walken's Greatest Performance!,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,2771,"['Well', 'favorite', 'anyway', 'legendary', 'performer', 'classic', 'French', 'fairy', 'tale', 'life', 'Cannon', 'Movie', 'Tale', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'sole', 'inheritance', 'poor', 'miller', 'son', 'Puss', 'Walken', 'young', 'man', 'sudden', 'homelessness', 'lap', 'luxury', 'using', 'cat-skill', 'wit', 'pair', 'boots', 'make', 'appear', 'human', 'Together', 'Puss', 'master', 'deceive', 'king', 'confront', 'man-eating', 'ogre', 'effort', 'win', 'heart', 'princess', 'title', 'Marquis', 'Carabass', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'best', 'nine', 'wonderful', 'Cannon', 'Movie', 'Tales', 'are', 'best', 'live-action', 'fairy', 'tale', 'films', 'available', 'date', 'Sticking', 'more', 'closely', 'original', 'stories', 'usual', 'fare', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'other', 'Cannon', 'tales', 'mix', 'simple', 'fun-filled', 'songs', 'fantastic', 'casts', 'writing', 'realism', 'fantasy', 'seamlessly', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'fairy', 'more', 'tale', 'others', 'clever', 'story', 'magical', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'singing', 'dancing', 'cat', 'make', 'must', 'see', 'so', 'terrific', 'childhood', 'many', 'remember', 'Disney', 'Channel', '1980', 'early', '90', 'glory', 'are', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'most', 'least', 'DVDs', 'include', 'trailers', 'not', 'sure', 'films', 'ran', 'anywhere', 'theatrically', 'most', 'including', 'Puss', 'are', 'presented', 'fullscreen', 'format', 'Cannon', 'Movie', 'Tales', 'are', 'mostly', 'family', 'fun', 'though', 'be', 'warned', 'can', 'have', 'scary', 'moments', 'example', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'favorite', 'done', 'werewolf', 'story', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'frightening', 'other', 'Cannon', 'Movie', 'Tales', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'Rumpelstiltskin', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Clothes', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Snow', 'White', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Frog', 'Prince', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'last', 'two', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Rumpelstiltskin', 'retail', 'stores', 'Amazon', 'carry', 'wish', 'get', 'currently', 'only', 'own', 'favorites', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Snow', 'White', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Fairy', 'tale', 'fanatics', 'should', 'own', 'films', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'top', 'favorites', 'Disney', 'animated', 'versions', 'Also', 'scarier', 'version', 'Snow', 'White', 'pick', 'up', 'outstanding', 'Snow', 'White', 'Tale', 'Terror', 'starring', 'beautiful', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'More', 'recommendations', 'Shelley', 'Duvall', 'Faerie', 'Tale', 'Theatre', 'collection', 'also', 'best', 'known', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'airings', 'Shrek', 'Shrek', '2', 'Slipper', 'Rose', 'live-action', 'Cinderella', 'Ever', 'live-action', 'Cinderella', 'Adventures', 'Pinocchio', '1996', 'Peter', 'Pan', '2003', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Return', 'Oz', 'Rodger', 'Hammerstein', 'Cinderella', '1965', 'others']",Puss in Boots
