I even thought it a bit on the slow side. However, that is more the UK point of view, very understated.  What this serves to do is to make it all the more horrifying as we are drawn into a horrific multi auto collision on a UK ""interstate"" highway.  You are almost jolted out of your seat with the collision impacts intruding into the quiet buildup.The lead detective is also deceptively quiet.  He too seems very bland until his entire demeanor can shift in an eyeblink.  When he becomes passionate about something or someone, his entire physical being shifts from bland and unnoticeable to arresting and attractive.  His blue eyes truly do blaze!What must be done in this case is to trace every aspect of the collision, including every person.  The police department is sued by one of the decedent's fathers so it is especially crucial to get it right.  Much to my surprise, I learned that the police had bagged everything on the ground for a considerable perimeter around the collision and to solve just one aspect of the case we see our detective in a room filled with baggies looking for anything incriminating.  It is the necessary, tedious part of investigative work.  He does indeed solve one of the cases by going through the baggie room.I highly recommend this series.

Bottom line - watch this show on PBS but DO NOT buy the DVD b/c it is perhaps formatted in the worst way possible. For $24.99 on amazon it is expensive for the VERY CRAPPY DVD transfer. Just to clarify - excellent drama (5 stars) and I caught the last bit of episode 1 on TV (PBS) - looked great - not hi-res but just fine to view - crisp, clear images/ filming. I ran out to our local DVD rental place, rather than buying it on Amazon and discovered, to my horror (and relief that I had not bought it), they had used a not too bright individual to create the DVD. Instead of worrying about censoring the word ***k I think time and money would have been better spent getting the transfer to DVD right.Aside from the censoring that goes along with the DVD, which I think is flat out stupid I am hard pressed to believe this is a 2009 production that was transferred to DVD. When watching on a Hi-def screen played through an HDMI connection it shows up like  a ~32"" picture surrounded by black borders. So, I think what happened is they decided to down res the PAL (UK format) to NTSC and then for whatever reason a blu-ray player upreses it in the truly bizarre format.

She and her former flame DI John Tolin (Douglas Henshall) work together uneasily to put the pieces of the smash-up together. This turns out to be a lot more intricate and entertaining than I expected.A mild-mannered piano teacher named Sidney Norris (David Bamber) lost control of his car, causing a car driven on a clandestine errand by Karen Donnelly (Claire Rushbrook) to smash into him. A van bringing furniture from the Netherlands, driven by Daniel Rampton (Dean Lennox Kelly), runs into them and is catapulted over the median, where it is hit by a BMW carrying a young couple en route to the woman's 23rd birthday party, with a police car in pursuit. Then Brian Edwards (Phil Davis), driving his complaining mother-in-law, runs into them, as do wealthy executive Richard Reeves (Paul McGann) and his driver. Then Daniel disappears after the police arrive on the scene.It's all quite contrived, as the accident is connected to no fewer than 4 crimes. That's a high crimes-per-vehicle ratio, but none of the crimes seem implausible in themselves. Reactions seem realistic. It's not just a bunch of melodramatic backstories. The script by Anthony Horowitz and Michael A. Walker is packed with intrigue but down-to-earth at the same time. Director Marc Evans has the film jumping around in time a lot, starting after the accident and then going back weeks, days, hours, but not in that order. It can be a little confusing, but more is revealed about the accident with every jump.

1286414,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B002SAJ6E6,Stephanie De Pue,"[5, 6]","""Collision,"" an excellent British mystery/police procedural television series, was made by ITV, for its independent television stations.  It is to be released as a DVD by Public Broadcasting Systems Direct after its recent debut on PBS stations.  It consists of approximately 210 minutes, and comes bearing welcome subtitles.  It concerns a Friday 5:57 PM rush hour, six-car collision on Great Britain's busy A12 near Chelmsford, Essex, in the vicinity of London,  that has left two dead on the scene and two critically wounded, with further deaths to come.And it's quite unusual for a British mystery, in that the mystery to be investigated will be this major automotive crash, on which  Detective Inspector John Tolin (Douglas Henshall --Twice Upon a Yesterday) will be assigned, after a lengthy leave of absence, to work with his former lover, Senior Investigating Officer Ann Stallwood (Kate Ashfield --Shaun of the Dead).  It has a large cast, is complex and suspenseful, and, furthermore, is consistently intellectually challenging, relying on none of the lazy plotting you might see in a similarly-themed American TV production.  It has also been well filmed, on location, with the typical first-class British production values, and mise en scene, with no stinting on cast, supporting characters, extras, cars, or interiors.It appears that a quiet, little-known piano teacher, Sidney Norris (David Bamber) initially loses control of his car.  Thereafter, personal assistant (P.A.). Karen Donnelly (Claire Rushbrook), on a secretive errand, smashes into him. Next up, Daniel Rampton (Dean Lennox Kelly)in a van bringing furniture from the Netherlands, runs into them and jumps the median.  Whereupon Rampton is hit by a handsome young black couple in a silver BMW, speeding en route to the woman's 23rd birthday party, with a police car in hot pursuit. Then Brian Edwards (Phil Davis), who is driving his difficult mother-in-law (Sylvia Syms --Born to Win) in his SUV, on another somewhat shadowy errand, runs into them, as does wealthy executive Richard Reeves (Paul McGann), in his chauffeur-driven limousine.  Finally, after the police arrive on the scene, Rampton flees it.You would think this production must bear some relation to the 2007 American Oscar WinnerCrash.  But, aside from the fact that both center on fatal, multi-car crashes near major cities - ""Crash"" is set near Los Angeles--the resemblance is surprisingly little.  Perhaps most obviously, while many of the large British cast come bearing familiar faces, the British TV production boasts no real stars, whereas the large cast of the American theatrical movie ""Crash"" is star-laden.  The largest difference, however, must be in the reputed preachy, clich&eacute;-ridden nature of Paul Haggis's American film, which I have avoided seeing, versus the many-layered, cool intellectual risk-taking of the British series, as created by that brilliant scriptwriter Anthony Horowitz (Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day).",5,"Suspenseful, Intellectually Challenging Police Procedural",1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,3004,"['Collision', 'excellent', 'British', 'mystery/police', 'procedural', 'television', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'ITV', 'independent', 'television', 'stations', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Public', 'Broadcasting', 'Systems', 'Direct', 'recent', 'debut', 'PBS', 'stations', 'approximately', '210', 'minutes', 'bearing', 'welcome', 'subtitles', 'Friday', '5:57', 'PM', 'rush', 'hour', 'six-car', 'collision', 'Great', 'Britain', 'busy', 'A12', 'Chelmsford', 'Essex', 'vicinity', 'London', 'left', 'two', 'dead', 'scene', 'two', 'critically', 'wounded', 'further', 'deaths', 'come.And', 'quite', 'unusual', 'British', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'be', 'investigated', 'will', 'be', 'major', 'automotive', 'crash', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'John', 'Tolin', 'Douglas', 'Henshall', 'Twice', 'Yesterday', 'will', 'be', 'assigned', 'lengthy', 'leave', 'absence', 'work', 'former', 'lover', 'Senior', 'Investigating', 'Officer', 'Ann', 'Stallwood', 'Kate', 'Ashfield', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'large', 'cast', 'complex', 'suspenseful', 'furthermore', 'consistently', 'intellectually', 'challenging', 'relying', 'none', 'lazy', 'plotting', 'might', 'see', 'similarly-themed', 'American', 'TV', 'production', 'also', 'been', 'well', 'filmed', 'location', 'typical', 'first-class', 'British', 'production', 'values', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'stinting', 'cast', 'supporting', 'characters', 'extras', 'cars', 'interiors.It', 'quiet', 'little-known', 'piano', 'teacher', 'Sidney', 'Norris', 'David', 'Bamber', 'initially', 'control', 'car', 'Thereafter', 'personal', 'assistant', 'P.A.', 'Karen', 'Donnelly', 'Claire', 'Rushbrook', 'secretive', 'errand', 'smashes', 'Next', 'up', 'Daniel', 'Rampton', 'Dean', 'Lennox', 'Kelly', 'van', 'bringing', 'furniture', 'Netherlands', 'jumps', 'median', 'Whereupon', 'Rampton', 'hit', 'handsome', 'young', 'black', 'couple', 'silver', 'BMW', 'speeding', 'route', 'woman', '23rd', 'birthday', 'party', 'police', 'car', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'Then', 'Brian', 'Edwards', 'Phil', 'Davis', 'who', 'driving', 'difficult', 'mother-in-law', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'Born', 'Win', 'SUV', 'somewhat', 'shadowy', 'errand', 'wealthy', 'executive', 'Richard', 'Reeves', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'chauffeur-driven', 'limousine', 'Finally', 'police', 'arrive', 'scene', 'Rampton', 'it.You', 'would', 'think', 'production', 'must', 'bear', 'relation', '2007', 'American', 'Oscar', 'WinnerCrash', 'aside', 'fact', 'center', 'fatal', 'multi-car', 'crashes', 'major', 'cities', 'Crash', 'set', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'resemblance', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'obviously', 'many', 'large', 'British', 'cast', 'come', 'bearing', 'familiar', 'British', 'TV', 'production', 'real', 'stars', 'large', 'cast', 'American', 'theatrical', 'movie', 'Crash', 'star-laden', 'largest', 'difference', 'however', 'must', 'be', 'reputed', 'preachy', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'nature', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'American', 'film', 'have', 'avoided', 'seeing', 'many-layered', 'cool', 'intellectual', 'risk-taking', 'British', 'series', 'created', 'brilliant', 'scriptwriter', 'Anthony', 'Horowitz', 'Foyle', 'War', 'Series', '1-5', 'Dunkirk', 'VE-Day']",Collision
