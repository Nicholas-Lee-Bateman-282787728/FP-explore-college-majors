The movie is quick and has few known cast memebers, however the plot is cool and the message is good, the acting well, this was initially a HBO special in the late 80's so it is fair,  I would definitley recommend this movie if you like guns, bullets and a short but to the point plot about veterans, don't expect Oscar acting, but it is enjoyable never the less.",5,The Park Is Mine,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,622,"['absolutley', 'love', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'less', 'then', '15', 'years', 'movie', 'come', 'moritorium', 'finally', 'did', 'least', 'download', 'rental', 'fact', 'available', 'plus', 'dvd', 'disc', 'just', 'corner', 'next', 'movie', 'quick', 'few', 'known', 'cast', 'memebers', 'however', 'plot', 'cool', 'message', 'good', 'acting', 'well', 'was', 'initially', 'HBO', 'special', 'late', '80', 'fair', 'would', 'definitley', 'recommend', 'movie', 'like', 'guns', 'bullets', 'short', 'point', 'plot', 'veterans', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Oscar', 'acting', 'enjoyable', 'never', 'less']",The Park Is Mine VHS

I thought the movie was unbelievable for one thing. I thought the acting was poor, seemed like the actors were having a hard time believing people would buy the plot. The movie seemed to lack substance meaning the characters were shallow and the plot too simple and lacking diversity. I was very disappointed and this reinforces the fact that even with a lot of great reviews a movie can still be terrible. This makes me wonder, who wrote all these five star reviews?",1,Too shallow,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,582,"['watched', 'movie', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'hoping', 'good', 'movie', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'one', 'thing', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'poor', 'seemed', 'actors', 'were', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'people', 'would', 'buy', 'plot', 'movie', 'seemed', 'lack', 'substance', 'meaning', 'characters', 'were', 'shallow', 'plot', 'too', 'simple', 'lacking', 'diversity', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'even', 'lot', 'great', 'reviews', 'movie', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'terrible', 'wonder', 'who', 'wrote', 'five', 'star', 'reviews']",The Park Is Mine VHS

Still plays the veteran gets weird after the Vietnam War, but it does tell his side of the story some. Does not paint the picture that it was all the wars fault or the Vet's fault, but that Government will overstep its bounds sometimes, and also that when a man/s family abandons him, then things happen.

Especially people in government who have no clue about the people they represent, they didn't care back than and the don't care now. Its the way government evades everything thats important to the people and have their own agenda's, so in the movie he holds the city hostage makes people think and thats a start unfortunately he had to do it at gun point.
