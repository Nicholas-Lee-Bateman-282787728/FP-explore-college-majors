The hit songs are all here, the voices are superb, and comments throughout the one hour program about each individual are provided between songs.  Although I remember when these songs first became popular I realize there are other reviewers who may be more knowledgable about The Mamas & The Papas in analyzing this program than I am.  However, at least for me, the songs that we all remember and enjoy are here with comments regarding the songs and each of the singers.

As a documentary, though, it is disappointing. It tells the group's story rather superficially and looks more like a tribute to Mama Cass. It is only one hour long and ends after Cass's death. The previously released ""Straight Shooter"" faced some criticism for including too much interview footage and not enough music, but at least it was thorough, in-depth look at the roller coaster ride that was John Phillips' life and career. This new documentary focuses on the music, but still features voiceovers and edited clips, so why didn't they release a collection of videos, instead? ""Straight Shooter"" seems to be out of print, so maybe they should reissue the unedited version of it and update it in the extras, including a tribute to John Phillips. That would do the group's legacy justice. But don't get me wrong, this new DVD is highly enjoyable, a fitting celebration to the bright side of The Mamas and The Papas and a touching homage to Cass Elliot. And it does feature some footage that is not on ""Straight Shooter"", including some comments by Cass's daughter Owen.",4,"Enjoyable, but far from perfect",1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,1204,"['First', 'let', 'make', 'clear', 'DVD', 'mandatory', 'fan', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'musical', 'footage', 'documentary', 'though', 'disappointing', 'group', 'story', 'rather', 'superficially', 'more', 'tribute', 'Mama', 'Cass', 'only', 'one', 'hour', 'long', 'Cass', 'death', 'previously', 'released', 'Straight', 'Shooter', 'faced', 'criticism', 'including', 'too', 'much', 'interview', 'footage', 'not', 'enough', 'music', 'least', 'was', 'thorough', 'in-depth', 'look', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'was', 'John', 'Phillips', 'life', 'career', 'new', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'music', 'still', 'voiceovers', 'edited', 'clips', 'so', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'release', 'collection', 'videos', 'instead', 'Straight', 'Shooter', 'be', 'print', 'so', 'maybe', 'should', 'reissue', 'unedited', 'version', 'update', 'extras', 'including', 'tribute', 'John', 'Phillips', 'would', 'do', 'group', 'legacy', 'justice', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'new', 'DVD', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'fitting', 'celebration', 'bright', 'side', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'touching', 'homage', 'Cass', 'Elliot', 'feature', 'footage', 'not', 'Straight', 'Shooter', 'including', 'comments', 'Cass', 'daughter', 'Owen']",N/A

Even the people in the group were together because those were the voices he wanted, and  it all worked beautifully.And not just on one or two songs, but a whole litany of tunes, every one of which was a runaway winner.  They all just sound so exuberant and enthusiastic and happy.This DVD is an absolute gem.It's too bad that we all have to get old and die.  To see and hear some of our musical heroes when they are old and hardly look anything at all like they did in their heyday is sort of a shock.Anyway, with this DVD we see four singers who were truly monumental in their time.  It's great to actually be able to own something like this, and to be able to watch it whenever the mood strikes, and remember how great it all was.With this DVD, the Mamas and Papas will live forever, and will always be just as amazing as they once were - once upon a time.",5,They Were Simply Great,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1449,"['word', 'genius', 'bandied', 'lot', 'reference', 'musicians', 'case', 'John', 'Phillips', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'think', 'appropriate.They', 'were', 'absolutely', 'top', 'game', ""'60s"", 'nobody', 'could', 'touch', 'music', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'so', 'listenable', 'enjoyable.Their', 'voices', 'jelled', 'perfectly', 'together', 'arrangements', 'were', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'sort', 'modernized', 'contemporary', 'barbershop', 'harmony', 'using', 'jazz-type', 'chording.In', 'retrospect', 'simple', 'was', 'genius', 'it.And', 'was', 'due', 'John', 'Phillips', 'Even', 'people', 'group', 'were', 'together', 'were', 'voices', 'wanted', 'worked', 'beautifully.And', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'songs', 'whole', 'litany', 'tunes', 'one', 'was', 'runaway', 'winner', 'just', 'sound', 'so', 'exuberant', 'enthusiastic', 'happy.This', 'DVD', 'absolute', 'gem.It', 'too', 'bad', 'have', 'get', 'old', 'die', 'see', 'hear', 'musical', 'heroes', 'when', 'are', 'old', 'hardly', 'look', 'anything', 'did', 'heyday', 'sort', 'shock.Anyway', 'DVD', 'see', 'four', 'singers', 'who', 'were', 'truly', 'monumental', 'time', 'great', 'actually', 'be', 'able', 'own', 'something', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'whenever', 'mood', 'strikes', 'remember', 'how', 'great', 'was.With', 'DVD', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'will', 'live', 'forever', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'amazing', 'once', 'were', 'once', 'time']",N/A

887310,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0007QCGX6,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[9, 9]","The Mamas & The Papas - California Dreamin' is a very good retrospective of the life and times of one of the most successful groups in all history. The Mamas & The Papas evolved slowly over time, with Cass Elliott being last to join the group; and once they started performing and recording the sky was already too low for their limit.The documentary shows us the group recording in the studio, playing on the beach in the Caribbean, performing live on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Hollywood Palace, The Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and more. The archival footage is not bad at all; you'll enjoy it. It's especially wonderful to see The Mamas & The Papas performing ""Straight Shooter"" at The Monterey Pop Festival during the summer of 1967.Of course, we also see a more personal side to the group. We find out how Cass had to control herself from belting out because Michelle's voice was, by her own admission, a bit ""thin."" John Phillips wrote an awful lot for the group and his interview from 1986 is very revealing. The history behind ""Creeque Alley"" fascinated me as well; I knew it was about the band but I didn't have a complete understanding of the lyrics until I watched this program.Some say the retrospective shouldn't end with Cass Elliott dying; but actually the group did break up a few years before she died in 1974; therefore I don't understand this complaint. The group wanted to go out on top; and they cleverly chose to do just that. The Mamas & The Papas remain a fixture in American musical history.Finally, the retrospective has a lot of their songs as background music in addition to the clips and archival footage. I found that to be very useful and entertaining both at once. This film was very thoughtfully produced.In short, fans of The Mamas & The Papas should consider this a must-have for their collections. This retrospective may also appeal to people who liked their kind of rock and roll. This is an excellent retrospective of this awesome group; and I recommend it highly.

887315,A2H6HSTMNWG9RR,B0007QCGX6,Robert L. Frazier,"[7, 7]","The Mamas and the Papas were one of the greatest pop groups of the 1960's and this collection does justice to them.  What a lot of people don't realize is that they were together for less than three years and yet they achieved more in that small time frame than groups that were around for a lot longer.  They had at least a dozen hit singles, 4 gold albums, won a Grammy award, appeared on almost every television variety show of the day and toured the country in memorable appearances from the Hollywood Bowl to Carnegie Hall.  Most importantly they earned their well-deserved place for posterity in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.With the recent passing of singer Denny Doherty this collection becomes even more poignant.  He was one of the greatest and yet most under-rated singers of all time.  His smooth tenor is what carries their greatest hits like ""California Dreamin"" and their number 1 hit ""Monday, Monday"".  The late Mama Cass Elliot, the vocal powerhouse of the group provides amazing lead vocals on songs like ""Words of Love"", ""Dancing in the Streets"" and the campy ""Sing For Your Supper"".  The late John Phillips who was the leader and wrote many of the groups hits along with his beautiful then wife Michelle Phillips round out this award-winning quartet.I think the best part of this documentary is the fun and sheer joy these four people display when they are onstage singing their hearts out.  No other pop group has ever captured the amazing harmony that the Mamas and Papas had during their brief reign.
