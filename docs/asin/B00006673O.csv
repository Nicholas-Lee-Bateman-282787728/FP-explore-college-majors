About five years ago, I saw it in a smaller theater and it holds up wonderfully.This is one of the most majestic films I've ever seen, but it is also dramatically compelling with sequences that will always be memorable. Perhaps most memorable is the real sense of caring and comradre among ALL the athletes AND spectators. Since these Olympics, the games have degenerated into political doo-dah of the worst sort. These games and this film have a dignity, humaneness and spirit that has all but been lost.This is worth owning just for the Ethiopian's winning of his second Olympic marathon in a row. I seldom care about sporting contests, but the marathon literally had me grasping the theatre seat and verbally pulling for this incredible man--who along with Ali--is the greatest athlete I've ever witnessed.The American version praised by another reviewer here, was IMO one of the worst desecrations of a masterpiece I can imagine. It was cut from the almost three-hour original version to about 90-minutes and accompanied by the most inane sports announcing ever. If you saw this atrocity, you haven't seen ""Tokyo Olympiad.""If you are an Olympic fan or love breathtaking, intelligent and humane filmmaking, Ichikawa gives you the royal treatment in this film.Thank you, Criterion, for re-issuing this. My only regret is that it isn't being re-released in big-screen theatres, where it can be properly appreciated.See this. I think most of you will be cheering this monumental achievement.",5,Greatest of All Olympic Films,1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,1675,"['am', 'ordering', 'post-haste.I', 'had', 'extreme', 'thrill', 'seeing', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'huge', 'movie', 'screen', 'theatre', 'Toho', 'operated', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'saw', 'smaller', 'theater', 'wonderfully.This', 'one', 'most', 'majestic', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'also', 'dramatically', 'compelling', 'sequences', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'memorable', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'real', 'sense', 'caring', 'comradre', 'athletes', 'spectators', 'Olympics', 'games', 'have', 'degenerated', 'political', 'doo-dah', 'worst', 'sort', 'games', 'film', 'have', 'dignity', 'humaneness', 'spirit', 'been', 'lost.This', 'worth', 'owning', 'just', 'Ethiopian', 'winning', 'second', 'Olympic', 'marathon', 'row', 'seldom', 'care', 'sporting', 'contests', 'marathon', 'literally', 'had', 'grasping', 'theatre', 'seat', 'verbally', 'pulling', 'incredible', 'man', 'who', 'Ali', 'greatest', 'athlete', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed.The', 'American', 'version', 'praised', 'reviewer', 'here', 'was', 'IMO', 'one', 'worst', 'desecrations', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'imagine', 'was', 'cut', 'almost', 'three-hour', 'original', 'version', '90-minutes', 'accompanied', 'most', 'inane', 'sports', 'announcing', 'ever', 'saw', 'atrocity', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Tokyo', 'Olympiad', 'are', 'Olympic', 'fan', 'love', 'breathtaking', 'intelligent', 'humane', 'filmmaking', 'Ichikawa', 'royal', 'treatment', 'film.Thank', 'Criterion', 're-issuing', 'only', 'regret', ""n't"", 'being', 're-released', 'big-screen', 'theatres', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'properly', 'appreciated.See', 'think', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'cheering', 'monumental', 'achievement']",N/A

The artful approach to recording the events of the 1964 Toyko Olympics is masterful.My own favorite moment:  the slow-mo 800 meter women's.  Ichikawa had two cameras on the scene, and it is the mesmerizing second view of the legs of the runners that gripped me.  The fluidity of motion, the definition of their muscles, clearly evident.  The front-runner, legs pistoning in a seemingly perfect rythym, seems in control.  And then, from the left side of the screen, (keep in mind, in this shot we're seeing mostly just waist down shots of the legs of the runners) Ann Packer's legs come into the shot, moving faster than all the others on the screen.  She blows by them all, to win the race.  It's a masterful moment for Packer, and a gorgeous scene in the movie.Second best:  Ichikawa takes full advantage of the 2.35:1 widescreen format and there is a huge pull-back showing the entirety of Mt. Fuji.  One of the torch runners passes in the foreground.  As Crowie mentions in the commentary the runner is reduced to bug-size by this.  It is a breath-takingly beautiful sight.",5,Amazing film,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,1262,"['was', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'have', 'say', 'now', 'having', 'watched', 'DVD', 'think', 'Tokyo', 'Olympiad', 'muscled', 'way', 'list', 'time', 'favorite', 'documentaries', 'artful', 'approach', 'recording', 'events', '1964', 'Toyko', 'Olympics', 'masterful.My', 'own', 'favorite', 'moment', 'slow-mo', '800', 'meter', 'women', 'Ichikawa', 'had', 'two', 'cameras', 'scene', 'mesmerizing', 'second', 'view', 'legs', 'runners', 'gripped', 'fluidity', 'motion', 'definition', 'muscles', 'clearly', 'evident', 'front-runner', 'legs', 'pistoning', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'rythym', 'control', 'then', 'left', 'side', 'screen', 'keep', 'mind', 'shot', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'mostly', 'just', 'waist', 'down', 'shots', 'legs', 'runners', 'Ann', 'Packer', 'legs', 'come', 'shot', 'moving', 'faster', 'others', 'screen', 'win', 'race', 'masterful', 'moment', 'Packer', 'gorgeous', 'scene', 'movie.Second', 'best', 'Ichikawa', 'full', 'advantage', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'format', 'huge', 'pull-back', 'showing', 'entirety', 'Mt', 'Fuji', 'One', 'torch', 'runners', 'passes', 'foreground', 'Crowie', 'mentions', 'commentary', 'runner', 'reduced', 'bug-size', 'breath-takingly', 'beautiful', 'sight']",N/A

While it was impressive in many respects, I just didn't get the 5 star vibe.With the advent of HD and all the other technical improvements developed since this film was made, we are accustomed to intimacy and detail not available toearlier film directors. I am thinking of the aerial coverage as well as the tracking cameras now used in the hurdles and other events. Another thing I noticed was the lack of atadium lighting. Track events in late afternoon were very dark and difficult to appreciate.What I did like was yhe attention to competitors beyond the top finishers.

I watched it 3 times the first week I had it, including the audio commentary.It is NOT a simple documentary.

This film has gotten me interested in olympics and will pay more attention to it in the future.The film covers some of the highlights of the 1964 summer olympic games in Tokyo Japan. It covers the construction of the stadium, opening and closing ceremonies, a scene of the cafeteria as well as the following sports. Men's 100 meter, men's high jump, men's and women's shot put, pole vaulting, hammer throw, men's 10,000 meter, women's 800 meter, men's 100 meter relay, men's long jump, women's 80 meter with hurdles, gymnastics, men's 100 meter freestyle swimming, women's 100 meter backstroke, men's freestyle relay. women's 100 meter freestyle, weightlifting,. wrestling, boxing, fencing, judo, shooting, cycling race, women's volleyball, boading, men's 50 kilometer walk, pentathalon and the marathon.Several other sports were played, but not included in the film for the sake of brevity. Still the film runs at 2 hours and 50 minutes which was cut down from 70 hours of material.This DVD release is one of the best released by the Criterion Collection which I have seen. This certainly is Kon Ichikawa's crowning achievement.Right from the lighting of the cauldron by a man born in Hiroshima the exact day of the infamous bombing to the closing ceremonies opening the way for the games in Mexico City four years later.The DVD has some fine special features also. There is a 1992 interview with director Kon Ichikawa and commentary by film scholar and olympic fan Peter Cowie.In addition there's dozens of pages of supplement material in the liner notes including a list of all the medalists in each event, and many other things.This is a definite must buy for olympic fans, sports fans, documentary fans and just about anyone!",5,"An excellent film, nothing short of astounding!",1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,1935,"['review', 'Criterion', 'Colleciton', 'DVD', 'edition', 'film.Tokyo', 'Olympiad', 'known', 'Tokyo', 'Orimpikku', 'Japanese', 'language', 'first', 'Sports', 'documentary', 'released', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'film', 'gotten', 'interested', 'olympics', 'will', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'future.The', 'film', 'highlights', '1964', 'summer', 'olympic', 'games', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'construction', 'stadium', 'opening', 'closing', 'ceremonies', 'scene', 'cafeteria', 'as', 'well', 'following', 'sports', 'Men', '100', 'meter', 'men', 'high', 'jump', 'men', 'women', 'shot', 'put', 'pole', 'vaulting', 'hammer', 'throw', 'men', '10,000', 'meter', 'women', '800', 'meter', 'men', '100', 'meter', 'relay', 'men', 'long', 'jump', 'women', '80', 'meter', 'hurdles', 'gymnastics', 'men', '100', 'meter', 'freestyle', 'swimming', 'women', '100', 'meter', 'backstroke', 'men', 'freestyle', 'relay', 'women', '100', 'meter', 'freestyle', 'weightlifting', 'wrestling', 'boxing', 'fencing', 'judo', 'shooting', 'cycling', 'race', 'women', 'volleyball', 'boading', 'men', '50', 'kilometer', 'walk', 'pentathalon', 'marathon.Several', 'other', 'sports', 'were', 'played', 'not', 'included', 'film', 'sake', 'brevity', 'Still', 'film', '2', 'hours', '50', 'minutes', 'was', 'cut', 'down', '70', 'hours', 'material.This', 'DVD', 'release', 'one', 'best', 'released', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'have', 'seen', 'certainly', 'Kon', 'Ichikawa', 'crowning', 'achievement.Right', 'lighting', 'cauldron', 'man', 'born', 'Hiroshima', 'exact', 'day', 'infamous', 'bombing', 'closing', 'ceremonies', 'opening', 'way', 'games', 'Mexico', 'City', 'four', 'years', 'later.The', 'DVD', 'fine', 'special', 'features', 'also', '1992', 'interview', 'director', 'Kon', 'Ichikawa', 'commentary', 'film', 'scholar', 'olympic', 'fan', 'Peter', 'Cowie.In', 'addition', 'dozens', 'pages', 'supplement', 'material', 'liner', 'including', 'list', 'medalists', 'event', 'many', 'other', 'things.This', 'definite', 'must', 'buy', 'olympic', 'fans', 'sports', 'fans', 'documentary', 'fans', 'just', 'anyone']",N/A
