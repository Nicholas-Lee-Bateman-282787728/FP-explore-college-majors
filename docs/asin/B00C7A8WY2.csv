The story doesn't rely on action as much as most motion comics so you focus more on the story, and it's a damn good one.  The voice acting helps quite a bit and they have a good cast on this.  The story retains it's mystery and has all the misdirection of the comic.  Clever story, well acted, and cheap!  What a great combo.If you like motion comics already this one is a must have.

Before Professor Xavier, before Alpha Flight, before the X-Men, the battles with his nemesis Sabretooth(although he is definitely foreshadowed), James Howlett's early beginnings bear no resemblance to what his life would later become. The ferocity and strength he would later develop would not allow one to guess that as a young boy he was very sheltered, very weak and came from wealth. This is a history that I had never considered but Marvel has done well with choosing this for a motion comic. As the first review mentions, the voice acting is superb, and while I have to concur with the thought that Spider~Woman, Agent of S.W.O.R.D. is done better, this is not by any means not worth the purchase. I do not say this to merely suggest I am comparing one motion comic to another, but once you are smitten with one, your expectations start to rise even if you are not necessarily aware of it. Listening to the creators and understanding the process to produce the original artwork is a treat within itself, and for myself, I think Marvel would do well to re-release the original comics in their pencil form by Andy Kubert: it looks that good. Even the colorist Richard Isanove's approach to complimenting Kubert's works are fascinating, as well, so indeed, this gets a hard earned 4 stars.",4,"Terrific Origin story of James Howlett, a.k.a.
