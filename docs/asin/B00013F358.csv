What a delight to be able to sit down and watch a movie with my grandchildren and see them enjoy it as much as I did.  Robert Logan as Zachariah Coop was great. Heather (Holly) and Mark (Jason) I thought did a great job of acting.  Coop saving Jason from the river and at the Indian camp were some heartwarming scenes.  The scenery was beautiful and the music was outstanding.  Would like to have seen them make a soundtract.  I have watched this many times by my self and with family.
