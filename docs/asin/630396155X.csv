392170,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630396155X,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","The opening scenes show the destroyed remains of a German city in 1948. The Judges arrive for the trial. One question is: does a loyalty oath take precedence over moral law? Does a higher law (like the Ten Commandments) supercede political law? The question about life under Hitler shows people afraid to be seen as ""political"". [Is this a reference to America in the 1950s?] Slowly the film brings out the deeds of the Nazi regime. They sterilized the defectives using the ""laws of eugenics"", a practice pioneered in the United States. Yet it was known then that a poor diet caused mental retardation and other diseases (pellagra). The attitude of Judge Ives shows the ideas of fascism wasn't just in Germany. The film gives no explanation of the differences between our Common Law and the Civil Law used in Europe.There is one scene where the prisoners discuss the film of the extermination camps. ""Was it possible"" one asks? A prisoner who was there says it was very possible. The problem was not the killing, but the disposing of the bodies! The defense lawyer claimed only a few criminals were responsible, most people didn't know. Was it possible? We all know that gossip and rumors exist outside of the controlled media in every society. The Berlin Blockade starts, and provides a side event where people comment on these happenings. Will this require a change in policy? Will the politicians override the application of the law? Should those who merely followed orders be absolved from whatever they did? It is a well-known fact that all those who take part in a crime are guilty. All the defendants (judges who applied the law) are found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The defense lawyer says they are likely to be freed in five year. [Aren't prison terms in Europe much shorter than in America?] Is the emotionalism of the defense lawyer supposed to signify something?The film claims that German judges were ""independent"", but as far as I know that is not true in the Civil Law system in Europe. Judges there are state civil servants of the national government, and have more power than judges in America, who are bound by precedent. After forty years this film seems very idealistic rather than based on actual events. In 1999 Telford Taylor died, and the announcement in the newspaper gave his account of the Nuremberg Trials. He said the British wanted to simply shoot the Nazi leaders out of hand. Stalin objected, he wanted trials to show the guilt of the Nazis. The Americans agreed on the need for trials. Stalin knew that whoever controlled the judges and the trial controlled the outcome. If all the Germans loved the Nazis there would have been no need for the Gestapo or ""concentration camps"".This story was written by Abby Mann, who was at his peak in the 1960s. Director Stanley Kramer was famous for his dramatic films. This is a good film but drags in places. Richard Widmark stands out in this film. The film does not identify the actors with the role they play. It does not explain what law was used as the basis for this trial. America pioneered in the ""law of eugenics"" as punishment for prisoners. Will we ever have any ""Nuremberg Trials""? Oliver Wendell Holmes also decided to exempt the Baseball Cartel from the Anti-Trust Laws. (I wonder what payoff the Supreme Court received?) After his death Holmes gave money from his estate to the Federal government, the only time this had ever happened.",4,Using the Law to Commit Crimes,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,3438,"['opening', 'scenes', 'show', 'destroyed', 'German', 'city', '1948', 'Judges', 'arrive', 'trial', 'One', 'question', 'loyalty', 'oath', 'take', 'precedence', 'moral', 'law', 'higher', 'law', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'supercede', 'political', 'law', 'question', 'life', 'Hitler', 'people', 'afraid', 'be', 'seen', 'political', '[', 'reference', 'America', '1950s', ']', 'Slowly', 'film', 'out', 'deeds', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'sterilized', 'defectives', 'using', 'laws', 'eugenics', 'practice', 'pioneered', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'known', 'then', 'poor', 'diet', 'caused', 'mental', 'retardation', 'other', 'diseases', 'pellagra', 'attitude', 'Judge', 'Ives', 'ideas', 'fascism', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'Germany', 'film', 'explanation', 'differences', 'Common', 'Law', 'Civil', 'Law', 'used', 'Europe.There', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'prisoners', 'discuss', 'film', 'extermination', 'camps', 'Was', 'possible', 'one', 'prisoner', 'who', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'possible', 'problem', 'was', 'not', 'killing', 'disposing', 'bodies', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'claimed', 'only', 'few', 'criminals', 'were', 'responsible', 'most', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Was', 'possible', 'know', 'gossip', 'rumors', 'exist', 'controlled', 'media', 'society', 'Berlin', 'Blockade', 'side', 'event', 'where', 'people', 'comment', 'happenings', 'Will', 'require', 'change', 'policy', 'Will', 'politicians', 'override', 'application', 'law', 'Should', 'who', 'merely', 'followed', 'orders', 'be', 'absolved', 'did', 'well-known', 'fact', 'who', 'take', 'part', 'crime', 'are', 'guilty', 'defendants', 'judges', 'who', 'applied', 'law', 'are', 'found', 'guilty', 'sentenced', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'freed', 'five', 'year', '[', 'Are', ""n't"", 'prison', 'terms', 'Europe', 'much', 'shorter', 'America', ']', 'emotionalism', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'supposed', 'signify', 'something', 'film', 'German', 'judges', 'were', 'independent', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'not', 'true', 'Civil', 'Law', 'system', 'Europe', 'Judges', 'are', 'state', 'civil', 'servants', 'national', 'government', 'have', 'more', 'power', 'judges', 'America', 'who', 'are', 'bound', 'precedent', 'forty', 'years', 'film', 'very', 'idealistic', 'rather', 'based', 'actual', 'events', '1999', 'Telford', 'Taylor', 'died', 'announcement', 'newspaper', 'gave', 'account', 'Nuremberg', 'Trials', 'said', 'British', 'wanted', 'simply', 'shoot', 'Nazi', 'leaders', 'hand', 'Stalin', 'objected', 'wanted', 'trials', 'show', 'guilt', 'Nazis', 'Americans', 'agreed', 'need', 'trials', 'Stalin', 'knew', 'controlled', 'judges', 'trial', 'controlled', 'outcome', 'Germans', 'loved', 'Nazis', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'need', 'Gestapo', 'concentration', 'camps', '.This', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'Abby', 'Mann', 'who', 'was', 'peak', '1960s', 'Director', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'was', 'famous', 'dramatic', 'films', 'good', 'film', 'drags', 'places', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'out', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'identify', 'actors', 'role', 'play', 'not', 'explain', 'what', 'law', 'was', 'used', 'basis', 'trial', 'America', 'pioneered', 'law', 'eugenics', 'punishment', 'prisoners', 'Will', 'ever', 'have', 'Nuremberg', 'Trials', 'Oliver', 'Wendell', 'Holmes', 'also', 'decided', 'exempt', 'Baseball', 'Cartel', 'Anti-Trust', 'Laws', 'wonder', 'what', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'received', 'death', 'Holmes', 'gave', 'money', 'estate', 'Federal', 'government', 'only', 'time', 'had', 'ever', 'happened']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS
392171,A2MO0NUJ76FPG0,630396155X,"A. H. Lynde ""ahlynde""","[11, 30]","It appears there is an almost universal five-star rating for this film among Amazon reviewers. It is of course an important film. But it is also a self-important film. Its interminable running time of 186 minutes can be excruciating. Its release in 1961 came a year before Nazi henchman Adolf Eichmann was executed and the year after Preminger's ""Exodus"", so the film perhaps provided essential insight into wartime criminal responsibility, an issue obviously still with us. But to say that it today delivers its intended wallop is just not so -- it is too flawed artistically. First, Kramer's direction is obvious and plodding. The cinematography & editing provide long pans and zooms in courtrooms, long looks of knowing reactions, long silences, good Germans singing long lieder (""Germans love to sing"" says Dietrich) and long-winded observations by folks about everything from autobahns to death camps. In short, everything's too long!  Second, the writing makes you squirm -- I challenge anyone to name a major feature with as many repeated lines. Writer Mann apparently imagined that for this film repititions of superficial thoughts added up to deep ones.Third, the acting is surprisingly wooden, given the talent. Lancaster as a Nazi Justice Minister alternately blusters and conducts soul searches; Garland as a 'collateral damage' racial victim gives an unusually unconvincing performance, for her; Dietrich's appearance as a Nazi widow is stiff and also odd, given her real-life staunch opposition to Nazism; Widmark as the prosecutor is just tiresome. Oscar-winner Schell as the defense attorney, allowed by Kramer to continuously yell in the court scenes, is full of sound and fury signifying practically nothing.  Tracey as the head judge is a brighter light, but still mostly sleep-walks except for two sterling scenes --first, as he announces the court's decision eloquently from the bench and second at the end of the film (which I won't give away for anyone who hasn't seen it).The first major saving grace is the deeply moving performance of Montgomery Clift on the stand - the best piece in the entire 3 hours.  His singular portrayal speaks more of horror and responsibility than everything else in the entire movie. The other saving grace is the historical events it, unfortunately, rather ineptly presents.

392173,A2GOTTK868X1CR,630396155X,Albert Lee,"[23, 152]","Stanley Kramer was an Anti-American liberal member of thehollywood elite.  In this film he uses America's victoryover the Nazi menace and its liberation of Europe as anexcuse to bash America more than the Nazis.He salts the film with Anti-America references and reverseshistory at the end of the film to make it look like Americafreed all the nazis from prison.  And guess what?  Kramer tellsus through his propoganda that it was our life-struggle forFreedom against the soviet union that made us into criminals.Its a wonder the man didn't move to the soviet union he lovedit so much.  Its a well made film and some of the actors givebetter performances than the film deserves, but its Anti-Americanscript and direction work against those great performances.There is also a clear plea made in the film for Warren-Courtstyle judicial activism on the part of judges.  Kramer ismaking a liberal argument in favor of Judges legislating fromthe courtroom.  But that wasn't the problem in Nazi Germany.The problem in Nazi Germany was that these judges were evilmen working for a fear government.  Their holding office inthe Nazi government should have been sufficient grounds forprison terms.  The trial for these judges should have lastedabout five minutes.  Did you hold office in the nazi government?Yes - automatic seven years.  Did you convict anyone under thefollowing laws - If yes, one more year for each person heconvicted.  Were you a party member?  If yes, five more years.The trials for these men should have been about ten easyquestions.  Going into why they made decisions under a particularlaw is irrelivant to the crimes that they are guilty of.  Ifthey held office, if they applied criminal laws, if they wereparty members, then they are guilty.And the nazi lawyer should have been thrown out of court foracting like that.

392175,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630396155X,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","Considered staple cinematic viewing by many, `Judgment at Nuremberg' truly lives up to a lot of the hype.  With one of the best ensembles ever brought together on the big screen, this film is one of the better courtroom dramas I've ever seen (and I'm not the biggest fan of the genre to be honest).I'll start by getting a few of the drawbacks (in my opinion) out of the way.  For me (and I have this issue with the genre as a whole) the film seems to drag a bit in areas.  The film is three hours in length, and at times that is a blessing, but I definitely see where some editing could have been used.  I also have a tad of an issue with Maximilian Schell's performance.  I know that he won the Oscar and he's been lauded, but he was (again, in my opinion) the ensemble's weakest link.  His courtroom antics had a ring of falsehood to them.  When comparing the authority that both he and Burt Lancaster use in some of their scenes, there is a major difference.  When Lancaster raises his voice, it means something.Schell lacks that for me.I found that the ending was a tad overwrote.  The monologue after monologue just seemed to express what we already knew over and over and kind of killed the poignancy of the films climax.  You ever hear that term `beating a dead horse'?  That's kind of what the ending felt like for me.  That said; those individual monologues on their own were kind of stellar.Taking place in 1948, the film tells of the German war crime trials held after World War II.  Taking a few liberties with some facts, the film focuses on four judges being tried for war crimes (or their condolence of those war crimes).  An American judge named Dan Haywood is asked to come to Germany and head the tribunal.  The film covers the court proceedings in detail as they span a few months in time.  Contrasting the courtroom antics with Haywood's own moral dilemmas, `Judgment at Nuremberg' works hard to create something very human and relatable.  I will give it that as a huge bonus.  You really begin to `feel' everything Haywood feels.Holocaust films can be hard to judge because of the emotional weight they carry.  It's hard not to see footage or hear tragic stories and not feel swelled with rage for the culprits and sympathy for the victims.  I thought that it was a nice statement made by Hans Rolfe (Schell), when he spoke out about the footage shown in the courtroom as being uncalled for.  It was an emotional plea, and it worked.  I think that is one of the main points made in this film, the fact that our judgment can become skewed by our emotions.But then again, don't our emotions help define what is morally correct?The ensemble as a whole is nearly flawless.  Like I said, Schell for me was the weak link, but even he had his moments.  Spencer Tracy was stunning (I love this guy).  He really understood the emotional dilemma facing his character, and he worked his way through the film never once wavering from that internal contradiction.  His final speech in the courtroom was expertly delivered (and written) for it never once went `too far', delving into `preachy' territory, and it very easily could have.  Lancaster is also very good here, authoritative yet he carries himself with a subtle nuance that I love.  I'm not the biggest fan of Lancaster, but when he puts his best foot forward it shows.  Richard Widmark is crushing as the Prosecutor, Colonel Tad Lawson, and Marlene Dietrich is very moving as the conflicted Mrs. Bertholt.  Even a young William Shatner delivers a top notch performance.But for me, this film boils down to two cameo performances given by Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland.  These shattered performances are so emotionally powerful it's no wonder they were nominated for Oscars despite their small screen time.  Garland especially is a powerhouse here.  Her breakdown on the stand, the sobbing and baited breaths, is one of the most emotionally crippling moments in cinematic history, and her performance is certainly one of the best Supporting performances I've ever seen.In the end I highly recommend this one.  It has a few faults (it should have been edited a tad, and Schell should have reigned it in a little better...and the headphone thing got annoying) but it has a lot of strengths and certainly deserves to be seen and admired.",4,My judgment is rendered...,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,4304,"['Considered', 'staple', 'cinematic', 'viewing', 'many', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'truly', 'up', 'lot', 'hype', 'one', 'best', 'ensembles', 'ever', 'brought', 'together', 'big', 'screen', 'film', 'one', 'better', 'courtroom', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'genre', 'be', 'honest', '.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'getting', 'few', 'drawbacks', 'opinion', 'way', 'have', 'issue', 'genre', 'whole', 'film', 'drag', 'bit', 'areas', 'film', 'three', 'hours', 'length', 'times', 'blessing', 'definitely', 'see', 'where', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'also', 'have', 'tad', 'issue', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'performance', 'know', 'won', 'Oscar', 'been', 'lauded', 'was', 'again', 'opinion', 'ensemble', 'weakest', 'link', 'courtroom', 'antics', 'had', 'ring', 'falsehood', 'When', 'comparing', 'authority', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'use', 'scenes', 'major', 'difference', 'When', 'Lancaster', 'voice', 'something.Schell', 'lacks', 'me.I', 'found', 'ending', 'was', 'tad', 'overwrote', 'monologue', 'monologue', 'just', 'seemed', 'express', 'what', 'already', 'knew', 'kind', 'killed', 'poignancy', 'films', 'climax', 'ever', 'hear', 'term', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'kind', 'what', 'ending', 'felt', 'said', 'individual', 'monologues', 'own', 'were', 'kind', 'stellar.Taking', 'place', '1948', 'film', 'tells', 'German', 'war', 'crime', 'trials', 'held', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Taking', 'few', 'liberties', 'facts', 'film', 'four', 'judges', 'being', 'tried', 'war', 'crimes', 'condolence', 'war', 'crimes', 'American', 'judge', 'named', 'Dan', 'Haywood', 'asked', 'come', 'Germany', 'head', 'tribunal', 'film', 'court', 'proceedings', 'detail', 'span', 'few', 'months', 'time', 'Contrasting', 'courtroom', 'antics', 'Haywood', 'own', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'works', 'hard', 'create', 'something', 'very', 'human', 'relatable', 'will', 'give', 'huge', 'bonus', 'really', 'begin', 'feel', 'everything', 'Haywood', 'feels.Holocaust', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'judge', 'emotional', 'weight', 'carry', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'footage', 'hear', 'tragic', 'stories', 'not', 'feel', 'swelled', 'rage', 'culprits', 'sympathy', 'victims', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'statement', 'made', 'Hans', 'Rolfe', 'Schell', 'when', 'spoke', 'out', 'footage', 'shown', 'courtroom', 'being', 'uncalled', 'was', 'emotional', 'plea', 'worked', 'think', 'one', 'main', 'points', 'made', 'film', 'fact', 'judgment', 'can', 'become', 'skewed', 'emotions.But', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'emotions', 'help', 'define', 'what', 'morally', 'correct', 'ensemble', 'whole', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'said', 'Schell', 'was', 'weak', 'link', 'even', 'had', 'moments', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'was', 'stunning', 'love', 'guy', 'really', 'understood', 'emotional', 'dilemma', 'facing', 'character', 'worked', 'way', 'film', 'never', 'once', 'wavering', 'internal', 'contradiction', 'final', 'speech', 'courtroom', 'was', 'expertly', 'delivered', 'written', 'never', 'once', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'delving', 'preachy', 'territory', 'very', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'Lancaster', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'authoritative', 'yet', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'love', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Lancaster', 'when', 'best', 'foot', 'forward', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'crushing', 'Prosecutor', 'Colonel', 'Tad', 'Lawson', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'very', 'moving', 'conflicted', 'Mrs.', 'Bertholt', 'Even', 'young', 'William', 'Shatner', 'top', 'notch', 'performance.But', 'film', 'down', 'two', 'cameo', 'performances', 'given', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'shattered', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'wonder', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'small', 'screen', 'time', 'Garland', 'especially', 'powerhouse', 'here', 'breakdown', 'stand', 'sobbing', 'baited', 'breaths', 'one', 'most', 'emotionally', 'crippling', 'moments', 'cinematic', 'history', 'performance', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'Supporting', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'few', 'faults', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'tad', 'Schell', 'should', 'have', 'reigned', 'little', 'better', 'headphone', 'thing', 'got', 'annoying', 'lot', 'strengths', 'certainly', 'be', 'seen', 'admired']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS

392177,A1PASRZ81DY9C,630396155X,Austin Somlo,"[6, 52]","Viewed: 2/11Rate: 12/11: Judgment at Nuremberg is a misleading film in so many ways. At first, before seeing it, I originally thought it was going to be a documentary based on the actual events. It turns out to be a fictionalized account of actual trial. Second, I originally thought the movie was going to be about the trial of twenty-two famous Nazi defendants including Hermann Goering. Hence, it is not that. Rather, it is about the trial of (how boring...) the Judges of Third Reich. After the film ended, I was compelled to look up the original source of the proceedings, and it was the 1,267 page Trials of War Criminals Before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals Volume III: ""The Justice Case."" I admit, the book is quite tedious to read through, but it proves one thing to me: the movie is absolutely nothing like it, not even a shred of it. Ultimately, Judgment at Nuremberg can't be rated any higher than a `1'. Sure, I'll be pointed out that it's just a movie, and it's a fiction, not meant to be taken seriously. Well...it is a propaganda film at best, an attempt to rewrite history by unqualified and uneducated persons. Thirdly, while watching it, I've never felt so insulted by the information presented, the way witnesses were treated, and the gross freedom of defendants in terms of defending themselves through speeches; it is so inaccurate, insulting, manipulative, and deceptive. Most of all, it is a pro-German film at best. The easiest reason why American viewers do not react strongly as normal to Ernst Janning and Mrs. Bertholt is because...they were played by Burt Lancaster and Marlene Dietrich! That's called manipulation of human emotions! Let's just have an analogy here...if Saddam Hussein is played by Daniel Day-Lewis in a leading performance, of course, we'll have sympathy for Saddam because it's Daniel Day-Lewis playing him after all. Suppose, if he is played by somebody else, then it's impossible to care or find empathy for him. That's exactly what happens in Judgment at Nuremberg . If you look at Emil Hahn, it's easy to hate him because of how he looks. On the other hand, if you look at Ernst Janning, you'll go, ""That's Burt...a legendary actor. What a great performance."" Obviously, he is a legendary actor, but this is just bad enough. Now, with Marlene Dietrich (an actress whom I hate), she is able to gain access to Judge Haywood due to her looks. Of course, she is resorting to commonly used tactics known to veteran police officers, detectives, and judges today. It's about making excuses and playing the innocent card when in fact is called DENIAL! Truth be told, most likely, the judges of that time wouldn't allow it to happen to themselves because for all intent and purposes, the people of Germany was responsible for the mass destruction of mankind, something the world had never before seen. The most appalling statement made by her character, which is a tactic, is that nobody in Germany knew about the atrocities that were happening. That is 100% lie. I read in trivia that Marlene, herself a German, was repulsed by the lines she had to say and had gone through ordeals, but my question is: why undergo through it if she knew it was historically false? Naturally, she gets cast into the role because she was a well-known actress of that time and would be able to get away with it. Had an actress oblivious to American audience be cast for her role, it would have failed because the American audience wouldn't buy it for the slightest second. But it's Marlene Dietrich...so, that makes a perspective easier to be permissible. And it's called MANIPULATION by the part of makers of the film. Finally, just because the performances were decent (in reality, they were too melodramatic to the point of being wholly theatrical) doesn't mean the film must be called great. Just because the film touched the topic of Holocaust doesn't mean it automatically becomes an outstanding film. Just because the film was about an important event doesn't mean it is automatically a respectable film. All in all, Judgment at Nuremberg is a work of fiction. Judgment at Nuremberg is a work of rubbish. And Judgment at Nuremberg is an attempt of history rewriting. In fact, the makers shouldn't have been allowed to make a fictionalized account of a trial that happened and just steal parts of it; if it was a trial of entirely different thing and not based on Nuremberg Trials and the makers changed the names, I would have accepted it as a serious movie.",1,"Insulting, Manipulative, and Thoroughly Historically False.",1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,4494,"['Viewed', '2/11Rate', '12/11', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'misleading', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'first', 'seeing', 'originally', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'documentary', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'out', 'be', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'actual', 'trial', 'Second', 'originally', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'trial', 'twenty-two', 'famous', 'Nazi', 'defendants', 'including', 'Hermann', 'Goering', 'Hence', 'not', 'Rather', 'trial', 'how', 'boring', 'Judges', 'Third', 'Reich', 'film', 'ended', 'was', 'compelled', 'look', 'up', 'original', 'source', 'proceedings', 'was', '1,267', 'page', 'Trials', 'War', 'Criminals', 'Nuremberg', 'Military', 'Tribunals', 'Volume', 'III', 'Justice', 'Case', 'admit', 'book', 'quite', 'tedious', 'read', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'not', 'even', 'shred', 'Ultimately', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'rated', 'higher', '1', 'Sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'just', 'movie', 'fiction', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Well', 'propaganda', 'film', 'best', 'attempt', 'rewrite', 'history', 'unqualified', 'uneducated', 'persons', 'Thirdly', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'so', 'insulted', 'information', 'presented', 'way', 'witnesses', 'were', 'treated', 'gross', 'freedom', 'defendants', 'terms', 'defending', 'speeches', 'so', 'inaccurate', 'insulting', 'manipulative', 'deceptive', 'Most', 'pro-German', 'film', 'best', 'easiest', 'reason', 'why', 'American', 'viewers', 'do', 'not', 'react', 'strongly', 'normal', 'Ernst', 'Janning', 'Mrs.', 'Bertholt', 'were', 'played', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'called', 'manipulation', 'human', 'emotions', 'Let', 'just', 'have', 'analogy', 'here', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'leading', 'performance', 'course', ""'ll"", 'have', 'sympathy', 'Saddam', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'playing', 'Suppose', 'played', 'somebody', 'else', 'then', 'impossible', 'care', 'find', 'empathy', 'exactly', 'what', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'look', 'Emil', 'Hahn', 'easy', 'hate', 'how', 'other', 'hand', 'look', 'Ernst', 'Janning', ""'ll"", 'go', 'Burt', 'legendary', 'actor', 'What', 'great', 'performance', 'Obviously', 'legendary', 'actor', 'just', 'bad', 'enough', 'Now', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'actress', 'whom', 'hate', 'able', 'gain', 'access', 'Judge', 'Haywood', 'due', 'looks', 'course', 'resorting', 'commonly', 'used', 'tactics', 'known', 'veteran', 'police', 'officers', 'detectives', 'judges', 'today', 'making', 'excuses', 'playing', 'innocent', 'card', 'when', 'fact', 'called', 'DENIAL', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'most', 'likely', 'judges', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'happen', 'intent', 'purposes', 'people', 'Germany', 'was', 'responsible', 'mass', 'destruction', 'mankind', 'something', 'world', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'most', 'appalling', 'statement', 'made', 'character', 'tactic', 'nobody', 'Germany', 'knew', 'atrocities', 'were', 'happening', '100', '%', 'lie', 'read', 'trivia', 'Marlene', 'German', 'was', 'repulsed', 'lines', 'had', 'say', 'had', 'gone', 'ordeals', 'question', 'why', 'undergo', 'knew', 'was', 'historically', 'false', 'Naturally', 'cast', 'role', 'was', 'well-known', 'actress', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'Had', 'actress', 'oblivious', 'American', 'audience', 'be', 'cast', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'failed', 'American', 'audience', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'slightest', 'second', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'so', 'perspective', 'easier', 'be', 'permissible', 'called', 'MANIPULATION', 'part', 'makers', 'film', 'Finally', 'just', 'performances', 'were', 'decent', 'reality', 'were', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'point', 'being', 'wholly', 'theatrical', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'called', 'great', 'Just', 'film', 'touched', 'topic', 'Holocaust', ""n't"", 'mean', 'automatically', 'outstanding', 'film', 'Just', 'film', 'was', 'important', 'event', ""n't"", 'mean', 'automatically', 'respectable', 'film', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'work', 'fiction', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'work', 'rubbish', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'attempt', 'history', 'rewriting', 'fact', 'makers', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'make', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'trial', 'happened', 'just', 'steal', 'parts', 'was', 'trial', 'entirely', 'different', 'thing', 'not', 'based', 'Nuremberg', 'Trials', 'makers', 'changed', 'names', 'would', 'have', 'accepted', 'serious', 'movie']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS
392178,ANGH6401L9Y0T,630396155X,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","You really must see this, both for its historical content and its entertainment value.  Surprisingly, it wasn't all that depressing.  For one thing, this was the trial of four Nazi judges.  The big guys had already been tried.  But as Judge Haywood (Spencer Tracy) pointed out, they were effectively giving the color of law to atrocities.  At the very end, one of the defendants, Ernst Yanning (Burt Lancaster) said to Haywood that he did not know it would come to that, all those millions murdered.  Judge Haywood replied, ""It came to that the first time you sentenced a man to death you knew to be innocent.""So the story is really about justice, and the cast is amazing.  Tracy and Lancaster are the start: William Shatner plays the young Army officer assigned to assist Heywood.  Marlene Dietrich plays Mrs. Bertholdt, the owner of the house that was commandeered for Haywood's residence during the trial (which lasted almost a year).  Richard Widmark is the prosecuting attorney; Maximilion Schell is the defense attorney.  Judy Garland is Irene Hoffman, a girl who was sentenced to prison for perjury because she refused to lie.The one seriously depressing part of the movie is when the prosecution plays the films made at the opening of the concentration camps.  Piles of emaciated corpses, ovens with human skeletons, artwork on pieces of parchment made from human skin.  The film started with a map of Germany and German-occupied states showing the locations of all the concentration camps: there were so many!The most dramatic moment is when Ernst Yanning, against the advice of his attorney, makes a statement about his guilt and the guilt of all those who supported the Nazis.  Only problem with his role was that when we saw him in his prison garb, I couldn't help seeing the Birdman of Alcatraz.It's an important film, very well made, and over three hours long.

392179,ALR35EFI69S5R,630396155X,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[173, 178]","This is truly an astonishing movie. After seeing it one wonders that Spencer Tracy did not win the Academy Award for his performance here. Of course, another actor in the cast, Maxmillian Schell, playing the German  defense attorney, did! In many ways the movie is the senior brother to  ""Schindler's List"", acting to probe thoughtfully through the mist of  euphemisms, excuses and exaggerations of the era. And sifting out some  remarkable, memorable, and noble notions about what human beings should be  held responsible for in terms of their social attitudes, civic behavior and  public actions.Ostensibly, the action takes place after the more  sensational trials of the Nazi hierarchy, when the public appetite for  blood, revenge, and harsh justice had been somewhat abated. Tracy plays a  relatively obscure retired rural American judge called upon to act as one  of the three presiding judges in overseeing the trials of prominent German  jurists who had co-operated, collaborated, and then presided over the  gradual civil drift from a nation whose conduct and laws were based on a  corpus of jurisprudence to one characterized by crackpot eugenic policies,  blatant racism, &amp; officially-sanctioned violence and mayhem.Burt  Lancaster plays a pre-eminent German judge, one famed for his legal  treatises and international reputation as a jurist. Through the prism of  the testimony of both the judges on trial and their cross examination by a  zealous American military prosecutor played masterfully by a young Richard  Widmark, the viewer begins to understand much more about the slippery slope  most of the jurists had unwittingly embarked upon.  Add into this equation  the introduction of a sensational set of key witnesses played by Judy  Garland and Montgomery Clift, and the full emotional impact and profound  significance of what these judges had allowed to happen truly gels.This  is an unforgettable and remarkably unique movie, truly a classic and  cautionary tale based on the historical record of what the Germans did to  each other, based on fact. And by the way, be sure to listen carefully to  the final several scenes in which Tracy takes full advantage of several  opportunities to cut through all the equivocations, half-truths, and  ""honest mistake"" nonsense, literally electrifying the screen with the power  of his monologue and his superb acting.  He was truly one of a kind, too.  Wow!

One reviewer even goes deeper into suggesting, that Stanley Kramer was an Anti-American liberal member of thehollywood elite. This reviewer also wrote ""In this film he uses America's victory over the Nazi menace and its liberation of Europe as an excuse to bash America more than the Nazis.""  My, My, My, you self-righteous sons of a gun.  I think an historical reminder is in order here. Who dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousand civilians?  Innocent people, kids, women and elderly died a horrible death inflicted by the USA!!  It really doesn't matter whether you kill 6 million or two hundred thousand, the fact remains, murder is murder!  If anyone is going to judge the Nazis, they should judge the Americans as well! Were they heros??  Well, that depends entirely on your point of view.

About five years ago I was in a Spencer Tracy mode, going out of my way to watch any film he had done, when I came across this gem of a film from 1961 called ""Judgement at Nuremberg.""  The best aspects of this film are the incredible script, a phenomenal cast, and an inspired director named Stanley Kramer.  The first time I saw this film I was in equal parts shocked and moved by all the excellent acting and enthralled with the magnificent screenplay.  I cannot emphasize enough how well written the script is.  Also, the cast is exceptional with standout performances from Spencer Tracy, Judy Garland, Maximilian Schell, and an amazing short scene from Montgomery Clift which got him an Oscar nomination for less than ten minutes screen time.  All the actors here have their moments, the only slightly overdone performance coming from Burt Lancaster who conveys the proper emotional context to the fantastic words he is given, but he simply cannot speak properly with a German accent.  Then there are a couple of moments shot on sound sateges with the actors speaking their lines in automobiles with a fake backdrop moving behind them; one of which was completely unnecessary.  These two scenes standout mostly because the rest of the film is so honest and genuine and subsequently they feel manufactured and plastic.  This film was nominated for 11 Oscars, winning 2 for Best Actor(Maximilian Schell) and Best Adapted Screenplay, respectively.  The special features on this DVD are non-essentials.  The most annoying being a conversation between Maximilian Schell and screenwriter Abby Mann where they basically praise each other for ten minutes or so for their contributions to the film.  ""No, no...your contribution was more important.""  ""No, yours was more important.""  etc.  This is a very solid film at a very good price.  Just skip the special features section beacuse there is simply nothing special about it.

Add to that the titanic issues of four former Nazi judges on trial for enforcing government laws and directives (based on the actual Nuremberg Trials), and JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG becomes one of the most riveting, compelling dramas in cinematic history.  This 1961 classic literally races by at three heart-pounding hours, and the viewer will definitely walk away thinking long and hard about the myriad of questions this film raises.  Were these jurists culpable for merely carrying out their government's laws, thereby making them responsible for the atrocities committed in the concentration camps?  Should a judge refuse to carry out a law he finds reprehensible--even if it places his own life and safety at risk?That's right.  Chew on that for awhile.JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG is further enhanced by a stellar, all-star cast, headlined by Spencer Tracy as the presiding judge of the military tribunal.  Tracy was one of the greatest actors ever, and he brings a commanding presence to this role.  Other legends include Burt Lancaster and a young Richard Widmark--but by far the best performance is turned in by Maximillian Schell as the defendants' dynamic, fiery barrister.  And Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland are unforgettable in their relatively brief roles as witnesses (and Nazi victims).  The cast keeps this gripping drama rolling towards a powerful climax, making JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG one of the very best courtroom movies ever made.--D.

Viz. the Abu Ghraib prisoner affair, questions about Guantanamo and about the Patriot Act.  In the movie we were the Good Guys.

No, it pertains to a later trial of lesser fry by American occupation authorities only. The film is not perfect.  Some overacting and heavy hamminess is at hand.  But overall, it is gripping.

392197,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,630396155X,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[3, 3]","""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" directed by Stanley Kramer from a screenplay by Abby Mann, is set in 1948, three years after the most important Nazi leaders had been tried for their crimes.  In the dock are four German judges who issued rulings in line with the Nazi policies of forced sterilizations and racial purity.  Spencer Tracy plays an American judge who heads the tribunal that will adjudicate the fate of the defendants.  Hans Rolfe, portrayed by Oscar-winner Maximilian Schell, is a fiery defense attorney who insists that his client, Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), is not only a judge but a respected intellectual and patriot who did what he thought was right.  Janning merely carried out the laws of the land; it was not his job to question or interpret these laws. Colonel Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark), is the passionate prosecuting attorney who vehemently disagrees with this argument.  Lawson maintains that judges, of all people, should have the insight to see through the rationalizations of a corrupt regime.  He contends that these men should have resigned rather than send innocent people to their deaths.Those who have not seen this 1961 movie for many years will be amazed at how well it has stood the test of time.  Mann's exceptional screenplay is as relevant today as it ever was.  He raises such controversial and important questions as: Should a country's leaders do whatever they deem necessary to insure their nation's survival?  Does political expedience take precedence over decency and justice?  Should a person who is ordered to commit immoral acts be punished for doing as he is told? Is it true that ""we have to forget [the past] if we are to go on living?""  There are no easy answers.  Many individuals will find themselves thinking about these questions and their implications long after they have viewed the film.The cast is extraordinary.  The great Spencer Tracy is thoughtful, restrained, and compassionate as Judge Dan Haywood, a man of conscience who will not be bullied.  He walks the streets of Nuremberg, chats with ordinary Germans, reads Janning's books, and immerses himself in every aspect of the trial so that he can render a fair decision.  Montgomery Clift (Rudolph Peterson), Judy Garland (Irene Hoffman), and Marlene Dietrich (Mrs. Bertholt) are all excellent in key supporting roles.  It is impossible to remain unmoved when Garland and Clift take the stand to tell their heartrending stories or when we see archival footage showing the unspeakable atrocities committed in the concentration camps.  Although Lancaster spends much of the movie sitting stone-faced in the courtroom, at one point he stands and delivers an electrifying speech that changes the course of the trial.

392198,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,630396155X,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 4]","Screenwriter Abby Mann and actor Richard Widmark died within a day of each other just this past week, which makes a revisit with this eminently powerful 1961 courtroom drama all the more appropriate. At an epic-length 186 minutes, the movie is a fictionalized account of one of the many trials held after WWII before the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal, this one the 1948 trial of four Nazi judges who used their power to enable the Third Reich to conduct experiments upon Jewish prisoners, and had accountability for murder, brutalities, torture, and other atrocities directed toward the Jews. Directed by Stanley Kramer (The Defiant Ones,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner), the king of socially conscious cinema in the late fifties and sixties, the film digs deeply into the ethics of assigning war crimes responsibility to individuals.The heavyweight cast is the primary draw here. With his quiet authority, Spencer Tracy plays Chief Judge Dan Haywood who has the unenviable task of presiding over the tribunal. For the prosecution is attorney Col. Tad Lawson, who shows actual footage from the devastating remains of the German concentration camps when they were liberated. Widmark plays Lawson with equal parts grit and petulance. Defense attorney Hans Rolfe is portrayed by a young Maximilian Schell in a volcanic performance as his character raises valid questions on the degree of the defendants' accountability. As the trial moves along, two key episodes dominate the proceedings with two icons playing near-cameo roles. A fidgety Montgomery Clift plays a mentally unstable victim of Nazi sterility measures, and a downcast Judy Garland is an Aryan hausfrau accused of having sexual relations with a Jew, a crime punishable by death for the Jew guilty of ""racial pollution"". Kramer draws out brilliant turns on the stand by both actors.Burt Lancaster plays Ernst Janning, the only one among the four defendants who shows a trace of a conscience given his aristocratic background and known early resistance to the Third Reich. Even with aging make-up, the strapping actor appears physically wrong for the mostly passive role, but he manages to deliver his final testimony with knowing conviction. One of the other judges is a surprisingly vituperative Werner Klemperer memorable later as the befuddled Col. Klink on TV'sHogan's Heroes, and also in the supporting cast is a young William Shatner, well beforeStar Trek, as Haywood's aide. The legendary Marlene Dietrich plays a somewhat ancillary role as German widow Frau Bertholt, whose husband was put to death by Haywood for war crimes. In their key scene together, she and Tracy provide the film's most humane moments amid the unrelenting tension of the trial.Mann's script is superbly drawn out even if Kramer's ponderous direction can get a bit sluggish at times. The extras on the 2004 DVD are most worthwhile. First up is a twenty-minute conversation between Mann and Schell (""In Conversation with Abby Mann and Maximilian Schell""), where they talk extensively about not only the film but also the earlier ""Playhouse 90"" TV version and the 2001 Broadway production (in which Schell played Janning). There are two other shorts - a six-minute dissection of the script by Mann (""The Value of a Single Human Being"") and a 14-minute featurette about Kramer consisting primarily of interviews with his widow Karen (""A Tribute to Stanley Kramer""). There is also a photo gallery and the original theatrical trailer. I wish the DVD included the original TV version, but this is a superb telling of a most devastating episode in the recent history of mankind.",5,Essential Courtroom Drama Questions the Accountability of WWII War Crimes Via a Powerful Cast,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,3610,"['Screenwriter', 'Abby', 'Mann', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'died', 'day', 'other', 'just', 'past', 'week', 'revisit', 'eminently', 'powerful', '1961', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'more', 'appropriate', 'epic-length', '186', 'minutes', 'movie', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'one', 'many', 'trials', 'held', 'WWII', 'U.S.', 'Nuremberg', 'Military', 'Tribunal', 'one', '1948', 'trial', 'four', 'Nazi', 'judges', 'who', 'used', 'power', 'enable', 'Third', 'Reich', 'conduct', 'experiments', 'Jewish', 'prisoners', 'had', 'accountability', 'murder', 'brutalities', 'torture', 'other', 'atrocities', 'directed', 'Jews', 'Directed', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'Defiant', 'Ones', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'king', 'socially', 'conscious', 'cinema', 'late', 'fifties', 'sixties', 'film', 'deeply', 'ethics', 'assigning', 'war', 'crimes', 'responsibility', 'individuals.The', 'heavyweight', 'cast', 'primary', 'draw', 'here', 'quiet', 'authority', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Chief', 'Judge', 'Dan', 'Haywood', 'who', 'unenviable', 'task', 'presiding', 'tribunal', 'prosecution', 'attorney', 'Col.', 'Tad', 'Lawson', 'who', 'actual', 'footage', 'devastating', 'remains', 'German', 'concentration', 'camps', 'when', 'were', 'liberated', 'Widmark', 'Lawson', 'equal', 'parts', 'grit', 'petulance', 'Defense', 'attorney', 'Hans', 'Rolfe', 'portrayed', 'young', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'volcanic', 'performance', 'character', 'valid', 'questions', 'degree', 'defendants', 'accountability', 'trial', 'moves', 'along', 'two', 'key', 'episodes', 'dominate', 'proceedings', 'two', 'icons', 'playing', 'near-cameo', 'roles', 'fidgety', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'victim', 'Nazi', 'sterility', 'measures', 'downcast', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Aryan', 'hausfrau', 'accused', 'having', 'sexual', 'relations', 'Jew', 'crime', 'punishable', 'death', 'Jew', 'guilty', 'racial', 'pollution', 'Kramer', 'out', 'brilliant', 'turns', 'stand', 'actors.Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Ernst', 'Janning', 'only', 'one', 'four', 'defendants', 'who', 'trace', 'conscience', 'given', 'aristocratic', 'background', 'known', 'early', 'resistance', 'Third', 'Reich', 'Even', 'aging', 'make-up', 'strapping', 'actor', 'physically', 'wrong', 'mostly', 'passive', 'role', 'deliver', 'final', 'testimony', 'knowing', 'conviction', 'One', 'other', 'judges', 'surprisingly', 'vituperative', 'Werner', 'Klemperer', 'memorable', 'later', 'befuddled', 'Col.', 'Klink', ""TV'sHogan"", 'Heroes', 'also', 'supporting', 'cast', 'young', 'William', 'Shatner', 'well', 'beforeStar', 'Trek', 'Haywood', 'aide', 'legendary', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'somewhat', 'ancillary', 'role', 'German', 'widow', 'Frau', 'Bertholt', 'husband', 'was', 'put', 'death', 'Haywood', 'war', 'crimes', 'key', 'scene', 'together', 'Tracy', 'provide', 'film', 'most', 'humane', 'moments', 'unrelenting', 'tension', 'trial.Mann', 'script', 'superbly', 'drawn', 'out', 'even', 'Kramer', 'ponderous', 'direction', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'sluggish', 'times', 'extras', '2004', 'DVD', 'are', 'most', 'worthwhile', 'First', 'up', 'twenty-minute', 'conversation', 'Mann', 'Schell', 'Conversation', 'Abby', 'Mann', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'where', 'talk', 'extensively', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'also', 'earlier', 'Playhouse', '90', 'TV', 'version', '2001', 'Broadway', 'production', 'Schell', 'played', 'Janning', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'shorts', 'six-minute', 'dissection', 'script', 'Mann', 'Value', 'Single', 'Human', 'Being', '14-minute', 'featurette', 'Kramer', 'consisting', 'primarily', 'interviews', 'widow', 'Karen', 'Tribute', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'also', 'photo', 'gallery', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'wish', 'DVD', 'included', 'original', 'TV', 'version', 'superb', 'telling', 'most', 'devastating', 'episode', 'recent', 'history', 'mankind']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS

392200,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,630396155X,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[6, 9]","One rarely finds a movie that works on as many levels as Kramer's famous JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG. The film concerns an American judge (Spenser Tracy) sent to Germany to preside over a war-crimes trial at a point when American politicians are less concerned about justice than about securing German support re the Cold War.  As such, the film concerns not only the Nazi atrocities on trial, but the American government's willingness to become accomplices after the fact if such will buttress America's own military interests. The film repeatedly raises questions concerning the price of such deliberate, feigned public ignorance--both as it was manifest in Nazi Germany before and during the war and as it is now becoming manifest in America and its allies after the war.The action of the film divides between the courtroom and the judge's personal experiences in Nuremberg.  The courtroom scenes are quite powerful, with Maximillian Schell as the attorney for the defense who argues that his clients knew nothing of the holocaust and Richard Widmark who argues that one could not live in Nazi Germany without being aware of the holocaust.  At the same time the judge finds the same battle in his social life when he meets Marlene Dietrich, widow of a Nazi officer, who insists that the German people (herself among them) were completely ignorant of Nazi atrocities and who clearly feels judgement of the German people should be quietly set aside now that the war is over.  Ultimately, of course, Tracy must pass judgement both in the court and in his personal relationships on the degree to which claims of ignorance can be accepted as truth--and must accept responsibility for the result.Tracy and Dietrich's remarkable performances are equalled by Widmark and Schell.  Indeed, the entire cast--which includes Burt Lancaster, Judy Garland, and Montgomery Cliff--is particularly fine.  The script is remarkable for its directness, the cinematography is quite basic, and the score is both discreet and atmospheric.  The film's conclusion, which includes a confrontation between judge Tracy and accused Lancaster, is extremely memorable.  Although some may find the film a bit long or a bit too intellectual, most will be impressed with virtually every aspect of JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG--and most particularly with the casual restraint with which it tells it story and makes it powerful point.

Williams ""gareth37""","[6, 7]","When a nation is facing insurmountable issues and problems, what is moral and what is right can take a backseat to political expediency.  History has shown that a nation in crisis can take a misguided path with tragic consequences.Judgment At Nuremberg takes a meticulous look at four German jurists who sacrificed the principles of justice and decency for their homeland and Fuehrer.  In many ways this film as written by Abby Mann, Oscar winner, and directed by Stanley Kramer explores this human tendency to allow the good of the state to replace the rule of just law for all citizens.This film has a stellar cast headed by the incredible Spencer Tracy as Chief Judge Dan Haywood, a country lawyer from Maine given a difficult case which was a Catch 22.  No matter what the outcome there were no winners.Maximilian Schell in his Oscar winning performance as the defense counsel for the German jurists is pure brilliance. He is just a great actor.Burt Lancaster, as Dr. Ernst Janning, Minister of Justice, is an excellent look at a man lost in his guilt. One could not help but feel for Janning, especially when he gives his passionate speech about the ""fever"" in the land.  The closing scene between him and Haywood is priceless as the iron jail door closes on him as he realizes the magnitude of that one decision he made back in 1935 and the ultimate consequences.Richard Widmark played the prosecutor Colonel Tad Lawson flawlessly.  His crusade for justice overrode his humanity and compassion.Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift as two victims were riveting in their testimonies.  Marlene Dietrich as the widow of a German General executed by the Americans was a tragic figure who did not or could not accept what her country did to millions of innocent victims. Her defense of her husband was commendable.A very young William Shatner played Captain Harry Byers to a tee.  Of course, he had the only romantic interest in the film with a German girl.In many ways the film is a commentary on McCarthyism.  What happened during this time period in America ( late 1940s and 50s ) demonstrate that truth, justice and the American way can be tabled when fear grips the nation, especially fear inspired by the powerful few.The film was nominated for 11 Oscars and 6 Golden Globes.

392202,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,630396155X,"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel""","[3, 3]","What is justice?  Who gets to decide right from wrong?  Who must be held accountable when a wrong is committed in the name of the state, in the name of the nation as a whole, and in the name of the law itself?  Do the people bear a collective guilt for the actions of their leaders, or do we reserve blame only for those at the top?  What is the patriotic duty of the citizen when the government is in the wrong?  What is the duty of the civil servant, the soldier, the policeman, the judge?  And who gets to decide that the government is in the wrong?  If the government insists that its actions are necessary and proper, then what right does the citizen, the soldier, or the civil servant have to reject that claim and openly defy the authority of the state?  Who has the right to make the laws?  Who has the right to judge whether a law is just?  Who has the right to defy unjust laws?  Who has the duty to do so?  What is the proper role and responsibility of the judge?  Is it to uphold the law even at the expense of justice, or is it to do justice even in defiance of the law?  And who is to say whether or not a law is just?  Who judges the judges?These are the sorts of tough questions that are raised by this movie.  And it actually takes them seriously, presents well-reasoned and passionate arguments for competing points of view, and doesn't try to give the audience easy answers.  You should feel uncomfortable after watching this film.  You should have a lot more questions, doubts, and uncertainties about the true meaning of justice at the end of this movie than you had at the beginning.  It should leave you with the nagging feeling that, although the final verdict in this case may have been just, the big issues raised by this case have not really been resolved, and may never be resolvable.  Justice is not the mechanical application of some universally agreed-upon legal formula that is guaranteed to produce an intellectually and emotionally satisfying verdict.  Justice is messy; it is controversial; and it is never quite as satisfying as we'd like it to be.  Judges simply have to do the best they can, and try to wrestle a just outcome out of the laws they are sworn to uphold.  So, the irony of judges being put on trial for the ""crime"" of upholding the law should not be lost on anyone.  Yes, in this case, the law itself was unjust; but the judges didn't make the law, nor could they have changed it.  But did they have a legal duty -- a duty, not to the existing law of the land, of course, but to a higher law with universal jurisdiction -- to refuse to uphold unjust laws?  And does any court have the authority or the right to punish them for failing to do so?  This is, perhaps, the ultimate legal dilemma.This movie is a work of fiction, though it is based on actual events (much in the same way that director Stanley Kramer's previous film, ""Inherit the Wind"", was a fictionalized portrayal of the infamous Scopes ""Monkey"" Trial).  The events depicted in this film take place near the end of the Nuremberg war crimes tribunals that were held shortly after the end of the Second World War.  The Nazi leaders responsible for the war and the Holocaust had already been tried and sentenced; and many of them had already been executed.  Interest in the tribunals had waned, as both Germans and Americans wanted to get closure on the war and the Nazi era, and get on with their lives.  The Western allies were preoccupied with the emerging Cold War and the ongoing dispute with the Soviets over the status of Berlin; and they needed the support of the German people.  Under these circumstances, the Nuremberg trials were starting to be seen as a nuisance.  Zealous prosecutors, having hanged or imprisoned most of the top Nazi leadership, were now starting to go after the ""little fish"", including a number of officials in the German government who were not involved in the formulation of Nazi policies, but who went along with those policies once they were in place.  As the legal and moral culpability of the defendants became more disputable, the trials themselves became more controversial.  Many Germans were starting to feel that what had begun as a high-minded effort to bring notorious war criminals to justice was starting to degenerate into a petty postwar settling of scores, in which bitter Americans were seeking to punish ordinary Germans for allowing Hitler to rise to power and wage war against the United States and its allies.  After all, by what legitimate authority can an ad hoc military tribunal set up by an occupying power pass legal judgment on the civilian officials of a (previously) sovereign state -- officials who have not personally committed any war crimes under the generally recognized laws of war, or any crimes under the laws of the state that (formerly) had jurisdiction over them -- solely for the alleged ""crime"" of serving under an evil regime and carrying out its immoral policies?  A tribunal of this sort would represent an unprecedented challenge to the very notion of state sovereignty -- the principle that every state has the absolute right to govern itself according to its own laws, and that no state has the right to interfere in the purely internal affairs of any other state.  But, in the aftermath of the most destructive war in history, and especially after the truth about the Holocaust had come to light, the American occupation forces were in no mood to debate the finer points of international law when it came to bringing the perpetrators of Nazi atrocities to justice; so a number of German government officials were put on trial essentially for doing their jobs, and acting in accordance with the law of the land, while Hitler was in power.Some of the officials put on trial were judges and prosecutors.  They were charged with aiding and abetting the Nazis' oppression of their political rivals (especially communists) and of racial minorities (especially Jews).  In essence, these judicial officials were alleged to have prosecuted, tried, and convicted people whose only ""crime"" was belonging to the wrong political faction or the wrong ethnic group, in some cases sentencing them to death or to forced sterilization.  But these accused officials insisted that they were not trying to pervert justice in order to advance the Nazi cause.  Rather, they were simply doing their jobs as officers of the court: insuring that the law of the land was followed to the letter by all who fell under the court's jurisdiction, without prejudice.  They claimed that all those who were prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced by German courts were actually guilty of crimes under German law.  During the Nazi era, a number of laws were passed that many people, including many judges and prosecutors, saw as unjust.  But, in Germany, just as in the United States, it is the duty of every judge and prosecutor to uphold the law, whether he agrees with it or not.  Judges and prosecutors are not meant to be legislators or politicians.  Their job is to see that the law of the land is followed, not to dictate what that law ought to be or how the country ought to be run.  If laws are unjust, that is the fault of lawmakers, not judicial officials.  So it's not really fair to hold judges and prosecutors accountable for bad laws passed by evil politicians.  Or at least that's what the German judicial officials tried at Nuremberg would have us believe.This movie is a fictionalized account of the trial of these judges and prosecutors for their (alleged) complicity in the crimes of the Nazi regime.  It is brilliantly acted, especially by Maximilian Schell, who plays the young German lawyer responsible for defending the accused judicial officials, and by Montgomery Clift, who gives an amazing performance as a man who had been forcibly sterilized for feeblemindedness under Nazi-era eugenics laws.  Also of note are Spencer Tracy, who plays the presiding judge over the tribunal, and Burt Lancaster, who plays the chief defendant, a highly respected German jurist who, though he hated Hitler, felt he could still do some good as a judicial official, even under Nazi rule.  The movie also features Richard Widmark as the chief American prosecutor, Judy Garland as a key witness at the trial, Marlene Dietrich as the widow of a German general who had been tried and hanged in an earlier phase of the Nuremberg trials, and a young William Shatner as the military aide to the presiding judge.If you are a student of law, political science, or philosophy -- in fact, if you are studying any of the humanities or social sciences -- you really need to see this film.  It is definitely thought provoking, and would be a great catalyst for group discussion.  It's a bit too long for classroom use (about 3 hours); but if you're an educator and can somehow arrange for your students to watch it, it would really be worth it, whether you're teaching law, ethics, political philosophy, history, critical thinking, or rhetoric and debate.  (Or drama, for that matter, since there's some really good acting in this movie.)  I encourage you to take the time to watch it.  It truly is an excellent film.",5,A powerful and important film,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,9169,"['What', 'justice', 'Who', 'decide', 'right', 'wrong', 'Who', 'must', 'be', 'held', 'accountable',

Set in 1948 this 1961 film covers the Nuremberg trials when judges were put on trial for their decisions during Hitler's rule. The acting to an individual is outstanding. Spencer Tracey, who presides over the trials, is an American judge recently turned out of office by the electorate, a rube from Maine who has the uncanny ability to get to the truth. His performance, his facial expressions, his eyes are a joy to watch. Richard Widmark for the prosecution is on fire with righteous indignation at the atrocities the defendants have committed. Maximilian Schell as the attorney for the defense-- he won a much-deserved Academy Award-- attempts to show that his client was only obeying German law.  Bert Lancaster gives one of his best performances ever as Ernst Janny, a judge who was just doing his job. Montgomery Clift as a man who has been ordered sterilized by the German judiciary should have won an Academy Award. Judy Garland as a German woman accused of having an affair with an older Jewish man is superb. The ageless and beautiful Marlene Dietrich as the wife of an executed Nazi officer is magnificent. Finally a very young William Shatner recently of the television series ""Boston Legal"" completes the major players in this timeless film.Mr. Kramer used  actual footage from the concentration camps in this black and white film, much of which-- the outside scenes-- was shot in Germany.

The courtroom scenes are full of glowing performances but most especially the performances of Spencer Tracy as (Chief Judge Haywood), Burt Lancaster (as Dr. Ernst Janning), and Maximilian Schell (as Hans Rolfe) were quite simply stunning. Be that as it may, this movie is not for the faint of heart. The subject matter (judges accused of atrocities during the holocaust) is quite graphic and includes actual footage of concentration camps and extermination methods used by the Nazis upon their victims. I found myself hard pressed to keep my eyes on the screen while bulldozers shoved hundreds and thousands of cadavers into mass graves. Many of us, in these modern times, forget how truly awful it was. There are those among us who use terms like ""it's worse than what the Nazis did to the Jews"" to describe things as trivial and stupid as a parking ticket. This movie explores the question of justice versus law and how, sometimes, those two things can be exclusive. If you feel that you have a strong enough stomach to handle aforementioned documentary footage and you love a good drama film then I highly recommend this movie to you.P.S.

392208,A1345VRK5MYG7,630396155X,James L.,"[37, 40]","Spencer Tracy stars as an American judge who travels to Germany in 1948 to take part in the Nuremberg trials.  For eight months he chairs the panel trying four German judges, one of whom is respected scholar Burt Lancaster.  Defense Attorney Maxmillian Schell makes the case that the men were simply following the law as written in Nazi Germany and cannot be held accountable for the brutality inflicted on those found guilty.  Prosecutor Richard Widmark argues that the men knew what they were doing and understood the fate of those found guilty and that they acted inhumanely.  Both men argue their cases well in a trial marked by emotion and great drama.  Judgment at Nuremberg is a powerful movie, since it deals with atrocities and wounds that may never be completely healed.  It also deals with a fundamental question that surrounds war:  Are people who are simply following orders (or the law as it exists in their country) to be held responsible for their actions and the fate of those they affect.  The film's screenplay is sharp, honest, and makes points on both sides, although emotion certainly affects how one answers the questions it raises.  More than anything, however, this movie is about acting.  Tracy is the rock that centres the film, the weight of his characters decisions ever present on his face and in his motions.  Schell and Widmark have plenty of chances to set off fireworks as the lawyers, and they take full advantage of the opportunity.  Lancaster is quietly strong and imposing, never getting much dialogue, but establishing a presence throughout the whole film.  Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift have brief scenes as victims of Nazi laws who testify against the defendants.  Both actors give outstanding performances, almost uncomfortable to watch they are so real.  Marlene Dietrich as the widow of an executed Nazi general is also very strong in one of her last performances.  Her scenes with Tracy are a joy to watch - two old pros who have seen a lot in their lives.  Judgment at Nuremberg is a long film, but it never lags.  Whether you simply watch it as a fine courtroom drama or take its messages about responsibility deeper, it is well worth watching.

In books like Sir Martin Gilbert's brillant (but horrific) ""Holocaust', especially, and ""Hitler's Willing Executioners"", we've learned that EVERY German was well aware of the Jewish torture and extermination campaign, although they've always protested the fact.The witnesses who testify in this film did not represent to me the inconceivable terror that befell the 9 to 12 million victims who perished at the hands of the Nazi death squads. A miscast Burt Lancaster portrays an attorney who obeyed the Nazi regime in his unscrupulous representation of a Jewish family. Montgomery Cliff is a former inmate of a concentration where he was castrated by a demonic doctor.These crimes are chilling to someone who has yet to discover just how nightmarish the Nazi reign really was.To those who have studied the German nightmare, we think of horrendous massacres in forests and pastures of tens of thousands of German Jews (old people, teenagers, infants, etc), the slaughter and torture of millions of Jews in the death camps, the way the young Nazi pleaded to be the ones who slaughtered infants--by tossing them in the air and catching them on bayonets.What I'd love to see is a brand new movie in 2010 that shows us the sheer evil of Hitler's madmen. Quinton Tarantino did something like this in his ""Inglorius Basterds.""

392213,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,630396155X,J from NY,"[3, 3]","""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is a brilliantly understated meditation on the most ordinary man's capacity for unimaginable evil under the collective spell of notions like ""nation"" and ""country"".As Chief Judge Dan Haywood, Spencer Tracy delivers one of the best performances in film history: he isn't some sentimental, saccharine moral pedant, but a man from Texas who has been given the particularly unpleasant task of sentencing the leftovers of the Nazi Regime--the judges and doctor--to whatever sentence he deems fit.  Tracy's character is not, at the outset of the film, fully convinced of Germany's collective guilt and the beautiful Marlene Dietrich plays the foil to his sense of morality.The gorgeous widow of a particularly influential and vicious SS officer who was court martialed and sentenced to death by firing squad by the man acting as prosecutor in the case of the three judges' Haywood is trying, she has developed a marked antipathy for Americans and their ""absurd"" insistance that the average German could have had any complicity or knowledge of what the Third Reich was doing with ""socially undesirables"" and Jews.  Dietrich gives a chillingly convincing performance as a woman locked in self-denial and bitterness, and the scene in the nightclub has subtle, creeping echoes of the hatred that led to the decadence and madness of Hitler's ""Final Solution"".Along with Tracy, Burt Lancaster makes this movie with his tortured performance as Dr. Ernst Janning, a former Nazi judge who, despite being a hero in his homeland before Hitler's rise to power, succumbed knowingly to the temptations and dubious benefits of the Nazi Terror.  Unlike his co-defendants (one unrepentant fanatic and a coward who feigns insanity),Janning is determined to keep his brilliant Defense Lawyer played by Maximillian Schell at bay and to acknowledge his inescapable role in the madness which swept Germany.  He is a wasted, lost yet responsible man who makes one last bid for salvation through unflinching honesty.The relationship between Haywood and Janning is symbolic in many ways--both are born to judge in the judicial sense and have done so for many years.  The difference is that one maintained his sense of ethics even in the hardest of times and the other succumbed to the temptations of his horrific time period over the most basic judicial ethics and standard human compassion.Despite the pressure of American military personnel to give these men (particularly Janning) lenient sentences because of the mistaken idea that the ongoing conflict with the Soviet Union might lead to the need for German military support (an obvious illusion in retrospect), Haywood does not waver and gives all three life imprisonment.Unfortunately this film is not entirely historically accurate; many former Nazi Judges and doctors were acquitted during this period.  The American public was apparently satisfied with the Nuremburg trials at which the figureheads of the Nazi Party were tried and hanged and wanted nothing more to do with it.  After WWII, many in this country committed the understandable crime of wanting to forget, not wanting to know: history has revealed this to be the worst thing of all.  All thatnotwithstanding, this is an unforgettable, important, beautiful film.",5,"""You should have known the first time...""",1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,3277,"['Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'brilliantly', 'understated', 'meditation', 'most', 'ordinary', 'man', 'capacity', 'unimaginable', 'evil', 'collective', 'spell', 'notions', 'nation', 'country', 'Chief', 'Judge', 'Dan', 'Haywood', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'history', ""n't"", 'sentimental', 'saccharine', 'moral', 'pedant', 'man', 'Texas', 'who', 'been', 'given', 'particularly', 'unpleasant', 'task', 'sentencing', 'leftovers', 'Nazi', 'Regime', 'judges', 'doctor', 'whatever', 'sentence', 'fit', 'Tracy', 'character', 'not', 'outset', 'film', 'fully', 'convinced', 'Germany', 'collective', 'guilt', 'beautiful', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'foil', 'sense', 'morality.The', 'gorgeous', 'widow', 'particularly', 'influential', 'vicious', 'SS', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'court', 'martialed', 'sentenced', 'death', 'firing', 'squad', 'man', 'acting', 'prosecutor', 'case', 'three', 'judges', 'Haywood', 'trying', 'developed', 'marked', 'antipathy', 'Americans', 'absurd', 'insistance', 'average', 'German', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'complicity', 'knowledge', 'what', 'Third', 'Reich', 'was', 'doing', 'socially', 'undesirables', 'Jews', 'Dietrich', 'chillingly', 'convincing', 'performance', 'woman', 'locked', 'self-denial', 'bitterness', 'scene', 'nightclub', 'subtle', 'creeping', 'echoes', 'hatred', 'led', 'decadence', 'madness', 'Hitler', 'Final', 'Solution', '.Along', 'Tracy', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'movie', 'tortured', 'performance', 'Dr.', 'Ernst', 'Janning', 'former', 'Nazi', 'judge', 'who', 'being', 'hero', 'homeland', 'Hitler', 'rise', 'power', 'succumbed', 'knowingly', 'temptations', 'dubious', 'benefits', 'Nazi', 'Terror', 'co-defendants', 'one', 'unrepentant', 'fanatic', 'coward', 'who', 'insanity', 'Janning', 'determined', 'keep', 'brilliant', 'Defense', 'Lawyer', 'played', 'Maximillian', 'Schell', 'bay', 'acknowledge', 'inescapable', 'role', 'madness', 'swept', 'Germany', 'wasted', 'lost', 'yet', 'responsible', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'last', 'bid', 'salvation', 'unflinching', 'honesty.The', 'relationship', 'Haywood', 'Janning', 'symbolic', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'born', 'judge', 'judicial', 'sense', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'difference', 'one', 'maintained', 'sense', 'ethics', 'even', 'hardest', 'times', 'other', 'succumbed', 'temptations', 'horrific', 'time', 'period', 'most', 'basic', 'judicial', 'ethics', 'standard', 'human', 'compassion.Despite', 'pressure', 'American', 'military', 'personnel', 'give', 'men', 'particularly', 'Janning', 'lenient', 'sentences', 'mistaken', 'idea', 'ongoing', 'conflict', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'might', 'lead', 'need', 'German', 'military', 'support', 'obvious', 'illusion', 'retrospect', 'Haywood', 'not', 'waver', 'three', 'life', 'imprisonment.Unfortunately', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'historically', 'accurate', 'many', 'former', 'Nazi', 'Judges', 'doctors', 'were', 'acquitted', 'period', 'American', 'public', 'was', 'apparently', 'satisfied', 'Nuremburg', 'trials', 'figureheads', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'were', 'tried', 'hanged', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'more', 'do', 'WWII', 'many', 'country', 'committed', 'understandable', 'crime', 'wanting', 'forget', 'not', 'wanting', 'know', 'history', 'revealed', 'be', 'worst', 'thing', 'thatnotwithstanding', 'unforgettable', 'important', 'beautiful', 'film']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS
392214,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,630396155X,JGC,"[2, 3]","...Judgment at Nuremberg is the greatest narrative war-era film in all of American cinematic history.""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is an epic film that completely engulfs the viewer because of the nature and the severity of the subject matter. It is absolutely impossible to say who gave a better performance because the entire cast was perfect. Never has there been another motion picture with so many first-rate stars who all gave the performances of their collective careers.The film is directed by Stanley Kramer, based on the screenplay by Abby Mann. And the main cast includes:Spencer Tracy / Judge Dan HaywoodBurt Lancaster / Dr. Ernst Janning (defendant/judge)Richard Widmark / Col. Lawson (prosecuting attorney)Marlene Dietrich / Mrs. BertholtMaximilian Schell / Hans Rolfe (defense attorney)Judy Garland / Mrs. Hoffman WallnerMontgomery Clift / Rudolph Petersen (prosecution witness)William Shatner / Capt. Harrison Byers (Judge Haywood's aide)The performance of Spencer Tracy does stand out though. After all it's really his film. He was the type of man who didn't need to say very much for anyone to get what he was communicating. His facial and body expressions were just as detailed and expressive as the words that he said. My favorite line was towards the very end when Judge Haywood told the defense attorney that: just because it's logical doesn't mean that it's right. As far as I'm concerned those are words to live by. And he said them perfectly, it wasn't like some big speech. It was just said very nonchalantly which made it that much more important.Marlene Dietrich as Mrs. Bertholt was another member of the cast who didn't need to say much because her entire aura said it all. She was probably the premiere entertainer of the golden era and although she has a rather small role in this film it is still one of her very best. Mr. Burt Lancaster was another extraordinary, larger-than-life actor, playing the role of Ernest Janning (one of the defendants). Dr. Janning said very little until he could take no more and when he finally spoke it was as if the floodgates swung open with all rapidity. Mr. Burt Lancaster is probably the only thespian who is talented enough to give this character such a heart and body and mind and make him appear almost victimized.The film is over 3 hours long (190 minutes to be exact). Generally when I watch a movie that's more than 2 hours I tend to get restless and start thinking that the editor didn't do his job very well. ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" though is the perfect length because it tells the entire story, from beginning, to end. Perhaps it's no coincidence that there was a television series that was based on the original screenplay which predates the film.Miss Judy Garland gives what is unequivocally her most decisive dramatic role ever. She enters the picture 90 minutes into the film and is only in 3 scenes, however she still captures just as much attention as the other stars. Besides her beautiful eyes that she could never hide under any circumstance, you'll almost be unable to recognize her because she looked and sounded so un-Judy Garland. There wasn't a touch of glamour in Irene Hoffman Wallner. Instead she was this scared and almost timid lady who had been beaten down by the ravages of the extreme brutality that was all around her. The second time she took the witness stand was perhaps my favorite part of the entire movie because all of a sudden Mrs. Hoffman Wallner became so transfixed and animated because of that vicious lie that the defense attorney tried to shove down everyone's throats.""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is a larger-than-life, behemoth story that needs to be told because it articulates the effects of what happens when evil is afforded totalitarianism. They say sloth is one of the seven deadly sins and after viewing this film I can certainly understand why. It's also an important movie because there is no winner and it doesn't end with a happy ending, (at least as far as I'm concerned I didn't see anything happy in this picture). Instead, it's one of those rare movies which conveys that there's a thin line between man's benevolence and man's utter bankrupt corruption.",5,"Is it any wonder that with a triumphant director, an all-star cast & an out-of-sight screenplay...",1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,4177,"['Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'greatest', 'narrative', 'war-era', 'film', 'American', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'epic', 'film', 'completely', 'engulfs', 'viewer', 'nature', 'severity', 'subject', 'matter', 'absolutely', 'impossible', 'say', 'who', 'gave', 'better', 'performance', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'perfect', 'Never', 'there', 'been', 'motion', 'picture', 'so', 'many', 'first-rate', 'stars', 'who', 'gave', 'performances', 'collective', 'careers.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'based', 'screenplay', 'Abby', 'Mann', 'main', 'cast', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', '/', 'Judge', 'Dan', 'HaywoodBurt', 'Lancaster', '/', 'Dr.', 'Ernst', 'Janning', 'defendant/judge', 'Richard', 'Widmark', '/', 'Col.', 'Lawson', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', '/', 'Mrs.', 'BertholtMaximilian', 'Schell', '/', 'Hans', 'Rolfe', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Judy', 'Garland', '/', 'Mrs.', 'Hoffman', 'WallnerMontgomery', 'Clift', '/', 'Rudolph', 'Petersen', 'prosecution', 'witness', 'William', 'Shatner', '/', 'Capt', 'Harrison', 'Byers', 'Judge', 'Haywood', 'aide', 'performance', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'stand', 'out', 'really', 'film', 'was', 'type', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'say', 'very', 'much', 'anyone', 'get', 'what', 'was', 'communicating', 'facial', 'body', 'expressions', 'were', 'just', 'detailed', 'expressive', 'words', 'said', 'My', 'favorite', 'line', 'was', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'Judge', 'Haywood', 'told', 'defense', 'attorney', 'just', 'logical', ""n't"", 'mean', 'right', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'are', 'words', 'live', 'said', 'perfectly', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'speech', 'was', 'just', 'said', 'very', 'nonchalantly', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'important.Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Mrs.', 'Bertholt', 'was', 'member', 'cast', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'say', 'much', 'entire', 'aura', 'said', 'was', 'probably', 'premiere', 'entertainer', 'golden', 'era', 'rather', 'small', 'role', 'film', 'still', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'Mr.', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'larger-than-life', 'actor', 'playing', 'role', 'Ernest', 'Janning', 'one', 'defendants', 'Dr.', 'Janning', 'said', 'very', 'little', 'could', 'take', 'more', 'when', 'finally', 'spoke', 'was', 'floodgates', 'swung', 'open', 'rapidity', 'Mr.', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'probably', 'only', 'thespian', 'who', 'talented', 'enough', 'give', 'character', 'heart', 'body', 'mind', 'make', 'appear', 'almost', 'victimized.The', 'film', '3', 'hours', 'long', '190', 'minutes', 'be', 'exact', 'Generally', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', '2', 'hours', 'tend', 'get', 'restless', 'start', 'thinking', 'editor', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'job', 'very', 'well', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'though', 'perfect', 'length', 'entire', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'Perhaps', 'coincidence', 'was', 'television', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'original', 'screenplay', 'film.Miss', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'what', 'unequivocally', 'most', 'decisive', 'dramatic', 'role', 'ever', 'picture', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'only', '3', 'scenes', 'however', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'other', 'stars', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'could', 'never', 'hide', 'circumstance', ""'ll"", 'almost', 'be', 'unable', 'recognize', 'looked', 'sounded', 'so', 'un-Judy', 'Garland', 'was', ""n't"", 'touch', 'glamour', 'Irene', 'Hoffman', 'Wallner', 'Instead', 'was', 'scared', 'almost', 'timid', 'lady', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'beaten', 'down', 'ravages', 'extreme', 'brutality', 'was', 'second', 'time', 'took', 'witness', 'stand', 'was', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'sudden', 'Mrs.', 'Hoffman', 'Wallner', 'became', 'so', 'transfixed', 'animated', 'vicious', 'lie', 'defense', 'attorney', 'tried', 'shove', 'down', 'everyone', 'throats', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'larger-than-life', 'behemoth', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'effects', 'what', 'when', 'evil', 'afforded', 'totalitarianism', 'say', 'one', 'seven', 'deadly', 'sins', 'viewing', 'film', 'can', 'certainly', 'understand', 'why', 'also', 'important', 'movie', 'winner', ""n't"", 'end', 'happy', 'ending', 'least', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'happy', 'picture', 'Instead', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'conveys', 'thin', 'line', 'man', 'benevolence', 'man', 'utter', 'bankrupt', 'corruption']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS

392221,A2BTYX4QNN3S20,630396155X,JR Dunn,"[8, 9]","Jeeze, I guess they'll let just about anything go out of circulation these days.Back in the pre-Schindler era, this film possessed considerable mana as one of the most effective of the early films dealing with Nazi war crimes--rather surprising, considering it was produced and directed by the mediocre Stanley Kramer, auteur of any number of simplistic '50s ""social problem"" pictures.Part of the film's power comes from its narrow focus: it deals with the little-known 1948 ""judge's trial"" rather than the earlier trials of the regime's big figures, allowing the film to concentrate on matters of justice rather than more sensational aspects.But most of the credit goes to the actors, who do an outstanding job virtually without exception, easily overcoming the film's slow pace and Kramer's obvious directorial failings. Of the principals, Tracy and Dietrich turn in effective variations of their customary roles of the period, the low-key man of decency and the aging but still potent high-class femme. Widmark is very fine here; this is one of his few ""good-guy"" roles that allowed him  to utilize the obsessive qualities apparent in his sociopath portrayals. Too bad he didn't do more like this.But the two outstanding performances are Clift and Lancaster. Clift plays a man driven mad by his suffering under the Nazis, in a portrayal that is excruciating to watch (with our knowledge that it reflects Clift's own personal agonies) and utterly unforgettable, for all that it lasts a total of fifteen minutes or so. Lancaster, as Dr. Emil Jannings, is another matter. He says almost nothing for the first hour-and-a-half of the film, but his presence dominates proceedings all the same. And when he at last  speaks, his portrayal of a man clinging to the last shreds of dignity, knowing he has not earned them and does not deserve them, is nearly as harrowing as Clift's. Beginning with ""All My Sons"" in the 40s, Lancaster did a number of pictures on this level when he wasn't playing acrobats or cowboys. It would be nice for some Amazonite to put together a List.(It should be noted that this is probably your sole opportunity to see William Shatner in a role in which he does not overact. In a just world the secret behind this, which Kramer kept to himself, would have been turned over to the UN for distribution to the international film community.)In the end, ""Nuremberg"" does not match its subject. No film could, but Kramer's implication that his particular brand of earnest liberalism is the antidote to government terror comes across as especially inane. It didn't help in Germany, and it wouldn't help anywhere else. But revealing what doesn't work paves the way toward discovering what does. On that level, at least, ""Nuremberg"" is a worthwhile effort.",4,Kramer's High Point,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,2768,"['Jeeze', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'let', 'just', 'anything', 'go', 'circulation', 'days.Back', 'pre-Schindler', 'era', 'film', 'possessed', 'considerable', 'mana', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'early', 'films', 'dealing', 'Nazi', 'war', 'crimes', 'rather', 'surprising', 'considering', 'was', 'produced', 'directed', 'mediocre', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'auteur', 'number', 'simplistic', 'social', 'problem', 'pictures.Part', 'film', 'power', 'narrow', 'focus', 'little-known', '1948', 'judge', 'trial', 'rather', 'earlier', 'trials', 'regime', 'big', 'figures', 'allowing', 'film', 'concentrate', 'matters', 'justice', 'rather', 'more', 'sensational', 'aspects.But', 'most', 'credit', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'virtually', 'exception', 'easily', 'overcoming', 'film', 'slow', 'pace', 'Kramer', 'obvious', 'directorial', 'failings', 'principals', 'Tracy', 'Dietrich', 'turn', 'effective', 'variations', 'customary', 'roles', 'period', 'low-key', 'man', 'decency', 'aging', 'still', 'potent', 'high-class', 'femme', 'Widmark', 'very', 'fine', 'here', 'one', 'few', 'good-guy', 'roles', 'allowed', 'utilize', 'obsessive', 'qualities', 'apparent', 'sociopath', 'portrayals', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'two', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'are', 'Clift', 'Lancaster', 'Clift', 'man', 'driven', 'mad', 'suffering', 'Nazis', 'portrayal', 'excruciating', 'watch', 'knowledge', 'Clift', 'own', 'personal', 'agonies', 'utterly', 'unforgettable', 'total', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'Lancaster', 'Dr.', 'Emil', 'Jannings', 'matter', 'almost', 'nothing', 'first', 'hour-and-a-half', 'film', 'presence', 'dominates', 'proceedings', 'same', 'when', 'last', 'speaks', 'portrayal', 'man', 'clinging', 'last', 'shreds', 'dignity', 'knowing', 'not', 'earned', 'not', 'deserve', 'nearly', 'as', 'harrowing', 'Clift', 'Beginning', 'My', 'Sons', '40s', 'Lancaster', 'did', 'number', 'pictures', 'level', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'playing', 'acrobats', 'cowboys', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'Amazonite', 'put', 'together', 'List', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'probably', 'sole', 'opportunity', 'see', 'William', 'Shatner', 'role', 'not', 'overact', 'just', 'world', 'secret', 'Kramer', 'kept', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'UN', 'distribution', 'international', 'film', 'community', 'end', 'Nuremberg', 'not', 'match', 'subject', 'film', 'could', 'Kramer', 'implication', 'particular', 'brand', 'earnest', 'liberalism', 'antidote', 'government', 'terror', 'especially', 'inane', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Germany', 'would', ""n't"", 'help', 'anywhere', 'else', 'revealing', 'what', ""n't"", 'work', 'paves', 'way', 'discovering', 'what', 'level', 'least', 'Nuremberg', 'worthwhile', 'effort']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS
392222,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,630396155X,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[11, 13]","JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG is a splendid fictionalization of the ""Justices' Trial"" held at Nuremberg after World War II. While much less well-known than the initial War Crimes Trial of 1945-46 which sentenced Hermann Goering and other leading Nazis, the actual ""Justices' Trial"" was unique in that it put sixteen leading German jurists on trial for participating in the Nazi legal system.Spencer Tracy plays a rural American Federal District Court judge who is selected to preside over the trial of four defendants accused of sentencing prisoners to torture and death for such 'crimes' as mental incompetency, anti-Nazi statements, and race defilement (i.e., having personal relationships with ""Untermenschen"" such as Jews and Gypsies). Tracy is bewildered as he struggles to understand how the Germans, an obviously cultured and gregarious people, could fall into the destructive death grip of National Socialism. His final conclusions are shattering and should resonate in the inner core of any viewer.While in Nuremberg, Tracy strikes up a relationship with the aristocratic widow of a German military officer executed for butchering American soldiers at Malmedy (played by Marlene Dietrich) who expresses nothing but disdain for Hitler, and yet fails to grasp the enormity of the vast societal crime committed during the war years.Played out against the background of the rapidly spreading Cold War, the later Nuremberg Trials were seen by most as unnecessary excesses; the need to enlist the Germans as allies (in 1948) threatens to derail the legal process as American officers begin to unconsciously parrot the pragmatic language of wartime Germans who ""went along"" with Nazism in a spirit of expediency.Richard Widmark plays the American prosecutor who unrepentingly dedicates himself to exacting punishment for Nazi crimes against humanity. Among his evidence are documentary films of the concentration camps. JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG marked the first time these horrifying images were used in a mass-media entertainment production.Maximilian Schell plays the young, earnest defense counsel whose dedication to Germany virtually forces him into the Nazi mold. Schell, a newcomer at the time, won an Academy Award for his intense and frightening performance. His cross-examination of Frau Wallner (Judy Garland), a witness once accused of kissing a Jewish male friend, is a study in controlled hatred, and one of the finest character portrayals ever committed to film.Schell's moral descent is punctuated by his demand to know why only Germany is on trial when the Russians, British, the Americans, and even the Vatican turned a blind eye to the obvious degeneracy of Hitler who made no secret of his intentions. Schell's closing argument is impassioned, rational, and terrifying in its implications.As Schell descends into a relativistic darkness, the preeminent German jurist, Defendant Ernst Janning, (played by Burt Lancaster) struggles with his inner demons and begins to rise from the abyss, gaining a modicum of moral respite as he forcibly rebukes Schell, changes his plea to ""Guilty,"" and testifies as to the soul-destructive nature of ""a passing phase which became a way of life."" Lancaster's Janning is truly tragic, more so because he so clearly understands that ""he made his life excrement when he walked with [the Nazis].""Ultimately, Janning is faced with his own irredeemable failings. Yet, Janning (and the others) are not demons in human form, they are just men, men who chose the easier path. Just as any other human beings, the Nuremberg defendants were presented with the choice between morality and amorality. That they chose amorally is not an inherent defect of the Germans as a people; but it is a defect of the people of World War II Germany, and potentially of any people. The message of JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG is that every person must make the same choices with the same results, and with the same consequences.No actors today could carry such roles. The performers in JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG literally swallow the scenery, and the intensity of the story has rarely been matched, even by SCHINDLER'S LIST, the only war-era film worthy of comparison.The DVD transfer is excellent, though the DVD lacks very much in the way of special features. A particular oversight is the absence of any kind of real documentary on the actual Nuremberg Trials, something which would seem to be almost mandatory.JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG is a film which must be seen. It is a catalogue of the worst of human failings and an indictment of blind jingoism. It is also a paean to the value of every single human life.",5,"""There Are Devils Among Us.""",1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,4617,"['JUDGMENT', 'AT', 'NUREMBERG', 'splendid', 'fictionalization', 'Justices', 'Trial', 'held', 'Nuremberg', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'much', 'less', 'well-known', 'initial', 'War', 'Crimes', 'Trial', '1945-46', 'sentenced', 'Hermann', 'Goering', 'other', 'leading', 'Nazis', 'actual', 'Justices', 'Trial', 'was', 'unique', 'put', 'sixteen', 'leading', 'German', 'jurists', 'trial', 'participating', 'Nazi', 'legal', 'system.Spencer', 'Tracy', 'rural', 'American', 'Federal', 'District', 'Court', 'judge', 'who', 'selected', 'preside', 'trial', 'four', 'defendants', 'accused', 'sentencing', 'prisoners', 'torture', 'death', 'such', ""'crimes"", 'mental', 'incompetency', 'anti-Nazi', 'statements', 'race', 'defilement', 'i.e.', 'having', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Untermenschen', 'such', 'Jews', 'Gypsies', 'Tracy', 'bewildered', 'understand', 'how', 'Germans', 'obviously', 'cultured', 'gregarious', 'people', 'could', 'fall', 'destructive', 'death', 'grip', 'National', 'Socialism', 'final', 'conclusions', 'are', 'shattering', 'should', 'resonate', 'inner', 'core', 'viewer.While', 'Nuremberg', 'Tracy', 'up', 'relationship', 'aristocratic', 'widow', 'German', 'military', 'officer', 'executed', 'butchering', 'American', 'soldiers', 'Malmedy', 'played', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'who', 'nothing', 'disdain', 'Hitler', 'yet', 'fails', 'grasp', 'enormity', 'vast', 'societal', 'crime', 'committed', 'war', 'years.Played', 'out', 'background', 'rapidly', 'spreading', 'Cold', 'War', 'later', 'Nuremberg', 'Trials', 'were', 'seen', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'excesses', 'need', 'enlist', 'Germans', 'allies', '1948', 'derail', 'legal', 'process', 'American', 'officers', 'begin', 'unconsciously', 'parrot', 'pragmatic', 'language', 'wartime', 'Germans', 'who', 'went', 'Nazism', 'spirit', 'expediency.Richard', 'Widmark', 'American', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'unrepentingly', 'exacting', 'punishment', 'Nazi', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'evidence', 'are', 'documentary', 'films', 'concentration', 'camps', 'JUDGMENT', 'AT', 'NUREMBERG', 'marked', 'first', 'time', 'horrifying', 'images', 'were', 'used', 'mass-media', 'entertainment', 'production.Maximilian', 'Schell', 'young', 'earnest', 'defense', 'counsel', 'dedication', 'Germany', 'virtually', 'Nazi', 'mold', 'Schell', 'newcomer', 'time', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'intense', 'frightening', 'performance', 'cross-examination', 'Frau', 'Wallner', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'witness', 'once', 'accused', 'kissing', 'Jewish', 'male', 'friend', 'study', 'controlled', 'hatred', 'one', 'finest', 'character', 'portrayals', 'ever', 'committed', 'film.Schell', 'moral', 'descent', 'punctuated', 'demand', 'know', 'why', 'only', 'Germany', 'trial', 'when', 'Russians', 'British', 'Americans', 'even', 'Vatican', 'turned', 'blind', 'eye', 'obvious', 'degeneracy', 'Hitler', 'who', 'made', 'secret', 'intentions', 'Schell', 'closing', 'argument', 'impassioned', 'rational', 'terrifying', 'implications.As', 'Schell', 'relativistic', 'darkness', 'preeminent', 'German', 'jurist', 'Defendant', 'Ernst', 'Janning', 'played', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'inner', 'demons', 'rise', 'abyss', 'gaining', 'modicum', 'moral', 'respite', 'forcibly', 'Schell', 'plea', 'Guilty', 'testifies', 'soul-destructive', 'nature', 'passing', 'phase', 'became', 'way', 'life', 'Lancaster', 'Janning', 'truly', 'tragic', 'more', 'so', 'so', 'clearly', 'made', 'life', 'excrement', 'when', 'walked', '[', 'Nazis', ']', 'Ultimately', 'Janning', 'faced', 'own', 'irredeemable', 'failings', 'Janning', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'demons', 'human', 'form', 'are', 'just', 'men', 'men', 'who', 'chose', 'easier', 'path', 'Just', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'Nuremberg', 'defendants', 'were', 'presented', 'choice', 'morality', 'amorality', 'chose', 'amorally', 'not', 'inherent', 'defect', 'Germans', 'people', 'defect', 'people', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Germany', 'potentially', 'people', 'message', 'JUDGMENT', 'AT', 'NUREMBERG', 'person', 'must', 'make', 'same', 'choices', 'same', 'results', 'same', 'consequences.No', 'actors', 'today', 'could', 'carry', 'such', 'roles', 'performers', 'JUDGMENT', 'AT', 'NUREMBERG', 'literally', 'swallow', 'scenery', 'intensity', 'story', 'rarely', 'been', 'matched', 'even', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'only', 'war-era', 'film', 'worthy', 'comparison.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'very', 'much', 'way', 'special', 'features', 'particular', 'oversight', 'absence', 'kind', 'real', 'documentary', 'actual', 'Nuremberg', 'Trials', 'something', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'almost', 'mandatory.JUDGMENT', 'AT', 'NUREMBERG', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'catalogue', 'worst', 'human', 'failings', 'indictment', 'blind', 'jingoism', 'also', 'paean', 'value', 'single', 'human', 'life']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS

392225,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,630396155X,Linda Linguvic,"[84, 86]","There's a serious and timeless theme to this award winning 1961 courtroom drama of four former Nazi judges on trial for war crimes in occupied Germany in 1948.  It's not the story of the military leaders who had already been tried and convicted.  Rather, these were the men who survived the war by following the laws that ruled the nation.  There are deep moral questions here, such as what a judge's responsibility is.  After all, judges do not make the laws; they just carry them out.Stanley Kramer, the director, had great material to work with.  The screenplay by Abby Mann was powerful.  And the cast included some of the finest actors of the time.  Spencer Tracy plays the judge, a widower from Maine with simple tastes.  He's a bit embarrassed to be given a large house, formerly occupied by a high ranking Nazi officer whose surviving wife is played by Marlene Dietrich.  The judge has a difficult job and he ponders it as he walks through the ruins of the city with wide-eyed wonder.  How could all of the horror have happened?  And who is responsible?Responsibility, however, which is the theme of the film, is not so clear cut.  And as the trial progresses, all the shades of gray involved in this concept are brought to light.  Burt Lancaster is cast as one of the judges on trial, a dignified and respected man of the law.  Richard Widmark is cast as the prosecuting attorney, a colonel who had personally been present  at the liberation of the concentration camps.  And Maximilian Schell, in an Academy Award winning performance, plays the part of the defending attorney whose outstanding legal expertise keeps shedding new light on the evidence. Judy Garland is one of the witnesses, and so is Montgomery Cliff.  The entire cast is excellent. I found myself holding my breath as the twists and turns of the legal implications were examined with fine-honed brilliance.The film takes up two videotapes and runs for three hours and six minutes and there is not one slow moment.  I watched it with a sense of total involvement.  I couldn't help but transpose all the legal and moral arguments to what is happening in our world today.  And my own mind went though its own little debate as to the subtleties of right and wrong and the hard choices that must be made. This is drama at its finest.  And a truly magnificent film.

It was nominated for eleven Oscars and won two richly deserved for Leading Actor and Original Screenplay. The plot centers around an American judge named Dan Haywood appointed to preside over a trial in Nuremburg Germany for four Nazi judges and doctors accused of war crimes.I love this film. I love it because it does such a great job fleshing out the philosophies and motives of the characters. Abby Mann (Screenwriter) could have easily have turned the Americans and Germans into one-dimensional cartoony caricature good guys/bad guys but instead he chose to make even the Germans 'real' by giving several reasons why they did what they did. Some of the Germans joined the Nazi party because:1.) They totally agreed with Hilter's theory of exterminating the misfits of society (Jews, Gypsies, etc.) to create a utopia and were gleeful about supporting him.2.)  They just went through the motions afraid for their lives.3.)  Certain members decided if they campaigned for a political position they would be softer and more merciful to their constituents than the hard core extremists.4.) It was fashionable. The new popular political trend.None of these reasons put the Nazis in a favorable light--what light SHOULD they be shown in?--but it does add dimensions to the study of their characters.I wish Judgment at Nuremburg had won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1961 instead of West Side Story because it has an overall stronger cast, more complex characters and long philosophical speeches that give you plenty to ponder over. WSS has its moments (mostly in the songs and dances) but it's empty at the core and doesn't have the same intellectual impact that JAN does.Spencer Tracy gives a solid adequate performance in the leading role but it is Maximilian Schell as Hans Rolfe, the defense attorney who is really making the magic of the film. Even though he is deluded into making justification arguments for his defendants he asks some very thought-provoking questions. At one point, Ernst Janning, one of the defendants gives a self-incriminating speech out of sheer remorse and the desire to be punished for his deeds. Hans Rolfe is desperate. He knows he's probably not going to win this trial but he still manages to muster up one last argument:""What about the rest of the world? Did it not know the intentions of the Third Reich? Did it not hear the words of Hitler's broadcasts all over the world?Did it not read his intentions in Mein Kampf published in every corner of the world? Where is the responsibility of the Soviet Union who signed in the pact with Hitler, enabled him to make war? Are we now to find Russia guilty? Where is the responsibility of the Vatican who signed in the concordat with Hitler giving him his first tremendous prestige? Are we now to find the Vatican guilty? Where is the responsibility of the world leader Winston Churchill who said in an open letter to the London Times in 1938: ""Were England to suffer a national disaster, I should pray to God to send a man of the strength of mind and will of an Adolf Hitler."" Are we now to find Winston Churchill guilty? Where is the responsibility of those American industrialists who helped Hitler to rebuild his armaments and profited by that rebuilding? Are we now to find the American industrialists guilty? No, Your Honor. Germany alone is not guilty. The whole world is as responsible for Hitler as Germany. It is an easy thing to condemn one man in the dock. It's easy to condemn the German people to speak of the basic flaw in the German character that allowed Hitler to rise to power, but also comfortably ignore the basic flaw of character that made the Russians sign pacts with him, Winston Churchill praise him, American industrialists profit by him! Ernst Janning said he is guilty. If he is, Ernst Janning's guilt is the world's guilt. No more, no less.""Strangely enough, after watching the grisly live footage taken by the allies (a scene I always fast forward because once was enough)--Rolfe says he feels saddened that such things could have happened in his country and there can never be a justification for them--right AFTER he tried to make justification arguments for the defendants in court. You get the feeling Rolfe is seeking truth, that in spite of his harsh exterior (bullying the witnesses on the stand and hollering at the top of his lungs every quarter of an hour) he is insecure and not quite sure if he's doing the right thing defending those judges. Maximilian Schell's performance is one of greatest ever to grace the screen--he manages to make you dislike him and feel sorry for him at the same time and glides smoothly back and forth from subtle to melodramatic. You could take all the clips with him, put them together in a collage and it would be the most watchable film ever made. My only quibble is that he should have won best supporting actor instead of best leading actor because Spencer Tracy as Judge Dan Haywood is clearly the main character. Yes, I know you can sometimes have more than one lead but I sincerely feel like the movie centered more around Tracy than Schell.Richard Widmark is also excellent as the prosecuting attorney Col. Tad Lawson. I love the cross look he gives Hans Rolfe at the beginning of the trial as if he's 'sizing him up' wondering if he'll be able to beat this young newcomer in the law. Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift play the two witnesses who suffered indignities under the Third Reich. If I wouldn't have given them the Oscar nominations they received it is not because they are bad--for they are very good--but simply because I don't feel like they  had really long, substantial parts to merit an award. But even these weren't bad choices for nominations.I wish Marlene Dietrich had gotten the Supporting Actress nomination instead of Garland because she got to play a more complex role. She plays the widow of a Nazi general. She claims she knew nothing about the death camps, witch hunts, etc.) and that ""We have to forget if we want to go on living."" During this scene she speaks in a rather huffy, nervous tone. We get a close up of her face--she's sweating bullets and trembling--it's pretty obvious she's lied and feels guilty. Dietrich's style of acting is so smooth, subtle, polished and refined and her rich creamy voice is always a pleasure to the ears. My favorite of her scenes is when she's talking to Judge Haywood about her favorite German folksong and how one of her friends Ernst Janning stood up to Hitler when he made a pass at his wife in an opera house. She managed to make me like her at one point (for how good-natured, friendly and outgoing she is) dislike her (for claiming she didn't know about the camps when for Heaven's sake she's the widow of a general) and feel sorry for her. (Since she loves her country and has a hard time accepting and admitting the evil in it.)Burt Lancaster plays Ernst Janning, the repentant Nazi who goes mostly through the film with depressed, remorseful expressions and scarcely a line until his big speech in the second half of the film. He puts on a German accent very well and conveys all the emotions necessary for the role. The only weak member of the cast I can think of is Spencer Tracy--he seems more like a personality or movie star than an actor--but even he is good, just not as good as the supporting actors around him. William Shatner plays Captain (Yes ANOTHER captain) Byers--a peripheral character. Of course, he had the only love interest in the film.Stanley Kramer's direction is flawless. He manages to bring out the best in every actor and his staging of the sequences is superb. The black and white cinematography contains terrific shots of the city and the sets are sumptuous.I highly recommend this film. Sure, it may not be the most uplifting, entertaining experience but if you judge it by its intellectual value (especially the courtroom speeches) it is one of the finest ever made.",5,No movie has

392227,AFKGYJQIFG2QG,630396155X,"Marta P. Grunland ""mountaingirl""","[0, 1]","This movie deserves far more than 5 stars.Nazi war criminals are taken to task for their horrendous crimes. They fall into different groups - the obedient soldier, the decent guy who regrets his actions, the feeble-minded follower, and the heartless sadist. The kid gloves are off as they confront the court with horrible movie footage of concentration camps, demand embarrassing personal information from victims of ""eugenics"", and refresh the memories of self-righteous Americans of their OWN involvement in supporting Hitler before the war, and maybe after. The ""nice"" Nazi (Burt Lancaster) mourns his crimes, admits his wrongdoing, protests the witch-hunt antics of the court, and presents a sympathic character. Should he be given leniency? He caused the deaths of thousands of innocent people, but you can't help feeling a twinge of pity for him. One of the most startling performances was given by Judy Garland as a German woman torn apart inside by rumors about her, her friendship with a Jew, and her inability to tell the truth without having it twisted and thrown back at her - she went far and above mere acting. Maximilian Schell gives an earth-shaking, demonic performance as an honest but cruel German defense attorney.The German people are healing from a hellish experience. Their reactions vary - some are secretive and deny any involvement in politics. Another, the classy beauty Marlene Dietrich, begs the judge (Spencer Tracy) to let it be. Leave our country alone, she seems to implore, we have enough to deal with. We're not really such bad people. He is drawn to her, but can't leave it alone, of course he can't.Who are the bad guys?

392228,A9ETYHQDJLAHZ,630396155X,Martin L,"[5, 5]","This movie was acclaimed when it was released in 1961 but it's theme is as relevent now as then.  In the movie, several German judges were put on trial for preverting the law for the advancement of the goals of the Nazi regime. What made these men both more tragic and more evil than many of the other Nazis is the fact that they should have known better. They were highly intelligent men who used their legal training and position to establish a veneer of legality for monstrous acts.And in light of the last eight years, this theme reverberates today. As investigations unfold into the Gitmo and Abu Ghraib torture scandals and the lawyers in the Bush administration who used their legal training to justify water boarding and the abrogation of the ""quaint"" notions of the Geneva Convention---men such as Alberto Gonzales, Jay Bybee, John Yoo, David Addington, et al may well face a similar reckoning.

392230,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,630396155X,Mcgivern Owen L,"[7, 12]","Think of the cast: Spencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland and Maximilian Schell. As the movie opens, all the Nazi bigwigs have already faced their own war trials.  The Allied powers are down to a lower tier of German officials to prosecute.  Were these secondary guys hardcore criminals or were they merely enforcing unjust laws for wartime expediency? To its' credit, JD tries to be scrupulously fair to both sides.  Though it remains a trial drama, this reviewer felt that many of the best scenes take place out of court! The high points of JN are 1) the aforementioned balance of the screenplay with an absence of a Nazi witch hunting and 2) the fantastic cast.  Tracy portrays the reluctant trial judge and Lancaster an accused German wartime jurist.  Schell is over the top as the lead defense attorney and Dietrich is excellent as the wife of an executed German Army officer.  The out of court scenes twixt her and Tracy were this reviewer's favorites. They tease with a hint of a September romance.  Maybe the two needed more time in that beer hall.  MD tries hard to convince Tracy that not all Germans were either ardent Nazis or even knew of the Holocaust.  How hard it must have been for Marlene, since in real life, she hated the Nazis.  (So too did Conrad Veidt, who played Major Strasser in ""Casablanca""). MD spent long stretches on the front lines entertaining American troops and CV was a Brit when ""Casablanca"" was released. These tidbits came from frequent TCM network visits.  Garland and Clift impress as victims of Germans who ran afoul of the Nazi regime.  Their roles are poignant, since both were suffering in their private lives at the time.  Others will disagree but this reviewer was less than impressed with Widmark; he tears up the screen as the Allied prosecutor, often with more heat than light.  His adversary, Schell impresses as the defense counsel -with far more light than heat.  JN did very well at Oscar time: The movie itself, Director Stanley Kramer, Tracy, Clift, and Garland (though not Marlene!) all received nominations.  Schell took home a statue for Best Supporting Actor, as did Abby Mann for Best Adapted Screenplay.  The only weak points to JN are minor: Some of those special effects shot in cars against a faux German background fall flat.  Also, this reviewer would liked to have learned more about other war trials.  Schell drops a comment about acquittals at an ""I.G. Farben trial"".  What happened? Finally, this reviewer's DVD had no trailers at all!  It appears that not all copies contain them. The bottom line is that ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is a winning movie with a timeliness and cast that Hollywood would be hard to replicate today.  A helpful hint to my amazon friends: This viewer watched JN in 3 sittings.  What was gained in convenience was totally lost in a lack of continuity.  Newcomers are urged to studiously allocate 190 minutes for an uninterrupted screning of JN.

It was adapted and expanded for the big screen.Spencer Tracey heads the star studded cast as American justice Dan Haywood.  The Nuremberg trials have been going on for a while and all the high profile cases have been decided.  Left are the minor defendants.What writer Abby Mann has decided to explore is where does the blame and responsibility stop.  He explores it from two points of view, minor officials and the general citizens.Dan Haywood knows that he wasn't the first choice, nor even the tenth.  But he is going to take his job as serious as if he was the first choice.The defendants are judges Emil Hahn (Werner ""Hogan's Heroes"" Klemperer), Friederich Hoffsteder, Werner Lamper and Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster).The prosecutor (Richard Widmark) is US Army and the defense attorney (Maximilian  Schell) is a young German attorney/The key witnesses are Rudolph Peterson (Montgomery Clift), a slightly slow baker's helper who was sterilized and Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland), who as a girl was sterilized for consorting with a Jew - the man was executed.Justice Haywood tried to understand the public atmosphere through his servants and the woman who used to live at the house he is living at, Mrs. Bertol (Marlene Dietrich).This film brings up many questions of when do you follow the law and when do you go refuse to enforce or follow unjust laws.  The original teleplay was written just after the McCarthy hearings.  This was a direct attack on what happened during the hearings.  But it has grown to something bigger.  The basic premise is when can you follow blatantly unjust laws and say you were just following orders.In a time when people are asked to follow leaders blindly without question, this film makes you think twice.Add to this stunning performances all around.  Spencer Tracey is the greatest film actor of all time, this was one of his final films and showed that he was as still one of the best.  Maximilian Schell was a virtual unknown and this made him a star in America.  Burt Lancaster was at the top of his stardom and took a small but pivotal role.  It was a great triumph for him and the film.  But the best and biggest surprise was Judy Garland who gave a shattering performance and should have won the Academy Award.No one who watches this film will be unmoved.DVD EXTRAS:In Conversation: Abby Mann and Maximilian Schell - A 19 minute interview with the writer and the actor about the original 1959 Playhouse 90 television production, the subsequent 1961 film and the 2003 Broadway production.The Value of a Single Human Being - This is a 6 minute tirade by Abby Mann comparing McCarthyism to the Nazis.  I am not saying that he does not make a lot of salient points but it loses a little bit in the presentation.A Tribute to Stanley Kramer - A 14 minute tribute to Kramer by his wife Karen and writer Abby Mann.

392235,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,630396155X,Nix Pix,"[16, 16]","""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is Stanley Kramer's often stagy, often stoic, though never anything less than completely engrossing, post-WWII melodrama. It's high octane film making driven by star performances and masterfully scripted dialogue; a vital, tragic, yet overall life affirming message picture about the difference between abiding the law and doing what is just in an unjust world. The film stars Spencer Tracy as the honorable American Judge Dan Haywood, assigned to supervise the trial of four German justices, including Dr. Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) who have been accused of sending innocent men to their brutal deaths in Nazi concentration camps. Put up in the home of a former high ranking Nazi official, Haywood gains personal insight into the aftermath of Germany's political climate through his engagement of the servants (Ben Wright and Virginia Christine) and through a chance meeting with their former mistress, Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich).  But the real spark of this film is to be found in the mutual bitterness between passionate Defense Attorney Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) and the pronouncedly defiant Colonel Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark), who serves as lead prosecutor. In a cameo appearance Judy Garland is remarkably heartbreaking as Irene Hoffman, a middle-aged frump whose fatherly relationship with a Jewish gentleman resulting in his death. Nominated for an astounding 11 Academy Awards, and winner of 2, ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" remains a benchmark of 60s cinema - a powerful and emotionally satisfying film for the ages.Although MGM's DVD is NOT anamorphically enhanced, it delivers a very smooth image that will surely not disappoint. The B&W; picture is remarkably clean, with minimal film grain, accurately rendered contrast levels, deep solid blacks and very clean whites. The audio has been remixed to 5.1 (the original mono is also included). The two are practically identical in their spatial separation and fidelity, though in the 5.1 mix the music track is decidedly the benefactor.  Extras include a 20 minute thoroughly insightful featurette in which screenwriter Abby Mann and co-star Maximilian Schell speak of their experiences on the film. Both are so well spoken and frank that they put many a new audio commentary track to shame with their genuine ability to talk on cue. Also included is a 15 minute tribute to Stanley Kramer that is very nicely done, if all too brief. A photo gallery, theatrical trailer and promotional junket materials round out the extras.",4,NOT ANAMORPHIC BUT BETTER THAN AVERAGE,1092873600,"08 19, 2004",2004,2521,"['Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'often', 'stagy', 'often', 'stoic', 'though', 'never', 'anything', 'less', 'completely', 'engrossing', 'post-WWII', 'melodrama', 'high', 'octane', 'film', 'making', 'driven', 'star', 'performances', 'masterfully', 'scripted', 'dialogue', 'vital', 'tragic', 'yet', 'overall', 'life', 'affirming', 'message', 'picture', 'difference', 'abiding', 'law', 'doing', 'what', 'just', 'unjust', 'world', 'film', 'stars', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'honorable', 'American', 'Judge', 'Dan', 'Haywood', 'assigned', 'supervise', 'trial', 'four', 'German', 'justices', 'including', 'Dr.', 'Ernst', 'Janning', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'accused', 'sending', 'innocent', 'men', 'brutal', 'deaths', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Put', 'up', 'home', 'former', 'high', 'ranking', 'Nazi', 'official', 'Haywood', 'gains', 'personal', 'insight', 'aftermath', 'Germany', 'political', 'climate', 'engagement', 'servants', 'Ben', 'Wright', 'Virginia', 'Christine', 'chance', 'meeting', 'former', 'mistress', 'Madame', 'Bertholt', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'real', 'spark', 'film', 'be', 'found', 'mutual', 'bitterness', 'passionate', 'Defense', 'Attorney', 'Hans', 'Rolfe', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'pronouncedly', 'defiant', 'Colonel', 'Tad', 'Lawson', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'who', 'lead', 'prosecutor', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'remarkably', 'heartbreaking', 'Irene', 'Hoffman', 'middle-aged', 'frump', 'fatherly', 'relationship', 'Jewish', 'gentleman', 'resulting', 'death', 'Nominated', 'astounding', '11', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'winner', '2', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'benchmark', '60s', 'cinema', 'powerful', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'film', 'ages.Although', 'MGM', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'anamorphically', 'enhanced', 'very', 'smooth', 'image', 'will', 'surely', 'not', 'disappoint', 'B', 'W', 'picture', 'remarkably', 'clean', 'minimal', 'film', 'grain', 'accurately', 'rendered', 'contrast', 'levels', 'deep', 'solid', 'blacks', 'very', 'clean', 'whites', 'audio', 'been', 'remixed', '5.1', 'original', 'mono', 'also', 'included', 'two', 'are', 'practically', 'identical', 'spatial', 'separation', 'fidelity', '5.1', 'mix', 'music', 'track', 'decidedly', 'benefactor', 'Extras', 'include', '20', 'minute', 'thoroughly', 'insightful', 'featurette', 'screenwriter', 'Abby', 'Mann', 'co-star', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'speak', 'experiences', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'spoken', 'frank', 'put', 'many', 'new', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'shame', 'genuine', 'ability', 'talk', 'cue', 'Also', 'included', '15', 'minute', 'tribute', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'too', 'brief', 'photo', 'gallery', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'promotional', 'junket', 'materials', 'round', 'out', 'extras']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS

Spencer Tracy heads a cast that includes heavies like Richard Widmark, Maxmillian Schell, Marlena Deitrich and others.  But, it also co0ntains small but gripping appearances by two of Hollywood's biggest stars, and for very different types of rolwes.  Things we have never seen them in I was stunned and pleased by their performances.  No one visits the Land of Oz, nor the sunnt California central vaslley to court the ravishing Elizabeth Taylor.  Judy Garland, at age ---plays a woman who fell in love with a Jewish man, thereby condemming hiom to the death penalty, via the infamouis Nuremburg Laws of 1933.  Montgomery Cliff, a personal fdriedn of Elizabeth Taylor, in real life, that is, plays a retarded adsult who was forceably sterilized by the Nazis.  His scene is heart-wrenching ands searingly realistic, undoubtedly his finest work.udy Garland breaks one's heart with her performance as a deperate young woman trapped by racial rancor and sytematized murder. Spencer Tracy plays an elderly American judge, in the twilight of his years as a senior jurist, trying to sort out the guilt or innoccenseof the four Gefrman judges on trial, headed by trhe great Burt Lancaster and including the comic actor Werner Klemperer, star of Hogan's Heros, and, in real lifve the son of tghe great German Symphony con ductor, Otto Klemperer.  Max Schell rise to frequent eloquence and passion and is gallaNTLY PATRIOTIC AS THE GERMAN DEFENSE ATTOURNEY.  The mechanical workings of the court process appears to be remarkably accurate and educational.  This film from  1965, is almost like a full-length Hollywood version of the TV series, Law and Order, it is that good.  As is the case often with the moivie makers, an attepmt to do a remake was done, in 1988, with Briuan Coxas Ghoering and Alec Baldwin as __________--.  It was n ot bad, but fails miserably compared to this classic.The list of creditsa ins tyoo long to go into here, but only to say thatseen in it's entirety, it is a riveting, attention grabbing taught and irressistable in it's interest.  I see it about once every 8-12 months, any more than that, and it miught become stale.  But, seeing it only occasionally keeps it so special.  It is a tremendous and dramatic masterpiece, and I cannot recommend it more than I do.  I wish I could award it 10 stars.  It deserves every star in the sky.  Marflene Deitrich is splendid, as usual, and totally convincing as the widow of an executed German officer, found guilty in regards to the &#34;Malmady Massacre,&#34; of 1944.  Judy  Garland's testimony and Lancaster's reaction towards Max Schell is a highlight of the movie.

I usually have a tough time staying alert for a two hour flick.  ""Judgement At Nuremberg"" is one of those rare motion pictures that grabs your attention at the outset and simply never lets go.  The issues addressed in this film are monumental and the all-star cast make this one of the most compelling films that I have ever seen.  ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" features one of my all-time favorite actors Spencer Tracy cast as Chief Judge Dan Haywood who was chosen to oversee the post World War II tribunal convened to determine the culpability of four Nazi judges who were responsible for sending millions of Jews to concentration camps and ultimately to their deaths.  While the story in ""Judgement at Nuremberg' is fictionalized it is clearly based on actual events that took place during the Nazi reign of terror.  Richard Widmark is splendid as Chief Prosecutor Col. Tad Lawson while Maximilian Schell walked away with an Oscar for Best Actor for his passionate portrayal of  lead defense attorney Hans Rolfe.  Other memorable performances include Burt Lancaster as defendant Dr. Ernst Janning, Marlene Dietrich as Mrs. Bertholt and of all people Judy Garland who was quite convincing in her brief but important role as Mrs. Irene Hoffman Wallner.The Nuremberg Trials were conducted just a few years after the conclusion of World War II in 1948.  These proceedings, which lasted for about eight months, made headlines worldwide. What I found particularly compelling about ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" was observing Chief Judge Haywood continuously struggling with the enormity of the crimes that had been committed.  Although these events were familiar to just about everyone in that courtroom having to actually see, hear and digest the evidence proved quite unsettling to say the least.  Perhaps the most moving part of the film is several minutes of actual footage from the concentration camps that document the prosecutions case in an incredibly graphic way.  This is footage that you will likely never forget.In my humble opinion, ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" should be required viewing for every high school student in America. They say that those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it. It is important that our young men and women are aware of what happened here.  At the same time students will get a chance to see one of the greatest films ever made.  Great performances and top notch writing make ""Judgement At Nuremberg"" one of those ""must see""  motion pictures.  It is easy to see why in June 2008 the American Film Institute honored ""Judgement At Nuremberg"" as one of the 10 best courtroom dramas ever made.

392240,A1K7QTV08XLQRT,630396155X,"Raphael Collin ""Rafe""","[5, 6]","I have just watched this film on Turner Classics and I was unprepared for its combination of breadth and depth.  It is a courtroom drama, but not limited to just the courtroom - the action takes place all across divided Germany.  It is 1948, the Berlin Blockade and the American airlift.  The film depicts the ever-present fear of the American military that at any moment the Soviet downing of an American aid plane might precipitate World War III, while the war crimes trials antagonize a German nation that now must be won over to ""our side"" against the Russians.The chief American judge (Spencer Tracy) at a trial of Nazi jurists does not have the support of the American brass around him. After all, the lead Nazis have been tried, is it wise to continue?  As an American officer tells the chief prosecutor, played by Richard Widmark, ""if Germany is lost, Europe is lost.""Against this broad canvas, over the course of three hours, Abby Mann and Stanley Kramer probe the dark souls of more than a dozen men and women and how they responded to great evil.  An astonishing cast - Tracy, Widmark, Burt Lancaster, Marlene Dietrich, Maximilian Schell, Montgomery Clift, Werner Klemperer and finally a heart-breaking Judy Garland - bring all these people to powerful or pitiable life.Ruth Z. Deming in her review below writes that back then ""we (Americans) were justly perceived as heroes, unlike today"" when evil George Bush and Guantanamo ...  But the film is not at all silly and simplistic like that: this is a Cold War world, complex and difficult, in which any choice the Americans make can have dire consequences. Spencer Tracy's judge is told that Americans are now no longer popular in Nuremberg.  Lead defense attorney Rolfe (Maximiliam Schell) acidly comments that American's moral pretensions, after the firebombings and atomic bombings, are baseless. And Werner Klemperer's Nazi judge is confident that soon ""the Bolsheviks will sentence you!""This is a world, as Rolfe points out in court, in which Churchill had praised Hitler, Americans had sold him armaments, and Russia had signed a treaty to allow Germany to invade Poland.  And Mann and Kramer show that, only three years after the Holocaust had ended, America and Russia were on the brink of horrific bloodshed all over again...(spoiler)Even at the climax, when the least guilty and most distinguished of the German jurists, Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster)finally accepts his guilt and complicity in judicial murder, there is no easy or sentimental ending.  Sentenced to life in prison, Janning desperately wants the respect and understanding of the American judge he has come to admire.  Chief Judge Haywood (Tracy) thinks highly of Janning's work and mind, but when the German implores, ""you must understand ... millions of people ... I never thought it could come to that,"" Haywood cuts him right off: ""The first time you sentence a man you know is innocent to death - it HAS come to that.""Yet Judge Haywood does not have the final victory.  The American brass do not really support him: there is no reason to antagonize the Germans. The lead defense attorney confidently bets Haywood that his sentencing of even the vilest of these villains will not stand - and a note at the end tells us he was right.Intellectually exciting and morally troubling, this is a very fine film.",5,"Overwhelming, alternately troubling and ennobling",1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,3344,"['have', 'just', 'watched', 'film', 'Turner', 'Classics', 'was', 'unprepared', 'combination', 'breadth', 'depth', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'not', 'limited', 'just', 'courtroom', 'action', 'place', 'divided', 'Germany', '1948', 'Berlin', 'Blockade', 'American', 'airlift', 'film', 'ever-present', 'fear', 'American', 'military', 'moment', 'Soviet', 'downing', 'American', 'aid', 'plane', 'might', 'precipitate', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'war', 'crimes', 'trials', 'antagonize', 'German', 'nation', 'now', 'must', 'be', 'won', 'side', 'Russians.The', 'chief', 'American', 'judge', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'trial', 'Nazi', 'jurists', 'not', 'have', 'support', 'American', 'brass', 'lead', 'Nazis', 'have', 'been', 'tried', 'wise', 'continue', 'American', 'officer', 'chief', 'prosecutor', 'played', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'Germany', 'lost', 'Europe', 'lost', 'broad', 'canvas', 'course', 'three', 'hours', 'Abby', 'Mann', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'probe', 'dark', 'souls', 'more', 'dozen', 'men', 'women', 'how', 'responded', 'great', 'evil', 'astonishing', 'cast', 'Tracy', 'Widmark', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Werner', 'Klemperer', 'finally', 'heart-breaking', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'bring', 'people', 'powerful', 'pitiable', 'life.Ruth', 'Z.', 'Deming', 'review', 'writes', 'back', 'then', 'Americans', 'were', 'justly', 'perceived', 'heroes', 'today', 'when', 'evil', 'George', 'Bush', 'Guantanamo', 'film', 'not', 'silly', 'simplistic', 'Cold', 'War', 'world', 'complex', 'difficult', 'choice', 'Americans', 'make', 'can', 'have', 'dire', 'consequences', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'judge', 'told', 'Americans', 'are', 'now', 'no', 'longer', 'popular', 'Nuremberg', 'Lead', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Rolfe', 'Maximiliam', 'Schell', 'acidly', 'comments', 'American', 'moral', 'pretensions', 'firebombings', 'atomic', 'bombings', 'are', 'baseless', 'Werner', 'Klemperer', 'Nazi', 'judge', 'confident', 'soon', 'Bolsheviks', 'will', 'sentence', 'world', 'Rolfe', 'out', 'court', 'Churchill', 'had', 'praised', 'Hitler', 'Americans', 'had', 'sold', 'armaments', 'Russia', 'had', 'signed', 'treaty', 'allow', 'Germany', 'invade', 'Poland', 'Mann', 'Kramer', 'show', 'only', 'three', 'years', 'Holocaust', 'had', 'ended', 'America', 'Russia', 'were', 'brink', 'horrific', 'bloodshed', 'over', 'again', 'spoiler', 'Even', 'climax', 'when', 'least', 'guilty', 'most', 'distinguished', 'German', 'jurists', 'Ernst', 'Janning', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'finally', 'guilt', 'complicity', 'judicial', 'murder', 'easy', 'sentimental', 'ending', 'Sentenced', 'life', 'prison', 'Janning', 'desperately', 'respect', 'understanding', 'American', 'judge', 'come', 'admire', 'Chief', 'Judge', 'Haywood', 'Tracy', 'highly', 'Janning', 'work', 'mind', 'when', 'German', 'implores', 'must', 'understand', 'millions', 'people', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'come', 'Haywood', 'cuts', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'sentence', 'man', 'know', 'innocent', 'death', 'come', 'Judge', 'Haywood', 'not', 'have', 'final', 'victory', 'American', 'brass', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'support', 'reason', 'antagonize', 'Germans', 'lead', 'defense', 'attorney', 'confidently', 'Haywood', 'sentencing', 'even', 'vilest', 'villains', 'will', 'not', 'stand', 'note', 'end', 'was', 'right.Intellectually', 'exciting', 'morally', 'troubling', 'very', 'fine', 'film']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS

Spencer Tracy does a great spot, as central among ""your honors"" in the Nuremburg Hall of Justice.  It's all woven in with various antics among the German people of 1948, and was apparently produced to show the Berlin Airlift as amplification of the Berlin Wall crisis that was going on in 1961.  Tracy is put in the spot of attempting to find the true source of law, when law is perverted in the interest of political rampage.  Though the defendants will accuse the entire world of sitting by during the time of the mass execution and murder, it comes down to the responsibility of those who are actually at the fore and sentencing people to male sterilization and death in the interest of racial purity.  All the mushy plot involving Marlene Dietrich (though quite a Nazi-era notable to put in a film about Germany) and the human interest parts were a detraction, so I'm going to downgrade my overall rating to a 4.7.

It can't be that Germans and only Germans are capable of excusing such atrocities for the ""good of country"" or for personal gain.

Psychologist know that human  infants experience a period of extreme selfishness, where everything in their world revolves around their sense of ""me"".  We are supposed to outgrow that nature as we grow older, but it never disappears completely and some people never seem to advance past this stage of development to any appreciable degree.  Much of the misery of this world can probably be attributed to our inability to understand the consequences of this tendency and then actively and consciously avert this tragic flaw.  Even in this country, as empathetic and generous as many people are, we endured in our own culture in the South in fairly recent times, the institutionalization of a social system denying basic human rights to millions of our own people based on irrational racial attitudes.  Even with our Bill Of Rights . . . our Constitution.I was especially pleased that actual footage was shown depicting the unbelievable atrocities that the Jewish people endured.  It gave the court room drama a real sense of urgency for justice that would have been lacking in the film without it.

Also, ""The Hustler"" with Paul Newman was riveting human drama; ""The Guns of Navarone"" was a taut WW II thriller that never failed to entertain. Another nominee was ""Fanny"", a light sweet film which was only a tribute to the great Charles Boyer. The last Best Picture nominee, ""Judgment at Nuremberg"", was in a class of it's own, a screenplay by Abby Mann and directed by the most maverick Stanley Kramer. Kramer used Spencer Tracy often, and for good reason. Tracy centers this film.  Kramer has never shied away from any subject that might make people uncomfortable, whether ""Inherit the Wind"" or ""The Defiant Ones"", or, later, ""Ship of Fools"". He attracts the best actors and has directed many to acting nominations; he also knew how to use a large cast to good advantage (much like our present-day maverick, Robert Altman). Maximillian Schell was auspicious as the defense attorney and won the Oscar (over Tracy, also nominated). Abby Mann's screenplay also won. Schell is, indeed, brilliant; also nominated was Montgomery Clift as the feeble-minded guy (not a stretch, since word has it he was drunk the whole time); the real treat is a sublime and courageous performance by Judy Garland, which will break your heart. I'm also glad that Kramer asked Marlene Dietrich to appear. Aside from her natural beauty, no one seems to remember her wonderful performances in ""Morocco"", ""Golden Earrings"" or Hitchcock's ""Stage Fright"". Here, she's confident and sure, as always.

Deming ""Backyard Trees""","[10, 16]","In this fictionalized version of the 13 trials of Nazi war criminals, condensed into one trial, this 1961 Stanley Kramer film deepens his reputation as one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers, a man who made movies of substance. The sterling cast includes Spencer Tracy, as the American judge flown in from Maine to try 4 Nazi judges; William Shatner, who himself is Jewish; Judy Garland, who played a broken woman due to the horrors she suffered under the Third Reich; and the young German-born Maximillian Schell as a brilliant but brutal orator, defending his Nazi clients. Burt Lancaster gives one of his best performances as a former Nazi judge who actually undergoes a personality change during the film, after being shown horrific documentary footage of a concentration camp. In one of the most eloquent scenes in all of movie history, Lancaster acknowledges his guilt and his deep sense of remorse and shame.Haunting cinematography includes the ruins of the once-beautiful German cities and museums, the luxurious interiors - with fragile teapots and tiny cups and saucers - juxtaposed with the horrors of fragile human beings, including babies and children, slaughtered beyond the walls of beauty, while the world watched.This is a must-see movie. At the end of World War II, we were justly perceived as heroes, unlike today, when the United States is conducting war trials of its own, which, unlike World War II, are against the rules of the 1925 Geneva Convention.Sadly, Stanley Kramer died in 2001 (at age 88) and can't make another politically powerful film about what's happening in our wiretapped nation and the still-raging antisemitism around the world.",5,Experience The Entire Holocaust in 3 Hours,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,1669,"['fictionalized', 'version', '13', 'trials', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminals', 'condensed', 'one', 'trial', '1961', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'film', 'reputation', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'movies', 'substance', 'sterling', 'cast', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'American', 'judge', 'flown', 'Maine', 'try', '4', 'Nazi', 'judges', 'William', 'Shatner', 'who', 'Jewish', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'who', 'played', 'broken', 'woman', 'due', 'horrors', 'suffered', 'Third', 'Reich', 'young', 'German-born', 'Maximillian', 'Schell', 'brilliant', 'brutal', 'orator', 'defending', 'Nazi', 'clients', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'former', 'Nazi', 'judge', 'who', 'actually', 'personality', 'change', 'film', 'being', 'shown', 'horrific', 'documentary', 'footage', 'concentration', 'camp', 'one', 'most', 'eloquent', 'scenes', 'movie', 'history', 'Lancaster', 'guilt', 'deep', 'sense', 'remorse', 'shame.Haunting', 'cinematography', 'ruins', 'once-beautiful', 'German', 'cities', 'museums', 'luxurious', 'interiors', 'fragile', 'teapots', 'tiny', 'cups', 'saucers', 'juxtaposed', 'horrors', 'fragile', 'human', 'beings', 'including', 'babies', 'children', 'slaughtered', 'walls', 'beauty', 'world', 'watched.This', 'must-see', 'movie', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'were', 'justly', 'perceived', 'heroes', 'today', 'when', 'United', 'States', 'conducting', 'war', 'trials', 'own', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'are', 'rules', '1925', 'Geneva', 'Convention.Sadly', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'died', '2001', 'age', '88', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'politically', 'powerful', 'film', 'what', 'happening', 'wiretapped', 'nation', 'still-raging', 'antisemitism', 'world']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS

They remained silent when their neighbors disappeared at night, when innocent people were denied their rights etc. under the Nazi's administrations.  The Nuremberg trials were held over a period of four years; there were thirteen different trials in all.  This movie is based on the third military tribunal which tried judges and other legislative officials who sentenced people to death, deportation, or prison because of violation of laws enacted by the Nazis.  The script was written by Abby Mann who won an Oscar for Best Writing; Maximilian Schell won an Oscar for Best Actor in a leading role.  The Austrian born actor had worked with Clift before in Young Lions which also featured Marlon Brando.  Most of the characters in the movie are fictional, though some, Judy Garland's role and Burt Lancaster's, were based on actual persons, yet the names were changed.  I highly recommend that this movie be seen and that web sites on the subject be looked at, in that there is so much material to those trials that this 3 hour long movie couldn't contain.  The trials were unique in many ways.  The framework for these trials was suggested as early as  September of 1944 by a Colonel in the U.S. War Department.  Nuremberg was where the Nazis held their war rallies and where the Nuremberg Laws regarding citizenship and race were enacted in 1935 and was the chosen site for the 13 trials; the Justice Case, which this movie is based on, was governed by Military Tribunal III in 1947.The acting is superb in this movie; I, personally, thought Judy Garland's was the most stellar, was moved to tears by her defense of herself accused of having a physical relationship with a non-Aryan, in her case, a jew, in violation of the Nuremberg Laws.  The filming is very effective too; this 1961 movie was filmed in black and white which is fitting given the mood and atmosphere of the setting; Nuremberg was in ruins, 90% of its buildings had been destroyed, and the mood of its citizens in the war's aftermath and looming trial dark indeed.I think this film, more than its 2000 counterpart, best reveals the sentiments of the Germans post war, mainly through Judge Haywood's (Spencer Tracy) interactions with Germans he came in contact with, for example, the servants of the innkeeper who housed him during the trial.  Also, the feelings of the Germans were also effectively expressed by Lancaster's character and Schell's during the trial.  Judge Haywood is fair minded and commends Mr. Rolfe (Maximilian Schell), the defense attorney for the 16 Nazi defendants, for his logical skills, agreeing with some of the things he said.  Yet, he then goes on to say that in consideration of the crimes ""to be logical is not to be right.""  In meeting with Ernst Janning at the trial's end, Judge Haywood accepts the gift of Janning's court papers, yet is not swayed by the logic that Janning had no idea that millions of people had been killed the way they had been.  Judge Haywood replies, ""it came to that the first time you sentenced to death a man you knew to be innocent"".  Hans Rolfe (Schell) stated that the blame for the crimes should be shared by everyone all over the world who supported Hitler financially, materially, or spiritually, for example, the Vatican, American industrialists, and others who shared Hitler's ideology.  Yet, historically, German military officers condoned the Armenian genocide of WWI and as early as 1903, funded by the Deutsche Bank, were working on completing a railway going from Baghdad to Berlin, see Sander's The High Walls of Jerusalem.The footage shown during the trial of concentration camp atrocities was the actual film shown on November 29, 1945 in the first trial which is the subject matter for Nuremberg, the film of 2000.  The list is too long to mention the many ways the Nazis terrorized their own citizens; the other testimony in this trial was of Mr. Petersen (Monty Clift) who is sterilized because the Nazis, in their Spartan approach to citizenship, would sterilize the mentally infirm, disabled, or non-Aryan, in order to obtain a pure race.  (Violence against homosexuals in Nazi Germany began on June 30, 1934 when a military officer, Ernst Rohm, an SA chief of staff, was murdered by Himmler and Goring, an event nicknamed ""the night of the long knives""; Clift had only one male partner all his life, so his role was fitting in that gays under Hitler were undoubtably similarly abused).Of the 16 men tried, 10 were found guilty, 4 were acquitted.  The other 2 were seriously ill, one dying before the verdict.  My favorite statement of Judge Haywood, at the trial's end, was that the decisions were a result of ""what we (the tribunal) stand for: justice, truth, and the value of a single individual"".

The big tribunals were complete with the major Nazi war criminals sentenced or committing suicide.  Time for the little guys, which the movie states the American people are not that into these events.Spencer Tracy makes a solid performance as the lead tribunal judge at the Nuremberg trials.  A young William Shatner in one of his first appearances as a Captain acts as his aide - a minor role.  Tracy's character does not just look at the books and the records, but goes out to the Germany of the people.We see the Germans as Dan sees them:  singing in the beer hall, going to the concerts and meeting the friendly people amidst the bombed-out buildings.  The rubble and the struggle of the people is especially heart wrenching.Richard Widmark is the prosecutor who does overact a bit but otherwise does a competent job, jumping up from his seat often with objections and having been at Dachau and other concentration camps has an especial hatred for Germans.Marlene Dietrich, a wonderful classic actress who herself was German but left Germany before the Nazis came to power, played the perfect aristocrat who takes a liking to Dan.  However, Dan is all professional and continues to poke and to prod, trying to understand the people who claim not to have known about the atrocities.It is a great story of justification - is the fact that you ""didn't know"" a justification for the acts of criminals?  Moreover, did the persons who were at these major cases, making judgments, any less guilty?Judy Garland was nominated for Best Supporting Actress that year for Judgment at Nuremberg and I cannot see why.  She does get overly emotional and does a great job of acting as the victim of the racial discrimination program by the Nazis.  However, the award should have gone to Dietrich, who at the end of the film comes again to hate Americans as she sits with a drink in a darkened room boarded up because of bombed-out glass.In addition, let's not forget Burt Lancaster as Ernst the Judge - the quiet competence, the dignity and yet the shock and dismay at what he had done - just following the laws of his land.Maximillian Schell as the defense attorney really had his work cut out for him.  He too goes overboard and overly emotional especially after the prosecuting attorney shows the films from the dead Jews being bulldozed into mass graves.Trivia:This film was one of the first to show the Jewish deaths, the gas chambers and the mass burials of decimated bodies at concentration camps.  The images are stark!I noted too that three of the actors later went on to become television stars.  Howard Caine plays a small but important role as the father of the daughter who is being dragged into the courtroom to become witness to a celebrated case at the time.  Howard went on to Hogan's Heroes, a situation comedy from the Sixties, ironically about Stalag 13 concentration camp for POW's, along with Werner Kemplerer,  son of the famous composer Otto Kemplerer, as the bumbling Colonel Klink.And one of the first appearances of William Shatner whom you all know (or should know) as captain of the starship Enterprise.Awards:The movie won the Academy Award for Best Actor (Maximilian Schell) and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and many others!

392254,A2SX6VNPSJPGP7,630396155X,Sean Orlosky,"[5, 8]","&quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; earns merit as one of the finest dramas ever made on many levels: it is an honest, no-punches-pulled look at one of the most horrifying and avoided periods of the twentieth century, and it is unfolded by a brilliant director who heads a stellar cast. It is an intense, probing, and ultimately involving picture that casts a deep impression in the memory.At the beginning of the infamous Nuremberg trials in 1948, Judge Dan Heywood (Spencer Tracy) is called to preside over the tribunal that will determine the fates of several German judges cited for unforgivable crimes committed during World War II. The somewhat cynical, sardonic Heywood approaches the case at the beginning of the trials feeling no emotional connection to the events that happened or the men on trial. But through his acquaintances with liberal prosecutor Ted Lawson (Richard Widmark) and particularly the elegant Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), the events that haunt the city of Nuremberg come to haunt him as he suddenly finds himself drawn deeper into the heart of the crimes as he never was before.In the courtroom, he is faced with the beleagured, repenting judge Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) and the passionate, fiery defense attorney Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell, in an Academy-Award winning performance), who relentlessly tortures two individuals on the witness stand: Rudolph Petersen (Montgomery Clift), a Jew who was illegally sterilized in a concentration camp hospital, and Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland), a Jew who was wrongfully persecuted for having affiliations with an elderly Jew. These scenes are particularly disturbing, for the realism in the actors' performances is very unnerving: Clift as Petersen tries desperately to prove to Rolfe that his mother was not mentally ill, and particularly Garland, whose emotions flood out as Rolfe pursues her to a breakdown, she eventually shrieking and shaking the witness stand.

Szmutko,"[0, 0]","Director Stanley Kramer's classic masterpiece, JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG explores one of the world's darkest periods - World War II and the Holocaust - with a deeply moving plot and stellar performances from a magnificent cast.  From screen veterans Spencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich, Richard Widmark, and Burt Lancaster to relative newcomers, including William Shatner, Maximillian Schell and Werner Klemperer, the film explores the theme of individual complicity in actions of the state, while weaving a complex tapestry of raw emotion, legal, ethical and political nuance, and humanitarian considerations.The power of the film - not doubt more numbing at its 1961 release, lies not in the sweeping panorama of world events, but in the singular moments of human connection.  Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland give small, but significant performances in their roles of victims.  Richard Widmark's fiery personality and passionate prosecution is given credence by his singular testimony to the horrors of the concentration camp.  Werner Klemperer offers a portrait of a man possessed with a chilling arrogance and strident rationalization of horrors in the name of bureaucratic efficiency.  Maximillian Schell offers the conflicted personality of an attorney torn by the horrors of events and fidelity to the notion of a fair trial and preservation of post-war national pride.  Burt Lancaster's character is the archetypical ""fallen angel,""  a man who has turned aside from his own principles and now must confront the demons, which have resided in his sould.For those who hide behind a swell of ignorant patriotism and mindless obedience to irrationality, this film is a chilling testimony of the evil that can occur when good men do nothing in the face of tyranny.",5,Thought Provoking Film; Moving Performances,1212710400,"06 6, 2008",2008,1761,"['Director', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'classic', 'masterpiece', 'JUDGEMENT', 'AT', 'NUREMBERG', 'one', 'world', 'darkest', 'periods', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Holocaust', 'deeply', 'moving', 'plot', 'stellar', 'performances', 'magnificent', 'cast', 'screen', 'veterans', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'including', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Maximillian', 'Schell', 'Werner', 'Klemperer', 'film', 'theme', 'individual', 'complicity', 'actions', 'state', 'weaving', 'complex', 'tapestry', 'raw', 'emotion', 'legal', 'ethical', 'political', 'nuance', 'humanitarian', 'considerations.The', 'power', 'film', 'not', 'doubt', 'more', 'numbing', '1961', 'release', 'not', 'sweeping', 'panorama', 'world', 'events', 'singular', 'moments', 'human', 'connection', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'give', 'small', 'significant', 'performances', 'roles', 'victims', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'fiery', 'personality', 'passionate', 'prosecution', 'given', 'credence', 'singular', 'testimony', 'horrors', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Werner', 'Klemperer', 'portrait', 'man', 'possessed', 'chilling', 'arrogance', 'strident', 'rationalization', 'horrors', 'name', 'bureaucratic', 'efficiency', 'Maximillian', 'Schell', 'conflicted', 'personality', 'attorney', 'torn', 'horrors', 'events', 'fidelity', 'notion', 'fair', 'trial', 'preservation', 'post-war', 'national', 'pride', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'character', 'archetypical', 'fallen', 'angel', 'man', 'who', 'turned', 'aside', 'own', 'principles', 'now', 'must', 'confront', 'demons', 'have', 'resided', 'sould.For', 'who', 'hide', 'swell', 'ignorant', 'patriotism', 'mindless', 'obedience', 'irrationality', 'film', 'chilling', 'testimony', 'evil', 'can', 'occur', 'when', 'good', 'men', 'do', 'nothing', 'face', 'tyranny']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS

It offers a fair and in-depth accounting of how both sides (America and her allies and the Germans) allowed a Hitler to bring humankind to the brink of insanity and genocide. One human being can't bring the world to its bloody knees by himself, it takes a conspiracy of silence and passivity to have brought events to such a horrific conclusion. 'Judgment' reveals the cruelity and mindlessness of not just a Hitler or the Nazis, but of all men in all ages. History spares and exonerates no one or country. The theme is that we must all take responsibility, and dare to act when our conscience compels us.Every performance evokes the strongest emotions. Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift are raw and brave in their performances. Marlene Dietrich brings elegance and dignity. Spencer Tracy is the struggle of everyman's conscience to understand and be compassionate, yet hold strong to what is right and what is wrong. Maximillian Schell plays the defence counsel with a dignity and pride of being a German, even when being a German is at the moment a disgrace. Every perspective has a reason for being as it is, every human being has a struggle between blind alligence and thinking for oneself.

Are you embarrassed to think that you've read and seen enough already about the Holocaust?  This film is only tangentially about the Holocaust.  It is mostly about how morality shifts depending on who is in power and who wins the war, and how easy it is to accuse others of crimes that most of us under similar circumstances might commit or ignore.  It is about standing up and saying out loud that you have made a terrible mistake.  It is about not going along with the prevailing winds just because you tell yourself you'll try to do better later.The film is in black and white, which gives it a semi-docuemtary look,There are interesting shots, including zoom close ups used to great dramatic effect.  The actors never gave better performances, includingMontgomery Clift, Judy Garland, and of course Spencer Tracy.  Maxmillian Schell was fifth or sixth in billing for the film, yet he won the Oscar for the thankless role of being a defense attorney for German judges on trial in 1947 for committing crimes against humanity because they worked for and supported the Nazi regime.  This was a second-string trial, the famous criminals like Hess had already been tried and convicted.  Yet, Spencer Tracy's character, as head of the military court tribunal (written a little too nobly perhaps)takes this trial, and its implications, as seriously as if it had been the first time the issues of complicity and ""just following orders"" had ever been raised.  The film is 3 hours long and yet moves right along, and there are few slow moments.  I'm not sure if the Marlene Dietrich character (widow of an executed Nazi general) was essential to the story, but it was entertaining to watch Dietrich and Tracy play off each other. Watch them in the coffee-drinking scene in her apartment. This is still a great film, equally for the story and the issues it raises, and for the cinematic techniques and choices.",5,"An American  film made with  rare subtlety, especially for 1961",1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,1991,"['saw', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'Are', 'embarrassed', 'think', ""'ve"", 'read', 'seen', 'enough', 'already', 'Holocaust', 'film', 'only', 'tangentially', 'Holocaust', 'mostly', 'how', 'morality', 'shifts', 'depending', 'who', 'power', 'who', 'war', 'how', 'easy', 'accuse', 'others', 'crimes', 'most', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'might', 'commit', 'ignore', 'standing', 'up', 'saying', 'out', 'loud', 'have', 'made', 'terrible', 'mistake', 'not', 'going', 'prevailing', 'winds', 'just', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'try', 'do', 'better', 'later.The', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'semi-docuemtary', 'look', 'are', 'interesting', 'shots', 'including', 'zoom', 'close', 'ups', 'used', 'great', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'actors', 'never', 'gave', 'better', 'performances', 'includingMontgomery', 'Clift', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'course', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Maxmillian', 'Schell', 'was', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'billing', 'film', 'yet', 'won', 'Oscar', 'thankless', 'role', 'being', 'defense', 'attorney', 'German', 'judges', 'trial', '1947', 'committing', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'worked', 'supported', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'was', 'second-string', 'trial', 'famous', 'criminals', 'Hess', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'tried', 'convicted', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'character', 'head', 'military', 'court', 'tribunal', 'written', 'little', 'too', 'nobly', 'perhaps', 'trial', 'implications', 'as', 'seriously', 'had', 'been', 'first', 'time', 'issues', 'complicity', 'just', 'following', 'orders', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'raised', 'film', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'yet', 'moves', 'right', 'along', 'are', 'few', 'slow', 'moments', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'character', 'widow', 'executed', 'Nazi', 'general', 'was', 'essential', 'story', 'was', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Dietrich', 'Tracy', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'Watch', 'coffee-drinking', 'scene', 'apartment', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'equally', 'story', 'issues', 'cinematic', 'techniques', 'choices']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS

Rarely is a film good at both drama and historic fidelity.Note that ""Judgment at Nuremburg"" is cited in one of the Nuremburg trials online websites.  Why?  The lightly fictionalized trial of the middle management judges (disguised, no doubt, to protect the guilty) portrays well the main point and historians have noticed!!!Justice (and the judges) became whatever Hitler wanted them to be.  Then the Nazis lost and the Allies judged the leaders, including the ""middle management"" justices...persons who should have known better than to let Hitler seduce them into perpetrating injustice against other humans.burt Lancaster (as the most famous judge on trial) has a fabulous speech about the Nazi Judges!And watch young Maximilian Schell portray the intelligent but essentially still morally warped defense counsel.  He deservedly got an Oscar (tm) because you feel sorry for him yet angry at him--at the same time.The best casting is in two witnesses.  Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland---both who were not many years off from their life's end.  Their attractive yet somewhat ravaged faces and demeanor help them portray two other large (but mostly forgotten) victim groups...the disabled or maybe mentally slow (Clift) and those ""aryans"" (Garland) who just possibly had a romantic encounter with Jews.No this film is not a super action movie.  But your teen should watch it with you...And Judgment resonates today as we receive much power to manipulate the genetics of the future generation.Will we do what the Nazis (in their genetic courts) did and sterilize the ""unfit"" as was done to Clift's character in this movie?

392268,A3CFT5LHFCB46K,630396155X,"""weirdo_87""","[41, 41]","With an all star cast, Judgment at Nuremberg certainly delivers with powerful acting and great directing by Stanley Kramer.Burt Lancaster portrays one of four-nazi judges convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials. The year is 1948, two years since the main Nuremberg trials concluded and 3 years since World War 2 ended. Throughout the film, mention is made of the cold war. The invasion of Czechoslovakia and the Berlin Airlift are mentioned. Also, Emil Hahn (Played by Werner Klemperer, the future Colonel Klink) states, after he is sentenced, &quot;...Tomorrow the Bolsheviks sentence you!&quot; Speaking of perfromances, fine performances are also given by just about the entire cast, from Spencer Tracy as Judge Dan Heywood, to Montgomery Clift playing Rudolph Peterson, a victim of nazi atrocities. Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich also give great performances. But it is Lancaster, Richard Widmark and Maxmilian Schell (Who won an Oscar for Best Actor) who steal the show.In addition to everything listed above, the film's music fits it like a glove. The cinematography is also good. In addition, this version also includes the original theatrical trailer.This is definately one of my ten favorites and deserves a spot in the collection of any film buff (It has a spot in mine).",5,A great film about the War-Crime trials.,986428800,"04 5, 2001",2001,1292,"['star', 'cast', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'certainly', 'powerful', 'acting', 'great', 'directing', 'Stanley', 'Kramer.Burt', 'Lancaster', 'one', 'four-nazi', 'judges', 'convicted', 'war', 'crimes', 'Nuremberg', 'trials', 'year', '1948', 'two', 'years', 'main', 'Nuremberg', 'trials', 'concluded', '3', 'years', 'World', 'War', '2', 'ended', 'film', 'mention', 'made', 'cold', 'war', 'invasion', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Berlin', 'Airlift', 'are', 'mentioned', 'Also', 'Emil', 'Hahn', 'Played', 'Werner', 'Klemperer', 'future', 'Colonel', 'Klink', 'states', 'sentenced', 'quot', 'Tomorrow', 'Bolsheviks', 'sentence', 'quot', 'Speaking', 'perfromances', 'fine', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'just', 'entire', 'cast', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Judge', 'Dan', 'Heywood', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'playing', 'Rudolph', 'Peterson', 'victim', 'nazi', 'atrocities', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'also', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'Lancaster', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'Maxmilian', 'Schell', 'Who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'who', 'steal', 'show.In', 'addition', 'everything', 'listed', 'film', 'music', 'glove', 'cinematography', 'also', 'good', 'addition', 'version', 'also', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer.This', 'definately', 'one', 'ten', 'favorites', 'spot', 'collection', 'film', 'buff', 'spot', 'mine']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS
392269,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,630396155X,William Hare,"[6, 7]","Stanley Kramer was a daring filmmaker who never shunned controversy.  ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" represented his finest work, a daring masterpiece with some of the greatest film stars who ever lived performing at pinnacle levels.Spencer Tracy is a former U.S. Federal District Court judge who was removed from office by the voters in his home state of Maine at the last election.  He tells Edward Binns, playing a U.S. Senator, that he is ""an old hick from the backwoods of Maine"" and was ""not even the tenth choice for this job.""  He ultimately proves to all concerned just how wrong his initial self-evaluation happens to be.Richard Widmark and Maximilian Schell square off in a courtroom ""High Noon"" (another great Kramer drama) debating the issue of personal responsibility on the part of judges interpreting laws on behalf of a thoroughly unjust Nazi regime seeking implementation of decrees such as ""sterilization"" of those deemed unfit to live.  Widmark argues persuasively that as administrators of justice the judges on trial had a responsibility to exercise proper jurisprudence in the face of an administration dedicated to tyranny.  Schell is also persuasive as he argues that, were it not for the necessity of playing along with the regime at certain times, the situation would have been worse overall within Germany.Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland are moving as victims of Nazi injustices that went unredressed in the court system, while Burt Lancaster is towering as a noted German judge and legal scholar who parts company with his fellow defendants in admitting that in not standing up to the tyranny emanating on high, he is guilty for the crime for which he is being charged.  The highest dramatic point of the film is when Lancaster, a towering giant even in silence, stands up and shouts ""Enough!"" as Schell brutally badgers Garland in cross-examination.  He demands to make a statement, which Tracy allows, in which he concedes his guilt.A moving friendship develops between Tracy and Marlene Dietrich, whose husband was a Nazi military officer convicted and executed at an earlier Nuremberg trial proceeding.  She insists that her husband was no more than a military officer concerned about battlefield activity and openly admires Lancaster.  She is  crestfallen when Tracy concurs with Widmark that the judges being tried by the tribunal had a responsibility to uphold the law even in the face of a crazed floodtide of persecution and injustice emanating from the Nazi high command in Berlin.Abby Mann's brilliant script won an Oscar, as did the riveting performance of Schell in the Best Supporting Actor category.",5,Kramer's Masterwork,1019692800,"04 25, 2002",2002,2638,"['Stanley', 'Kramer', 'was', 'daring', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'never', 'shunned', 'controversy', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'represented', 'finest', 'work', 'daring', 'masterpiece', 'greatest', 'film', 'stars', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'performing', 'pinnacle', 'levels.Spencer', 'Tracy', 'former', 'U.S.', 'Federal', 'District', 'Court', 'judge', 'who', 'was', 'removed', 'office', 'voters', 'home', 'state', 'Maine', 'last', 'election', 'Edward', 'Binns', 'playing', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'old', 'hick', 'backwoods', 'Maine', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'tenth', 'choice', 'job', 'ultimately', 'concerned', 'just', 'how', 'wrong', 'initial', 'self-evaluation', 'happens', 'be.Richard', 'Widmark', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'square', 'off', 'courtroom', 'High', 'Noon', 'great', 'Kramer', 'drama', 'debating', 'issue', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'part', 'judges', 'interpreting', 'laws', 'behalf', 'thoroughly', 'unjust', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'seeking', 'implementation', 'decrees', 'such', 'sterilization', 'deemed', 'unfit', 'live', 'Widmark', 'persuasively', 'administrators', 'justice', 'judges', 'trial', 'had', 'responsibility', 'exercise', 'proper', 'jurisprudence', 'face', 'administration', 'dedicated', 'tyranny', 'Schell', 'also', 'persuasive', 'were', 'not', 'necessity', 'playing', 'regime', 'certain', 'times', 'situation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'overall', 'Germany.Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'are', 'moving', 'victims', 'Nazi', 'injustices', 'went', 'unredressed', 'court', 'system', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'towering', 'noted', 'German', 'judge', 'legal', 'scholar', 'who', 'parts', 'company', 'fellow', 'defendants', 'admitting', 'not', 'standing', 'up', 'tyranny', 'emanating', 'high', 'guilty', 'crime', 'being', 'charged', 'highest', 'dramatic', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'Lancaster', 'towering', 'giant', 'even', 'silence', 'up', 'Enough', 'Schell', 'brutally', 'badgers', 'Garland', 'cross-examination', 'make', 'statement', 'Tracy', 'guilt.A', 'moving', 'friendship', 'develops', 'Tracy', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'husband', 'was', 'Nazi', 'military', 'officer', 'convicted', 'executed', 'earlier', 'Nuremberg', 'trial', 'proceeding', 'husband', 'was', 'more', 'military', 'officer', 'concerned', 'battlefield', 'activity', 'openly', 'Lancaster', 'crestfallen', 'when', 'Tracy', 'Widmark', 'judges', 'being', 'tried', 'tribunal', 'had', 'responsibility', 'uphold', 'law', 'even', 'face', 'crazed', 'floodtide', 'persecution', 'injustice', 'emanating', 'Nazi', 'high', 'command', 'Berlin.Abby', 'Mann', 'brilliant', 'script', 'won', 'Oscar', 'did', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Schell', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'category']",Judgment at Nuremberg VHS
