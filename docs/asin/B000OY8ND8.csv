Honestly, what was the writer thinking? The target age for potty training is usually between 2 and 3 years, but yet they talk about big kids climbing trees, and riding bikes. Activities that NO toddler would be able to do anyway. This DVD does seem to have gotten fairly good reviews so I will reserve my final judgement AFTER my grandchild has had it for awhile.",2,Intro to Potty Training,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,504,"['have', 'previewed', 'DVD', 'do', 'material', 'presenting', 'viewing', 'toddler', 'grandchild', 'whom', 'am', 'trying', 'potty', 'train', 'Honestly', 'what', 'was', 'writer', 'thinking', 'target', 'age', 'potty', 'training', 'usually', '2', '3', 'years', 'yet', 'talk', 'big', 'kids', 'climbing', 'trees', 'riding', 'bikes', 'Activities', 'NO', 'toddler', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'anyway', 'DVD', 'seem', 'have', 'gotten', 'fairly', 'good', 'reviews', 'will', 'reserve', 'final', 'judgement', 'AFTER', 'grandchild', 'had', 'awhile']",Go Potty Go!: Potty Training For Tiny Toddlers

1066544,A310KT1UQC5UNU,B000OY8ND8,Reading Fanatic (CMP),"[0, 0]","I first purchased this DVD back in 2009 when I began potty training my daughter.  She loved it so much that we (notice I said WE) had to watch it over and over.  She loved to sing along with the little Panda characters.  She loved sitting on the potty while she watched the show.  She would keep singing ""go potty, go potty, go potty, go""  LOL.  When I started training my 3 year old son to use the potty, I broke out the old Go Potty Go DVD.  He was just as enthralled with it as his sister was.  As a matter of fact she, at age 5, would sit and watch it with her brother and sing along.  So cute!  LOL  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has little ones to potty train.  It encourages children to use the potty, while making the process fun!",5,My Kids Loved this DVD,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,756,"['first', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'back', '2009', 'when', 'began', 'potty', 'training', 'daughter', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'notice', 'said', 'WE', 'had', 'watch', 'loved', 'sing', 'along', 'little', 'Panda', 'characters', 'loved', 'sitting', 'potty', 'watched', 'show', 'would', 'keep', 'singing', 'go', 'potty', 'go', 'potty', 'go', 'potty', 'go', 'LOL', 'When', 'started', 'training', '3', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'use', 'potty', 'broke', 'out', 'old', 'Go', 'Potty', 'Go', 'DVD', 'was', 'just', 'enthralled', 'sister', 'was', 'matter', 'fact', 'age', '5', 'would', 'sit', 'watch', 'brother', 'sing', 'along', 'cute', 'LOL', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'little', 'ones', 'potty', 'train', 'children', 'use', 'potty', 'making', 'process', 'fun']",Go Potty Go!: Potty Training For Tiny Toddlers
