A more appropriate title would be just ""Drum Solo Choreography"" since there really is no technique offered here.  She suggests watching her other DVDs for a breakdown of the moves or pausing and practicing on your own instead.  There was one move she did--an ""interior hip circle"" (ummi) very quickly while moving forward--very Tahitian--that I liked but I couldn't quite figure out what she was doing and she never slowed down to explain anything, the music, the movements, any tidbit of cultural information...  Because of the breakneck pace (that somehow still takes 90 minutes) I'd only suggest this DVD to intermediate dancers that already have a good handle on technique that are simply looking to learn a new choreography.",3,"No technique advice, but a few cool moves--if you can keep up.",1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,830,"['Sadie', 'offer', 'interesting', 'moves', 'DVD', 'things', 'very', 'quickly', 'more', 'appropriate', 'title', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'Drum', 'Solo', 'Choreography', 'really', 'technique', 'offered', 'here', 'watching', 'other', 'DVDs', 'breakdown', 'moves', 'pausing', 'practicing', 'own', 'instead', 'was', 'one', 'move', 'did', 'interior', 'hip', 'circle', 'ummi', 'very', 'quickly', 'moving', 'forward', 'very', 'Tahitian', 'liked', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'never', 'slowed', 'down', 'explain', 'anything', 'music', 'movements', 'tidbit', 'cultural', 'information', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'somehow', 'still', '90', 'minutes', ""'d"", 'only', 'suggest', 'DVD', 'intermediate', 'dancers', 'already', 'have', 'good', 'handle', 'technique', 'are', 'simply', 'looking', 'learn', 'new', 'choreography']",N/A
1214794,A1SPAHK3KEKNVP,B001LM64BK,"Le Monde ""Le Monde""","[29, 29]","So you think you can belly dance and you think the moves look easy on the performance and you think it will take you only  three days to get this choreography and clean it up. Guess what we all thought wrong!! This is not like The art of the drum solo with Sonia or The heartbeat of belly dance with Jenna. Basic moves to different drum beats. Almost every move is layered, isolations are crisp and you are moving pretty fast. When she is breaking down the combo's and even repeatedly going over them, the timing is much more slower than the actual choreograph music. When you do each full combination with music before beginning the next one it takes about 2 seconds to do when it took 30 minutes to practice. Fast tempo.  ""This is not a beginner or beginner/intermediate dvd."" Intermediate/advanced and advanced students will probably enjoy there is no tutorial that break down moves you don't understand even though she does cover the moves pretty well it might be a bit much for beginner and beginner intermediate.Some of the moves can actually be broken down and used as drills of there ownThe title menu has the chapter list, performance and about Sadie.There are 7 combinations in the chapter list including the warm-up and cool down and performance I liked this dvd because the  warm up is not over done with ridiculous yoga poses that you need an instructor to help you do.The moves she does use is regular moves you would find in a belly dance classroom setting. Not too much information was packed into every combination. With only 7 combinations you would think a whole bunch of stuff was packed in. But Sadie sticks to the routine and the combinations are not overwhelmingly packed with moves. The combinations are just right challenging enough To keep you interested and once you get them you can speed things up to match the music.The practice of the combinations were enough too, even though you may have to practice a little more on your own. There was enough repetition to at least get something in your memory.What I didn't like about this dvd is that Sadie does not always explain the moves with precise details I really can't explain it, things were explained clearly but it seemed like some instruction was lacking in some way. Even that did not deserve to have a point taken off of though because its a nit picky thing. It won't hamper you from learning the dance, the moves are broken down as usual 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Nothing to worry about. ""THE INSTRUCTION WERE GOOD "" just not the best in my opinion. Secondly the arm movements were sparse I know in drum solo's your pretty much trying to isolate but her arms were pretty much just out to the side the whole timeThe performance in this section is the same performance in the title menu.The ""BONUS PERFORMANCE"" was nothing more than Sadie doing the choreography she teaches in a pretty outfit in the same room she taught the choreography that is why I took off one point. There was nothing really new to the performance no noticeable variations or anything to make it a bonus performance.It seemed to be a marketing tool to make you feel as if you have purchased more on the dvd. The moves look very nice and even though she is smiling Sadie seems tired during the performance.Is this dvd worth $20.00 if you really want to learn Sadie's choreography yes, but if you just want to learn some drills there are other dvd's available. Maybe a little more pricey but packed with more stuff. Thrillin Drillin.  This dvd  is certainly not worth the $30.00 Iamed prices. For a choreography dvd it is nice and it will take practice to get these moves pieced together nicely.The about Sadie section is just a written section about Sadie its very brief its not like she is having an interview with someone and really saying things about her life.",4,Choreography,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,3809,"['So', 'think', 'can', 'belly', 'dance', 'think', 'moves', 'look', 'easy', 'performance', 'think', 'will', 'take', 'only', 'three', 'days', 'get', 'choreography', 'clean', 'up', 'Guess', 'what', 'thought', 'wrong', 'not', 'art', 'drum', 'solo', 'Sonia', 'heartbeat', 'belly', 'dance', 'Jenna', 'Basic', 'different', 'drum', 'beats', 'move', 'layered', 'isolations', 'are', 'crisp', 'are', 'moving', 'pretty', 'fast', 'When', 'breaking', 'down', 'combo', 'even', 'repeatedly', 'going', 'timing', 'much', 'more', 'slower', 'actual', 'choreograph', 'music', 'When', 'do', 'full', 'combination', 'music', 'beginning', 'next', 'one', '2', 'seconds', 'do', 'when', 'took', '30', 'minutes', 'practice', 'Fast', 'tempo', 'not', 'beginner', 'beginner/intermediate', 'dvd', 'Intermediate/advanced', 'advanced', 'students', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'tutorial', 'break', 'down', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'even', 'cover', 'moves', 'pretty', 'well', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'beginner', 'beginner', 'intermediate.Some', 'moves', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'broken', 'down', 'used', 'drills', 'ownThe', 'title', 'menu', 'chapter', 'list', 'performance', 'Sadie.There', 'are', '7', 'combinations', 'chapter', 'list', 'including', 'warm-up', 'cool', 'down', 'performance', 'liked', 'dvd', 'warm', 'up', 'not', 'done', 'ridiculous', 'yoga', 'need', 'instructor', 'help', 'do.The', 'moves', 'use', 'regular', 'moves', 'would', 'find', 'belly', 'dance', 'classroom', 'setting', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'was', 'packed', 'combination', 'only', '7', 'combinations', 'would', 'think', 'whole', 'bunch', 'stuff', 'was', 'packed', 'Sadie', 'sticks', 'routine', 'combinations', 'are', 'not', 'overwhelmingly', 'packed', 'moves', 'combinations', 'are', 'just', 'right', 'challenging', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'once', 'get', 'can', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'match', 'music.The', 'practice', 'combinations', 'were', 'enough', 'too', 'even', 'may', 'have', 'practice', 'little', 'more', 'own', 'was', 'enough', 'repetition', 'least', 'get', 'something', 'memory.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'dvd', 'Sadie', 'not', 'always', 'explain', 'moves', 'precise', 'details', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'things', 'were', 'explained', 'clearly', 'seemed', 'instruction', 'was', 'lacking', 'way', 'Even', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'have', 'point', 'taken', 'nit', 'picky', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hamper', 'learning', 'dance', 'moves', 'are', 'broken', 'down', 'as', 'usual', '1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8', 'Nothing', 'worry', 'about', 'INSTRUCTION', 'WERE', 'GOOD', 'just', 'not', 'best', 'opinion', 'Secondly', 'arm', 'movements', 'were', 'sparse', 'know', 'drum', 'solo', 'pretty', 'much', 'trying', 'isolate', 'arms', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'side', 'whole', 'timeThe', 'performance', 'section', 'same', 'performance', 'title', 'menu.The', 'BONUS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'Sadie', 'doing', 'choreography', 'pretty', 'outfit', 'same', 'room', 'taught', 'choreography', 'why', 'took', 'off', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'performance', 'noticeable', 'variations', 'anything', 'make', 'bonus', 'performance.It', 'seemed', 'be', 'marketing', 'tool', 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'purchased', 'more', 'dvd', 'moves', 'look', 'very', 'nice', 'even', 'smiling', 'Sadie', 'tired', 'performance.Is', 'dvd', 'worth', '20.00', 'really', 'want', 'learn', 'Sadie', 'choreography', 'yes', 'just', 'want', 'learn', 'drills', 'are', 'other', 'dvd', 'available', 'Maybe', 'little', 'more', 'pricey', 'packed', 'more', 'stuff', 'Thrillin', 'Drillin', 'dvd', 'certainly', 'not', '30.00', 'Iamed', 'prices', 'choreography', 'dvd', 'nice', 'will', 'take', 'practice', 'get', 'moves', 'pieced', 'together', 'nicely.The', 'Sadie', 'section', 'just', 'written', 'section', 'Sadie', 'very', 'brief', 'not', 'having', 'interview', 'someone', 'really', 'saying', 'things', 'life']",N/A

I gave it a four because it does not teach you the basic drum solo tips about listening to the drums  It is something to test your skills after you have learned the basic/intermediate moves. The is the first dvd where I see a flutter included. She gives a brief description of how it is done. She points out that if you want to learn or drill the moves try one of her intermediate dvd's so she is really telling you that this is a advanced. Pops not locks are done. snappy moves.

I didn't consider myself a beginner anymore so I ordered Dynamic Drum Solo with Sadie and I've come to realize I'm not yet even intermediary. This workout is pretty tough, for me anyway. I've gotten the hang of some of her moves and I'm still working on others.I practice shimmies or other moves whenever I can and I've noticed that my middle section has actually slimmed down some. (Which is always welcome news right?)Sadie has a wonderful way of accentuating her moves in such a way that there is no mistake what she's done, which makes it easier to learn. For the majority of the video the camera is on her from behind and to her right. A large mirror in front of her allows you to see the way her moves look from the front. She encourages repetition for muscle memory on your own if need be. The DVD is divided into seven sections, so it makes practicing the same section over and over simple. At the end of the workout she has a demonstration of the entire choreography, and it's pretty awesome.I definately feel that my bellydancing has greatly improved due to this video and I truly enjoy dancing along to this well choreographed DVD.I hope I've helped you in deciding if this is the DVD for you.",5,Great workout,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,1270,"['wanted', 'try', 'something', 'little', 'harder', 'what', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'consider', 'beginner', 'anymore', 'so', 'ordered', 'Dynamic', 'Drum', 'Solo', 'Sadie', ""'ve"", 'come', 'realize', ""'m"", 'not', 'yet', 'even', 'intermediary', 'workout', 'pretty', 'tough', 'anyway', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'hang', 'moves', ""'m"", 'still', 'working', 'others.I', 'practice', 'shimmies', 'other', 'moves', 'whenever', 'can', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'middle', 'section', 'actually', 'slimmed', 'down', 'Which', 'always', 'welcome', 'news', 'right', 'Sadie', 'wonderful', 'way', 'accentuating', 'moves', 'such', 'way', 'mistake', 'what', 'done', 'easier', 'learn', 'majority', 'video', 'camera', 'behind', 'right', 'large', 'mirror', 'front', 'allows', 'see', 'way', 'moves', 'look', 'front', 'repetition', 'muscle', 'memory', 'own', 'need', 'be', 'DVD', 'divided', 'seven', 'sections', 'practicing', 'same', 'section', 'over', 'simple', 'end', 'workout', 'demonstration', 'entire', 'choreography', 'pretty', 'awesome.I', 'definately', 'feel', 'bellydancing', 'greatly', 'improved', 'due', 'video', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'dancing', 'along', 'well', 'choreographed', 'DVD.I', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'deciding', 'DVD']",N/A
