357188,A25RN8X70DSZLU,6303109926,JRP,"[0, 0]","Hello out there & welcome to this, this is where I go back & review movies that either came out 20 years ago or 10 years ago. This is 20 years ago The Air Up There. When I started this series a couple of years ago I couldn't wait to cover the year 1994 cause that is 1 of the best years ever for movies. Now The Air Up There was made for $16 million & made $21 million in The US so it was a decent sized hit. It was directed by Paul Michael Glaser who directed The Running Man & Kazaam I like The Running Man I haven't seen Kazaam since I was 11. Glaser has done mostly TV work. The movie stars Kevin Bacon as Jimmy Dolan, Charles Ditinga Maina as Seleh & Mabutho Sithole as Nyaga. The story is about this Assistant Coach named Jimmy Dolan & he meets this young man named Buddy Wilson who is brought over to play for The ST Joseph Bulls. He really only cares about money. He challenges Jimmy to a little 1 on 1 where Jimmy wins that sets Buddy off & he leaves The Head Coach is mad at him he let Jimmy go & Jimmy wants to become The Head Coach especially after The Head Coach announces his retirement he sees a video of this Kenyan man named Seleh who is great at Basketball. Jimmy wants a team player so he wants to bring Seleh to America & get a team player cause Buddy wasn't in it for the team. He goes off to Kenya he meets this man named Nyaga who comes more into play later on he makes his way to a village where he meets Seleh & he wants to bring him over here but there's a problem Seleh's Father is like some kind of Tribe Leader & Seleh is the next in line. Now you have this 1 character I won't really talk about named Sister Susan played by Yolanda Vazquez I have never heard of her before & I guess it shows. There are good bits of humor in this movie like when Kevin Bacon drinks some kind of milk looking stuff & it gives him an upset stomach or when he fails to understand their language. You also find out about Nyaga who is the leader of this enemy tribe he has taken a lot of their land & cattle & Seleh's Brother turned on them & joined Nyaga. You have these 2 Tribe members that are going to get married 1 of Nyaga's Men show up & burn the villagers huts down. You have The Village Leader challenge The Enemy Tribe to a game of Basketball if they win they get their land back & Seleh will go with Jimmy to The US but if The Enemy Tribe wins they take all the remaining land. Jimmy has 8 days to to get the villagers ready to play The Enemy Tribe. 1 of the villagers gets hurt Seleh asks Jimmy to take his place but explains that he blew out his knee back in 1981 when he won The State Championship. Seleh tells him he has to become 1 of them & he believes in him. he goes through this process to become part of The Tribe the part where he climbs the mountain is imo the best part of the movie. Anyway we get to The B Ball game & you know it starts off bad for Jimmy's Team & Jimmy's knee is injured you have this woman from The Tribe get in the game she gets thrown out when she starts roughhousing. Jimmy gets back in the game against everyone's wishes The Head Coach from ST Joseph shows up & Seleh says even if we lose he's coming back with them Jimmy tells him to do whatever he wants cause he only cares about getting The Tribes land back. Things start to turn around for them so Nyaga has 1 of his men take out Jimmy knee then you have Nyaga's driver who is also Seleh's Brother turn against the enemey tribe & join back with his tribe. Basically he helps them get close to defeating them 1 point away & Nyaga calls time Jimmy works up a plan for the team to distract the other players & have it between Seleh & the big guy from Nyaga's Team & Nyaga use his Trademark Move ""The Jimmy Dolan Shake & Bake."" The plan works Jimmy's Team wins & the movie ends with Jimmy becoming The Head Coach & Seleh joining The ST Joseph Bulls. Now is this a great movie no but I thought it was pretty good. Paul Michael Glaser did a pretty good job directing. Kevin Bacon was good. Charles Gitonga Maina was decent. Mabutho Sithole did a decent job. I thought this movie was petty good as I said.
