Just when we think we've figured it out, we realize that our meaning in life has so much more purpose when surrender to God completely.

Raised in PNG and then returned with his family to start a Christian radio station.

The PNG people are so tenderhearted and seemed wonderful to work as the movie depicted. I know there were many things that were difficulties that were not shown and probably for good reason plus why muck it up with all the hardships when there were so many joys and fulfillment to share. I really enjoyed this film and wish with all my heart that God had made it possible for me to stay in Samoa at that time but......it just wasn't the right time or place. It made me know for sure that I wasn't called into that line of God's work and that it was just someone else's &#34;good&#34; idea and that never works out when it comes to mission work in a foreign land. It HAS to be a GOD-CALL or there isn't a call. If for no other reason, this film helped me to see that my time spent on the mission field so many, many years ago wasn't wasted. It was a time my three now-grown children will never forget..... so this film helped me to put it all into perspective. I can now go on and serve God right here, right now. Thanks to &#34;Two Hats&#34; for the journey to PNG and back again.

I felt like I was living with the family, they really got you inside their entire life style and made you feel like you were right their living with them.  The ups and downs and fierce faith of living by and for God is so exciting in this movie., I loved how they shared so many aspects of their personal lives with us.  From preparing the meals to being attacked in a foreign market place , this documentary has it all!  You get a high 5 out of 5 from me, and I'm a tough movie critic :)  Maybe you could do a series of missionaries in different parts of the world and make a mini series out of it :).  IN any case very enjoyable and well worth the price, thank you again !",5,Great documentary,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,754,"['ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'missionary', 'life', 'was', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'living', 'family', 'really', 'got', 'inside', 'entire', 'life', 'style', 'made', 'feel', 'were', 'right', 'living', 'ups', 'downs', 'fierce', 'faith', 'living', 'God', 'so', 'exciting', 'movie.', 'loved', 'how', 'shared', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'personal', 'lives', 'preparing', 'meals', 'being', 'attacked', 'foreign', 'market', 'place', 'documentary', 'get', 'high', '5', '5', ""'m"", 'tough', 'movie', 'critic', 'Maybe', 'could', 'do', 'series', 'missionaries', 'different', 'parts', 'world', 'make', 'mini', 'series', 'IN', 'case', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'price', 'thank', 'again']",Two Hats
