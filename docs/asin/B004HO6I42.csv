No longer a loveable slushy drunk, Arthur's now a wild boy child, throwing money around doing his best to ease the recession (and possibly share a few std's along the way).2. Helen Mirren gets caught between the moon and New York City as she lovingly rolls her eyes at his antics and then makes it all better with a stern look and a snappy comment.3. Greta Gerwig plays his first real love interest (not counting Helen Mirren's character,Hobson), an aspiring writer of children's books by night and an illegal tour guide by day. Her character, Naomi, turns his heart around, and next thing you know, he's closing down the town (or at least Grand Central Station)4. His fianc&eacute;e Susan (Jennifer Garner), her dad (Nick Nolte) and his mom (Geraldine James) compete fiercely for the ""most unlikeable"" award. I know it's crazy, but it's true.5.

1409022,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B004HO6I42,Brad Baker,"[2, 3]","The new remake of 1981's ""Arthur"" has no Dudley Moore, but it does have Russell Brand running down Park Avenue in his underpants. ""In my scene at St. Bartholomew's Church, Arthur strips down in protest and runs out onto 42nd. Street"", says Brand.  ""New Yorkers now have photos of me in my underwear, which will soon become a Hollywood artifact, just like James Dean's leather jacket"".  No wall-flower, Brand is brash and loud-mouthed...almost perfect as the child-minded millionaire Arthur Bach. ""Arthur"" opens with the police chasing Arthur and Bitterman(Arthur's chauffeur) in  the Batmobile through Wall Street in Manhattan. Arthur's had a few too many, but he's not driving. Arthur is a 30-something who collects random women, movie cars, and cases of vodka. Arthur's powerful, scheming mother has determined that he must quit drinking, and marry Susan; or lose his enormous wealth. Eventually, Arthur enters re-hab at AA, and by now, he's sure he's in love with a spicy young girl from Queens; not Susan. Arthur barges-in on her grammar-school class. Startled, one youngster stands up and challenges Arthur: ""Are you a boy or a girl?"". Enough old-fashioned madcap frenzy continues to sell the movie. The cast includes Helen Mirren(in John Gielgud's role of Hobson; there is valet, here his nanny), indie darling Greta Gerwig as the doll from Queens, and Jennifer Garner as Susan Johnson, his arranged wife. And there's Luis Guzman as Bitterman, and Nick Nolte as gruff father-in-law Bert Johnson. Nolte is terrific, and has about ten lines in one scene. The HD theatrical release and the Blue-Ray disc nicely highlight Central Park, an empty Grand Central Station reserved for lunch, and a grand series of helicoptor swoops over the roof of the Pierre Hotel, where Arthur has his penthouse. The DVD features a selection of Deleted Scenes, and that's it. On Blue-ray, you get a Gag Reel, Deleted Scenes, and ""Arthur Unsupervised"", where Brand and director Jason Winer expose more fun footage, photos, and ad-libs. At 36 1/2 minutes into the movie, Arthur sit in his car checking his cell phone. A name comes up for just a few seconds on his phone book. It is Katy Perry.",3,Arthur: I'm going to take a bath.

1409024,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B004HO6I42,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 2]","Let me start out by saying that I'm not a fan of the original 1981 film `Arthur' starring Dudley Moore. There are a number of reasons for this but probably the biggest is that I don't generally enjoy movies with storylines focused on excessive drinking and alcoholics. This is especially true for films within the comedy genre. Having that said, you can imagine that seeing a mediocre 3 star rating overall on the 2011 remake of `Arthur' starring Russell Brand would only reinforce my decision not to view this one.Fortunately I watched the film before checking out its Amazon rating and I have to admit that I absolutely love it! Russell Brand is amazing as the man-child Arthur and while the image of a loveable drunk is not my forte he definitely pulls it off.  I also loved Helen Mirren as Arthur's lifelong nanny and surrogate Mother.  Brand and Mirren play off each other beautifully and their relationship is edgy, witty and poignant.What ultimately ties it all together and makes this a 5 star film for me is the hilarious, laugh a minute dialogue. Just about everything that comes out of Russell Brands' mouth is funny, unexpected and memorable. You know, the kind of material you want to write down so you could use it yourself in the future.  I was already a Helen Mirren fan before watching this film but was undecided on Russell Brand.

Perhaps I'm helped by not having seen the original movie. I grew up in the 1980's, and I was certainly aware of the movie. God knows I heard That Song everywhere. But I never actually got around to watching the film, even as an adult. This meant that I could view this movie for what it is rather than compare it.And what it is was actually pretty good. Yes, it's perhaps a bit much to ask American movie audiences to sympathize with a drunken billionaire, but for me the story worked.The movie tells the tale of Arthur Bach (Russell Brand), the previously mentioned drunken billionaire. His idea of a good time consists of drinking, dressing up as Batman, drinking, screwing every woman he can, drinking, spending money and drinking. He's attended to by Hobson (Helen Mirren), who does an excellent job in her role as his long suffering nanny. Arthur's mother, tired of his shenanigans, insists that he enter into an arranged marriage or give up his money. He's reluctantly willing until he meets a beautiful unlicensed tour guide, and begins to learn what love is all about, etc.As I said, I really liked this film. It's not the best comedy ever, but I enjoyed it. Brand and Mirren worked well together and if the story was a bit predictable, that didn't really bother me too much. Arthur does get some genuine character development in the story, even if it's practically forced upon him, and that's enough of a rarity in modern comedy that it's worth comment.It might have been wiser for the studio to do this in a way that had nothing to do with the Dudley Moore classic, but if you're like me and haven't seen that, or can just accept this movie on its own terms, I think you might be pleasantly surprised.

1409027,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B004HO6I42,David Baldwin,"[0, 1]","I was skeptical of this reimagining of ""Arthur"".  I saw the original thirty years ago with the late Dudley Moore and liked it then but in retrospect it unintentionally glorifies alcoholism.  Moore's Arthur was the proverbial drunk at the party with the lamp shade on his head with the other guests egging him on.  The premise is dated in these more enlightened times.  Also, I thought that Russell Brand had already covered this terrain with his Aldous Snow character from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Get Him To The Greek"".  I was immensely pleased to see that this reworking is not so much a glorification of alcohol abuse but a cautionary tale.  Yes, Brand's Arthur is drunk most of the film but our laughter is tinged with pathos instead of approval of his behavior.  Brand's character is 180 degrees removed from Aldous Snow and his Arthur engenders sympathy from the audience.  Helen Mirren makes a terrifically snarky Hobson in a role originated by John Gielgud.  The real eye opener is Greta Gerwig who makes a sweet and wholesome turn as Arthur's true love.

Or at least that's what the owners claim.  ""He's friendly!  See he likes you!  Down boy!  Down, I said, down!""Watching this remake of Arthur, with Russell Brand in the Dudley Moore role was a lot like going for a walk and having a big dog repeatedly jump on me.  He may mean well, he may have nothing but good intentions, but after awhile, it becomes annoying.  Disclaimer: I've never seen the original movie, so I can't say whether this one is better than worse than the oldie.  The plot is the same: a billionaire who has never grown up is faced with the threat of being cut off from the family fortune, unless he marries a woman (Jennifer Garner) who will be good for the family business. Surprisingly, he falls for another woman (Greta Gerwig) who is much poorer but a wacky free spirit who gives illegal tour guides of the city and secretly wants to be a children's writer. (The economic crisis is alluded to in the movie but briefly, and no one suggests that Gerwig self-publish online because that would remove an important plot point.) Given the poor track record of consummated onscreen weddings with the original couple, you can guess the ending.In 2012, alcoholism isn't considered as funny as it was in the early 80's, so there's a later emphasis on Arthur getting sober. As reviewers have mentioned, it can be difficult to tell if Brand's character is supposed to be sober or drunk in some scenes.The movie reminded me of ""The Wedding Singer,"" as Gerwig appears to have cloned Drew Barrymore's role, with hairstyle, wardrobe and adorable mechanisms intact.  This is a plus, as like that movie, the less than endearing traits of the main character are balanced by the likeability of the love interest.  Still, though there are moments of genuine sweetness when the romance works, there is also a lot of slobber to endure.",3,"""I thought a million would be too vulgar.""",1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,2001,"[""'m"", 'not', 'dog', 'person', 'sometimes', 'get', 'experience', 'joy', 'dogs', 'firsthand', 'when', ""'m"", 'outside', 'one', 'bounding', 'up', 'unleashed', 'ecstatic', 'see', 'least', 'what', 'owners', 'claim', 'friendly', 'See', 'likes', 'Down', 'boy', 'Down', 'said', 'down', 'Watching', 'remake', 'Arthur', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'role', 'was', 'lot', 'going', 'walk', 'having', 'big', 'dog', 'repeatedly', 'jump', 'may', 'mean', 'well', 'may', 'have', 'nothing', 'good', 'intentions', 'awhile', 'annoying', 'Disclaimer', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'one', 'better', 'worse', 'oldie', 'plot', 'same', 'billionaire', 'who', 'never', 'grown', 'up', 'faced', 'threat', 'being', 'cut', 'off', 'family', 'fortune', 'woman', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'family', 'business', 'Surprisingly', 'woman', 'Greta', 'Gerwig', 'who', 'much', 'poorer', 'wacky', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'illegal', 'tour', 'guides', 'city', 'secretly', 'be', 'children', 'writer', 'economic', 'crisis', 'alluded', 'movie', 'briefly', 'one', 'Gerwig', 'self-publish', 'online', 'would', 'remove', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'poor', 'track', 'record', 'consummated', 'onscreen', 'weddings', 'original', 'couple', 'can', 'guess', 'ending.In', '2012', 'alcoholism', ""n't"", 'considered', 'as', 'funny', 'was', 'early', '80', 'later', 'emphasis', 'Arthur', 'getting', 'sober', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'tell', 'Brand', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'sober', 'drunk', 'scenes.The', 'movie', 'reminded', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'Gerwig', 'have', 'cloned', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'role', 'hairstyle', 'wardrobe', 'adorable', 'mechanisms', 'intact', 'plus', 'movie', 'less', 'endearing', 'traits', 'main', 'character', 'are', 'balanced', 'likeability', 'love', 'interest', 'Still', 'are', 'moments', 'genuine', 'sweetness', 'when', 'romance', 'also', 'lot', 'slobber', 'endure']",N/A

Same dilemma, Arthur must choose between Love and Money...Man-up  and choose= Love, becoming as penniless as Naomi or Money= marrying the rich girl he doesn't. Its clear, whether you've seen the original how things will end (She's HIS toad) but the film is cute, funny and sometimes moving. Mirren and Brand have a solid dynamic, perhaps more so than his love interest, Jennifer Garner does a great job as the greed-driven would be bride, funny as well.

How to make sure I never drink your crappy booze again? Do just that. So there's the Faker's Barf whiskey, and then there's our hero, who has a drinking problem. Which he later cures via AA. So how does that jibe with an ad for alcohol in the first two seconds of the movie? Well, like everything else here, it doesn't.Brand can be very funny, as in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and less so in Get Him To The Greek, and even less so here. Dudley Moore had a sympathetic charm that Brand doesn't, and Brand is also a one-trick pony as a non-actor. That trick doesn't work here. There's literally only one scene in the whole movie that might be said to have solid acting all around, and that's the sob scene with Mirren and Brand near the end, and it's clearly her dramatic gravitas that rises his boat to a semi-even keel. But in all other scenes SB just seems weak and depthless. I'd like to have liked him, but couldn't have cared much less than the twee script could make me.This film is like watching a movie put together piece by marketed piece: ""Oh, the break-up scene goes here, and the fight goes here, and the Faker's Barf gets another product placement here..."" Paint by numbers and about as convincing.And we missed Christopher Cross' voice and melodies even more than Moore. The music here is dead and lifeless, just another aspect of the fine original that's barely even assayed this time around. Mirren is wasted and clearly did it for the cash and the nod to Gielgud. Everyone else walks on and off; Nolte has never done less in any film, one would guess.All in all, a painfully over-thought and under-delivered pre-marketed piece of Hollywood tripe that need never have existed.

Brand's engaging off the wall energy gets a little strained as we learn in detail why Arthur is the kind of person he has become.The last part of the movie is both sweet and funny.  It serves as a payoff for one's patience with the extended exposition.  Helen Mirren's character helps Arthur to finally realize that he has to grow up.  The scenes leading up to the climax at the wedding are very funny. Brand's scene at wedding shower is an absolute hoot.Nick Nolte and Jennifer Garner engage in a fierce competition throughout the picture to win the title of the most dislikable character in the show.  Nolte's rough-hewn larger than life presence is hard to beat, but I believe that Garner indeed beats him out, in the end, as the biggest jerk in the movie.

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[2, 4]","Let me first say that I have NOT seen the original (which I know to some movie buffs is a travesty) but it means I am judging this film entirely on my experience of it, not comparing it to the original. And based on that, this was definitely a solid 4-star comedy for me. Russell Brand stars as Arthur, an alcoholic rich playboy whose mother (also CEO of the family firm) has had it with his behavior, and ordered him to marry an ambitious rising socialite (Jennifer Garner) to soothe investors' worries about succession. Helen Mirren plays his long-standing nanny, and the only one who gets him, while Greta Gerwig plays his love interest.I felt Russell Brand and Helen Mirren were quite good. He was best in his scenes with her - she pulled a depth out of him, that brought a poignancy to even his comedic scenes with her. I also liked the chemistry between him and Greta Gerwig, although it took half the film for her to grow on me. Although I'm usually a fan of Jennifer Garner, I didn't like her in this role - she was too unlikable and not funny. Brand's scenes with her, as well as some of his slapsticky ones (such as when he works in a candy store for a bit) were the weak points for me. And I did have some discomfort with the comedic moments that were based on his character's alcoholism, although overall I thought the film handled this fine, with Brand attending AA etc., and cleaning himself up in the end (in other words, it toed the PC line, and I felt it didn't glorify drinking, as some reviewers have complained.)Because of the subject matter, it's not a laugh-out-loud kind of humor most of the time - there is a poignancy to Arthur, and there are sad bits to this film (don't want to spoil it by telling too much.) In the end I was really rooting for Arthur though, and that's a tribute to Brand (and indirectly, Mirren.)

I laugh at the antics of the Three Stooges, the silliness of Brett Reid in Green Hornet, and the humor in most comedy shows and movies. Of course, there necessarily must be some element of the humorous if a film is to be comedy. Alas for Arthur, the makers of this dud ignored that simple golden rule of comedy, instead opting to produce a film heavy on the idiotic and light on the amusing. In fact, this film was so stupid at points that you practically could feel your IQ dropping, and you were affronted -- not at the film makers, but at yourself, for, while this was without question a hideously misguided effort on their parts, the affront to your intellect that came with watching this monstrosity was yours and yours alone. I shall, therefore, not speculate on the implications of the fact that I soldiered on through this quagmire of inanity, banality, and utter stupidity, all the way to its ridiculous conclusion.I will only say that the film ended in the same vein as it began -- a bloated, repugnant heap of self indulgent, humorless waste. Much like the character it attempted to portray in an amusing light, this film was one that was born to a foolish beginning, squandered any potential it had in bouts of self aggrandizement, and ultimately suffered an inglorious end. At least, that is what I kept hoping would befall the unlovable pseudo-rogue who pranced, simpered, skipped and whimpered his way through the story.The actual plot -- a rich, spoiled man who, at his mother's dictates, must choose between love and wealth -- was not enough to make or break the film. The script, the veritable humor vacuum that overwhelmed considerable stretches, and the tragically misguided attempts at eliciting laughs, combined with the utter predictability of the conclusion, however, hastened to drown, bury, and say last rites over whatever potential this story might have had.1/5 stars for a film suffocated by excesses of idiocy and deprivation of humor",1,So bad at points that you can feel your IQ dropping,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,2057,"['am', 'means', 'film', 'snob', 'can', 'enjoy', 'silly', 'dumb', 'humor', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'laugh', 'antics', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'silliness', 'Brett', 'Reid', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'humor', 'most', 'comedy', 'shows', 'movies', 'course', 'necessarily', 'must', 'be', 'element', 'humorous', 'film', 'be', 'comedy', 'Alas', 'Arthur', 'makers', 'dud', 'ignored', 'simple', 'golden', 'rule', 'comedy', 'instead', 'opting', 'produce', 'film', 'heavy', 'idiotic', 'light', 'amusing', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'points', 'practically', 'could', 'feel', 'IQ', 'dropping', 'were', 'affronted', 'not', 'film', 'makers', 'was', 'question', 'hideously', 'misguided', 'effort', 'parts', 'affront', 'intellect', 'came', 'watching', 'monstrosity', 'was', 'yours', 'yours', 'alone', 'shall', 'therefore', 'not', 'speculate', 'implications', 'fact', 'soldiered', 'quagmire', 'inanity', 'banality', 'utter', 'stupidity', 'way', 'ridiculous', 'conclusion.I', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'film', 'ended', 'same', 'vein', 'began', 'bloated', 'repugnant', 'heap', 'self', 'indulgent', 'humorless', 'waste', 'Much', 'character', 'attempted', 'portray', 'amusing', 'light', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'born', 'foolish', 'beginning', 'squandered', 'potential', 'had', 'bouts', 'self', 'aggrandizement', 'ultimately', 'suffered', 'inglorious', 'end', 'least', 'what', 'kept', 'hoping', 'would', 'befall', 'unlovable', 'pseudo-rogue', 'who', 'pranced', 'simpered', 'skipped', 'whimpered', 'way', 'story.The', 'actual', 'plot', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'man', 'who', 'mother', 'dictates', 'must', 'choose', 'love', 'wealth', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'break', 'film', 'script', 'veritable', 'humor', 'vacuum', 'overwhelmed', 'considerable', 'stretches', 'tragically', 'misguided', 'attempts', 'eliciting', 'laughs', 'combined', 'utter', 'predictability', 'conclusion', 'however', 'hastened', 'drown', 'bury', 'say', 'last', 'rites', 'potential', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'had.1/5', 'stars', 'film', 'suffocated', 'excesses', 'idiocy', 'deprivation', 'humor']",N/A

He seems to take such infectious delight in silliness and incongruity.  He carries this movie with ease.I did enjoy Helen Mirren's nuanced performance.  It was an inspired bit of casting to have a woman in the part originally played so inconically by Sir John Gielgud.I actually preferred Greta Gerwig's portrayal of the love interest over Liza Minelli's.  Liza is so quirky and her character's life seemed a little depressing.  Greta, on the other hand, played the character with more wide-eyed wonder.  I just thought she was awfully cute.Jennifer Garner's portrayal of Susan did not do much for me.  When she plays neurotic, strident women (as in Juno), she is pretty easy to resist.I thought the two Arthurs made a perfect frothy weekend double feature.

After being told that he must either marry someone he hates or love $950 million dollars in inheritance, Arthur (Brand) must decide what is more important, money or love.  I had never seen the original ""Arthur"" with Dudley Moore so I decided to watch that before this one.  After watching the old one I was not impressed and was not looking forward to this one.  While watching this I started to like the old one more and more.  I understand the updates that they needed to do for the new one, but they made it a little too P.C., which took a lot away from the story and who Arthur was in the original.  I will say that I really get annoyed by Russell Brand, but he was not that bad in this one.  I also have to say he is the perfect choice to play this character.  Helen Mirren did a good job, but as much as I like her she is not even close to has funny as John Gielgud was in the original.  This is not as bad as I was expecting, but this one made me like the original more then I did after I watched it.  Overall, if you had the choice between the new one and the old one, I would pick the old one again.  I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - I don't think I will*Also try - Arthur (original) & Gullliver's Travels",3,Another example of Hollywood being out of ideas. Unnesessary remake that is not nearly as good as original.

Helen Mirren was a very interesting reinterpretation of Hobson, but the magic between Moore and Geilgud cannot be replaced. Even Bitterman in the original had an aire of dignity which is lacking here. We really felt it when Hobson died in the original--all the scenes here felt rushed. This is a very watered down remake just going throught the motions, the 'presence' is just not there and I don't feel any sympathy towards Arthur as I did Moore's character.
