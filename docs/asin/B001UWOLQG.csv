Also, I really wanted to get this series 4 on Blu-Ray, but I hardly notice the difference, meaning that resolution is just fine on DVD.The only thing that this set is lacking is extras but they do provide text bios on Agatha Christie and Julia McKenzie, and each DVD contains photo gallery and features some of the cast members' filmograhies. There's also subtitles for the hearing impaired.Not being very familiar with the Christie novels these movies are based on, I can't speak to whether or not they've been rewritten or butchered. I can say that I found each one very entertaining and wasn't bothered in the least with the camera techniques which seemed to put off another reviewer. When I read that review, I was expecting lightning fast editing like in the drug scenes inRequiem for a Dream (Director's Cut), but they weren't like that at all.And even though I know whodunnit, I'll be watching this series over and over again.",4,"*Stingy* Extras, But Still Enjoyable.",1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,1961,"['read', 'other', 'AGATHA', 'CHRISTIE', 'MARPLE', ""'ll"", 'know', 'started', 'withAgatha', 'Christie', 'Marple', 'Complete', 'Series', '5', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'then', 'went', 'back', 'beginning', 'series', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Marple', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'Collection', 'initially', 'starred', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan.I', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Julia', 'McKenzie', 'portrayal', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'bit', 'different', 'McEwan', 'actresses', 'do', 'fine', 'job.If', ""'re"", 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'start', 'series', 'order', 'change', 'actress', 'too', 'disruptive', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'episode', 'series', 'stand-alone', 'movie.This', 'set', 'great', 'guest', 'spots', 'featuring', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'who', 'starring', 'own', 'series', 'new', 'incarnation', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Sherlock', 'Season', 'One', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'others', 'place', 'time', 'period', 'shortly', 'WW2.I', 'think', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'as', 'well', 'wardrobe', 'gorgeously', 'done', 'never', 'once', 'anachronistic', 'faked', 'Also', 'really', 'wanted', 'get', 'series', '4', 'Blu-Ray', 'hardly', 'notice', 'difference', 'meaning', 'resolution', 'just', 'fine', 'DVD.The', 'only', 'thing', 'set', 'lacking', 'extras', 'do', 'provide', 'text', 'bios', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Julia', 'McKenzie', 'DVD', 'photo', 'gallery', 'cast', 'members', 'filmograhies', 'also', 'hearing', 'impaired.Not', 'being', 'very', 'familiar', 'Christie', 'novels', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'not', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rewritten', 'butchered', 'can', 'say', 'found', 'one', 'very', 'entertaining', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'least', 'camera', 'techniques', 'seemed', 'put', 'off', 'reviewer', 'When', 'read', 'review', 'was', 'expecting', 'lightning', 'fast', 'editing', 'drug', 'scenes', 'inRequiem', 'Dream', 'Director', 'Cut', 'were', ""n't"", 'all.And', 'even', 'know', 'whodunnit', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'series', 'over', 'again']","Agatha Christie's Marple, Series 4"

1242567,A1Q9IL7O2T6C1S,B001UWOLQG,Amy Smith,"[12, 20]","The character of Agatha Christie's creation Miss Marple is endearing and fascinating for various reasons.  The key ingredients that make for this are sadly lacking in this Series 4 presentation of the elderly sleuth character.  Christie's creation has the capacity to make herself disappear into the wallpaper.  She is always watching, always listening, interviewing potential suspects in the most inauspicious manner, her eyes calm and gentle, but probing and digging all the while.  She is quite witty, yet by no means self-possessed.  She does not respond as if she sees herself as a cute old lady.  She does,in fact, sometimes respond as if she secretly wished she could reel her ""feelers"" in and just enjoy society without stumbling upon so many of its' foibles and flaws.  As perceptible as she is, Miss Marple often considers herself one who has stumbles on the truth of the matter......We know better.  We know that Miss Marple is a relentless searcher of truth and an unrivaled genius at unearthing the dark things in human nature.......Joan Hickson was so adept at portraying the subtleties of the Marple character, all the more powerful for seeming understated.  Geraldine McEwan, although not supported by the quality scripts and direction of the Hickson tenure,resonated as Miss Marple.  She was quietly loving, fiercely loyal, but don't let that ever present twinkle in McEwan's eye fool you:  She could just as easily pass you that cup of tea and ask when you pulled the trigger right after she inquired if you took sugar with the beverage....In this Series 4 depiction, Miss Marple does not come off so much as an intuitive unassuming armchair detective as she seems simply like a nosy, prying old lady.  If Agatha Christie's character ever made bold enough to rummage through someone's bureau drawers, it would be in the course of a sanctioned errand or with some other ""legal"" means to trespass.....A true rendering of the Marple character is replete with that disinterested air that allows the guilty to relax so that her genius could be better facilitated. Miss Marple is not so hands on; she solves the mystery at hand with the inner workings of a mind even experts on human behavior can't fathom.......McKenzie does not truly understand her character here, and therefore this Series 4 adaptation does not work.",2,McKenzie is a decent actress but miscast here,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,2332,"['character', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'creation', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'endearing', 'fascinating', 'various', 'reasons', 'key', 'ingredients', 'make', 'are', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'Series', '4', 'presentation', 'elderly', 'sleuth', 'character', 'Christie', 'creation', 'capacity', 'make', 'herself', 'disappear', 'wallpaper', 'always', 'watching', 'always', 'listening', 'interviewing', 'potential', 'suspects', 'most', 'inauspicious', 'manner', 'eyes', 'calm', 'gentle', 'probing', 'digging', 'while', 'quite', 'witty', 'yet', 'means', 'self-possessed', 'not', 'respond', 'cute', 'old', 'lady', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'respond', 'secretly', 'wished', 'could', 'reel', 'feelers', 'just', 'enjoy', 'society', 'stumbling', 'so', 'many', 'foibles', 'flaws', 'As', 'perceptible', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'often', 'one', 'who', 'stumbles', 'truth', 'matter', 'know', 'better', 'know', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'relentless', 'searcher', 'truth', 'unrivaled', 'genius', 'unearthing', 'dark', 'things', 'human', 'nature', '.Joan', 'Hickson', 'was', 'so', 'adept', 'portraying', 'subtleties', 'Marple', 'character', 'more', 'powerful', 'seeming', 'understated', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'not', 'supported', 'quality', 'scripts', 'direction', 'Hickson', 'tenure', 'resonated', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'was', 'quietly', 'loving', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'ever', 'present', 'twinkle', 'McEwan', 'eye', 'fool', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'pass', 'cup', 'tea', 'ask', 'when', 'pulled', 'trigger', 'right', 'inquired', 'took', 'sugar', 'beverage', 'Series', '4', 'depiction', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'so', 'much', 'intuitive', 'unassuming', 'armchair', 'detective', 'simply', 'nosy', 'prying', 'old', 'lady', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'character', 'ever', 'made', 'bold', 'enough', 'rummage', 'someone', 'bureau', 'drawers', 'would', 'be', 'course', 'sanctioned', 'errand', 'other', 'legal', 'trespass', 'true', 'rendering', 'Marple', 'character', 'replete', 'disinterested', 'air', 'guilty', 'relax', 'so', 'genius', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'facilitated', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'not', 'so', 'mystery', 'hand', 'inner', 'workings', 'mind', 'even', 'experts', 'human', 'behavior', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', '.McKenzie', 'not', 'truly', 'understand', 'character', 'here', 'therefore', '4', 'adaptation', 'not', 'work']","Agatha Christie's Marple, Series 4"
1242568,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B001UWOLQG,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[39, 48]","Why is it that Agatha Christie has to be updated in order to appeal to modern audiences?Does Oliver Twist have to use his iphone to ask for ""more?""  Would the chills be greater if we seated Ebenezer Scrooge at a computer?  Would Elizabeth Bennett be more appealing to Mr. Darcy in a mini skirt?Why do we put Christie's characters in old fashioned garb, but give them modern sensibilities?  In fact, the changes may not be as important as the fact that TV hacks would try to ""improve"" on, Christie, the master of the surprise ending.  I don't like everything Christie has done, but of course the hacks don't try to change the bad stuff, they go right after the good.  You don't have to be a purist to prefer Christie's version to theirs.""Mystery"" in the 1980s honored Dame Agatha by presenting her stories and her characters as true to the originals as one can get when one is transferring a tale from the written page to the visual medium.  But her stories were written from the 1920s to the 1970s, and in order to give the viewers continuity, all Poirot stories took place in the fascinating (and geometrical) Deco Era and all Miss Marple's  tales were presented in the more homey 1950s.I'm not totally a Christie purist.  For instance, I love Peter Ustinov's depiction of Poirot  though I appreciate that David Suchet's marvelous performance is truer to the character that Christie created.  But I did not like Geraldine McEwan's portrayal (betrayal?) of Miss Marple, and as soon as I realized that the current ""Mystery"" series had put Julia McKenzie, with a flat affect, in a story in which Miss Maple hadn't appeared, I lost interest in the show.  I understand that the producers were trying to avoid the controversy generated by Geraldine McEwan and her series and so they put McKenzie in a story where she couldn't be compared to Joan Hickson.  But what hubris to try to improve on the stories of one of  the most brilliant mystery writers of all time.Someday I hope to see TV depictions of Agatha Christie's work set in the times in which she wrote, old fashioned mores and all, just as Dickens' and Austen's works are done.  The stories set in the 1920s can depict flappers and Cloche hats, gangsters and Jazz,  and the ones from the 1970s would be authentic with 8-track-tapes, bell bottoms, shag hair styles and discos.Part of the wonder of being human and part of our love of literature stems from the fact  that we can feel an identification and continuity with people from the past.

I'm sure Julia McKenzie would be an equally acceptable Marple but I could not stand to watch this series because of the film techniques employed.Rather than tell a straight forward story, the scenes are choppily edited into fast-video-flash bits, with weird angles and ultra closeups. The sequence is disjointed and hard to follow. For instance, in one scene in ""Murder is Easy"", Miss Marple is at a post-funeral gathering with a large group of other people (all suspects at this stage, of course). Two second snippet of conversation .... close up of Marple's eyes looking around ... two seconds of another out-of-context conversation... another close up of Marple's eyes ... etc etc etc. I felt like screaming ""Okay, we get it... she's listening!""In the first ten minutes of that episode, a dozen or so different characters are introduced, but so rapidly and with so little context that I am soon bewildered and confused. In addition, they all seem so unpleasant that I didn't really care who was killed or who did the killing!Perhaps younger viewers, weaned on fast cut editing, enjoy this type of filming more but for those who prefer more leisurely paced and cohesive story telling, this jagged camera work is distracting at best and intrusive at worst.I noticed the same problem with the new episodes of Poirot. The director and cinematographer obviously had a grand time showing off their techniques, but the stories suffered.What I don't understand is why these techniques, more suited to fast paced thrillers or action yarns, are used for classic mysteries which depend on character development and plot.

1242580,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B001UWOLQG,Byron Kolln,"[1, 2]","The fourth series of the new MARPLE, this time starring the delightful Julia McKenzie (""Fresh Fields"", ""Cranford""), who takes up where Geraldine McEwan left off as the octogenarian super-sleuth, Jane Marple.  Practically all of the McEwan/McKenzie ""Marple"" adventures have severely divided Agatha Christie fans, chiefly for playing around with the original stories (often putting Miss Marple into A.C. books that she wasn't even featured in).  This set includes two more ""re-writes"", which I've marked with a *.  All things considered, however, these new ""Marple""'s are enjoyable enough; if nothing else they are beautifully-designed and furnished with many British acting greats who play their roles with glee.Most importantly, Julia McKenzie's Marple is markedly different to Geraldine McEwan's earlier portrayal of the role.  McKenzie's Marple is a more benign presence, dressed in conservative tweeds, but by the same token isn't afraid to push herself into uncomfortable situations despite being labelled a ""meddling old busybody"".  By contrast, McEwan's Marple was almost a bohemian creature, dressed in oversized cardigans and crumpled hats.  By using a veil of vagueness to disguise her sharp intellect, many a murderer underestimated her at their peril.Julia McKenzie is much closer in spirit to Hickson's Marple, which may have been one of the reasons why producers decided to cast her in the part, hoping to lure back fans who'd been a little disappointed with the first three rounds of episodes with McEwan.Includes:THEY DO IT WITH MIRRORS - After lunching with old friend Ruth Van Rydock (Joan Collins), Jane is asked to visit Ruth's sister Carrie-Louise Serrocold (Penelope Wilton), whom she believes is being targeted by a murderer.  The suspects include Carrie-Louise's considerable collection of ex-husbands and stepchildren, not to mention the entire populace of a prison reform farm located near the Serrocold estate.Guest stars: Ian Ogilvy, Brian Cox, Maxine Peake, Elliot Cowan, Sarah Smart and Emma Griffiths Malin.WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS?* - After stumbling across a dying man, whose last words are ""Why didn't they ask Evans?"", Bobby Attfield (Sean Biggerstaff) is deliberately given the wrong address of the inquest at which he is asked to appear, and is later chased down by a car whilst cycling along a deserted country lane.  Convinced there is something suspicious afoot, Bobby teams up with madcap socialite Frankie Derwent (Georgia Moffett), and together with Jane's help, they travel to the mysterious Castle Savage...Guest stars: Samantha Bond, Richard Briers, Freddie Fox, Rik Mayall, Rafe Spall, Helen Lederer, Natalie Dormer, David Buchanan and Siwan Morris.MURDER IS EASY* - On a train, Jane meets by chance Lavinia Pinkerton (Sylvia Syms), who is on her way to Scotland Yard to report what she believes to be an unfolding series of murders in her small village of Wychwood.  When she doesn't make it to her destination, Jane takes up the case herself, passing herself off as one of Miss Pinkerton's old friends.  With the help of Luke Fitzwilliam (Benedict Cumberbatch) and young police officer Terence Reed (Russell Tovey), Jane must piece together the cryptic web of blackmail and scandal that binds together several of Wychwood's residents.Guest stars: Anna Chancellor, Shirley Henderson, David Haig, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Jemma Redgrave, Lyndsey Marshal, Steve Pemberton and Margo Stillney.A POCKET FULL OF RYE - Jane's interest in the apparent murder of millionaire London businessman Rex Fortescue (Kenneth Cranham) takes on a more personal meaning when she discovers that Gladys (Rose Heiney), a young woman from St Mary Mead whom she recently trained as a domestic, is now working for the Fortescue family.  As Fortescue's children squabble over their entitlements and the body-count rises, Jane teams with Inspector Neele (Matthew Macfadyen) to uncover the significance of the old nursery poem ""A pocket full of rye"" in Fortescue's death.Guest stars: Prunella Scales, Wendy Richard, Rupert Graves, Lucy Cohu, Helen Baxendale, Hattie Morahan, Ben Miles, Anna Madeley, Laura Haddock and Edward

First, I've only read one Miss Marple story, and that wasn't in this collection. Second, the only other actress I've seen playing Miss Marple prior to seeing this collection was Angela Lansbury in the theatrical version of ""The Mirror Cracked"". So my perspective will be different from one who either read the books or is more familiar with another actress. (By the way, just before writing this review, I've seen one with Geraldine McEwan, and I like Julia McKenzie better.)The four movies in this are ""Pocket Full Of Rye"", ""Murder Is Easy"", ""They Do It With Mirrors"", and ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" All of them are what you expect: Great acting, numerous suspects, plenty of plot turns, and an abundance of English accents. One thing I'll mention that I think this is better than Poirot: It doesn't always reach the climax by gathering all the suspects in a room and having Marple reveal who did it. I like this variety.I'll admit there are things I didn't like about some of them. ""Pocket Full of Rye"" felt the need to have two sex scenes in it. ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans"" had a couple of gross scenes. Those things aren't necessary in the story. But I didn't allow that to quench my interest in the story.One other item I'll confess to: Julia McKenzie's interpretation did remind me of Angela Lansbury.

1242643,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001UWOLQG,mirasreviews,"[66, 70]","Series 4 of the controversial ""Marple"" series from Granada/ITV brings us a new Miss Marple, reconceived from the previous seasons, now played by Julia McKenzie. McKenzie's Marple is not as frilly as the classic Joan Hickson or as bohemian as Geraldine McEwan's portrayal. This is a more intellectual, no-nonsense Marple. She wears 3 suits, unadorned and straightforward. And I only saw her knit once. Miss Marple seems less a little old lady and more someone's all-knowing aunt or governess, always ready with whatever is needed and possessed of a strong sense of justice. These episodes avoid the stylization that some previous seasons embraced. Like the new Miss Marple, Series 4 is forthright and conventional in its scripts and production design.""Marple"" has had no qualms about departing from Agatha Christie's books: rewriting action, characters, even the motives and identity of the culprits, and appropriating other of Christie's novels for the spinster detective. Continuing in that tradition, ""Murder is Easy"" and ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"", both non-Marple books, have inspired episodes this season. Sometimes rewrites seem only to make the films more salacious, and, although there was never a premium on plausibility or coherence in Christie's novels, the rewrites have tended not to improve matters, often creating solutions that are quite ridiculous. Marple purists will not like that. But I have noticed that the character writing gains more depth the further it gets from its source.Ultimately, it's difficult to say how Miss Marple should be adapted for a modern audience. Purists may prefer Joan Hickson's more faithful portrayal from the 1980s. Others, like myself, find Hickson's Marple dreadfully dull but lament this series' tendency to careen full throttle into burlesque. And, if the writers are going to rewrite Christie's stories, could they not improve upon the solutions instead of making them more ridiculous? Unlike Poirot, Marple does not have the distinct visual characteristics of the detective or the interwar milieu to latch onto. It has an elderly lady in gloves and a hat. In the past, this led the producers to toss sexuality into the mix at every turn and experiment with heavy stylization, usually with poor results (""The Moving Finger"" being an exception).Christie wrote her Marple novels and stories 1927-1971, but the creators of this television series wisely chose to set it in the 1950s, giving it a distinct look and grounding Miss Marple in a particular time. The filmmakers have seemingly tried every trick they could think of to make ""Marple"" interesting and relevant to a contemporary audience. Often those efforts have been laid on rather too thick. My own suggestion would be to capitalize on the post-War prosperity, conformity, and hypocrisy of the 1950s. That decade shares much in common with the 1990s and 2000s. Miss Marple is a woman who has seen the Jazz Age, two global depressions, and two world wars. She's not easily fooled by a bright, respectable faade. Create a subtext along those lines that would comment on our own time without being obviously anachronistic or straying far from the original plots.After watching ""Marple"" struggle to find its focus for four seasons, those are my 2 cents on the subject. I really don't know how to rate the series. I give it 4 stars, because Julia McKenzie's Miss Marple is personable, sharp, and fun to watch. Some viewers find that she doesn't have enough character, serving more as a device than a detective. But wasn't Geraldine McEwan's Marple irritating and vaguely sinister? If it's not one thing, it's another. The series lacks a cogent vision. Oddly, the first episode this season is adorned with completely superfluous location subtitles. It's one of those things. These are the episodes in Series 4:""A Pocket Full of Rye""'s killer takes inspiration from the nursery rhyme. Rex Fortescue, president of Consolidation Investments, dies at his office, apparently of poison. In the pocket of his suit, the police find a handful of rye. Inspector Neele (Matthew Macfadyen) interviews the family at their country home, Yewtree Lodge: the deceased's wayward wife Adele (Anna Madeley), eldest son Percyval (Ben Miles), who believed his father's mental health threatened the business, estranged son Lancelot (Rupert Graves), just back from Africa, neurotic daughter-in-law (Liz White), daughter Elaine (Hattie Morahan), who cannot contain her delight at Rex's passing, and Gladys (Rose Heiney), the simple chambermaid previously employed by Miss Marple. Gladys is having trouble getting on in the world.""Murder Is Easy"" is adapted from a non-Marple novel and heavily rewritten. Miss Marple meets Lavinia Pinkerton (Sylvia Syms) on a London-bound train. Pinkerton is headed for Scotland Yard to report two murders in her home village of Wychwood. ""Murder is easy,"" she says, ""so long as no one thinks it's murder."" She promptly meets her death in Victoria Station. Miss Marple travels to Wychwood and makes the acquaintance of Luke Fitzwilliam (Benedict Cumberhatch), formerly a police detective in Malaya. Together Miss Marple and Fitzwilliam make the rounds of the town's close-knit population in their investigation, as more of the population meets its end. Perhaps it is the rewrite, but the characters seem more authentic, emotions real, and with more dimension than usual.Miss Marple's glamorous old friend Ruth (Joan Collins) asks the detective to look in on her sister Carrie Louise after a fire struck her home in ""They Do It With Mirrors"". Carrie Louise is a committed philanthropist who runs a reform facility for criminals on her Stoneygates estate with her third husband Lewis Serrocold (Brian Cox) and daughters Gina (Emma Griffiths Malin) and Mildred (Sarah Smart) from her first marriage. With a staff that seems a bit daft, two stepsons with questionable intentions, a group of convicts on their doorstep, and an amateur theatrical in rehearsal, there is a lot of misdirection to be overcome when the antics turn to murder. In contrast with previous episodes, the police detective Inspector Curry (Alex Jennings) seems pretty sharp.""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"", inspired by the non-Marple novel, has Miss Marple helping the young detectives along and keeping them out of trouble. Bobby Attfield (Sean Biggerstaff) finds a dying man on a cliff who says as he expires, ""Why didn't' they ask Evans?"" When Bobby is called testify at an inquest that doesn't exist, an adventurous friend, Miss Frankie Derwent (Georgia Moffett), proposes that they investigate the murder themselves. But Miss Marple, who is visiting Bobby's mother, has her eye on the young duo. When Frankie proves too gutsy for her own good, Miss Marple follows her to Castle Savage, home of a quarrelling and rather sinister family whom the dead man recently visited. The plot is exotic and implausible. It suffers further from a cast of annoying characters.",4,"Still Struggling with Style, Season 4 Offers a More Conventional Marple.",1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,6944,"['Series', '4',

1242652,A42GFMF12V7XR,B001UWOLQG,Paul J. Mular,"[6, 10]","My first response to a new Marple series was....Why?Joan Hickson did it to perfection in all 12 novel stories! Sure, the picture quality of her episodes leaves much to be desired. The colors are washed out, the picture is grainy & the sound is muffled. Better money would be spent to clean these up to meet current broadcast quality standards, than to re-do the stories with new actresses.  Yes the picture is great here, fitted for widescreen TVs with crisp audio & subtitles.But like the Geraldine series, we will get two new Christie story dramatizations with this set.  And THAT IS THE REASON TO BUY THIS. Sure they are non-Marple stories re-written to put Jane Marple in them, but today that is the only way we will see these stories go into production.  A known name character is needed to push the project through.  Christie purists are cringing at this idea, but I understand the necessity.  And if you did not now the original story, I doubt you could tell the insertion of the new character.Unlike Geraldine, Julia McKenzie is a rather unknown actress to me. So I came to this series with some curiosity & uncertainty.POCKET FULL OF RYE seems to be directed by someone who drank too much coffee. It felt more like a spoof than a serious mystery. Like watching the movie ""Clue"", it all felt like a put-on. The quick zooms to dead bodies & angled camera positioning all felt over dramatic.  Instead of letting Agatha Christie's story create the tension, the director tried to use cinematography techniques to bring it on.  Quite honestly, if felt like someone fresh out of college was given a camera & budget to make this film.  The story is only saved by Julia McKenzie's performance & over all good production values (directing aside).The second episode, MURDER IS EASY, was totally different. That episode felt more like a classic Joan Hickson episode. Julie seemed to be channeling Joan for her performance here.  Miss Marple never appeared in the original story, a retired out-of town police detective is the original main character in the book. But here he is relegated to the side-kick of Jane Marple.  Jane is put in his place in most scenes, except at the Coroner's inquest.  In that scene someone of professional background is needed to convince the coroner it might be murder, so the original character from the book is kept around.  The director of this episode has decided to let Agatha Christie's story create the tension and we are there just to observe what is going on, and maybe try to solve the mystery before Miss Marple. WATCH THIS ONE FIRST!THEY DO IT WITH MIRRORS returns to a real Miss Marple story, and this production is in fine form.  Julia plays the role as a quiet observer putting the pieces together.  The direction is right on, allowing the story to creat the suspence.  The characters seem to be better developed than in the provious two episodes. The story does not suffer from being compressed to 90 minutes.  This comes the closest to a Joan Hickson performance in the entire collection of this series.Inserting Miss Marple into WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS was not as successfully done as in Murder Is Easy.  At first she seems surprisingly un-interested in the mystery around her, not a quiet by-stander, just not interested.  The amature detective young man & lady are the original main characters in the book, and they do take center stage here.  The trouble is that they are very annoying, making the viewing of this story less pleasent.  This adaptation will disappoint on two levels:Miss Marple fans will not be happy as she takes back stage & is not at her best. Agatha Christie fans will not be happy with the altered story line.You really want Miss Marple to lock the two amature detectives up in a closet so that they will stop making a mess of things!  I was really looking forward to seeing this adaptation, I think it is the only version of the book produced for the screen.  It is disappointing that it does not work.The guest cast is a 'who's-who' of talented British character acters.  I found myself playing another mystery game while watching, trying to remember which British production I last saw that actor in.  Unfortunately, the bonus material cast listing does not include enough of the actors, so I was on my own with IMDB.Over-all, I find it unnecessary to watch the remakes of Joan Hickson episodes, but seeing the two new dramatizations MURDER IS EASY & WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS makes this set well worth getting.  Even if the last episode is not perfect.One question to the producers: Why not make episodes based on the Miss Marple short stories?  It worked for Poirot and it is much better than re-doing perfection.",4,"Uneven direction, but Julia does capture Miss Marple in some episodes.",1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,4688,"['first',

I have a feeling Mckenzie was cast as Miss Marple based on her delightful work in ""Cranford,"" but as Miss Marple she is tentative and dull. Sure, McKewan was nothing like the actual Miss Marple created by Christie, but Mckenzie is simply boring.  Joan Hickson remains the perfect Miss Marple, though the eighties/nineties films she starred in seem a bit slow and stodgy by today's standards.  Yet Hickson is the only one who comes off believably as a genteel lady of the Victorian/Edwardian era.  Younger people seem to find Hickson's Marple too forbidding and severe, but that formality is what was once known as being ladylike and having breeding.  Underneath Miss Marple's reserve, however, was kindness, humor, and lively curiosity, and Hickson perfectly captures all this.As for the films themselves, they range from adaptations of books where Miss Marple never appeared, which involves tampering with plots to the point of incomprehensibility (Why Didn't They Ask Evans?), to those where significant, tarted-up alterations are made, false to the creative spirit of the author (Murder Is Easy), to fairly faithful versions, as far as plot is concerned, that are treated in an excruciatingly arch, campy manner, with cartoon-like filming techniques (A Pocket Full of Rye).  There is no way that Christie would have approved of any of this nonsense, whatever her grandson may say.It's all a shame, because the Hickson Marples were not perfect.  I would have loved to have seen modern, faithful versions of the books, even if they couldn't find as good a Miss Marple as the late Ms. Hickson.

1242662,A4FX5YCJA630V,B001UWOLQG,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[2, 4]","I had recently finishedAgatha Christie's novelupon which this adaptation was based, and so it was fresh in my mind as I settled down to watch. Given the tendency of ITV to drastically alter Christie's plots, characters and general tone, this was probably not a good thing.Miss Marple is on a train bound for London when she strikes up a conversation with the woman sitting opposite her. Mrs Pinkerton is on her way to Scotland Yard with a strange story to report: she believes that there's a murderer on the loose in her little village of Wychwood, and what's more: she knows who's next on the killer's hit-list. Miss Marple is troubled by this story, all the more so when she reads about Mrs Pinkerton's death in the newspaper the following day. She never reached Scotland Yard, but was pushed down an escalator at the train station.Miss Marple decides to investigate further, and arrives at Wychwood in time for Mrs Pinkerton's funeral. Striking up a friendship with Luke Fitzwilliam, an ex-police officer, the two of them begin to investigate the string of mysterious deaths in the village.As with many other of the 90-minute movies in this series, ""Murder is Easy"" diverges drastically from the source material - the most blatant addition being Miss Marple herself! For the record, I'm not a purist. I don't mind if these stories are changed around a bit, and in fact I've enjoyed the ones that have, such asThe Sittaford MysteryandBy the Pricking of My Thumbs, both based on mysteries that were probably too slight to translate nicely into a 90 minute movie. But if you're going to change the source material, you should make sure that you're changing it for the better, or for a good reason. This doesn't. The divergences from the original novel are either bad or inexplicable, and even if you *could* excuse the disregard for Christie's work, ""Murder is Easy"" doesn't really hold up on its own terms either.Dozens of characters are introduced in quick succession and in such generic ways that it is quite difficult to keep track of them all. Some are given such heavy-handed quirks that it becomes irritating - one girl spent every scene violently coughing to remind us of her ill health, so much so that it was a blessed relief when she finally died. The usual ""modern sensibilities"" have been added: passionate (and pointless) kissing in hallways, crude innuendoes, drunken slurring, secret abortions, incestuous rape by a mentally challenged brother - yeesh! Christie would hate this stuff - no matter how dark her subject matter, she never resorted to this level of gratuitousness.For the last two series Julia McKenzie has taken over from Geraldine McEwan as the spinster-detective. I know that McEwan's performance as Miss Marple was somewhat controversial, but it was also entertaining: her Bohemian clothes, her high, trilling voice, her sweet, fluffy exterior that could turn steely at a moment's notice - say what you will about her take on the character; you can't say that it was dull. Here, Julia McKenzie is impossibly bland, though I suspect that has as much to do with the screenplay as the performance (and yes, I do feel immensely mean in criticizing a sweet little old lady). This Miss Marple is an observer and a sounding board, not an instigator. Because of the drastic changes in the plot, her deductions are not based on observation of human nature or her usual technique of forming analogies between suspects and her acquaintances in Saint Mary Mead. Instead, they seem to be plucked out of thin air, and most of the time she seems superfluous (presumably because this isn't even a Marple mystery - in the book, Luke was the sole protagonist).However, one of the fun things about this series is the host of familiar faces.  Perhaps most surprisingly, Benedict Cumberbatch is present as Luke Fitzwilliam. At the time this was shot he was a relative unknown; now he's unmistakable as Sherlock Holmes in theBBC modern adaptation. Shirley Henderson has done the rounds on British television, but is probably most recognizable as Moaning Myrtle in theHarry Potter films, as well Anna Chancellor (Miss Bingley) fromPride and Prejudice, Russell Tovey (George) fromBeing Human, and Lyndsey Marshall (Cleopatra) fromRome.In the book, most of the murders took place before Luke arrived at the village. Understandably, all of them (and a few more) happen on-screen in the adaptation, all whilst Marple is staying in the area. This however, is the only change I could understand.The atmosphere of Wychwood-Under-Ashe is in its name: a place of dark cliffs, forested walks, ancient houses - but here it's just another English village. Heck, Miss Marple even states at one point that one village is very much like another. No kidding. Witch-like, mysterious Bridget is now a vapid American. Giles Ellsworthy, one of the book's most interesting characters, is gone completely. Also missing is Lord Whitfield, strangely enough, as not only was Whitfield a colorful character in his own right, but the pompous man-child was actually the killer's impetus! Without him, the motivation has been changed entirely.""Murder is Easy"" isn't as incoherent asWhy Didn't They Ask Evans?or as divorced from the source material asThe Secret of Chimneysbut it's still easy enough to skip this installment.",2,"""Murder is Easy, So Long as No One Suspects You...""",1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,5304,"['had', 'recently', 'finishedAgatha', 'Christie', 'novelupon',

Show, Public Broadcasting System stations, this side of the pond. This is actually series four of the most newly-made adaptations of these ever-popular stories; four new feature-length mysteries, and a new star, Julia McKenzie (Cranford;Notes on a Scandal), taking up the tweed.  (Series 1-3, starring Geraldine McEwan, have previously been released in this country; McEwan has, apparently, retired.)  The four episodes run approximately 372 minutes; other special features include subtitles. (Thank you Acorn Media, though I actually found that I could follow the shows quite well without them, as characters clearly speak Standard English.)These entertaining shows bear the trademarks of British TV: accuracy as to post-World War II detail, and lavish productions.  The estates are grand, the scenery is lovely, the scripts are witty, complex, and sharply-focused.  As always, the spinster Miss Marple, the ladylike, outwardly unremarkable little old lady created by Dame Agatha Christie, and beloved by millions, blends right into fashionable English society; but she brings her observant and insightful wits with her wherever she goes.The supporting casts are packed with stars.  A wonderfully costumed Joan Collins (Dynasty: Season Four, Vol. 1); Matthew Macfadyn (Pride & Prejudice (2003)); Jemma Redgrave (Bramwell Series 4 (2 DVD Set)); Anna Chancellor (Four Weddings and a Funeral); Rupert Graves (The Forsyte Saga - The Complete Series); Prunella Scales (Fawlty Towers - The Complete Series); Helen Baxendale (An Unsuitable Job for a Woman 1 and 2).  Also Warren Clarke; Brian Cox, Natalie Dormer, Rafe Spall, and Samantha Bond.  The episodes are:1. A Pocket Full of Rye.  Rex Fortescue, wealthy businessman, has been poisoned; soon Gladys, now in his household, a former maid of Ms. Marple's, will be found strangled, a clothes pin stuck on her nose.  Someone seems to have some very nasty intentions, and to be following a child's nursery rhyme in their execution.2. Murder Is Easy.  As long as nobody realizes there's a murderer at work.  Marple briefly meets another elderly woman, Miss Pinkerton, who remarks about this, on a London-bound train.  When our detective learns that Miss Pinkerton, too, has died, she travels to the seemingly peaceful village of Wychwood-under-Ashe to investigate its rash of mysterious deaths.3. They Do It with Mirrors.  Carrie-Louise, old friend of Marples, has always had a soft heart for charitable causes; currently she's keeping young criminals in a reformatory at the foot of her garden.  Her glamorous sister Ruth van Rydock (Collins, in full drag) is concerned, and asks Marples to look into things.  Murders ensue.4. Why Didn't They Ask Evans?  A dying man's last words send a local young couple off detecting; soon Marple joins them at Castle Savage, inhabited by a very odd family, recently returned from China, whose paterfamilias has just died, leaving behind a will that's full of mystery.These episodes are extremely well-done in every way, and quite enjoyable -- you can't go wrong with them.",5,You Can't Go Wrong With Them,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,3259,"['Agatha', 'Christie', 'Marple', 'British', 'mystery', 'television', 'series', 'made', 'ITV', 'Global', 'Entertainment', 'four-DVD', 'set', 'released', 'coincide', 'July', '2009', 'TV', 'debut', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'Show', 'Public', 'Broadcasting', 'System', 'stations', 'side', 'pond', 'actually', 'series', 'four', 'most', 'newly-made', 'adaptations', 'ever-popular', 'stories', 'four', 'new', 'feature-length', 'mysteries', 'new', 'star', 'Julia', 'McKenzie', 'Cranford', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'taking', 'up', 'tweed', 'Series', '1-3', 'starring', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'have', 'previously', 'been', 'released', 'country', 'McEwan', 'apparently', 'retired', 'four', 'episodes', 'run', 'approximately', '372', 'minutes', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'subtitles', 'Thank', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'actually', 'found', 'could', 'follow', 'shows', 'quite', 'well', 'characters', 'clearly', 'speak', 'Standard', 'English', 'entertaining', 'shows', 'bear', 'trademarks', 'British', 'TV', 'accuracy', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'detail', 'lavish', 'productions', 'estates', 'are', 'grand', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'scripts', 'are', 'witty', 'complex', 'sharply-focused', 'always', 'spinster', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'ladylike', 'outwardly', 'unremarkable', 'little', 'old', 'lady', 'created', 'Dame', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'beloved', 'millions', 'blends', 'right', 'fashionable', 'English', 'society', 'observant', 'insightful', 'wits', 'wherever', 'goes.The', 'supporting', 'casts', 'are', 'packed', 'stars', 'wonderfully', 'costumed', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Dynasty', 'Season', 'Four', 'Vol', '1', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyn', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '2003', 'Jemma', 'Redgrave', 'Bramwell', 'Series', '4', '2', 'DVD', 'Set', 'Anna', 'Chancellor', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Prunella', 'Scales', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Helen', 'Baxendale', 'Unsuitable', 'Job', 'Woman', '1', '2', 'Also', 'Warren', 'Clarke', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'Samantha', 'Bond', 'episodes', 'are:1', 'Pocket', 'Full', 'Rye', 'Rex', 'Fortescue', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'been', 'poisoned', 'soon', 'Gladys', 'now', 'household', 'former', 'maid', 'Ms.', 'Marple', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'strangled', 'clothes', 'pin', 'stuck', 'nose', 'Someone', 'have', 'very', 'nasty', 'intentions', 'be', 'following', 'child', 'nursery', 'rhyme', 'execution.2', 'Murder', 'Easy', 'As', 'long', 'nobody', 'murderer', 'work', 'Marple', 'briefly', 'elderly', 'woman', 'Miss', 'Pinkerton', 'who', 'remarks', 'London-bound', 'train', 'When', 'detective', 'Miss', 'Pinkerton', 'too', 'died', 'seemingly', 'peaceful', 'village', 'Wychwood-under-Ashe', 'investigate', 'rash', 'mysterious', 'deaths.3', 'Do', 'Mirrors', 'Carrie-Louise', 'old', 'friend', 'Marples', 'always', 'had', 'soft', 'heart', 'charitable', 'causes', 'currently', 'keeping', 'young', 'criminals', 'reformatory', 'foot', 'garden', 'glamorous', 'sister', 'Ruth', 'van', 'Rydock', 'Collins', 'full', 'drag', 'concerned', 'Marples', 'look', 'things', 'Murders', 'ensue.4', 'Why', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Ask', 'Evans', 'A', 'dying', 'man', 'last', 'words', 'send', 'local', 'young', 'couple', 'detecting', 'soon', 'Marple', 'Castle', 'Savage', 'inhabited', 'very', 'odd', 'family', 'recently', 'returned', 'China', 'paterfamilias', 'just', 'died', 'leaving', 'will', 'full', 'mystery.These', 'episodes', 'are', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'way', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong']","Agatha Christie's Marple, Series 4"

But I saw a trailer with Julia McKenzie in it and thought it looked pretty good so I bought Season 4.  I was pretty excited as I watched ""Pocket Full of Rye"" since it was shaping up to be as good, or even better, than the Joan Hickson version.  They did a great job of building up our distrust of the rogue son from Paris while never allowing us to suspect the real murderer, just like the book.  Whoa!  The reason is that in this rewrite, the most obvious red herring, the son, IS the murderer.  Marple reveals it with only circumstantial evidence and that's the end of the show.  What happened to the exposure of the real murderer?The plot device leading to the discovery of the real murderer is admittedly as old as the hills. In fact, Agatha Christie also used it in Hercule Poirot's Christmas; and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle even used it in Sherlock Holmes' Hound of the Baskervilles. That proves that it can't be so bad that it must be left out. There was just no satisfaction of a solved mystery at the end of this production.I did decide to go ahead and try another episode since I liked Julia McKenzie's portrayal of Miss Marple, and every other aspect of the production besides the plot was excellent.  Christian Gulbrandsen gets knifed very early in ""They Do It With Mirrors"". Yes, I said ""knifed"". For anyone who doubts that these plots have been ruined, not adapted, be aware that the entire plot twist and clue to the murderer in this mystery depends upon him being shot.  ""They do it with mirrors"" in the title refers to mis-direction and play-acting. It is impossible for the plot to be saved if Christian is killed by knife.

She is definitely prettier than Margaret Rutherford, softer and more grandmotherly than Joan Hickson, less crochety than Helen Hayes, and more introverted than Geraldine McEwan. With every fictional character (even Shakespeare's), an actor is left to bring their own interpretation to the part, no matter what anyone else thinks. So I applaud Julia McKenzie's courage in tackling a character so well beloved. When these later series arrived, I never thought I would switch my allegiance from Joan Hickson, but I was soon won over by Geraldine McEwan - it's the humor and the twinkle in McEwan's eye that makes her such a good Marple. However, I have liked Julia McKenzie in other things and I must admit I like her Marple too. McKenzie plays Marple as the type of wonderful listener that all the suspects reveal themselves to, precisely because she lets them talk until they say something important.I bought this series without even knowing which books they were doing and I am not disappointed. The sets and the care with which these productions are done is worth the price of the set. I was glad to see that they were trying to be a little more faithful to Agatha Christie. They went totally off the rails in 'At Bertram's Hotel' in the last series, you almost needed a flow-chart to keep track of everyone (but the sets were gorgeous).As far as the two 'non-Marple' episodes go, I like 'Murder is Easy' better with Marple in it - I don't think that anyone is going to argue that the last production (with Bill Bixby)is more faithful to the original. And you have to admit that if you want to see ""Evans"" as originally written, you have the opportunity as it has already been wonderfully done by James Warwick and Francesca Annis. Another plus is seeing all the great British actors (a la 'Murder She Wrote') in all the episodes.Being a forty-year fan of Agatha Christie and having read all of her mysteries, I think she would have had a problem with the 'sex scenes' and some of the 'creative direction'.
