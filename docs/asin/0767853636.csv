23072,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767853636,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","What's not to like?The singing is spotty, the musical numbers are all over the place, the little girl is highly annoying, the film is borderline preposterous and Albert Finney looks bored but we never are (bored that is).  The great thing about `Annie' is that no matter how bad it really is you can't help but like it.  I've seen this movie a hundred times (granted I was very little for the majority of them) and I could watch it again tomorrow (bet you're bottom dollar).There are a few versions of this classic story, but this one is my favorite (even if it is the worst as many claim).  It's the one I grew up on so maybe I'm a tad biased, but whatever, I enjoy it immensely.The film tells the story of orphan Annie who escapes the clutches of the evil Miss Hannigan when billionaire Oliver Warbucks decides to let an orphan live with him in his mansion for a week; and Annie is that orphan.  After a week of fun and games (and singing and dancing) Oliver decides (with a little prodding from the lovely Grace) to adopt Annie, but there is a problem.  Annie is waiting for her mother and father to come back for her, and so Warbucks decides to help her in every way he can to find her parents.  What Hannigan and her evil brother Rooster have in store for Annie (and Warbucks) is another story all together.Okay, so like I said, the singing is spotty (Finney, I love you but really?) and the dance numbers are somewhat spastic (some are great, some are ridiculous) but it all works and it is all entertaining, no doubt.  Little Aileen Quinn is an annoying little child and a really bad actress but she can sing (if that really was her) and her renditions of `Tomorrow' and the like are really nicely done.  Albert Finney, like I said, is bored.  He yells a lot and sings out of key but I just love him.  Really, the best thing about this movie is Carol Burnett who is all sorts of hilarious in this movie.  She give Hannigan the right balance of well intentioned cruelty to make her a character you love to hate.I will say that some of this movie is far from appropriate for children, especially when Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters (I love her here too) are on the screen (they tend to get rather risqu&eacute;) and there is some language that I didn't remember but all in all it is something that your children will love (my daughter, too young to really pay attention, was captivated by the singing).Embrace it for all its faults and relish in the campy qualities it possesses.

23074,AWI5YJF7TCN92,0767853636,"""anonymous_chick""","[11, 16]","A terrific, outstanding cast couldn't save this one.  Rule #1 in transferring musical to screen--never, EVER tamper with the numbers.  For some reason, the musical was completely retooled for the film, with half of  its best numbers dropped.  If you've never heard or seen the original  musical production, this version has nothing to do with the actual broadway  show.  Consequently, it's way inferior.  What made the musical great was  that it wasn't just about &quot;Annie,&quot; but Christmas and the Great  Depression.  There's nothing about that in here, so the movie loses all the  poignancy of the original.Rule #2--to make a successful show to screen  transfer, the numbers have to be shot in a fantasy style.  Sounds corny,  but I'm telling  you--it works (See the modern version of &quot;Pennies  From Heaven.&quot; As gritty as the storyline is, it works as a musical  precisely because the numbers are shot so unrealistically). When you shoot  a musical in a completely realistic style, no matter how good it is it will  never have the magical feel that makes musicals feel so special; the film  will just look like a regular movie with a bunch of dopes singing out of  context for no reason.  That's exactly what happens here. There's no magic  or charm in this &quot;Annie,&quot; although the cast had enough of it.

23075,A32Y55Z00QI12S,0767853636,ARK,"[3, 5]","Annie has been a family favorite for years. The songs are catchy, and there's plenty of glitz and glamor to spare. It's definitely a wish-fulfillment movie -- so much fun to watch and wonder, ""Oh, what if!"" And what a positive movie, too. Even though Annie is obviously in a miserable place, her can-do attitude and her optimism are as good for a bad day as a bowl of chicken-noodle soup is for a sick friend.Every single song is downright catchy. I often find myself humming them. And as for the choreography, it's usually wonderful and unique.Although I've heard that some have issues with the casting, I've always found it completely believable. Carol Burnett definitely does the best job among her fellow actors, so much so that it's difficult to see anybody else in the role of Ms. Hannigan at all. Bernadette Peters is quite excellent, and Albert Finney makes a grand blustering Daddy Warbucks. ""Annie"" herself is just perfect: what a great little actress!The story itself is very basic, but very enjoyable. The idea is that a ragamuffin of an orphan is ""adopted for a week"" by the richest man in America, and they end up becoming the best of friends. It has the air of a fairytale; many elements of the story, like the characters of the Asp and Punjab, are colorful and fantastic indeed. Now, if you'll excuse the fact that Annie's good luck is a little too good (the whole universe seems ready to bend over backwards for her), you'll find her character and story quite enjoyable. Perhaps this is because she's so kind to everyone around her; she never seems to become too saccharine. In any case, when I was a kid, I liked to imagine that I was Annie... street-smart, optimistic, opportunistic, and talented, too.There are negatives, unfortunately. If you're looking for tight choreography, well, Annie doesn't quite deliver. ""Hard Knock Life"" is full of acrobatics that never quite mesh, and girls whose moves should, and do not, match up. As an old marching-band member myself, I know too well that one person out of sync can ruin the whole routine, and that's quite true here. However, this incongruity usually seems limited to the dancing of the kiddos; the adult routines are downright lovely. It's like they weren't as picky with the children's accuracy, which is a bit sad.Also, the political overtones really needed to be omitted. When I was a kid, I loved seeing FDR because it brought history to life for me. Now that I'm older, it just drives me nuts. Well, not seeing FDR (it's always a treat, as the actor does such a nice job), but seeing this New Deal garbage mindlessly touted (which, as my grandfather liked to say, extended the Great Depression by ten years). It should be an ""aww how cute"" moment. Instead, it comes across as preachy, thoughtless, and cheap, taking advantage of the ignorance of a child to further political motives, which never fails to anger me. Thankfully, ""Tomorrow"" salvages the scene with aplomb (and I just love the ending ""pose,"" with Washington framed next to Warbucks!).There are also some parts of the film that just makes one feel a bit queasy. Burnett plays her scenes to perfection. Perhaps she plays them a little too perfectly! Ms. Hannigan is a low-life drunk, to be sure, but wow! Burnett gave the character a bizarre likability and attractive personality; nonetheless, I always found myself eager for her scenes to be over, even when I was a kid. She's the epitome of depression, and her scenes -- as well as those of the post-Annie orphanage -- are always big let-downs. They are stark reminders that Annie's fantasy is just that: a fantasy. The ending doesn't really make up for it, either. What could (and should) be a happy joyride all the way through is tainted with this sick reminder that this is just a movie. Now, I don't expect all of my entertainment to be happy, but in a movie like this, the effect is jarring, and the only word I can use to describe it is ""bipolar."" ""I'm a happy wish-fulfilling movie where everyone's dreams come true and every single person in the universe can jump into song and dance at any moment! OH NO, WAIT! I'M REALITY NOW! GOSH, THAT SUCKS, HUH!""Also, this really should be a kid's movie. So why, dear heavens why, are there so many creepy sexual overtones? Why, why, why must we have panty shots? Look, in the musical Chicago, such things made SENSE because that was an adult musical. In this, it just comes across as crass and seems done in very poor taste indeed.Really, as much as I have gone on about them, the negatives are slight in comparison to the overwhelming positive air surrounding Annie. There's something so magnetic about this film, and in the final act, one is positively glued to the screen. Overall, this is a fabulous movie.

A few years later audio CDs arrived in Portugal. When DVDs started to come out, I found out what a great picture quality compared to the old VHS tapes. And the possibility of watching a movie with English subtitles was a great way to learn English and to understand the picture much better than any language translation because there are expressions which just can't be translated. Either you understand it or you don't.Now with Blu-Ray, the movie companies go to every effort to force the consumer to buy the same movies again, after have bought them on VHS, DVD, DVD Special Edition. They make new special features, new cover designs, new commentaries, new everything but they forget Europe is in a economic crisis and even if we are SOOOOOO tempted to buy our favorite movies with the BEST picture and sound quality available, we just CAN'T! Us the portuguese have no money and no way to get it.

23108,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0767853636,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","It began with an 1885 poem by James Whitcomb Riley and led to a 1924 comic strip by Harold Gray, ""Little Orphan Annie"" was a series that may have focused on a young orphan girl, but the storyline was geared for adults as it was political.But by 1930, when the storyline was made into a radio show and in 1977 when it was made into a Broadway musical, suffice to say, Annie became part of America's pop culture and known for songs such as ""Tomorrow"", ""Maybe"" and ""It's the Hard-Knock Life"".So, with the Broadway production of ""Annie"" coming to a close, in 1982, Columbia Pictures released ""Annie"" based on the Broadway musical.  Directed by actor/filmmaker John Huston (""The Maltese Falcon"", ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", ""The African Queen""), the film would star an ensemble cast which included Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Ann Reinking, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Geoffrey Holder, Edward Herrman and the film debut of Aileen Quinn.VIDEO:""Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  While the film slightly has that aged '80s film look, outdoor scenes look vibrant, Annie's red dress to anything with bold colors tend to really pop.  And you can see the stubble of Albert Finney's bald head.  But for the most part, this is probably the best that anyone is going to see of ""Annie"".  I didn't notice any artifact problems or severe DNR.  There was a fine layer of grain and for the most part, the film does look on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital, Italian LCRS Discrete Surround, French, German, Spanish Stereo.  The film is primarily a musical and features dialogue.  Because it's an older film, I expected it to be more of a front channel soundtrack and I was right.  The dialogue and music is crystal clear and with songs that feature bass, there is a good dynamic range when it comes to the musical soundtrack.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Arabic, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition"" comes with the following special features:Sing-Along  - For those who want to sing-along to the film or a song, an exclusive for the Blu-ray is the sing-along (ala karaoke) for the musical scenes of the film.My Hollywood Adventure with Aileen Quinn - (12:04) Aileen Quinn reminisces of her time filming ""Annie"" and featuring video clips of behind-the-scenes of the making of the film and the promotion for ""Annie"".  Note: This is the same featurette for the 20th Anniversary of""Annie"".Trailer and TV Spots - Featuring the theatrical trailer, the behind the scenes making of the theatrical trailer and three TV spots.JUDGMENT CALL:Back in the early '80s, ""Annie"" was one of the first films I watched on cable.  At the time, ""Annie"" was a big part of American culture thanks to the Broadway play and the music.While ""Annie"" may not be as well-known for younger audiences of today or even young adults of today, ""Annie"" was one of those feel-good, rags-to-riches story featuring memorable music and at the time, a commanding performance by wonderful talents such as Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters but also from Albert Finney and Tim Curry.  But the film's true talents were young Aileen Quinn and the magnificent song and dance performances by Ann Reinking.The look and the feel of the film felt like New York during the 1920&#8242;s and the direction by filmmaker and actor John Huston was rather well-done.As for the Blu-ray release, for those who want to sing along with the music or learn the lyrics, can easily do so with the exclusive ""Sing-Along"" feature.  And for those who don't own the previous ""Annie"" releases, will surely enjoy watching an older Aileen Quinn discussing her experience of working on the film and the various talents at the time.  As for video and audio quality, there is no doubt that this is the best version of ""Annie"" to date.  While I wish there was more use of the music for the surround channels, it's still crystal clear coming from the center and front channels.  While the picture quality didn't look too aged or feature heavily use of DNR.But what it comes down to is one's nostalgic memories of ""Annie"" or one wanting to watch a family friendly musical on Blu-ray.  I used this film as an actual introduction to musicals for my nine-year-old, but the concept of why characters were continually singing and dancing and not enough conversation made him a bit impatient.  But I suppose growing up and being exposed to live musicals, especially watching ""The Carol Burnett Show"" as a young child of the '70s, helped ease me to appreciating ""Annie"" a bit more.Overall, Annie"" is a family film filled with memorable music, wonderful dance choreography with a talented ensemble cast.  But also featuring  a heartwarming rags-to-riches story that families can easily appreciate and enjoy.",4,Blu-ray: Revisit this classic musical on Blu-ray!

It was made to be viewed in a theater.  On a TV screen, it tends to look a bit overcrowded.  I can't recall ever seeing a more active musical with literally a cast of thousands.  And with the startling use of depth of field, you have way too much to look at in some of the more expansive sequences.  The two stars (Finney & Quinn) are practically lost in the opulent circus/party scene with all the lights, a b-zillion people, a fountain, acrobats, fireworks, and an elephant!  There is such a thing as too much.  As for the music, a lot of my favorite songs were cut and replaced by lesser efforts.  I've always thought the casting of Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan was a bit strange.  Albert Finney (Warbucks) was loud, Ann Reinking (Grace Farrell) perfect, Edward Herrmann dead on as Franklin D. Roosevelt.  And then there's the redoubtable Geoffrey Holder as Punjab, also perfect.

In all this, Annie somehow knows that they are not her real parents, and later Warbucks' friend President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the FBI soon learn that it is a true fact. Thus, the Hannigans' scheme fails before the two are arrested, Annie is adopted by ""Daddy"" Warbucks, and Oliver gives Grace Ferrell an engagement ring.So many elements make it an endearing movie to be seen many times.  The movie and story are both like a sweet dream. The songs continue to run through the mind, such as ""Tomorrow"", ""Maybe"", ""It's as Hard-knock Life"", and ""I Don't Need Anything But You"". The acting is very good: Victor Garber does well in portraying two types of people: a rich money-lover but then a kind, soft-hearted man. Kathy Bates does a good pose as Miss Hannigan, Audra McDonald is wonderful in her role as Grace Ferrell, the lady who is so sweet that she is too good to be true (but also knows how to handle well Oliver Warbucks), and Alicia Morton is very good as the precious-yet-very-brave Annie.

I agree with the reviewer who said that the people that compared it to old movie version were lost. This version is based on the play which is a lot better than John Huston's(Carol, Bernadette) mess. This was done right with some of the songs that were left out of John Huston's version put back in. In his version Tomorrow was thrown away. In this version the song is done full speed ahead. Reportedly John Huston didn't like the song Tomorrow and that has to be the biggest number and it is in this version. People who want action should keep their Carol Burnett version, but people who like music and cultured Broadway entertainment should get this one. I will admit that Kathy Bates is a little too nice and I would have liked it if the movie were longer and they had kept the Depression story line in. Annie does have red hair in this but don't know if they styled it right in this. I was in a stage version of the Broadway play and realized then how much better the play is than John Huston's movie. The writers of that movie are the ones who tampered with the plot of the Broadway show and not the other way round. It made me mad to read some of the bad reviews that were given by some of the people on Amazon. They don't have any idea what they are talking about because they must have never heard the Broadway recording with Andrea McArdle. Andrea makes a cameo on NYC in this version and sings wonderfully well. She is the original Annie and the best of all of the versions, but the Annie in this one can sing well and they don't have that dumb song from the other movie version  -Dumb Dog. So if you like good music well done, buy this one. If you want action, buy that awful movie version that wasted the talents of Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters, and Tim Curry with its claustraphobic set and action paced plot that was nothing like the musical which took place at Christmas and not Fourth of July.

This movie is a preposterous mess and it flopped for one simple reason: it bears little to no resemblance to the brilliant Broadway production of the late seventies.  The musical is full of fun and life, but the people behind this movie decided to go for a more cinematic version which was much darker and could and probably frequently does scare young children.  We have here Miss Hannigan, Rooster, and Lily actually succeeding in capturing Annie (which never originally happened).  We even see the young orphan hanging on to an upraised bridge for dear life (an eleven year old actually in deadly peril?! For shame!!!!)  The added characters (Punjab and the Asp) added nothing but stupidity to an already horrendous film.  How can anyone criticize the Disney film of a few years ago?  It is much closer to the stage version than this monstrosity (and it included one of the best songs cut from the theatrical release - N.Y.C.).  I find it fascinatingly questionable that a cast of this caliber could have been involved in this disaster.  Some of Broadway's legendary performers (Ms. Burnett, Ms. Peters, Ms. Reinkin) should definately have thought twice.  Perhaps they were anticipating a rebirth of the movie musical and went about it totally in the wrong way.  I am so glad that I was involved in a stage production of Annie as Rooster.

Newcomer Alicia Morton (who played Cosette on Broadway) joins Broadway veteran Victor Garber and the phenomenal Kathy Bates to take a fresh look at a classic.The main differences in this version are that it was staged more as a play - keeping true to its writing.  Also, the producers were smart enough to get a cast that can actually sing!  Morton's voice is beautiful and much stronger than fans are used to, but she does the songs justice.  The sets and choreography are also worth an extra long look.There are some differences, some songs have been cut (though NYC makes its appearance once again in a wonderful rendition by Garber).  A few minor plot changes, line changes, and order of scenes make this version unique, but not necessarily better nor worse than any other.Why 5 stars?:This DVD offers a fresh look at a classic and has an excellent cast that can act and sing!

As the dasterdly Miss Hannigan, she teams again with Titanic co-star Victor Garber (Daddy Warbucks)to lift a familiar script to new heights! Her closing &quot;Little Girls&quot; borders on temporary insanity--a fitting tribute to Mrs. Hannigan's preparation for '...the nut house'!As with most remakes, you'll either love this one or think it pales in comparison to the Carol Burnett version. This one is better. Audra McDonald (Grace) is perhaps the most pleasant surprise with her wonderfully melodious voice and an ultimate class that supercedes even Warbucks himself!Alicia Morton (Annie) does a fine job considering the talent and experience of the actors that surround her. The precocious 'brat' never seems intimidated, and in no way disappoints Annie die-hards. Neither do the orphans.The high point in the film is the poignant Warbucks-Annie &quot;Something Was Missing&quot; scene where the world's richest man pours out his heart in song to the child orphan who has stolen his heart. The subsequent dance sequence to the accompaniment of this beautiful musical score is memorable. Garber never loses sight of the tenderness that Oliver Warbucks surely would've possessed.All in all, a strong cast of Tony-winning performers at every turn delivers the goods in this Disney version of Annie. It takes an award-winning cast of this magnitude to make a story this familiar work again. And though we might be just a bit tired of another reprise of &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, we will never tire of this wonderfully happy tale that is now offered to a new generation!",4,&quot;Top-notch acting lifts a familiar script to joyous heights&quot;,981504000,"02 7, 2001",2001,1651,"['So', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'EVER', 'been', 'film', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'just', 'outstanding', 'job', 'dasterdly', 'Miss', 'Hannigan', 'teams', 'again', 'Titanic', 'co-star', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Daddy', 'Warbucks', 'lift', 'familiar', 'script', 'new', 'heights', 'Her', 'closing', 'quot', 'Little', 'Girls', 'quot', 'borders', 'temporary', 'insanity', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'Mrs.', 'Hannigan', 'preparation', 'nut', 'house', 'most', 'remakes', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'one', 'think', 'comparison', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'version', 'one', 'better', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'Grace', 'perhaps', 'most', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'wonderfully', 'melodious', 'voice', 'ultimate', 'class', 'even', 'Warbucks', 'Alicia', 'Morton', 'Annie', 'fine', 'job', 'considering', 'talent', 'experience', 'actors', 'surround', 'precocious', ""'brat"", 'never', 'intimidated', 'way', 'Annie', 'die-hards', 'do', 'orphans.The', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'poignant', 'Warbucks-Annie', 'quot', 'Something', 'Was', 'Missing', 'quot', 'scene', 'where', 'world', 'richest', 'man', 'out', 'heart', 'song', 'child', 'orphan', 'who', 'stolen', 'heart', 'subsequent', 'dance', 'sequence', 'accompaniment', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'memorable', 'Garber', 'never', 'sight', 'tenderness', 'Oliver', 'Warbucks', 'surely', 'would', ""'ve"", 'possessed.All', 'strong', 'cast', 'Tony-winning', 'performers', 'turn', 'goods', 'Disney', 'version', 'Annie', 'award-winning', 'cast', 'magnitude', 'make', 'story', 'familiar', 'work', 'again', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'bit', 'tired', 'reprise', 'quot', 'Tomorrow', 'quot', 'will', 'never', 'tire', 'wonderfully', 'happy', 'tale', 'now', 'offered', 'new', 'generation']",Annie

The movie version should have been a wonderful expansion of  the stage original, but this was not to be. Bordering on disaster, the  movie ANNIE has little to recommend it. A former review posted here by  Carolyn says it all. The movie replaced great songs from the stage  original(NYC,etc) with horrible new ones (DUMB DOG, WE GOT ANNIE, LETS GO  TO THE MOVIES,etc). There is nothing in this film that evokes the 1930s  Great Depression era the movie takes place in (where is the HOOVERVILLE  sequence). The movie in loaded with errors in regard to time and place. For  example, if Warbucks' 5th Ave Mansion is as expansive as shown in the  movie, it would have to located in Central Park; the movie Annie attends is  CAMILLE which never played at Radio City Music Hall and premiered in 1937  (not 1933 when the movie takes place, in fact RC Music Hall opened in late  1932); in the stage version the chracters attend a performance at the ROXY  Theatre which is as it should be; the New York in the movie ANNIE is a  mixture of unconvincing Hollywood sets and poor location shots which have a  1970s look and feel(why so many modern buildings in the background). Annie  as performed by Aileen Quinn is a pint size Ethel Merman who looks strong  enough to take on an army, she exhibits little heart and comes across as a  phony. Most of the other cast members are wasted or under perform thier  roles. Which brings me to the awful finale as presented in the move; the  stage version ends at Christmas while the movie becomes a summer circus;  Miss Hannigan is carried off to jail in the original while in the movie she  is seen drunkinly riding a circus elephant. What were producer Ray Stark  and John Huston trying to do? It baffles me to this day. Watch the ABC  Disney version of ANNIE it is not as good as the stage original but much  better than this awful movie version.",2,Terrible disappointment!,943660800,"11 27, 1999",1999,2032,"['Having', 'seen', 'original', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'production', 'Andrea', 'MacArdle', 'back', '1978', 'movie', 'version', 'directed', 'John', 'Huston', 'MAJOR', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'version', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'expansion', 'stage', 'original', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'Bordering', 'disaster', 'movie', 'ANNIE', 'little', 'recommend', 'former', 'review', 'posted', 'here', 'Carolyn', 'movie', 'replaced', 'great', 'songs', 'stage', 'original', 'NYC', 'etc', 'horrible', 'new', 'ones', 'DUMB', 'DOG', 'WE', 'GOT', 'ANNIE', 'LETS', 'GO', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOVIES', 'etc', 'nothing', 'film', '1930s', 'Great', 'Depression', 'movie', 'place', 'where', 'HOOVERVILLE', 'sequence', 'movie', 'loaded', 'errors', 'regard', 'time', 'place', 'example', 'Warbucks', '5th', 'Ave', 'Mansion', 'as', 'expansive', 'shown', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'located', 'Central', 'Park', 'movie', 'Annie', 'CAMILLE', 'never', 'played', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'premiered', '1937', 'not', '1933', 'when', 'movie', 'place', 'fact', 'RC', 'Music', 'Hall', 'opened', 'late', '1932', 'stage', 'version', 'chracters', 'attend', 'performance', 'ROXY', 'Theatre', 'should', 'be', 'New', 'York', 'movie', 'ANNIE', 'mixture', 'unconvincing', 'Hollywood', 'sets', 'poor', 'location', 'shots', 'have', '1970s', 'look', 'feel', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'buildings', 'background', 'Annie', 'performed', 'Aileen', 'Quinn', 'pint', 'size', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'who', 'strong', 'enough', 'take', 'army', 'little', 'heart', 'across', 'phony', 'Most', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'wasted', 'perform', 'thier', 'roles', 'Which', 'awful', 'finale', 'presented', 'move', 'stage', 'version', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'summer', 'circus', 'Miss', 'Hannigan', 'carried', 'jail', 'original', 'while', 'movie', 'seen', 'drunkinly', 'riding', 'circus', 'elephant', 'What', 'were', 'producer', 'Ray', 'Stark', 'John', 'Huston', 'trying', 'do', 'day', 'Watch', 'ABC', 'Disney', 'version', 'ANNIE', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'stage', 'original', 'much', 'better', 'awful', 'movie', 'version']",Annie

And if you're all grown up now, chances are that you'll abhor this DVD release as much as I do.  The people who released this DVD apparently didn't realize that since it came out in 1982, it would have a large audience of people who fell in love with it then, but have grown up to be discerning movie buyers now.  And grown-ups need things with their DVD packages, especially if those packages claim to be ""Special Anniversary Editions"".  They need things like commentary.  Sure, John Huston is long dead, but what about the living?  Why not round up Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Aileen Quinn and some of the girls for a real commentary track?  Grown-ups need in-depth making-of featurette documentaries, not sappy retrospectives narrated by Aileen Quinn as if she were talking to a bunch of grade-schoolers.  And grown-ups emphatically do NOT need cheesy sing-along and act-along with Annie features, or insipid trivia that any 8th-grade graduate could do.The worst thing of all about this DVD is the fact that it's not presented in letterboxed format.  What kind of era are we living in that we could get a movie shot in widescreen on a pan-and-scan DVD??  It almost made me cry to realize that I was missing a third of the action in most of these shots.  Had I realized that, I never, ever, would have paid for this DVD.

23167,A2ALDF5E2WY5TC,0767853636,"Kathleen Donaldson ""jverder537""","[2, 9]","""Annie"" was one of the best Broadway musicals of the past 30 years. It relied on content and talented performers instead of high-tech sets and lighting and un-taltented stars. Andrea McArdle as the loveable orphan was actually 13 as the perfect age to play Annie, who was I believe 12 in the stage show. She had a great voice and was tougher than the usual little girl. As Oliver Warbucks, Reid Sheldon was comic and warmhearted and as the beloved Miss Hanigan, Dorothy Loudon was a cynical, boozing broad, just as the charachter was written.In 1982, Hollywood put its rather dull and child-like stamp on ""Annie."" Not only does this Annie- Aileen Quinn have a horrible voice, but is also cutesy and phony. Albert Finney as Warbucks, although he looks the part, doesn't act the part. There is no pompus humor. As Miss Hanigan, Carol Burnett get the drinking part right, but that's about all she does through the whole movie. Ms. Burnett, although rather funny throughout the film, acts like a drunk through the whole thing. The characther is more than than.I am a huge fan of Bob Fosse, and Ann Reinking is one of his best dancers, however for this film, her taltnents were not shown. She was miscast for the role of Miss Farrel.The story was completely revamped to make Miss Hannigan look like a nice charachter. There was also no Arab servant in the stage show.The music was changed drastically. Did you know ""Tomorrow"" was actually a scene change song in the Broadway show? Well here it is song constantly, terribly as well. ""We Got Annie"" was planned as a song in the Broadway show, but here is sung by a bunch of people who we don't care about. It isn't particulary good here anyway.And ""Dumb Dog"" doesn't even count as a song.

Each member of the cast is absolutely perfect for their role, and they each play it to the hilt!  The music is great, and it's quite hard to stop yourself from tapping your feet and singing along!Annie is about a little girl who was left at an orphanage when she was a baby.  The living conditions in this place are absolutely horrible, and the woman who's supposed to be looking after these kids doesn't seem to care about them in the least.  All she cares about is money, booze and men!In comes a wealthy man who always takes a child from the orphanage each christmas and lets them live in his mansion for a week.  He usually chooses a boy, but this time he sends his assistant to get the child, and she spots Annie right away, & chooses her to come to this amazing palace.Annie is such an adorable kid - inside & out - that the entire staff at the mansion fall in love with her, and eventually, even the millionaire's heart melts for her.  He's decided that he wants to be her father.  But the ""den mother"" of the orphanage wants to stop this at all costs, and she devises a plan to make a lot of money, and get Annie back all at the same time.Will Annie ever get to be adopted?  Will the nasty orphanage ""mother"" get her way?  What about all of the other kids that are stuck in that horrible place - what will become of them?  I won't answer any of these questions, as I don't want to ruin it for you if you've never seen it.

Little Aileen Quinn seems like a real child, and whenever the camera is on her, there's always some real emotion in her face and in her voice.  Her singing voice isn't perfect, but it's real.Too bad the movie doesn't keep its focus on the children more.Carol Burnett is insane in the part of Miss Hannigan, sheer genius, and she staggers, coughs, sucks down booze like Lee Remick in DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES.  Every time she sees a man she gets high, her endorphins flying around the room.  She's got to be the easiest girl in town, and she makes it all seem natural.  It's a brave performance, and I notice that when she reforms at the very end John Huston has her do so in miniature, at the bottom of the screen while quarreling with Rooster, almost as if to say, he doesn't believe it either.Most of the numbers are very well done, except perhaps for the bizarre ""I Think I'm Going To Like It Here"" sequence.  Sorry, I just don't believe for a minute all those servants cavorting snd dancing with the sheer joy of serving Oliver Warbucks.  It's a spectacle without any foothold in reality.  What are we supposed to think about the plutocratic rich?  My sympathies are with the bearded anarchist who throws the bomb over the balustrade, the assassination attempt thwarted by that darn Sandy.  The whole moral of the story is, as Ann Reinking suggests to Albert Finney, that his priorities aren't correct.  ""Why do you love only money and power and capitalism?  They'll never love you back.""  The truth is, they do love back.  The movie could have shown that capitalism is, not too put too fine a point on it, evil; in fact, viewed at in one way, ANNIE is a spectacular, near Brechtian demonstration of the evil of money.Everyone's very good, excepting perhaps Ann Reinking, who plays the sweet, refined Grace Farrell, Warbucks' secretary.  Reinking is a fine dancer but not a movie star, no way.  Even on stage she seems ill-at-ease.  She was the 70s version of Ann Miller, and both of them hailed from the same Land of Wood.  She's got one number, ""We Got Annie"" in which she shows off the dancing Fosse taught her.  Everything else is just splinters.I remember how awful this movie was said to be back in the day, but give it a shot, there are some wonderful elements to it, and dream of the day when we can see it wide screen to appreciate the inventive choreography in the ""Hard Knock Life"" number, which looks so difficult and anarchic.

I also own the Broadway C.D and have seen the show three times. I was so excited when, I heard that Disney planned on re-doing the musical. I looked forward to it and when Annie first aired on ABC my mom let me stay up later than my bedtime to watch it. I had high hopes for the made for T.V musical- hearing that it was going to stick more to the Broadway show than the orignal did. But, it failed it lacked some kind of wonder or spark you would assume to get from it.Kathy Bates is no doubt an increadible actress but, in Annie I got no sense that she was evil or had it out for the orphan and was highly disappointed in her performance as the evil Ms. Hannigan. The orphans were cute but, lacked the talent, sweetness that you got from the orignal sweeties.Alicia Morton despite the rave reviews she has recieved online failed to impress me as the darling orphan and her voice seemed to lack the part- not to mention the charm you saw in the orginal Annie- Aileen Quinn.Their were a few good points I didn't know Victor Garber could sing and he had charisma as Oliver Warbucks I found myself wishing he would adopt me. And Audra McDonald who did a fabulous job in the Broadway musical Ragtime does just as good a job in Annie as Grace I found her increadibly charming and sweet. The dog of course is cute and I think was brought from the revival cast of the musical.But, the story was horribly adapted a mixture of the orignal and the Broadway musical leaving out a ""New Deal For Christmas"" and the F.D.R version of ""Tomorrow"" perhaps to save time but, it was a wrong move.This movie is bound to keep kiddies occupied for a time but, still dosn't have the charm that the orignal has- the great cast. Now, I do have problems with the orignal Annie- the storyline and such but despite that everytime I see it I feel happy and compared to this version it's the BEST alternative. I suppose why this musical made for television failed was because it was made for television which gave producers, directors, and actors less time to prepare and put the finishing details on it. The casting process too was a bit rigidity and I find myself baffled why they didn't cast kids that had a little bit more Broadway ecxpierience(Alicia Morton is the only one). You feel little to no connection in the cast and most members are decent singers but just lack pizazz!Judging by some of the reviews some people are bound to like it but, after it finished on television I felt nothing but disappointment and I only wished they had made this into an actual movie instead of T.V. it might have turned out better.

(1) I have seen the Broadway edition of Annie or (2) I have seen the previous movie edition of Annie.&lt;1&gt;This movie is very similar to the Broadway edition of Annie, which was before quite a few of our times. The setup, dance, and music was cut and edited like most of the stage productions are. If you were blessed enough to see Annie on Broadway, this movie is definately for you.&lt;2&gt;When movies are set up like stage produtions, the quality of the movie falls greatly. Also, Carol Brunett was BRILLIANT in the role of Miss Hanagan(I am a very poor speller); no one could ever play that role as well as she did.

The only thing that keeps her looking forward to ""Tomorrow"" is the hope that her parents will come back to get her.  One day her luck changes when she's invited to spend Christmas with Oliver Warbucks, the billionaire.  After he comes to care for Annie, he starts a search for her parents.  But when Miss Hannigan gets wind of the reward, she gets involved in a plan to swindle Warbucks and kidnap Annie.  Can she be stopped?I love the musical in its stage version, and was disappointed with the original movie.  I prefer this version because it sticks closer to the original.  While some things have been changed, most notably some references to the time period, the heart of the story remains intact.  This is very commendable considering it's running time is an hour less then the play on which it is based.  It always brings a smile to my face and keeps me humming the tunes for days.The cast is also wonderful in their roles.  Alicia Morton is perfect as Annie.  Victor Garber makes a great ""Daddy"" Warbucks, and I love watching Kristin Chenoweth.  But for me the biggest surprise was Kathy Bates as Miss Hannigan.  I was worried that she wouldn't be able to play the part, but she does an outstanding job.  In fact, I find her sober Miss Hannigan scarier (and much less annoying) then Carol Burnett's in the original movie.Fans of the original movie version will probably be disappointed with the trimmings made to make the story shorter and more like the play.

The only reason I was curious to see the film was because ""Chicago"" became my favorite film of 2002 and I was eager to see Rob Mashall's film directing debut. (Many people consider Chicago his debut, but this is it, although being made-for-TV). The cast is magnificant--Tony winners Audra McDonald (Grace), Alan Cumming (Rooster), and Kristin Chenoweth (Lily), plus four-time nominee Victor Garber (who makes a terrific Daddy Warbucks) and Les Mis&eacute;rables veteran Alicia Morton, who is absolutely mesmerizing in her portrayal of Annie. Oscar-winner and always terrific Kathy Bates is superb as the villainous Miss Hannigan, and surprisingly, she can SING!!! And although I haven't seen the stage version (as mentioned), Andrea McArdle's (the original Annie) cameo was very clever. Mention must also be made to the orphans, whose renditions of ""Hard Knock Life"" and ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" were absolutely sensational. That said, ALL the numbers are show-stoppers and very catchy, and the story is truly heartfelt. At 90 minutes, it is a perfect running length, as opposed to the 130 minute original (if I get fussy after two hours, I can't imagine how a child will feel). Adults and children alike are bound to enjoy this version, which many consider superior to the original. I believe Rob Marshall's brilliant directing and genius choreograhy are to thank. He definitely matured in ""Chicago"", but this is a fantastic debut, and it is easy to see its influence in ""Chicago"" iself. I am not a huge fan of remakes, thinking them pointless, but this is one remake I am thankful for. Now, if only a special edition DVD with Commentary and Behind-the-Scenes is released.

My complaint, seen here in ANNIE, is the  &quot;Readers Digest&quot; versions they're tending to churn out.I was  very excited to see this new version of ANNIE (the John Huston film from  the 80's was unmemorable and hilariously sent-up in John Waters' film  SERIAL MOM).  After viewing it, I realized the producers and director made  several mistakes.First, Mrs. Hannigan is the VILLAIN.  In order for any  basic story to work, there is a good guy and a villain.  Annie is the good  guy, Mrs. Hannigan is the villain.  Kathy Bates plays her as a sympathetic  lady just trying to run an orphanage!  At least Carol Burnett mined some of  that evilness in the Huston film.  In this version, any badness has been  &quot;Disney-fied&quot; out of the character.Also, Daddy Warbucks is too  nice.  Why do we even care if Annie ends up with him?  His character  doesn't seem to need changing at all.  His secretary seems to think he  works a tad too much, but otherwise he's been &quot;Disney-fied&quot; as  well.And dare I suggest that the romance between Warbucks and the  secretary (played by the incredible Audra McDonald) has been toned down  because of race issues? Or would a romance have been too much of a  character change for the screenwriter as well?I'm just so disappointed  with this production.  A highlight is the NYC production number.  Andrea  McArdle shines in her cameo (&quot;Just got here this morning...&quot;)  It's a fine, workman production.  But somehow, the heart seems to be gone.  Does anyone really understand the significance of the song  &quot;Tomorrow&quot;?  It seems like it's just cued up like the  show-stopper we all know it to be.  They film it with a big sweeping camera  move and end it on a special effects shot of New York city.  So what, I  say!  Keep a close up on the little girl playing Annie and let us see what  the song means to the character.I hope I don't sound too severe, but I  think they really did this show wrong.  I don't believe the reviews that  say ANNIE is a good production.

23211,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,0767853636,MollyRK,"[3, 4]","As much as I adored the original version of this film with Albert Finney and Aileen Quinn, I am not the type of person who instantly shuns remakes. I love the story of ""Annie"" and was very excited to see a new version when this first came out in 1999.The 1980's ""Annie"" flick had a specific passion and energy that pretty much cannot be equalled by anything. But this remake has something special going for it, partly because of what many other reviewers here have indicated: it follows the Broadway musical production much more closely than the undoubtedly fabricated fluff from the original. This movie tells the famous story in a lighthearted and simple fashion without going overboard with the music and dance numbers, and that is one important factor that can reel in younger viewers better this time around.Really, the only thing I didn't particularly love about this film was the acting. Alicia Morton is adorable (you can also catch her all grown up as the middle school ""mean girl"" in the Lifetime movie ""Odd Girl Out""), but she lacks the mental and physical toughness that made Aileen Quinn's performance such a knockout. Morton is too soft-spoken in her role, and she seems to be reciting lines more than she emotes in front of the camera, but for the movie it still works okay. Kathy Bates' performance was arguably one of the biggest mistakes; we all know what kind of character Miss Hannigan is, and Bates portrayed her as a relatively nice woman whose biggest problem with the little orphans seemed to be just getting a little annoyed with them from time to time. Victor Garber is a terrific actor, and I enjoyed him in this movie, but he didn't show Oliver Warbucks' typical transition from gruffness to having his heart melted by little Annie. The woman in the role of Grace Farrell probably did the best job; she was kind, sensitive, and just loved Annie--her performance was right on target.In this film's defense, maybe their reason for toning down the demeanors of some of these main characters was to keep it a light, easy and enjoyable movie for children. In that sense, I think kids will like it better than the original because it just tells the story from Annie's viewpoint and keeps a youthful, innocent glow to it. So, even if you are very loyal to the original, this is certainly something worth examining with an open mind--if nothing else, you get a sweet, classic story in a fresh new perspective.",4,a classic story that's worth your attention,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2429,"['As', 'much', 'adored', 'original', 'version', 'film', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Aileen', 'Quinn', 'am', 'not', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'instantly', 'remakes', 'love', 'story', 'Annie', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'new', 'version', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1999.The', '1980', 'Annie', 'flick', 'had', 'specific', 'passion', 'energy', 'pretty', 'much', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'equalled', 'anything', 'remake', 'something', 'special', 'going', 'partly', 'what', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'indicated', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'production', 'much', 'more', 'closely', 'undoubtedly', 'fabricated', 'fluff', 'original', 'movie', 'famous', 'story', 'lighthearted', 'simple', 'fashion', 'going', 'overboard', 'music', 'dance', 'numbers', 'one', 'important', 'factor', 'can', 'reel', 'younger', 'viewers', 'better', 'time', 'around.Really', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'love', 'film', 'was', 'acting', 'Alicia', 'Morton', 'adorable', 'can', 'also', 'catch', 'grown', 'up', 'middle', 'school', 'mean', 'girl', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'Odd', 'Girl', 'Out', 'mental', 'physical', 'toughness', 'made', 'Aileen', 'Quinn', 'performance', 'knockout', 'Morton', 'too', 'soft-spoken', 'role', 'be', 'reciting', 'lines', 'more', 'front', 'camera', 'movie', 'still', 'okay', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'performance', 'was', 'arguably', 'one', 'biggest', 'mistakes', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'character', 'Miss', 'Hannigan', 'Bates', 'portrayed', 'relatively', 'nice', 'woman', 'biggest', 'problem', 'little', 'orphans', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'getting', 'little', 'annoyed', 'time', 'time', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'terrific', 'actor', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'Oliver', 'Warbucks', 'typical', 'transition', 'gruffness', 'having', 'heart', 'melted', 'little', 'Annie', 'woman', 'role', 'Grace', 'Farrell', 'probably', 'did', 'best', 'job', 'was', 'kind', 'sensitive', 'just', 'loved', 'Annie', 'performance', 'was', 'right', 'target.In', 'film', 'defense', 'maybe', 'reason', 'toning', 'down', 'demeanors', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'keep', 'light', 'easy', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'children', 'sense', 'think', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'better', 'original', 'just', 'story', 'Annie', 'viewpoint', 'youthful', 'innocent', 'glow', 'So', 'even', 'are', 'very', 'loyal', 'original', 'certainly', 'something', 'worth', 'examining', 'open', 'mind', 'nothing', 'else', 'get', 'sweet', 'classic', 'story', 'fresh', 'new', 'perspective']",Annie

John Huston slipped in a few (weak) references that only a dedicated Gray fan would understand, the film overall is a terrible adaptation.Daddy Warbucks is a tireless enemy to crime in all its forms & devotes his life to bringing justice to criminals who escape legal punishment. That is what Punjab & The Asp are for, they are efficient assassins who step in when ""Daddy"" needs them. Annie isn't a cute singing moppet, she is a pint-sized adventuress who endures true hardship & tragedy and often joins in Warbucks' fight against crime. Punjab is not a sideshow conjurer, Gray's world is filled with *real* magic, miracles, and supernatural occurrences. The drunken carpet-baggers in this movie would be no challenge at all to the real Annie or Warbucks, and if they crossed a certain line, the real Daddy Warbucks would send the Asp along in the night to make sure they would never hurt children again.It pains me to write this since I am a huge John Huston fan. I can only imagine what he would have done with the real source material, not a musical that steals its plot from ""Silas Marner"" and requires these dignified, intense, often dark characters to stop and do a little song & dance every five minutes.Skip this & read the Fantagraphics reprint series.

I grew up watching the old Aileen Quinn version and loved it to bits. However, after the first 15 minutes of this, I couldn't stomach any more. Aileen Quinn's Annie was spunky, spirited, cheeky and appealing; this new Annie is simply cute, sickeningly sweet and has no fire in her whatsoever.I did feel sorry for Kathy Bates, having to follow the brilliant Carol Burnett in the role of Miss Hannigan; she does a decent job while unfortunately not expressing any of the worn-out contempt and resignation with which Carol managed to imbue her performance. Victor Garber is adequate (I do like him very much as an actor), but also fails to play Daddy Warbucks with the overbearing bluster and paternal warmth of Albert Finney.Although the older version contains more theatrical elements, such as the unlikely dance numbers etc, the new version has a far more theatrical quality to it overall (by which I mean ""hammy""). Nor does it convey the sense of time and place as well as the older version.Basically, this was a huge disappointment to me, with none of the warmth, attitude and exuberance of the original.

23223,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,0767853636,Nix Pix,"[2, 4]","Based on the comic strip, ""Little Orphan Annie"" which later became a Broadway show that, of course, finally became a big budget movie, ""Annie"" is the 1981 musical from producer Ray Stark and director John Huston.  Odd, that neither had much experience with the musical genre until this film.  Some of their inexperience shows up on the screen.  The dance numbers are butchered in the editing and some good talent, though competent in their roles, are wasted nevertheless with a genuinely simple handling of the subject matter.  But what about the transfer - Columbia has made the film available in both full frame and the original widescreen format, enhanced here for 16X9 televisions.  For the purposes of film purists, this review will concentrate on the widescreen version of the film.  Colors are rich and nicely balanced.  Blacks are sometimes weak but nothing that leads to any great disappointment.  However, there are some framing issues, specifically during the ""Let's Go To The Movies"" musical number in which it appears as though someone has accidentally reframed a full screen version of this sequence, instead of using the 2:35:1 aspect ratio image.  Actor's heads are cut off and there is some interfield jittering as the camera pans to capture the action.  Otherwise, the rest of the film appears to have the proper widescreen image framed.  The ending of this movie is still its best part, with a gala party at the Warbuck's mansion yielding rich colors and bold blacks.  Fine grain, dirt, chips and scratches inherent in the original camera negative are visible but not distracting.  Some scenes are softly focused but again, these are brief. The stereo soundtrack 2.0 is ample but scratchy in spots and strident with a slight hiss in others. No great shakes overall but still worth the price for those who truly love this tuneful, though at times top heavy, musical motion picture.

Boy, were we shortchanged Disney actually went out of their way to mess up this classic because the story is very self-explanatory.Annie (who is supposed to have curly red hair) is an orphan. Living in the home run by the tyranical Miss Hannigan, she dreams of being reunited with her parents who have left a note to someday return for their little girl. This is a fairly straight forward script, yet somehow Disney went out of their way to bungle it.Carol Burnett is a hard act to follow, but Kathy Bates (Miss Hannigan) is just way too wimpy and way too sober to be a big screen villan. Instead of being creepy, Bates was just annoying and looked like she also realized that this screenplay could have used better direction. She forgot that viewers are not supposed to like Miss Hannigan and she was supposed to be an evil lush.Grace Farrell, Oliver Warbucks personal secretary, was cast as an African American in this film. Disney's attempt at multiculturalism forgets that an anti-New Dealer conservative Republican such as Warbucks also would have absorbed the racial stereotypes of his day. Furthermore, that same play/movie character would not have declared his love for a black woman.One notable highlight is the original 'Annie' (from the 1977 stage production) Andrea McArdle belts out 'NYC'.

Instead, she is adopted for a week by billionaire Oliver Warbucks (Albert Finney) under the care of his secretary Grace (Ann Reinking). They fall in love with her and try to help her find her real parents who we find out are really dead. The orphan home's caretaker Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett), her criminal brother (Tim Curry), and his moll (Bernadette Peters) decide to impersonate Annie's parents to get the cash reward, but the orphans get wind and try to stop them.No other version compares to this one; the cast is outstanding. Quinn is appropriately innocent, but belies intelligence under her curly red hair. Burnett is wonderful as always, playing a personally triumphant part; her parents were both alcoholics. Curry plays a menace truthfully, and yet he's still a bit likable- at least in the beginning. Even Peters' role stands out; she was wonderful during this era. Although musicals tend to be a bit silly sometimes, this one straddles the fine line between fantasy and believability very well. Viewers of any age can find themselves enraptured in every bit of the story.And the music! It has really earned a place in Americana. Who doesn't know the hopeful song ""Tomorrow?"" The music has become so popular that even Jay-Z sampled ""Hard Knock Life."" Some of the lesser knowns are amazing as well. ""Little Girls"" features many clever lines. ""Let's Go to the Movies"" is very fun and serves as blanket praise for the classic movie era. ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" is catchy and wonderfully represents old time radio advertisement songs. ""Easy Street"" is tons of fun thanks to Burnett, Curry, and Peters and their comic performances.There are certainly flaws, the most glaring having to do with the time period. The opener hails the year: 1929. However, the film does not stick to that year. It includes Franklin D. Roosevelt as a character, and yet he was not elected president until 1932. Furthermore, the New Deal discussed in the film did not come about until 1933. Also, the film everyone goes to see in the theater is Camille from 1936. Even the most avoidable of mistakes occurs. In the beginning of the film, one learns that Annie is ten years old, but later, when reading her birth certificate, one learns that she was born in 1922. However, one with no interest in history could easily ignore these mistakes as they do not detract from the story.",4,Huge Part of My Childhood,1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,2539,"['now', 'everyone', 'probably', 'story', 'Annie', 'Aileen', 'Quinn', 'little', 'tomboy', 'who', 'real', 'parents', 'take', 'away', 'orphanage', 'Instead', 'adopted', 'week', 'billionaire', 'Oliver', 'Warbucks', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'care', 'secretary', 'Grace', 'Ann', 'Reinking', 'fall', 'love', 'try', 'help', 'find', 'real', 'parents', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'really', 'dead', 'orphan', 'home', 'caretaker', 'Miss', 'Hannigan', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'criminal', 'brother', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'moll', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'decide', 'impersonate', 'Annie', 'parents', 'get', 'cash', 'reward', 'orphans', 'get', 'wind', 'try', 'stop', 'them.No', 'other', 'version', 'one', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'Quinn', 'appropriately', 'innocent', 'belies', 'intelligence', 'curly', 'red', 'hair', 'Burnett', 'wonderful', 'always', 'playing', 'personally', 'triumphant', 'part', 'parents', 'were', 'alcoholics', 'Curry', 'menace', 'truthfully', 'yet', 'still', 'bit', 'likable-', 'least', 'beginning', 'Even', 'Peters', 'role', 'out', 'was', 'wonderful', 'era', 'musicals', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'silly', 'sometimes', 'one', 'fine', 'line', 'fantasy', 'believability', 'very', 'well', 'Viewers', 'age', 'can', 'find', 'enraptured', 'bit', 'story.And', 'music', 'really', 'earned', 'place', 'Americana', 'Who', ""n't"", 'know', 'hopeful', 'song', 'Tomorrow', 'music', 'become', 'so', 'popular', 'even', 'Jay-Z', 'sampled', 'Hard', 'Knock', 'Life', 'lesser', 'knowns', 'are', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'Little', 'Girls', 'many', 'clever', 'lines', 'Let', 'Go', 'Movies', 'very', 'fun', 'blanket', 'praise', 'classic', 'movie', 'era', ""'re"", 'Never', 'Fully', 'Dressed', 'Smile', 'catchy', 'wonderfully', 'old', 'time', 'radio', 'advertisement', 'songs', 'Easy', 'Street', 'tons', 'fun', 'thanks', 'Burnett', 'Curry', 'Peters', 'comic', 'performances.There', 'are', 'certainly', 'flaws', 'most', 'glaring', 'having', 'do', 'time', 'period', 'opener', 'year', '1929', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'stick', 'year', 'Franklin', 'D.', 'Roosevelt', 'character', 'yet', 'was', 'not', 'elected', 'president', '1932', 'Furthermore', 'New', 'Deal', 'discussed', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'come', '1933', 'Also', 'film', 'everyone', 'see', 'theater', 'Camille', '1936', 'Even', 'most', 'avoidable', 'mistakes', 'occurs', 'beginning', 'film', 'one', 'Annie', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'later', 'when', 'reading', 'birth', 'certificate', 'one', 'was', 'born', '1922', 'However', 'one', 'interest', 'history', 'could', 'easily', 'ignore', 'mistakes', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'story']",Annie

Miss Hannigan works the girls from dawn to dusk and locks them in the closet when they misbehave.  Living at the orphanage is pretty bad, but living on the street during the Great Depression is worse.  But Annie doesn't let her circumstances get her down, she knows that she has loving parents out there somewhere and she is determined to find them.  After getting caught escaping again, Miss Hannigan is determined to punish her, but Annie is rescued by Grace Farrell (Ann Reinking), Oliver Warbucks' (Albert Finney) private secretary.  Turns out that Mr. Warbucks hosts an orphan in his home every year and this year Grace decided that he needed to host a girl.  Mr. Warbucks soon finds his home and his life turned upside down by this lovable girl and her sunshiny disposition, but Annie still believes that her parents are out there somewhere and may give up her one chance at happiness to find them...This is by far my favorite version of Annie and I adore most of the songs that are in it.  It is true that they changed the story from the musical and left out a couple of songs, but they just kind of took out all of the political stuff, which most children wouldn't understand anyway.  Annie definitely has the feeling of the Great Depression era though, especially through the costumes, which are very dingy and dull looking.  However, the actors really sparkle in their roles and do a wonderful job.  My favorite is Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan - she is hysterically funny!  Tim Curry as Rooster and Bernadette Peters as Lily also have some great presence and were fun to watch.  It is true that the musical is cheesy and smarmy and all of that, but I love belting out the songs with the singers and always feel good after I watch this movie!",4,The Best Movie Version!,1075766400,"02 3, 2004",2004,1870,"['Annie', 'Aileen', 'Quinn', 'rundown', 'orphanage', 'managed', 'Miss', 'Hannigan', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'who', 'little', 'girls', 'Miss', 'Hannigan', 'girls', 'dawn', 'dusk', 'locks', 'closet', 'when', 'misbehave', 'Living', 'orphanage', 'pretty', 'bad', 'living', 'street', 'Great', 'Depression', 'worse', 'Annie', ""n't"", 'let', 'circumstances', 'get', 'down', 'loving', 'parents', 'there', 'somewhere', 'determined', 'find', 'getting', 'caught', 'escaping', 'again', 'Miss', 'Hannigan', 'determined', 'punish', 'Annie', 'rescued', 'Grace', 'Farrell', 'Ann', 'Reinking', 'Oliver', 'Warbucks', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'private', 'secretary', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Warbucks', 'orphan', 'home', 'year', 'year', 'Grace', 'decided', 'needed', 'host', 'girl', 'Mr.', 'Warbucks', 'soon', 'home', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'lovable', 'girl', 'sunshiny', 'disposition', 'Annie', 'still', 'parents', 'are', 'there', 'somewhere', 'may', 'give', 'up', 'one', 'chance', 'happiness', 'find', 'far', 'favorite', 'version', 'Annie', 'adore', 'most', 'songs', 'are', 'true', 'changed', 'story', 'musical', 'left', 'out', 'couple', 'songs', 'just', 'kind', 'took', 'out', 'political', 'stuff', 'most', 'children', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'anyway', 'Annie', 'definitely', 'feeling', 'Great', 'Depression', 'era', 'especially', 'costumes', 'are', 'very', 'dingy', 'dull', 'looking', 'However', 'actors', 'really', 'sparkle', 'roles', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'favorite', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Miss', 'Hannigan', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Rooster', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Lily', 'also', 'have', 'great', 'presence', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'true', 'musical', 'cheesy', 'smarmy', 'love', 'belting', 'out', 'songs', 'singers', 'always', 'feel', 'good', 'watch', 'movie']",Annie

I did see the1982 movie version (Annie (Special Anniversary Edition))on television.  Despite having some of my favorite people - Bernadette Peters and Carol Burnett among them - that version was a big disappointment.  Perhaps it was the poor choice of a director: while John Huston (for younger people, Angelica's dad) was one of the great Hollywood directors of all time, his background was primarily in dramatic and adventure films, and he also did a Western or two.  ANNIE was Huston's first (and last) musical, and it showed, to disastrous effect, which may have been why the film did less-than-stellar business at the box office.I saw this 1999 Disney version on ABC, and just recently purchased the DVD.  It is magnificent, and is everything the 1982 version was not, not only for the great songs and dances, but a marvelous cast: Victor Garber as Oliver ""Daddy"" Warbucks, Kathy Bates as the dastardly Miss Hannigan, Alicia Morton as Annie, Alan Cumming as the con artist Rooster (Miss Hannigan's brother), and two current favorites of mine: the adorable Kristin Chenoweth as Rooster's partner-in-crime Lily St. Regis, and the gorgeous Audra McDonald as Grace, Daddy Warbucks' secretary.  The original Broadway Annie, Andrea McArdle, makes a cameo appearance in the big production number, ""N.Y.C.,"" giving fans an added treat.Except for 5.0 surround sound and the WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY trailer, there are no DVD extras, but this is the version to buy, above all others.And now Will Smith wants to do a ""redux"" of this show for his daughter Willow (although I just found out that Willow has ""outgrown"" the role and will be replaced by the young Oscar-nominated actress, Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis).

He attempts to adopt the girl, but she has one thing on her mind: to find her real parents. When Warbucks announces that he will pay a lot of money to find Annie's mother and father a torrid scheme to milk money from the millionaire is hatched by the headmistress of the orphanage, played superbly by Kathy Bates.

She is quite stiff with her lines and the girl in the old one was much better at conveying emotion. Ms. Hannigan is also less mean and threatning.
