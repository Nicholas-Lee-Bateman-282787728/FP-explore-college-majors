Call me old-fashioned, but when a couple that has been divorced for two years ends up in bed together, that isn't my idea of family values, even if when their children discover them they all get a good laugh out of it. The mother's advice to her barely 16-yr. old daughter about sex left a lot to be desired, too. Basically she gives her daughter a green light as long as she thinks she is in love first. It could have been a nice family show, and if the things I've mentioned don't bother you, then you may enjoy it.
