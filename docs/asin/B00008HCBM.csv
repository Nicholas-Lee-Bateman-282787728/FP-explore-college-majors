742809,A3J9LLWHZH15HG,B00008HCBM,JJ,"[2, 3]","I had taped this movie, which was called God's New Plan, from a t.v. showing many years ago. Always went back and pulled that old VHS tape and looked at it because of the real pleasure it gave me. Decided to look on Amazon and there it was with a different name but obviously the same movie. Though Katie Sagal did a wonderful job in it I couldn't quite believe how he was supposed to have fallen so in love with her at first meeting as she isn't really a pretty woman. But, through her performance she was able to convince me that it had happened the way she said. Come to think of it, he is no Adonis is he. It's a wonderful story of the triumph of love over death. No horrible mean characters, no bratty, talk back kids, no ulterior motives.  It's the type of movie you can look at over and over again and always enjoy it. I thought this was an unusually good use of actors known only from t.v. shows.

742811,AOKIJQEO2DDNM,B00008HCBM,Little ol me,"[4, 5]","This was quite a tear jerker that's for sure.  Although I was a bit skeptical in the beginning with very poor acting and dialogue, it did pick up and get better along the way.The acting was just not there in my opinion.  Katey Segal is usually spot on with her characters, but it took a while for her to embrace this one and flow into it.  Her emotions were quite bland in the beginning when she is reminiscing about her childhood, and then when she finds out she is going to have a pre-term baby there was no emotion at all. She lays quietly on the gurney and stares at the ceiling. Doesn't cry at all. Having been in the position of a pre-term baby I could not understand why her character wasn't devastated or shocked at the thought.  I couldn't understand why her character didn't get emotional at two major life changing instances. 1)She has Cancer~AGAIN, 2)She is going to have to deliver her baby at 23 weeks.  Knowing either one of these were going to happen to me I would be a bit more emotional.Katey Segal behaves as if she has never had a baby in her life.  There was no convincing dialogue when it came to her pregnancy, or the reality that she was going to have a baby so early it may not even survive. At one point she casually tells her husband to get up she's bleeding. And when she goes to the bathroom it was monotone ""oh no. I'm bleeding."" Just matter of fact, no urgency, no emotion. She was not in touch with the pregnant part of her character at all.However, when her character is in pain from the cancer, walking with a walker, then weak and confined to bed, she really takes off and gets it.  It is at this moment when you need to reach for the tissue box.  When she is coming to terms with the reality of never seeing her family, husband, baby, etc. again, she is most convincing and it really hits home and pulls at your heart.The movie basically rolls along slowly as you follow this woman through her daily routine of having a premature baby.  Taking care of this baby in the hospital for months. Her cancer diagnosis. Her plan of attack on the cancer. Her acceptance of death and planning for it.She is not forced into giving her husband to her nurse, the nurse and her family just happened to have formed a close bond while caring for her premature baby for so long in the hospital in which the nurse works.  So they truly see the nurse everyday and build a relationship together with her.  It is when she is diagnosed with cancer and told to prepare for her death that she starts thinking of the possible future her husband could have with the caring and nurturing nurse. She sees that the nurse cares for her daughter as much as she does, and could easily replace her as a mother. Her main concern is giving a mother to her daughter.  Finding a woman who can give her husband what he needs as well is a bonus to the situation.At times the film is awkwardly written and it lags quite a bit.  The story isn't really that great, it is just a touching and sensitive subject that stirs your emotions.  It is a depressing movie that can bring you down, and I cannot imagine watching it very often for pleasure since it is so emotionally draining. It does say it is based on a true story, but they don't give you any history or follow up at the end that would connect you to the story better.  I like knowing more about the family the movie is based on when they say it is based on a true story.  I like the connection and the association between the real person and the character the actor is portraying.  It would be a nice addition to the dvd extras area.Brian Young who portrays the husband has his moments of good acting, but then a majority of the time he is just not with it convincingly enough. The same goes for Annabeth Gish.  She is good at times, but the three actors together do not have a cohesive bond or the convincing comradery that you would like to see and feel.  It just always felt like something was missing.Overall it isn't a movie for kids since they would be extremely bored and possibly confused over the cancer and death topic of the story. It is older and a bit dated.I think if it was on TV it would be a good one to grab for the night.",3,Invest in A Box of Kleenex Before Watching!,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,4191,"['was', 'quite', 'tear', 'jerker', 'sure', 'was', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'beginning', 'very', 'poor', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'did', 'pick', 'up', 'get', 'better', 'way.The', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'opinion', 'Katey', 'Segal', 'usually', 'spot', 'characters', 'took', 'while', 'embrace', 'one', 'flow', 'emotions', 'were', 'quite', 'bland', 'beginning', 'when', 'reminiscing', 'childhood', 'then', 'when', 'going', 'have', 'pre-term', 'baby', 'was', 'emotion', 'quietly', 'gurney', 'stares', 'ceiling', ""n't"", 'cry', 'Having', 'been', 'position', 'pre-term', 'baby', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'devastated', 'shocked', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'emotional', 'two', 'major', 'life', 'changing', 'instances', '1', 'Cancer~AGAIN', '2', 'going', 'have', 'deliver', 'baby', '23', 'weeks', 'Knowing', 'one', 'were', 'going', 'happen', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'emotional.Katey', 'Segal', 'behaves', 'never', 'had', 'baby', 'life', 'was', 'convincing', 'dialogue', 'when', 'came', 'pregnancy', 'reality', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'baby', 'so', 'early', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'survive', 'one', 'point', 'casually', 'husband', 'get', 'up', 'bleeding', 'when', 'bathroom', 'was', 'monotone', 'oh', ""'m"", 'bleeding', 'Just', 'matter', 'fact', 'urgency', 'emotion', 'was', 'not', 'touch', 'pregnant', 'part', 'character', 'all.However', 'when', 'character', 'pain', 'cancer', 'walking', 'walker', 'then', 'weak', 'confined', 'bed', 'really', 'moment', 'when', 'need', 'reach', 'tissue', 'box', 'When', 'coming', 'terms', 'reality', 'never', 'seeing', 'family', 'husband', 'baby', 'etc', 'again', 'most', 'convincing', 'really', 'home', 'pulls', 'heart.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'along', 'slowly', 'follow', 'woman', 'daily', 'routine', 'having', 'premature', 'baby', 'Taking', 'care', 'baby', 'hospital', 'months', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'plan', 'attack', 'cancer', 'acceptance', 'death', 'planning', 'it.She', 'not', 'forced', 'giving', 'husband', 'nurse', 'nurse', 'family', 'just', 'happened', 'have', 'formed', 'close', 'bond', 'caring', 'premature', 'baby', 'so', 'long', 'hospital', 'nurse', 'truly', 'see', 'nurse', 'everyday', 'build', 'relationship', 'together', 'when', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'told', 'prepare', 'death', 'thinking', 'possible', 'future', 'husband', 'could', 'have', 'caring', 'nurturing', 'nurse', 'nurse', 'cares', 'daughter', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'easily', 'replace', 'mother', 'main', 'concern', 'giving', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Finding', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'give', 'husband', 'what', 'as', 'well', 'bonus', 'situation.At', 'film', 'awkwardly', 'written', 'quite', 'bit', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'great', 'just', 'touching', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'emotions', 'depressing', 'movie', 'can', 'bring', 'down', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'watching', 'very', 'often', 'pleasure', 'so', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'say', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'history', 'follow', 'up', 'end', 'would', 'connect', 'story', 'better', 'knowing', 'more', 'family', 'movie', 'based', 'when', 'say', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'connection', 'association', 'real', 'person', 'character', 'actor', 'portraying', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'addition', 'dvd', 'extras', 'area.Brian', 'Young', 'who', 'husband', 'moments', 'good', 'acting', 'then', 'majority', 'time', 'just', 'not', 'convincingly', 'enough', 'same', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'good', 'times', 'three', 'actors', 'together', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'cohesive', 'bond', 'convincing', 'comradery', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'feel', 'just', 'always', 'felt', 'something', 'was', 'missing.Overall', ""n't"", 'movie', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'bored', 'possibly', 'confused', 'cancer', 'death', 'topic', 'story', 'older', 'bit', 'dated.I', 'think', 'was', 'TV', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'grab', 'night']",No Higher Love
