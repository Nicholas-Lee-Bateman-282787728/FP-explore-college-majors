1069404,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,B000PATZJW,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[0, 0]","Funny man Eddie Murphy tackles a big role in ""Norbit"" - literally. That is of course Rasputia, an obese woman with a whole lot of attitude. As in previous Eddie Murphy films, multiple roles are played by Murphy. The title-character Norbit, a meek man who gets more than he bargained for when at age 10 he is rescued from bullies by 10 year old Rasputia, and Mr. Wong, Norbit's ""father"" at the adoption center.After giving a quick and often funny insight to Norbit's young life, the film kicks off with Norbit and Rasputia's wedding ceremony, then delves into the complications that arise in their lives as Norbit's childhood sweetheart Kate (Thandie Newton) moves back into the neighbourhood to by the orphanage - which is also what Rasputia's powerful brothers want to do. Norbit also disapproves of Kate's fianc&eacute;e Deion (Cuba Gooding Jr).While Norbit is an enjoyable thing, there is an awful lot going on, which is not a bad thing, just a tad distracting at times. The acting is pretty good all-round, especially from Murphy, in all three of his roles. Eddie Griffin is hilarious as Pope Sweet Jesus. Pat Crawford Brown (from ""Depserate Housewives"") has a small but memorable role, and Laura Ortiz (from the Hilsl Have Eyes remake) has a blink and you'll miss her part.There may be some who may get offended at ""Norbit"", perhaps thinking that it makes fun of fat people, but really, Rasputia's weight is hardly made fun at. Rasputia is incredibly funny in a trailer-trash kind of way. Most of the laughs I got came from her, however some of the comedy in ""Norbit"" is not that funny, but it's still an enjoyable film.",3,"Moments of hilarity, moments of eye-rolling",1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,1625,"['Funny', 'man', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'big', 'role', 'Norbit', 'literally', 'course', 'Rasputia', 'obese', 'woman', 'whole', 'lot', 'attitude', 'previous', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'films', 'multiple', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'Murphy', 'title-character', 'Norbit', 'meek', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'age', '10', 'rescued', 'bullies', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Rasputia', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'Norbit', 'father', 'adoption', 'center.After', 'giving', 'quick', 'often', 'funny', 'insight', 'Norbit', 'young', 'life', 'film', 'off', 'Norbit', 'Rasputia', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'then', 'complications', 'arise', 'lives', 'Norbit', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Kate', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'back', 'neighbourhood', 'orphanage', 'also', 'what', 'Rasputia', 'powerful', 'brothers', 'want', 'do', 'Norbit', 'also', 'Kate', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Deion', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', '.While', 'Norbit', 'enjoyable', 'thing', 'awful', 'lot', 'going', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'tad', 'distracting', 'times', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'all-round', 'especially', 'Murphy', 'three', 'roles', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'hilarious', 'Pope', 'Sweet', 'Jesus', 'Pat', 'Crawford', 'Brown', 'Depserate', 'Housewives', 'small', 'memorable', 'role', 'Laura', 'Ortiz', 'Hilsl', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'remake', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'part.There', 'may', 'be', 'who', 'may', 'get', 'offended', 'Norbit', 'perhaps', 'thinking', 'fun', 'fat', 'people', 'really', 'Rasputia', 'weight', 'hardly', 'made', 'fun', 'Rasputia', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'trailer-trash', 'kind', 'way', 'Most', 'laughs', 'got', 'came', 'however', 'comedy', 'Norbit', 'not', 'funny', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'film']",N/A

After a little over an hour, I just had to jet from all this onscreen ignorance. Here's why.In fairness, there are a few good things about this movie. The early business about Norbit and the little girl who grows up to be his true love is rather sweet. The ""kiddie Wedding"" seen is one of the few things that I saw that brought a smile to my face.But this mess with ""Rasputia"" (this is enough to start Cold War II with the Russians once they get wind of this) and Eddie as the outrageously stereotyped Chinese orpphanage owner (""Norbit, you marry gorilla"" is his comment about Rasputia) takes the movie on long downhill slide through the cinematic commode. It's bad enough Norbit is mistreated so badly thatyou go beyond feeling sorry for him (granted, this is a ""leave your brains at the door"" flick), but Eddie as the hefty female ""Rasputia"" takes drag comedy to NEW lows.""She"" takes great pleasure in ""her"" flatuence and using ""her"" breasts to drive the steering wheel (trust me, you  don't want to imaginge this). ""She"" also makes ""love"" to Norbit (bring on the Pepto Bismol again) and worst of all, Norbit catches ""her"" in bed with one of the Wayans brothers (their presence alone indicates the low level of ""comedy"" here) and ""SHE"" has the gall to get angry at Norbit, leading into a wild chase scene.At this point, I had to hang on to my brain cells and digestive system, so I bid my friends at the theater adios and went home to read a book.Comparing this with his stellar performance as the faux ""Godfather"" James Thunder early in ""Dreamgirls,"" Eddie Murphy has gone from sugar tos(omething else). Folks, do not waste your precious time, money, or brain cells on this cinematic equivalent to Khia and Gilligan's Island.

Also the second funniest scene was where Rasputia goes down the waterslide, creates a mini tsunami, and splahes almost everyone in the park.In the movie most of the audience is cheering for Norbit (Eddie Murphy) to get together with Kate (Thandie Newton) and leave him big angry overgrown wife Rasputia who is a domineering negative force in Norbit's life. You have to see the movie to see if Norbit is man enough to leave Rasputia without getting crushed and beaten up.I had a hard time getting my mind around how Eddie Murphy could play 3 completely different characters (Mr. Wong, Norbit, and the obese Rasputia).

I liked his SNL skits such as ""Mr Rogers Neighborhhod"" and his excellent early movies like ""Trading Places. But most of all I loved his often crude but always hilarious stand up routine. The album that included ""Ice Cream Man"" is my all time favorite comedy record. There are other comics, like Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce, that may be considered more important in terms of social commentary. But, for me, Murphy is the king of funny and when it comes to comedy funny is what it's all about.Norbit is not an Oscar winner. But rather the simple story of a nerd named Norbit. He is trapped in an unhappy marriage to the obese and ugly Rasputia. But when his childhood sweetheart, Kate, returns he finds the courage to begin a new life. Sure there is alot of gross out humor and this might not be the best movie to take children to. But hey funny is funny and watching Rasputia shoot down a water slide is flat out funny.

Not content with preaching to the local crowd Armstrong took her crusade against the film nationally.  The critics followed in lockstep by almost universally panning the film.  Shortly thereafter Eddie Murphy was snubbed by the Academy for his supporting role in ""Dreamgirls"".  Just recently on the Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais was taking jabs at ""Norbit"".  Having finally seen the film I will say that ""Norbit"" is side-splittingly funny from start to finish.  Not sporadically funny but consistently funny.  Murphy payed homage to his idol, Jerry Lewis, with his reimagining of ""The Nutty Professor"".  Murphy not only pays tribute  to Lewis but I see a little of the influence of Alec Guiness and Peter Sellers by successfully tackling multiple roles.  As impressive as Rick Baker's makeup effects are Murphy probably could have handled all three roles sans the synthetics.  There's a terrific supporting cast on hand notably Eddie Griffin as a wannabe pimp and Marlon Wayans as a randy dance instructor.

1069436,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000PATZJW,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 5]","It's too bad that the daggers have come flying against Eddie Murphy for this 2007 farce because he is masterfully funny in no less than three roles here. Resuscitating an even dimmer variation of the good-natured goofus he played in 1999's clever ""Bowfinger"", Murphy plays the title character, a compliant loser left as a baby on the doorstep of a roadside Chinese restaurant owned by a curmudgeon named Mr. Chow, also played by Murphy with more of a pan-Asian accent under a convincing veneer of latex.As a child, he falls in love with fellow orphan Kate, but she gets adopted and moves away. That's when Rasputia enters the picture. A mean-spirited overweight girl, she bullies Norbit to go steady with her, and he ends up miserably marrying her when they both grow up. And if you don't know already, Murphy, under a humungous fat latex suit, also plays Rasputia. Kate comes back to town as a comely woman with the idea of buying Mr. Chow's restaurant and turning it into an orphanage. The inevitable romantic complications occur, as well as a silly, threadbare plot involving Rasputia's musclebound brothers, Kate's smooth-talking fianc&eacute; Deion and turning Mr. Chow's place into a strip club.None of the plot contrivances really interfere with the parade of sight gags, mostly at the expense of Rasputia, whether she accuses Norbit of adjusting her car seat forward or wears a disappearing bikini at the water park. Based on a YouTube video they saw where a large woman beats down her smaller-sized husband in front of the neighbors, Murphy with his brother Charles developed a story fleshed out by comedy screenwriters Jay Scherick and David Ronn, and the resulting script meanders quite a bit, especially with the strip club subplot and the various ensuing love triangles. Much of it is vulgar and tasteless, but when the story focuses on Murphy's antics and one-liners, it's often hilarious and surprisingly self-aware of its own insensitivities. What's left of the plot goes into incredulous overdrive at the end, but it certainly doesn't lose its spirit.With the childhood vignettes at the beginning, I was expecting a Forrest Gump-like epic of a savant, but it quickly turns formulaic and situation-driven, which is what ultimately prevents the film from being great. Brian Robbins' direction is pedestrian at best, but his sitcom-based sensibilities seem to work within the dimensions of Murphy's broad style. A dewy-eyed Thandie Newton is engaging as Kate, but Cuba Gooding Jr. is wasted as Deion since he is developed as a mere plot device. Eddie Griffin and Kat Williams manage some funny moments as a couple of pimps-turned-rib joint owners, especially in the finale, and Marlon Wayans turns up as a flamboyant tap dance instructor manipulating Rasputia for her money.

I was off base in thinking that since they loved Eddie Murphy playing five hilarious characters in The Nutty Professor, they'd be just as impressed with Norbit.  I was totally wrong.  From the opening scene when infant Norbit is literally THROWN from a moving vehicle and rolls like a football to the doorstep of his future orphanage, right down to the way Rasputia and her bully brothers violently treat everyone, there is absolutely nothing in this film for children to genuinely enjoy.  There are blatant racist comments along with everything else not meant for young viewers.  Laughing at the hilarity of trying to squeeze into a small vehicle, or slide down the wet slope at the water park is good clean fun, but the line was crossed for us when we watched the expression on our kid's faces as Rasputia deliberately ran down a neighbor's dog with her speeding vehicle, rendering him crippled.  It was just plain cruel, and we were amazed that Murphy found a place for these kinds of scenes in this movie.  The orphanage is supposedly in danger of becoming a strip club, and there are frequent references to pimping, which I thought could have been easily avoided and replaced with a business such as a fast food chain or a video store.  By comparison, my kids totally enjoy watching Big Momma's House and though Martin Lawrence can be raunchy in some of his other films, Big Momma I and II are not offensive or overly violent or cruel.

Norbit's sad life is trucking along until he discovers his wife's infidelity and the return of his childhood sweetheart - these events make him realize that he wants & deserves true love & happiness.The supporting cast of Thandie Newton, Eddie Griffin, Kat Williams, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Terry Crews and Marlon Wayans as the ""power tap guru"" definitely worked well off of Eddie's ""characters"".Frankly, several members of my family have questioned my taste level after learning how much I enjoy this movie but I just tell them ""different strokes for different folks"" and keep it moving.

It's a funny line even if they did steal it from Joey from Friends.When I watch a comedy, the only requirement I have is that it be funny. That's it. I'm not one of those intellectual movie snobs who think only ""comedies"" like Dr. Strangelove is worthy of my time.The story of Norbit was a very interesting one that kept my attention the entire time; and it made me laugh. Therefore, Norbit is a success.The film is not perfect by any means. I question the casting choice of Thandie Newton, and you also can't help but see Eddie Murphy as recycling his past roles from The Nutty Professor. Murphy is coasting at this point in his career. Of course, he no longer has anything else to prove. He did enough good things in the 80s to last him a lifetime: although, I do wonder where that Eddie Murphy went.We can't discuss Norbit without discussing the thing that many find offensive: the portrayal of the overweight character as evil and the thin, ""beautiful woman"" as good. Well, it was Rasputia's attitude that made her the bad guy, not her size. But then, some people ask, why make her fat at all if it's only about her attitude. Well, it's simple; Rasputia uses her size to intimidate people. I find it very hard to believe that a tiny woman like say, Toni Braxton, could have instilled fear in those around her the way Rasputia did. And it's her meanness and ability to physically intimidate people that acts as the essential part of humor for her character and the film.I also have to give a shout out to Marlon Wayans. I had no idea he played Buster until the end credits. I'm starting to believe he is the most talented Wayans. He does comedy better than Damon, and he can do drama better than, well Damon.If the movie is a little too mean spirited for you, and you want to see the big girl get the guy rather than lose him, I recommend Shallow Hal.",3,Phat,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,1869,"['How', 'YOU', 'doin', 'funny', 'line', 'even', 'did', 'steal', 'Joey', 'Friends.When', 'watch', 'comedy', 'only', 'requirement', 'have', 'be', 'funny', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'intellectual', 'movie', 'snobs', 'who', 'think', 'only', 'comedies', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'worthy', 'time.The', 'story', 'Norbit', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'one', 'kept', 'attention', 'entire', 'time', 'made', 'Therefore', 'Norbit', 'success.The', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'means', 'question', 'casting', 'choice', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'see', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'recycling', 'past', 'roles', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'Murphy', 'coasting', 'point', 'career', 'course', 'no', 'longer', 'anything', 'else', 'prove', 'did', 'enough', 'good', 'things', '80s', 'last', 'lifetime', 'do', 'wonder', 'where', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'went.We', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'Norbit', 'discussing', 'thing', 'many', 'find', 'offensive', 'portrayal', 'overweight', 'character', 'evil', 'thin', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'good', 'Well', 'was', 'Rasputia', 'attitude', 'made', 'bad', 'guy', 'not', 'size', 'then', 'people', 'ask', 'why', 'make', 'fat', 'only', 'attitude', 'Well', 'simple', 'Rasputia', 'size', 'intimidate', 'people', 'find', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'tiny', 'woman', 'say', 'Toni', 'Braxton', 'could', 'have', 'instilled', 'fear', 'way', 'Rasputia', 'did', 'meanness', 'ability', 'physically', 'intimidate', 'people', 'essential', 'part', 'humor', 'character', 'film.I', 'also', 'have', 'give', 'shout', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'had', 'idea', 'played', 'Buster', 'end', ""'m"", 'starting', 'believe', 'most', 'talented', 'Wayans', 'comedy', 'better', 'Damon', 'can', 'do', 'drama', 'better', 'well', 'Damon.If', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'mean', 'spirited', 'want', 'see', 'big', 'girl', 'get', 'guy', 'rather', 'lose', 'recommend', 'Shallow', 'Hal']",N/A

Much like he did in Coming to America, he is playing a large diversity of roles in this movie.  Not only is he Norbit, but he is Norbit's wife, his adoptive father, the man cheating with his wife, and others.Eddie Murphy, the biggest box office producer (Norbit and Shrek 3 put him past Tom Hanks for #1), is always a treat to watch.  What is really amazing is how it is hard to pick him out of the character of actors.  He is funny and very comfortable in front of a camera.  His acting does not disappoint in this movie in all of the roles.Like Martin Lawrence's Big Momma's House and somewhat like his own role in Nutty Professor, there is a lot of time where the skinny Eddie Murphy is stuck in the body suit of a large woman.  But this movie has taken it to a whole new level.  While you could tell Lawrence was in a body suit (which you were supposed to), it was actually difficult to tell that Eddie was wearing a suit.  There was even a lot (too much?) screen time where Laticia was at a water park in a bathing suit and it was very hard to tell  that you weren't looking at flesh.  This is not only a credit to the way Eddie moved but to the costume designers.The only thing lacking in this movie was a good script.  The writers wanted to focus too much on the gross-out humor and forgot to tell a good story.  Some of the content was too over the top and there were a lot of missed opportunities to have some fun with one of the best comedic actors of our time, Eddie Murphy.I checked this movie out on HD-DVD.  Some HD-DVD movies lack picture quality or there are some scenes that aren't produced in high definition quality but the quality was fantastic all the way through this movie.  If you have an HD-DVD player make sure you pick this up in HD.  It is well worth any extra effort or money to do so.This movie is most definitely a rental.

1069448,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000PATZJW,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[0, 0]","Well admittedly the movie does deliver a few half decent laughs, and if I'm honest at times this is quite an entertaining movie. The scene at the water park with Rasputia along with the bathing suit joke was quite funny. The movie also at times gets a great dark streak at times but it's also quite funny. To say Eddie Murphy is not entertaining at all would be a complete lie. If Murphy does anything good its doing his fast talk in a fat suit. And with Rasputia he manages to pull that off almost perfectly. The character of Rasputia isn't brilliant, but she's bearable and quite amusing at times. Murphy gives his all in that role, and also does quite a good, if slightly racist performance, as Mr. Wong. Unfortunately I was very against the role of Mr Wong due to the racism in his scenes.So where does Norbit go wrong? Well while the jokes manage to be alright, the main romance and actual storyline is as dull as hell. Whenever Rasputia is off screen you really could not care less about the rest of the movie. Matters are not even remotely helped by the fact that Norbit is an extremely boring and irritating character. His relationship with Thandie Newton's Kate is just boring. It tries to aim at touching but it seems so unrealistic and forced it feels more ludicrous than touching. The movies biggest mistake is when it decides to focus purely on their relationship with Rasputia popping in for brief periods of times. This is the middle section, and the movie is dragged down to almost rock bottom. The middle section is dangerously boring, its in that moment my eyes wandered from the screen on many occasions. Thankfully the story picks up slightly before the end, but the movie had already bored me long before the ending.The supporting cast of the movie cannot help matters either, Thandie Newton is pretty bland. A shame as she's by no means a bad actress and I think with a better script and perhaps a role that demanded more than existing she might have done well. However she has nothing to work with and seems more bored by the whole thing. Cuba Gooding Jr does what he always does, a bland and attempts to be funny performance that just goes alongside his other hideously bad recent performances. The three brothers of Rasputia are all as bad as each other, they're meant to be the main villains, yet they're just too forgettable. In fact if you take out Eddie Murphy as Rasputia this movie suffers terribly, if Murphy hadn't have played her this movie might have even struggled a bottom rating, with her the movie does sort of redeem itself.Overall Norbit is an occasionally fun, but all too boring and forgettable experience. Eddie Murphy does a good performance as Rasputia, but the rest of the cast are floundering around him. It could have been a movie to rival The Nutty Professor, but a half hearted script and an extremely dull romance make the movie just another cheap attempt at a comedy.",3,"[2.5]--As they said on Saturday Night Live: ""A star is falling.

I admit that yes it is a bad movie though but....an entertaining bad movie. The make-up for the characters for one is  bad. Just like with the Wayne Brothers in White Chicks, Rasputia looks more like a monster than she looks like an humanbeing. I can't really picture anyone that looks like Norbit either. He looks a little like Bill Cosby but with an alien shaped head.Also the fact that Rasputia also acts like a monster can take the fun out of the movie. There's not a charming thing about her and she's shown way too much. She's mean and scary and it's hard to sit through watching this woman get her way through most the movie. But in a way that also works since this woman is so horrible that it makes you root for Norbit to toughen up and not take it any more. Eddie Murphy doesn't give his best performance at all as Norbit or Rasputia but his performance as Mr. Wong is a little clever I admit. As Norbit he's just pretty weird and his voice is similar to Jimmy from South Park. Yet he still manages to be a little likeable since you feel for him for having to be married to the most evil heavy woman ever.

Eddie Murphy is Norbit, Rasputia and Mr. Wong, which I didn't catch on until later on in the movie.  Yep, he's that good.Orphanage life is all that Norbit knows, raised by the Asian Mr. Wong.  Once his best friend, Kate, has been adopted, life for Norbit has become hell.  Soon, chunky Rasputia enters the pictures and declares herself as Norbit's girlfriend.Life is supposed to get better as you get older, eh?  Well, not for Norbit, he ends up stuck getting married to Rasputia, along with her 3 brothers.  They all own a construction company.  Unknown to Norbit, the brothers wants to buy out the orphanage for their own illegal purposes.  However, Mr. Wong is having none of it.Well, soon enters Kate, Norbit's childhood friend, along with her fiance, Deion.  Kate wants to buy the orphanage and continue the business.  However, her fiance has another purpose for this building and is soon in cahoots with Rasputia's 3 brothers.Meanwhile, Norbit is torn between his loveless marriage to Rasputia and his lifelong love for Kate.Rasputia cracks me up.  She's this huge gal who doesn't give a flying fig about what anyone thinks of her.  She's this ""little princess"" who gets what and when she wants.Once again, this was a funny movie.

If you happen to find that sort of thing funny, you will probably think the rest of the movie is a hoot and a holler.Norbit is the unfortunate projectile infant, and he lands on the doorstep of a Chinese restaurant/orphanage run by a Mr. Wong (played by Murphy).  Young Norbit grows up into a mealy-mouthed and dull-spirited boy who sports a tap-water spine and glasses that appear to have been inspired by the Hubble telescope.  Murphy's sole characterization for Norbit is a mouth that is stretched and flattened in some kind of perpetual grimace.  (You might find a similar grimace on your face halfway through this clumsy comedy.)As Norbit ages, he becomes unlikely friends with a hefty and hideous woman named Rasputia (Murphy, again), emphasis on the word ""unlikely.""  The reasons why such a selfish and vain woman would befriend and marry such a stupid and unintersting fellow aren't ever satisfactorily explained.  (Not much in the movie is, really.  Why, for example, are we supposed to sympathize with Norbit?  Simply because he is put upon?)With time, Norbit rediscovers an old lost love, Kate (the beautiful Thandie Newton), a close friend from his earliest days in the orphanage.  Because they grew up together as toddlers, they are, obviously, meant for each other.  Right?  Right?  *sigh*  Anyway, Kate begins to fall for Norbit, in spite of his wholesale lack of any appeal, and thus we have our central conflict: love lost, love found, love unfulfilled.Add to the mix a cheating and lying boyfriend (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), bad guys who want to turn an orphanage into a strip club, endless fat jokes, an interrupted wedding, and many delightful misunderstandings, and you've got every comedy cliche in the book, standing upright, mugging shamelessly, and waddling around.Murphy shows off his chops (and let's admit it, the guy can act) and does so in a style that by now has become a sort of convention for him -- the multiple characters.  If there's anything good about ""Norbit,"" it is that the movie very quickly helps you forget that you're watching the same man play three different roles.  The special effects are pretty phenomenal, actually, with Wong, Norbit, and Rasputia interacting seamlessly in more than a few scenes.  This viewer had to remind himself that he was watching the ballet of computer generated manipulation.But a superb technical accomplishment is no substitute for the laughs this film fails to provide.  Norbit's pimp friend (Eddie Griffin) is good for a chuckle now and then, but the rest of the movie is just smug mockery, artful maliciousness, and one lame duck gag after another, all of it buried under pounds and pounds of artificial fat.",2,Another Beached Whale,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,2792,"['opening', 'scene', 'Norbit', 'first', 'thing', 'happen', 'swaddled', 'baby', 'tossed', 'moving', 'car', 'happen', 'find', 'sort', 'thing', 'funny', 'will', 'probably', 'think', 'rest', 'movie', 'hoot', 'holler.Norbit', 'unfortunate', 'projectile', 'infant', 'doorstep', 'Chinese', 'restaurant/orphanage', 'run', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'played', 'Murphy', 'Young', 'Norbit', 'up', 'mealy-mouthed', 'dull-spirited', 'boy', 'who', 'sports', 'tap-water', 'spine', 'glasses', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'Hubble', 'telescope', 'Murphy', 'sole', 'characterization', 'Norbit', 'mouth', 'stretched', 'flattened', 'kind', 'perpetual', 'grimace', 'might', 'find', 'similar', 'grimace', 'face', 'halfway', 'clumsy', 'comedy', 'Norbit', 'ages', 'unlikely', 'friends', 'hefty', 'hideous', 'woman', 'named', 'Rasputia', 'Murphy', 'again', 'emphasis', 'word', 'unlikely', 'reasons', 'why', 'selfish', 'vain', 'woman', 'would', 'befriend', 'marry', 'such', 'stupid', 'unintersting', 'fellow', 'are', ""n't"", 'ever', 'satisfactorily', 'explained', 'Not', 'much', 'movie', 'really', 'Why', 'example', 'are', 'supposed', 'sympathize', 'Norbit', 'Simply', 'put', 'time', 'Norbit', 'old', 'lost', 'love', 'Kate', 'beautiful', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'close', 'friend', 'earliest', 'days', 'orphanage', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'toddlers', 'are', 'obviously', 'meant', 'other', 'Right', 'Right', '*sigh*', 'Anyway', 'Kate', 'fall', 'Norbit', 'spite', 'wholesale', 'lack', 'appeal', 'thus', 'have', 'central', 'conflict', 'love', 'lost', 'love', 'found', 'love', 'unfulfilled.Add', 'mix', 'cheating', 'lying', 'boyfriend', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'want', 'turn', 'orphanage', 'strip', 'club', 'endless', 'fat', 'jokes', 'interrupted', 'wedding', 'many', 'delightful', 'misunderstandings', ""'ve"", 'got', 'comedy', 'cliche', 'book', 'standing', 'upright', 'mugging', 'shamelessly', 'waddling', 'around.Murphy', 'shows', 'off', 'chops', 'let', 'admit', 'guy', 'can', 'act', 'so', 'style', 'now', 'become', 'sort', 'convention', 'multiple', 'characters', 'anything', 'good', 'Norbit', 'movie', 'very', 'quickly', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'same', 'man', 'play', 'three', 'different', 'roles', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'phenomenal', 'actually', 'Wong', 'Norbit', 'Rasputia', 'interacting', 'seamlessly', 'more', 'few', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'had', 'remind', 'was', 'watching', 'ballet', 'computer', 'generated', 'superb', 'technical', 'accomplishment', 'substitute', 'laughs', 'film', 'provide', 'Norbit', 'pimp', 'friend', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'good', 'chuckle', 'now', 'then', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'smug', 'mockery', 'artful', 'maliciousness', 'one', 'lame', 'duck', 'gag', 'buried', 'pounds', 'pounds', 'artificial', 'fat']",N/A

1069474,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000PATZJW,Mike Zimmerman,"[1, 4]","After being abandoned as a child, Norbit finds solace at the Chinese Food and Orphanage shop, runned by the eccentric Mr. Wong (Eddie Murphy). While an outcast among most of the other kids, only one of them, Kate, is accepting of him. Sadly, both are adopted and are forced to go their seperate ways. Now Norbit (Eddie Murphy) lives with a crime synicate family (featuring Terry Crews and Clifton Powell), and is married to another, Rasputia (Eddie Murphy). Things go well, but when Norbit catches Rasputia in bed with her yoga instructor (Marlon Wayans), he makes an attempt to leave, but to no avail. Eventually, he runs into his former friend (Thandie Newton), who is now to be married to Deion (Cuba Gooding Jr). That doesn't stop them from growing closer, and when Rasputia finds out, she plans to find ways to keep Norbit from finding happiness.After coming off an Golden Globe winning turn in the overwhelmingly overrated ""Dreamgirls"" (don't get me wrong, I loved the movie; it just robbed a potential Golden Globe win for Jack Nicholson as Best Supporting Actor), the once again famous Eddie Murphy returns back to his comedy roots. Curiously enough, he reteamed with his ""Daddy Day Care"" director Brian Robbins. Anyone who remembered that movie knew what a piece of crap it was.With that said, Robbins switched gears to ""The Nutty Professor""-esque cross-dressing comedy. Murphy now plays three characters: the easily intimidated nerd (Norbit), the overwhelming fat lady (Rasputia), and the racist Chinese store owner (Mr. Wong). While this movie isn't as big a gut buster as ""Professor"", I'd be lying if I didn't find the whole concoction so damn irresistable.I'll begin with the bad news, just because I feel like it. ""Norbit"" is charming, but thrown all over the place. Robbins throws in a subplot about Norbit's stepfathers trying to turn Mr. Wong's orphanage into an XXX club, but it's crammed in between scenes where Norbit and Kate are bonding, or when Norbit has to deal with Rasputia. Maybe it's me, but I could've dealt without this, even if it had well intentions.Then there's a subplot involving Marlon Wayans' character that gets into bed with Rasputia during the first part of the movie. While Marlon does as much as he can (despite some CW-esque jokes thrown in there), his character isn't that memorable and leaves the movie like that with no reason why. It would've been cool if the movie ended with Rasputia and Buster living happily ever after, but I guess those weren't the director's intentions.Cuba Gooding Jr. doesn't bring much to the table. In my opinion, if Cuba does comedy, he is able to come out of the hailstorm like a survivor (like in ""Rat Race"" and ""Boat Trip""). And his role as Kate's fiance would've been a cherry bomb explosion of comic goodness, as he would've chewed the scenery at times. Sadly, Cuba looks lost and plays Deion as a nice guy, even when he sides with the hoods to take over the orphanage.Still, that does not hamper the fact that there are hidden treasures inside what could've been a colossal waste of 110 minutes. Murphy's sense of adventure has returned full force, and it shows as he embodies three characters. He channels his performance as Sherman Klump from ""The Nutty Professor"" for his role as Norbit, who gets our sympathy when he professes his true feelings to Kate while the two practice wedding vows; scenes like that alone are surprisingly heartwarming, never overwhelmingly mawkish. For Rasputia and Mr. Wong, Murphy's patented comedy agenda comes into play, literally disappearing into the characters, and gets the lion's share of laughs.Probably the most memorable characters are Pope Sweet Jesus and Lord Have Mercy, two multi-taskers who keep the ho's in check and run a restaurant. Played with kindergardener-eseque glee by comedians Eddie Griffin and Katt Williams, they manage to chew the scenery and have a show-stopping musical performance at the end. The latter scene alone is worth another batch of brownie points.As the movie reaches its ending, Robbins picks up the pace to have a slapstick battle royale between Norbit and Rasputia. Sans a lame Teddy Castelluci-type score behind it (no surprise, composer David Newman's tunes are very similar), the energetic scene has Rasputia attempting karate moves with a shovel and an old lady with kitty nunchucks. While it overstays its welcome, the sheer giddiness is the cherry on top on an entertaining, if slight, Murphy comedy.

Rasputia finds out and plans to destroy their union.Eddie Murphy mastered playing the different characters starting with Coming To America.

Ok so there were some funny parts in it, but just like two parts out of all the whole movie!""WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOLIERS""It all starts out when Norbit is literally thrown out of the car when he was a baby.  Mr. Wong an Asian racist, who owns an orphange, rescues Norbit from the coyotoes.  In the orphanage, Norbit meets the love of his life, Kate.  But his heart is soon broken when she's adopted.  Then an even bigger problem comes along.  Raspusha!  Raspusha saves Norbit from some bullies, and I don't know if her brothers and her adopted Norbit or not, but she forces him to be her boyfriend.  Then when Norbit grows up, Raspusha forces him to marry her.  She's not only on the really chuncky side, but she cheats on Norbit, and she abuses him.Then Norbit finds Kate again, who has come back to town to buy the orphanage from Mr. Wong.  But then it turns out that Kate has a fiance!  So the whole town is somehow run by Raspusha and her brothers, and everyone hates and fears them.  When Raspusha's brothers find out about Kate trying to buy the orphanage, they plot possibley the most stupidest thing that I can think of.  They plan to turn the orphanage into a strip bar!  They even get Kate's fiance to join in, saying that if he married Kate and she owned the orphanage, then the quicker he could help them turn it into a strip bar.Well to make a long story short, Raspusha isn't very happy about Norbit's love interest.  And blah blah blah.Well anyways, when I started watching this film, my dad could not only not reconize Eddy Murphy, but he refused to believe that Eddy was playing Raspusha and Mr. Wong!  Hah imagine that!  And he got so bored with it that he walked out of the room!  I sadly sat there watching it, and I regret every minuet of it.  In fact I wasn't so much focused on the fact that Raspusha is fat, it was more on the fact that she was really, and I mean really, really mean! In fact this stupid movie made me have a nightmare about Raspusha chasing me in my Grandma's house!  And on Norbit the character itself, he's possibly the biggest whimp in the world!  I almost felt sorry for him.  Heck if I was married to someone like that, I would have kicked him to the cruve a long time ago!

""Norbit"" just did not measure up to previous movies with Murphy, and it seemed just another shallow attempt at exploiting something that was already done well: the Clump movies.While it is definitely not a kids' movie by any stretch of the imagination, it just was not all that funny. At most, I would call it amusing, and some parts were genuinely so. The scenes of Rasputia shooting down the slide, running over the dog and so on were relatively funny. Her conversation with Kate about feeling sorry for Kate's skinny little body was also a highlight. Also, the pool attendant asking Rasputia if she is wearing bikini bottoms was a laugh. Beyond such scenes, there was little that could be called truly funny, just amusing.The movie rarely varies the tone, and sticks rather rigidly to the usual romantic comedy formula. In that sense, it is a predictable one and nothig makes it standout from others of the genre.However, I have to add one thing: the suit that Murphy wore in the role of Rasputia was very realistic. It was almost disturbing in the realism that it managed to attain.Although a fan of Murphy's movies, and Murphy in general, I cannot really get myself all that enthusiastic about ""Norbit"".

In ""Norbit,"" Murphy appears as three characters:  Norbit, the nerdy orphan who's never learned to stand up for himself; Rasputia, the obese shrew who ropes Norbit into marrying her; and Mr. Wong, the owner of the orphanage, who raised Norbit after he was unceremoniously dropped off there by his parents one fateful night in the late 1960`s.  Norbit is all grown up now and living in a squeaky-clean, candy-colored, studio backlot small town inexplicably inhabited by both white-bread types straight out of Middle America and stripe-suited, Cadillac-driving street pimps fresh from the `hood.There's no point in denying Murphy's skill at mimicry and impersonation, since the evidence is there in spades for all to see in  ""The Nutty Professor.""  But then ""The Nutty Professor"" gave Murphy an actual, honest-to-God screenplay off of which he could build his routines.  In the case of ""Norbit,"" if the studio had spent even a tenth of the time and effort on coming up with a good script as it did on designing fat suits and CGI-enhanced prosthetics, this might have been a decent comedy.  As it is, it's just loud, obnoxious and offensive and wastes the talents of Thandie Newton, Cuba Gooding Jr., Marlon Wayans and Eddie Griffin into the bargain.  Of course, as co-writer of the screenplay, Murphy has really no one but himself to blame for his being trapped in this fiasco.When the only source of humor is making fun of fat people, and when that one note is played over and over and over again to ever diminishing results, you know it's time to cash in your chips and move on.

Eddie Murphy is a talented and experienced actor in playing several roles in a single movie, as evidenced in his work during The Nutty Professor and The Klumps.  Norbit opens up some new avenues for Murphy, and he rises to the challenge professionally and with a humor that will take you by surprise.Norbit was left on the doorstep of Mr. Wong's restaurant and orphanage.  Raised by Mr. Wong, his closest friend in the orphanage is Kate.  They were so close they held a mock wedding ceremony under a tree, but then Kate is adopted and Norbit is left alone.  During school, while being picked on by bullies, Norbit meets Rasputia (""Do you have a girlfriend?  No?  Well now you do!)  Rasputia has three thug brothers also, a close family that Norbit has never experienced.  When he grows up, Norbit marries Rasputia.There's no mistaking who wears the pants in that little family, Rasputia walks all over the timid Norbit.  Then Kate returns to town with fianc&eacute; Deion Hughes. Determined to purchase the old orphanage from the aging Mr. Wong.  With Rasputia running his life and cheating on him, all of Norbit's attention is on the beautiful Kate.  But with Norbit married and Kate engaged, can it ever work out between the two of them?Eddie Murphy plays three characters in this film: Norbit, Rasputia, and Mr. Wong.  The FX is fantastic, Rasputia's fat looks REAL, the bodywork they did for the character is fantastic.  You can hardly recognize Murphy as Mr. Wong.  Even Norbit is a stretch for a Murphy character, with a very timid look and feel to him.  Thandie Newton as Kate and Cuba Gooding Jr. as Deion are fantastic.  Another kudo to character actor Eddie Griffin as the pimp named Pope Sweet Jesus.This movie is crude humor, so if you're not into crude you may not like it.  Special scenes would be Norbit's wedding night to Rasputia, Mr. Wong's speech at the wedding, Rasputia getting into the car and honking the horn with her big chest as she tries to adjust the seat, and the entire water park scene.  If you want a ridiculous movie that will make you laugh out loud, then check out Norbit and leave your pride and pompousness behind the door.  Worth a purchase.

I have been a longtime fan of his and to see him in a film such as this is disheartening as the film reeks of desperation and at this high point in Murphy's career he should be anything but desperate.  He was extraordinary in ""Dreamgirls"" and deserved his Oscar nod for that, but for next film to be this one is a tragedy and a serious misstep.This film is mean-spirited to the core, lacks considerable heart, and is basically a one-joke comedy.  I admit that the make-up is excellent by the well-known multi-Oscar-winning Rick Baker, and that Eddie Murphy totally disappears and becomes a whole other person under that make-up, but unlike hisThe Nutty Professor I & IIfilms in which he had multiple roles that were both funny and heartwarming at times, this alter ego is just too cruel to allow us to enjoy the point of Murphy in the make-up.Are there genuine belly-laughs in this film?  Absolutely, especially the amusement park scene in which I was laughing hysterically, but those moments are few and far between.  Sadly, the overall mean spirit that prevades this film counteracts those humorous moments.  Had this film been promoted more as a ""black comedy"" (a funny or humorous bent on an otherwise serious subject) I think I would have been more accepting of this film, but since it was promoted as another ""Nutty Professor"" kind of film, I was angrily disappointed and found this film rather painful to sit through.I gave it two stars for the make-up, Murphy's considerable acting talents regardless of the material he has to work with, and some geniunely funny, even hysterical moments.",2,A rather unfunny and cruel comedy.,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,1787,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'report', 'latest', 'film', 'Oscar-nominated', 'enormously', 'talented', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'extreme', 'disappointment.This', 'such', 'sad', 'waste', 'Murphy', 'considerable', 'talents', 'have', 'been', 'longtime', 'fan', 'see', 'film', 'such', 'disheartening', 'film', 'reeks', 'desperation', 'high', 'point', 'Murphy', 'career', 'should', 'be', 'anything', 'desperate', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'Dreamgirls', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'next', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'tragedy', 'serious', 'misstep.This', 'film', 'mean-spirited', 'core', 'considerable', 'heart', 'basically', 'one-joke', 'comedy', 'admit', 'make-up', 'excellent', 'well-known', 'multi-Oscar-winning', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'totally', 'whole', 'other', 'person', 'make-up', 'hisThe', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'IIfilms', 'had', 'multiple', 'roles', 'were', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'times', 'alter', 'ego', 'just', 'too', 'cruel', 'allow', 'enjoy', 'point', 'Murphy', 'make-up.Are', 'there', 'genuine', 'belly-laughs', 'film', 'Absolutely', 'especially', 'amusement', 'park', 'scene', 'was', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Sadly', 'overall', 'mean', 'spirit', 'film', 'humorous', 'moments', 'Had', 'film', 'been', 'promoted', 'more', 'black', 'comedy', 'funny', 'humorous', 'bent', 'otherwise', 'serious', 'subject', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'accepting', 'film', 'was', 'promoted', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'kind', 'film', 'was', 'angrily', 'disappointed', 'found', 'film', 'rather', 'painful', 'sit', 'through.I', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'make-up', 'Murphy', 'considerable', 'acting', 'talents', 'regardless', 'material', 'work', 'geniunely', 'funny', 'even', 'hysterical', 'moments']",N/A

1069513,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000PATZJW,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","Eddie Murphy plays three characters in ""Norbit."" That in itself is not surprising at all considering his acting talent and brilliance of Rick Baker's make-up. One of the characters is called ""Rasputia,"" the lady on the DVD cover and as you can see, like his funnier ""Nutty Professor,"" Eddie Murphy's new comedy ""Norbit"" has plenty of fat jokes, fart jokes, gross-out jokes, etc, (and I don't disagree with these jokes themselves). But this time they are mostly unfunny.Well, some may laugh seeing a fat lady like Rasputia slide down a water slide and dive into a swimming pool - yes, I did laugh - but I don't think many people would find it funny seeing a fat lady trying to run over a neighbor's pooch. And the same fat lady happens to be a shrill, mean-spirited wife of a mild-mannered accountant Norbit (played by Eddie Murphy again) and she cheats on his husband with Marlon Wayans' dance instructor. I still don't know what part of this he found that funny.Here you don't find even a message like ""Be yourself"" or self-parody of the first ""Nutty Professor"" film, which is not best Eddie Murphy film, but still is more entertaining. Watching ""Norbit"" made me rather sad, not only because it is a recycled standard romantic comedy with lots of familiar physical jokes, but the impressive cast including Thandie Newton, Marlon Wayans, Clifton Powell, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Eddie Griffin are all wasted among this uninspired plot.
