The universality of the characters was also somewhat diminished in the second season because it seemed like everything was slanted toward lesbian shock value.  I think they took some of the stuff too far and the more graphic scenes in the second season were gratuitous and detract from good storytelling.  There was also a pervasive darkness that distinguished it from from the first season.  I could care less about the Jenny character--what is her deal?

We liked them and wanted to see them be happy, or at least be willling to try to be. Getting through an episode of Season 2 is liked swimming through mud.  Characters behave in transparent, unmotivated and unamusing self destructive ways to an irritatingly ""trendy"" soundtrack.  Like pod people all these women are becoming the same miserable lesbian with ever increasing homogeneity of hair and clothing styles. Every major character is unhappy in the same ways for each show.

910952,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B0009QTRVI,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[0, 0]","At first, this series makes you (or most people, anyway?) feel a little like Alice in Wonderland.  Everything that's in the ""regular"" world is transplanted into the realm of the lesbian lifestyle.  We have:  lesbian stalkers, lesbian love-triangles, lesbian womanizers, vindictive lesbians, altruistic lesbians, confused lesbians, lesbian couples who want to have babies & much more.  Somewhat surprisingly, however, after watching the show for awhile, all of the above stops being so strange and it blurs into the rest of the ""regular"" stuff in the world.  That, I believe, is one of the focal points of the show.One of the best ways to be introduced to the show is to have an overview of the main characters.***Bette (Jennifer Beals) is a Type A personality, no-nonsense Ivy league graduate who is a curator of an L.A. art museum.  Both her lifestyle as well as her profession draws the ire (not to mention persecution) of religious fundies.  Beals is the Sarah Jessica Parker of ""L Word"" as she's the one actress whom we'd like to see strip down who never does so.***Tina (Laurel Holloman) is a coy woman who wants to also be a mother.  She always tends to have domineering women who try to seduce her - such as Bette, for one.***Dana (Erin Daniels) is a professional tennis player who is an up & comer in the rankings.  She is not as big a name as Marina Navratolova, so season one sees her struggle with keeping her personal & public life separate.  By season 2, however, she has found a sponser (Subaru) that allows her to use her sexual orientation to her advantage.***Alice (Leisha Halley) is the comic relief of the show, and she's also my favorite character.  While her hairstyles are not always overly becoming, she's still absolutely adorable.  She & Dana team up for some of the hottest scenes in the show.  Alice also keeps a ""matrix"" on her wall @ home which tries to keep up with all the lesbian interactions in L.A.  Whether she is straight, bi or lez, Alice would be an absolute BLAST to hang out with - regardless of your gender!***Jenny (Mia Kirshner) is an import from the midwest, and it's evident that she feels out-of-sorts on the west coast.  She moved to L.A. to be with her boyfriend, but she found herself to be sexually confused.  She finds that she is bisexual (sort-of?), but more than anything else she is a sort of lesbian loose-cannon.  With her gorgeous, mysterious eyes she is arguably the most visually stunning woman on the show (although I much preferred her w/the long hair she sported in season 1).****My 2 least-favorite characters are Shane (Katherine Moehnning) and Kit (Pam Grier).  Shane is a hairdresser who seems to have a phobia about combing her hair.  She is a sort of female Don Juan (Donna Juan?) who can ""score"" with just about any woman at will.  Why this is so, I have no idea.  To me she looks like a female Johnny Depp.  Kit, meanwhile, is Bette's straight sister who is not nearly so cerebral as Bette is.  In truth, I find her character to be somewhat superfluous to the show, and I tend to fast-forward through her main scenes.Many people have compared The L Word withSex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset).  I don't think this is a comparison which should be pushed too far as there are some major differences in the timbre of the shows.  First off, SITC is a lighthearted sitcom while L Word is a drama.  L Word is NOT simply another SITC with a ""twist"" where the women are homosexual instead of heterosexual.Secondly, the theme of homosexuality itself is not considered in a thoughtful way in SITC.  Carrie has a gay friend named Stanford in SITC, but he's a buffoon who is not to be taken seriously.  When 2 of the characters in SITC either engage in or think of engaging in lesbian encounters, it's in a recreational sense.  The L Word, meanwhile, is about lesbian RELATIONSHIPS rather than simply some sort of recreational vehicle for women to find joy.With that in mind, those who are looking for every episode to be filled with one steamy male-fantasy lez scene after another are likely to be a bit perturbed.  There's no question that there ARE some smokin' hot scenes, but they go along w/the story as opposed to being contrived.One of the most refreshing things about The L Word is the fact that, likeGirl Play, it's not a show that is about male-bashing.  As a man, that's one thing I was wondering about when I picked up the first 2 seasons (I'd never seen an episode on SHOWTIME).  Surprisingly enough, it doesn't even take sides in the straight vs. lez lifestyles.  It's not a ""recruiting tool"" to coerce young women to test-out the lesbian lifestyle.  Rather, it demonstrates that being a lesbian doesn't ""simplify"" things @ all.  Our lesbian friends have to face off against the same set of relationship difficulties that all people do, be they straight or not straight.Lastly, those persons (like me!) who are looking for Gina Holden's famous scene with Jennifer Beals, be sure to check out episode 4, disc 1 of season 2.  It's good that this show was made for SHOWTIME so it could bypass the FCC.  It simply would not have worked if they had tried to make it ""G Rated.""  I'm hoping they never try to water it down into a syndicated show on a regular cable channel, as they did with SITC on TBS.",4,Sappho would be proud,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,5296,"['first',

The writing remains creative even though at times a tad preachy, but thanks to stellar performances from an outstanding cast, you won't even notice the occasional feminism-thumbing dialogues.I was especially impressed with how well this season handled socially sensitive issues like infidelity, marital reconciliation, miscarriage, coming out, sexual inertia, gay parenthood, dismissive partners, and damaged parent/offspring relationships without exaggeration or simplification. I was also glad to see that sex scenes remained artsy, tasteful and without grave exploitation a la Queer as Folk.It also bears to mention that the soundtrack is very interesting and eclectic.Even though the show is about a group of gay women living in Los Angeles and their lives and entanglements, it addresses universal topics to which we all could relate. The lines of gender, sexuality and time period are very blurred into realism enough to make this show relative for men and women, gay or straight, 100 years down the road.Highly recommended.",5,"Transcending Gender, Sexuality and Time",1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,1150,"['writing', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'plot', 'treatment', 'Season', '2', 'are', 'as', 'solid', 'were', 'Season', '1', 'not', 'better', 'writing', 'creative', 'even', 'times', 'tad', 'preachy', 'thanks', 'stellar', 'performances', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'occasional', 'feminism-thumbing', 'dialogues.I', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'how', 'well', 'season', 'handled', 'socially', 'sensitive', 'issues', 'infidelity', 'marital', 'reconciliation', 'miscarriage', 'coming', 'out', 'sexual', 'inertia', 'gay', 'parenthood', 'dismissive', 'partners', 'damaged', 'parent/offspring', 'relationships', 'exaggeration', 'simplification', 'was', 'also', 'glad', 'see', 'sex', 'scenes', 'remained', 'artsy', 'tasteful', 'grave', 'exploitation', 'la', 'Queer', 'Folk.It', 'also', 'mention', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'interesting', 'eclectic.Even', 'show', 'group', 'gay', 'women', 'living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'lives', 'entanglements', 'universal', 'topics', 'could', 'relate', 'lines', 'gender', 'sexuality', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'very', 'blurred', 'realism', 'enough', 'make', 'show', 'relative', 'men', 'women', 'gay', 'straight', '100', 'years', 'road.Highly', 'recommended']",The L Word: Season 2

Can't really put my finger on what I feel about this second season. It was more serious than the first, which in a way is a good thing (not all lesbians have fun ALL of the time lol) but also it kind of took something away. The spirit, the 'network' if you will. The friends have kind of gone seperate ways (Shane and Jenny are practically best buds, which I LOVE by the way) Alice and Dana become lovers, Bette is on her own for the most part, which I'm glad of, and Tina is with THE biggest div ever lol.I liked the season, loved it infact, but I was expecting more I think. Season 1 was so huge, so awesome, I was hoping that the same level of greatness would be carried through. I think this hasn't been realised in season 2.The success of the show may have clouded people's judgement. It's now being written 'trendily' for trends sake, because they knew they got it down perfectly in season one, only then they weren't trying to impress. It was real then, natural. Now it seems somewhat 'performed' for the audience, giving them what they want and trying to get the gay world right out there. Slighty tright and self apreciating.That makes me sound like I don't like the show anymore, which is far from the truth. I do love it, I just think that the writers should be careful not to go overboard. It's sink or swim now. Take it slow, built on relationships. At the end of the gay....sorry, day (laughs), it seems they are trying to sell tickets into the big gay club that is the world; showing us the fashions, the trends, the life...but not the people living it.

The show was extremely well written, character development superb, and the actors are are very lovely and sexy.  I have worked my way thru most of season 2; I am thrilled to have 4 more seasons to view when this one ends.  I only wish I could have seen season 1 before they got rid of it, or was it ever even here?

The stories will suck you in soap-opera style, so don't expect to strecth these eps over a long amount of time!Jennifer Beals' acting steals the show; she conveys her feelings without saying a word, she'll break your heart in every episode. Amazingly, everyone else lives up to the surprisingly high bar that she sets.High Points:- All-star guest stars: they act their asses off- More (desperately needed) character development for Shane- Some beautiful new additions to the cast (Carmen is eye candy!)- Writing goes a little more in-depth to lesbian issues- Kit and Bette have some *powerful* scenes w/ their father- Tons of really fun extrasSome drawbacks include:- A few dropped storylines that leave you thinking ""Wait, what happened to ...?""- The new music. 80% of the music in the show is some variation on an atrocious new theme song.- It's a little hard to believe that *every* woman in LA is gay. Really, all of them?- Some dialogue is unnatural and forcedOverall, the good outweighs the bad, and I'll be cherishing this addition to my collection for years to come.",4,Well Worth Owning!,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1160,"['Even', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'TV', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'stories', 'will', 'suck', 'soap-opera', 'style', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'strecth', 'eps', 'long', 'amount', 'time', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'acting', 'steals', 'show', 'conveys', 'feelings', 'saying', 'word', ""'ll"", 'break', 'heart', 'episode', 'Amazingly', 'everyone', 'else', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'bar', 'sets.High', 'Points', 'All-star', 'guest', 'stars', 'act', 'asses', 'off-', 'More', 'desperately', 'needed', 'character', 'development', 'Shane-', 'beautiful', 'new', 'additions', 'cast', 'Carmen', 'eye', 'candy', 'Writing', 'little', 'more', 'in-depth', 'lesbian', 'issues-', 'Kit', 'Bette', 'have', '*powerful*', 'scenes', 'w/', 'father-', 'Tons', 'really', 'fun', 'extrasSome', 'drawbacks', 'include', 'few', 'dropped', 'storylines', 'leave', 'thinking', 'Wait', 'what', 'happened', 'new', 'music', '80', '%', 'music', 'show', 'variation', 'atrocious', 'new', 'theme', 'song.-', 'little', 'hard', 'believe', '*every*', 'woman', 'LA', 'gay', 'Really', 'dialogue', 'unnatural', 'forcedOverall', 'good', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cherishing', 'addition', 'collection', 'years', 'come']",The L Word: Season 2
