BUT in this TV production she was marvelous. I also thought her acting was good, too. She was delightfully animated with the children and the scenes with von Trapp were good. She did not milk the drama, true, and she wasn't as &#34;natural&#34; as Julie Andrews. But this was not the movie, it was a staged play, something that hasn't hit TV live in WAY too long. (I must point out that Mary Martin was a wonderful actress, but none of us have really seen her do any of the role.) Captain von Trapp (sorry, I don't remember many names) was actually very good. His voice is a bit dry - lacking in vibrato - but he was convincing as an actor, and his singing was way above Theodore Bikel or whoever dubbed Christopher Plummer. The actor for Max (straight from Smash) was very good. He did not play lines for laughs at all. The children were amazing, but for more reasons than given in other reviews. Did anyone notice they actually looked a little like the Captain? and they could believably be brothers and sisters. Audra McDonald was wonderful. Don't I have quibbles? Yes, the opening chant should have had less vibrato. Chapel choirs don't sing with that much vibrato. Listen to the original cast album (not the movie) and you'll hear it. (The original chorus had Tatiana Troyanos - later of the Metropolitan Opera, Patricia Brooks - later of NYC opera, and Joey Heatherton. Wow.)The stage production of course could not give the sweeping vistas of the Alps, but the stage version pays more attention to the coming Anschluss. The tension is palpable, even in &#34;light&#34; hearted songs like &#34;No way to stop it.&#34; (which was not in the film.  There was some editing of music: a little more for Maria as she goes to the von Trapp house, and more for the Captain to sing (maybe because he could.) The nod to the movie came with &#34;Something Good&#34; replacing &#34;An ordinary couple.&#34; - to which I say, &#34;Thank goodness.&#34;",5,T.V. was alive with the sound of music. . . .,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,2046,"['was', 'worried', 'Ms.', 'Underwood', 'doing', 'role', 'Diction', 'when', 'usual', 'rep', 'only', 'so-so', 'BUT', 'TV', 'production', 'was', 'marvelous', 'also', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'was', 'delightfully', 'animated', 'children', 'scenes', 'von', 'Trapp', 'were', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'milk', 'drama', 'true', 'was', ""n't"", '34', 'natural', '34', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'staged', 'play', 'something', ""n't"", 'hit', 'TV', 'live', 'WAY', 'too', 'long', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'was', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'none', 'have', 'really', 'seen', 'do', 'role', 'Captain', 'von', 'Trapp', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'many', 'names', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'voice', 'bit', 'dry', 'lacking', 'vibrato', 'was', 'convincing', 'actor', 'singing', 'was', 'way', 'Theodore', 'Bikel', 'whoever', 'dubbed', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'actor', 'Max', 'straight', 'Smash', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'lines', 'laughs', 'children', 'were', 'amazing', 'more', 'reasons', 'given', 'other', 'reviews', 'Did', 'anyone', 'notice', 'actually', 'looked', 'little', 'Captain', 'could', 'believably', 'be', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'quibbles', 'Yes', 'opening', 'chant', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'less', 'vibrato', 'Chapel', 'choirs', 'do', ""n't"", 'sing', 'much', 'vibrato', 'Listen', 'original', 'cast', 'album', 'not', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'original', 'chorus', 'had', 'Tatiana', 'Troyanos', 'later', 'Metropolitan', 'Opera', 'Patricia', 'Brooks', 'later', 'NYC', 'opera', 'Joey', 'Heatherton', 'Wow', 'stage', 'production', 'course', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'Alps', 'stage', 'version', 'more', 'attention', 'coming', 'Anschluss', 'tension', 'palpable', 'even', '34', 'light', '34', 'hearted', 'songs', '34', 'way', 'stop', 'it.', '34', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'was', 'editing', 'music', 'little', 'more', 'Maria', 'von', 'Trapp', 'house', 'more', 'Captain', 'sing', 'maybe', 'could', 'nod', 'movie', 'came', '34', 'Something', 'Good', '34', 'replacing', '34', 'ordinary', 'couple.', '34', 'say', '34', 'Thank', 'goodness.', '34']",The Sound of Music Live!

The network accomplished what it wanted -- appointment television that made me want to watch it live and not just record it to watch later. I hope that night's ratings will compel the networks to try more of this type of classy and family programming.The show, overall, was pretty good. The staging, the sets and costumes were quite nice and I thought that the choreography was clever, considering the small space they had to work with. The supporting cast were all fantastic, from Frau Schrader and The Mother Abbess to all the children (particularly the actress who played Liesl).If I could, I would give this show 3.5 stars. I wish I could give it 4 stars but I cannot ignore the lead actors' performances. I am a fan of Carrie Underwood's music and she sang beautifully in her role as Maria. It is not easy to remember her lines, the lyrics to all the songs and do all that choreography in front of a camera for millions of viewers and she successfully did it all. However, her lack of experience in acting was pretty obvious, especially next to seasoned Broadway actors. She didn't act terribly but since she was the pivotal character of this musical, it was essential to emote and bring us, as the audience, with her throughout the story. Her voice was flat and therefore, she sounded bored. I thought Stephen Moyer as the Captain did well, under the circumstances. I didn't know he could sing and that was a pleasant surprise but it sounded like he was trying too hard and therefore, he lacked the subtle transition from coldness to tenderness.Ultimately, what was missing entirely was the chemistry between Maria and Captain von Trapp. The chemistry is the reason the whole story took place; a young nun initiate falls in love with a man who thought he lost love.

I was nine years old.  I've seen the movie countless times since.  Put aside your doubts and judge this live stage version on its own merits.

In this version, she is surrounded by several very accomplished actors and actresses.

The first reason is that it was done in the first place, giving people who never get to the theatre a chance to see what basically amounts to the stage version of this classic musical for themselves. Secondly, NBC was gracious enough to cast many Broadway veterans in supporting roles, and they give splendid performances. Much mention has been made here of Audra McDonald's turn as the Reverend Mother, and she deserves all the accolades. So does Laura Benanti as Elsa Schrader; she was warm and funny and made us understand why she might have captured Von Trapp's interest, if not his heart. Kristine Nielsen, whom I had the pleasure of seeing onstage in Vanya & Sonya & Masha & Spike, (she was hysterical as Sonia) played the housekeeper with pleasing restraint. And while Christian Borle seemed too young for Max, he brought much-needed humor to the festivities. I even got to see one of my favorite singers, Christianne Noll, in a rare television appearance as Sister Margaretta!That said, I would not recommend buying this DVD, and the main reason would be Carrie Underwood. Now people are being harshly criticized for harshly criticizing Ms. Underwood; she, herself, has said of her critics that they need to bring Jesus into their hearts. Without meaning any unkindness, it becomes clear from the first moments she appears on the screen that Ms. Underwood cannot act. And since Maria carries this show for beginning to end, I deem it important that Maria should be able to successfully interpret the lines as well as the songs. In a weird way, the presence of strong Broadway performers becomes something of a detriment here as we compare their work side by side with Ms. Underwood's flat interpretation of lines. I also wasn't a fan of Steven Moyer's brooding Captain Von Trapp. He played it too harshly, and he had no singing voice to fall back on.Fans of Carrie Underwood might be better off purchasing the CD. And you might also try and understand that many of us appreciate musicals for their libretto as well as their score. We look to directors to cast performers who can successfully bring off all aspects of a performance. Cable TV is not cheap, and we invested three hours of our lives in this production. I think that entitles us to a Maria of substance and not to an experiment in stunt casting. However, I still give kudos to NBC for trying this. I've heard the ratings were a lot better than the reviews, so perhaps other classic musicals might be in the offing.

1673464,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B00FWMVVLS,Brent Butler,"[17, 19]","This was a bold and wonderful idea ... a three hour live presentation of the Sound of Music ... with the wise move of pinning most of the casting on musical ability rather than star recognition. I really can't remember much like this being attempted since the famous Mary Martin portrayal of Peter Pan in the early 1960s!They pulled it off. The sets were detailed and very attractive. Costume changes happened frequently, and my wife and I couldn't help but pay attention to how long the commercial breaks were and how long certain characters were off-stage for that reason. Carrie Underwood's costume change from her ""kickin' around the castle outfit"" to her wedding gown was an impressive feat! LOL There were myriad camera angle changes, including seamless changes from full body views to close ups, which meant that the actors had to be right on their marks every moment of the performance.There were a couple of little wiggles in the dialogue ... hesitations at the most ... which lent to the charm of the production and underscored the fact that it was live. There were really no gaffes, but that possibility kept us a bit on the edge of our seats.All the music and the singing was top notch. The performance of the orchestra was full and flawless, and reminded me in impressive fashion of the orchestra's performance in the movie. Every part was sung with vigor and most importantly ... talent.Carrie Underwood was a touch wooden on the acting side, but that isn't her strength and it wasn't a surprise. Her performance in the songs was top notch. You wouldn't want to compare it back to back to listening to Julie Andrews, but that could be said for all but a handful of female singers all time. Her performance was quite satisfactory and detracted nothing from the show.Stephen Moyer was asked to play the part of the stiff Captain and he played the part of the stiff Captain, at times a bit too stiffly I thought. He was at his best after the story allowed him to break down and show some personality and warmth. His singing was surprisingly strong, and most important ... on key.Laura Benanti, who many may most readily recognize from her recent role on Royal Pains, looked stunning in the role of the Countess, and her singing was professional stage quality.Audra McDonald as the Mother Abbess showed off the voice that has propelled her to five ... count 'em FIVE, Tony Awards. She's also an outstanding actress and showed off all of her talents in this production.Christian Borle was solid as the promoter Max Detweiler. While he was not as smarmy as Richard Haydn in the 1965 musical, he didn't need to be. He gave the role his own personality and spirit, and made a very entertaining Max.This production has an extra song not included in the film, probably because it could not have been successfully carried off by Haydn, Eleanor Parker, and Christopher Plummer. It was an artful song that segued from the Captain's engagement to the Countess to a break-up based on the inability to come to terms on political ideology. That transition was handled very differently in the film and I found this treatment to be more believable.I hold back a star from the product, rather than the overall performance. Blu ray has been out a LONG time and has plenty of product penetration. Why just a DVD for this? Possibly the DVD is easier to deliver and we'll see a Blu ray sometime down the road. I hope so, as the sets, costumes and music certainly deserve the detail that Blu ray could bring us.Highly recommended.",4,"Rather unique and highly enjoyable, December 6, 2013",1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,3519,"['was', 'bold', 'wonderful', 'idea', 'three', 'hour', 'live', 'presentation', 'Sound', 'Music', 'wise', 'move', 'pinning', 'most', 'casting', 'musical', 'ability', 'rather', 'star', 'recognition', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'being', 'attempted', 'famous', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'portrayal', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'early', '1960s', 'pulled', 'off', 'sets', 'were', 'detailed', 'very', 'attractive', 'Costume', 'changes', 'happened', 'frequently', 'wife', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'pay', 'attention', 'how', 'long', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'were', 'how', 'long', 'certain', 'characters', 'were', 'off-stage', 'reason', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'costume', 'change', 'kickin', 'castle', 'outfit', 'wedding', 'gown', 'was', 'impressive', 'feat', 'LOL', 'were', 'myriad', 'camera', 'angle', 'changes', 'including', 'seamless', 'changes', 'full', 'body', 'views', 'close', 'ups', 'meant', 'actors', 'had', 'be', 'right', 'marks', 'moment', 'performance.There', 'were', 'couple', 'little', 'wiggles', 'dialogue', 'hesitations', 'most', 'lent', 'charm', 'production', 'underscored', 'fact', 'was', 'live', 'were', 'really', 'gaffes', 'possibility', 'kept', 'bit', 'edge', 'seats.All', 'music', 'singing', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'performance', 'orchestra', 'was', 'full', 'flawless', 'reminded', 'impressive', 'fashion', 'orchestra', 'performance', 'movie', 'part', 'was', 'sung', 'vigor', 'most', 'importantly', 'talent.Carrie', 'Underwood', 'was', 'touch', 'wooden', 'acting', 'side', ""n't"", 'strength', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'performance', 'songs', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'compare', 'back', 'back', 'listening', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'handful', 'female', 'singers', 'time', 'performance', 'was', 'quite', 'satisfactory', 'detracted', 'nothing', 'show.Stephen', 'Moyer', 'was', 'asked', 'play', 'part', 'stiff', 'Captain', 'played', 'part', 'stiff', 'Captain', 'times', 'bit', 'too', 'stiffly', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'story', 'allowed', 'break', 'down', 'show', 'personality', 'warmth', 'singing', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'most', 'important', 'key.Laura', 'Benanti', 'who', 'many', 'may', 'most', 'readily', 'recognize', 'recent', 'role', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'looked', 'stunning', 'role', 'Countess', 'singing', 'was', 'professional', 'stage', 'quality.Audra', 'McDonald', 'Mother', 'Abbess', 'showed', 'voice', 'propelled', 'five', 'count', 'FIVE', 'Tony', 'Awards', 'also', 'outstanding', 'actress', 'showed', 'talents', 'production.Christian', 'Borle', 'was', 'solid', 'promoter', 'Max', 'Detweiler', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'smarmy', 'Richard', 'Haydn', '1965', 'musical', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'gave', 'role', 'own', 'personality', 'spirit', 'made', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Max.This', 'production', 'extra', 'song', 'not', 'included', 'film', 'probably', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'successfully', 'carried', 'off', 'Haydn', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'was', 'artful', 'song', 'segued', 'Captain', 'engagement', 'Countess', 'break-up', 'based', 'inability', 'come', 'terms', 'political', 'ideology', 'transition', 'was', 'handled', 'very', 'differently', 'film', 'found', 'treatment', 'be', 'more', 'believable.I', 'hold', 'back', 'star', 'product', 'rather', 'overall', 'performance', 'Blu', 'ray', 'been', 'out', 'LONG', 'time', 'plenty', 'product', 'penetration', 'Why', 'just', 'DVD', 'Possibly', 'DVD', 'easier', 'deliver', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Blu', 'ray', 'sometime', 'down', 'road', 'hope', 'so', 'sets', 'costumes', 'music', 'certainly', 'detail', 'Blu', 'ray', 'could', 'bring', 'us.Highly', 'recommended']",The Sound of Music Live!

1673466,A1Q80YGJMUTQNR,B00FWMVVLS,Carrie,"[3, 3]","Only gave 4 stars because Carrie Underwood's acting and Stephen Moyer's singing could have been a bit better.But in only a few scenes. The vast majority of this stupendous production was very well-done indeed. The choreography and stagecraft were flawless, and give Carrie credit for this: she brought all of her songs to life, had plenty of dancing and stage business, and never missed a beat. Her scenes with the children were delightful, and her initial scenes with the Captain were as awkward as one would expect them to be for the characters and the situation. Her dance scene with the Captain was perfect, and in that moment you could see the two fall in love.This being the age of Twitter-bashing though, plenty of people found lots to carp about. Especially when it came to complaining about a superstar who made a courageous leap to a different medium...and succeeded.I've always enjoyed the movie version because of the gorgeous scenery and the scenes with Maria and the children, even as I cringed through the scenes with Maria and the Captain. The Captain's upper-class banter with the Baroness and Max was always cringeworthy too.But this version is vastly superior in my opinion, especially since the two marvelous songs ""How Can Love Survive?"" and ""No Way to Stop It"" were restored. Having Christian Borle and Laura Benanti as Max and Elsa was perfect casting indeed.And as everyone will tell you, Audra McDonald was superb. Her Mother Abbess was lively, compassionate and inspiring, and her voice just soared.Open your mind and heart, watch, and enjoy. This is a worthy addition to anyone's DVD collection.Update 12-22-13:The above review was based on the broadcast version, which I watched several times on NBC's website. I have now had the opportunity to watch the DVD, and while I am still amazed at the performance, I was a bit disappointed that NBC did not see fit to correct some of the sound problems (for example: a definite background hiss during some of the dialogue, and lost dialogue between Elsa and Max) and did nothing to ease the transition of the abrupt scene changes.

Can't imagine anyone enjoying listening to the hiss while trying to follow the dialog.

1673473,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B00FWMVVLS,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[2, 4]","Several decades ago, a Broadway Musical on TV wasn't an odd thing at all. Think of Alfred Drake in ""Kiss Me, Kate"" (NBC, 1958) or Mary Martin in ""Peter Pan"" (1955, 1956) and Julie Andrews in ""Rodgers and Hammerstein's  Cinderella"" (1957). Mary Martin and Julie Andrews are both, of course, forever connected to ""The Sound Of Music."" Mary Martin won a Tony Award for her performance as Maria in the original 1959 Broadway Production. Six years later, not being cast in the film version of her stage triumph ""My Fair Lady"", Julie Andrews  received an Academy Award nomination for her  beautiful and, yes,  iconic performance as Maria in Robert Wise's 1965 Academy Award winning film version.About a decade ago, when they started bringing musicals back to TV (""Gypsy"", ""The Music Man"", ""Bye Bye Birdie"" and ""Cinderella"") producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron promised, swore, in fact, that they would NEVER TOUCH ""The Sound Of Music."" With good reason. Robert Wise's film version, being as near perfect a film version of a Broadway musical as we will ever see, is too fixed in the public consciousness. Well, something happened. Somebody decided to do ""The Sound Of Music"": Live"" returning to the Original Broadway stage script.  That in itself must have been shocking to those fans who didn't even realize ""The Sound Of Music"" was a Broadway musical before it became a movie.  The real wild card here is Carrie Underwood. Who? Not caring anything about ""American Idol"" or country music, I had to Goggle Carrie Underwood to discover who, in fact, she is. Well, honey, a cute face, strong singing voice, six Grammy Awards, and an ""American Idol"" fan base will NEVER magically transform you into a musical theatre actress who is appropriate for the celebrated role of Maria Von Trapp.At this point, we can see how cold and calculated this enterprise is. NBC wanted ratings. And NBC got ratings. Nearly 18-20 Million people watched to see if Carrie Underwood and Cast would crash and burn. Or triumph? Nothing creates interest like controversy. And by the night of the live Broadcast on December 5, 2013, the  hyperbole and controversy over Carrie Underwood's casting reached a fever pitch. NBC got ratings, but did the big audience get a quality production? The end result was neither a marvelous theatrical revelation nor a theatrical train wreck. Somewhere in between.Well, Nonnberg Abbey looked frightening and foreboding. The mountainside set where Underwood belted out the title song looked like something spooky out of ""Hansel And Gretel.""  Nobody would be inspired to sing on that mountainside. Nobody should really be shocked  that Underwood is underwhelming as Maria. She CAN NOT act, and often looks painfully out of her depth. Von Trapp kids Michael Nigro, Ariane Rinehart and Joe West all have more real musical theatre experience than Underwood. That is rather instantly obvious. Stephen Moyer as Captain Von Trapp often seems like he is suffering from an upset stomach. But when Underwood has a confrontational scene with Moyer about being a bad dad to the kids, she suddenly snaps out of her coma. This frees Moyer up. The rest of the production is quite good. The scenes involving the Nazi Anschuluss and climax play out with real dramatic conviction and depth. Unfortunately, the production doesn't become good, interesting or involving until over an hour has passed. The play is only 2 hours and 13 minutes. It's all too little and too late.Fortunately, Laura Benanti and Christian Borle as Max and Elsa sparkle and  sing the two cynical songs, ""How Can Love Survive?"" and ""No Way To Stop it"" that were cut from the film version. This provides a nice balance to the more sweet songs. And Audra McDonald as the Mother Abbess is the BROADWAY STAR the production so desperately needed. When McDonald is on, the show belongs to her!!In the end, NBC got the ratings it desired. God knows, a lot of money was involved (with over a year to prepare, couldn't Underwood had taken acting lessons?) and NBC just had to sell this DVD, a Cast recording CD, and a ""Sound Of Music"" hot chocolate mug. Still, the audience got a High School Level production, at best, of a beloved musical theatre classic. Certainly the audience, and everyone else involved,  deserved much better than ""The Sound Of Mediocrity.""",2,"NBC PRESENTS A SHAKY,  LIVE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL PRODUCTION: ""THE SOUND OF MEDIOCRITY.""",1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,4306,"['Several', 'decades', 'ago', 'Broadway', 'Musical', 'TV', 'was', ""n't"", 'odd', 'thing', 'Think', 'Alfred', 'Drake', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'Kate', 'NBC', '1958', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Peter', 'Pan', '1955', '1956', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'Cinderella', '1957', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'are', 'course', 'forever', 'connected', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'won', 'Tony', 'Award', 'performance', 'Maria', 'original', '1959', 'Broadway', 'Production', 'Six', 'years', 'later', 'not', 'being', 'cast', 'film', 'version', 'stage', 'triumph', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'beautiful', 'yes', 'iconic', 'performance', 'Maria', 'Robert', 'Wise', '1965', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'film', 'decade', 'ago', 'when', 'started', 'bringing', 'musicals', 'back', 'TV', 'Gypsy', 'Music', 'Man', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Birdie', 'Cinderella', 'producers', 'Craig', 'Zadan', 'Neil', 'Meron', 'promised', 'swore', 'fact', 'would', 'NEVER', 'TOUCH', 'Sound', 'Music', 'good', 'reason', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'film', 'version', 'being', 'film', 'version', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'too', 'fixed', 'public', 'consciousness', 'Well', 'something', 'happened', 'Somebody', 'decided', 'do', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Live', 'returning', 'Original', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'script', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'shocking', 'fans', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'Sound', 'Music', 'was', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'became', 'movie', 'real', 'wild', 'card', 'here', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'Who', 'Not', 'caring', 'anything', 'American', 'Idol', 'country', 'music', 'had', 'Goggle', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'discover', 'who', 'fact', 'Well', 'honey', 'cute', 'face', 'strong', 'singing', 'voice', 'six', 'Grammy', 'Awards', 'American', 'Idol', 'fan', 'base', 'will', 'NEVER', 'magically', 'transform', 'musical', 'theatre', 'actress', 'who', 'appropriate', 'celebrated', 'role', 'Maria', 'Von', 'Trapp.At', 'point', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'cold', 'calculated', 'enterprise', 'NBC', 'wanted', 'ratings', 'NBC', 'got', 'ratings', 'Nearly', '18-20', 'Million', 'people', 'watched', 'see', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'Cast', 'would', 'crash', 'burn', 'triumph', 'Nothing', 'interest', 'controversy', 'night', 'live', 'Broadcast', 'December', '5', '2013', 'hyperbole', 'controversy', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'casting', 'reached', 'fever', 'pitch', 'NBC', 'got', 'ratings', 'did', 'big', 'audience', 'get', 'quality', 'production', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'marvelous', 'theatrical', 'revelation', 'theatrical', 'train', 'wreck', 'Somewhere', 'between.Well', 'Nonnberg', 'Abbey', 'looked', 'frightening', 'foreboding', 'mountainside', 'set', 'where', 'Underwood', 'belted', 'out', 'title', 'song', 'looked', 'something', 'spooky', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'Nobody', 'would', 'be', 'inspired', 'sing', 'mountainside', 'Nobody', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'shocked', 'Underwood', 'underwhelming', 'Maria', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'act', 'often', 'painfully', 'depth', 'Von', 'Trapp', 'kids', 'Michael', 'Nigro', 'Ariane', 'Rinehart', 'Joe', 'West', 'have', 'more', 'real', 'musical', 'theatre', 'experience', 'Underwood', 'rather', 'instantly', 'obvious', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'Captain', 'Von', 'Trapp', 'often', 'suffering', 'upset', 'stomach', 'when', 'Underwood', 'confrontational', 'scene', 'Moyer', 'being', 'bad', 'dad', 'kids', 'suddenly', 'coma', 'Moyer', 'up', 'rest', 'production', 'quite', 'good', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Nazi', 'Anschuluss', 'climax', 'play', 'real', 'dramatic', 'conviction', 'depth', 'Unfortunately', 'production', ""n't"", 'become', 'good', 'interesting', 'involving', 'hour', 'passed', 'play', 'only', '2', 'hours', '13', 'minutes', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.Fortunately', 'Laura', 'Benanti', 'Christian', 'Borle', 'Max', 'Elsa', 'sparkle', 'sing', 'two', 'cynical', 'songs', 'How', 'Can', 'Love', 'Survive', 'Way', 'Stop', 'were', 'cut', 'film', 'version', 'nice', 'balance', 'more', 'sweet', 'songs', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'Mother', 'Abbess', 'BROADWAY', 'STAR', 'production', 'so', 'desperately', 'needed', 'When', 'McDonald', 'show', 'end', 'NBC', 'got', 'ratings', 'desired', 'God', 'lot', 'money', 'was', 'involved', 'year', 'prepare', 'could', ""n't"", 'Underwood', 'had', 'taken', 'acting', 'lessons', 'NBC', 'just', 'had', 'sell', 'DVD', 'Cast', 'recording', 'CD', 'Sound', 'Music', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'mug', 'Still', 'audience', 'got', 'High', 'School', 'Level', 'production', 'best', 'beloved', 'musical', 'theatre', 'classic', 'Certainly', 'audience', 'everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'deserved', 'much', 'better', 'Sound', 'Mediocrity']",The Sound of Music Live!

Carrie, Stephen, and the children are not professional broadway actors. Watch ""The Making Of"" piece. The kids were chosen based on charisma and singing ability. There were some great broadway singers hired to fill out the cast, which was a definite plus. You have to remember that they had only a fraction of the time to prepare as they do for a movie. Often movies take years to put together. They only had a few months for this. By the time the cast was picked, and sets built...there was only a short amount of time left to perfect dance routines and musical numbers. Also, remember the director of a movie can re-film parts he's not happy with over and over 'til he or she is happy with it. A live performace doesn't have that luxury.

1673477,AYTGG6XTVUG7G,B00FWMVVLS,Douglas A. Greenberg,"[12, 14]","It was bold and even risky for NBC to produce this live, three-hour version of one of the most beloved musicals of all time. I would commend the network even if the presentation were subpar. But the production was entertaining and at times enchanting, and it constituted a real gift to viewers seeking a satisfying evening-at-home theatrical experience.I was pleased that the staging was based significantly on the original 1959 Broadway production featuring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel. Many viewers were likely unaware that in fact, the 1965 film,  as fabulous as it was, was not really the ""original"" version. There were three songs from the Broadway version that were omitted from the film, which instead substituted several new songs that in my curmudgeonly opinion remain eminently forgettable. But ""How Can Love Survive?"" and ""No Way To Stop It"" are wonderful, clever, tuneful numbers that I confess brought tears of renewed recognition to my eyes when they were performed last night. Apparently the  third omitted song, ""An Ordinary Couple,"" has been removed from the stage version canon, so its absence is  understandable.The Big Issue, of course, is, ""how did Carrie Underwood do?"" The woman can flat-out sing, and given the demands of live, choreographed musical performance, she did remarkably well, I think. At this point she is not strong as an actress, and though she clearly gave it her all, emotional expressiveness was lacking overall. I am appalled, however, that people have sent her negative Tweets and that some critics have panned her performance. My goodness, she is trying to follow the performances of two world-historically fantastic entertainers, Mary Martin and Julie Andrews. I think she deserves a bit of a break, and kudos to her for making the effort under such intense and critical scrutiny.The rest of the cast ranged from serviceable to fantastic, with special kudos to Laura Benanti as Elsa, Christian Berle as Uncle Max, and Ariane Rinehart as Liesl.  I give an extended standing ovation to Audra McDonald, who virtually stole the show as the Mother Abbess.Yes, I plan to buy the DVD when it is released, and assuming that the seemingly endless commercials will be removed from the broadcast (can I assume this?)

There's no getting around the fact that Carrie Underwood cannot act.  Dreadful doesn't begin to describe the awkward, clipped delivery of Frau Maria's lines, which, to begin with, are hardly Ibsen, Shakespeare or Moss Hart. With a pleasant, beautiful voice, she was obviously not coached in the correct style for this type of music, chopping off words, forgoing portamento in favor of a sterile crispness that stripped most of the songs of sentimentality which, in order to work,, these songs absolutely demand.Frequently looking nervous, she appeared to be cribbing cues or lines from teleprompters or cue cards at angles uncomfortably placed for so tiny a creature (particularly when precariously perched on heels inconceivable for a recent former postulate gone wild.  Her opening number was similarly clipped and one could almost hear the voice in her head saying, ""Go here. Stand there. Turn right. Hug the tree.""Watching Underwood play against stage pros like Benanti and McDonald felt like cruel and unusual punishment for all parties concerned, particularly the audience . . . or at least this audience.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the presentation and applaud NBC's efforts for undertaking a monumental project and doing it all (sort of) live. The sets looked terrificly lavish so there's that, but throughout there was a loud ""quiet"" whoosh during the non-musical portions which instead of being able to ignore grew increasingly more irritating.

She had to sing it in a lower key which ruined it and there was simply no emotion in it.  I'm telling you when Julie Andrews spun around on that mountain top and started singing that song the hair stood up on the back of my neck. Not so with Underwood.  Why on earth did they surround her with nuns with magnificent voices so that she just sounded worse. Unfortunately, she is a terrible actress.  Every scene she was in was like a high school show with,of course, an  amateur.  And, why did they do l0 versions of ""My Favorite Things"" right at the start of the show when that song is supposed to come much later when she is actually with the children.  The same song just went on endlessly.  And went on through the show so that it seemed like ""My Favorite Things"" was the title of the show. Whose idea was it to do this live anyway.

I have seen both the NBC production and the movie adaptation and I've found that the movie, in a very rare occurence, actually surpasses the original musical, not only on the most current casting choices, but also in the fluidity and placement of the musical numbers. For instance, as my partner pointed out to me, why would the Captain have a musical number with Elsa Schr&auml;der (&#34;How Can Love Survive&#34;) when he still is opposed to bringing music into the house, something that he only softens on when he hears his children singing the &#34;Sound of Music&#34; in the next scene? Also, &#34;My Favorite Things&#34; is a much more comforting song than the &#34;Lonely Goatherd,&#34; and makes much more sense to sing to scared children. Despite the shortcomings of the NBC Sound of Music production, I'm still excited to see the next live musical broadcast, whatever the show may be.

1673501,A14A4YYKPLYY26,B00FWMVVLS,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[1, 2]","I had first posted this review forThe Sound of Music Live!movie while watching it when it aired on NBCBut just because I HATE this version and expressed my opinion about it -- which, BTW is the WHOLE point of a writing a review (NOT to be insincere and falsely fawn over and flatter the subject with a review written through ""rose colored glasses""!) I was constantly bullied with insulting replies, and a low ""helpful review"" score, like nearly every other 1-star reviewer for this item.I was so MERCILESSLY attacked that I finally just took down my review altogether.However, after thinking about it for awhile, I decided that I am NOT going to give in to a bunch of intolerant bullies obsessed with stamping out any dissent. This is a HORRIBLE production of ""The Sound of Music"" and I am FAR from the only one who feels that way! Not only did Kym Karath, who played the youngest Von Trapp child, Gretel in the Julie Andrews version, post on Twitter about her disappointment and disgust with this production, but even the surviving Von Trapp family members did NOT approve of this production either.  Which is why I decided to write another review -- and I don't care if I'm flooded with insults, and given a ZERO ""helpful review"" score, I'm not going to let the bullies intimidate me anymore, because even if there are others who disagree, I have a right to my own opinion.Now, before going any further, I just have to say that I am a HUGE, HUGE fan of ""The Sound of Music"". Not only have I read theStory of the Trapp Family Singersthe biography/autobiography written by Maria von Trapp, but I also haveThe Sound of Music Family Scrapbookand TWO sets of ""The Sound of Music"" on DVD (theFive Star Collection EditionAND theTwo-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition) and incredibly, I'm still considering getting the movie on Blu-Ray at some point in the future (assuming that interest in online streaming does not completely take over/replace the Blu-Ray market!). I have also seen the Julie Andrews version literally probably at least a THOUSAND times (if not more!) since childhood, so many times that I pretty much know it by heart. So no one can say that I am not knowledgeable and a devoted & loyal fan of ""The Sound of Music"" -- and in my opinion, this live version with Carrie Underwood was a HUGE disappointment, and a TOTAL DISGRACE to the original with Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews!!Even with all its hype, this production falls flat and the casting, the characters and the acting was all just AWFUL -- and even that is putting it kindly. I couldn't even get through a FEW MINUTES of this before I needed to change the channel and take a break -- and even though I switched back & forth from time to time (mainly to see if it'd get any better -- which it unfortunately did not) I couldn't get through more than a couple minutes of the movie each time, before I was itching to change the channel again!What is it with everyone producing such AWFUL remakes of ALREADY-GREAT musicals & movies likeThe Sound of MusicandAnnie??Carrie Underwood is awful as Maria!She has a good voice but it isn't the right one for this production and she doesn't have the acting ability to pull off the character in this remake. Sadly,  everything about Carrie in this role, from her hairstyle, to her clothes, to her acting ability (or sheer LACK thereof!) was just horrible -- and the word ""insulting"" doesn't even come close to being an adequate description. Even the surviving members of the von Trapp family didn't want Carrie in this role. She may be a great singer, but she definitely is NOT an actress! With years of practice that could change, but doing a live performance, particularly at this time was a huge mistake. Although Carrie's pretty & can sing pretty well, she sounds so whiny and annoying when she's pleading with the Mother Abbess not to send her away (to the Von Trapps) which brings to another point -- the HORRENDOUS casting of Audra McDonald as the Mother Abbess!Now I am all for equality, justice and non-discrimination, and I absolutely abhor any kind of bigotry, racism & prejudice, but by the same token, there is also a lot to be said for being accurate and realistically true to history, especially when the setting of the work depicted is in past decades/centuries/millenniums. In all seriousness, what Catholic convent in 1930s Austria would have permitted an African-American woman to be the MOTHER ABBESS?!?During the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American woman even just being an ordinary nun would itself have been extremely unusual (if not even nonexistent!) ANYWHERE in the world, let alone in pre-Nazi era Austria -- but her being in a position of power (like being a Mother Abbess in charge of a convent) would unfortunately have NEVER have happened in that era. It's sad & unfortunate but during those ""Jim Crow"" days. prior to the incredible work done by heroes like Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X., Medgar Evers and others, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and its slowly increasing acceptance, neither black men and especially not black women were allowed to be in any positions of power. As the saying went back then, black women were relegated to being ""maids, mammies and mamas""! And what is it with casting Audra McDonald in every single remake?? She was also cast as Miss Grace Farrell in the remake ofAnnieand she was awful, not to mention historically inaccurate, there as well!This is NOT about either racism, multi-culturalism, or ""political correctness"" -- its about sheer historical inaccuracy, that stretches the limits of believability. Its like remakingGone with the Wind, and recasting Scarlett O'Hara with a Chinese woman, Rhett Butler with an African-American, Ashley Wilkes with a Latino, Melanie Hamilton with a Native American, India Wilkes with a woman from India (and I say that being of Indian descent myself!) and Mammy & Prissy with fair-skinned, blue-eyed blondes! Because that's what the ridiculous casting in these remakes basically amounts to -- changing the cast's characteristics, simply for the sake of political correctness and multi-culturalism, and the truth of history be damned!Unfortunately. the rest of the casting and acting in this movie is just as bad, if not worse!Nearly every character is unbearably annoying and petulant, and the way they deliver their lines so forcefully, it almost sounds like they were under duress to say it. Rather than being lovable and adorable like the von Trapp children (especially Gretel) in the original movie were, the kids come off as total brats. Even most kids taken off the street could act better than the von Trapp children or even Carrie Underwood or Steven Moyer in this movie. Instead of being the stern but basically loving Captain like in the movie, this Captain Von Trapp just comes off as an irritating, heartless and insensitive tyrant! From what I saw (I couldn't get through more than even half of this movie) there was not been one single character in this production that I liked. Maybe if the cast had been honing their acting skills by doing these performances in front of a live audience for a year or two before televising it, it would have worked for a live TV airing. But that wasn't the case, and all the characters were really fake and rehearsed. NONE of their dialogues sounded effortless, like they were saying those lines naturally as part of their normal conversation, but rather like it's like something they'd practiced beforehand and/or are being forced to say!If that's not bad enough, the producers changed around the order/placement of the song sequences in this movie, in the most ludicrous ways. For example, they moved the ""My Favorite Things"" song (which in the original movie, that Maria sings/teaches the von Trapp children during the thunderstorm scene) and putting it in the scene where Maria is in the Mother Abbess's office! The last straw for me, was when Maria and the Mother Abbess were singing the song together and the Mother Abbess is sitting on her desk, dangling her legs back & forth like she is a kid riding a swing! RIDICULOUS! What is she like 5 years old?? *smh*The Sound of Music Live!is a disgrace to the classic original with Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews! I just wish I had never seen this movie in the first place, and I hope this crap doesn't end up sullying my memories of the original movie! I regret that I have wasted time on this garbage, when there were so many other nicer things I could have seen instead :(All in all, IMHO this movie has been horrible IN EVERY WAY, and I will never buy it on DVD!!!!",1,What the HECK Movie Were All the 5-Star Reviewers (and Those Criticizing the 1-Star Reviewers) Watching?&#8232;&#8232;,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,8620,"['had', 'first',

Produced to formula it sticks almost religiously to the original book of the musical which in itself is a bad  musical play  and the weakest of all the R&H canon and the most dated. It was dated a year after it opened and Ernest Lehman did wonders to revitalise it for film. The fact that the producers decided to cling to the original clunky script is the first of many mistakes.Also the whole idea of it being live is a gimmick that is already unnecessary and to be honest un believable (who knows if every second of the show is live or some pre recorded and who cares) The other disaster is both leads are weak actors with Carrie Underwood really amateurish. Did we need this? No? is it a good idea? No. Will it continue with other musicals?Yes, tired originals of other old musicals will be dished out for a little while, but it is a gimmick that will soon die. There are so many more musicals worthy of this treatment. Even despite a bit of good singing from Audra McDonald(like all the others her acting is contrived and false)the only person who comes out of it unscathed is Laura Benanti who brings real spirit and likeability to Elsa.

1673507,AN94YI3URSAII,B00FWMVVLS,Lostgirl,"[3, 6]","Firstly I understand this was based on the stage version, not the film. But it's still somewhat difficult for me having grown up watching the film. I've heard Mary Martin's recordings as Maria and as talented as she is, Julie Andrews is Maria for me. Likewise The Sound of Music is sweeping vistas, stunning views of the Alps and the grandeur of the Von Trapp estate.But I tried to come to this with an open mind. After all, this was the first time in 50 years that a musical was produced live for television. I am grateful to NBC for taking a huge risk in airing that. I understand that they could not have done that without a big name star in the lead. Enter Carrie Underwood. Underwood sang it a la Mary Martin, not Julie Andrews (as I said I prefer Andrews) but her voice lacked the warmth of Martin. Not that it was terrible. I was impressed that she managed to tone down her twang and cut down on some her pop-isms. But the biggest problem is that she can't act. For the entire first act (up to ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"") she was visibly nervous. I can excuse that for the first 20-30 minutes. If she had eased into her performance at that point I wouldn't have held it against her at all. But it lasted nearly 2 hours before she eased into it. I noticed her look directly into the camera at several points early on. When she sang ""Do-Re-Mi"" she was huffing and puffing so much she sounded like she'd run a marathon. I wasn't sure if she'd hit the final note and when she did there  was a look of visible relief on her face. Her most comfortable number was definitely ""The Lonely Goatherd"". She actually looked like she was having fun! Still the singing wasn't my biggest problems with her. In terms of creating a character; well, she didn't. She read her lines with the inflection that had clearly been coached. She was missing the joie de vivre of the character, and there was no journey from willful stubborn girl, to strong woman.I've seen a lot of people bashing Stephen Moyer's performance; basically saying that he appeared, stiff, cold, and one note. Um, isn't that what Captain Von Trap is? The difference is that when he's paired with a lively, charismatic Maria they play off one another in a fun way.  When his Maria  is stiff and wooden that dynamic is impossible. I see the fault more on her part than his. Maybe ""fault"" is the wrong word. She was an inexperienced actress in a role that demanded more than she was able to give (though her attempt was sincere and brave). But just because Moyer is the more experienced actor doesn't make the lack of chemistry his fault. As for his singing, I thought he had a nice voice. Not the strongest in the world, but then the guy.who dubbed Christopher Plummer didn't have the strongest voice either;. And I think that Moyer was responsible for two of the more emotionally resonant moments in the piece. The first was when he hears the children singing the reprise of the title song, looks at them, realizes that he doesn't know them at all, so looks at the Alps that are so familiar to him, and begins to join in their song and finally embracing them. The other was during ""Edelweiss"" when he started playing the song on the guitar (which looked like he was doing for real...)  and singing, and then became overcome with emotion and got choked up. Maria then comes in and joins him and he visibly takes strength from her presence beside him and nails the end of the songMoyer's other strong work came in his scenes with Max (Christian Borle) and Elsa (Laura Benanti).  Borle and Benanti are stage veterans (Benanti actually played Maria in the 1999 Broadway Revival of the show) and it shows. Their two songs (cut from the film) ""How Can Love Survive"" and ""No Way To Stop It""  were comic relief highlights. The first is a duet between Elsa and Max and the second is a trio in which the Captain is included as well. Working alongside these pros elevates Moyer's performance to the level it could have been through out if he'd been given a strong costar. In ""No Way To Stop It"" there's a great moment where the Captain and Elsa realizes how poorly suited they really are. They end the song singing the same thing in the same place but miles apart. I found Borle's Max less fun than what I'm used to. He seemed more opportunistic and calculating. In contrast I found Benanti's Elsa to be far more sympathetic as Elsa than the ice queen portrayal that I'm used to. In spite of her ""me first"" attitude I felt bad for her when she realized that the engagement to the Captain wasn't going to go anywhere.However the award for the evening goes to Audra McDonald. She opens the show with a prelude (as opposed to Maria twirling around the hills like in the movie) alongside the other nuns (all stage vets including Christiane Noll, Nikki Renee Daniels, Elena Shaddow- who recently played Maria at the Papermill Playhouse, Ashley Brown- who played Maria at The Muny in 2010, Gina Farrell- who placed one of the nuns in the 99 Revival, and more; virtually all of whom have Broadway and operatic credits) and she sounds absolutely divine. Unfortunately the move to Carrie Underwood's title song is a bit of a let down after that.  I prefer ""My Favorite Things"" as a song Maria sings with the children- it makes more sense in that context. But Audra sounds so pretty singing it that I don't mind at all that it doesn't make a great deal of dramatic sense for it to be done that way (I feel that moving it was an improvement on the part of the film). However it is her ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" that is the high point of the broadcast. That's the point where even Carrie Underwood shows what appears to be some genuine emotion. Not only does she have a great voice, she's always an interesting, charismatic performer who never skips the character work in favor of the vocals.Overall this was not a perfect broadcast. It had a miscast leading lady, and a general ""made for television"" feeling. There were some technical problems such as poor sound mixing at times, and occasionally an audible hiss.  However,  I think that for the first time doing this in 50 years the network needed both a well known title and a big national star as a leading lady. I applaud the effort put forth from everyone involved and especially appreciate the successful elements. But since it got great ratings, hopefully NBC will do this again. When they do, I think it might be wise to do a musical with name recognition (maybe a ""name"" actor/actress who can sing rather than a singer who can't act) in the lead, but a less iconic film version. For example Brigadoon and Camelot are family friendly musicals with flawed film adaptations that aren't nearly as ingrained in popular culture as The Sound of Music.",4,A Valiant and Somewhat

1673508,A1D90MKRWB0ZKP,B00FWMVVLS,March boy,"[10, 18]","I tried my best to watch this NBC production with an open mind and not with the &#34;Julie Andrews WAS Maria, Christopher Plummer WAS Captain von Trapp, Eleanor Parker WAS the Baroness.&#34; mentality even though I completely adore the 1965 film and always will.The production values and staging of the sequences were fairly good but there are two things that detracted me from fully enjoying the performance.1. Carrie Underwood sings fairly well but her acting stinks--hardly surprising since she isn't a trained actress. She says all her lines in almost the exact same monotone cadence--mouth open, mouth shut, no inflection. Even the scene where she's supposed to be upset and having a hard time telling Reverend Mother that she's in love with the Captain she says her lines like she's sight reading the newspaper and her face is as calm, cool, collected and composed as if she's taking a walk in the park. I can imagine how much better this production would have been if Amy Adams (who gave a marvelous performance singing AND acting in Enchanted) had been cast as Maria instead.2. The nun's choir is unforgivably coarse and unmusical and have WAAAAAAY too much vibrato which makes them sound a little off-key at times. They seem to have only two ways of singing--forte and more forte. My goodness, the soft, reverent Latin hymn at the beginning was belted out with all the subtlety and finesse of a sledgehammer.On the other there were some fine supporting performances. Laura Benanti (Baroness Elsa) sings carefully and musically and her acting is very natural and un-self-conscious. Ditto to Christian Borle as Max. Stephen Moyer (not technically a supporting role but STILL) has the right amount of sternness and reserve to play Captain von Trapp and does a very good job making the smooth transition to a warm, gentle family man but his chemistry with Maria is basically non-existent because Carrie Underwood is just such a darn awful actress. The best singing by far was Audra McDonald as Mother Superior and Christiane Noll as Sister Margareta--her voice is so soft, light, delicate and crystal clear--heck she would have made a better Maria any day than Underwood but of course NBC had to go for a iconic household name to draw the masses to their televisions.Taken as a whole, this isn't a bad performance of The Sound of Music but it could have been better.",3,Not as bad as I expected.,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,2371,"['tried', 'best', 'watch', 'NBC', 'production', 'open', 'mind', 'not', '34', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'WAS', 'Maria', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'WAS', 'Captain', 'von', 'Trapp', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'WAS', 'Baroness.', '34', 'mentality', 'even', 'completely', '1965', 'film', 'always', 'will.The', 'production', 'values', 'staging', 'sequences', 'were', 'fairly', 'good', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'detracted', 'fully', 'enjoying', 'performance.1', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'sings', 'fairly', 'well', 'acting', 'stinks', 'hardly', 'surprising', ""n't"", 'trained', 'actress', 'lines', 'almost', 'exact', 'same', 'monotone', 'cadence', 'mouth', 'open', 'mouth', 'shut', 'inflection', 'Even', 'scene', 'where', 'supposed', 'be', 'upset', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'telling', 'Reverend', 'Mother', 'love', 'Captain', 'lines', 'sight', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'face', 'calm', 'cool', 'collected', 'composed', 'taking', 'walk', 'park', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'who', 'gave', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'singing', 'AND', 'acting', 'Enchanted', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'Maria', 'instead.2', 'nun', 'choir', 'unforgivably', 'coarse', 'unmusical', 'have', 'WAAAAAAY', 'too', 'much', 'vibrato', 'sound', 'little', 'off-key', 'times', 'seem', 'have', 'only', 'two', 'ways', 'singing', 'forte', 'more', 'forte', 'My', 'goodness', 'soft', 'reverent', 'Latin', 'hymn', 'beginning', 'was', 'belted', 'out', 'subtlety', 'finesse', 'sledgehammer.On', 'other', 'were', 'fine', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Laura', 'Benanti', 'Baroness', 'Elsa', 'carefully', 'musically', 'acting', 'very', 'natural', 'un-self-conscious', 'Ditto', 'Christian', 'Borle', 'Max', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'not', 'technically', 'supporting', 'role', 'STILL', 'right', 'amount', 'sternness', 'reserve', 'play', 'Captain', 'von', 'Trapp', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'smooth', 'transition', 'warm', 'gentle', 'family', 'man', 'chemistry', 'Maria', 'basically', 'non-existent', 'Carrie', 'Underwood', 'just', 'such', 'darn', 'awful', 'actress', 'best', 'singing', 'far', 'was', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'Christiane', 'Noll', 'Sister', 'Margareta', 'voice', 'so', 'soft', 'light', 'delicate', 'crystal', 'clear', 'heck', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'Maria', 'day', 'Underwood', 'course', 'NBC', 'had', 'go', 'iconic', 'household', 'name', 'draw', 'masses', 'televisions.Taken', 'whole', ""n't"", 'bad', 'performance', 'Sound', 'Music', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",The Sound of Music Live!

I love Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, but if you're looking for them here or something exactly like the movie, you'll be disappointed.  The stage show is shorter, thank goodness, a little over two hours; they leave out some of the songs written for the movie, and put back other songs where they originated, e.g., A Few of My Favorite Things.The actors are super, the children amazing.  The include a 'making of' featurette which I enjoyed as much as the movie.  These actors and crew worked their tails off!  They put out their best effort with singing, dancing, solo's, cute facial expressions and acting.  The veterans, including Moyer, McDonald, Benanti and Borle perform right on target.Carrie Underwood offers no English accent.  Her strong, country singing style is subdued, but still offers a bit of that wonderful huskiness and power.  Some say her acting is not polished.  Perhaps.  But I felt it came across simple, genuine, and unpretentious.  Until this performance, I've only seen her on posters and CD covers.  I think overall, and considering the weight of this role, she does wonderfully.They lay giant sets, Abbey, Mansion, Courtyard, Mountainside, side by side on a soundstage.  There's no audience which would be nice to add their energy, but the sets are extremely well done.  I believe they use 12 cameras and coordinate the shots and close-ups just like a regular edited film.  A live orchestra plays.I love the big, famous numbers with the children dancing, e.g,, Do-Re-Mi up and down the stairs of the mansion, out to the courtyard and the fountain and mountains; the lightning scene where all the kids run to Maria's room and here, unlike the movie, they sing and dance, to what I call the yodelling goat song. Again, amazing work by the young actors.  The whole show delivers lots of romantic fun with great energy.  My hope is that they do more live shows.An aside: they always state that this show is only suggested by the story of the Trapp Family singers.  I read that there were 10 children; that the father was a Naval officer but not strict as portrayed; they did not flee Austria from the Nazi's, but left on their own accord, normally, going to Italy first, since the Captain was also an Italian citizen, then to London and eventually, the U.S.; however, it is true, they felt the pressure of German Naziism, which they detested, and wanted to leave before things worsened.",5,Jolly Good Do-Re-Mi Fun,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,2608,"['nothing', 'live', 'performance', 'huge', 'stage', 'production', 'actors', 'sets', 'bouncy', 'musical', 'numbers.First', 'stage', 'movie', 'productions', 'are', 'different', 'love', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', ""'re"", 'looking', 'here', 'something', 'exactly', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'stage', 'show', 'shorter', 'thank', 'goodness', 'little', 'two', 'hours', 'leave', 'out', 'songs', 'written', 'movie', 'put', 'back', 'other', 'songs', 'where', 'originated', 'e.g.', 'A', 'Few', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Things.The', 'actors', 'are', 'super', 'children', 'amazing', 'include', ""'making"", 'featurette', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'actors', 'crew', 'worked', 'tails', 'put', 'out', 'best', 'effort', 'singing', 'dancing', 'solo', 'cute', 'facial', 'expressions', 'acting', 'veterans', 'including', 'Moyer', 'McDonald', 'Benanti', 'Borle', 'perform', 'right', 'target.Carrie', 'Underwood', 'English', 'accent', 'strong', 'country', 'singing', 'style', 'subdued', 'still', 'bit', 'wonderful', 'huskiness', 'power', 'say', 'acting', 'not', 'polished', 'Perhaps', 'felt', 'came', 'across', 'simple', 'genuine', 'unpretentious', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'posters', 'CD', 'covers', 'think', 'overall', 'considering', 'weight', 'role', 'wonderfully.They', 'lay', 'giant', 'sets', 'Abbey', 'Mansion', 'Courtyard', 'Mountainside', 'side', 'side', 'soundstage', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'add', 'energy', 'sets', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'believe', 'use', '12', 'cameras', 'coordinate', 'shots', 'close-ups', 'just', 'regular', 'edited', 'film', 'live', 'orchestra', 'plays.I', 'love', 'big', 'famous', 'numbers', 'children', 'dancing', 'e.g', 'Do-Re-Mi', 'up', 'stairs', 'mansion', 'courtyard', 'fountain', 'mountains', 'lightning', 'scene', 'where', 'kids', 'run', 'Maria', 'room', 'here', 'movie', 'sing', 'dance', 'what', 'call', 'yodelling', 'goat', 'song', 'Again', 'amazing', 'work', 'young', 'actors', 'whole', 'show', 'lots', 'romantic', 'fun', 'great', 'energy', 'hope', 'do', 'more', 'live', 'shows.An', 'aside', 'always', 'state', 'show', 'only', 'suggested', 'story', 'Trapp', 'Family', 'singers', 'read', 'were', '10', 'children', 'father', 'was', 'Naval', 'officer', 'not', 'strict', 'portrayed', 'did', 'not', 'flee', 'Austria', 'Nazi', 'left', 'own', 'accord', 'normally', 'going', 'Italy', 'first', 'Captain', 'was', 'also', 'Italian', 'citizen', 'then', 'London', 'eventually', 'U.S.', 'however', 'true', 'felt', 'pressure', 'German', 'Naziism', 'detested', 'wanted', 'leave', 'things', 'worsened']",The Sound of Music Live!

I watched as Julie Andrews did the live performance of CINDERELLA on TV in black and white back in the late 50's?? or 60's and it was beautiful.  Ms. Andrews' voice sparkled and the scenery, the acting were spot on--- it was live!  Now years later, we see another newcomer (to movies) with a beautiful voice do a LIVE production of a role that Ms. Andrews made popular years before on the big screen.  I applaud Carrie Underwood for having the courage to take on this part and do it so well.  She never claimed to have a voice or acting abilities like Julie Andrews, yet she held her own with Broadway theatre actors in this LIVE production.

1673518,A3KM9UA6MAVURN,B00FWMVVLS,"pjf ""pjf""","[10, 36]","I really wanted to like this and reminded my family, etc to watch.  But at times Carrie Underwood sounded like she was reciting the lines by rote from a script without feeling them. The previews looked good.  But she seemed honestly too old for the role, not a young girl, a novice nun.  Her deeper voice reinforced that.The actress who played the Baroness sang well, but her character was disconcertingly nice (so politically correct) rather than going for the evil step-mother role.  And what was that nonsense about her being a &#34;corporation president&#34;?  She was a Baroness in the 1930's not a 2013 career woman. Can't they produce a story true to the times it was set in without feeling the need to revise it to the point of politically correct inanity? The story loses much of its historical punch and sense of the times it was set in when the writers do this inane rewriting.Stephen Moyer could not sing; his acting seemed forced at times.  And the expressions on his face were more constipated than stern.  His stuttering and panic when the Admiral showed up with his commission was lame.  I was sadly disappointed in him.Obviously a live TV production is not a movie production, but even for a TV production it was a jangling anachronistic mess.  I was looking forward to a new &#34;stage&#34; production of this classic based on a historical cusp  but then the production dumbed down the history.  Some of the costumes and hairstyles were jarringly not period.  And given this was supposed to be a story about the von Trapp family fleeing the Nazis, I found it grating and ironic that the script had to be so politically correct they refused to even say the name Hitler, in the Heil Hitler salute.

1673521,A1EUI8FA4KNV95,B00FWMVVLS,Rissi,"[50, 58]","It&#8217;s safe to say that each one of us had a conflicting opinion about this production &#8211; and that&#8217;s just fine. The way I looked at this was that it was no different than going to a live Broadway production (I&#8217;ve not seen this on Broadway though did catch a local production and it was fun), only you were invited to watch the story everyone knows and loves from the comfort of your own living room. That sounded heavenly. Multiple interviews of the cast revealed that their production wasn&#8217;t a remake of the classic 1965 film starring Julie Andrews, instead this was an adaptation of the original stage production and as such, it was going to be its own interpretation that meant no disrespect to the movie. With its all-star cast (a country superstar, well-known television star and familiar Broadway cast), the more videos and teases that came out, I knew this was an event I&#8217;d not be able to miss.Music first; I eagerly downloaded Carrie and Company&#8217;s beautiful recordings of the classic songs we all know and love for a new generation, and... Carrie commanded the songs whether it was the catchy tune, &#8220;Do-Re-Me&#8221; (no country twang to be heard) or &#8220;My Favorite Things.&#8221; Fortunately, everyone does well with the songs which is paramount and when it came to actually watching the choreographed dances on television, I think the most memorable (although Maria and the Captain's dance was... pretty) was &#8220;The Lonely Goatherd.&#8221; It was charismatic plus was a nice substitute to the ever-popular &#8220;puppet scene&#8221; from the film not to mention props to the cast for performing a difficult choreographed scene, in terms of their vocals. I was very impressed by the children also &#8211; none of them were familiar names or faces (largely this is due to the fact that for many of them, they&#8217;d not acted before), though that didn&#8217;t stop them from being professionally delightful in the production. Despite this being a live production, I didn&#8217;t catch on to any major flubs on anyone&#8217;s part, which is kind of an extraordinary feat considering the understandable nerves in doing a live production. Some of the vocalists did seem winded a time or two, yet through it all, everyone made this 3-hour televised event a night to remember.There is heaps of criticism of NBC undertaking this and of the cast, however I have nothing of worth to complain about. This was a unique event and I for one came away a fan. Anyone who is loyal to the film will notice this production moves at a different pace (key scenes come earlier/later or relationships are formed swifter) and of course, some of the sets are limiting &#8211; the scope of each scene isn&#8217;t as &#8220;big&#8221; (particularly noticeable in &#8220;The Hills are Alive&#8221;); the live airing added a &#34;realness&#34; to the story that is missing from the film. With all that out in the open, 'The Sound of Music Live!' was a jewel. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ll soon forget and cannot thank and props to the cast, crew and NBC powers that be for putting on this event; it&#8217;s a familiar story for a new generation to discover&#8230; and the result is just lovely.",5,The Sound of Music Live!,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,3234,"['8217', 'safe', 'say', 'one', 'had', 'conflicting', 'opinion', 'production', '8211', '8217', 's', 'just', 'fine', 'way', 'looked', 'was', 'was', 'different', 'going', 'live', 'Broadway', 'production', '8217', 'not', 'seen', 'Broadway', 'did', 'catch', 'local', 'production', 'was', 'fun', 'only', 'were', 'invited', 'watch', 'story', 'everyone', 'comfort', 'own', 'living', 'room', 'sounded', 'heavenly', 'Multiple', 'interviews', 'cast', 'revealed', 'production', 'wasn', '8217', 'remake', 'classic', '1965', 'film', 'starring', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'instead', 'was', 'adaptation', 'original', 'stage', 'production', 'such', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'own', 'interpretation', 'meant', 'disrespect', 'movie', 'all-star', 'cast', 'country', 'superstar', 'well-known', 'television', 'star', 'familiar', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'more', 'videos', 'teases', 'came', 'out', 'knew', 'was', 'event', '8217', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'miss.Music', 'first', 'eagerly', 'downloaded', 'Carrie', 'Company', '8217', 'beautiful', 'recordings', 'classic', 'songs', 'know', 'love', 'new', 'generation', 'Carrie', 'commanded', 'songs', 'was', 'catchy', 'tune', '8220', 'Do-Re-Me', '8221', 'country', 'twang', 'be', 'heard', '8220', 'Favorite', 'Things.', '8221', 'Fortunately', 'everyone', 'well', 'songs', 'paramount', 'when', 'came', 'actually', 'watching', 'choreographed', 'dances', 'television', 'think', 'most', 'memorable', 'Maria', 'Captain', 'dance', 'was', 'pretty', 'was', '8220', 'Lonely', 'Goatherd.', '8221', 'was', 'charismatic', 'plus', 'was', 'nice', 'substitute', 'ever-popular', '8220', 'scene', '8221', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'props', 'cast', 'performing', 'difficult', 'choreographed', 'scene', 'terms', 'vocals', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'children', 'also', '8211', 'none', 'were', 'familiar', 'names', 'largely', 'due', 'fact', 'many', '8217', 'not', 'acted', 'didn', '8217', 'stop', 'being', 'professionally', 'delightful', 'production', 'being', 'live', 'production', 'didn', '8217', 'catch', 'major', 'flubs', 'anyone', '8217', 's', 'part', 'kind', 'extraordinary', 'feat', 'considering', 'understandable', 'nerves', 'doing', 'live', 'production', 'vocalists', 'did', 'seem', 'winded', 'time', 'two', 'yet', 'everyone', 'made', '3-hour', 'televised', 'event', 'night', 'remember.There', 'heaps', 'criticism', 'NBC', 'undertaking', 'cast', 'however', 'have', 'nothing', 'worth', 'complain', 'about', 'was', 'unique', 'event', 'one', 'came', 'away', 'fan', 'Anyone', 'who', 'loyal', 'film', 'will', 'notice', 'production', 'different', 'pace', 'key', 'scenes', 'come', 'earlier/later', 'relationships', 'are', 'formed', 'swifter', 'course', 'sets', 'are', 'limiting', '8211', 'scope', 'scene', 'isn', '8217', '8220', 'big', '8221', 'particularly', 'noticeable', '8220', 'Hills', 'are', 'Alive', '8221', 'live', 'airing', 'added', '34', 'realness', '34', 'story', 'missing', 'film', 'out', 'open', ""'The"", 'Sound', 'Music', 'Live', 'was', 'jewel', '8217', 'not', 'something', '8217', 'soon', 'forget', 'can', 'not', 'thank', 'props', 'cast', 'crew', 'NBC', 'powers', 'be', 'putting', 'event', '8217', 's', 'familiar', 'story', 'new', 'generation', 'discover', '8230', 'result', 'just', 'lovely']",The Sound of Music Live!

Garcia,"[5, 31]","First I want to say that they should do more made for TV big musical productions; however maybe later they can get other people to do a better job. Well where we should start on this amateur, in parts, production.  Starting with Carrie Underwood's amateur acting which was terrible at best. Why would they put all that money into this professional production and hire an amateur ""temp"" actress. She better not give up her night job as a singer. She sang too hard and too loud. Who does she think she is Ethel Merman? She couldn't come close to  Ethel Merman with a 20 foot megaphone. Some of these songs should start softly. She was forcing the notes like an NFL quarterback can force the ball and miss his man. The musical orchestration was poorly directed. When a singer starts singing the first note the music starts jumping in at the same second, like jumping your car with the dead battery. Traditionally the music should slowly come in, for a lead in, before the actress starts singing.There was bad casting in this play. The captain was too young and too green looking to be in command of a warship. He looks like he has no salt in his legs and would throw up the second any ship left the dock. Let's look at the Abby where the mother superior nun is a black woman. Excuse me this is Arian white Nazi Germany time in Austria. Is Hollywood trying to be too PC? Yes. Hey, I'm not even white but I want to see all whites in this musical so that at least they'll look Austrian; which took place just before WWII in that part of the world. The nuns did not sing in beautiful harmony. To be honest I stopped watching it before the second half. When you know the teams losing; why suffer anymore.Comparing this to the Robert Wise's production with Julie Andrews, as Maria, would only insult the master.

However, her joyous innocence completely makes up for any shortcomings. In short, she commands the stage in every scene, and her energy and flawless singing are amazing. Moyer is certainly &#34;good enough&#34; and fills out the production well.Aside from Underwood and Moyer, the other leads are experienced theater performers. There is definitely a contrast between them and the Underwood/Moyer pair. At times this contrast is a bit strange, but overall the show works.Five stars for Carrie Underwwod for undertaking a challenging role in the live production, and doing it very well. Four stars for Moyer who is fine, but otherwise unremarkable. Four stars for the other experienced theater actors. Five stars for the overall production, staging, sets, and so forth. Five stars for the live production, which really was amazing. Overall, five stars.",5,Joyous!,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,1250,"['Broadway', 'show', 'version', 'quite', 'different', 'movie', 'review', ""'m"", 'not', 'comparing', 'movie', 'incomparable', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'producers', 'have', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'overcoming', 'challenges', 'doing', 'show', 'live', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'so', 'far', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'first.Carrie', 'Underwood', 'admittedly', 'inexperienced', 'actor', 'However', 'joyous', 'innocence', 'completely', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'short', 'stage', 'scene', 'energy', 'flawless', 'singing', 'are', 'amazing', 'Moyer', 'certainly', '34', 'good', 'enough', '34', 'out', 'production', 'well.Aside', 'Underwood', 'Moyer', 'other', 'leads', 'are', 'experienced', 'theater', 'performers', 'definitely', 'contrast', 'Underwood/Moyer', 'pair', 'times', 'contrast', 'bit', 'strange', 'show', 'works.Five', 'stars', 'Carrie', 'Underwwod', 'undertaking', 'challenging', 'role', 'live', 'production', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'Four', 'stars', 'Moyer', 'who', 'fine', 'otherwise', 'unremarkable', 'Four', 'stars', 'other', 'experienced', 'theater', 'actors', 'Five', 'stars', 'overall', 'production', 'staging', 'sets', 'so', 'forth', 'Five', 'stars', 'live', 'production', 'really', 'was', 'amazing', 'Overall', 'five', 'stars']",The Sound of Music Live!

I don't think its fair to compare a movie to a play.  Also folks are criticizing Carrie Underwood's acting ability...give her a break!  If this were a Broadway show in NYC I believe it would have done well.  Many have suggested that bigger movie stars should have played the lead roles, but at what price? Why?  I watched this version with the mindset that I have never seen or heard of the sound of music which is why I rated it 5 stars.  If a stage performance entertains, has wonderful music, beautiful set designs and costumes then why not give it praise?  There is so much crap on television today that it is so easy to dislike more then half of what Hollywood or the major networks call entertainment.  I have the original on DVD which is a timeless classic.  We all know that the story is mostly fictional, made purely for entertainment.  So that being said enjoy this version and stop complaining about a job I believe that all involved did the best they could with the talent they have.

Besides that, I've never seen the original musical, and the Julie Andrews movie changed some things, took out some songs and added some, so this was the first time I got to see the musical as it was originally written. Many people are complaining about Carrie Underwood's acting. I think they are really just comparing her to Julie Andrews because I don't think it was that bad. I think the guy who played Georg was worse. I didn't think his character was very likable and he couldn't sing that well. Carrie Underwood proved she can sing just as well as any Broadway singer. There were moments where she showed emotion, even tears, and they were all performing live so I have to give them all props for that.

She finds a strict run household and tries to transform the children and their father with the power of song. I'll skip most of what I would normally say because the original is a classic and needs to explanation of the plot and story. On the other hand because this is such a classic it is a hard movie to remake and will no doubt be hit with criticisms. The only problem is all the critiques of this are misplaced. 90% of what people didn't like (most before they saw it) was the casting choice of Carrie Underwood. This blind hatred took away from the real problem with the remake, the fact that the story had no flow, no character development and none of the feeling and excitement of the original. Without trying to give too much away...the songs are moved all around and they don't fit in the new places. To get Maria to feel comfortable about leaving, her and the Reverend Mother sing &#34;My Favorite Things&#34;...the same reverend mother who is against her singing in the original. Because this song is used &#34;The Lonely Goat-herder&#34; is used to calm the children down in the thunderstorm. One final travesty is 5 minutes after she shows up and meets the kids they sing &#34;Do-Re-Mi&#34;. This movement of the songs affects the power of the &#34;My Favorite Things&#34; song as it is supposed to finally bond the children to her. Captain Von Trapp is also singing a lot in the movie which is something he forbade. I could go on and on about this because I not only loved but grew up on the original but I will just say the reason why this shouldn't have been remade has nothing to do with the casting. In order to really fully understand the story you have to have seen the original, but by watching that you will again see how bad this version was. Overall, all the power and emotion of the original is lost in this version due to the song placement...not the casting.

You may be disappointed if you try to compare it to Julie Andrews movie presentation. It's important to remember, that here you're watching a live theatre performance. No re-takes, no helicopters swooping in over the mountains, no mountains for that matter - just stage scenery. Theatre is many times harder and more complicated to perform than film because you have to be perfect. It can't be edited, it can't be re-shot. As great as the film with Julie Andrews was, it never could have been shot live. I love both versions, but I certainly respect the degree of difficulty that went in to making this live stage performance. First rate. 5 stars.
