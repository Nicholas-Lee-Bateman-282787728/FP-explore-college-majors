Everyone wanted to know what would happen next. It was fresh and exciting, the characters were young and attractive.Can anyone forget the days of Victor going to watch Nikki strip at the Bayou.How about the talented Cash, her male counterpart. Even the death scene with Mrs. C. holding vigil, was tasteful and believable.Who could forget the bad boy we loved to hate, Jack Abbott as played by Terry Lester.Victor and Douglas added class and more to the series. The writers wrote scrips  true to the characters in those days. We loved the sexy cowboy Victor, even when he was keeping his wife's lover prisoner in the wine cellar.The writing and characters were never better.",5,Y&R 1970: Bayou and Beyond,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,769,"['What', 'great', 'idea', 'Y', 'R', '1970s', 'DVD', 'Y', 'R', 'used', 'be', 'subject', 'DJ', 'talk', '70s', 'Everyone', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'was', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'characters', 'were', 'young', 'attractive.Can', 'anyone', 'forget', 'days', 'Victor', 'going', 'watch', 'Nikki', 'strip', 'Bayou.How', 'talented', 'Cash', 'male', 'counterpart', 'Even', 'death', 'scene', 'Mrs.', 'C.', 'holding', 'vigil', 'was', 'tasteful', 'believable.Who', 'could', 'forget', 'bad', 'boy', 'loved', 'hate', 'Jack', 'Abbott', 'played', 'Terry', 'Lester.Victor', 'Douglas', 'added', 'class', 'more', 'series', 'writers', 'wrote', 'scrips', 'true', 'characters', 'days', 'loved', 'sexy', 'cowboy', 'Victor', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'keeping', 'wife', 'lover', 'prisoner', 'wine', 'cellar.The', 'writing', 'characters', 'were', 'never', 'better']",The Young and the Restless
