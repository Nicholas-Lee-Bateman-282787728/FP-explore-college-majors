On the other hand, it seems to me that Babe Ruth's IQ is possibly equal to the number of most home runs he hit in a season as evident in his actions during the film. At least John Goodman gives a great performance. I think it is a good baseball picture showing what, I guess with a grain of salt, it was like during that time. What's refreshing about The Babe is that it's not as sugar-coated as many might fear it to be.

319211,A1PFQ1BKCXL8CY,6302534372,Daniel A. Wright,"[0, 1]","I liked this movie alot when I was a kid. It was the only real notion I ever I had of the slugger. But now that I have gotten older, and have seen numerous pictures and newsreels on Ruth, this film misses the mark in terms of its potrayal of a fat overgrown kid. Ruth was a consumate athelete as one reviewer pointed out. Not only could hit well he could also pitch well. he was all muscle though with the exception of the 1922 season. It was the 1922 season which was his worst, not 1925. It was 1923 when Yankee stadium opened that Ruth led them to the World Series, which would have been great for the movie to depict. He was also well aware of his flaws. But was not oblivious to his fans. This is one good thing about the film, Goodman does do well in portraying him as someone who adored his fans. I think a film about the real Babe Ruth would be more appropiate in the sense of chronicling a fascinating story about his career as a player as opposed to little snipits of games. This movie to me was way too short. It should be one of those epic 3-hour type movies. Ruth completely changed the game. Which we only get a glimpse of in the hotel scene with Jumping Joe with the line ""Homeruns are a rare commodity, keep them on the ground where they aint"". This was important point about Ruth coming of age in the Deadball era, had the film embelished on it just a little bit more it would have been better.

319214,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,6302534372,D. Blankenship,"[4, 4]","Babe Ruth is arguably the most well known baseball player in history. He was most certainly one of the greater players to play the game.  The stories and legends surrounding both is playing and his personal life could fill volumes; and indeed do.  It has gotten now to the point that it is difficult to separate truth from fiction.  All that being said though, even after you discount the myth portion of his life, Babe Ruth was still and all a fascinating man and baseball player.Now the movie being reviewed here cannot in any shape or form be classified as a historical documentary.  If a person wants that sort of thing, then it is best to find one of the many, many fine biographies written about Ruth.  No, for the most part this film is an extremely fictionalized version of Ruth's life and Ruth's game.  The errors in this film are beyond counting.  The portrayal of Ruth's life; while based on loose interpretations of fact, are quite off the mark in most cases.But all that being said I cannot actually trash the film.  I personally viewed this work as a simple baseball story about a historical character in which Hollywood did its usual job on.  I actually enjoyed watching this film as I felt the acting was most certainly up to par as acting in this type of movie goes and I liked the fact that the film makers most certainly captured the feel and essence of the times.  Sports in general, and baseball in particular, were a national obsession and followed closely by most of the nation.  This was before T.V. and (gasp) before football became our National Sport.  Times were quite different then; some for the good, some for the bad.  This film, if you watch closely, portrays the way it was quite well.John Goodman, despite being very much overweight for the part, actually did a pretty good job of catching the character of Ruth, in particular during the last part of the film.  The two ladies that played his two wives were excellent in their part and probably turned in more accurate performances of the people they portrayed than anyone else in the film.This film must be viewed as a simple ""baseball"" film and is not a historical documentary. Fans of baseball; those to know and love the game and its history will more than likely grind their teeth when watching much of this film but again, it must be remembered that this is not a documentary, rather it is a baseball film loosely based upon real characters.Now my personal objections to this film boil down to two things.  First is that a great film could be made of Ruth's life without twisting the truth all that much.  His real life was actually more interesting than anything Hollywood could come up with in their fantasy world.  My second concern is that many young folk may watch this film and come away feeling they know the ""true"" Babe Ruth story. The film makers here had a great opportunity to make a great film about a great baseball player but to be frank...the blew it.  On the other hand, viewed as a work of pretty much fiction, it was kind of fun to watch.Note:  I did not watch this on blue-ray, or any other recording device.  I watched this one on very late night T.V.  It was a good movie for those who like to prowl the late night movie channels.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",3,HISTORICALLY ACCURATE?

I think that by watching this movie you can see why the Sultan of Swat was the way he was, as far as his temper, his low self-esteem at first, his overgrown sense of his own self-worth toward the end of his career.  I thought John Goodman played a fine Ruth and while he did appear excessively heavy and slow for the part, Ruth was not a slim, overally muscled athlete in the 1910's.  Perhaps, the &quot;dirty&quot; scenes another reviewer commented upon were the scenes dealing with Ruth's flatulence!

319221,A3NJXCGCLNU808,6302534372,Jeff Smith,"[9, 12]","Yes, Babe Ruth was a baseball legend.Yes, Babe Ruth was like an overgrown kid in a candy store, trying to gobble up as much of the good life as possible before it overtook him.That is how it is portrayed in &quot;The Babe,&quot; showing the ups and downs in the life of the Bambino.John Goodman was excellent in this role. He played all aspects with gusto and showed what a talented actor he really is. Look at these facets.1. He leaves St. Mary's, shy, scared and not knowing what was waiting for him.2. His childish antics as he discovers things around him, such as the elevator in the hotel, chewing gum, good food, beautiful women and plenty of booze.3. His absolute love for the game, although he took no measures to keep himself in shape to play.4. His rollercoaster of emotions as his career and his personal life took ups and downs, from signing the biggest deal in baseball and creating &quot;The House that Ruth Built,&quot; to physical confrontations with the fans who jeered him.5. His devotion to children, especially those who were orphaned such as he was. He took them for rides in his car, he brought shoes to them in the orphanage.6. The painful realization that his career was over as he walked off the field for the last time with his head down, to the standing ovation of the home crowd.This is a vast expanse of characterizations, and Goodman covered them all. True, he did have to lose weight to play the Babe. He dropped down to 275 pounds. That's only 15 pounds more than Babe usually weighed when he reported to spring training after an offseason of indulging in food, booze and women. He would play his way down to 240 pounds by the end of the season, but he was still 20 pounds overweight. Just think how many home runs he would have hit if he had the work ethic of a Lou Gehrig, a Nolan Ryan, a Mike Schmidt or a Roger Clemens.Sure, Goodman had a washerwoman swing at times during the movie. But, keep in mind that he is &quot;right&quot; handed and is performing with his left. I am very right handed, and when I try to throw with my left hand, I look deformed.To those who glorify Babe Ruth, this movie may be a shocker, but it told the truth. He loved the game, and he loved to live the wild life. Ultimately, it shortened his career by a few years.Goodman is great as the Bambino!

It would certainly explain the film's inaccuracies and rushed feel.  I remember that around that time (late 80's, early 90s), Goodman seemed to be fairly popular.  Can it be coincidence that somebody wanted to make a film about Babe Ruth at around the same time Goodman started receiving recognition in Hollywood?  Honestly, I don't think so.  At any rate, Goodman is miscast as Ruth.  For one thing, Ruth wasn't really fat; more like broad and stocky.  He was quite athletic and able to play the field -  remember, there was no such thing as a designated hitter back then.  In other words, offense isn't the only part of baseball; Ruth played defense too.  Does this film ever show Ruth in the outfield?  Can't say for sure because I didn't really watch the entire thing, but it's hard to imagine paunchy John Goodman fielding fly balls.  The other thing is Goodman is simply unlikeable as Ruth.  As we can see from film footage (including Pride of the Yankees), the real Ruth was energetic and charismatic.

First, there are many inaccuracies in this movie, but I won't go into that too deep.  At the end of the movie (1936), The Babe is spitting up blood during the game between the Braves and the Pirates, but Ruth did not pass away from cancer until 1948.  Certainly Ruth did not have cancer in 1936..  There's many other things, but I don't need to list them all.But the thing that really bothered me about this movie is that Ruth is portrayed as nothing more than a bumbling idiot while he was with the Red Sox.  While this is good for a few laughs, it really took away from my enjoyment of the first half of the movie.  I'm thinking ""THIS guy is Babe Ruth??""  However, as soon as Ruth is sold to the Yankees, he becomes much more intelligent and doesn't act like a complete dumba$$ all of the time.  At this point, the movie takes a much more serious turn, and in my opinion, the last half of the movie is EXCELLENT.  The film delves into the Babe's issues both on and off the field, and definitely has some touching moments, and a strong finish to the movie.  Too bad the first half of the movie was so silly..  So overall, 1 star for the first half of the movie, 5 stars for the second half, for a final score of 3 stars.I thought that John Goodman was very good as The Babe, although yes, he was much larger (weight) than Babe Ruth really was at any point in his life, but let's not get hung up on details.  Goodman was a good fit for the part, and Kelly McGillis was excellent in the supporting role of Claire Hudson.All of that said, if you're a true baseball historian, you will find plenty to complain about with ""The Babe"", but if you just want a fun baseball movie to watch, then I would definitely recommend it.  I would hope that someday a movie is made about Babe Ruth that is more historically accurate, and has a much more grand feel like the movie 61*, because this telling of Babe Ruth's life just isn't quite the home run that it should have been.",3,"Good baseball movie, but not what it should have been",1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,2139,"['Probably', 'most', 'famous', 'baseball', 'player', 'all-time', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'should', 'definitely', 'have', 'had', 'movie', 'done', 'Babe', 'decent', 'effort', 'not', 'flaws', 'First', 'are', 'many', 'inaccuracies', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'deep', 'end', 'movie', '1936', 'Babe', 'spitting', 'up', 'blood', 'game', 'Braves', 'Pirates', 'Ruth', 'did', 'not', 'pass', 'away', 'cancer', '1948', 'Certainly', 'Ruth', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'cancer', '1936..', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'list', 'all.But', 'thing', 'really', 'bothered', 'movie', 'Ruth', 'portrayed', 'nothing', 'more', 'bumbling', 'idiot', 'was', 'Red', 'Sox', 'good', 'few', 'laughs', 'really', 'took', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'first', 'half', 'movie', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'THIS', 'guy', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'However', 'as', 'soon', 'Ruth', 'sold', 'Yankees', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', ""n't"", 'act', 'complete', 'dumba', 'time', 'point', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'turn', 'opinion', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'EXCELLENT', 'film', 'Babe', 'issues', 'field', 'definitely', 'touching', 'moments', 'strong', 'finish', 'movie', 'Too', 'bad', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'silly..', 'So', 'overall', '1', 'star', 'first', 'half', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'second', 'half', 'final', 'score', '3', 'stars.I', 'thought', 'John', 'Goodman', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Babe', 'yes', 'was', 'much', 'larger', 'weight', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'really', 'was', 'point', 'life', 'let', 'not', 'get', 'hung', 'up', 'details', 'Goodman', 'was', 'good', 'fit', 'part', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'was', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'role', 'Claire', 'Hudson.All', 'said', ""'re"", 'true', 'baseball', 'historian', 'will', 'find', 'plenty', 'complain', 'Babe', 'just', 'want', 'fun', 'baseball', 'movie', 'watch', 'then', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'would', 'hope', 'someday', 'movie', 'made', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'much', 'more', 'grand', 'feel', 'movie', '61*', 'telling', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'life', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'home', 'run', 'should', 'have', 'been']",Babe VHS
