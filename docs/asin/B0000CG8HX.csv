The guitar seems way more in the forefront on this. I admit the only Berlin album I ever listened to and really loved ( I heard Take my Breath away on radio of course) was Pleasure Victim. I really did not like the treatment of the songs from Pleasure Victim and most were played at the beginning (I really did not like the acoustic guitar only version of Pleasure Victim).The second part of this seemed to really come up in professional performance. At this venue it was very non gratifying to performers like Terri Nunn and Berlin so I dont know if anyone would appear to sound that good or appear to give a good performance here.I thought the additional female vocalist did nothing to enhance the performance, even the dancers did not excite me in the least. I saw that VH1 show where old band members get together and Berlin did that on the show. I think that was done at a later date and with the original members, it totally blew this concert away even though the members of Berlin on that show would say their performance was rusty at best.I am going to seek out other hopefully older Berlin DVD's. I will keep this one and play it again but it does not show me the sheer brilliance of the band I fell in love with in the early 80's.",3,from amateurish to great,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,1328,"['One', 'reviewer', 'already', 'said', 'ups', 'downs', 'true', 'bill', 'statement', 'guitar', 'way', 'more', 'forefront', 'admit', 'only', 'Berlin', 'album', 'ever', 'listened', 'really', 'loved', 'heard', 'Take', 'Breath', 'away', 'radio', 'course', 'was', 'Pleasure', 'Victim', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'treatment', 'songs', 'Pleasure', 'Victim', 'most', 'were', 'played', 'beginning', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'only', 'version', 'Pleasure', 'Victim', '.The', 'second', 'part', 'seemed', 'really', 'come', 'up', 'professional', 'performance', 'venue', 'was', 'very', 'non', 'gratifying', 'performers', 'Terri', 'Nunn', 'Berlin', 'so', 'dont', 'know', 'anyone', 'would', 'appear', 'sound', 'good', 'appear', 'give', 'good', 'performance', 'here.I', 'thought', 'additional', 'female', 'vocalist', 'did', 'nothing', 'enhance', 'performance', 'even', 'dancers', 'did', 'not', 'excite', 'least', 'saw', 'VH1', 'show', 'where', 'old', 'band', 'members', 'get', 'together', 'Berlin', 'did', 'show', 'think', 'was', 'done', 'later', 'date', 'original', 'members', 'totally', 'blew', 'concert', 'away', 'even', 'members', 'Berlin', 'show', 'would', 'say', 'performance', 'was', 'rusty', 'best.I', 'am', 'going', 'seek', 'out', 'other', 'hopefully', 'older', 'Berlin', 'DVD', 'will', 'keep', 'one', 'play', 'again', 'not', 'show', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'band', 'fell', 'love', 'early', '80']",Berlin - Intimate

I was literally dragged to the show,expecting to see a washed up band. What I got was a band that sounded potent and current, with Terri putting on a show with unbelievable energy and charisma, who looks like she was cyrogenically frozen in 1988 and released yesterday. Go to the show if you don't believe me. The DVD is going to be ""Storytellers"" style, and doing some of the songs acoustic (it actually works) with the original members.",4,Great live show will= great live DVD...,1067040000,"10 25, 2003",2003,578,"['shows', 'rock', 'harder', 'assume', 'band', 'known', '80s', 'snyth', 'pop', 'would', 'Terri', 'voice', 'live', 'incredible', 'underrated', 'singer', 'was', 'literally', 'dragged', 'show', 'expecting', 'see', 'washed', 'up', 'band', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'band', 'sounded', 'potent', 'current', 'Terri', 'putting', 'show', 'unbelievable', 'energy', 'charisma', 'who', 'was', 'cyrogenically', 'frozen', '1988', 'released', 'yesterday', 'Go', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'DVD', 'going', 'be', 'Storytellers', 'style', 'doing', 'songs', 'acoustic', 'actually', 'original', 'members']",Berlin - Intimate

Both her and the band put forth a spirited show, playing both old and new material.  The video is flawless, but the backing vocals are buried in the mix for some reason.  A great video for both longtime fans as well as newcomers to the band.  Highly recomended.",5,Fantastic!!!!!!,1069804800,"11 26, 2003",2003,333,"['Nobody', 'sing', 'more', 'Terri', 'DVD', 'band', 'put', 'forth', 'spirited', 'show', 'playing', 'old', 'new', 'material', 'video', 'flawless', 'backing', 'vocals', 'are', 'buried', 'mix', 'reason', 'great', 'video', 'longtime', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'newcomers', 'band', 'Highly', 'recomended']",Berlin - Intimate
776351,A2DPRPOP6FVDMN,B0000CG8HX,"William F. Thompson ""Bill Thompson""","[7, 8]","This DVD release by the band probably best known for Take My Breath Away from the Top Gun Soundtrack has some pluses and minuses.As far as the positives, lead singer and sole remaining original member Terri Nunn looks as great as ever. The set list is a good representation of the bands output and the musicians are fairly good.As far as the other, I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought there were 15 people in the audience. I think it was actually around 20. The audience for the most part looked like a bunch of aspiring models around 20 years old which would have put most of them in pre-school when Berlin had its heyday so I doubt they grew up being fans. The audience did seem to come alive though during the second song, The Metro, which is one of the band's more rocking numbers. You could almost hear the audience saying, ""Hey, these guys are pretty good. What's their name again?""As far as the sound mix I didn't experience the volume changes that some other reviewers described but I listened to it on the DTS 5.1 mix and maybe the problems were on the Dolby Tracks. I did think the overall mix could have used some improving though, especially the drums. Although most of the drums sounded ok, when the drummer hit the one Tom Tom in the front it sounded like he was hitting a plastic trash can.Overall, if you are a Berlin fan I would recommend to consider adding this to your collection but if not your money will probably be better spent elsewhere. Hopefully the band will consider putting out another live concert release in front of their own fans and maybe include their 80's videos as an extra.",3,Average Release.
