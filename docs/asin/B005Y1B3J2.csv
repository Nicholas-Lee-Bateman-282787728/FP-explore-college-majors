1505356,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B005Y1B3J2,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 2]","This Argentinian film is somewhat of a torture, thriller that starts out well and manages to stumble to the end zone.Here's the scoop. A young girl drives a guy, with whom she's beginning a relationship, to a house where his previous girlfriend has gone to hook up with a guy she met on-line. He needs to put a final finish on this previous relationship, and find out why he was so unceremoniously dumped, so he can move on with this next gal. After getting into the house he finds he's walked into a rough situation where two old geezers are torturing and killing young folk using varying instruments including some old, unstable nitroglycerin.This is a pretty cool set up. The unstable nitro thing was the main focus of William Friedkin's film ""Sorcerer."" They pay homage to him here by having the hero wear a ""Sorcerer"" t-shirt. But after the set-up, things get pretty stupid. I don't want to spoil but when our rescue party comes across some of the previous victims, it turns into somewhat of a ""Night of the Living Dead"", stay away from the flesh eating zombies kind of flick. I hung in to see if and how the bad guys would get their comeuppance. There is a lot of blood and gore for those viewers who thrive on that. It seems nitro does pretty nasty things to human flesh when it goes off.This isn't a bad watch. It's trim 90 minute running time won't strain your time budget. If you're a fan of the ""Saw"" films you might like this. If you're a fan of gore, torture films, you might like this. Other than that I wouldn't put it at the top of the ""to watch"" list.",3,Started Out Okay But.....,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,1568,"['Argentinian', 'film', 'somewhat', 'torture', 'thriller', 'out', 'well', 'stumble', 'end', 'scoop', 'young', 'girl', 'guy', 'whom', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'house', 'where', 'previous', 'girlfriend', 'gone', 'hook', 'up', 'guy', 'met', 'on-line', 'put', 'final', 'finish', 'previous', 'relationship', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'can', 'move', 'next', 'gal', 'getting', 'house', 'walked', 'rough', 'situation', 'where', 'two', 'old', 'geezers', 'are', 'torturing', 'killing', 'young', 'folk', 'using', 'varying', 'instruments', 'including', 'old', 'unstable', 'nitroglycerin.This', 'pretty', 'cool', 'set', 'up', 'unstable', 'nitro', 'thing', 'was', 'main', 'focus', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'film', 'Sorcerer', 'pay', 'homage', 'here', 'having', 'hero', 'wear', 'Sorcerer', 't-shirt', 'set-up', 'things', 'get', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'when', 'rescue', 'party', 'previous', 'victims', 'somewhat', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'stay', 'away', 'flesh', 'eating', 'zombies', 'kind', 'flick', 'hung', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'guys', 'would', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'viewers', 'who', 'thrive', 'nitro', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'things', 'human', 'flesh', 'when', ""n't"", 'bad', 'watch', 'trim', '90', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'strain', 'time', 'budget', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Saw', 'films', 'might', 'like', ""'re"", 'fan', 'gore', 'torture', 'films', 'might', 'like', 'Other', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'top', 'watch', 'list']",Cold Sweat

1505358,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B005Y1B3J2,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[0, 0]","Cold Sweat is a decent horror-thriller. It has some flaws but was actually fun to watch and definitely killed time.What did I like? Cold Sweat is somewhat original. The acting was great most of the time. It has its moments; the explosive gore scenes were actually unexpected (don't watch the trailers). I also liked the scene where the lead is told to call for help but only has internet on the phone; so he decides to post a Facebook status to ask for help from his +800 friends; Their responses were also funny. It's often thrilling and fast paced, but not really scary.What did I dislike? This horror film is more illogical than your average horror flick. The two antagonists are old men, one that can barely move with a walker. Two young and very capable individuals, like the leads, could've easily overpowered them and get help. Also, the lead characters look like they hide in plain sight, yet they can't be seen. They sit or kneel down in corners and they're suddenly invisible. The original plot should've been built up a little more, it starts off fine and then they suddenly ditch it.Overall, Cold Sweat is a time-killing thriller. It's about average. If you're interested, Cold Sweat is available on Netflix Streaming as of 7/3/12.Cold Sweat has violence, gore, and nudity.

1505359,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005Y1B3J2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","The new horror thriller ""Cold Sweat"" is a movie sure to divide its audience. I suspect that there will be plenty of aggressively negative reviews on one hand, but a number of equally supportive raves as well. This exercise in outrageousness from Argentina may not make a lot of sense in the grand scheme of things, but its sheer wackiness almost compensates for its narrative shortcomings. As much as my instincts tell me that I should completely write this one off, I simply can't. Part of my nature embraces what I like to call ""bad movie magic,"" and this spirited film embraces a nonsensical lunacy that it's hard not to appreciate on some level. So if you can disconnect your common sense and just enjoy the visceral unpleasantness of ""Cold Sweat,"" the movie does offer a uniquely skewed nightmare with a gritty visual style.Transpiring in what amounts to real time, this eighty minute film takes place almost entirely within the confines of one decrepit domicile. A man and his female friend arrive at the location because he is searching for answers about his recent break-up. They've tracked down this address as belonging to someone his ex engaged with online, and he wants to confront his former girlfriend. Once he gets inside, however, things go from bad to worse as unimaginable horrors are around every bend. Two elderly political radicals, strange experiments, and a house full of unstable explosives are just a few of the hurdles our hero must face. Can he find his girlfriend? Can anyone ever find the door out? Just what's happening in the basement? And who will survive this ever-escalating night of dread? No spoilers here, this is truly one you have to watch.The Bad:The political back story of the villains is vague and unenlightening.The current goals of the villains are also rather open-ended.Their experiments get no explanation.The good guys bumble around instead of trying to get out.Oftentimes they are hiding within one foot of the bad guys in plain sight, but aren't discovered.Good guys never seek help or do anything that seems rational.The Good:Amusing banter of villains, like a dysfunctional married couple.Good effects, nicely photographed.A few nice horror moments, even if they don't always make sense.Unsettling atmosphere.In truth, the cons probably outweigh the pros if you're keeping count. But writer/director Adrian Garcia Bogliano is committed to this piece of madness. I found moments painfully dumb and the script was filled with unanswered questions, but I couldn't tear my eyes away. And I was laughing throughout the ending (unintentional or not). If you analyze this picture, it just doesn't work. But if you're expectations are in check, there is plenty of gleeful nastiness. Almost a bad movie classic. I can't recommend this to most people, but some will truly embrace the insanity.

1505362,A3UAIEHXTUT85G,B005Y1B3J2,"S. Boone ""TheatreX""","[3, 3]","I wasn't expecting a lot from this film, but it turned out to be far better than I expected.  It's an Argentinian film, with a prelude regarding some of the terrorist activity and political unrest of the 70's.  Then, it jumps to present day as a young woman is about to go into an old house (on false pretenses) trying to help a friend out to see if his ex might be there....well, she was not expecting to find a couple of holdover terrorist from the old days who are nuttier than fruitcakes & experimenting with nitroglycerine-type stuff, and who have a basement full of crazed mutants (of sorts).  And, they just happen to have a big cache of dynamite in the basement too, a bunch that disappeared in the 70's.  And if you know anything about dynamite, the older it is, the more unstable it is.  Kind of like the 2 old geezers that hoarded it.This is a film that I am going to have to watch again because it was a bit hard to follow at times, but it also had me on the edge of my seat several times as well.  There are some things that did not seem to be explained well, but that did not stop the film from keeping my attention from start to finish.  It's weird enough and intense enough to be appealing, but it also won't be everyone's cup of tea.
