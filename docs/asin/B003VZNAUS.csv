If you listen to classic rock stations, his ""One (is the loneliest number)"" is his most famous song. It made him a one hit wonder, because it's the song people know. He composed songs forPopeyeand sang the Oscar-winning song forMidnight Cowboy. The Beatles considered him America's best singer-songwriter. Yet his name usually prompts stunned looks.This documentary chronicles his life through the voices of his famous friends- Robin Williams, Van Dyke Parks, Randy Newman, the Smothers Brothers (whom he heckled with John Lennon), Yoko Ono and Monty Python's Eric Idle&Terry; Gilliam. Nilsson had immense talent... and it burnt bright. His friendship with John Lennon was tempestuous. Nilsson struggled with drug&alcohol; addictions. His first two marriages ended;he entered his third marriage to Una O'Keefe impulsively, and was drunk at the wedding ceremony. Nilsson was a tragicomic man. His life was tragic- from his father's abandonment to his young death from a heart attack, but he lived with a sense of humor. He was the life of the party, and it was a life that was too short.",5,One is the Loneliest Number,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,1138,"['Harry', 'Nilsson', ""n't"", 'name', 'familiar', 'most', 'people', 'listen', 'classic', 'rock', 'stations', 'One', 'loneliest', 'number', 'most', 'famous', 'song', 'made', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'song', 'people', 'know', 'composed', 'songs', 'forPopeyeand', 'sang', 'Oscar-winning', 'song', 'forMidnight', 'Cowboy', 'Beatles', 'considered', 'America', 'best', 'singer-songwriter', 'name', 'usually', 'prompts', 'stunned', 'looks.This', 'documentary', 'chronicles', 'life', 'voices', 'famous', 'friends-', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Parks', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'whom', 'heckled', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Nilsson', 'had', 'immense', 'talent', 'burnt', 'bright', 'friendship', 'John', 'Lennon', 'was', 'tempestuous', 'Nilsson', 'struggled', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'addictions', 'first', 'two', 'marriages', 'ended', 'entered', 'third', 'marriage', 'Una', ""O'Keefe"", 'impulsively', 'was', 'drunk', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'Nilsson', 'was', 'tragicomic', 'man', 'life', 'was', 'tragic-', 'father', 'abandonment', 'young', 'death', 'heart', 'attack', 'lived', 'sense', 'humor', 'was', 'life', 'party', 'was', 'life', 'was', 'too', 'short']",N/A

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[2, 2]","Aside from his many hits for himself and others he's written as well as seeingThe Pointagain and again I knew precious little about Harry himself aside for him being a revered songwriter and later a drinking buddy of John Lennon. This well prepared documentary gives you ""a huge touch of Schmilsson"" to deal with starting with Harry growing up in poverty with an absentee father and his moms wild way of life. Of course that led him through different means into not only his musical career but also to meet up with a lot of friends who helped and supported him. And Harry always seemed more than willing to return the favor. Also this emphasizes what a talented vocalist he was,which led his channeling of Tin Pan Alley sounds and Brill Building pop/rock and eventually being compared to something of a one-man version of The Beatles,hense Lennon's comment about Nilsson being his ""favorite American group"". As talented as he was as a musician and as vibrant he was a personality some of his life's dilemas could'nt keep their distance from him. Already from an addiction prone family,a divorce shortly after the release of his breakthrough album with Richard PerryNilsson Schmilssonled him down the same self destructive ""rock n roll lifestyle"" of drugs and alcohalism which,by the middle of the 70's took away a good chunk of his beautiful vocal instrument. Needless to say as with other singers such as Billy Holiday and Brian Wilson whose voices have been somewhat diminished over years of chemical abuse that these people all had other talents to draw on. After John Lennon's death Harry,who drinking aside really did consider Lennon a very close friend became an outspoken advocate for gun control and to a degree neglected his music at the very time perhaps he needed to be paying it the most attention. While composing music for films he finally made a comeback before his passing in the early 90's,by which time he'd not only reconcilled with his estranged father but also with his new wife and children. It's a bittersweet tale but a compelling one,told with a lot of high quality information and good heartedness by all those touched by him. And it brings light to a talent that,despite being a fairly well known name is somewhat unsung to the level his talent and personality may have merrited.",5,"They're Talkin',I'm Listening",1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,2306,"['Aside', 'many', 'hits', 'others', 'written', 'as', 'well', 'seeingThe', 'Pointagain', 'again', 'knew', 'precious', 'little', 'Harry', 'aside', 'being', 'revered', 'songwriter', 'later', 'drinking', 'buddy', 'John', 'Lennon', 'well', 'prepared', 'documentary', 'huge', 'touch', 'Schmilsson', 'deal', 'starting', 'Harry', 'growing', 'up', 'poverty', 'absentee', 'father', 'moms', 'wild', 'way', 'life', 'course', 'led', 'different', 'means', 'not', 'only', 'musical', 'career', 'also', 'meet', 'up', 'lot', 'friends', 'who', 'helped', 'supported', 'Harry', 'always', 'seemed', 'more', 'willing', 'return', 'favor', 'Also', 'what', 'talented', 'vocalist', 'was', 'led', 'channeling', 'Tin', 'Pan', 'Alley', 'sounds', 'Brill', 'Building', 'pop/rock', 'eventually', 'being', 'compared', 'something', 'one-man', 'version', 'Beatles', 'hense', 'Lennon', 'comment', 'Nilsson', 'being', 'favorite', 'American', 'group', 'As', 'talented', 'was', 'musician', 'vibrant', 'was', 'personality', 'life', 'dilemas', ""could'nt"", 'keep', 'distance', 'Already', 'addiction', 'prone', 'family', 'divorce', 'shortly', 'release', 'breakthrough', 'album', 'Richard', 'PerryNilsson', 'Schmilssonled', 'down', 'same', 'self', 'destructive', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'lifestyle', 'drugs', 'alcohalism', 'middle', '70', 'took', 'away', 'good', 'chunk', 'beautiful', 'vocal', 'instrument', 'Needless', 'say', 'other', 'singers', 'such', 'Billy', 'Holiday', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'voices', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'diminished', 'years', 'chemical', 'abuse', 'people', 'had', 'other', 'talents', 'draw', 'John', 'Lennon', 'death', 'Harry', 'who', 'drinking', 'aside', 'really', 'did', 'consider', 'Lennon', 'very', 'close', 'friend', 'became', 'outspoken', 'advocate', 'gun', 'control', 'degree', 'neglected', 'music', 'very', 'time', 'perhaps', 'needed', 'be', 'paying', 'most', 'attention', 'composing', 'music', 'films', 'finally', 'made', 'comeback', 'passing', 'early', '90', 'time', ""'d"", 'not', 'only', 'reconcilled', 'estranged', 'father', 'also', 'new', 'wife', 'children', 'bittersweet', 'tale', 'compelling', 'one', 'told', 'lot', 'high', 'quality', 'information', 'good', 'heartedness', 'touched', 'light', 'talent', 'being', 'fairly', 'well', 'known', 'name', 'somewhat', 'unsung', 'level', 'talent', 'personality', 'may', 'have', 'merrited']",N/A
1368022,A1LFJA7HED1S5T,B003VZNAUS,"B. Bowman ""Double B""","[2, 4]","I can honestly say that no music documentary has moved me as much as this one since I saw Margaret Brown's ""Be Here To Love Me"" about the life and music of Townes Van Zandt. Like Nilsson, Van Zandt struggled for recognition during his lifetime and often had his songs become best known through versions by other artists. There are also parallels between the lives of the two men in terms of substance abuse. Unfortunately, these stories always have the same ending. There are very few survivors of this lifestyle, particularly in the fast living entertainment industry. (The only one that comes readily to mind is Keith Richards, although probably the Rolling Stones in general can be considered survivors.) I wouldn't say I was a huge Harry Nilsson fan prior to watching this documentary, although I do have two of his CD's in my collection. However, I can say after watching it that I had no idea what a complex person he was, and what a genius he was. One thing that I took for granted was his voice. He was an incredible singer, and I don't say that lightly. I will definitely be getting more of his music, the album of standards he recorded will be high up on my ""to buy"" list. I'm almost embarrassed to say that prior to watching this I considered him to be a footnote in John Lennon's ""Lost Weekend"" and the guy who made Fred Neil's ""Everybody's Talkin'"" a huge hit. There was so much more to this man than I was aware of, as many of his family, friends, and associates attest in this fascinating film. Like many musical geniuses, Nilsson's music was difficult to categorize and he was an extremely complex person. He also fought his fame, as many of the musicians that I admire did in one way or another, although he fought it in such an extreme way that he basically destroyed his voice on purpose. Although there were a lot of sad aspects to his life, the smiles on all his friends faces in the interviews, (and even at his funeral), said it all. This documentary was riveting, and although it gave me a lump in my throat several times I'm really glad I saw it. I hope that many more see it as well and recognize a singer and songwriter who was really underappreciated in his lifetime and deserves his due.",5,A stunner...,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,2216,"['can', 'honestly', 'say', 'music', 'documentary', 'moved', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'saw', 'Margaret', 'Brown', 'Be', 'Here', 'Love', 'Me', 'life', 'music', 'Townes', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'Nilsson', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'struggled', 'recognition', 'lifetime', 'often', 'had', 'songs', 'become', 'best', 'known', 'versions', 'other', 'artists', 'are', 'also', 'parallels', 'lives', 'two', 'men', 'terms', 'substance', 'abuse', 'Unfortunately', 'stories', 'always', 'have', 'same', 'ending', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'survivors', 'lifestyle', 'particularly', 'fast', 'living', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'only', 'one', 'readily', 'mind', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'probably', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'general', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'survivors', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'huge', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'fan', 'prior', 'watching', 'documentary', 'do', 'have', 'two', 'CD', 'collection', 'However', 'can', 'say', 'watching', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'complex', 'person', 'was', 'what', 'genius', 'was', 'One', 'thing', 'took', 'granted', 'was', 'voice', 'was', 'incredible', 'singer', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'lightly', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'getting', 'more', 'music', 'album', 'standards', 'recorded', 'will', 'be', 'high', 'buy', 'list', ""'m"", 'almost', 'embarrassed', 'say', 'prior', 'watching', 'considered', 'be', 'footnote', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'Fred', 'Neil', 'Everybody', 'Talkin', 'huge', 'hit', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'man', 'was', 'aware', 'many', 'family', 'friends', 'attest', 'fascinating', 'film', 'many', 'musical', 'geniuses', 'Nilsson', 'music', 'was', 'difficult', 'categorize', 'was', 'extremely', 'complex', 'person', 'also', 'fought', 'fame', 'many', 'musicians', 'admire', 'did', 'one', 'way', 'fought', 'such', 'extreme', 'way', 'basically', 'destroyed', 'voice', 'purpose', 'were', 'lot', 'sad', 'aspects', 'life', 'smiles', 'friends', 'interviews', 'even', 'funeral', 'said', 'documentary', 'was', 'riveting', 'gave', 'lump', 'throat', 'several', 'times', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'saw', 'hope', 'many', 'more', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'recognize', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'underappreciated', 'lifetime', 'due']",N/A

He was almost a second Beatle, befriended by Ringo and John when both were in their alcoholic phases, like Nilsson who was to die young of self-destruction. This documentary doesn't gloss over the darker side of Nilsson, but it also thoroughly tells the tale of one of the major songwriters of his generation, who also happened to be the best interpreter of his songs with a high pitched voice like an angel. Harry never really rocked much. He didn't even write his two biggest hits: ""Everybody's Talkin' "" and ""Without You."" He was more of a wordsmith who liked to sing ballads, including an entire album of string-drenched standards, done before that was trendy a few years later.

What you get here is an entertaining account of a man who came from a humble background and was always haunted by his father's desertion and the insecurities that fueled some of his self-desctructive behavior.  You also see a man with a great vocal instrument and clever songs in both lyric and melody.He gave us great music that often sounded McCartney-ish and Lennon-esque, but still managed to sound like Harry Nilsson.  You see the great friendship he had with both Lennon and Ringo Starr, also nice input from fellow songwriters such as Jimmy Webb and Randy Newman.  You have input from two of his former wives and children, but the thing that is most effective is every moment they speak to his oldest son who obviously both loved and felt hurt by his long absences.  I love the story about him and Lennon heckling the Smothers Brothers.  It's priceless!  Funny, sad, and intriguing, this biopic shows all sides of a very complex and talented man who managed to redeem himself at the end of his life.  His creativity was amazing, his talent enormous; it's just too bad he had such an appetite for self-destruction, but nobody is perfect or they wouldn't be half as interesting.

Although it sounds like a query of purpose, I think that question - ""Who is Harry Nilsson and why is everybody talking about him?"" - is the film's conclusion.  The most esteemed talents in the arts are Harry Nilsson fans, but does anyone understand the man?Director John Scheinfeld does not give himself a head start, making WHO IS HARRY NILSSON? over a decade after the singer-songwriter's untimely 1994 death.  The best Scheinfeld can do is present original discussions with the artist's family, friends, and admirers while relying on film archive and audio recordings of Nilsson for the rest of the story.I own half a dozen Nilsson albums, having picked up on him from both his music on the radio and being a Beatles fan noting Nilsson's contributions to Ringo Starr's and John Lennon's records and theirs to his. WHO IS HARRY NILSSON? leaves me thinking Nilsson's association with the Beatles may have been both a blessing and a curse to his career.  John Lennon's and Paul McCartney's late 1960s public admiration of Nilsson help his songs get on the radio.  But being the pal of the biggest band in history, Nilsson lets music fans forget what he's all about.  Had the Beatles kept their appreciation private, Nilsson's talent probably would have led to commercial success on it own terms anyway, maybe even greater than it was with a little help from those friends.  We'll never know.Nor may we ever find out what happens when Harry Nilsson visits the Beatles in England, as according to his record producer Rick Jarrard, he returns home to America a changed man.  WHO IS HARRY NILSSON? does not explore the topic beyond that but perhaps another of its interview subjects, musician and Nilsson cousin Doug Hoefer, lets us add one plus one by recalling Nilsson was tight-lipped about his feelings.Harry Nilsson does not help establish his public persona by never touring, WHO IS HARRY NILSSON? reminds us.  With desertion by his father when Nilsson was age 3, two broken marriages, and alcoholism, we can guess why Nilsson seeks to communicate through his music while retreating as a person.  But it would only be a guess, lest armchair psychologists have something to say.What a damned shame we lost Harry Nilsson so young.  This documentary explains his shot voice would never allow him to have a hit record again, but who knows what great songs Nilsson had yet to compose.Did I miss it, or does WHO IS HARRY NILSSON? neglect to mention as well-known a Nilsson contribution as any, his theme song for television's THE COURTSHIP OF EDDIE'S FATHER?Regarding Harry Nilsson's album of standards A LITTLE TOUCH OF SCHMILSSON IN THE NIGHT, one or two in WHO IS HARRY NILSSON? make it sound as though Nilsson was the first in the rock 'n roll era to make such a record.  However, Ringo Starr, of all people, did the same several years before Nilsson with his album SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY.I feel bad for Harry Nilsson's first two wives, at least in the context of this documentary.  When Nilsson dies, we see only his third wife Una getting public support, as if the first two do not exist.If nothing else, here's hoping WHO IS HARRY NILSSON? earns Nilsson some new fans and inspires older music lovers to place those records back on their turntables.  This documentary may not help you fathom Harry Nilsson, but you have to respect a recording artist who chooses a blurry photo of himself wearing a bathrobe as the album cover of what would be his signature release - and makes fun of his own name by titling it NILSSON SCHMILSSON.See WHO IS HARRY NILSSON (AND WHY IS EVERYBODY TALKIN' ABOUT HIM)?.",4,Without understanding,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,3702,"['documentary', 'WHO', 'IS', 'HARRY', 'NILSSON', 'AND', 'WHY', 'IS', 'EVERYBODY', 'TALKIN', 'ABOUT', 'HIM', 'title', 'query', 'purpose', 'think', 'question', 'Who', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'why', 'everybody', 'talking', 'film', 'conclusion', 'most', 'esteemed', 'talents', 'arts', 'are', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'fans', 'anyone', 'understand', 'man', 'Director', 'John', 'Scheinfeld', 'not', 'give', 'head', 'start', 'making', 'WHO', 'IS', 'HARRY', 'NILSSON', 'decade', 'singer-songwriter', 'untimely', '1994', 'death', 'best', 'Scheinfeld', 'can', 'do', 'present', 'original', 'discussions', 'artist', 'family', 'friends', 'admirers', 'relying', 'film', 'archive', 'audio', 'recordings', 'Nilsson', 'rest', 'story.I', 'own', 'half', 'dozen', 'Nilsson', 'albums', 'having', 'picked', 'up', 'music', 'radio', 'being', 'Beatles', 'fan', 'noting', 'Nilsson', 'contributions', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'John', 'Lennon', 'records', 'WHO', 'HARRY', 'NILSSON', 'thinking', 'Nilsson', 'association', 'Beatles', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'blessing', 'curse', 'career', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'late', '1960s', 'public', 'admiration', 'Nilsson', 'help', 'songs', 'get', 'radio', 'being', 'pal', 'biggest', 'band', 'history', 'Nilsson', 'music', 'fans', 'forget', 'what', 'Had', 'Beatles', 'kept', 'appreciation', 'private', 'Nilsson', 'talent', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'commercial', 'success', 'own', 'terms', 'anyway', 'maybe', 'even', 'greater', 'was', 'little', 'help', 'friends', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know.Nor', 'may', 'ever', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'when', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'Beatles', 'England', 'according', 'record', 'producer', 'Rick', 'Jarrard', 'home', 'America', 'changed', 'man', 'WHO', 'HARRY', 'NILSSON', 'not', 'explore', 'topic', 'perhaps', 'interview', 'subjects', 'musician', 'Nilsson', 'cousin', 'Doug', 'Hoefer', 'add', 'one', 'one', 'recalling', 'Nilsson', 'was', 'tight-lipped', 'feelings.Harry', 'Nilsson', 'not', 'help', 'establish', 'public', 'persona', 'never', 'touring', 'WHO', 'HARRY', 'NILSSON', 'desertion', 'father', 'when', 'Nilsson', 'was', 'age', '3', 'two', 'broken', 'marriages', 'alcoholism', 'can', 'guess', 'why', 'Nilsson', 'communicate', 'music', 'retreating', 'person', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'guess', 'lest', 'armchair', 'psychologists', 'have', 'something', 'say.What', 'damned', 'shame', 'lost', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'so', 'young', 'documentary', 'shot', 'voice', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'have', 'hit', 'record', 'again', 'who', 'what', 'great', 'songs', 'Nilsson', 'had', 'yet', 'compose.Did', 'miss', 'WHO', 'IS', 'HARRY', 'NILSSON', 'neglect', 'mention', 'well-known', 'Nilsson', 'contribution', 'theme', 'song', 'television', 'THE', 'COURTSHIP', 'OF', 'EDDIE', 'FATHER', 'Regarding', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'album', 'standards', 'A', 'LITTLE', 'TOUCH', 'OF', 'SCHMILSSON', 'IN', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'one', 'two', 'WHO', 'IS', 'HARRY', 'NILSSON', 'make', 'sound', 'Nilsson', 'was', 'first', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'era', 'make', 'such', 'record', 'However', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'people', 'did', 'same', 'several', 'years', 'Nilsson', 'album', 'SENTIMENTAL', 'JOURNEY.I', 'feel', 'bad', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'first', 'two', 'wives', 'least', 'context', 'documentary', 'When', 'Nilsson', 'see', 'only', 'third', 'wife', 'Una', 'getting', 'public', 'support', 'first', 'two', 'do', 'not', 'exist.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'here', 'hoping', 'WHO', 'IS', 'HARRY', 'NILSSON', 'Nilsson', 'new', 'fans', 'inspires', 'older', 'music', 'lovers', 'place', 'records', 'back', 'turntables', 'documentary', 'may', 'not', 'help', 'fathom', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'have', 'respect', 'recording', 'artist', 'who', 'blurry', 'photo', 'wearing', 'bathrobe', 'album', 'cover', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'signature', 'release', 'fun', 'own', 'name', 'titling', 'NILSSON', 'SCHMILSSON.See', 'WHO', 'IS', 'HARRY', 'NILSSON', 'AND', 'WHY', 'IS', 'EVERYBODY', 'TALKIN', 'ABOUT', 'HIM']",N/A

Coming from a dirt poor background Harry Nilsson rose to stardom in an unusual way.  His first hits came in the 1960's for both himself and for songs he wrote for others.  While very successful he never took his beautiful voice on the road to promote albums.  Various individuals close to Harry speculated on why but there were so many opinions it's still unclear.  This doesn't mean that Nilsson didn't raise hell; he did which led to his ultimate death.  Along the way, he became best friends with The Beatles, Jimmy Webb, Robin Williams, Micky Dolenz and numerous others.It is clear from watching this documentary that Nilsson had untold admirers who believed and respected his talent.  Yet it is also clear that he never reached his potential with strange career choices along the way.  Director John Scheinfeld assembles those who knew him best including all his children and former wives to discuss his successes, his failures and his self-destructive behavior.

1368044,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B003VZNAUS,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[6, 6]","I've been waiting anxiously over the years for some kind of documentary on, who I already knew was a music genius; A video portrait of the legendary Harry Nilsson.  With my already knowing that Harry was favored by all the members of The Beatles, I don't know why it seemed like Nilsson was just discarded as some kind of insignificant contribution to American music.Back in '72, I remember having the red and black RCA 45 single of ""Coconut"" and then years later, an album called ""Nilsson's Greatest Hits.""  I've always known the song ""Without You"" but for the longest time I didn't know who it was, and in fact, I was surprised to learn that it was from the same guy who sang ""Coconut', and that ""Coconut"" and ""Without You"" were on the same original album.  As a kid, I remember hearing ""Me and My Arrow"" on CKLW radio back in Detroit.  And when I was in Oregon for one year, I heard ""Daybreak"" which was probably his last charted Top 40 single.  So, around 1980, ""Nilsson's Greatest Hits"" was one of my favorite best of albums along side of ""Wings Greatest"" and ""Nancy's (Sinatra) Greatest Hits.""""Nilsson Schmilsson"" was one of my first CD's that I bought in the eighties and so all these other non-hits on this album were just phenomenal!  I knew then that he was a genius, but nobody else I knew really remembered who he was.  Over time, his albums were released on to CD, many were Japanese imports at first.  And I bought all the ones that were available.  I spent like 35 dollars each for CD's that were barely a half hour's worth of music.  But, I had to have the music of Harry Nilsson.  He was still alive, at the time, but it seemed like he was already gone and forgotten.  For the past 30 years or so, I thought that I was the only person in the world who remembered Harry Nilsson, because, at the time, nobody was talking about him.Then comes this new DVD documentary.  And look at all the important celebrities who remember Harry and who all had loving cherishable memories of such a wonderful man.  This is a great 2 hour documentary of the rise and fall of this rather self-destructive genius.  It's heartbreaking knowing that he could have been so much more than what he became, but like anything else, drugs, smoking, and alcohol can be anybody's downward spiral.As extras on this DVD, you'll get a few extra snippets of people sharing their personal memories of Harry Nilsson.  Some were heartfelt and loving, and then some were rants about his recklessness and misbehavior over the years.  All of which contribute to understanding this tortured soul who was recognized with having such a wonderful, talented, and velvety voice.  And being such a wonderful songwriter as well.

Tommy Smothers hit it on the head when he said either you knew instantly who he was or didn't have a clue. To those last folks its quite a shame and they are missing out. To these younger crowd you mention Harry's name and they probably don't know who you'e talking about. Then you give them a clue and mention the Coconut Song. Their eyes will invariably light up and say, Oh, did he write that song? I know that one! This, sadly, is what harry Nilsson means to the younger crowd today.But he was more, so much more. He was an extremely talented songwriter and at his height had better phrasing than Sinatra. His is, alas, one of the great tragedies of the greats of the SIxties, otherwise talented muscians who could not control their intake of choice. So he just dwindled away oh so ever slowly, drinking himself to death, so when he did actually pass away, one would read the news in Rolling Stone and say, I didn't even know he was alive. Well, this DVD brings him back to life.... Now my only question is when are they going to release Son of Dracula?Having said all this ---  This is a warning to all concerned that the bonus material link does not work.

His was one of the most amazing recorded voices in the 60's and 70's.But the title to this documentary is double meaning-ed.  For Nilsson was as much of an artist as he was an entertainer - and John Scheinfeld does an excellent job of not just documenting a man's life but also an artist's journey.Nilsson, whose funeral took place on the same day as the Northridge Earthquake in California, appears during the film in some voice-over bits, but the story is mostly told through interviews with colleagues, friends, and family.  This is no ordinary bio-pic, there is some very real hurt and frustration in some interviewees (particularly colleagues) as they recall Nilsson's self-destructive behavior especially as it laid waste to his artistic gifts.But the greatest artistic creation is one's own life and Nilsson's was filled with improbably moments from his managing millions of dollars of bank transactions, to being names the Beatles' favorite ""group"", to John Lennon negotiating a record deal on behalf of his good friend, to becoming a full-time political activist for handgun control.  And yet, at its center, the story is about a very human artist.And that's the real mystery of Harry Nilsson.  At once, his talents have an other worldliness to them while he struggles, in an all too human fashion, to find ways of dealing with the great pain that life has thrown at him.If you want to ponder an artistic journey, and enjoy some great music to boot, see this film.  At the end, you may not fully know who is Harry Nilsson, but you will surely understand why everyone is talking about him.",5,Portrait of a Young Man as an Artist,1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,1872,"['less', 'talent', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'talks', 'people', 'melodic', 'gifts', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Elton', 'John', 'Harry', 'Nilsson.Harry', 'Nilsson', 'A', 'great', 'many', 'people', 'now', 'ask', 'question', 'Who', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'do', 'probable', 'know', 'Nilsson', 'song', 'two', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'recorded', 'voices', '60', ""70's.But"", 'title', 'documentary', 'double', 'meaning-ed', 'Nilsson', 'was', 'much', 'artist', 'was', 'entertainer', 'John', 'Scheinfeld', 'excellent', 'job', 'not', 'just', 'documenting', 'man', 'life', 'also', 'artist', 'journey.Nilsson', 'funeral', 'took', 'place', 'same', 'day', 'Northridge', 'Earthquake', 'California', 'film', 'voice-over', 'bits', 'story', 'mostly', 'told', 'interviews', 'colleagues', 'friends', 'family', 'ordinary', 'bio-pic', 'very', 'real', 'hurt', 'frustration', 'interviewees', 'particularly', 'colleagues', 'recall', 'Nilsson', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'especially', 'laid', 'waste', 'artistic', 'gifts.But', 'greatest', 'artistic', 'creation', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'Nilsson', 'was', 'filled', 'improbably', 'moments', 'managing', 'millions', 'dollars', 'bank', 'transactions', 'being', 'names', 'Beatles', 'favorite', 'group', 'John', 'Lennon', 'negotiating', 'record', 'deal', 'behalf', 'good', 'friend', 'becoming', 'full-time', 'political', 'activist', 'handgun', 'control', 'yet', 'center', 'story', 'very', 'human', 'artist.And', 'real', 'mystery', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'once', 'talents', 'have', 'other', 'worldliness', 'too', 'human', 'fashion', 'find', 'ways', 'dealing', 'great', 'pain', 'life', 'thrown', 'him.If', 'want', 'ponder', 'artistic', 'journey', 'enjoy', 'great', 'music', 'boot', 'see', 'film', 'end', 'may', 'not', 'fully', 'know', 'who', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'will', 'surely', 'understand', 'why', 'everyone', 'talking']",N/A

Harry's career took off quickly once The Beatles named him their favorite ""band"" (thanks to Derek Taylor introducing them to Harry's music). He also wrote a number of songs that were recorded by other artists (including The Monkees)but Harry's career became white hot when he recorded Fred Neil's ""Everybody's Talking at Me"" and it was featured in ""Midnight Cowboy"". He went from strength to strength with his kids album/TV cartoon ""The Point!"" to ""Nilsson Schmilsson"" which featured his cover of Badfinger's ""Without You"" turning the powerhouse ballad into a huge hit.Pretty darn good for someone who almost never did concert appearences or toured (he did do some one off appearences at Beatlefest, etc.)Harry had a turbulent life. His father left his family when Harry was small creating a major gap in his life and the self destructive behavior had been mirrored by both his parents previously.This terrific documentary covers the lost years as well--the period of time when drugs and drink took their toll on Harry's long lost weekend with John Lennon. It also addresses the damage to Nilsson's voice, in discussing his childhood how his feeling of abandonment impacted him as both a person and artist and features rare home movie footage, footage from his TV appearences and interviews with those who knew him best.The DVD features deleted footage and interviews giving even more insight into Harry as an artist and musician. I was glad to see Stephen King highlight this powerful and sometimes heartbreaking documentary in his Entertainment Weekly column from a couple of weeks ago. Maybe with this DVD and King's promotional efforts for the film Harry will get just ""a touch"" of the recognition that he had when he was alive and in his prime.

1368053,A218HWVG3OAM92,B003VZNAUS,"William M. Feagin ""A thousand miles can lead ...","[1, 1]","&#34;Who is Harry Nilsson (And Why is Everybody Talkin' About Him)?&#34; may be one of the best documentaries of a rock star's life I've ever seen.  Nilsson is presented here by many friends and fellow travellers as a sympathetic but somewhat dangerous character - &#34;He was a bunny rabbit with big, sharp teeth!&#34;  His life, from troubled childhood (father left when he was very young, raised by his mother who was an alcoholic and something of a party animal, which Harry himself would become) through his rise and fall as a recording artist, is a familiar story - somehow, we all know somebody like this.  Despite whatever character flaws Harry may have had, there is nothing to suggest that he wasn't likable; indeed, I found myself wishing I'd known him (although I have no idea how my liver might have survived such a relationship!).There are a few areas where I wish they could have added something - I'd like to have known how he felt about having a #1 single with &#34;Without You&#34; when its writers, the Welsh rock band Badfinger (and specifically Pete Ham and Tom Evans), were utterly screwed out of seeing even a penny in royalties - but otherwise, for a film coming in at just a shade under 2 hours, what they've made encompasses Harry's life quite completely and lovingly.  It begins with Dustin Hoffman offering a tribute to Harry (Hoffman, of course, was one of the stars of &#34;Midnight Cowboy,&#34; which featured Harry's other big hit single, &#34;Everybody's Talkin',&#34; which peaked at #6 in the Billboard chart) on the evening following Nilsson's too-early passing (heart attack).  We see Harry's childhood in New York City - specifically Brooklyn - his move to L.A. to pursue his muse while working in a bank to make ends meet, his relationships with his producers Rick Jarrard (who was a staff producer at RCA, Nilsson's label from 1967-77) and Richard Perry (who wanted artistic control of his recording sessions), and two of his three wives (the first, a brief marriage in the early '60s, gets only a short mention) - Diane, his second wife and the mother of his son, Zack; and Una, his third wife (and a clear case of &#34;third time's the charm,&#34; as they were together for about 20 years and had 5 children together, 3 of whom also talk about their famous father).And as I said before, he is presented sympathetically throughout - he seems to have unintentionally sabotaged his second marriage (Diane's impressions seem filled with regret) and his own recording career (RCA paid him off to leave the label in 1977 because they didn't like the records he was making anymore), and his apparent stage fright, reinforced by an early performance that didn't go well, caused him to scorn the idea of touring.  This latter, of course, allowed him to be a better husband to Una and father to their children, but there's a sense of missed opportunity throughout, if only Harry could have conquered his demons (the ones which made him write the vituperative, F-bomb-laced &#34;You're Breakin' My Heart&#34; after his marriage to Diane ended, and conduct the somewhat uncomfortable session for &#34;I'd Rather Be Dead&#34; with a group of seniors singing chorus backup to Harry and his band).  Yet his sucesses and high points are there, celebrated, and although Harry is no longer with us, you get the sense that, if he had to do it all again, he'd do it the same way.Definitely recommended!",5,A well-done documentary,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,3424,"['34', 'Who', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'Why', 'Everybody', 'Talkin', 'Him', '34', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'documentaries', 'rock', 'star', 'life', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Nilsson', 'presented', 'here', 'many', 'friends', 'fellow', 'travellers', 'sympathetic', 'somewhat', 'dangerous', 'character', '34', 'was', 'bunny', 'rabbit', 'big', 'sharp', 'teeth', '34', 'life', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'father', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'raised', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'something', 'party', 'animal', 'Harry', 'would', 'become', 'rise', 'fall', 'recording', 'artist', 'familiar', 'story', 'somehow', 'know', 'somebody', 'character', 'flaws', 'Harry', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'nothing', 'suggest', 'was', ""n't"", 'likable', 'indeed', 'found', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'known', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'liver', 'might', 'have', 'survived', 'relationship', 'are', 'few', 'areas', 'where', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'something', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'known', 'how', 'felt', 'having', '1', 'single', '34', '34', 'when', 'writers', 'Welsh', 'rock', 'band', 'Badfinger', 'specifically', 'Pete', 'Ham', 'Tom', 'Evans', 'were', 'utterly', 'screwed', 'seeing', 'even', 'penny', 'royalties', 'otherwise', 'film', 'coming', 'just', 'shade', '2', 'hours', 'what', ""'ve"", 'made', 'encompasses', 'Harry', 'life', 'quite', 'completely', 'lovingly', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'offering', 'tribute', 'Harry', 'Hoffman', 'course', 'was', 'one', 'stars', '34', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', '34', 'featured', 'Harry', 'other', 'big', 'hit', 'single', '34', 'Everybody', 'Talkin', '34', 'peaked', '6', 'Billboard', 'chart', 'evening', 'following', 'Nilsson', 'too-early', 'passing', 'heart', 'attack', 'see', 'Harry', 'childhood', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'specifically', 'Brooklyn', 'move', 'L.A.', 'pursue', 'muse', 'working', 'bank', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'relationships', 'producers', 'Rick', 'Jarrard', 'who', 'was', 'staff', 'producer', 'RCA', 'Nilsson', 'label', '1967-77', 'Richard', 'Perry', 'who', 'wanted', 'artistic', 'control', 'recording', 'sessions', 'two', 'three', 'wives', 'first', 'brief', 'marriage', 'early', ""'60s"", 'only', 'short', 'mention', 'Diane', 'second', 'wife', 'mother', 'son', 'Zack', 'Una', 'third', 'wife', 'clear', 'case', '34', 'third', 'time', 'charm', '34', 'were', 'together', 'about', '20', 'years', 'had', '5', 'children', 'together', '3', 'whom', 'also', 'talk', 'famous', 'father', '.And', 'said', 'before', 'presented', 'sympathetically', 'have', 'unintentionally', 'sabotaged', 'second', 'marriage', 'Diane', 'impressions', 'seem', 'filled', 'regret', 'own', 'recording', 'career', 'RCA', 'paid', 'off', 'leave', 'label', '1977', 'did', ""n't"", 'records', 'was', 'making', 'anymore', 'apparent', 'stage', 'fright', 'reinforced', 'early', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'caused', 'scorn', 'idea', 'touring', 'latter', 'course', 'allowed', 'be', 'better', 'husband', 'Una', 'father', 'children', 'sense', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'only', 'Harry', 'could', 'have', 'conquered', 'demons', 'ones', 'made', 'write', 'vituperative', 'F-bomb-laced', '34', ""'re"", 'Breakin', 'My', 'Heart', '34', 'marriage', 'Diane', 'ended', 'conduct', 'somewhat', 'uncomfortable', 'session', '34', ""'d"", 'Rather', 'Be', 'Dead', '34', 'group', 'seniors', 'singing', 'chorus', 'backup', 'Harry', 'band', 'sucesses', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'there', 'celebrated', 'Harry', 'longer', 'get', 'sense', 'had', 'do', 'again', ""'d"", 'do', 'same', 'way.Definitely', 'recommended']",N/A
