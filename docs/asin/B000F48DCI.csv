But I did not find this DVD as funny as I expected it.Yes, O'Connolly is unpredictable, but not ""Robin Williams"" umpredictable. It seems more as if he rambles around, goes on the tangent and forgets what he was talking about, and then his jokes lose momentum.Something no one has mentioned is that the producers did not put a lot of effort in the CD. There are no ""Chapters"" to identify the main themes of the show. For foreign speakers or hearing impaired, there are no closed captions. There are no extras. Nothing. It's just a DVD which says ""Play"", and there you go...Hopefully this helps you in your decision.",2,I was a little disappointed...,1159315200,"09 27, 2006",2006,680,"['had', 'been', 'while', 'had', 'heard', 'jokes', 'standup', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'DVD', 'as', 'funny', 'expected', 'it.Yes', ""O'Connolly"", 'unpredictable', 'not', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'umpredictable', 'more', 'around', 'tangent', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'then', 'jokes', 'lose', 'momentum.Something', 'one', 'mentioned', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'lot', 'effort', 'CD', 'are', 'Chapters', 'identify', 'main', 'themes', 'show', 'foreign', 'speakers', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'are', 'closed', 'captions', 'are', 'extras', 'Nothing', 'just', 'DVD', 'Play', 'there', 'go', 'Hopefully', 'decision']",Billy Connolly: Live in New York

One reviewer lambastes this video because it's full of jokes Billy's told before, while another rates it down because it's not the jokes he heard on the tour this DVD is drawn from.  Hmm.  One person dislikes this video because it's the same old stuff, while another dislikes it because it ISN'T the same old stuff.  How much easier if we consider this DVD for itself.Is it funny?  Yes.  Is it up to the level of humor that propelled Billy to international fame?  Yes.  Is it springy enough to bear up to multiple viewings?  Yes.  Would I go out of my way to recommend this DVD to my friends?  Yes.  What more could you ask for from a comedy DVD?Part of what makes this DVD in particular, and Billy Connolly in general, funny and worth watching, is his willingness to take risks, gamble on the audience's loyalty, and push boundaries.  When he's telling a story about his sister and suddenly veers off for several minutes about the jabbering verbosity of opera, he risks that you might get confused and simply stop watching.  But it is this risk-taking that has made him so popular for so long, and has kept him creating new generations of fans long after other comics have lapsed into obscurity.One possible problem with this DVD is that there are no added features.  No backstage cameras, no interviews, no career retrospectives.  For a full DVD price, this seems kind of cheapskate.  I'm sure Billy would make some jokes about Scottish stereotypes, but still, DVDs are expensive, and I'd like to get what I'm paying for.  Still, as many times as I've watched the performance itself, perhaps I really am getting what I payed for.This is definitely the work of an elder statesman of comedy, bringing the full weight of a long career to bear.  It's hard to imagine a young man performing this material.  But it's not sentimental or maudlin; Billy has the gravity of a patron saint of humor, but the explosive energy of a much younger man.  Serving both as a continuation of a long and storied career and as a good introduction for new fans, this DVD is a treasure, and one you'll watch and watch again.  Highly recommended.",5,He's Going Away!

982627,ALTHFY37K4KIK,B000F48DCI,Kritik,"[1, 10]","Billy Connolly: Live in New York is a poor recording of his comedic talent both artistically and professionally.  The stage set looks drab and poorly lit, much like an amateur would do on his first chance of recording finger puppets for a kindergarten class.  The comedian's appearance matches that of the set, leaving his grey hair standing out as if he just stepped out of the shower.  His comedy material seems impromptu, with digressions that never establishes ""The Roll"" in any of his comedy bits, stories or subjects, throughout his comedy act.  To be frank, I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through the DVD and decided to use the DVD as a beverage coaster instead.I originally purchased the DVD based upon samples of his material I've heard from Satellite Radio, and I believe that there are far better recordings of this artist besides this DVD title.",1,Not Funny,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,855,"['Billy', 'Connolly', 'Live', 'New', 'York', 'poor', 'recording', 'comedic', 'talent', 'artistically', 'professionally', 'stage', 'set', 'drab', 'poorly', 'lit', 'much', 'amateur', 'would', 'do', 'first', 'chance', 'recording', 'finger', 'puppets', 'kindergarten', 'class', 'comedian', 'appearance', 'matches', 'set', 'leaving', 'grey', 'hair', 'standing', 'out', 'just', 'stepped', 'shower', 'comedy', 'material', 'impromptu', 'digressions', 'never', 'Roll', 'comedy', 'bits', 'stories', 'subjects', 'comedy', 'act', 'be', 'frank', 'fell', 'asleep', '3/4', 'way', 'DVD', 'decided', 'use', 'DVD', 'beverage', 'coaster', 'instead.I', 'originally', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'based', 'samples', 'material', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Satellite', 'Radio', 'believe', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'recordings', 'artist', 'DVD', 'title']",Billy Connolly: Live in New York
