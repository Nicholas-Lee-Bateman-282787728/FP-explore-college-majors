Sometimes there are men who are really gay, but simply follow the herd and confirm to societal norms.

At every turn, he is confronted and cannot avoid the reality of his struggle.

1689891,A31ELTOVZM5JHR,B00HHYF5EI,C. Rothlind,"[1, 4]","Freier Fall, in which two ostensibly straight males fall into bouts of illicit lovemaking in inhospitable locations, plays like an adolescent homosex phantasy. It's accordingly derivative and predictable, like most films that put homosexual arousal center stage, then figure out a scenario that will make the inevitable lip-locking as implausible as possible for the biggest pay-off. With rare exceptions (Marco Berger's Plan B comes to mind) this inevitable meeting of mucus membranes eventuates with the suddenness of an act of desperate violence. To that end Stephen Lacant spends an inordinate amount of time establishing the masculine bone fides of the protagonists, to such an extent that it threatens to become the main focus of the film. Given the plasticity of the male sexual response in homosocial environments, the scenario of two police cadets getting the hots for one another is not incredible--but neither is it novel or particularly interesting. Lacant has merely produced his version of the standard doomed gay romance. Films dealing with homosexual persecution and paranoia have been made since the 1970s (Wolfgang Peterson's Die Konsequenz and Claude Miller's The Best Way to Walk come to mind)--with greater nuance and humanity. The experience of inconvenient homoerotic arousal in and of itself is an insufficient thematic for average filmmakers, I don't care how much splicing and edgy verit&eacute; stylization its packaged in. Protagonists whose sole purpose is to channel anomalous sexual predilections wind up as ciphers of animal mediocrity.Freier Fall's similarity to Brokeback Mountain has been remarked upon. I would draw parallels with another recent film about illicit homosexual bonding, Nicolo Donato's disturbing Broderskab (Brotherhood 2009). Again, the comparison is to the detriment of the formulaic Freier Fall. Donato's film was vastly superior because the homosexual attraction wasn't front & center, but one factor in a complex of engaging, if rather horrifying, themes.Max Riemelt, who plays Kay is a telegenic and engaging presence on screen, if not quite in the league of Volker Bruch in terms of intensity. Hanno Koffler as the repressed (or just clueless?) Marc broods with the best of them, but has the physicality of a Guinea Pig on steroids. A walking muscle-mass with tunnel vision, hair-trigger fuse, and a lecherous-malign glint in his eyes, he resembles a figure out of a Lucas Cranach portrait. Yet for all his irascibility, borderline autism, and  inarticulacy, he's not particularly spirited.With cortisol surges and the fight-flight reflex dictating events, flying fists and sudden retreat are the inevitable outcome of every encounter that doesn't end in furtive homosex. I get that these two are struggling with illicit desires in a no-win situation, but their inability to converse with one another as persons radically limits their appeal. That well-spokenness kills the mood of rude and randy man-on-manism seems to be a generally accepted fact among primitivists and pornographers, but give me a break. These two academy trainees spend all their time either working out, fighting, or having sex. (You know, like real men...) Oh, and Marc has a pregnant girlfriend who turns into an real nag when his interest wanes, sealing the deal of his straight-arrow credentials.Romance risks comedy when it confronts lovers with the necessity of its normalization. Once domesticated passionate partnerships generally transform into delicate, maintenance intensive stand-offs. Kay and Marc, inhabiting the realm of non-negotiable erotic impulses, never get that far. Their relationship, while tested by divided loyalties, lacks the civilizing dimension of habit and the intimacy of two minds meeting in sympathy. It remains a conflict (fight) resolved by the (SPOILERS!) sudden absconding (flight) of one of the partners.",2,Passion--it's never enough.,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,3873,"['Freier', 'Fall', 'two', 'ostensibly', 'straight', 'males', 'fall', 'bouts', 'illicit', 'lovemaking', 'inhospitable', 'locations', 'plays', 'adolescent', 'homosex', 'phantasy', 'accordingly', 'derivative', 'predictable', 'most', 'films', 'put', 'homosexual', 'arousal', 'center', 'stage', 'then', 'figure', 'out', 'scenario', 'will', 'make', 'inevitable', 'lip-locking', 'as', 'implausible', 'possible', 'biggest', 'pay-off', 'rare', 'exceptions', 'Marco', 'Berger', 'Plan', 'B', 'mind', 'inevitable', 'meeting', 'mucus', 'membranes', 'suddenness', 'act', 'desperate', 'violence', 'end', 'Stephen', 'Lacant', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'establishing', 'masculine', 'bone', 'fides', 'protagonists', 'extent', 'become', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'Given', 'plasticity', 'male', 'sexual', 'response', 'homosocial', 'environments', 'scenario', 'two', 'police', 'cadets', 'getting', 'hots', 'one', 'not', 'incredible', 'novel', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'Lacant', 'merely', 'produced', 'version', 'standard', 'doomed', 'gay', 'romance', 'Films', 'dealing', 'homosexual', 'persecution', 'paranoia', 'have', 'been', 'made', '1970s', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'Die', 'Konsequenz', 'Claude', 'Miller', 'Best', 'Way', 'Walk', 'come', 'mind', 'greater', 'nuance', 'humanity', 'experience', 'inconvenient', 'homoerotic', 'arousal', 'insufficient', 'thematic', 'average', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'much', 'splicing', 'edgy', 'verit', 'eacute', 'stylization', 'packaged', 'Protagonists', 'sole', 'purpose', 'channel', 'anomalous', 'sexual', 'predilections', 'wind', 'up', 'ciphers', 'animal', 'mediocrity.Freier', 'Fall', 'similarity', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'been', 'remarked', 'would', 'draw', 'parallels', 'recent', 'film', 'illicit', 'homosexual', 'bonding', 'Nicolo', 'Donato', 'disturbing', 'Broderskab', 'Brotherhood', '2009', 'Again', 'comparison', 'detriment', 'formulaic', 'Freier', 'Fall', 'Donato', 'film', 'was', 'vastly', 'superior', 'homosexual', 'attraction', 'was', ""n't"", 'front', 'center', 'one', 'factor', 'complex', 'engaging', 'rather', 'horrifying', 'themes.Max', 'Riemelt', 'who', 'Kay', 'telegenic', 'engaging', 'presence', 'screen', 'not', 'quite', 'league', 'Volker', 'Bruch', 'terms', 'intensity', 'Hanno', 'Koffler', 'repressed', 'just', 'clueless', 'Marc', 'broods', 'best', 'physicality', 'Guinea', 'Pig', 'steroids', 'walking', 'muscle-mass', 'tunnel', 'vision', 'hair-trigger', 'fuse', 'lecherous-malign', 'glint', 'eyes', 'figure', 'Lucas', 'Cranach', 'portrait', 'irascibility', 'borderline', 'autism', 'inarticulacy', 'not', 'particularly', 'spirited.With', 'cortisol', 'surges', 'fight-flight', 'reflex', 'dictating', 'events', 'flying', 'fists', 'sudden', 'retreat', 'are', 'inevitable', 'outcome', 'encounter', ""n't"", 'end', 'furtive', 'homosex', 'get', 'two', 'are', 'struggling', 'illicit', 'desires', 'no-win', 'situation', 'inability', 'converse', 'one', 'persons', 'radically', 'limits', 'appeal', 'well-spokenness', 'mood', 'rude', 'randy', 'man-on-manism', 'be', 'generally', 'accepted', 'fact', 'primitivists', 'pornographers', 'give', 'break', 'two', 'academy', 'trainees', 'spend', 'time', 'working', 'out', 'fighting', 'having', 'sex', 'know', 'real', 'men', 'Oh', 'Marc', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'real', 'nag', 'when', 'interest', 'wanes', 'sealing', 'deal', 'straight-arrow', 'credentials.Romance', 'risks', 'comedy', 'when', 'lovers', 'necessity', 'normalization', 'Once', 'domesticated', 'passionate', 'partnerships', 'generally', 'transform', 'delicate', 'maintenance', 'intensive', 'stand-offs', 'Kay', 'Marc', 'inhabiting', 'realm', 'non-negotiable', 'erotic', 'impulses', 'never', 'get', 'far', 'relationship', 'tested', 'divided', 'loyalties', 'civilizing', 'dimension', 'habit', 'intimacy', 'two', 'minds', 'meeting', 'sympathy', 'conflict', 'fight', 'resolved', 'SPOILERS', 'sudden', 'absconding', 'flight', 'one', 'partners']",Free Fall

1689899,A1LX3GUBXMR3RS,B00HHYF5EI,FilmFoodie,"[6, 6]","A good production but incomplete narrative & unsatisfying ending. There's not enough within this story to justify the happenings. *Maybe Spoilers* Handsome married Marc is at police academy and befriends hot, rule-bending Kay. We see Marc open to Kay's rule bending influence, but overwhelmingly we see him engaged in a happy married life with a lovely pregnant wife and supportive family. Almost randomly Kay forces himself on Marc. After some exposition of Marc's inner struggle, a sexual affair ensues. We see it coming, cause it's on the cover art for the film; but there's not enough in the story to see it coming. Later, although Kay doesn't seem the type, he professes love for Marc. After Marc's mother catches them kissing, Kay confesses his feelings to Marc's parents, when they confront him at a party at Marc's house, sooooo that's not right. The story isn't Fatal Attraction like so what gives? Obviously Marc has feelings of attachment to Kay but never confesses love for him. He denies being gay after the affair is discovered and the film even shows Marc unable to engage in sex with another guy during an emotional bottoming out. (I hate gay sex used as rock-bottom for an emotionally distressed person; as in ""Shame."") So therein lies the problem with the storytelling; What is the story telling? The unsatisfying end doesn't give closure. It gives an impression that Marc will be OK. But the good people around him and their stories are left shattered. That's not like Marc; he's no sociopath; so again, what gives? We might conclude he was suffocating in a really great life and the affair was his escape, but there was something specific for him about Kay, and nothing to indicate the emotional burden. Maybe it's a cautionary tale for ""hot for married guy"" gays; Look what your lust shall bestow! Nah, it's a story of self discovery; of the power, surprise and consequence of unexpected physical attraction, though it doesn't say so. Uptick to 3 stars for production, acting talent and many elements of the story that left me feeling a lot.

The acting is totally good, script / plot is very believable, and I was drawn into the story without hardly any thought as to the mechanics of movie making.  Both main stars, Max Riemelt and Hanno Koffler, are superb as two policemen who become star-crossed lovers.  Koffler's character, Marc  is living with his girlfriend and they are expecting a baby anytime soon, so the complications are immediate.  Katharina Sch&uuml;ttler plays Marc's girlfriend very well, with the joy of romance and imminent motherhood, and the tragedy of discovering your partner has been in an affair, all portrayed with great skill.  Supporting cast are also all quite good, and editing is seamless.  The English version has the German language with English subtitles, but the movie is so good, you'll probably forget you're reading the subtitles very quickly.  It's good to hear these actors' voices anyway.One side note:  The DVD has the two leading actor's names in the summary notes on the back cover confused with the other's role.  Also, Riemelt's name is misspelled as ""Reimelt"" in the leading paragraph of the Wolfe should correct this!

It reveals how love between two men can be so easily destroyed by society. Even in these modern times with legalized marriage for same sex partners.

As a gay male I have been with my partner for over 40 years but am still reminded by the struggle we faced  trying to survive against all odds. I wish it had ended with both police officers  living happily ever after. But reality shows its ugly face once again. The acting was so convincing that I was very much affected by the two gay police officers emotional conflicts, especially the main character who is married and is expecting his first child.

But we gay men in the West, who've been fed the same old same old same old depressing homophobic crap year after year after year, have had enough already.Like Brokeback (which I also hated) this is a movie BY straight people (on both sides of the camera) and FOR straight people, who really may be so dumb that they need to see it all over again.

I&#8217;ll say ditto to the 4 and 5 reviewers and add my bit.For me this film was about separation from the plan an individual makes when they are young, and finding out that that path is not necessarily the one which is right for you.Marc seemed to come from a family of policemen and had been groomed by that family to follow in their footsteps. Anyone who has support from their parents will understand this. Parents love by trying to make sure their child doesn&#8217;t make the mistakes they made or they saw others make. They mean well, but often don&#8217;t see who their child truly is. The child is a child so blindly follows the chosen path, until they wake up.Sometimes they wake by themselves, sometime an incident wakes them. In this case Kay woke Marc.Basically if/when you wake up, it can be painful, as you realize you are truly alone in the world. However once you make peace with that, it is ever so liberating and you are free to be who and what you chose.I believe this is why we are always told not to be in such a rush to grow up. It takes time to learn how to observe before you act. This is why many of us end up with houses, spouses and children without ever understanding that these things are not what we are looking for. Or if we do want these things, we do not take into account how much of our Selves we have to give to each of these things.As far as the gay angle, well we humans love to persecute any thing, idea or one that is different, which to me translates as if you are persecuting someone you are either jealous or afraid... Yeah,  you are a &#8220;Pussy.&#8221; Instead of lashing out, go inside and figure out what the hell scares you so much and face it. Yes, gay person here.

We meet Marc who is a cop and he has a pregnant girlfriend and what appears to be a life plan. Then at the academy he meets Kay who is more free whelin' than him and after getting off on the wrong foot they slowly hit it off.Now despite the police or polizei being all inclusive these days there is still a vast undercurrent of homophobia and this is shown and there is some violence. Soon Marc realises what he wants and moreover who he wants but societal pressures and the arrival of his new baby son are all contributing to making him want to hurt the one he really loves.This is a rather good film the two male leads are always guaranteed to put in a solid performance.  Marc is played by Hanno Kofler - `Krabat' and the excellent `Summer Storm'. Kay is played by Max Riemelt - `Napola' and `The Fourth State'. The sub titles are good to ok as they are not always a literal translation which I know some prefer but I like it told straight. This is a film that will not tick all the boxes, the ending especially may fail to deliver for some viewers; there is a limited amount of scenes of a sexual nature but nothing to frighten the horses of even a randy pony to be honest. However, this is still a very strong film with some excellent performances indeed - recommended to fans of gay themed cinema.",4,German tale of forbidden love - with coppers!,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1509,"['Released', 'Germany', 'Freir', 'Fall', 'been', 'compared', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'apart', 'being', 'man', 'who', 'gay', 'heterosexual', 'relationship', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'other', 'similarities', 'meet', 'Marc', 'who', 'cop', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'what', 'be', 'life', 'plan', 'Then', 'academy', 'Kay', 'who', 'more', 'free', 'whelin', 'getting', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'slowly', 'hit', 'police', 'polizei', 'being', 'inclusive', 'days', 'still', 'vast', 'undercurrent', 'homophobia', 'shown', 'violence', 'Soon', 'Marc', 'what', 'moreover', 'who', 'societal', 'pressures', 'arrival', 'new', 'baby', 'son', 'are', 'contributing', 'making', 'want', 'hurt', 'one', 'really', 'rather', 'good', 'film', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'always', 'guaranteed', 'put', 'solid', 'performance', 'Marc', 'played', 'Hanno', 'Kofler', 'Krabat', 'excellent', 'Summer', 'Storm', 'Kay', 'played', 'Max', 'Riemelt', 'Napola', 'Fourth', 'State', 'sub', 'titles', 'are', 'good', 'ok', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'literal', 'translation', 'know', 'prefer', 'like', 'told', 'straight', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'tick', 'boxes', 'ending', 'especially', 'may', 'fail', 'deliver', 'viewers', 'limited', 'amount', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'nature', 'nothing', 'frighten', 'horses', 'even', 'randy', 'pony', 'be', 'honest', 'However', 'still', 'very', 'strong', 'film', 'excellent', 'performances', 'indeed', 'recommended', 'fans', 'gay', 'themed', 'cinema']",Free Fall

Both are sad, sad situations with a characte, or two, layering on poor choice ontop another until there is no way out and everybody get hurt. At least no one dies inthei film, we think.It's a film with an appealing and expensicve finish which adds value to the viewing quality.The story development and the acting are superb.The actors are active, especially the blond Max, an the expressions of love and sex in very touching scenes feel real. It's what happens to the characters and the reactions from their family and community that suck. It's real life and the tale could occur anywhere, and beleive me, it does, repeatedly, and unfortunately, with the same very sad and depressing results.But, don't mind me. Be entertained, as it is entertaining and much more. Hats off to the filmmaker, actors and director.

If you are like me, it is difficult to watch a movie AND try to read quickly enough to catch the facts of what is happening; especially in German.  Yes, &#34;emotion&#34; usually is more readily conveyed, but Germans typically do not overtly display their emotions, so this too is difficult (I am of German descent).  :)Fortunately, I was able to rewatch it a couple of times to pick up the threads, but the general plot was not easily engaging for me.  Yes there are the sweet spots of tenderness and affection intermingled with the torrid times of soul-searching introspection.  I found  reasonably believable societal settings which included lovely scenery, and certainly accurately portrayed consequences of &#34;love mis-directed&#34;.

In a family of policemen, the hurt and angry Marc didn't learn to express his feelings.  He acts them out, much like an adolescent would.  The problem is that he's about to become a father, lives with his pregnant girlfriend next door to his parents, and is falling in love with his Shadow, the handsome Kay, who knows he's gay.  Unable to process his feelings with words, Marc acts out and betrays everyone, including himself.  This is a brilliantly acted film.  That it is in German doesn't really matter, most of the message is visual in the body language.  Any man who has gone through the transition of fatherhood will be able to relate to the repressed feelings needing to get out.  How we deal with our feelings creates the consequences.
