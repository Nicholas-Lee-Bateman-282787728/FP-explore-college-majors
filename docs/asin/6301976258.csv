285417,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301976258,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","This film begins in the Cumberland Valley of Tennessee. It shows some men on horses shooting revolvers. The rest of the film shows York never owning an expensive horse or revolver! People are singing in a chapel. There are scenes of country life in those backwoods, a hard life for many. There is entertainment in a rural tavern. The pastor warns Alvin York against his crooked path. Do the wealthy look down on the poor? Alvin makes a down payment on that bottom land. Men go around armed. Alvin works hard to earn the rest of the money. Alvin plans to win the shooting match and win the big prize. Percussion cap muzzle loaders are used. Pastor Pyle counsels Alvin against his anger. But Alvin sulks. Riding on a stormy night a flash of lightning gives a warning. Alvin gets religion. The lost sheep is found and rescued. Alvin becomes a teacher of religion. He doesn't want to become a soldier who kills; its against the Book. ""I'll be coming back.""Private York shows his shooting skills with a modern Springfield rifle. They want him as an instructor to teach the recruits how to shoot. A book teaches Alvin American history. Corporal York will train the soldiers, then they are sent to France and the trenches. In October 1918 the American troops are sent to attack the Germans across the open fields. Machine guns open fire, they take cover in shell holes. The captain orders a flanking attack. York neutralizes the machine gun nests. The Germans surrender to York and the other men. The German officer orders his men to surrender, their war is over. York and seven others captured 132 prisoners. The Good Lord protected him, York killed to save lives. The many medals recognized the heroism of Sergeant York. He was given the key to New York city. York rejects show business and returns home to his family. The people of Tennessee donated a house and a 200 acre farm. Alvin and Gracie married and lived happily ever after. [But there was trouble with the IRS over income taxes for the gift of house and land. The people of Tennessee were not oppressed by ""gun control"" or this story would be different.]This movie was intended to prepare America for another war to end war. WW II made America the world's superpower with the decline of European powers and their colonial possessions. Imperial Germany had exhausted itself by 1918. Mutinies and revolutions were breaking out. The November 1918 truce allowed the German government to stay in power (and prepare for the next war). This mistake was not repeated after the next war. The writers on this film were Howard Koch (""Casablanca"") and John Huston (""The Maltese Falcon"").",5,Hollywood's Story of Alvin C.

285421,A1XLYHIZZJMOMN,6301976258,American,"[3, 3]","This movie is a war story. What makes it so strange and surreal, is that the man whom it portrays (the most decorated war hero of WWI) was in fact, a pacifist. Digest that for a few moments, if you will.Truth is stranger than fiction, and this is one of the strangest twists of history you'll ever read about (or see here, in Sergeant York).Now enter Gary Cooper, hand picked by the war hero himself, to play his life in this Hollywood classic. Enter again, Walter Brennan. These actors are amongst  the greatest Hollywood legends ever, and this movie shows you why that was the case.The end of an era has arrived (the close of the 1800's, when men still rode horses, or in buckboards, and carried the six-gun in a holster, a common sight back then).The 19th century has slipped over the horizon. It's the 1900's now (still over 100 years ago at this writing). But the old never goes away all at once.A young drinking farmer boy, by the name of Alvin York, is out with his friends, shootin' up the town -- disrupting a church service, and raisin' hell. He (finally) gets ""religion"" and alas, becomes a pacifist of all things ""thou shalt not kill"".WWI has now erupted overseas -- and this young farmer boy, Alvin, through a strange twist of fate, is catapulted into international celebrity, by becoming our nation's greatest war hero, and decorated with the highest honors (Congressional Medal of Honor) for valor!

285422,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301976258,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I almost felt racked with biased guilt while sitting down to watch &#8216;Sergeant York&#8217;, because I was prepared to sort of hate it on principle.  First, it starred Gary Cooper, an actor who I find incredibly dull in nearly everything I&#8217;ve seen him in (I admit to liking him in &#8216;Ball of Fire&#8217;, which was released the same year).  To make matters worse, I decided to set myself up for this viewing by watching &#8216;High Noon&#8217;, the film for which Cooper won his second Oscar.  I loathed that movie with a serious passion.  And then that brings me to the whole Oscar aspect.  Having seen, admired and loved &#8216;Citizen Kane&#8217;, I have a grudge against the fact that Cooper has the Oscar and Welles does not.  I know, it&#8217;s petty to be angry over something you aren&#8217;t really privy to, since I had not seen this film, but the grudge was there.So, it&#8217;s safe to say that I was in a weird mindset when I sat down to watch this.Despite some serious reservations, and some serious issues I have with the film, I can&#8217;t hate this movie.The film tells the true story of Alvin York, a country bumpkin turned war hero during World War I.  When the film opens, we meet Alvin drunk and irresponsible.  His family is poor and destined to never amount to much, but with eyes for the town beauty and his heart set on purchasing land for his family, Alvin makes some serious steps in the right direction, including finding God.  No sooner does he turn his life around, tragedy strikes.  First, he&#8217;s cheated out of his land (thus the need to find God) and then the World goes to war, and he&#8217;s sort of forced to join, despite religious conflictions.  It is on the battlefield that York&#8217;s mindset shifts and he finds himself outsmarting the enemy and capturing an entire German position, earning himself the Medal of Honor and becoming one of the most celebrated war heroes in history.That&#8217;s quite a lot of story, and one could easily assume that the film would come across stuffy because of that, but Howard Hawks deserves all the praise you can muster for making all of this work so effortlessly.  Despite some personal quibbles with the way certain aspects of Alvin&#8217;s shift is portrayed (it is all very sudden, this converting from lazy bumpkin to hard working country man), the progression of plot is swift and wholly engrossing.But the direction, while very tight and effective, is only one aspect of this movie.I&#8217;ll just get Gary Cooper out of the way.  I just don&#8217;t get him as an actor.  He&#8217;s so wooden and uninteresting, and despite having a rather engaging and intriguing film to work with, he was just so boring and bland.He&#8217;s my biggest issue, but not my only.It&#8217;s important to remember when watching any film that film is a medium of expression and as such should not be unduly chastised for not agreeing with your personal opinions.  We shouldn&#8217;t be watching films to validate our own stance on a subject, at least not entirely (sometimes it&#8217;s nice, but it shouldn&#8217;t be necessary), so while watching a film that is so clearly celebrating war, I had to remind myself that despite being firmly ANTI-war, my opinion wasn&#8217;t relevant to this particular movie watching experience.  That being said, I couldn&#8217;t help but become irritated when the film tried to debate religion and war.  I have no qualms with depicting men trying to twist scripture to fit their personal agenda, but that whole scene where the heavens basically open up and God pretty much tells York that it&#8217;s ok for him to kill others was pretty disgusting.  Like I said, I had to put my personal feelings on the backburner a little here, but I can&#8217;t deny that that didn&#8217;t sting.  What irritated me a little more though was the cop-out ending.  First, it appears that York is actually conflicted still over his actions, for he refuses money for what he&#8217;s done (and I found that moment so astute) and yet the film ends on this high with York finally getting him home, fully paid for by the state&#8230;all because of his actions.  AND HE ACCEPTS!  Isn&#8217;t that a complete contradiction, and so close to one another at that (those two scenes are practically back to back).It just seemed poorly thought out, but maybe that&#8217;s exactly how it happened in real life.But, truth be told, outside of those two (I guess it&#8217;s more like three) complaints, I genuinely liked this film.  The flow of the film was brisk yet meaty, and some of the supporting cast was truly moving, most notable being Walter Brennan, who handled the complexity of Pastor Rosier Pile exceptionally well.  From a technical standpoint, the film is very well crafted, and like I said, Hawks outdoes himself by keeping everything on a tight leash, giving the film the ease it needed to work.",4,"Despite my

He grew up in Tennessee where hunting was a first pastime, and he was a crack shot.  His carousing ways are transformed by a lightning strike, and he ""gets religion,"" becoming a conscientious objector.  While serving with his unit in France under withering machine gun fire, he decides he will save many lives by taking out the German machine guns.  In doing so he singlehandedly captures 134 POW's.  He is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and the French Order of the Legion of Honor.  Upon return, he receives a ticker tape parade in New York, and many offers that would make him rich to endorse products.  He turns them down because they were based on his action, and he said noone should profit from doing their duty.  He returns to Tennessee and...., well you'll just have to see the movie.There is a second disk included with the history of Gary Cooper, ""Coop.""  The history of the movie is also included.  It was released in 1940, and met with wide public approval, but was pulled because pacifist congressman said it violated the ""War Neutrality Act.""

We know of their actions and their trails but little do we remember their names, their home towns, or what they were fighting for.  However, there is one exception to this, the war heroes of the world wars.  It is easy to name off men from those times and what they did.  In this day and age we have almost completely forgotten those heroes of World War I most if not all veterans of the war have passed on now, yet we should still remember these brave men for their sacrifice during the first war and their determination to make that the ""war to end all wars"".  To help us with this task of remembrance, we take a look at Sergeant York, a Howard Hawks film from 1941.The film tells the tale of Alvin York (Gary Cooper in an Oscar winning role), a rural Tennessee man who has more interest in fighting and drinking than farming or settling down.  We learn early on the York is a crack shot by shooting his initials into a tree outside the town church.  York soon discovers Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie) a local girl that York competes for with another local farmer and tries to set his life straight.  He works for a solid 2 months to raise 60 dollars for a farm of his own so he would have the ability to marry Gracie only to see this land sold to Gracie's other suitor.  York, in frustration, goes back to his drinking ways and on a ride home during a violent thunderstorm, he is struck by lighting and lives, only to find religion and become a model citizen of the town.  Soon after, the United States declares war and the men of the town rush to sign up for the armed services, all men but York.  York tries to be exempted due to being a consciousness objector but sent away to basic training anyway.  While in basic training York impresses his superior officers with his shooting ability and is promoted before being sent over to Europe.  Once there, York has to lead his squad during the battle of the Argonne Forest where York, almost single handily, takes out the German defenses and captures over 100 men.Gary Coopers Alvin York is one of those film characters that seemed the perfect fit for the actor and time frame.  The film was released in mid-September 1941, a little of 3 months before Pearl Harbor and was accused of being pro-war by many pacifist/isolationist at the time.  Yet, the film doesn't really cross on or the other line on war, rather letting the viewer decided, along with York, what the right decision is for him.  In the end, York gives his commanding officer the reasoning behind his logic for killing all those Germans and it is an answer you hear a lot, both in movies and real life.  (No, I'm not going to tell you what it is, watch the film to learn what it is).Cooper is an inspired casting for the role, and was the hand picked person for the job by the real Alvin York himself at the time.  It is hard to picture someone else pulling off that role.  Cooper is the greatest every man to act in film.  His stature and features were not awe-inspiring but his actions on screen showed that he was a man to be reckoned with.  You have to wonder what Cooper would be like today if he was acting.  Most likely he would be a character actor for movies and not have the fame and notoriety that he has now.  The best example I can think of an actor being on Cooper's level would be Michael Parks and his many characters that he has played over the years.The war in this film occupies very little of the film, taking only a portion of the last act and moves very quickly.  We do not see how York lived or interacted with his fellow soldiers other than boot camp and we certainly don't see other battle experience other than Argonne Forest battle.  Outside this fact, the movie does an excellent job establishing York and his character in the film.  I enjoyed the ending in New York where a still humble York asks to go home and turns down a six figure paycheck for endorsements for farming.  To me, which summed up York in the best way possible, he did what was right in his mind with his beliefs and he didn't want any more than the next man for what he did.In my limited research for this review, I found that most of the movie was fairly accurate to the life of York, though his conversion to religion did not happen in the flash of lighting bolt but with a steadfast attention of his wife and going to Sunday school masses. I'm sure there are other smaller items floating around here and there but that's not a bad record of inaccuracies compared to most ""true story"" films these days.",5,Great movie with solid plot and characters,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,4557,"['War', 'heroes', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'once', 'were', 'know', 'actions', 'trails', 'little', 'do', 'remember', 'names', 'home', 'towns', 'what', 'were', 'fighting', 'However', 'one', 'exception', 'war', 'heroes', 'world', 'wars', 'easy', 'name', 'off', 'men', 'times', 'what', 'did', 'day', 'age', 'have', 'almost', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'heroes', 'World', 'War', 'most', 'not', 'veterans', 'war', 'have', 'passed', 'now', 'yet', 'should', 'still', 'remember', 'brave', 'men', 'sacrifice', 'first', 'war', 'determination', 'make', 'war', 'end', 'wars', 'help', 'task', 'remembrance', 'take', 'look', 'Sergeant', 'York', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'film', '1941.The', 'film', 'tale', 'Alvin', 'York', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'rural', 'Tennessee', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'interest', 'fighting', 'drinking', 'farming', 'settling', 'down', 'learn', 'early', 'York', 'crack', 'shot', 'shooting', 'initials', 'tree', 'town', 'church', 'York', 'soon', 'discovers', 'Gracie', 'Williams', 'Joan', 'Leslie', 'local', 'girl', 'York', 'local', 'farmer', 'tries', 'set', 'life', 'straight', 'solid', '2', 'months', 'raise', '60', 'dollars', 'farm', 'own', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'ability', 'marry', 'Gracie', 'only', 'see', 'land', 'sold', 'Gracie', 'other', 'suitor', 'York', 'frustration', 'back', 'drinking', 'ways', 'ride', 'home', 'violent', 'thunderstorm', 'struck', 'lighting', 'lives', 'only', 'find', 'religion', 'become', 'model', 'citizen', 'town', 'Soon', 'United', 'States', 'war', 'men', 'town', 'rush', 'sign', 'up', 'armed', 'services', 'men', 'York', 'York', 'be', 'exempted', 'due', 'being', 'consciousness', 'objector', 'sent', 'away', 'basic', 'training', 'anyway', 'basic', 'training', 'York', 'superior', 'officers', 'shooting', 'ability', 'promoted', 'being', 'sent', 'Europe', 'Once', 'there', 'York', 'lead', 'squad', 'battle', 'Argonne', 'Forest', 'where', 'York', 'almost', 'single', 'handily', 'out', 'German', 'defenses', 'captures', '100', 'men.Gary', 'Coopers', 'Alvin', 'York', 'one', 'film', 'characters', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'fit', 'actor', 'time', 'frame', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'mid-September', '1941', 'little', '3', 'months', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'was', 'accused', 'being', 'pro-war', 'many', 'pacifist/isolationist', 'time', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'cross', 'other', 'line', 'war', 'rather', 'letting', 'viewer', 'decided', 'York', 'what', 'right', 'decision', 'end', 'York', 'commanding', 'officer', 'reasoning', 'logic', 'killing', 'Germans', 'answer', 'hear', 'lot', 'movies', 'real', 'life', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'what', 'watch', 'film', 'learn', 'what', '.Cooper', 'inspired', 'casting', 'role', 'was', 'hand', 'picked', 'person', 'job', 'real', 'Alvin', 'York', 'time', 'hard', 'picture', 'someone', 'else', 'pulling', 'off', 'role', 'Cooper', 'greatest', 'man', 'act', 'film', 'stature', 'features', 'were', 'not', 'awe-inspiring', 'actions', 'screen', 'showed', 'was', 'man', 'be', 'reckoned', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'Cooper', 'would', 'be', 'today', 'was', 'acting', 'Most', 'likely', 'would', 'be', 'character', 'actor', 'movies', 'not', 'have', 'fame', 'notoriety', 'now', 'best', 'example', 'can', 'think', 'actor', 'being', 'Cooper', 'level', 'would', 'be', 'Michael', 'Parks', 'many', 'characters', 'played', 'years.The', 'war', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'taking', 'only', 'portion', 'last', 'act', 'moves', 'very', 'quickly', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'York', 'lived', 'interacted', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'other', 'boot', 'camp', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'battle', 'experience', 'other', 'Argonne', 'Forest', 'battle', 'fact', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'establishing', 'York', 'character', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'still', 'humble', 'York', 'asks', 'go', 'home', 'down', 'six', 'figure', 'paycheck', 'endorsements', 'farming', 'summed', 'up', 'York', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'did', 'what', 'was', 'right', 'mind', 'beliefs', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'more', 'next', 'man', 'what', 'did.In', 'limited', 'research', 'review', 'found', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'life', 'York', 'conversion', 'religion', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'flash', 'lighting', 'bolt', 'steadfast', 'attention', 'wife', 'going', 'Sunday', 'school', 'masses', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'other', 'smaller', 'items', 'floating', 'around', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'bad', 'record', 'inaccuracies', 'compared', 'most', 'true', 'story', 'films', 'days']",N/A

Some people wanted to intervene in the war in Europe, but a great many did not. The official policy of the US government was non-intervention. So Gary Cooper makes a movie about the biggest hero of World War I. Not coincidence. Congress didn't think it was coincidence, either, and after only one week in the theaters it was withdrawn until after Pearl Harbor.Anyway, it's an odd movie in a lot of ways. York is from the hill country of Tennessee, and it would have been all too easy to play him as a caricature, and his family and neighbors as corny stereotypes. Somehow, this movie managed to avoid that. The accents and speech patterns strike me as quite authentic. And while there's no denying that York and his neighbors have had very little experience with the world, he has one thing the army needs very much: he's one heck of a straight shooter. On the firing range for the first time, he is disappointed because he only hit the lower (4 o'clock) position of the bulls-eye, not dead center. The next five shots were grouped around the center so tightly you can barely tell them apart.One thing that may disturb today's audiences is the extent to which York's conservative Christian religion is a part of the story. He was a hell-raiser at first, then was converted by a lightning bolt to his gun (which the special feature biographical info admits was fiction) when riding home in a thunder storm. He takes a strict interpretation of ""thou shalt not kill"" and so applies for conscientious objector status. He is turned down because the little church he attends is not part of a well-established denomination, and there is no explicitly pacifist doctrine of the church. It is simply York's private interpretation.His commanding officer gives him a book of American history and a ten-day furlough, and when he comes back, he is willing to fight. In time, he is sent to France, where he kills a large number of Germans and captures 132 of them, effectively single-handedly, although seven other soldiers who survived from his unit helped him herd them back to the camp.The movie has real historical significance, and it is comparatively well done.

Unfortunatly it only deals with the ( undeniable ) courage of York and only poorly with his character.  York was a dim bulb ( a fundamentalist, even), uneducated, and childlike, but he had a great deal of courage and conviction that this film only touches upon.  The depths of Yorks convictions are only touched upon in the film ( as really lame arguments lead him to put them aside, historically accurate or not, I do not know).  But it fails to recognize ( not by ignoreing but by ending) the deomonstrations of his convictions after the war.  York turned down the fortune his celebrity could have brought and instead used his fame to furthur education ( a value he learned during the war ), beliefs in pacifism, to passionetly espouse a sometimes shifting political ideology.  The bravery that York demonstrated during the war are admirable but is understandable in a man who did what he belived in with no thought to himself.  While his unfortunate educational and intellectual limitations may have made these things subject to rapid change and new positions with equal devotion, the strength of will and the devotion to do what one belives is right is admirable.  Yes, he flip-floped alot becuase he could be easily persuaded, but the intellectual flip-flop, too, bucause they understand one side today, another tommarow.

It has the most representative American actor of all times, Gary Cooper, and possibly the second best American director ever, Howard Hawks. It's a piece of Americana. It's a religious, patriotic, social, and political film, but above all, it's a masterpiece. Its key moment (truly beautiful) is when York is rummaging about his dilemma between God or Country. Then he finds those illuminating verses: ""to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's"". Ask yourself if in 2007 Americans are giving each its due (or rather stealing from them).The film is respectuful to the religious beliefs of people. It portrays the commonsense and hardships of hardworking country folk with no abuse or ridicule; it is emotional and funny; it is realistic and sensitive. It has great trench war scenes, wonderful family gathering scenes, and beautiful settings in the country. Nobody but Hawks (or John Ford) could have risked making this complicated film, and come up with something so perfect. It's embarrassing to think of what could be done today with a story like this one, especially when political, social and religious elements are involved. Hawks handles every thread of the story amazingly.Curiously enough the real Alvin York requested that Cooper play the leading role, and would not accept anyone else (to allow the rights for the story), and he also requested that the girlfriend didn't ""drink, smoke or swear""; and she does a splendid performance too (she was only 16).The extra disc comes with 2 documentaries, one 1/2 hour long, about the story of the real York, and another, some 50 minutes about Cooper's career, and hosted by Clint Eastwood. Pretty good both.The value of the film itself is enough for any classic film collector to rush to get it.

Few people in his era were better at playing modest, soft-spoken-but-manly heroes.

285451,A1LACH6MLQWZ,6301976258,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","I first watched Sergeant York on television as a teen in the early 1960s. Since then I have watched it at least twenty times and have never tired of it (despite the fact that I have considerable parts of the dialog memorized). Not only is it one of the great Gary Cooper's best performances, but it is a truly inspiring film. Set in the mountains of northeast Tennessee in the Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf at the start of World War I, the movie portrays Alvin C. York, a hard-drinking, hard-working young mountain man who wants nothing more than to buy a piece of fertile bottom land and also win the hand of his sweetheart, Gracie Williams. York takes any odd job he can get in order to raise the $60 to buy the land (quite a sum in those days), in addition to working the family farm. The day before the payment on the land is due, York, still considerable short, enters a marksman competition in order to win the prize, which is a side of beef. York wins. Unfortunately, the owner of the land, thinking that York had no chance to win, has already sold the land to York's rival. In a fit of rage York sets out to even the score with the man who reneged on the deal. As he rides on horseback, a terrible storm comes up. When a lightning bolt hits feet away from York, he realizes that God is trying to get his attention. He heads for the little country church where his mother and Gracie are worshipping at an evening service. Entering, he goes to the altar and repents of his way of life.York, clearly a transformed man, begins to study the Bible. At about this time the U.S. enters the war. York, convinced that all killing is wrong, registers as a conscientious objector. His request is denied and he is drafted. Although a model soldier, he is treated with suspicion by his superiors because of being a conscientious objector. At the same time he also wins favor because of his excellent marksmanship.Shipping overseas as part of the All-American division, York takes part in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. About one month before the cessation of activities, York singlehandedly kills more than 20 Germans and captures over a hundred more. He is treated as a hero, winning the Congressional Medal of Honor. Once back in the states he wants nothing more than to settle down with Gracie and farm. The movie ends when Gracie leads him by the hand and shows him the home and the piece of bottom land that the State of Tennessee has provided.This is a truly inspiring and heartwarming movie. More about York the man than his wartime accomplishments (the battle scene occupies a relatively few minutes of the entire movie), it presents in a believable fashion the transformation of York as well as the intense struggle he went through before becoming willing to kill in order to prevent greater carnage.Although the broad outline of the movie is accurate, there is also much that is fictionalized. The one thing that York insisted on prior to the making of the movie was that the battle scene be accurately portrayed. However, York's conversion was far more mundane than portrayed in the movie. The entire scene in which he is nearly struck by lightning and has a dramatic conversion in the church is pure fiction. York repented of his hell-raising lifestyle while at home with his mother.If you watch this movie I would also highly recommend you read, ""Sergeant York: His Life, Legend and Legacy,"" by John Perry. Not only does this book separate the fact from the fiction in the movie, but it also gives a detailed exposition of York's life after the war, a life which he continued to live according to his Christian principles.",5,One of the greatest movies of all time,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,3635,"['first', 'watched', 'Sergeant', 'York', 'television', 'teen', 'early', '1960s', 'then', 'have', 'watched', 'least', 'twenty', 'times', 'have', 'never', 'tired', 'fact', 'have', 'considerable', 'parts', 'dialog', 'memorized', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'great', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'best', 'performances', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'film', 'Set', 'mountains', 'northeast', 'Tennessee', 'Valley', 'Three', 'Forks', 'Wolf', 'start', 'World', 'War', 'movie', 'Alvin', 'C.', 'York', 'hard-drinking', 'hard-working', 'young', 'mountain', 'man', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'buy', 'piece', 'fertile', 'bottom', 'land', 'also', 'win', 'hand', 'sweetheart', 'Gracie', 'Williams', 'York', 'odd', 'job', 'can', 'get', 'order', 'raise', '60', 'buy', 'land', 'sum', 'days', 'addition', 'working', 'family', 'farm', 'day', 'payment', 'land', 'due', 'York', 'still', 'considerable', 'short', 'marksman', 'competition', 'order', 'win', 'prize', 'side', 'beef', 'York', 'wins', 'Unfortunately', 'owner', 'land', 'thinking', 'York', 'had', 'chance', 'win', 'already', 'sold', 'land', 'York', 'rival', 'fit', 'rage', 'York', 'out', 'even', 'score', 'man', 'who', 'reneged', 'deal', 'horseback', 'terrible', 'storm', 'up', 'When', 'lightning', 'bolt', 'feet', 'away', 'York', 'God', 'trying', 'get', 'attention', 'little', 'country', 'church', 'where', 'mother', 'Gracie', 'are', 'worshipping', 'evening', 'service', 'Entering', 'altar', 'repents', 'way', 'life.York', 'clearly', 'transformed', 'man', 'study', 'Bible', 'time', 'U.S.', 'war', 'York', 'convinced', 'killing', 'wrong', 'registers', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'request', 'denied', 'drafted', 'model', 'soldier', 'treated', 'suspicion', 'superiors', 'being', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'favor', 'excellent', 'marksmanship.Shipping', 'overseas', 'part', 'All-American', 'division', 'York', 'part', 'Meuse-Argonne', 'offensive', 'one', 'month', 'cessation', 'activities', 'York', 'singlehandedly', 'more', '20', 'Germans', 'captures', 'hundred', 'more', 'treated', 'hero', 'winning', 'Congressional', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'Once', 'back', 'states', 'nothing', 'more', 'settle', 'down', 'Gracie', 'farm', 'movie', 'when', 'Gracie', 'hand', 'home', 'piece', 'bottom', 'land', 'State', 'Tennessee', 'provided.This', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'More', 'York', 'man', 'wartime', 'accomplishments', 'battle', 'scene', 'relatively', 'few', 'minutes', 'entire', 'movie', 'believable', 'fashion', 'transformation', 'York', 'as', 'well', 'intense', 'struggle', 'went', 'becoming', 'willing', 'kill', 'order', 'prevent', 'greater', 'broad', 'outline', 'movie', 'accurate', 'also', 'much', 'fictionalized', 'one', 'thing', 'York', 'insisted', 'prior', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'battle', 'scene', 'be', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'However', 'York', 'conversion', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'mundane', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'entire', 'scene', 'nearly', 'struck', 'lightning', 'dramatic', 'conversion', 'church', 'pure', 'fiction', 'York', 'repented', 'hell-raising', 'lifestyle', 'home', 'mother.If', 'watch', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'read', 'Sergeant', 'York', 'Life', 'Legend', 'Legacy', 'John', 'Perry', 'Not', 'only', 'book', 'separate', 'fact', 'fiction', 'movie', 'also', 'detailed', 'exposition', 'York', 'life', 'war', 'life', 'continued', 'live', 'according', 'Christian', 'principles']",N/A

York proves his marksmenship using old cap and ball muskets during a turkey shoot to help get the money to buy the land. But fate once again denies Alvin his desires.Avid follower of the Bible, York reluctantly goes into the army after being drafted because ""War is killin' an Ahm against killin!"". Only after being handed a book on American History by his Commanding officer does York realise the seriousness of this overall, and goes to France to fight.The story then takes more actual facts based on actual events, showing York in action against the Germans, using his Tennessee woodsmen talents to pick off and shoot the Germans ""Just like huntin' Turkeys"".  Whats more impressive is York's solo capture of 124 Germans, thus earning him a Congressional Medal of Honor.Gary Cooper did a fine job portraying York, even had the real Alvin York coach him during the filming.

I watch it about once a year.Parts of it seem a little quaint these days, but the craftsmanship of the production and the star quality of Gary Cooper make it worthwhile to me.Like many war movies of the era, it takes a very one sided view of war and portrays it in a highly sanitized fashion. One cannot have teenagers who are going off to war realizing they might get maimed or killed. In many ways it could well be considered as pro-war propaganda, and that would not be unfair.How true it is to the real story of Alvin York is hard for me to say.

Most of the movie explores his life prior to entering the US Army and what happens after the event he was awarded the medal of honor for.It is a classic of its time and worth watching just for that aspect alone.Walter Brennan does a fine job in a supporting role as a hill preacher/storekeeper.The movie does a good job of showing just how isolated from the rest of US society some parts of Appalachia were back then, and the poverty that was endemic there.",4,another favorite war movie,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,1289,"['movie', 'often', 'available', 'cable', 'TV', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'watch', 'once', 'year.Parts', 'seem', 'little', 'quaint', 'days', 'craftsmanship', 'production', 'star', 'quality', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'make', 'me.Like', 'many', 'war', 'movies', 'era', 'very', 'one', 'sided', 'view', 'war', 'highly', 'sanitized', 'fashion', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'war', 'realizing', 'might', 'get', 'maimed', 'killed', 'many', 'ways', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'considered', 'pro-war', 'propaganda', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'unfair.How', 'true', 'real', 'story', 'Alvin', 'York', 'hard', 'say', 'suspect', 'virtually', 'movies', 'do', 'considerably', 'truth', 'make', 'better', 'movie.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'limited', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Most', 'movie', 'life', 'prior', 'entering', 'US', 'Army', 'what', 'event', 'was', 'awarded', 'medal', 'honor', 'for.It', 'classic', 'time', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'aspect', 'alone.Walter', 'Brennan', 'fine', 'job', 'supporting', 'role', 'hill', 'preacher/storekeeper.The', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'isolated', 'rest', 'US', 'society', 'parts', 'Appalachia', 'were', 'back', 'then', 'poverty', 'was', 'endemic', 'there']",N/A

The most they ever really see of Alvin is when he and his buddies get boozed up and ride around hootin' and hollerin' on horseback, shooting their guns and generally being a dangerous nuisance.But Alvin's mother knows the truth, that there is a different side to her son. His drinking problem and his violent temper aside, he's done a commendable job of looking after the York family ever since the death of his father, working their farm and pretty much singlehandedly taking care of his mother and his two younger siblings. He's also one of the finest sharpshooters in town. When he's sober, anyway. Unfortunately, the times when Alvin is sober are few and far between lately.Desperate, Mrs. York asks their cousin, local preacher Pastor Rosier Pile, to try and talk some sense into her hellraising son. It doesn't go so well - Alvin isn't in much of a mood to listen. During one of his rare moments of sobriety, Alvin meets and falls in love with local girl Gracie Williams, but his brutish and antagonistic nature, including beating up and driving off a fellow suitor, aren't exactly endearing him to her. Not quite getting the hint, Alvin gets it into his head that if he can own his own piece of land, Gracie will come around and agree to marry him, so he swears off the booze for a while and starts doing odd jobs in an effort to buy some land.However, when the man selling the land swindles him and sells it to the suitor Alvin beat up, a despairing Alvin hits the bottle again and becomes worse than ever. One dark and stormy night, he drunkenly decides to get his rifle and go and murder the land salesman for cheating him, over the objections of his buddies. On the way, though, a bolt of lightning strikes his gun, and an instantly sobered-up Alvin comes to the conclusion that this is a sign from God.He swears of drinking and becomes a pacifist. He begins making amends with everyone he's ever wronged and everyone who's ever wronged him impressing Gracie with his new ways and making her fall in love with him. But just as things are looking up for Alvin, the US enters the Great War against Germany. Alvin, who now considers violence and killing morally wrong, tries to opt out as a conscientious objector, but the military isn't having it. His sharpshooting skills are just too good for them to pass up.Fortunately, his life in the Army isn't all that bad. His superior Major Buxton is sympathetic to his views, and Alvin also meets and befriends &#34;Pusher&#34; Ross and Bert Thomas. His shooting skills soon earn him a promotion to corporal as well. All too soon, though, they're being shipped off to Europe. They aren't there long before Bert gets killed by enemy mortar fire, and, under the command of Sergeant Early, they storm a heavily-fortified German position.They wind up pinned down by enemy fire, but capture the Germans' commanding officer in the process. A wounded Early gives Alvin command. Can the conflicted Alvin find a way of winning the battle by killing as few enemy soldiers as possible? Is there a way to stop the killing but still hold true to his pacifist beliefs?Sergeant York is an amazing movie that shows how a man can change himself to become a better person, and take this betterment with him to use his pacifist ideals to bring a conflict to as non-violent a conclusion as possible, actions for which he'd earn the Medal of Honor.",5,A fun and enjoyable war movie.,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,3499,"['Alvin', 'York', 'good-for-nothing', 'hoodlum', 'Tennessee', 'hometown', 'least', 'what', 'most', 'townsfolk', 'think', 'most', 'ever', 'really', 'see', 'Alvin', 'when', 'buddies', 'get', 'boozed', 'up', 'ride', 'hootin', 'hollerin', 'horseback', 'shooting', 'guns', 'generally', 'being', 'dangerous', 'nuisance.But', 'Alvin', 'mother', 'truth', 'different', 'side', 'son', 'drinking', 'problem', 'violent', 'temper', 'aside', 'done', 'commendable', 'job', 'looking', 'York', 'family', 'ever', 'death', 'father', 'working', 'farm', 'pretty', 'much', 'singlehandedly', 'taking', 'care', 'mother', 'two', 'younger', 'siblings', 'also', 'one', 'finest', 'sharpshooters', 'town', 'When', 'sober', 'anyway', 'Unfortunately', 'times', 'when', 'Alvin', 'sober', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'lately.Desperate', 'Mrs.', 'York', 'cousin', 'local', 'preacher', 'Pastor', 'Rosier', 'Pile', 'try', 'talk', 'sense', 'hellraising', 'son', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'well', 'Alvin', ""n't"", 'much', 'mood', 'listen', 'one', 'rare', 'moments', 'sobriety', 'Alvin', 'meets', 'falls', 'love', 'local', 'girl', 'Gracie', 'Williams', 'brutish', 'antagonistic', 'nature', 'including', 'beating', 'up', 'driving', 'off', 'fellow', 'suitor', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'endearing', 'Not', 'quite', 'getting', 'hint', 'Alvin', 'head', 'can', 'own', 'own', 'piece', 'land', 'Gracie', 'will', 'come', 'agree', 'marry', 'so', 'booze', 'while', 'doing', 'odd', 'jobs', 'effort', 'buy', 'land.However', 'when', 'man', 'selling', 'land', 'suitor', 'Alvin', 'beat', 'up', 'despairing', 'Alvin', 'bottle', 'again', 'worse', 'ever', 'One', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'drunkenly', 'get', 'rifle', 'go', 'murder', 'land', 'salesman', 'cheating', 'objections', 'buddies', 'way', 'though', 'bolt', 'lightning', 'strikes', 'gun', 'instantly', 'sobered-up', 'Alvin', 'conclusion', 'sign', 'God.He', 'swears', 'drinking', 'pacifist', 'making', 'amends', 'everyone', 'ever', 'wronged', 'everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'wronged', 'impressing', 'Gracie', 'new', 'ways', 'making', 'fall', 'love', 'just', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'up', 'Alvin', 'US', 'Great', 'War', 'Germany', 'Alvin', 'who', 'now', 'violence', 'killing', 'morally', 'wrong', 'tries', 'opt', 'out', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'military', ""n't"", 'having', 'sharpshooting', 'skills', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'pass', 'up.Fortunately', 'life', 'Army', ""n't"", 'bad', 'superior', 'Major', 'Buxton', 'sympathetic', 'views', 'Alvin', 'also', '34', 'Pusher', '34', 'Ross', 'Bert', 'Thomas', 'shooting', 'skills', 'soon', 'earn', 'promotion', 'corporal', 'as', 'well', 'too', 'soon', ""'re"", 'being', 'shipped', 'Europe', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'long', 'Bert', 'killed', 'enemy', 'mortar', 'fire', 'command', 'Sergeant', 'Early', 'storm', 'heavily-fortified', 'German', 'position.They', 'wind', 'up', 'pinned', 'down', 'enemy', 'fire', 'capture', 'Germans', 'commanding', 'officer', 'process', 'wounded', 'Early', 'Alvin', 'command', 'Can', 'conflicted', 'Alvin', 'find', 'way', 'winning', 'battle', 'killing', 'few', 'enemy', 'soldiers', 'possible', 'way', 'stop', 'killing', 'still', 'hold', 'true', 'pacifist', 'beliefs', 'Sergeant', 'York', 'amazing', 'movie', 'how', 'man', 'can', 'change', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'take', 'betterment', 'use', 'pacifist', 'ideals', 'bring', 'conflict', 'non-violent', 'conclusion', 'possible', 'actions', ""'d"", 'earn', 'Medal', 'Honor']",N/A

Bernabo,"[193, 199]","Gary Cooper was 40 years old when he made &quot;Sergeant York,&quot; and his Southern accent is weak at best, but those things do not end up detracting all that much from his performance or this film.  Directed in 1941 by Howard Hawks, &quot;Sergeant York&quot; has strong propagandistic elements.  A whiskey-drinking hell-raiser, Alvin C. York undergoes a religious conversation when lighting strikes his gun and almost kills him.  His goal in life becomes getting himself a piece of bottom land so he can propose to Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie).  Things go against him, but Alvin holds his temper and does what the Good Book tell him to do.  Then World War I breaks out and Alvin is drafted.  Unable to get status as a conscientious objector because of his religious beliefs, Alvin has to come to terms with the obligations of citizenship versus the dictates of scripture.  The film is surprisingly even handed in showing Alvin debating the matter with his superiors.  In the end he comes to the only conclusion possible for men of conscience forced to go to war: killing is justified to save lives.On the Argonne Forest battlefield Alvin, made a corporal because of his marksmanship, becomes a hero when his unit is trapped and he single-handedly kills 25 and captures 132 prisoners.  Called the &quot;greatest civilian solider of the war&quot; by General Pershing, York received the Medal of Honor, France's Croix de Guerre, and basically every high medal the Allies could bestow upon him.  But while the film does a first-rate job of showing York's heroic exploits, ultimately it is more about the man that the solider.  Cooper's sense of dignity is well-suited to the role, which gives more weight to York's life in the hills of Tennessee than to the war in Europe.  What he learned back home clearly stands Alvin in good stead on the battlefield.The supporting cast of &quot;Sergeant York&quot; is truly outstanding, with George Tobias as &quot;Pusher&quot; Ross, Ward Bond as Ike Botkin and Robert Porterfield as Zeb Andrews.  Both Walter Brennan as Pastor Rosier Pile and Margaret Wycherly as Mother York received well deserved Oscar nominations in the supporting category.  Brennan marvelously underplays his role as Alvin's spiritual leader while Wycherly is simply the anchor for the entire film.  Mother York says little and moves slowly, but everything comes out through her eyes.  The scene where Alvin finally gets home from the war and sees his mother at the train station is especially touching: his face lights up completely and her &quot;I'm right glad to see you, son&quot; is the equivalent of other people crying and screaming for joy.  In addition to Cooper winning his first Oscar as Best Actor, William Holmes receives one for Film Editing.

That isn't the point of my review.The American and British soldiers uniforms are fairly accurate for that period of 1917-18.  HOWEVER, I was very surprised that the German soldiers, as well as the German Field officers uniforms were from the 1937-1940 era.  The soldiers uniforms were virtually identical to the WWII field uiforms, and they were far better taklored than your average German alldiers uniform was in WWI.  The same boes for ghe German officers uniforms.  The hats are definately WWII, as are the jackets.  Another point are the boots, they are mst definately WWII issues. The weaponry is accurate, but the field belt and ammo pouch......WWII.This probably wouldn't even be ticeable to most folks.

I just don&#8217;t get it. To me, it is third place to Citizen Kane (1st Place) and How Green was My Valley (2nd Place) Am I crazy? There are several things that wowed me about it.The screenplay does a great job in studying the complexities of Alvin York&#8217;s character&#8212;how he slowly grows from a slobby drunk to a hardworking, upright, Christian gentleman&#8212;gliding throughout the two phases of his life at his backwoods, country hick home and in the militia&#8212;and is FILLED with great lines as memorable and quotable as Casablanca. &#8220;Instead of drinking to something let&#8217;s drink AGIANST something!&#8221; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go dance with that BIG woman? Three women in one she is. A fellow who married her would be a bigamist!&#8221;  &#8220;You&#8217;ve got the living kind of religion not the meeting house religion.&#8221;  &#8220;Most people want life to be peaceful; to have their own home and raise their own children. But sometimes the price of those freedoms is high. Sometimes it takes all we&#8217;ve got to insure those rights.&#8221; &#8220;Bless these vittles, O Lord and let us not be beholden to anyone. Amen.&#8221;Sometimes the subject matter is very deep and thought provoking. It treats the philosophies of pro-war and pacifism very carefully and sensitively and even though it obviously sides with the two generals (that they were in the right and Alvin MUST fight for his country) Alvin is still treated with a certain amount of respect and understanding. It would have been so much easier to make this a pro-war propaganda piece but because of the careful treatment of the screenplay, I could understand and sympathize with both the two generals AND Alvin.The shot composition is magnificent with rich, striking shades of black and white. Love the opening shots of the river, the field with wheat stacks, the bird&#8217;s eye view of the village and the &#8216;meditation&#8217; scene with Alvin and his dog in silhouette.The editing is very crisp and shows a lot of the characters feelings, hence the close ups of Alvin&#8217;s face in crucial parts like when he&#8217;s on the mountain contemplating whether he should go to war or not, right after his comrade Pusher is killed with a grenade and when he&#8217;s getting ready to shoot. While I would not have awarded it Best Film Editing because of the fancy camera angles of Citizen Kane, I can still understand its win and it is certainly not a bad choice.The acting is flawless from top to bottom. The supporting cast (Margaret Wycherley, Walter Brennan, Joan Leslie, June Lockhart, etc.) adds some fine color and shading and there is a subtle, refined, polished performance from Gary Cooper at the center for which he won his first Best Leading Actor Oscar.Now I understand there&#8217;s been some controversy over Gary Cooper winning Best Leading Actor of 1941 over Orson Welles for Citizen Kane. I&#8217;ve seen both and I&#8217;d still vote for Orson Welles but I will back up Gary Cooper&#8217;s win because I love how he portrays emotion with his subtle facial expressions.Probably his finest moments are:1. The ticked off look when the other drunks laugh and say &#8220;His Ma wants him!&#8221; Not when he beats them up. Just THOSE FEW SECONDS before it happens.2. When he comes home drunk and his mother tells his younger brother, &#8220;Fetch me a pail of water George.&#8221; His eyes widen, his mouth gets tight and nervous and he hurriedly pulls his coat over him. You can tell he just KNOWS what she&#8217;s getting ready to do.3. When he and George are trying to pull a stump out of the ground.

MY TIMES&#8217; ALMOST UP!&#8221; His voice echoes through the valley at every sentence and he looks so desperate.4. When he comes into the church after having survived a lightning bolt looking like he&#8217;s in a trance. He just can&#8217;t BELIEVE he&#8217;s still alive.5. Gracie pushing him into a pail of water and running off crying after he explains that he wants her to be free to marry whoever she chooses. The wide eyed expression as he says &#8220;The Lord sure does work in mysterious ways.&#8221; Is PRICELESS.6. That dark expression, eyes glazed over, seething with rage right after Pusher delivers his kicker line &#8220;This is where we change cars at the end of the line.&#8221;I know most professional critics would disagree with me strenuously about this but I think Gary Cooper&#8217;s first Oscar win is way more deserving than his second for High Noon because he got to play a more complex character and a thicker, richer, more multi-layered script to work with. It certainly was a VERY TOUGH CALL with Welles&#8217; Charles Foster Kane on the voting ballot but Cooper&#8217;s win is certainly far away from the worst decision of the Academy.Joan Leslie is lovely if a little over the top as Alvin&#8217;s easily excited love interest Gracie. Walter Brennan and George Tobias give strong, lively, dynamic turns as Rev. Pile and Pusher. And Margaret Wycherley is brilliant as the soft, gentle, low key, laid back mother. I always crack up at the aggravated look on her face when she says &#8220;Fetch me a pail of water George.&#8221; She has some very great scenes like the subtle smile when she rolls over in bed and sees Alvin saving money and marking off the budget on the calendar; you can tell she&#8217;s so proud to see him working hard, being diligent and showing incentive because it is such a strong improvement in his character and when she looks over him sleeping and says with a nervous look on her face &#8220;God, if it be your will, let him get his bottomland.&#8221;It gets eight March Boy nominations from me and while there are no wins in my list because of the strong competition of Citizen Kane and How Green Was My Valley, any one of these would have been good choices.I am thrilled to give Sergeant York five stars, one of the best &#8216;backwoods&#8217; dramas I&#8217;ve ever seen.",5,A much underrated masterpiece that deserves better recognition.,1401753600,"06 3,

285499,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6301976258,Martin Asiner,"[3, 5]","By 1941, Europe had been in armed conflict ever since German tanks rolled into Poland in 1939.  In hindsight, England, a beaten France, and a Soviet Russia then learning the true meaning of Blitzkrieg all could see that the Germany of 1935 through 1939 had been busy preparing for a war of conquest.  In America, Hollywood too had long since cast off its blinders and its top producers knew that another, far more terrible Great War was just around the corner.  SERGEANT YORK was one of a handful of movies that Hollywood managed to crank out before the eye-opening event of December 7, 1941.To prepare America for this newest war, Hollywood tapped director Howard Hawks to reach back some quarter century to resurrect a genuine war hero who could stand tall for a new generation.  This hero was Alvin York, a man who won numerous medals from both his own country and France for his single-handed capture of more than one hundred German soldiers and his killing in combat of dozens more.  What made York even more heroic than his deeds suggest is that at the time that he was drafted in 1917, he was a Bible-reading pacifist who was sure that he could not kill another man in anger.  Hawks chose Gary Cooper to play York.  Cooper was the natural choice; he looked like York, could speak like York, and most important, Cooper was then an established film icon whose unwavering moral compass made clear in all his previous films marked him as York's soul brother.The movie details York's home life in Tennessee.  He is pictured as a young man whose principles were beyond question. True, he was also seen as a hick type, but that was not necessarily a bad thing.  America then was far more rural then urban and very many Americans could instantly relate to his homespun and simplistic philosophy.  Cooper plays York as a man who has to struggle with some divergent choices that all young men in all wars must face.  Can he kill when ordered?  At first, he says no, and he is labeled a Conscientious Objector.  One of the film's most stirring scenes is not one of shooting combat at all, but of emotional combat.  His officers can see in York the making of a fine soldier, and one of them engages him in a quiet conversation whose moral significance belies its decorum.  This officer rightly respects York's beliefs, but tells him that the gods of war cannot be ignored or trifled with.  York replies that he will 'chew things over.' And so he does as the middle part of the movie places him in France.  York and his comrades are surrounded by Germans and their lives are in mortal peril.  If York holds on to his beliefs, he and his comrades will die.  He makes a decision that the film suggests is not a sudden one, but one that has had an evolutionary genesis.  He decides to shoot back and to kill.  And kill he does.  He picks off one German after another with his deadly rifle fire.  He captures an entire regiment and delivers his prisoners to his superiors.  For this he gets a medal, a ticker tape parade in New York, and the opportunity for commercial product endorsements.  The movie ends happily with York marrying his hometown sweetheart.Cooper's portrayal of York not only solidified his stature as the leading actor of the day, but his convincing earnestness of his choice helped Hollywood prepare America for the day that it knew that a new generation of Alvin Yorks might just have to make that same choice.",5,Sergeant York: The Great War as Prelude,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,3421,"['1941', 'Europe', 'had', 'been', 'armed', 'conflict', 'ever', 'German', 'tanks', 'rolled', 'Poland', '1939', 'hindsight', 'England', 'beaten', 'France', 'Soviet', 'Russia', 'then', 'learning', 'true', 'meaning', 'Blitzkrieg', 'could', 'see', 'Germany', '1935', '1939', 'had', 'been', 'busy', 'preparing', 'war', 'conquest', 'America', 'Hollywood', 'too', 'had', 'long', 'cast', 'blinders', 'top', 'producers', 'knew', 'far', 'more', 'terrible', 'Great', 'War', 'was', 'just', 'corner', 'SERGEANT', 'YORK', 'was', 'one', 'handful', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'managed', 'crank', 'out', 'eye-opening', 'event', 'December', '7', '1941.To', 'prepare', 'America', 'newest', 'war', 'Hollywood', 'tapped', 'director', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'reach', 'back', 'quarter', 'century', 'resurrect', 'genuine', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'could', 'stand', 'tall', 'new', 'generation', 'hero', 'was', 'Alvin', 'York', 'man', 'who', 'won', 'numerous', 'medals', 'own', 'country', 'France', 'single-handed', 'capture', 'more', 'one', 'hundred', 'German', 'soldiers', 'killing', 'combat', 'dozens', 'more', 'What', 'made', 'York', 'even', 'more', 'heroic', 'deeds', 'suggest', 'time', 'was', 'drafted', '1917', 'was', 'Bible-reading', 'pacifist', 'who', 'was', 'sure', 'could', 'not', 'kill', 'man', 'anger', 'Hawks', 'chose', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'play', 'York', 'Cooper', 'was', 'natural', 'choice', 'looked', 'York', 'could', 'speak', 'York', 'most', 'important', 'Cooper', 'was', 'then', 'established', 'film', 'icon', 'unwavering', 'moral', 'compass', 'made', 'clear', 'previous', 'films', 'marked', 'York', 'soul', 'brother.The', 'movie', 'details', 'York', 'home', 'life', 'Tennessee', 'pictured', 'young', 'man', 'principles', 'were', 'question', 'True', 'was', 'also', 'seen', 'hick', 'type', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'America', 'then', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'rural', 'then', 'urban', 'very', 'many', 'Americans', 'could', 'instantly', 'relate', 'homespun', 'simplistic', 'philosophy', 'Cooper', 'York', 'man', 'who', 'struggle', 'divergent', 'choices', 'young', 'men', 'wars', 'must', 'face', 'Can', 'kill', 'when', 'ordered', 'first', 'labeled', 'Conscientious', 'Objector', 'One', 'film', 'most', 'stirring', 'scenes', 'not', 'one', 'shooting', 'combat', 'emotional', 'combat', 'officers', 'can', 'see', 'York', 'making', 'fine', 'soldier', 'one', 'quiet', 'conversation', 'moral', 'significance', 'decorum', 'officer', 'rightly', 'York', 'beliefs', 'gods', 'war', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'trifled', 'York', 'will', ""'chew"", 'things', 'so', 'middle', 'part', 'movie', 'France', 'York', 'comrades', 'are', 'surrounded', 'Germans', 'lives', 'are', 'mortal', 'peril', 'York', 'beliefs', 'comrades', 'will', 'die', 'decision', 'film', 'not', 'sudden', 'one', 'one', 'had', 'evolutionary', 'genesis', 'shoot', 'back', 'kill', 'kill', 'one', 'German', 'deadly', 'rifle', 'fire', 'entire', 'regiment', 'prisoners', 'superiors', 'medal', 'ticker', 'tape', 'parade', 'New', 'York', 'opportunity', 'commercial', 'product', 'endorsements', 'movie', 'happily', 'York', 'marrying', 'hometown', 'sweetheart.Cooper', 'portrayal', 'York', 'not', 'only', 'solidified', 'stature', 'leading', 'actor', 'day', 'convincing', 'earnestness', 'choice', 'helped', 'Hollywood', 'prepare', 'America', 'day', 'knew', 'new', 'generation', 'Alvin', 'Yorks', 'might', 'just', 'have', 'make', 'same', 'choice']",N/A

The stereotypical back-hills Tennessee accents were perhaps a bit much, but the real Alvin York didn't seem to complain when the movie was made (although he did chastize Gary Cooper for being photographed for a publicity shot holding a cigarette, something York would never do).The story is of a rough-necked young mountain man who finds religion right before WWI and then struggles with his conscience as to whether or not he can kill and still live up to his Christian ideals.  Well, God was on his side as he became an international hero (quite by accident) then went home.  the movie ends there, but I would also recomend reading a recent biography of York to see what a truly extraordinary man he was.  He wouldn't capitalize on his fame to make money, and he used what little he did have to try to build schools to bring education to the rural hills of Tennessee.Alvin York is one of the greatest examples of an American hero that we have, not because of his actions in war, but because of his actions in peace and his devotion to God, His country, and his neighbors.",4,Great movie/great man,1004659200,"11 2, 2001",2001,1189,"['were', 'more', 'few', 'details', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'accurate', 'overall', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'stereotypical', 'back-hills', 'Tennessee', 'accents', 'were', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'much', 'real', 'Alvin', 'York', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'complain', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'did', 'chastize', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'being', 'photographed', 'publicity', 'shot', 'holding', 'cigarette', 'something', 'York', 'would', 'never', 'do', '.The', 'story', 'rough-necked', 'young', 'mountain', 'man', 'who', 'religion', 'right', 'WWI', 'then', 'conscience', 'not', 'can', 'kill', 'still', 'live', 'up', 'Christian', 'ideals', 'Well', 'God', 'was', 'side', 'became', 'international', 'hero', 'quite', 'accident', 'then', 'went', 'home', 'movie', 'there', 'would', 'also', 'recomend', 'reading', 'recent', 'biography', 'York', 'see', 'what', 'truly', 'extraordinary', 'man', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'capitalize', 'fame', 'make', 'money', 'used', 'what', 'little', 'did', 'have', 'try', 'build', 'schools', 'bring', 'education', 'rural', 'hills', 'Tennessee.Alvin', 'York', 'one', 'greatest', 'examples', 'American', 'hero', 'have', 'not', 'actions', 'war', 'actions', 'peace', 'devotion', 'God', 'country', 'neighbors']",N/A

Gary Cooper brings York to life, a Tennessee Hillbilly with a drinkin' problem. Coop is probably too old to play a very young man in 41, but his acting style, the American Everyman pulls it off. He's a hayseed, but he's our hayseed. As York stumbles in poverty, as he betters himself, working hard, striving for good bottom land, there's dissapointments. Luckily, he falls for a fine country gal, he has the support of his ma and siblings, and then there's Walter Brennan as his spiritual advisor.Coop gets religion and is a mind that war and killing is wrong. WW1 happens and even in Danial Boone country, men are drafted. Our anti-war fellow goes reluctantly, learns a little American history, balances liberty with warfare, and the rest is history.Few films actually make me blubber like a girl, but SY does it again and again.

He hates no one and, when drafted for service in WWI, registers as a conscientious objector..........The role was Cooper's personal favourite, not just because it won him an AA, but rather because &quot;I was portraying a good, sound American character&quot;.  The film has all the flavour of true Americana, the blunt and homely humour of backwoodsmen the raw integrity peculiar to simple folk.  Coop's performance is one of extraordinary versatility and conviction.  Whether he is being the gangling hell-raiser of the opening sequences, the hard-working fanatic of the middle portion or the shrewd fighter of the Argonne section, he is always utterly right in the part.  It's a completely persuasive characterization; Cooper dominates the film with his quiet sincerity, which is enhanced by his moments of blazing action.  Cooper ALSO won the New York Film Critics award for this performance and William Holmes won an Oscar for his superb editing; in addition, there were an incredible NINE additional nominations!!  Margaret Wycherly is excellent as York's simple, devout mother (she received an best-supporting actress nomination).

285525,A2VV0QQU6JX9HI,6301976258,Thomas Holt,"[2, 2]","I will focus most of my review on the double DVD in question. As to the film itself, I can only endorse everything said by the other reviewers, I defy anyone not to like this movie - most will love it. Just one thing, Joan Leslie deserves a special mention. As a 16-year old actress playing a 16-year old Gracie she is wonderful. Cooper was just about as big they could get when this movie was made but Leslie plays her scenes with not a trace of diffidence or self-consciousness. Black and white has many strengths, not the least of which is that it minimises the effect of studio sets. None of this movie is filmed on location, but it doesn't matter. In many ways it simply emphasises the quality of the performances. Contrast this with, for example, the wonderful Anthony Mann location work in his James Stewart westerns - for me the scenery is almost too good and diminishes the story-telling. The transfer to DVD of this movie is good, if not exceptional. It would benefit from the loving care given to the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes series by the UCLA labs, for example.So, the movie is great, what about the extras? On disk one, in addition to the main feature, there is a commentary, a couple of contemporary cartoons, and some galleries of stills. I don't like cartoons, or find stills interesting, so the commentary is all that is left. I went to sleep watching it, and switched off less than halfway through! Good commentary adds to what you see on the screen, with insightful extra information about the characters or the making of the movie. I'm afraid this, by and large, simply tells you what you are seeing. It was with some considerable feeling of anti-climax, therefore, that I inserted the second DVD. It's great! There is a feature on the making of Sergeant York that is very interesting, stimulating, and worth paying for in itself. The insights into the political background to the movie are of particular merit. This is followed by a retrospective on Cooper's career fronted by - Clint Eastwood! I must admit I was surprised at the choice of presenter; Eastwood's westerns tend to be brutal and cynical - everything that Sergeant York, and Cooper, are not. I needn't have worried, I'd forgotten that few know as much about the movie business as Clint. Remember his reaction when once asked why Oscars seemed to be eluding Spielberg?

He was hard headed, but had great integrity.  He turned his life around and became a peaceful man.  Then he was asked to kill for his country.  He was willing to face severe punishment to conscientiously object until he was persuaded (rightly I think) that a soldier for freedom is not violating the commandment against murder.  Once his mind was made up, he soldiered with a will, performed heroic deeds, and helped win the war against German aggression.  After it was all over, he downplayed the heroic aspect of his action, went back to the Tennessee hills and became a good husband, neighbor, and friend.

285529,A2U974OZOVRT7A,6301976258,Tom Without Pity,"[2, 2]","This is a review for the WB DVD release of SERGEANT YORK (1941) directed by Howard Hawksand starring Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan,Joan Leslie, George Tobias, Stanley Ridges and agreat cast of Warner Bros.character actors and  supporting players.Filming the story of WWI hero Alvin York was a dream for producer Jesse Lasky for decadesand the chance finally came during the days of the war in Europe in the late thirties.It took a lot of persuading to get Alvin York to agree to allow his biography to be filmed, especially the combat segments, but Mr. York decided that America had to prepare for the inevitable coming of war. Eventually he felt that  a film showing his initial reluctance to fight in WWI and his reasoning for finally joining in would be a good idea for Americans to see in 1941.So SERGEANT YORK was made and released to much controversy until the attack on Pearl Harbor. After that, SERGEANT YORK was rereleased and became a smash hit, and no wonder it was successful.The movie itself is part myth but mostly truthful. the mythical segment lies in the first part about Alvin York's early life in the hills of Tennesse, espcially the manner ofhis conversion to that old time religion.  It didn't quite happen the way the movie claims but the story is so  fitting and entertaining it's hard to complain much about lack of authenticity. This version of the early part of Mr. York's life is almost like a fairy tale, a Hollywood fairy tale. Don't get me wrong, the basic story is true but certain things were embelished to be a little more entertaining.The second part, York's involvement in the Great War and the incidents that made hima household name war hero is  factual from all the evidence presented and Mr.York declined most offers to capitolize on his war experiences for profit throughout the following years.All in all, SERGEANT YORK is a film classic and I hope will be seen at least onceby every  American as well as people across the globe.  Everyone involved in making this film did a wonderful, sometimes inspired job and all the effort shows in every moment of this outstanding picture.This biography of a genuine hero is both fascinating and informative, perfect for the younger viewer as well as veteran film watchers.  WB did a good job putting this two disc set together, the first disc includes both the movie and a commentary track and the second disc has two documentaries about both  the making of the movie and a TCM1989 biography of the life of Gary Cooper written and directed by critic Richard Schickel and narrated by Clint Eastwood. Both documentaries are well done as is the vintage WB cartoon and humorous short subject. This film has both an English and a French soundtrack as well as English, French and Spanish subtitles.

York is a tough, heavy drinking man until he has a religious experience.  He turns his life around and is working to better his farm and win the love of a local woman.  When he's drafted for WWI, he claims exemption as a conscientious objectioner.  He struggles with the dilemma of whether to honor his religion or his country.""Sergeant York"" is based on the real-life story of a WWI hero - Alvin York, who reportedly refused to let his story be told for decades.  Finally, he relented with the condition that Gary Cooper play him.  Even though Cooper was arguably at least a decade too old for the role, he manages to pull it off through his very likeable portrayal.  In fact, he won the first of his two Oscars for the role, winning again for ""High Noon"" in 1952.  Walter Brennan gives one of his finest performances as the caring country pastor, earning his fourth Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in the process.The movie was nominated for Best Picture (losing to the even more sentimental ""How Green Was My Valley"") and Best Original Screenplay.  The script is quite good, and makes York's many epiphanies and re-considerations believable, which is quite a task.  Howard Hawkes's admirable directing also earned an Oscar nomination.  He's best known for madcap comedies (Bringing Up Baby, Ball of Fire) and more trenchant dramas (The Big Sleep, Red River); ""Sergeant York"" is a surprisingly tame movie for him.The film is perhaps a little too docile - filled with very gentle somewhat corny humor, prime Americana, and affirmation of the Protestant work ethic. Perhaps as a result, it's rather dated when compared to many other classics from the era - it feels more like a Capra film.  Overall, Sergeant York is a solid movie, likely to appeal most to fans of films that are very sentimental.
