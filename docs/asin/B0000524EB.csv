564634,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B0000524EB,A. Estes,"[10, 12]","I was (and still am) a big fan of the original ""The Crow,"" but since it's sequel ""The Crow: City Of Angels"" failed to impress me, I never bothered with this installment, ""The Crow: Salvation."" However, I recently saw this available for purchase at a dirt cheap price, and seeing the lovely Kirsten Dunst on the cover (who I'll watch in anything), I figured what better time than now. Having now seen it, I can tell you that I made a mistake in ever passing it by. ""Salvation"" gets it right. Whereas the previous movie was a redundant remake of the original, this installment goes a bit darker and bit edgier. One thing's for sure, it's a lot meaner, even going further than the original did at times. The first 10 minutes alone contain so much dramatic impact that it could be a movie in itself. Right from the get-go, this movie sucks you in and grabs your attention. Without hardly any exposition, we manage to make an emotional connection and an investment in our main character, Alex Corvis (played by Eric Mabius).Alex has just been wrongly executed for the murder of his girlfriend, the love of his life. Since this is a ""Crow"" movie, Alex gets to come back from the dead and find out who killed her, and why. With a little help from his good-guy lawyer (the only person who believed him all along) and the sister (played by Dunst) of his girlfriend, he tracks down the people involved in the murder, in an effort to find the one responsible. It plays out in typical fashion really. I'm not gonna say the movie is unpredictable. Quite the opposite. But the difference here is how intense the situation is. The actors all portray their characters very effectively and make us love them and hate them, just as much as we should. The story is engrossing, and moves along quite swiftly. The directing style is definitely the major thing that seperates this movie from it's predecessors. It's not as gritty of a film. It doesn't have the ""noir"" look that they had. Instead, it has a more David Fincher-esque style to it. A style that many people associate with MTV and music videos. Even still, it works in the movie's favor, making the experience (although the story may be familiar) feel like something a little more fresh. The only complaint I find in this movie is the way Alex dispatches the people responsible for his girlfriend's death. The deaths should have been a little more cathartic than they were. The average death in this movie involves a gun. Come on, these people are scum! They've earned bigger deaths than that...""The Crow: Salvation"" had me satisfied on all fronts. It was quick moving, entertaining, and very engrossing. It's a shame it went direct to video -- due to poor test screenings. Who the Hell attended these screenings? It's hardly a shallow movie, and it's very well made and professional looking. And to think, I almost never saw it! Just because ""other people"" (i.e. the ""test screening"" crowd and critcs) decided it was a bad film. Don't let that deter you from watching this movie. It's the perfect ""Crow"" sequel.",5,Criminally Underrated!,1127433600,"09 23, 2005",2005,3051,"['was', 'still', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Crow', 'sequel', 'Crow', 'City', 'Angels', 'failed', 'impress', 'never', 'bothered', 'installment', 'Crow', 'Salvation', 'However', 'recently', 'saw', 'available', 'purchase', 'dirt', 'cheap', 'price', 'seeing', 'lovely', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'cover', 'who', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'anything', 'figured', 'what', 'better', 'time', 'now', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'can', 'tell', 'made', 'mistake', 'ever', 'passing', 'Salvation', 'right', 'previous', 'movie', 'was', 'redundant', 'remake', 'original', 'installment', 'bit', 'darker', 'bit', 'edgier', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'lot', 'meaner', 'even', 'going', 'further', 'original', 'did', 'times', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'alone', 'contain', 'so', 'much', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'could', 'be', 'movie', 'Right', 'get-go', 'movie', 'grabs', 'attention', 'hardly', 'exposition', 'manage', 'make', 'emotional', 'connection', 'investment', 'main', 'character', 'Alex', 'Corvis', 'played', 'Eric', 'Mabius', '.Alex', 'just', 'been', 'wrongly', 'executed', 'murder', 'girlfriend', 'love', 'life', 'Crow', 'movie', 'Alex', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'why', 'little', 'help', 'good-guy', 'lawyer', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'believed', 'all', 'along', 'sister', 'played', 'Dunst', 'girlfriend', 'down', 'people', 'involved', 'murder', 'effort', 'find', 'one', 'responsible', 'out', 'typical', 'fashion', 'really', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'na', 'say', 'movie', 'unpredictable', 'opposite', 'difference', 'here', 'how', 'intense', 'situation', 'actors', 'portray', 'characters', 'very', 'effectively', 'make', 'love', 'hate', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'story', 'engrossing', 'moves', 'quite', 'swiftly', 'directing', 'style', 'definitely', 'major', 'thing', 'movie', 'predecessors', 'not', 'gritty', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'noir', 'look', 'had', 'Instead', 'more', 'David', 'Fincher-esque', 'style', 'style', 'many', 'people', 'associate', 'MTV', 'music', 'videos', 'Even', 'still', 'movie', 'favor', 'making', 'experience', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'feel', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'fresh', 'only', 'complaint', 'find', 'movie', 'way', 'Alex', 'people', 'responsible', 'girlfriend', 'death', 'deaths', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'cathartic', 'were', 'average', 'death', 'movie', 'gun', 'Come', 'people', 'are', 'scum', ""'ve"", 'earned', 'bigger', 'deaths', 'Crow', 'Salvation', 'had', 'satisfied', 'fronts', 'was', 'quick', 'moving', 'entertaining', 'very', 'engrossing', 'shame', 'went', 'direct', 'video', 'due', 'poor', 'test', 'screenings', 'Who', 'Hell', 'attended', 'screenings', 'hardly', 'shallow', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'professional', 'looking', 'think', 'almost', 'never', 'saw', 'Just', 'other', 'people', 'i.e', 'test', 'screening', 'crowd', 'critcs', 'decided', 'was', 'bad', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'watching', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Crow', 'sequel']",The Crow - Salvation
564635,A2QGM63A8ZNSFG,B0000524EB,"Alex Kalb ""akalb@clarku.edu""","[11, 11]","I don't know what to tell you, for whatever reason this movie only got a token release in theaters and that alone will turn a lot of people off of this movie, but I could find little fault in it.  THe plot has Eric Mabius playing young Alex, a man framed for the death of his girlfriend who is executed by electrocution on the eve of his 21st birthday.  He claims his innocence and proclaims the involvent of a man with a scarred arm (shades of the Fugitive) but the cops can't seem to find him.  Imbued with the power of the crow, Alex returns and with the aid of his lawyer and his girlfriend's sister, he sets out to unravel the conspiracy surrounding his girlfriend's death, running across crooked cops and sordid sex clubs. The DVD is a fairly good buy, the commentary is interesting and although most of the featurettes are under 10 minutes and mostly fluff material, they are informative, once.  The DVD presentation is pretty decent, there is a little shimmer around the edges of the screen, but nothing serious and, although dark, the picture is clear.  THe sound, possibly the most important facet of this music driven series, is clear, crisp and beautiful. I recommend this to fans of the series, but to others this might be a rent first type of movie.  Still, as a fan of this series, I think that not releasing this movie in wide release was a true injustice to the filmmakers and the fanbase but this DVD is a step toward redeeming the studio.

564636,A3TQZ521KSRUZ1,B0000524EB,Anthony Scheinman,"[5, 7]","If someone has to list the films of THE CROW in order of ... let's call it ""palatability"", I would definitely have to put THE CROW: SALVATION as #2 right behind the original film.There are now four films in THE CROW series and each one brings something different to THE CROW legend.  Here, Alex Corvis (Eric Mabius in a tour-de-force of underplayed acting, which really works here) is legally executed in the electric chair after being framed, tried and sentenced for the murder of his love Lauren (usually, the protagonist is murdered right alongside and with the person he loves most), and after being resurrected the traditional facepaint is replaced by his own scarred skin from his electrocution.  Also, in this film Corvis must convince Erin (Kirsten Dunst), the sister of his lost love, of his innocence; previously, The Crow has found willing female allies (the young Sarah in THE CROW and the adult Sarah in THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS) right from the beginning.  THE CROW: SALVATION retains the darkness of the original film, but adds more than just a taste of corruption that the previous two films didn't have (the villains in those two were pure evil, whereas The Crow's victims here hide their evil under the guise of enforcers of the law/justice), and the main villain, (Fred Ward in a marvelously vicious portrayal) whom we don't meet until about one-third to halfway through the film, is probably the most monstrous of all THE CROW villains (without giving anything away, the scene in which the main villain gets his comeuppance is one of the most gripping moments from ANY of THE CROW films, and one which I keep replaying every time I watch this film!).I have read a few reviews of this film here in AMAZON.COM in which people have complained about how it is that the villains in each film know the secret of The Crow; I answer them: unless the forces of evil know The Crow's weakness and are able to exploit it somehow, the hero loses his complexity and becomes a two-dimensional unstoppable killing machine like Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees; without some vulnerability, The Crow has no depth to him.  Many people also put this film down for being released direct-to-video rather than commercially, but that should not matter; it certainly doesn't detract from THE CROW: SALVATION's being a worthy addition to the franchise.",4,THIRD FLIGHT FOR THE CROW ...

And honestly, I didn't want to see it after the disaster the second Crow was. But I rented it anyway and I have to tell you, I really liked it.They could have lengthened the movie a bit to develop the characters a tad more, but the acting was really good, the plot was really good, I liked how they decided to go with making the face look the way it did because of what happened to him, and not because he painted it that way. It was kind of cool to see them head a different route with a different &quot;Crow&quot;. I liked the flair this movie had.Although I still loved the first crow best, this really comes close. you definately have to get the DVD.

564639,AHSY48775P8RI,B0000524EB,Avalon Daughter,"[10, 12]","I absolutely loved the first &quot;Crow&quot; movie.  It was a tragic, gothic romance that absolutely moved me enough to buy it.  This sequel to &quot;The Crow&quot; isn't without it's flaws, but is better than the lousy second sequel.In this sequel, a man is wrongfully executed for a murder he didn't commit.  Of course, when one is wronged through death, the crow comes back and brings him back to avenge his death, yeah, you get the picture.  This time, the murdered girlfriend's sister, Kristin Dunst, is a major player in this movie as well as a couple of other actors you will be surprised to see.Whereas the second Crow closely resembled the first, (and badly, I might add,) this one is different.  It resembles a movie that can stand on it's own rather than a sequel.  No one from the first or second movie is in this.  However, it is more gory than the first two.  One word: taxidermy.Do I recommend this?  Only if you're a die-hard fan.  It's not bad, it's just for preferential taste only.  Plus, you have to have a tougher stomach as well (considering one of the scenes has Kirsten having her mouth sewn shut rather than just taping it to keep her from screaming.)  You'll appreciate the effort made with this one rather than the appauling second.  Think of it like &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; apologizing for &quot;Temple of Doom.&quot;  Although unfortunately, it's not THAT good.

Eric Mabius does an exellent job portraying Alex Corvis. The Thing I like about this movie the most is that he did not try to copy any of the previous crow perfomances. He really went out and made the role his own. Unlike Brandon Lee's character who was depressed and very somber through the movie Mabius's character was in awe of the power he posessed. The action sequences were great, the acting was good. All in all this may actually be my favorite movie in the series. Well hopefully the next crow: The Crow: Lazerus, as it is being called at the moment will be as good. Hopefully DMX can pull it off!

The a-hole from Die Hard and the 'Hero' from Remo Williams do decent jobs in roles that any other actor could have done.

This one will truly never live up to the original (Brandon Lee was truly his father's son), but there's no way you can say that City of Angels out does this one. First off, there's no chance in the world that the same person will ever see two people brought back by the crow in their life, that was the first mistake of the second one. Also, in this one, they did follow the comic more tightly in the fact that Corvis knew what he was brought back for, that's the way the comic originally had it. Also certain things about this showed more feeling than all of the parts of City of Angels combined, and Corvis acted like someone who had pure hatred for those who took his reason for living away in the same way (but not as good as) Brandon Lee did in the first one.

Willam Atherton as Nathan Randell Jodi Lyn O'Keefe as Lauren Randell she was in Halloween 7 or H20. Story in 1997 Lauren Randell witnessed a murder she has been kidnapped & later found dead so then her Boyfriend Alex Corvis is framed by the cops her father Nathan Randell unintentionally had her killed so in the year 2000 Alex is executed of course he comes back for revenge & needs to convince Lauren that he didn't kill her sister he goes & kills 1 bad cop after another. Eric Mabius I felt was trying to hard to mimic Brandon Lee. I mean Vincent Perez actually seperated himself from Brandon Lee's Crow  honestly Mabius couldn't scare a preschooler. Not to mention that he has the same face paint style as Eric Draven from the 1st movie City Of Angels has a reason Sarah applied the paint to Ashe's face. Kirsten Dunst was ok but she was forgettable in this movie but she gave it the old college try. The score was good by Marco Belterami but the scene at the grave yard while a good piece of music was playing Mabius killed it. It felt forced. Mainstream music was ok but come on rap in a Crow movie. About the only strong character for me was the lawyer guy I believe his name is Peter Walsh then he was killed off. Then they expect us to feel sorry for Nathan Randell when he was partially responsible for the murder of his daughter. Fred Ward as the Police Captain was so over the top & not a good over the top like it's scary or cheesy no it's unbelieveable bad Brain Dennehy would have been a better Police Captain cause he was good as the prick sherrif from 1st Blood I would rather have Richard Brooks, Iggy Pop & Thuy Trang from Crow City Of Angels I will take them any day over the Salvation villians you know cliche crooked cops.

564651,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0000524EB,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 4]","""The Crow: Salvation"", the third film in the successful Crow franchise, was pretty much doomed to Direct-to-DVD damnation by the studio that produced it.  Instead of marketing the film properly with commercials and trailers trying to hype the movie as a different type of Crow movie to bring in new viewers and fans of the franchise, the movie was screen tested in one city with little, to no advertising.  So it was no surprise that this movie went all the way to DVD, bypassing theaters completely.  Although in the studio's defense, there were plenty of fans and critics that hated the second installment ""The Crow: City of Angels"", so I can see why they were uneasy about another big screen release of the dark hero, but this was a totally different story and genre presented in the familiar Crow package.  That is, it centered on a character that had died wrongfully and returns to life for revenge; however, the difference this time is that instead of the flashbacks presenting the audience with the knowledge of who exactly was involved in the crime, we are instead presented with only part of the puzzle and are left to discover the entire truth along with the hero.The story for ""The Crow: Salvation"" is this, Alex Corvis (played by newcomer Eric Mabius) is wrongfully executed for the murder of his girlfriend (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe).  Condemned by his girlfriend's father and sister (Kirsten Dunst), and crooked cops trying to cover up the fact that they are responsible for the death of Alex's girlfriend, Alex is sentenced to death.  He isn't helped by the fact that no one believes that there was a man with scars on his arm that placed the murder weapon in his vehicle.  Now, Alex returns to life seeking vengeance on those that wronged him, to discover who the man with the scars truly is, and to prove to his girlfriend's family that he is innocent.The twists in this film are truly well done, and the mystery surrounding the man with the scars is executed wonderfully, and not everyone is what they seem except for Alex and the sister of his dead girlfriend.  Another unique change to this Crow is that instead of face paint being used to create the look of the Crow, his scars form the familiar Crow appearance.  Wonderfully crafted film, with very realistic characters, and an intriguing murder mystery mixed with the familiar Crow elements, makes for another great installment in this engaging film franchise.""The Crow: Salvation"" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.",4,A New Avenging Hero Emerges...,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,2503,"['Crow', 'Salvation', 'third', 'film', 'successful', 'Crow', 'franchise', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'doomed', 'Direct-to-DVD', 'damnation', 'studio', 'produced', 'Instead', 'marketing', 'film', 'properly', 'commercials', 'trailers', 'trying', 'hype', 'movie', 'different', 'type', 'Crow', 'movie', 'bring', 'new', 'viewers', 'fans', 'franchise', 'movie', 'was', 'screen', 'tested', 'one', 'city', 'little', 'advertising', 'was', 'surprise', 'movie', 'went', 'way', 'DVD', 'bypassing', 'theaters', 'completely', 'studio', 'defense', 'were', 'plenty', 'fans', 'critics', 'hated', 'second', 'installment', 'Crow', 'City', 'Angels', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'uneasy', 'big', 'screen', 'release', 'dark', 'hero', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'story', 'genre', 'presented', 'familiar', 'Crow', 'package', 'centered', 'character', 'had', 'died', 'wrongfully', 'returns', 'life', 'revenge', 'however', 'difference', 'time', 'instead', 'flashbacks', 'presenting', 'audience', 'knowledge', 'who', 'exactly', 'was', 'involved', 'crime', 'are', 'instead', 'presented', 'only', 'part', 'puzzle', 'are', 'left', 'discover', 'entire', 'truth', 'hero.The', 'story', 'Crow', 'Salvation', 'Alex', 'Corvis', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Eric', 'Mabius', 'wrongfully', 'executed', 'murder', 'girlfriend', 'Jodi', 'Lyn', ""O'Keefe"", 'Condemned', 'girlfriend', 'father', 'sister', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'crooked', 'cops', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'fact', 'are', 'responsible', 'death', 'Alex', 'girlfriend', 'Alex', 'sentenced', 'death', ""n't"", 'helped', 'fact', 'one', 'was', 'man', 'scars', 'arm', 'placed', 'murder', 'weapon', 'vehicle', 'Now', 'Alex', 'life', 'seeking', 'vengeance', 'wronged', 'discover', 'who', 'man', 'scars', 'truly', 'prove', 'girlfriend', 'family', 'innocent.The', 'twists', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'well', 'done', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'man', 'scars', 'executed', 'wonderfully', 'not', 'everyone', 'what', 'seem', 'Alex', 'sister', 'dead', 'girlfriend', 'unique', 'change', 'Crow', 'instead', 'face', 'paint', 'being', 'used', 'create', 'look', 'Crow', 'scars', 'form', 'familiar', 'Crow', 'appearance', 'Wonderfully', 'crafted', 'film', 'very', 'realistic', 'characters', 'intriguing', 'murder', 'mystery', 'mixed', 'familiar', 'Crow', 'elements', 'great', 'installment', 'engaging', 'film', 'franchise', 'Crow', 'Salvation', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language', 'sexuality/nudity']",The Crow - Salvation

What infuriates me the most about this movie was that there is an enormous ammount of completely untapped potential in every entry into this series.  Simply the idea that there really is no returning cast for each movie leaves each writer/director with the ability to go where ever they please with the material.  For example, what about a female crow?  Or maybe instead of a dark, brooding, lead male play off of a more scarcastic, dark humor-ish, angle (a la Daredevil or Spiderman).  The script writing is mediocre at best (and I loved Chip Johnnson when he wrote for Millenium, he's capable of much better).  Some things have me puzzled, such as how none of the villians or other characters in the movie recognize Crovis (the crow), who is still wearing is prison garb and very little make-up.  Why is there so much yellow fog everywhere?  Why is Alex Crovis' lawyer (Miles from Murphy Brown fame, who I just can't take seriously) not seem suprised at all to find his dead client walking around?  How does everyone seem to figure out the significance of the crow (including Corvis).  Mabius seems to spend the whole movie wondering how, emotionally, to play his role.  William Atherton couldn't look more disintrested if he tried and Kristen Dunst should fire whoever signed her into this. Everyone just seemed to phone this one in ... if you're really that intrested, have someone else rent it and watch theirs.

564669,A3I2GBE2KGQV1U,B0000524EB,"Timothy Linsley ""Tim Linsley""","[2, 2]","The legend that is the basis for &quot;The Crow - Salvation&quot; claims that when a person dies, there are times that the emotional burden they carry is too much to bring into the land of the dead.  In these cases, their souls are returned to the land of the living by a crow and reunited to their bodies, so they can tie up the loose ends.  This premise is a wonderful setup, with many opportunities for variety, emotion, and even a little action.When the major character in the film has returned from the dead to take care of unresolved emotional issues, you would expect a film with heart.  You would expect soul-searching, pain, anguish, and redemption in every corner.  Indeed, this is what made the original &quot;Crow&quot; such a wonderful film, and the potential is here, as well.  The final film, however, appears to be the result of conflicting visions.Chip Johannessen's screenplay has all the emotional potential of the first film, in all of its painful beauty.  When, at one point, a character wishes to be dead, the hero uses one of his special abilities to show just what it would be like, telling her that this is not what she wants.Quite often, though, director Bharat Nalluri seems to downplay all of this, shooting it as if he didn't care, using the crude and gritty hand-held camera when slick and atmospheric would have definitely been better to create the feeling of pathos.  Instead, he turns his attention once again to the action, where &quot;City of Angels&quot; also got lost.  Why is it that Hollywood is less afraid of bullets than it is of tears?  What is worse is that Nalluri barely even can choreograph a decent fight scene, so the impact is entirely lost there, as well.  I should also mention in honor of a friend that a helicoptor explosion is featured, and well done, though it hardly redeems the scene, or the movie.What is even more bizarre are the performances.  Dunst, once so good at darkness in &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, appears to have been in too many sunny teenage movies and forgotten how to be depressed and sullen.  Eric Mabius, as well, seems to hit one, maybe two, notes in his performace as Alex Corvis - rage, and anger.  Throughout the entire movie he looks irritated, even when he should be showing some signs of humanity.The plot, as well, is a bit muddled, with logic and common sense taking back seat, just so we can get the the fighting a little bit faster.  There are characters introduced who *could* be threatening, but are merely bizarre oddities.  I found myself missing Michael Wincott's memories of his father as the villian in the original.  I missed the strong sense that film had of who was who, and why they each did what.  Again, in a movie where emotions are the beginning, why are they so easily ignored?When first finding information on this movie, I was a little excited.  Maybe they would get it right this time, maybe gold could be struck twice.  It's not that difficult a formula.  It just seems that they missed the point again.",2,Get the Point!,986601600,"04 7, 2001",2001,3023,"['legend', 'basis', 'quot', 'Crow', 'Salvation', 'quot', 'claims', 'when', 'person', 'are', 'times', 'emotional', 'burden', 'carry', 'too', 'much', 'bring', 'land', 'dead', 'cases', 'souls', 'are', 'returned', 'land', 'living', 'crow', 'reunited', 'bodies', 'can', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'premise', 'wonderful', 'setup', 'many', 'opportunities', 'variety', 'emotion', 'even', 'little', 'action.When', 'major', 'character', 'film', 'returned', 'dead', 'take', 'care', 'unresolved', 'emotional', 'issues', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'heart', 'would', 'expect', 'soul-searching', 'pain', 'anguish', 'redemption', 'corner', 'Indeed', 'made', 'original', 'quot', 'Crow', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'film', 'potential', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'final', 'film', 'however', 'be', 'result', 'conflicting', 'visions.Chip', 'Johannessen', 'screenplay', 'emotional', 'potential', 'first', 'film', 'painful', 'beauty', 'When', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'be', 'dead', 'hero', 'one', 'special', 'abilities', 'show', 'just', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'telling', 'not', 'what', 'wants.Quite', 'often', 'director', 'Bharat', 'Nalluri', 'downplay', 'shooting', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'using', 'crude', 'gritty', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'when', 'slick', 'atmospheric', 'would', 'have', 'definitely', 'been', 'better', 'create', 'feeling', 'pathos', 'Instead', 'attention', 'once', 'again', 'action', 'where', 'quot', 'City', 'Angels', 'quot', 'also', 'got', 'lost', 'Why', 'Hollywood', 'less', 'afraid', 'bullets', 'tears', 'What', 'worse', 'Nalluri', 'barely', 'even', 'can', 'choreograph', 'decent', 'fight', 'scene', 'impact', 'entirely', 'lost', 'there', 'well', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'honor', 'friend', 'helicoptor', 'explosion', 'featured', 'well', 'done', 'hardly', 'scene', 'movie.What', 'even', 'more', 'bizarre', 'are', 'performances', 'Dunst', 'once', 'so', 'good', 'darkness', 'quot', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'quot', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'many', 'sunny', 'teenage', 'movies', 'forgotten', 'how', 'be', 'depressed', 'sullen', 'Eric', 'Mabius', 'as', 'well', 'hit', 'one', 'maybe', 'two', 'notes', 'performace', 'Alex', 'Corvis', 'rage', 'anger', 'entire', 'movie', 'irritated', 'even', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'showing', 'signs', 'humanity.The', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'muddled', 'logic', 'common', 'sense', 'taking', 'back', 'seat', 'just', 'can', 'get', 'fighting', 'little', 'bit', 'faster', 'are', 'characters', 'introduced', 'who', '*could*', 'be', 'threatening', 'are', 'merely', 'bizarre', 'oddities', 'found', 'missing', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'memories', 'father', 'villian', 'original', 'missed', 'strong', 'sense', 'film', 'had', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'Again', 'movie', 'where', 'emotions', 'are', 'beginning', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'easily', 'ignored', 'When', 'first', 'finding', 'information', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'excited', 'Maybe', 'would', 'get', 'right', 'time', 'maybe', 'gold', 'could', 'be', 'struck', 'twice', 'not', 'difficult', 'formula', 'just', 'missed', 'point', 'again']",The Crow - Salvation

Still, they made two movies crowned with &quot;Crow&quot; in their titles and even a TV series (with pretty good Mark Dacascos).  So, James O'barr's cult comic lives on screen -- that's Okay with me, if the producers are a bit more careful in making another one.The story is an old one every fan of the franchise knows.  Alex the hero is accused wrongly of killing his girlfriend, and is executed for the crime.  But he comes back with supernatural power of an enigmatic crow, and seeks for revenge on those who are really responsible for the bloody deed.The story is violent, and some people loathes this film franchise and its original comic, but that's not the problem here.  Think this way; What do you think when all-powerful, superhuman, deadly hero sneaks into a police station, and searches a file about the case in an archive?  Or when he askes (yes, ask!) his attorney (hired by him before he was dead) to find out the clue, and comes back to get it in the lawyer's office?  Come on, it's definitely not a thing for any hero with supernatural power!And if you are looking forward to seeing lovely Kirstin Dunst, steer away and watch &quot;Spider-man&quot; instead.  Though her name is top-billed on screen, her role is a small one, or smaller than it should be, considering her name today.  She plays sister of Alex's girlfriend who got killed, and later comes to believe his innocence.  But with her considerable acting ability, which we all know by now, her character is not at all convincing.  So, who's to blame?  Not her, but clumy direction that should have been given a swift and smooth narrative that is essential to this kind of revenge story.The only saving grece I could find is its soundtrack songs, which are really cool.
