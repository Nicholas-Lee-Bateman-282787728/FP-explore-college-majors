I should know better than to buy into some shmuck who's using his cult status to rake in cash from loyal fans. I really think Bob Odenkirk should stick to writing comedy.  He is a terrible director. Apperently there are these things called tripods. They're wonderful inventions you see. They keep the camera stable. But to hell with those things. I think I'll go out and buy a CANON XL1, run around and pretend I'm a director too. Oh wait! Maybe he was trying to get the feel of a documentary but it's actually a movie with actors. Oh! I see. Sorta something like Steven Soderburgs &quot;Full Frontal.&quot;  What a coincidence cause that movie sucked too. Watch Bruce McDonalds &quot;HARD CORE LOGO&quot; or Rob Reiners &quot;SPINAL TAP&quot; to find out how thats done properly. Unlike this film &quot;SPINAL TAP&quot; is funny.Besides the poor directing the story is just not clever at all. Without even looking into it I'm sure it's been done 1000 times before. The only scene I found a bit clever was a scene involving Jack Black. I hate Jack Black. David Cross is in the movie for like 30 seconds. Just enough to put his name on the on the backside of the DVD. Also just enought to trick a moron like me into buying this peice of poo poo. I expect way way more from Bob. To be honest with you it has the feel of a reality show but not the feel of reality. Who is that open about themselves? To make it even more un-realistic the dialogue in this film is delivered so poorly.Keep pushing that Miller Beer BOB!! Your gonna need the cash if you keep directing crap like Melvin Goes To Dinner.I give this two stars for the &quot;Frank Festival&quot; skit in the special features section. I give the movie 0 stars.I wish I put my 25 bucks towards a Criterion Collection Film. Anyone of those I buy I'll never be dissapointed with.",2,Rent it.

As the film went on, though, and we got to know the characters better, we got wrapped up in the real and imagined ties between the characters. We tried to figure out how they all knew each other, really, and the film surprised us with several plot twists that we didn't see coming.Adapted from a stage play using essentially the same principal cast, MELVIN GOES TO DINNER is a surprising find, one that I'm going to purchase so that I can watch it over and over.

Really...nothing happens...four people come together for dinner and different topics of discussion arise, religion, marriage, infidelity, sex, ghosts, among other things.  The movie forms around what is supposed to be spontaneous conversation, and has various flashbacks intertwined to help develop the characters.  The film succeeded, but main problem I had was with the characters in that I just didn't like them very much.  They really weren't people I'd be interested in knowing or spending time with, but I continued to watch, and even managed to enjoy myself.  One thing I noticed which rang true to me was how easy it can be at times for people to relate really personal information about themselves with absolute strangers, while having difficulty doing the same with people they have closer relationships, like spouses or siblings.There were some great cameos by David Cross (as a motivational speaker) and Jack Black, who really made me laugh as a lunatic in a hospital talking about how he was 'the Creatrix' and the jealous god knocked him off his pterodactyl and turned him into a nid (a human being).  Maura Tierney and Laura Kightlinger also appear.  I really thought the movie would have more humor than it did, as the conversation meandered from subject to subject.  It was kinda odd when the supporting cast is more well known that the starring players with the exception of the attractive Annabelle Gurtwitch, who played the character of Sarah.  She used to be on that television show 'Dinner & a Movie' as a co-host and has been in quite a few movies.Special features include a featurette about how the makers of this film accepted an invitation to the exclusive Frank International Film Festival, only to learn that the festival was run by one guy named Frank, and their film was the only movie showcased, and pretty much the whole festival took place in this Frank's mother's house, with the filmmaker's having to share a funky room with Frank's brother.  There are two different commentaries available, one with the writer and the cast, and another with people involved in the production and also a copy of the script available in a PDF format.  There are also like ten trailers for various Sundance Channel releases.  I really wish I could give this film 3  stars rather than three, but the current system doesn't allow for that (foolish system)...Cookieman108",3,"""I fell off my pterodactyl...""",1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,2660,"['Directed', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'native', 'Naperville', 'IL', 'right', 'corner', 'HBO', 'Mr.', 'Show', '1995', 'based', 'off', 'play', 'written', 'Michael', 'Blieden', 'Melvin', 'Goes', 'Dinner', '2003', 'movie', 'well', 'George', 'Constanza', 'TV', 'Senfield', 'might', 'put', 'nothing', 'Really', 'nothing', 'happens', 'four', 'people', 'come', 'together', 'dinner', 'different', 'topics', 'discussion', 'arise', 'religion', 'marriage', 'infidelity', 'sex', 'ghosts', 'other', 'things', 'movie', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'spontaneous', 'conversation', 'various', 'flashbacks', 'intertwined', 'help', 'develop', 'characters', 'film', 'succeeded', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'characters', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'much', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'people', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'knowing', 'spending', 'time', 'continued', 'watch', 'even', 'managed', 'enjoy', 'One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'true', 'was', 'how', 'easy', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'people', 'relate', 'really', 'personal', 'information', 'absolute', 'strangers', 'having', 'difficulty', 'doing', 'same', 'people', 'have', 'closer', 'relationships', 'spouses', 'were', 'great', 'cameos', 'David', 'Cross', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'Jack', 'Black', 'who', 'really', 'made', 'lunatic', 'hospital', 'talking', 'how', 'was', ""'the"", 'Creatrix', 'jealous', 'god', 'knocked', 'off', 'pterodactyl', 'turned', 'nid', 'human', 'being', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'Laura', 'Kightlinger', 'also', 'appear', 'really', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'humor', 'did', 'conversation', 'meandered', 'subject', 'subject', 'was', 'kinda', 'odd', 'when', 'supporting', 'cast', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'starring', 'players', 'exception', 'attractive', 'Annabelle', 'Gurtwitch', 'who', 'played', 'character', 'Sarah', 'used', 'be', 'television', 'show', ""'Dinner"", 'Movie', 'co-host', 'been', 'quite', 'few', 'movies.Special', 'features', 'include', 'featurette', 'how', 'makers', 'film', 'accepted', 'invitation', 'exclusive', 'Frank', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'only', 'learn', 'festival', 'was', 'run', 'one', 'guy', 'named', 'Frank', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'showcased', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'festival', 'took', 'place', 'Frank', 'mother', 'house', 'filmmaker', 'having', 'share', 'funky', 'room', 'Frank', 'brother', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'commentaries', 'available', 'one', 'writer', 'cast', 'people', 'involved', 'production', 'also', 'copy', 'script', 'available', 'PDF', 'format', 'are', 'also', 'ten', 'trailers', 'various', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'really', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'rather', 'three', 'current', 'system', ""n't"", 'allow', 'foolish', 'system', 'Cookieman108']",Melvin Goes to Dinner
778727,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0000DI87U,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 1]","On the down side is the fact that the 2003 film Melvin Goes To Dinner, directed by first timer Bob Odenkirk, is a watered down yuppy version of the great 1981 Louis Malle film My Dinner With Andre. On the up side is that if you are going to imitate something, at least choose something great, for the imitation, while not great, is likely to be good, which My Dinner With Melvin is. It was written by actor/playwright Michael Blieden, adapted from his play Phyro-Giants, and had a no name cast, as opposed to 2001's similarly themed HBO film Dinner With Friends, which starred Dennis Quaid, Toni Collette, Andie McDowell, and Greg Kinnear.... the film really does chicken out of putting its characters in emotional deep water. Yes, admissions of fetishes and infidelities can titillate, but given that this was filmed only a year and a half after 9/11 you'd think there might be a touch of political dischord thrown in. They argue a bit over religion, but no character seems willing to really stand up for anything. They are all, in that sense, preening wimps.Still, I only wish there were deeper characters. Whereas Shawn and Gregory discourse on life and determinism, the four yuppies talk of things like ghosts with all the depth that a post-Angels In America America can muster, and then are amazed at each others' supposed depth, and how stimulating their conversation is. And when I reference Angels In America it's not a mere throwaway diss. There's a reason for the connection. Call it Post-Intellectualism. Call it, `Show, don't tell.' Call it a nice try that settles for copouts. There are too many synchronicities and pallid contrivances that line up to get these four people together in the first place, and then reveal so much about themselves. Yet, it succeeds just enough that I can recommend this noble attempt, especially since the film's start and end are strong- and I mean literally the first and last few seconds of each. You may not wish you were able to join in the conversation, as you did with My Dinner With Andre, but it's still a few notches above anything you'll overhear in a real restaurant. For that, I recommend this DVD.",3,Ok film,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,2154,"['down', 'side', 'fact', '2003', 'film', 'Melvin', 'Goes', 'Dinner', 'directed', 'first', 'timer', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'watered', 'down', 'yuppy', 'version', 'great', '1981', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'film', 'My', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'up', 'side', 'are', 'going', 'imitate', 'something', 'least', 'choose', 'something', 'great', 'imitation', 'not', 'great', 'likely', 'be', 'good', 'Dinner', 'Melvin', 'was', 'written', 'actor/playwright', 'Michael', 'Blieden', 'adapted', 'play', 'Phyro-Giants', 'had', 'name', 'cast', 'opposed', '2001', 'similarly', 'themed', 'HBO', 'film', 'Dinner', 'Friends', 'starred', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'film', 'really', 'chicken', 'putting', 'characters', 'emotional', 'deep', 'water', 'Yes', 'admissions', 'fetishes', 'infidelities', 'can', 'titillate', 'given', 'was', 'filmed', 'only', 'year', 'half', '9/11', ""'d"", 'think', 'might', 'be', 'touch', 'political', 'dischord', 'thrown', 'argue', 'bit', 'religion', 'character', 'willing', 'really', 'stand', 'up', 'anything', 'are', 'sense', 'preening', 'wimps.Still', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'deeper', 'characters', 'Whereas', 'Shawn', 'Gregory', 'discourse', 'life', 'determinism', 'four', 'yuppies', 'talk', 'things', 'ghosts', 'depth', 'post-Angels', 'America', 'America', 'can', 'muster', 'then', 'are', 'amazed', 'others', 'supposed', 'depth', 'how', 'stimulating', 'conversation', 'when', 'reference', 'Angels', 'America', 'not', 'mere', 'throwaway', 'diss', 'reason', 'connection', 'Call', 'Post-Intellectualism', 'Call', 'Show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Call', 'nice', 'try', 'copouts', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'synchronicities', 'pallid', 'contrivances', 'line', 'up', 'get', 'four', 'people', 'together', 'first', 'place', 'then', 'reveal', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'enough', 'can', 'recommend', 'noble', 'attempt', 'especially', 'film', 'start', 'end', 'are', 'strong-', 'mean', 'literally', 'first', 'last', 'few', 'seconds', 'may', 'not', 'wish', 'were', 'able', 'join', 'conversation', 'did', 'My', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'still', 'few', 'notches', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'overhear', 'real', 'restaurant', 'recommend', 'DVD']",Melvin Goes to Dinner
778728,A2MZXLN9TLP1R4,B0000DI87U,GLBT,"[5, 7]","The structure of ""Melvin Goes To Dinner"" is fairly simple: Four people meet for dinner and talk. The obvious comparison is to Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory's ""My Dinner With Andre,"" in which two people meet for dinner and talk. But the differences between the two movies reveal a lot about how films and their audiences have changed over the past few decades.""My Dinner With Andre"" is a movie that comes right out of the 1970's, (though I believe it was actually made in the mid-'80's). It takes itself very seriously and it expects its audience to sit through this conversation without any bells or whistles to keep them entertained. It's a conversation and nothing more. Those who dislike the movie complain that it's dull, pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual. Although I personally love the movie and find it fascinating, I can certainly see where they're coming from.""Melvin Goes to Dinner"" is a very modern version of the same idea in that the conversation, which is supposed to be very deep and thought-provoking, doesn't aim nearly as high. Whereas Andre and Wallace Shawn discuss the role of destiny and pre-determination in our lives, Melvin and his friends ask each other if they believe in ghosts. Andre and Wallace discuss great directors, books, and philosophy. Melvin and his friends talk about watching porn. And while ""My Dinner with Andre"" demands a fair bit of patience, ""Melvin Goes to Dinner"" tries to break up the monotony of their conversation with various ""flashback"" sequences and moments of pseudo-drama: Someone getting up to leave rather than reveal a personal secret; A ""wacky"" drunken waitress; A surprise twist at the end; A framing sequence about Melvin having sex with a married (and totally nutso) woman.""My Dinner with Andre"" leaves you with questions to ponder; ""Melvin Goes to Dinner"" leaves you with a pat sense of resolution.All of which is not to say that ""Melvin Goes to Dinner"" is a bad movie; it isn't. After the initial 20 or so minutes, it becomes pretty interesting and there are some nice moments in it. Overall, though, it feels a bit contrived. I got tired of the various characters telling each other -and the audience- how interesting their conversation was. The director shouldn't need to tell me that I'm watching an interesting conversation; I should be able to draw that conclusion on my own.All in all, ""Melvin Goes to Dinner"" is an interesting movie with some nice moments, but it's nothing extraordinary.",4,"""My Dinner With Andre"" for the ""Seinfeld"" generation...",1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,2464,"['structure', 'Melvin', 'Goes', 'Dinner', 'fairly', 'simple', 'Four', 'people', 'meet', 'dinner', 'talk', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Andre', 'Gregory', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'two', 'people', 'meet', 'dinner', 'talk', 'differences', 'two', 'movies', 'reveal', 'lot', 'how', 'films', 'audiences', 'have', 'changed', 'past', 'few', 'decades', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'movie', 'right', '1970', 'believe', 'was', 'actually', 'made', ""mid-'80"", 'very', 'seriously', 'audience', 'sit', 'conversation', 'bells', 'whistles', 'keep', 'entertained', 'conversation', 'nothing', 'more', 'who', 'dislike', 'movie', 'complain', 'dull', 'pretentious', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'personally', 'love', 'movie', 'find', 'fascinating', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'where', ""'re"", 'coming', 'Melvin', 'Goes', 'Dinner', 'very', 'modern', 'version', 'same', 'idea', 'conversation', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'deep', 'thought-provoking', ""n't"", 'aim', 'nearly', 'as', 'high', 'Whereas', 'Andre', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'role', 'destiny', 'pre-determination', 'lives', 'Melvin', 'friends', 'ask', 'other', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'Andre', 'Wallace', 'discuss', 'great', 'directors', 'books', 'philosophy', 'Melvin', 'friends', 'talk', 'watching', 'porn', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'fair', 'bit', 'patience', 'Melvin', 'Goes', 'Dinner', 'break', 'up', 'monotony', 'conversation', 'various', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'moments', 'pseudo-drama', 'Someone', 'getting', 'up', 'leave', 'rather', 'reveal', 'personal', 'secret', 'A', 'wacky', 'drunken', 'waitress', 'A', 'surprise', 'twist', 'end', 'framing', 'sequence', 'Melvin', 'having', 'sex', 'married', 'totally', 'nutso', 'woman', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'questions', 'ponder', 'Melvin', 'Goes', 'Dinner', 'pat', 'sense', 'resolution.All', 'not', 'say', 'Melvin', 'Goes', 'Dinner', 'bad', 'movie', ""n't"", 'initial', '20', 'so', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'are', 'nice', 'moments', 'Overall', 'though', 'bit', 'contrived', 'got', 'tired', 'various', 'characters', 'telling', 'other', '-and', 'audience-', 'how', 'interesting', 'conversation', 'was', 'director', 'should', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', ""'m"", 'watching', 'interesting', 'conversation', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'draw', 'conclusion', 'own.All', 'Melvin', 'Goes', 'Dinner', 'interesting', 'movie', 'nice', 'moments', 'nothing', 'extraordinary']",Melvin Goes to Dinner

There is Melvin, an unhappy city clerk that has dropped out of med-school, who has been invited by Joey, a daydreaming entrepreneur that knows all of Kentucky's county's by heart, to join him and a friend, Alex, for dinner.  Alex, a business woman, hangs out with boys and has been a part of five different bachelor parties brings a friend, Sarah, who hangs out with old boyfriends in order to feel good about herself.The film was initially a play that has been adapted to the screen that focuses on four people at dinner.  When the final person arrives the group amuses themselves by joking about their waitress who has forgotten to provide them with menus.  While they wait they begin to break the ice with innocent stories about themselves.  However, as the waitress has corrected her error and has provided them with plenty of wine the truth begins to seep out.  The discussion between the different people travels between ghosts, religion, philosophy, psychology, and infidelity, which finally seems to converge on sex.  Their different idiosyncrasies become open topics as a teacher would teach basic addition, which leads the audience to some insightful notions that should be pondered.The dinner ultimately turns to an end, and pleasantly so, as the film offers a truly genuine cinematic experience with humor, drama, and tragedy.  The film is full of flashbacks as the four different narrators take turns telling their stories.  This brings the story alive as it drifts back and forth between past and present while leaving a visual imprint of recollected memories.  In all honesty, the film encourages the audience to sit down for dinner with a group of friends while letting the conversation adrift.",4,Independent film that wittingly flirts with the audience...,1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,1948,"['Melvin', 'Goes', 'Dinner', 'small', 'independent', 'film', 'driven', 'dialogue', 'wittingly', 'film', 'flirts', 'buffalo', 'audience', 'discussion', 'four', 'different', 'characters', 'waitress', 'raunchier', 'sentence', 'Melvin', 'unhappy', 'city', 'clerk', 'dropped', 'med-school', 'who', 'been', 'invited', 'Joey', 'daydreaming', 'entrepreneur', 'Kentucky', 'county', 'heart', 'join', 'friend', 'Alex', 'dinner', 'Alex', 'business', 'woman', 'out', 'boys', 'been', 'part', 'five', 'different', 'bachelor', 'parties', 'friend', 'Sarah', 'who', 'out', 'old', 'boyfriends', 'order', 'feel', 'good', 'herself.The', 'film', 'was', 'initially', 'play', 'been', 'adapted', 'screen', 'four', 'people', 'dinner', 'When', 'final', 'person', 'group', 'joking', 'waitress', 'who', 'forgotten', 'provide', 'menus', 'wait', 'begin', 'break', 'ice', 'innocent', 'stories', 'However', 'waitress', 'corrected', 'error', 'provided', 'plenty', 'wine', 'truth', 'seep', 'out', 'discussion', 'different', 'people', 'travels', 'ghosts', 'religion', 'philosophy', 'psychology', 'infidelity', 'finally', 'converge', 'sex', 'different', 'idiosyncrasies', 'become', 'open', 'topics', 'teacher', 'would', 'teach', 'basic', 'addition', 'audience', 'insightful', 'notions', 'should', 'be', 'pondered.The', 'dinner', 'ultimately', 'end', 'pleasantly', 'so', 'film', 'truly', 'genuine', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'humor', 'drama', 'tragedy', 'film', 'full', 'flashbacks', 'four', 'different', 'narrators', 'take', 'turns', 'telling', 'stories', 'story', 'alive', 'back', 'forth', 'past', 'present', 'leaving', 'visual', 'imprint', 'recollected', 'memories', 'honesty', 'film', 'audience', 'sit', 'down', 'dinner', 'group', 'friends', 'letting', 'conversation', 'adrift']",Melvin Goes to Dinner

I went into it knowing that it was largely based on conversation with very little vestiges of plot, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that it all sort of falls into place to mean something at the end. All in all, the conversational elements are richly written and very appealing. However, that's the end... it takes a while for it to be truly enriching.Sometimes the conversation is such that you feel like you're in it, and that's probably as close to good as the cinematography and editing gets, considering in general it really isn't that well done. I can forgive the hand-held look and a lot of how the image turned out from its independent production value, but try as I might I couldn't help but feel a lot of the work was just shoddy camera operation.Sometimes the conversation isn't very appealing and I can't help but think, ""I'm obviously not in this conversation because I wouldn't go there."" So there's that element too, a sort of discursive alienation one feels when the conversation feels less than involving.Mostly, however, the dialog is great and the characters are amazing. There are some really great performances all around and it's definitely worth a viewing or two, or more, but even as I say that I can't help but think that the play version of this story must be absolutely amazing because of mostly the format of the two media.--PolarisDiB",3,This and that,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,1405,"['had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'one', 'went', 'knowing', 'was', 'largely', 'based', 'conversation', 'very', 'little', 'vestiges', 'plot', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'sort', 'falls', 'place', 'mean', 'something', 'end', 'conversational', 'elements', 'are', 'richly', 'written', 'very', 'appealing', 'However', 'end', 'while', 'be', 'truly', 'conversation', 'such', 'feel', ""'re"", 'probably', 'as', 'close', 'good', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'considering', 'general', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'forgive', 'hand-held', 'look', 'lot', 'how', 'image', 'turned', 'out', 'independent', 'production', 'value', 'try', 'might', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'lot', 'work', 'was', 'just', 'shoddy', 'camera', 'conversation', ""n't"", 'very', 'appealing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', ""'m"", 'obviously', 'not', 'conversation', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'element', 'too', 'sort', 'discursive', 'alienation', 'one', 'feels', 'when', 'conversation', 'less', 'involving.Mostly', 'however', 'dialog', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'amazing', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'performances', 'around', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'two', 'more', 'even', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'play', 'version', 'story', 'must', 'be', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'mostly', 'format', 'two', 'media.', 'PolarisDiB']",Melvin Goes to Dinner

Early on Melvin, his buddy, and the two babes, all thirty something's seemed to be those yuppie people from one of the coasts that have it all and bitch too much, spoiled whiners.  There were a few confusing timeline cuts, back and forth to show little bits of their lives, but again, I stayed with it.  About a half hour into the film, which I understand was a Michael Blieden play, that is adapted to film, I realized that these folks have some problems and are sort of witty in describing the mature dating and marriage scene. Then the revelations get sexier and suprising.  Then it gets very suprising, revelations of horny 30's at play making mistakes and being human.As noted by everyone, Jack Black does a very funny cameo, a spacey riff that I followed to my amazement.  Of course you have to be a skitso or a believer to understand.  Also, this isn't a sweeping scenery film.  It's a play and people sit around the table talking.

I was very impressed by both the writing and the acting. It's rare enough that we get even brief conversations that sound right, like real people really speak to each other; Here we have over an hour's worth.All of the performances are very good. I especially liked Stephanie Courtney's ability to make Alex simultaneously annoying and charming. Others have noted the wonderful cameo by Jack Black as a mental patient with an impressively detailed conception of reality.If you find yourself looking for a break from CGI and other special effects, give Melvin Goes to Dinner a try.

Hard to imagine that listening to four people natter on about various different topics over dinner will amount to much. Actually, I'm not entirely sure it does amount to much. But it's still interesting. There is a real immediacy to your engagement with these people that allows you to really get pulled in at the moments the conversation gets interesting. There are a few surprises. Some of them sort of come out of nowhere, but it creates a feeling that despite the fact these people are just sitting around a table you're never really sure just what might pop up next. I wish the ending had more substance. It's a bit abrupt, and it doesn't in any larger sense answer the questions posed by the film in general. That might be a lot to ask, but this would really have been a winner if the director had managed a greater sense of closure and narrative movement. What's all that mean? Well, so it's not perfect, but it is worth a watch.",3,Worth a Watch - 3+Stars,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,979,"['enjoyed', 'deceptively', 'engaging', 'Hard', 'imagine', 'listening', 'four', 'people', 'natter', 'various', 'different', 'topics', 'dinner', 'will', 'amount', 'much', 'Actually', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'amount', 'much', 'still', 'interesting', 'real', 'immediacy', 'engagement', 'people', 'really', 'get', 'pulled', 'moments', 'conversation', 'interesting', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'sort', 'come', 'nowhere', 'feeling', 'fact', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'sitting', 'around', 'table', ""'re"", 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'just', 'what', 'might', 'pop', 'up', 'next', 'wish', 'ending', 'had', 'more', 'substance', 'bit', 'abrupt', ""n't"", 'larger', 'sense', 'questions', 'posed', 'film', 'general', 'might', 'be', 'lot', 'ask', 'would', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'winner', 'director', 'had', 'managed', 'greater', 'sense', 'closure', 'narrative', 'movement', 'What', 'mean', 'Well', 'not', 'perfect', 'watch']",Melvin Goes to Dinner

But that's not a bad thing, because while ""Melvin Goes to Dinner"" utilizes the same basic format, it quickly goes in its own direction. The characters are smart, witty, not uncommon people -- we know them, or people very much like them -- and their emerging problems are more immediate. If their existential questions aren't quite so Olympian in stature, they're still pressing & painful & eventually cut quite closely to the bone.Add to that the humor of the conversation, the sense of going out on increasingly fragile limbs, and you've got an offbeat film that's both intelligent & marvelously entertaining. Even better, it'll get you thinking, and might even lead to some fruitful conversations of your own. The DVD also includes some enjoyable extras & commentary tracks, making this a film worth owning & watching more than once. It does have some rough edges, both because of a limited budget & the fact that it's a first effort for the filmmakers; but don't let that stop you from giving it a try.
