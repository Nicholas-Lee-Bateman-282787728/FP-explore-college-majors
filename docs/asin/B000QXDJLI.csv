1078307,A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8,B000QXDJLI,Adam,"[1, 1]","In this review, I assume you're already familiar with The Wire and are considering whether to continue into the 4th season.  If you're not already familiar with the show, buy (or rent) Season 1 - it's worth it, in fact it's one of the best shows on TV.  The rest of this review focuses on Season 4, and I'll do my best to avoid spoilers.Season 4 of the wire takes some pretty dramatic turns from the previous 3 seasons, the most notable being the fact that the Barksdale gang is no more.  Bodie and Slim are still around, and even Wee-Bey makes some appearances this season, albeit from prison, but the Barksdale organization has been supplanted by Marlo.The most interesting aspect of Season 4 is that, similar to how Season 2 focused on the dockworkers, Season 4 takes a very close look at the Baltimore school system (mainly via the eyes of Prez, who is now a teacher).  I know, the subject matter sounds boring but it's actually very well executed, with the focus on a group of young kids (Randy, Dukie, Namond, and Chris) and the pressures they face to get into ""the game"" at a very young age (younger than Bodie or even Wallace in season 1).  In this look into the school system, the social commentary aspect of the series is felt even more than in prior seasons, but it doesn't detract from the drama, if anything it enhances it.Like the previous three seasons, the characters are excellent.  McNulty's role has been diminished significantly (he's a minor character in season 4, hopefully he'll play a bigger role in season 5), but he's been replaced by some new characters (the aforementioned kids) as well as some existing characters taking on greater roles (Carcetti is now a major character as he runs for mayor against incumbent Royce ... the election is a major facet of the plot this season).  Thankfully, Omar is still around and up to his old habits, and the confrontation between he and Marlo is excellent, but I won't spoil that.The Bonus Features segment of this set included on disc 4 includes two very interesting mini-documentaries (about a half hour each) entitled ""The Game is Real"" and ""It's All Connected"".  I rarely bother with all the bonus features a lot of DVDs include, but these are worth watching.  I didn't know that the co-creators of The Wire are an ex detective, and an ex journalist (both worked in Baltimore of course), and, not surprisingly, a large amount of the material in The Wire is adapted from real world events.  Also not surprisingly, a large percentage of the men and women who work on the show are not career hollywood/TV types.  The documentaries provide a pretty interesting look at how the creators approach the show and how it has drawn inspiration from real world Baltimore.  Definately check these documentaries out if you buy the DVD set!In summary, if you've already seen the first three seasons and are considering whether to continue The Wire, the answer is a resounding ""yes"".  In addition, the season ends by setting up for a potentially spectacular Season 5, which I'm really looking forward to.  I've heard that Season 5 will be the last season of The Wire, and while I'll miss it that's ok with me - I'd rather see a great series have a great ending, rather than spiral into a Soprano's style dive in its twilight years.",5,The best season yet of one of the best shows on television,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,3286,"['review', 'assume', ""'re"", 'already', 'familiar', 'Wire', 'are', 'considering', 'continue', '4th', 'season', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'familiar', 'show', 'buy', 'rent', 'Season', '1', 'fact', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'rest', 'review', 'Season', '4', ""'ll"", 'do', 'best', 'avoid', 'spoilers.Season', '4', 'wire', 'pretty', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'previous', '3', 'seasons', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'fact', 'Barksdale', 'gang', 'more', 'Bodie', 'Slim', 'are', 'still', 'even', 'Wee-Bey', 'appearances', 'season', 'prison', 'Barksdale', 'organization', 'been', 'supplanted', 'Marlo.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'Season', '4', 'similar', 'how', 'Season', '2', 'focused', 'dockworkers', 'Season', '4', 'very', 'close', 'look', 'Baltimore', 'school', 'system', 'mainly', 'eyes', 'Prez', 'who', 'now', 'teacher', 'know', 'subject', 'matter', 'boring', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'focus', 'group', 'young', 'kids', 'Randy', 'Dukie', 'Namond', 'Chris', 'pressures', 'face', 'get', 'game', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'younger', 'Bodie', 'even', 'Wallace', 'season', '1', 'look', 'school', 'system', 'social', 'commentary', 'aspect', 'series', 'felt', 'even', 'more', 'prior', 'seasons', ""n't"", 'detract', 'drama', 'anything', 'previous', 'three', 'seasons', 'characters', 'are', 'excellent', 'McNulty', 'role', 'been', 'diminished', 'significantly', 'minor', 'character', 'season', '4', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'play', 'bigger', 'role', 'season', '5', 'been', 'replaced', 'new', 'characters', 'aforementioned', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'existing', 'characters', 'taking', 'greater', 'roles', 'Carcetti', 'now', 'major', 'character', 'mayor', 'incumbent', 'Royce', 'election', 'major', 'facet', 'plot', 'season', 'Thankfully', 'Omar', 'still', 'around', 'up', 'old', 'habits', 'confrontation', 'Marlo', 'excellent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'that.The', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'segment', 'set', 'included', 'disc', '4', 'two', 'very', 'interesting', 'mini-documentaries', 'half', 'hour', 'entitled', 'Game', 'Real', 'Connected', 'rarely', 'bother', 'bonus', 'lot', 'DVDs', 'include', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'co-creators', 'Wire', 'are', 'ex', 'detective', 'ex', 'journalist', 'worked', 'Baltimore', 'course', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'large', 'amount', 'material', 'Wire', 'adapted', 'real', 'world', 'events', 'Also', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'large', 'percentage', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'work', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'career', 'hollywood/TV', 'types', 'documentaries', 'provide', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'look', 'how', 'creators', 'approach', 'show', 'how', 'drawn', 'inspiration', 'real', 'world', 'Baltimore', 'Definately', 'check', 'documentaries', 'out', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'summary', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'considering', 'continue', 'Wire', 'answer', 'resounding', 'yes', 'addition', 'season', 'ends', 'setting', 'up', 'potentially', 'spectacular', 'Season', '5', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Season', '5', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'Wire', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'ok', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'great', 'series', 'have', 'great', 'ending', 'rather', 'spiral', 'Soprano', 'style', 'dive', 'twilight', 'years']",The Wire: Season 4

1078310,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B000QXDJLI,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 2]","This is perhaps the strongest of the four seasons of this outstanding series I have seen so far. It is unremittingly dark and honest; it has grown way beyond entertainment to become a penetrating and withering examination of what's worst about U.S. society.This time, the authors take us into the Baltimore school system. We get to know a few of the students, their parents as well as teachers and administrators. These are kids who come from the meanest streets of the city -- their parents are dope fiends or felons. They are foul-mouthed, undisciplined, lack motivation and are unsocialized. In one of the most insightful moments of the entire series, one of the characters comments, ""They aren't educating themselves for our world. They're developing the survival skills they need for their world.""One of the students we meet is Michael: his mother is a heroin addict who gives away her own kids' food money to buy drugs. She has shacked up with an abusive man. Michael struggles to protect himself and his young half brother. By the end of the season, he has turned to drug dealers for protection and has become a cold-blooded killer.Another kid makes the mistake of confiding in a policeman. His house is fire-bombed, his mother grievously injured and he winds up in a group foster home being beaten up as a snitch by his roommates.A third kid is given a chance of escaping this grim reality when he's adopted by a former police officer. His natural mother's only ambition for her son is for him to become a successful street corner drug dealer and soldier for a trafficking gang.Since the first season, the dealers on the corners have changed. The Avon Barksdale gang in the first series could be bloody killers but it was all in the pursuit of business -- it was part of what they all call ""the game."" They had a certain code of honor. But the gang that now controls the streets are cold-blooded murderers who kill without compunction. They have no code and recognize no restraints.This multi-faceted series recognizes that the drug trade flourishes in neglected black ghettos where social order has completely broken down. In this series, it shows how this failure, which is a collective failure of all of us in America, poisons the lives of children, consigning them to fruitless, cruel lives, leaving them with the choice of embracing the drugs trade and becoming killers or defying it and risking death.",5,Dark and penetrating,1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,2415,"['perhaps', 'strongest', 'four', 'seasons', 'outstanding', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'unremittingly', 'dark', 'honest', 'grown', 'way', 'entertainment', 'become', 'penetrating', 'withering', 'examination', 'what', 'worst', 'U.S.', 'society.This', 'time', 'authors', 'take', 'Baltimore', 'school', 'system', 'get', 'know', 'few', 'students', 'parents', 'as', 'well', 'teachers', 'administrators', 'are', 'kids', 'who', 'come', 'meanest', 'streets', 'city', 'parents', 'are', 'dope', 'fiends', 'felons', 'are', 'foul-mouthed', 'undisciplined', 'lack', 'motivation', 'are', 'unsocialized', 'one', 'most', 'insightful', 'moments', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'characters', 'comments', 'are', ""n't"", 'educating', 'world', ""'re"", 'developing', 'survival', 'need', 'world', 'One', 'students', 'meet', 'Michael', 'mother', 'heroin', 'addict', 'who', 'away', 'own', 'kids', 'food', 'money', 'buy', 'drugs', 'shacked', 'up', 'abusive', 'man', 'Michael', 'protect', 'young', 'half', 'brother', 'end', 'season', 'turned', 'drug', 'dealers', 'protection', 'become', 'cold-blooded', 'killer.Another', 'kid', 'mistake', 'confiding', 'policeman', 'house', 'fire-bombed', 'mother', 'grievously', 'injured', 'up', 'group', 'foster', 'home', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'snitch', 'roommates.A', 'third', 'kid', 'given', 'chance', 'escaping', 'grim', 'reality', 'when', 'adopted', 'former', 'police', 'officer', 'natural', 'mother', 'only', 'ambition', 'son', 'become', 'successful', 'street', 'corner', 'drug', 'dealer', 'soldier', 'trafficking', 'gang.Since', 'first', 'season', 'dealers', 'corners', 'have', 'changed', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'gang', 'first', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'bloody', 'killers', 'was', 'pursuit', 'business', 'was', 'part', 'what', 'call', 'game', 'had', 'certain', 'code', 'honor', 'gang', 'now', 'streets', 'are', 'cold-blooded', 'murderers', 'who', 'kill', 'compunction', 'have', 'code', 'recognize', 'restraints.This', 'multi-faceted', 'series', 'drug', 'trade', 'flourishes', 'neglected', 'black', 'ghettos', 'where', 'social', 'order', 'completely', 'broken', 'down', 'series', 'how', 'failure', 'collective', 'failure', 'America', 'lives', 'children', 'consigning', 'fruitless', 'cruel', 'lives', 'leaving', 'choice', 'embracing', 'drugs', 'trade', 'becoming', 'killers', 'defying', 'risking', 'death']",The Wire: Season 4

1078313,A13JTELR9NGV8O,B000QXDJLI,A - NYC,"[4, 8]","Despite having a small - but loyal - viewer ship, HBO keeps supporting this series.  The Wire is not easy at first - until you really get into it.  It's like a novel - you need time to relate to and understand the characters and story lines.  It's important to watch this series in sequence.  If you come in half way though, it will be very hard to get the most from the stories.  DVD is probably the best way of viewing the Wire.I loved the first season of the Wire.  Omar in particular is a great character.  But they all are.  McNulty - that main character is probably my least favorite.Season 2 was not as compelling.  The port theme was interesting, but I don't know.  I just didn't really find it as absorbing.Season 3 - back into the season 1 storyline.  A great season.  The best of the first 3 probably.  Great twists and turns, and some really surprising turns of event.Then comes season 4.  Very different from the others.  Based around city politics and the school system.  Season 4 was simply ones of the best pieces of television drama - ever.  The characters, the boys and their struggles, the race for Mayor.  I am looking forward to seeing it again on DVD so much.Like the other reviewers, I also hope they keep on making the Wire.  I know they are doing season 5 - and HBO would usually wait for season 5 to start on the air before releasing season 4.  HBO must be wanting cash flow, having screwed up its schedule so badly - and canceling Deadwood and Rome (a***oles).  Let's hope they do season 6  and 7 and 8 and more ...HBO also decreased the prices of the Wire DVDs.  If you have not seen the Wire -- take the opportunity.

1078314,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B000QXDJLI,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[14, 14]","The fourth and penultimate season of The Wire sees the show moving into new territory. At the end of Season 3 the Barksdale organisation was finally destroyed for good, McNulty found himself some happiness and Daniels got a promotion. The goals set out in Season 1 had been achieved. So, where next for the Major Crimes Unit and the players of the game?Season 4 follows several storylines in tandem. The MCU is now chasing down Marlo Stanfield, whose organisation has picked up from where Barksdale left off and now rules over most of the western district of Baltimore. However, their rise to power has apparently been accomplished with virtually no deaths, bemusing Lester Freamon. With the wiretaps also coming up empty, Freamon's attempts to follow the money trail attract the ire of his superiors and pretty soon the MCU is all but shut down and Freamon and Kima end up working in Homicide instead. Elsewhere, McNulty is enjoying the (relatively) easy life as a beat cop, Daniels is heading up his own force and Carver is maturing as an officer, with only Herc apparently resisting any change, at least until he catches the Mayor's eye (in a rather interesting manner) and finds his star rising as a result. But overall the police side of things, at least to start off with, seems pretty quiet.On the streets Marlo's rise to power has been achieved with the help of his two enforcers, the terrifyingly cold-blooded and ruthless Chris and Snoop, who have come up with a brilliant scheme to hide the resulting bodies from the police. Proposition Joe, who has inherited most of the surviving Barksdale crew, is continuing his efforts to entice Marlo into the cooperative to little avail, so he hatches a scheme to get Marlo on his side by setting up a war between him and the indefatigable Omar. Unfortunately, this leads to a pretty bloody and complicated state of affairs for all concerned.Elsewhere, Tommy Carcetti is running for the position of mayor, but the race is a difficult three-way contest between him, the incumbent Royce and fellow councilman Tony Gray. Unfortunately, no sooner is the winner in office then they are delivered two massive problems: how to handle the proven incompetence of police commissioner Burrell when they cannot fire him for political reasons, and the discovery that they have a jaw-dropping $54 million budget deficit due to overspending in the schools.At the same time, Prez, the former MCU member fired from the force in Season 3 after accidentally killing another officer, has started a new life as a maths teacher. His class is noisy, uncooperative, disrespectful and sometimes shockingly violent (one student slashes another's face open with a razor in his first week). However, the primary narrative for Season 4 focuses on four of the students in Prez's class - Randy, Dukie, Namond and Michael. These are all new characters, although with some ties to existing ones: Namond is the son of former Barksdale enforcer Wee-Bey and Michael is a member of Cutty's gym.The scaling back of the other characters in favour of following these four youngsters around may seem like an odd move, but it pays off brilliantly. Having tackled the police, criminals, politicians, and dockworkers, Season 4 is about teachers, students and the role of education in shaping the lives of the young. Early in the season a divide is identified between those kids who could make something for themselves and the corner kids who don't want to do anything other than stand on the streets and sell drugs to make money, and where the four main characters fall on that divide and how they swap sides and change over the course of the season is fascinating to watch. At first glance Michael seems to be the most positive and promising of the four, but his interest in sports and growing cooperation in class hides a bitter and painful home life that soon leads him into Marlo's circle, whilst happy-go-lucky Randy makes a series of mistakes that prove costly. In fact it's Namond, who is selling drugs from the start and being schooled for a life of crime by his father from behind bars, who undergoes the most interesting and seismic shifts in character, all depicted through the brilliant-as-usual writing and some fine performances from the young actors involved.Andre Royo as Bubs also has to be singled out for mention, as Bubs hits rock-bottom in this season and Royo's depiction of a man whose already crappy life disintegrates completely is absolutely stunning. At the same time, Dominic West's low availability for the season means that McNulty doesn't appear very much, meaning more screen time for Freamon (Clarke Peters) and Bunk (Wendell Pierce), which is a very welcome move. McNulty does return to prominence in the last two episodes, which set up the direction of the final season pretty well.The Wire: Season 4 (*****) is as superbly-written, brilliantly funny, expertly-acted and stomach-churningly tragic as ever, except possibly even moreso than the first three seasons. If there is a negative point, it's that Season 4 is the most epic and sprawling season to date, and it takes a while for all the disparate storylines to start pulling together. But when they do, the result is the most powerful and gripping final run of episodes yet.",5,Excellent,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,5272,"['fourth', 'penultimate', 'season', 'Wire', 'show', 'moving',

If not what are you doing; go out and buy or rent or try to borrow from someone the previous seasons, and start from Season 1. Do not, I repeat do not, skip a single episode much less a season. That might be fine for some TV shows, but not The Wire. The Wire unfolds like a great novel, building on itself piece by piece, and with a scope beyond anything done in television beforehand. It's a show that requires dedication, and with that dedication you will absorb some of the most satisfying experiences you have ever felt from a TV show.For those that have seen seasons 1 through 3, rest assured that Season 4 isn't only on par with those first three season; in my opinion it suprasses them. Every Wire season ads a new layer to the Baltimore culture, and this season it's the school. For me, as someone who went to inner city schools though not in Baltimore, it was aghast how much I could relate my experiences to those of the kids on the show. There are four major characters--Michael, Namond, Randy, and Dukie--and all are performed by the young actors very well.I'm not going to give much away. The first episode, like the first episode of the other seasons, purposely frustrates the viewer with many new characters brand new plotlines not always clear, and it's hard to make total sense of it even by the third episode. The more the season progresses the more you appreciate that they did confuse you in the beginning because there always is a payoff. This is the first season that doesn't rely much on the Barksdale crew, but it picks up at the street very well, as it does with the Law, and at the Hall. Along with the School all four aspects of the Wire connect in a way so seamless you're amazed television is capable of something so grand.Special features include six Audio commentaries, and two nice documentaries on the show. One of the commentaries includes all four actors playing the kids I mentioned above, along with the actor who plays Prop Joe, and it's one of the more memorable commentaries I have seen.",5,Maybe the best season of any television show ever.,1227830400,"11 28, 2008",2008,2164,"['assume', ""'re"", 'reading', 'review', 'own', 'least', 'have', 'seen', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'program', 'Wire', 'not', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'go', 'buy', 'rent', 'try', 'borrow', 'someone', 'previous', 'seasons', 'start', 'Season', '1', 'Do', 'not', 'repeat', 'do', 'not', 'skip', 'single', 'episode', 'much', 'less', 'season', 'might', 'be', 'fine', 'TV', 'shows', 'not', 'Wire', 'Wire', 'unfolds', 'great', 'novel', 'building', 'piece', 'piece', 'scope', 'anything', 'done', 'television', 'beforehand', 'show', 'dedication', 'dedication', 'will', 'absorb', 'most', 'satisfying', 'experiences', 'have', 'ever', 'felt', 'TV', 'show.For', 'have', 'seen', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'rest', 'assured', 'Season', '4', ""n't"", 'only', 'par', 'first', 'three', 'season', 'opinion', 'Every', 'Wire', 'season', 'ads', 'new', 'layer', 'Baltimore', 'culture', 'season', 'school', 'someone', 'who', 'went', 'inner', 'city', 'schools', 'not', 'Baltimore', 'was', 'aghast', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'relate', 'experiences', 'kids', 'show', 'are', 'four', 'major', 'characters', 'Michael', 'Namond', 'Randy', 'Dukie', 'are', 'performed', 'young', 'actors', 'very', 'well.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'much', 'away', 'first', 'episode', 'first', 'episode', 'other', 'seasons', 'purposely', 'viewer', 'many', 'new', 'characters', 'brand', 'new', 'plotlines', 'not', 'always', 'clear', 'hard', 'make', 'total', 'sense', 'even', 'third', 'episode', 'more', 'season', 'more', 'appreciate', 'did', 'confuse', 'beginning', 'always', 'payoff', 'first', 'season', ""n't"", 'rely', 'much', 'Barksdale', 'crew', 'up', 'street', 'very', 'well', 'Law', 'Hall', 'School', 'four', 'aspects', 'Wire', 'connect', 'way', 'so', 'seamless', ""'re"", 'amazed', 'television', 'capable', 'something', 'so', 'grand.Special', 'features', 'include', 'six', 'Audio', 'commentaries', 'two', 'nice', 'documentaries', 'show', 'One', 'commentaries', 'four', 'actors', 'playing', 'kids', 'mentioned', 'above', 'actor', 'who', 'Prop', 'Joe', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'commentaries', 'have', 'seen']",The Wire: Season 4

I've loved all of the HBO series, if for no other reason, for their honesty. I don't know if they have more artistic leverage or what, but they seem to be able to take more risks than most other television programs; consequently, character development is especially authentic. While some reviewers were completely turned off by the graphic realism of the characters and stories; having lived in Maryland for a few years, I can fully identify with the accuracy of the character portrayals. Having seen all four seasons, I think what turns some people off about The Wire is the realization that these horrors exist within the borders of arguably the world's richest and most talented nation. It also serves as a source that re-opens the wounds of subject matter long identified as on-going by some and self-imposed by others. And while the true ugliness of city life in Baltimore (or any other city for that matter) has been scaled back for the sake of television, The Wire does an exemplary job of capturing the struggles of life, love and betrayal; both personal and professional, in a politically forgotten, poverty stricken metropolis of American antiquity. By the way, the special features portion is especially revealing. The film, characters and its creators have developed a show that will, if not anything else, force you to ask critical questions pertaining to the implementation of capitalism.

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[1, 2]","The comments the preceded my catching up to The Wire's 4th season were that this fourth season was ""a watermark for dramatic television"" or ""the best thing ever filmed.""  Those are some lofty bits of praise to rise up to, and after falling deeply in love with the first three seasons of The Wire, I'm afraid I don't share the same reservationless love for season four as I do for the first three.  Let me be quick about what I think doesn't actually work - too much budget talk (Carcetti gets into office and what we do is go over the books?), too much drama at the school about struggles with language arts testing scores (this is The Wire, full of beauracratic cynicism, but testing is a bit of a necessary evil), and, mostly, less bombs set off than in previous seasons - our beloved main characters mostly make it through the year unscathed until the last couple of episodes, which is different from how they've done things in the past.That said, what's left are some of the most memorable moments for our beloved street thugs and not-always-as-beloved cops and politicians, plus an endless string of memorable moments following four boys who'll grow up to meet some destiny this season or the next.  The season surprises most of all with Naimond (Julito McCullum) and Michael (Tristan Wilds), two friends of various degrees of potential whose stories defy predictability by drawing you in with the kid, teenager, and the adult peeking out of every interaction they have.  We follow them as they flirt with, walk away from, and, quietly, conclude where their lives on the street and in school will take them, and the results are both subtle and heartbreaking, enormous and genuine.  This show has never had a bad performance, but in season four, it's McCullum and Wilds who take honest, no frills acting to a new degree - when Naimond quietly cries, in the season's penultimate episode, ""Michael isn't Michael anymore,"" you know not only the sad truth of that statement, but also both the tragedy and hope of the society that changes dreams and molds life.

1078342,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B000QXDJLI,James Hiller,"[11, 12]","I just finished watching the last episode of Season 4 of the HBO drama ""The Wire"". And I can say without any hesitation, the Wire is groundbreaking, one of the finest television series to ever hit the airwaves. Gritty, realistic, with a heart and soul for it's characters that's wide and awesome. I'm literally in shock over what I was able to watch over the last few nights.Oddly, I hadn't watched any of the episode leading up to this season. My initial interest in the show was for the ""school"" focus it had; and the realities of education today. I've been attuned to watching other shows that featured schools, and have become very cynical about them in the past. In most shows, the kids are clean, well dressed, well fed, and sit primly at their desks, in a classroom of 12 twelves, offering witty retorts to the teacher. It's enough to make anyone who's spent time in American classrooms of today hurl. The Wire offers no such premise, but an insightful wisdom that has never been shown on television before.One storyline in this season of the Wire, for there are many, involve four neighborhood boys, Randy, Dukie, Michael, and Namond, who are just entering the eighth grade. They've formed a tight bond, each one offering something to their group, each one a potential victim in the drug world of Baltimore. As the season plays along, each finds themselves in situations where their decision making ability is put to the test, and it's their decisions  at crucial times that drive the honest of their stories. The four actors that play this quartet simply steal the show with their realism, senses of rage, injustice, and eventually, despair.I could go on and on about the school aspect of this show. They got so much right, the lack of classroom supplies, the overcrowded, disenfranchised students, the sole stress on high stakes testing at the expense of meaningful learning, the teachers -- some visionary and bold, some sell outs. It's the school, the new teacher, Mr. Prez, and how he gives his heart to these kids that offer the true heart of this season's narratives.Aside from the school, the series also soars with it's continuing drug lord stories that are so incredibly and horrifically played out. Chased by a brave band of police folk, their interplays with the thriving Baltimore drug scene show the complexity of this issue, much beyond ""Just saying no"". Police politics, and an upcoming mayoral election, prove devastating for ""the Wire"", as the department is gutted and it's staff sent elsewhere. Everyone, and I mean, EVERYONE turns in such an amazing performance, you would have thought that they were born to play these roles.My head is spinning. I'm now going to start back at season one, and see how this show began, to inform my honored season 4.

We see a bit less of some of our cast favorites and focus more on the race for Mayor and on the Baltimore school system.(None of what follows is a spoiler.) Mayor Royce makes a series of mis-steps, alienates the police high command, and gives white guy Tommy Carcetti a real chance of winning. Former cop Prezbuluski is now a school teacher and does his best to keep several new characters in school and off the corners. The major case squad is broken up and the cops are reduced to ""rip and run"" operations against minor drug dealers. Drug kingpin Marlowe may have found a way to get to Omar, who is still ripping off the major dealers. At first, I was a bit disappointed to see so little of the people I wanted to see more of, but then I realized that this show is going all the way - it's not just the cops and the dealers; it is the entire panorama of big city life....and death.If you love sprawling epic novels like Middlemarch or Bleak House, you'll love the Wire. This is a stunningly intelligent, affectionate, sad, and angry portrait of Baltimore, its diverse citizens, and the institutions that fail them. The fourth season focuses on the (super-segregated) school system and is the best one yet. Its main characters start out as four funny 8th-grade boys in the inner city, and it tracks their perilous journeys into manhood. The adults in their lives are a very mixed bag, and even the well-intentioned ones can't always hold sway over the poverty, violence, and neglect in these children's lives. Everyone in America should watch this season and ask themselves how the richest country in the world can allow such horrors to happen to so many children.The cast is huge, but my favorite Wire characters include Sgt. Carver, the exasperated cop trying to keep these kids safe and out of trouble; Mr. Prez, their novice, hapless math teacher who eventually learns to teach probabilities by letting the kids play dice; Cutty, the ex-con boxing coach, who tries to teach the boys how to fight with honor; and mayoral candidate Tom Carcetti, a wonderfully complex blend of smarts, sleaze, self-righteousness, and idealism. I can't think of another show with so many well-drawn and interesting characters. This is about as close to great literature as TV can get. Try it, you won't regret it! Tip: If you have trouble following the thick ""Ballmer"" accents, the closed captioning helps a ton.Examining each link in the drug ""food chain,"" this innovative HBO drama set in the thick of inner-city Baltimore includes everyone from junkies and dealers to cops and politicians. While the third season focused on the investigation of drug kingpin Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris), the show expands to tackle the urban education system's role in fueling the proliferation of drugs. Among the ensemble cast are Dominic West and Frankie Faison.castDominic West  John DomanIdris Elba  Frankie R.

1078358,A2ZY5IX8MDRJY7,B000QXDJLI,Lloyd J. Peasley,"[0, 0]","The best thing about this series is trying to figure out EXACTLY what's going on. Nothing is spelled out; there are no expository scenes, no ""previously on THE WIRE""....introductions; you have to piece it all together from a series of shortish scenes in which there are no concessions to any unfamiliarity with street or police-patois. We have to do all the work ourselves.In other words, this series is MADE for DVD-viewing. I can understand why this wasn't a ratings success when originally shown on TV; how could you possibly remember everything you need to follow all the story-lines when you're only getting one episode a week? Even with the DVD's you might need to watch the episodes a couple of times to grasp it all. So if you like TV that demands intensive viewing this may well be the ne plus ultra of the breed.Not that a lot happens. If you require a series of dramatic happenings a la ""24"" to keep you engaged you're probably going to be bored. The object is to be as realistic and un-TV as possible and if that means there isn't going to be an outlandish twist in the plot every 30 minutes or so then so be it. In fact, it's more like a quasi-documentary than a dramatic fiction. No doubt it'll be employed in classrooms as an aid to understanding inner-city problems; it's very strong in showing the nearly intractable problems of policing and educating a city like Baltimore. To its credit, this show doesn't preach or propose any comprehensive solutions; its related weakness is that it tends to dabble in ideas without coming to any conclusions at all.Which may well be the reason I wasn't completely satisfied. It's just that I require some sort of resolution and neither in its dramatic or its sociological aspects did I get any sense of....what is the word of the zeitgeist?.......CLOSURE, that's it! Perhaps Season Five will do the trick?I should mention that you will almost certainly need to have watched (AND understood) SEASON THREE first before viewing this.

1078359,A4EKVQER3YGZC,B000QXDJLI,Lovethefuture,"[0, 0]","*Spoiler alert*Before I begin my review, I want to warn you that I'll be discussing some plot points that occured in season 3. If you haven't seen seasons 1-3 of 'The Wire', then I highly recommend you do not read further.Ready? Okay.With Stringer Bell dead and Avon Barksdale out of the picture, 'The Wire' was now forced to focus on new characters and plot lines. This was accomplished by directing the majority of the scenes onto a group of young kids in conjunction with the political race for the next mayor of Baltimore.I think season 4 did a nice job of keeping things moving along. With the two biggest villains from previous seasons off the show, evil was now embodied by the characters of Marlo, Snoop, and Chris. Terrifying figures for sure, but certainly not the complex characters we came to know in both Stringer and Avon.Another huge change in season 4 was the absence of McNulty. Sure, he was still on the show, but he played a much smaller role in season 4. McNulty is one of the more entertaining and engaging characters from 'The Wire', and I think the season overall suffered from his lack of involvement in the story lines.Of course 'The Wire' is always filled with interesting story lines and superb acting. I certainly can't label season 4 as anything less than 'excellent'. However I personally did not enjoy it much as the instant classics that were seasons 1-3. However I do hold it to be a level above a startlingly uneven season 5. (Which I've also reviewed on this site.)",4,"Brilliant, But A Notch Below Seasons 1-3.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[61, 63]","The fourth season of HBO's critically acclaimed The Wire picks up after the explosive events the conclusion to the third season, as cop Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West) finds himself patroling the streets of Baltimore and seemingly out of the loop (McNulty is relegated to more of a supporting player in these episodes than ever before) as this season focuses on the coming election between Mayor Royce (Glynn Turman) and Tommy Carcetti (Aidan Gillen), and a group of young corner kids getting ready to go back to school.  What makes this season of The Wire so surprisingly compelling isn't the drama between the cops and the crooks like we've seen before, but what this group of young corner boys (Maestro Harrell, Julito McCullum, Tristan Wilds) experience and the choices they make, which not only effect their own lives, but inexplicably effect the lives of everyone else involved as well.  In the meantime, new kingpin Marlo (Jamie Hector) makes even more of an impact as the cops try to nail him, Herc (Domenick Lombardozzi) finally gets his stripes, Prez (Jim True-Frost) becomes a teacher, and Omar (Michael K. Williams) gets in over his head when he goes toe to toe with Marlo.  By the end of season four, it is apparent that the end is near, and that McNulty and his crew are sitting on a powder keg that will be as explosive as anything that has ever been seen on HBO.

(Don't read any further if you don't want to know any detail of what happens in this Season of the show).On street level, Stringer Bell is dead, Avon Barksdale is back behind bars and the cold and wilful Marlo Stansfield (played by Jamie Hector) looks like he's squaring up to be crowned king. Preston ""Bodie"" Broadus (played by JD Williams) is the only true Barksdale soldier still holding it down but finds it's a whole new game with a whole new set of rules. Meanwhile, the drug dealers' nightmare that is Omar (played by Michael K Williams) has a new prot&eacute;g&eacute; in tow and he's as busy as ever. The scene when he and Marlo finally come face to face is pure TV heaven.On law level, political involvement in the Major Crimes Unit sends its best personnel off in all different directions: Lieutenant Daniels (played by Lance Reddick) gets promoted out, Detectives Kima Greggs (played by Sonja Sohn) and Lester Freamon (played by Clarke Peters) are squeezed out - and back to Homicide - and Detective Jimmy McNulty (played by Dominic West) realises he's running the risk of losing his soul and goes back on patrol. He also gives up the booze and tries to become a family man. The end result of all this is that no one is really up on the wire and by the time the incredible number of bodies being stacked up in vacant houses by Marlo's two lieutenants Chris and Snoop (played by Gbenga Akinnagbe and Felicia Pearson) come to light, there are so many of them, the task of solving the crimes seem pretty much unsurmountable to the shocked law enforcement personnel.On City Hall level, Councilman Tommy Carcetti (played by Aiden Gillen) does the unimaginable and wins the mayoral elections in Baltimore but finds it might be the beginning of his battles rather than the end.And if all that were not enough, in the middle school system, the 'No Child Left Behind' programme is shown up for what it really is, while 8th graders - some, like Michael (played by Tristan Wilds) and Dukie (played by Jermaine Hawkins) with drug addicted parents; some, like Namond Brice (played by Julito McCullum) with drug dealing parents - dad Wee-Bey (played by Hassan Johnson) is in prison and mother De'Londa (played by Sandi McCree) wants her little boy to grow up and be just like his daddy - and tragically, some with no parents at all - Randy (played by Maestro Harrell) is in foster care and Sherrod (played by Rashad Orange) is taken under wing by Bubbles (played by Andre Royo) of all people - are left to their own devices and to the lure of the streets. Some of the younger kids like the streetwise and smart-mouthed Kenard (played by Thuliso Dingwall) and the car-stealing, joy-riding Donut, so small he can barely see over the steering wheels of the cars he jacks (played by Nathan Corbett), we don't get to see their parents at all. Ever.And this is not even the half of it. The scene is thus set for the fourth season of this incredibly articulate HBO series and on many levels, primarily due to the focus of school-age children, it might prove to be the most explosive season of all. With its awesome ensemble cast, ""The Wire"" continues to draw the highest praise from the most unexpected of quarters all over the world. Don't miss this. And don't let the complex storylines, unglamorous settings or gritty (and often violent) scenes and colourful language put you off. It's like watching real life or reading a novel. In the real world, situations do not usually get resolved within 50 minutes, just as they don't get tied up neatly within a chapter of a book. It was appointment TV for me on the FX channel earlier this year and I so cannot wait for the DVD. This is without a doubt, the best thing on TV.PS. I've deliberately refrained from using the B word because I've come to understand that it upsets certain people and I totally understand why.We could be missing the point though, with the utmost respect. The stories that are being told here - and they are just stories by the way; ""The Wire"" is not a documentary series or even a docudrama - could be told from Washington DC, Miami, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit or any major US city and still be just as authentic, and just as believable. I don't believe The Wire is a statement about a particular city. I think the creators and writers have just gone with the location they know - and love, it has to be said.I don't feel it's a statement about America either, particularly. Drug addiction, drug wars (the so-called wars being fought against drugs and the wars the drug dealers are contantly fighting amongst themselves), the proliferation of guns in our communities, political corruption and, (as is highlighted in this particular season), deficient child educational systems in particular and the way children are collectively being failed by the very society that is supposed to protect and nurture them in general, are all evident all over the world if we know where to look.IMO, these are stories about human nature and the different ways in which man's actions affect the world we live in.

It is about the failure of institutions and - more specifically - the ramnifications for the people those institutions have failed. Government, law enforcement, family, and now... education, in the season that made me quite literally sit up, put my head in my hands, pause the show, and try and put into words (unsuccessfully) just how great it is.And while the fourth season is an OK place for new viewers to jump in, longtime viewers will find this to be the most rewarding of the show's run thus far. Not only has the major crimes unit, the heart of the series, been scattered across the police department, but so, essentially, has the remainder of the Barksdale crew. Marlo Stanfield and his crew, however, are making their play to become kings of the corner, and they're so efficient in their methods that the cops have yet to put a body on 'em.But the heart of this season is the struggle for four young boys in the Baltimore city school system. One of them has a connection to the Barksdales. Another, Randy Wagstaff, has - I think, anyway - a connection to Prop Joe's people, as he shares a surname with Calvin 'Cheese' Wagstaff, Joe's nephew. Their stories play out and, naturally, dovetail with those of other characters, as it seems only 'The Wire' can make happen.To see the journey that nearly all of the 'Wire' characters go on this season is truly amazing, and as so often happens in real life, heartbreaking. There are no easy answers; they are no angels or devils... only humans wading through gray in a world that wants them to be black and white.I'm three episodes into the fifth season - which adds a new failing institution, the media - and I can already see the strings being pulled taut as the series prepares to wrap up.DO NOT miss out on this show. It isn't just, as creator David Simon says, 'about the America that America forgot.' It's also about the America that did the forgettting, and it's the greatest show on TV, bar none.

A educational drama, yes, but not great Tv show, not by a long shot.In this latest season of HBO's The Wire, David Simon and Co. try to follow the footsteps of the past seasons  into the schools and largely fail. Why?First off, the Wire main case of the the school's ails is flawed and doesn't have the same dramatic execution of last season's legalization of drugs. Additionally the ""hidden bodies"" case that is exposed at the end of the season, does not match up to the great intrigue of past season's single investigations. Also, the school story is simply  too complicated of a story to cover in a single TV season.Secondly, as with the last seasons, the show never really delivers the satisfying emotional punch of a hit TV show which is sad  considering this is the forth season of the show.

But survive they do, and life goes on.  However, when children get into the mix, as they do in Season 4, the bitter taste of this convoluted stew makes the streets of Baltimore seem so unbearably sad.  Season 4 puts young faces on a sweeping social malaise that haunts Baltimore (and many American cities, for that matter).  The problem is, nobody wants to see them.  Unless, of course, they get into trouble - the point at which they get lots of attention and are generally demonized.  This series dares to tell the truth - hence its lack of awards and general neglect.Watch THE WIRE.

1078377,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000QXDJLI,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 2]","Once again, this season expands into new territory.  It already covers city politics, the so-called drug war, and cops v. gangsters.  This time around, a whole new roster of characters - the children who will staff the street and those who will be preyed upon - is introduced.  The child actors are absolutely perfect, indeed there is not a single note from them that does not ring true.  You empathize with them, even though their experience is beyond anything us suburban types could truly imagine.  You hope for these kids, despise some of them, and weep for their lack of options.Meanwhile, the lives of the cops move on.  Having taken a beat cop position far beneath his talents, McNulty seems to have turned his life around with a new relationship, moderate drinking, and some satisfaction at his accomplishments however ambivalent he feels about ending the game with Barksdale.  You really hope for him as the other cops take center stage.  But the real action is in the schools, where the ex-cops (Prez and the disillusioned and controversial captain who quasi-legalized drugs) are attempting to reach the kids.  And of course, there is the rise of Marlo, the shrewd sociopath who is taking the crown of Baltimore drug king.What is so amazing about this series is that it never falls into formula or stereotype.  In addition to surprise plot twists, the characters are so realistic that the viewer believes them implicitly.  Even the ironies are believable.  In terms of resolutions, things are never cleanly tied off, but end in compromise or failure, often tragically.Warmly recommended.

1078382,A3H4EV4UMST3HV,B000QXDJLI,steve b,"[5, 5]","The Wire started off as the best and most inteligent cop show on TV. It has now moved on and is simply the bravest and best series ever to come out of America, or Britain for that matter. The is still a lot of cops and drug dealer stuff, but that plot line has to share time with the infighting at City Hall, the Baltimore Police Department and the failures of the Baltimore school system. Without giving to much away, if the local politicians, the police and the schools were as efficient as the drug buisness, then Baltimore would be a much better place to live. While the bosses at the Police Department are fighting amougst themshelves and trying to hide rather than fight crime, the drug dealers have set up a Co-Op to organise the trade in narcotics.However the main story line concerns four teenagers and their struggle to get something from school and stay out the corner drug trade. The good teachers, including 'Prez' who has left the police, are ground down by the system which presumes that the kids will fail.The new drug kingpin is Marlo from series 3 a cold businessman whose ruthlessness makes Avon Barkesdale look like your ideal neighbour. One draw back is that because of the various plot lines and the many more characters, all of whom are in true Wire style are given time to develop, you may see to little of your favourite characters from the first three series. In my case this was true with to little being seen of Lester and Kima. Glad to say however that Omar is still plying his deadly and strangely honourable trade.This is the only show I have seen which portrays working class and underclass America in such detail. It may seem hopeless but you do see people, mainly women, maintaining a decent life under the most extreme circumstances. Others like Cutty turn their back on crime and try to help the neighbourhood kids. In this series even Wee Bay, a ruthless hitman is shown to have a decent side when it comes to keeping his son out of 'The Game'As in the previous three series there is not a weak performance.This series however the prize must go to Andre Royo as Bubbles who may be a drug addict but is also possably the best man in the series. It will break your heart to what happens to him and Royo's acting is a good as you will ever see.The bonus features give a lot of interesting information including that a lot of the story and the characters are based on reality. There was for instance a real Baltimore Homicide cop called Bunk.If you are already a fan you will not need any urging to watch the series.If you have never watched it go out and buy the first three series because once you have watched the first you will want to see the rest.Comment Comment | Permalink",5,TV does not get any better on either side of the Atlantic,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,2713,"['Wire', 'started', 'off', 'best', 'most', 'inteligent', 'cop', 'show', 'TV', 'now', 'moved', 'simply', 'bravest', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'come', 'America', 'Britain', 'matter', 'still', 'lot', 'cops', 'drug', 'dealer', 'stuff', 'plot', 'line', 'share', 'time', 'infighting', 'City', 'Hall', 'Baltimore', 'Police', 'Department', 'failures', 'Baltimore', 'school', 'system', 'giving', 'much', 'away', 'local', 'politicians', 'police', 'schools', 'were', 'as', 'efficient', 'drug', 'buisness', 'then', 'Baltimore', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'place', 'live', 'bosses', 'Police', 'Department', 'are', 'fighting', 'amougst', 'themshelves', 'trying', 'hide', 'rather', 'fight', 'crime', 'drug', 'dealers', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'Co-Op', 'organise', 'trade', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'concerns', 'four', 'teenagers', 'struggle', 'get', 'something', 'school', 'stay', 'corner', 'drug', 'trade', 'good', 'teachers', 'including', ""'Prez"", 'who', 'left', 'police', 'are', 'ground', 'down', 'system', 'kids', 'will', 'fail.The', 'new', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Marlo', 'series', '3', 'cold', 'businessman', 'ruthlessness', 'Avon', 'Barkesdale', 'look', 'ideal', 'neighbour', 'One', 'draw', 'back', 'various', 'plot', 'lines', 'many', 'more', 'characters', 'whom', 'are', 'true', 'Wire', 'style', 'are', 'given', 'time', 'develop', 'may', 'see', 'little', 'favourite', 'characters', 'first', 'three', 'series', 'case', 'was', 'true', 'little', 'being', 'seen', 'Lester', 'Kima', 'Glad', 'say', 'however', 'Omar', 'still', 'plying', 'deadly', 'strangely', 'honourable', 'trade.This', 'only', 'show', 'have', 'seen', 'working', 'class', 'underclass', 'America', 'such', 'detail', 'may', 'seem', 'hopeless', 'do', 'see', 'people', 'mainly', 'women', 'maintaining', 'decent', 'life', 'most', 'extreme', 'circumstances', 'Others', 'Cutty', 'turn', 'back', 'crime', 'try', 'help', 'neighbourhood', 'kids', 'series', 'even', 'Wee', 'Bay', 'ruthless', 'hitman', 'shown', 'have', 'decent', 'side', 'when', 'keeping', 'son', ""'The"", ""Game'As"", 'previous', 'three', 'series', 'not', 'weak', 'performance.This', 'series', 'however', 'prize', 'must', 'go', 'Andre', 'Royo', 'Bubbles', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'drug', 'addict', 'also', 'possably', 'best', 'man', 'series', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'what', 'Royo', 'acting', 'good', 'will', 'ever', 'see.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'give', 'lot', 'interesting', 'information', 'including', 'lot', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'based', 'reality', 'was', 'instance', 'real', 'Baltimore', 'Homicide', 'cop', 'called', 'Bunk.If', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'will', 'not', 'need', 'urging', 'watch', 'series.If', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'first', 'three', 'series', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'rest.Comment', 'Comment', '|', 'Permalink']",The Wire: Season 4

Did my research and ordered Season 4 (to start with).Easily the most dynamic TV series of my lifetime.  Incredible acting (and from such young kids), brilliant writing and great storylines.Powerful, engaging, thought-provoking, eye-popping, emotional, deep, inspiring, gripping, maddening.There aren't enough words 2 describe this show.I think what makes this season so real is the fact you'll look at the four boys and easily place them in your own lives as people you'd know.  So to see them face real world problems and make life/death decisions at such young ages and with relatively little information, it hits home hard.This is what I call ""Reality Television.""  What makes this show all the more impactful is the fact that, sadly, most of these scenarios and portrayals are at least loosely based on real events that went down (and continue 2 go down) in the streets of Baltimore.I believe a stat from the Special Features Documentary says that 80% of the characters depicted were based on real people!

The acting is beyond superb - every character is portrayed so well you believe absolutely they exist. The script is perfect, the directing also, settings ... it simply is not to be missed. It's harder to watch than the other seasons, as it has more about the fallout of the drug scene on children and the part about the schools is real (we know well how ""No Child Left Behind"" has decimated what's left of inner city schools and this is an accurate portrayal) and therefore very difficult to watch. However, the outstanding quality of this series is worth it.

Having left the police force, Det. 'Prez' Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost) takes a job as an eight grade teacher and becomes this year's MVP. Education and politics wrap themselves around each other as an intense Mayoral race where Tommy Carcetti (Aidan Gillen) is trying to upset the political establishment while another formally disgraced officer ""Bunny"" Colvin (Robert Wisdom) again tries to break convention by taking problem students and derailing the ""pass 'em up"" mentality forced on schools by ""No Child Left Behind.""In fact, major player Jimmy McNulty takes something of a backseat this season (although he takes an astonishing turn inthe fifth season) to the electoral intrigue. That is not to say the drugs and the corners are gone; the rise of Marlo Stansfield takes a major place in the multi-story plotlines.

Marlo was ill defined and Bunny's plan to reduce murders seemed just a little too good to be true. The city politics portion was not nearly as interesting as the dock workers from season 2.With season 4, there is a feeling of renewal. The Avon Barksdale/Stringer Bell dynamic that dominated seasons 1 and 3 (and got some of the best moments in season 2) is gone, replaced by a much scarier sociopath in Marlo. Avon and Stringer killed people sometimes with little cause, but there was always a cause. Marlo is a combination of power hunger and poor impulse control. A shadowy figure in season 3, he comes into his own as the winner from last season. McNulty is mostly MIA with the clean living that makes him show up every so often to act like the friend that you're happy for but you kind of wish he was still fun (although the fact that his absence was due toHannibal Rising (Unrated Widescreen Edition)is kind of sad) but you don't miss him nearly as much as you think you would. The show has become too much of an ensemble show by this time to have any one character be too predominant (which is what they said aboutER - The Complete First Seasonbut look how awful that show got after George Clooney's departure)Of course, the center of this season is the Baltimore school system. Told from the perspective of Pryzbylski as a new teacher and four students, the show follows the ups and downs as Dukie, Michael, Randy and Wey Bey jr. (sorry forgot the character's name) deal with poverty, outside forces, classmates and a school system that is constantly on the brink of collapse. Prez isn't the Great White Hope teacher (in fact he's pretty bad in most cases) but he is trying his best. And in the world of the Wire, that's not nearly good enough.The nice thing about this show is that you don't automatically know who is going to rise and fall by the conventions of the genre. Some stories are uplifting. Some are tragic (ok most are tragic) but there's a courage among the characters that you can't help but admire.",5,Return to form,1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,2268,"['Even', 'Wire', 'based', 'slow', 'storytelling', 'where', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'take', 'time', 'establish', 'situation', 'characters', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'wondering', 'ifThe', 'Wire', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Seasonwas', 'just', 'playing', 'time', 'Marlo', 'was', 'ill', 'defined', 'Bunny', 'plan', 'reduce', 'murders', 'seemed', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'city', 'politics', 'portion', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'interesting', 'dock', 'workers', 'season', '2.With', 'season', '4', 'feeling', 'renewal', 'Avon', 'Barksdale/Stringer', 'Bell', 'dominated', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'got', 'best', 'moments', 'season', '2', 'gone', 'replaced', 'much', 'scarier', 'sociopath', 'Marlo', 'Avon', 'Stringer', 'killed', 'people', 'sometimes', 'little', 'cause', 'there', 'was', 'always', 'cause', 'Marlo', 'combination', 'power', 'hunger', 'poor', 'impulse', 'control', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'season', '3', 'own', 'winner', 'last', 'season', 'McNulty', 'mostly', 'MIA', 'clean', 'living', 'show', 'up', 'so', 'often', 'act', 'friend', ""'re"", 'happy', 'kind', 'wish', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'fact', 'absence', 'was', 'due', 'toHannibal', 'Rising', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'kind', 'sad', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'think', 'would', 'show', 'become', 'too', 'much', 'ensemble', 'show', 'time', 'have', 'one', 'character', 'be', 'too', 'predominant', 'what', 'said', 'aboutER', 'Complete', 'First', 'Seasonbut', 'look', 'how', 'awful', 'show', 'got', 'George', 'Clooney', 'departure', 'course', 'center', 'season', 'Baltimore', 'school', 'system', 'Told', 'perspective', 'Pryzbylski', 'new', 'teacher', 'four', 'students', 'show', 'ups', 'downs', 'Dukie', 'Michael', 'Randy', 'Wey', 'Bey', 'jr.', 'sorry', 'forgot', 'character', 'name', 'deal', 'poverty', 'outside', 'forces', 'classmates', 'school', 'system', 'constantly', 'brink', 'collapse', 'Prez', ""n't"", 'Great', 'White', 'Hope', 'teacher', 'fact', 'pretty', 'bad', 'most', 'cases', 'trying', 'best', 'world', 'Wire', 'not', 'nearly', 'good', 'enough.The', 'nice', 'thing', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'know', 'who', 'going', 'rise', 'fall', 'conventions', 'genre', 'stories', 'are', 'uplifting', 'are', 'tragic', 'ok', 'most', 'are', 'tragic', 'courage', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire']",The Wire: Season 4

I quickly became a huge fan, and theres a number of reasons why.The writing for ""The Wire"" is nothing short of incredible. It's not written by ""TV Writers"" but more experienced authors and this makes quite a difference. A season of The Wire unfolds like a great novel. As each episode goes by, the greater the story builds. Its full of amazing characters and has many special touches and little nuances that are a joy to watch. The cast is fantastic and all the actors do a wonderful job.I think what many people tend to miss is the importance of the storylines and the issues that David Simon and his team are addressing. In season 3 the storyline of Major Bunny Colvin ""decriminalising"" drugs in a certain area of his district was an amazing look at the world of crime and drugs. It was such an incredible storyline, because it wasn't black and white. An amazing hypothetical that leaves me thinking to this day.  This season they tackle the school system with even greater nous and intelligence.The Wire is television at its very best, it also demands a lot from the viewer. It's definitely worth repeat viewing of the episodes. If you put the time in to notice the detail of the show it is extremely rewarding. The intricate storylines, complex characters, and revealing insights into life and institutions are waiting for your viewership. Season 4 of The Wire is the greatest season of the show.  Following the four young children throughout the season was truly heartbreaking.  If ever you wanted to own a show on DVD it's this one.  This will go down in history as one of the greats.",5,Unbelievable Season of the best show on Television,1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,1832,"['criminal', 'amount', 'people', 'watch', 'best', 'drama', 'television', 'Wire', 'started', 'watching', 'David', 'Simon', 'man', 'wrote', 'book', 'ultimately', 'became', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'time', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'quickly', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'number', 'reasons', 'why.The', 'writing', 'Wire', 'nothing', 'short', 'incredible', 'not', 'written', 'TV', 'Writers', 'more', 'experienced', 'authors', 'quite', 'difference', 'season', 'Wire', 'unfolds', 'great', 'novel', 'episode', 'greater', 'story', 'full', 'amazing', 'characters', 'many', 'special', 'touches', 'little', 'nuances', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job.I', 'think', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'tend', 'miss', 'importance', 'storylines', 'issues', 'David', 'Simon', 'team', 'are', 'addressing', 'season', '3', 'storyline', 'Major', 'Bunny', 'Colvin', 'decriminalising', 'drugs', 'certain', 'area', 'district', 'was', 'amazing', 'look', 'world', 'crime', 'drugs', 'was', 'such', 'incredible', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'black', 'white', 'amazing', 'hypothetical', 'thinking', 'day', 'season', 'tackle', 'school', 'system', 'even', 'greater', 'nous', 'intelligence.The', 'Wire', 'television', 'very', 'best', 'also', 'lot', 'viewer', 'definitely', 'worth', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'episodes', 'put', 'time', 'notice', 'detail', 'show', 'extremely', 'rewarding', 'intricate', 'storylines', 'complex', 'characters', 'revealing', 'insights', 'life', 'institutions', 'are', 'waiting', 'viewership', 'Season', '4', 'Wire', 'greatest', 'season', 'show', 'Following', 'four', 'young', 'children', 'season', 'was', 'truly', 'heartbreaking', 'ever', 'wanted', 'own', 'show', 'DVD', 'one', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'greats']",The Wire: Season 4
1078390,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B000QXDJLI,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[2, 2]","Well, someone complained that I'd given away too much in my comments on the third season. So I'll try to restrain myself for this, the finest yet of the finest show on the tube.The first season was on drug dealers, the second on the attempted survival of a stevedoers union and their connection with the underworld, including drug dealers. The third season back to drug dealers, a cop, Major Colvin, played by Robert Wisdom, modeled after Ball'mer's former Mayor Kurt Schmoke suggesting that drugs be legalized thereby minimizing the associated problems, and a newcomer to the drug dealers, perhaps the most ruthless yet, Marlo Stanfield (played masterfully by Jamie Hector.) And there's the politics, police bureacracy and corruption, political corruption at city and state levels, and a mayoral election which you have to see to follow.This season took a slightly different directions:Roland Presbolewski--God knows I may have misspelled that--was the son in law of a police bigwig. He'd done his share of screw ups, but had survived them. He also had some traits making him worth holding on to. But at the end of the third season, he killed another cop. Accident, true, but he couldn't handle it any more. So at the beginning of season four, he decides to teach at a Baltimore middle school.Suffice it to say that he hadn't a clue as to how hard it would be to do so. Well, the script was brilliantly written to include Major Colvin ""legalized"" drugs therefore list his job became part of a University of Maryland project to investigate and socialize hopeless kids. Yeah, yeah, that's oversimplifying, but it'll do, I hope. So there's a whole new cast of characters: middle school kids. What will become of them? Are they becoming drug dealers? Eventually going straight?The kids were fabulous as actors. One was pretty bright, but his mother, strung out constantly, would sell his clothes, any food they had. Still another was hungry all the time for the same reason, and another had a foster mother who was strict, so he knew who was boss. Then there's Namond, the son of Wey Bay who's in the State Pen. His mother can't comprehend him becoming any more than a ""soldier"" as that's her definition of manhood, and the means that she became comfortable, relying on her hubby's take from the drug dealing.One of the kids, incidentally, becomes beholden to Marlo; his brother's father, for whom he has no taste, returns from prison and the kid has Marlo's crew--well, see it or I'll be seen as giving too much away.I'm almost inclined to give too much away the story is so good. One of the best episodes was when Bunny Colvin, the ""bad cop"" turned trainer of bad kids, took the winners of a little class contest to a classy restaurant for dinner. The kids couldn't even figure out what to do with a napkin, wondered what a waitress was--it was so far from their culture they couldn't even understand what anything more than a quarter pounder with cheese was!Anyway, as I'm somewhat familiar with that portion of Baltimore, I could distantly relate to the reality of what was going on.There were a couple of features on the DVDs too, both of which addressed the reality of the series. I talked with people in the Baltimore school system and they relate to how realistic it is, though depressing.If you're after a ""feel good"" series, this ain't for you. If you're after what's going on with the deterioration of American cities, I powerfully recommend it.There's so much more I could have said but really don't want to give anything away.As others have mentioned, there is fortunately a fifth season, which has already started. Unfortunately, it's the last one. They did a wrap up, and there was a fine article in the Washington Post about it barely a week ago. This whole series should be watched, reflected upon, and learned from in every city in the US. It was nice to hear on one of the ""features"" that it's making it to Irish TV and in some other countries. They need a dose of reality.",5,True dat....Feel me?,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,3989,"['Well', 'someone', 'complained', ""'d"", 'given', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'comments', 'third', 'season', 'So', ""'ll"", 'try', 'restrain', 'finest', 'yet', 'finest', 'show', 'tube.The', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'drug', 'dealers', 'second', 'attempted', 'survival', 'stevedoers', 'union', 'connection', 'underworld', 'including', 'drug', 'dealers', 'third', 'season', 'back', 'drug', 'dealers', 'cop', 'Major', 'Colvin', 'played', 'Robert', 'Wisdom', 'modeled', ""Ball'mer"", 'former', 'Mayor', 'Kurt', 'Schmoke', 'suggesting', 'drugs', 'be', 'legalized', 'thereby', 'minimizing', 'associated', 'problems', 'newcomer', 'drug', 'dealers', 'perhaps', 'most', 'ruthless', 'yet', 'Marlo', 'Stanfield', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Jamie', 'Hector', 'politics', 'police', 'bureacracy', 'corruption', 'political', 'corruption', 'city', 'state', 'levels', 'mayoral', 'election', 'have', 'see', 'follow.This', 'season', 'took', 'slightly', 'different', 'directions', 'Roland', 'Presbolewski', 'God', 'may', 'have', 'misspelled', 'was', 'son', 'law', 'police', 'bigwig', ""'d"", 'done', 'share', 'screw', 'ups', 'had', 'survived', 'also', 'had', 'traits', 'making', 'worth', 'holding', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'killed', 'cop', 'Accident', 'true', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'more', 'So', 'beginning', 'season', 'four', 'teach', 'Baltimore', 'middle', 'school.Suffice', 'say', 'had', ""n't"", 'clue', 'how', 'hard', 'would', 'be', 'do', 'so', 'Well', 'script', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'include', 'Major', 'Colvin', 'legalized', 'drugs', 'therefore', 'list', 'job', 'became', 'part', 'University', 'Maryland', 'project', 'investigate', 'socialize', 'hopeless', 'kids', 'Yeah', 'yeah', 'oversimplifying', ""'ll"", 'do', 'hope', 'whole', 'new', 'cast', 'characters', 'middle', 'school', 'kids', 'What', 'will', 'become', 'Are', 'becoming', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Eventually', 'going', 'straight', 'kids', 'were', 'fabulous', 'actors', 'One', 'was', 'pretty', 'bright', 'mother', 'strung', 'out', 'constantly', 'would', 'sell', 'clothes', 'food', 'had', 'Still', 'was', 'hungry', 'time', 'same', 'reason', 'had', 'foster', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'strict', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'boss', 'Then', 'Namond', 'son', 'Wey', 'Bay', 'who', 'State', 'Pen', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'becoming', 'more', 'soldier', 'definition', 'manhood', 'means', 'became', 'comfortable', 'relying', 'hubby', 'take', 'drug', 'dealing.One', 'kids', 'incidentally', 'beholden', 'Marlo', 'brother', 'father', 'whom', 'taste', 'returns', 'prison', 'kid', 'Marlo', 'crew', 'well', 'see', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seen', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away.I', ""'m"", 'almost', 'inclined', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'story', 'so', 'good', 'One', 'best', 'episodes', 'was', 'when', 'Bunny', 'Colvin', 'bad', 'cop', 'turned', 'trainer', 'bad', 'kids', 'took', 'winners', 'little', 'class', 'contest', 'classy', 'restaurant', 'dinner', 'kids', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'napkin', 'wondered', 'what', 'waitress', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'culture', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'understand', 'what', 'anything', 'more', 'quarter', 'pounder', 'cheese', 'was', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'portion', 'Baltimore', 'could', 'distantly', 'relate', 'reality', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'on.There', 'were', 'couple', 'features', 'DVDs', 'too', 'addressed', 'reality', 'series', 'talked', 'people', 'Baltimore', 'school', 'system', 'relate', 'how', 'realistic', 'depressing.If', ""'re"", 'feel', 'good', 'series', 'ai', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'what', 'going', 'deterioration', 'American', 'cities', 'powerfully', 'recommend', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'said', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'fortunately', 'fifth', 'season', 'already', 'started', 'Unfortunately', 'last', 'one', 'did', 'wrap', 'up', 'there', 'was', 'fine', 'article', 'Washington', 'Post', 'barely', 'week', 'ago', 'whole', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'reflected', 'learned', 'city', 'US', 'was', 'nice', 'hear', 'one', 'features', 'making', 'Irish', 'TV', 'other', 'countries', 'need', 'dose', 'reality']",The Wire: Season 4
1078391,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B000QXDJLI,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[2, 2]","Twenty years ago most cop shows were simplistic tales of good verses evil and to learn about the real world one had to read books. This show however is probably better than any novel that I have read and is a remarkable portrayal of how systems work and fail to work. The systems that are examined are the police system, the school system and the criminal underclass. It is also an indictment on urban decay and how its corruption touches everyone. Even a politician who starts of as seriously motivated to reform a corrupted system.The first series of the Wire was about a successful police operation which targeted a criminal gang. This series shows how police forces can fail. The way that the drug gangs work in this show (and no doubt in real life)  is that they are hierarchical. Distribution is done by dealers on street corners employing low level operatives. The ones who handle the drugs are under age children who face lower level penalties if caught. The organisation is run by bosses who don't touch the drugs and use enforcers to kill as a means of enforcing discipline and controlling territory.  The easiest targets are the street operatives but their arrest does little to cripple the organisation as there is a reservoir of young people looking to get into the game. Lazy policing targets the street operatives as it leads to arrests but doesn't dent the basic organisation. Successful policing looks at the means of arresting the bosses and enforcers. This of course is infinitely more difficult. The organisational dynamics of the police force are that success is not measured in terms of shattering criminal organisations but in arrest statistics. Thus the police focus on the lower level of the criminal system and are at best an irritant rather than a threat to the criminal gangs.Series four looks at the education system in a decaying city and how it spawns a cadre of youth keen to go into drug dealing as the one sure career path available to them. How the notion of ""leaving not children behind"" in practice means the rote teaching of exam questions to maintain school funding and the total failure to engage the pupils of the school. The means of viewing the educational system is for the series having a new teacher trying to make a difference and the frustration he faces in trying to make a difference. Whilst he has his little successes it is against the background of a failing system.In past series the skills of police were on display. In this series a number of the heroes of the past series have been moved out of centre stage and some of the hopeless have been moved forward. A sergeant promoted above his competence is put in charge of a serious drug investigation. His surveillance camera is spotted by its target and the gang leader under surveillance plays games with him setting up a dummy operation were an innocent is arrested. The sergeant moves from one blunder to another losing his camera and then losing focus on doing his job. He is responsible for one of the central tragedies of the series when he carelessly reveals the identity of a 14 year old informant who then becomes the subject of violent reprisals. He also fails to protect another informant who works out his own revenge.Yet not only is the series a portrayal of the decay of a modern American city it is a drama with realistic and rounded characters whose world the viewer is drawn into.The last series of the Wire was a little below the high level of the first two series. However this is a blistering return to form and is without doubt some of the greatest television ever made.",5,Masterpiece,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,3596,"['Twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'most', 'cop', 'shows', 'were', 'simplistic', 'tales', 'good', 'verses', 'evil', 'learn', 'real', 'world', 'one', 'had', 'read', 'books', 'show', 'however', 'probably', 'better', 'novel', 'have', 'read', 'remarkable', 'portrayal', 'how', 'systems', 'work', 'fail', 'work', 'systems', 'are', 'examined', 'are', 'police', 'system', 'school', 'system', 'criminal', 'underclass', 'also', 'indictment', 'urban', 'decay', 'how', 'corruption', 'touches', 'everyone', 'Even', 'politician', 'who', 'seriously', 'motivated', 'reform', 'corrupted', 'system.The', 'first', 'series', 'Wire', 'was', 'successful', 'police', 'operation', 'targeted', 'criminal', 'gang', 'series', 'how', 'police', 'forces', 'can', 'fail', 'way', 'drug', 'gangs', 'work', 'show', 'doubt', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'hierarchical', 'Distribution', 'done', 'dealers', 'street', 'corners', 'employing', 'low', 'level', 'operatives', 'ones', 'who', 'handle', 'drugs', 'are', 'age', 'children', 'who', 'face', 'lower', 'level', 'penalties', 'caught', 'organisation', 'run', 'bosses', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'touch', 'drugs', 'use', 'enforcers', 'kill', 'means', 'enforcing', 'discipline', 'controlling', 'territory', 'easiest', 'targets', 'are', 'street', 'operatives', 'arrest', 'little', 'cripple', 'organisation', 'reservoir', 'young', 'people', 'looking', 'get', 'game', 'Lazy', 'policing', 'targets', 'street', 'arrests', ""n't"", 'dent', 'basic', 'organisation', 'Successful', 'policing', 'means', 'arresting', 'bosses', 'enforcers', 'course', 'infinitely', 'more', 'difficult', 'organisational', 'dynamics', 'police', 'force', 'are', 'success', 'not', 'measured', 'terms', 'shattering', 'criminal', 'organisations', 'arrest', 'statistics', 'Thus', 'police', 'focus', 'lower', 'level', 'criminal', 'system', 'are', 'best', 'irritant', 'rather', 'threat', 'criminal', 'gangs.Series', 'four', 'looks', 'education', 'system', 'decaying', 'city', 'how', 'cadre', 'youth', 'keen', 'go', 'drug', 'dealing', 'one', 'sure', 'career', 'path', 'available', 'How', 'notion', 'leaving', 'not', 'children', 'practice', 'rote', 'teaching', 'exam', 'questions', 'maintain', 'school', 'funding', 'total', 'failure', 'engage', 'pupils', 'school', 'means', 'viewing', 'educational', 'system', 'series', 'having', 'new', 'teacher', 'trying', 'make', 'difference', 'frustration', 'trying', 'make', 'difference', 'Whilst', 'little', 'successes', 'background', 'failing', 'system.In', 'series', 'skills', 'police', 'were', 'display', 'series', 'number', 'heroes', 'past', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'moved', 'centre', 'stage', 'hopeless', 'have', 'been', 'moved', 'forward', 'sergeant', 'promoted', 'competence', 'put', 'charge', 'serious', 'drug', 'investigation', 'surveillance', 'camera', 'spotted', 'target', 'gang', 'leader', 'surveillance', 'plays', 'games', 'setting', 'up', 'dummy', 'operation', 'were', 'innocent', 'arrested', 'sergeant', 'moves', 'one', 'blunder', 'losing', 'camera', 'then', 'losing', 'focus', 'doing', 'job', 'responsible', 'one', 'central', 'tragedies', 'series', 'when', 'carelessly', 'identity', '14', 'year', 'old', 'informant', 'who', 'then', 'subject', 'violent', 'reprisals', 'also', 'protect', 'informant', 'who', 'out', 'own', 'revenge.Yet', 'not', 'only', 'series', 'portrayal', 'decay', 'modern', 'American', 'city', 'drama', 'realistic', 'rounded', 'characters', 'world', 'viewer', 'drawn', 'into.The', 'last', 'series', 'Wire', 'was', 'little', 'high', 'level', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'However', 'blistering', 'return', 'form', 'doubt', 'greatest', 'television', 'ever', 'made']",The Wire: Season 4

1078394,A1XBYZX09V1OB4,B000QXDJLI,Valerie J. Saturen,"[1, 1]","THE WIRE is more than just a crime drama: with stark realism, the series probes the interconnected social problems plaguing America's inner cities. Set on the streets of West Baltimore, THE WIRE reveals the consequences of the drug trade and the corruption of the political world, while maintaining suspense and drawing the viewer into a world that all too often goes ignored.Season Four focuses on education, showing just how badly the inner city school system is failing the kids in its charge. Former cop Roland ""Prez"" Pryzbylewski becomes a teacher and does his best to reach his students despite institutional obstacles and the violence that follows them into the classroom. Since funding is dependent on student performance on standardized tests, the school's administration insists on devoting most class time to practice test questions, disrupting Prez's teaching just as he was making headway. Prez draws an interesting comparison between ""teaching to the test"" and ""juking the stats,"" whereby law enforcement makes a large number of petty arrests in order to create impressive stats, while ignoring more time-intensive serious crimes and underlying problems.The season follows four eighth grade boys--Michael, Namond, Randy, and Duquan (Dukie)--as they come of age amid the dangerous realities of the streets and the pull of the corner. Michael is a quiet observer and the unspoken leader of the group; he tries to stick to his principles, acting as a parent for his little brother Bug and maintaining his loyalty to his friends. Even though he shows little interest in the drug game, the necessity of protecting his brother makes the corners hard to resist. Namond's father is in prison, and his mother (who is used to the material comforts her husband's drug activity brought) encourages him to follow in his father's footsteps even though he is not cut out for that life. Randy, who has been shuffled through group and foster homes all his life, ends up in the home of a caring foster mother only to have his life turned upside-down when he snitches on a member of Marlo Stanfield's formidable drug empire. Dukie is intelligent and good with computers, but his situation is the direst: he barely gets enough to eat, and his family sells his clothes in order to buy drugs.One of the most tragic aspects of the show is that it shows how much is stacked up against anyone who tries to do the right thing. This is the case whether it's the four boys trying to navigate their world, a teacher striving to educate his students, law enforcement personnel following the trail of corruption or chasing a wave of homicides, a politician who must choose between children's futures and political expediency, or even a drug dealer trying to follow a dying code. As much as you root for the show's characters, THE WIRE does not sugarcoat these realities. Not too many ""Hallmark moments"" here.Bill Moyers said on his show the Journal that what Charles Dickens was to the mean streets of Victorian London, WIRE co-creator David Simon is to today's America. He's right. Full of gritty reality, nuance, and empathy, THE WIRE takes us where most of the media world refuses to go on anything other than a superficial level.

As you may or may not know, previous seasons of The Wire had fancy digipack/book style packaging which may have been part of the reason the old MSRPs were so high. Luckily the MSRP for the new fourth season is lower, but comes with a serious drawback. This season is packaged in slim pack cases, which is fine...if it's done right. I have no problem with the fact that it's a different style and that it doesn't quite match previous seasons. My frustation is due to the fact that the actual slim pack cases do not elevate the discs high enough so they rub on the cases, causing scratches. The first disc in my set has pretty bad circular scratches and I have a feeling it will skip. The other discs are in OK shape (the fourth disc has minor scratches), but chances are you'll end up with at least one scratched disc. They could have avoided this had they just designed the slim packs better. I would rather them keep the cost higher and provide proper storage, rather than treating the discs with such carelessness. This show is too awesome to have it skip on you, and besides...if I pay for a new product, I expect it to look new.
