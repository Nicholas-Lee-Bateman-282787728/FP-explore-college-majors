When this doesn't work both men come to the conclusion that having a baby would do the trick. But this too fails. At end only a 14-year-old boy brings her out of the doldrums--and gets her pregnant.

There are plenty of people who would label as perverse a movie which culminates in a 12-year-old prodigy seducing & impregnating a grown woman, and this would not be an unfair assessment.And yet, one could say that the most perverse thing about this movie is that the humor works.  Situations which should have left me appalled instead left me smiling & laughing, because when all is said & done, this is one well-crafted movie.  One can argue whether the absurdity trumps the perversity, but noone can argue that this is an exceedingly well-made, well-acted production.",4,"I liked it, but one of the oddest movies I have ever seen",1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,643,"['say', 'movie', 'not', 'everybody', 'would', 'be', 'putting', 'mildly', 'are', 'plenty', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'label', 'perverse', 'movie', '12-year-old', 'prodigy', 'seducing', 'impregnating', 'grown', 'woman', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'unfair', 'assessment.And', 'yet', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'most', 'perverse', 'thing', 'movie', 'humor', 'Situations', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'appalled', 'instead', 'left', 'smiling', 'laughing', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'one', 'well-crafted', 'movie', 'One', 'can', 'argue', 'absurdity', 'perversity', 'noone', 'can', 'argue', 'exceedingly', 'well-made', 'well-acted', 'production']",Get Out Your Handkerchiefs

It was also a time when the ""foreign film"" was what Independent films are today: the place to go for the daring, the obscene maybe, the intellectual...sometimes.(Haven't you wondered why so few foreign movies are released in the USA today?)""GOYH"" was something else again, though:  at the beginning an anarchic though sunny comedy of manners and by the end a black comedy with big concerns on it's mind dealing in 1978 (mind you) with subjects that are still taboo in the USA in 2002!The first scene of the film throws us into a situation that is  already in progress: Raoul (Gerard Depardieu) is frantic because his wife Solange (Carole Laure),lanquidly eating her saurkraut: obviously unhappy or manic depressive or both.Raoul is so desperate to make Solange happy that, when he spys Stephane (Patrick Dawaere) in the restaurant, he offers to bring him over to the table for Solange's amusement and pleasure.  And so he does.First there is just Raoul and Solange; then Stephane and Solange; then Raoul, a woman he pulls off the street to comment on what he's just done, Stephane and Solange...all sitting at the table in the restaurant. The exposition is accomplished so quickly and so absurdly that we feel we are watching a silent film comedy. Blier writes and directs this first extended scene with such expert awareness of timing and pacing that it takes your breath away and grabs your interest immediately.Ultimately, though Stephane and Raoul do their best to make Solange happy, it's Christian (Riton Liebman) who is finally the only one who touches her heart. (Don't ask)In order to make this hybrid comedy-drama-romance work the actors must be quick on their feet and possess charm and panache to spare. All those involved do and then some:  Depardieu and Dawaere, both looking young, handsome and flummoxed, Michel Serrault (soon to make a big splash in ""La Cage aux Folles""),as a neighbor who inadvertenly gets pulled into this caper and Carole Laure with probably the hardest role to pull off: part zombie, part plain-jane, part sex pot.""Get Out Your Handkerchiefs"" is pain stakingly and downright seditious in it's refusal to adhere to any social or societal rules...and because of this, it must to be cherished and revered for these attributes even now; some 24 years after it's initial release.",5,The Sauerkraut is not working.....,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,2481,"['1978', 'when', 'Bertrand', 'Blier', 'Get', 'Handkerchiefs', 'was', 'released', 'United', 'States', 'were', 'bopping', 'beat', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'was', 'also', 'time', 'when', 'foreign', 'film', 'was', 'what', 'Independent', 'films', 'are', 'today', 'place', 'go', 'daring', 'obscene', 'maybe', 'intellectual', 'sometimes', 'Have', ""n't"", 'wondered', 'why', 'so', 'few', 'foreign', 'movies', 'are', 'released', 'USA', 'today', 'GOYH', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'again', 'beginning', 'anarchic', 'sunny', 'comedy', 'manners', 'end', 'black', 'comedy', 'big', 'concerns', 'mind', 'dealing', '1978', 'subjects', 'are', 'still', 'taboo', 'USA', '2002', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'situation', 'already', 'progress', 'Raoul', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'frantic', 'wife', 'Solange', 'Carole', 'Laure', 'lanquidly', 'eating', 'saurkraut', 'obviously', 'unhappy', 'manic', 'depressive', 'both.Raoul', 'so', 'desperate', 'make', 'Solange', 'happy', 'when', 'spys', 'Stephane', 'Patrick', 'Dawaere', 'restaurant', 'bring', 'table', 'Solange', 'amusement', 'pleasure', 'so', 'does.First', 'just', 'Raoul', 'Solange', 'then', 'Stephane', 'Solange', 'then', 'Raoul', 'woman', 'street', 'comment', 'what', 'just', 'done', 'Stephane', 'Solange', 'sitting', 'table', 'restaurant', 'exposition', 'accomplished', 'so', 'quickly', 'so', 'absurdly', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'silent', 'film', 'comedy', 'Blier', 'first', 'extended', 'scene', 'such', 'expert', 'awareness', 'timing', 'pacing', 'breath', 'away', 'grabs', 'interest', 'immediately.Ultimately', 'Stephane', 'Raoul', 'do', 'best', 'make', 'Solange', 'happy', 'Christian', 'Riton', 'Liebman', 'who', 'finally', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'heart', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'order', 'make', 'hybrid', 'comedy-drama-romance', 'work', 'actors', 'must', 'be', 'quick', 'feet', 'possess', 'charm', 'panache', 'spare', 'involved', 'do', 'then', 'Depardieu', 'Dawaere', 'looking', 'young', 'handsome', 'flummoxed', 'Michel', 'Serrault', 'soon', 'make', 'big', 'splash', 'La', 'Cage', 'aux', 'Folles', 'neighbor', 'who', 'inadvertenly', 'pulled', 'caper', 'Carole', 'Laure', 'probably', 'hardest', 'role', 'pull', 'off', 'part', 'zombie', 'part', 'plain-jane', 'part', 'sex', 'pot', 'Get', 'Handkerchiefs', 'pain', 'stakingly', 'downright', 'seditious', 'refusal', 'adhere', 'social', 'societal', 'rules', 'must', 'be', 'cherished', 'revered', 'attributes', 'even', 'now', '24', 'years', 'initial', 'release']",Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
677758,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00005R24D,Randy Keehn,"[1, 7]","I took note of ""Get Out Your Hankerchiefs"" because it won the Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film"" in 1978.  I did enjoy it but I had a reaction similar to the one I got from ""Murmers of the Heart"".  ""Murmers"" pushed the envelope even farther than ""Get Out Your Hankerchiefs"" did but this comedy does eventually evolve into something that many will not see the humor in.  The director coaxes us into what many, myself included, were reluctantly ready to go along with.  However, when he carries it further, I was left disappointed.  Too bad, becaue I liked the inanity of the situation that was initially presented.  There is a lot of unique humor that is able to happen in this movie and there is a lot of talent involved in making it all happen.  I have come to accept that many European movies have relaxed standards compared to those in American Cinema.  Usually that means that I have to wait for the kids to go to bed to watch what would otherwise be a standard PG-13 film.  However, there are still taboos in our society.  A film like ""Murmers of the Heart"" might dare to examine them but for a film like ""Get out your Hankerchiefs"" to ignore and/or make light of them just didn't sit well with me.  I like to fancy myself an ""enlightened prude"" but the latter portion of ""Get Out Your Hankerchiefs"" reminded me that I must be a prude first and enlightened second.  I guess I cling to the idea that there are so many better ways to create a great movie without stooping to this level.  In all fairness, I should give this movie a ""4 Star"" rating but I took one away for propriety's sake.",3,Apparently it was Funny back Then,1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,1595,"['took', 'note', 'Get', 'Out', 'Hankerchiefs', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign-Language', 'Film', '1978', 'did', 'enjoy', 'had', 'reaction', 'similar', 'one', 'got', 'Murmers', 'Heart', 'Murmers', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'even', 'farther', 'Get', 'Hankerchiefs', 'did', 'comedy', 'eventually', 'evolve', 'something', 'many', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'humor', 'director', 'coaxes', 'what', 'many', 'included', 'were', 'reluctantly', 'ready', 'go', 'along', 'However', 'when', 'further', 'was', 'left', 'disappointed', 'Too', 'bad', 'becaue', 'liked', 'inanity', 'situation', 'was', 'initially', 'presented', 'lot', 'unique', 'humor', 'able', 'happen', 'movie', 'lot', 'talent', 'involved', 'making', 'happen', 'have', 'come', 'accept', 'many', 'European', 'movies', 'have', 'relaxed', 'standards', 'compared', 'American', 'Cinema', 'Usually', 'have', 'wait', 'kids', 'go', 'bed', 'watch', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'standard', 'PG-13', 'film', 'However', 'are', 'still', 'taboos', 'society', 'film', 'Murmers', 'Heart', 'might', 'dare', 'examine', 'film', 'Get', 'Hankerchiefs', 'ignore', 'and/or', 'make', 'light', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'like', 'fancy', 'enlightened', 'prude', 'latter', 'portion', 'Get', 'Out', 'Hankerchiefs', 'reminded', 'must', 'be', 'prude', 'first', 'enlightened', 'second', 'guess', 'cling', 'idea', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'better', 'ways', 'create', 'great', 'movie', 'stooping', 'level', 'fairness', 'should', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'Star', 'rating', 'took', 'one', 'away', 'propriety', 'sake']",Get Out Your Handkerchiefs
