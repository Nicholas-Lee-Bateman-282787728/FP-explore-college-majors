I watched it again tonight, it wasn't horrible, just not very good.  I seen worse from major studios.  Next to Showgirls, this movie is Oscar material (yeah, that's a backhanded compliment).  Really, there were times that the acting of the two main characters was so wooden, you could carve a toy gun.  They, would follow it up in the next scene, that made me scratch my head - the acting would be quite good.  Go figure...  I will say that some of the sex scenes were just dead on hot ... and the build-up of the tension, just dead bang on the mark.Where it was the worse was those neverending shots of the characters doing the pensive stare out the window - way to long.The bonus disk was great.  I watched it first this time and that made me go back to watch the movie again.  There was stuff in the bonus disk that didn't make it to the movie, too bad.  Some of it was damn good.  It also helped to explain the movie a little better, sudden cast changes explain that sometimes bad acting.

187002,A3QC4SG7NA4ULG,1572523018,A reader,"[17, 23]","My girlfriend and I gasped and groaned from start to finish as we watched Claire of the Moon.  We simply could not believe how lousy it was.  I wish I could say it was so bad it was good, but alas, it was just plain lousy.  From the stiff acting, to the pedantic dialog, to the stereotypical characters, to the predictable, contrived plot set-ups -- it was just ALL BAD.  Well, okay, the music was good, and there was a five minute sex scene with nudity at the end that had some merit, but take my advice and don't waste your time on the movie.  Just fast-forward to the sex and then turn it off!If you're a woman who is just coming out or thinking about coming out, maybe you'd be titillated by the cat and mouse game played by the two completely mismatched leading characters.  But anyone who's been out for more than five minutes would have to be extremely isolated to take this movie seriously.I also must mention that everybody in this film, especially the leading ladies, drinks alcohol from morning to night.  I like a drink every now and then myself, but the degree of alcohol consumption here was over the top.  The message seemed clear:  these women were unable to interact with one another unless they were drunk.

Matthews,"[6, 9]","When I started watching this unoriginal and monotonous movie, I thought it would show that scene almost every unoriginal and monotonous Nineties movie has: the cast dancing to some overplayed Sixties oldie.  I was wrong.  THIS movie showed its characters dancing to a blaring, generic, keyboard-heavy, Eighties-style rock anthem.The above scene epitomizes how badly this movie has aged since 1992.  I can understand how the filmmakers would want to counteract the era's cinematic Sapphic stereotypes; at least the movie contains no lesbian killers, or no silicone-enhanced lesbian sexbombs who get it on to arouse straight male viewers.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers instead offer equal parts pseudo-intellectualism (stilted Mars/Venus-style conversations about sexual roles) and watered-down cool (embarrassing MTV-style sexual fantasies).  This ""unrated"" movie even waters down its sex scenes, going to comical lengths to conceal crotches and buttocks, apparently to avoid controversy and guarantee a mainstream audience.

It's comforting to see one's self reflected off of a movie or television screen. Unfortunantly, when there are few to chose from, anything is good. That is the biggest problem when it comes to gay films: people will take just about anything, no matter how good or bad it is.CLAIR is low budget, first and foremost, and everything pretty much reflects that. However, the real problem with this film is the excess of stereotype, and the way dramatic moments are made overly dramatic right up to unbelievable by cliched dialog and lengthy pauses. This is a talky film, full of dialog that is not really neccessary to the advancement of the story. Once you've seen it, this becomes rather tiresome.Also, some films just don't age well, and this is one of them. The themes still hold, but for whatever reason the film itself hasn't.

187010,A28GCEHD00JFZG,1572523018,Julian Kennedy,"[2, 4]","Claire of the Moon: 2 out of 10: This is why women's studies majors shouldn't be allowed to write and direct films. Of course woman's studies does not actually study all woman as woman have opinions and accomplishments as varied as men. Woman's studies courses as pointed out by Professors Dapne Patai and Noretta Koertgein `Professing Feminism: Cautionary Tales from the Strange World of Women's Studies' are more interested in ""the political mission of training feminist cadres to override educational concerns. The strategies of faculty members in these programs have included policing insensitive language, championing research methods deemed congenial to women (such as qualitative over quantitative methods), and conducting classes as if they were therapy sessions.""Woman's studies is an exercise in a particular group-think that attacks freedom as a whole and the freedom of woman in particular. Claire of the Moon is full of long anti-woman diatribes basically claiming straight woman are undermining the feminist movement (this is assuming there are any straight feminists left mind you). The movie was directed by a woman, so of course so this anti-woman point of view is okay. This is the Precious rule where as long as you are a member of a group you can make a film that drags out every horrible stereotype about said group and will be praised for it. Now had the exact same film had been written and directed by a straight white male, people would have burned the theater down.This politically correct nonsense really should not effect the enjoyment of a film as one can be pro nuclear power and still enjoy Godzilla as an example. Claire of the Moon however has much bigger problems than its absolutist point of view.Claire of the Moon's plot consists of two woman who become roommates at an all woman writer's retreat (one would think a writer's retreat would have individual rooms. This however is never examined.) Our titular protagonist Claire Jabrowski (Trisha Todd) is a drunk woman (Think Sherrybaby) who is sloppy, sleeps with creepy men at the drop of a hat and passes for a writer in the way that Tara Reid is convincing as a brainy anthropologist in Alone in the Dark. Playing Felix to Todd's Oscar is Karen Trumbo who plays a successful lesbian writer who is very butch and a neat freak. They hate each other on sight so it's going to be a long tedious ride before the inevitable hook-up sex.Claire of The Moon tells this story in the form of three films mashed together: A haranguing lecture, A romantic novel and a soft core porn film.The haranguing lecture is easily the worst part. The actresses are all amateur and read their overwrought screeds with a talent that varies from awful, to god awful, to good God make it stop I will join your cult and renounce my evil heterosexual ways awful. The romance novel bits consist of endless shots of sunsets and driftwood on various Oregon beaches while a piano tinkers in the background. You remember how seemingly every movie in the early seventies would stop the story outright and go all soft focus while a folk song played in your ears? Claire of the Moon is kind of like that but without the warbling.The soft-core sex is what hopefully attracts both enlightened females and straight males to the movie. (I say hopefully because if you came for the acting or the story you are in for a world of hurt.) Our hook up sex partners (sorry romantic leads) are as stated above Trisha Todd who never made a another movie, teaches drama at Grant High in Portland, looks a little like Laura Dern, she is easily the best actress of the bunch, and whose nudity is the sole reason the film wasn't rated one out of 10. The other main lead Karen Trumbo has found some roles since Claire, she looks a little like Sigourney Weaver if Sigourney had a breast reduction and a little boy's haircut, and she convincingly plays a butch lesbian.The sex scene comes in the last ten minutes of the film and it is decent as these things go (though it certainly not worth watching the rest of the film for). It also has the great advantage however of having no dialogue, and is more enjoyable if you don't know the characters. In other words this is the reason God created the fast forward button.",1,The Hook Up Generation,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,4249,"['Claire', 'Moon', '2', '10', 'why', 'women', 'studies', 'majors', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'allowed', 'write', 'direct', 'films', 'course', 'woman', 'studies', 'not', 'actually', 'study', 'woman', 'woman', 'have', 'opinions', 'accomplishments', 'as', 'varied', 'men', 'Woman', 'studies', 'as', 'pointed', 'out', 'Professors', 'Dapne', 'Patai', 'Noretta', 'Koertgein', 'Professing', 'Feminism', 'Cautionary', 'Tales', 'Strange', 'World', 'Women', 'Studies', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'political', 'mission', 'training', 'feminist', 'cadres', 'override', 'educational', 'concerns', 'strategies', 'faculty', 'members', 'programs', 'have', 'included', 'policing', 'insensitive', 'language', 'championing', 'research', 'methods', 'deemed', 'congenial', 'women', 'such', 'qualitative', 'quantitative', 'methods', 'conducting', 'classes', 'were', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'Woman', 'studies', 'exercise', 'particular', 'group-think', 'freedom', 'whole', 'freedom', 'woman', 'particular', 'Claire', 'Moon', 'full', 'long', 'anti-woman', 'diatribes', 'basically', 'claiming', 'straight', 'woman', 'are', 'undermining', 'feminist', 'movement', 'assuming', 'are', 'straight', 'feminists', 'left', 'mind', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'woman', 'course', 'anti-woman', 'point', 'view', 'okay', 'Precious', 'rule', 'where', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'member', 'group', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'out', 'horrible', 'stereotype', 'said', 'group', 'will', 'be', 'praised', 'Now', 'had', 'exact', 'same', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'directed', 'straight', 'white', 'male', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'burned', 'theater', 'down.This', 'politically', 'correct', 'nonsense', 'really', 'should', 'not', 'effect', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'pro', 'nuclear', 'power', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Godzilla', 'example', 'Claire', 'Moon', 'however', 'much', 'bigger', 'problems', 'absolutist', 'point', 'view.Claire', 'Moon', 'plot', 'two', 'woman', 'who', 'become', 'roommates', 'woman', 'writer', 'retreat', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'writer', 'retreat', 'would', 'have', 'individual', 'rooms', 'however', 'never', 'examined', 'titular', 'protagonist', 'Claire', 'Jabrowski', 'Trisha', 'Todd', 'drunk', 'woman', 'Think', 'Sherrybaby', 'who', 'sloppy', 'sleeps', 'creepy', 'men', 'drop', 'hat', 'passes', 'writer', 'way', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'convincing', 'brainy', 'anthropologist', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'Playing', 'Felix', 'Todd', 'Oscar', 'Karen', 'Trumbo', 'who', 'successful', 'lesbian', 'writer', 'who', 'very', 'butch', 'neat', 'freak', 'hate', 'other', 'sight', 'going', 'be', 'long', 'tedious', 'ride', 'inevitable', 'hook-up', 'sex.Claire', 'Moon', 'story', 'form', 'three', 'films', 'mashed', 'together', 'haranguing', 'lecture', 'A', 'romantic', 'novel', 'soft', 'core', 'porn', 'film.The', 'haranguing', 'lecture', 'easily', 'worst', 'part', 'actresses', 'are', 'amateur', 'read', 'overwrought', 'screeds', 'talent', 'awful', 'god', 'awful', 'good', 'God', 'make', 'stop', 'will', 'join', 'cult', 'renounce', 'evil', 'heterosexual', 'ways', 'awful', 'romance', 'novel', 'bits', 'consist', 'endless', 'shots', 'sunsets', 'driftwood', 'various', 'Oregon', 'beaches', 'piano', 'tinkers', 'background', 'remember', 'how', 'seemingly', 'movie', 'early', 'seventies', 'would', 'stop', 'story', 'outright', 'go', 'soft', 'focus', 'folk', 'song', 'played', 'ears', 'Claire', 'Moon', 'kind', 'warbling.The', 'soft-core', 'sex', 'what', 'hopefully', 'enlightened', 'females', 'straight', 'males', 'movie', 'say', 'hopefully', 'came', 'acting', 'story', 'are', 'world', 'hurt', 'hook', 'up', 'sex', 'partners', 'sorry', 'romantic', 'leads', 'are', 'stated', 'Trisha', 'Todd', 'who', 'never', 'made', 'movie', 'teaches', 'drama', 'Grant', 'High', 'Portland', 'little', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'easily', 'best', 'actress', 'bunch', 'nudity', 'sole', 'reason', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'rated', 'one', '10', 'other', 'main', 'lead', 'Karen', 'Trumbo', 'found', 'roles', 'Claire', 'little', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Sigourney', 'had', 'breast', 'reduction', 'little', 'boy', 'haircut', 'convincingly', 'butch', 'lesbian.The', 'sex', 'scene', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'decent', 'things', 'go', 'certainly', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'rest', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'advantage', 'however', 'having', 'dialogue', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'characters', 'other', 'words', 'reason', 'God', 'created', 'fast', 'forward', 'button']",Claire of the Moon

The acting is atrocious.  The writing is abysmal.  Clearly, Conn and the actress playing Tara O'Hara have never actually met someone from the American South much less from Atlanta.  The word ""y'all"" is a contraction of the phrase ""you all.""  It is a plural pronoun.  It is not used in the singular.  Moreover, those of us who are from Atlanta have gentle Southern accents, if any at all.I'm mentioning the Southern stereotype in the film, because that's the one that offended me the most, but EVERY character was a stereotype--the New Age guru, the pop psychologist, the housewife-turned-writer, the butch lezzie, etc.  Ugh!  And the tripe that comes out of their mouths!There's so much back-and-forth between the two main characters that by the end of the movie when they finally hook up (and we still don't know why that time was THE time they finally gave in) the viewer doesn't care.  I really, really would love for Conn to take a couple of writing courses or just read a book about developing plot and characters.  In film, especially, every scene must count and be building toward the big payoff.  Too many scenes in this movie had no real purpose or served the same purpose as an earlier scene.  The characters must be fresh and real, not like the trite, wooden women who people this movie.  For a look at movies with great writing and acting, check out Imagine Me and You and Fingersmith.  The latter is based on the excellent novel by Sarah Waters, and the screen writer did a spectacular job dramatizing the book.",1,Lousy Writing and Acting,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,1645,"['movie', 'truly', 'one', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'better', 'Conn', 'other', 'movie', 'Cynara', 'digress', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'writing', 'abysmal', 'Clearly', 'Conn', 'actress', 'playing', 'Tara', ""O'Hara"", 'have', 'never', 'actually', 'met', 'someone', 'American', 'South', 'much', 'less', 'Atlanta', 'word', ""y'all"", 'contraction', 'phrase', 'plural', 'pronoun', 'not', 'used', 'singular', 'Moreover', 'who', 'are', 'Atlanta', 'have', 'gentle', 'Southern', 'accents', 'all.I', ""'m"", 'mentioning', 'Southern', 'stereotype', 'film', 'one', 'offended', 'most', 'EVERY', 'character', 'was', 'stereotype', 'New', 'Age', 'guru', 'pop', 'psychologist', 'housewife-turned-writer', 'butch', 'lezzie', 'etc', 'Ugh', 'tripe', 'mouths', 'so', 'much', 'back-and-forth', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'finally', 'hook', 'up', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'time', 'was', 'time', 'finally', 'gave', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'care', 'really', 'really', 'would', 'love', 'Conn', 'take', 'couple', 'writing', 'courses', 'just', 'read', 'book', 'developing', 'plot', 'characters', 'film', 'especially', 'scene', 'must', 'count', 'be', 'building', 'big', 'payoff', 'Too', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'had', 'real', 'purpose', 'served', 'same', 'purpose', 'earlier', 'scene', 'characters', 'must', 'be', 'fresh', 'real', 'not', 'trite', 'wooden', 'women', 'who', 'people', 'movie', 'look', 'movies', 'great', 'writing', 'acting', 'check', 'out', 'Imagine', 'Me', 'Fingersmith', 'latter', 'based', 'excellent', 'novel', 'Sarah', 'Waters', 'screen', 'writer', 'did', 'spectacular', 'job', 'dramatizing', 'book']",Claire of the Moon
