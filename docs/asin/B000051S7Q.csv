And while the direction is uninspired (and at times downright sluggish), Phoenix is as usual engaging.

Based on the novel by Bill Richert ""Aren't you even going to kiss me goodbye"" Phoenix plays Jimmy a smooth talking charming  kid from a working class family who lives in the richer side of town. Hangs with these rich kids who are the type to die if they ever lost their money. While trying to impress and win the heart of the one girl who ever really got to him his girlfriend Lisa ( Meredith Salenger) before she moves to Hawaii. He gets himself into hard situations and troubles just about every relationship he has by sleeping with his best friends ( Mathew Perry) girlfriend,  has sex with his mothers best friend. Then smashes his fathers  car up in the course of one night. River's character in this film is the type that has a charisma that makes it hard for people to say no to or stay mad at. A funny teen angst movie excellent performance by River Phoenix they couldn't of casted anyone else for this role.
