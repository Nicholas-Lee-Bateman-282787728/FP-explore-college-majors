Rani Mukerji was great in it, the music was pretty good and Sonu Nigam's voice is my life, but someone should have saved me from buying this DVD. I can take (even non-movie related) commercials and trailers before I get to the menu screen... I can even -maybe- accept the commercial (related to SRK) once I hit the play button, but I can't for the life of me accept to see commercials during the movie when I'm playing it on any disc.I'm halfway through the movie and commercials (3 product ones) have played twice already- the first time before Dheere Jalna begins, and the other right after Kangna Re ends.

925761,AJ83VFEY0MYLM,B000AC538M,"Ashley L. Oldaker ""SRK all the way""","[0, 0]","This movie is perfect in every respect. I don't understand how this film was a flop in India, but they seem to understand the power and limitlessness of love better than anyone in Hollywood. This film is like a folk tale but it has an ageless quality to it that most folk tales don't have. It feels like it could be happening right now and it feels very truthful and relevant to everyone because everyone dreams of being loved like this. When I first saw Shah Rukh Khan's character Kishan, I was disappointed. I tend to expect Shah Rukh to be immediately magical and romantic but his character is a cowardly, shallow little man that is completely under his father's thumb (he seems to be afraid of his father). And his mustache and bad hat don't help matters. He can flippantly say to his sobbing new bride that he'll only be gone for five years, leaving her alone in a strange house with his family whom she doesn't yet know. He is obsessed with counting every penny he just spent on their wedding and he barely looks at his gorgeous new bride (Rani Mukherji) who is so sweet and so hopeful. You're pretty much hoping Kishan will meet some rabid camels on his travels to make more money. Then Shah Rukh appears as a ghost in the guise of Kishan and you sigh with relief. Although Rani's character Lachchi mistakes him for her husband, only kinder, the ghost lets her know he is a ghost and lets her decide to let him in her life or not. I like how they imply that a ghost is a better man than a man. That a ghost tells the truth when a man would lie and a ghost freely speaks his love and shows appreciation for his wife when a man doesn't feel it to be necessary. I love the spirit puppets that are like the ghost's conscience. This is the most romantic movie I've ever seen and it's so sweet and enchanting and soul-bending. There's not even any kissing, just nuzzling and caressing, and yet it is so passionate you feel like you should look away and yet you can't. It's very nice to see Juhi Chawla and Shah Rukh in a movie together again. Everyone in this movie does such a flawless job. Shah Rukh is tender and real and stunning, Rani is the definition of grace and beauty. This movie is three hours long, as all Bollywood movies are, but it passes so quickly, too quickly. I've watched this twice in a day many times. The soundtrack is epic and sweeping and has the full range of hopeful songs, sad songs, and celebratory songs. The first time I watched the movie, the minute the movie ended I was on the computer ordering the soundtrack. One of the best movies ever made, one of the best soundtracks ever made, breathtaking spiritual love story, gorgeous people, remarkable scenery.

925762,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,B000AC538M,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[28, 28]","Of all the Hindi (""Bollywood"") films I have seen in the past year or so, ""Paheli"" stands out as very special in many ways, and together with its presentation in a gorgeous box I think this DVD even deserves a 6-star rating.  Some of this film's outstanding features which impressed me the most are first of all the absolutely stunning feast of colours, beautiful and amazing sets and overall superb photography, all filmed in India's most fascinating region, Rajasthan.  Having toured Rajasthan over 10 years ago, this aspect had special significance for me, but I'm sure every viewer would be amazed by the breathtaking beauty of the traditional buildings and costumes in particular.  Some other Indian and Rajasthan traditions are also incorporated in this delightful fantasy story based on Rajasthan folklore, giving the viewer a delicious taste of India which is not often seen in most popular Bollywood movies.  In fact, anyone used to the popular run-of-the-mill Bollywood output might be very surprised by ""Paheli"" due to its `traditional purity'; its focus solely on a Rajasthan folktale set somewhere in the past using pure Hindi language (ie, no English words frequently thrown in) and shot on location in Rajasthan, India.  Nevertheless, ""Paheli"" still has all the typical Bollywood ingredients such as a song and dance every 20 minutes or so, a sentimental love story and a star-studded cast.  The music, like the story and scenes, are also purely Indian and are played on traditional instruments, which was also a highlight for me personally.For those in the know, ""Paheli"" boasts some of India's top stars, all of whom give some of their best performances in this film.  Often referred to as `the King of Bollywood', Shahrukh Khan excels himself in this dual role as the leading man and his double: a ghost who impersonates him.  (Impressive special effects also rate highly in this film such as the ghost's `tricks' and scenes in which man and ghost interact with each other)  His leading lady (once again) is Rani Mukherjee, one of the many stunningly beautiful Indian actresses who have talent and skills as well as beauty.  And I always enjoy the great Amitabh Bachchan, this time in only a small but pivotal role as an old desert shepherd who solves the riddle ('Paheli' means riddle) of which of the two identical men is the man and which one the ghost.  It's always a treat for me to see Anupam Kher in one of his good character roles, this time as Shahrukh's greedy businessman father, and the lovely Juhi Chawla also offers a small supporting role.  For dazzling Bollywood stars, ""Paheli"" is sure to please, and for the complete novice to Indian cinema this film's many other superior features are sure to surprise and impress.  And for a little extra depth and behind-the-scenes insight, this DVD has among its bonus features a 30-minute ""The Making of..."" documentary which sheds some light onto the stars' own views on the value and message of the film for today's audience.  My only complaint (though a very small one) is that some of this documentary's dialogue is in Hindi without any subtitles, but for the most part it is informative and enjoyable, and helps the viewer to appreciate ""Paheli"" even more.  Another enjoyable bonus feature on the DVD is a CD launch with interviews with the stars.

On their wedding night Kishanial informs his new wife that he will forego the sexual pleasures of their first embrace in order to prepare for a business trip in the morning, a journey that will last five long years. The joys of marital bliss seem to be unattainable for the lovely bride until Kishanial unexpectedly returns home three days later.

Suffice it to say that, as in many Shah Rukh Khan films, there is an underlying message in the plot, which is that spirit animates beauty and that we are more than the sum of our bodies.SRK is well known as the King of Bollywood, but this does not begin to capture the ability of this actor to go beyond acting and to actually become the charcater he is playing.  In this film, he plays the role of the husband and the role of a ghost posing as the husband in the husband's body.  There are no artificial props indicating a switch in charcaters, but you can tell who is the husband and who the ghost because Khan's face literally changes.  So, to call Khan the King of Bollywood is to demean the standing of a very fine actor, a world-class actor, whose presence would grace any screen and production--be it Indian, British, or American.  In fact, it is my belief that American producers will soon come to recognize this man's talent and worldwide appeal and will begin to offer him substantial roles.The other great feature of this film is Rani Mukherji as the wife.  She is also a very fine dramatic actress, quite equal to the task of playing opposite Khan.  There are several scenes in which she dances in a traditional Indian style and she floats above ground as a flash of fluid color.  Beautiful.This has not been one of Khan's more commercial films and it did not do terribly well in India.

Those of you who are longtime Bollywood fans, please don't miss it on this gem!  ""Paheli"" is based on the ancient tale of ghosts, mistaken identity and the pursuit of true love and how far it takes two lovers.Lachchi (Rani Mukherjee) is a beautiful young woman, who is married to Kishan (Shah Rukh Khan), a man only interested in tabulating the costs of his wedding, on the night the young couple should be honeymooning (!).  When Kishan must travel far away, on account of business, his young wife is left alone (supposedly to wait for him, for five years time).  Fate has other plans in mind, however.  A spirit, who first took the form of a bird and then a squirrel, sees the beautiful young woman and ultimately falls in love with her, upon first glance.  He takes the form of her husband, and proceeds to woo her and charm the rest of the village.  Of course, when the time comes that her TRUE husband returns, complications arise and only time (and a few tests) will tell what becomes of Lachchmi and her spirit lover.This classic story of love and magical realism is beautifully told, through elaborate costume, lusciously choreographed dance numbers and glowingly believeable and engaging acting.  Shah Rukh Khan (Lachchi/spirit) is something of a legend in the Bollywood film industry, and he is at his smouldering best here.

It is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, and, like the rest of the film, tells us to enjoy life as we get it. Ironically, it is a ghost (Sharukh Khan) who must show us how much life is worthwhile.The plot for this wonderful Indian movie is inspired on an old folk tale, a love story that tells the dilemma faced by Lachcho when an incarnated ghost takes the place of her absent husband. The husband (played by Sharukh Khan, too) has never really been anything but cold towards her, giving more importance to material gains than to his new relationship, and not caring for his new wife's feelings to the point of abandoning her in pursuit of riches after the wedding night. In steps the ghost, who fell in love with the young bride after just a glimpse of her while she was travelling to her new home. The ghost is grateful for this opportunity of tasting life in the place of Lachcho's reluctant husband, but immediately decides against doing this at the cost of Lachcho's feelings or dignity: he tells her from the beginning that he is not her husband, declares his love and lets her decide what she wants to do.This opportunity to decide is a deeply moving moment for Lachcho, who has never in her life been asked her opinion, not even about her own life. And this dilemma provides the vehicle for one of the movie's most important themes: the dignity that comes with making our own decissions and taking responsibility for our lives; a dignity that, unfortunately, is denied to many women.How like Bollywood to make a film that can be ""read"" at several levels, where there is all the glamorous entertainment typical of Indian films -music,songs, gorgeous clothes, bright colours...- and ethical themes that provide food for thought. And it really is like that: Sharukh Khan is his old charming and adorable self (and getting better and better at acting; I hope he NEVER retires !!!), Rani Mukherji has just the right chemistry for him, none eclipsing the other (although she's strikingly beautiful and quite a good actress), the music and songs have to be some of THE BEST I've ever heard in my life, the local setting in Rajastan is so intriguing that it takes an effort not to beging packing your bags to go there immediately.And all in all, the ""paheli"" or dilemma/riddle for me is....how can you pretend to have any kind of relationship with someone if you don't give him/her the oportunity to choose? The answer is that this is, of course, impossible: there is no love without freedom of choice.",5,"Life, burn slowly",1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,2625,"['Life', 'burn', 'slowly', '-Dharelee', 'jeli', 'Hindi-', 'title', 'one', 'songs', 'Indian', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'rest', 'film', 'enjoy', 'life', 'get', 'Ironically', 'ghost', 'Sharukh', 'Khan', 'who', 'must', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'life', 'worthwhile.The', 'plot', 'wonderful', 'Indian', 'movie', 'inspired', 'old', 'folk', 'tale', 'love', 'story', 'dilemma', 'faced', 'Lachcho', 'when', 'incarnated', 'ghost', 'place', 'absent', 'husband', 'husband', 'played', 'Sharukh', 'Khan', 'too', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'anything', 'cold', 'towards', 'giving', 'more', 'importance', 'material', 'gains', 'new', 'relationship', 'not', 'caring', 'new', 'wife', 'feelings', 'point', 'abandoning', 'pursuit', 'riches', 'wedding', 'night', 'steps', 'ghost', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'young', 'bride', 'just', 'glimpse', 'was', 'travelling', 'new', 'home', 'ghost', 'grateful', 'opportunity', 'tasting', 'life', 'place', 'Lachcho', 'reluctant', 'husband', 'immediately', 'doing', 'cost', 'Lachcho', 'feelings', 'dignity', 'beginning', 'not', 'husband', 'love', 'decide', 'what', 'do.This', 'opportunity', 'decide', 'deeply', 'moving', 'moment', 'Lachcho', 'who', 'never', 'life', 'been', 'asked', 'opinion', 'not', 'even', 'own', 'life', 'dilemma', 'vehicle', 'one', 'movie', 'most', 'important', 'themes', 'dignity', 'making', 'own', 'decissions', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'lives', 'dignity', 'unfortunately', 'denied', 'many', 'women.How', 'Bollywood', 'make', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'several', 'levels', 'where', 'glamorous', 'entertainment', 'typical', 'Indian', 'films', '-music', 'songs', 'gorgeous', 'clothes', 'bright', 'colours', 'ethical', 'themes', 'provide', 'food', 'thought', 'really', 'Sharukh', 'Khan', 'old', 'charming', 'adorable', 'self', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'acting', 'hope', 'NEVER', 'Rani', 'Mukherji', 'just', 'right', 'chemistry', 'none', 'eclipsing', 'other', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'quite', 'good', 'actress', 'music', 'songs', 'have', 'be', 'THE', 'BEST', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'life', 'local', 'setting', 'Rajastan', 'so', 'intriguing', 'effort', 'not', 'beging', 'packing', 'bags', 'go', 'there', 'immediately.And', 'paheli', 'dilemma/riddle', '.how', 'can', 'pretend', 'have', 'kind', 'relationship', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'him/her', 'oportunity', 'choose', 'answer', 'course', 'impossible', 'love', 'freedom', 'choice']",N/A
925771,A3GPL5JEP3G1VS,B000AC538M,Hmph,"[1, 2]","My main complaint about the film is that it was just too long. The story takes place during a 5-year period, and sometimes it feels like the movie will END in 5 years! Well, it's really 2 hours and 20 minutes. The movie is about a spirit who takes the form of a newly wed woman's husband for 4-5 years, while the real husband is away on a business trip and neglecting his wife. Clearly, the spirit and the wife bond in that time period, but this becomes too drawn out in the movie. I left the TV with the film on for almost an hour, and when I came back, the story hadn't progressed that much further. The producers should have shortened the middle part of the movie. Also, since it's a 2005 film, and there have been so many movies produced inside and outside of Bollywood with an actor playing a dual role by this time, the doppelganger scenes are not that impressive, either.Otherwise, it was an okay movie. I must admit the costume and set design was gorgeous. In fact, the movie won an award for best art direction. Do an image search for ""Paheli"" and see for yourself.The lessons in the movie were pretty good too. The wife learns early on that the man who is living with her is not her real husband. Faced with a difficult situation, she must decide if she should remain faithful to her true husband, or love a spirit who is more affectionate towards her than her husband will ever be.

The sandswept beauty, the rich culture--it's like nowhere else. The colors there alone seem too vibrant to be real. And it stands to reason that fairy-tale lands would produce wonderful fairy tales. 'Paheli' is a delightful story from Rajasthani folklore about a neglected wife who finds the man of her dreams in the form of an amorous ghost.Lachchi (Rani Mukerji) is married to a man she doesn't know and sent away from her home and family to live in his village. She's sad to leave, but excited about her new life as the wife of a wealthy merchant. To her great disappointment, her husband, Kishan (Shahrukh Khan), turns out to be a plodding bore who's only interested in running the family business. He finds his vivacious, sensual bride distasteful and refuses to bed her on their wedding night, despite her prodding. The very next morning, he sets off to start a business venture in a faraway city, where he plans to stay for five years, leaving his distraught wife behind. There's a history of abandonment in Kishan's family--his older brother (Suniel Shetty) did the same thing to his wife (Juhi Chawla). A ghost (also played by Khan) falls in love with Lachchi and assumes a human form that looks just like Kishan, and he shows up at the family mansion, pretending to be the runaway groom.It's an interesting double role for Khan, and he has fun with the characters--the ghost, in particular, who relishes every aspect of life as a human--the splash of water in the bath, a mother's tender touch on his cheek, and especially the love of the irresistible Lachchi. The ghost doesn't lie to her about who he is, and while she's torn about being unfaithful to her husband, she gives in to the attentive and passionate ghost because he's everything she wants. Everyone else believes he's Kishan, and maintaining the charade, as evidence to the contrary mounts, is the source of conflict, culminating in Kishan's inevitable return. By that time, we learn that Kishan isn't such a bad guy--just desperate to please his father (Aunupam Kher) with profits--and he starts to long for Lachchi during his exile. He has a right to be upset because he is, after all, being cuckolded by someone who stole his identity. Why the filmmakers cultivate this sympathy for Kishan, when the ghost is the hero of the story, is confusing.A no-nonsense shepherd (Amitabh Bachchan) offers a solution to the dilemma, and it's resolved--as is often the case in fairy tales--all too conveniently.- The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",3,Worth Watching,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,2673,"['are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'places', 'world', 'more', 'fantastic', 'truest', 'sense', 'word', 'Rajasthan', 'sandswept', 'beauty', 'rich', 'culture', 'nowhere', 'else', 'colors', 'there', 'alone', 'seem', 'too', 'vibrant', 'be', 'real', 'reason', 'fairy-tale', 'lands', 'would', 'produce', 'wonderful', 'fairy', 'tales', 'delightful', 'story', 'Rajasthani', 'folklore', 'neglected', 'wife', 'who', 'man', 'dreams', 'form', 'amorous', 'ghost.Lachchi', 'Rani', 'Mukerji', 'married', 'man', ""n't"", 'know', 'sent', 'away', 'home', 'family', 'live', 'village', 'sad', 'leave', 'excited', 'new', 'life', 'wife', 'wealthy', 'merchant', 'great', 'disappointment', 'husband', 'Kishan', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'out', 'be', 'plodding', 'bore', 'who', 'only', 'interested', 'running', 'family', 'business', 'vivacious', 'sensual', 'bride', 'distasteful', 'bed', 'wedding', 'night', 'prodding', 'very', 'next', 'morning', 'start', 'business', 'venture', 'faraway', 'city', 'where', 'stay', 'five', 'years', 'leaving', 'distraught', 'wife', 'history', 'abandonment', 'Kishan', 'family', 'older', 'brother', 'Suniel', 'Shetty', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'wife', 'Juhi', 'Chawla', 'ghost', 'also', 'played', 'Khan', 'love', 'Lachchi', 'human', 'form', 'just', 'like', 'Kishan', 'up', 'family', 'mansion', 'pretending', 'be', 'runaway', 'groom.It', 'interesting', 'double', 'role', 'Khan', 'fun', 'characters', 'ghost', 'particular', 'who', 'aspect', 'life', 'human', 'splash', 'water', 'bath', 'mother', 'tender', 'touch', 'cheek', 'especially', 'love', 'irresistible', 'Lachchi', 'ghost', ""n't"", 'lie', 'about', 'who', 'torn', 'being', 'unfaithful', 'husband', 'attentive', 'passionate', 'ghost', 'everything', 'Everyone', 'else', 'Kishan', 'maintaining', 'charade', 'evidence', 'contrary', 'mounts', 'source', 'conflict', 'culminating', 'Kishan', 'inevitable', 'return', 'time', 'learn', 'Kishan', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'desperate', 'please', 'father', 'Aunupam', 'Kher', 'profits', 'long', 'Lachchi', 'exile', 'right', 'be', 'upset', 'being', 'cuckolded', 'someone', 'who', 'stole', 'identity', 'Why', 'filmmakers', 'cultivate', 'sympathy', 'Kishan', 'when', 'ghost', 'hero', 'story', 'confusing.A', 'no-nonsense', 'shepherd', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'solution', 'dilemma', 'resolved', 'often', 'case', 'fairy', 'tales', 'too', 'conveniently.-', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",N/A

Needless to say, the best part of the movie is the visuals.. oh my Gosh!!!! this is a gorgeous movie, with gorgeous people dresses gorgeously in gorgeous places. Plus, Rani did a good job even though I don't find her to be a good dancer. Amitabh was superb!! The king of the Indian royal family does perform very impressively.

The costumes and music was awesome. This is a movie worth buying. I recommend it to anyone. my niece didn't like Shah Rukh mustache in the film. Said she could not take him seriously with that mustache. lol. I heard He himself didn't like wearing it either.,4,"Fun, delightful, entertaining movie",1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,366,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'beautifully', 'made', 'film', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Rani', 'have', 'alot', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'costumes', 'music', 'was', 'awesome', 'movie', 'worth', 'buying', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'niece', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'mustache', 'film', 'Said', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'mustache', 'lol', 'heard', 'did', ""n't"", 'wearing']",N/A

He's just great in Rab Ne Bana De Jodi, but even more the loving, adoring looks fella in this one. Definitely one to have for your Bollywood collection. Rani is great, as always.
