However, as my title suggests bits and pieces of the whole to not add up to great entertainment. I must also remark, I do own two volumes of theDoctor Who: The Lost TV Episodes: Volume Three: 1966-1967 (BBC Audio)and volume four. So I do lover classic 1960's Dr Who...and one of my favorite episodes isThe Three Doctors: Part 1This collection is for those over the top fans of classic Who that want anything they can get. To no fault to the person who gave me this wonderful holiday gift, I rather have full episodes either of videos the Doctor or audio versions of Dr Who stories in any of his incarnations.I know one of the recent Patrick Troughton DVD  videos has animation of the  Who episode  with the original soundtrack to complete the episode.  One would hope they do that with the video ofDoctor Who: Ep. 109 - Shadaand Tom Baker would fill in the gaps with his wonderful vocal talents or Paul McGann who did the audio version of  (Doctor Who: Shadafor Big Finish audioOn the whole if you are a collector of Who audio and videos, this project is a goldmine.

842661,AIXHGNP13HPXJ,B0002OXVF0,"B. Jones ""movie nut""","[8, 8]","It should be known that this set is really only for fans of doctor who.  There are many lost episodes from the early years, during the tenure of the first two doctors.  This set includes all the surviving episodes, along with surviving clips, but there are not any complete stories here.  There are some that have a beginning with no ending, others with a middle and but no beginning or ending, some with a middle and a ending but no beginning.  There is nothing here that is complete.But if you are a big fan of doctor who (like I am) then you will probably like this set anyhow because it does allow you to see at least a small part of these classic stories.  Besides, if you're very worried about not being able to enjoy the entire story thanks to the missing episodes, there are things you can do.1. Go to the Loose Cannon website.  They create reconstructions of the lost episodes using the surviving audio (which exists for all the stories) and mixes it with still shots that survive from the episodes.  What you get is basically a slid show with the original audio playing over it.  Recently they have even started to include CGI animation to make the reconstructions more enjoyable.  They distribute the recons for free, but only on VHS due to copyright issues.  You need the Lost in Time set to go along with some of the reconstructions as they don't include the surviving episodes on the tapes.2. Another solution is to purchase the CDs created by the BBC that use the surviving audio, along with linking narration to let the listener know what is happening during sections that aren't apparent in the audio track.3. The last option you have is to go to the BBC website and check out the photonovels they have there, which are basically just surviving still shots with a short synopsis of what occurs in each of the episodes.So there are ways the serious Doctor Who fan can enjoy these classic stories.

I bought it as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law, and we watched the shows on video from the first DVD as a family.First, I thought the video was of surprising good quality for TV shows of that age where the preservation of the video has not been a priority. Interestingly, there are some shows for which the video does not survive, and they have included the audio only. You are not really seeing complete stories here from episodes that tied together to make an entire story arc, because in most cases not enough episodes have been recovered to provide the complete story arc. But they have provided what they could find.For that reason this product is more to satisfy the curiosity of what early Dr. Who shows were like, and it does a fine job of that. My daughter-in-law was delighted with the gift just because it affords her that opportunity, as she has been a dedicated Dr Who fan for a long time, but the years represented in this collection are from before when she started following the series.Personally, I was surprised the extent to which all the actors on these early shows were ""playing it straight"". For no particularly good reason than a preconceived notion, I was expecting a lot of camp in these shows, and they were not campy at all.Highly recommended for Dr. Who fans who would like to go back in time to see what the very first Dr. Who was like, and what the writing and production quality of early episodes presented.",5,Shows so old even Dr Who die hards may not have seen them,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,1519,"['disclaimer', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'video', 'part', 'product', 'bought', 'Christmas', 'present', 'daughter-in-law', 'watched', 'shows', 'video', 'first', 'DVD', 'family.First', 'thought', 'video', 'was', 'surprising', 'good', 'quality', 'TV', 'shows', 'age', 'where', 'preservation', 'video', 'not', 'been', 'priority', 'Interestingly', 'are', 'shows', 'video', 'not', 'survive', 'have', 'included', 'audio', 'only', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'seeing', 'complete', 'stories', 'here', 'episodes', 'tied', 'together', 'make', 'entire', 'story', 'arc', 'most', 'cases', 'not', 'enough', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'recovered', 'provide', 'complete', 'story', 'arc', 'have', 'provided', 'what', 'could', 'find.For', 'reason', 'product', 'more', 'satisfy', 'curiosity', 'what', 'early', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'were', 'fine', 'job', 'daughter-in-law', 'was', 'delighted', 'gift', 'just', 'opportunity', 'been', 'dedicated', 'Dr', 'Who', 'long', 'time', 'years', 'represented', 'collection', 'are', 'when', 'started', 'following', 'series.Personally', 'was', 'surprised', 'extent', 'actors', 'early', 'shows', 'were', 'playing', 'straight', 'particularly', 'good', 'reason', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'camp', 'shows', 'were', 'not', 'campy', 'all.Highly', 'recommended', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'fans', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'see', 'what', 'very', 'first', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'was', 'what', 'writing', 'production', 'quality', 'early', 'episodes', 'presented']",Doctor Who - Lost in Time Collection of Rare Episodes - The William Hartnell Years and the Patrick Troughton Years
842664,AW135H6P4JXKC,B0002OXVF0,buckbooks,"[3, 3]","Two hundred fifty-three episodes of Doctor Who were taped between 1963 and 1969. Most of these episodes were erased in the 1970s so that the BBC could reuse the valuable tape and because contracts with the artists and agreements with various unions limited the shows to an initial broadcast and one rerun. Before they were wiped, however, virtually all of these episodes were transferred to film for broadcast in overseas markets that still did not use videotape. Some of these film copies have been recovered, from far-flung television stations and enterprising film collectors, but 108 episodes remained missing as of the 2004 release of this set, with a decreasing likelihood any more will ever be found.""Lost in Time"" is a collection of 18 rare episodes preserving what's left of many of the legendary ""lost"" stories from the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton years. These include: three episodes from the 12-part ""Daleks' Master Plan,"" which featured the series debut of Nicholas Courtney, who would later play Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart; the only surviving episode of ""The Evil of the Daleks,"" which introduced Deborah Watling as Victoria; two episodes from ""The Wheel in Space,"" which introduced Wendy Padbury as Zoe; and single episodes from such classics as ""The Celestial Toymaker,"" ""The Underwater Menace,"" ""The Abominable Snowmen,"" ""The Enemy of the World"" and ""The Web of Fear."" The set also features extracts from programs that were copied for promotional purposes or clipped out by overseas censors for their violence.Begin watching this set by inserting Disc 2 of the Patrick Troughton years and selecting the ""Missing Years"" documentary from the Special Features menu. This 1998 documentary, hosted by Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, explains why so many episodes of Doctor Who (and countless other BBC programs) were junked and how they were later recovered--including two episodes from the basement of a Mormon church!

Part of their pennance includes the reconstructed version ofDoctor Who - The Invasion, and another part includes this set.There is, sadly, no complete episode in this package. There's a couple complete STORIES, but they either have bridging materiel or they have the soundtrack but not the images (this is possible due to the fact that fans back in the day would record the audio to listen to later. As a result we have the soundtrack for every single episode, which is why ""The Invasion"" was possible).But with the fragments here, there are some real gems, like ""The Crusade"" and ""The Enemy of the World"" (Salamander rocks!).

842666,A11GO5VA74HD8K,B0002OXVF0,Crazy Fox,"[9, 9]","Something about ""Doctor Who"" certainly inspires dedication in the show's fans. There is not really a single complete storyline in this whole DVD set, just scattered, random fragments of storylines. One or two episodes out of four or six, three episodes out of twelve--merely bits and pieces. And yet we find ourselves watching them with all the enthusiasm of a classical scholar who has come across some stray pages from the Library of Alexandria. Sure, it'd be nice to have the whole archive complete, but barring that, these fragmentary glimpses of the show in its formative years are a treasure.Different folks will come to this with different preferences, of course. I myself was especially enthralled by the bits from ""The Moonbase"" and ""The Wheel in Space""--both for the vintage early appearances of the Cybermen and for the classic ""space age"" manner in which the future was envisioned. The long, fantastically involved bits from ""The Dalek's Masterplan"" were neat for similar reasons, though set in a much more distant future. As someone with an interest in Asian religions, I found the setting of ""The Abominable Snowmen"" in a Buddhist monastery to be particularly noteworthy. And in ""The Faceless Ones"" seeing the Tardis materialize on an airport landing strip (of all places) was priceless. These were some of the highlights for me, but the whole thing was enjoyable overall.Of course, it must be said that this is enjoyment of a very masochistic sort. There you are, getting into the story, mesmerized by William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton's incredible performances, thrilled by the threats of enemies familiar and unfamiliar, following along as the plot thickens and the suspense quickens...right up until the episode's cliffhanger. And that's it. You'll never see what happens next. I found myself shouting in dismay almost every time, as if I didn't know this was inevitable from the start.

Many of the initial episodes from the Hartnell/Troughton era were destroyed and never aired in the US. Many of the previous reviews have the details as to why this unfortunate situation occurred so I will not repeat.Dr Who was a roughly 20-25min weeekly serial that aired on the BBC starting in 1963 (oddly, the first episode aired the day JFK was assasinated). Each full storyline contains anywhere from 4-12 episodes. Some of the episodes from these full storylines are intact while some unfortunately are missing. In other words, you have one or two surviving episodes and the rest of the episodes of the storyline are completely missing.What this DVD compilation is, is a collection of the surviving episodes. There's an episode 3 for one storyline, and an episode 5 in another storyline. You're not getting complete storylines, just bits and pieces here and there.Now there is audio for The Crusades and The Moonbase. but it's just audio. I say this because other ""Missing"" episodes I have bought in the past (THe Tenth Planet on VHS, The Ice Warriors, The Invasion) have had the original audio with telesnaps of the missing episode accompanied by either narration or subtitles. The VHS release of The Invasion originally had Nicholas Courtney giving brief summaries of the missing episodes in between the existing episodes. The DVD release of the Invasion provided the original audio occampanied by animation. I don't understand why this couldn't be done here. With the audio only, you get an idea of what might be happening (Ben, Polly, and Jaime jumping on the Moon in Episode 1 of the Moonbase) but you really don't have a clear understanding of what is going on. That's the only real disappointment with this set.However, it should be noted that many fans have put up there own audio of missing episodes complete with animation, subtitles explaing what's going on in the background, telesnaps, etc on Youtube.Still, I will enjoy watching this collection greatly and am happy with my purchase.",5,"Great to see lost episodes, wish there was telesnap continuity",1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,2059,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'new', 'Dr', 'Who', 'fans', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'Many', 'initial', 'episodes', 'Hartnell/Troughton', 'era', 'were', 'destroyed', 'never', 'aired', 'US', 'Many', 'previous', 'reviews', 'have', 'details', 'why', 'unfortunate', 'situation', 'occurred', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'repeat.Dr', 'Who', 'was', 'roughly', '20-25min', 'weeekly', 'serial', 'aired', 'BBC', 'starting', '1963', 'oddly', 'first', 'episode', 'aired', 'day', 'JFK', 'was', 'assasinated', 'full', 'storyline', 'contains', 'anywhere', '4-12', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'full', 'storylines', 'are', 'intact', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'missing', 'other', 'words', 'have', 'one', 'two', 'surviving', 'episodes', 'rest', 'episodes', 'storyline', 'are', 'completely', 'DVD', 'compilation', 'collection', 'surviving', 'episodes', 'episode', '3', 'one', 'storyline', 'episode', '5', 'storyline', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', 'complete', 'storylines', 'just', 'bits', 'pieces', 'here', 'there.Now', 'audio', 'Crusades', 'Moonbase', 'just', 'audio', 'say', 'other', 'Missing', 'episodes', 'have', 'bought', 'past', 'THe', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'VHS', 'Ice', 'Warriors', 'Invasion', 'have', 'had', 'original', 'audio', 'telesnaps', 'missing', 'episode', 'accompanied', 'narration', 'subtitles', 'VHS', 'release', 'Invasion', 'originally', 'had', 'Nicholas', 'Courtney', 'giving', 'brief', 'summaries', 'missing', 'episodes', 'existing', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'release', 'Invasion', 'provided', 'original', 'audio', 'occampanied', 'animation', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'here', 'audio', 'only', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'happening', 'Ben', 'Polly', 'Jaime', 'jumping', 'Moon', 'Episode', '1', 'Moonbase', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clear', 'understanding', 'what', 'going', 'only', 'real', 'disappointment', 'set.However', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'many', 'fans', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'there', 'own', 'audio', 'missing', 'episodes', 'complete', 'animation', 'explaing', 'what', 'going', 'background', 'telesnaps', 'etc', 'Youtube.Still', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'collection', 'greatly', 'am', 'happy', 'purchase']",Doctor Who - Lost in Time Collection of Rare Episodes - The William Hartnell Years and the Patrick Troughton Years
