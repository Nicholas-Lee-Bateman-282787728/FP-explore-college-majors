The concept generally includes the outcast kid who is obviously picked on by everyone, dies, and somehow inhabits the body of a scarecrow, and thereby wreak havoc on all who wronged him.  Fun idea.  Sadly, though, the execution was very week.  Its obviously low budget, which is not bad per se, but with the low budget comes poor directing - lots of very empty filler camera shots that go nowhere.

I'm surprised so many reviewers didn't mention this. Once I saw the age discrepancy, I knew I was in for it.The scarecrow costume wasn't bad and maybe the best thing about this film. In all fairness, though, the kill scenes were decent and entertaining.I purchased the DVD that has Scarecrow and Scarecrow Slayer on one disc.Now, don't expect phenomenal quality in terms of compression.

734801,AR61Y2VWLST1V,B000087F66,"Holly Apollyon ""Messiah of Regret and Entropy""","[2, 2]","I think there have been a handful of these death-animated slasher-scarecrow movies, all of which seem to come complete with a whole mass of acting and continuity problems. This one is no exception. As far as shooting, casting and special effects went, this movie reminded me of Bloody Murder 2, and it even had this chick from Bloody Murder 2. There are a scatter of hot-looking girls, which is cool. And another good thing is that, in this movie, you look forward to seeing just about everyone die.There's this skinny high school kid that's constantly getting picked on by all of the nancy-boy bullies; this part of the movie is familiar enough. But they went overboard. The ridicule is just a little over the top, complete with a teacher that calls the kid white trash in front of a whole classroom; I don't think they can really get away with that kind of stuff these days, can they? Anyway, the little chick from Bloody Murder 2 is the only one that defends the guy. And he's in love with her. Then, the skinny kid sees the Bloody Murder chick kissing the pudgy football punk that ridicules him the most. Enraged, the kid goes home, and promptly walks in on his lowlife mother and some pot-bellied slouch fornicating like dogs. The slouch ends up killing the kid, and his soul jumps into the body of a very horror-movie-looking scarecrow.This could have been cool, but they just messed it up. For some reason, the Scarecrow, armed with two small scythes, has to enter every scene with a spinning Power Rangers flip. Uggh. And, they gave him this stupid Freddy voice complete with a full arsenal of cheap one-liners. Uggh #2. Now, this is an area in which the time-honored techniques of the main man, Vorhees, divide the neophyte johnny-come-lately slashers from the true masters. Vorhees just goes in and does his thing, never stopping for some kind of jerkweed Freddy comment, just getting business done. Yeah baby. But, the Scarecrow does kill the football punk by cramming an ear of corn into his ear, and he does another creep with the let-you-see-your-heart-before-you-die trick. So, I mean, the movie does have its moments. However, next time, I'd go with alot more Vorhees and ALOT less Freddy.The Bloody Murder chick ends up burning the Scarecrow, but it seems that he now has the ability to soul-transfer at will. Ostensibly, he can't be destroyed---so I guess his ghost haunts the images of a sequel yet to come. Maybe they'll get the formula straightened out by then.",2,Okay,1051056000,"04 23, 2003",2003,2482,"['think', 'have', 'been', 'handful', 'death-animated', 'slasher-scarecrow', 'movies', 'seem', 'come', 'complete', 'whole', 'mass', 'acting', 'continuity', 'problems', 'one', 'exception', 'As', 'far', 'shooting', 'casting', 'special', 'effects', 'went', 'movie', 'reminded', 'Bloody', 'Murder', '2', 'even', 'had', 'chick', 'Bloody', 'Murder', '2', 'are', 'scatter', 'hot-looking', 'girls', 'cool', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'just', 'everyone', 'skinny', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'constantly', 'getting', 'picked', 'nancy-boy', 'bullies', 'part', 'movie', 'familiar', 'enough', 'went', 'overboard', 'ridicule', 'just', 'little', 'top', 'complete', 'teacher', 'kid', 'white', 'trash', 'front', 'whole', 'classroom', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'away', 'kind', 'stuff', 'days', 'can', 'Anyway', 'little', 'chick', 'Bloody', 'Murder', '2', 'only', 'one', 'guy', 'love', 'Then', 'skinny', 'kid', 'Bloody', 'Murder', 'chick', 'kissing', 'pudgy', 'football', 'punk', 'most', 'Enraged', 'kid', 'home', 'promptly', 'walks', 'lowlife', 'mother', 'pot-bellied', 'slouch', 'fornicating', 'dogs', 'slouch', 'up', 'killing', 'kid', 'soul', 'body', 'very', 'horror-movie-looking', 'scarecrow.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'just', 'messed', 'up', 'reason', 'Scarecrow', 'armed', 'two', 'small', 'scythes', 'enter', 'scene', 'spinning', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'flip', 'Uggh', 'gave', 'stupid', 'Freddy', 'voice', 'complete', 'full', 'arsenal', 'cheap', 'one-liners', 'Uggh', '2', 'Now', 'area', 'time-honored', 'techniques', 'main', 'man', 'Vorhees', 'neophyte', 'johnny-come-lately', 'slashers', 'true', 'masters', 'Vorhees', 'just', 'thing', 'never', 'stopping', 'kind', 'jerkweed', 'Freddy', 'comment', 'just', 'getting', 'business', 'done', 'Yeah', 'baby', 'Scarecrow', 'kill', 'football', 'punk', 'cramming', 'ear', 'corn', 'ear', 'creep', 'let-you-see-your-heart-before-you-die', 'trick', 'So', 'mean', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'However', 'next', 'time', ""'d"", 'go', 'alot', 'more', 'Vorhees', 'ALOT', 'less', 'Freddy.The', 'Bloody', 'Murder', 'chick', 'up', 'burning', 'Scarecrow', 'now', 'ability', 'soul-transfer', 'will', 'Ostensibly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'destroyed', '-so', 'guess', 'ghost', 'images', 'sequel', 'yet', 'come', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'get', 'formula', 'straightened', 'out', 'then']",Scarecrow
734802,A2FDWH4W7Y151F,B000087F66,John La Rocca,"[2, 3]","I am getting really tired of renting these new straight to video horror films and getting nothing that shocks or scares me.  I read the back of this DVD case and I decided to rent it at the my  local video store.  I don't mind the bad acting or the bad script cause that is what B movies are all about.  Script was bad, but the overal story was even worst.The story of a kid being picked on by everyone from his Mom's drunk boyfriend, to every popular kid at school, to even his teacher was a lame storyline for a backstory of a killer.  What made Michael Myers so scary in Halloween was we didn't know why he was crazy.  Now this poor kid dies and some how and someway his spirit goes into a scarecrow out in the fields and then goes for his revenge.  OK, why would I be scared of a guy trying to get revenge on all the people who tortured this poor kid?  I wouldn't be scared, but I would root for the guy to get his revenge.The director in the ""Behind the Scene"" extra talks about his mentor's Dario Argento, John Carpenter, Wes Craven etc etc etc. He even gives them thanks before the credits roll at the end.  But this director has no clue what made those great horror directors so great.  He then said he wanted to tap into what the kids today like.  Horror, matrix style fighting, and comic book style.  OK, horror fans DO NO, I repeat DO NOT want to see a Scarecrow do flips OK!  Top it all off we have another killer trying to be FUNNY.  Freddy Kruger might have popularized the comedy line before or after killing someone, but it was the first Nightmare On Elmstreet everyone calls the best because it was creepy, scary and NOT FUNNY.The only thing that was good was the makeup of the Scarecrow which really looked fabulous.  The main heroin was great, but the plotline just wasn't scary and you ended up not carrying.  Also never start off a story by saying there will be a suprise twist at the end. BTW, the suprise twist you can see coming a MILLION and ONE MILES away.Also these new horror movies of today are just too slick.  I hate the digital shot ones.  Even with low budget (This movie was shot in 8 days) still it came off too slick.  I think these new directors need to go back and watch the great horror movies of the 70's and 80's and learn why these films where so good.",1,When a B movie becomes a B movie wanna B!,1061596800,"08 23, 2003",2003,2294,"['am', 'getting', 'really', 'tired', 'renting', 'new', 'straight', 'video', 'horror', 'films', 'getting', 'nothing', 'read', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'decided', 'rent', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'script', 'cause', 'what', 'B', 'movies', 'are', 'Script', 'was', 'bad', 'overal', 'story', 'was', 'even', 'worst.The', 'story', 'kid', 'being', 'picked', 'everyone', 'Mom', 'drunk', 'boyfriend', 'popular', 'kid', 'school', 'even', 'teacher', 'was', 'lame', 'storyline', 'backstory', 'killer', 'What', 'made', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'so', 'scary', 'Halloween', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', 'crazy', 'Now', 'poor', 'kid', 'dies', 'how', 'someway', 'spirit', 'scarecrow', 'out', 'fields', 'then', 'revenge', 'OK', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'scared', 'guy', 'trying', 'get', 'revenge', 'people', 'who', 'tortured', 'poor', 'kid', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'scared', 'would', 'root', 'guy', 'get', 'revenge.The', 'director', 'Scene', 'extra', 'talks', 'mentor', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'even', 'thanks', 'credits', 'roll', 'end', 'director', 'clue', 'what', 'made', 'great', 'horror', 'directors', 'so', 'great', 'then', 'said', 'wanted', 'tap', 'what', 'kids', 'today', 'Horror', 'matrix', 'style', 'fighting', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'OK', 'horror', 'fans', 'DO', 'NO', 'repeat', 'DO', 'NOT', 'want', 'see', 'Scarecrow', 'do', 'flips', 'OK', 'Top', 'have', 'killer', 'trying', 'be', 'FUNNY', 'Freddy', 'Kruger', 'might', 'have', 'popularized', 'comedy', 'line', 'killing', 'someone', 'was', 'first', 'Nightmare', 'Elmstreet', 'everyone', 'best', 'was', 'creepy', 'scary', 'NOT', 'FUNNY.The', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'makeup', 'Scarecrow', 'really', 'looked', 'fabulous', 'main', 'heroin', 'was', 'great', 'plotline', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'ended', 'up', 'not', 'carrying', 'Also', 'never', 'start', 'off', 'story', 'saying', 'will', 'be', 'suprise', 'twist', 'end', 'BTW', 'suprise', 'twist', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'MILLION', 'ONE', 'MILES', 'new', 'horror', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'slick', 'hate', 'digital', 'shot', 'ones', 'Even', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', '8', 'days', 'still', 'came', 'off', 'too', 'slick', 'think', 'new', 'directors', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'great', 'horror', 'movies', '70', '80', 'learn', 'why', 'films', 'where', 'so', 'good']",Scarecrow

Scarecrow comes the closest I've ever seen, even beating Battlefield Earth.  It's so bad that it's actually funny; Not good, funny.Scarecrow stars a 30 year old high school student, a porn star, the directors friends and Earl Hickey.  After being pushed to the edge by everyone, Lester Dwervick  ends up dead, but his vengeful spirit lives on in the body of a scarecrow and begins taking his revenge, one by one on everybody who did him wrong, while coming up with several contrived excuses to do acrobatic flips over what ever obstacle happens to be present.  As the bodies begin to pile up, it's up to Tiffany Shepis to combat this evil scarecrow who is armed with the worst one-liners in history.The thing I noticed straight away with Scarecrow is that it isn't scary.  This isn't helped by the scarecrow uttering the most ridiculous lines ever thought up.  This can best be summarised in the scene when the Scarecrow makes it's first appearance.  Picture it like this.  It's close to midnight, there's a low lying fog, there's very little light, and Earl Hickey is wandering along, drunk as a skunk, cursing the late Lester Dwervick, calling him an idiot.  Suddenly, from within the darkness, a hollow deep voice booms, ""Takes one to know one; Idiot!""  I laughed the soda was a drinking through my nose when I heard that.  There's absolutely no pacing or effective use of stillness. The Scarecrow just can't get enough of the spotlight, back flipping off car roofs and displaying himself from the earliest opportunity, even in broad daylight.The actors are all terrible, and look like they're in this film because they're the directors friends, giving it that Ed Wood feel, and possibly the same Ed Wood magic.  Tim Young dose not look like a high school student, and Tiffany Shepis wins all the Razzie awards for Most Obviously Crowbarred-In Love Interest, Most Irritating, Most Stereotypical Beautiful Heroine, and Lifetime Achievement.  However, speaking in Ms Shepis defence, Halle Berry could've have played the roll, and the character would still have failed because there was simply nothing to play.  The dialogue she had to work with and the character development were utter garbage, not helped by the fact that the character she's playing is a Mary Sue.Despite all the flaws I mentioned, I kept watching until the end, laughing all the way and even shaking my head at the obvious shock ending that's about as shocking as that ninja baby on YouTube.  Still, after watching the whole thing and getting a good laugh out of it, I have found that after putting it back on my shelf, I have no desire to watch it again.",2,Almost Plan 9-ish,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,2737,"['never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'live', 'see', 'movie', 'almost', 'had', 'same', 'bad', 'quality', 'Plan', '9', 'Outer', 'Space', 'Scarecrow', 'closest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'even', 'beating', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'funny', 'Not', 'good', 'funny.Scarecrow', '30', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'porn', 'star', 'directors', 'friends', 'Earl', 'Hickey', 'being', 'pushed', 'edge', 'everyone', 'Lester', 'Dwervick', 'up', 'dead', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'lives', 'body', 'scarecrow', 'taking', 'revenge', 'one', 'one', 'everybody', 'who', 'did', 'wrong', 'coming', 'up', 'several', 'contrived', 'excuses', 'do', 'acrobatic', 'flips', 'what', 'ever', 'obstacle', 'happens', 'be', 'present', 'bodies', 'begin', 'pile', 'up', 'up', 'Tiffany', 'Shepis', 'combat', 'evil', 'scarecrow', 'who', 'armed', 'worst', 'one-liners', 'history.The', 'thing', 'noticed', 'straight', 'away', 'Scarecrow', ""n't"", 'scary', ""n't"", 'helped', 'scarecrow', 'uttering', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'lines', 'ever', 'thought', 'up', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'summarised', 'scene', 'when', 'Scarecrow', 'first', 'appearance', 'Picture', 'close', 'midnight', 'low', 'lying', 'fog', 'very', 'little', 'light', 'Earl', 'Hickey', 'wandering', 'along', 'drunk', 'skunk', 'cursing', 'late', 'Lester', 'Dwervick', 'calling', 'idiot', 'Suddenly', 'darkness', 'hollow', 'deep', 'voice', 'booms', 'one', 'know', 'one', 'Idiot', 'laughed', 'soda', 'was', 'drinking', 'nose', 'when', 'heard', 'absolutely', 'pacing', 'effective', 'use', 'stillness', 'Scarecrow', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'spotlight', 'back', 'flipping', 'off', 'car', 'roofs', 'displaying', 'earliest', 'opportunity', 'even', 'broad', 'daylight.The', 'actors', 'are', 'terrible', 'look', ""'re"", 'film', ""'re"", 'directors', 'friends', 'giving', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'feel', 'possibly', 'same', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'magic', 'Tim', 'Young', 'dose', 'not', 'look', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Tiffany', 'Shepis', 'Razzie', 'awards', 'Most', 'Obviously', 'Crowbarred-In', 'Love', 'Interest', 'Most', 'Irritating', 'Most', 'Stereotypical', 'Beautiful', 'Heroine', 'Lifetime', 'Achievement', 'However', 'speaking', 'Ms', 'Shepis', 'defence', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'could', ""'ve"", 'have', 'played', 'roll', 'character', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'failed', 'was', 'simply', 'nothing', 'play', 'dialogue', 'had', 'work', 'character', 'development', 'were', 'utter', 'garbage', 'not', 'helped', 'fact', 'character', 'playing', 'Mary', 'Sue.Despite', 'flaws', 'mentioned', 'kept', 'watching', 'end', 'laughing', 'way', 'even', 'shaking', 'head', 'obvious', 'shock', 'ending', 'about', 'as', 'shocking', 'baby', 'YouTube', 'Still', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing', 'getting', 'good', 'laugh', 'have', 'found', 'putting', 'back', 'shelf', 'have', 'desire', 'watch', 'again']",Scarecrow

Nothings better then that time when September rolls around bring us football and plenty of b horror choices with October right around the corner. Nothing really fits the mood better then a scarecrow themed flick to bring us to the nice frame of mind. While cruising through some online choices we stumbled across a film we'd noticed years ago but never got around to renting called Scarecrow. Judging from the cover it had promise of delivering the B-ness we always look for with also some high hopes of actually being creepy. Well unfortunately within the first minute we came to the realization this one couldn't even be enjoyed for laughs...something that is very hard not to accomplish when it comes to the Super Sid brothers.The film starts out with some kid getting impaled with a pole while trying to fix his mustang on the side of the road, and goes so quickly downhill from there without chance of redemption. Naturally being the B lovers we are we had to give the film a fair shake hoping their might be the slightest glimpse of entertainment. However just came up empty in every possible way. It started to remind us of our worst watch ever!Halloween Nightor maybe it's runner upRise Of The Scarecrowsin the way of providing no sense of enjoyment for even the simplest of minds.
