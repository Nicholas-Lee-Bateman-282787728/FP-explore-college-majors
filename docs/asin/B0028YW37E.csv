In short, a group of socially deviant 20-somethings decide to break into an old crypt and rob graves, only to find the crypt inhabited by ghost-ish creatures intent on not letting them make off with the loot. On the good side, the production values are surprisingly good.  This isn't quite a micro-budget film, but it definitely is low budget.  Annoyingly, they used a camera that isn't well adapted to low light conditions, so the dark scenes have lots of digital artifacts that don't look so nice on a HDTV. But aside from the camera quality, the production values are surprisingly good; good camera work and good sets make for a movie that seems larger budget than it actually is.  However, the film really breaks down on the acting and script. The opening scene is good - it drew me in, did a good job of setting the mood and future expectations, etc.  From there out, though, it grinds to a halt.  The story fails to develop the grave robbing team as a group of individuals who would actually be inclined to rob a grave.  There's a lead guy on the team who gets released from jail in an early scene, and he gets paired with a group of females who are much more valley girl (think Clueless) than hard core. They're just not believable at all.  Then there's the actual story of them robbing graves.  Obviously there are ghosts involved, and that is perhaps the biggest problem with the film.  The film seems to reject modern notions of computer graphics and opts instead for very mediocre makeup.  The ghosts look ridiculous, period.  All in all, I very hesitatingly might consider recommending a rental if you're really in the mood for a low budget horror-ish flick, but certainly not a purchase.",2,"Decent Concept, Terrible Acting",1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,1747,"['possible', ""'d"", 'give', '1.5', 'star', 'rating', 'short', 'group', 'socially', 'deviant', '20-somethings', 'decide', 'break', 'old', 'crypt', 'rob', 'graves', 'only', 'find', 'crypt', 'inhabited', 'ghost-ish', 'creatures', 'intent', 'not', 'letting', 'make', 'off', 'loot', 'good', 'side', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', ""n't"", 'quite', 'micro-budget', 'film', 'definitely', 'low', 'budget', 'Annoyingly', 'used', 'camera', ""n't"", 'well', 'adapted', 'low', 'light', 'conditions', 'dark', 'scenes', 'have', 'lots', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'nice', 'HDTV', 'aside', 'camera', 'quality', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'good', 'sets', 'make', 'movie', 'larger', 'budget', 'actually', 'However', 'film', 'really', 'down', 'acting', 'script', 'opening', 'scene', 'good', 'drew', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'mood', 'future', 'expectations', 'etc', 'halt', 'story', 'develop', 'grave', 'robbing', 'team', 'group', 'individuals', 'who', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'inclined', 'rob', 'grave', 'lead', 'guy', 'team', 'who', 'released', 'jail', 'early', 'scene', 'paired', 'group', 'females', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'valley', 'girl', 'think', 'Clueless', 'hard', 'core', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'Then', 'actual', 'story', 'robbing', 'graves', 'Obviously', 'are', 'ghosts', 'involved', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'film', 'reject', 'modern', 'notions', 'computer', 'graphics', 'opts', 'instead', 'very', 'mediocre', 'makeup', 'ghosts', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'period', 'very', 'hesitatingly', 'might', 'consider', 'recommending', 'rental', ""'re"", 'really', 'mood', 'low', 'budget', 'horror-ish', 'flick', 'certainly', 'not', 'purchase']",The Crypt

1256348,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0028YW37E,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Having just suffered throughReborn, I don't know what possessed me to turn around and watch another Craig McMahon movie - but I'm glad I did because The Crypt is a deliciously creepy little film.  Unlike the utter nonsense of Reborn, The Crypt has a decent storyline, atmosphere, suspense, and even subtlety.  It's hard for me to believe the same man wrote and directed both of these films.  I was actually talking back to the screen during this film's final ten minutes of action.  I wouldn't say the ending is unconventional, but I certainly didn't expect things to play out the way they did.  Clearly, Craig McMahon has some talent and potential, after all.It was supposed to be an easy job.  There are a bunch of rich, Depression-era dead people buried in a maze of crypts underneath the city, just waiting for some enterprising young criminals to come down and relieve them of their riches (the dead folks apparently thought the government was going to try and take their treasures, so they took them to the grave with them).  Of course, we all know from the film's opening scene that grave robbing can be a dangerous pastime down in the Crypt - but the modern-day characters in the story don't know that.  Still, when Gina (Abra May) first broaches the subject with her friends, none of them are enthusiastic to say the least - but the lure of those buried riches soon changes their way of thinking.  Soon after the six criminals make their way into the crypt, it starts to become clear that something is very wrong down there.  At first, it manifests as shadows in individuals' peripheral vision, but as soon as they rake in their first haul the whole edifice seems to rock and shift, blocking the way out in the process.  The six soon become separated into three groups, and that is when the underground monsters come out to play - and to punish those would dare steal from the very coffins of the dead.The lovely Sarah Oh shines in this film as the most reluctant member of the group, but I thought the acting was pretty good all the way around.  The special effects are also well-done, making the inhabitants of the crypt genuinely creepy in appearance.  I also thought the pacing of the film was quite good, which necessarily contributes to the overall creepiness of the whole experience.  If you're as claustrophobic as I am, all of the time spent in the crypts is even more unsettling.  It is not nearly as intense asThe Descent (Original Unrated Cut) [Widescreen Edition](a film which might well have inspired The Crypt), but it's there - and you can feel it.Given the way the film ends, it's clear that Craig McMahon put some real thought into the story - with the exception of one scene early on.  It's a great scene, actually, but it really has no purpose in the context of the overall story and is quickly brushed aside.  That is obviously a problem, but it did little to temper my enjoyment of The Crypt.  I didn't think Craig McMahon had it in him, but this is a darn good horror film.",4,A surprisingly creepy and suspenseful horror thriller,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,3005,"['Having', 'just', 'suffered', 'throughReborn', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'possessed', 'turn', 'around', 'watch', 'Craig', 'McMahon', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Crypt', 'deliciously', 'creepy', 'little', 'film', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'Reborn', 'Crypt', 'decent', 'storyline', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'even', 'subtlety', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'man', 'wrote', 'directed', 'films', 'was', 'actually', 'talking', 'back', 'screen', 'film', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'action', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'ending', 'unconventional', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'way', 'did', 'Clearly', 'Craig', 'McMahon', 'talent', 'potential', 'all.It', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'easy', 'job', 'are', 'bunch', 'rich', 'Depression-era', 'dead', 'people', 'buried', 'maze', 'crypts', 'city', 'just', 'waiting', 'enterprising', 'young', 'criminals', 'come', 'down', 'relieve', 'riches', 'dead', 'folks', 'apparently', 'thought', 'government', 'was', 'going', 'try', 'take', 'treasures', 'took', 'grave', 'course', 'know', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'grave', 'robbing', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'pastime', 'down', 'Crypt', 'modern-day', 'characters', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Still', 'when', 'Gina', 'Abra', 'May', 'first', 'subject', 'friends', 'none', 'are', 'enthusiastic', 'say', 'least', 'lure', 'buried', 'riches', 'soon', 'changes', 'way', 'thinking', 'Soon', 'six', 'criminals', 'make', 'way', 'crypt', 'become', 'clear', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'there', 'first', 'shadows', 'individuals', 'peripheral', 'vision', 'as', 'soon', 'rake', 'first', 'haul', 'whole', 'edifice', 'rock', 'shift', 'blocking', 'way', 'process', 'six', 'soon', 'become', 'separated', 'three', 'groups', 'when', 'underground', 'monsters', 'come', 'play', 'punish', 'would', 'dare', 'steal', 'very', 'coffins', 'dead.The', 'lovely', 'Sarah', 'Oh', 'shines', 'film', 'most', 'reluctant', 'member', 'group', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'well-done', 'making', 'inhabitants', 'crypt', 'genuinely', 'appearance', 'also', 'thought', 'pacing', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'necessarily', 'overall', 'creepiness', 'whole', 'experience', ""'re"", 'as', 'claustrophobic', 'am', 'time', 'spent', 'crypts', 'even', 'more', 'unsettling', 'not', 'nearly', 'intense', 'asThe', 'Descent', 'Original', 'Unrated', 'Cut', '[', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', ']', 'film', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'inspired', 'Crypt', 'can', 'feel', 'it.Given', 'way', 'film', 'clear', 'Craig', 'McMahon', 'put', 'real', 'thought', 'story', 'exception', 'one', 'scene', 'early', 'great', 'scene', 'actually', 'really', 'purpose', 'context', 'overall', 'story', 'quickly', 'brushed', 'aside', 'obviously', 'problem', 'did', 'little', 'temper', 'enjoyment', 'Crypt', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Craig', 'McMahon', 'had', 'darn', 'good', 'horror', 'film']",The Crypt

I don't read any reviews and take a gamble!  I'm glad I did with this one because it kept my attention throughout the whole flick.  The story is very entertaining and I LOVE what the creator(s) have done with the ghostly zombie concept!  Those glowing eyes are crazy!  I think this is the first flick I've ever seen ghosts depicted like that.  Not loaded with gore but it didn't need that.  Most horrors these days tend to go that route.  There are some scenes in this flick that did manage to spook me slightly haha.  So for that, being that its a low-budget  zombie-like ghost flick, it deserves a five star rating in my opinion.

1256350,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B0028YW37E,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 0]","The Crypt is about a small group of people who discover there is a maze of crypts underneath the city, where a bunch of tombs lay of people who where buried with their personal valuables because they thought the government was going to steal them or something. It's no spoiler to tell you that the place is haunted, and the ghosts do not want their jewels and things taken, and will defend. You can just hear the screams of ""this is a movie about the group of them trying to get back out, right?"" ... yup. It sure is.The acting of the movie is not too bad, especially judging by the trailer, I thought it was going to be very bad. The visual is kinda dodgy in the beginning of outside shots, but once in the crypts, it's a decent enough visual atmosphere with acceptable lighting. The sound is good, the score fits well, and the plot of the whole thing is OK up until towards the end of the movie. There is a scene where a ghost is staring at them under water... and from here on in until the end, the whole thing lost the plot and went lame. The ghost looked stupid and the events that followed where ridicules, and then the very end it made me think ""What? Is that it? Why did they even bother to do that?"" just like in the very first 5 minutes of the movie, a scene happens to a guy in a car, and after the film was over, I kept thinking to myself, ""what did that have to do with anything? Why was it even written, shot, edited and put into the movie at all?, it had nothing to do with anything""Rent it if you are interested, or D/L it, but I really recommend you see this before thinking about purchasing it. I can't see it being something anyone would watch over and over and over again based on the assumption they think it's a good movie worth seeing more then a couple of times.",3,Was decent until the end.,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,1786,"['Crypt', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'discover', 'maze', 'crypts', 'city', 'where', 'bunch', 'tombs', 'lay', 'people', 'who', 'where', 'buried', 'personal', 'valuables', 'thought', 'government', 'was', 'going', 'steal', 'something', 'spoiler', 'tell', 'place', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'jewels', 'things', 'taken', 'will', 'defend', 'can', 'just', 'hear', 'screams', 'movie', 'group', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'out', 'right', 'yup', 'sure', 'is.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'especially', 'judging', 'trailer', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'visual', 'kinda', 'dodgy', 'beginning', 'outside', 'shots', 'once', 'crypts', 'decent', 'enough', 'visual', 'atmosphere', 'acceptable', 'lighting', 'sound', 'good', 'score', 'well', 'plot', 'whole', 'thing', 'OK', 'up', 'towards', 'end', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'ghost', 'staring', 'water', 'here', 'end', 'whole', 'thing', 'lost', 'plot', 'went', 'lame', 'ghost', 'looked', 'stupid', 'events', 'followed', 'where', 'ridicules', 'then', 'very', 'end', 'made', 'think', 'What', 'Why', 'did', 'even', 'bother', 'do', 'just', 'very', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'scene', 'guy', 'car', 'film', 'was', 'kept', 'thinking', 'myself', 'what', 'did', 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'Why', 'was', 'even', 'written', 'shot', 'edited', 'put', 'movie', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'Rent', 'are', 'interested', 'D/L', 'really', 'recommend', 'see', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'something', 'anyone', 'would', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'based', 'assumption', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'seeing', 'more', 'then', 'couple', 'times']",The Crypt
