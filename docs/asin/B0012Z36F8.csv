But the end could be taken as some closure if you see it in another perspective. you can see it that Heaven on earth is happening just like Jordan dreamt about. cause seattle is now Promise city and you can take that Tom does take the shot cause since the book says he does then he will. Cause the ending really did not end on a nail biting cliffhanger like the rest of the seasons. If a 5th comes out I can't wait and if it does not then I am satisfied with the way it ended.,5,The best season of the series.

The only problem I have with it is that it was cancelled and ended on a BIG-TIME cliffhanger.That being said it is still worth checking out.

In this case though I think they could have pulled at least one or two more seasons from this series. This season ties up some but not all of the loose ends from the previous seasons though it does add a couple of its own.  While probably not the best season of the series it does a good job of coming up with new angles to explore the characters we've come to know.

The central tale revolves around a core group but each week there is a guest ability featured.  There are many organizations trying to use the 4400 to its own ends so we have vilains from government, industry and family all trying to take advantage of the talents demonstrated by the returnees.  Sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's good and who's bad (and even who's dead and who's alive).This show draws from many sources but still manages to be unique and stand on its own.  It has a bit of the Andromeda Strain, H.G. Wells, Biblical figures, but mostly Dr. Seuss's ""The Sneetches"".  (The star bellied Sneetches had bellies with stars; the plain bellied Sneetches had none upon thar's"").  That's basically the whole premise - Do you want a star or not?  Is having a star better than not?

(Natasha Gregson Wagner - daughter of Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner - guests)Try the Pie - Tom finds out that Kyle is positive and Kyle flees to Collier's Evanston, a town where everyone is promicin positive.The Marked - A film director has the ability to make acturate pictures about real life consiracies. But his latest film The Marked is too hot.Till We Have Built Jerusalem - Collier's followers move to Seattle and build Promise City.No Exit - NTAC is in shut down with Tom, Diana, Megan, Shawn, Kyle, Jordan, Isabelle, Maia, PJ, Marco and Brady.  But no one has any recollection of how they got there.  And even worse, the building seems to have a deadly mind of its own.Daddy's Little Girl - Richard kidnaps his daughter Isabelle in hopes of starting a new life with her.One of Us - NTAC is pressured to bring in Richard and Isabelle.  Burkoff develops a test to determine who will be able to take promicin.  Tom has a dream about the 4400.

To be honest, I am a few episodes off finishing the series because I can't bring myself to sit through the show anymore. And I bought this DVD over a year ago. I used to love this show but this season definitely slipped in narrative quality. I would recommend you buy this to add to your collection of 4400 DVD's if the price is good because the first half isn't so bad but you will notice your interest rapidly declines by the final disc possibly mostly due to character inconsistencies.I'll be generous and give it a 5/10, although I am saddened to do so as it was once my favourite show.",2,"Slightly disappointing,",1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,715,"['Still', 'great', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'noticed', 'slip', 'storyline', 'dialogue', 'quality', 'season', 'be', 'honest', 'am', 'few', 'episodes', 'finishing', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'sit', 'show', 'anymore', 'bought', 'DVD', 'year', 'ago', 'used', 'love', 'show', 'season', 'definitely', 'slipped', 'narrative', 'quality', 'would', 'recommend', 'buy', 'add', 'collection', '4400', 'DVD', 'price', 'good', 'first', 'half', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'will', 'notice', 'interest', 'rapidly', 'declines', 'final', 'disc', 'possibly', 'mostly', 'due', 'character', 'inconsistencies.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'generous', 'give', '5/10', 'am', 'saddened', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'once', 'favourite', 'show']",The 4400: Season 4

PAYNE ""taikutsuna""","[7, 7]","The title of this review may make it sound like I hated this show... not so, I found it far more enjoyable than the glut of cheaply made ""Reality"" shows that are flooding the network programming. I cancelled my Cable after this show was cancelled, due to the irresponsible way networks have been cancelling show after show that I enjoy (Dead like me, Serenity, Angel, Wonderfalls, Joey, Dark angel... add infinitum)with no Viable conclusion. It's like a constant slap in the face to invest a couple years in a show just to have it cancelled because the writers have written themselves into a corner.I still watch all the shows I like, I just wait until they're on DVD and rent them from Netflix. I can then watch the entire show's run in a couple weekends and I don't have to see a single commercial.This show was just starting to get really poignant with the new story arcs they opened up, but when they just cancelled it for no reason. I turned to alternatives. I doubt that the networks care that I cancelled my cable, but hopefully enough people will get tired of the networks thumbing their noses at them and follow suit. I understand the need to cancel shows, just do it responsibly. The shows are the network's product. If I continually received imcomplete products from a store, I would no longer shop there. It doesn't have to be a good conclusion, just some closure... Joss Whedon understands this better than anyone. Fox prematurly cancelled Firefly, so Joss made a movie and tied  almost everything up. The same thing happened with Stargate Sg-1. ((Networks, pay attention: If you want people to continue to buy your products, quit slapping your customers in the face!)) That's my rant... I leave the fight in your capable hands, because I no longer care what the networks do. Fight the good fight and cancel your cable.",5,The reason I cancelled my cable service.,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,1832,"['title', 'review', 'may', 'make', 'hated', 'show', 'not', 'found', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'glut', 'cheaply', 'made', 'Reality', 'are', 'flooding', 'network', 'programming', 'cancelled', 'Cable', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'due', 'irresponsible', 'way', 'networks', 'have', 'been', 'cancelling', 'show', 'show', 'enjoy', 'Dead', 'Serenity', 'Angel', 'Wonderfalls', 'Joey', 'Dark', 'angel', 'add', 'infinitum', 'Viable', 'conclusion', 'constant', 'slap', 'face', 'invest', 'couple', 'years', 'show', 'just', 'have', 'cancelled', 'writers', 'have', 'written', 'corner.I', 'still', 'watch', 'shows', 'like', 'just', 'wait', ""'re"", 'DVD', 'rent', 'Netflix', 'can', 'then', 'watch', 'entire', 'show', 'run', 'couple', 'weekends', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'single', 'commercial.This', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'get', 'really', 'poignant', 'new', 'story', 'opened', 'up', 'when', 'just', 'cancelled', 'reason', 'turned', 'alternatives', 'doubt', 'networks', 'care', 'cancelled', 'cable', 'hopefully', 'enough', 'people', 'will', 'get', 'tired', 'networks', 'thumbing', 'noses', 'follow', 'suit', 'understand', 'need', 'cancel', 'shows', 'just', 'do', 'responsibly', 'shows', 'are', 'network', 'product', 'continually', 'received', 'imcomplete', 'products', 'store', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'shop', 'there', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'good', 'conclusion', 'just', 'closure', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'better', 'anyone', 'Fox', 'prematurly', 'cancelled', 'Firefly', 'so', 'Joss', 'made', 'movie', 'tied', 'almost', 'everything', 'up', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Stargate', 'Sg-1', 'Networks', 'pay', 'attention', 'want', 'people', 'continue', 'buy', 'products', 'quit', 'slapping', 'customers', 'face', 'rant', 'leave', 'fight', 'capable', 'hands', 'no', 'longer', 'care', 'what', 'networks', 'do', 'Fight', 'good', 'fight', 'cancel', 'cable']",The 4400: Season 4

Also, smart twist with having Tom turn bad as a Marked.  Clever stories and cliff-hangers also kept the interest even though the plot twisted around and around causing some loss of focus.  Until, that is, the final episode, when the writers brought it all together, and perhaps not planned as the series finale, still managed to provide a fitting and satisfying ending.
