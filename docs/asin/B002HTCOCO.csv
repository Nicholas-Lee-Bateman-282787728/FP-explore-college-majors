KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[1, 1]","Godzilla 16 or the rebirth of Godzilla or Godzilla 1985 is probably closer to the original in tone than any other Godzilla film. Godzilla is the enemy, he doesn't fight other giant monsters and Raymond Burr is in it (U.S. version).Finding this on DVD is somewhat tough. There are several burned versions around and I've had a chance to view a couple of different releases. Sumogorilla sells several Godzilla films that are pretty tough to find. The Return of Godzilla DVD they sell comes as a 2 disc version. One with the Japanese version running 1:43 minutes an U.S. version running 1:27 as you can see by the running time these are very different cuts. The video and sound quality are really quite good. The case has a picture similar to the one listed here, but the discs have no graphics( at least mine don't have any).Back to the film, this is a good entry in the series even if it seems out of place. Considering this was supposed to be the new improved Godzilla they effects aren't really that much different than the other films. All in all I'm glad I was able to purchase the missing link to my collection until a proper release comes along.",4,SUMOGORILLA RELEASE INCLUDES BOTH JAPANESE AND U.S. VERSIONS ON SEPARATE DISCS!

Worlds better than the hacked up ""Godzilla 1985"" they rolled out with Raymond Burr. I really enjoy locating and viewing the original versions of my favorite Japanese monster movies from when I was a boy. Even though I can't speak Japanese, hearing the dialog instead of  horrible mistranslations really adds to my enjoyment. I'm very pleased to have found this DVD on Amazon. 100% recommended for monster movie buffs.",5,Wonderful Japanese version of Godzilla 1984,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,519,"['stiff', 'dated', 'looking', 'places', 'plot', 'there', 'loads', 'wonderful', 'special', 'effects', 'Worlds', 'better', 'hacked', 'Godzilla', '1985', 'rolled', 'out', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'really', 'enjoy', 'locating', 'viewing', 'original', 'versions', 'favorite', 'Japanese', 'monster', 'movies', 'when', 'was', 'boy', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Japanese', 'hearing', 'dialog', 'instead', 'horrible', 'mistranslations', 'really', 'enjoyment', ""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'have', 'found', 'DVD', 'Amazon', '100', '%', 'recommended', 'monster', 'movie', 'buffs']",N/A

1268915,A2JG0Z691ZEC5,B002HTCOCO,The Dark Knight,"[12, 12]","The DVD is a burnt copy of the Japanese version of ""Godzilla"" with English subtitles. The American dub isn't a part of this DVD, but that is all right seeing that the Japanese version is superior. Granted, if you hate subtitles, you may not want to consider buying.Some people have complained about the transfer. Really, I think it's fabulous! It's as good as you're going to find when you purchase any other DVD. The disc is really nice in that it's decorated professionally and not with some cheap sticker. There are no menus so the film starts up right away. At the end there is a nice making-of featurette which is really nice!All in all, this is a great buy considering we still don't have the American version available to us in the States.
