The President and First Lady of the United States lose their dear dogand wonder how to get him back, without a big media circus.Enter a little boy in a foster home far away trying to find someone to love him.Such a story could get sickly sentimental in many movies, but not in this gem. Avu liked it just as much as we did, and she often ignores our favorite flicks.It is well done and draws you in to a story that feels good. Forget about a the fanciful plot twists. This movie will bring a few tears to your eyes, and if you have a dog to pet, all for the better.If you do not, it may prompt you to check with the local dog rescue facility and maybe wind up with a very special addition to your home.

This story of an orphan in a foster home,who faces some serious issues about losing people you love, right and wrong, strangers, knowing who to trust...not those that say &#34;trust me&#34;...but those whose actions prove they are worthy to be trusted.Even so the movie doesn't come off as preachy, or try to force feed you beliefs.The movie's script is far-fetched, in that a child finds the President's dog in California and no one will believe him that this IS the President's dog; so the boy decides to take the dog home to the President. BUT the acting is VERY good...even the dog, and the story sticks together, and gives a nice resolution, so that you don't feel left hanging. The first half of the movie the script was drama/adventure, then about half way through, you can see the film adding an attempt at being a comedy for a younger audience with &#34;men in black&#34; and &#34;bad guy situations&#34; that are not of the same caliber as the rest of the movie...but not so out of sync that you become distracted from the goals of the movie, and feeling entertained when the movie is over.",4,"Good acting, good story, good morals.
