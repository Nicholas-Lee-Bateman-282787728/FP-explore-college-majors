22933,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,076785117X,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 7]","With a cast that includes Bette Midler, Danny DeVito, Jamie Lee Curtis and Will Ferrell, not to mention Casey Affleck and Neve Campbell, you'd kind of expect this movie to be good, or at least funny.It's not.In fact, `Drowning Mona' is far from either of those things.  It is confusing, annoying, obnoxious, boring, forgettable and insulting.  I've never gotten up so many times during a movie to leave a room, hoping I'd find something else to occupy my time.  I just can't really think of a single redeeming factor here.  It appears, from the reviews on this site, that you either love this movie or you absolutely hate it.  I hate it.  It is possibly the worst of the decade (although I am still convinced that honor goes to `Blood Diamond').And this is sad, because I adore most of the actors involved in this film.The film is told in a hodgepodge of flashbacks as Mona's death is investigated by Chief Wyatt Rash.  The film opens with Mona dying in a car accident.  The town is pretty happy about this, but Rash sets out to solve her death (or murder).I don't even really want to bother.I'd stay away from this one.  It falls flat in nearly every area in my opinion, but others seem to love this so what do I know.  Personally, if you like the cast I recommend checking out some of their `better' work, like `Isn't She Great', `Throw Mamma From The Train', `True Lies', `Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby', `...Jesse James...' and `Wild Things'.",1,This one is all wet...,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,1460,"['cast', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'not', 'mention', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Neve', 'Campbell', ""'d"", 'kind', 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'good', 'least', 'funny.It', 'not.In', 'fact', 'Drowning', 'Mona', 'far', 'things', 'confusing', 'annoying', 'obnoxious', 'boring', 'forgettable', 'insulting', ""'ve"", 'never', 'gotten', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'leave', 'room', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'find', 'something', 'else', 'occupy', 'time', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'single', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'here', 'reviews', 'site', 'love', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'hate', 'possibly', 'worst', 'decade', 'am', 'still', 'convinced', 'honor', 'Blood', 'Diamond', '.And', 'sad', 'adore', 'most', 'actors', 'involved', 'film.The', 'film', 'told', 'hodgepodge', 'flashbacks', 'Mona', 'death', 'investigated', 'Chief', 'Wyatt', 'Rash', 'film', 'Mona', 'dying', 'car', 'accident', 'town', 'pretty', 'happy', 'Rash', 'out', 'solve', 'death', 'murder', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'want', 'bother.I', ""'d"", 'stay', 'away', 'one', 'flat', 'nearly', 'area', 'opinion', 'others', 'seem', 'love', 'so', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'Personally', 'like', 'cast', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'better', 'work', 'Is', ""n't"", 'Great', 'Throw', 'Mamma', 'Train', 'True', 'Lies', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'Ballad', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Wild', 'Things']",N/A

In the town  lives Mona Dearly played by the divine miss M or Bette Midler who everybody  hates. But when her car is sabtaged she drives off a cliff. But when the  towns local sheriff played by Danny Devito sets to find the killer actually  all the people just want to know who to thank for killing her. That is the  entire premise of Drowning Mona.But what a misguided mess. First of all  Bette Midler is only seen through flashbacks but no one is actually funny.  Director Nick Gomez should have kept a closer eye on things before they got  all out of hand. Casey Affleck is accused of killing Mona and his bride to  be played by Neve Campbell leaves him. But what director Gomez does right  is get some very funny cracks about Yugos and some very funny performances  from William Fichtner who plays the cheating mumbuling husbsand who is  cheating on a local waitress played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Casey Affleck  as the would be killer is to innocent to even be considered.

As soon as I finished watching it I rushed it back to the store  before it started stinking up my house. ""Drowning Mona"" is a really bad  film that went wrong well before filming ever began. The premise is a good  one, but the script is awful. Bette Midler plays an evil woman hated by  everyone in the small town she lives in, including her own family. After  she meets an untimely demise, the good-hearted sheriff, played by Danny  Devito, must try and figure out who had the best motive to kill her.  This  film is supposed to be a dark comedy, and never delivers on either point.  The bit about everyone in town driving a Yugo gets old about 30 minutes in,  and from there you will find very little to laugh at.

Mona (Bette Midler) is about as abrasive and disgusting a human  being as one could imagine.  When Mona drives her son's car off a cliff  into the river, no one (including her family) is at all distressed; no one,  that is, except Chief Rash (Danny DeVito) who suspects foul play.  As he  goes about his investigation, we are treated to a slice of life in a weird  town where everyone drives Yugos, and inhabited by bizarre people most of  whom hate each other.This is basically a dark slapstick sitcom that  falls flat all too often.  DeVito plays the straight man in a comedy  without a real comedian.  Marcus Thomas, who plays Jeff, is probably the  funniest character in the film due to his sheer stupidity.  Jamie Lee  Curtis is also amusing as an oversexed waitress who is sleeping with two  men and suspects that either one of them might have murdered Mona.  Neve  Campbell plays the ditzy but lovable daughter of Chief Rash in a delightful  departure from her recent roles.  After playing a dour and paranoid Sidney  in Scream 3, this was a welcome change.  She clearly had a lot more fun  with this role.  Bette Midler was deliciously evil as the witch.  Casey  Affleck (brother of Ben Affleck) proves with his lifeless performance that  acting ability is not necessarily genetic.This film had a number of good  elements that it couldn't manage to pull together.

My own experience with DROWNING MONA was as mixed as the reviews below (and elsewhere).  Call it ""filmus interruptus,"" but I watched about half of the movie before I was sidetracked into doing something else.  And for that first half, I found myself going along with the movie's black comedy and bleak vision of smalltown life.  I understood, certainly, why so many people hated it, and I could sense that, yes, it was straining a bit too hard to be quirky.  But I went with that and was able to enjoy it for what it was.But spreading my viewing over the course of two days wound up spoiling it for me.  By the time I got back to it, I could no longer get into it.  The cast gamely tries to pull it off (and it is an impressive line-up, to be sure--Midler, DeVito, and Curtis are all comic veterans, and the younger crew, including Neve Campbell, Casey Affleck and Marcus Thomas acquit themselves well.  But smalltown quirkiness has been done much better.  Not everyone can be the Coen Brothers, of course, or even the Farrellys.

On the other hand, if you enjoy outrageously black comedy, sit back, turn up the volume a little higher than usual to catch some of the very witty one-liners and enjoy.Bette Midler is a nightmare come true. A small-town shrew whom everyone hates. Thus it takes only a few scenes to set up the cheering section as she gets into her son's car, roars off down the road, hits the brakes to slow for a turn . . . and plunges over a cliff when the brakes fail. Not only does no one care about Mona's fate, but one of Police Chief Danny DeVito's cops says to forget about it when DeVito suggests an investigation.The probable suspect is none other than Affleck, who is to become DeVito's son-in-law within a matter of days.The movie now becomes Agatha Christie on steroids or worse as DeVito tries to find out who sabotaged Midler's brakes. No one is unhappy that Midler is gone. Not her son, not her husband, not her husband's lover, the town eccentric or anyone else. Mona was not well liked. Of course, just about everyone is a suspect.Sure, the plot has as much thickness as a shirtboard. But the writing is witty and bright and the acting by DeVito, Midler, Jamie Lee Curtis, Affleck and everyone else is top-notch.Pure and simple, this is a fun movie, a black comedy that never takes itself seriously, but is well directed and well measured.

Danny Devito, Bette Midler, Jamie Lee Curtis, Neve Campbell, they all turn in deserving performances. It's the plot that has a few problems. The movie starts off with Mona Dearly (Bette Midler) driving away in her son's car, the brakes have been cut and Mona dies going over a cliff. Mona Dearly was a hated woman, and the question isn't who did it, but who wouldn't do it? The whole town hated her. So through flashbacks we see Mona, and how she interacted with the characters. It is a funny movie, but very slow paced. As well its a bit predictable, I knew who killed Mona long before it was explored in the movie. However there is a bit of a mystery, and intrigue here with the title. Mona Dearly is an anagram for Only A Dream, so perhaps the events unfold in the movie as if it were a dream. Still the plot left a bit to be desired, but the acting was excellent. Another small complaint is, it would have been nice to seen the Divine Miss M in more scenes than she was, her talents were not truly utilized in this film, but she gave a solid performance overall.",3,Only A Dream - Mona Dearly,1044489600,"02 6, 2003",2003,1200,"['DROWNING', 'MONA', 'intersting', 'movie', 'say', 'least', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'unfortunately', 'Wonderful', 'cast', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'turn', 'deserving', 'performances', 'plot', 'few', 'problems', 'movie', 'Mona', 'Dearly', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'driving', 'away', 'son', 'car', 'brakes', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'Mona', 'going', 'cliff', 'Mona', 'Dearly', 'was', 'hated', 'woman', 'question', ""n't"", 'who', 'did', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'town', 'hated', 'flashbacks', 'see', 'Mona', 'how', 'interacted', 'characters', 'funny', 'movie', 'very', 'slow', 'paced', 'As', 'well', 'bit', 'predictable', 'knew', 'who', 'killed', 'Mona', 'long', 'was', 'explored', 'movie', 'However', 'bit', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'here', 'title', 'Mona', 'Dearly', 'anagram', 'Only', 'A', 'Dream', 'so', 'perhaps', 'events', 'unfold', 'movie', 'were', 'dream', 'Still', 'plot', 'left', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'small', 'complaint', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'seen', 'Divine', 'Miss', 'M', 'more', 'scenes', 'was', 'talents', 'were', 'not', 'truly', 'utilized', 'film', 'gave', 'solid', 'performance', 'overall']",N/A

22954,A2DSXA1E02C86D,076785117X,Joseph Haschka,"[1, 6]","DROWNING MONA begins with the on-screen message that the fictional town in the film, Verplanck, NY, was selected as a test market for the Yugo automobile. That's why everybody seems to drive them - old ones. It says a lot about the film that this is one of its more amusing aspects.Mona is Mona Dearly, played by Bette Midler, a hateful gorgon of a woman who drowns when her car (a Yugo, naturally) plummets off a cliff into the Hudson River. After it's discovered that the vehicle's brake fluid has been drained and the brake lines cut, Verplanck's Police Chief Rash, portrayed by Danny DeVito, astutely smells murder. Unfortunately, there are too many individuals who might have wished the hellcat dead: her son Jeff, her husband Phil, her son's and husband's lover Rona (played by Jamie Lee Curtis),  Rash's daughter Ellen, and her son's business partner Bobby (also Ellen's fianc&eacute;). To give you an idea of Mona's temperament, she may have severed her son's hand from his arm with a cleaver as he was reaching for her beer. At least, that's one story circulating about town to explain his lost appendage.Only the chief's daughter, Ellen, is anywhere near being an attractive persona in this relatively un-comic black comedy. DeVito, who can usually be counted upon to elicit some guffaws, has a remarkably straight and sober role. Curtis is downright unattractive as the promiscuous waitress. Phil, Jeff and Bobby are three of the most forgettable characters ever to adorn the silver screen.Of course, Rash unties the Gordion Knot at the end, and justice is served. But, by that time, I didn't care in the slightest. To be evenhanded, I do recall chuckling maybe twice during the film. I just wish I could remember about what, so I could tell you, dear reader. It was certainly not when Jeff and Bobby, co-owners of failing landscaping business, quarrel over losing a customer because Jeff had purposely run over the client's dog with a power lawnmower. Or, when Mona smacks Phil with an iron frying pan.

If not, then the people hired to work on it were either blackmailed or drugged into signing up. Those are the only two plausible explanations for the waste of considerable talent in this inept and, worse yet, unfunny comedy.Everyone in this upstate New York town drives a Hugo because the place was picked as a test market back in 1974. Hugos are no longer manufactured and, apparently, in this town, neither are decent paying jobs, since everyone still drives these ratty little cars. Surely there was supposed to be a joke in this plot setup, but no one remembered to write the punch line.As the movie opens, the town terror, Mona Dearly [Bette Midler], is preparing to go somewhere in her Hugo. She makes it as far as a guardrail and plunges into a local lake. It turns out that her brakes were tampered with, and Chief Nash [Danny DeVito] now has a homicide on his hands. It doesn't help the investigation that all 400 inhabitants of the town are delighted that Mona is gone. About 100 of these people had a motive for murder. Bobby and Ellen [Casey Affleck and Neve Campbell], a young couple in love, both have motives. To compound the problem, Ellen is Chief Nash's daughter. Perhaps it is waitress Rona [Jamie Lee Curtis] who is having affairs with Phil and Jeff Dearly [William Fitchner and Marcus Thomas, Mona's husband and son respectively. Neither Dad nor Phil is aware of the other's involvement with Rona. All three have a good motive. In the end, though, it is nearly the entire audience that has reason to want to kill this movie.Since Bette Midler's character is killed in the movie's first 90 seconds, we see her only occasionally in flashbacks. This is a grave mistake because only when Midler in on screen does the movie start to light up. Danny DeVito can play it straight or play it funny. Here is plays it only straight, which is another mistake, for he is allowed to provide no comic relief. The director Nick Gomez is a distinguished TV director, whose credits include Homicide, as well as HBO's The Sopranos And Oz. Perhaps he does not work in the comedy genre, but it's more likely he was given little, if anything, to work with.Much of the time I watch movies at home alone. In this case I watched Drowning Mona with two friends. It is hard to make me laugh, which does not mean I don't have a sense of humor. My friends love to laugh. They frequently fall over from it.

The movie is populated with characters who are hard to like; we find ourselves laughing along both at and with them, but it kind of makes you feel a little inhuman yourself.Bette Midler, looking worse than ever, plays the titular character who gets offed in the beginning of the movie.  Via flashbacks, we see a character who is so despicable, self-centered and heartless, that one wonders how she's survived this long.  With no redeeming qualities, it's hard to worry about who killed her.  The writers did throw in one key scene at a knife throwing contest where we get some inkling of what makes Mona tick.  But even that's not enough to give us any sympathy for her demise.  Her own husband and son could care less; in fact, they're grateful too.  The movie is basically a one-joke premise given life by some wonderful bits by its players.  Danny DeVito uncharacteristically underplays his role as the police chief; it's ironic considering the ferocity he gave his previous role with Midler in RUTHLESS PEOPLE.  Sadly, the talented Midler doesn't look the least bit interested in her role.  Neve Campbell and Jamie Lee Curtis, both talented actresses, try gamely but their characters are so cliche, one isn't impressed with their performances, although Curtis does have some funny moments with William Fichtner and Marcus Thomas.  These two gentlemen are very good in their roles as Mona's husband and son, given the fact they are so unlikeable.  Casey Affleck,looking a lot like Shaun Cassidy, is all moony-eyed but is good in letting his darker side out.The movie is fascinating in its unabashed cruelty, and it has a wonderful background score including a host of songs by Three Dog Night.  It's also funny seeing so many Yugos at one time, but one knows that a Yugo could never squeal tires in a car chase.Dark and callous, DROWNING MONA will nevertheless keep you interested due to its fascinating premise.",3,PITCH BLACK COMEDY,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,2015,"['have', 'been', 'countless', 'dark', 'comedies', 'years', 'DROWNING', 'MONA', 'one', 'darkest', 'movie', 'populated', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'hard', 'like', 'find', 'laughing', 'kind', 'feel', 'little', 'inhuman', 'yourself.Bette', 'Midler', 'looking', 'worse', 'ever', 'titular', 'character', 'who', 'offed', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Via', 'flashbacks', 'see', 'character', 'who', 'so', 'despicable', 'self-centered', 'heartless', 'one', 'how', 'survived', 'long', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'hard', 'worry', 'who', 'killed', 'writers', 'did', 'throw', 'one', 'key', 'scene', 'knife', 'throwing', 'contest', 'where', 'get', 'inkling', 'what', 'Mona', 'tick', 'even', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'sympathy', 'demise', 'own', 'husband', 'son', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'fact', ""'re"", 'grateful', 'too', 'movie', 'basically', 'one-joke', 'premise', 'given', 'life', 'wonderful', 'bits', 'players', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'uncharacteristically', 'role', 'police', 'chief', 'ironic', 'considering', 'ferocity', 'gave', 'previous', 'role', 'Midler', 'RUTHLESS', 'PEOPLE', 'Sadly', 'talented', 'Midler', ""n't"", 'look', 'least', 'bit', 'interested', 'role', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'talented', 'actresses', 'try', 'gamely', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'cliche', 'one', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'performances', 'Curtis', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'Marcus', 'Thomas', 'two', 'gentlemen', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'Mona', 'husband', 'son', 'given', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'unlikeable', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'looking', 'lot', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'moony-eyed', 'good', 'letting', 'darker', 'side', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'unabashed', 'cruelty', 'wonderful', 'background', 'score', 'including', 'host', 'songs', 'Three', 'Dog', 'Night', 'also', 'funny', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'Yugos', 'one', 'time', 'one', 'Yugo', 'could', 'never', 'squeal', 'tires', 'car', 'chase.Dark', 'callous', 'DROWNING', 'MONA', 'will', 'nevertheless', 'keep', 'interested', 'due', 'fascinating', 'premise']",N/A

You get ""Drowning Mona,"" a lame comedy directed (and I  use the term loosely) by Nick Gomez.  Mona Dearly (Bette Midler) is the  most hated and despised person in town, apparently by everyone including  her husband, Phil (William Fichtner), and her son, Jeff (Marcus Thomas).  She's mean, vicious, and lacking of even a single redeeming quality.  One  day her car goes off a cliff into a lake, and she drowns.  Was it an  accident, or has a crime been committed?  It's up to Police Chief Wyatt  Rash (Danny DeVito) to get to the bottom of it all, which shouldn't be too  hard to do since this whole movie hits bottom practically from the opening  credits.  Beside the fact that this film just isn't funny (which does  not bode well for a comedy), there isn't a sympathetic character to be  found; everyone involved in this is pretty much just as despicable as Mona  herself.  The title of this movie should have been ""Drown Them All.""  Jamie Lee Curtis (Rona Cale, the white trash waitress with an eye for Phil  Dearly) fares better than the rest here, which is something, given the fact  that she's at a loss for anyone or anything substantial to play off of.  She'd be better off, still, if she could somehow expunge this one from her  resume.  The usually reliable DeVito walks through his part as if he never  really got a handle on his character, or quite figured out just exactly how  or where Rash was supposed to fit into this whole mess, aside from merely  being a tool with which to move the plot along.  And Midler, with a proven  track record for comedy, simply takes her Mona too far.  For comedy to  work, even the most blatant miscreant has to offer at least a hint of  humanity, buried deep though it may be (Like Belushi, in ""Animal House,"" or  Dangerfield in ""Caddyshack""); Mona lacks even a trace.  The rest of the  cast, which includes Neve Campbell (Ellen Rash), Casey Affleck (Bobby  Calzone), Peter Dobson (Feege) and Will Ferrell (Cubby), can rest easy on  one account:  After this debacle, there's nowhere to go but up.

I don't want to remember this movie, and I wish it would have been better.Well, if you're still with me on this review, then let me explain the story. Mona, played by Bette Midler is off on a normal leisurly drive when she is headed towards a cliff and her brakes stop working, so she plunges off to her death. I thought it was kind of sick, and that started the movie off badly for me. After people realize she's dead, most of the people are actually happy because they hated her so much. Now, it may be regular for people to hate each other, but most people would not be happy when someone close to them died, even if they did not like them.

You're not meant for this amazing gem of satire, but for those of you like me, who appreciate what makes things different in life, you people will understand. Regardless of Yugos and Wheel of Fortune references, there is much to love about Drowning Mona. Mona (played fabulously by Bette Midler, and trust me, watching this movie is worth it for her performance alone) is a mean, horrible woman that the whole small town she lives in hates for varying reasons (and you'll see them, all incredibly funny). She takes a drive one day only to run off the road, straight off a cliff and right into her death. But her husband Phil (William Fichtner) and her son Jeff don't seem all that bothered by her death. Nor does anyone else in the town. In fact, everyone's elated that she's gone. But the police chief (Danny Devito) is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery no matter what. Drowning Mona also features great performances from Neve Campbell, Casey Affleck and Jamie Lee Curtis. Drowning Mona is at the top of my list of favorite movies. It is not for everyone though, so if you're one of those people who need shiny-happy-Hollywood to consider it a good movie, you've been warned.

One of the biggest flaws of the film was the lack  of character development for Mona.  She only appeared on screen for a  couple of minutes at the beggining , and we the viewer are forced to  despise her, even though we know nothing about this seemingly terrible  woman.  They should have devoted the first 30 minutes of the film exploring  Mona's life, giving her a personality.  Make us hate her!  To me, Mona  really wasn't that honry of a person.  She just seemed to be on the rag.Bette Midler underacted, the actor playing her son way overacted, Neve  Campbell curses every movie she appears in, Danny Devito looked paralized  and embarassed to reel of his dialogue, with nothing to work off with the  other actors.  Which leaves me with Jamie Lee Curtis, who actually tried to  give this movie some depth, and Casey Affleck, the only believable  character in the entire film.  He added some much needed life to this  comotose comedy.  All of the jokes in Drowning Mona were so tired and  played out, it was ridiculous to watch.  The Yugo thing got really old,  real quick.  What this movie needs is a re-write, a total make-over.  What  were the writers so afraid of?  Here they have an intriguing premise that  reaks with potential, but instead we get Bette Midler running around in  circles with a frying pan screaming &quot;you're playin' wheel of fortune  with somebody else!!!!!!&quot;  How original.  I think the white trash  pyscho mama  has already been done enough, remember Kathy Bates in  Misery?I thought Bette Midler could pull it off, but she failed  miserably this time.  The actor who played her son should seek a new  career, his acting was horrendous. Whenever it was his turn to  &quot;act&quot;  I had to look away from the screen , it was that  embarassing to watch.

22978,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,076785117X,wellwellwell,"[24, 29]","It will go without saying five minutes into this movie that it is unlike any other movie you've seen.  This sometimes dark, sometimes slapstick, sometimes subtle comedy boasts one of the most intriguing casts to date.  There are a number of recognizable faces, Danny DeVito, Bette Midler, Jamie Lee Curtis (to name a few), that brighten up the screen just that much.  But to be honest, it was the roles played by Casey Affleck, Marcus Thomas, and William Fichtner especially that made `Drowning Mona' so enjoyable for me.  The movie itself goes back and forth between present time and flashbacks containing moments of a living Mona Dearly, who dies rather abruptly at the very beginning of the film.  I think too many people say the plot it predictable.  I was more than entertained for the entire movie and I never actually KNEW who actually killed Mona.  Sure I had my predictions, and who doesn't.  The point is that the movie's very funny and actually quite smart.Once we see Mona Dearly fly over a cliff in a car, the sense of craziness sets in.  Your basic human instincts will at first allow you to feel bad for Mona (I hope).  But once you see every person in town partying and laughing over her ""timely"" death, you can't help but play along.  The part where Jeff, Mona's son played by Marcus Thomas, asks the police why Mona was driving his car while popping open a beer is absolutely priceless!  The main characters in the film are Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck) and Chief Rash (DeVito).  Chief Rash is the only person in town who cares about Mona's death.  Well, maybe it's more that it's his job than he really cares.  Heck, even his co-workers could care less.  Bobby also (kind of) feels sorry for Mona, but is allowed to laugh and enjoy the situation thanks to his fianc&eacute; Ellen (Neve Campbell).  So for most of the movie, Rash just drives around in his Geo--take note of the opening disclaimer--and asks townies questions about what kind of person Mona truly was.  The responses are all hilarious.  I could go into great detail with almost 50 different quotes or scenes that back up the fact that Mona Dearly was a horrible person who deserved to die.  But I just don't have the time.  You really have to hear/see them to believe it.  As I hinted to, William Fichtner's performance as Phil Dearly is hands down the best.  He plays the ill-fated-but-happily-sorrowing-over-the-worst-person-he'd-ever-met husband.  He is a very suspicious character, and seems to know something that no one else does.  He puts the blame on Bobby Calzone, who is one of the most harmless people you could ever meet.  What makes this particularly interesting is that Bobby is the future son-in-law of Chief Rash.  So that is very hard for Rash, and us, the viewer, to believe.  `Drowning Mona' is pretty much a ""whodunit"" movie with a twist that makes you laugh and think at the same time.  I guess I can't rebuff the fact that the storyline becomes predictable over time.  And that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  But you'll still be impressed with the shifts between past and present and definitely the comedy.  There's also an excellent cameo from former SNL star Will Ferrell.  I won't spoil the rest.If you enjoy Danny DeVito's work and/or a good comedy with bizarre twists, then you will love `Drowning Mona'.  The acting by everyone is unquestionably flawless; and the only thing that doesn't excite is its ill-timed predictability.  Once more, take special note of William Fichtner and Marcus Thomas.  Being that they are the ""family members"" makes it just that much funnier.  There's really no other movies available that are comparable to this one.  And that's certainly a good thing for some.  But if you dwell in straightforwardness and don't appreciate the idea of thinking, you might not enjoy this one.  It's crazy, it's hilarious, it's silly, it's well thought-out, but most importantly it's time well spent.  I highly recommend this to anyone who'd enjoy an innovative comedy or likes any of the actors or actresses in the cast list.
