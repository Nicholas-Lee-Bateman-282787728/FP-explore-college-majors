832462,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0002F6AJI,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[44, 64]","Fast paced and riveting, this is one of the best Showtime productions I've seen, and certainly the most moving, and is an excellent dramatization of 9/11 from the perspective of the Bush Administration, and chronicles the events that were taken from that fateful day to the president's speech to congress on September 20th.The actors are marvelous, and convincing in their parts not just because of any physical similarities, but more impressive are the speech patterns and body language that are so like the people they are portraying.Timothy Bottoms is terrific as President Bush, with his mix of toughness and sentiment, and the subtle variations from the halting, insecure first talk to the nation which is perfectly replicated, to the strong and affecting episode at Ground Zero. Other memorable performances come from John Cunningham as Donald Rumsfeld, Lawrence Pressman: Dick Cheney, Mary Gordon Murray: Laura Bush, Penny Johnson: Condi Rice, Gerry Mendicino: George Tenet, Allan Royal: Karl Rove, Scott Alan Smith: Ari Fleischer, Carolyn Scott: Karen Hughes, Andrew Gillies: Tony Blair, Stephen Macht: Paul Wolfowitz, and Gregory Itzin is stupendous as John Ashcroft.Written and produced by Lionel Chetwynd, and directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith, this is respectful and accurate, and has actual footage of the events cleverly interspersed with the dramatic interpretation. The scene from the National Cathedral on September 14th, and the final section at the Capitol are particularly well edited.As a political junkie and C-SPAN addict, I found this to be a faithful and meticulous telling of the horror of 9/11, and our response to the faceless hate that is terrorism, and it is refreshing to see a film that shows respect for the office of the president.Way above average cable production; total running time is 128 minutes.May we never forget 9/11, and God bless the brave souls who fight for our freedom.",5,"""we're fighting a state of mind""",1091664000,"08 5, 2004",2004,1917,"['Fast', 'paced', 'riveting', 'one', 'best', 'Showtime', 'productions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'certainly', 'most', 'moving', 'excellent', 'dramatization', '9/11', 'perspective', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'events', 'were', 'taken', 'fateful', 'day', 'president', 'speech', 'congress', 'September', '20th.The', 'actors', 'are', 'marvelous', 'convincing', 'parts', 'not', 'just', 'physical', 'similarities', 'more', 'impressive', 'are', 'speech', 'patterns', 'body', 'language', 'are', 'so', 'people', 'are', 'portraying.Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'terrific', 'President', 'Bush', 'mix', 'toughness', 'sentiment', 'subtle', 'variations', 'halting', 'insecure', 'first', 'talk', 'nation', 'perfectly', 'replicated', 'strong', 'affecting', 'episode', 'Ground', 'Zero', 'Other', 'memorable', 'performances', 'come', 'John', 'Cunningham', 'Donald', 'Rumsfeld', 'Lawrence', 'Pressman', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'Mary', 'Gordon', 'Murray', 'Laura', 'Bush', 'Penny', 'Johnson', 'Condi', 'Rice', 'Gerry', 'Mendicino', 'George', 'Tenet', 'Allan', 'Royal', 'Karl', 'Rove', 'Scott', 'Alan', 'Smith', 'Ari', 'Fleischer', 'Carolyn', 'Scott', 'Karen', 'Hughes', 'Andrew', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Stephen', 'Macht', 'Paul', 'Wolfowitz', 'Gregory', 'Itzin', 'stupendous', 'John', 'Ashcroft.Written', 'produced', 'Lionel', 'Chetwynd', 'directed', 'Brian', 'Trenchard-Smith', 'respectful', 'accurate', 'actual', 'footage', 'events', 'cleverly', 'interspersed', 'dramatic', 'interpretation', 'scene', 'National', 'Cathedral', 'September', '14th', 'final', 'section', 'Capitol', 'are', 'particularly', 'well', 'edited.As', 'political', 'junkie', 'C-SPAN', 'addict', 'found', 'be', 'faithful', 'meticulous', 'telling', 'horror', '9/11', 'response', 'faceless', 'hate', 'terrorism', 'refreshing', 'see', 'film', 'respect', 'office', 'president.Way', 'average', 'cable', 'production', 'total', 'running', 'time', '128', 'minutes.May', 'never', 'forget', '9/11', 'God', 'bless', 'brave', 'souls', 'who', 'fight', 'freedom']",DC 9/11 - Time of Crisis
832463,A282A0P69UT137,B0002F6AJI,"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower""","[39, 53]","I just finished watching the film DC 9/11, and I was very impressed with it.  Granted, it is a film that is made to present President Bush and his administration in the best light possible.  This film definitely presents Bush as heroic in his handling of the 9/11 crisis.  But, in a way, how else could Bush be portrayed?  Put aside for a moment America's division over Bush's actions later in his administration (Iraq, etc.).  Think back to Bush's performance as President in the week of the 9/11 attack, which is the subject of this film.  I think any reasonable individual would say that Bush handled the situation extremely well, and was able to rally the nation to a firm resolve to recover from the tragedy.Plus, when one thinks about it, a film that centers on an important leader can either present the person as very heroic or very villainous.  There are few films that find the ability to present a person's flaws and virtures (Patton would be one of the few).  Look at films like Thirteen Days (which portrays Kennedy as being near godlike in his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis) or Nixon (which presents that President as pratically the devil incarnate).There are several reasons why I think that every American should see this film:1) Despite the film's pro-Bush slant, the film is actually very accurate in its potrayal of what happened in the White House during 9/11 and in the week following the attack.  The best source available on this subject is Bob Woodward's book, Bush at War.  The book details the players, actions, and decisions of the Bush administration from the day of the attacks to the military operations in Afghanistan.  Woodward had full access to White House documents and personnel to write his book.  As anyone who is familiar with Woodward's work knows, he is not anyone political patsy.  In fact, he later wrote a book, Plan of Attack, which has been touted by both Bush supporters and anti-Bush people as THE book to read on the administration's decisions leading up to the invasion of Iraq.  The reason why I bring up Woodward's book, Bush at War, is because this film's potrayal of events line up extremely well with the facts laid out in Woodward's book, and with other documented accounts of the events.  Therefore, despite its biases, the film is a great, factual look at how the President and his administration handled the crisis, which is a vital story for Americans to know about our recent history.2) The film also give clear indications about how the Bush administration came to the course it took in handling the war on terror.  The military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Patriot Act, and other elements, are clearly forshadowed in the scenes involving meetings between the President and the National Security Council.  As President Bush himself told his people in one of these meetings, ""we are fighting an unconventional war against a very different kind of enemy.  We have to start thinking in unconventional ways.""  The film also shows through these scenes the disputes within the administration over how broad the war should be prosecuted (Powell and Rumsfeld and their  disagreements over Iraq, for example), and the weaknesses in America's intelligence community before 9/11.  For example, in one scene, President Bush asks the directors of the CIA and FBI why they were not communicating with each other about the suspected terrorists effectively, one of them replied, ""well, sir, our computers don't network with each other.""  Bush looked like he was about explode with frustration.3) Timothy Bottoms did a fantastic job in potraying President Bush.  He lacks Bush's pronounced Texas accent, but that was probably a decision on his part and that of the filmmakers to avoid any chance of his performance coming off as some comical impersonation.  Instead, Bottoms performs the role of President Bush with a focus on copying his demeanor (hand jestures, posture, facial expressions) mixed in with a focus on the President's emotions and mind set.  You get to see the personal side of Bush in those days, since the filmmakers interviewed Bush and those close to him to get a sense of his thoughts and feelings at that time.  It really shows Bush as someone who developed a resolve to do everything he could to prevent another 9/11.  One can argue about how he went about fighting the war on terror later, but few can doubt that his actions come from an internal impulse to never see another day like 9/11.  A masterful performance that should have earned Bottoms an Emmy, and would have if it were not for the political bias of those in Hollywood.This film masterfully captures an important moment in history through the point of view of the leadership in America the time it happened.",5,Every American Should See This Film!!!,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,4757,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'DC', '9/11', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Granted', 'film', 'made', 'present', 'President', 'Bush', 'administration', 'best', 'light', 'possible', 'film', 'definitely', 'Bush', 'heroic', 'handling', '9/11', 'crisis', 'way', 'how', 'else', 'could', 'Bush', 'be', 'portrayed', 'Put', 'aside', 'moment', 'America', 'division', 'Bush', 'actions', 'later', 'administration', 'Iraq', 'etc.', 'Think', 'back', 'Bush', 'performance', 'President', 'week', '9/11', 'attack', 'subject', 'film', 'think', 'reasonable', 'individual', 'would', 'say', 'Bush', 'handled', 'situation', 'extremely', 'well', 'was', 'able', 'rally', 'nation', 'firm', 'resolve', 'recover', 'tragedy.Plus', 'when', 'one', 'film', 'important', 'leader', 'can', 'either', 'present', 'person', 'very', 'heroic', 'very', 'villainous', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'find', 'ability', 'present', 'person', 'flaws', 'virtures', 'Patton', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'Look', 'films', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'Kennedy', 'being', 'godlike', 'handling', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'Nixon', 'President', 'pratically', 'devil', 'incarnate', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'why', 'think', 'American', 'should', 'see', 'film:1', 'film', 'pro-Bush', 'slant', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'accurate', 'potrayal', 'what', 'happened', 'White', 'House', '9/11', 'week', 'following', 'attack', 'best', 'source', 'available', 'subject', 'Bob', 'Woodward', 'book', 'Bush', 'War', 'book', 'details', 'players', 'actions', 'decisions', 'Bush', 'administration', 'day', 'attacks', 'military', 'operations', 'Afghanistan', 'Woodward', 'had', 'full', 'access', 'White', 'House', 'documents', 'personnel', 'write', 'book', 'anyone', 'who', 'familiar', 'Woodward', 'work', 'not', 'anyone', 'political', 'patsy', 'fact', 'later', 'wrote', 'book', 'Plan', 'Attack', 'been', 'touted', 'Bush', 'supporters', 'anti-Bush', 'people', 'book', 'read', 'administration', 'decisions', 'leading', 'up', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'reason', 'why', 'bring', 'up', 'Woodward', 'book', 'Bush', 'War', 'film', 'potrayal', 'events', 'line', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'facts', 'laid', 'out', 'Woodward', 'book', 'other', 'documented', 'accounts', 'events', 'Therefore', 'biases', 'film', 'great', 'factual', 'look', 'how', 'President', 'administration', 'handled', 'crisis', 'vital', 'story', 'Americans', 'know', 'recent', 'history.2', 'film', 'also', 'give', 'clear', 'indications', 'how', 'Bush', 'administration', 'came', 'course', 'took', 'handling', 'war', 'terror', 'military', 'operations', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'other', 'elements', 'are', 'clearly', 'forshadowed', 'scenes', 'involving', 'meetings', 'President', 'National', 'Security', 'Council', 'President', 'Bush', 'told', 'people', 'one', 'meetings', 'are', 'fighting', 'unconventional', 'war', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'enemy', 'have', 'start', 'thinking', 'unconventional', 'ways', 'film', 'also', 'scenes', 'disputes', 'administration', 'how', 'broad', 'war', 'should', 'be', 'prosecuted', 'Powell', 'Rumsfeld', 'disagreements', 'Iraq', 'example', 'weaknesses', 'America', 'intelligence', 'community', '9/11', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'President', 'Bush', 'directors', 'CIA', 'FBI', 'why', 'were', 'not', 'communicating', 'other', 'suspected', 'terrorists', 'effectively', 'one', 'replied', 'well', 'sir', 'computers', 'do', ""n't"", 'network', 'other', 'Bush', 'looked', 'was', 'explode', 'frustration.3', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'potraying', 'President', 'Bush', 'Bush', 'pronounced', 'Texas', 'accent', 'was', 'probably', 'decision', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'avoid', 'chance', 'performance', 'coming', 'off', 'comical', 'impersonation', 'Instead', 'Bottoms', 'role', 'President', 'Bush', 'focus', 'copying', 'demeanor', 'hand', 'jestures', 'posture', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mixed', 'focus', 'President', 'emotions', 'mind', 'set', 'get', 'see', 'personal', 'side', 'Bush', 'days', 'filmmakers', 'interviewed', 'Bush', 'close', 'get', 'sense', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'time', 'really', 'Bush', 'someone', 'who', 'developed', 'resolve', 'do', 'everything', 'could', 'prevent', '9/11', 'One', 'can', 'argue', 'how', 'went', 'fighting', 'war', 'terror', 'later', 'few', 'can', 'doubt', 'actions', 'come', 'internal', 'impulse', 'never', 'see', 'day', '9/11', 'masterful', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'Bottoms', 'Emmy', 'would', 'have', 'were', 'not', 'political', 'bias', 'Hollywood.This', 'film', 'masterfully', 'important', 'moment', 'history', 'point', 'view', 'leadership', 'America', 'time', 'happened']",DC 9/11 - Time of Crisis
832464,A5UQAS0EYI85G,B0002F6AJI,cheesefilms,"[0, 3]","I like documentaries and docudramas depicting historical events like Thirteen Days; The Reagans; The Kennedys and United 93. They are films done effectively to portray what we felt as a nation during those times. Mixing actual footage with actors is done impressively on a positive note here. The actors did a convincing job that there was some human emotion exchanged between Bush, Cheney, Rumsfield, Powell, Rice and company, particularly the hug between Cheney (Lawrence Pressman) and Bush, or the scene of Condoleeza Rice (Penny Johnson Jerald) weeping over her television, although America never saw these leaders as the film shows. The only portrayal and script of any of the actors in the film that America did see both on the nightly news and this film comes from Donald Rumsfield, as actor John Cunningham does successfully. Also, the films ending was unique in that it edits actual footage of Bush's speech to congress with clips of actor Timothy Bottoms and there the film concludes with the hopes and intent to seek ""justice"".However, on the negative side, if Timothy Bottoms were elected president over George W Bush, 911 would never have happened. This film represents President Bush as a leader that would have stopped, or the least took heed to the documented warnings we all know now Bush and our expensive defensive industry ignored whether intentionally or accidentally. After the attack, Bush relents on concentrating on Iraq rather than the capture and punishment of the real ""evil doers"". This film portrays Bush as a devout Christian, passionate, articulate and take charge intellectual leader and Cheney as a ""stand down for the president"" type of VP, which is far from the truth. The scene where Bush gets choked up in front of the media cameras and the public on his thoughts and prayers for the victims has never surfaced if it exists or at least not to the emotional extent the film shows. This is not propaganda unless the machine of conservatism works to convince Americans that the events in this film are real and an honest depiction of George W. Bush, the man. It appears to be a wishful dramatization for hardcore conservatives and fans in denial on the fact that invading Iraq, killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians and capturing Saddam Hussein somehow brings justice to fighting a ""new kind of war"", yet still, Bin Laden did manage to successfully flee ""justice"" and those famous words of ""whoever did this will pay"" nor did the nations of Germany, Pakistan, Egypt or Afghanistan ever answer for their harboring or ignoring this terrorist cell as Bush promised. Instead, we invaded the enemy of our enemy.If this were my film, I would have simply made a documentary of interviews, real footage and a timeline of what President Bush the American citizen and leader of the most powerful nation in the world rallying our response to the horrors of that September morning. Instead, we get over two hours of a desperate attempt to humanize the man as a romantic soldier complete with direction and confidence barking orders to the secret service, his Vice President, his wife and consoling the nations broken heart like a Sunday pastor and fatherlike executive. All this, taken from what writer Lionel Chetwynd managed to absorb firsthand from Bush himself, so we can pretty much conclude that this film, and the angles, opinions and emotional takes, came from the brain of George W. Bush himself.",2,Straight from the brain of George W.

Amazon claims that it is pro-Bush, but I don't agree.  In fact, the country was united behind the President for a time during and after 9/11, and that is what this film is all about.  Yes, the film depicts Condi Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, etc. as ""selfless civil servants""  (See Amazon editorial review).  Never mind what is so bad about that.The film does a fine job of bringing out the effort by the White House team to ""think outside the box"" and come up with a creative and unconventional way to destroy Al-Quaida and liberate Afghanistan from the tyranny of the Taliban.  In doing so, a small American force accomplished in 3 months what a huge Soviet army failed to do in 8 years.  What's not to like?  The film brilliantly highlights the planning that went into this.I know that I was too busy dealing with the effects of 9/11 (stock market crash, effects on my business, other events, etc.) to really keep track at the time of what was going on.  This film does a fine job of putting the events of that terrible time into perspective, and re-acquainting us with the difficulties faced by the White House at the time.  Contrary to some reviews, e.g. Amazon's, the film does bring out some uncertainties and downright errors that the President and his team made at the time, such as Bush's less than stellar first TV broadcast to the nation, and the issue as to when he should return to Washington DC.Timothy Bottoms is uncannily like George W.

Bush) LawrencePressman (as Vice President Dick Cheney), George Takei (as NormanMineta) and Penny Johnson as Condoleezza Rice.The film tells the story of the September 11 attacks by Muslimterrorists through the experience of President George W. Bush and hisadministration from his being informed of the first plane striking theWorld Trade Center while reading to a group of school children andending with his speech before Congress on Sept 20, 2001. In between,the viewer is a fly on the wall as Bush guides the country through itsworst crisis since Dec 7, 1941 making decisions both in the short termand in the long term as he establishes the policies that will definehis next eight years in office and the decade.The film reminds VERY much of both the historical epics that Hollywoodused to make like THE LONGEST DAY and TORA TORA TORA and those superbhistorical miniseries the British used to make in the 70s. This is pureno nonsense historical drama at its best........something this viewerthought was a lost art in Hollywood. Every major player is identified.Dates and times are supplied. Real life footage is intercut with thedramatized footage seemlessly. The script is tight and accurate. Theacting is generally very good to the extent that even before aparticular person is identified, the viewer will go....""Oh that isDonald Rumsfeld! That is Dick Cheney!"" Only the actor playing ColinPowell did not seem to capture the man himself. And sometimes the filmgoes overboard in identifying EVERYONE! Did we really need to knowthat the woman standing behind Dick Cheney was supposed to be MaryMatalin??Bottoms will probably be the definitive portrayal of Bush for theforseeeable future. Without quite doing a Texas twang, he manages toget to the man's essence. The scenes of Bush consulting the Bible andpraying were unexpected and sincerly done. One was surprised. Inanother five years such a scene would be forbidden in a Hollywoodproduction. Penny Johnson IS Condoleeza Rice to such an extent that sheplayed the part again in the liberal banned PATH TO 9/11.The film is probably the best dramatization of an American Presidentsince the 70s/early 80s. One is thinking of THE MISSILES OF OCTOBER orthe miniseries KENNEDY and surprisingly it is about a Republicanpresident!! Usually when they are not making movies about how Lincolnwas a homosexual, the only Republican President that ever existed forHollywood was Richard Nixon.Hollywood, and indeed the entire world wide artistic community hasdebased itself with the avalanche of excrement it has voided upon theworld concerning the 9/11 War making not art or even movies but things,manifestations of patholgy that history will look upon in appalledhorror. While there are a few minor efforts worthy of credit, thus farthere are only three great films on the subject the banned PATH TO9/11, FLIGHT 93 that the Left produced the hideous UNITED 93 to try andtrick people from seeing and finally this which has utterly flumoxedthe Left over what to do about.It is a original film covering both a Republican President and theSept 11 attacks in a educational manner.It is a superb historical drama/epic of the type rarely made that isennobling.It is a well done film on its own right that is entertaining.In short it is everything Art is supposed to be and so utterly aliento the modern artistic community.Thus they ignore it hoping it will just go away.The viewer should not.Very possibly a film that will be eventually recognized as a classicof the type.Highly recommended.",5,A Film Escaped.............and freedom rings........,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,3678,"['DC', '9/11', 'TIME', 'OF', 'CRISIS', '2003', 'Directed', 'Brian', 'Trenchard', 'Smith.Produced', 'written', 'Lionel', 'Chetwynd.Starring', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'LawrencePressman', 'Vice', 'President', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'George', 'Takei', 'NormanMineta', 'Penny', 'Johnson', 'Condoleezza', 'Rice.The', 'film', 'story', 'September', '11', 'attacks', 'Muslimterrorists', 'experience', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'hisadministration', 'being', 'informed', 'first', 'plane', 'striking', 'theWorld', 'Trade', 'Center', 'reading', 'group', 'school', 'children', 'andending', 'speech', 'Congress', 'Sept', '20', '2001', 'viewer', 'fly', 'wall', 'Bush', 'country', 'itsworst', 'crisis', 'Dec', '7', '1941', 'making', 'decisions', 'short', 'termand', 'long', 'term', 'policies', 'will', 'definehis', 'next', 'eight', 'years', 'office', 'decade.The', 'film', 'VERY', 'much', 'historical', 'epics', 'Hollywoodused', 'make', 'LONGEST', 'DAY', 'TORA', 'TORA', 'TORA', 'superbhistorical', 'miniseries', 'British', 'used', 'make', '70s', 'pureno', 'nonsense', 'historical', 'drama', 'best', '..something', 'viewerthought', 'was', 'lost', 'art', 'Hollywood', 'Every', 'major', 'player', 'identified.Dates', 'times', 'are', 'supplied', 'Real', 'life', 'footage', 'intercut', 'thedramatized', 'footage', 'seemlessly', 'script', 'tight', 'accurate', 'Theacting', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'extent', 'even', 'aparticular', 'person', 'identified', 'viewer', 'will', 'go', 'isDonald', 'Rumsfeld', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'Only', 'actor', 'playing', 'ColinPowell', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'capture', 'man', 'sometimes', 'filmgoes', 'overboard', 'identifying', 'EVERYONE', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'knowthat', 'woman', 'standing', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'MaryMatalin', 'Bottoms', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'definitive', 'portrayal', 'Bush', 'theforseeeable', 'future', 'quite', 'doing', 'Texas', 'twang', 'toget', 'man', 'essence', 'scenes', 'Bush', 'consulting', 'Bible', 'andpraying', 'were', 'unexpected', 'sincerly', 'done', 'One', 'was', 'surprised', 'Inanother', 'five', 'years', 'such', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'forbidden', 'Hollywoodproduction', 'Penny', 'Johnson', 'IS', 'Condoleeza', 'Rice', 'such', 'extent', 'sheplayed', 'part', 'again', 'liberal', 'banned', 'PATH', 'TO', '9/11.The', 'film', 'probably', 'best', 'dramatization', 'American', 'Presidentsince', '70s/early', '80s', 'One', 'thinking', 'THE', 'MISSILES', 'OF', 'OCTOBER', 'orthe', 'miniseries', 'KENNEDY', 'surprisingly', 'Republicanpresident', 'Usually', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'making', 'movies', 'how', 'Lincolnwas', 'homosexual', 'only', 'Republican', 'President', 'ever', 'existed', 'forHollywood', 'was', 'Richard', 'Nixon.Hollywood', 'indeed', 'entire', 'world', 'wide', 'artistic', 'community', 'hasdebased', 'avalanche', 'excrement', 'voided', 'theworld', 'concerning', '9/11', 'War', 'making', 'not', 'art', 'even', 'movies', 'things', 'manifestations', 'patholgy', 'history', 'will', 'look', 'appalledhorror', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'efforts', 'credit', 'thus', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'great', 'films', 'subject', 'banned', 'PATH', 'TO9/11', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'Left', 'produced', 'hideous', 'UNITED', '93', 'try', 'andtrick', 'people', 'seeing', 'finally', 'utterly', 'flumoxedthe', 'Left', 'over', 'what', 'do', 'about.It', 'original', 'film', 'covering', 'Republican', 'President', 'theSept', '11', 'attacks', 'educational', 'manner.It', 'superb', 'historical', 'drama/epic', 'type', 'rarely', 'made', 'isennobling.It', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'entertaining.In', 'short', 'everything', 'Art', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'utterly', 'modern', 'artistic', 'community.Thus', 'ignore', 'hoping', 'will', 'just', 'go', 'away.The', 'viewer', 'should', 'not.Very', 'possibly', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'eventually', 'recognized', 'classicof', 'type.Highly', 'recommended']",DC 9/11 - Time of Crisis
