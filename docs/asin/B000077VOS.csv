The camera guys did this one right, A+.  Some of Jimi's DVD's like ""Berkeley"" were filmed so bad, you'd think it was filmed by kids or a freshman film class, they shake the camera or do quick close ups and drop backs to add affects...rubbish....not here........pristine documentary style filming!This DVD also great, no..excellent 5.1 sound mix done by Eddie Kramer himself!I hope the go into the vaults and release the 1970 Atlanta show un-edited because it was a much much better performance, but this is a pure gem as well!Also, I'd love the see the 1970 Hawaii concert done right, small crowd with a beautiful Hawaiin landscape, what can bet better than that!",5,The BEST JIMI HENDRIX DVD.........,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,971,"['Great', 'see', 'Jimi', 'LONG', 'video', 'w/o', 'being', 'so', 'edited', 'down', 'times', 'sake.The', 'show', 'was', 'plauged', 'techinal', 'difficulties', 'Jimi', 'band', 'took', 'stage', '1', 'am', 'not', 'best', 'great', 'show', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'late', 'night', 'kinda', 'relaxed', 'soulfil', 'feel', 'it.Great', 'filming', 'camera', 'guys', 'did', 'one', 'right', 'A+', 'Jimi', 'DVD', 'Berkeley', 'were', 'filmed', 'so', 'bad', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'filmed', 'kids', 'freshman', 'film', 'class', 'shake', 'camera', 'do', 'quick', 'close', 'ups', 'drop', 'backs', 'add', 'affects', 'rubbish', '.not', 'here', '..pristine', 'documentary', 'style', 'filming', 'DVD', 'also', 'great', 'no..excellent', '5.1', 'sound', 'mix', 'done', 'Eddie', 'Kramer', 'hope', 'go', 'vaults', 'release', '1970', 'Atlanta', 'show', 'un-edited', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'pure', 'gem', 'as', 'well', 'Also', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', '1970', 'Hawaii', 'concert', 'done', 'right', 'small', 'crowd', 'beautiful', 'Hawaiin', 'landscape', 'what', 'can', 'bet', 'better']",N/A

These are well documented elsewhere.As yet another huge Jimi Hendrix fan (of which there are still several million, even after forty years,) I enjoyed watching this performance.The sound and Eddie Kramers' remix is as good as can be expected for this time period.  The film (source material) shows limitations, mostly scratches and dirt, but again it still looks mostly clear and beautiful for it's age.  It isn't choppy looking like the Woodstock footage is.  The color is beautiful, and the cameras do some really nice close up and pan work.  Kudos to the director for that.  Add to that, they give Mitch and Billy more camera time than is usual.  They don't just focus on Jimi, who of course IS the center of attention.  I like that about this footage.I know I will take some knocks for what I am about to say, and I'm really not trying to put anyone down either, but I have to wonder if some of you reviewers were watching the same concert.  I love Jimi's music as much as any fan can but let's face it folks, Jimi is not at his best during this concert, and wishful thinking won't make it so.  As a former musician myself, I know that there are good nights and bad ones, for whatever reason.  Often the harder you try to make it right (as Jimi clearly was) the worse it gets.  You can't control it, that's just the way it is.It appears to me like he spent most of his time trying to get in the groove, being conflicted about something and keeping his guitars in tune.  He is preoccupied, probably with the pressures of fame, money and an unfinished album that he really would've rather been working on than to be at this show. There are good moments, where he sees the ""opening,"" and not so good ones where it seems to elude him.  And this is through most of the show.  Ironically when the audience calls for the old standards, Jimi makes a joke: ""You don't want to hear those old songs, do you?""  Complaining that he is moving on from the Purple Haze era.  Yet this seems to be where he finds his groove... late into the show.There are missed lyrics when it seems that Jimi would rather just play the guitar, and missed notes where you can see his frustration.  St. Pepper and God Save the Queen, as well as All Along the Watchtower are all abbreviated versions because it this frustration.  He simply gives up and stops the band.As I have said, I enjoyed watching this but his preoccupation was also a distraction throughout.To reviewer Stuart Hartley:  Those radio noises that you think are glitches (""Security control.  Security control..."") are actually an intentional part of the song, ""Machine Gun.""  Listen to the studio version(s) and you will see.On the other hand, Mitch and Billy are ""on.""  Mitch especially shows his prowess as an excellent drummer through several solos.  And Billy is a solid a bassist as there is.  Nothing earth-shattering mine you, just solid.I would recommend this video/movie to any fan of Jim's.  It's great to see him perform even under these circumstances, but I would never use it to try and convince someone who is not already a fan that Jimi was among the very best.  Jimi lived to play and create.  He was an artist, with an artists' soul, eccentricities and quirks, but even the great ones have off moments.",3,"After All, It Is Jimi",1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,3327,"['do', 'not', 'intend', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'specifics', 'DVD', 'are', 'well', 'documented', 'elsewhere.As', 'yet', 'huge', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'fan', 'are', 'still', 'several', 'million', 'even', 'forty', 'years', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'performance.The', 'sound', 'Eddie', 'Kramers', 'remix', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'time', 'period', 'film', 'source', 'material', 'limitations', 'mostly', 'scratches', 'dirt', 'again', 'still', 'mostly', 'clear', 'beautiful', 'age', ""n't"", 'choppy', 'looking', 'Woodstock', 'footage', 'color', 'beautiful', 'cameras', 'do', 'really', 'nice', 'close', 'pan', 'work', 'Kudos', 'director', 'Add', 'give', 'Mitch', 'Billy', 'more', 'camera', 'time', 'usual', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'focus', 'Jimi', 'who', 'course', 'center', 'attention', 'footage.I', 'know', 'will', 'take', 'knocks', 'what', 'am', 'say', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'trying', 'put', 'anyone', 'have', 'wonder', 'reviewers', 'were', 'watching', 'same', 'concert', 'love', 'Jimi', 'music', 'as', 'much', 'fan', 'can', 'let', 'face', 'folks', 'Jimi', 'not', 'best', 'concert', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'so', 'former', 'musician', 'know', 'are', 'good', 'nights', 'bad', 'ones', 'reason', 'Often', 'harder', 'try', 'make', 'right', 'Jimi', 'clearly', 'was', 'worse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'just', 'way', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'groove', 'being', 'conflicted', 'something', 'keeping', 'guitars', 'tune', 'preoccupied', 'probably', 'pressures', 'fame', 'money', 'unfinished', 'album', 'really', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rather', 'been', 'working', 'be', 'show', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'where', 'opening', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'ones', 'where', 'elude', 'most', 'show', 'Ironically', 'when', 'audience', 'old', 'standards', 'Jimi', 'joke', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'old', 'songs', 'do', 'Complaining', 'moving', 'Purple', 'Haze', 'era', 'be', 'where', 'groove', 'late', 'are', 'missed', 'lyrics', 'when', 'Jimi', 'would', 'rather', 'just', 'play', 'guitar', 'missed', 'notes', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'frustration', 'St.', 'Pepper', 'God', 'Save', 'Queen', 'as', 'well', 'All', 'Watchtower', 'are', 'abbreviated', 'versions', 'frustration', 'simply', 'up', 'band.As', 'have', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'preoccupation', 'was', 'also', 'distraction', 'throughout.To', 'reviewer', 'Stuart', 'Hartley', 'radio', 'think', 'are', 'glitches', 'Security', 'control', 'Security', 'control', 'are', 'actually', 'intentional', 'part', 'song', 'Machine', 'Gun', 'studio', 'version', 's', 'will', 'see.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Mitch', 'Billy', 'are', 'Mitch', 'especially', 'prowess', 'excellent', 'drummer', 'several', 'solos', 'Billy', 'solid', 'bassist', 'Nothing', 'earth-shattering', 'mine', 'just', 'solid.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'video/movie', 'fan', 'Jim', 'great', 'see', 'perform', 'even', 'circumstances', 'would', 'never', 'use', 'try', 'convince', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'already', 'fan', 'Jimi', 'was', 'very', 'best', 'Jimi', 'lived', 'play', 'create', 'was', 'artist', 'artists', 'soul', 'eccentricities', 'quirks', 'even', 'great', 'ones', 'have', 'off', 'moments']",N/A

This is an excellent sounding DVD with thoughtful extras. I'm a fan of this DVD, not because of the music (which is mostly great)but because of the concert is a throwback to a time when rock shows weren't rote note-by-note performances with well-rehearsed banter. Hendrix wasn't a jazzman, but he improvised with the fervor of one, and one can clearly see his mixed emotions and preoccupied mind throughout this set.It's clear from the start that Hendrix was nervous about headlining at the Isle Of Wight, which was the UK's answer to Woodstock. Jimi found his first true commercial success in Britain and the early moments of the concert show him trying to curry favor with this English audience. But both 'God Save the Queen' and 'Sgt Pepper' are brief and rushed - a disappointment since other live performances of 'Sgt Pepper' are quite good and one hoped 'God Save the Queen' would reach the heights of 'The Star Spangled Banner.'From that point on, Hendrix alternates between his late 1960s staples and his newer, as yet unreleased material. Hendrix's heart is clearly in the newer material like 'Freedom' and 'Machine Gun' but the audience wants to hear the hits. Hendrix seems torn between wanting to please the crowd and playing more of what he really wants to. The result is some tense but challenging improvisation, as Jimi decides to abandon the showmanship in favor of musicianship. I couldn't turn away during this section. Hendrix definitely played better elsewhere, but his emotions were laid out so clearly that it was easy for me to imagine the conflict he felt at this stage of his career.Watching this DVD, I wanted to somehow tell Hendrix that it would be ok, and that he shouldn't be so hard on himself. If you're looking for a DVD of Hendrix having a blast, you'll have to go elsewhere.

Hendrix has moved beyond thinking that way after encountering Miles Davis, Gil Evans and others who are paving the future and leaving him behind. Never the less it's a 9-5 job and he tries to give the audience what they want and what they paid for. Hendrix is obviously bored, and nearly embarrassed to pander to the audience.Sad stuff and really the fault of the idolization that has grown around this guy.

724480,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B000077VOS,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[4, 7]","Like many people in the early '70s, I grew up with Jimi Hendrix as part of the cultural aether around me.  (This was well before the days of ""classic rock"" radio programs that have overexposed Hendrix's work and made it seem so tiresome...)  Anyway, it wasn't until I snuck into the moviehouse at the college student union near where I grew up and saw a screening of the Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock documentaries that Jimi Hendrix really blew my mind.  Although the feedback and distortion techniques he pioneered have become commonplace in the rock bands of today, no one has ever topped the stunningly intimate physicality with which Hendrix approached playing the electric guitar... His approach was as much percussive as it was melodic, with him pushing and nudging and prodding the tones out more than he actually strummed the strings.This performance is not as artistically dazzling or as charismatic as those earlier shows, but the cinema verite style of this stark documentary is an invaluable glimpse of a musical genius in his final, reclusive days.  As other reviewers point out, the logistical conditions at the Isle of Wight festival were chaotic and challenging, but it's clear from the pre-show and on-stage footage that Hendrix was not the hopeless basket case that many made him out to be, based on this single shambolic concert.

I bought this DVD the day it came out at FYE and was suprised to see how complete the concert was compared to the RHINO version on VHS. If you watch the orginal RHINO version you see they cut out most of the entire performence including half of all of the songs. This DVD takes you through a long journey starting out with the road crew and promotions for Jimi Hendrix, I found the beggining to be very interesting. Then they take you backstage with Hendrix before he goes on, and then your right on stage with the man on guitar Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix seemed to have many technical difficulties with his amp that night but it does not effect how good the concert was. This is the first time I heard Hendrix play All Along The Watchtower live that really suprised me also they include songs that many of us never heard him do like, Dolly Dagger, Freedom, Lover Man, In From The Storm, Message To Love, and Ezy Rider. What a treat for a Hendrix fan, as well as the camera angles they include in the bonus features you can basically watch Jimi Hendrix from any angle you want.

If you are a  Hendrix fan it's a MUST HAVE item.This is Hendrix in his final days, just  a couple of weeks before his tragic death on 9.18.1970.  The last major event on which he was involved and this time as the Blue Wild Angel as he told to one of the masters of ceremonies DJ Jeff Dexter.  Isle of Fehmarn Festival in Germany would be Jimi's next move.Hendrix sometimes looks tired and a bit out of concentration.  Just take a look at him while playing Red House with the Gibson Flying V guitar (he doesn't look very comfortable) or at the end of the show when he dramatically throws his Stratocaster into the floor.  Despite these small facts, most of his performance is absolutely brilliant even when his pants split and HAD to dissappear from the stage just a couple of minutes not without telling Mitch and Billy about his ""problem"".There are some songs that were actually performed and available on audio CD but not on film: Midnight Lightning, Hey Baby (New Rising Sun), and Hey Joe.  ""Hey Babe.."" as performed on the event, is heard during the last minutes of the film, which is sad because these were in fact the new numbers ("" Hey Babe"" and ""Midnight.."") Jimi was testing for his next new record.Great interviews and facts of the event courtesy of Billy Cox, Mitch Mitchell and Gerry Stickells.  ""Pictures in picture"" sequences of 4 songs are just incredible as they allow us, who weren't there, to get a complete vision of the stage and performers.  I wish more song were available in this format.One additional fact is that Hendrix dedicated Foxey Lady to ""the cat with the silver painted face"".

And his road manger sounded it out. Hendrix then went on stage and played it creativly great. Hendrix then had his Marshall Stacks bout 5 of them all go dead I mean no sound what so ever. Finally the roadys or whatever you like to call them fixed the amps and Hendrix started Spanish Castle Magic wow this was a differnt solo then Hendrix usually played. Hendrixs version of all along the wacthower took place next to me I loved wacthing Hendrix play this song Live it was a dream come true it was great. Hendrix went on with alot more songs I loved seeing Hendrix also play his new material like Freedom, Dolly Dagger, also In From The Storm. When Hendrix played Machine Gun that night he played his heart out running over 20 minutes I think this song was better played live at The Isle Of Wight than The Fillmore East. Hendrix played on Lover Man, and Message to Love. All together Hendrix played about 17 songs and this concert marked to be one of the latest and best concerts ever.

This historic show has been available through the years under different names and permeations, but never as the complete concert and in proper sequence. This errors have now been thoroughly corrected with the release of the superb DVD &quot;Blue Wild Angel&quot;.Reputedly, this is supposed to be a sub-par performance by a tired and burnt-out Hendrix, and if that's the case, even a sub-par Hendrix is still a marvel to behold. Regardless of his physical and mental conditions that night, Jimi still managed to deliver scintillating versions of &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot;, &quot;Red House&quot;, and the always inspiring &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot;. The ferocious, anguished &quot;Machine Gun&quot; alone makes this DVD essential.  Finally, there's the rare, and to best of my knowlege, unavailable elsewhere, live renditions of &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Message To Love&quot;, and &quot;In From The Storm&quot;, great new compositions that pointed the musical directions Hendrix was headed just before he sadly died.The sound and picture quality are very good for a film this old and just recently restored.  I would have enjoyed the footage a bit more if there was less facial close-ups and fast-cut editting, especially during the guitar solos, but overall it's still enjoyable, especially if you're a Hendrix fan.Overall, &quot;Blue Wild Angel&quot; is the best Jimi Hendrix concert film capturing one of the true guitar geniuses of all time in a last performance.

The film quality is great, almost the whole concert is shown, unlike the horrible edited versions of the past, and the concert is not as bad as some might say, although many greater ones have been preserved on tape.  On some songs he's distracted by equipment problems, but on others you really can see Hendrix at his best.  It's just an uneven concert really, but worth having nonetheless.  My only complaint is that this DVD is 'PCFriendly', and so unlike every other DVD in my collection, wouldn't play on my PC as I only had 4 GB free on my hard disk.

Added to this DVD that wasn't on the Image Entertainment version is ""LOVER MAN"" , ""FOXEY LADY"" , you see the actual performance of ""MESSAGE TO LOVE"" where in the Image Entertainment version you just hear the song during the intro of the program while footage of the daytime audience is being shown. You get ""EZY RYDER"" , ""PURPLE HAZE"" , and the unedited versions of ""MACHINE GUN"" , ""RED HOUSE"" , and ""VOODOO CHILD (SLIGHT RETURN)"".I have no idea why in the Image Entertainment version of this concert that VOODOO CHILD is edited because the BLUE WILD ANGEL version reveals that the prophetic line ""..if I don't see you no more in this world I'll meet you on the next one and don't be late..."" is cut out of the Image version! When you keep in mind Hendrix's unfortunate fate and that this concert took place just a few weeks before his death then that part is chilling , dramatic , and sad to see. Why edit that out? In ""BLUE WILD ANGEL"" you see this part.""BLUE WILD ANGEL"" also shows more of the bantering during songs over technical problems but it also shows it was a better show than what the Image version showed. There is a segment leading to the end of the concert where Hendrix hits the crowd with non-stop music. They played ""MESSAGE TO LOVE"" , ""EZY RYDER"" , ""PURPLE HAZE"" , ""VOODOO CHILD"" and ""IN FROM THE STORM"" (minus Hey Baby & Hey Joe on DVD) without stopping until the end. You just sit back and go along for the musical ride.There is a cool picture-in-picture feature in this DVD. It is used on 4 songs; ""SPANISH CASTLE MAGIC"" , ""MACHINE GUN"" , ""RED HOUSE"" , and ""FOXEY LADY"". Very cool!The Image Entertainment version obviously edited the concert footage to 'clean it up' and make it seamless but they hurt the integrity of the concert. In other words what you see isn't how things happened and why mix up the order of the songs? The concert was fine the way it was! Go figure.Anyway , you see this concert in its actual chronological order and in its entirety minus ""MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING"" , ""HEY BABY (NEW RISING SUN)"" , and ""HEY JOE"".

724496,A1HGQBE8ZSI58,B000077VOS,Nick Mackler,"[7, 7]","This DVD release presents one of Hendrix's most memorable live performances. Playing in front of 600,000 people, Hendrix quickly goes to work, taking control of the show with his guitar right around his performance of Spanish Castle Magic. This leads into some of the greatest guitar mastery you'll ever hear, with blasting metal riffs found within basically every song listed hear. Jimi's voice isn't in good voice at all times, but obviously that doesn't matter, seeing as Hendrix was never known for having a great singing voice.Their are many superb performances throughout this thrilling performance, and the special features are interesting as well. We get to see a Behind the scenes interview with Director Murray Lerner. Also featured are a couple of brief clips from other Live DVDs in the Hendrix collection. The Introduction before the concert is also very interesting to see, and we get to hear from bassist Billy Cox and drummer Mitch Mitchell.As for the overall footage and its presentation, such songs like Red House, Machine Gun and Spanish Castle Magic have strong camera work and we get some nice looks at Jimi soloing. The sound quality is perfect, and for the most part, the performance is enjoyable to watch.Performance Highlights:All Along the Watchtower: An epic song, and Hendrix gives a superb performance, with some fabulous guitar work. Always a classic song, and this is one great performance of the hit song.Machine Gun: The song immediately following All Along the Watchtower, Hendrix takes on a guitar journey with some of the most incredible guitar solos you'll ever hear. Great drumming on this one too.Red House: Most likely the most memorable performance from the concert, Hendrix takes a blues hit with a very, delicate, superb pace and displays his magnificent sense of blues. This live version is nearly 12 minutes long which leaves it being roughly 3 times the length of the song in its original form.In From The Storm: A perfect close, to a seemingly incredible live performance from the greatest guitar player of all time. Jimi is also in perfect voice for this one. Superb guitar work also compliment the song.Overall, I would have to recommend this DVD to any Jimi Hendrix fan, as it is truly an epic Hendrix concert, Live at The Isle of Wight. However, rock fans just looking into his music should avoid this DVD.

Camera work is terrific: none of the poor lighting that mars Berkley or Band of Gypsies, none of the dental examination that comprises all but a few minutes of Woodstock. The opening sequences are informative. Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox give a very solid account of how truly beyond pop stars they had become by that point, heading towards a jazz-blues fusion that only Miles Davis and John McLaughlin would be able to assume with any respectability.It is very clear from backstage chatter thru the comments of his tour manager and band mates that Hendrix was not keen on performing at this concert and had begun to feel that he was, in fact, beyond rock and its infantile approach to artists. That said, he had enormous respect for the people who had paid money to see him and so tore into this concert with enormous brio. His fingerwork is among his most dazzling. The camera crew captures three men feeding off each other with visual ques that also point to how sober, clean and focused Jimi was by this time. He and Mitchell were as in sync with each other as Coltrane and Elvin Jones. Cox has been unfairly glossed over in music and this film and soundtrack illustrate that he was the best bass player for the best guitarist of all time.If you are a fan, pick this up. If you are curious, I'd suggest this as theplace to start. Many thanks to the Hendrix family for releasing an incendiary performance. In a matter of weeks, Jimi would be dead. You'd never guess it from here: one listen to Voodoo Chile would convince you.I might also add that this DVD is far superior to the CD, whose sequencing made no sense and gives the listener the impression that Hendrix wants to get out as soon as possible. For the future: stick with Jimi's sequencing.

There were also a few technical difficulties that happened, but they always say that the show must go on.I think the set list is one of his best.  This was around the end of Hendrix's life, so just about every song that he had done had been done, including the stuff that wasn't released until after he died.  I feel that when comparing it to the other big concert that he did with this band, Live at Berkeley (from listening to the albums), his guitar playing stood out here more than it did on the Berkeley album when I first heard them.  On the bad side, ""Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)"" was probably done while the cameramen were reloading because although it's on the short album of the show, it's missing here, and I can guess that it wasn't just deleted for the fun of it because the editors tried to include as much of it as possible.I think that this is one of the best Hendrix live DVDs and although it's not perfect, it's raw and live, which I like.",5,The show where everything went wrong?,1249344000,"08 4, 2009",2009,1223,"['Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'cursed', 'Woodstock', 'show', 'was', 'planned', 'be', 'done', 'late', 'night', 'end', 'festival', 'everyone', 'was', 'tired', 'then', 'performing', 'two', 'morning', 'when', 'everyone', 'was', 'tired', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'technical', 'difficulties', 'happened', 'always', 'say', 'show', 'must', 'go', 'on.I', 'think', 'set', 'list', 'one', 'best', 'was', 'end', 'Hendrix', 'life', 'so', 'just', 'song', 'had', 'done', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'including', 'stuff', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'died', 'feel', 'when', 'comparing', 'other', 'big', 'concert', 'did', 'band', 'Live', 'Berkeley', 'listening', 'albums', 'guitar', 'playing', 'stood', 'out', 'here', 'more', 'did', 'Berkeley', 'album', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'bad', 'side', 'Hey', 'Baby', 'New', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'was', 'probably', 'done', 'cameramen', 'were', 'reloading', 'short', 'album', 'show', 'missing', 'here', 'can', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'deleted', 'fun', 'editors', 'tried', 'include', 'much', 'possible.I', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'Hendrix', 'live', 'DVDs', 'not', 'perfect', 'raw', 'live', 'like']",N/A
