The first season or two are shaky, but soon enough the writers demonstrate an uncanny ability to perfectly blend romance, drama, and plenty of wry humor, as well as using the ordinary as a springboard for analyses about life and social behaviors amongst people via Carrie's musings.  I have truly come to care about many of the characters in this show (although Steve is my personal favorite).However, I'm only giving this set three stars because multiple DVDs in the set are prone to produce pixelation on the screen as well as skipping and freezing.  We weren't even able to play some of the episodes.  At first I thought it was just a defective set, so I purchased another, but this one suffered from the same issues.  Amazon notes that this may occur on older DVD players, but our player was purchased within the last year.I don't know if the same issues arise in the individual sets, but I feel this demonstrates low regard for the series on the part of HBO, and I plan on contacting them about it through their website and suggesting they issue a recall or offer a free replacment program.",3,"5-star series, 1-star DVD quality",1178582400,"05 8, 2007",2007,1223,"['bought', 'set', 'girlfriend', 'somehow', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'completely', 'enraptured', 'show', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'two', 'are', 'shaky', 'soon', 'enough', 'writers', 'demonstrate', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'perfectly', 'blend', 'romance', 'drama', 'plenty', 'wry', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'using', 'ordinary', 'springboard', 'analyses', 'life', 'social', 'behaviors', 'amongst', 'people', 'Carrie', 'musings', 'have', 'truly', 'come', 'care', 'many', 'characters', 'show', 'Steve', 'personal', 'favorite', '.However', ""'m"", 'only', 'giving', 'set', 'three', 'stars', 'multiple', 'DVDs', 'set', 'are', 'prone', 'produce', 'pixelation', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'skipping', 'freezing', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'able', 'play', 'episodes', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'defective', 'set', 'purchased', 'one', 'suffered', 'same', 'issues', 'Amazon', 'may', 'occur', 'older', 'DVD', 'players', 'player', 'was', 'purchased', 'last', 'year.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'same', 'issues', 'arise', 'individual', 'sets', 'feel', 'low', 'regard', 'series', 'part', 'HBO', 'plan', 'contacting', 'website', 'suggesting', 'issue', 'recall', 'offer', 'free', 'replacment', 'program']",N/A

Little did I know that I was now dating a obsessive fan of the show. Over the 8 monthes we dated I had seen every episode that the series had to offer. From Mr. Big to The Russian. From the elegant and stylish Trey, to the homely but amazing divorce lawyer Harry Goldenplatt (sp?). As much as it pains me to admit, this show did have entertaining value, even for a man.The way I see it, the series was at its best in it's final season. Thing's were finally starting to fall into place for these four woman. Samantha's bout with cancer was an emotional, yet inspiring moment in the shows history. Over the years, the charachters really developed a nice depth to them that really gave you something to grasp onto.Though, some of the story lines were a little to extravagant, even for NYC single woman. And the games that these people play in there relationships becomes a little to much to bare at times, especially with some of the endings being very generic and predictable.Even though the show may be slighty slanted to the sympathy of woman, it still serves a good way to entertain. It's something that both you and your boyfriend/girlfriend can enjoy while cuddling with eachother in front of your TV, as long as you are able to laugh at the ridicoulous hijinks that occur in relationships.If you havn't seen the show before, I wouldn't go out and buy the whole series until you know if you like the show or not.

Finally someone has the yarbles to call it right. No man in his right mind would really want to be seen with someone who looks like that, much less undergo the constant and endless psychobabbling that would come with the territory. The other chicks aren't much better----the brunette looks ok but you would be instantly be put off with her quest to be the world's best soccer mom and happy homemaker; the redhead is really not that hot and has domination and assertiveness issues, which would turn most men off very quickly; and the blonde floozy chick is a skank that most guys would bang and never want to see again. So you are left with 4 headcases that talk talk talk constantly psychobabbling over the most mundane and minute details of every relationship. My God, no wonder relationships are so screwed up.

But I suspect the 4-star average given this product by all reviewers is strongly based on the show content, not the product itself.My 3-star rating (generous) is solely based on the product (lack of) quality.  After two tries, I asked Amazon for a refund.Many of the discs were heavily scratched, dented, or had a film on them.  Be sure to examine each disc in good light before your return period is up.The picture quality (4:3 format by the way) is marginal...how did they recorded this stuff anyway?  It does improve somewhat in the latter seasons.  Also note you can't play the whole season automatically; you must go back to a menu to start each episode.  This will be inconvenient for those of you who want to continually play this series in the ""background"" instead of music or radio, as my daughter does with Friends.The plastic case was fine in both sets but the case is very hard and sharp.  We liked the velvety texture of the book but the degree of ""velvetiness"" varied between the two sets.The discs fit into slots cut into the paper pages and sorted by season.  These pages will most likely tear with repeated use.  You can't replace a torn page without taking the whole book apart; it has a spiral binder...not 3-ringed.Given the amount of discounting on this box set and the individual seasons at times, HBO must be making a ton of money on the series.  Watch for sales...I've seen the boxed set available for under $100 and the individual seasons for under $10 each (but a store might not have all the seasons at one time).

I own the original plastic-cased editions as many others do and that's fine because the episodes are all the same.  There may be some slight extras in the new set but really, the episodes are the important thing, no?Sex and the City was a very addictive show with both relatable and non-relatable story lines and characters.  I think that on some level, if you were a big fan of the show, you found something in each of the women to relate to at some point in time - especially, if like me, you were a single girl in her 30s living in New York City when this show was airing regularly.  I do admit that much of what was portrayed was a bit far-fetched and shallow at times but as a show, it was very funny for what it was and quite entertaining.  The women were a bit self-centered, yes, but they were also compilations of many types of women out there and at least they were each independent and educated.  While many of us could or couldn't relate to, say,  Carrie's clothing and shoe addiction (I have that one) or Samantha's voracious sexuality, for example, the show really was a nice retrospective of what could possibly happen to any one of us or, in some cases, what actually has happened to any one of us, and in other cases, what would likely never happen to any one of us (for instance, having a famous artist sketch and paint your c**t for a gallery exhibit of c**ts, or having your one-night stand leave $1,000 on the nightstand before ditching you).Personally, I loved that the series was filmed in New York City because it showed the rest of the world just how amazing NYC is.  And also, that it emphasized the friendship aspect of these women over time (considering we've all known women who drop their girlfriends whenever a man shows up).  As unrealistic as it was that these four career women had so much free time to spend with each other, the basic core of their friendship was most important and meaningful and was the heart of what carried the show through all of the seasons.So, to offer my two cents, I say that if you don't already own the series (or if you are a serious collector), then this is the set for you.  But if you already own the original editions, I would keep them.  They fit on the shelf nicely with all of your other DVDs, they are the same episodes in the same order anyway so why pay all of that money for what you already own.  HBO doesn't need the dough, the girls don't exactly need the royalties and you could probably use it on something else - like cute new shoes or a boxed set of some other series you love and don't already own.",4,I think it's more about the show than the packaging,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,2793,"['Many', 'people', 'are', 'understandably', 'angry', 'now', 'out', 'new-fangled', 'boxed-set', 'edition', 'IS', 'sort', 'cheesy', 'HBO', 'part', 'think', 'focus', 'should', 'be', 'show', 'not', 'packaging', 'own', 'original', 'plastic-cased', 'editions', 'many', 'others', 'do', 'fine', 'episodes', 'are', 'same', 'may', 'be', 'slight', 'extras', 'new', 'set', 'really', 'episodes', 'are', 'important', 'thing', 'Sex', 'City', 'was', 'very', 'addictive', 'show', 'relatable', 'non-relatable', 'story', 'lines', 'characters', 'think', 'level', 'were', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'found', 'something', 'women', 'relate', 'point', 'time', 'especially', 'were', 'single', 'girl', '30s', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'airing', 'regularly', 'do', 'admit', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'portrayed', 'was', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'shallow', 'times', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'what', 'was', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'women', 'were', 'bit', 'self-centered', 'yes', 'were', 'also', 'compilations', 'many', 'types', 'women', 'there', 'least', 'were', 'independent', 'educated', 'many', 'could', 'could', ""n't"", 'relate', 'say', 'Carrie', 'clothing', 'shoe', 'addiction', 'have', 'one', 'Samantha', 'voracious', 'sexuality', 'example', 'show', 'really', 'was', 'nice', 'retrospective', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'happen', 'one', 'cases', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'one', 'other', 'cases', 'what', 'would', 'likely', 'never', 'happen', 'one', 'instance', 'having', 'famous', 'artist', 'sketch', 'paint', 'c**t', 'gallery', 'exhibit', 'c**ts', 'having', 'one-night', 'stand', 'leave', '1,000', 'nightstand', 'ditching', '.Personally', 'loved', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'showed', 'rest', 'world', 'just', 'how', 'amazing', 'NYC', 'also', 'emphasized', 'friendship', 'aspect', 'women', 'time', 'considering', ""'ve"", 'known', 'women', 'who', 'drop', 'girlfriends', 'whenever', 'man', 'up', 'As', 'unrealistic', 'was', 'four', 'career', 'women', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'free', 'time', 'spend', 'other', 'basic', 'core', 'friendship', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'meaningful', 'was', 'heart', 'what', 'carried', 'show', 'seasons.So', 'offer', 'two', 'cents', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'series', 'are', 'serious', 'collector', 'then', 'set', 'already', 'own', 'original', 'editions', 'would', 'keep', 'fit', 'shelf', 'nicely', 'other', 'DVDs', 'are', 'same', 'episodes', 'same', 'order', 'anyway', 'so', 'why', 'pay', 'money', 'what', 'already', 'own', 'HBO', ""n't"", 'need', 'dough', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'need', 'royalties', 'could', 'probably', 'use', 'something', 'else', 'cute', 'new', 'shoes', 'boxed', 'set', 'other', 'series', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own']",N/A

That is until my sister got the complete set for Christmas and I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I may have been a big-time skeptic but, I must confess, I haven't enjoyed a series as much as this since ""Xena Warrior Princess"" and they are completely different! ""Sex and the City"" is not only a smart and addictive drama/comedy, it's filled with great acting, witty humor, clever writing, touching moments of friendship, and situations that have to do with love, heartache and lust, which we can all relate to in one way or another (although I doubt the average person has slept with as many men as these gals have!). It's true, these girls are obsessed with fashion (especially expensive shoes) and they love drinking martini's, but they are not at all ditzy. In fact, they each have upstanding careers, are very independent, and, for the most part, are okay with being single (except for the more conservative Charlotte who is determined to get married by season three). I'm only on season four yet a lot has already happened to Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. However, on a creative/entertainment level the episodes are showing no signs of slowing down because, just when you think they've covered every possible subject matter that primarily focuses on the highs and lows of relationships, they surprise you by reaching new ground. And to me it only seems to be getting better as the series progresses and New York City is the perfect setting for all this to be happening in. I'm just sad there were only six seasons and that the movie deal has been cancelled.I also think the price is a bit outrageous for the number of episodes featured on each season (season five, I know, only has eight episodes!).

Remember when they used to be close to that much money per season?  Anyway, I am girl, but not usually into ""girly"" type shows.  My collection at home includes Breaking Bad, The Wire, The Sopranos, Oz, Deadwood, The Walking Dead, Mad Men, Carnivale, Eastbound and Down, Treme, Homeland, and um....Sex and the City?  I can't help it, I watch anything HBO - I've been doing it for years and only sometimes I am disappointed.  I was too young to watch this show when it first aired, but when I got a bit older and caught up, and have seen every episode many, many times.The great thing about SATC is that the writing is actually GOOD.  It's not only a chick show (which it is, yes), but a wonderfully written chick show.  If there was less of Carrie reading in ""dear diary"" mode (well, her articles), less women, and more POV from men, I feel very strongly that this show would have been hugely popular with both sexes.  The writers are just funny and know how to write good comedy.  If you watch the movies, just listen to the difference in dialogue quality between here and there.  It's not even close.  The movies are miserable in every way compared to the show.The great thing about this show is that it's just pure entertainment.  Many women are obsessed with the women characters of the show, but I just prefer to watch it purely for the laughs.  It is cleverly written and I like the characters, but its over-the-top lewdness and raunchy attitude mixed with genuine humor is what makes it special.  I watch SATC sometimes with my boyfriend in exchange for a back massage and he pretends he hates the show when we're not watching it, but he still laughs and used to say things like, ""I guess if you want to put the next episode on, you can....""

858677,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000646MNE,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[9, 11]","SEX AND THE CITY was originally designed as an un-censored sitcom which single 30-something women could relate to.  While it succeeded in that, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly the show reached out to a far broader audience.  It centers around 4 middle-aged single female friends, so it's best to start out by meeting our friends.***Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) is the main character in the show, and the title of the show is based on a column by the same name that she writes for a NYC newspaper.  She is a bit flighty and her favorite words are ""fabulous"" and ""fantastic.""  Her favorite drink is the Cosmopolitan and she is addicted to buying high heel shoes (she has maxed out many a credit card on shoe shopping trips!).  She discusses the issues of each episode in her column.  While a bit flakey and impulsive, her heart is in the right place in spite of some ethical lapses that she has from time to time.While she has  sundry short-term flings, Carrie has three major boyfriends during the show.  One of them is Aiden Shaw (John Corbett) who is just about the best fellow any girl could ask for.  Of course, Corbett is one of my favorite actors, so I'm a bit biased towards his characters.Carrie and Aleksander Petrovsky (Mikhail Baryshnikov) make an odd couple as they live in different worlds.  He is cultured and sophisticated, while her idea of culture is wearing $400 high heel shoes.  He is a Russian artist who is a bit over-bearing and self absorbed.  The biggest single problem is that he never seems to have any time for poor Carrie.The most important male figure in the show is Mr. Big (Chris Noth).  From the pilot episode on, the lives of Carrie & Mr. Big weave in & out of each other.  He is a wealthy playboy who looks like he is just stepped out of GQ magazine.  Unfortunately for Carrie, he is commitment-phobic.Carrie strikes out on the skin-o-meter as we only see her in sexy lingerie and occasionally a sheer blouse.***Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon) is a graduate of Harvard Law & is by far the most cerebral of our friends.  She is out to prove that she can make it in a man's world.  She and Carrie have a special connection.  She is the most cynical character on the show, and she complains the most about not being able to find Mr. Right.  Strange as it is, she eventually discovers that Mr. Right was right in front of her nose in the character of a bartender named Steve (David Eigenberg).On the skin-o-meter, Miranda takes her top off occasionally.***Charlotte York (Kristen Davis) is my favorite character, and I doubt that I'm alone in that.  She is a true Romantic and a dreamer.  She imagines her knight in shining armor rescuing her from being single and providing her life with a fairy-tale ending.Unfortunately for Charlotte, the knight who rescues her (Trey, played by Kyle MacLachlan)  ends up being a decent fellow who has serious intimacy problems.  He is also from a rather arrogant family with an especially annoying mother.Charlotte eventually trades in Trey for a regular-Joe lawyer named Harry (Evan Handler).  Like Miranda, she finds that her soul-mate fits very few of her pre-conceived notions of what he would be like.  She isn't even physically attracted to him, but falls in love with his big generous heart.On the skin-o-meter, Charlotte is briefly topless & 1/2 topless in the episodes FRENEMIES and ANCHORS AWAY.  We see her lovely posterior for a few seconds on WOULDA, COULDA, SHOULDA.****Samantha Jones (Kim Catrall) is the most promiscuous of our 4 friends.  She is anti-relationship, and prides herself on being thus.  For her, the only use men have is to fulfill her carnal desires.  As such, Samantha and Charlotte are antipodes.In spite of her cynical outlook, a young stud named Smith Jarrod (Jason Lewis) eventually changes her mind about the futility of having genuine human relations with the male gender.While the 4 characters are all very different, they all share a love for fashion;  they literally never wear the same outfit twice.  {Alas, a jeans & T-shirt fellow like myself would be apt to be out-of-place trying to date any of them}.  Some of the stuff they wear is a bit outrageous & over-the-top;  particularly some of the dresses that Carrie dons.While the show on a superficial level is a light-hearted comedy, it tackles some very serious issues such as:  surviving cancer, fertility problems / wanting to have a baby, unexpected pregnancies, deciding whether or not to get married and also caring for elderly relatives afflicted with Alzheimers.Ultimately, the #1 reason I love the show so much is due to the fact that each of the 4 central characters share a zest for life.  They show us (both men & women) that being single is supposed to be fun as opposed to seeming hopeless.  While the constant tributes to New York City occasionally gets old for a midwesterner like myself, it is also pretty honest as to how New Yorkers think of themselves & their city.  In any case, each & every time I watch SEX AND THE CITY I always feel like I'm having lunch with 4 of my favorite friends.  I feel as though their struggles and triumphs are my own, given that I can vicariously relate to so many things they go through.  Kind of odd for a single heterosexual male to admit that, eh?",5,"Thanx for the good times, girls!",1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,5280,"['SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'was', 'originally', 'designed',

Now that's it's only on television in censored edits on a basic cable station, you must see these D.V.D.s for everything H.B.O. viewers got to watch years ago.Fortunately it's Kim Cattrall, the show's hottest actress, who does nude scenes most freqently on SEX AND THE CITY - and shows the most of her incredible body.  Cynthia Nixon does a few topless shots and Kristin Davis takes her top off once or twice but neither girl lets you see more than that.  The show's star, Sarah Jessica Parker, keeps her clothes on despite that great figure of hers - not even thong panties.But Parker's character Carrie is the most interesting one on SEX AND THE CITY, chasing men who mistreat her and rejecting the guys who are good to her, the former represented most often by a guy she calls Big, the latter a boyfriend named Aiden.  And it does not seem to be Big's money or Aiden's good-not-great income that makes the difference to her.  Carrie just wants what she can't have.  Oddly, SEX AND THE CITY never has Carrie realize this, as the show's final episodes indicate.My biggest complaint about SEX AND THE CITY is that these women are so well-off they have more time than they should to worry about men.  Toward the end of the series, however, there is a story about one of the women that adds a dose of reality to the fantasy lives they live.  But overall SEX AND THE CITY's lives and loves of a public relation executive, art gallery director, newspaper columnist, and attorney don't reflect what life in the Big Apple is like for the vast majority of the women who live there.

858682,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,B000646MNE,F. Gentile,"[10, 17]","What can you say about such a hugely popular series, which also happens to be the best series ever? Usually popularity does not guarantee quality, quite the contrary. But in this case, for once, the masses got it right. This little series, taken from the book about single New York girls, introduced us to our  sweetheart sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw,  and her close knit group of girlfriends. Samantha, the good hearted  slut, Charlotte, the relative priss, and Miranda, the successful attorney with her defenses always up to avoid real intimacy/hurt. Their trials and tribulations in their liberated pursuit for love in The City had people hooked from the very beginning. But, who would have known that it would have become quite possibly the best show in t.v. history? Breaking taboos, with strong women no less, just hadn't happened until ""Sex."" To say they pushed the envelope is an understatement. What put this groundbreaking series light years ahead of the rest was the almost unheard of quality of writing and acting, designed specifically for adults. Try getting that at the local movie theater, or on almost all of television, for that matter, it just doesn't happen. Though I have my favorites from this entire six season series, there isn't an episode that doesn't delight to this day. I am not one to get hooked on t.v. series, but what ""Sex"" offered was so witty, touching, sophisticated, hysterically funny, and, well...REAL, it was just an unbeatable combination. It is hard to imagine this series without the four actresses who play ""our girls"", and especially impossible to imagine it without Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw. I don't know whether the producers intended for her to be such a main force at the inception of this series, but she quickly established herself as the lead character, and, as executive producer to boot. What is even more amazing is that over the course of her increasing prominence and importance to the series, there is not, in the entire six years of production, even the slightest hint of any rivalry between the actresses, and their spirit of on screen generosity apparently translated off screen as well. This entire class act should serve as an example for all other productions in general. Not only in its quality, but, in the all around camaraderie that is evident, which is so rare in television, where unknowns make it big overnight, turn into demanding brats.... which is usually followed by their banishment into obscurity, or, at best, selling ThighMasters on Q.V.C. To the end, the cast of ""Sex"" remained the very definition of the term ""ensemble cast."" All involved in this series very smartly decided to go out on top, and the final episodes brought six years of fun, tears, and real friendship to a wonderful sense of closure that has not been duplicated, and probably never will.

858685,AZL95QPWJDM3Y,B000646MNE,Gordon Ehrensing,"[0, 1]","When ""Sex and the City"" first aired on HBO, I was still attending public high school and living with my parents. Needless to say, the series did not immediately grab me and hold my interest. Now that I am a grown man living in the urban sprawl of Baton Rouge, I have finally been able to go back and appreciate this noteworthy television series. Through these five years, ""Sex and the City"" has gone through a slow and steady transformation, a transformation that may indeed reflect the changes dating women experience between the ages of 35 and 45. Watching episodes pulled from the first and fifth seasons quickly reveals a dramatic change between the flirty and fun, sex-loving characters of old and the cynic, unappealing, but ultimately wiser women they've become.Season 2 of the series, in my opinion, describes the crystallization of style the first season attempted to reach, with thematic plots differing from episode to episode to follow Cory's most recent magazine article. Cory seems to have an unnatural gift with words and finds a way to include each of the four characters' escapades into the focal concept of each episode. The overall style is busy and lighthearted, and Cory herself remains the only character especially affected by the tragedies of love. By season 3, however, Cory's complicated love life is beginning to crumble her resolve, and both Corvette and Mirando have fallen into equally committed relationships with Tom and Jerry. Once Semolina begins to experiment with monogamous relationships, the transition is unarguably complete. One can also witness a parallel evolution in style and cinematography, such as scene length and method of cuts between one scene and its parallel. By the third season, interviews with passersby have vanished: a flag that may indicate the disappearing universal application of episode themes to our own lives and the increasing specialization of character development and history within the plot.""Sex and the City"" of today is not what it once was. Like all middle-aged females, the women of ""Sex and the City"" must learn to move on from sexual promiscuity and hide behind the security of committal relationships or die alone and unloved. Which fate will befall Cory and her dear friends?",3,Memorable characters,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,2252,"['When', 'Sex', 'City', 'first', 'aired', 'HBO', 'was', 'still', 'attending', 'public', 'high', 'school', 'living', 'parents', 'Needless', 'say', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'immediately', 'grab', 'hold', 'interest', 'Now', 'am', 'grown', 'man', 'living', 'urban', 'sprawl', 'Baton', 'Rouge', 'have', 'finally', 'been', 'able', 'go', 'back', 'appreciate', 'noteworthy', 'television', 'series', 'five', 'years', 'Sex', 'City', 'gone', 'slow', 'steady', 'transformation', 'transformation', 'may', 'indeed', 'reflect', 'changes', 'dating', 'women', 'experience', 'ages', '35', '45', 'Watching', 'episodes', 'pulled', 'first', 'fifth', 'seasons', 'quickly', 'dramatic', 'change', 'flirty', 'fun', 'sex-loving', 'characters', 'old', 'cynic', 'unappealing', 'ultimately', 'wiser', 'women', ""'ve"", 'become.Season', '2', 'series', 'opinion', 'crystallization', 'style', 'first', 'season', 'attempted', 'reach', 'thematic', 'plots', 'differing', 'episode', 'episode', 'follow', 'Cory', 'most', 'recent', 'magazine', 'article', 'Cory', 'have', 'unnatural', 'gift', 'words', 'way', 'include', 'four', 'characters', 'escapades', 'focal', 'concept', 'episode', 'overall', 'style', 'busy', 'lighthearted', 'Cory', 'only', 'character', 'especially', 'affected', 'tragedies', 'love', 'season', '3', 'however', 'Cory', 'complicated', 'love', 'life', 'beginning', 'crumble', 'resolve', 'Corvette', 'Mirando', 'have', 'fallen', 'equally', 'committed', 'relationships', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'Once', 'Semolina', 'experiment', 'monogamous', 'relationships', 'transition', 'unarguably', 'complete', 'One', 'can', 'also', 'witness', 'parallel', 'evolution', 'style', 'cinematography', 'such', 'scene', 'length', 'method', 'cuts', 'one', 'scene', 'parallel', 'third', 'season', 'interviews', 'passersby', 'have', 'vanished', 'flag', 'may', 'indicate', 'disappearing', 'universal', 'application', 'episode', 'themes', 'own', 'lives', 'increasing', 'specialization', 'character', 'development', 'history', 'plot', 'Sex', 'City', 'today', 'not', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'middle-aged', 'females', 'women', 'Sex', 'City', 'must', 'learn', 'move', 'sexual', 'promiscuity', 'hide', 'security', 'committal', 'relationships', 'die', 'alone', 'unloved', 'Which', 'fate', 'will', 'befall', 'Cory', 'dear', 'friends']",N/A

This show is neither mature nor adult.  This show is really just a glorified sitcom, with dirty talk and some very short (and not erotic) sex scenes.  The 4 women are very superficial, and are not very realistic.  Constantly eating out at posh restaurants in Manhattan (there are other burroughs in NYC, such as Queens and Brooklyn, where it is much cheaper to eat) every day, sleeping with a different man each week, buying as many things as they can, partying all hours of the night, and they still find time to work their professional jobs.  These women are supposed to be ""professionals"", but if that were the case, they would never be able to keep up their lifestyles (even with doing Red Bulls and coke all day).  I feel that these women are very unhappy, and they look for fullfilment through a hedonistic lifestyle.  I hark back to the 1960's in the films L'avventura and La Dolce Vita, where this kind of lifestyle was depicted as cheap (spiritually speaking), hollow, shallow, and depressing (and it still is, regardless of what the media may tell you).  Most of their affairs are quite meaningless, it's mostly sex without emotion, and the conversations remind me more of locker room talk written by sitcom writers.  And the sex scenes (which many people told me they were so hot) are tepid at best.  I have seen films by European art filmmakers (Bertolucci and Breillat, to name a few) that are light years more honest and artistic than anything this show can put out.  Americans have very childish attitudes towards sex, almost childlike.  They giggle at dirty talk, and try to show off their ""knowledge"" of sex, like when a 6th grader discovers the sex ed book, and brags about the new dirty words he/she has discovered.

I really liked the show too but I wouldn't give it 5 stars. Even though the show deals with many real problems that women face regarding men, like the episode where Miranda was told by one of Carrie's numerous boyfriends that ""he is just not that into you"", I cannot relate to any of the characters. I admire Carrie's, Miranda's, Samantha's and Carlotte's friendship but i don't like their life styles in regards to sleeping with as many men as there are in NYC. C'mon now, they are just fancy drassed easy women, to put it in more appropriate words. Their choice in men is rediculous and their conversations often tend to be a bit juvinille. Carrie spends all of her money on shoes and then fails to come up with a downpayment for her appartment and Samantha sleeps with anything male that can walk. Miranda is too cynical and negative and judgmental. Carlotte is the only likable character because of her belief that love and romance still exist and it's not only about sex.

858706,A2SPYMZ3IMU6IB,B000646MNE,Kathy,"[2, 16]","I didn't watch this one when it was showing on HBO.  My hesitation in buying this one was that I have never been a fan of anything that is overly explicit and I'm not a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker.  I have always thought that Kim Cattrail was absolultely beautiful, but to be honest, I could have done without seeing her naked.The Tributes on the dvd seem to indicate that this was an ""original"" series.  The only really original thing about it was the explicit nature.  I would classify it as a very adult version of FRIENDS. I found it very hard to buy that the characters were 30. With the exception of Charlotte, they looked 40.It took me until the third season to warm to the series.Carrie couldn't make up her mind whether to dress in very interesting and classy clothes or to wear things that didn't match at all.  Some of her clothes were just plain tacky!She wore too many colors together that didn't match and the see through clothes with colored bras and male briefs were, to use their words, ""ICK."" Someone also needs to clue Sarah Jessica into the fact that she looks much better with the straight, shorter hair and not all of those ""skunk"" colors in it.The only thing that kept this from being porn was the story line. The characters did mesh together well.  They were real inspite of the explicit sex and funky clothes.  I find it hard to believe that ANYONE is that permissive about sex.  I also don't know of anyone who talks that explictly about their sex lives with other people.On a positive note, I could identify with feeling that you have the right guy, then discovering something about him or the relationship that couldn't be acceptable. Dating becomes harder as you grow older in that we are more discerning about who we date.  We have learned more about who we are and what we want and what we can or can not tolerate.  I could also identify with the feeling that they would NEVER find the right man, much less their soulmate... I myself am still waiting.Despite my outdated old world values and morals, and my adversion to things that are too explicit, ( I am of the opinion that implied is much sexier than explicit.) this series is worth a watch.

There are those that open you up to something new and exotic, those that are old and familar, those that bring up lots of questions, those that bring you somewhere unexpected, those that bring you far from where you started, and those that bring you back* (*punctuated with the sound of Samantha c*ming)"". But the most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you find someone to love the 'you', you love...well thats just fabulous!""With that very last voice-over, I watched TV character, Carrie Bradshaw peer down at her cell phone, giggle, and disappear down Fifth Avenue wearing her Manolo Blahniks and carrying a Fendi bag in hand. I had just spent almost once a week, for the past twenty-some months, watching all 94 episodes of ""Sex and the City-The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)"". And you know what? It was all...so worth it!Each week I would find some alone time for just a half hour, with no other worldly distractions, so I could follow the social/sexual adventures of four smart, sophisticated, stylishly dressed women (all friends) as they hilariously made their way through the trendy, concrete dating jungle of Manhattan. These four women included sex columnist and shoe fanatic, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), preppy, idealistic, art dealer, Charlotte York (Kristin Davis), cynical lawyer Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon) and finally PR spin-meister and sexual adventurer, Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall).In the early episodes of the series it seems like we are being treated to an almost comic anthropological study of men, women, dating and sex. Carrie would pose a question on the Mac for her column and their adventures would come up with the answers. But as the series goes on, we watch the changes in these characters as they emotionally grow and evolve. We get to experience with them, both the highs and lows of their lives. This includes boyfriends, marriages, a birth, sickness and all the other messy stuff that comes along. And through all this, these four friends wittily comment (in sometimes hilariously graphic language), laugh and cry as they get together. In the end these women always have each other for support. They are always there for each other. It's what friendship is all about. And that I think is why this show went from merely being just a well written, well acted comedy to becoming something really special for both its' fans and TV history.This 20-disc ""Complete Collectors Set"" is much more covenient (and cheaper) then buying the individual seasons. The pink, furry, book-like, packaging includes sepia toned photos of the cast and brief descriptions of each episode. The seasons are color coded for easy identification. The only packaging drawback is that the cardboard pockets can easily scratch the discs. (My anwer to this is to keep the current disc you're using in a spare CD jewel case.) The extras include two HBO tributes to the show, a taping of a lively (and funny!) writers forum and a small amount of deleted scenes, season by season. Best of all are the episode commentary tracks from Writer/Director Michael Patrick King. His commentary is both interesting and incisive, giving both detailed analysis of each episode's themes plus all the great poop about the behind the scenes stuff! They were a pleasure to listen to.So, here it is, twenty-some months from when I first started watching ""Sex and the City-The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)"". What is there to do now?

I didn't want to like it (too popular!) but I fell in love with it anyway when it finally came to syndicated television.  The four female characters are by turns glamorous, imperfect and neurotically, lovably real in their own individual ways, but it is Sarah JP's Carrie -- a writer with an improbable weakness for stilettos and dresses that cost a month's rent -- who is clearly the heart and soul of the show.  Much of the insight into personalities and problems (oy, there are so many problems!) comes naturally through her eyes and rarely, if ever, feels forced.  No small thing for a TV show.  Though she is the least conventionally good looking of any of the four friends, she is in many ways the most effervescent and irresistible.  Her honesty, her deep hunger for meaning, beauty and fulfillment, her smarts and her belief in herself and (even more so) her best girlfriends make this character one for the ages.  To simply call this show ""smart"" or ""sexy"" or even to say that it ""captures the zeitgeist"" is simply to do it a disservice.  It is a nuanced, heart-on-the-sleeve valentine to the real romance of life, friendship and the not-always-successful pursuit of happiness.  The victory isn't always in the getting, but more often in the trying.  Somehow the people who made this terrific show got that, and didn't forget it.That the entire enchilada is now being served up in a delicious, raspberry pink boxed set is only fitting.  Style for the stylish, but much more than mere ""pretty"" beats beneath the sueded finish of this attractive package.

If I was judging this DVD set solely based on its design, content, and value, I'd have to give it five stars. The elegant suede photo album packaging and the extra bonus DVD are fabulous, and the cost is a real bargain...the entire ""Sex and the City"" series for under $200? You can't beat that, especially when you look at the way HBO jacks up the prices on its other TV DVD sets.However, I'm very bitter right now, which is why I'm only giving this item one star. I bought all the original ""Sex and the City"" DVDs when they first came out. The plastic packaging of the single-season DVD sets is unbelievably shabby...the covers are extremely flimsy and I have Scotch tape holding several of my DVD sets together. Also, I paid the full price for each DVD set, which averaged out to about $40 a pop. (It looks like the price of the old sets has since been lowered, at least on Amazon's site.) Plus, HBO screwed its fans by releasing the fifth and final season of the show in two parts, so we had to shell out even MORE money. Now they're coming out with this gorgeous collector's set a year later, and it's such a bargain, which makes me very ANGRY! Why the hell did I shell out all that money to begin with? I'll tell you why: because I love ""Sex and the City"" and I was willing to put up with the crappy plastic packaging just so I could watch my show whenever I felt like it. There is NO WAY I'm shelling out another $200, even though I want this gift set SO BADLY!

858726,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B000646MNE,Moon Donkey,"[0, 1]","This review rates the following (in order):EntourageRomeCalifornicationSpartacusWeedsSex and the CityThe TudorsTrue BloodBig LoveMy wife and I have found that we enjoy these series better than watching individual movies.  I believe that we also would rank them in the same order, so this is a male/female friendly review.  As with all MoonDonkey reviews, it goes without saying that this is gospel.I've tried to do this without including spoilers.#1 Entourage (5 stars)How could anything else be #1?  Entourage follows the career of movie star Vincent Chase and his group of friends.  This is the gold standard by which all other series are measured.  Plus, Entourage has the best one-liners of any series.  Unfortunately, I cannot include them in this review due to their graphic nature.#2 Rome (5 stars)Rome follows the exploits of two Roman soldiers - Verenus (the smarts) and Pullo (the brute).  Very well done.  For a historical drama, the sets are very well designed and believable.  In Rome, the idea is that you see the Roman Empire through the eyes of two soldiers as they experience the ups and downs of life.  My wife and I enjoyed this one a lot.#3 Californication (5 stars)Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this at first.  I pegged David Duchovny as an X-Files guy and wasn't sure what to make of him in this role.  Also, I wasn't sure what Californication was about anyway.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  In Californication, we follow the life and career of author Frank Moody - a chaotic and perhaps self-destructive individual who has a way with women.  Unfortunately for him, he is trying to balance the chaos of his life on one side with his teenage daughter and her mother (his love interest) on the other side.  The dude is a train-wreck and it makes for a great series.#4 Spartacus (4 stars)Spartacus is about a man who is captured and made a gladiator slave in the Roman Empire.  There is just of a bit of a drop off from the 5 star series to 4 star Spartacus.  Why?  Well, there just isn't as much of Spartacus.  Basically one season followed by a ""prequel"" season.  I believe that is because the original Spartacus actor died of cancer.  I'm not sure if there are future plans for the series or not.Also, the effects take some getting used to.  There is definitely a CGI feel to some of the scenery.  The blood effects are similar to 300.Regardless of those issues, Spartacus was highly enjoyable.  Even my wife, who was like ""what the heck"" after the first episode, came around and really enjoyed the series.  Maybe because they show sausage.  Some of the gladiator ""locker room"" scenes are like staring at a pack of Johnsonville brats.  There is a lot of blood and nudity in this one - as there should be given that this is a brutal depiction of life as a slave gladiator.#5 Weeds (3 stars)Weeds gets a golf-clap 3 star ranking.  Why?  Because the plot just doesn't make sense sometimes.  There are points in this series where you feel like it is going one way and then - boom - the plot takes a 90 degree turn towards something else.  It's not like it makes sense thought.  Rather, it feels more like a different writer came in to write a different episode or something.  It is very strange and it happens a number of times.Weeds follows the life of a suburban mom who sells pot to make money after her husband dies.  The decision to become a dealer impacts her two sons and her husband's brother - who comes to live with her.  The series starts out with sort of a realistic ""how would this play in the suburbs"" feel, but then progresses down some more eccentric paths.We have enjoyed the series, but this is not one that we were waiting at the mailbox for the next video to arrive.  It qualifies as a ""we will watch it when we get around to it"" series.#6 Sex and the City (3 stars)Sex and the City explores the lives of 4 single women and their quest for happiness and men in New York.  Why 3 stars?  This is the only series that my wife and I would disagree on the ranking.  I suspect she would give it 4 stars and I would give it two.  Frankly, it is too much of a ""chic flick"" for me... and I would guess most men feel the same way.Wait you say - what about Entourage?  Isn't that basically the same thing with a group of guys?  In a word... no.  It isn't.  For some reason, Entourage just plays better that Sex and the City.  Also, the last couple seasons of Sex and the City really fell off a cliff.  It had the distinct feeling that they were just looking to wrap it up.Also, speaking as a guy, this series became too ""cultish"" for me.  Do you know how many women started drinking cosmos because of this series?  For that matter, do you know how many ""Rabbits"" sold because of this series?  Sex and the City became sort of a female cultural event.  Guys - that really tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it?#7 The Tudors (3 stars)This is a tough one.  The Tudors is a story about the life of Henry V of England and his many wives.  It is good, but I think many people just won't get into this series.  It doesn't have the craziness of Entourage or Californication, nor the blood and guts of Rome and Spartacus.  The Tudors is more of a historical drama.  Consider The Tudors a 3 star teetering on the edge of a 2 star.  I prefer Weeds to The Tudors.  However, I think my wife would maybe rank this a bit higher.If you choose to watch this series, I strongly recommend committing to watching the first 3-4 episodes at least.  If you just watch one or two, you probably won't stick with it.I tell you what though - one of the most interesting things about The Tudors is all of the torture.  Watching The Tudors makes any modern ""torture"" techniques look laughable.  Water-boarding?  Bah, that's for sissies!  Give me the rack!#8 True Blood (2 stars)True Blood is about life in a small town after vampires have come out of the closet and try to live normal lives with humans... or at least that is what it starts out to be.Look - I'd love to rate True Blood higher, but the series just gets weirder and weirder as it goes on.  It is like the writers got bored with the standard vampire-human conflict thing so they had to take it in several other directions... and I do mean several.  Suddenly we have werewolves, witches, shape-shifters, fairies, etc, etc.  It gets to the point where you are asking yourself, really?  Really?I'd give the first season alone 4 stars, but it drops of to 3 stars and then to 2 stars after that.#9 Big Love (1 star)Big Love is about a mormon family practicing polygamy.  The story follows the life of one man and his many wives.  My wife liked this a bit more than I did, but it just didn't do it for me.  There really wasn't anything about the show that I found interesting.  I think my wife enjoyed some of the relationship drama, but she stopped watching the series and hasn't expressed an interest in continuing it.  This one was a burn-out.  I think it is because Big Love is maybe too serious - if it had a Californication element to it, I bet it would have been pretty entertaining.So there you have it my friends.  I may continue to update this list as we watch more series.  The nutshell is that HBO appears to be focusing on more high-end ""production"" type series and Showtime is focusing on lower cost dramas.",3,Rating several series from best to worst,1322438400,"11

I had wanted to get it long before now for myself, but just couldn't justify spending the three hundred dollars for it. So, instead, I bought each individual disc as it came out, but I wanted this set so badly.  It was a complete surprise this year!  But what's not a surprise is that this gift set is everything promised and more...The design and presentation of this item is just superb.  It comes in a plexiglass box that keeps all of your DVDs from each season safe.  Plus it has tons of extras, some of which include:En-Sex-Lopedia - All-encompassing guide to Sex and the City that takes a look back at the defining moments in dating, fashion, friendship and relationships.Location, Location, Location! - A guide to New York restaurants, clubs and boutiques frequented by Carrie and  her friends.Sex Essentials - A video jukebox for advice, quips and quotes on dating, sex, fashion and more!You Can Quote Me on It - A ""finish that phrase"" game that tests your knowledge of the famous quotes uttered throughout the seasons! So much fun!The Guest List - A look back at some of the famous faces making memorable guest appearances on the show.Also these are kept in a binder type book which looks gorgeous on the coffee table.  I also have ""Kiss and Tell"" with the pink faux alligator cover thats a perfect match to display together. Everyone that comes over is so impressed with how much went into this gift set.This was and always will be one of my very favorite shows.  And, if it's one of yours, you are guaranteed to love this set.  You can put in any disc at any time and it's a night out with the girls every night of the week.  It includes all six seasons and every single episode plus other commentary as well.  I will never part with this set.  It's a staple in my television time.

Sure, Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha can be very vain and self-absorbed at times, but they are overly optimistic and hopeful and don't pertain to the machismo of masculinity. Hence their lunch time is always consist of a giddiness of a school girl gossip, regardless of the hardships that they are undergoing during that particular time, instead of the endless moaning and groaning that single people should be doing according to the other works of medium. The series finale is predictable and a little commercialistic and perhaps too sugary, but it stays true to the roots of this unique and refreshing show: who needs the Russian in beautiful Paris when your gals are always there in New York. In other words, men can be fodder for the continuity of women's friendship and loyalty to one another. This is a brave show that not only tackles a lot of subject matters that are considered taboos even for today's standards, and that also puts back sass into primetime sitcom entertainment, but it presents the embodiment of what a single girl truly is. For those who are adamant about seeing their very first episode (like I was in the beginning), please proceed because underneath the layers of sex and conversations about genital parts over coffee and Samantha's weekly rendezvous with different guys and its overall seemingly superficiality of lipstick gloss and well-coiffed hair, it celebrates girl power, feminism, and friendship and most importantly the knowledge that every girl, single or married, should always have a gay confidante.

858738,A29WEJ4ET7Z0ON,B000646MNE,Sagel Friendsmith,"[0, 0]","Sex and the City is a true gem; the type of show that doesn't come around every day. It is incredibly well-written and acted, and is always entertaining. Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw is so convincing as a single 30-something sex columnist living in Manhattan that you almost feel like you're watching a reality show - except the cinematography is light years ahead. The conversation between the 4 friends (Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha) is very realistic, and makes you feel as if you're having drinks with your girlfriends. The show's intelligent writing is sometimes pretty R-rated, and the episodes often contain graphic sex scenes - not for children's eyes. All the boyfriends out there who buy this box set as a gift for their girlfriends might get easily maxed-out on chick-flick type banter, but overall, it's a good show regardless of gender. I once made an ex-boyfriend of mine sit through several episodes, and I caught him laughing out loud several times.

It explored women's desires, needs, modern lives and relationships in a way that had not been tackled before. It almost certainly paved the way for series such as ""Despearte Housewives"" and even caused some film genre revision, have you not noticed the increased amount of movies which are now cheifly promoted on the strength of talent of the leading Lady?.Parker is astute, perky, obessesive and sweet as Carrie, Davies is elegantly uptight as Charloote, Nixon is ballsy, brittle and engagingly hard nosed as Miranda while Cattrall is all guns blazingly ferocious in her approach to life as Samantha.The men filter in and out and are scrutinised for their worth, prowess and personality in a direct reverse of standard gender roles in TV shows. Some seasons stand out as better than others, Season 5 is criminally short due to Parker's real life pregnancy having to be disguised and the story lines featuring Birishnakov are worthy but he is no actor! The final season which heads inevitably to the end of our time with these fabulous women, is strangely saddening and ethereal at times, notable is the absence of the standard narration by Parker which for me enhances the haunting quality of this final journey. Also Carrie's attempt to live in Paris feels oddly cold and isolating as this great but sometimes pompous city can be in a way that New York would never be, being as crazy and all embracing as it is.In all a worthy series presided over by 4 very beautiful, interesting and talented actors, I miss them heaps!",5,A fine way to watch and remember the series.,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,1619,"['Ultimately', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'ground', 'breaking', 'TV', 'series', 'justice', 'see', 'whole', 'thing', 'explored', 'women', 'desires', 'needs', 'modern', 'lives', 'relationships', 'way', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'tackled', 'before', 'almost', 'certainly', 'paved', 'way', 'series', 'such', 'Despearte', 'Housewives', 'even', 'caused', 'film', 'genre', 'revision', 'have', 'not', 'noticed', 'increased', 'amount', 'movies', 'are', 'now', 'cheifly', 'promoted', 'strength', 'talent', 'leading', 'Lady', '.Parker', 'astute', 'perky', 'obessesive', 'sweet', 'Carrie', 'Davies', 'elegantly', 'uptight', 'Charloote', 'Nixon', 'ballsy', 'brittle', 'engagingly', 'hard', 'nosed', 'Miranda', 'Cattrall', 'guns', 'blazingly', 'ferocious', 'approach', 'life', 'Samantha.The', 'men', 'filter', 'are', 'scrutinised', 'worth', 'prowess', 'personality', 'direct', 'reverse', 'standard', 'gender', 'roles', 'TV', 'shows', 'seasons', 'stand', 'out', 'better', 'others', 'Season', '5', 'criminally', 'short', 'due', 'Parker', 'real', 'life', 'pregnancy', 'having', 'be', 'disguised', 'story', 'lines', 'featuring', 'Birishnakov', 'are', 'worthy', 'actor', 'final', 'season', 'inevitably', 'end', 'time', 'fabulous', 'women', 'strangely', 'saddening', 'ethereal', 'times', 'notable', 'absence', 'standard', 'narration', 'Parker', 'haunting', 'quality', 'final', 'journey', 'Also', 'Carrie', 'attempt', 'live', 'Paris', 'feels', 'oddly', 'cold', 'isolating', 'great', 'sometimes', 'pompous', 'city', 'can', 'be', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'being', 'crazy', 'embracing', 'worthy', 'series', 'presided', '4', 'very', 'beautiful', 'interesting', 'talented', 'actors', 'miss']",N/A

Each character as their own individual voice and personality that it makes it such a treat to see all of their different views on situations.  Samantha, the free spirit, who is very much in touch with her sexuality and knows how to use it.  Charlotte, the hopeless romantic who is on a constant search for her prince charming.  Miranda, the slightly cynical one of the group who wonders if there ever truly is a happily ever after.  Carrie, has a bit of all three in her which probably makes her the most relatable one of the four because all of us have a bit of Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda in us.  The show provided a great in depth look on the relationships and friendships between these four women and how dating isn't always the great thing it's made out to be in movies and other tv shows.  It was honest in it's portrayal and how tough it is to date.I applaud each of the actresses because with out them and their perfect chemistry together the show wouldn't be the hit that it became.  This DVD set is a real treat for fans of the series, it would have been a great set even if it was just the episodes themselves with no special features.  The bonus disc is a nice touch to the set with games and little video montages of the characters and quotes from the series.  However, my favorite feature is the farewell tribute on the season 6 (part 2) set.  The tribute has all of the actors and creators comment on the show and how it became the huge success it turned out to be.  So for anyone who is debating about getting this set, I say go for it because not only do you get fantastic, quality episodes, you also get a beautiful package for the set filled with photos, episode guide and great bonus features.  Only thing I wish was included were bloopers because I'm sure with a show like Sex and the City, there must have been some terrific bloopers.",5,A Perfect Set for a Perfect Show,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,1992,"['What', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'Sex', 'City', 'was', 'bold', 'show', 'took', 'chances', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'be', 'blunt', 'dating', 'sex', 'character', 'own', 'individual', 'voice', 'personality', 'such', 'treat', 'see', 'different', 'views', 'situations', 'Samantha', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'touch', 'sexuality', 'how', 'use', 'Charlotte', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'who', 'constant', 'search', 'prince', 'charming', 'Miranda', 'slightly', 'cynical', 'one', 'group', 'who', 'ever', 'truly', 'happily', 'ever', 'Carrie', 'bit', 'three', 'probably', 'most', 'relatable', 'one', 'four', 'have', 'bit', 'Samantha', 'Charlotte', 'Miranda', 'show', 'provided', 'great', 'depth', 'look', 'relationships', 'friendships', 'four', 'women', 'how', 'dating', ""n't"", 'always', 'great', 'thing', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'movies', 'other', 'tv', 'shows', 'was', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'how', 'tough', 'date.I', 'applaud', 'actresses', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'together', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'hit', 'became', 'DVD', 'set', 'real', 'treat', 'fans', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'set', 'even', 'was', 'just', 'episodes', 'special', 'features', 'bonus', 'disc', 'nice', 'touch', 'set', 'games', 'little', 'video', 'montages', 'characters', 'quotes', 'series', 'However', 'favorite', 'feature', 'farewell', 'tribute', 'season', '6', 'part', '2', 'set', 'tribute', 'actors', 'creators', 'comment', 'show', 'how', 'became', 'huge', 'success', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'So', 'anyone', 'who', 'debating', 'getting', 'set', 'say', 'go', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'fantastic', 'quality', 'episodes', 'also', 'get', 'beautiful', 'package', 'set', 'filled', 'photos', 'episode', 'guide', 'great', 'bonus', 'features', 'Only', 'thing', 'wish', 'was', 'included', 'were', 'bloopers', ""'m"", 'sure', 'show', 'Sex', 'City', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'bloopers']",N/A

I never liked the individual one on one with the camera type acting. Thankfully that changed in season 2. And the show got more interesting. I know Sarah Jessica Parker is the star of the show, but I thought her to be the most annoying character. She really isn't a likeable character. Miranda is a close second. Samantha is my favorite but that is because Kim Cattrall really pulls it off in the acting department. Anyway, every character has flaws and weaknesses. Carrie's is Mr. Big, who is actually a favorite character of mine. When he appears on screen I already know the episode is going to be a good one. Now, I don't for one moment believe that any of this is truly realistic. I mean, half the situations the girls find themselves in is ridiculous. And no way can Carrie afford to live where she lives and be able to buy all those shoes and outfits, with her 'job'. Also, I'm still amazed by how much sex these girls really have. Its really eye opening. Again, unrealstic, but it is just a show after all.

It mainly explores their relationships with men, their desires and actions to be fabulous women and the often hilarious failures at trying those things.About this particular box set all I can say is - it is beautiful.

I was astounded when I would watch an episode and view a conversation that I had had almost verbatim with a boyfriend/lover.

YET, it is SARAH'S face and figure HOGGING the label side of ALL OF THE DVDS. Can you believe that? Sarah is such a prima donna, she won't let ANY of the other cast members have their face on even ONE dvd!! Yeah, like you're hurting for the cash and exposure right, honey? Not only THAT, but Sarah's character is the WHINIEST and the WEAKEST of the four. And unlike Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha she is the only cast member who did NOT do a nude scene. Otherwise, this is a GREAT collection. I LOVE nearly EVERY episode. What's sad is that none of the girls could be bothered to record a commentary track, so that's a slap in the face to SATC fans. The few commentaries that are included are pretty good. Oh, and be careful handling the cases the discs are housed in - one of mine is starting to come loose. One of the greatest shows ever!!!After having seen the bonus material for season 6.5, I would love to DOCK this set one star for FALSE ADVERTISING. The pitch that there are 3 ""alternate endings"" is BOGUS. SATC fans, were we not lead to believe that there were different bona fide endings filmed for the final episode?
