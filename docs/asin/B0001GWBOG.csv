We have often had little ones (age 1 to 5) get into little squabbling times . . . putting on these DVDs draws them to watch and have their spirits ministered to, their squabbles ending.  Must admit I enjoy the music as background as well!  We  have a set of three DVDs and enjoy them all about equally.  The real delight is when the little ones start singing some of the gentle worship music on their own!",5,Wonderful!,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,519,"['have', 'used', 'series', 'lot', 'grand', 'kids', 'DVDs', 'enhance', 'quiet', 'atmosphere', 'little', 'ones', 'have', 'often', 'had', 'little', 'ones', 'age', '1', '5', 'get', 'little', 'squabbling', 'times', 'putting', 'DVDs', 'watch', 'have', 'spirits', 'ministered', 'squabbles', 'ending', 'Must', 'admit', 'enjoy', 'music', 'as', 'background', 'well', 'have', 'set', 'three', 'DVDs', 'enjoy', 'equally', 'real', 'delight', 'when', 'little', 'ones', 'start', 'singing', 'gentle', 'worship', 'music', 'own']",Praises & Smiles

(sp?)THe music is so pleasant and soft, and they were all songs we recognized from church.  The scenes on the video are very colorful and bright and even educational in some ways!  We definitely plan to get more!

She still watches it, especially before nap and bed time as a way to wind her down.  This DVD has many animals like a lion, and a monkeyish animal, and has emphasis on the alphabet and numbers.  I would recommend this to any parent with children about 6 to 18 months old.",4,Good DVD for 6-18 month olds,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,387,"['little', 'girl', 'loves', 'music', 'wanted', 'be', 'enriched', 'spiritually', 'so', 'bought', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'still', 'especially', 'nap', 'bed', 'time', 'way', 'wind', 'down', 'DVD', 'many', 'animals', 'lion', 'monkeyish', 'animal', 'emphasis', 'alphabet', 'numbers', 'would', 'recommend', 'parent', 'children', '6', '18', 'months', 'old']",Praises & Smiles

Now however, her younger sister is the one who is constantly asking for ""Praise Baby"".  I was delighted to discover this is not the only DVD of the collection as well.  Perhaps, having had this one the longest, and listening to my daughers sing the songs, it is my favourite.  Most of the songs are commonly sung worship tunes.I highly recommend this DVD, especially if your child/children have a love of music and singing.",5,My favourite Praise Baby DVD,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,550,"['DVD', 'was', 'received', 'gift', 'when', 'second', 'daughter', 'was', 'baby', 'grew', 'love', 'still', 'age', '4', 'Now', 'however', 'younger', 'sister', 'one', 'who', 'constantly', 'asking', 'Praise', 'Baby', 'was', 'delighted', 'discover', 'not', 'only', 'DVD', 'collection', 'as', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'having', 'had', 'one', 'longest', 'listening', 'daughers', 'sing', 'songs', 'favourite', 'Most', 'songs', 'are', 'commonly', 'sung', 'worship', 'tunes.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'especially', 'child/children', 'have', 'love', 'music', 'singing']",Praises & Smiles
