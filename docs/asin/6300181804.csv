Lots of great character actors in fine fettle, including:  Andrew Duggan, Tom Bosley, Vito Scotti, John Williams, James Gregory, Norman Fell and Buck Henry -- plus a host of others who give marvelous performances.Other reviewers have covered the synopsis very well, so I won't go into the story itself.A hilarious turn is put in by Fabrizio Mioni as an Italian soldier whose English was probably learned from reading canned food labels and dust jackets of books.  He babbles as if he is reading clock-making instructions which have been translated by computer from German to Japanese to French to English.  Imagine learning those lines as an actor and pulling it off!Vito Scotti does his usual fine job of playing the obsequious Italian ""warden"" of the castle prison.The beautiful Sylva Koscina provides the pulchritude.The motion picture code was in effect when this story was filmed.  In a lot of ways, these older films benefited from the restrictions as they are ""clean"" enough to be viewed by all ages.  The ""romantic"" interludes are suggested instead of shown -- in a film like this, a definite benefit.Needless to say, a good time is had by all.The DVD is crisp and the audio excellent -- and shown in it's original widescreen format.

General Homer Prentiss (James Gregory) of Army Public Relations decides to enlist the services of Private Frigg (Newman) in arranging the generals' escape... Frigg, it seems, is a rebel and consummate escape artist who lands constantly in the stockade and he might well apply his rare skills to release the generals...Frigg is promoted to Major General, and is sent in to lead them out... But once at the villa, he falls for the beautiful Contessa (Koscina), and keeps delaying the escape...Newman is amusing as the silly officer who must pass himself off as a cultured general who is too modern and cool in his role...If you are looking for a nice comedy, the film is humorous and, as usual, Sylva Koscina is so lovely to look at...",3,"Enjoyable war farce; funny, inventive and entertaining...",1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,1046,"['story', 'five', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Allied', 'Generals', 'who', 'were', 'captured', 'Tunisian', 'Turkish', 'bath', 'Italians', 'once', 'taken', 'sumptuous', 'Italian', 'villa', 'prison', 'villa', 'command', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Ferrucci', 'Vito', 'Scotti', 'five', 'generals', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'escape', 'plan', 'General', 'Homer', 'Prentiss', 'James', 'Gregory', 'Army', 'Public', 'Relations', 'enlist', 'services', 'Private', 'Frigg', 'Newman', 'arranging', 'generals', 'escape', 'Frigg', 'rebel', 'consummate', 'escape', 'artist', 'who', 'constantly', 'stockade', 'might', 'well', 'apply', 'rare', 'skills', 'release', 'generals', 'Frigg', 'promoted', 'Major', 'General', 'sent', 'lead', 'out', 'once', 'villa', 'beautiful', 'Contessa', 'Koscina', 'delaying', 'escape', 'Newman', 'amusing', 'silly', 'officer', 'who', 'must', 'pass', 'off', 'cultured', 'general', 'who', 'too', 'modern', 'cool', 'role', 'are', 'looking', 'nice', 'comedy', 'film', 'humorous', 'usual', 'Sylva', 'Koscina', 'so', 'lovely', 'look']",N/A
