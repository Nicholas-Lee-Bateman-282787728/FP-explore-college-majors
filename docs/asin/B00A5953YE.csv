1606027,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B00A5953YE,Amit Talpade,"[5, 5]","The pressure to speak English has been immense in a country with a colonial past that is India. Speaking it perfectly is necessary for survival.In English Vinglish, Ad maker Gauri Shinde, brings to life the story of Shashi a shy housewife, who has been struggling to gain the respect of her daughter ( a spoilt brat) and her husband Adil Hussain because she hardly speaks any English. A wedding in America allows her to travel to America and inspires her to attend English classes.Shashi in the film is the homemaker, slaving selflessly and endlessly in the kitchen while the needs of her mother in law, her husband and her children are met. She is also entrepreneurial - selling ladoos (popular Indian deserts) but that is not an asset because no one cares for this skill, all they care is that she cannot converse in English.A well written script brings out the actress in Sridevi at every turn, whether she is explaining plantain chips in front of a visibly shocked daughter, or breaking into a gig or stunning viewers with a monologue in English towards the end of the movie. The script serves the actress in Sridevi. It is impossible to make a comeback after staying away for almost two decades but Sri manages it without any problems. She is better than ever and is refreshing and surprisingly at the top of her game after being away for so long. I am convinced that acting has muscle memory after watching Sridevi emote.While watching the film, some of us may feel that too much fuss is being made about the main characters inability to speak English but the movie is not about that, it is about the small triumphs and the journey of Shashi with and without her family.I highly recommend this film, and I believe this is one of the best films of 2012. Five stars. 2/15/2013",5,Shashi may not know English but she sure can give lessons in acting.,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,1780,"['pressure', 'speak', 'English', 'been', 'immense', 'country', 'colonial', 'past', 'India', 'Speaking', 'perfectly', 'necessary', 'survival.In', 'English', 'Vinglish', 'Ad', 'maker', 'Gauri', 'Shinde', 'life', 'story', 'Shashi', 'shy', 'housewife', 'who', 'been', 'struggling', 'gain', 'respect', 'daughter', 'spoilt', 'brat', 'husband', 'Adil', 'Hussain', 'hardly', 'English', 'wedding', 'America', 'travel', 'America', 'attend', 'English', 'classes.Shashi', 'film', 'homemaker', 'slaving', 'selflessly', 'endlessly', 'kitchen', 'needs', 'mother', 'law', 'husband', 'children', 'are', 'met', 'also', 'entrepreneurial', 'selling', 'ladoos', 'popular', 'Indian', 'deserts', 'not', 'asset', 'one', 'skill', 'care', 'can', 'not', 'converse', 'English.A', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'out', 'actress', 'Sridevi', 'turn', 'explaining', 'plantain', 'chips', 'front', 'visibly', 'shocked', 'daughter', 'breaking', 'gig', 'stunning', 'viewers', 'monologue', 'English', 'end', 'movie', 'script', 'actress', 'Sridevi', 'impossible', 'make', 'comeback', 'staying', 'away', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'Sri', 'problems', 'better', 'ever', 'refreshing', 'surprisingly', 'top', 'game', 'being', 'away', 'so', 'long', 'am', 'convinced', 'acting', 'muscle', 'memory', 'watching', 'Sridevi', 'emote.While', 'watching', 'film', 'may', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'fuss', 'being', 'made', 'main', 'characters', 'inability', 'speak', 'English', 'movie', 'not', 'small', 'triumphs', 'journey', 'Shashi', 'family.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2012', 'Five', 'stars', '2/15/2013']",N/A
1606028,AX1FPJM2BNZ0D,B00A5953YE,Anne-Marie,"[9, 9]","I was just trying to get through an 11-hour overnight flight when I chose this film as an alternative to the endless action flicks and straight-to-video Hollywood selections. What a FABULOUS little film! An excellent cast, with an excellent premise about a beautiful woman from India--touchingly portrayed by the lovely Sridevi, in the kind of attractively vulnerable role often played by Julia Roberts-- who is taken for granted by her family, who treat her with derision for her inability to speak English.When she is sent alone to New York by her disrespectful husband, to perform a family duty, she is seen with new eyes by her fellow students in an English school in Manhattan, who recognize her as the gem that she is.The gorgeous Mehdi Nebbou--who was riveting in Steven Spielberg's ""Munich""--is excellent as Laurent, the hunky French English student who falls for her--and gives her inattentive husband a serious run for his money.A bevy of charming cousins completes the cast, all the way to a heartwarming surprise finale. This is a very smart feel-good movie with a happy ending, with lots of beautiful Indian clothes and dancing. But it is also an excellent family film--for any age group or ethnicity--about family dynamics, and the need for spouses and children to respect and appreciate one another. And as Sridevi says, in her triumphant English speech, not be ""judgmental.""I'll look for this director--and I think this remarkable actress could seriously carry a meaty role in another independent film.",5,LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,1518,"['was', 'just', 'trying', 'get', '11-hour', 'overnight', 'flight', 'when', 'chose', 'film', 'alternative', 'endless', 'action', 'flicks', 'straight-to-video', 'Hollywood', 'selections', 'What', 'FABULOUS', 'little', 'film', 'excellent', 'cast', 'excellent', 'premise', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'India', 'touchingly', 'portrayed', 'lovely', 'Sridevi', 'kind', 'attractively', 'vulnerable', 'role', 'often', 'played', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'taken', 'granted', 'family', 'who', 'treat', 'derision', 'inability', 'speak', 'English.When', 'sent', 'alone', 'New', 'York', 'disrespectful', 'husband', 'perform', 'family', 'duty', 'seen', 'new', 'eyes', 'fellow', 'students', 'English', 'school', 'Manhattan', 'who', 'recognize', 'gem', 'gorgeous', 'Mehdi', 'Nebbou', 'who', 'was', 'riveting', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Munich', 'excellent', 'Laurent', 'hunky', 'French', 'English', 'student', 'who', 'inattentive', 'husband', 'serious', 'run', 'money.A', 'bevy', 'charming', 'cousins', 'cast', 'way', 'heartwarming', 'surprise', 'finale', 'very', 'smart', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'lots', 'beautiful', 'Indian', 'clothes', 'dancing', 'also', 'excellent', 'family', 'film', 'age', 'group', 'ethnicity', 'family', 'dynamics', 'need', 'spouses', 'children', 'respect', 'appreciate', 'one', 'Sridevi', 'triumphant', 'English', 'speech', 'not', 'be', 'judgmental', ""'ll"", 'look', 'director', 'think', 'remarkable', 'actress', 'could', 'seriously', 'carry', 'meaty', 'role', 'independent', 'film']",N/A
1606029,A3VI8KO303141L,B00A5953YE,bekagoose,"[2, 2]","This is a very quiet movie that makes a huge impact on those who watch it. I love Bollywood movies and love that this was actually a heroine focused movie which isn't as common in Bollywood movies as it is in Hollywood movies.From the beginning we meet Shashi, who is a wife and mother of two children (girl and boy), she also makes ladoos and sells them to those around her neighborhood. I've never had ladoos, but I'm dying to try one now! Her husband is very dismissive of her and we see that when she mispronounces an English word, we also see this dismissiveness when she calls him to tell him how many ladoos she sold that day and he says he is busy and can't talk to her. From the title of the movie we can tell that Shashi has a problem with English. She must go to her daughter's PTA meeting and bumbs into a mother of her daughter's friend, who begins to talk to her in English. Shashi just nods her head and her daughter jumps into the conversation. This gives us a glimpse that she is not fluent in English and that her daughter is embarrassed by this fact. After the PTA meeting we see Shashi's daughter being rude to her for not knowing English and talking to her teacher in Hindi. It is heartbreaking to she Shashi start to cry a little on the ride back to the house. We can see how lonely she is and how her family pays her little respect. It seems her only joy comes from making her sweets which is her solace from her family.Then the call comes from Shashi's sister who lives in New York, to tell that her eldest daughter is getting married to an American. Her husband decides that Shashi will go a few weeks ahead of the family to help her sister with the preparations. Shashi is very upset with this decision since she does not know English or how to get around, but her husband doesn't seem too concerned that he is sending his wife to an entirley different country than her own. I admire that she does get on the plane to go to America, that takes a lot of courage to go to a country where you do not know the langugae. The scene on the plane, where Amitabh Bachchan is her seat mate, is extremely funny, as he translates the English movie to Hindi for her. Laugh out loud fun! When she gets to New York disaster is soon to follow when Shashi's niece takes her to a park to wait for her to get done with her classes for the day. Shashi deciedes to go to a cafe for some food. The cashier is rude and frustrated that Shashi doesn't speak English and the end result is Shashi without lunch and in tears on a bench.After this moment she decides to learn English and she enrolls in a four week course. She ends up having to get to the Language Center all by herself, and I admire that she was determined to do it. The scenes of her learning English with the other students is very sweet and funny, and I love the teacher who is very eccentric. There are some very sweet moments between Shashi and the other students as they all struggle to learn this complicated langugae. We can see Shashi becoming more and more confident as the classes go on, and she enjoys this new part of her life. But it is cut short when her family arrives early for the wedding and she is not able to go to the last couple of classes. After an important scene (I won't say what happens) she becomes very upset with herself for putting so much focus on her English lessons when that was not the reason for her being there. She feels that she has failed as a mother for forgetting her responsibilities. I won't give the rest of the movie away but it is beautiful.What I find wonderful about this movie is how many lessons can be learned from it. I think this movie encourages us to look at how we are treating those who are close to us. We are hurt when Shashi is put down by her family, and it makes us take a look at our own life and see who we may be putting down unecessarily. I think this movie also encourages us to do things we are scared of doing. Shashi is terrified by New York, and by learning English, but she does it and it gives her confidence to stand up for herself. As a native-English speaker this movie helped me realize that English is not easy to learn, and it is very hard to foriegners who are new to America. We see Shashi try to figure out how the langugae works, and we watch her struggle to get around New York and around with people who she cannot communicate with. It helped me realize that being in a completely different country and culture is extremely hard if you are not used to it.Sridevi had a spectacular performance for not having acted in 15 years. She is stunning as Shashi. The emotions she portrays break our hearts and make us smile as we watch her grow in this foriegn country. She is a brilliant actress who embodies her characters fully. This character was made for her.This is a non-traditional Bollywood movie but it is no less than those movies with dancing and singing. It it a beautiful story of a woman truely figuring herself out in this new world. It is one of those movies that everyone should see, not just those who love Bollywood movies.

I think I'm on firm footing when I say that I'd put Sridevi's scintillating performance in English Vinglish against whichever other best you can come up with for 2012.It's a crap title, but that's the only negative thing I can think of about the  movie. In an ocean of redundancy, English Vinglish surges against the tides. Does it add flavoring to learn that writer/director Gauri Shinde made the film in part as an apology to her mother, on whom she based the central character? Like the character's daughter, Gauri as a child was embarrassed of her mom's poor grasp of English. And here we were some years back, hailing Esperanto as the universal language.In India, Shashi Godbole (Sridevi) is a dedicated housewife and devoted mother, never mind that she's marginalized by her husband (a smug Adil Hussain) and ridiculed by her daughter (Navika Kotia) for her provincial ways and for her inability to speak proper English. Shashi is a gifted cook who runs a modest business making and selling sweets to the neighborhood, an enterprise her husband looks down on. Y'know, here's a fella that's begging for an earnest asskicking.The plot really kicks off when Shashi's older sister calls from New York asking for help in preparing for her daughter's impending nuptials. Picture Shashi in panic mode now, especially since she must fly for the first time and fly alone because the rest of her family aren't urgently needed and will meet her in New York in several weeks.English Vinglish is mostly shot on location in New York, and it's there that Shashi embarks on her transformative journey. Okay, that's not right. It actually starts on that plane when Shashi ends up seated next to an obliging elderly gent (Amitabh Bachchan) who guides her thru the strange workings of an arduous international flight. For the duration of his brief cameo, Amitabh's helpful passenger does his darndest to enable Shashi.It's not a film that sweeps you with the highest of stakes, and yet the scenes that play out are no less devastating. It's absorbing stuff, eyeballing this simple woman as she tries to cope in a scary, unfamiliar environment. I wonder, will you cringe in heartbreak like I did at the coffee shop scene as a thoroughly intimidated Shashi is braced by an aggressive counter clerk? Sridevi is so damn good. She reinforces that bit of wisdom that simple does not equate to stupid. Moments after this crushing scene, a gutted Shashi Godbole glimpses a bus ad claiming to teach paying students how to speak English in four weeks.We track each of the hesitant choices Shashi makes, the small steps she takes to change herself, and we celebrate her incremental moments of triumph, until finally we arrive at that scene in which she navigates the bustling New York avenues with confident strides, handbag breezily flung over one shoulder. That scene makes me beam.Gauri Shinde, who'd previously made short films and advertising spots, makes her feature film directorial debut, and it's a self-assured one. I guess we're waiting to see if she's a one-hit wonder. For now she's being lauded universally, and it's well-deserved. English Vinglish was such a pleasure to watch, a Bollywood feature that sharply separates itself from the homogenized efforts that sprinkle the breadth of Indian cinema. Shinde has crafted an unerring picture, inhabited by gentle humor and keen insight and emotional beats that run the gamut of gut-wrenching to uplifting. It's Gauri and Sridevi's potent shoutout to the hope and the dream of the Indian woman as a figure that retains dignity and is respected and cherished and treated as a peer. And who can make a kickass plate of ladoo.What I have is the 2-disc set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation (English sub-titles available).

The music feels like English or European folk music, with Hindi lyrics, no Shehnai's, big strings, sitars or dramatic vocal chorus.This is an absolutely stellar performance by Sri Devi, especially if you've seen some of her older films, for example, I've seen her in 'Lahme', where she was very cheeky and danced a lot. Here she is an emotionally bereft middle aged lady who clearly lacks respect in her life.She takes up English classes to try and learn the language that, without knowing, is depriving her respect from her closest relatives (as her husband always says, 'Shashi was born to make Ladoo'). There she meets some interesting people and she goes on an emotional roller-coaster ride, especially trying to evade the omnipresent Laurent, played by Mehdi Nebbou who also puts in a great performanc, and making friends with other people who are struggling with English.I didn't like the movie so much because of it's emotional attachment to the struggles of those people who can't speak English, I didn't realise people cared so much about that, but I liked it because it's an enjoyable film to watch and because of good acting and a good storyline, and Amitji's cameo is a blast too!
