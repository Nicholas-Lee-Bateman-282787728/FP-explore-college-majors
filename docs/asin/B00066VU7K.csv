861880,A33FCLUEQSUD68,B00066VU7K,Claire,"[1, 1]","Yes, yes, I know it is confusing with the title changes that have occurred here. Originally titled ""The Boyfriend School"" after the novel, the title was changed to ""Don't Tell Her It's Me"" when it was released in theaters but then changed back to its original title when released on dvd. However, the VHS tapes still use the ""Don't Tell..."" title. I have no clue why the titles were switched around so much. A similar thing happened to another movie that was ironically also filmed in Charleston and that was the 1988 Justine Bateman movie ""Satisfaction"" which is sometimes for some reason referred to as ""Sweet Little Rock & Roller."" Anyway, this is a cute movie whatever the title. I only bought it b/c I collect movies that are filmed here in Charleston since I live here. I like to see how the city and surrounding areas have changed since the times the movies were filmed here. I think the reason this movie is so expensive is b/c it is a lesser-known film so it hasn't exactly been mass-produced and since that means there are fewer copies out there, they have to charge more to make it worth it (make a profit from releasing it on dvd.) It is certainly not worth the $40+ I forked out for it but as I said, I collect movies filmed in my city so wanted to have it for my collection. I had bought the VHS tape that was sold on Amazon but it was not in the best condition since tape gets old and strained to the point that it doesn't play well.

Gus is still on the path to recovery - ergo, still bald and overweight from the radiation therapy - when he encounters lovely journalist Emily Pear, thanks to his matchmaking romance novelist and sister, Lizzie. However, after a disastrous first meeting, Emily is not too enamoured of the self-conscious Gus, though Gus is clearly smitten with her. He calls her up and asks her out but she is too busy ""having oral surgery done"" or ""taking a cajun cooking class."" So Lizzie helps her brother to get back into shape and then assists him in formulating a zany plan to woo and win Emily. Thus, Gus's new persona - the unshaven, bike-riding Lobo of New Zealand  - is born. Emily is instantly attracted to the rugged Lobo, and things seem to be looking up for Gus. But, as Emily falls deeper in fascination with him, how long can Gus keep up the pretense?The Boyfriend School is a funny romantic comedy, with a winning cast. I used to have the biggest crush on Jami Gertz, she of Lost Boys and Less Than Zero fame. She had that waif-like quality that added a dimension of vulnerability to her roles. As Emily Pear, she is down-to-earth and seemingly independent, yet has an inner romantic streak that yearns for happiness and love. I've always liked Steve Guttenberg. He's no great actor, but he's not the worst one, either. Given a character within his acting range, preferably the role of a slightly sardonic average Joe, Guttenberg could admirably pull his weight. In this film, he is engaging and very funny in his dual parts: good guy Gus and the exotic, slightly seedy Lobo.The supporting cast is great, starting with Shelley Long as Gus's busybody but caring sister, Lizzie Potts. Lizzie doesn't drink coffee because she's ""naturally wound up a bit too tight."" I actually like Shelley Long in this role, finding her more palatable here than in Hello Again and Outrageous Fortune. Suffice it to say, she never had it so good as when she played Diane Chambers in Cheers. Kevin Scannell is wonderfully goofy as Mitchell, Lizzie's husband, who accompanies  his highly  unconventional cooking with overbearing opera music. The little girl Annabel (or Piglet) is a hoot, as she is constantly, intensively lectured by her mother on the consequences of putting things (screws, bugs, etc.) in her mouth.I first saw this movie years ago, by the way, when it was titled Don't Tell Her It's Me.

It's one of my favorite contemporary romances of all-time. Originally published in 1989, the book is about Gretchen Griner, an underpaid photographer sent to cover a ""Romantic Times-like"" conference in Austin, complete with cover models and authors dressed in full Southern belle regalia. There she meets bestselling romance author Lizzie Potts (known as Viveca Lamoureaux to her adoring readers) and romantic chaos ensues as the well-meaning Lizzie decides to fix the cynical Gretchen up with her brother Gus by making him over as the ultimate romance hero.One of my readers recently let me know the movie version of THE BOYFRIEND SCHOOL (originally titled DON'T TELL HER IT'S ME) had just been released on DVD. While not quite as good as the book, it really is pretty adorable. And it will make you say four words you never thought you would-- ""Steve Guttenberg is HOT!""When Gretchen (renamed Emily for the movie) first meets Gus, he is recovering from cancer treatments and is boring, bald and bloated. But the quirky Lizzie (played by Shelley Long before anyone realized she wasn't going to be a big movie star) quickly makes him over into ""Lobo,"" a mysterious Harley-straddling hero with a stubbled jaw and a really fine mullet. If you enjoy a romantic comedy that's romantic, funny and touching. I think you'll love this one!
