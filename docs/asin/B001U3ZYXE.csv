1238351,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B001U3ZYXE,Allan M. Lees,"[1, 4]","I quite liked the first three episodes of this UK TV series. Lots of small accurate observations of everyday life, hung on a flimsy but adequate plot structure. For people who enjoy this kind of episodic love-centered drama it's definitely got a few things to recommend it including pretty good acting and some nice lines - clever but not so clever as to make one think ""no one says things like that in real life."" The various relationships unfold in a predictable but also very realistic manner.Until we come to Episode 5, at which point it all starts to feel very over-done indeed. Maybe it's the influence of countless generations of imported US TV shows, maybe it's just our global zeitgeist, but whatever it is, it's had a malevolent effect on UK script writing. The series moves from being a slice-of-life to being a slice-of-Dallas/Desperate Housewives/Sex-in-the-City and whatever else you can scrape up off the bottom of someone's old weekly TV Guide.Worse yet, the true-to-life observations fly out of the window. One of the most characteristic qualities of a break-up is the way in which  people (and especially women) re-write history in order to justify their actions. Memories shift, distort, and alter overnight. But here, the protagonists all continue to share a common frame of reference. And this is what ultimately makes the series fall down - what was up until this point an adequate representation of real life becomes just a plot-driven shell where various ""dramatic"" denouements are forced into their various pre-canned places.  And despite continued attempts by the cast to carry the story line, it really disappoints in a big way.  If only there had not been the need for the Hollywood Drama Plot Lines one through seven, this would have been quite an interesting series. As it is, by the end I was feeling depressed by the conformity and predictability of the whole thing - all that was missing was the hackneyed ""so you're really my sister's younger brother"" routine so beloved of US soaps and stale movies.",3,Slice of Life Overcooked,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,2034,"['quite', 'liked', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'UK', 'TV', 'series', 'Lots', 'small', 'accurate', 'observations', 'everyday', 'life', 'hung', 'flimsy', 'adequate', 'plot', 'structure', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'episodic', 'love-centered', 'drama', 'definitely', 'got', 'few', 'things', 'recommend', 'including', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'nice', 'lines', 'clever', 'not', 'so', 'clever', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'one', 'things', 'real', 'life', 'various', 'relationships', 'unfold', 'predictable', 'also', 'very', 'realistic', 'manner.Until', 'come', 'Episode', '5', 'point', 'feel', 'very', 'over-done', 'indeed', 'Maybe', 'influence', 'countless', 'generations', 'imported', 'US', 'TV', 'shows', 'maybe', 'just', 'global', 'zeitgeist', 'had', 'malevolent', 'effect', 'UK', 'script', 'writing', 'series', 'being', 'slice-of-life', 'being', 'slice-of-Dallas/Desperate', 'Housewives/Sex-in-the-City', 'else', 'can', 'scrape', 'up', 'bottom', 'someone', 'old', 'weekly', 'TV', 'Guide.Worse', 'yet', 'true-to-life', 'observations', 'fly', 'window', 'One', 'most', 'characteristic', 'qualities', 'break-up', 'way', 'people', 'especially', 'women', 're-write', 'history', 'order', 'justify', 'actions', 'Memories', 'shift', 'distort', 'alter', 'overnight', 'here', 'protagonists', 'continue', 'share', 'common', 'frame', 'reference', 'what', 'ultimately', 'series', 'fall', 'down', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'point', 'adequate', 'representation', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'plot-driven', 'shell', 'where', 'various', 'dramatic', 'denouements', 'are', 'forced', 'various', 'pre-canned', 'places', 'continued', 'attempts', 'cast', 'carry', 'story', 'line', 'really', 'big', 'way', 'only', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'need', 'Hollywood', 'Drama', 'Plot', 'Lines', 'one', 'seven', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'interesting', 'series', 'end', 'was', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'conformity', 'predictability', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'hackneyed', 'so', ""'re"", 'really', 'sister', 'younger', 'brother', 'routine', 'so', 'beloved', 'US', 'soaps', 'stale', 'movies']",N/A

It is upscale soap opera, however, which always sweetens the deal. The chief reason I tuned in was because Sharon Small is in it.  She played Havers on the Detective Lynley Mysteries and developed a lot of fans on this side of the pond as well as her own side.There is another recognizable star too.  The actress who plays Olivia in the American prime time weekly series FRINGE is also in this UK series.  I did not realize she was British until I saw this show.There is one problem with this series.  There are too many characters for only a six episode series.  Thus short shrift is given to each story instead of the longer and better study which could have been given the better ones. The best stories are of Small as the 9/11 widow with a two million pound settlement and the woman doctor who had an affair with her dying patient and then helped him die by morphine (euthanasia).  She gets involved with his son.Less convincing are: 1) the female lawyer who has a sterile husband and gets pregnant by another lawyer in her firm and 2) the promiscuous lesbian who is all over the map on commitment issues. Both of these stories had so many variables piled onto them that they became totally unbelievable.If you wish to see Small in a romance vehicle in which she does not have to share screen time with 3 other women's stories, I recommend you try GLASGOW KISS instead.I did not like SEX AND THE CITY.  However, I have liked DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, although it has now seen its better days.  I would say that if you are a huge fan of SEX AND THE CITY, that you will probably also love this show.  If you are a huge fan of DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, you may not, as this series is a lot gooier and sweeter than DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.",4,3.5 stars: Pure Soap Opera-Everything But Missing Twin & Amnesia!,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,1932,"['really', '3.5', 'stars', 'Amazon', 'not', 'give', 'half', 'stars', 'use', 'reviews.How', 'much', 'show', 'going', 'depend', 'how', 'much', 'soap', 'operas', 'day', 'evening', 'fare', 'upscale', 'soap', 'opera', 'however', 'always', 'deal', 'chief', 'reason', 'tuned', 'was', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'played', 'Havers', 'Detective', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', 'developed', 'lot', 'fans', 'side', 'pond', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'side.There', 'recognizable', 'star', 'too', 'actress', 'who', 'Olivia', 'American', 'prime', 'time', 'weekly', 'series', 'FRINGE', 'also', 'UK', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'was', 'British', 'saw', 'show.There', 'one', 'problem', 'series', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'only', 'six', 'episode', 'series', 'Thus', 'short', 'shrift', 'given', 'story', 'instead', 'longer', 'better', 'study', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'better', 'ones', 'best', 'stories', 'are', 'Small', '9/11', 'widow', 'two', 'million', 'pound', 'settlement', 'woman', 'doctor', 'who', 'had', 'affair', 'dying', 'patient', 'then', 'helped', 'die', 'morphine', 'euthanasia', 'involved', 'son.Less', 'convincing', 'are', '1', 'female', 'lawyer', 'who', 'sterile', 'husband', 'pregnant', 'lawyer', 'firm', '2', 'promiscuous', 'lesbian', 'who', 'map', 'commitment', 'issues', 'stories', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'variables', 'piled', 'became', 'totally', 'unbelievable.If', 'wish', 'see', 'Small', 'romance', 'vehicle', 'not', 'have', 'share', 'screen', 'time', '3', 'other', 'women', 'stories', 'recommend', 'try', 'GLASGOW', 'KISS', 'instead.I', 'did', 'not', 'SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'However', 'have', 'liked', 'DESPERATE', 'HOUSEWIVES', 'now', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'will', 'probably', 'also', 'love', 'show', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'DESPERATE', 'HOUSEWIVES', 'may', 'not', 'series', 'lot', 'gooier', 'sweeter', 'DESPERATE', 'HOUSEWIVES']",N/A

1238367,A3CNM18PWKI1Z9,B001U3ZYXE,Olga Bezhanova,"[35, 43]","The BBC show Mistresses reminded me of how differently women are viewed in Europe and North America. Mistresses is obviously inspired by Sex and the City. In the British show, four women who remain friends through all kinds of hardship and emotional turmoil even share the professions of some of the characters of Sex and the City. The way these shows portray women, however, couldn't be more different.First, the characters of Mistresses look normal. They dress like regular women, their hair looks regular. Nobody on the BBC show is trying to create an illusion that women walk around the city and even go to work in skimpy shimmery dresses and outrageous heels, all the while keeping every hair on their heads in its place.The most striking difference, of course, is not the characters' appearance. What really attracts me to the BBC show is that the women in Mistresses aren't pathetic. It's such a relief to see women who can have all the problems in the world but still never come close to being so ridiculously pathetic as the characters of shows such as Sex and the City.In the American show, beautiful and successful women are ready to humiliate themselves to the extreme to recieve a crumb of affection from any passing loser. Besides being absolutely unrealistic, this image of contemporary womanhood is very offensive. Mistresses, on the other hand, doesn't follow such silly stereotypes. The female characters are surrounded by normal, attractive, realistically-looking men. They follow their hearts and their bodies without repeating the word ""relationship"" every 15 seconds. When they get together, they don't spend hours figuring out what HE said and did and what it means for the relationship. The characters of Mistresses concentrate on their own feelings and desires.Watch BBC if you want to be reminded of what feminism is supposed to be about and just how dead it is in the US.clarissasbox.blogspot.com/",5,Great!,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,1924,"['BBC', 'show', 'Mistresses', 'reminded', 'how', 'differently', 'women', 'are', 'viewed', 'Europe', 'North', 'America', 'Mistresses', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'Sex', 'City', 'British', 'show', 'four', 'women', 'who', 'remain', 'friends', 'kinds', 'hardship', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'even', 'share', 'professions', 'characters', 'Sex', 'City', 'way', 'shows', 'portray', 'women', 'however', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different.First', 'characters', 'Mistresses', 'look', 'normal', 'dress', 'regular', 'women', 'hair', 'regular', 'Nobody', 'BBC', 'show', 'trying', 'create', 'illusion', 'women', 'walk', 'city', 'even', 'go', 'work', 'skimpy', 'shimmery', 'dresses', 'outrageous', 'heels', 'while', 'keeping', 'hair', 'heads', 'place.The', 'most', 'striking', 'difference', 'course', 'not', 'characters', 'appearance', 'What', 'really', 'BBC', 'show', 'women', 'Mistresses', 'are', ""n't"", 'pathetic', 'such', 'relief', 'see', 'women', 'who', 'can', 'have', 'problems', 'world', 'still', 'never', 'come', 'close', 'being', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'pathetic', 'characters', 'shows', 'such', 'Sex', 'City.In', 'American', 'show', 'beautiful', 'successful', 'women', 'are', 'ready', 'humiliate', 'extreme', 'recieve', 'crumb', 'affection', 'passing', 'loser', 'being', 'absolutely', 'unrealistic', 'image', 'contemporary', 'womanhood', 'very', 'offensive', 'Mistresses', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'follow', 'such', 'silly', 'stereotypes', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'surrounded', 'normal', 'attractive', 'realistically-looking', 'men', 'follow', 'hearts', 'bodies', 'repeating', 'word', 'relationship', '15', 'seconds', 'When', 'get', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'hours', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'HE', 'said', 'did', 'what', 'relationship', 'characters', 'Mistresses', 'concentrate', 'own', 'feelings', 'desires.Watch', 'BBC', 'want', 'be', 'reminded', 'what', 'feminism', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'just', 'how', 'dead', 'US.clarissasbox.blogspot.com/']",N/A

I was so excited about the U.S. version that was advertised and couldn't wait to see it that I watched the entire British version on Amazon to whet my appetite.  If I had realized that I was spoiling my experience by watching this more enticing version first, I might have done things differently.  At least I can eliminate a program from my DVR now.",4,The Brits outdid us on this one,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,670,"['American', 'who', 'U.S.', 'best', 'producer', 'good', 'television', 'movies', 'embarrassing', 'admit', 'British', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'series', 'exception', 'cold', 'character', 'portrayal', 'actress', 'Siobhan', 'casting', 'far', 'superior', 'British', 'version', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'U.S.', 'version', 'was', 'advertised', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'watched', 'entire', 'British', 'version', 'Amazon', 'whet', 'appetite', 'had', 'realized', 'was', 'spoiling', 'experience', 'watching', 'more', 'enticing', 'version', 'first', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'things', 'differently', 'least', 'can', 'eliminate', 'program', 'DVR', 'now']",N/A

The second six episodes are from the second season.Season 1 (i.e. the first six episodes) are really great.  There is so much packed into each episode.  It makes you realize how much filler they put into American dramas.  While some storylines were more interesting to me than others, the whole thing held my attention.With a title like ""Mistresses"" one can easily assume that all the women are mistresses.  That's not exactly true.  Katie was the mistress of a man who has just died, but for her it wasn't casual.  She loved the man and believed that he loved her.  Jessica likes casual sex and relishes being a mistress because that means there are no attachments, until she becomes the mistress of someone that she wants to keep all for herself.  Siobhan isn't a mistress but rather a cheater.  She loves her husband, but when their sex life is lacking, she looks elsewhere to get her sexual needs met.  And Trudi also is not a mistress.  It is her husband (presumed dead) that she finds out had been deceiving her, both by cheating on her and other lies as well.  Season 1 was all high fun and high drama.  I recommend these first six episodes without restraint.But season 2... well, season 2 does not live up to season 1's standards.  Basically, all the characters relive their storylines from season 1 but with different love interests.  Katie finds herself the mistress of a man she really cares about, just like the set up for season 1.  Jessica marries a man with the understanding of an open marriage, but then she finds she doesn't want to share him... just like the realization she came to in season 1.  Siobhan still loves her husband but is still dissatisfied with their sex life, so she decides to go outside her marriage to get her needs met... just like she did in season 1.  The new man in Trudi's life is not cheating on her, but he has been lying to her about numerous important things... just like her husband had done in season 1.Granted, it can't be easy to keep a premise like this going.  With ""Mistresses"" as the title, there's got to be a lot of infidelity.  It's too bad that they could find different ways to express it though.  I found season 2 to be a big let down after how fabulous season 1 was.  Another big difference between season 1 and season 2 was the amount of time the women spend together.  In season 1, they share a lot of scenes and you get a good sense of how important their friendship is to them.  In season 2, they spend very little time together, and when they are together, they're rarely fully honest with each other.All things considered, season 1 was really great.  I'm glad I watched it, and if you like dramas, don't hesitate to give ""Mistresses"" a try.",4,"Season 1 was awesome - Season 2, meh",1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,2800,"['Mistresses', 'Vol', '1', '12', 'episodes', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'second', 'season.Season', '1', 'i.e', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'so', 'much', 'packed', 'episode', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'filler', 'put', 'American', 'dramas', 'storylines', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'others', 'whole', 'thing', 'held', 'attention.With', 'title', 'Mistresses', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'assume', 'women', 'are', 'mistresses', 'not', 'exactly', 'true', 'Katie', 'was', 'mistress', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'died', 'was', ""n't"", 'casual', 'loved', 'man', 'believed', 'loved', 'Jessica', 'casual', 'sex', 'relishes', 'being', 'mistress', 'are', 'attachments', 'mistress', 'someone', 'keep', 'Siobhan', ""n't"", 'mistress', 'rather', 'cheater', 'husband', 'when', 'sex', 'life', 'lacking', 'elsewhere', 'get', 'sexual', 'needs', 'met', 'Trudi', 'also', 'not', 'mistress', 'husband', 'presumed', 'dead', 'out', 'had', 'been', 'deceiving', 'cheating', 'other', 'lies', 'well', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'high', 'fun', 'high', 'drama', 'recommend', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'restraint.But', 'season', '2', 'well', 'season', '2', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'season', '1', 'standards', 'Basically', 'characters', 'relive', 'storylines', 'season', '1', 'different', 'love', 'interests', 'Katie', 'mistress', 'man', 'really', 'just', 'set', 'up', 'season', '1', 'Jessica', 'man', 'understanding', 'open', 'marriage', 'then', ""n't"", 'want', 'share', 'just', 'realization', 'came', 'season', '1', 'Siobhan', 'still', 'husband', 'still', 'dissatisfied', 'sex', 'life', 'go', 'marriage', 'get', 'needs', 'met', 'just', 'did', 'season', '1', 'new', 'man', 'Trudi', 'life', 'not', 'cheating', 'been', 'lying', 'numerous', 'important', 'things', 'just', 'husband', 'had', 'done', 'season', '1.Granted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'keep', 'premise', 'going', 'Mistresses', 'title', 'got', 'be', 'lot', 'infidelity', 'too', 'bad', 'could', 'find', 'different', 'ways', 'express', 'found', 'season', '2', 'be', 'big', 'let', 'down', 'how', 'fabulous', 'season', '1', 'was', 'big', 'difference', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'was', 'amount', 'time', 'women', 'spend', 'together', 'season', '1', 'share', 'lot', 'scenes', 'get', 'good', 'sense', 'how', 'important', 'friendship', 'season', '2', 'spend', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'together', 'when', 'are', 'together', ""'re"", 'rarely', 'fully', 'honest', 'other.All', 'things', 'considered', 'season', '1', 'was', 'really', 'great', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'like', 'dramas', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'give', 'Mistresses', 'try']",N/A
