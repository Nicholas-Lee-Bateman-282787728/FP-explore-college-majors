1584002,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0091UMQP2,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","The hype surrounding `Lawrence Anyways' had me anxious from the very start.  Having seen and loved what Xavier Dolan did with `Heartbeats', I was really excited for the next step of his career.  With a clear knack for style, I was truly happy to hear all the talk about the substance found within `Laurence Anyways'.  I have not seen `I Killed My Mother', Dolan's debut (but I plan to shortly), but I did note that as beautiful and soulful as `Heartbeats' was, it was very much like `Jules et Jim' without substance.  If Dolan could mesh his undeniable sense of visual with a richly developed core, he could create a true masterpiece.`Laurence Anyways' is a masterpiece.To say that Xavier Dolan may be the best thing to happen to queer cinema is an understatement, although it really does bear repeating.  It goes deeper than that though.  Dolan is one of the freshest, most excited faces in modern cinema, period.  With voices such as Dolan and McQueen and Zeitlin (let's see what he does with film #2), things are looking really good for the future of film.`Laurence Anyways' is one of those films that are hard to shake once you see it.  I watched this last night and I'm still shaken from the experience.  I have seen very few films that have affected me in the same way, possibly none to be honest.  With `Laurence Anyways', Dolan has created one of the finest films ever composed, every crafted and ever completed.  The reason for this is hard to put into words because quite frankly the reason isn't so simple.  In fact, finding a way to shape my thoughts here into a review is proving to be extremely difficult because it find that I have so much to say and yet no idea of where to start or how to coherently express them.  I have been touched so deeply by this film and I fear I'll never be able to do these feelings justice.But I'll try.The film's plot follows a thirty-five year old teacher named Laurence who has been in a relationship with Fred (short for Frederique) for four years.  They are a perfect match, and the first twenty minutes or so of the film do a beautiful job of exposing their fit to us.  We see them laugh and play and connect on a level that goes beyond average relationships.  Then the waters of their relationship are stirred deeply when Laurence exposes his deepest, darkest secret.  Laurence has been struggling with an internal contradiction.  His body is clearly male and yet his mind tells him that he is female.  He hates his reflection and finds his appearance repulsive.  He wants to finally live the life he was meant to live.  This is obviously a shock to Fred, who takes a moment to collect her thoughts before diving headfirst into her new relationship with Laurence, one that isn't so clearly defined and yet more honest and genuine.  Determined to make things work, the hard times are only beginning, and the remainder of the film tackles this beautiful relationship as it grows, shatters, mends and then ultimately comes to terms over the course of ten years.The beautiful thing about `Laurence Anyways' is that it has such natural light.  It feels so blatantly honest and sincere, never falling into clich&eacute;d plot-holes or fashioning itself on a familiar `Hollywood' course.  There were so many opportunities for Dolan to milk his character's situation or produce scenes of obvious manipulation (that bar scene could have gone a completely different direction, as could the board meeting scene) and yet Dolan knows where his focus needs to be and so he delivers a film that feels very invested in truth and a natural progression and presentation of character.  It would have been so easy to purely sympathize with Laurence and make everyone in his way out to be a villain or sorts, but Dolan gives us a complete story without prejudice.  The film felt so pure and non-judgmental.  We come to understand, not only Laurence and Fred but everyone, from Laurence's mother to Fred's sister thanks to the layers of detail that Dolan gives each character.I also applaud how un-sexualized this film is.  When you think of transsexual storylines, it would have been so easy to exploit the sexuality of Laurence, maybe making that a plot point in itself, but Dolan refuses such lazy plotting.  Instead he really made this a character piece that spoke to the inner person and not the sexual side of things, which I found to be so effective and refreshing.  Even the idea that Laurence was not gay made the focus of this film not on his sexuality but on the inner struggle of identity itself.  Really, Dolan kept the focus of this film in the right place every step of the way, and I truly applaud him for that.But Dolan is not the only person who made this film work.  The performances he coaxes out of his two leads (as well as a few of his supporting players) is astonishing.  As the title character, Melvil Poupaud has a very heavy task.  He has to convincingly portray an attractive masculine man who desires to be, and then completely transforms into, a woman.  He does this with fearless abandon.  The inner turmoil is heartbreaking, but even more than that, the confidence he imbues his character towards the films end is remarkable.  Suzanne Clement is a true revelation here though.  She owns this movie.  As the jilted Fred, her cycle of emotions is so hard to watch, it is that real and exposed.And still, the film's merits don't end there.  Dolan is a true showman, and he knows how to frame his films in a way that tug at all of our senses.  Visually, `Laurence Anyways' is haunting.  The natural light used seeps into every frame to highlight the actors, their faces, their clothes (Clement is dressed to the hilt every time) and the use of music here is crushing.  Not only is Nioa's score perfectly placed within the fabric of the film, but Dolan's understanding of music in general and his composition of the film's soundtrack is stellar.  The final scene is already a doozy (I was bawling like a baby) but the use of Craig Armstrong's `Let's Go Out Tonight' was genius.  The only other director I can think of that understands the importance of music within a film is Sophia Coppola.In the end, `Laurence Anyways' is a film about self-discovery and loving one's self, but it is also a sharp and brutally honest look at truly loving another person and the lasting stain they will leave on your soul no matter where their life's journey takes them.",5,An intimate look at

1584004,A2VJE2FIA8O2CO,B0091UMQP2,Brandon I,"[0, 0]","A selection of the opening lines of Laurence Anyways reads like this:&#8220;What are you looking for, Laurence Alia?I&#8217;m looking for a person who understands my language and speaks it. A person who, without being a pariah, will question not only the rights and the value of the marginalized, but also those of the people who claim to be normal.&#8221;Dolan&#8217;s ambitious third feature stumbles, like its main character, through Laurence's transformation from man to woman. It&#8217;s messy and overlong but much more brave and worthwhile than most films you&#8217;ll see this year.In French Canada during the late 1980s, Laurence and Frederique (Fred) fall for one another. However after a period of dating, Laurence tells her that he wants to become woman. Their decade long struggle ensues.When Laurence tells her of his ambivalence towards his gender, she says, &#8220;Everything I love about you, you hate.&#8221; They are each faced with the deep pain of this predicament. He, after being vulnerable about his identity, is rejected by the woman he loves. She is humiliated by his violation of her vulnerable love for him. It&#8217;s easier to sympathize with Laurence, but it should be noted that Fred is being told by the person she loves, that he does not love that part of himself that she is deeply attached to. I feel both of their immense pain.I could never tell exactly what Fred is thinking. She either loves Laurence, male or female, and isn&#8217;t brave enough to face society's rejection of him, or she doesn&#8217;t love Laurence but can&#8217;t face herself for rejecting him based on his new gender preference.PictureEarly on, Fred tells her sister: &#8220;Our generation can take this. We&#8217;re ready for it&#8221;Later in the film, we discover how unready she was. She flips out and screams at the waitress in a crowded restaurant, upset by the waitress&#8217; prying questions about Laurence. Afterwards, she says to Laurence while running away from him, &#8220;Between you and me, who really needs to be fixed?&#8221; The answer to this question is clear, despite Fred&#8217;s assertion. Laurence knows her own identity, but Fred is lost.Laurence Anyways won Best Actress in the Un Certain Regard competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 2012, as well as Best Canadian Feature at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival. Aspects of it will frustrate you, like the overwhelming length and prevalence of artsy shots that sometimes feel forced. That may matter to you during the film and right after, but not next week. Next week you&#8217;ll remember the humanity, the struggle we all face between the aspects of us that make us normal and those that push us into the margins, and that&#8217;s what really matters.Grade: A-",5,GREAT.,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,2764,"['selection', 'opening', 'lines', 'Laurence', 'Anyways', '8220', 'What', 'are', 'looking', 'Laurence', 'Alia', '8217', 'looking', 'person', 'who', 'language', 'A', 'person', 'who', 'being', 'pariah', 'will', 'question', 'not', 'only', 'rights', 'value', 'marginalized', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'normal.', '8221', 'Dolan', '8217', 'ambitious', 'third', 'feature', 'stumbles', 'main', 'character', 'Laurence', 'transformation', 'man', 'woman', '8217', 'messy', 'overlong', 'much', 'more', 'brave', 'worthwhile', 'most', 'films', '8217', 'see', 'year.In', 'French', 'Canada', 'late', '1980s', 'Laurence', 'Frederique', 'Fred', 'fall', 'one', 'However', 'period', 'dating', 'Laurence', 'become', 'woman', 'decade', 'long', 'struggle', 'ensues.When', 'Laurence', 'ambivalence', 'gender', '8220', 'Everything', 'love', 'hate.', '8221', 'are', 'faced', 'deep', 'pain', 'predicament', 'being', 'vulnerable', 'identity', 'rejected', 'woman', 'humiliated', 'violation', 'vulnerable', 'love', '8217', 'easier', 'sympathize', 'Laurence', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Fred', 'being', 'told', 'person', 'not', 'love', 'part', 'deeply', 'attached', 'feel', 'immense', 'pain.I', 'could', 'never', 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'Fred', 'thinking', 'Laurence', 'male', 'female', 'isn', '8217', 'brave', 'enough', 'face', 'society', 'rejection', '8217', 'love', 'Laurence', 'can', '8217', 't', 'face', 'rejecting', 'based', 'new', 'gender', 'preference.PictureEarly', 'Fred', 'sister', '8220', 'generation', 'can', 'take', '8217', 're', 'ready', '8221', 'Later', 'film', 'discover', 'how', 'unready', 'was', 'out', 'screams', 'waitress', 'crowded', 'restaurant', 'upset', 'waitress', '8217', 'prying', 'questions', 'Laurence', 'Afterwards', 'Laurence', 'running', 'away', '8220', 'Between', 'who', 'really', 'be', 'fixed', '8221', 'answer', 'question', 'clear', 'Fred', '8217', 's', 'assertion', 'Laurence', 'own', 'identity', 'Fred', 'lost.Laurence', 'Anyways', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Un', 'Certain', 'Regard', 'competition', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', '2012', 'as', 'well', 'Best', 'Canadian', 'Feature', '2012', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Aspects', 'will', 'frustrate', 'overwhelming', 'length', 'prevalence', 'artsy', 'shots', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'forced', 'may', 'matter', 'film', 'right', 'not', 'next', 'week', 'Next', 'week', '8217', 'remember', 'humanity', 'struggle', 'face', 'aspects', 'make', 'normal', 'push', 'margins', '8217', 's', 'what', 'really', 'matters.Grade', 'A-']",N/A

This tells the tale of Lawrence Alia played by Melvil Poupaud. He in in a slightly unorthodox relationship with his girlfriend Fred Belair (Suzanne Clement `I Killed My Mother'). He is also a lecturer and is as challenging, provocative and sensationalist in his teaching as he is in his domestic life. Then he drops the bombshell that he was born in the wrong body and wants to live the rest of his life as a woman, and he means to go all the way.The full story is told by going back to the time they were first together and tracking the ups and downs of their relationship from the beginning. So we start ten years earlier and the soundtrack reflects the time, so we have the likes of Depeche Mode, the Cure and Duran Duran to spice things up. The use of `The Funeral Party' to juxtapose the atmosphere of the disco was really powerful. Melvil Poupaud is a very attractive man and his first attempts at sartorial femininity would make `Mr. Garrison' of `South Park fame quite proud. But as he develops he makes a really convincing woman so a pretty good effort for all concerned.If you have seen any of Dolan's previous work then you will expect there to be great and challenging camera angles and on screen shenanigans that are anything but trying to be realistic. Instead the great use of colour and symbolism as well as imagery all make for a sumptuous cinematic feast. He also knows when to let the camera tell the story with no dialogue, lots of meaningful shots of people just looking or staring.This is also challenging the `heterosexual orthodoxy', so Bruce LaBruce would be proud, but it does so by contextualising the story of Lawrence and not by grandstanding. This is also full of moments of Grand Theatre and is visually stunning. The acting is superb and one could almost say dynamic. For such a simple plot line, Dolan has managed to dig so deep to explore all of the depths that make someone who they actually are, not just what they think they are supposed to be.This is in French with some English and really, very good sub titles as the translation was partly done by Xavier Dolan too and has a run time of 168 minutes, which may be an issue for some, but I thought every second was used brilliantly, I can not recommend highly enough and am already looking forward to `Miraculum', which is his next offering.",5,A Cinematic feast - with a sex change,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,2480,"['latest', 'uber', 'talented', 'twenty', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'French', 'Canadian', 'actor/director/writer', 'Xavier', 'Dolan', 'check', 'out', 'wonderful', 'Hearbeats', 'tale', 'Lawrence', 'Alia', 'played', 'Melvil', 'Poupaud', 'slightly', 'unorthodox', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Fred', 'Belair', 'Suzanne', 'Clement', 'Killed', 'My', 'Mother', 'also', 'lecturer', 'as', 'challenging', 'provocative', 'sensationalist', 'teaching', 'domestic', 'life', 'Then', 'bombshell', 'was', 'born', 'wrong', 'body', 'live', 'rest', 'life', 'woman', 'go', 'way.The', 'full', 'story', 'told', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'were', 'first', 'together', 'tracking', 'ups', 'downs', 'relationship', 'beginning', 'start', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'soundtrack', 'time', 'have', 'likes', 'Depeche', 'Mode', 'Cure', 'Duran', 'Duran', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'use', 'Funeral', 'Party', 'juxtapose', 'atmosphere', 'disco', 'was', 'really', 'powerful', 'Melvil', 'Poupaud', 'very', 'attractive', 'man', 'first', 'attempts', 'sartorial', 'femininity', 'would', 'make', 'Mr.', 'Garrison', 'South', 'Park', 'fame', 'quite', 'proud', 'really', 'convincing', 'woman', 'pretty', 'good', 'effort', 'concerned.If', 'have', 'seen', 'Dolan', 'previous', 'work', 'then', 'will', 'expect', 'be', 'great', 'challenging', 'camera', 'angles', 'screen', 'shenanigans', 'are', 'anything', 'trying', 'be', 'realistic', 'Instead', 'great', 'use', 'colour', 'symbolism', 'as', 'well', 'imagery', 'make', 'sumptuous', 'cinematic', 'feast', 'also', 'when', 'let', 'camera', 'tell', 'story', 'dialogue', 'lots', 'meaningful', 'shots', 'people', 'just', 'looking', 'staring.This', 'also', 'challenging', 'heterosexual', 'orthodoxy', 'Bruce', 'LaBruce', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'so', 'contextualising', 'story', 'Lawrence', 'not', 'grandstanding', 'also', 'full', 'moments', 'Grand', 'Theatre', 'visually', 'stunning', 'acting', 'superb', 'one', 'could', 'almost', 'say', 'dynamic', 'such', 'simple', 'plot', 'line', 'Dolan', 'managed', 'dig', 'so', 'deep', 'explore', 'depths', 'make', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'what', 'think', 'are', 'supposed', 'be.This', 'French', 'English', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'translation', 'was', 'partly', 'done', 'Xavier', 'Dolan', 'too', 'run', 'time', '168', 'minutes', 'may', 'be', 'issue', 'thought', 'second', 'was', 'used', 'brilliantly', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'am', 'already', 'looking', 'forward', 'Miraculum', 'next', 'offering']",N/A
